Yea I used to play ps4 and was a plat 2, moved to Pc about 4 months ago and hit plat 2 at level 50. I guess i was immediately good on Oc since I used to play csgo a lot and knew how to aim.
---
---
---
Indeed.
---
nope
---
Nope, they aren’t breaking any rules. If you encounter afk players I would suggest leaving the match and finding another one

Imagine the pain of the elite one...yikes
---
Jojokes
---
Damn I'll take it I love the ar 15
---
"Dad that's him! That's who took my lunch money!"
---
I cant believe that cs doesn't automatically rebuy if I die. We're missing this basic quality of life feature because the devs want us to actually play the game before the end of the buy period. It's truly ridiculous.
---
Luck. There's no hacks on PS4, just MnK users.
---
Throw it at the ceiling and struggle to get it back
---
I agree. People had a similar problem with the IQ elite and now it's one of the most popular skins in the game
---
*Flashbang through the store!*
---
I bought the standard addition and it took me 8 months of crazy grinding.
---
I  mean, I wouldn't mind  it if  they  introduced it as a feature   and pretty  much all  of my friends just used   a macro that  purchased everything   they needed  for   them.
---
Wait, recruit doesnt have claymores and impacts
---
Wot
---
Please tell me that's an actual camera!!!
---
Toxic jagers: Not bad kid.
---
No, that's a component that I purchase separately and combine with the 3D-printed parts.
---
I cannot print this clear. Yet.
---
Battle of the Fates is going to be silently playing in the background for the whole set
---
Make another one lol jk good work looks nice and does it actually work or is it ascetic only?
---
U come from Chernobyl ir what?
---
&gt; Let's hope ~~they don't make it an Elite Skin but rather one you can purchase with renown in October's Halloween event, I don't care about animations at the end of the match or any other crap.~~
---
for something so far outside of the realm of possibility we are sure to be disappointed no matter how good the skin is. FTFY
---
why do we exist? seriously though. whats the point then hahaha
---
That's... That's the point...
---
Muahaha, I can touch my ceiling with my fingertips ;D This camera ain't getting away from me!
---
Just noticed that Beaulo liked the post
---
Nice
---
Afraid not, but I'll be looking into it ;)
---
That would be lit
---
I’m soooo close, congrats my man
---
Castle would be too much, i can already imagine the frustration of attacking like aviator/games on villa with full bandit, kaid, castle and mute. If you don't have a thatcher you're fucked
---
old but gold
---
This one is the 15th I've made! They're all out in the world, in the hands of amazing cosplayers in the RS6 community.
---
It's aesthetics only I'm afraid.
---
I always take the surprise first shot, miss it and all following shots then get blasted into the shadow realm by someone that actually knows how to aim.
---
It's still something.
---
Blyat
---
The pulse is very realistic
---
As of rn TSM won a single round and its round 6 on the first map...
---
Dammit I thought this was real, think tachanka would be good but idk about putting it on a shield.
---
Couple questions:
---
How would you intend the other defenders use the glasses (assuming they have to be toggled) would you just add another button for this?
---
Allowing only Zofia and Sledge to open a castle barricade without being damaged seems crazy, especially with a mirror on it as well, I think the mirror could work but electrocuting it seems very strong
---
Dont play ranked enough to know whether or not she works after gold 2 but that is definately not gold 2 or above gameplay no matter how hard you try to convince me that it is I wont believe it.
---
Literally in a few months everyone is gonna love the skin
---
I dare you to throw it at a wall
---
please just tell us
---
I had happen to me on Fuze's AK as well.
---
Here's an example: If someone is on a 2 second delay on their actions, both you and the server see the peek 2 seconds late. Wouldn't his bullets ALSO register 2 seconds late from the time he shot it or does the server somehow magically prioritize hit validation above all else?
---
Oh I get it cause you can’t see him on cameras
---
That’s fair
---
so we wanna make castle into a god instead of a operator? castle would probably have more viability than a mira would
---
I feel like Castle's 1st and 3rd change should be there at the start
---
I don’t know
---
Theres a point were you have to give up the meme my friend.
---
Perfection
---
This is an advanced shitpost
---
it seems like something that would be breaking any kind of rules, especially as they are clearly using external tools to get around the afk kick
---
Well not blocking them is counterproductive.
---
Make the LORD'S helmet give him a second chance against a headshot.
---
What if like iq could see people wearing the glasses and thatcher could disable the glasses for a bit
---
I mean Kanto when ENCE won I think it was a season finale or SI
---
I dare argument Caveira’s ability *isn’t* Silent Step; but that she has a full kit. Interrogations being the core of it, then all tools to get interrogations going, silent step, not being able to be properly tracked, and a special pistol that forces injure state.
---
Vigil and Alibi are super dissapointing to me, compared to the better gadgets on defense theirs are basically useless and they’re on the map cause they are 3 speeds with impacts and a non-shit gun.
---
You could take away silent step from caveira and she’d still have unique features. Any way you look at it I think one-button gadgets are plain boring and lazy, whether they are global or not, overpowered or underpowered; I wanna see actual “stuff” be “deployed” if possible.
---
There's Mozzie and Mute, plus shooting drones.
---
There's no need for another thing to stop drones. Plus this hurts Echo and Mozzie drones, and of course takes out most of the risk of placing breach charges onto Castle barricades.
---
#Heilige Scheiße
---
Cav's M12 and Fuze's AK are currently glitched. They will probably be fixed soon.
---
If you watch pro league streams instead of going to the event you are a certified casual.
---
Just give the lord 5 speed on his turret and everything will be fine
---
I can get an ace with clash but that doesn't mean shes a good operator.
---
It’s just a common sound glitch it’s been happening since the beginning of this operation
---
Actually no ô\_õ
---
I did reply in another comment, that suggested not blocking drones whilst still be electrifiable, that it would be a nice buff for Castle and Kaid but not impact Bandit aa much so yea, I agree it would still be a good idea, especially if enemy drones that pass under were destroyed (but not Mozzie or Yokai Drones).
---
Implying you are there?
---
Yes cause her and I can’t remember who use the same gun
---
Rook stole Doc's kill
---
It only worked cuz they didnt even see U
---
POPINCAPS28 if you're ever down to play (I cant right now I'm suck lmao)
---
Haha, Recruit is so funny, just like Tachanka...amirite fellas?
---
I played her and it only shot one
---
if you mean the six charms for watching the majors this weekend they will not be given until the 20th actually
---
Ight
---
[removed]
---
I thought this was real and too good to be true until I read the caption
---
Lol. My reaction the too
---
Yes yes I agree with you
---
***But don't you dare slander the p90***
---
~w~ I dont know what you're referring to
---
Castle needs a deployable shield again
---
The warden buff would be so stupidly OP. Fuck no.
---
Virgin MP5 spawnpeeker vs chad Magnum spawnpeeker
---
Why does she keep losing her impacts
---
Make warden a 2-2 and give him a slightly higher damage gun and it’s balanced
---
True
---
Castles problem is that he works great at high level, he’s perfectly balanced, but low rank players understandably suck at him, he requires map knowledge and effective communication, it’s not their fault their bad at him, he’s just an odd combination where he is at first low skill, but as you progress can become extremely effective. The devs have discussed this publicly afaik. Warden would be completely busted, just give the man a P90 and buff the smoke vision, and boom he’s useful. I’m down with Tachanka tho
---
You didnt even mention a stronger glass for tachanka? 3 glaz shots and it's gone
---
Same, I didn't look at the subreddit and scanning down the image it totally programmed my expectations of what was being held.
---
I don't know man, it's really nice and fits his character well. It's like the IQ elite skin, people didn't like it when it came out, but a couple of months down the line it'll be super popular.
---
Ironic how his name is YouDidNothingWrong
---
I dont usually but 🤷‍♂️
---
But when mixed it turns into a gas until it essentially “evaporates” away from the chemical change.
---
I actually like this aspect as it negates smoke plants on bomb sites. Like comment above mentioned you give up a jäger mira or cab for the warden and counter smoke plants in garage.
---
yup
---
They said it was designed for tanks
---
Good spawnpeekers are actual cancer
---
Known about this for months. 
---
It’s a really useful spot especially since that site favours Defence.
---
Here's a better idea: Group AFK fucksticks like you together, so you retards can suffer from your own bullshit.
---
What the fuck is wrong with you dumb fucks? Daddy hit and choke mommy one too many times while she was pregnant with you? Stop going AFK or stop playing.
---
always nice to see mechanics just ripped from the game FeelsGoodMan
---
I got friends on Xbox but not on pc
---
Generally The French operators are used the most for spawnpeaks because of their guns
---
Welp, that was easy
---
You just have to live with it, I get called a beaner every now and then and it’s pretty fucked up unfortunately
---
i i i i
---
Carne Thermite is horrifying
---
You know it’s a completely random shot when you’re watching the replay and they stand still for a bit right after they shoot you.
---
This is a really good idea I like it
---
JuSt MaKe A bUg FrEe GaMe
---
But how loud would it be
---
I see no problem here
---
Are there even higher capacity DP-28 mags irl?
---
Wait, why does he even have a DP-28? Give him a damn PKP Pecheneg!
---
Shut up noob get good and you’d appreciate the nuances of the good sights
---
I would love everything but Warden as much as I love bringing up the "Rollie" it takes to much effort to not just use him as a recruit with weapon attachments. So just making the glasses a passive with a debuff would be a  lot more fair then passing them out Lardex style.
---
That's really cool. You should make Kaid's electro claw!
---
I deleted this comment because I wanted to
---
Yeah, but his mom might need to tell him for the 10th time that his tendies are getting cold.
---
All I'm saying is that people that do aggressive things are feeling freaking all right while normal people being banned from using words of their language. I don't see how is this a scheme that will fix toxicity. 
---
The closer it gets to Overwatch the less I want to play. Overwatch is absolutely fantastic game but the community ruined it to the point I don't wanna play. I supported Rainbow 6 Siege from alpha and I am really disappointed how the game goes.
---
One wannabe plague doctor I got for Halloween looks much better and it was only 50k renown
---
Maybe if they fix his penis nose.
---
I do a lot of work with small electronics I could help guide you through installing a rotating camera in it, DM me

Is this problem only on PC, or console too?
---
Congrats at ping abusing man!

We don’t judge, if you have a squeaky voice just don’t scream lol
---
Interesting. Perhaps it could have a just-barely visible laser like Kapkan’s, but vertical, and combined with Frost’s gadget it’d down them and leave their team with little way to revive them before the defending team finishes the downed person off. I would like to see that added to the game.
---
I don’t know what to say man 😐
---
That’s what I want to know
---
They took it out of the game so people can’t do it and the community is less toxic until the problem is fixed. They were smart to do that
---
Yes. Look for the Cross pattern on a wall
---
Asserting Dominance
---
Dont you ever take my pan magazine away from me turret. I will hunt you down until my last breath to retrieve it.
---
In all seriousness though, unless they made the turret faceplate unbreakable, it still wouldn't even be remotely viable in proleague, even buffed like this. 360 degree yoration would aso dramatically increase the required deployment radius.
---
Warden OP, castle sounds amazing, maybe the window could be similar to a mira window, chanka eh idk if that would really help him
---
Hope this get fixed asap , thanks for the quick action made this time !
---
What is the glitch?

The part of the barricade that goes under the window. Whichever side its on is the side the barricade was placed.

I don't know if anyone has thought about this but what if ubi gave warden either smokes or flashes instead of impacts and barbed wire

So who's gonna tell him?

There are smaller electronics that I could use, plus these are intended for cons - so a Pi might not fit well in a cosplayer's jacket/harness, etc.
---
There was a project by somebody who created a timelapse camera the size of a strawberry. I'm looking into the electronics inside that.
---
Actually they probably can, many of the new "recycled" guns have different textures and animations, which means they are either a completely different gun coding wise, or that they added the ability for them to change certain aspects of these weapons, and that would probably include actual stats.
---
Best thing to do with frost is out them in the most random least obvious spots. You expect a frost mat at the top of stairs and under windows, you don’t expect it in behind the one useless kiosk

Im not sure if you were a day 1 player or not but when it was announced that all 2 and 3 speeds would lose acogs it shifted the gameplay massively and that’s how the Mets changed alongside these ops coming out but the fact that they’re giving a 2 speed an acog even though the gun isn’t that great it shows they aren’t even sticking to their own philosophy and they’ll probably do it again but with a better weapon. There’s leaks of the next season that their will be an op that’s the “next” Jager. How much you wanna bet he’ll be a 3 speed acog
---

He probably had too many stim shots.

p12 &lt;literally any AR in the game
---
u/ItsHavoc_ posted a link to a picture. I suck with links, but I'll try and find it
---
That could be the case, but it wouldn't really explain how they have different textures as well.
---
Plus they could just program it in a way that ties a specific damage model and attachments to a certain operator, or have multiple damage models that are only enabled when used when the weapon is used by a certain operator. Again, everything is possible.
---
It’s cobalt
---
Look at his operator card, his nose looks like a penis.
---
You're being naive and missing the point 
---
If no one is on site, and you know that because you droned, hot breaching makes more sense than breaking the barricade because that takes longer and alerts your position just as much as a hot breach to the trained ear. That gives them time to make their way back.
---
If you can land your shots and you know where they're going to rotate from you can easily prefire while rotating. You also have to consider the aforementioned aggressive roamers being distracted by other team mates

Personally K/D doesn’t matter to me.

I played Ranked when I started and sucked. I dropped maybe an assist or a kill if I got lucky in Copper 4 but died literally every single round.

Now that I’m better at the game I can drop 14 kills and 4 or 5 deaths and my K/D still doesn’t change much because of long I was shit at the game.

You could if it is already broken

Sunday after it’s over I think
---
Dude YOU are missing the point. If you hot breach, that's it, full body exposure in a room. And if it has multiple entry points you'll probably just die. Breaking the window may alert the other team but you can literally just stick a few pixels of your face at the corner of the window. Why do you think pros hold such tiny angles? Players at the top tier of skill never hot breach because it's stupid, risky, and offers you no benefit unless you play secure area all the time which is a joke.
---
Downvote because toxic player
---
I think it's probably more about money, they are a company after all

[Interro](https://liquipedia.net/rainbowsix/Interro). He's a former CoD pro who's casting R6 and we love him very much.

Hot breaching is where you blow a breach charge as you're rappelling into a room?
---
Don't you think that's specious reasoning?
---
Ok, thank you very much.
---
Correct

I think it’d be better off as a headgear and uniform bundle because it doesn’t have any connection to Smoke’s story.

Tachankas shield corners should be unbreakable you have to shoot the center of the shield to break it so people can't just pixel the big flaps and break them

Abilities are now complete shit and the new ops only get recycled weapons.

yeah there should be like a cooldown on it or like a maximum number of uses per team

The decision to reuse weapons is going to backfire in the long run. At some point they're going to give an OP a weapon/gadget combo that is too weak/strong and try to balance it by changing weapon stats. But that will screw up another OP who has the same weapon, since Ubi stated they cannot actually separate weapons from each other (Which is why Tachanka never got ACOG).
---
As for the choices themselves; SMG-11 is strong for a potential 3 spd, but the G8 has abysmal ADS speed and the Supernova is the worst shotgun in the game. Very counter intuitive.  
---
ACOG DMR on Defense? Really? Remember when I said they'd run into conflicts in the future? Future is now I guess.
---
Overall, interested to see the Attacker in action, Defender sounds idiotic in paper (Stupid good).
---
Tachanka: active ability that temporarily increases LMG ads time and fire rate.
---
Warden: either make him a two speed or give him an acog. His ability isn't that bad
---
Castle: your idea is very interesting
---
thats the chibi proportions my man
---
So you're ok if they keep adding the mpx over and over .
---
Was this on ps4 today?
---
That’s the Nomad hat from Ghost Recon:Wildlands. I’m pretty sure it’s in a bundle for Buck
---
They did

Hello BenderDisorder, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/crgiis/has_anyone_been_getting_a_glitch_where_you_cant/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So does the vector has an acog exclusive to him or can mira also use it?
---
iFunny gang
---
me crying because i miss the old map :’(
---
I met someone through apex
---
Is it squishable like in game or is it full hard plastic?
---
Maestro is a good anchoring defender with a lot of utility, and Nomad is a good attacker for both the rushing playstyle and the patient playstyle
---
Unless your new philosophy involves basically elimination everything that goes down in copper, all I have to ask is why even bother anymore? Why do you just turn a blind eye to literally all the goings on down there? Is it really just because its a minority? Honestly do you have any idea how frustrating it is when you cant even go 2 matches IN A ROW without either a team kill or someone leaving?
---
You hit the 1% of non toxic players my friend
---
1- does the attacker has "grappling points" with her device, pretty much like the normal grappling device? Or you can aim any point in the ceiling and be rocketed towards that point? how does it work? 
---
2- The gas tank is individual from the shields? can you place the tanks elsewhere? Or does it come in a package of 3? Shields with the gas tank already mounted on them?
---
3- Which weapons do they have?
---
Play with a squad and not randoms. Problem solved. Otherwise report the people that did that to you.
---
Just admit you made an oopsie lmao
---
It’s all cool no ones killing you
---
#MAESTRO STARTED THE FIYAAH
---
The no drone castle thing is terrible, think secure, dome objs u got like two doors for drones to go through blocking those is to op
---
I never accused you of being a smurf. I just mearly stated why ranked is a joke.
---
He means that this game has a really good community
---
The ones Castle and our lord’s need to happen.
---
It’s basically his uniform minus the lab coat when he was a chemist. Check out the elite bios on the website.
---
They need a pack that has no duplicates
---
My name is Jeff
---
They need to remove Chalet from ranked, which I’m guessing they will next season. I would welcome it back with open arms once it gets reworked.
---
Oh yeah a really good community
---
Totally happened to me
---
#OOPA BLYAT
---
He asked what unranked is, and unranked is 2500 mmr, which is Silver 1
---
So no fuze elite
---
Out of all of them,  smoke is my favorite elite skin
---
It’s ridiculous dude
---
Bro yes
---
Definition of barricade
---
transitive verb
---
 : to prevent access to by means of a barricade
---
I asked what the guys rank normally is not what unranked is
---
Ever think about making a hostage killer. sorry, Fuze charge?
---
But can you stick them to walls?
---
Because they are in a party and their average rank between them is similar to the side you're on.
---
Who's the operator on the far left in the orange, is that a new pulse outfit?
---
except for the guys who want to actually win, not just be handed a free "win"
---
Gotta love the perceived emotion in this comment
---
Welcome to the Microwave
---
THERE IS NO EXIT
---
I would say it’s very impractical when switching guns should happen instantly. Same as how folding knives are not preferred as fixed blade.
---
Beautiful play with the Meatball.
---
Idk this made me lmao while eating my wal mart brand pizza hot pocket
---
Man I love maestro, I got him recently and he's by far my favorite op
---
I think if they did it as a proximity mine style smoke it would be ok
---
&gt; got a purple one
---
What kind of god-like rng do you guys have? I just get grey and other grey(is it white?).
---
Imagine Doc fully over-healed with the boost and rook plates. Basically the doom slayer
---
Can this be classified as bullying?
---
To add even more to this, an ADS only takes down 2 projectiles before shutting off.
---
all I can say is. eXcUsE mE wHaT tHE fUcK
---
I did make an oppsie...but honestly I was close
---
I love all of it and think that I've thought of the tachanka rework but my friends said it was stupid
---
Goodbyeeee Jojoooo!
---
I... I have very strong urge to throw it against the wall.
---
Yeah what should we do about it?
---
Kiss?
---
Is that the new update? Mute and lion over here looking like 1 speeds, Montagne looking like a 2 speed, and Tachanka and Mira looking like a .5 speed
---
😘😘
---
repost...
---
When the histage room only has a Mira in it and she doesn't turn around when you breach as Blitz in and one tap the back of her head and ninja the hostage out.
---
Close indeed
---
I’m not so sure about this
---
It’s not about how it looks it’s a statement
---
but his friends call him Jeff the pig
---
200 points is all some people have in life, the fact that absolute strangers kind of approve of something they did because nobody else in their likely solitary life does. Totally going to get downvoted to hell for this, but whatever. Unlike OP I dont need the validation of strangers to feel significant.
---
Do you get watch time for vods?
---
Castle really can't get a rework. He is super situational, but in the right situation, extremely powerful. I would think just allowing it to be electrified would be enough to make him more fun.
---
Of course 3 kills through that ceiling opening
---
Another discussion between a silver 2 and a gold 4, as usually seen in this sub.
---
I'm glad it's that way, 99% of them are shit anyways
---
For warden I’d settle for the gadget activation being near instant
---
Jesus Christ, do...do enjoy playing this game? Since I hit plat I hated this game so much.
---
Now we need a castle elite... PLEASE
---
Kind of cringe
---
yeah dude seems to happen every couple of matches it's crazy.
---
Can I have my Jackal elite now? Pls Ubi?
---
Ela needed 30rnd mag and her old recoil, 3 traps was fine and no impacts was alright but it would be nice to have. I mean lesion has only been touched twice so far and his traps are barely visable, do 10 starting damage and make youre vision blurred if you move around enough.
---
Zofia needed her 2/2 impact conc ratio because her gadget is literally a launcher? I mean ash could technically do the same thing with 3 flashes and 2 breach rounds. 
---
I honestly think people over complained about ela and alot of other things people were just too lazy to deal with or play against. I didnt mind ela in her first release state, i did hate BB tho.
---
I hope they fix horizontal recoil in a game like siege - it has no place. (The uncontrolable type)
---
Jesus...
---
Your not crazy it is switched
---
Im still upset on how unoriginal my man mutes skin is.
---
Then shoots you &gt;&gt; every Mira in games I play
---
Because they are running out of ideas and weapons/ops
---
So reused content here we go, so old rules dont apply.
---
Remember them boasting 100 ops? Engine wont support it
---
I like how that ash is wearing watch dogs scarf/bandana/buff (idk which one is right)
---
They should make that a special  ability  for a new op
---
Man if only there was some kind of feature that lets an entire community decide the quality of a post...
---
nah, its more like jackal didnt find your tracks or played obj. The goodness of a jackal comes from the mistakes of somebody else and not the person playing him being good.
---
[deleted]
---
Man if only there were some way for the people who don't want to see them in the first place don't have to. Oh wait...
---
The gameplay is bad, everything else is good.
---
Because just like assassins creed, they converted far cry dawn into an rpg which is super annoying given far cry 2 was the most realistic of them all. 
---
It's a looter shooter now, with weapon rarity and all that crap which doesn't belong in a far cry game.
---
The environment is a pure bliss i would say.
---
*ENEMY DETECTED OUTSIDE*
---
Bet!
---
I think the newer looking ones sell better
---
Who do you already have, and what's your playstyle? Do you played ranked, casual? Please provide more info
---
I had a two people I played with during Y1, but we've gone separate ways and haven't talked for years...I miss that, but the good memories and video clips are here. (:
---
**and a dream**
---
That is amazing
---
He’s not any good. Just abandons before losing. For anyone who doesn’t know, if you leave a ranked game you will lose points but it will not affect your win/loss ratio
---
Wouldn’t the light turn off..?
---
I’m about to do whats called a pro gamer move
---
I still think Warden should be able to ping people with his glasses like a drone. Expose yourself to try and scan, you get to ping at a risk and if you don’t want to risk you just use them for the flash/smoke help
---
No more new guns, Kormora the reliable leaker said the engine can't handle much more
---
100% of the players in this match suck. What’s the problem?
---
Ay this ain't me just to clarify. This was an enemy player

Where can I get these? It’s my birthday on the 18th and I might ask my family to order them

Just stick to hot then pleb
---
Pointless 
---
Why do people do this  ?
---
No true evidence of it being ranked

Does that thing actually work?

hello there.

Have a teammate sit on it as well when you switch to second turret.

Just stick to the other sub then pleb

---
I am on PC, I'm copper 1 rn just to get an example of how bad I am
---
Exactly!
---
These are fan made, right? Not legit? Just want to double check because castle would turn into a fantastic operator. Warden could be pretty OP though. I like the idea that was tossed around about it working like a dunks charge
---
Do you need a mic?
---
Or are you talking about the outbreak packs and other events. If that is what you are talking about I 100% agree to make them directly purchasable and not random. Sorry if I misunderstood.
---
RC-XD
---
Well stop reinforcing that wall and you won't get shot.
---
IKR
---
Why did they stop doing old military based skins, all the casual wear while nice, just breaks the tactical theme
---
It says you can’t self promote find another way to grow it like idk DDOS a popular streamer or something
---
I can see the op and this one
---
or Earth Defense Force 5
---
RC-XD inbound
---
I didn't even get a reach around. :(
---
The kills one got me riled up bc i was playing caveira and interrogating the enemy then I get tkd i message the guy why and he said"i wanted kill" like really does he think we are playing cod or something?
---
Razer Kraken Pro V2
---
Our team was in a bikini bodhi vid, he RQ'ed after me and my friend denied his blitz rush.
---
He still did upload the clip in a compilation as it still was a nice 3k.
---
Why (but the last one) is this isolated to console players only? 🤔
---
Life hack put motherfucking bags of ice in your fur suit during the summer so you won’t die XD
---
A good read and a justified reason. Sucks but as long as they put the time and effort saved into a new feature, all is good.
---
*Fix bayonet*
---
Thas the bibble
---
They need to bring back auto scan during droning phase.
---
To earn his first badge he needs to get a 3k with fuze and also fuze the hostage
---
No
---
I got hyperx cloud alphas, never failed me in the 2 years I've owned them! 
---
They are like 80 quid though but seriously worth it.

Here’s a tip... just don’t join an ongoing match
---
K  N I F E THE WATERMELON
---
u mean next year ?
---
Wow, thank you, you know the elite?
---
They’d rather me ddos then self promote? That’s so stupid
---
I would have uninstalled the game
---
What I dislike about this game in general are the people in casual that will scrutinize and hate on your every move, no matter what you do. It’s not the biggest problem but man it does get annoying, sometimes it feels like they think they’re in pro league and not casual.
---
I think chanka just needs an entirely new power. With your changes he still has the same major weakness of mobility.
---
Honestly I have wanted an operator who can use their drones as breaching charges. Open up ceiling holes before the game even starts to prevent people from reinforcing them(if you are fast enough)
---
How?
---
So this is how were preparing for Brexit
---
thank god you don’t play stretched
---
Hey let's give the devs some props last time it took then basically over a month to just remove the bugs from the game, there's always worse and better, sometimes you need to stop looking for the worse and appreciate the better
---
The quick setup on any cover/vaultable object is a good idea. Kinda like old school day of defeat machine gunners.
---
Server hoppers like you belong on a cross
---
Except you can. As long as all of your unlocked ops are taken, it'll give you recruit.
---
But cause there are many advantages to a keyboard apparently?
---
One of these ops is not like the others.
---
Suicidal drone, hehe that'll never get old
---
Imagine holding an angle, then you hear *sucking noises* and you turn around, seeing a robot slowly rolling to you blowing up XD
---
Calling Michael Reeves.
---
What is auto scan?
---
I think some double sided tape might work
---
Overall I'd recommend buying a Logitech G headset, they have a great audio and very good mic quality

You cant copyright an idea thats already been created noob.
---
I think OP said that his teammate challenged her, which is why she didn’t stop to shoot the cams, and didn’t turn around and leave
---
Hello there
---
An excellent clip and even better title. I salute you sir
---
Thought this was a highly detailed action figure holy hell!
---
what was that? what did u just do?!
---
Hahaha. Yeah I mean on one hand I’m glad for any excuse not to dump more money down the drain. On the other hand I really do like dressing up these guys. I mean also like I said I think some of the original costumes look a little ugly, so I’m actively looking for new costumes (but the only Elite I’ve bought is for Jager). I mean I think every one of the costumes can be criticized.
---
Its ok. He wont have paid money to copyright it.,
---
2 things.
---
1 I'm not arguing with a brick wall on reddit
---
2 *you're
---
Have a good night ✌
---
Pls send me user that has made the same request and we can start this properply
---
About Tachanka from my perspective :
---
1. he would be OP and would be instant death if you came infront of him if you could attach the turret to the shield
---
2. it would defeat the purpose of his bio if he had a historical LMG that would feed of ammo boxes like Maestro and Fuze his LMG is from the 1920's and is fed by a magazine not an ammo box 
---
3. the 360 degrees does make sense but would be also deadly if the player was a good flicker and also is kinda useless cuz usually Tachanka would be near a reinforced wall and a reinforced hatch 
---
4. and the nerf when he would put the turret on a deployable shield would still be OP if he was in a good corner
---
About Warden : already it was discussed but he would be a must pick just like Jager is because everyone would be almost 100% immune to Blitz , Ying , and op's with Flashes . The good buff would be to be a 2 speed 2 armor and he would be better (for me at least) if he had one secondary (his pistol) and had three primaries (idk which primaries but just like the german operators it would be nice) 
---
About Castle : everything good boi but he would also be a must pick and kaid with him cuz then they can eliminate : Breach charges , Thermite charges , Hibana's Fidget spinners , fuze's cluster charges , twitch entering the room or any drone entering the room because of the barricade goes all the way down and then mozzie and mute can just camp drones on the little holes made for drones which means the attackers can always only guess where exactly the objective is.  And also the 1 way slit will also make Castle must pick because then Pulse , Jager , Bandit , Valkyrie , Doc , Rook , basically every OP and Castle himself can spawnpeek without having to worry about counters like a bullet to the face from an attacker they didn't notice or something like that.
---
So Rework concept for the specified OP's : Nice ... But would it work in Reality ? no . Why? well because it will make the attacking side lose a massive part of their chance to win every round because it's like YES we are Defenders and then you're attacking and you get spawn peeked by idk Jager or Bandit just because you couldn't fire back cause of the Castles barricade... These are my thought in this concept and don't take it personally everyone knows about tachanka meme and everyone wants to buff tachanka in a way no one tried before but the most balanced thing FOR NOW is to leave him untouched and just give lil' reworks to damage on his LMG from keeping Ubisoft from reworking him COMPLETELY and literally losing the meme he was and he will stay
---
So whats the song again?
---
I need your copyright Receipt please
---
Original op ideas are very rarely good. thank you for keeping up with the rest of the crowd and posting this garbage /u/op
---
Even if it was just 25-50% (for wardens thing) it would be a little better I think.
---
Definitely!
---
I am sorry I didn't saw the gun leaks what gun do the have?
---
No this is the new attacker in the background it's Mira's elite, I'm hoping Buck, Echo, Jackal and Caveira get one.
---

wow being a grammar nazi is somehow cool ? i ain’t a brick wall bud you just can’t come up with another argument and that’s facts so whatever my original argument is still valid because all this shit was happening back when Chimera came out and the added a whole fucking campaign and new ops with new guns but whatever buddy

How do they apply to console only lmao
---
My first black ice was thermite and I got it pretty early on
---
Indeed
---
XD
---
I'd rather them just quietly and quickly fix it instead of take out an entire mechanic from the game so that (let's be honest) they can just push it off for a couple days instead of actually working on it.

Man I don’t know, ask op I guess?

Idk when I play casual usually most people pick up their plates
---
Dokkaebi tryna' slide in his dm's
---
ackshually a lot of people got refunds for both No Man's Sky AND Anthem. NMS actually had an extended refund window from steam and Anthem had to refund people who got the game on PS4 and then it just straight up did not work on the console for some reason. a coworker of mine had that issue and had to get their money back.
---
The folks in the game wanted me to upload this, so here it is. Fun ranked game with fun people on both teams!
---
Also, here's my Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/relaxfuzzgun
---
Someone in one of my games was asking for it.
---
Yeah your right I hadn't really looked at the art work for ember rise. Who knows.. all I know is that they need to start doing more skins for the operators.. I hate seeing when they just add camo to the same skin
---
Reused weapons but hey, at least they're decent to somewhat good weapons
---
I meant it's a glitch, a friend of mine rejoined and he got recruit, even though he has all ops unlocked
---
No that's right. Remember you are upside down.
---
It was a joke
---
It shoots slugs so it's a dmr. You shoot it long range
---
It's just annoying that's why people don't like her, it's hrlla annoying to try to get somewhere if she is standing next to you cuz you know she has the fastest weapon swap in the game
---
Yes she does
---
Oh, shut up.
---
you’re just an angry fella aren’t ya lol he clearly missed. that’s why everyone in this thread is telling you that
---
All though I'm not opposed to this even tho I don't play Frost is that there is an audio queue for when they go off. If they were to give a icon above Frost than they would have to do the same thing for Ela's Girzmots and Kapkan's EDDs. The only reason they did this for lesion I believe is for two reasons I believe.
---
1. They are invisible 
---
2. He has 8 of them that can be played on the field
---
hopefully castle's elite skin is dark colours, because the rest of his outfits are just, 'sorry? you WANTED to be shot in the head? oh, okay.'
---
Cav is really fun when you pull of an interrogation in casual. In ranked shes a popular ban but not guaranteed 100% as depending on the map, I see more echo, and clash bans.
---
Needs a team. Else, useless.
---
....no she doesn’t. she’s fine as is.
---
Wait.
---
I'll be honest, I've been playing since launched and I didn't know this
---
Flashback to E3 2015 when that woman (who since left Ubi to work for Mobile Gaming poker Zynga) took to the stage to exclaim: TerroHunt is back....with the most advanced AI in a Rainbow Six game"....Vegas 2 had better AI luv
---
i would've liked to see the icon of your character more than mozzie's his is just kinda meh while yours is off the roof and the design between them is really close but reaper is a bit over the top for a name so a lil bit more friendly and i would giv it a go like this nah but the best is the combination : introducing Rozzie
---
Because it's fun? Do you know that concept?

Better have data to back your claim.
---
Love everything about this! Total respect for your clear layout and thinking
---
They're bear traps. They're as loud as my neighbours having fun in bed at night. Sound Intel should tell you which trap has been set off or shot. You don't need to know the position of something that is extremely obvious.
---
Maybe. There's just no way he can be an unneeded glaz atleast.
---
It removes flashbangs too mind you, so he already has something that glaz doesn't there.
---
Like I said they should probably try changing his speed first, then his guns. The glasses would probably need a rework because there isn't much space between boring and busted on em.
---
Definitely not.
---
The current one is miles ahead.

Hello IndividualSOULS, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/crjhup/in_game_menu_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Clip it and report them. Idk but throwing probably isn’t a “bannable” offense. :p
---
No the exact hours are kind of a mystery. And it has to be live, dont think the reruns count
---
Not particually. Her traps just got made weaker and only has 3 of them. There's no reason to pick her over any of the other trap operators.
---
Ordered it for next tue, asked to see if Its essential to upgrade my monitor. Was watching some reviews and it gets around 160fps on ultra

Now throw it at the wall. I dare you

Salad fingers

The R&amp;D Team of six being genius inventors

Jäger developing a working miniturized version of an ADS

And Bandit brings a frickin car battery(which shouldn't even work the way it does but whatever)

Like there are 2/3 Operators using war crimes as gadgets and then there are Bandit and Sledge

Just an odd color for a background than

I’d still rather have to deal with hot breaching being disabled and play on pc.

Idk if it still works, but if you boot the game up while offline, you have access to all the ops in local customs
---
Ty m8
---
You make a good point, he won't have access to the more exploitable weapons. I don't know what weapons are in that category, so I'll leave that hypothetical to those that do
---
Cant watch on yt dont know why, but still ty.

I don't understand why they need to recycle weapons, can you please explain? Because for me it just seems like they are just cutting back development of Siege

Yeah, could be true.

nothing but they won't add another french team but the gadgets are goods... and hello fellow zofia main

Since the ops using it have better choices, there isn't much reasons to use it
---
low key
---
 "Pros: a lot less development time  with balancing , making skins, making the model" 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The only one of those points that holds up is the tie to balance, because they seem to have PLENTY of dev time to constantly be making new skins and head gear they can sell as a micro transactions.
---
yay :)
---
While I agree that its busted. They did say they wanted warden to compete with Jager, who is arguably in that the position of you always benefit from having him. And you still have to stand still.
---
How did you make this
---
May the Lord give you an ACOG
---
You realize everyone is going to think this is a joke about vigil being invisible, and not see the tiny blurry roach in the box, right?! Haha

WTF?!
---
Just mean I am NEVER buying a season pass for R6 ever again, and I will have less interest in each new season.
---
Makes you wonder why the defenders don't just chuck the defuser out of the window.
---
Ok
---
This game is such a shitshow and i bet they take at least a months to fix this crap, instead of rolling out a hotfix ...
---
Welcome to Siege.
---
oh damn
---
I'm gonna be honest with you. I haven't probably played r6s since mid july, cus every time I tried to play with friends recently, I rage quit. Even if I decided to launch r6s, I would only play lone wolf THunt. I don't even want to go near the multiplayer tab. I uninstalled the game, but I decided to install it again, "just in case" I want to play again. I started playing other games I didn't get the chance to play (Max Payne,Postal 2 etc, mostly single player games).  So, I can't say anything more than "I agree with you, same shit happens to me".
---
This game is taking a weird direction, which makes me doubt its "supposed" life span. The recent ops we got are purely recycled and, most of the time, useless (from their guns, especially since the guns they were given are not meant for them, to their gadgets), ddosing problems on console, mouse and keyboard problems on console, cheats on pc and the list goes on (I'm a PC player). It's not my first time I'm facing problems with siege during summertime, though. I faced cheats during Op Health, para bellum and phantom sight. Summer, for me, is officially one of the worst seasons of the year to play r6s. Honestly, I wish we had op health 2.0, instead of this shit.
---
Pro tip: Fanboys of this game (especially the ones who are in r6s subreddits) think the game is perfect (despite of it literally being broken). They don't care about the game's stability (especially the new ones). Fanboys, fanboys never change.
---
What bothers me is after the recent lean change the whole spam isn’t as effective unless it’s combined with the crouch spam too.
---
language checks out
---
furry smoke
---
i really think you are stupid, they are referring to the hammer and scalpel short movie about/with thatcher
---
Yeah but Siege uses the most shitty game engine called Anvil that was made for single player games and first used for Assassin's Creed 1 in 2007 lol. It's ridiculous.
---
i only just started playing casual more and it’s so much more infuriating than ranked
---
Well my bad. Never heared of that before
---
That was not a meme till it was released. 
---
The theme was april fools, hence why the branched out and made them all pink. Does no one bother to think about these things before irrational unnecessary complaining?
---
I’ve wanted to say that the players that stay should get modded points. Such as, if ya lose, y’dont lose so many pints and if ya win while a guy down ya get more but I feel like people would game the system.
---
You can't see Vigil in the box because he Is using his ability and that's a photo. But you can still see his team mate
---
What is the meaning of this? Please explain. The mods don't like sketchy stuff...
---
Almost 2000 hours but if you think I have to play more, I will.
---
Roaming to the other side of kanal is usually worth the kills you get from all the windows and runouts.
---
Clubhouse had its unique 2-building top floor gameplay removed, and the basement became too easy to attack. It also lost the bar with the elevated pool position.
---
Chalet is perfectly fine the way it is.
---
I know it’s bad to say but I want to derail into copper/bronze so badly. The charm looks better in the red-brown colors imo. I won’t do it but god do I want to.
---
it has me wonder what engine they use for rainbow 6 quarantine because if it's the same one I bet there's only gonna be 3 or 4 playable operators in 2020.
---
I really wanted the Tar-21 and the Galil in siege but that dream is fucking shattered.
---
Wait till u get to rank and wish u can vote to kick
---
Maybe they are the spare ones that she can use if she is downed
---
do you know what a fucking joke is
---
Does its EMP also disables the red dot/ reflex/ holo sights as well? Or I may be expriencing a bug.
---
Whatever gets you off, dude :)
---
No One in the media was allowed to say nothing till the release date of the tts so idrk, we only have to wait and hope.
---
They just got outplayed
---
The devs are struggling with the game engine and I think they are having trouble with licensing new weapons. If they add the g36 to Nøkk's loadout and any weapon with acog to Warden(plus some tweaks to his gadget) they should become more viable imo.
---
The game keeps growing though, I'd rather have them reuse good weapons than add guns that are mediocre like finka's or nomads, besides we just got gridlock/mozzie who both have great guns, I feel like the most important part of an op is their ability, the problem with phantom sight isn't the fact that they reused weapons, it's the fact that they reused bad guns
---
Google is also here for asking questions.
---
It’s like my 6yo jumped on to play
---
Not to be a pessimist, but it could simply be that they want to save on development time. Not having to design and balance a number of new guns surely saves time and money.
---
You could capture this with one drone . but still amazing and i love it
---
And they are some of the best once
---
This idea sucks. Only realistic change I can see for Clash is to limit the spamming of her electronic shield in some way
---
His glasses work on CD, Glaz can use his at all times, off site, with a busted rifle from meters away. He could also just rush the point and incur no reduction in utility cause his gun pops tf off, unlike Warden who has a weak ass gun for a 1 speed op.
---
Now you have to actually use him like a sniper a bit, but he still sucks this way because you have to be still. But he at least has an incredible weapon and some decent movement. 
---
Warden just sucks.
---
Type in AsH compound. It isn't rocket science.
---
Isnt R6 Quarantine kind of a sequel?
---
Mp5sd does more damage than normal mp5 dawg. Has a faster ads too.
---
Castle already got his lol
---
Yea but it's co-op only. We don't have much info on it other than a CGI trailer. For all we know, it could be using the same engine as Siege.
---
Tachanka is gonna have multiple arms, all holding vintage firearms while ‘holy music’ plays in the background.
---
I'm afraid the G36 would make her a bit too OP
---
1. data limits
---
2. reworks (if they are good) = better than a new map
---
No new guns AGAIN. Really UBI?
---
Hello KryXus05, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/crla55/black_mirror_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Wait... 
---
Your a defender
---
Aight. Id say prolly no unless you ve got previous experience with shooters. RB6 is quite unique and requires knowledge of maps, opps, sounds, lines if sight and strats.
---
I hope you have fun with it :)
---
While the Chemical substance is toxic, it is (according to a chemistry website) a powder and not yellow, so the canister would need to include some kind of dispensing system. While Arsole changes color under pressure it would change its color back once the pressure is released.
---
#LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
I'm not saying it will never be possible, but they would have to rework a system that the game has been using since day 1.  
---
The potential to fuck the entire game up due to spaghetti code is stupid high, and I personally don't think Ubi would dedicate time and resources to a problem they can just ignore.  
---
Another (albeit minor) thing that'll prevent that from ever happening; If they ever actually fix the issue or make a work around, they would have no excuse to keep ACOG of Tachanka, and they refuse actually address or work on improving him.
---
To top it off, Ubi continually nerfs Frost, despite her being one of the worst ops in the game. So their judgment is wack and no way to be trusted.
---
get out of here, stalker
---
Damn that sounds cool i wish,no it was like a brown desert kind a one
---
Wait he has a vector? Interesting...
---
Only way to play hereford
---
Aw yes the vecky McWrecky. My favorite
---
You know that it is a 1st person bug right? It doesnt make you silent at all
---
Outback is probably my favorite map after coastline and house
---
It is my favorite also
---
Smoke elite is disgusting
---
First nokk isn’t a sniper second you realize they have to license weapons and that’s kinda of expensive
---
Yeah I like it a lot. Out of some of the new maps we have received from Ubisoft lately, it surely is my favourite one.
---
Exactly, A new game would not be logical in any way, shape, form whatsoever. Which is why we are getting a spinoff
---
It's if you queue up with hackers consistently not just joining one game with them
---
I mean, did you miss the point that I think warden should be buffed too?
---
I'm just saying that the proposed buff I first responded too literally is unnerfed glaz, no-one wants that unless they were completely clueless to how busted it was way back when or if they just started playing after the nerfs.
---
Hello no_fps_no_life, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/crlbud/i_got_permanent_banned_doing_nothing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
1. if no one plays IQ lmg, it is basically a new weapon
---
2. So you want another Ash that is only viable because of the weapon? I rather have an good gadget than a fancy new weapon and both of them don’t have one
---
Yeah the 39 fps is weird considering I usually get between 60-80 frames. The ping can be somewhat traced to the fact that our network is for some reason fucked atm but 40000 ping? Really?
---
I think he just likes walking around with "Asshole" written on his shirt. An inside joke that fits his sense of humour.
---
Have you even used him in actual game play beacuse with all the sounds of people shooting and running around is enough to mask the sound of his torch
---
Why not porting the game on a new engine like League did or like people want in counter strike with source 2?
---
Well you can pay a few hundred thousand to a few million to get the rights for a weapon if so go donate shit to ubi if not stop complaining
---
Haha what a community
---
When you are repelling and you put a breaching charge on a window, it will give you the option to hit breach so the operator pushes off the wall, you blow up the breaching charge, and you  jump through the barricade
---
For coolness
---
Honestly? No, I see it as a convenient way for Ubi to not have to make a weapon skin, that's about on par with their recent decisions.
---
Nothing surprises me
---
I think it because if they change the engine, they'd have to go through too much to make the game compatible with that engine.
---
Yea but ubisoft ain’t going to fix the “digital currency os currently unavailable in your region error” so i cant buy my boi sludge and smonk their elite
---
Boosting is almost always intentional. Like 3 plats and 2 bronze in a squad. That way when the plats carry them against, say, golds, the game registers that as bronzes winning against golds, which is technically true except the bronzes didn't actually contribute. Then their MMR( a way to quantify skill level as numbers) and the golds' MMR is compared, the bronze obviously rank up, end of story
---
Everybody
---
I just watched the video and it was good! I'm probably gonna use some of those. I also subscribed
---
I read somewhere that they said they were running out of guns that didn’t require jumping through loops to get the rights to use. But I know that can’t be true. They use several guns made by sig like the mpx p226 etc. but they have plenty of other guns of different variety like the mcx that they could use. They also have whole manufactures who never have issues with hame siding their guns like IWI who makes some of the most iconic guns like the tavor, galil, msr, Negev and even options for new side arms like the Jericho. Just seems like they have so many more options they ignore
---
Twitch Account email is verified btw
---
Castle is perfect in his current state really the only thing I could imagine for a buff would be giving him a better option than the ump
---
I have too many to recount.
---
He told me he was dying to propose to you
---
Reasons I dont play hostage:
---
- This
---
Lol
---
Good kill nothing less but that's  a fake get flanked
---
thought so
---
If only they could spend so much time fixing all the bugs. And balancing operators.
---
Just the most popular gamemode
---
If Amaru is 3 speed, 1 armour, she could very quickly become the new Ash in terms of annoying attackers played by people who exclusively give a fuck about how many kills they gets. A 3 speed with IQs Aug and a grappling hook would be beyond annoying.
---
I can see many post about Warden lack of utility after the Badger video yesterday
---
Or it's just ubi Dicken around with the players
---
We also see in the cinematics from article 5 that it does build up on the ground as a powder. Without knowing what the color change is to or from it could be that as it is expelled it changes from it pressurized color to the yellow we see.
---
#FOOOOKIN LAZER SITES
---
Heading downtown today to play test I’ll let you know if it’s the same
---
6 months? That's not much.  
---
Spooky-Nukk and Warden-daddy have not disturbed the meta in any significant way yet, and haven't been used in Pro League.
---
Clash is toxic and should have remained banned forever.  
---
Speaking of which, we'll get new deployable shields soon for the defenders.  
---
Solo ranked is still a nightmare 85% of the time.  
---
Other than that... I think not much has changed in the last 6 months. :)
---
Three, each one got an alpha
---
jäger and ela be banned over echo and cav, i would love to see that
---
Kk. I'm not 100% about Zofia and I got caught off guard when a second didn't shoot. Btw it's through the front door all the way to the left in the "community room"
---
Si
---
If they’re getting banned for cheating more than once, they’re going to get banned permanently. Ban length is more severe over time. Always has been. You don’t just get a slap on the wrist for repeatedly cheating. 
---
Even if the ban is temporary, when you get this message they obviously already know who it was and they’re already likely banned. So you could always, you know, use logic or common sense if you get this message and then someone you play with everyday suddenly isn’t there anymore. Also, please tell me what cheats exist that wouldn’t be obvious to an entire team that plays with you and can spectate you upon death. Unless they’re really really bad at the game even *while* cheating, it should be pretty obvious.
---
So if I ever want to a healthy mix of game modes, turn of bomb for a while, turn it back on, then turn it off again when I get fatigued of bomb again. That's a lot of slow ass menu navigating just to get a healthy mix but it's what I'll have to do I guess.
---
One new map and only 2 new guns...
---
Glad I dodged the season pass this time round.
---
Thought it was Blitz that was losing his shield and getting a bulletproof camera. I forgot that Jäger had a shield too.
---
Boy am I excited for that 2-2 w/ Vector
---
TBH did the sledge and thatcher PL skins even get released? I mean they just released Rook's and Ash's one
---
The 9*19vsn is another gum from the same line
---
Your season pass is really a year pass and covers all 4 seasons.
---
Viable point. But don't forget that he can just sit on his merry ass and achor a site too while glaz has to move to get to a site etc. Tons of variables that aren't mentioned.
---
It would still be a horrible meta.
---
Tachonka
---
And he did😂
---
Well Ela is not OP as she used to be
---
can we get deployable shields on attack?
---
Yes
---
Thanks that's good to know that one of the worst operators has become someone that should have stayed banned. Also , when was clash banned?
---
It’s judging you for dying so early
---
Did they though?
---
Who looked at Warden and was excited for that?
---
&gt; ...to get the rights to new guns
---
We have AR33(which in fact is G3). They still added an unlicensed gun, so, what’s the problem?
---
It's more of a licensing issue, since Ubisoft has to buy and balance any new gun they obtain. They said this during operation phantom sight that the lack of new guns was due to the difficulty caused by constantly having to find and license new guns.
---
Same old siege then.
---
So basically Smoke is a fucking school shooter with gas cans as his "Extra equipment"
---
Wait how did she get there? Was she following you? I'm still not seeing how she gets there.
---
For me the good matches make up for the BS toxicity.
---
Hot breach's got removed last night (Temporarily) Hopefully they fixed shield glitching for good after clash and deployable shields were removed for a couple of months. Glaz got nerfed to only be able to see through smoke when standing still. Nokk and warden were added, warden can ignore flashbangs and see through smokes whilst standing still with his ability active. Nokk gets cavs silent step and vigils cloak as an attacking op and both are a bit boring in my opinion as their gadgets are quite situational and warden is defiantly an op who nobody plays for the weapons (Mpx/M590A1,SMG12/P-10c).
---
What if he colors it for his teammates to see it. Because the idea is to throw the babes at the enemies not fill a hallway and hope they walk into it.
---
Gib Nøkk Jäger gun plz.
---
If you shot Glaz in the head he would have been downed regardless of the damage nerf. You must have shot him in the neck or missed. If you have the replay I can go frame by frame to show you.
---
Have you rebooted the system?  
---
Have you tried verify game files from Uplay?  
---
Have you checked CrystalDiskMark and checked that your disk speeds are normal?  
---
With proper SSD speeds \~500MB/s your load times should be almost instant.
---
I killed the first guy earlier in the round but it’s not a part of the clip
---
Now I want some fries but not fried chicken
---
Damn
---
Wait didn’t they state somewhere that they don’t want recoil patterns like Counter Strike does? So every pattern is random ish
---
Arsol can also be called Arsenole, and  arsacyclopentadiene.
---
Thats some silver level camp spot
---
Hello LIXLAX12! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
Is there no way to disable it for console while it's fixed?
---
I do believe for your profile and charm it takes the highest but for the soft mmr reset it takes what you have at the end of the season. So you might see a lot of throwers at the end of the season because they want to be at copper in the new one.
---
I have, about 3 or 4 times, if I remember correctly. The most common way to get out to the roof is to hop out the window to the big atrium, which I have done myself, and run up the steps to the roof. From there, you usually go to a small tower. This all takes so much time that you can see it, prepare for it, counter it or just simply avoid it. Fortress has other issues that should be addressed, but spawnpeeking is not one of them imo
---
Then just turn off bomb
---
You mean there are different devs for (example) environmental design in Watch Dogs Legion and Rainbow Six. (who would've guessed /s)
---
You are rare then, most wouldnt want to have either of those as primaries. I know the g8 is way to slow ads time for me to play with it but hey better than nokk, but id never go anywhere near the supernova.
---
I believe it's a problem with my monitor
---
“What’s in the canister? If I told you (you’d make a stupid joke that I’ve definitely heard before and it’d drive me crazy and) I’d have to kill you.”
---
While the gun aspect of Nokk is underwhelming, giving her a better gun fixes only small flaw about her because in the end her actual problem rises from her gadget which is barely better than 3 Speed Attackers crouch walking around. 
---
The majority of the cams are taken down by as fast as possible by the other Attackers in order to rotate around constantly. This often leaves Nokk with her quiet step but by then 3 Speed operators can do the job of being sneaky while still having much stronger gun and utility. 
---
If Nokk only gets a stronger gun, she's still a 2 Speed with no utility. IQ running around taking out hidden cams/drones/gu mines before crouch walking into obj will be far more threatening overall than Nokk will be even if she has much stronger gun. 
---
I'm hoping that Ubi actually buff her stealth first before giving her a gun benefit (different gun or maybe a slight buff to FMG?) since she will still be a waste of pick when Ash has that close to mid range combat role filled. 
---
That being said, I absolutely love MCX Rattler. Smaller than Honeybadger while also firing .300 BLK rounds.
---
Lvl 197. 1.9 w/l 1.5 k/d definitely not a lack of aim.
---
I 100% agree with you there. Hopefully since Goyo is a 2-2 (from leaks) with the same Vector as Lion that should work out better than Warden did.
---
Looks pretty good
---
May have been the wrong comment string, but my argument still stands, that they could (for some time only if needed) push ressources between games if it is severe!
---
the amount of times i have gotten a kill from 25 meters away with the nova is so fulfilling, it acts the same way in CS:GO. anyway this is looking like the best season this year
---
Oh yeah man, I love the fact that we can customize too. Kind of like a first person shooter rpg haha. I'm glad we've come to an understanding lol. All said and done, siege is definitely one of my favorite games ever!
---
oh yes, thanks
---
Yeah they nerfed it to about 63 or so damage, but they also increased it’s effective range. You probably got some shitty net code or something like that. It’s still a beastly pistol
---
Its not severe though, the assassins creed team can't just suddenly abandon a likely successful game for a while because of some bugs in a different game this should be obvious my guy a new game makes more usually than an old one
---
No new guns? Not buying the next season pass.
---
It's like the best gun on defense. Why not?
---
Oh so you're a big strong man? Like I said anyone can say whatever they want behind a keyboard. And I'm sure you've achieved so much. You've probably had it hard in the deserts of Afghanistan. If not you must have had it hard living in the poverty and slums of the ghetto. But you are such an amazing person. This attitude will definitely get you far in life. It's best to worry about yourself then help out a fellow human being. Which is most like why you are copper 5. Since you have no idea what Cooperation or teamwork is.
---
3. Smoke doesn't say what's inside the canister because gas weapon are banned from the Geneva protocol, so he is using weapon banned and since he is SAS he is committing a war crime.
---
That gun is Lion's AR
---
New weapons add so much character to the new operators. Old weapons don't do much.
---
no
---
To be fair, the G8 might have people's mind changed since the G8 is rarely ever seen from being used by IQ.
---
That 2-Speed 2-Armor Defender having the TCSG-12 may be a bit off, since 1-Speed 3-Armor Defenders (except Mira, along with Kaid's AUG-A3, as far as I know) usually get to have ACOGs on Defence.
---
Finally
---
Thats obviously not what I meant...I know that devs are not magic machines that can reorganize their entire workplace just to work for this weekend on that bug they have absolutely **no** knowledge about. But Ubisoft surely has enough employees to at leats have jumper devs that are not fixed in any franchise
---
thanks!
---
He tked then left the round
---
What happened in the beta?
---
Maybe he didn’t want people knowing like arsole might just be a part of the substance  that is inside
---
Ain’t it also going against the Geneva conventions or something
---
No, no company has jumper Devs, that's a terrible idea, that's not how it works at all people work on one thing, you don't have John developing the new for honour game suddenly fixing bugs in R6 that is not how game development works and would be a very bad way of managing it
---
The guy looks like Michael Peña
---
It's mira's because there is no drum mag
---
You mean Mira’s Vector right?
---
You don’t read very well do you? 
---
Enjoy getting shit on you ignorant piece of shit
---
Aresole is a toxin, it might be able to be used for chemical warfare but not a biological one if i understand correctly. That might be splitting hairs to some people but if i recall correctly one of the trailers for either the white masks or the game opening informs us of a biological weapon, meaning, more then just a toxin in a solvent, some kind of virus or bacterium.
---
There are just some situations when you are in a good spot to take on a fight but the guy with the M&amp;K has the aim potential so high that you simply can't do shit unless your first bullet is a headshot, and since I assume you're a human being, and not a robot, it's not going to be that.
---
M&amp;K users have the potential, and expected ability, to land more shots on target and even better shots on target than controller users, hence why M&amp;K players get more kills. It's not necessarily to do with their "aim" as such, because maybe that controller player would be better than the M&amp;K user if both were using the same devices, but the fact that the M&amp;K user's aim is [artificially] boosted by the device used, it is a fair argument to blame it on the M&amp;K.
---
I cant agree more. I started in the early days of wind bastion, so i've only seen one new set of guns, and i want to see more.
---
Man I hope you still play on Xbox 😈
---
I disagree so far but we havent played it yet, i liked the aussies cause mozzie waa so fun to play.
---
Why would a cav main be afraid of jackal?  Cav literally counters jack
---
Laughs in black ice
---
pick operators based off your teams need for that round. having a main is moronic
---
Hes my boy :,)
---
Just happened to me last night. Absolutely ruins the game idk what the point is for these idiots.
---
Perfect let’s see how many items I’ll buy
---
The attacker has the super nova. Hibana and echos shotgun.
---
What makes you think they give her a weapon she didn’t have on release? That will be unprecedented decision in Siege’s history.
---
source?
---
Have you tried buying codes online? from authorized reseller obviously.
---
Cool and good
---
If I had one I would take it out
---
I remember reading a bit about this, is that why melting and vaporisation point are not listed?
---
I am on steam, will i habe to repurchase the game?
---
Maestro does look really good, but whats the best use of his cams, and what sort of places do you want to put them?
---
Ok then it is bandit thx Guys!
---
Glitches only get fixed when they are a problem, if he doesn’t make the videos explaining it somebody else will. There’s no point fighting it. If his channel somehow got taken down, MZN would become “the” channel. And if MZN got taken down someone else would take the spot. Where there is money to be made, someone will always be willing to fill the role
---
Balanced, yes. Definitely. There's a huge difference between balance and power. You are either balanced or broken, but OP or UP (underpowered/weak). Glaz was broken but neither OP nor weak. BB is fundamentally broken but situationally OP only. Ela was broken and OP. Mira is balanced but powerful, but neither op nor weak. You are balanced when you don't violate any fundamental mechanic, unlike how lion was broken because he violated the mechanic of movement and BB is broken because he violated the 1shs rule. You are Op or weak if you have too much or too less.
---
Nøkk and warden don't violate anything, so they don't mess up the meta and that's good. They are however, lacking in Power. Nøkk, situationally, warden severly. So their gadgets need fixes first, loadouts next. But they are far from Imbalanced.
---
The electrified castle barricades sound like a good idea as at the minute the barricades are too easy to counter
---
I never said it was fun. I said it’s part of the game.
---
Police action is not combat. *Smiles through pepper spray*
---
Fighting insurgents and terrorists isn't bound by the Geneva convention.
---
Ok now I'm confused. Need to try this.
---
Sorry, I meant Bandit
---
Then you have bad RNG, not much to say.
---
Yes but mic is a external wire that needs to audio jack's that I don't have
---
... Why are we voting on things that won't happen?
---
No barbed wire tho
---
Goes to show siege needs a new engine
---
How is what Smoke's wearing futuristic?
---
Pc
---
It's just an act to make things more interesting
---
But smoke’s elite skin name is sanguine arsenic which means sanguine is a reddish-brownish color which is the color of his outfit and arsenic is a type of poison so it might not be aerosol
---
His ability should be passive/ have the recharge timer like cav and not full out reset, Castle is made to attempt to redirect enemy's from a certain vantage point so the drone hole should remain for foot shots.
---
Wait what? Could you elaborate please?
---
But ill get 8 operators including the nokk warden and the other two before them
---
Why Reddit hide the gif?? I can’t see anything wrong with this!!!?
---
But gg man
---
What?
---
Sub f2p bussiness model
---
Ends 3 weeks from tomorrow.
---
This is great. If devs want to recycle guns, then it's fine. Just give the operators guns that are ACTUALLY GOOD.
---
Vector and TCSG for the defender and G8A1 and Supernova for attacker.
---
Looking forward to it as Vector is beast and the G8A1 is a well rounded gun too.
---
Nokk and Warden got shitty guns, that's why people were even more annoyed at them. If they had gotten GOOD recycled guns, people wouldn't be complaining as much.
---
No, they don't have licensed weapons. You can use names like 416c and MK17 without any permission. If they had license, 416c would be named HK or Heckler und Koch 416 and MK17 just FN SCAR-H.

W-1 and C-2
---
So I could make a better version of this post?
---
I want that jacket in real life ::)
---
I have black ice for both of ashes guns and her elite skin also. I've even got a duplicate black ice for ashes R4 which broke my fricking heart 😭
---
From what I’ve read, they can’t add anymore because the consoles are at the data limit, soo we get rework maps and recycled guns
---
As a fuze main I can confirm that this is typically how things are supposed to work out.
---
You can do that?
---
My arsole is in position!
---
Only 3 armour ops will have acogs, not all. it is consistent. If a gun has an acog, all variants will have an acog and vice versa. Kaid doesnt have smg acog for balance, and to stop the acog being overused, mira too would be excessively strong with an acog. 
---
They never said all 3 armour would have acogs just that 1/2 armour defenders never would.
---
One some maps, or with certain Ops (Ying, Twitch, Blackbeard come to mind) its a good strat and often incredibly effective.  
---
Its *extremely* risky of course, but what people fail to realize a lot is the high-risk high-impact strat is often far more effective in a situation rather than the safer/easier strat, especially as a surprise, because everyone practices for and against the "safe, effective" strats but rarely are they prepared or expecting for someone to YEET their ass through a window putting rounds out there at 1000RPM with the F2 or Flashing the whole room and clearing it with a gun that doesn't need reloading to kill the entire team.  
---
It becomes more effective with a team that is communicating too, because then you  set it up so that at the very worst you wind up 1-for-1 because either the Defender reacts to you, but gets taken out by the Attacker holding the traditional angle or they don't and you waste them.
---
It means that the person saying it is being pushed? Is this a troll question? Also, punctuation would be nice next time.
---
I like to put his active defence system behind shields I'm using for cover incase of grenades or a fuze
---
RFF should be activated by gadgets as well.
---
Ty for the feedback
---
Thats why I have the vote options, If you don't want them just dont vote :)
---
You never fix all the bugs. There will always be bugs.
---
Poor thatcher's crying seeing all his SAS friends with the M590A1 and SMG-11.
---
At least the old man has the AR-33. He can flex on all the SAS boys for having the best full-auto gun out of all of them.
---
AR-33 &gt; L85A2.
---
Very simple fix, stop giving a fuck about console, offer a free PC account to anyone playing on console and focus on growing your PC playerbase which is by far the better version and more competitive version of the game
---
Arsole is a solid white powder, so I’m pretty sure it’s just a joke
---
This was shown on another skin as well I think
---
Oh okay. I only heard that the Attacker is going to have the SuperNova (worst shotgun IMHO) and I judged. 
---
The G8A1 is basically a 50+1 Round AR. And the Vector is one of the best guns on defence (IMO) of you can control that high recoil to hit an entire mag on target in one go. 
---
So as far as weapons go, there’s a lot worse weapons that they could have recycled and this Season they actually seem pretty decent as long as gadgets are as good as they seem to be.
---
There are multiple version of every gun so problably different vextor model
---
thats where i am haha, poor players do anything to win..
---
The load out makes sense, but for balancing reason if they gadget worked how everyone thought it would, the MP5 would overlook the P90 as it does now, personally I think it should be the P90, FBI shotty, P10-C, and the P226
---
That's sick
---
Imagine if Ubi's nerfing the TCSG and removing its ACOG. That could be why the 2-2 defender is getting it.
---
Hopefully not but I wouldn't be shocked if devs remove the ACOG from the shotty and give it to Kaid's AUG.

---
I got 4x g36c and 4x p90 and not a single r4c, after around 1-1,1k packs, unlucky
---
&gt;&gt;The only thing I said wrong was slug shelled shotguns require CQC. It's 5am currently so not doing to well for thinking out sentences when I've already proven every point of yours false. But here I'll correct it. Every shotgun except ones with slugs require CQC. Happy?
---
it's not the only wrong thing you've said, and you still have yet to prove *anything* I've said wrong.
---
&gt;&gt;Ela's shotgun can not out perform any assault rifle at any range past 15 meters. That's a fact. 
---
that is not a fact what the fuck? entirely false
---
&gt;&gt;Ela's shotgun does require skill, 
---
yeah, no it doesn't
---
&gt;&gt;neither does it have superior ranges to much of any shotguns as most pump actions have better damage per pellet against it. 
---
yes that is fucking obvious, pump actions have higher damage, but you also can't spam and spray pump actions like you can with ela's
---
&gt;&gt;With the FO-12 you need to close the gap with your enemy, 
---
no. you. do. not.
---
&gt;&gt;It can not and it will never out perform an assault rifle. 
---
at close to mid range it fucks up anything
---
&gt;&gt;It isn't strong in any field. 
---
it's fucking obvious that it won't outgun an ar at long range as it's a shotgun
---
&gt;&gt;t requires skill like every other shotgun in game. Just because you can't get out of a 10 meter range of the FO-12 which at that range is loses much of its damage. 
---
it doesn't lose most of its damage
---
&gt;&gt;Doesn't mean you have any argument to say that it requires no skill. 
---
you still haven't said a *single* convincing argument proving that it does have skill
---
&gt;&gt;Because it's supposed to be a great gun for CQC and it is. But anything past it and it's out classed, out ranged, out damaged even by other shotguns. 
---
close to mid range it is not outclassed
---
&gt;&gt;you debunked yourself many many times, 
---
please explain how I've dubunked myself (because anyone with an iq above 7 can determine that's false)
---
&gt;&gt;shotguns that aren't slugged can't fight at range. It requires skill, like every unslugged shotgun. It's as simple as that. 
---
they cannot fight at long range *obviously* but ela's destroys anyone at close to mid range with barely even having to aim 
---
&gt;&gt;You haven't given a proper reason either to why it doesn't asides it doesn't need to be CQC to win. 
---
you haven't given a single reason proving that her shotgun takes skill.
---
&gt;&gt;But to be effective and be consistently effective the FO-12 like every other buckshot shotgun needs to fight at CQC. 
---
*no it fucking doesn't*
---
&gt;&gt;Case closed, check mate...You lose. For the 5th time now.
---
you literally haven't proven a *single* thing i've said wrong. adding "check mate you lose" doesn't automatically mean you win lmao. and you dodged my question about username and platform. you haven't provided a single true argument. you lost the moment you said "ela shotgun takes skill"
---
*and* you sill haven't addressed that ela shotgun doesn't require any gunskill (aim) to be consistent with because you know that's a fact. you can literally slap a laser and an extended barrel and control a whole area and barely have to aim at all.
---
Damn I feel your pain man 😧
---

Exactly, it's already has the most diverse load out of weapons to pick from compared to cod or battlefield and csgo. It's more the gadgets that draw to me using an op

There would be dozens and more of weapons and variants to use.

Quick leaning was beautiful I wish you were there to experience it. Once I learned it I never did the normal lean again.

same,although im not too thrilled about the G8A1. It's a weapon I want to love but that ADS time feels bad even compared to the other LMGs although I think that's just in my head.

I think it's a good selection at the very least. Neither of them look like they're going to be Warden levels of boring.

&gt;&gt;Here's a thing that disproves everything about your shitty argument. Even though you debunked yourself time and time again. Ela's shotgun doesn't do a lot of damage. It doesn't. It only does 35 damage per pellet up to 12 meters. Right around 10 where I said it dropped and it does shockingly even with an extended barrel. From 12 to 18 meters it does 29 damage which is still kinda good. From 21 and onwards it does 17.
---
Lets look at other shotguns stats. First the M950. Up to 8 meters it does 48 damage, the max is higher but distance shorter. Okay lets see what happens after that. From 12 meters and onwards it does a max of 20 base and doesn't stop until the pellet derender. Wait is that a shotgun doing more than the FO-12 at range? It is!
---
The Ita2L lets see, does a max of 50 damage per pellet up to 2 meters. Not great fall off range at all for the first range numbers. But funnily enough 12 meters and onwards it does a base of 30. More than the FO-12 again until the pellets of shotguns derender.
---
Even the M870 out does the Scorpion in ranged damage as 12 meters and beyond it does 20 damage. 3 more than the scorpions base damage for range. Funny ain't it?
---
The Spas 12 out dose the Scorpion as well as up to 4 meters it does 35 damage. Quite close to the FO-12 but not as much range for that one. That damage drops to 27 so a little lower than a Fo-12 ain't it...But wait! Is that oh my, 20 meters and onwards it does more damage at a max of 23? And that only starts at 1 meters before the FO-12 so it's pretty much negligible.
---
Last the French shotgun. The SG-CQB. It does a max of 53 damage per pellet up to 5 meters. Not great range but from 12 meters and onwards it does 26 damage per pellet. Interesting how all of these shotguns have a better damage per pellet at range.
---
goddamn you're a fucking dumbass. the shotgun is strong because it has extended barrel and can fire insanely fast. you claim it has a high damage drop off but that literally means nothing when you can spam it and not aim. you *still* haven't provided any counter argument against the fact that it takes next to no gunskill.
---
it's been the 4th comment you've dodged this i think, not looking good for you lmao.
---
also stats don't make weapons like you think they do, the mp5 for example, has below avg stats and yet it's one of the most powerful weapons on defense
---
after doing viewing your page i assume that you name is meech_skimpy on ps4 (im iLasrr on xbox feel free to look me up on r6tab.com or something) and I understand why you would think ela's shotgun takes skill, you're fucking trash. you've been plat one season and didnt even make it past 4k elo, and every other season you've been gold, silver, or bronze. *and* to top it all off, your ranked kd is negative lmao. so I see why you would think ela's shotty takes skill. "im high plat" yeah, no you're not.
---
&gt;&gt;It's almost like the FO-12 is a very average shotgun and like every other unslugged shotgun needs CQC for the most part. 
---
even though it has extended barrel, can be spam fired at the speed of sound, and takes zero gunskill to use (you literally cant argue that)
---
&gt;&gt;So suck on that saying I have zero facts. I'm the only person who's provided any facts whilst you just say no and that's not true. To facts and statistics you can literally check in game for your ownself. 
---
like i said earlier, stats dont make every weapon, attachments and recoil spray have a drastic effect. and sating ingame stats isn't proving facts that ela shotgun takes skill
---
&gt;&gt;Try next time saying parts of my comments are wrong, when they're right. 
---
like I said, stating gun stats proves nothing
---
&gt;&gt;You lost a long time ago.
---
I haven't lost shit and the fact that you think so is baffling. like I've said many times, you lost the moment you said "ela shotgun takes skill" cAsE cLoSeD
---
Yeah the sad thing is I play mostly newer operators and I don't know if it's a good idea to play an operator just because I got a skin for them.
---
They want 100 ops and they're using a decade old engine. There's limitations to how much data they can fit.
---
I think his hand is in a fist

Oh yikes, thanks

People would catch on quick, but just imagine how satisfying it would be for a Monty to walk straight into a room all full of himself and get mowed down by a turret lol

so you think they say data limits and game engine limits for fun? ok dude
---
The same neckbeards getting buttmad cuz there are no new guns... Can't win...
---
Newer operators? Like Lesion? Or even newer?
---
Droning out is BARELY acceptable because one you breach they start coming to your room. And now that you are in the room you have no protection against them rotating. When still outside the window you have cover and protection and can leave if it's not a good position.

Smells like silver in here.

Warden is not a bad character. He counters abused strats that the pro league and diamond uses, that's why the majority of us see him as useless. With the upcoming "buff", he'll be a Lion

Awesome

no problem . Lad
---
I'm very skeptical of this claim. The range of which attackers can hold with their rifles that usually have an acog make shotguns with the exception of Kaid the worst choice to engage them at a distance that is common for attackers to be positioned. This doesn't take into account tight angles and cover which is what really kills shotguns.

1. no there isn’t.

2. that’s not true.

3. good for you. 
---
it’s not even about the gun variants. it’s been said before that basically every variant of damage-fire rate is available in a weapon so new guns would just basically be re skins of guns already in the game. i’d rather have balanced ops and recycled guns
---
that's fair. . .but I wonder if you could tweak for spawn killers somehow? Maybe have  a 10 second activation effect, like a spark / flash?
---
The part if the reason why Nokk and Warden are so underwhelming is because of their choice of weaponry.
---
The MPX is a terrible gun, and the FMG9's damage isn't suited to Nokk's playstyle, and required headshots.

For real though, that's probably the skin of the device the new defender will use to activate the fire charge on her shield.
---
Here’s the problem. One of the main selling points of siege is that it has so many unique operators, recycling old guns, especially bad ones takes away from the uniqueness. The least they could do is slightly rework a gun like what they did with gridlocks m249.

Ash has nearly as much utility with better guns and 3 speed. Zofia is meant to have utility.
---
Meh, she’s useful, but she’s good with the amount she has now, and you can’t really use the impacts on people as they don’t do enough damage to kill, and they can’t hard breach.

Ok will do thanks

And they already needed her before for her having too much utility
---
There are already so many weapons in the game I'm surprised the texture artist can even keep up with making all the seasonal skins for all the weapons.
---
They did have better guns and armor but they were also very unreliable and prone to break downs do to the rushed and complex nature of them. The allied tanks weren’t as powerful in straight matchup, but were cheaper, simpler and more reliable.

If its grenades its fine. I was more worried that they were buffing her ability xD

So only after the last season the licensing new guns became hard? Why could they add new weapons before phantom sight if there's licensing issues? What changed?
---
Didn’t ubi say they want to keep boosted players and encourage boosting in the dev blog /s
---
That would be? People making smurfs to see whats going on?
---
Not really. Glaz used to be great, but got nerfed badly and is now never played. Fuze is the worst attacker in the game and is never played. Tachanka is the worst defender in the game and is never played. Kapkan is sometimes played, maybe 1-2 rounds each tournament so no he really isn't ever used.
---
No they said they were frustrated so they were going to remove the game from everyone library and starting from the beta again. /s
---
My brother (who was with me) said she did, but she got her deployable shield back

Yup

 Spetsnaz ops no but finka is played in LATAM if they're pissed off

---
90% of why I like new operations and using certain OPs is the guns so it's super sad to see twice in a row. When I play I pick based off what I think will be useful and what gun I want to use.
---
I'll check out the twitch section of it
---
13 melees and impacting it to kill someone slapping it is pretty neat
---
Fuck I’m hungry now
---
Ubisoft already said no more new weapons this year
---
Yeah Russian Badger is who's inspired me to look into picking it up
---
Played it at the Raleigh Major. There were no new weapons.

6k if you count the drone

Oh OK well good luck and have fun playing siege

attacker gets IQs LMG, supernova shotgun (or wtv its called) secondary breaching shotty, and a pistol

---
Why has a screenshot of a nitro cell have over one hundred upvotes?
---
Jackal and Lesion are very common, I've seen some Doc bans before, but I've never seen a Buck ban.
---
My guess is softwall breaching for Buck, otherwise idk.
---
How do you nut to a picture? asking for a friend

steampunk castle and the barricade is brass with cogwheels on it or sth
---
They’re DDOSing their servers that they’re paying for
---
3 months after Phantom Sight started.
---
Ugh... I don’t mind recycled weapons but god damn give us good weapons. 
---
I hate Mira’s recoil and low ammo on console. I do like Kaids shotgun, but I don’t like this Ops gadget from what I’ve seen, So I’d rather just play Kaid for that.
---
Super Nova is garbage, IQ LMG is also not great. I was really hoping for a more run and gun weapons than a lmg with low ads time. Give us the MP7 on some one besides bandit!
---
If you Traded in game it used to give a point to each team. So if you were 4-4 in OT it would be 5-5 and another round would be played. 
---
Now they changed the draw mechanics so it’s not possible to draw anymore.
---
I can repost a shorter one if you want
---
yeah you don’t know what you’re talking about. they add skins and remove old ones. and on top of that, those are two COMPLETELY different things

You gotta believe in the shotty and it will believe in you

The only shotty I believe in is the FO-12
---
No she really is, I heard people say this like 3 days ago
---
It's just interesting how everyone does everything they can on a PC to get a slight edge (squeezing for the most fps, changing settings) yet in ranked put themselves at the disadvantage by putting points off.
---
You didn't, you either hit somewhere on the helmet that isn't in the hitbox or the tiny gap between bullets made you "miss"

Cool that it spreads a bit without advertising much! Thank you very much!
---
Me compadre, I have become the dumbass therefore must share dumbassness
---
Oh that level, nice.
---
I dont think so
---
The hours played, ive double checked. And for me its about 130 hours short
---
What? If you face west. It's on the Western wall.
---
Ooh I found how we can do that
---
Even for reused weapons the Warden and Nokk choices made no sense. The Secret Service actually has Five-seveNs and P90s and you give Nokk the Five-seveN (and allegedly the P90 as well in early testing).
---
Personally I don’t experience m&amp;kb a lot on console, but that could just be my rank. And all of what you said needed to be fixed is true, but it’s hard to balance fixing a game, and keeping each operator not overpowered
---
Yep
---
I know they are annoying but ubi should not remove them. Only spawnpeek ubi should prevent are the instant ones. 
---
 Drone common spawnpeeking spots and prefire them if you see someone, or just spawn in a different location. You will get killed only if you rush mindlessly.  Consider them a way to check if you are playing against absent minded players or careful ones
---
Need better "Pulse"
---
But they still shoot through windows when you spawn in
---
But you can if it's your only OP.
---
I use it.
---
Omg how
---
Lucky
---
How has SMG-11 not made the list yet?
---
LAUGH MY SOCKS OFF
---
There aren't so many spots like that
---
Doc’s looks amazing, but too visible for me
---
All I'm asking for is a 5 second immunity or something.
---
Stuns were better. You hear a vibration in a room while walking. Throw a stun kill the guy.
---
Um your a little late to the party
---
Ok well that’s just my luck
---
And how many times was Zofia banned? They have a graph that showed how much she was banned, and she was like the 2nd or 1st most unbanned op, and that says to me that she’s fine, and people think she’s very balanced. Also capitão is getting nerfed?
---
Pistol: The SDU handgun
---
Shotgun: Ita12s
---
Machine pistol: smg-11
---
Cool about Frost.
---
Dokkaebi didn't care, I use her with smoke grenades.
---
Rainbow6DE twitter posted it by accident and deleted it quickly, they fucked up big time.
---
Must have been his only operator, not sure how he’s managed to get level 30 using just recruit tho. V impressive lmao
---
This clip could be done with current glaz. It's a lucky wallbang, with no real use of his gadget.
---
Congrats, I will never get that lucky lol
---
I don't mean right when you spawn in, I mean that you walk towards the entrance and instantly get headshoted out of nowhere
---
Probably starting next week or the week after since the reveal for S3 is tommorow
---
Happens to us all
---
Vanilla
---
Good drawing, just about the elite skin in general have you ever seen Ant Bully?
---
I find that a little funny coming from a W+M1 queen main.  (No disrespect, I'm guilty of it)
---
The drawing is better than the actual thing, good job
---
Absolute fire man. Nice work🤩
---
I dont think they are actually the same guns. Just look at the shutgun, there isnt such thing in the game. And the vector doesn't have the same default camo than mira's or lion's.
---
Zofias pick rate is also very high in PL but she isnt ban worthy because Jackal and Capitao are much more worthy bans than her. So.....
---
And yes, Capitaos asphyxiating bolts are about to get adjusted (nerfed) again since they are so powerful hence why he’s banned so much.
---
I always laugh after wallbanging someone and he sends me a message: "report for hack"
---
Well... That isn't spawn kill. You should learn that spawn peeks and just try to kill the spawnpeekers just wait some seconds and go.
---
Ahahah that's unexpected!
---
Thank you!
---
Meth
---
Well thank you, das very kind of u
---
I mean about the gadgets, how does the shield work etc?
---
👏Ok👏Have👏Nice👏Day👏
---
Doc looks ready for a Nerf Match
---
Say it louder for the people in the back!!
---
In other words, he's going to get an amazing elite while ops that don't get banned wind up with ugly ones.
---
Rogue, penta and fnatic. Also I'm pretty sure penta isn't even a siege team anymore
---
No literally the chemical in the canister is called Arsole
---
Wtf
---
All it takes is one pro to do a hot breach and tards like this will praise the mechanic. 
---
&gt;Smells like silver in here.
---
Smells like gatekeeping cunt in here. Such a pretencious twat.
---
Did they announce S3's already?
---
I have almost every operator tho
---
I'm surprised I haven't got some of those messages because I hit some of the luckiest wallbangs
---
Yeah, lots of other teams need some respect as well.
---
Well boys. We won't be hot breaching for the next one to two seasons. /s
---
It looks very cool
---
The face of the white dressed boi at the end. BRUH
---
This dude should create new elites bruh
---
I don't see the problem in recycled weapons. Less balancing issues and more skins for more operators.
---
Already leaked . The Attacker has Supernova shotgun and IQ's LMG . The Defender has Kaid's Slug Shottie and Mira's Vector
---
I'm just glad G2 finally got one. Shame it's for sledge though, literally bought his elite like 2 days ago
---
That may be true for some but definitely not most people. One of the main selling points of siege is how every operator faction is unique, hell every operator is unique. By refusing weapons you are taking away from that uniqueness. What they should be doing if they are so worried about balanced is just changing weapons already in the game, and giving them a twist so it’s not just a lazy copy paste. For example gridlocks m249 just has an extended mag instead of a belt and a custom scope. That shows the community they actually care and tried to make them unique.
---
You’re a clash main your opinion is not valid
---
So it looks like Cav’s face was changed for the FaZe headgear, not necessarily for an upcoming elite skin.
---
5125 actually BTW
---
me too, sometimes it just pays to be lucky
---
They are doing this for balance reasons. I don’t know why a lot of people don’t seem to understand this. If you keep adding new guns you keep making more and more operators useless due to their guns being outclassed. Just look at mozzie and gridlock. Their guns are fucking insane and are better than 90% of the guns on their respective sides. Also I believe some leaks showed the vector and one of the shotguns. I believe the sas shotgun.

Just forget that, that will not happen never
---
Rank abusing and DDoSing ? Do not stop at this point . It's time to ban them once and for all
---
Do you have a source for this? I’m not doubting you I just want to see an official comment on this.
---
I believe you’re thinking of the L85A1, which does jam frequently and is generally a terrible weapon. However, the rifle used in the game is the L85A2, the improved version of the first model that was reworked by HK.
---
Gatekeeping? I'm just trying to keep bads alive. If you value your life, don't hot breach
---
Full auto on her single shot rifle?
---
With her being banned so little and picked so much, that says that she’s a good operator and she’s balanced too, so there isn’t a need for her to be nerfed
---
RIP my wallet
---
I see, I use my team charm for every operator.
---
Love the flair
---
Those all  look amazing
---
It is a different experience on console because you don’t get one tapped when you see someone and it kinda prolonges the gunfight making it more fun /realistic
---
Totally True
---
The KGB ones shouldn't exist because there is no food in the Soviet Union.
---
Fuck yeah g2
---
Statistically and situationally... not at all.
---
Lmao
---
You're a chad for doing this
---
Autobots, roll out!
---
Allowed to use the form
---
Finally someone i didn't beat by my bad connection
---
The attacker will have IQ's LMG and Super nova . While the defender will have Kaid's Slug Shottie and Mira's Vector
---
FeelsBadMan no skin for tsm
---
They are though that's the supernova and the reused guns for Nokk and Warden also had different default skins for their guns too.
---
Haha good one buddy another “leaked” joke
---
Prolly for the rest of the year. There prolly going to realise it would fuck up the balance
---
I want to see a CTU using Street Sweeper that would be awesome even though we have AA12 with 30 round mags
---
True but I hate how on different perspective the smoke has more or less transparency
---
gonna take the trap meta to a whole new level lmao
---
I disagree. I believe they they are cool and new, just not as good as other ops
---
In a message..?
---
Hibana’s. Nora Rengo is almost exactly the same as her old faze one
---
You can message people individually
---
Thank you
---
Yeah....

Better accuracy without ADS, good for shotguns and spamming pistols

It makes hip fire 25% tighter

I would rather they redo the silencer.  Its annoying that its just flat out horrible to use.

pro: reduce hipfire spray
---
con: gives your position away
---
thats it
---
:) i will and you can have my sub!!
---
Attacker has
---
SMG-11
---
ITAL12S
---
defender had

P229 (lesions Pistol)

I never have an issue taking out enemies with the CAMRUS. The Skeleton Key handles the close up situations.

Big fish, small pond.

There's already a Caveira bundle without her Skullface makeup on.

There’s a recruit rush meta where your whole team has shields and rush’s the bomb
---
Wow thanks so much!!!!
---
Imo his pdw has better recoil control when opening full auto, plus 50 rounds, i use the c7 when i wanna use burst fire *shrugs* it comes down to personal preference in the end, go test it on thunt realistic see which one feels better to you
---
Do you not know what a GOOD joke is?

Not really useful on most guns

you.

Oof.

Everybody in that lobby playing in a different dimension

Not anything to do with Reticle placement?
---
They joined the siege scene when the program request went away. Well around that time.
---
Doesn’t affect shotguns anymore. That was change like a year ago.
---
if you don’t restart the queue after 2 minutes you’re just wasting your own time. it’s common sense.
---
HOW DO U GET THESE
---
Nah fps games like cod and halo should def be on controller.
---
pentas still a team?
---
Ha whoops, haven’t played since Alibi came out lol
---
Basically, yes
---
I never thought of having an IQ on defence, but if it makes warden usable, then I'm game.
---
ME SAY ALONE RAMP ME SAY ALONE RAMP
---
Yes you can. You’d be surprised how often you get DM’d by toxic people on the other team lol
---
Thank you guys for the suggestions
---
What the fuck
---
Well then youll have a ton of fun with the upcomming operators..but why not also hope that people that like "New guns" also have something to look forward to ? This isnt like...taking something away from you...its just...making everyone happy , which ubisoft could easily achieve.
---
This is why the community can be so. Toxic.
---
Definitely
---
Let me guess.You’re alone for 10 years
---
But are they wrong..?
---
Coming from a 2 year Ps4 player
---
When they’re released, I believe they’ll be available in the bundles section
---
Great ideas
---
shame...
---
I like yager
---
That isn't how they usually work.
---
are you retarded
---
Hell yea
---
They are satisfied until you stop picking her and pick someone else instead, that's their balancing principal.
---
Place her gadget in crucial windows for the objective and roam using her impacts to surprise people. Also, use the pocket shotgun to create murder holes or open hatches for you or your teammates.
---
Its a good drawing but the eyes are freaking me out
---
How much? Lol
---
Idk if anyone noticed this but on the back of his neck there is a scar that might be from some sort of gas or just some sort of burn
---
Gib me the Lord
---
And Kriss Vector has no Acog. Otherwise, this is an imbalance, given for Mira.
---
Exactly! He looked so lost..
---
Gay maestro?

Thx dude

Wait no please nooo

Fuck yeahhhhh

I hope you know this has been posted 100 times since phantom sight came out

It does don't know why u are getting down votes
---
Hey what’s going on guys it’s your boy Braction
---
Clash is best op
---
 @ u/Krallorddark i agree with tachankadank and warden BUT with warden i disagree with the rook thing because i see that as op if all of his team is able to see trough the smoke flashbangs etc and the part where it can be aqquried by wearing them i however totally agree with the speed change and IMO i prefer the MPX to the p90 just because i feel like the p90 isnt really that good neither is the mpx i just prefer it TBH the slit thing is a no from me cause i feel like its a bit op at higher ranks which could make you say "but its not only used at higher ranks" which i get BUT they have to make it so its not too OP in pro league aswell but i fully agree with the drone blocking concept etc i also feel like it should take more hits to destroy it etc

Hello imblack4, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/crtop3/i_think_we_broke_blitz/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Seems pretty normal to me. Try the higher graphics pack or whatever it's called on steam.
---
I don't understand Kapkans elite uniform. All the spetsnaz boys are from alpha group, not vympel. And Kapkan was 10 years old when the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.
---
Cool knife dance though. 
---
5/10
---
W-1 and C-2 for sure, having warden be a 2/2 would make him comparable to Mute and Smoke on defense. Having Castle Barricades extend all the way down would be more useful during the early game while also being better for the attackers since they won't have their feet shot.  
---
As for Tachanka, I'd like to see him given access to sights on his turret, that would make him a lot easier to use at longer ranges.
---
Kaid, Sledge, and Blitz look best in my opinion
---
r/lostredditors
---
Ok.
---
I'm pretty sure we have different definitions of "western wall"
---
Naw it's console to get to play you need m&amp;k /s
---
You shouldn't get R6 credits as the whole point of elite skins is so people can only get it if you pay for it.
---
I thought you could change up easily. They should still do it to at least waste their time.
---
How is it bad?
---
That Nora-Rengo skin is 👌
---
Amazing
---
I actually waited 2 hours because after 99:59 it goes back to 00:00
---
gotta get diamond i guess man
---
ok will do but i wont have evidence as it dosent say
---
Don’t forget the Kriss Compact SDP9.
---
it looks so weird and unnatural. even his hair is like flush with his mask. he got thiccer tho
---
There is,  you just have like a fingertip worth of flour so you have to improvise with dust, weeds and neighbouring children.
---
Well it was an important lesson, now wasnt it?
---
There are ops other than recruit? Are those what those little pictures are?
---
People are stupid
---
What balancing does bb need?
---
Mmk is fine, if you use it on PC or against people who are also on mnk.
---
I was level 12 at the time I had no idea.
---
At best he could do with some quality of life improvements, or maybe an extra primary option.
---
Being able to deploy and remove his own barricades faster would be convenient without being overly powerful, and his gadget is situational and passive enough that he probably doesn't deserve to have the worst SMG and the worst semi-auto shotgun as his primary choices.
---
I honestly don't understand the operator choices. Most of them either have elites, Pilot Program Phase 1 skins or both. Why not pick an operator who lacks any premium cosmetics? Capitao? Jackal? Zofia?  Castle? Ela? I don't get it. I was excited for this program but now I can't see myself getting more than 1 or 2 of these.
---
Interesting, don't know much about MIBR, are they big like maybe tier 2 org etc?
---
Not using weapons but by hitting him using either of these two
---
Give bandit the long flowing locks he deserves!
---
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE r/angryupvote
---
It’s not really one of the best though. Not in the top five at least.
---
I was level 12 at the time, I had no idea.
---
you don’t need to buy it to see it
---
INFIRMUS
---
Yes i agree with you on that but copy and pasting guns can create major problems in terms of balancing. If you take castle for instance a pot of people find him weak and in theory buffing his gun a bit could make him a better option but in buffing the ump you indirectly buff pulse as well, an operator that clearly doesn't need a buff.
---
Theme park bad
---
From what i have seen mnk isn’t the greatest on console
---
Frenchy ping pong grandmaster strikes again

And people say Elite skins don't match with their ops...

THIS IS WHY PLAGUE DOCTOR SMOKE CAN'T BE A THING, PEOPLE!

Arthur Morgan is that you?

What is love ? Maybe wont hurt me
---
IQ looks so happy too
---
Wtf, this is fucking dumb.
---
I run on attacker Thermite, Nokk, Maverick, and Jackle. On defense I run Warden, Mozzie, and sometimes frost
---
Because the teams doesn't care what cosmetics the ops have? They just pick the ops that they feel they use the most.
---
If you’re Irish...
---
So did you copy and paste this from your other response. I've already answered everything you've said how? Or no? Or no not entirely. You're wrong. I probably have a better kd and rank than you if you really feel that entitled to say that matters. Even though I likely do since I'm not someone who ignores stats. Because stats make a weapon. Attachments do add on to weapon but they don't make a weapon. They add on to it to make it better in some way or form. The FO-12 like every shotgun requires you to close the gap with your enemy. If you try to fight long range you will loss as the damage drop off, shotgun pellet render distances. The inability for shotguns to headshot, as well as recoil management becomes too much for a shotgun to compete. It can't and it won't. It is literally impossible for it to do so. You've said the thing with the Scorpion that it's CQC and requires skill to close the gap with your enemy. You said that yourself. Yet shotguns are all exactly like that. Please give me a stat, any bit of evidence showing a shotgun beating someone with an assault rifle past 20 meters. When they're both on full health as well. You won't find it because it's impossible unless the enemy is that fucking stupid. It can't out gun, it can't out range any weapon that shoots bullets. It's a shotgun shooting buckshot. It needs CQC to be effective. It does very average damage for a shotgun. Much less than most of them. It has somewhat better ranges than them for mid range. But long ranges the FO-12 falls behind all of its counterparts asides a very small few. The Super Shorty being the only shotgun coming to mind that does less damage than the FO-12 at ranges. Your argument debunked itself. I've stated it time and time again saying exactly what you've said. Exactly how you fucked your own damn argument over. Stats make a weapon, attachments may add onto it. That's  fact. Another fact being all shotguns require skill. They need to close the gap which requires skill. Every shotgun does and until you show proof asides from words. If you can show me how the FO-12 negates every single stat and proof the game has shown us, testing of years. Please I will take everything back. But I know you won't. You haven't shown anything. You haven't said anything that even gives any remark of how it's so overpowered and requires no skill. Yet it does because guess what? It shoots fucking buckshot. A shell that disperses.  Like every single other shotgun it losses damage as the pellets spread and less hit. And at ranges the pellets become so far spread apart that guess what, your damage is so miniscule it'll feel like just a little prick. It does have recoil. Every precious youtuber who showcases the gun, shows recoil. The stat cards show a nice bit of recoil. In game it has a nice bit of recoil. Because I don't know if you know this. But any gun shooting and ranges has a fair bit of recoil. Admit you lost, because you did a long long time ago. As well to that saying a gun needs to shot more preciosely and slower at ranges proves a lot. It proves that guess what, a shotgun that has heavy recoil to begin with. Can't spam fire. Your argument is in shreds my friend. It's very sad to see how close minded you are to think opinion without any proof or evidence to back it up would trump any kind of facts especially ones created by the dev team and the very hard dedicated community who test these weapons non stop. I pity you truly, I hope one day you can actually get past screaming at people for providing valuable information that instantly has destroyed your arguments. I don't want to call you AOC so please don't embarrass yourself.
---
Thanks !
---
I'm fine with a controller. I like the lessened recoil. I'm a casual gamer and frankly if you want to use MnK quite being a right cunt and buy a PC, quit messing with my games just cuz you can't win

He sucks

Also if you look at the chemical compound it looks like his logo/ icon
