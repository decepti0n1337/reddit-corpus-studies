I've had a thing like this before. I was about lvl 20 and I got a weird legendary skin for Blackbeard and Rook

Ahhhh, Bartlett

I can sort of see that because Grim Sky was DEFINITELY heavily more themed on the British side (Hereford rework + ALL Universal skins were British themed (Majesty + Sovereign referencing the Royalty, Whitehall 1212 referencing the MPS and Spitfire referencing Hereford). US/Maverick got no universal skins at all that season.

That sucks. I found a lil group to play with.. most of the time it's 2 others and me playing.. but the comms are kinda bad.. seems like they're screaming they're so loud lmao I have them on 15% in discord and it's still loud.. not sure what that issue is. Yikes.

At least it's not hostage.

Yikes. Sounds like he's one of those op ideas that are either overpowered, or underpowered when balanced. There's no in between for Blackout.
---
I'd still like having it. 
---
It wouldn't be so dark that it would be impossible for the attackers to see, but just dark enough that a flanker would be able to get the first shot on the enemy.

Right? Seriously need two flairs to represent our mains.

Yes. One is usually plat 3 or around the gold ranges. I never got plat, almost got gold 3 like yesterday but lost a Match (random went 1-8 so kinda hard to carry him).. shouldn't be hard to get though.

Congrats dude, be sure to update us when you get your first mvp and ace. I remember getting my first mvp, and shaking the whole last round. This game can be brutal, and a theres a lot of toxicity, but god dam it makes you feel good when you hit personal milestones.

Am I missing something? Anyone can get 12 kills as Tachanka

Poor Blackout, he is lost within the world of no in between :(

Wver heard of reloading??

Pretty good man, keep grinding 💪

Looks like a chimera skin tbh

Big brain plays

POPLAR CREEK IN THE SUMMER.
---
Weekly I believe 
---
I’m saying that it takes away any use with Mozzie, as destroying the drones means you can’t hack them. Bandit and Kaid can simply not place their wire, and teammates can not be idiots. However, with Jäger, once that is down, it’s gonna shoot those no matter the placement, unless you get rid of the ADS as a defender, which just makes Jäger’s ability useless.
---
Drones may be more important than grenades, however, as you mentioned, grenades that people won’t use prolifically, like non-ying flashes, will counter the ADS, as you can burn those to make way for more important grenades like EMPs or Candelas. Drones, however, in late-game, once you have the objective close to you, are either useless or kept stationary, meaning you could use them to hurt Jäger’s nade-zapping,  a nerf, or they won’t affect it.   
---
However, let’s say that Jäger is buffed overall by this. This will mean three things:
---
1. Droning is now far less effective, and you cannot have any flexibility with it. Jumping is the only way to get actually decent drone spots. An operator’s ability should not counter skill. Skill should.
---
2. Mozzie will be far less useful. Jäger is currently the highest picked defender in the game, with a +60% pick rate. Your idea for his gadget makes Mozzie useless. In this case, correlation is causation.
---
3. Jäger will become too powerful. Currently, Jäger is the highest picked operator on defense, with a very good win rate. This does not need a buff. Jäger will become too powerful, likely not to match ACOG Jäger or anything, but something that will disrupt the flow of the game.
---
Finally, taking into thought the drone-destruction powers of Kaid and Bandit, their effective radius is much smaller. One ADS can cover an entire room, easily. A Kaid claw can cover one or two doorways, and a battery just one. Jäger would also hurt Mute, and take the place as #1 anti-drone defender. Finally, the ADS does not need modification. It is a simple gadget that works well and has been balanced for 4 years. Have you ever heard anyone saying that it’s too powerful or not enough? No. it is perfectly balanced.
---
The quality is so bad I thought this was actually her and nice cosplay

This sub repeatedly shows me how little I know about the game and how terrible I am at it.

Still trying, it was in a Leak Video or possible a post on Reddit. It was a Legendary Uniform, Headgear, and AR. Uniform and Headgear being a Re-Color of Jackal’s Hazy Bundle with the Colors Brown, Blue and possibly Grey.

It’s trash for competitive hence the reason it was removed from pl

Why are we doing this?
---
Yea Rest In Peace blitz’s shield acog. That was the best
---
Amen. 
---
Won’t know until people eventually get more new legendaries from alpha packs. 
---
I buy the passes because I want to continue to support development of this game, and I don’t play for the unlocks. I just enjoy fragging people in a game that requires a bit more thought than Call of Duty.

Imagine a sniper 90 with acog, Just imagine

Amen brother, you got my vote. I stopped played because I'm so sick of getting one tapped by a bunch of lames. Luckily Black ops 4 is still at least feeling fair. I got enough time out of rainbow six already I guess.
---
I feel like this would be the new teabagging
---
Ez clap get decent friends play ranked get good . Mouse and keyboard go out the window for the most part . It's still a struggle but I have been clapping MnK users when I have good team mates.
---
Wait till ya learn about the operator’s families 
---
That’s not really what happens most of the time. If the other team sees only two people on the other team, they will literally go the most op ops in the game just to secure the win
---
I’m around 40 but still suck. I think I play too much ranked. I can barely get off a bullet let alone kill someone. 
---
Can I borrow that when you're finished with it?
---
This is true can ubisoft see this? Some games take fan ideas
---
I didn't notice the first time I watched this
---
He would be used so much more because he looks like a raging bull.
---
In Maestro’s words, “I haven’t moved in a while. You should report me.”
---
Mozzie definitely 
---
Sure dude
---
That makes sense, I can see it now. Thank you! :D
---
Honestly, if there's one character who I'd like to read a comic about, it's Maverick.  Of all the operators, he seems the most heroic.
---
okay, thanks for the info. I will read it a bit more. 
---
It’s not out just yet but it’s supposed to be releasing very shortly
---
It’s my clip and I have no words because it looks like I didn’t step out of obj at all and I want other people’s opinions
---
looks like a toasted marshmallow
---
No matter what they say, rook is always the thiccest noi in my book.
---
OwO
---
Excuse me fuze, what the fuck?
---
For checking your own stats thats all good but after a certain point, the in game K/D  or W/L rate you get is kinda the one you'll be stuck with forever which is obviously not representative of your current skill and that's quite unfortunate imo.
---
Or it shows Gridlock doesn't give a damn
---
Yea
---
No Acog lol
---
The skins are great. Better than useless charms that nobody ever uses
---
I dont know what he was doing either
---
True he literally looks like my grandpa
---
Hes clearly not doggimg his teammate hes confused because his teamate was in the objective contesting and the round still ended somehow. How did you get you get him dogging his teammate from this?
---
I’ve played siege for a while and have never seen conflagration ever that looks awesome and I like the gun fir maverick 
---
Well you now know which dlc operator you should get first.
---
Eventually tho, I wouldnt mind a ranked playlist with "hardcore" settings such as this. 
---
Shit looks like fucking trash dog, get the fuck off the alpha pack scene.
---
Mav 
---
Bruh, you stepped out of the door then. 
---
At this rate I could make it as an elite soldier.
---
You can’t get it anymore, you needed to have the season pass before March 4
---
It depends. If you want an attack with a solid gun, and unique tactical uses, Maverick. But if you like echo, or gathering mass amounts of Intel, then I say definitely mozzie. They are both good and you can't go wrong with either or.
---
The killcams are still fucked and have always been, they do really need updating though.
---
Supposedly this specific issue is from the lean camera change, the camera used to be on the side of your head during a lean but now it is always in the center of your head, this means when you are close to a wall while peeking you are sticking out further than you can see.
---
The killcams make this seem even worse because they suck about showing what actually happened and until the killcams are given a buff this issue will likely continue to be seen in the killcams.
---
ubi plsss

pic is from BF1 or BF5
---
I have terrible alpha pack luck, 3 legendaries and two were plasma pink

Will try that

I use the dog tags, they are cool.

Will never use those skins though
---
I actually seen like 3 of these online and they were all for ps4, not saying there isn’t any Xbox ones tho
---
The heartbreak
---
Oh, the new dog tags are nice. But the old medallions that you got for completing the birthday challenges suck.
---
And I'm sitting over here, level 78, and not a single legendary
---
I would rather them not alter speed AT ALL. Like I said, speed in surge is the very thing that makes them powerful. It is the very reason why finka's alpha version of "speed boost" was removed, and her barbed wire speed was nerfed.
---
No amount of speed boost is needed in siege because of how powerful it becomes, and how it throws off armour and speed balance.
---
And Gridlock is still a 3 armour who walks at 1 speed, and tanks the same number of bullets as Fuze, who happens to tank the same number of bullets as ash in most scenarios, since armour doesn't really change the time to kill against defendes' pea shooter SMGs. So armour is a disadvantage. Now you bring in a speed booster, it massively throws armour-speed balance. It doesn't matter what GL wears. If she is rated a 3A1S and she tanks the same amount of bullets as other 3a1s, then it is fine.
---
Anytime you want to suggest a speed boost, remember how EVERY FEATURE of finka's design went through EXCEPT the speed boost. She too was a 2 armour. THAT'S how influential speed boost beyond 3 speed would make in siege.
---
Nice, I have the other Mira Legendary Headgear, it’s a different looking helmet. 
---
I think they didn't add new lengendary skin in WIND BASTION, maybe I'm wrong
---
I feel bad for you
---
Pretty much, yeah
---
You're just carrying the cycle on
---
Just report them if they TK on purpose and move on
---
That doesn't really mean much

Umm, isn't mira spanish? Not Italian? Or does her bio say she was born in Italy. Like how ash is an American fbi officer but was born in Israel
---
Hue slider= reddit gold 
---
Reporting on console doesnt do shit tbh. Besides, when coppers team kill, they deserve to be killed 
---
There's a few ways to use him
---
You could set up drones like Valk cams, and stay on site
---
But you could also use it to roam, and play like an attacker, droning them out
---
The latter seems more 'fun' but it's down to personal choice
---
*whirrring sounds*

You ddos

You could look on ESL I believe they have private tourneys too l.
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
*whispers* Pulse and Hibana are confirmed tho
---
Nice 
---
Agreed, but one you should know what you're getting, two psck system should be based on skill with a progression bar instesd of random chance, and three Ela gets the wordt of everything. Ubisoft is confirmed to hate her exsistance which is sad as shes my favorite op. Maybe they should realize her kit is horrible and fix it and make a bettee legendary.
---
Nope you are 100% correct lol shes from spain 
---
They're colleagues, not necessarily friends.

Yeah Phantom Forces I love that game

Hope they fix it in the next patch

Last day of season, gridlock driving mozzie back home and mozzie is half dead due to boredom

Fuze  
---
  
---
Love the AK12, while sometimes useful I don't care for his ability.
---
Nope. Only default ops and canadian ops can get black ice. 
---
Yeah the feeling is great to move up. I went from bronze 3 last season to silver 4 and now from silver 1 to gold 4. There's a lot of time left in the season so maybe I'll improve and move up even more. I follow the pro scene, watch tips and streamers.id say they helped me get better. Good luck on that road to diamond. 
---
Now don’t go being racist and no one gave you the N-word pass so don’t even think about using it.
---
Bro are u fr it’s a big black square in the middle of the floor ur just a salty copper who doesn’t look around first
---
Ok, now you made it personal.
---
&gt;Take into account drifting would be a big negative in when its comes to the operator because yes speed would increase by about 1 meter per second which isnt a lot
---
You said 4 speed. 2 to 3 speed is around 15%. 15% is A LOT when you take into account ping and quick peeking.
---
&gt; Also, in your example of Finka you forgot to mention that her gadget affects the teamates around her in a fairly large area.
---
True, and yet she is underpicked and was suffering in win Delta for a whole season. She still is underpicked. It's simple. Her adrenaline boost is countered by smoke, who's a near guaranteed pick on defense, and that makes Finka unplayable. Her barbed wire speed was too powerful and was nerfed. And her alpha stage speed boost was cancelled out because of how powerful it would make even if a 2 armour had 25% more speed.
---
&gt; I have my very justifiable reasons for why its plausible and your response is just that its trash without any sort of valid response.
---
1- I NEVER called it trash. I called it "not possible". My words were "no, thanks", "OP", and "try understanding the armour-speed balance"
---
2- my responses were valid. And I continued to explain it to you while you choose to criticize my state of mind when I didn't target you in any way.
---
&gt; Try being a decent person in the community rather than calling others ideas garbage.
---
Not once did I call it even "close" to being garbage. You say I am indecent, yet I haven't targeted you at all, and I don't need to. I stayed within the boundaries of the conversation, which here is the idea, and EVEN NOW, I haven't called your idea "trash" or "garbage", nor used words even close to those. I've only told you it's state of being OP, when you choose to comment on an assumption of my state of mind by you.
---
I'm not in the wrong here. But as to who is, I'll not argue since that isn't the discussion here.
---
Im fine with ignoring their attempts to link Splinter Cell and Ghost Recon to R6 tho.
---
It would not take u a month for 25k renown it's more like a week of playing all day
---
Now you should be a Maverick DMR main.

i do indeed have an N word pass, ive obtained it from President Obama himself

Plat actually but what’s wrong with cav nothing u probably think she’s op too right
---
Nice. this is better than that angel one 
---
Exactly. It isn't fun for people to win like that considering I assume you surrender after going up 3-0
---
Yes, you can buy the year 4 pass on new years eve and receive every op for this year. I believe the charm/weapon skins are exclusive to preordering the yearly pass tho
---
Yes you would get new operators but no lava skins as that was only before 4th March 
---
Bro im level 152 in the same boat. It doesn't get any better.
---
Godly noob and pros play cav unironically so
---
I’m disappointed in myself,  I already use this and never thought of that joke
---
Well, you are right on what nationalities they are but the difference between CBRN Operators Lion and Finka to GSUTR Operators like Maverick and Clash is that Lion and Finka are/were a part of their respective CTUs (Lion belonging to French GIGN and Finka belonging to Russian Spetsnaz). Maverick and Clash on the other hand are sort of different with Maverick being a part of Delta Force and Clash being a part of the Metropolitan Police Service in London, which is why it wouldn't really make sense for Maverick as an example, to be a part of the FBI SWAT unit.
---
We just might be😱🤩😚
---
No, we make the games last as long as possible for clips
---
You are literally in the lowest rank possible don’t even front
---
This isn’t even bad. Literally said don’t play ranked. Who cares. 
---
Well, in my ideal scenario,  clash's background would have either be reworked for her to make sense as a delta force operator,  or she be introduced at a different time and a delta operator be inserted in her place, or Mavericks background make no mention of delta force and let me keep hope that they'll be bought in eventually 
---
Filthy op cav main
---
I’m not I’m plat 
---
Umm... No one knows. Delta Force isn't officially recognized, I don't think. They certainly don't have any public insignia.

Are you a spontaneously combusting Ramen… Asking for a friend.

Which is the lowest rank and probably on console too pleb

I honestly hope this post is sarcastic or u have to be a blind copper to think frost is op
---
I choose not to come up with ideas on the sub since ubi takes that decision themselves and doesn't look here for operator ideas. When ubi officially declares that they are interested in the sub's ideas, I will release the ones I've kept in my locker.
---
It didn't lack thought. I hope you read through it. People agreed that the "not tracking when moving" allows people to not be pinned down, and "not tracking as long as you step on a different spot" is also good, but "tracking when standing still" is a pretty big nerf, so the mistake was accepted, the idea was scrapped, and the discussion was closed.
---
I will choose not to continue on a discussion that has been closed. If you choose to do so, you may continue replying to this, and i won't answers. Because an accepted conclusion has already been drawn. There is no point in continuing a closed discussion, as it would be a waste of time for both of us.
---
I hope we can get back to your idea and your idea **ONLY**. Else, you are free to end the conversation with me right here. I will oblige.
---
Ok console player
---
Right and ur gonna say yur a diamond right

calling out those trash leavin thugs

Hence why he has a place on his arm where a patch should be? I feel like Maverick does fit in with the Delta force theme with being allowed to wear facial hair and dress in civilian like clothing.
---
[Castle disliked that]
---
Ok still better on console than u on pc nerd 
---
Yeah I’m plat on pc
---
You've acted the entire time lile I've said that this has to be put in the game, but it's just an idea and the operator has more downsides than upsides and also lacks utility. Which is why its an idea and also why it would never actually be used, but for some reason you can't let people write ideas without saying not possible. Let people express creativity. That's been my point for a while now. People post concepts for constructive critism not "not possible" or "no thanks."
---
Nice that’s a 24 hour or 1 week bad right there. Hope they don’t report you lol

castle is black so who cares

Urban camo does not work, period. “Urban camos” are usually developed to intimidate (i.e. look cool), such as the ATACS LE.  
---
But so is Obama

Okay so this is an *ideal* scenario but what about what we already have. What is wrong with Maverick? He seems like he does fit in being in Delta Force.

Wo*man*

*Man*

Wow english is sexist there is a man inside of every Wo*man*

(Or maybye it stands for "Hacker Hu*man*)

Why would you respond? Makes it worse because of the level of immaturity you chose to respond with. You can’t say “such a wonderful community” ironically then proceed to add to the toxicity 
---
please stop
---
Yep.
---
Definitely got the wrong game, mate.
---
True.
---
Which isn't going to happen because as pros have said, she's going to be insta banned this season in her current state.
---
What kind of heresy is this?
---
Okay you lost me. How do I have the wrong game?
---
Ranked and they don't even use headphones. I see 
---
I have been playin since release an i have 0 black ice you guy have it good

I love using jager with a bandit and mute, makes me want to kill myself when I'm against that without thatcher

Is it me or ash is faster than other 3 speeds?

i thought mozzie cosplay would be impossible! you’d have to chop your legs off to get to the right height.

Hello Risin_Phoenix, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b0wtmm/fix_toxicity/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
just think of all the deaths that could’ve been avoided if they either made callouts or had ears
---
I could be an outlier here after reading these comments, but she looks a lot uglier here. Old Mira was cute, now she looks like the ugly unibrow Russian woman from Dodgeball. 
---
As someone who stopped playing at the start of Y3 and started playing again just a few days ago. It’s certainly a mixed bag but overall good. 
---
I guess mira got nerfed
---
Oof
---
Yep 
---
She's either guaranteed ban now or guaranteed pick. Only 1 game where she wasn't banned.
---
They better balance her asap, or else it's going to be lion all over again.
---
yeah but they fixed that in the last patch, no me games fucked
---
My friends yell at me for always saying it in since with him lol
---
those guys are bots
---
Conflagurations~
---
And that would suck, I’d rather have old ela lol
---
I mean I still can get on it and have some fun, but idk what it is, I just feel like it’s lost something to it
---
Well that’s what you get when you peak corners for 2:30 and only attempt to push in the last 30 seconds. 
---
Nah just need to get kicking on those quantum entangled routers.

Mozzie is a fucking dick though. But yeah it’s still enjoyable.

Yeah you ash oof bc your acog got got

Oh boy more skins that barely anyone is ever going to own. I’d feel like I’m wasting my damn time if I was on the art team.

Definitely not. The lock on is too hard.

And yogurt 
---
No problem. Need any big fucking holes?
---
But the idea is to block flanks, not to do it aggressivly most of the time. If you want to balance her in some way don't do it like that. Personally i don't play her that much so idk

#I'm just saying that r6s is not for kids like the 2 games you cited so nobody wants flashy planet destroyers as gun

I don’t mind where they have it, but make it so it doesn’t knock me out of cover when we’re dueling

Still haven't gotten one from the regular alpha packs and im level 100 lmfao

SEE! WE CAN LEARN AS WELL AS A GERMAN!

It’s called “Packing”.

Looks kind of like the Hemorrhage skin. Hard to believe that was a year ago geez

You literally have said nothing but

&gt;you're dumb

If there was anything worth replying to I would have.
---
Yea, but this game encourages creativity, and it’s effective, so people are going to play the way that they want... And I don’t blame them for that... The gadget just needs some tweaking 
---
The lesion one is called “Packing” if anyone was wondering :)
---
I think he meant vigil is by far the best roamer in the game only jager rival's him due to his high impact on the game .
---
What’s wrong with grom tac? It’s better then stupid fucking hats.

Holy shit that looks crazy good, wish it was for the M4 and I could get it....

That's the whole point of her gadget

I'll share it with you only via DM.

Sure

Have you tried updating your PC?

Considering this isn't the real Hackerman?

She may prefer the term chancla

I still wear all my bright yellow suits from the packs just to show people where I’m at. That way I have an excuse to complain that I’m shit

Eh, its not bad but dmrs will never be anywhere near the top with the one hit mechanic

Rose Thorn looks pretty nice.

It works better with the compensator.

Me waking up and realising this...

Ah well. That happens.

Ew what she looks like a mum

It’s not even that, I just can’t get into it like I tried playing it but it’s just not fun to me 
---
The Roman seasonal skin from para bellum can go on shields
---
For some odd reason I feel like ranked got easy to level up this season.  Or it might just be cuz I got use to 5 elo a match from playing 500 ranked games last season lmao. 
---
The fan prob hates this game as we do too.
---
thats not good
---
Name checks out
---
Wow all the other ones were just crappy recolours I like that you put some thought into this one have a upvote 
---
On the bright side all dat renown for duplicates to put towards your next 50 alpha pack bundle
---
He’s just got really good guns and a very powerful ability, it’s really easy to sneak up on the enemy team using drones, making him 3 speed would be way too much unless they severely nerfed his guns 
---
&gt;740 isn't a lot, 43 is the normal damage for most rifles... it's not an smg. It's not so powerful, many guns can beat it,
---
43 in conjunction with 740 while on defense is the issue. You can't look at each piece and say it's not that bad. When you combine all pieces, the puzzle is some very, very ugly. 
---
&gt;Look at Bandit's mp7. Much higher rpm, same kill time but better headshot mechine cause higher rpm, has a bit more recoil. Mira: Stupid rpm, lower damage tho but good time to kill still. Headshot mechine, not so bad recoil.
---
RPM is not what's most important. DPS is what's most important. my complaint is not about Jager's RPM; it's about his DPS for a defensive operator. 
---
Or you could join mine lol looking to replace a person on my team ?
---
This is so sad. Alexa, play Despacito.

Your IQ looks different than mine. From what I read in the comments I guess there are two types of chibi figures? Nice collection :)

Do you think removing Maetro's ACOG would would make him balanced?

Either that or give him less ammo

It's better than her vintage motorcycle helmet, but I think the S.I. headgear is her best.

But everybody is playing Apex and not just kids? Guarantee if you search on Twitch everybody you see playing Apex is over 20. But whatever, try to harvest what you can from this pointless argument.
---
Anyway, my main point was that this skin would look so much cooler if they actually changed the model a bit and made those bumps and grooves that look like they’re engraved actually be engraved.
---
That is ugly as shit
---
I’ve been playing since Red Crow(hibana and echo) and I have one black ice. Very sad about that
---
I was just opening a pack after a match expecting a common, but bam! I got a new level 4 helmet instead, it truly is epic.
---

Still got kill in 1 headshot.

Sometime I question about life.

i would but i have a friend on my team already &amp; i dont wanna get his hopes up 😬 sorry man

This in my opinion is one of the best quotes in the game

Windowed borderless

That's a cool headgear! But who tf says yellow when talking about rarity? ew
---
That's sexist

Lol as my smurf slides into newcomer server's 😂.

Mine have been bugged for months, Ubisoft and PS support both say its my problem. Feelsbadman

Needs more moss
---
In all seriousness, do you not see a flaw in the logic of thinking that whether someone is new to siege has to do with whether a particular gun in siege is balanced? My fellow Redditor, please tell me we agree on that, at least. No? 
---
Like the LFT tags ? TIL
---
I like the dapper outfit and matching head but that looks pretty cool too
---
Yeah... 
---
And yet we have the navy seals
---
1. Monty&gt;wooden barricade

2. They could just go through the Windows behind him
---
What's bad about this? It's cute
---
My audio settings is currently on Hi-Fi mode. I will try to reinstall the game I hope it fix the problem.
---
Nope 
---
Siege is a more “competitive” game and this would brake it even more
---
Just don’t over estimate the siege devs they brake a lot of thing while add things 
---
&gt; level 4 helmet
---
Level 4 (Legendary): Decreases total headshot damage by 25%. 
---
Bonus passive [FAST CHARGE] : Reduces Tactical &amp; Ultimate recharge time.
---
Can we get a park ranger op fr tho? 
---
Primary: Remington 700
---
Secondaries: bear spray (only works on 1 speed male operators) or bug spray (only works against mozzie)
---
Gadgets: canteen or granola bar
---
Unique gadget: summon smokey the bear (equipped with an M2 flamethrower) to "educate" the enemy team about the dangers of "forest fires".

You have 30 black ice camos? Dont conplain please :( you’re lucky

Post #143
---
Holy fucking shit i want it
---
You didn't ask if it was balanced. You asked why it was so powerful. You understand that my fellow reddior, don't you?
---
That's nice that you didn't get 1v5 slaughtered every round
---
Snort gfuel
---
Oh man the double layered castle sounds so good. Your point about sledge actually makes me think sledge is sort of like pre nerf twitch, but not as powerful. I’ve had games where I’ve run out of buck skeleton key shots but never have I even come close to using half the hammers uses. I think sledge could do with a 20-40% decrease in hammer uses, not necessarily because it’s op, but as the game stands right now, the amount of uses the hammer has is so high l, in most matches it’s “infinite”
---
hehe sledge
---
r/w
---
Thank you.
---
And it’s almost always a Mira doing the tk, like I know your gadget works best with certain reinforced/Soft wall combos but don’t blast me with the vector if you even see me look at your wall.
---
Have you done esl yet just wondering.  Cuz they dont play around in tournaments if you dont have a 5 stack that practices alot in the higher elos your going to get clapped by all the 5 stack plat and diamonds level 250 through 400 plus . Its worse then rank complete slaughter fest if you plat 3 and lower.

Not trying to kill your confidence just want you to be aware 😎👍

If youre going to use your phone to do it at least turn it sideways

Are you a child?

I've it and I like it :) 
---
I know but he asked if you get the operators if you buy the season pass and that bundle is basically the season pass the special operator skins etc you don't get but you get the ops
---
No, i don't know that. I was never confirmed by ubi that attackers will have better weapons. SMGs are usually higher fire rate but they are mostly designed for close range combat, which is why ACOG on smg is broken cause it gives it long range fight ability. Rifles are for medium or longer range combat. Just because Jager has a rifle doesn't mean he is op or too good. If you think he is tho then K it's YOUR opinion, but most of the community doesn't think like that
---
Oh really? That’s cool. I haven’t play casual since White Noise. Yeah, you should be able to take defuser especially if you can pick spawns now. 
---
I'm bout to reach 800h and no legendaries, terrible luck i guess
---
Ohok
---
The tavernier is one of the first legendarys, hence why its shitty. Its got a cool shiny texture overlay though.
---
You can’t tell me urban camp doesn’t work. My father even sent me pictures of a sniper with urban camo sitting on rocks just 10 meters away from the camera and it took me 2 minutes to spot him. Also urban camo on vehicles is a different issue. The patterns drawn isn’t meant to hide the vehicle. It’s meant to disorient the enemy by making him unable to clearly see the shape of it, therefore to distinguish its trajectory and distance. And since ww1 this type of camo was proven itself super effective not only on great distances but even on medium. 
---
Reporting on console needs a revamp. 
---
Yeah, I think this guy that I was spectating didn’t like not having acog 
---
Rocks=\=urban environment
---
There is a bug in January that you can see all the collection of alpha packs and the total is 457 that time 
---
Go with your personal taste buddy. Personally I feel elites for my most played ops and pro league sets for teams I support or skins that are extra nice. You do you buddy
---
if it looks cooler, its better

He said a very bad word on his stream. That's the reason I was told he didn't come back. I saw the clip of him saying it and he immediately knew he had fucked up.

Quality
---
So would a csgo like trading system
---
You never had more than 7000 renown? That makes me sad dude. 
---
They’re victims of colonization
---
Urban means buildings right? Buildings are made mostly from cement. Anyways if you think a veterans opinion doesn’t mean anything in warfare tactics you can do a little research on your own. But you can’t say camo is useless. On any occasion. 
---
wait crap skyscraper was Red Crow my bad :/ still cool though. 
---
Plz no tower has the big gay
---
That’s Australia for you. It would be easier but I glitched from gold to bronze with one loss
---
inb4 "wtf this isnt even flaming neon pink and animated. Not a legendary".
---
Only thing I don’t like about her is that it makes you face the blast and I feel like that adds a bit of most likely unintended disorientation. I’d just like there to be multiple animations so that if it goes off behind you, it throws you on your stomach and when you stand up, you’re looking the same way. 
---
I would trade all of legendarys including my doge charm for that black ice f2. I think I'm at about 7-8 lengendarys probably a few more but yeah.
---
And there’s not only one type of urban camo. It has to match the city’s architecture every time. But most cities are based on cement colors. 
---
Depends. I think some elite sets SUCC and all pro league sets are good, so some operators are hard to choose from. Ash Hibana and Valk are my hardest choices. Ops that have bad elite sets (in my opinion) i just prefer the pro league set.
---
Flustered doc

He wasn’t a very good caster and kixstar had problems with him

---
I feel like I remember getting a black ice for a gun ... But for an operator I didn't own and I don't even know where to start looking for it, if it even exists outside my figment of my imagination
---
Exactly what I thought since skins came out! 
---
Would be cool if rainbow had theater mode, for things like this
---
Hypochondria is the power house of the cell
---
Wait, all of this stuff is not visible in operators menu? You can't buy for credits yhis headgear for example?
---
Looks like Jessie J
---
Ha, my bad. I'm leaving it just for your comment though.
---
Oh well, time to play ranked then
---
EMERELDU SPLASHUU
---
They said all of that was coming Year 4, nothing about Season 1, not listening to what they were saying is your fault dude. 
---
50 packs aren't much, in 100 packs you get around 3 legendaries, so they can still come
---
You clearly didnt listen at all at the invitational as they said exactly when everything is coming. And as of burnt horizon ranked is still in beta... The changes come in season 2
---
&gt;30 black ices
---
i have 1000+ hours and i only have unboxed 1 black ice and it was a pistol.
---
I want the Space Martian more than anything, it's absolutely gorgeous! 
---
Haha, well as soon as i get 4500 renown I buy an alpha pack. I dont save up and buy in bulk (which would be the smart thing to do). And I bought all ops with R6 credits.
---
Most of the epics are better than the legendaries. Change my mind.
---
You can buy some but not all of them, it doesn't really make sense
---
Smoke weed everyday🎤
---
Pretty sure it's a reference to the film Volver. 
---
they said lion and pick and ban is coming next season, listen and than trash talk, and capitao got reversed back because he was way to op on the test server, get your facts before flaming
---
Surprisingly Mandela's Illuminati space lasers had nothing to do with it, I was thinking of the pre-alpha acog.  
---
Well here in Oz, an old joke is to introduce someone you dont like to your "friends" Des and Troy (right and left hand). Put them together and what does it spell? Thats why I'm really interested in the Italian version 😅
---
Thank you, it means a lot to me and my awful confidence ::3. I have an old comic that im going to start inking, it may get more attention maybe
---
I kinda like it tho....
---
Siege loves to do it a lot. Some days you'll be trash, some days you are the new pengu
---
Yeah, I feel like this would make Castle for starters a much more dynamic operator. Maybe halve the punches needed to kill the barricades or something. Perhaps 8 punches would be enough.
---
favela with plane and yacht the best
---
Do you know how many times I’ve been killed by rook or doc coz they sit in dark corners? Or how many times I’ve killed lion and finka coz they are pretty much moving targets lol. A decent dark colored camo is helpful even in this close quarter game. Also I said i want it coz it would be cooler and more appropriate, not more effective. 
---
I have almost 2500 hours. but I feel your pain. 
---
Np fam
---
opend over 500 alpha packs and only got shit black ice, luck 9000
---
Honestly, the map is awful in every way, even for Casual. 
---
I personally would never want to see it reintroduced. 
---
And its just clapitao's lmg with smaller mag and quicker reload
---
Portuguese might be my first language, but it doesn't mean that I must only speak 1 language 
---
I mean in gameplay context it could matter a little, besides u could’ve bought the blood orchid uniform for that purpose
---
Yes, I understand your point. Rushing out \*is\* a problem on Skyscraper, maybe it isn't suitable for ranked, but I find it quite fun in casual.
---
&gt;  I and pretty much everyone I know, only speak Portuguese
---
:thonking:
---
We have the same bad luck, i got it for the SASG
---
Plot twist: OP unlocked all legendaries before
---
When they first upload the tts for people to try out and open alpha packs, the knights helmet was actually a uncommon.
---
It astounds me to why they would have made it a Legendary charm
---
(I’ll provide an image later it’s 3am atm)
---
Yno I don’t like it but I like it at the same time
---
"Helm"
---
Yeah it would certainly add to the learning curve above everything else, which may not be a good thing haha.
---
Killing Floor 2 is by far the best game when it comes to weapon animations. 
---
... exept me of course, do you want me to prove it?
---
Pick and ban comes next season. I believe the lion change comes next season. Capitao was overpowered in tts so i think they made the correct move and didnt implement it until they get it right. I imagine they are being prudent and making sure they release things when they are ready.
---
And from where siege was at the beginning to where ubisoft has been able to take it, i think theyve done a pretty admirable job. Not perfect but theyve been consistent about improving the game bit by bit.
---
I wasn't playing yet back then, but my partner says the same. That before the game became mainstream, its atmosphere was much more friendly, and without toxicity.
---
And  there's DUPLICATES, seriously Ubisoft
---
Shitty phrasing, i know
---
What rank are you? Or what rank have you been in previous seasons? 
---
Did you start with this sens, or adjust over time? How long did it take? Is it as consistent in MP? 
---
but it's not worth it though, i used to get 500 a game without boosters, this guy's using boosters and doing boring ass t-hunt
---
Cool
---
Exactly my thought 
---
MMR MEANS 
---
Match
---
Making
---
Rating.
---
Not a currency, not a reward.
---
It’s a RATING. 
---
This was stated when ranked first started, out of Ubisoft themselves. This is the case with every ranked mode in every game.
---
If you’re Silver, and say you get boosted to Diamond...and you get placed in a  Diamond game, you’re gonna have a horrible game. You’re not gonna fit in to that skill rating. 
---
It’s intended so that you have quality matches, not to brag to your friends. 
---
Have a browse around [R6Guides](https://r6guides.com).
---
That's somewhat better. Most people despise getting BI on the S90 because it can be purchased separately, and is the only renown-purchasable black ice.
---
I was going to say somthing like this, if you are playing longer angles then using the shotgun is putting yourself at a disatvantage using the smg11 or shotgun.

Can i ask is there a problem with discovery casual im new playing an its hard to get a game on the outback map? 
---
As far as I know they never were.
---
Looks seriously sick, what did you use for the gun? Airsoft?
---
I think they changed it so if you buy the regular version, you need to buy the base operators. But it's only a few hundred renown for them
---
They were on ps4 some time ago
---
It would seem that the marketing team and the art team don’t talk at all.

Impressive work! I especially like your line work.
---
you have to open alot and not a few

Wonder what the body part be like?

they buffed the damage and recoil recently

for noobs

I would say so, IIRC it's the same in Overwatch and CSGO.

wow, don’t you see it’s in quotation marks?

No they changed that

All I’ve gotten is commons mainly and gun skins 🙄
---
Zofia would like a word with you.
---
Not my post.
---
It is the top car park which you can access from the ladder at parking front spawn. You can see through the big windows from there. OP is looking the other way in the pic.
---
The post is showing off what the new AR15 50 DMR legendary skin looks like in game aside from viewing it from the inventory.
---
Anyone else think these are dumb? It's just a recolor of the operator icon
---
smg 11 used to be a sniper, acog gone and now more damage little more recoil. bad players can’t use it 
---
Their reddit handle is literally in the image, how much more lazy could you get?

R.I.P ACOG

Someone please make a very fat Habana crushing through a wall like the kool aid man with this caption
---
ADHD is a huge disadvantage when you wanna become any sort of military or executive personnel so I doubt he got into R6 with ADHD. 
---
bb shield is glitched too.... it wont protect your head for some reason
---
thatch awesome Ty, ill probably pick it up. how much are the operators? vie been reading there pretty fairly priced
---
Black ice for the l8 was one of my firs apha packs i ever got. Never realized it was a nice skin for months.
---
Because Ubi has to put that on EVERY gun in the game, with that amount of detail it would take a pretty long time.
---
I thought of that as well, but Plat on PC with Controller? Unless his Controller aim is really REALLY good, it's unlikely
---
Same. Tho i think it's the earrings's fault.
---
Qualify content for the sub I see.

Where are the D R U G S ?

---
Lmfao. Mnk Smurfs are all over siege on console. You even find them in copper territory. Besides they also have to rank up, and whoever faces them gets the L. 
---
They've just nerfed it too much it's almost there for cosmetics, thanks though clip was going too fast to see 
---
On PC, you have a "suggested friends" section which is a list of the people who you've played with
---
Hah, happened to me as well, made sure to make larger holes the following times to reduce/nullify the risk of it happening again.
---
Seems like they updates some contents...
---
SEEK DES AND TROY! \m/
---
What's wrong? I don't see any sexual implications here at all, can anybody explain?
---
Start off by doing situations, you learn how all the basic operators are supposed to be played and you get enough renown to buy a Y1 DLC operator 
---
Well I do think they just wanted to be 110% sure before launching. Start of a year should be great with a great many new things, but if there's 1 season's delay to be sure that the releases are perfect, then it better be worth the wait
---
So yes they can, and they probably don't think about it, but my team 100% would have someone on top of roof above Bedroom Window watching Kids room window. So when they jumped out, they'd die anyhow.
---
For the cheapest I think it starts at around 5-10 thousand but not entirely sure. 
---
the animated icons are actually cool and need effort unlike this shit
---
¿Mama?
---
Well I’ll give it a shot
---
you're gonna get launched trough the floor
---
Eloooooooooooooooooooo
---
Because they need to design seasonal skins for all weapons
---
If the attacking team was smart that wouldn't work anyhow, they'd have someone in position to watch that rotation.
---
it stays like this for 1 second then the mirror pops out afaik
---
I think there is someone there in the video but this is casual anything can happen
---
Isn’t Mira 40 years old tho?
---
I admit she looks late 40s in this head hear tho
---
Good time. Great game.
---
Wishing you a warm Welcome to the community, in advance.
---
Elooooooooooo Martini
---
Lol none of those muppets had the brain cells to go around from the master bedroom window🤣🤣
---

---
I thought she was mid 30's, haven't really looked at her bio. 
---
Roof? Nah, it will crush you straight into the floor looney tunes style
---
She looks like an emo kid who started cutting hers
---
Possibly, I got a legendary for the vector the other day and it basically just swapped the colors.
---
I'm spending no money because there is no bundle to insta buy the ops I want to play with I grinded all the ops y1 and y2 with renown as a starter edition ... So I said I'm just gonna buy the y3 ones , why are they fucking over  anyone who wants them? 
---
Looks great. Solid, actually.
---
Just that the housing itself takes up so much frikking space.
---
Should have brought smoke. Smoke is super useful for Kids Room and Billiards on this map, and now that you can know spawn from OP pick, it's a good time to game the meta of certain maps.
---
Goes perfectly with the Sharkshot weapon skins on shotguns.
---
Daang. You wrote the whole word then you got lazy at the “et” . Why U No Complete ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)

---
you're gonna get smashed into another server
---
Not going to lie when I say Kaid, his shotgun is most likely on the list of weapons that will see a nerf eventually but man, it's great fun and probably the primary reason I play him, his utility is the second point but still.
---
Rook and Doc are on the list as the MP5 remains one of the better defender weapons available.
---
On attack it has to be Fuze for his AK, powerhouse of a gun that is just enjoyable to use, Jackal as well but for his PDW (odd choice I know) but it works really well and an extended mag is welcome.
---
Wait
---
How sure are you that he full stacks with silvers?
---
I play for around 1,5 years and I think I have 8 legendaries and I got 4 of them within 11 days but that was was months ago.
---
What I miss about console is being plat consistently. I've been playing for as many seasons now on PC and I'm stuck gold 2.
---
They are the ones who have to deal with both sides.

I don't think saying this is the best idea on a post that someone just changed the color from yellow to red is a good idea.
---
I’m glad the greedy frost got downed, I am not a fan when people steal aces

I’m not talking about the quality.

“This is epic” stands for “This looks cool”

Yeah but are you playing in realistic?
---
What? Wasn't this exactly same picture posted here some days ago?
---
I honestly think that it shouldn’t be banned, because if you just want to play ranked with your friends, it shouldn’t penalize you for being better than your friends. To discourage it, they should match your team to the highest rank on your team
---
Forgot to credit :)

When is coming any ideas because it's needed.

Wont fit the game, trust me. This skin inspect feature in CSGO is not only to check out the skin, but its also used to check the skin's pattern, whereas there is no such thing as a different skin pattern here in siege.

---
Recoil where art thou? 
---
After opening so many backs you should be guaranteed a epic with a higher chance of a legendary in that pack
---
Yeah, I've been running her as a sound blocker more than area denial. The are denial is just a bonus, even if the traps are destroyed easily. It makes any type of garage push hard as hell to prevent and retake.
---
I mean recoil wise the 9mm cl is pretty much a laser, just gotta aim for the head. 
---
Which means it’s also Kapkan’s smg...?
---
Both ranked and casual. The amount of mid match leaving is through the roof lately and it fucking sucks. It feels every game there is at least one person who leaves.
---
There was another guy in there
---
Acog in baricades
---
Year 1. We're on year 4. I expect support for a year. They wouldn't continue support if they stopped making money.
---
Sort of.... I think its only represented visually on kam but it has the same practical effect in game 
---
well last time i checked fighting in a building isn’t considered long range
---
Need more cocaine on the nose.
---
But the Jäger gadget of the Jäger chibi looks not like the real, and I hate that they mixed year 1 operator with the standard operator, so it gives a caveira chibi but no doc
---
Fun fact about 1962. The Cuban Missle Crisis between The United States, The USSR and Cuba occurred between Oct 16, 1962 and Oct 28, 1962.
---
is that relevant?
---
They should disable friendly fire during prep phase completely, that way if you know someone is trying to tk you, you can run away in time
---
Never forgotten, never forgiven.
---
Now all I'm thinking of is two new operators who are park rangers and their abilities are animals
---
Because seasonal camos 3-4 I’ll say, are each mapped for over 100 different guns so that’s over 400 guns to individually map skins too, quality over quantity my friend

You can't really have a ranked system where there's an out to avoiding elo loss because then friends will take turns vote kicking themselves before a loss to avoid elo deduction.

There's really no way to do it without making it game-able.

You're not it's inspired by a graffiti on the Berlin wall

nope. i’m serious. recruit is used to troll more than used for fun. recruit needs removed. you can have just as much fun with any operator

If you're running a compensator, and a reflex, but have trained yourself to know exactly how much to pull down on the stick, then yeah, that gun pretty much becomes a laser. He's probably just really good, and has put a lot of time into the game. If not, and he is cheating, then that's some guilt he will have to live with.  
---
Yes and no, 1st and 3rd person view and models are vastly different, specially the prone one, it squishes on 3rd person so it doesn't clip through desks for example and to compensate for it in 1st person it has a really weird FoV, and looking at other models that are not you really accentuate the difference.
---
Doing this with butterfly knife is satisfying

I guess

Play on hard or realistic then. Less trolls

Not enough cocaine

I agree but... there is a limit for bad accuracy in both casual and ranked.

Yeah I've been playing ranked and getting team killed every game almost, or a squad of 2 are shooting all of us putting us at 20hp and they just do that over and over, or just troll for 2 rounds and then surrender. Same people over and over, my UplayID is "Exotiqk-." Minus the "" If you wanna play sometime.

This reminds me of so many easy access when a whole team decides to spawn together

Oh I see! That’s a good idea!

Tower is a good fun map, too bad its not buffed for ranked. Like more soft floors and a less maze-like first floor.

The acog tho...

You have to go to the weapon skin tab in the store to see it, it’s for Mozzie’s gun. You can’t see it if you check his gun in the operator tab tho.

No,there wasn't. after first shot u can clearly see a blood pattern

His holds more rounds IIRC

I don’t have many friends that play Siege and most of them don’t play them on PC, and even then we really don’t play that often. Even if I did then a forgiveness system would be better for everyone, it’d be your choice to use it, the fact that you have that choice is the whole point.

**TIS IST A KONTROLL**
---
Things that improved my consistency in Rainbow the last year:  
---
1. Lots of terrorist hunts to get more attuned to movement and gunplay (pushed myself a lot running into rooms with 4 terrorists and attempting to flick them all dead). This also can serve as a warmup before going into games. You warm up on lots of other things requiring skill, aiming shouldn't be an exception.  
---
2. Making sure I'm comfortable sitting and playing, including making sure my game sensitivity actually helped me (I didn't realize until I actually was mindful about it how much extra work I was making myself do to lock onto targets)  
---
3. Making sure my mouse and mousepad are high quality and fine tuned (I had a heavy ass naga before that would sometimes catch on my mousepad which was disintegrating)  
---
4. Developing a healthy consistent lifestyle including exercise in real life (honestly helps a lot on the mental side of things, I make better choices and tend to be able to predict my enemy better with a clear head and a non-upset tummy)  
---
5. Keeping in the mindset that I still have things to learn every day and to try and take being outplayed as an opportunity to learn, if you feel like you are just losing fights you shouldn't be, I would check the other steps.  
---
I still have games where I potato and do nothing, but they are further in between than they were and I feel a lot more confident on my aim nowadays. That being said, I'm still a filthy casual so take everything I say with a grain of salt.  
---
I’ve thought of there being an operator that could get hatches from under also, I think it’s a good idea.
---
Nah, this isn't indicative of anything with the new season.  From this clip that could have just as easily been Capitao last season.  Gridlock has the same gun and same scope with just slightly less ammo than Capitao.
---
Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't really tell because all I really saw are the eyes. But it looks amazing! Great work!
---
This has been discussed already and general consensus is that they are visible enough, there's quite a bright blue light on them and as someone who's yet to unlock mozzie I've noticed them quite often when moving round the map
---
that was not the problem in this case... they were all just dumb.
---
No need for apologies it’s ok to not know everything 
---
I'd love the Tavor, I hope she doesn't get a pre existing gun like Gridlock got and Lion and Finka, But I feel like the Danish attacker will get new guns completely although I could be wrong and she has 1 new gun and 1 pre existing gun.
---
Yup. Its something with my internet cuz when i used a vpn it worked but using vpn is a nope. It also happens in casual sometimes but ranked more  than casual
---
I dont know how people can use this when it blocks half the screen and the reflex is so much better
---
FO-12 is not underrated. It's fucking insane. One of the best shotguns in the game. 
---
Just want to clarify that my mic wasn't working properly so that's not me getting all hyped near the end
---
Yes. Helps you get the hang of the different tempo. For terrorist hunt there’s a online and line wolf option 
---

Thanks mate lol.
---
Believe and u can achieve
---
&gt;The current system of earning and losing points does not make a bit of sense. With every game you play, you earn or loose less points every time. This system has several flaws. For one only the first 15-20 matches really matter if you want to get a good rank. From there on you only get/loose a few points, which makes you stuck in your rank almost permanently. And with every new match you get punished even more for trying to rank up. Why would a game developer punish it's consumers for playing it's game? R6 is the only game I know of which uses this system.
---
From a game-to-game perspective, this viewpoint makes sense. However, it completely disregards the bigger picture of the ranking system. The goal of the ranking system is to find the rank that most reflects your ability to contribute to your team winning rounds in the current meta. If the system is doing it's job correctly, if every player is in the correct rank for their skill level, every match should be roughly a coin flip. Thus, a win or two doesn't automatically indicate you should be ranked higher and a loss or two doesn't mean you're overmatched either.
---
The system handles this through a variable called uncertainty. The higher the uncertainty value, the larger your ELO gains and losses will be. As you play more matches, the system learns more about how you are performing in the current meta and the uncertainty value decreases. However, even once you reach a fairly stable uncertainty value, the calculation is sensitive to winning and losing streaks. If you can run off 5, 6, 7 wins in a row, your uncertainty value will rise and you'll start seeing more ELO per win. However, it also means that once you lose, you'll lose more ELO as well to ensure you didn't just get a few fluky wins.
---
&gt;Just make it that you get the same amount of points for every won/lost game, plus maybe a few points extra if you played extraordinarily good (measured relative to the points you received the game before)
---
Awarding the same amount of points for every won/lost game isn't very useful to ensuring teams stay within their actual rank. If you have a team that is just a bad match for your team and you win up getting matched against them in 3 out of 4 games, that could easily drop you out of your current rank or elevate them to the next rank. However, being able to farm ELO off your team doesn't mean they really belong in the next level, and your team isn't necessarily out of place in general in your current rank.
---
Adding individual performance bonuses would be an absolutely disaster for the game. Such a change would instantly create incentives for players to make plays that aren't the strategically correct play if that play would leave ELO on the table. It also would unfairly discount any immeasurable actions by players (callouts, watching the right angles, etc.) as not contributing to the team's success.
---
&gt;Cancel the game, like in CS:GO or if a player gets disconnected mid-game, call it a draw and give everyone just a fraction of the usual amount of points.
---
If the player leaves early in the first round, I'm okay with canceling the game and moving on with your day. But allowing players to avoid potential ELO losses mid-game by having a single teammate disconnect would be abused to no end. It sucks to play short handed, but it isn't the enemy team's fault your teammate disconnect, yet they would be punished for such an action by severely deducting the ELO they earn from the match.
---
&gt;Make it that you can choose at the start of every season if you want to get ranked normally or if you want to start at Copper 4 and grind your way up.
---
I get what you're trying to solve, and I agree that deranking to copper 4 is a problem. But the primary motivation people have for deranking isn't so they can work their way up to the top. They're doing it to game the matchmaking system to get easier matches for one reason or another. Even once they reach copper 4, after so many wins, they'll need to take some losses to stay in copper 4. Thus, while you could potentially avoid some collateral damage from those players on the way down with your suggestion, the actual problem would still exist. I'd much rather they focus on a nearly innumerable list of things before they worked on solving this problem.
---
Sure the SMG could do the same but it would have been much more difficult. The recoil on that gun is fucking retarded
---
Thought it was for mozzies gun but I couldn't find  it first. Thanks for the help!

But I thought you could just aim and lean even with mouse and keyboard

High learning curve but if you’ve played CS you should have a ok time adjusting in the aim department. It takes a minuet to learn all the maps operators strats and metas, but pretty soon you’ll get to a point where you can identify operations by sound which won’t take more than a month of playing. They just added a new mode aside from ranked and casual called newcomer, you being a previous go player probably won’t need it in the aim department but it’s good for learning the 3 core maps Bank, Chalet, and Consulate. If your looking for a challenge and a Tati always game that’s really fun to play with a squad then you would definitely have fun with this game. I’ve been play r6 since year 1 and though it one of my favorite multiplayer FPS games I kinda wanna get into Cs but I know nothing about it :/
---
What do u think of cs?
---
I made peace with my acog
---
It works well. 
---
He has a pregnant wife.
---
You can see a Picture with his pregnant Wife on the official Ubi R6 Website were you can read his Lore.
---
I think it’s a glitch cause there’s been time throughout all my time playing siege back in black ice, that I’ll lean with out aiming but only a very quick lean 
---
Oh, ik they are similar, I am from Brazil. Im just saying that in this case it wouldn't work, because the word for sandals in pt is chinelo, not chancla
---
Go to the official r6 discord people are always there willing to play
---
Does black ice go with all the operators or just operators from that operation along with the of ops?
---
Most people who play this never touched the old games, it would be fun if two of them were added as a call back 
---
Ok thank u so much 
---
Im just wondering if its just the model or the Hitbox thats bad
---
before the recoil nerf i was an G36 guy but the rc4 with red dor is pretty good.
---
Damn man I can’t resist the urge right when I get 4.5k I just buy one. Good luck on your rolls man!
---
Get ready to get kicked out of the game for no reason and get team killed because you are low level and a beginner. Learn fast so you can escape maximum toxicity that is casual gaming and move on to ranked for more serious players.
---
Maybe he was t cocky? Maybe he has points turned off or was just having a bit of fun
---
I doc enemies when I down them sometimes for the fun of it even if it’s in ranked and the match seems to be heavily leaning one way
---
Unless you’re playing the game professionally, remember that you’re playing to have fun
---
I usually solo queue since my friends don’t play as much, helps if some of the teammates have kids. I always felt like I got straight bots for teammates but once I got to gold 3/2 people started being half decent and usually there’s at least a couple guys on the mic 
---
i don’t get why they don’t pick up on these glitches when they test. and if they do, why aren’t they fixing them quick enough 
---
Lmaoo I love that
---
Gridlock cracks open a bottle whilst Mozzie goes ham on his bike
---
Most unnecessary flex I've seen in a while. 
---
Who cares about skins? 
---
Even the legendary are bad anyway
---
I personally would like an elite skin for alibi and jackal 
---
I got Black Ice for IQ's second AR at level 30 something and then for the MP5 at 60
---
Can someone confirm if it's old? Double checking ty! :)
---
No matter how hard we try, we cant escape black ice.
---
I had my eye on Mozzie, but I bought Alibi instead. So far, no regrets. 
---
I thought something was wrong... oof
---
Nice, do you have an image?
---
Hey man no shame in being carried, all depends what kind of role you play on a team! You could roam and get 2-3 kills a round or you can be a solid anchor that gets maybe kill but you’re doing your job 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Would you like all 5 enemies to sit I the bomb sites?
---
Operation health Best operation 
---
Feels bad
---
Thanks, will update as soon as possible
---
It might be worth considering your overall setup.
---
On newer gfx cards that get high frames, a lot of people have trouble maintaining constant frames without drops and micro stutter. I was able to fix this mostly on my setup by enabling g-sync (I have a freesync compatible 144hz monitor), enabling v-sync, setting a frame limit to 141 frames in the siege ini file, and setting a custom fan curve so my gpu core boost stays stable (it will vary based on core temp) at about 63-65 degrees.
---
honestly hate it when someone shoots you for no reason every time, they always run off but i make sure they will watch the rest of the round spectating. if it was accident then don’t run away.
---
I think it’s just a graphics glitch, the hitboxes are corrected
---
This ^ 
---
But that's also not stopping me from berating teammates who try to reinforce kids bedroom.
---
Same there no refund for us /u/Ubi-Ludo 
---
How am I a one trick pony?
---
i just got a legendary from  my FIRST alpha pack, it was a shitty devil legendary charm (on a smurf btw)
---
Pas faux pas faux , pour des trucs simples j'avoue qu'ils ont pas d'excuses mais pour des skins épiques , la surface est plus grande que sur une arme donc c'est sûrement plus compliqué

---
Probably wont happen. They make alot of revenue off those skins and they are meant to be rare.
---
Bc coding and shit takes a lot of time and effort to fix it. Bugs need to be replicated by the dev team, so they can sort out the reason for this issue. This can take weeks sometimes. 
---
O P E R A T I O N H E A L T H
---
Knife skins!!
---
I’d honestly prefer that, because it’d be easier to come up with a plan to head to the objective and then root the enemies out. I feel like roamers make putting together any decent plan of attack impossible, which is my main problem with them 
---
depends on the map but r4c 99% of the time. if you pick the weaker gun might as well pick a different op
---
Well, I did some research and found out the Jaegercorps use 5 different categorys, pistols, smgs, machine guns, light support weapons and a sniper.  Here are the weapons they use listed : pistols : Glock 26,USP,Sig Sauer P210 and a Tactical 5.0. SMGS : MP5,G53 C8 CQB and a C8 SFW. LSW : LSW M/04. Machine Guns :  23 E, MG3 and a 21 E. Sniper : MSG-90. I'm making another comment on what guns the frogmen use (I don't want this comment to be very long)
---
I have a 1070 OC that is new. I am going to keep an eye on FPS and Temps. I will set the frame limit to 61 as I only have a 60Hz monitor and see if that helps. Thanks for the tips 
---
*BANG*
---
(OpHealth didn't actually fix anything and was just a veiled excuse for not having the Polish season done lol)
---
Give me back my armor &gt;:( 
---
I have video proof. I got this guy in my placements . And who gets 7K MMR in a season and 8kd in burnt horizon already
---
this is ubisoft, not ea
---
thats weird, never saw that one, I do see my entire team leave though,, which does concern me greatly
---
Lmao they can be bought in almost any other game, and grinding 20k renown is not easy. Being lucky doesnt mean that it is hard to obtain lol.
---
Did you even for a second, think about what other ways they are going to make money to provide content and pay the wages of those who maintain and develop the game? No you didn't your first thought was "I dont wanna spend cash on this game, gimme elites for free".. elite sets, pro league sets and season pass are the only avenues of direct income for the game outside of base game purchase. they will never be purchasable with renown. 
---
Toxic teammate 
---
I’m definitely using it on Glaz because it looks tactical as shit
---
nah the only thing that matters is winning or losing. how you get there is irrelevant. 
---
No, no.  You had one job, just the one.  
---
Lol. Don't slow peek like that!
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/336573181144072192/555737138331779083/image0.jpg
---
My point still applies. Just because they are monetizing off cosmetics doesn’t mean they are EA. 
---
They should give us the option to buy it with renown plus the ingame store still hasn’t been fixed and I contacted support about it and they are like they are looking into it....
---
By checking rooms and droning you should have no problem finding roamers, for runouts you just learn where they come from and keep an eye there, spawn peakers can be disuaded by pinging them woth a drone at the end of prep 
---
I exclusively play solo casual on pc, only hostage and biohazard (i can’t stand playing bomb). I also don’t have a mic, if that’s relevant. I have about 200 hours in the game, and don’t have a rank/mmr to judge my skill off of since I’ve never played ranked (figure there’s no point since I don’t have a mic)
---
Doesnt matter, they just want profit
---
Bold of you to assume we have guns
---
I used to be a blitz main but stopped because it was super annoying on my side as well as in the enemy’s side
---
That’s incredible!!!
---
That's scary af
---
Its definitely an odd issue so I hope ubisoft has some insight for them.
---
down the rabbit hole 
---
Not new, i got it maybe 3 months ago

Still waiting on that Shamal headgear!!
---
Remove this low effort post. If you explained why you have that opinion and created discussion, this would actually be a good post.
---
If you are gaming at 60hz I would recommend trying vsync on (in the NVIDIA control panel, in game vsync is usually inferior in terms of input lag, leave that off) with no frame limit, as well as vsync off and a frame limit at 57hz, 60hz, and 61hz to see what is the best feeling.
---
did you even for a second think i’d really give a shit
---
With how many headshots it takes to kill them, they gotta at least have diamond for a helmet
---
turns out I cant find the weapons frogmen use all I know is that they are military people who are trained for underwater stuff
---
what's wrong with his face
---
Its one of the simpler skins and you even admit it looks good, so why do you even ask it is a legendary. I would like to have it myself; I bought this season 50 packs and got a legendary for Lesions shotgun; Im sad because i wont be able to play it a lot, i dont play lesion and even less his shotgun. Mira is awesome. 
---
lesion pistol, pmm, deagle. also ela pistol but only cause of the sight. 
---
It is! But it'll be almost impossible to get :/. So  many new legendaries and their drop rate is also low.
---
We should have some weekly challenge to get 1 legendary pack. 40 headshots or something. 
---
Russian ops already have the best 1x sight in game and their 2.5x is better than Acog as well. Sights don't have that big of a influence on picks (unless it's 2.5x vs 1x).
---
&gt;There's one which gives him a Shemegha (leaked) it basically makes him look like a BF 1 tank hunter
---
Haha Smegma
---
Why I think acog is overrated
---
*I think its*
---
oh my god the quality 
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
but what if your teammate fortifies between bombs?  
---
/s
---
Lmao
---
Wholeheartedly agree, get this to the front page people!
---
I sent it to my friend first if you want I can give it in proper quality 
---
I have the same situation. I wont buy a single season pass again from Ubi.
---
425???!?!Damn how are you not in Peo League?
---
You sound like a fashion designer 😂 I love it 
---
Don’t forget the black ice
---
I’ve tried to play with a squad, but I don’t have and can’t afford a mic, and, even if I did, I have terrible social skills so I’d probably have trouble communicating with everyone else. I’ve never played Glaz, so I’ll try him and see if that works. 
---
[You're welcome](http://imgur.com/gallery/Dr9hMqQ)
---
Smegma balls UwU 
---
You misspelled blitz
---
I want that cardboard box skin for lesion! 
---
Would be cool to have viewmodel adjustments in the game though
---
Change the white to purple and boom, you got yourself a WIP Thanos haha. Nah but asides from that great work fam and it's looks V spooky 
---
Oh my god if you fucked that up, that would have been humiliating.
---
That's a mighty fine view you got there lol
---
Thanks, that sounds like a great idea. What CPU did you get?
---
Also my Buck is low-key better than yours
---
Both the headgear and uniform have been in packs since Grim Sky, but I don't know of an exact place where you can see the new stuff they've added. 
---
Here's a pic of the uniform btw (not mine) https://i.redd.it/b67mz4uu7gk11.jpg
---
Which platform are you on?If you are on pc my name is:Oreo7274 if you are on ps4 my id is:omeros04(Im still a beginner on console tho)
---
Sadly I have super bad anxiety, and I have aspegers so I don't know how to be social too well, so making friends is hard, and meeting enough people and being friends to form a group and play this game with is even harder! So getting a group isn't an option for me :/ not to mention the only guy I play with isn't talking for some reason, so that's cool and all 
---
So this is not something new? I hope they will fix shit like this
---
Seranikas was killed by m9 1000m acog
---
I love how it turns the game Chinese
---
Please no
---
Honestly they never listen
---
acoggggggg
---
yes
---
Why me gotta have -8 karma reddit
---
Since they took away the acog for this I don't use black ice on it any more. I use this one instead. 
---
I think the biggest thing that keeps me coming back is how no two matches are ever the same. I know that applies to pretty much every game, but with Siege it's way more noticeable. there is just so much stuff at play that every match feels distinct and new. I'm around level 150 and I'm still seeing things I haven't already seen before on a regular basis. 
---
we meet again.
---
I wanted the title to be "Monty fucking dies" but it didn't let me post it so...
---
Sounds interesting. 
---
Twitch and Thatcher should be able to destroy it rather than just disable it
---
I was in a casual match once where I went down to 0 health.  Managed a kill before I was finally shot. 
---
Survived a peeking forst&gt;Survived 3 shotgun shots from 1 meter&gt;got downed by alibi but revived with boost&gt;got to 2 hp and exposed by hologram&gt;still living with 2 hp
---
Hardly, and as someone else commented its more of a food for thought comment. More kills and the defuse equals more skill points towards ranking up/renown does it not? Is that not the reason the majority of people play?
---
This gives me so many questions. Why was Cav in obj, why keep peaking?  Good job on capitalizing on their mistakes though! That was damn fast.
---
Also if I'm the last alive I get kicked. Like there could be one other guy alive with me, and the SECOND he dies, I get vote kicked. It's so weird 
---
they always make the weirdest ones for smonk
---
Thanks for the pic bro!
---
I really really hope they never reveal his face. If he gets an elite skin I really hope it doesn't show his face either. Not even his eyes, just want to keep it a mystery lol
---
Somethings of
---
Hover ash mains ego
---
well use this game to overcome your anxiety otherwise be prepared to encounter toxicity every other game. try an app called moot. you might be able to find players on there 
---
Umm whoops looks like I forgot I'll be right back
---
Hell yeah brother. I’m an offensive ela I save them grizs to throw at their faces 
---
I didnt know smoke could breathe underwater now

And I just bought Hound. fuck me

This is nothing like the actual Hibana

In this she actually looks good

You cant buy legendaries AFAIK, it's an epic.
---
This is wildly American 
---
However I’m newer to ela maining since I was not liking the others
---
Dude just try to open a pack or change some load outs. It always works.
---
either to far from obj, to scared to push or they just have no faith in you.. most people like to rush casual matches
---
Nice one comrade
---
Same 
---
The hitboxes are unfortunately out of place too. This season has severely broken shields and I really hope it gets fixed soon.
---
He reminds me of some horror movie based in Chernobyl and he is chasing you the whole time
---
Nah that doesn’t go with the picture too small. *dabs*
---
why even use tactics or communicate with each other when you could also just run into the scope and lose 
---
pros and cons tho
---
Wallet squad
---
And consulate
---
in casual it's absolutely the case, probably even worse on console. over the weekend I saw instant TK's on the new ops like 50% of the time, not even exaggerating
---
I think it's a little ridiculous to wait until the season is over, but I'm definitely waiting another week or so unless I'm playing with a squad that I know won't TK me
---
Pass those plates around 
---
ooof
---
Add them
---
sleek af!
---
He wasn't good enough for her
---
Does anyone know where to find the original picture of that? I kinda like it.
---
Sorry man it really do be like that sometimes 
---
i agree with you to an extent. the problem kinda occurs with more competent players using glaz. Again, glaz makes bad players better. Hundreds of hours of siege and high ranks each season has showed me this, (since his rework). Players who are more competent? a glaz who is more observant of his teammates positions can pop smoke can force you to turtle in a situation where the enemy team is pinching, a smart glaz can then smoke off again and push with little to no repercussions. 
---
The problem also isn't just his smokes, his ability literally makes peeking so much easier because you don't have to visually process anything you're seeing. He has no real movement penalty inside scope, so he can just ads, move to peek (even dry) and his ability to see enemies is so much easier that he has a blatant advantage. His ability offers very little counter play aside from not countering it at all. It's not fun. And frankly i'm amazed it's taken this long to rework him. He's currently the easiest op to play in a role that he was never meant for
---
I swear this gets posted every other week with everyone asking this
---
Discleamer :  These patches are made for the devs who work on Siege. And the patch seasonal "icon" is always same with the charm we get when season ends. 
---
Practicing on terrorist hunt and playing the situations will help you a lot. I suggest doing that.

Looks like they hired someone new who knows whatsup with what should be legendary

Im a high gold/low plat player on console this aint rare

I don't understand why this fucker has a respirator and fucking warnings lights

If you can play her well she is a great counter defense/offense opetator

I think he meant they all left or got tked and left or something or my brain is just stupid

Are that new animations?

Why bother censoring the names when the gt's aren't?

Recolor as legendary? LOL

Meh

im not very smart

Finally, a decent looking face!

But she's spanish 
---
I got it 2 days ago
---
post plant amazing and mid round still great shes kind of like lesion you only really use her trap for the sound que to hear someone coming from behind or wherever also both her guns are great they both have acog and I believe she has smokes which is really great for bomb
---
Daaanng
---
What would he be doing
---
I remembered what her normal head looks like and I'll stick with the legendary. 
---
You heard of, de necc
---
Now get ready for

The acog Is a dream lost you sadistic fuck nice black ice tho
---
Lol hate this. Especially in those drone holes that lead outside
---
duh
---
That is really good man, nice job!
---
Another Deagle legendary, why? I already have Mac Daddy and Royal Flush. Next legendary is guaranteed to be this one.
---
Never saw this myself so it's pretty cool to see
---
That's gonna be a 👍 from me.
---
Sorry lol she looked like a Russian nesting doll without my glasses and I didn't check what OP the skin was for
---
Go to the rainbow six discord and find people. 
---
Maybe with smaller maps
---
Done.
---
When fuze kills the hostage on one round and gets picked again 
---
Please Ubisoft, Black ice for MP7 is all I want 
---
Why the fuck are people getting alot of legends
---
I got this, it got me to use the bailiff, which I now like. So that’s good.
---
It’s a slur dumbass
---
Speaking of, a friend of mine is a Miramain so I'm gonna go ruin his day for him lol
---
Damn this looks amazing
---
Yeah no prob, she looks like a russian tango dancer anyway ^^
---
I prefer that to the skin with the life saving ring. 
---
Ash doesn’t count as an elite skin. 
---
I’m more bothered with random vote kicks.
---
Did you not see? He clearly got a headshot on Jäger, then he just instantly dies 
---
You he killed you before you got to shoot your bullet. You aimed your gun at his head but the rate of fire of the gun was not fast enough
---
[6 months old](https://imgur.com/10CTSRF) 
---
I think that came out last season or the season before. There’s a headgear that goes with it
---
Guess I haven’t used it in a long time XD
---
Catch another drone and nudge it? 
---
I used to use the other one until I realized how good the Bailiff was at creating rotation holes 
---
*supressed shot*
---
Im more and more convinced Ubisoft doesnt know what their operators look like. 
---
Did you just talk back to me!?

That’s a nerf you now have bb shield

Holy shit you're insane

Yo did this happen last night? Bc a couple of days ago I was in the ashes position and died the exact same way

That alibi legendary weapon skin is amazing.

1. Already posted by someone else

2. It’s not a “leak” if it’s in the game right now

i didn't know there was one is there a link some place ?

Ubi wants all the money.
---
Twitch main? Wow those guys are bad (dont look at my name)

Is she one of the best in the game? I have all the og operators and hibana, is it worth to get her next?

You dare nerf the lord?

They’re coming out with the best and worst have you seen the furry one!!!

Buck looking like a gnome

Okay thanks, I haven't seen it before

Watch out the barrels hot
---
Right side of the  subreddit has a link. 
---
Lol the faded leather is the only uniform i have for jager (except elite)
---
yeah ok that is true. I guess my point here was just dont solo. 3 is actually probably the best all around since there are probably a fair number of duo q as well so you get quicker matches on top of massively reduced toxicity.
---
Go to ubisoft’s support and tell them them the issue. that usually sorts my stuff out.
---
This one looks pretty good with it I think
---
Random vote kicks are dumb and also tired of people just leaving. Feel there should be a larger MMR loss for people that leave in the middle of the game

---
The shotgun isn't as good for newbs because it's pump action and you are much more likely to miss your first shot. Also, you should try roaming with pulse. His shotgun is semi auto so it matters less if you miss, and you will be able to see people sneaking up on you and blow through walls to get them.
---
1. That isn’t all of them
---
2. Many of those are old
---
What are talking about?
---
Witch-hunting, very uncool.
---
They kinda just view it as grunt work and don’t want to do it themselves. I was rolling with it because I thought learning the rotation holes and where attackers come from would be helpful. I’m definitely scared to leave obj so it seemed to be helping but I’ll try something different tonight.
---
Someone cant read. I wasnt complaining about solodueing against 5 stacks, matchmaking gave us a 3v5 to start out the game. We never had five players

Perfect for parties tho

I did my best
---
Due to the fact that it wouldn't make any sense, if she had the ability to place it in every room, hallway, etc. but the moment they get into the objective it's impossible. as well, it would restrict here ability which is not the purpose of said above; but to only keep players from abusing the power and corrode the games play and online experience.

Deja Vu
---
Mad cuz bad
---
This gotta be the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen on Reddit 
---
Only some will get
---
Yea. Your crafting tutorial should have had bedrock in the head slot. Lol! They do eat headshots. Armor should be enchanted with Ninja Aspect since sometimes these loud dlfat fucks come out of no where.
---
Pretty sure it was a joke
---
When I used to play I typically muted chat so I could focus in on the sounds through my headset. There was a few exceptions with players that I liked that had excellent call outs and didn't abuse coms with unnecessary sounds. (Chewing gum, breathing on the mic, babies crying in the background, screaming "fuck" when they die). I was a platinum player and I was often top fragging. I always trusted my awareness and gun play to overcome my lack of coms. I'm aware this is very flawed way to play because this is a game designed around team play but I only played for own enjoyment and didn't want randoms ruining my experience. 
---
I have literal years of footage that showcases why you should NEVER solo...and it only keeps getting worse too.

Hello Ab00sive_poptart, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b15fns/audio_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
My experience after getting this headgear.
---
It’s alright man I’ll keep looking into it
---
It takes three shots from any gun to destroy a Frost mat.
---
MMR gains and losses having nothing to do with personal performance. The amount off MMR gained or lost is dependant on the expected outcome of the match based on everyone's current MMR in the match factored together.
---
the only thing we want now is KOOL AID shout
---
I even put /s goddamn some people
---
I like that one. She is way less dikish looking.
---
Looking back at my first comment I realise I said "should've" referring to throwing the nitro, where I probably should have said "could've" as that would've made a decent play too. I'm not saying OP shouldn't have gone for the ninja defuse because they are cool to see, and I'm not taking anything away from what they did. Just voicing what I saw as an opportunity for a couple of easy kills that would've made a cool clip too.
---
It’s the toxic terror team 
---
CLOUT
---
Thank you, random citizen.
---
Yes
---
100%
---
Alibi has pro league set definetily not going to see that soon
---
As far as i know they jist put stuff in, i got real lucky on my first pack of the season.
---
I just unlocked Mav like 4 days ago, now i have a skin to save up for lol
---
Headgear*
---
Not a helmet
---
What platform do you play on? If the people you play with are on console (Xbox/PS4) it's very likely most people in ranked are in party chat, if they're in a party you won't hear them and they won't hear you.
---
We’ll never see his face I swear 
---
Yesss dude, that’s the one I want the most.
---
id buy that bottom second to the right in heart beat. 
---
And everywhere lol
---
Same
---
Its a joke
---
Daaamn one off of a flush 
---
Activation delay as in the detonation, not the placing of it.
---
It was already a really good change that they made it prime after a delay, as instant detonation even midair made it absolutely ridiculous back in the TTS days.
---
It's ironic you call us blind when you pretty much read the first line of my response and then ignored the rest. That default mute enemy communication option was added in last week: https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2019/03/23362/
---
So again, you cannot claim valve is not doing anything regarding toxicity. 4-5 years ago, all chat was on during half-time and finished match screens so I have no idea what kind of rose-tinted glasses you're wearing.
---
R6 has been improving but somehow we're encountering bugs that existed before when they attempt to fix issues by rolling back and then the playerbase is stuck with them for 3-4 months because ubisoft releases updates or patches every "season" in bulk. Mid-season changes are minor tweaks that rarely affect the integrity of the game. I can no longer stand by their decision to fix issues or provide changes on such a delayed schedule. 
---
I'm in the camp that having "seasons" and delivering content on a fixed schedule causes issues faster than the dev team has time to address but their stubbornness to stick with it is something I can't follow. I played since Closed Beta and bought Season passes 1-3 but I can't really find myself to buy Season 4.
---
By the way. You are now moving the goalposts. You're trying to claim that Valve isn't doing anything regarding toxicity and cheating but when confronted with evidence that refutes it, you "shift it to what they do isn't keeping away cheaters."
---
Also, community servers are running VAC outside of hack servers. ESEA is a whole other matter that requires you to install a 3rd party agent and requires a separate subscription fee. The issues you seem to claim are prevalent in CS:GO are no different in R6. The entire reason why R6 implemented MFA requirements was because cheaters could purchase compromised accounts. It only goes to show you that paywalls don't really deter hacking. Literally every game in existence is proof of that.
---
This headfear has been in the game since around Para Bellum.
---
It looks INCREDIBILIS
---
Spiral stairs of map house (on workshop’s wall 2f) 
---
That’s sick. I’d love to see this
---
If im not mistaken there is also no jungle warfare operators (some CTUs train in jungle like SAS but does that really count?) 
---
I approve the shitty meme 👍
---
There is a leak for the blitz birthday challenge skin https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/555012233948823563/555013154032058389/unknown.png
---
That Outbreak ser was insanely cool though.
---
Ohhh roj, thatll be a good thing to keep in mind
---
What's ur problem?
---
Thank god. And thank you for the info!
---
This is what I like to see. Not that ninja Hibana bullshit.

---
Ok, thanks!
---
This cosplay is really good 
---
I can’t still play R6 in freezes in o do anything, all i can do is look at the lobby screen. And i have 2CPUS
---
At first I thought this was going to be just another meh fan-made operation idea, but it's so much more. The quality for one. The OP obviously put a lot of effort into this. This is a great idea for an operation! I, for one, would be very excited for a season like this! 
---
I just keep on getting weapon skins for operators I don't own
---
"The Plague Doctor" nice elite name (no it isnt)
---
I was going to lead into a joke...
---
Gotta confess, I'm guilty of everything you described. 
---
Somewhere in Switzerland maybe?
---
New Swiss Operators maybe? 
---
I meant the actual source of the picture, not where it's located. It's on almost every map in siege.
---
Agreed bro, this operation would be so dope!
---
An easy fix that works for me is to run a local custom game. 
---
wtf, he was definitely carried
---
That’s very true. I’m happy with Burnt Horizon also because I waited 3 years for it.
---
And I do wish there were better CTU countries for year for, like Poland instead of Kenya and India.
---
Install the season pass if you are on Xbox 
---
The other team is scum
---
Oh I believe you, never doubted it :P
---
Just making an internet joke. Looks really good, btw :)
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
This is an overrated and overused suggestion.
---
I literally used to barely be able to play this game because the second my team watched me play they would just vote me off because they knew I was bad. This was before I was even a high enough level to play ranked. I'm in the same situation as you I'm 27 work full time and play when I can. If you're on Xbox let me know we can play sometime. 
---
When you nut but she keeps sucking
---
Actually I made one with bedrock, but Imgur is broke at the moment.
---
Fuckin' Imgur.
---
Laughs in elite
---
He doesn’t have the ar33?
---
Did a quick search, couldn't find it anywhere else, not even images, had me a guess. If you can find my edit comment you can see that i was wrong though.

I once came across him. He joined our team for the last round (he was solo queue). He just held objective with frost. Never saw anyone :(
---
Be looking like scientists from Rust
---
I will get it! Thx
---
Don't hold angles for too long this is a glitch as of right now. Ubi might fix it but I've seen another version of this where the head isn't visible but if you shoot the bullets do land a headshot granted someone is holding that angle.
---
honestly i just use the fmg9, ever since THAT recoil nerf i could never use the smg11 with the shotgun
---
Or just a drum mag
---
Look at their team, you didn't get the kill
---
no it shouldnt we already have a plague doctor headgear
---
I’m actually having the same issue. I for some reason don’t have the new ops and never got to play them early.
---
The Conduit-skin for the SMG-11.
---
You're*
---
No matter how close you may be, there is no guarantee you'll hit your target just because you pulled the trigger. When you're panicked or in a hurry, you'll end up pulling the trigger even if your gun isn't facing your target.
---
this would actually make me kms lol
---
yeah its been out of map rotations since White Noise I think
---
No, just a visual bug.
---
hay una actualizacion nueva de 20mb y ya ha resuelto el problema
---
It’s rude to call a girl ‘big.’ Instead, call Hibana ‘DUMMY THICC.’ It has a much more positive tone.
---
Actually no, I got this from Fabian. Just looking out for the games balance as a whole 
---
Damn I want to play that map so badly. Do you know if I can play it in custom games?
---
Yeah my point exactly...  You can clearly see the interrogation animation end and Cav lets go of the head and puts the knife away. 
---
The game isn't about kills, it's about winning matches. 
---
Exactly, you should be aiming for headshots. And the MP5 has no recoil, which makes it perfect for headshots
---
Glad to hear its not just me and my friends. Was starting to think I was really bad all of the sudden
---
Don't forget all of rooks Armour plates
---
I recently only got 1 legendary too, out of 50 packs. It stings.

That looks good as fuck.

The alt-tab delay is still there sadly, and some random crashes as well.

Why?
---
because they haven't done anything to it yet.. and it's going to come out of beta in season 2
---
Countering the spawn peek
---
Making the low level playlist was a dumb idea of Ubisoft, tbh.
---
They basically forced anyone that like old ranked better than the try hard pick and ban list into casual.  And casual still doesn’t have old ranked defender spawn vote.
---
So naturally Of course increase in the “taxic “ behavior was bound to happen, along with more smurf accounts.
---
The new list should have been a clone of old ranked, or simply added defend voting to new casual.
---
Ubisoft dropped the ball, by trying to use the playlist changes to promote pro league views.
---
Congrats nice one
---
You get your 82 Renown faster atleast 
---
You were the only one to reference gachi. ♂ Thank ♂ you ♂ sir ♂
---
Did you win the game?! Really good clutch either way!
---
I thought this was a photoshopped meme at first holy shit
---
The special even could be like On her majesty's secret service with a special rescue op for ~10 hostages from the masks
---
Ela and Finka would be your best option then. 
---
Finka is good at rushing and helping out teammates if they are going into objective 
---
While ela did get nerfed if you play well she is still a viable roamer and can get the surprise on enemies, while also using her ability to inhibit enemies from entering objective
---
Kaid on the other hand is a semi anchor so he wouldn’t really fit what you want 
---
Funny clip but you need to lower your sensitivity my man 
---
Plz give me
---
FOOKIN LASAH SOIGHTS
---
I solo or at least duo-q a few times a week, and other than the occasional asshole, it's pretty okay. 
---
by that statement then id say probably finka. give everyone a boost and pick up down teamates with ability as well. then id say go ela and kaid for last
---
Lmao it looked like he got straight up slugged
---

Grats! There’s a Legendary Uniform and C7e Skin that goes with it, only from Alpha Packs. 
---
Just looked at it more, it has a packaging sticker on the back as well lol
---
Ok thanks for the suggestion I might get ela because I am feeling kinda bored on the defender side
---
No. But theyre only 500&gt;1000&gt;1500&gt;2000 and i think it continues to 2500 as its max.
---
Can't tell if woosh for me or season 2 is different from year 2
---
Use an impact grenade in the doorway, a mute, use a kapkan trap on that door or castle it so then youdint have to deal with it, put clash in the doorway, again blow a hole in the wall next to the doorway, use the new operator and hijack a twitch drone and destroy it that way. Those are some examples another would be being good at gun play and eliminating enemies as they approach you.
---
Noice! I just woke up and thought another leak for the next season was out. Wonder if we can have the original image without the titles? 
---
Day 1500 of waiting for that elite smonk.

That's not a good reason to remove the score board, and a persons personality won't change if they're 1st or 5th.
---
Just report/ignore, don't expect immediate results because that's not how it works. The ban wave will come and you'll have the justice you crave.
---
What I’m asking is why are you spawnpeeking people want to play not die instantly
---
Somebody give him some gold already
---
My opinion is no. But if you want to call it an ace, go for it.
