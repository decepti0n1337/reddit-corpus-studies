I like how you tried to walk through the door 4 times before and he still blew it up.
---
---
---
How do I select the operator main flair?
---
Maybe the hacker you played against never got caught and you played with hackers in a different game
---
nice
---
It‚Äôs satire
---
Some idiots think complimenting a woman is harassment, just ignore the idiot. Just don‚Äôt ignore actual harassment lol.
---
I'm wondering the same thing... :(
---
The tk ban rules in casual are different to ranked rules I think
---
Nobody saw it luckily, but first time I ever played ela, I was hid in a corner a someone came walking right past me, I had ages to aim, line the shot up, and pulled the trigger and thing went everywhere, missed every shot, guy turned and deleted me, safe to say I've never touch that SMG again in my life
---
I wish my school was this cool
---
69 screenshots, we were this close to greatness
---
heres your ELI5. The players you encountered that were banned were either 1) on your team or 2) you won against some.
---

---
Your argument with 'the enemy got banned and I lost elo' is **really** weird since Ubi does not tell you which players are banned when you get this message.
---
?

**Downs enemy from 30 meters away** 
---
This gun is so shit it only injured him wtf
---
Yeah, you can already buy most everything else with renown so why not. I personally purchased my Twitch elite skin because I love her, it, and wanted to contribute more money to Ubisoft for a great game. However, I also had some Rcredits from the edition of the game I got. Some people may not feel like it's not worth paying $20 for a skin pack...and really it's not. I feel like the reason people get so defensive over this is because they spent the money on it and hate the idea of someone else getting it without having to. If you made elite skins cost a lot of renown and/or added an in-game challenge to complete in order to get them, the idea really isn't that absurd (and wouldn't take away the "elite-ness" of it). All in all though, I just want to see more elite skins. #JusticeForAlibi
---
Thanks for the feedback! I see what you mean thanks for pointing that out
---
Is this real or a bug?
---
At my school seniors can paint a parking block, so I‚Äôm assuming that this is a variation of that
---
Mine did but you had to pay for it
---
does seem pretty crazy lol
---
YES DUDE. FUCKING MACH 10 ROCKETS. 
---
This man is a real OG
---
can someone explain me what 4/20 mean ? I know its in rapport with weed etc etc but why ? I heard that was a code law about weed, other say its the birthday of bob marley (meh) and some other crap but I want to know the real explanation ! 
---
thanks a lot !
---
Real we/the two teams never killed each other but the hostage found multiple ways to die.
---
I enjoyed getting them the first time around back in the beginning but when I bought my secound acc In operation chimera I was annoyed that I got them all. It brings a fun challenge and makes you spend more time with operators.
---
After playing siege for so long my eyes naturally find all these cameras everywhere.
---
That looks amazing üòÉüëåüèª
---
I don't get it
---
Those are very good lol. Had to be post nerf Ela for sure, cause if you missed, I could only assume the gun had actual recoil.......at least I hope O-O
---
Hot
---
I wish for this so many times
---
wrong race, ur not asian
---
John wick?
---
#THONK THONK THONK
---
At the moment I'm personally preferring the Roni because of firerate and low recoil and that holographic sight is just so pretty
---
Same
---
Tbh it may your teammates not watching certain spots or being too slow to get into position. Or you idk.
---
Advanced Gadget Deployment is really nice honestly, there's a few really handy things you can do with it like stopping placing a Thermite charge if the wall becomes electrified, because it isn't destroyed until the animation finishes
---
IKR. Using renown to unlock the operators is way more satisfying than straight up buying them. It also gives you time to try the new operator before unlocking the next one instead of being overwhelmed.
---
Are you quoting RussianBadger? Cause if you are it makes my heart happy
---
They need more siege stuff at GameStop! swear everything is all overrun with fortnite now
---
I honestly can't look at cameras like these in the same way anymore
---
My dear lad you cannot compare cod recoil with siege. Play a lot of thunt with different guns/ops to learn their recoil. Sledge‚Äôs primary AR and Ash‚Äôs R4C have some of the easier to learn recoil, maybe start with them. Like I said, you can learn with time.
---
Question; Boot Bands or Boots tuck?
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Mother Russia Intensity
---
Try Moot I hear it's where alot of players go to
---
Already experienced this. Still haven't been hit by a frost trap though.
---
r/unexpected_ancestor
---
Thats how I started to main rook myself. He's great for beginners!
---
The most efficient way to make yourself look as suspicious as possible I guess. On another note, I always say ‚Äò10 points‚Äô every time I‚Äôm out with family and see a cam. Always pisses off my brother
---
That would be sick
---
I know that he is because you can help in one button! It's pretty amazing what armor can do
---
No I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a measly freshman. It‚Äôs a FFA for everyone except seniors who bought a spot and parking pass.
---
this deserves more recognition
---
Ok! I‚Äôll PM you
---
Well back and frost are dlc and they have black ice
---
And that's another reason to never play hostage. Especially in ranked unless you don't care about your rank.
---
10yrs ago my high schools parking pass for the year was around $115 but $20 if a parent worked for the county/city or you were apart of an active local volunteer program like a fire department. We didn't get to paint anything though, just lots designated sophomore, junior, senior.
---
Sire yes sir
---
Nice ace
---
How many kills did you end up getting?
---
its consle tho no one talks
---
I have that CutoverEight7 guy added, we used to play like a year ago, lol
---
10 and 3 assist
---
Nope TCHS
---
it isnt a meme his shield is actually plastic wrap, it got nerfed from 600-50
---
The player level isn‚Äôt a way to judge thier skill. Generally you get placed with people around your skill if you are low level. You gotta dive in head first. 
---
I‚Äôd say the games learning curve is like a fucking steep  mountain and it feels bad when you die to shit you didn‚Äôt even know could happen. 
---
BUT....it does get less stressful the more you play.
---
especially in europe man, no one speaks proper english
---
Because they don‚Äôt want people to use recruit
---
its so true
---
Every time I see a room I go +10 no wait +20 oh cool, pixel peek!
---
they don‚Äôt want to incentivize the use of recruit. that‚Äôs why he will never get any cosmetics or any sort of customization
---
Neat!
---
It's a team game, learn to play to win, not for individual stats.
---
We will have to wait till Milan to hear any updates on the pilot program although that may not be guaranteed as nothing was announced at invitational so fingers crossed!
---
Hey i had to buy all operators in operation health so yall can live
---
Because they said they don't want recruit to be a viable operator.
---
It was there just as a placeholder for people that didn't have enough ops but now that everybody gets the 10 base ops for free they might as well remove it.
---
My high school recently got rid of this tradition but yes we were able to paint our parking places.
---
I call it: my luck in ranked
---
I want to see that comic.
---
I‚Äôm travellin at the speed of liiiiiight,
---
He shot through the floor? Its not a crazy occurence.
---
Maybe Ping
---
Looks dope!
---
I think someone clearly filled Rook's MP5 with blanks
---
u/sillyfoal
---
Turn hostage off.
---
Rook is definitely the best defender for new players. Easy gadget, good gun, impact nades, big iron.
---
I was having issues the first time and by the time I posted it again the first one stopped giving me issues lol
---
I was allowed to paint my spot. Top 25 students in the senior class were given a spot that was closer to the school and you could paint it!
---
Did someone use their parking spot to grow a patch of grass?
---
j√§ger, we have to cook.
---
My school had no parking for students, led to multiple fines for parking alongside the fence of the school.
---
Same thing
---
Same thing every platform
---
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
---
He wouldn‚Äôt get that. He‚Äôs only 11 and has only played enough to realize he sucks at the game
---
It's supposed to be Frost BTW
---
Upvote for another blitz main!
---
everyone knew this
---
Can we PLEASE remove hostage from ranked until this is fixed?
---
Sooo you don‚Äôt like shields in the game basically. Why not have them have a knife? Got a reason other than you don‚Äôt like blitz?
---
You weren‚Äôt in separate places between the killcam and your screen. The marker on your character followed you as you died. He got you with one of his first shots into the ceiling and sprayed it out while you stumbled to your left as you died.
---
You can only buy it for Frost's super 90. It's the frost buddle. I bought it a while back.
---
Reason #436 why I never play hostage.
---
Did you misspell *autistic?
---
Bruh moment
---
That's different though. A few schools around my area had no parking for students. But when you have a limited amount of spots for the students, don't sell or do a lottery for passes, and just let them "have at it", you're going to have massive issues.
---
We're not in a city or anything btw.
---
Yeah, all that is bullshit.  It's Plat for a reason, you're a Platinum, you have Platinum skill.
---
Be proud of your rank my dude, other people are just whining because they don't get how ranking systems work.
---
There's a reason your friends aren't Diamond lol.
---
My name is Barry Allen and I'm the fastest man alive.
---
Well, ur both right. U can buy the black I cant even for super90 in a bundle for credits, but they fixed buying with renown
---
This video made me nut
---
SKRRRRRRRRRRRRts in 45. ACP on Hibana who thought she was hot shit
---
Upvote for song and movie reference.
---
Please share how to get back up
---
Play ranked
---
Worst thing is its for an op u don't on your smurf
---
Still happens in Ranked
---
Plat IIIs are basically just lucky Gold Is anyways, but man do they talk shit in casual like they're basically Plat Is.  
---
I say this as a guy who's Plat III.
---
At least it looks cool :)
---
I hope Cav gets a headgear like Mira's old flame headgear
---
Not as often when you get into higher ranks there‚Äôs less trolls
---
Ive had the same problem with recoil control for a long time. Recently I tried changing my sensitivity because I heard that if you have bad recoil control that it could be because your sensitivity is too high.
---
I changed my horizontal and vertical sensitivity both to 20 and my ADS sensitivity to 50. Suddenly I was having a lot easier time with recoil. Turns out I just had my sensitivity too high!
---
Hope it works for you too!
---
Avicii has also passed exactly one year ago. May he forever rest in peace.
---
In T hunt it rly do be like that sometimes
---
Jackal and Mira were ‚ÄúI can see you‚Äù and then Dokkaebi and Vigil were ‚Äúbut you can‚Äôt see me‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs only been five minutes and someone already said this lol.
---
Any advice or feedback is appreciated btw!
---
fuck jackal lol, always tbag on him when I kill him (only op I do it to)
---
Ummmm
---
The one true buff we need for tachanka is the one that makes people stop shooting players that pick him.
---
Low fps
---
What if I'm out of water?
---
The version you buy is to not buy siege. At least right now. It's very very toxic, very glitchy, and ubi isn't being very transparent at the moment.
---
how to fix
---
Every gun can one tap "outside of house"
---
God I'm such a sucker for her.
---
Add the part where they aren't trying at all, but everyone them sweaty anyway, that they're ruining casual, and to go play ranked.
---
Can I ask you a few questions to figure out what might be the problem
---
sure.
---
What monitor resolution and what GPU are you using
---
And me...
---
Go into the sub Reddit page and press the 3 dots and chose tag or something like that
---
My typical internet username, CheetoSnorter69, happens to be much better. (I'm not joking)
---
On the app, you go to the subreddit‚Äôs main page and then press the [...] on the screen and select change flair. For the computer browser, I think there‚Äôs something on the right side of the screen when your on the main page to change the flair
---
Ela not enough ela mains
---
I love the (what I assume are) stickers that you are holding. Do you make them or did you get them from somewhere?
---
Same thing happend to me. I left the game and returned this got fixed but the audio fucked up. All ambient noise and steps came from the left and all shots noises from the right.
---
There's the sheild glitch fucking F
---
Ok thanks
---
The only real reason I don't like Plats, is because most plats I know, are douchebags. They play in 4's to kick people when they feel like it, they tk the random when they feel like it. And it's a group I can remember, they do it to other people and myself. 
---
So maybe not plats, just yonks.
---
I lost a rank because of this. Sort of sucks because it's not exactly your fault

Yeah let's just call the ability to remove hatches from play weak
---
I just want to use an alt account for playing with my friends. Is it just a separate ubi login or do you have to download the game twice? I know I have to own the game on another account but dont know if it has to be downloaded again.
---
Its 3 seconds and is usually enough for mozzie to get on cams and get his drone back (mid round)
---
Oh I mean it's sad to say but the siege community is just hella toxic. The only way I could think of is to either 1:try to see if everyone is talking/feel the waters out by talking about tachanka first, and say like you know this strategy or something, or 2 try and get a lot of kills before picking him because people are usually (usually not always as you mentioned) hesitant to kill the top person even if they pick tachanka. Or 3, and probably the best, wait to pick him til the last second and make it seem like an auto pick then just try to play it off like that and tell the team it was an accident, they probably would be less likely to kill you if they thought it wasnt your choice but just random. Then just setup and do what you wanted. The issue with this one is it's probably not the best idea to try multiple times in one match if someone seems really upset the first time you pick him. Hope that helps, and best of luck in representing the Lord.
---
My suggestion for all new players:
---
Play Terrorist hunt! Start by going to matchmaking preferences then starting with one map and play it once or twice before and after you play any of the multiplayer. This will help with your understanding of the map, situational awareness, and aim (only go for headshots). 
---
Find at least one friend to play with. This will negate some of the toxicity. Remember casual is casual and people sometimes play it simply to be toxic. Try and play ranked as soon as you are able. 
---
Watch videos of diamonds. Pengu Godly Skittlz Beaulo and MacieJay are my personal favorites for pure skill. Coconut Brah and the dangleberries are both great to learn tips and tricks from. 
---
Go to matchmaking preferences and only play bomb. It‚Äôs the most balanced and you learn strategies better with it. Once you feel good about that way down the road then switch around. 
---
Siege is a really hard game and can get frustrating but it is one of the most rewarding and entertaining games I‚Äôve ever played. Good luck!
---
Oh really! Didn‚Äôt know. I knew for t-hunt but I only play ranked and figured you couldn‚Äôt for that.
---
Anything I can do with the clip of the cheater?
---
lol you‚Äôre an angry little fella aren‚Äôt ya. seems all you can do is throw insults. you must have a pretty miserable existence
---
i added the clip of it
---
Yeah, well i don't really care about my rank, but the reason i posted this was to bring attention to this exploit so the devs might fix it faster.
---
The other reason was that the other team was extremely toxic in chat and they were trying to justify glitching. Now that made me mad.
---
That‚Äôs probably for the best
---
Very nice comrade. Would smash :)
---
If you say so.
---
I always quit matchmaking after 2 mins and requeue (if that's how you spell it... German here) It usually puts me into a new match pretty quickly

Everyone saying Jackal straight up over Blackbeard with no argument is stupid
---
Maybe a little overpowered but ok
---
Probably just hitting him in his neck. Until you get a screenshot that shows a headshot then you missed the head. I have a friend who complains about this all the time but he just misses.
---
Not saying you missed, just saying unless theres a clearly screenshot of you hitting the head then I'm more inclined to believe that than hit reg
---
Frost Traps MVP. How they miss them though? Haha.

Use lesion, and when the new def op comes out use him too

It's the other way around, actually.
---
I'm not asking you why we should pick the TCSG12 at this current state of Kaid. I'm under the assumption of ignoring everything about damage, rate of fire, recoil, etc. I'm talking about building both the AUG A3 and TCSG12 from scratch, thinking outside of the box, balancing things do not necessarily mean we have to equalize them on every aspect toe to toe, there should be pros and cons of each of these two weapons.
---
You think the R6 Dev do not know the AUG A3 is weak? They are making the AUG A3 weak on purpose and they are experimenting us, they are testing the viability of DMR on defender side to see if it's an OP spawn peeking weapon and if the results are satisfying, they will add more to the future defenders.
---
I don't believe in the rule of 3 armor implying an ACOG, it's about what the operator is designed and suitable for, just look at Mira, does she need an ACOG? I'm pretty sure there are a lot more people picking the AUG A3 right now after the 27 &gt; 33 damage buff yet a significant amount of people keeps DMRing with the TCSG.

at 40 seconds in the clip(if you can see it is showing now) it show a headshot

R6 is the deepest strategic shooter there is. Meaning there is so much to learn &amp; get used to. With that said, you dont want to miss out on this game
---
Buy it. It's a fantastic game with long term appeal. Fair warning; how people compliant about Sekire &amp; other FromSoft games being to hard and quitting in hours. This game is the equivalent of that but in an online shooter.
---
You will suck for the first week. Be patient, pay attention to every sound (you need a headset for this game NEED!!!), try all the characters to find what gadgets and gun suits you most. Then you will love this game.

ty. do you know if there are more content drops being planned out for the game?

I do it usually on drone holes so that a twitch drone can go in without being caught by it
---
I bope you'll have a wonderful day too :)

I would highly recommend the game, it‚Äôs amazing fun and quite strategic as well as having great and often (ish) DLC.

There will be a floating table in brazil if i do this, i will break the law of physics xD
---
I usually do it on purpose for a twitch drone, so that it can go in
---
Rip ur dead memes from ur head.
---
They have a road map for this year. Every 3 months there are 2 new operators &amp; a new/reworked map. They plan on having 100 operators eventually. So far there are 40 operators if I'm not mistaken
---
Im sorry but im forced to call the r/PunPatrol, brother

Ah, I see you're a man of culture aswell.

Yeah maybe ill do that since its a little map

---
Thnx im not the only one
---
That‚Äôs just wrong
---
It's only a risk if you're on defence with no rook
---
maybe they change the models so the elite skins fit better. and different teams mah dude
---
Good discussion. Wish you uad brought some numbers like users or pro players
---
They should also expand the shield so about 2x the height so it covers atleast some of the body. Having heavy armor doesnt really help against guns like the F2 or R4-C.
---
I know I'm kinda late now but the site works BUT you will get banned for 7 days. I bought a lot of cheap credits. Got banned. and then used them after the ban.
---
Nice indeed
---
If you don' know who to get first just save enough renown to buy them at the same time. 200iq
---
When under the hangers, I can't go crawl to the other bed... it makes me fall off
---
Instead of a bigger shield, the deployable shield should be able to be put closer to the turret so it would actually protect the most of the body instead of just part of the legs
---
Should fit your bronze 1 perfectly
---
I dont get it?
---
I mean the same way r6 removed the half-mira, it makes sense that they remove this as well.
---
Unrealistic. Od that really was cav thpse bunnies would already be decaputated.
---
You know how mozzy has a gun called the super shorty? You can also use that to describe him
---
BOPE: Delete this.
---
Same shit with me I dropped 17-5 because of bad teammates and tkers
---
Now just don't buy another. You have had your "encourage him to buy more.
---
tbh 1070 or 1060 6gb could output ultra 60hz 1080p
---
I dont recommend it tho, higher fps and hz is better higher texture settings.

go for 144hz 1080p 1070 medium to low settings

May I ask how do you join once it starts man?

I am also 1.6m as Mozzie does. Super offended, mega annoyed.

Also super pissed that Mozzie has a girl to sit so close to him...
---
Half true,sometimes it has bonbers and sometimes not.

I've seen many times bombers on that map yet again,many times they have been missing.
---
Outback also has no bombers. It's pretty confusing why it's like that. Can't complain tho
---
No I bet you have 1 squad member who was below 30 level and now he leave the squad that's why it's showing that you can play rank now

Iam the shortest in my family i know your pain man. me being the older brother at 1.82m and my two younger sisters tower over me at 1.90m and 1.92m. while my dad is also like 1.90m
---
Except you kinda did.
---
That spot never works out well for me
---
It's been over a year

Same. PUBG has separate slider for all scopes (hell, the mobile version has for EACH GUNS.) And its not really hard, as its just slider (min max function) and implementing different rad value (the multiplier crap), but idk, goobi be goobi, i guess.
---
Black screen?
---
Yeah, I know
---
I got this a few weeks ago (I got legendary after 6 months, lvl210) it's pretty cool but I think it's in the game since Para Bellum
---
I don‚Äôt know. Ubisoft is sort of new to ranked things which I understand. But a AAA developer should be able to quickly fix these things. Put in an actual punishment system not fucking 15 minutes or an hour. Ban them for days. Or even an XP ban. They have 45 million times 20$ at least in their accounts not counting micro transactions. The budget is there, the developers apparently are not.

Hello JamaicanHomeboy, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bfo16v/new_rainbow_6_exploit_affecting_current_ranked/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Yup ^^ both answered it üëãüëã
---
The reason the guy left ive now found out is because hes already Diamond so he doesnt care. 
---
Looking at his stats, hes clearly boosted since he seems to lose alot more games than he wins since becoming Diamond.
---
If this is a common practice for him, there should be a Rank reset or as you say - ban them for days

remember: it's ok to camp in bomb mode were you have two big rooms to do it, but it's not ok to stack 5 asses in one room in secure area
---
That's a pretty common occurrence, at least once a game I'll notice a sound didn't play at all (gunshots, explosions, GUs, etc). Stationary drones have a tendency to make movement noises, which often gives their position away. Certain areas on certain maps straight up lie to you about where sounds are coming from - the most consistent example is at the top of the south-east stairs on Coastline. People walking around in the north corridor or VIP lounge will sound like they're coming from the south corridor. Other common locations include multi-floor stairs, such as yellow or spiral on Consulate or bar stairs on Clubhouse - it's a dice roll whether they sound like they're above you, below you, or even right behind you.
---
Sound has been completely fucked for the past 6-10 months, possibly even longer.
---
He still does!

I mean, 1.84m is only considered short if you're talking about NBA players or something. He said he knew what it felt like to be short but he's 24cm taller than the guy who's 1.60m tall. Of course he feels short next to his sisters if they're 1.90m tall but a 1.60m guy will feel short anywhere in a developed country

#FUCK MY COVER HAS BEEN BLOWN
---
The acog just looks so fitting on Jagers gun I miss my acog :(
---
She'd be a 2 speed 2 armour and the jump would make a her go a bit faster in the direction the gadget was deployed she'd just have that like 1 second to free look left and right and spray a door or just have a faster entry into rooms so she could break down barricades with its and entry frag but it'd be dangerous because she'd have no cover and it would be LOUD so that defenders can react 
---
Basically like a faster hot breach
---
Longer timer, cant pic sites, get less renown, and people complain about us sweating in casual more than in ranked. Also we dont know what our MMR is in casual so we cant derank to get out of the sweaty area we are in.
---
Make a fidget spinner out of her emblem.
---
IQ*
---
Wtf has this got with me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It would also bring her legs up so the hit box would be torso and head
---
Just kinda sits wrong to play ranked in easy mode.
---
If you don't want to be sweaty, play casual. Why ruin other people's game in ranked just cause you "wanted to have fun"? Sure, ranked doesn't matter but people still want to have fun playing fair games.
---
Giving advice to teammates doesn't justify being toxic.
---
they are obviously meming
---
Yet people love that bibo guy on here who does the exact same thing :massive_thunk:
---
I immediately thought of the Bound2 video. Anyone else?
---
üòÇ
---
Don't even know who he is but sure I love him.
---
Mute is 2 speed
---
it would be good if they gave him penetration, but maybe not with the current damage since I feel like it would be a bit much.
---
Idk
---
Yeah, maybe it would take like 5-8 shots to get a kill through surfaces like that.
---
This is leech bot. Just kick the guy. He is spinning so he can't be auto kicked
---
So is it just a press of a button and she goes forward or can she choose which direction she goes in?
---
I like it
---
True. But it cant be hard to remove maps from ranked, can it?
---
King of the Hill Season 7 episode 13 anyone? no just me... okay then...
---
Yeah I feel like if it was 5-8 shots for shields and windows it might be more fair.
---
Most 1 speeds have this to give an illusion that they're heavier/bulkier as well.
---
First week? More like a first month!
---
Yee it is hard. But once you get in, you just can't quit
---
Schrodingers‚Äô Germans
---
Would this be on top of the already announced rework, or would it replace that? I liked Ubi's approach but this seems cool too.
---
I‚Äôd like to think that Montagne did see me but played a poor shepherd. It was supposed to be a fun game of follow the leader but ended up in a massive bloodbath.
---
Wait, you use the pussy DMR? REAL Dok players use the BOSG, the most skilled and pro League ready weapon in the game, if you use the M 14 you are a virgin who probably plays Ash and Twitch.
---
190 and 192 sisters? Dear lord
---
Yep.
---
Don‚Äôt give me that crap lol.
---
Where did I say I'm good? I said Cap is fun not "OMG LUL 10 SECOND CAPITAO ACE"
---
No I think I remember someone saying that Xbox had like 1 million players an PC 1.5
---
flair checks out
---
Gridlock + Capitao for that M249 dominance.
---
Clean your screen
---
Alright, you sold me. Let's do it.
---
It's ok, Prinpaed, I still love you even if you dont love me.
---
Other balancing changes would have to be made to accommodate this but it would make the game so much more interesting. Right now high level ranked is all about pixel angles and it's boring as fuck.
---
I‚Äôm just imagining a nomad thing pushes them into it
---
Alright, thanks for the tips and advice!
---
I wanna throw up
---
While the ACOG is agreed to be the "best" sight, that depends on the person. For example, I don't use the ACOG on Twitch's F2 because I can't handle the recoil (Mock me all you want) whereas I can easily handle it with a holo or reflex.
---
Some people will always use the ACOG, given the chance, or those like me will sometimes use it. It's a moot point, I think.
---
You could direct that love and devotion to being a legit player. Mr Deranker
---
i don‚Äôt think you understand the best way to use alibi; use the prismas as a makeshift alarm system for doorways and windows
---
Depends how you play Ash
---
That thing is shit
---
No dummy you seem genuinely nice and have dick friends
---
One of a few ideas i totally agree with.
---
It's the only way to get a quick fix tho, necessary evil. Just don't play ranked for a few days i guess
---
I wish his turret did ~5 damage when penetrating shields. Nowhere near instant kill, but still enough to perfectly deter at range.
---
Hmmmmmm, I can not, for all my love is with you, my love.
---
Don‚Äôt buy ela. Her gadget is okay but her gun is very hard to control.
---
I think they can learn from each other, having to use overlay to invite and accept is far from OK.
---
Wow seriously? I get downvoted for asking questions? What the fuck is wrong with you fools?
---
You're getting a lot of deserved hate in these comments.
---
No it‚Äôs not. Stop trolling both here and on Siege. Deranker.

**OMAE WA MO, SHINDEIRU**
---
I never understood the ela craze, shes a twig
---
Holy cringe...
---
Missed the head
---
Why is it for scumbags? It's not like you can't counter it and half the time it's a free kill for attackers. It's a high-risk high-reward strategy for defence.
---
Just don't play hostage
---
Absolutely I am.
---
In ranked I will but in casual I like to pull off the pretend to be a decoy strategy with varying success, but the core of that strategy required no customization options.
---
Gridlock tho

Never happened to me or my squad but I play on pc

He's not from Europe. He's Bostonian.
---
Don‚Äôt get mad at people fucking off in fuck off mode. Get real, play ranked
---
Not smoke?
---
Making Tachanka's shield completely invincible would make him significantly more reliable. Unstoppable spawnpeeks might become an issue, but Casual now lets you pick your Attacking spawn so it shouldn't be too big of a problem.
---
Dont forget ash
---
Gtfo with #Buffbeard. Any gadget that allows someone to evade the one shot headshot mechanic, the sole mechanic that makes this game stand out from the rest, should never have existed in the first place.
---
[This far](https://i.imgur.com/V0GOxT4.png?1) up there?
---
what the hell kind of question is this
---
I'd let gridlock dom me tbh.
---
Eyy!, is not that short...
---
Ok yes is short
---
Well that one last Team kill
---
I‚Äôll shoot someone in the foot and get a headshot, like every time
---
I have it too, and I feel its more of a pay-to-lose elite skin, before you could put mats down anywhere without the spikes sticking up
---
Thanks!
---
read the sub rules and quit begging
---
And that is why this game is trash and i will never make it to plat
---
That's cool but you mind uploading a video?
---
Maybe instead of shield penetration, it slows them down similar to Clash shocks. More stagger potential than straight damage
---
Eyy!! I think I found my alt account
---
They should add a feature so that you can change how your home screen looks
---
You have a good point
---
uh no you don‚Äôt.
---
wanna play ranked some day my GT is ninga man84
---
I've always liked both of Kaids guns tbh, even though the AUG is pretty bad. What ever you're good with man
---
False.
---
What the fuck?
---
How would you know? It happens to me all the time
---
Kaid on his AUG before the damage buff would‚Äôve made sense. 
---
I also feel that ACOG should stay on doc and Rook but only on the P90. Maybe buff their kit a little to compensate. 
---
Tachanka makes sense as well, but a total rework might change this, especially if he gets a new gadget. His turret likely becomes a primary weapon.
---
nice ace bro
---
because that‚Äôs not how the game works genius. you don‚Äôt shoot someone in the foot and get a headshot. that‚Äôs ridiculous and false
---
That and bc of his exothermic charges you can make rush holes that wouldn‚Äôt be available otherwise
---
My god it was a joke, I‚Äôm just saying I get a lot of ridiculous headshots with Echo
---
Someone‚Äôs a little sensitive
---
Well then, actually i only play 3-speed operator, i block walls but i didn't grab the armor.
---
Dude I feel the exact same way. While the Roni has a small mag it makes up for in fire rate and recoil and the Commando has a bigger mag and more damage it's got more recoil and a slower fire rate. Both great guns in my opinion
---
You got 67 downvotes so far, just stop replying

I ain't mad, just surprised someone can be this much of a loser.

Its like an adult playing against little league, going all out, then saying "why are you mad? It's only a game." It's just pretty pathetic lol.
---
I don‚Äôt know I was dead
---
I completely agree
---
I just can‚Äôt understand shotgun‚Äôs recoil sometimes. And I don‚Äôt understand those comparisons betweeen it and other DMRs. You can chain shots pretty easy and accurately even with high recoil DMRs like SR-25 snd OTS-03, but this ‚Äúpseudo DMR‚Äù? It‚Äôs either you rely on lucky spam, or you shoot slowly with each shot, waiting for recentering of reticle.
---
Nah, I don't play siege that much anymore but it's definitely more than 100 hours

That's close to what we said, we said, "it's like going to the kindergarten playground and beating the shit outta the kids there."
---
What are your thoughts on changing him to three speed?
---
That already exists though. You can find that on YouTube and in game. Black Ice is only found on the original and Canadian ops, so people like to make fake ones for other dlc weapons
---
I do that to sometimes but its usually what I'm feeling for me. Like I'll be using the Roni for a few matches then switch to the Commando and then the cycle continues.
---
idk
---
boy this joke isn't fucking old and tired yet, no sir
---
Where is it?
---
Why you gotta do them dirty like that

Oh so you're only an asshole in one way? congratulations

Honestly, I don't get the deal, but then again, I don't use acogs in the first place...

"This meme from 2 years ago still EPICLY FUNNY. YOURE WRONG BRO. Also Tachanka? EPICLY HILARIOUS, YOURE JUST STUBBORN"
---
Nice
---
It has nothing to do with being offended, and the clip isnt funny either.
---
Its annoying to see these virgin fucks post the same crap over and over again, its like this sub contains 90% edgy 13 year olds now days. But keep defending these moronic retards which think sex is the only thing that matters.
---
This sub is fucked, and you and op are one of the many reasons.
---
I've brought this issue up countless times because I'm the same I get to gold 1 but have never been plat because of m&amp;k users, I think a report button would be good if ubi put the time into it to asses the report players because it is clear to see when someone uses m&amp;k and when someone uses controller, movement is different, aiming is different, everything is completely different
---
If you're on the defending team that does this, you can revive the hostage.  You'll probably get TKed for trying, but at least you'll have tried to do the right thing.
---
They can be beneficial to some ops but in reality a sight doesn‚Äôt make you a better player. I honestly also dont get why people are so mad
---
I play literally only casual and I see holos actively trip people up. I don't go for the full bit of pretending, since yeah it is like a 40 60 chance that they shoot you but still.
---
Besides the thing of being easier to spot, like with Jaegers "please headshot me" basketball helmet, there shouldn't be a thing where an operator's kit is actively worse due to her cosmetics.
---
Boo frickity hoo
---
Can be played well....in coordinates teams....by small percentage....etc.
---
Too many factors to call Castle a really valuable operator ATM.  If he would have a small pickrate, but much higher, around 2 - (-2) percent winrate, i would definitely call him ‚Äúbalanced, situation operator‚Äù(like Ying). But nope, he is down there in the bottom, alongside Chanka.(Note: graphs showing the stats for plats/diamonds. Imagine the state or Castle in lower tiers).
---

Exactly
---
I dunno man, me and my friends are relatively trash and through teamwork we get plat every season on xbox. There are people playing on MnK, I won't deny that but I feel with proper teamwork and comms you can easily beat these guys cos usually they just run around trying to get an ace thinking they're next level.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
It‚Äôs really not that useful at all, especially in this situation, but if you open up the top Mira you can throw a grenade or something through it
---
Well if someone was reported multiple times in the past __ amount of games then they would be suspended or something
---
That's pretty funny.
---
It‚Äôs a team based game. I‚Äôm okay with Castle being best when coordinated. He still has a use. I only play in a duo most of the time and we still find uses for Castle on occasion. 
---
Not every op needs to be viable on every site, like your Jagers or Smokes. Some are niche. I honestly wish there were more ops that were incredible in niches but weak elsewhere. It makes you think more about picks. 
---
But agree to disagree. I certainly see what you‚Äôre saying. I think we just value different kinds of balance in operators. Which is fine.
---
Putting the sound off, this is the most peaceful and chilled push I've ever seen
---
If you pick an operator and the objective doesn't fit with your plans, it's on you to adapt. That's just part of the Siege experience. 
---
Even versatile operators like Buck will be less effective on certain maps, depending on variables as simple as vertical destruction.
---
https://youtu.be/JGhoLcsr8GA?t=195

I need more... please! Can you try bandit?
---
It was when year 2 pass was released, so no.
---
That plat was most likely being low ranked boosted to diamond, he could have probably gotten slot more kills if he were a real plat.  Good job at beating shitters
---
If you're on the defending team and your teammates do this, please just revive the hostage.  You'll probably get TKed for trying, but at least you'll have tried to do the right thing.
---
You want to get the *High Ground* ?

Probably never because you can‚Äôt physically hack on xbox

Zofia‚Äôs launcher can destroy deployable shields, leaving Tachanka‚Äôs torso and legs exposed. Twitch‚Äôs drone could be used to take out the ADS leaving him vulnerable to grenades. Maverick can be used to create a small peek behind Tachanka. Gridlock can be used to force Tachanka off the turret. Sometimes you just have to take the L and leave that route alone. Making his shield unbreakable won‚Äôt make him unbeatable. Currently his turret is useless once enemies know where it is. Being on the turret means you‚Äôre stationary. Being on the turret after the shield has been broken (which will usually happen VERY quickly) means you‚Äôre asking to get shot in the head.

No, that's racist! Not funny! Your sense of humour does not align with mine and is, therefore, wrong!
---
It would be noisy, and it would have flashing red lights. It could also be destroyed by frags, twitch drone, EMP grenade, melee attack, gun fire etc. Kaid's and Bandit's gadgets could destroy it.

how to kill a *bad* blitz 101 FTFY
---
I haven't played in a while. When did they change Hibana's face again? This seriously has to be the third or fourth time.
---
There was no joke, your the shortest comedian ever mate
---
His outfit description sounds like lions
---
T
---
I‚Äôm a simple man. I see a blitz die, I upvote.
---
You‚Äôre a shit comedian mate, there was no fucking joke
---
Exactly, same on conulate garage and probably a few others
---
S
---
Oh cool!
---
He did tho üòÇ
---
I wondered this too because my stats for IQ were really bad but she had my highest op stat and my top op Docs stat was a lot lower than hers basically it‚Äôs how many times you used their ability. But for specifically what they check. Which is why ops like IQ would be really high because whenever you can any electronic you get a point but for doc you‚Äôd have to revive a teammate for a point etc etc
---
SOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
What did he do to kill the blitz?
---
Lmao.  If that was ranked....
---
Also: i definitely dont have a cooling issue as you can see my temps in the video...
---
Anyways: I do expect help here or fixes from ubisoft and their support team
---
I like it but for the defender I think Kapkan is just better because he has more and it does damage, plus it can be heard because it‚Äôs an explosion
---
Black magic i guess
---
Clash main here.
---
I don't need an acog. The MP9 is fine how it is, and its default sights are wonderfully good. She's an effective spawnpeeker without the acog.
---
Audio glitch. Nice bait though.
---
Im so sorry if I perhaps hurt your feelings
---
2 tracks, 7 pings, 9m scan range and give him claymores in place of breach charges
---
I could understand that being a nerf, im just telling you what they revealed during the invitational.
---
Bandit, Kaid, and Mute: Am I a joke to you?
---
Prob cause this map is the title but in a image
---
You're really just more pathetic than garbage at this point.
---
haha more downvotes. this subreddit hates me
---
Common, man. You can't sit there and tell me Ela isn't THICC

i‚Äôve not had many audio glitches now, everyone else has tho, but i used to get them all the time
---
I agree
---
The one Jack Bauer is in
---
Apparently enough to do 50 damage to me
---
No bro, I think I was the one who misunderstood your second reply lol  
---
Just didn't wanna leave my idiot replies there as reddit heroes love to downvote everything.  
---
Seriously, we're cool! No hard feelings :)

peeked
---
That's the mouse pro league skin for the k1a on vigil
---
He didn't have much of a chance tbh
---
You. I like you.
---
i  literally do it in every map
---
My first one was for r4-c
---
I forget the source, but I recall a Dev explaining why they can't/won't implement a bolt rifle in siege.
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was bad
---
Looks like blitz went to ADS and he shot blitz in the head.
---
Can we just get an option to turn off debris? It‚Äôs literally as simple as that. Then people who have it on can‚Äôt complain about dying to it since it‚Äôs your choice to leave it on.
---
This is actually garbage... why is it getting upvoted? Fucking Bots probably
---
Thanks, I'm that kinda guy when something gets stuck onto my mind it just messes the rest of my day. Have a nice day xD

I just got it as my 2nd one

I've noticed them a whole lot more rampant after the last update.

Goodbye.

Lol someone‚Äôs salty
---
There are shield skins now?
---
Ubisoft: removes black beard's acog
---
IQ WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
---
Chalet sucks I hate it
---
for me it would be that the surround sound is completely messed up, droning is weird or the sound has completely gone, sometimes only playing one constant sound
---
Will never understand why they brought back Favela but keep Bartlett out.
---
People be hating over a shield skin idea. It‚Äôs not likes theirs much to chose from anyway.
---
I would put it on the shield rather than have nothing else.
---
I played with this guy, he's pretty good
---
No, current bug
---
Ubisoft needs to hire right now!!!

A bit off topic but how do Seasons work in Siege? Do Seasons change as they change in real life or do they change on 4 specific days every year?
---
Yes and this is the only map I want out other than Kafe but at least Kafe is getting fixed next season. Chalet has this weird feeling no matter what side you are one. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs restrictive on both sides and you feel like you can get cornered very easily and are very few openings for rotations or breaches. Hopefully Year 5 will hold a rework for this map.
---
When I die, I just spam ping all around me.

Her traps can be used to cover the bomb going going down or distract while you or a teammate run into site and her guns are really good for holding angles but nomad is still better

Don‚Äôt

There is a shield glitch right now
---
Same I remember the name. Actually played a game with him on plane. Pretty decent dude.
---
Ah thanks
---
Shame, I always liked the tactical planning part of Raven Shield.
---
The hp would be worth it with a doc but ya you are exposed
---
Played this like it was my Job back in the day!!!
---
Gosh you're adorable, do you want a hug? It must be hard work being this mad at a stranger on the internet. Most children learn by 4 years old that temper tantrums don't get you anywhere but I can see you're just a little bit special. I'm guessing you were held back a year or two at school...
---
 What the actual fuck. Good job but holy shit that‚Äôs scary
---
Do you know what chalet will look like? Did it get leaked?
---
can somebody explain plz, what JFK means
---
I could see an operator with a microwave emitter being added. Defense of course, just one, twice the health of Chanka's shield? That would do about the same thing as Clash but stop you from having to physically be there.
---
That would be so good
---
It wasn‚Äôt confirmed I was just wishing lol
---
It's a glitch that I like to call an unofficial nerf lol

Good thing that blitz has ridiculously long cooldown, saved me countless times
---
More like Ela T H I N N
---
they're every 3 months. we just started one early march
---
I hope so, it would really help add some depth to the game. Hasn't Overwatch done stuff like that before?
---
shhhhhh

What a touchy feely asshole. Doesn't have any real life achievements, tries to sound confident online and win at computer games. What a pathetic form of human being.

@silver\_zepher there did it.

.... i dont ave that reddit extension or whatver so thats just plain text actually ....

At first i thought you talked about Outback and was about to really talk shit to you about how you could find that utter trash... then i noticed you where stating important things, and for the love of god i agree !!! I utterly and purely hate the new hereford and i want too see it shot so far away that i can only play that shit in Thunt !!   
---
Regards fortess... send it to casual but get it the F out of my ranked playlist.   
---
Now we are on it..... Fuck Tower!!!!   
---
Ahh now that felt good !
---
Rekt

Lol its you
---
Oh, well yes kinda. If you look up their Year 4 panel from the Six Invitational on YouTube they did show some of the changes that are coming to Kafe and Kanal and only a brief idea of what is to come of Theme Park.
---
He doesnt hurt the game being useless there bigger issues hurting the game why would they waste time changing him to possibly hurting the
---
We were once playing strat roulette and we won with 0 kills because the enemy kept killing the hostage
---
They had us in the first half, I'm not gonna lie.

Maybe make the change from white-blue-black less dramatic but it looks great!
---
I would black ice my car

Fun Fact 69420#: If tachanka is on the left of Vigil on the select screen it will look like God is so muscular that he invaded Vigil's space
---
Because people don‚Äôt blow the thermite charge while sitting in the closet with no cover, an impact is less important than a c4, taking a small amount of damage isn‚Äôt a big deal at the cost of taking out key utility, thermite has 2 charges, there are more operators with impacts than c4,  often times people push from the front door to upstairs so they‚Äôd destroy your c4 in the process, if you‚Äôve shock wired or kaid‚Äôd the wall the enemy team is gonna emp nade the area, and running downstairs to preplace a c4 can be a valuable waste of prep phase especially for operators with lots of prep phase tasks like Valk or Kapkan
---
why did they discontinue black ice after operation black ice?
---
yup
---
I'm really happy that the mods didn't delete this
---
Do you know now ?
---
Yes, thankfully
---
Mav or Jackal
---
I was playing since the start as well with about a two season break before Velvet Shell. Feel free to disagree. But in my personal opinion he was decent only needing minor tweaks right before the speed buff. He was a good op when used well, but most people just didn't use him properly. The speed buff broke him, and now he'll continue to suffer because Ubi instead of reverting the change, decided to cripple him in other aspects and will continue to do so until he is considered trash again.
---
I find that extremely disappointing, since I have been maining him for a long, long time.
---
When the fuck did downvotes mean anything

Nice work!

First of all, you can explode the c4 while they are placing the charge, and you don't have to pre place a c4, you can use a valk cam, mozzie drone or pulse scanner to see when they are putting the charge , throw the c4 and kill them
---
me like
---
You can stop worrying about grenades now
---
Black ice or something else? Sounds really cool and I can‚Äôt believe I missed it
---
I‚Äôve understood that if you place it right Trax will deploy where the player stands. But either way, even with an invincible shield there will be plenty of ways to counter him
---
yeah black ice for all the new operators
---
Goodü§£
---
You can just impact trick from below but I dig

Since this was reddit.

I almost didn‚Äôt see the /s lol
---
Aw man, I'll have to check tomorrow. I had no idea about that ;-;
---
It was his combo with Lion and Finka that made him broken but Lion got hit by the nerf truck and Finka is barely picked and very hard to coordinate since Para Bellum
---
I like you you've got the right ideas here
---
Yes the skin looks trash but have you seen a single pro league set
---
If that came out I would nut
---
Still waiting for someone to black ice one of their guns irl
---
I have mixed feelings but if we're prioritizing maps that need to be taken out of ranked. I'd take Hereford out first anyday

Operation health...
