Well nothing‚Äôs gonna stop this blitz main im almost at 2 days of blitz so im not stopping now
---
I‚Äôm fine with leaving her in the same category at tachanka. Although she could be tweaked to make her viable, I don‚Äôt think she is good for the game.
---
I (in silver 3 before this match) just got put against a (what I think was a five stack) of gold 1s and 2 of them had 11-12 kills (this was on ps4) they were definitely using mouse and keyboard+on smurf accounts
---

---
Gotta love the matchmaking
---
didnt know they added the krummlauf into siege!
---
*claps in gucci*
---
Imagine actually leaving the house in these
---
I mean, I got gold 2 duo queueing and I just started playing in December. Gold 3 rn, and on Xbox it‚Äôs mostly people boosting above gold 2. I got into a game with 4 coppers and a plat 2, while I was gold 3 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. People wanna ruin it for me, why can‚Äôt I do it to them? 90% of the looking for group posts on Xbox are: bronze and below free carry.
---
What did I say
---
Not too bad, it‚Äôs the thought that counts.
---
I‚Äôm still over here struggling to draw a straight line
---
What about weighing the highest rank on the team more heavily to create the average MMR?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Either way something needs to be done. I Soloq often and just finished a game in Plat III playing against a diamond , "Unranked",  Plat 2 and two low golds. My squad had myself , two other plat III's and two TRUE low golds. To soloQ into plat you literally have to play at a high plat/diamond level  and carry to overcome these cheese tactics because your teamed up with people who are ACTUALLY  the skill level of the rank they have.
---
All maps I don‚Äôt have a problem with with. They‚Äôre gonna massacre them like Hereford base
---
It was actually a gift for a friend. I got him addicted to siege and he likes Doc probably more than I do. I made it for him because he officially played siege for a year. (Yes I kept check because I had a feeling he would like siege as much as I do and I knew from the beginning I wanted to do something cool for him.) He said he likes it a lot, even though it looks like ‚Äúa really nice kindergartener made it‚Äù of course he said that with gratefulness lol
---
exactly how my chanka looks. scary
---
Yes
---
That‚Äôs gaming for you.
---
They could just balance it that way then
---
Now that‚Äôs bad..
---
And to make it even worse, the rook looks like he‚Äôs an EU region hopper (or NA if OP is in EU)
---
P90 is good imo one of the first guns I actually enjoyed
---
Yeah it‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm not gonna expect for this game to be perfect and toxic free, but shit at least fix the matchmaking system for platinum and low ranks queueing together
---
You live a risky life
---
Nice you edited it.
---
Yuck, but oh well what can I do? have fun train man
---
No dlc ops challenge?
---
Wacc. But seriously the shield desync is really bad
---
you died thats wat happened
---
Not a woosh and you spelled it wrong.
---
I only have it for the revolver. All I need.
---
Usually end up plat 3 (or around that) on console while solo queuing. Not the best, not the worst
---
head shots
---
I understand head shots and I try that but it still won't register
---
your ping
---
probaly a 4 stack lost a person and decided to all just leave
---
Maybe
---
Think I‚Äôll have to start doing so and I doubt there is but if so then they are seriously overestimating my skill at this game, I‚Äôm joe average, I just want to have fun. I play ranked mostly just to see what I get ranked as and carry in as casual.
---
I like encrafting better.
---
M&amp;kb
---
I want that shit
---
Were you typing with your feet or something lol
---
Resources that are easily accessible by literally almost every attacking op. If anything they just give the attackers easy cover when moving past doorways. Only a few attacking ops in the game don‚Äôt come with explosives and even then they are easy to deal with.
---
wallpaper engine will like to talk
---
you forgot to add the spawnpeeking
---
Definitely do. It's a bit hard to follow at first but when it comes together it is an awesome story.
---
For your particular mouse, Go 600 DPI, 15/15/83. The G502 is a bit heavier, so it needs a little faster sensitivity to make up for that heavier weight.
---
Is this an actual skin that‚Äôs coming? Or just fan made skins?
---
Your opinion is invalid
---
I get it dude, I personally don‚Äôt suffer from this, but recently reddit has exploded with hits not registering.
---
Alright ill give it a try
---
Which Navy?
---
Came here to say the same exact thing. I wish there were a way to filter clips in this subreddit by PC vs Console. Console clips are just so painful and uninteresting to watch due the inability to properly aim on a controller.
---
Alright
---
1. Yes but good crosshairs placement can avoid that.
---
2. 300 in cas 400 in ranked
---
3. A season
---
4. Nay
---
5. On the subreddit and on their news website
---
6. No
---
I think I saw that one once in a YouTube video, I can‚Äôt really remember though.
---
Alright thankyou I will try. it gets hard though since they always say stuff about it and then I start playing bad and blame it on the sens
---
alright thanks for the recommendation
---
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve probably never played with a good castle then by what your saying.  Castle can be extremely useful in most situations and can change a game drastically (either good or bad). I just don‚Äôt think you understand that yet. I look forward to you learning more and changing your list.
---
Zofia should be higher
---
It's all too real. Problem might be isolated to xbone though. Or you just haven't noticed.
---
That‚Äôs the sad truth isn‚Äôt it...
---
"we dont do that here"
---
I saw it and I thought there was a new operation for some reason so I click and I was a bit disappointed
---
A plat, a silver, 3 golds on both teams. It can‚Äôt get much more balanced than that.
---
In this minecraft day\*

I remember that when the terrorists killed the little girl in the theme park, I shouted FUCK OFF and got angry. 10/10 best book ever.

9x19vsn and gsh18 on the Russians
---
G36c and m1014 for the FBI
---
M870 for Jager/bandit
---
All of Frosts guns (so the 9mm for Buck as well)
---
L85 for sledge and Thatcher
---
Imma take a bet and say finka, because she can temporarily heal and you have a doc in your name!
---
Look like an old woman
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking about his ability. I am talking overall, if his gun makes him better then why isn‚Äôt he a good operator?
---
Maybe provide timestamps?
---
Can confirm
---
Get a notepad. Whenever you die in a dumb way that makes you mad. Rip out a page and tear the page into tiny pieces until next round.
---
This isn't so like dont throw shade at me lmaoo
---
I still appreciate your input on the matter 10/10
---
Oh yeah I draw stick figures. That‚Äôs it. If you look closely you can see I drew sledge‚Äôs hammer on the other side of the paper.

You are already set just fiddle with windows sound and in game sound settings to get it to your liking. I use a 15 dollar headset and am gold 1, 32 elo away from Plat3

Killcams aren‚Äôt 100% accurate for the victim.
---
I know but IQ was like oh clip that she know something fishy happened
---
Are you having a bad day? Your last couple of comments have been unusually hostile
---
&gt;They aren't doing shit 
---
What, have you been playing with potato internet from a hut or something? Ranked changes were announced at the start of the year and will be coming in season 2. They also spoke about rank gap for matchmaking in the post about hackers.
---
You either get aware, or stop playing. Make a choice. It isn't hard. But the least you could do is search before making pointless posts.
---
Pretty neat stuff dude, as many people have told you, just make the pieces apart and stencil them so they come out neat. Would like to see more later!
---
Are you seriously that dense? The art team is COMPLETELY SEPARATE from the balancing team and coding teams. They even said that in y4 dev blog. Cosmetics take almost no time and are worked upon separately. The art team doing their job doesn't impair the fixes team in doing theirs.
---
Okay, Ill check it out. Im pretty much set on Ash and potentially Dokkaebi if she's any good, I still need to find defenders I like though. Appreciate it.
---
#Because castle has been crying for one since beta

Because it provided good destruction AND damage.
---
That shotgun has some really good rotation hole potential. A DMR can't do that.

Remember, slug or not, it is, after all, a shotgun, and had the benefits of a shotgun without the disadvantages of a buckshot.

---
Speaking from experience?
---
if you don‚Äôt restart the queue after 2 minutes you‚Äôre wasting your own time. it‚Äôs common sense
---
Hmmm ok
---
Thanks! Just from your description they sound kinda like a series I used to watch in the Black Ops 1 days called SnD for Dummies and I started stomping pubs so hopefully I pick things up as well in this game (even though this game is obviously a higher skill ceiling)   
---
I bet my friend I could hit diamond on PC in 1 year but I've been procrastinating starting out lol. Appreciate the info :)
---
This is happening to me too right now. It's so annoying
---
Honestly if you use anything but melee as Doc you're a coward
---
I like variety
---
This happened to me tonight. Exiting out of uplay and restarting it + siege fixed it for me
---
Same thing here, whole game is being really annoying today in general

I bought (What I thought was) a Monty figure from Target recently because I wanted the code; however he didn't come with one and is apparently an inch smaller. Some people are saying there's apparently two versions but that just sounds really peculiar. Is that actually true, or have I unfortunately gotten a bootleg? It just seems strange they'd release two different versions without telling anyone the second one is waaaay different.
---
1 to 2 seconds of freeze, then loads.
---
You can do that with any edition
---
That's not variety, mate. That's anxiety.
---
A good Doc always heals the drones in prep to gain their trust
---
So why do you use a Xim adaptor? It is obviously cheating. Does it make you feel superior? That crap is pathetic in my opinion and you all should be banned for using it.
---
just made me think it would be a good opportunity for them to add another russian op
---
Sputnik instead of spetsnaz
---
No it‚Äôs real. I have both versions of Monty
---
I agree with this. I usually duo, and I play frost a lot. I can rattle off where my traps are in 5 seconds without any issue, because there's only 3 and windows or stairs are normally a good call.
---
Kapkan traps can cover like 5 doors/windows. You might have them only from one approach, or fanned across a site. And having so many makes it harder to list them all.
---
Outstanding move!
---
Where? **I WANT LINK ASAP!** I want to know how close it is to the comics.
---
/s
---
Oh ok. Why would they release two but not say anything about the 2nd one having a different box/no code?
---
There‚Äôs like 10000 versions of endgame in comic version
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
it replaced the crafting table recipes for banners and patterns, making them easier to create.
---
Usually the other way around
---
True. There is a 3 part infinity war series as well.
---
I have something similar to this. Basically I hid in a dead body but I lost plus I had no chance of winning
---
Even not playing her there's a seriously loud snapping thud when they go off. Don't know whether it's a glitch but it feels like it's basically map wide.

I hate you

Thanks mate, But I‚Äôm yet to find out

What code do they come with?
---
So by shoot you mean melee hit?
---
Do u even know how angles work
---
Sounds a lot like COD Zombies but they have guns, which sounds pretty fun
---
LMAOOO. LOOK AT THE KILL CAM. HE SHOT THE WALL. LEGIT DIDN‚ÄôT SEE DOC‚Äôs HEAD.
---
Was there supposed to be a video
---
Yeah it is basically CoD zombies. MW3 Survival is just BO zombies with guns :D
---
Holy shit dude, that guy just said ‚Äúhey man you tried and that‚Äôs all that matters‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt even say if it‚Äôs good or bad. The people in the comments are giving op feedback on how he could improve. You‚Äôre just being a massive cunt for no reason. Good luck with making the world stronger btw, you sound like the man for the job.
---
Cool
---
Yeah he sees his fucking soulder and tries to hit his fcking head. Here is a educating vid about angles and perspective https://youtu.be/5e8HZqF3cyk you might learn something.

And ever pixel in r6 is not that well made there can be small spots they forgot to brush so bullets can go through it

That's the Swiss flag, not the Red Cross.

Lmao bronze scrub
---
Yeah I sent it because you get the concept but you are that stupid I cant arguee with you. Have a nice day lovely citizen.
---
No they can melee they just shove rather then kill, but cant shoot their pistols after for a recovery time
---
It's hard to derank when you only lose 10 min elo

Yeah but that's not the kinda cheat ubi can confirm, it depends from Sony and Microsoft and i don't think they will do sonething about it

use a guitar hero controller - superior input system

no

castle clash or tachanka for defence, recruit with frags on attack. it‚Äôs meta

nobody said smoke because they are all coppers. 83% pick rate in pro league because he can counter smoke with toxic smoke. he wins rounds
---
Just an fyi, you should have blocked all names because witchhunting is against the rules and your very long thoughout post may be deleted. But i get it, its annoying. 
---
The reason they won‚Äôt fix it is because it will segregate the community and prevent friends playing with friends or other helping people get better with more challenging opponents. In the few legit cases of a plat playing with a bronze or silver teammate. They may have a friend who isn‚Äôt quite as good as them or play nearly as much. But with that yes there are quite a few non legit methods of a diamond playing AS a copper.
---
Wtf
---
Yeah I know that
---
But does it really matter? It‚Äôs just a killcam not the actual true play.
---
I have no clue either

I mean, do we really know its just killcam? I swear I wasn't peaking it

Yes, but you can also DDOS the person not just the server.
---
You're not

Is it not?
---
OP isn't implying you will die instantly

it makes sense since, hitting someone with a shield shouldn't kill them that easily. Putting a knife in their neck, now that *SHOULD* kill them.

Please do other operators

Correction: ANZAC is Australian and New Zealand forces, not British/Commonwealth. Although the British did assist the ANZACs, the ANZACs are completely seperate.

why did you fricks downvote this
---
Well done. I enjoyed it
---
Not much for me on PC
---
I think I have the answer... Yes (blind people still can't see that..)
---
Again though how often would a drone like this be able to get to a hatch in time to destroy it to be useful. When defending the first thing you usually want to get is the hatches. I honestly stand by my idea of a bulletproof/bullet resistant  drone that can‚Äôt jump and moves slower and louder. The ball surrounding the drone would be like the glass on the bulletproof camera or something like that which would make it slower due to being heavier and louder for the same reason. The only way it could be truly destroyed is by explosives or melee. I think this could be a great operator gadget but idk how the rest of the community would take it so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here
---
please don‚Äôt be one of those people that use reddit to promote their youtube and twitch
---
Tbh, im just trying to make sense and balance on the challenge since most new players or people who dont have any SASR ops cant unlock the charm
---
Im using my played hours in combination with my rank to show that im an experienced player who actually knows a lot about this game.
---
DIAMOND PICKAXE
---
Fair enough man. In that circumstance, I'm fine with the British/Commonwealth operators as described before :)
---
It should also take into account previous seasons MMR. There also needs to be a reason to want to stay in the highest rank possible, so ubi should make it so what ever rank you finish on is the charm you get, the current way is horrible. You get the diamonds who get there rank and then derank because they know at the end of the season they get a. Diamond charm anyway. Even have renown rewards for the higher you place the bigger the renown rewards. Any incentive to stay high rank really

---
At this point my elo gains/loss per match are around 10-20. I didn't even bother checking how much I lost after the round
---
you get your points back, only and when the cheater you played with is banned, 
---
i received about 50points back, but the only two times i recall that i  played against blatant cheaters was 1 month ago.
---
unfortunately there is no system that ban cheater faster so you have to hope that battleye does its work , it require time since cheating software are updated as well.
---
Please tell me why.
---
Same with me for him switching back to his primary, however he did still clutch it though
---
To be fair Im a better than average console player and the other team REALLY wanted to add that 1 kill to their score

Rainbow Six  | Edit

Ya i got -18 points yesterday for getting a hacker on team and tbh im not mad

Little buggers are far from bulletproof lol, sent one flying down a set of stairs in my last semester coding class and it shattered into a million goddamned pieces lmao. Not a bad idea though.

Why is it, that not having an elite skin is an issue? (your words)

They never were there to begin with. I solo queued into a ranked match and had no teammates. Literally not one.

But you don't join ongoing match in ranked isn't it?
---
Not enough cluster charge kills
---
Maybe they have friends or I dunno.... a life?
---
r/softwaregore
---
So then is this post based on dps or how good the gun is cause I‚Äôm pretty sure that guns not top tier any more based on experience.
---
Nice job! I was sweating for you at the end there lmao
---
*Fuze is trash
---
Because hostage is shit
---
cyka blyat
---
Lol why were they all stacked
---
In my experience doc are selfish boyes
---
A customizable reticule would be simply perfect.
---
People want a colorblind mode, a customizable sigh will help a lot.
---
3 bullets dream
---
No
---
Well fuze isn‚Äôt bad in certain circumstances but if you JUST use fuze there are usually better ops to use
---
don't play much ranked but last i played i was gold 1 hahaha
---
thanks!
---
Oof what oof are oof you oof gonna oof do oof about oof it oof bitch oof
---
The game matchmaked them into the match but they never connected. So when they restart the game (if their queue never starts and says 30 second estimated wait time) they'd then connect and join.
---
Cool, gonna look for it. Thanks.
---
p226 better than smg11 change my mind
---
I think bullet PROOF would be a bit overkill, causing defenders to waste valuable explosives on drones. However, rolling on walls and ceilings would be fairly balanced, maybe bright lights or louder audio cues to alert defenders?
---
You better watch yourself... one more time and I might get angry
---
Reminds me of that legendary smoke sitting on a couch in chalet
---
this is how I want to play.
---
There are inconsistencies in this post for sure, I think it's supposed to be a generalisation. 
---
If you read some comments, people point out that certain weapons are wrongly in lower tiers, despite being the same shots to kill as weapons above them. 
---
I suppose the DPS of the SMG11 is the best in the game of any full auto weapon. 
---
It could just be OP's opinion though to create discussion. Recoil doesn't appear to be factored in.
---
Go fuck yourself
---
Don't shot me or my son or my son or my son ever again.
---
Because most people have hostage turned off so there are less people playing
---
I use shield fuze and I don‚Äôt just use them all on objective, I use them to clear traps or place them on walls by the objective, lure people out and then fuze em
---
I fully agree. I think shield melee is too strong in a way, but this change would make alot of sense
---
If you aren‚Äôt prepared to try and improve then what‚Äôs the point in your post? You want Ubisoft allow attackers to spawn inside the building? It literally takes seconds to quickly check if a barricade has been broken
---
No idea RIP
---
impressive
---
Mad bc bad
---
*Screams while scanning area*
---
Master Buck. He's one of the most reliable soft breachers and if you can get gud with his C8 you can handle any weapon. On defense learn to shallow roam (roam nearby the objective and use passive ability operators like Mute and Rook so you'll be useful even in death. Your teammates will appreciate it
---
Quality post.
---
It wasn't him who killed the hostage
---
Friend 1 (Screenshot) got banned after Friend 2 killed the hostage

Not really, everything is normally the same when I play siege, same keyboard, same mouse, same controls, but just different play style, a lot of time I play casual since I do not have a squad to play Ranked with and a lot of people say I am tryharding on casual but in all honesty that is just how I learned to play the game, but when I play sometimes I play as if I never had a working tactic or a good way to play, its like something just turns off and I play like a bot.
---
r/R6STeams
---
Yeah, I need a way to chill out when I get mad at this game
---
How do you add your main on your name?
---
Having a team with helps a lot I used to rage but it got a lot better when I played with a mic
---
Oh wow. This is pretty cool! Thanks for clearing that up for me!
---
I like reflex over all oh god oh fuck
---
You‚Äôre right, there isn‚Äôt a single player component to Siege but for some players (myself included) it‚Äôs a fun way to invest yourself in the game by getting to see how each of the different characters interacts with one another. With the way things are now it fits both types of people really well players like yourself who aren‚Äôt as interested don‚Äôt have the lore of the game and it‚Äôs characters thrown in your face, but people like myself can go and find all the back story that they please. I‚Äôd love to see more cinematics, like the did for all the OG op‚Äôs or like the Hammer and Scalpel. But that‚Äôs just make take on it.
---
I had a ragdoll that stayed standing, I shot at him at least 10 times before I realized he was dead
---
The bad thing is he might have to do it again with the mozzie lmao
---
on mobile go to the top right and click the 3 dots. then click change user flair
---
If you're using the app, tap the three dots located in the upper right conner and select change *user flair*
---
He got this way because of an infected stim, we can‚Äôt give him another one :&lt;
---
On the sub‚Äôs home page, scroll down and look on the right under rules/mods/etc. You can add flair. Think it can only be done in a browser and not the mobile app.
---
Ok now do the same thing when people leave your team in the middle of the ranked match.
---
On PC go to the right hand side and look under "Community Options".
---
Delete this
---
I do take breaks from Siege when I get superheated, a lot of the times I do not play for 3-4 days but when I get back it kind of help but then I go back into the loop of losing a lot and then just rage quitting the game. Me and the game have a "I hate you, I love you" relationship.
---
new update is ruining the game. Like my ghost body is being shot before i even peak.. played since day 1 and ive never been more frustrated
---
Not really, they didn‚Äôt really want to go to Milan
---
even if your intention isn't to have an advantage over controllers it still isn't justified
---
that's pretty cool of them
---
‚Äúmom said it‚Äôs my turn on the xbox‚Äù

Waiting for an ultimate edition sale would've been the best thing.
---
Yeah, I have noticed that, when I play with someone it is like I take it more easier when I get mad, kind of like I just let it go easier.

Where‚Äôs the F2?

This is the J√§ger shield fiasco all over again
---
I think I'll unsub from this shitty ass subreddit 
---
All I get is stupid remarks just as idiotic ela fansarts 
---
This gameplay is so amazing dude you took time to edit and post this bullshit to Reddit and hoping for what ?
---
Welcome, to my humble abooooode
---
Yeah I completely agree with you, but I would personally go for the c4 to get a beauty kill xD
---
I certainly did
---
Well holding a nitro cell, barbed wire etc. but yeah you can't while holding a gun sadly.
---
Hibana is too good
---
Yeah I‚Äôd like this. For the gadgets that have an AoE, this should always be a feature. Like you said, Jagers ADS, Grzmot mines, even Gridlock trax initially, could all have AoE indicators.
---
No, it‚Äôs just slight advantage they get with the drone, I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs P2W
---
A shield to block damage? That‚Äôs a game changer, maybe the devs should implement that
---
haha, I was like that)
---
If you win against a hacker, is that not usually sweet victory?
---
That would be a good feature, and would reward people who play the game alot
---
I was panicked so hard about you standing near the claymore. One risks the jump out on you and you're dead
---
Straight to the boiler room
---
 I can‚Äôt tell if people cheat or if I‚Äôm just shit
---
people who shoot me to low health or shoot out my drones will be annihilated if i‚Äôm playing casual. i‚Äôm like maggy thatcher, don‚Äôt want to look like i‚Äôm easy to pick on so i stand up to it
---
Why are all legendaries ass lol

Reminds me of that line in Fallout 4 were your Character meets again Kellog, and one of the Dialogue options is basically the Sole Survivor saying ‚Äú I hope, when I‚Äôm old I go to Hell when I die. So I can kill you (Kellog) all over again for eternity.‚Äù Metal as fuck. This gave me the same feeling.
---
Enemy Blitz: noone can hit him, his shield blocks everything
---
Me playing Blitz: I know that feeling OP
---
It's been a while since i've watched the video that i mentioned. If i remember correctly, he mentions something about fuze's shield
---
How
---
What a surprise.
---
Ash dies first rushing.
---
Go. **figure.**
---
Idk but I don‚Äôt like bananas
---
Aiming on console is a struggle
---
Feels bad man
---
hell yeah brother
---
You‚Äôre also blatantly wrong about the C7e being the 4th most powerful gun in the game. It‚Äôs 2nd in DPS behind Fuze‚Äôs.
---
I'm CL 331 so I definitely understand the need for this however, the rewards would definitely need to be more enthralling at higher levels.
---
Certainly agree on this subject
---
you right and now that i watch it back i think that pulse was about to before i rushed him. üòÇ
---
I mean, I‚Äôve played with hackers on my team who used hacks to fuck their own team
---
I‚Äôm not to bothered since it‚Äôs my first legendary but I don‚Äôt have the op for it
---
It‚Äôs just a normal ash main. Nothing wrong.
---
Hell ya brother
---
Bro I've lagged out like 2 seconds before the end of the last round and gotten an abandon sanction before.
---
For your case though, I think you need to get a pastor to look at your computer.
---
Jesus autocorrect how did you mess that up
---
Oh my god it's Jason Bourne
---
Damn that‚Äôs epic
---
‚ÄúAssuming equal skill you will always win a 1v1 if you use these guns.‚Äù 
---
That‚Äôs a BONKERS statement. There are a retarded amount of factors involved with winning or losing a round of Siege, gun vs. gun is like... reason 3 on the list of why people die. First being Communications and second being shitty positioning.
---
Yeah. Maybe I just haven't gotten use to it yet.
---
Haha tachanka lord lol funny one
---
I added my flair
---
They don't have control over whether people use m&amp;k, that's up to Microsoft and Sony to regulate

Bro why y‚Äôall saying that‚Äôs bad, that skins ducking dope
---
Damn u got many downvotes (not me :)
---
you have 0 proof he did anything wrong so no. you can‚Äôt post it here.
---
The way people play on console is so weird compared to PC... Was my first thought then I realised this is clearly some guy playing with his buddies and wanted some sweet reddit karma, pretty lame.
---
It‚Äôs good but it‚Äôs technically only slightly above average. I‚Äôd say it belongs in tier 1-2 but definitely not 0.
---
Lol Xbox aim bots all day xD

This is for attack only

Then they invited me to party.

Nope. Not gonna do that. Don't party with toxic people. Isn't worth the risk.
---
I literally quit the game because of cheaters going unpunished
---
Comparatively it‚Äôs less powerful than all the shotguns DPS wise and just above the damage output of both revolvers in the game. It‚Äôs only a hair DPS above Fuze‚Äôs AK12 which is at a comfy 623.3 and sits at the top of primary DPS.
---
Yeah but the really bad connection is in red that is just a mild issue but shouldn‚Äôt be enough to cause that

But two of them were in his dome are you blind

In this hypothetical yes.

People think it's weird I'll do that but the amount of times it's worked out and I've managed to get a kill or two becuase someone was there has been ridiculous.
---
That tv looks weird am I right
---
absolutely 0 point to that
---
jesus u are retarded, same map pool on pc also... Oh im 200 elo away from diamond on pc also so ur "argument" is pointless
---
Jackal and Mira main first lol
---
Very big ouff in my heart
---
Hell yes. Thank you for this
---
It‚Äôs that ps4 skill base is lower, and there‚Äôs a reason the map pool is this way, because their ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù maps even tho some aren‚Äôt and should be removed from ranked
---
I'm more commenting on the part where you said you don't know how'd they do attackers VS defenders and that there is no lore.
---
The cinematic shows us that ranked and casual is training simulations for their job which is terrorist hunt.
---
I do not use msi afterburner. So uh rip
---
Ah the AR33. Love it when people have a brain.

You got MK11 right? That‚Äôs Fuze‚Äôs fatality

Dont know what you're talking about. This is a top tier player.

You ever try to play siege with a Wii steering wheel?

Do you think amd Radeon could be the issue?

looks like he was seeing how long he could evade you lol. there are youtube videos for this

Yo I'd love to sit down and eat.

and I thought I had bad aim....

well, I DO have bad aim, his is just worse.
---
Doesn't matter if it's red or yellow, connection issue means what you're seeing isn't exactly what is happening on server side or whatever. Could have been his shoulder you hit, but because of your connection issue it looks like a headshot.
---
I don't even know what to say
---
F

No, but I figured out my problem was the game was using 100% cpu usage

I have no idea, sorry.

Yeah

Just knife it, you're just waisting ammo
---
That sucks, your connection decided to shit the bed as soon as you shot him in the head.
---
Ps4 isn't this bad though, but yes definitely in a separate category from PC hahah.
---
Yeah I see where your coming from. 
---
I just wanted it to be more of a way to potentially counter traps when used effectively and timed well. If you know there is a grzmot mine and a Gu somewhere in a doorway, you could pop this and pass on through. Or maybe you could block (like a shield should) and pop this ability to block c4 or smoke canisters like you said. The counter is obviously the sound of the clunky shield and the obvious target that you are. You‚Äôd have standard shield mechanics and they aren‚Äôt the most advantageous to say the least
---
Assassins creed was successful financially so Ubisoft probably wouldn't be scared to do one
---
I used to do this thing on map I think kafe idk I was really bad and it was over a year ago but me and a friend as soon as we spawned in on attacking would start to move and I would shoot an enemy with my pistol in the foot and would run and hide and would watch to see if the person I shot would shoot my friend thinking he did it and one time I hide and turned around to watch and as I turned around I just saw the man blast my friend in the face with a pink shotgun
---
I don‚Äôt know how this would be considered toxic. If she likes em and gets kills with them.  Who gives a fuck what others think. If it works stick to it
---
I love this game, may I tell you guys a little story.
---
It was August 17 and Rainbow Six Siege, I have been wanting to buy it for a long time, so I knew  that now is the time. My first match, I just got into the building and just waited in a corner(lol) until my teammates died, then they said in ALL chat " MadVidak is a fu**ing noob" then I failed the clutch and I got kicked from the match. I almost refunded the game, I was so pissed at the game, until a couple days later I gave it another chance, I was not teamkilled, not kicked, but what I was is hooked to the game, no other game gave me such a satisfying feeling of winning and even losing. Teamkills would happen from time to time,  like maybe once a week and sometimes so rare that it happened once in 2 months. After 3 months with the game, I switched to ranked, teamkillers were rare but when in happens it scars you for some time, if I went to casual after Christmas, I would get teamkilled every match  so I just played ranked and T hunt and I was solo queuing. But at some point it started happening more and more, so I just quit, that is my question, how rare is it to find teamkillers in Rainbow Six Siege on PC.
---
Thank you.
---
great job
---
It was recent because if that was a casual the timer started at 330 not 4
---
Rank?
---
He can't track the most active roamer (cav) so I don't know.
---
Scenario 1: Hibana was actually clueless.
---
Scenario 2: Hibana knew you were with her the whole time and she too was pretending y'all were teammates, then when it was too late, she tried to escape.
---
The former seems more plausible tho...
---
You‚Äôre saying there is ttk issues, but you don‚Äôt want that changes or ‚Äúfixed?‚Äù
---
I think you could completely make a change to the way headshots work on this game and it would not only work but be a smooth transition. People would just have to learn not to pull out a pistol to map someone. It would be a great nerve to the shields and make the Deagle and Revolver have viable reason to be better. It would need secondary smgs like the smg11 when you can hip fire at someone‚Äôs ankle but have one lucky bottle hit the head and get a kill.
---
It would create a larger skill gap I think. But also balance out some skill gaps in the mid levels. It would be a great way to balance weapons without making them feel like shit or useless.
---
It had to be ping, no other reason both players were playing so poorly. Having played on console copper for fun, I have never seen something so bad.
---
He can track her, she just doesn't leave any footprints when she uses silent step so it's harder, I would fully recommend Jackal though, I also enjoy playing Hibana
---
&gt;&gt; if you tk someone because of a mistake they made, you're a horrible person
---
im sorry but if you start reinforcing next to an obvious mira strat and you dont stop when i knife at you, you deserve to be teamkilled

Had no idea it was a thing and now mine and yours are the only onea I've ever seen.

Well it's only visual, so it wasn't the game's fault you lost

Can I get this? I got spawn peaked on Oregon all game on ps4. They were cheating! /s
---
Yes it was. I thought my shield was fine but serverside it was sideways through my body. It was 100% the games fault.
---
They play as a full team and they the surrender at the end, how does this ruin the game for people that are trying to win? The enemy team does win. Maybe think before you write a comment :)

Because if you want suicide bombers just play terrorist hunt

The fact that she didn't figure out what was happening after you killed Sledge is actually mind-blowing

It‚Äôs an extremely niche spot you will only use when attacking hookah. If you can get defuser down in front of that window it‚Äôs game over.

Yep, no aim assist at all.

You make a point

he's about to dig the attackers a new asshole

You profited from a cheaters actions, willingly or not. You pay the price. Simple.

There's a joke that a plat III is a lucky gold I, and that's... sort of true. Generally speaking, Gold II/GoldI/PlatIIIs have the same issues, so they usually appear to perform about the same. At plat II, people tend to have a much better understanding of the meta and the basics of the game, and their overall approach to the game is more consistent than the people who are lower in the ladder. Notice that I'm not saying 'they play more consistently' or 'their individual play is more consistent', because that's what most of the people who get stuck bouncing from gold II to plat III always focus on. They YOLO fights that they shouldn't take, or go in without droning and simply assume that nobody is prepared for them. They have pocket strats that do weird stuff that will only work if the other team doesn't have a Thatcher, or a Ying, or a Maverick, etc. 
---
Somewhere in plat III, people have to go through the transformation and become a consistent player who adds value with his utility and can play multiple operators in the context of a variety of strategies. If they don't manage to make that transformation, then they drop back down to gold I eventually because they can't accumulate enough consecutive lucky wins to get plat II.
---
No, itms because so many people have it off so a hostage game never gets filled.
---
Bots
---
yeah but they plan on adding the ability to soley decide to vote kick the person who tk's you during a future patch. not to mention they are going to make it so that after a certain threshold of team damage is done, the team damage will then start to be self-inflicted back to you. it's just a matter of when they decide to implement it
---
Exactly what was going through my mindüòÇüòÇ
---
I've won a couple 1v5s because the defending team was stupid and all chased me outside.
---
This is the most painful thing i have ever watched.
---
Silver, I didn't claim to be one of those "good players" lol
---
It‚Äôs a 4 stack on casual, calm down
---
But once that is implemented, this entire list is pointless
---
His aim is trash and consider his Gamertag...do u expect anything less?
---
You just can't. You need to learn the networking basics my man. All players in the game are connected to a game server. Only the IP of the server is visible not from the other players. 
---
Let's take MW2 for example. That game worked with NAT. A player is the host and there you can see the IP's of all the players. In these days people would get easily booted offline.
---
yeah but to completely negate the effects of a mute call you have to be right next to or in a mute jammer already, if you spend even a few seconds being called any nearby enemy will instantly hear you
---
so honestly mute's use as a counter to dokk is pretty limited
---
Same. I rather take the kill and kill the teammate but you know, people never understand and they send you hateful messages or vote to kick or just kill you in the next round.  Yeah lately I‚Äôve been playing with another person to prevent that from happening.
---
In not sure but I a long time believer believe he would.
---
Can you say Tunnel Vision?
---
yup i agree, but this is current... and it could be an entire season or two before we see the changes

Try to analyze what other teams do. When you die or lose a round, try to figure out why and correct it. Also don't blame your team for everything, there are always things to can do better. Just try to recognize them and execute. One last thing, train your aim and play a lot, practice will continue to make you better.
---
Ok WTF is going on? üòÇüòÇ
---
Hi wizardwheel
---
More like unranked 2
---
The name though
---
When I use Jackal I usually just use his Eyenox and just never turn it off because on most maps it's still pretty easy to see with it on.
---
I hate when people screw around with the last kill because they're down. If it's me that's up I just shoot them and end it. If it's me down I turn away from them so I can't see whatever stupid sh\*t they're doing. (only a few seconds of it ends up on kill cam so the rest is wasted)

why would you accept an invite from the enemy, it's just common sense

I‚Äôm aware you are literally doing this for the attention of the devs but this is still super public. All you needed to do was show the glitch and say it ‚Äúfix please‚Äù. You don‚Äôt need to explain how it‚Äôs done 
---
Fair enough, it will be patched soon but it still gives people the idea of ruining people‚Äôs matches. Again just post this on the tts bug page and even go to the support team and they‚Äôll fix it
---
Wow, a Jojo and Minecraft reference in one post. Take my updoot

Big batty squakers on the discord sorry

I think gridlock ar Sofia ar almost and jackels ar is like it but a little faster shooting

You know what's funny is i know you're his buddy because you wouldn't have seen this otherwise. Nice try. You scumbags can circlejerk all you want you'll still be trash at the end of the day.

Ahhh the old alt f4 trick. Classic but evil

Whenever i see PUBG clips from PC I feel jealous about how much better it looks than on Xbox. It's usually the opposite for Rainbow6.
---
I'm utterly speechless!
---
Not really. You played with a cheater so you lose the MMR you won. You want to be boosted by a cheater?
---
Pc or console?
---
75 is for me right now im fine with that, try with 80 first.
---
That rework hit lion hard
---
Then don't dick around, lmao
---
I play at 80 and I‚Äôll never change it
---
I don't think you guys are playing siege, this is another game, must be!
---
Ok but how does that make it better than the reflex
---
Cheating in silver? Wtf hahaha
---
Lost 50 points yesterday. I play with the same 5 stack 99% of the time and I know none of us cheat. We have had a couple randoms here and there when we are only 3 or 4 of us, but I cannot remember ever playing someone that cheated.

While this is pretty funny, the time to kill the hibana was when  she was rotating round  and getting a good view on your teammates
---
I'm surprised he didn't get you with that turret.
---
instructions unclear, enemies shot my pp
---
Do you know the names of any of them?
---
Y know I didn‚Äôt like parabellum. For me it was basically my 3 month break cause I didn‚Äôt like it very much
---
The same thing happened to me the other day!
---
This is some console like awareness
---
Right but if this playlist is being populated by people they‚Äôre gonna have bad queue times as the game is restricting matchmaking by level, and that also means people are playing standard casual (I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre proposed mode is casual) have less people to match with and have longer queue times.
---
God, whats worse than an SJW, is an SJW that's ignorant about the game and its lore. Nomad and Kaid are Morrocan, not Arabic. Yes, Tom Clancy said himself that he would never let terrorists be playable characters. We understand that there are Middle Eastern ops that aren't terrorists, but this game focuses on Para-Military operations. 
---
Oh he deleted his account.... lmao
---
Gotta get my R6 credits ready since hes my main

That‚Äôs better than being silver lol

Just Waring others

*Laughs in spanish*

LOL. All the tilting back and forth (canting?) reminds me of a confused dog tilting their head back and forth like "huh?" "what?"
---
That's probably a good idea üòÇüòÇ
---
It makes sense, but for context I should add that they did almost nothing to help. I have no idea why they were removed because whatever cheats they had were clearly not working.
---
Gives u view behind the bar of hookah and couches by the window. When defensing hookah u can crouch behind the bar or even hide behind the bomb to protect yourself from that spot. The angle is almost useless besides providing pressure for anyone playing behind bar

i replayed this so many times and still cant understand why you didnt die from the claymore.
---
Cons...tachanka? Are you new here?
---
Not anymore
---
Tachanka is the paid actor
---
uhhh out of place but how do you get the hibana main thing next to your name?
---
I've allready reported a few buggs over at the Report site even with the exact steps provided like they want you to a year ago but noting ever happened. So i guess it would also be right to write here how it works. I totally get why your not to happy about me basically telling everyone how it works. I feel the same way but its necessary to do so the devs know where the problem lies to fix it as soon as possible. That is what i hope at least. 
---
And me just tipping in the caption "please fix" will get the post automatically removed. Happened to me a few times allready.
---
Very true
---
Cool.

Get a pc

If only i had the money

Im serious. How you gonna sit here and be like if only I had money and shrug off getting a job
---
it's for (not saying their leaked codenames) Year 4: Season 2 as the twitter mini reveals will likely begin May the 7th as finals are the 19th I believe and then that video will become un-private for either the American defender reveal first or the Danish attacker which will follow after a week of twitter reveals.
---
Although expect Kormora to leak the images of them both right before ubisoft reveals them themselves.
---
All flashes can blind you from behind if you are close enough to them
---
Reddit is reddit dude, talk to them
---
No clue what console is like XD
---
Well it probably wasn't the last match, it was probably one from last week or so. If you're right though, that does suck but to be fair only bad players use hacks.
---
No it's really not.
---
All of the robot dick
---
This made me anxious the entire time, wondering when Hibana will realise what's going on
---
I was waiting for it to be a 1v1 and the hi Ana would've still been clueless
---
I get it, thanks
---
I'm still shook too LOL
---
R4C does 39 damage
---
[ - ] 7
---
Im trying, not shrugging it off. Hence why i agreed guy
---
Your kd doesnt show the matches you have won
---
Pc is just more convenient to update and implement software to stop these things. For the mosf part on console you are limoted in the ways you can prevent cheating as it is a C O N S O L E and therefore not a pc
---
i see a long list of garbage ideas here
---
Eh, but you can negate *most* of it pretty easily, as most guns are extremely similar
---
If you dont lile certain cosmetic then dont fucking use it
---
Lol! Thanks for the honesty, I like a game with a learning curve it really feels rewarding once you master it
---
Literally the most common prefire spot in the game
---
Maybe it‚Äôs putting you on a different data server, my friend who lives in Florida is getting put in SCUS this season, when he usually gets out in EUS. Look up how to manually change servers on YouTube if this is the problem
---
Where's all the Monty msins
---
She has an acog....
---
I had pretty much this exact same idea, but to be used as a rework for Castle
---
So basically you are telling me that if you go up against a hacker on pc then you just have to be better then them? I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs not about skill it‚Äôs about precision. A mouse and keyboard will win against a controller 99% of the time. When you were in those tournaments they didn‚Äôt allow mouse and keyboard. If they had everybody would be forced to use it otherwise they‚Äôd basically lose. If it‚Äôs considered cheating by Ubisoft themselves then it shouldn‚Äôt belong in the game, period. Ubisoft have tried several times to get rid of this issue but it‚Äôs one big cat and mouse game because if they patch them out then a few hours later the people that make the adapters will patch them again so they can be continued to be used. Sony and Microsoft are the ones that need to do something about this because it is their console and they have to the power to ultimately get rid of this issue and they haven‚Äôt.
---
Yah but not for the good gun. She has one for that other gun but not actually good gun lol
---
Yessss! Please!!
---
Sorry to be that guy but I belive you got vertically and horizontally switched arround
---
We already have a church of Tachanka.
---
https://discord.gg/WsZGJq3
---
Also, bet we have more collective hours on Tachanka than y'all.
---
damn u got an source on this id like to see the heights
---
I have an archived stream against a hacker I barely lost that game 5-4 so ... yeah just get better and stop being a whiny little bitch
---
If Ubisoft actually launches an operation named "Fridge" I'll spend all my renown on Tachanka head gear
---
Actually u should just play the game more. Two of my mates still choose to play on Controller over MnK even tough we play on PC. It might be interesting as well that we‚Äôre ranked in high plat. And they perform pretty great with it
---
The R4C is one of the best guns in the game on one of the best operators in the game. It‚Äôs too good. It would still be insanely good with this change due to the lower recoil and fast fire rate. 
---
Ash doesn‚Äôt need a strong weapon, whereas operators like Fuze do. Even then, Fuze is bottom of the barrel for pick rate and has an ok win rate. Ash with a poor weapon would still trump most operators
---
No gun is perfect but it has acog. Just use zofia or somebody else with acog
---
That would be pretty awsome for our boy castle.
---
Youre not asking for good players, youre asking for boosters
---
Are you kidding? In all honesty the gadget is shit compared to others she needs a strong weapon
---
Ash is not nerfed to hell, she‚Äôs the best / 2nd best attacker in the game, her gun requires little to no skill to use 
---
Your an ash main so obviously you‚Äôll be against an ash nerf
---
r/ActLikeYouBelong
---
Save for new op
---
What he say?
---
Idk
---
But your already bulletproof in the front, you don‚Äôt also have to be shock proof: Also shields really don‚Äôt need any buffs at the moment.

I've been guilty of this at least once in casual CSGO

Please explain? Let‚Äôs have a conversation üëç

Did they change the type 89 firing noise? It seems different this season
---
I'd say Favela is worse, but yeah Tower isn't fun

The only time I enjoy it is throwing a Valk cam into the elevator shaft

Pro league? Where I stated I used to play in Pro League? National league is some decent but not really serious torunament with small prizes and other leagues like Faceit are filled with cheaters hunting for prizes and wannabe 16yo proplayers
---
Lol that nerf changed nothing. I spawn peek with doc now.  I just swap to my pistol and relocate pretty quickly. 
---
To me acogs are better at any range. Even up close because the target is bigger so I can react quicker. I can also track better with it. If someone is strafing or spamming crouch I can hit them better. Not to mention I‚Äôm far more comfortable with the arrow of an acog than the triangle of a reflex. It‚Äôs personal preference but in the end to the average person, acog is better
---
just play ranked lmao. But in seriousness, its shit, fucking horrible.
---
Hibana didn't get down by the frost mat though
---
Just had a game like this and lost
---
Perfect
---
I've never noticed a cap. It usually fires as soon as I pull the trigger and I have a faster than average trigger finger.
---
I‚Äôd legit still argue if anything this was a buff more than a nerf the only way I see this as a nerf would be in terms of the duration, lion still accomplishes the same thing he used to which is isolating roamers and cheesing them. Plus now he got back a use so he‚Äôs back at 3 which is great in my eyes.
---
Bro... that actually hurt a little
---
Don't worry I lost too
---
Lol I was just wondering if it was a controller or some guy messing with a trackpad or those nubs in the middle of keyboards
---
So... exactly what did the message say? Lmao
---
Put it in google translate
---
I feel attacked.
---
It was never a very noticeable cap, it just kept people from firing it at the same rate of an automatic either through spazzing out on the mouse or using a macro. It was quite the plague back in the day. I'll check it out next time I play.
---
"Sit still ffs!"
---
hes asserting dominance
---
I put it and compare it, for me, it sounded alike.
---
"Why you kill me"
---
Did you watch the killcam?
---
"Yes"
---
Running between buck and a barricade is dumb
---
"No youre"
---
It's Thermite's Halloween uniform.
---
HOLY MOTHER OF RIGHTEOUS FUCK
---
Fair enough. I don't play Buck on PC so if that's the only place the cap was then I wouldn't notice.
---
Sensational.
---
Who thinks he‚Äôs useless?
---
wait, isn‚Äôt just obvious they were in a party but playing on opposing teams?
