It does mean something, what are you complaining for?
---
---
---
Smoke mains unite!
---
I look more similar to him when I don't have a mustache than when I do, funny enough.
---
They are already useless operators in the game. 
---
Honestly operation outbreak was fun at first, but got boring as the season went on.
---
YOU WHAT?!
---
I can think of two reasons that make it painful. A solo queue team being matched against 5 stacks. Getting put on the same team with people that you’ve previously muted, blocked, and reported.  
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Well as you can see on the gif, i got killed after the bar was full and gone, and Hibana wasn't dead
---
Honestly I didn’t care for it. It was different, which was super cool that they stepped out of the comfort zone of the regular play style. I feel like it got played cause it was limited and people just wanted to experience it before it was gone forever. I don’t understand why they’d work hard on something then make it gone forever. That’s so silly to me. “I worked hard on this. Let me delete it now” at least let it be recurring or something. Props to them for doing it, my friends loved it, it’s a shame that they didn’t let it stay/don’t play on having it come back. 
---
Hell ya
---
I have been using for about a month and saw it in a previous Reddit post. I doubt it will get patches soon.
---
Thx mate =) Glad you liked it.
---
But think of it, twitch, useless, castle, useless, maverick, useless, kaid, useless, I’m not gonna sit here and name all the useless ops but there will be too many
---
FUCK YES OUTBREAK WAS EPIC
---
Outbreak 2 but it's actually just Team Rainbow Dealing with Resident Evil 2's plot (plz ubi)
---
her DMR is good if you know how to use it too. if you use the BOSG, there are several variables/odds that don't lean in your favor.
---
I agree we need more events, like this, Halloween, and S.I., but maybe not "outbreak" specifically
---
Beautiful
---
I'd like something similar to outbreak, maybe terrorists using enhanced weapons, security measures, exo suits, so that our OPs can use their gadgets...... Something non alien/zombie. 
---
When are these operators being released, or are they already?  Also, really nice drawing!!
---
me to :p (was the guy screaming in the clip) 
---
I think they should but they should do some drastic changes with it as well. Like add in a straight survival gamemode. 
---
Basically this.
---
Reson I take some time to load is I have to stream the game to a different PC to use a mouse because my PC has only one USB port which my hard drive is using and I can't play on the other PC because it is missing api-ms-win-crt-runtime and I can't find a fix
---
But blitz is scary :(
---
Same in the UK, but I had a brainfart and couldn't remember the proper name.
---
The easiest solution is to introduce a warm up mode like csgo, when the individual doesn't connect, the match should be canceled.
---
Did your brain undergo reassignment surgery too?
---
Would be good for sure
---
You think the Germans really use car batteries?
---
This stopped counting shots fired about a year ago I think. My accuracy has improved dramatically since then. 
---
Maverick create peak holes castle contain an enemy or clear out a bomb sight and castle it up twitch similar as echo but instead of becoming drunk you get zapped you would just have to come up with new strategies 
---
Is that Apex I see?
---
He literally has the best gun on the defensive side IMO &amp; he block most projectiles.. They don’t want him to be OP 
---
IMO Outbreak was fun.
---
That hand be lookin like slender man
---
What 
---
Yes, but it never takes more than ten minutes if you actually measure your loading time.
---

---
Ten minutes + is intentional and is undeniably an exploit.
---
To be fair your argument isn't scientifically proven either.
---
Personally, I'd like an event where people can work together against AI like outbreak. Terrorist hunt is decent but the AI for the white masks can see you through walls. I'd favor something more like outbreak that has people work together against AI and gives personality and some story to the operators.
---
I think they've done a great job on representing countries special forces so far, especially BOPE, but seeing the Australian operators is kind of a letdown to be quite honest
---
F
---
Yea my hand is weird 
---
I loved the idea of outbreak but it did get a little repetitive. If it was a bit more dynamic ala left 4 dead I don't think I would have stopped playing it. 
---
I prefer the spear anyways. It's easy to control with an acog.
---
Knock em down*
---
Definitely 
---
Idk what this is, but I wish I had been there to play it
---
why can everyone on here draw but me :'( great job tho!
---
“but you can’t just i’m R6 O.o”
---
Yes, that is a macro. 
---
Lmfao why just why 
---
they are implementing a system like CS. where if you played with jacjer that match wont count so you dont gain or lose elo. now im afraid that hacker will keep hacking so that we cant gain elo and advance into ranked
---
a)  If you solo queue going up against a 5 stack is to be expected, make friends and play with them.  b)  How often and why do you have to mute / report (and why)  for context I'm a diamond player from Australia on PC
---
Yes I genuinely did and I forgot to screenshot.
---
Now this is content 
---
To the downvotes!!
---
That why we shouldn't take drugs.
---
Just a visual bug it seems, wouldn't let me on earlier today. 
---
Yeah, totally forgot about that, didn't meant to troll you, sorry for that guys

You’re not allow to do that on this sub

*silently laughing*

Wow
---
u/timothy_dallaway
---
Idk why they would take it out in the first place
---
u/mecycle69
---
yes
---
Either leave or deal with it and don't be so fragile. Try not to solo queue either
---
Just leave if it’s affecting you that much 
---
His Elite skin better be a plague doctor 
---
Their leaked gadgets kind of give it away
---
There’s a whole lotta dumb stuff in this comment hold on.
---
&gt; Different games, different community you can’t compare
---
If anything csgo has a more toxic community, but it still works.
---
&gt; there’s a reason why Ubisoft hasn’t added it yet, they know it won’t work.
---
You can’t honestly think that you’re correct in saying this right? You’re joking, right?
---
So you’re saying that Ubisoft can’t implement any more features into the game because if it helped the game then it would already be in it? What about the forgive option when someone accidentally TKs? What about the auto bans they did recently? that wasn’t in the game when it first came out, but they thought it was good enough for it to be implemented. 
---
You can’t just speak off of Ubi’s behalf like you fuckin know them. I’m not even gunna respond to you after this comment because you said some dumb shit that doesn’t make any sense.
---
&gt; You sound like the guy who says “Australia has a ban on guns and it works why not do it in America” 
---
You’re really going to compare real life gun laws with in real life countries where real lives are effected by it, to a video game putting in the name of the person who starts the vote?
---
&gt;XD
---
That speaks for itself
---
Yes as long as there's no stupid EXOSUIT stuff.
---
Irish/ Native American here.  I can resonate with that.  Judging by the jokes, I'm supposed to love drinking and smoke signals.  You make a drunk smoke signal message ONE TIME, and suddenly that's who you are.
---
Yup
---
I hope they bring back Outbreak with all the stuff they had before, but with more content. A bunch of new monsters, a new story, etc. I fucking loved the cutscenes and character building. 
---
no
---
Wouldn't mind a crazy event with unlimited abilities and attackers and defenders on both sides. Just all out mayhem. 
---
Yea cuz I didn’t get the chance to play it, and it is fun with friends 
---
Blitz has been banned from every match I've played in the pro league playlist. If that isn't a hint that Ubisoft has a lot of work to do on Blitz, then I don't know what...
---
Holy shit that’s nice
---
No
---
At least "Year 2" and "Year 3" are alright...
---
.
---
oH shit

His ability is a melee range of 3 meters and he cannot be killed with melee.

Whenever an enemy is killed by this ability, their last words are:

"...now that's...a knife..."
---
Underrated comment 
---
I play on ps4 and sometimes when playing a game people will start team killing and I don’t know who to trust at all also for some reason people are understanding most of the time if I accidentally shoot or kill them no clue why
---
I've never been out of gold lol nevermind pro league stuff but nice to know, thanks!

---
OwO....oh did I say it wrong?
---
Slap an ACOG on there because only 1 speeds get ACOGS 
---
No; not because it was "bad" or "unwelcome", but because I just don't think it's a very good use of the team's development resources. Even if they were to choose to do singleplayer/cooperative content, the theming of the mode barely fit the strengths of the game's existing gameplay at all, so while it was "fun-ish" to play, people were only going to derive continued enjoyment from it if they kept making new maps - which is definitely not a sustainable model.
---
If they do want to have special events like that, they could try to focus on thinking about odd game modes to reuse the many operator abilities, or even provide the community with more intricate ways to change a Custom Game - so that people can come up with their own interesting ruleset.
---
So use it like the smg 12 but also like an lmg
---
I honestly don't understand their lack of communication with this issue. Did something change and I need to get a new GPU to play this game? I mean at least tell us something instead of leaving us in the dark to fend for ourselves and be unable to play the game.
---
heck u ubi

I wish they'd bring it back. It was way superior to thunt

Aussie here, tbh it’s kinda funny that people assume australia is a wasteland and that we are all shotgun holding farmers. Still exited for my home to be represented in my favourite game!

\*I said "do you speak my laguage?"\*

When did they fix it?

Why is it so hard for people to understand that you can have 2 mains?  Like, Jesus Christ, use your brain.

Why so salty 
---
Why would they take it out anyways? Its like l4d2 with good competetive gunplay
---
Not from a Blitz Main 
---
No not at all. I dont really like games where you're going against AI too much
---
Its casual ain't nobody got 4 mins to wait
---
Play pulse. Pulse is super fun because he’s a 3 speed with a nitro cell and a unique ability that takes some time to master but it is satisfying to get kills using it
---
I didn’t know this was possible
---
Seriously, all that buildup for what was it, 2 weeks? And then they took it away
---
Just PM me
---
I mean r6 is a ctu group right? So can we get more story driven events of them doing other ctu things besides drills.
---
Probably bald transgender women. Every game needs one now
---
They already... Kinda did.. Didnt they? Or was that mute? 
---
1000 round terror hunt might be doable... I'll think about it
---
Finds Jäger and Bandit’s acog

---
Oh we have Clash already nvm
---
I see you close your eyes during the female weightlifting competition of the olympics.
---
Yes, that'd be awesome
---
Didnt know there was an OP my bad was just playing and saw it
---
Outbreak was the best thing to happen to siege, I don't enjoy playing the same 3 game modes for 4 years
---
I liked Outbreak and would enjoy a sequel.
---
That being said I think it would be cool if they did a yearly PvE story season. Could be different things or maybe have an overarching story.
---
On what?
---
Ubi pls make the elite skin Owen Wilson ,
---
GIGN Shotgun and Revolver until I die
---
Ps4
---
Yeah, Australia is really not a Mad Max sort of thing, we got cities and stuff. There's desert but that's more in the middle sort of thing,you hang around the coast and you got the cities like Sydney.
---
Ok want to play
---
You have just, singlehandedly, given Ubisoft the best reason to not show his face
---
It was the same for PlayStation for me. Mikes were also lagging. 
---
[Insert joke with grid in it]
---
Everyone’s playing road to SI
---
I think they should have a go at a full on single player campaign. they have the ability and from what I could tell from outbreak they have the chops to make an awesome story. 
---
I'd rather not tbh. It wasn't that fun aside from it being different. But I'd rather them divert all resources into continuing the improvement of the core game. The reason we keep coming back. 
---
They both look like cunts. A+ Siege. 
---
Going off of my personal experience yes. I can’t say for sure that’s how it works, but my friend group report each other all the time without getting banned 
---
I loved outbreak I need a 2nd one
---
Dude, stop bitching. Ubisoft has a small R6 development unit. Do you know how hard programming is? You have possibly one line of code out of trillions that affects another which affects another that could cause your problem. Be patient, and understand how hard their job is. 
---
How about 4 kills and a team kill
---
Yea bro my tag is CrazZzy4Star13

I have made a few but I'm not proud of them except for one [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2B22G3DCLM&amp;ab\_channel=Donnietentoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2B22G3DCLM&amp;ab_channel=Donnietentoes)
---
It was like the second time I ever made a After Effects edit so its kinda all over the place. (I didn't even know how to work twixtor and stuff yet now I do.) But editing it was really fun. Like you said my biggest problem was getting clips that I want to use and music that can go with the clip. Like making a glaz edit is way easier for me than a frost one because the glaz's sniper can go really well with beats. Just me though loved your edit and makes me wanna pick up an old project again.
---
Basically the Protect Hostage mode in Terrorist Hunt.
---
I started playing right after it ended, so I would love to try it.
---
Hey wassup dude, doing good?
---
Came out Feb 20 for about 4 weeks
---
mine is at 29 when actually playing but picking ops is at 59, makes no sense
---
They had this during Operation Chimera. You and up to four others had to barricade a house and fight off hordes of zombies with limited supplies. It was pretty fun. I think they need more operations like that. 
---
Except you’re not protecting a hostage lmao but I get your point. 
---
So close
---
Where are your PLATES???
---
You cunts better leave us Aussies alone, or there'll be some real fuckin' trouble down under.
---
also we aren't upside down, you are.

Free weekend
---
wtf??
---
yes??

what is that?

For some reason everything was way off and laggy. Even the party features. 
---

---
Git gud
---
Um, there’s websites for this
---
r/R6STeams
---
I remember, it was fun.
---
exactly. idk man they need to fix it
---
You absolute monster 
---
Outbreak would be nice but I feel the White Masks need something you know. It's sort of why we're gaining CTU operators from all over the world.
---
Terrorist can be fun with stuff like Bomb on realistic. Why not mix Outbreak with Terrorist Hunt? Defuse bombs, take down Terrorists, rescue hostages...you know things our operators are good at.
---
Why not recreate some of these Operations mentioned in the Bios? Why not make the White Masks do something bold that requires Rainbow to step in, something like Article 5 all over again.
---
As a fellow Australian and Brisbane train traveller and high school party attendee, I agree with this.
---
What
---
they have the tts it's nice for new content and new season balancing but if they get bug fixes just have the fix deployed sooner I don't want to have to wait until next season for a bug that already has a patch
---
Google it
---
Ok thanks
---
Np

Bringing sweater vests when i got to play

Lmaooooo ur such a douchebag its awesome

How about operation fuze the hostages you can pick the hostages and move them around and your goal is to kill the hostages and the wining team is the one who has the most hostages left

Operation Emu Cleansing

Outbreak should’ve been defending a place with boarded up windows and shit instead of having a mission. 
---
OwO
---
Sorry... but what you said was kind of mean less 😐 since what you mean is called cheating (not hacking) and the second thing is that I don’t mean cheating instead I mean m/k players play with players that also play with m/k. Does that make sense 🤨
---
the announcer has a really stereotypically gay/valley girl voice and every time you step in a gu or something its OMG I CANT EVEN RIGHT NOW
---
It's a popular game mode so I'd say lots of people care. I'm a cas man so this kind of stuff is annoying and rampant throughout the game and should be addressed. 
---
I’ve got more than you 😛
---
Get xD’ed kid.
---
I'm purchasing with steam currency through R6
---
This makes me so happy because my buddies and I frequently communicate through Owen Wilson style "wow"s when we're playing. 
---
Bandit wanted his ACOG back sobadly, he went thicc boi just so that he's qualified to have an ACOG again.
---
You can definitely still plant there. I planted the round before no problem
---
I think he was mocking the people that day this.
---
VV()VV
---
If he is then I rescind my comment, hard to tell. 
---
No cause on console we get to experience 100 plus frames, then have to go back to 59 in ranked lol
---
On what platform?
---
2?
---
You're a fan of outbreak? dude that game sucks-\_\_- you guys really confuse me as to why you liek these western game so much. I mean the protagonsists are ugly they make these characters overly macho with their wesetrnize faces and ugly facial hairs. I  just dont get it -\_\_- sorry thats my opinion dude. Dead or Alive 6 is a much more sucessful game. Dead or Alive 6 will be selling billions of copies on March first XD XD Shimbori from Team Ninja has the most skills and hes not afraid of you western gamers at all. I can;t wait for Dead or Alive 6 to be the most GOTY this year.

Why dont they just make outbreak missions free to play?

Yeah downvote my comment you fucking retard. You know I’m right smh

Huh, didn't know that was a thing, thank you.

You can buy skins and with those or something save them for something that cant be earned

Damn... I goofed

It's standard in ranked, not casual. Ranked you can still pick spawn or site, just not the pick/ban
---
Okay I've noted it down thanks 
---
Thanks for the info
---
Thank you to everyone who has commented 
---
New psn cover image ayyee 
---
Like huh?
---
I would love a new PVE event, because Outbreak was fairly well done.
---
However, I don't want the operators to be designed around the PVE event in a PVP game.
---
Lion and Finka are still two of the most dumbfuckingly designed operators. No setup, no preparation. Press a button, receive reward.
---
Upload that shit on pornhub

OWO OWO OWO

Using the samsung smart frige to open R6S amd then looking at R6S subreddits should be the new meta.
---
But on the far right of all the ops there's "Operator Stat" 
---
Totally would get if in black
---
Sadly, it didn't.
---
It had 0 replayability, and for all the resources they pooled into it, it had 0 replayability, no competitive flavour (since this game is built on a competitive PvP format) and lack of content (just 3 maps gets very stale very quickly).
---
And:
---
1- their focus is making the PvP, the core of the game, much better, and PvE just diverts resources unnecessarily from that.
---
2- takes a lot of time and maintenance, which, like I said, could be used to sort out PvP issues, which right now, are extreme.

I have a feeling you are rigth

A little bit of both. When they tightened their toxicity rules, things seemed to calm down some. But once people figured out how to sidestep those, it's started to increase again.

That’s a shame, this game doesn’t take too many devs to keep running. I feel like they could easily add the feature and everyone would be happy
---
I personally like my dirty white converse.
---
Ahucktually, that would be full opacity red
---
How tf you teabag that fast? KB&amp;M much?

There's a meme/gif of the scene from Castaway where THanks loses his volleyball. Someone superimposed Owen Wilson's head onto the ball and he just keeps saying wow into the horizon. Someone link me that gif plz!!! THanks thanks you. 
---
Also I do too.

happy cake day

Is this how thicc Ela finally gets on the home page? 
---
Holy fuck, yes. 
---
Imagine this. The white masks have taken hostages in an massive building filled with tight corridors, open atriums, dark maintinence tunnels, and many many floors. Hostages are being rigged with explosives, and being used as human shields throughout multiple points in the building. Find a way into the building, breach their defense, eliminate the threat and rescue hostages with minimal casualties.
---
Rescue hostages while avoiding classic traps and obstacles such as barbed wire, reinforcements, and nitro cells, but also newer traps such as tripwires, pressure plates, proximity alarms, cameras, and search lights. 
---
**Enemy types**
---
Basic white mask
---
Shield white mask
---
Heavy (Think bomber, but doesnt run at you to explode)
---
Roaming armed drone- drone controlled by another enemy in the building, if it spots you it will sound an alarm and start shooting. Heavily armored, but with prominent weak points that can disrupt its function when shot at or damaged.
---
Hostage holder- An enemy using a hostage as a human shield armed with a pistol. Can be shot from the back, or in the head. Shooting the hostage or using explosives will incur a penalty. 
---
Tech specialist: finding and eliminating him will allow the operators to view the roaming armed drones through observation tools, or disable and enable them at will.
---
Detonator: If he spots you he will detonate the explosives that are wired to the hostages.
---
**Operator List**
---
Caveira: Can interrogate enemies that she downs and find out locations of some but not all,  hostages, traps, and enemies.
---
Doc: Supports teammates by healing them and quickly reviving hostages. 
---
Dokkaebi: hacks all cameras when picking up the phones of neutralized tech specialists.
---
Echo: Yokai drones are quiet, and undetectable while invisible. Useful for gathering information, and the sonic bust will cause enemies to briefly drop hostages and prevent them from detonating explosives for a short period
---
IQ: Can see traps and electronic devices through walls. Can be used to disable explosives, cameras, and locate roaming drones
---
Jackal: Tracks enemy positions, eyeknox is also capable of seeing and identifying hostage foot prints. 
---
Maverick: The only stealth breacher, can quietly make holes in walls for new sightlines and entry points. 
---
Pulse: Can spot and ping enemies and hostages through walls. 
---
Thatcher: EMP grenades disable cameras, drones, explosives and all electronic traps for  15 seconds. 
---
Recruit: No special abilities, just smoke grenades and flashbangs
---
Blackbeard and Fuze run the operation like thermite did in outbreak. 
---
Maybe but outbreak kind of ruined a bit of my emersion in the game
---
no one ever clicks on youtube links, pretty sure they’re not allowed anyway. 
---
You call that a knife THIS is a KNIFE

Am I the only one who sees a second face?
---
Which is why they should DRAMATICALLY improve TH.
---
Because TH is anyway a practice mode, but it is a basically aim bot and crouch spamming terrorists and Blackbeard bombers. TH should be a mode that as some sort of a story about white masks and should conclude with white makes being taken down and rainbow existing to eliminate any stray white mask groups. That way, it's kill all, with a purpose, with a story, with minimal maintenance and interference with the core. If one wanted, he could just play the last mode in whatever difficulty he wanted and that's practice enough.
---
*yes*
---
As an Aussie I respectfully give this man to the Russians
---
Ubisoft devs for siege are in canada
---
Read this in the "New U" voice from Borderlands 2.
---
ABSOLUTALY
---
I would love to replace Outbreak operation with any operation that adds Training mode. 
---
wow
---
If they ever did a face reveal I'm hoping for Deadpool-level-of-chemical-burn face.
---
Oof 
---
I'd be down honestly. Either some sort of continuation of Outbreak or something with the White masks would be cool. I felt like that event had a lot of potential that they didn't really tap into for the game. It was like the whole event was a sideshow to the event pack experiment.
---
PC
---
The whole operation doesn't exist
---
I’d like for something to replace T-Hunt with AI similar to the outbreak enemies. It made for better practice/warmup than the lame white masks who don’t move very much 
---
Ever play medal of Honor - Airborne? Shit gave me nightmares as a kid.

You could use something like bluestacks and copy the sounds over after saving from the app.

Everyone they should hire this guy! ^
---
I don't even understand what happened.
---
French Canadians 
---
Gotchya. Maybe... A lean/crouch/shot-at supression mechanic would be awesome
---
Smurfs are the true team killers.
---
Illuminati confirmed.
---
I'm ok with this 
---
First tell them loud and clear, then shoot near them. If they are still placing the reinforcement just kill them. Mira dictates the defense setup. They will learn or stay Copper 4 for the rest of their career. 
---
 
---
Yeah that's what I was saying, she's overrated and her popularity is really just down to how easy she is to use
---
Yep! Mostly, you’ll have your ops but they won’t have their attachments set up, you’ll have your renown too
---
Thank you.
---
Yea really just some toxic idiot 
---
Funny when things say “biggest X in Southern Hemisphere” like yea sure bud, just say biggest in Australia. 
---
Add that to crouch spamming and you've got yourself a recipe for fun and toxicity
---
Skins are personal preference, after all.
---
Wow those guys were bad 
---
I'd actually love that headgear, not if it is duplicate, though.
---
BUT BUT MY BIRCHWOOD?
---
Ehhh. I’d say the opposite. It’s not as common but the toxicity is multiplied.
---
I'm not Australian myself but if the characters and map/event are anything like the bad stereotypes /junkrat bs I'll be mad or at least disappointed
---
That being said most if not all nations added into the game got a fair representation with little to no stereotypes so it might just be an artwork aesthetic 
---
It was 2 days ago
---
Cause Ubisoft is restarted also. 
---
Ib4 this thread is banned due to toxic behavior 
---
But outbreak was on console too..
---
Remember, it‘s Outbreak who brought us Lion and Finka.
---
Who cares about our opinion if they said there will be no more PVE events ever. 
---
I don't even have the game and this is pissing me off
---
That AMD GPU program is a hit or miss. Sometimes an update will make a previously low fps game run like butter, or it will stop people from opening a game entirely. (Examples being, DOOM 2016 running perfectly with Vulcan, and CSGO that just didn't want to stay open at all for about 2 weeks until a patch was made.)
---

What about a Luxemburgish Op that melees with a 500 Euro Bill like in Payday 2. 
---
They also review you for saying "negative". At least it's not an instaban now, but I don't trust for one second that it's only real people doing those reviews.
---
I litterally did this about 30 mins ago and it was amazing
---
I'd say we don't need more british nor american troops right now, we need more diversity
---
UwU
---
they should remove the “Return To Menu” button from ranked matches, since you don’t need to be leaving them in the first place. I find it bullshit that you can leave and come right back to so fast JUST to avoid the interrogation and death.
---
Yeah, even a 10 minute short movie would be really cool. 
---
Sexy
---
It does though, had it popped up **before** he started placing the charge it wouldn’t have mattered. Imagine typing something on a keyboard and while you are typing it disconnects momentarily and then reconnects. Some of what you typed will be missing, which is what happened in the clip.

Read [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/7epvl6/for_the_people_that_dont_know_which_icon_means/) for more info. 
---
**Packet loss**
---
Packet loss occurs when one or more packets of data travelling across a computer network fail to reach their destination. Packet loss is either caused by errors in data transmission, typically across wireless networks, or network congestion. Packet loss is measured as a percentage of packets lost with respect to packets sent.
---
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) detects packet loss and performs retransmissions to ensure reliable messaging.

I think it says Road To SI
---
Nah man u good. Theyre fairly recent
---
Ēpic
---
I'm angry over your flaire...
---
New operators:
---
- Lion (map-wide movement sensor)
---
- Finka (team-wide boost)
---
- Maestro (bulletproof laser camera)
---
- Alibi (holograms)
---
- Clash (taser riot shield)
---
- Maverick (exothermic blowtorch)
---
- Kaid (tossable electroclaw)
---
- Nomad (pushback traps)
---
Another news:
---
- Tachanka is still crap
---
- Zofia has less grenades
---
- Ela is no longer a monster
---
That's so stupid that it would work on me.
---
Does it snap your wrist every time you pull the trigger?
---
Only if the art gets filtered by the team, or else we're gonna see thicc anime Ela/IQ every day. 
---
Then they need to get on bucks grenades
---
Actually this is quite realistic (sorry for being a smart arse) because sometimes Special Ops get called in to terrorist situations while they are off duty and in casual clothes
---
Great smile
---
I can confirm.

wow? WOW!

That tk though. Lmao

Think about it: A BIG free to venture map ( Not like outbreak )  and some realistick zombies with better storytelling. Not saying outbreak was bad but a bigger map like 2 bank maps and a house map combined big. 
---
With better comunication system like emotes.

---
No problems, always happy to help
---
I mean, I can see that being the case, since some GSG9 ops are wearing jeans and such, but mozzie and gridlock have full uniforms, but for some reason gridlock still has to have aviators and a motorcycle helmet. It just seems a bit excessive compared to the other ops

nO mEmEs!!!! Reeeee

Ok but you missed my point mate. My point is that they are tired and boring stereotypes. No one looks at Germany and thinks that they are all autistic pilots. What I’m saying is that in a game based on counter terrorism it’s inappropriate to use the MAD MAX FUCKING YEAH CUNT outback setting to represent Australia and Australians. I’m not mad but what I’m saying is I’m disappointed that Ubisoft has done what everyone else does when representing Australia, Mad Max/Cockney voice actors. BUT it’s not released yet so I’m not going to judge it yet. It’s a bit of a stretch but imagine if every German in every piece of media you consumed was a Nazi for Aussie the comparison is bogans they’re different but my point is when you wait so long for guys that are meant to be authentic and get given BOGANS AND BIKEYS you feel betrayed. It’s dumb and I hate when SJW’s do this but we get almost no authentic Aussie representation. But I can admit that they do look cool gadgets sound like duds though.

to be fair, GSG9 don't actually wear jeans and sport shoes irl, they have time to prepare. It's a common misconception, but the police that responds in  casual clothing is the SEK 
---
DLC is available for everyone.
---
Je suis le roi du monde wooooohh
---
I haven't felt any changes to the weapon. You're probably just getting better at recoil control in general 
---
Other question: Why is there plat 3's in our team carrying silver? 
---
What's wrong with them?
---
Screams in mic "Breack and clear on zulu!" ....... "ZULU!!!"
---
Aye!
---
WoW
---
In the reveal they said mozzie as in "she," and said gridlock with a "he"
---
No he doesn't deserve an F he deserves getting tk'd for using a macro that makes the game unrealistic 
---
Well we have r/ar15 for that 
---
をを
---
Is this 2008 or something 
---
and yet in your team there's plat mixing with silver from the same clan to play against golds for easy elo.. so.. hmm, karma.
---
Because the only special forces ever to be Northern Irish acted like terrorists towards their own.
---
Like if you look up Northern Irish special forces it literally just says British and how they killed civilians.
---
Can't have terrorist operators now can we.
---
We need a shotgun made out of paper now
---
I played solo 
---
The game is bad comprised and has a bad code when u want it small. Iam sure it is because they never made such a game but now it is huge. Litteraly gta and every bf aren't that big but have way bigger maps and look better.

I've heard before that year 1 sale ends with the start of year 4 (no source, sorry). So unless we don't get a sale after that, year 2 is highly likely.

---
Not too bad. Excited about the Six Invitational! You?
---
Thanks for the new screensaver 
---
I was already thinking of a range of about 3-4 meters. Maybe she would have to stop and brace herself before it detonated giving the opposition time to get out of the blast radius. It would only do 40 damage if you were right next to it the damage would drop off quickly with distance.
---
Can you link the video?

Oh wow a 3D model of elas gun- dam its really flat
---
There are nice things around.
---
No problem, and I do like her having to brace her self.
---
I had a match where it was 30 seconds in and there was a major “lag spike” so my friend checked the scoreboard and there was only one person with low ping. And then we all got kicked. My guess is ddos for me but I’m not sure for you. 
---
The DBNO part could be taken out if it was found to be too OP after testing. It would deter team killing trolls though, lol.
---
Could they make a lot of money if they sold replicas of operators special abilities because I would buy it
---
Jackal and buck

Watch out, we have a badass over here.

I suppose. Irish Operators would probably have to come first though.

Sure thing I am. I mostly watch only the finals, since those are matches of best versus the best and usually are most thrilling and interesting. The reveal panel is also a great attraction. 
---
Have to say I’m quite terrified by the new watch-time checkpoints for charms but hey, not like I don’t forget about their existence 15 minutes into the stream. 
---
And Epi, since the post is deleted and nobody will ever see our conversation... what are the responsibilities for Community Developer and how does it differ from Community Moderator like Zoro or Noty?
---
Maverick, Twitch, Hibana, Thatcher, Smoke and Mute are really good bans.
---
I can agree with Blitz and the current Lion being op and to some extent Dokkaebi, but the others aren't op
---
6 months? Don't you mean the last 2 years?
---
The sound has been broken for ages now, with some things just simply not making noise when they're meant to, or sounds coming from completely the wrong places due to bad sound propagation on certain maps.

That’s bullshit, I will play what I want

It's just kinda hard, I cant kill anyone that is long range because if my sens is high I have hard time Adjusting, but if its too low in close range I cant kill anyone
---
Finally another Scotsman who can play baseball
---
Lower is better

The DLCs are all free and included, that's why the file is so large

There was a post a while back saying the discord is toxic af so I’d say avoid that tbh.

---
Thanks - I'll check it out
---
Recommendations? I seem to float around 50/60
---
Yea. Especially sucks for me since I’m a caveira main. 
---
The way I look at it is that she is a 3 speed. Her gadget should be weaker than other similar gadgets for operators who aren’t as quick. Speed is so good in this game, and she has this. The downside is a gadget that isn’t amazing, but still useful. 
---
Her weapons are also viable and usable, eventhough they aren’t the best overall. Removing her frags did nerf her a little, but a 3 speed with frags and a mediocre gadget just means players will use her as Ash. Just picked for the fragging power. 
---
The only buffs I’d give her is a reworked interface for her scanner, such as a darker screen, whereby the gadget is highlighted better and easier to see. Make pulsing effect around a scanned gadget much more minimal, and darker, and keep the distance indicator small and in the top corner of the gadget, not on top of its outline. Overall this change would make her gadget more clear and therefore more effective overall. 
---
Maybe increasing the range as well, but only by 2 or 3 meters. Not sure on this one though.  
---
Fingers crossed.
---
Buuuum bum buuuuum
---
Well, that's because Blitz, lion, echo, and cav are pretty powerful ops when in the right hands that's what the pick and ban is supposed to do, ban people your team finds hard to play against.

Hahahhahaa just saw the edit

I see nothing wrong here.

But then people who main those ops will lose interest to play the game(

Thanks for your input.
---
The Famas is has the highest DPS in the game. And it's recoil is only vertical, so if you're decent at the game you can essentially make it a 1000rpm laser. The Famas is widely regarded as the best gun in the game and the AK isn't even close.
---
Impressive, wish I had that kind of skill.
---
It’s almost as if your supposed to use them as a way of gathering intel. Also if you don’t capitalise on the fact there is a downed enemy and possible teammates reviving him then that’s on you
---
Sounds like you shouldn't run your mouth without any way to back up your shit
---
Just made sure as some of these looked like mouse flicks I see on pc. Good stuff dude!
---
No I do have other people to play with but they haven’t played Siege in a while like a couple of months.

Damn, that’s an F

---
I mean, all maps could use a spawnpeek rework (i.e. more obstacles outside), but I don't find theme park any cheesier than any other map. In ranked, you can Completely dodge a spawnpeek if you're picking your spawn and checking your entrance like you should. 
---
I think there is one more?
---
Happens in real life
---
I've never been so enthusiastic about a season than I ever have. From what I've seen the new operator's will suck or just be unoriginal and it's kind of disappointing. And hell they can't even make Australia look like it fucking Mad Max which seems to be what every game dev does these days and yes that's a exaggeration. All I know I'm not getting my pre order money out back out of season 4.
---
Was good but have you ever got all 5?😏
---
I put triple buffering but i cant do the priority &gt; low thing, it doesnt let me for some reason
---
Edit; i havent i was one of those 5😶
---
I’m sorry can you tell me what your trying to say in two sentences? 
---
Mine too man. My account is purely for arguments.
---
I play on PC. I literally don't have a reason to care for this argument. The only time I play Xbox is to play Forza.
---
XIMs are actually against TOS though, dunno about PS4 but they're definitely against Xbox TOS and against Ubis own TOS. So ya know, no matter what you had to say I could always just slap you with Ubis TOS and call you a cheater regardless.
---
But Sony have legit lost their mind if they're allowing that shit, that's way too much of an advantage to just haphazardly be handing out to people.
---
Care to give a little bit more reasoning rather than just repeating the tag line of the leaks we’ve known for months? 
---
Wow m8, let's git us some Macca's.

Thank you Sherlock. Did you read the chat?
---
How tf do you have 4 R6 Credits?
---
That’s the tldr.
---
But basically in gold and above almost every match is against m&amp;k, and I believe Ubi needs people at least working on a solution. (Wether it be reporting, or detection software, or whatever.)
---
The same person with the C4 done that at old hereford base
---
You don’t buy the pass in r6 credits, and they announce it at the Six Invitational Event this week
---
Brace yourself I'll take you on a trip down Bank back Alley 
---
Get yo self a flair
---
But what should they do about it? Giving the option for everyone to play to their full potential isn't a bad thing. Some people are amazing with controllers and they would be terrible with mouse and keyboard, and vice versa. Yeah using a mouse and keyboard will put you at an advantage vs someone using a controller, but it still takes skill either way. At the end of the day it's simple. Git gud.
---
ah okay thanks

we don't need a trapper we have claymores and on defense, we have mute (the only way the op can be good is if she hacks the drone then she can use it freely ) then she will be useful
---
Imma get some toilet paper cuz im about to cry
---
Wait what? Reporting someone for using a feature in the game? Everyone has the option to use mouse and keyboard what do you mean? Report for what?
---
Y4 will be released sometime after next weekend. So probably late Feb-Early March.
---
Do you mean how much will the operators cost? Or how much the season pass will cost? 
---
The operators are 600 each, and there's 8 of them. So 4800 R6 Credits. 
---
The season pass is like £25 or something like that. And that'll give you all 8 operators + early access to them.
---
Hi, sorry to rain on your parade, but Ubisoft can’t do much about this issue.  They’ve declared it a bannable offense, but they have no way of detecting it.   
---
Fortnite attempted to separate m&amp;k players into their own lobby using software.  24 hours later, the adapter developers had already patched around it and Fortnite’s system was rendered useless.   
---
The people that need to address this is Microsoft and Sony.  They either have to find a way to make this stuff unviable or they make it a baseline feature of next generation console, but make it so it’s detectable.  We’re really screwed if I’m being honest with you.  Ubisoft doesn’t have the time or willpower to sift through thousand of manual reports and risk banning people that didn’t deserve it.   
---
Sorry man, it hurts all of us.
---
Mnk is complete aids on console
---
thanks!
---
they look fine yall just weebs
---
No problem!

It was a joke

Everything is here. Find a match you wanna see, click the little "i" with the circle around it and it gives you how many hours/days till it happens.
---
I’d put Thatcher in the same fatality as Frost.  I don’t think they desperately needed a rework, but Ubisoft has a problem with operators that are “too binary” so they’re slated for a rework.

If you believe that you’re good with m&amp;k. Then you should play on pc. There is no need to bully console players just to get your rank up.

Precisely

Yes my friend it does!

Xbox if it’s any relevant.

In his defense, he was probably using M and K

I see you must work for Ubisoft you will never make us lose track of our objective of opening up the community’s eyes.
---
Except they want to earn the challenges..😐
---
When a doc revives himself he has 75hp. Plus he’s a 3 armor
---
I think one of the most annoying that can possibly happen I believe is when you accidentally teamkill, like breach charge fails, or people walking in front of you and then you apologize to them so that they don’t teamkill you in return next round, but then they teamkill you anyway or get people on the team to do it for them it honestly sucks and can ruin a game 
---
why don’t you wait until they’re on the TTS to complain 
---
Another Ubisoft worker trying to distract us from telling the world!
---
We won't get back to that, just because the low damage will compensate the fire rate and the recoil (that anyway won't be the same as before)

How does this look much different from the Cherry Blossom blood orchid skin?
---
   Once he starts the revive he is on 75 hp so you needed to shoot him 3 times at least for him to die 
---
It isn’t the wrong sub. I’m talking about the characters in relation to Siege.
---
I feel like it's just what people like the most. It's not as exaggerated as overwatch where people will throw the entire game if they don't get who they want. I call myself a buck/smoke main yet I rarely play them 
---
What is the hibana effect?
---
Low recoil + damage buff = Operation Blood Orchid Ela xD
---
I refused to believe it, period.
---
I don't think cav is the type to have a long term relationship/commitment personally.
---
most use credits for elite skins since thats the only way to get it
---
Then why delete?
---
That white thing on your hoodie..hmm
---
 Restart ur app and ur looking at the wrong challenge
---
The recoil won't be the same as before. By the way, you are saying me that all the kills you do are one-taps?😂
---
Yeah I can't do the challenge as haven't got another 4 people :(
---
Okay thanks for the info i will see if ExpressVPN is better! 
---
If they message you asking why you tk’d then just pull out the classic “sorry I thought you were a drone.”

Terrorist hunt is a classic. There’s no way they’re removing it

Thx for posting! Some great work and effort! 
---
Hey man, don’t be mean to my smurf &gt;:(
---
I know most of y'all probably hate Fortnite. I thought combining Siege and Fortnite was a pretty cool idea, so yeah that's why I made this
---
I thought it was !claimcharm
---
I would agree the old ones are awesome it just seems a little weird in this iteration
---
Bro I wouldn’t mind if they made American operators and they had cowboy hats and shit and were stereotypical that would be the best, just learn how to enjoy stuff so what if someone thinks all Australians live in the Outback and ride kangaroos, many people think Texans ride horses everywhere and all live in the desert yet I don’t complain, it’s no big deal like jeez calm down 
---
Favela is a decent map, it's good in the sense of requiring defenders to plan for anything, but it sucks for the same. If they added unbreachable walls here n there itd be a great map
---
Mega rip
---
Yup I have the same issue too. I first picked up the game and ran 12, 18, 18 with 400 DPI. Then I learned how to aim with 1200 DPI with 97. 97, 36. But the problem there was precision accuracy was insanely hard. I found a balance thankfully with 800 DPI and 21, 30, 30. But I’m forced to flick hard if I want to do 180s so I’m adjusting to un-aiming and doing quick turn arounds and ADS during my rotation to look at them
---
Rook is a good choice. Dont really have to worry about your equipment so you can focus more on positioning and roof hatches. Hes got good a good primary and an acog. Since he is so simple you really only have to worry about killing people.
---
Truly epic gamer moment
---
Maybe my description was misleading. His **gadget** is dogshit to where he's basically a 1 speed recruit.
---
Thank u 😄
---
Sorry, I’m an ash main I don’t know any better 
---
I hope you're being sarcastic but an operators gun is a very important part of their kit and allows them to be effective or ineffective in their aggression. 
---
Yeah I’d say rook

We can confirm R6S takes place in the same world as Wildlands

The recoil is ridiculous and it only has 16 bullets. That alone makes it a fairly high skill weapon. I hate it personally so no, I don’t think it’s OP 
---
Road to S.I. rules were pulled from/based on the pro league rule set. If there were kill cams in pro league, that would give a lot of information to whoever dies. They could see where they died from, and normally in kill cams you can see the other operators. Having no kill cam means that all information gained was earned rather than just getting free information from dying.
---
Batter up!
---
you ever played it before it got nerfed?
---
It's Pro League rules... I don't think Pro League has killcams.
---
So there's your answer.
---
That's because pros dont get kill cams. It would be too easy for them to call out their deaths with exact locations. 
---
YES, OH MY GOD YES! 
---
The game mode was so well done and there were cutscenes where you could somewhat see each operators character while you weren’t shooting at someone. Also the animation for the death sequences was extravagant. I sadly didn’t get to play during this event and I was really bummed about it. I’d like to see more stuff like this where there is character building for the operators.
---
90 gives me a fat headache 
---
New meta 
---
Wow, every single one of these is astoundingly awful. Put on your dunce cap and sit in the corner facing the wall until you understand what you’ve done 
---
With doc you don't really have to be ancoring you can still roam a bit and if you mess up you can just heal and head back to obj..
---
Mira is also a viable choise, unique playstyle and can really change how you defend an objective if you had some practice
---
Echo is good for locking down the objective. And his drone is a great tool for stalling enemies so you or your team can take them out
---
Yet his machine gun is the best way to spawn peak
---
Honestly I couldn't tell you the finer points. It's just a heavily disliked map. Likely due to the 4 floors, amount of particle effects (this one especially before it was cleaned up a bit) and lackluster bomb sites. Kitchen/Control is decent enough, but I would say defender sided. Cockpit/Maps as a site is one where anchoring is exceedling difficult due to the four main angles.
---
That's just my speculation, however.
---

Rip old hereford
---
found her mod
---
No that helps, thanks!
---
I NEVER said they are OP. Did I say that? No, I didn't.
---
All 3 are played. And now they'll be played more, all thanks to the Cav and clash buff.
---
Blitz isn't played in PL because of a well established cross fire in almost every corner near objective which takes him out. And the shield turning inconsistency bug that leaves him vulnerable when turning left. Cav was played by g2, is still player but g2 and Joonas got an interrogation with her. Clash is played by LATAM. She'll be played hella lot more now, thanks to her pea shooter becoming a crazy rapid fire gun.
---
\^F

Maybe you have risen in rank and now your enemies seem faster?

Can someone make it look like its raining and the smoke and the fire move, please? 
---
You roam clear to get map control. Scanning takes 3 seconds compared to having to drone the guy out and cutting off his rotations to kill him.
---
If everyone is on site you're free to set up for an attack. As an attacker you have an acog so a roamer holding an angle is no problem.
---
When joonas got an interrogation the ennemy team were on drugs
---
Not with just 3 maps.
---
If they are to make it permanent, 3 is too less variety and flat 0 replayability. Needs at least 8. AND better AI. Then, we can actually go around doing something. Else, it will be like last time- content creators and high ranked players finished playing it on TTS, and on live, they didn't have the interest to play it again.
---
P.s. Ubi did already declare that it won't be coming back.
---
Why did you have to leave in the 50 seconds of pointless video completely unrelated to Siege?
---
Looks great! I'm using Substance Painter, Keyshot &amp; Cinema4D for making stuff like this aswell. It feels satisfying to have everything correctly rendered doesn't it!
---
Lets be honest — the Famas would have done the same thing just better. It *is* objectively a meme gun because it has no benefits over the Famas

I love the fact you wrote "Maestro" down there just so everyone can be sure 😂

Literally is top comment and has gold.

Hope you won to show em they suc
---
No problem, glad I could help. Thanks for the positive feedback.
---
Most likely until end of the season, but could be sooner
---
Completely unrelated question, you don’t even have to answer but do they release new elite skins every season? If so, how many usually? Like two right
---
If you remap your buttons you can make it a button with a smaller dead zone than you can spam it alot faster than normal.

Good work, just a little note tho, the upper body/torso looks slightly disproportionate and makes her arms look even bigger,  but it’s good art 👍

Oh yeah it does, Even just hitting Iray in Substance just makes it 100x better.

Hey! That sounds great, I actually found a discord of girls that I could invite you to. Also do you play ranked? My discord is Wolfy Wolferton#8382

hehehe just remember that G2 can make something similar.... it's just a picture with actual trophies and not a drawing ;) !!

Some of the lower classes require refinement when it comes to humor
---
6-2 6-2 6-2 G2!!!
---
I'm level 215 on PS4 and 78 on pc
---
Right now Ubisoft just wants to see how people respond to be event, so if they like it or not, then they will most likely make this the new ranked and make casual how ranked is right now.
---
dude seriously it could be done so much quicker, it’s ridiculous 
---
Oh it was a clip of me flicking on someone then the title said console players can’t play this even tho I’m on console
---
objectively your above average when you hit gold 4. so id say once your like a high silver people can't say your bad. but that means your above average rank and rank is only partly determined by skill. for example i have a certain rank on my main account, and a significantly lower rank on my second account, which i use only for solo queueing. i have the same skill when i play on both accounts. so i wouldn't worry too much about rank. but ya gold 4 is statistically the average. I've seen lots of really skillfull gold players that i wouldn't mind playing esl with. i know diamonds i wouldn't play a go4 with if you payed me. 
---
Then you just have shitty luck lmao 
---
Upvote this man. Came here to say the exact same.
---
youre right :) but 1 vs 5 clutches do.
---
Ik but testing is a bit messed up by tks and trolls. In all honesty the amount of tachanka bans or blitz bans is stupid.  
---
there is no place for “name and shame” on this sub. read the sub rules 
---
Yeah but not as much
---
I sent you a request on Discord!
---
Yeah but it’s a sacrifice for the greater good of the game. Also try playing with friends to avoid this. 
---
They have a place , aim map knowledge being smarter , but they do not completely define skill obviously as siege is a team game 
---
yea i was and i told the guy i was going to report him and said "cool i haven't got banned for it before" so it was intentional it seems like hes done it a lot so im only guessing that you can do it for one round because of the fact that he had left and the tk

I’m guessing u didn’t see it

Facebook?

I do but most of my r6 buddies are in different timezones so it's a bit hard. Even when there's 3 of you it's hard as there's a lot of 2 man trolls.

No, I’ve been seeing a lot of these two characters more, unfortunately.
---
I feel like the melee hit box isn’t right in the game as I could knife someone but it will go through them but not kill them.
---
This is very annoying against shield ops like blitz and montage, when you knife them then shoot but the knife doesn’t hit the shield(up close) but you just shoot then they knife you..
---
-If you got This far thanks for reading
---
Ik, but even then they don't care about being kicked so they just tk the 3 of you and leave. Leaving you 1 round and 2 people down.
---
Only clash’s shield moves with melee from what I remember
---
British actually
---
But if a person is being realistic they would understand that Golds and Low Plats aren’t bad at all... 
---
There is not much ubisoft can do to monitor this, It is more up to Playstation and Microsoft to deal with the converters and such
---
Yeah it sucks. Ubisoft needs to do something about trolls 
---
Nice! I remember my first time, Valkyrie on Consulate. They all ran through the front door stacked up as close as they could vet. I was in a tiny room next to the entrance and unloaded with the shotgun killing all 5 in 1 mag. It was hilarious.
---
I was playing as alibi once. I got tricked by my own hologram.
---
Agreed 
---
no its fine where it is, I've had to use all of the time given to explain why we should ban lion instead of you know literally anyone else
---
Line 'em up
---
You're playing comp? Hostage in a comp? Nah.
---
I’ve also felt like the actual time it take of the knife to kill you is broken, or out of sync, as I can see blitz start the knife animation and I’d die before he even finished it, which takes away the time you have to shoot his exposed head.
---
Was about to question OPs knowledge in cameras, but see someone already did :D
---
Also you got macro rings to turn your telephoto to macro. My dad has several.

iS tHaT a GaMEr gIrL

I cant fap to this!

What is dead may never die

Would love it if you would do: blitz g52 flash shield, hibana’s fidget spinners or vigil’s ERC-7
---
Cavs 30 damage drop didnt change much. Still a 2 shot from a pretty good range
---
I don’t even know what to reply to this
---
something that a wanted for so long was a HUDless menu animation to use as wallpaper,guess i will never see it
---
I mean, both of them are very alike Nomad is a solo traveler she enjoys the wilderness. Maverick is kind of the off the grid hobo that happens to be a spec ops operative. They look like they take long treks in silence.
---
Im pretty sure this same pic was posted when alibi was relased

r/R6OperatorCreator

I have, but it doesn't annoy me like shield operators do because you can actually body shot them if they are spamming.

Sigh, Fucking bot. But its great there is one to help :)

Had a team ban both Hibana and Echo. 
---
Obviously they did it because of the challenge.
---
*Blitz will remember that*

You realise this thread is about using mouse and keyboard on consoles I hope?

I don't think she was playing as Twitch tho
---
Because Buckkaebi

What? My main or meastro’s cheeky play
---
Y u bully me
---
spending half an hour looking for a T-Hunt game for some upvotes, Respect.
---
Finka is easy to use and has a good ability (+frags!), but her weapons aren't really that good. Nomad has a gadget that you can be really creative with (airjab claymore traps for example), and decent guns overall. I would go with Nomad!
---
Poor genius 
---
I don't think he is, he's my least favorite attacker (because I cannot ever get kills with him, but I always get killed by him) but I don't think he's broken. I think he's just a strong fragger. Plus, I've spent hours practicing how to throw a nitro cell through a mav hole, so he's barely a problem for me.
---
“Just blitz” famous last words, *gets flashed*
---
What the fuck...?
---
I feel you bro ;(
---
To clarify:
---
Xbox - yes
---
PS4 - no
---
PC - no
---
Maestro if ur going for year 3s but I’m assuming you already have him so definitely finks , she brings more to the team than nomad can , nomad is just an operator with an underwhelming ability that helps with fragging but her guns aren’t great 
---
Oh it happens. I've seen it.
---
Jesus, I give up after 5 minutes
---
No that’s just an issue with the killcams. They were seeing the same as u
---
She is part of a CTU, proactively fighting terrorism, it wouldn't be too surprising, and then you also consider her age, and the fact that some people have different genes so their hands may look old (I'm actually one of those people, for being in my late teens). And I've seen them myself in game and... They honestly, really doesn't look that bad.
---
Name checks out.
---
Not needed though
---
Clip of the year.
---
you're the shittiest mirror of them all
---
Who even needs synchronized debris when you can have this? #makebarricadesgreatagain
---
Ikr ): 
---
You're such a dick.
---
Hit it up lone wolf. Then you can practice without four other people getting all of the kills
---
I'm deffo a Lesion main. He just speaks to me.
---
Actually was needed you fucker
---
You should be proud
---
Thats logical and all, but you have to consider what it looks like when shes got the default skin on. Her hands look slimmer and younger and generally more feminine. I think they really just botched it on this one :( so sad cause I love the rest of the skin. 
---
You don't get the AP boost and R6 credits though
---
Ok good to know. 
---
This is what happens when you peek to much
---
If it does not have Lesions icon on the bottom of the shoe its pointless.
---
Good to know. 
---
Ok what is g2a?
---
The lord must not change
---
How does the killcam look like? :Think:
---
my crouch walking screwed me
---
@blackman
---
I know bud, I'm wondering why it's happening so often
---
The fact that people have been abusing Xim M&amp;K for an edge on controller players since at least 360 days without a word or legal call for it to stop by MS, likely means that there is financial means people are unaware of.
---
Even if developers enable use of real M&amp;K in their games, they'd separate by control interface for fairness and people would still use the Xim or pirated gear to have an advantage on controller users.  Not shocking when tons of players abuse anything they can every time they can.
---
With all the issues this game has with hit reg, sync, debris, global gadgets, movement spam, peeker advantage, and such, I wouldn't be betting on Ubi to handle an issue like this anytime soon.
---
No can confirm all shield, and try to step back a bit for knife, the shield Ops have a shorter melee range. Just a tip from a blitz main himself
---
This game calls for help. End his suffering eith Operation Health 2
---
YOU FUCKING MUPPET
---
I know the tachanka bit is a joke, but there are operator interactions in outbreak that could be considered flavor material-- give you a better idea of who the characters are.
---
Nowadays, is anything consistent? I get it, its not appealing, and you have to look at her hands every time you play the character, but, at the end of the day, it's just a skin, and Ubisoft has other important matters to attend to that fixing a few fingers... But you never know, somethings a fixed and unannounced at the start of each season... If it bothers you that much, maybe wait until Operation Burnt Horizon
---
I wasn’t aware that this was an issue on Xbox 360!! I thought it was a newish trend.
---
gotta be sneakin' around, aren't ya?
---
Need help on Xbox. Can anyone help? 
---
I noticed vigil got yinged lioned and jackal tracked at the same time.....

Blackbeard is a pretty toxic operator though

Creepy frost plays
