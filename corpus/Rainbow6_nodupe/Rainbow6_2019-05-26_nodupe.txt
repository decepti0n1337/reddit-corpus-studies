Your forgetting about staircases. Players start seeing red when a drone pings them, they don‚Äôt look around or see their teammates, so when a drone jumps down a staircase, they immediately fire. I‚Äôve seen it happen a few times.
---
I agree. I hope it‚Äôs not a trend. Don‚Äôt mind the occasional cross over weapon but we always need a new weapon. 
---

---
Do it like Finka and Lion whereby they have a new weapon each but reused weapons for the rest (they can mix and match)

I think revealing who her parents are kinda defeats the whole ‚Äúredacted‚Äù theme she‚Äôs got going on

Rotation holes, lines of sight, long angles, foot level holes for plant denial, holes in the floor/ceiling for more angles, holes for impact tricking, holes for nitro cells, etc.

I‚Äôm not talking about tts and season. They do that every season, so it‚Äôs expected. I‚Äôm talking about things such as clash (like I mentioned) where it took them days to respond to us and they told us how they were fixing it. That‚Äôs fine, but in addition you should tweet out something that at least let‚Äôs us know you are working on a solution in addition to the solution itself
---
That only works for Thunt
---
Can you share this to r/casualuk ? They will love it on there
---
Agreed
---
Kinda want to see a movie of all the ones listed here working together to try and survive and find a cure against the zombies while using their own specific gadgets against zombies or to help the team
---
They could have made a new smg... I sort of see your point but I think there‚Äôs no excuse for someone with a such a boring ability like warden to not have a new gun.
---
That‚Äôs the point of ranked. If you wanna get elo you need teammates or your gonna get stomped, if you don‚Äôt have any play causal or live in the lower ranks.

I had the exact same thing happen to me recently.  We were on Kanal, on the rooftop of the coast guard building, shooting into the windows of the control room.  I had been taking pot shots at a Doc, and so had one of my teammates.  He disappeared from view and after a few seconds I looked to the right into another window, and I saw him just standing there, not moving, so I very carefully took aim and shot him in the face, blood spattered the wall behind him, and he didn't move, so I assumed it was a body-and yes, I've had several instances of standing bodies.  However, when the round was dwindling down and it became a 2v4, I quickly realized that the Doc that I had shot in the face was, in fact, still alive and well.
---
This comment deserves a lot more upvotes lol
---
Zofia has great utility for pushing in the building, and clearing rooms/getting positions because her stun grenades are proximity. Ying is good for site takes because of the strong flashes. Zofia is less niche, and overall a better choice for utility.
---
You already have stats like this in game, right? I don't need more pollution in the loot pool, and I'd rather the devs spend time on meaningful improvements to the game engine.
---
Wow no shit sherlock
---
I was thinking of that tooüòÇ
---
Googling your problem and finding the answer quickly&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;making a reddit post asking a question because you‚Äôre lazy
---
I just use it because it instils a false sense of tacticalness to my mindless spraying with the SMG 12 or P90
---
Umm, it's called situational awareness.
---
I imagine it's either to help the other team in acting like a real situation, or for Hostage, it could be a senario where they have a VIP like a US President or Ambassador, and they have to hold down the fort while back up arrives or clear the area to make it safe for evacuation. As for bomb it's kind of the same thing. There's a place they need to destroy, perhaps like a terrorist hide out, and they're protecting the bombs so they can detonate and destroy the building.
---
God damn it the flair is amazing.

Well, i took the print, and wrote something that I thought people would relate

Otherwise: nice

yo you must be a troll. cav, i can see not being everybody‚Äôs first pick, still, nevertheless her literal ONLY purpose is to roam. but hang on..
---
lemme get this straight.. you just said #jaeger is the worst defending op in the game?  you gonna tell me his gadget is trash too? there‚Äôs a reason that there‚Äôs not a single pro game going on without jaeger in every round. EVERY round. lmao, sorry, but you don‚Äôt have the first clue as to what you‚Äôre talking about brother
---
and i read some of the other replies, would you happen to be in copper or bronze by chance? because yes at those levels vigil is useless because nobody drones passed the prep phase, OR goes to roam.
---
Oh, whoops.
---
I'll leave it to your imagination buddy üòâüëç
---
I just wish that when you scan a prisma with a drone it would get pinged like an enemy, making it less obvious which one is you.
---
You still have a chance on getting the type you don't want which can still happen if everyone else does not choose the game mode but you at least know what objective you will be playing
---
It‚Äôs a game company, they have to go through a system, there isn‚Äôt much else they can do. A delay is sadly expected.

Well then the system needs to change, and that‚Äôs what this post is about

Everyone's gangsta until the hostage starts walking

Yeah same, or Kaid even

Did your team message you after? That was really ballsy play good quick thinking though

I don‚Äôt mind the map, I prefer old Hereford more tho
---
They are changing ranked to be bomb only in the next season (like the sixth Invitational)
---
Tactical black cartridge
---
The -1 is probably a representation of null (look up null island for an explanation), the timer is probably a bit flip in the 8th bit position of the timer byte (so a computer problem?).
---
Its the socks the socks are different
---
which sucks cause Vegas thunt was like all i did
---
That deployable shield bug has been in the game over a year now. Just bring in some competent devs to fix your game if it's so difficult for the original devs.
---
Ah. Damn ^^". Whelp..far be it from me to let it go to waste
---
Eh, I dont have enough to get either );
---
If you buy the China version you are going to be restricted to China servers.
---
Can I still get this, or  was it a limited time charm?
---
Yes, yes it does
---
Nice!
---
it doesn't even have the same name, m249 vs m249 SAW. the point is that they're not the same weapon, obviously, since they also have different stats
---
Its supposed to be self depreciating.
---
Same
---
Those were the days
---
I use scroll up and down for my main weapon and pistol. Mouse 3 to knife.  Grandes are f and d is interact.  A is gadget  and push to talk its bound to x with alt as my crouch
---
The AUG for IQ is the best gun in the game to silence for attack, there was something about it not changing bullets to kill across most ranges/armor types (if I remember properly) so that's the best place to start. 
---
On defense, I would recommend vigil or jager, both of their weapons have minimal recoil and hit pretty heavy so the dmg reduction from the silencer isnt super noticeable. Jager silenced is a lot more common since the weapon is just so damn good.
---
There will always be more recoil on silenced weapons so it will take some getting used to.
---
Cause he unequip it?
---
They also removed claymore as it allowed an IQ exploit. As of late I don‚Äôt think we have any news as to when they‚Äôll be reactivated.
---
Only thing is that if u have suppressor in it, u need to hit headshots or u will just down everyone lol
---
lol.
---
I still dont understand why all the European servers are basically right next to each other at the extreme North East of the entire region - especially as then Arabs and Africans get put onto the servers as well. 
---
I been playing Solo on NA instead - genuinely get better average ping, and more people in game chat (who also speak English)
---
I miss my pocket sniper
---
Can we do it ourselves by replacing the file? Asking for help.
---
Yeah haha
---
it's slightly annoying we don't get new weapons. But the abilities themselves are strong. They might be situational. But weak? not at all.
---
How did you make this?!!?
---
Literally happened to me yesterday. My ping was at 12. All of a sudden, I was in the main menu, my ranked team won the match 4-0, and I was banned for 15 minutes and renown penalty. Gotta love Ubisoft.
---
Beat me to it
---
How do you have so many Flairs!?
---
I still watch it from times to times now but it's not as great as before. The Grand Tour is great, if you have Amazon Prime
---
I mean, he shot you so I don't feel so bad seeing him getting dropped, but you ARE doc, the only defender that can actually heal your teammates, and he was obviously trying to get you to heal him (which is your friggin job)
---
Playing as Doc but ignoring your team makes you the toxic one imo.
---
If you wanna spawnpeek so bad play as Rook or Echo if you can't hit without an ACOG, but spawnpeeking with doc and keeping the stims for yourself puts you on a level with a Rook who grabs armor for himself and then destroys the pack.
---
I don't see him talking about it in his latest video, do you have a link with a time stamp?

I cannot wait for this, lackluster operator loadouts but they've really done work with the fixes and changes this time.
---
i had my jammer on that doorway but also halfway where it could jam anything by the reinforcement. instead of saving his shockwire bandit destroys my jammer with it and uses it on the reinforcement
---
They‚Äôll probably think its a joke. Also this is a reference to the things where people say X, then in team chat say don‚Äôt X. Here, the tables are turned and they actually do X
---
Open the game and look at the backside, especially the camo itself.
---
Mute for his brains and glaz for D E A T A I L S
---
The only updates they give are things that are coming out the next day, like mid-season reinforcements, etc. which is not what I am talking about
---
How are we supposed to know where this is
---
And both have different camo patterns on the uniform itself.
---
that ash getting the tk so the enemy team doesnt get the kill. a true soldier

Its called "The Hammer and the Scalpel" i think

Theres a small bug, under Warden's info on the notes it shows Nokks notes

every peak in clubhouse garage is pixel peak. thats why theyre changing the railing

Sure thing u/icybugs, we will get to it right away!
---
*hour
---
Doc's the worst operator you can spawn peek with if you're team oriented. But, the best operator if you're only caring about yourself, since if you don't die you can self-stim both before and after.
---
His utility is 100% reliant on him being alive to use it. If he dies in this highrisk move, you've wasted an operator. Usually the team-oriented pick to to spawn peek with actually Rook, since he can drop his plates. If Rook dies, everyone still has plates. If you get shot by not-headshot, you go DBNO. 
---
But thats only if you're really playing to win with a coordinated team. If you're mucking about and/or solo queue, do whatever the fuck you want.
---
It depends on you. Smoke is good for plant denial, and if you can use the smg-11, your utility is better than mute‚Äôs. Mute is good on obj, and medium to long range battles. It really just depends on the site and your play style.
---
...No? Your initial claim was that they got the scope because theyre the same weapon, which is just factually wrong. Its aight if your ego  prevents you from admitting that tho.
---
I don't know why all MVP screen are like -30 FPS, I can't imagine how much FPS I will have with so much particles effect going on.
---
A large chunk of the player base hates hostage. I can understand why, especially since a good chunk of players tend to ignore the main objective and just want to kill, but I don‚Äôt mind hostage.
---
M4 with Hera arms shit and eotech
---
it sure won't be the last time

My problem is he‚Äôs a long range anchor, and the smg-11 is just more viable close-quarters + shotgun for remodeling.

Triangles signify that that person has reverse friendly fire active, meaning any damage they do to teammates is inflicted to themselves. It‚Äôs new as of the last update, and only happens when that person team killed. Can be deactivated by the person shot if it was an accident
---
You are missing the banned logo at the bottom of it.
---
Spawnpeeking is part of the game. They even do it in pro league. You should be prepared for it as an attacker.
---
The grand tour is good at times but it will never match the mid noughties to 2012 golden era of top gear, partly because the scripted elements are nowhere near as subtle as on the BBC.
---
STOP THE SMOKE ELITE HATE
---
Yeah sadly there is no way to really fix it other then getting rid of TK'ing. But that just absolutely ruins the game and takes it away from it's core. Personally I think we get rid of RFF system. You get in a match with a toxic team just leave and play a new match... Tbh the more you talk and bring up the toxicity the more it will happen.
---
Can confirm does work. I do it all the time and as long as you don't have any attachments on your gun and you're standing on top of the Prisma emitter, you will fool people pretty much every single time. Except for casual. It's the only strategy that I know of that is able to work worse in casual lmao

I wanted to put him in the passive tier for Frost. But the problem with his gadget is, the distance it covers is very wide (horizontally speaking). If you Fuze a window that has a Frost mat laid in front of it, and there's no object to stop the grenades from going too far, they will never explode on the frost mat and they'd go a very long horizontal distance (far away from the mat) before they explode.

I‚Äôm not necessarily a Mira main but I play a good amount of her at mid plat, and there‚Äôs a couple things you want to keep in mind. First, when placing them, you don‚Äôt always have to put in in obj. Sometimes there‚Äôs non-objective rooms that actually are more important to hold. Also think about where you‚Äôre gonna get shot from at your Mira, something a deployable shied can help. Second, crouch Mira‚Äôs are a gamble since at higher level at least people will predicted below them to get your feet. Lastly, don‚Äôt over peek your mirrors. Play smart and use your c4 to stop plants. The best thing you can do for your team is  to stay alive on your Mira and hold whatever room you‚Äôre watching. Reply if you have any comments or questions, Mira‚Äôs a great operator and can be an amazing contributor to the team.
---
P.S. - Not all objectives need a Mira and sometimes she can do more harm, but this is rare so don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
I don't know how likely this is to happen, but what if "Mr Bosak" faked his death to get rid of controversies and that's why it's so inconsistent in both Ela's and Zof√≠a' s bios. And since said bios are given Frome the CTU to Team Rainbow it's the official version of what happened and not the screwed up one with the details of what happened with Mr. Bosak.
---
Why is no one saying bandit? The possibilities are endless. I'd pick castle and bandit 100%.
---
Unpopular opinion but also facts, making ranked bomb only it's only limiting and does not tap into the games full potential like it does currently. If people want to play bomb only then they can go into their settings and turn off secure area and hostage it's that fucking simple.
---
Exactly my point, im not trying to claim its mine, just tryna spread a good meme
---
I dont think so...
---
I guess in close encounters it would make sense
---
Thanks for the clarity it sucks either way getting wrecked cause of rubber bands
---
I mean, that one Rook Diary...
---
I wish that happened to me as a buck main :/

This is of course if Ubisoft bothered reworking/redoing the bots behavior so they don‚Äôt wallbang and do other non realistic stuff.
---
No its bad
---
How do you get operator icons next to your name?
---
In the top left where it shows icons there is 6 :o
---
NO U
---
This is why article 13 was passed
---
If you do it on a pc web browser you can select up to 5 emojis or a certain number of text. Click the smiley face emoji next to the text box when your on the pop up to select your flair and it will have a list of the operator emojis instead of using the regular menu multiple choice area for selecting flair. Sorry if you don't get it, I don't know how else to explain it lol
---
You couldn't just change it to toxic?

Dang, beat me to it

Its a trash game mechanic that ruins your experience

NO, U
---
Siege is a more complete game IMO
---
This game was shit tho.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work with her gadget, she‚Äôs meant to be a fragger
---
You would have to know how the game encodes videos first however after that you could program an encoder and put it into the game definitely. Whether or not Battleye would throw a fit over it is another story.
---
Yeah I remember the feeling when I was younger, even though my voice wasn‚Äôt super deep or defined yet you could tell just enough I was young. I‚Äôm 27 now, but I try to pay it forward when I can, not to sound creepy. I just remember my wow guild being supportive despite my age and it helped a lot, I mean I‚Äôm not a super nice person but I don‚Äôt actively instigate or be mean to people unless in retaliation. But, props for being 12 and being able to deal with it, keep your head up kid and don‚Äôt let mean people on the internet ruin your day. Especially on siege lol

Cut the mag size to 25 and lower the rpm to 850, then you'll see how huge a difference it makes. Your TTK on 2 and 3 armours reduces to the equivalent of the g8a1 at past 200 and the f2 suddenly becomes a wee bit more challenging.
---
Probably the fact you spawn and die instantly with no chance of survival?
---
You can go into the flair settings and edit your current flair to be the correct spelling of the operator name

Well rogue-9 tested 4:3 and it doesn't seem zoomed, but yes, given Siege's 9m average kill distance, and people's ability to cover the gap, removal of an acct doesn't do much.

---
nope this was an all out brawl over a tk the round earlier
---
Wait, it's for Aug and p90? Where? Can somebody give the link please?
---
I agree, just a funny meme
---
You mean "has breached containment" right?
---
if only
---
Like?
---
That‚Äôs not bad
---
Much better than ham sandwich gridlock
---
Are you complaining? Because that looks damn nice imo. It‚Äôs a free cosmetic, anyway
---
The thiccness
---
True
---
Gridlock is chubby. Zofia got that hour glass waist.
---
What i dont like about this reused weapons is that it kills the "lore" that the game has created with the weapons that every ctu use, also the skins, they usually release special skins in bundles or individually for each new weapon based on their ctu and origin of the operators, this completely kills that immersion because now we dont have that unique ctu feeling, its just reused models and skins
---
This is astoundingly unfunny
---
If ur american, i wouldn't wear that to a public highschool lol but yea, its pretty slick
---
Yea I even tryed changing the key com and and it still did not work
---
Ah it's you again. I've been waiting but also forgot about you
---
I guess we‚Äôll see because an Indian operator is coming at the end of this year
---
"War, war never changes"
---
Because the game is balanced in a way that those settings offer more tactical and diverse gameplay

Frost's is off a bit, Vancouver is on the coast, west.

---
This is awesome, but as the only Tachanka mainer on high ranks (hope i‚Äôm not the only one) i can say that Blackbeard counters Chanka too, he can make a lot of damage with his shield
---
intended is that why every new map they try to remove any way of spawn peeking
---
Also Tachanka skin, but i‚Äôm more glad for it
---
This just happened a bit ago and the tachaka is using a glitch similar to the glitch clash got removed for. hes walking around with his turret out and using his shotgun to shoot people.

How so? I know 10+ ways to spawn peek in both Villa and Outback? Please find me an article that includes the developers mentioning that spawnpeeking is not intended or "bad for the game". You can't.
---
As a Mira Main, I actually want that, I already have her Vector skin &amp; now I am satisfied with knowing what her full Alpha Pack Legendary set looks like.
---
Too bad my luck is god awful &amp; I won‚Äôt ever get the full set of her‚Äôs &amp; Jackal‚Äôs.

I own this now it is mine im sorry (no im not)

MISERUM
---
The FMG-9 is very rarely used by smoke, since most people run a shotgun/smg secondary setup. So talking a barely used weapon and putting it on a new OP where it will get way more use actually makes sense to me.
---
Well,they are cool,kinda like them
---
you do realise that if you are moving in cs, majority of your bullets aren't accurate while in siege, you can ads and shoot and move and still be reasonably accurate
---
Should have made bb a passive counter to legit everyone.
---
10 ways I villa and outback?? maybe on outback the other two spawns but storage on outback has 2 spawn peeks and one of them is pure suicide, idk about villa all I know is one spawn peek but even that is not as bad as the older maps such as bank, I remember in a dev stream for white noise they were talking about how its impossible to spawn peek on tower and that its one of the good feautures.
---
Awesome
---
It is the correct spelling Smonk is his name and he uses smokes
---
I'd suggest sledge instead. You could fulfil the same role with an easier primary AR. Learn about opening up vertical lines of sight
---
Community options under the join subbreddit thing button. Press that and the pen icon near the community theme.
---
Lol yea as long as u begin the interrogation before they leave it still counts
---
Lol like any of us have girlfriends
---
Not entirely.
---
His gun recoil has been reduced, but takes a few hours of dedicated practice to master.
---
His shotgun can give away your position from half way across the continent due to the sound, so game sense is mandatory.
---
Added to that, buck shines in a squad more than somebody like sledge, so sledge is a better pick for beginners.
---
Once you have improved your game sense, your sense of game's audio, common hiding spots and movement, you can transition to buck. Until then, sledge is your best man.
---
Unfunny and a waste of money.
---
ranked should be bomb only for balancing purposes. playing secure and hostage can require a completely different team comp and trying to make them competitive in the same way bomb is is just too much. focusing on one game mode means they can really fine tune ranked and make it enjoyable again.
---
But I'm not good, I'm just average, so even when I make good plays I just get throttled down by 3-stacks deranking and all sorts of other dumb crap. Normally I can at least stay just below gold but lately I've been stuck in low bronze because I literally can't go 3 games without trolls or throwers.
---
From 1 - 3 difficulty i would put him in 2.
---
He isn't hard to play but he does require game knowledge, and a lot if you wanna be at the high levels. I would recommend playing sledge first and as you learn more things with sledge you can do them with Buck. Buck can also destroy floors as Sledge can't. Buck has good weapons but hard recoil to control (lmao take muzzle and pull down). They both have nades. 
---
Disadvantage at using Buck is if there is an objective with not a lot of things to destroy and you might wanna pick someone better for it (like the downstairs area in Bank).
---
The best way to practice Buck is to go to a custom game (better with a friend) and find cool spots that you can shoot make insane angles. I know that from the hatch in Kafe you can break the wall and the floor. From there you can see "Train".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For what i use on Buck (if it will help you)
---
AR with muzzle break and acog, laser is an option.
---
Pistol with muzzle break and laser
---
Frag grenades (unless it's a small room with the hostage
---
Yep. A lot of times as soon as you heard it start going off, you knew the round was over for you.
---
You are a phone one
---
That‚Äôs lit
---
Problem with that being? If jager‚Äôs gadget becomes situational, and doesnt come into play, he still has one of the best defending guns, and is 3 speed. My issue is that warden is situational, and has some of the worst guns, and is 1 speed.
---
You're gonna have a bad fookin' time, mate.
---
ofc. after playing almost 300 ranked matches this season making it impossible to get dia, ranked has literally become my casual, and go4 has become my ranked xd

it‚Äôs all fun and games until you get smacked in the face by a 20lb metal slab with rainbows coming out

---
I got piss drunk once and decided to play some casual and ended up killing *many* defenders while upside down and screaming ‚ÄúI am Batman‚Äù in my apartment. Ever since that night, I‚Äôve never been able to consistently do it.
---
But I‚Äôve seen it used many times in pro league so I figure it‚Äôs a solid strategy
---
I haven‚Äôt tried IQ‚Äôs claymore but somebody used it against me. Although it was in a custom game and clash can be used, I haven‚Äôt been able to use deployable shields in custom games. Is it just IQ‚Äôs claymore?
---
This is badass.
---
Yeah thanks ill need it with all the toxic kids on low ranks.
---
Actually anne munition joked about it in a tweet and Epi responded in a very bad way. It's almost confirmed she will lose ACOG.
---
I do agree that acog removal is a bad and lazy way to balance the game, heck even for Ash...  I think she could use a little less rpm and damage but it's my opinion. Or make her 3 armor but that BAAAAAAAAD. Good idea on the mag size nerf tho
---
‚ÄòNerf ash‚Äô
---
Sounds like some sort of tropic disease you really don‚Äôt want.
---
You are just lucky then, I'm a level 180 in my PS4 and have got 3 legendaries
---
You can quite easily counter spawnpeaks if you know the common spots and always check them
---
It be like that sometimes
---
You'll climb eventually. It'll be annoying, but law of probability states that you'll climb if you're better than the ELO you're at. The enemy team has 5 chances to get someone awful, your team has 4 chances, since you're assumably good. 
---
I got a few bad placement rounds cuz' of duo'ing with my not great friend, then follow up with a few leavers. Fell down all the way to copper. Took me not too long to get to bronze, then silver. Season ended, redid placements, got high gold.
---
Thanks so much bro i learned so much from this
---
Although I don't 100% agree with everything still a very nice and clean list. How did you make?
---
But will you do it twice?
---
It's not a bad cam especially if you voice chat
---
Id prefer the gun to get a rework
---
Where is her finger?
---
That ping was so unlucky. Jumped to 235ms out of nowhere
---
her shock drones can destroy mozzie pests and his drones
---
I agree with most of these replies, his CAR has a very unruly recoil pattern, however if you feel you have a good trigger finger, his DMR hits like a truck and has much less recoil, especially with a reflex.
---
Dang guess i was to late to answer the question /s
---
Cringe
---
Not really
---
Jager shot him. Bandit looked like he was being douchey too though.
---
Doki is better tho
---
Nice
---
Wtf
---
I aint missing from downtown ;P
---
T
---
Nice photoshop I guess.... (please tell me this is a glitch)
---
Yes?  Reverse friendly fire is a thing now.  Lets also not forget that the OP does not provide context for why and when the actual shot happened.  I have had my fair share of accidental spawn shots because of tabbing in and we nod and go off on our own merry way.
---
Thank you for making me hear that theme song agian, that brings back memories man.
---
Spawnpeeks are easy to deal with if you don't just start sprinting forward like a moron as soon as the action phase starts.
---
added you

It's console what do you want him to do

Thanks! Not seeing your request, lemme restart uplay

I'm colorblind

What do you mean by fake? And thanks :)

Nice Shot!

Oh the bird? I'm a furry, and that's my character

---
I believe there are bugs with deplorable shields, claymores, and with Clash.
---
Fairly rare from what I've gathered
---
You need to get an Epic, which is second-rarest quality? And then you gotta hope it's Black Ice, which is only for base operators and Buck/Frost
---
I haven't checked claymores, never really used them in the first place but I'm pretty sure clash is banned at the moment for a rework or a fix
---
Ya. I just noticed all of it earlier when me and some buddies were playing.
---
Thank you
---
I somhow hit Silver last season  
---
For a single match
---
Its casual and you are capitao? I just want to know if my game knowledge is correct
---
Fs you almost missed him completely
---
Claymores, deployable shields and clash were removed due to bugs and glitches. Lion got an average rework. Ash's r4c has no acog.
---
Kinda sucks as the shield is echos thing and there's some good spots for valk too, don't really mind about the clash remove tho, she's a bit of a pain imo
---
A dead meme

Am I the only one who sees Nokk wearing a suit?

G2A is extremely harmful to game developers, you should really look up videos about it. It‚Äôs nothing new, and promoting your account under the guise of trying to help people is sad.

Ahh...I see they brought back Commando Pro

i really didnt know it is harmful but thanks for telling me ill take the post down
---
He was deemed op and so they removed him from ranked for a large period of time. Then they reworked him so he was more "balanced"
---
I understand your opinion, but for me, it just doesn't make sense. Some operators have cutting edge tech gadget and some have way less advanced tech in comparison. I don't think it's balanced in a realism perspective. But it's just my opinion.
---
I never understand why they do this. For real.
---
Banned for shooting, TIL
---
We don't need any such "Siege's best gun" thing. We need balance. And btw, the ak12 is siege's best gun. It has what the ak12 doesn't have- consistency.
---
Guns don't need to have identity. In a game like siege which revolved around gadgets as much as it revolved guns, an ops identity is based off his or her entire kit, not just the gun, and in most cases, just the gadget, like cap. Twitch isn't twitch because she has to f2, she's twitch because she can make Mira twitch by zapping her gas tank. She has too much Intel versatility on attack and doesn't deserve a high rpm high damage gun.
---
But, if overnerfing is really a concern, give her one extra damage and bring it down to 850. 38 at 850 means she now becomes a 3 shot on 2 armours as well, but is still balanced against 3 armours at 4 shots. Still pretty darn lethal, because now she has an r4c equivalent, better than before.
---
Surprise Mother Fucker!!!!
---
idk man, seems like you missed your shots.
---
No, I did not. It's just that putting a guy with a hammer and another with a literal tracking device in the same game seems dumb to me.
---
Main subreddit is an utter annoyance. Imagine complaining about a strategy that you could easily work around if you just droned properly with your teammates
---
Whats the 1st?
---
Legitimately useless, tbh. There's no use. You either call it out once you are dead so your friendlies can see, or out just headshot them.
---
In a headshot meta, hp barely matters.

Back that up to the alcohol cabinet for a less steep angle, so you can see more of an operator's head.

I've had this happen to me while defending in a 5 man squad (100% wasn't us). Pretty strange that a team would freeze the servers while they are attacking, causing themselves to lose a round? I get that it does happen, but by no means can you label this as purposeful or not.
---
Maybe a feature where you could customise it for any order you want.
---
Lol year 1
---
Interesting idea but I think an ac130 gunship would just tear trough everything.
---
It was just a small joke on your Frost placements lol, nothing serious.
---
Lol I have headphones otherwise I wouldn't play this game. I can't imagine someone using computer speakers on R6 that would be so hard
---
I'm going to create a complimentary clip to this, a montage of me throwing a c4 and it getting stuck on the wrong thing.
---
If overwatch can do it, R6 can surely do it...
---
right?
---
warden can see through them much more clearly
---
No bandit shot him.

its custom

I hate that ot's called "reading room." How difficult is it to call it a library?

why is ur mouse movement so jittery
---
Yes
---
Sir, we can literally see your POV in the video. First of all, you can't aim for shit. Secondly, even if your hipfire did manage to hit her body, she is low HP after your battle. You're not gonna kill her with a lucky hipfire shot to the leg. And now the biggest surprise, you don't need to headshot with a shotgun to kill a person with 1 shot. Headshotting in this game can even be a bad thing for you if you use a shotgun. Her crosshair was perfectly on you when she shot her first shot, so she hit you for sure. Can you learn to aim and learn the basic mechanics of the game before saying something went wrong here?
---
Which both exist in real life
---
I understand that he gets quite a lot of health but I‚Äôm saying that I‚Äôll put half a clip in him and he still doesn‚Äôt die. 
---
I start shooting him as soon as I see him reach for the stim pistol until he‚Äôs stood upright and he doesn‚Äôt die. I don‚Äôt know why.
---
People tell me that all the time but I dont know. I guess I just move the mouse in increments instead of one big move
---
Well, Tachanka is the best operator for a reason.
---
so using cheats are also okay just because it happens in the pro league?.. nice logic my dude.. 
---
oh and Ubisoft is actually trying to prevent Spawnpeeks btw
---
You can't handle the game how it was originally built so you bust open windows and doors to get rid of any possible competition before they become a threat so that you can feel accomplished about your measly self worth. That's what spawnpeeking is. That's why you don't hear anyone say theyre a "pro spawnpeeker" because even they are ashamed about it. I don't peek. And I look down on those who do to the point that I chase down their bodies and teabag the corpse in front of the ending kill cam so they can see how I disrespect them.
---
These are genuinely not bad operator concepts. My favourite would have to be Sonitus since it seems most effective. However, idk if something like that would be put into the game or how they‚Äôd balance it.
---
Yeah
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Well, I can see why some people can get upset as the beginning of the round as an attacker, you're not really concentrating very much but I do agree when you say it's pretty easy to counter. There's especially no excuse on plane.
---
How is N√∏kk a hard counter to Alibi? 
---
Only reason I can think of is you're meaning when N√∏kk shoots a hologram she doesn't get tagged, which might happen (I haven't played test server) but wouldn't make any sense at all.
---
You're not pretty much flusha because he doesn't cheat

I don't know if this still works but I'm sure you can play any op you want on your own by turning off your internet. You can play with friends on LAN.
---
**Thanks for 3.8k on this stupid overused meme that I just kinda flipped upside-down.**
---
The reason your aim is getting worse is because you are most likely getting more and more frustrated which lowers your performance. I understand the game can be frustrating but try to stay calm and focus, even if your team is awful.
---
I've used the Discord a lot and there are lots of nice people that are willing to help or play all the time. There are people that play there daily, you could possibly find a team to play with on a constant basis. Nothing to be afraid of!
---
me neither :D

I got the turret one on my xbox account, but I only ever play on pc now so it's a shame I missed it on that account. 13/10 would buy if they came back again.

Well it's not in the TTS. You're not very observant are ya?

Me too i sometimes even watch (hear) a Livestream or videos

Quite possibly next season (about 2 weeks).

This is one of the reasons I hate Blitz-if I'm against a Blitz, that flash would have blinded me for a week.  If I'm playing Blitz, I get what this guy got...nothing.  But seriously, why didn't you get flashed?
---
Throughout the 3 rounds I also accumulated points through wall reinforcements , shooting drones, placing barbed wire, kills and assists and he would have had to also gain those exact same amount of points. Think how many different ways people gain points from doing various things and I find it crazy that's someone managed to duplicate everything I did without going over or under in points value.

Look, Smoke with an FMG-9! How did he get that weapon from N√∏kk?

Ive tried going lion when they have aggressive defenders, the info doesn't last long enough to get a spot to wallbang them
---
I've tried dokkaebi, but that doesn't stop anybody from pushing you or holding angles. Only for denying real-time info which is useful however.
---
I've tried blitz but he only works in small rooms/round corners and against bad players who can't shoot your feet/shoulders
---
I've tried monty but you can't get kills with him so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Ying is probably the best bet but she needs a line of sight on the door/window meaning it's good against roamers, but not really people holding angles (unless you flank them but you're better off shooting them in that case)
---
a tad late to the party, posted on here about 50 times already.
---
Oh that was a ballsy play... I never just stand there first time, I always toss them out and once they shoot it, I watch their tracker and if it's moving away or out of line-of-sight, I take the place of the Prisma and wait, that's how I get em mostly.
---
^ also if your doing a custom game you can use clash
---
Thanks, forgot to mention that.
---
Not at all, they use rainbow six as a cover
---
Both extremely useful ops, I personally prefer maestro, due to him having very good weapons, with a good  gadget. On the other hand arch has good guns, but a very good gadget. It really depends if you want a better gun, or a better gadget
---

Sorry but you have no idea what you're talking about.

That‚Äôs been happening for ages. Not as extreme as this but I can‚Äôt stand the amount of times a player is looking at a 45 angle in a random direction. But kill cam shows looking straight at me.

the kind of person who knows better than to sit in a queue for 10 minutes. anytime i play ranked at night the queue never takes longer than 2 minutes. nice try though
---
Though your Level is blessed.
---
I also have really dodgy performance (not fps). At the beginning of the game I'll be getting many kills, smart plays, etc and then I'll end up doing dumb shit and having trash aim in the same match. Or one match I'll be top fragger and the next I'll struggle to get more than one kill (not because of the enemy team, but because I just can't play consistently)
---
I doubt anyone wants to play with me, I'm trash and don't like using mic
---
If you don't already have him maverick or jackal. Jackal is easier to play but his weapons aren't the best. Maverick is harder to play but he has better weapons
---
What kind of ranked have you been playing? I get 5 minutes but 2 minutes? That‚Äôs way too little time

yet more evidence of the inferiority of console peasants

False. I just thought it would be cool to have an ac 130 in the game

Recently really started to play and appreciate echo much more. Easy to invest a dozen games into and feel comfy with his loadout and gadget.

so i‚Äôm a noob, but what rank are you?
---
Still have it installed onto my xbox, and I've had it equipped for every season. It only now decides to not appear in game. And that still doesn't explain why the other camos aren't in game, since they're still purchasable

You're annoying as fuck dude stop fucking talking. This is why 12 year olds shouldn't have any fucking technology
---
First you should buy all the base game operators because they are inexpensive, then while playing casual games just experiment. Just because you lose doesn't mean the operator isn't your thing. You need to try all of them and see which ones are good for your play style, then once you know how you like to play you can start either start improving on certain parts of your game to potentially use any operator or use the knowledge of how you prefer to play to figure out what dlc operators to buy. Winning isn't always learning and remember to have fun

its classic siege panic if you break it down:
---
1) first mp5 burst doesn't count because kill 
---
2) i actually manage to revive myself after mentally accepting overtime about 10 seconds prior
---
3) At this point i'm already farther than I had planned and don't know hibana is down - i was expecting to go down like scarface with my pistol. As soon as I see hibana down I think I'm focused more on staying out of thermites peripheral vision then flicking. I thought he was going to get the knife on me at about ~12 seconds into the video, but he out panics me and i somehow eventually hit him. 
---
don't think aim on the last 2 kills was too egregious.

3) i se

Get ready to get bannedüòé

Jackal is a good op to start out as. You can learn how to take down roamers with him since he's one of the best ops to hunt roamers with. His PDW has 50 round mags and it's easy to control the recoil. You could also try using Zofia. She's basically a slower Ash with 2 concussion rounds. Her LMG has 150 rounds in it too.
---
You're a good man (or woman), thank you
---
What can I say, I grew up hearing I‚Äôm an idiot every single day. That and people being rude to people just trying to ask for help gets my blood up. You got me real good. Yay for you. 
---
Genuine enough for you?

What the fuck even is this lol
---
Rainbow Six 3 was the first game I‚Äôve ever played on my Dads desktop. Was pretty awesome but I was horrible.
---
Well yeah I figured that much. I lost like 10 games in a row before I even got a win. That's something I do like about the game though, every time you die, you learn something new. I also learned that 9/10 times you want to take the ACOG sight. Frost only seems to be good in maps you already know tho and IQ, I can detect the bombs and traps but seems a bit useless without other players to coordinate on it, I'm guessing base game is year 1 ops?
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/rainbow6game/status/1129536325756047366

Actually they did, and they are still in T hunt, but not in custom. Which I wonder how this will affect pro league.
---
Good because gray if fucking dumb as rocks
---
Yes grey is the messages being sent, blue is OP responding.
---
You can easily make friends too. It's mainly casual that has the toxic players in it. Once you think you're good to play ranked there's not gonna be a whole lot of toxicity unless your rank is low.
---
Personally I think it's not to do with your panic. I think you have your sense set up incorrectly. The jerk/panic movement was incredibly slow but the response wasn't too bad. Maybe take some time and look up some of the csgo sence tutorials.
---
Gold 3/4 lol.
---
That's why I use lesion his GU mines provide valuable information as to where people are.
---
Embarrassing that you missed the joke there
---
How about you provide examples?
---
They were like " Am I a joke to you?"
---
I just love how he stepped in the welcome mat with gu mines on it. Also the kapkan celebrating in the back.
---
an idea, can we not put a scoring system for this problem, lets say i use a mouse and keybord, i got flagged so many times, could not UBI ban him or al least ban him from rank for a while, a day or two, the more you use the mk the more you might get banned , what do you think ?
---
I've always preferred it over the shotgun honestly, I do so much better with it than I do with his shotty
---
You did great with the eyes holes. The fact that I can see them instead of just a fish net is a good attention to detail.
---
Ur arguments aren't convincing and you don't know what Ubi is doing either so how can you critique me for that. And the weird passive comments "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Think harder." Just stop.
---
They really can't think of any other guns...at all lol. No, Nokk being able to move past cameras isn't more impactful than Hibana or any other character. Warden can have 3 armor fine, but why did they put him a suit. Sounds like retroactive balancing. They can choose which guns get acogs, like Ash, so it makes no sense to reuse weapons. And no COD and Siege are not dramatically different. The game mode in question is Hardcore Search and Destroy, which played pretty similarly to Siege minus destruction.
---
i managed to complete it on first try. what i did is i went with IQ and searched for the bombs outside(!) with help of her scanner. then i pinged that location to my teammates and once you usually break an adjacent window you spot the bomb anyway. then plant, cover from a window (but watch out for terrorists outside) and wait till defuse. once defused, go outside again and scan for the second bomb if you haven't found it already. but the point is to move outside the university to avoid unnecessary firefights in the building.
---
I feel there would be a lot of false positives then. Some people I know look like they use mnk but are actually using a controller. Hell I have moments that are like that. It really is a complicated issue.
---
both of these were intentional. i know i already brought that up to u in a pm but i just want it to be publicly known :)
---
So that you end up banning people for literally no reason if you're wrong? The adapter makes it look like the m/k is using analog controls. There is no way for the system to establish what is happening. I'd rather not trust the votes of a bunch of salty randoms.
---
Look man, if you have ever tried to beat your cassadeia and play siege at the same time, you would understand
---
It's a competitive shooter
---
I have big bwain
---
At first nokk isnt more impactful but brings op more new possibilities than hibana did. Warden is in a suit because of his lore. They can chose who gets acogs but smoke without acog and nokk with acog seems stupid.
---
Siege has a prep phase and is all about this cod is just killing and has nothing to do with siege ur wrong man so terrible wrong.
---
same i play 100%, but again you can always tell, i douno , we have to come up with something

Ok

why is that ?

so the company that we are paying money , can't fix our problems, god tire point

You have no examples to support your case, then you have no case.
---
I mean if it would actually fix these problems, then yes I‚Äôd love to have it. Again, I know it‚Äôs not an easy fix, but these are still major problems that need to be addressed for the health of the game and the sake of my fucking sanity.
---
Ur main issue is using her smg over her shotgun
---
Because they use adapters to trick consoles into thinking they're playing with controllers.
---
Finka Loadout: (use frags)
---
Primary: 6P41 (with suppressor)
---
Secondary: Gsh-18
---
Glaz Loadout: (use smokes)
---
Primary: use a suppressor and take point for your team
---
Ying Loadout: (use beaching charge)
---
Primary: T95 LMG (With Flash-hider and Holo)
---
Secondary: N/A
---
Nomad Loadout: use stuns
---
Primary: AK74M (with Flash-hider and reflex)
---
Maverick Loadout: use stuns
---
Primary: AR15.50 (with Angled grip and suppressor)
---
This setup does best for pushing to and off of sites. Utilize stuns for initial clearing and the candelas for post-plant. 
---
Glaz should be one of the pointman and pick off enemies through the gas and post-plant through his smoke. 
---
Maverick can make kill holes for his team to use and take a similar point/entry role with Glaz. 
---
Ying and Nomad are on flank watch while Finka should be acting as medic and force multiplier whenever one of the others are being pushed hard. 
---
Pistols with high cap are for tense moments between reloads but always aim for the head and you should be fine.
---
Try this out and don't be afraid to substitute if you either don't own an op or don't like using one in particular. 
---
Good luck and happy hunting.
---
Exactly, I would be more fine if he said "Hey guys be careful there's x glitch out rn" but doing step by step teaching people how to do it is bad.

I think the crossover is bigger than you think, remember the blackout icon plague.

I get the lore, secret service and all that. Not really the point. Nokk feels slightly more useful than Vigil, but give me a Thatcher or Hibana any day.

---
1 speed , shitty gun, stupid glass that force you to stand still to see through smoke, situational operators to the point that is more useless than Tachanka, you can look at macie jay gameplay and you will see what i mean
---
You can still use the acog though? I use it all the time
---
My issue is not being able to use both and feeling like I have to choose one over the other
---
Casual is 3min30, the newcomer playlist is 4min
---
You've seen thatchers six inch blade, now witness frosts six foot blade.

Let me in! LET ME INNNNNNN!

If you have watched macie played him...is that what you want to see from a operator...did nothing ?
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
Still better than Siege :D
---
Dude more then Half of the player Base is xbox and ps4, think about it
---
I remember the old days when you could shoot someone through a reinforced wall they were putting up. Glad they changed that
---
If you're looking to play supportively I'd recommend using an ACOG, but if you're looking to play a bit more aggressively I'd recommend using either a holo or reflex (your preference)
---
I don't see her countering the roaming meta, but yeah I guess she is the only stealth character on attack. My problem is that she is like Cav where her utility largely comes from getting kills. Cav has interrogation to make up for this. Really just think she needed more utility, like a silent breaching device or something to benefit the team.

At first ur initial post wasn't about this but she can provide teamplay through flanking and breaking the defense or being teamed with a jackal. Of course she won't be a echo or hibana but u have more possibilities these aren't that good but u can do a lot of different things
---
It looks like the enemy team has 16 operators
---
&gt; Added to that, they have "data limits", and knowing how old this game's engine is, that shouldn't come as a surprise. (Revealed by  pro)
---
So, ummmm, how they are gonna support this game for ‚Äúmany years‚Äù then? It‚Äôs only Year 4(4 out of 10 they initially told us about), and we are having recycled guns. I cannot correlate these two things - ‚Äúdata limits‚Äù and ‚Äúwe are gonna support this game for years‚Äù.
---
When Ela came out she was a broken ass operator. She had little to no recoil and an insane ammo pool. She also had 4 mines. She single handedly broke the game. So, to compensate for their fuck up Goobi gave her gun recoil. Unfortunately for console y‚Äôall just gotta suck it up. On PC she‚Äôs decent, but buffing her recoil would make her op on pc and console, again.
---
Jeez over dramatic much? And it's not half the playerbase, it's an extremely small portion actually that plays secure area exclusively. IMO it's a much more cancerous game mode bc seige wasn't built to support it. Secure area is bad, I can understand why people enjoy it but from a competitive standpoint, it isnt balanced or viable... which makes it bad especially when ranks are concerned.
---
Just wait till it's up
---
Imagine the ending killcam with fuse charge.

how do you change that thing that says which operator you main cuz it's bugging me

Where do you check this?

I'm not making stuff up. You can see the player base ranks in the new ranked hub menu. The vast majority are low ranks and don't give 2 shits about PL. I'm a plat player btw.

not necessary imo, everyone would just gravitate to this one site and then we run into the same problems as now because this site would have all positives and none of the drawbacks of the other site 
---
I didn‚Äôt understand the ‚Äònerf everything mentality‚Äô argument, all the changes they‚Äôve made have been for the better to balance operators in one way or another
---
What do you mean fortnite better than this gay ass game
---
thought so
---
Exactly. Feel like most of the people complaining on here are like level 20 Bronze 3‚Äôs that don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre doing yet. People never want to blame themselves and instead blame the game. These people will never get better at the game if they fail to realize it was their own mistakes most of the time that led to their downfall

Just listen to which one goes off. Its not that difficult

most low effort bait i‚Äôve seen in my life
---
I still argue that jackle is not a counter to cav at all. Her silent step stops him from tracking her and leaves no footprints for him to scan while it is activated. 
---
At most a lucky jackel should only get 1 ping on a cav if her silent step is on cd. But after that she can turn it on and off to stop the rest of the pings. 
---
If anything cav is a counter to jackel because if her ability is on when he scans her footprint it wastes one of his charges.
---
I don‚Äôt Mach 6, it irritates when teammates do though. I spawn in and have to systematically write off each window and door before moving - I nor any other should have to do this. I shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about dying in the first 10 secs because some asshat wants to spawnpeek.
---
Did he just walk through the door
---
Riiiiiiiip

NOOOOOOO

My opinion is that they should have kept the thing the same; then again I thinked they changed it to prevent Ying rushes

You know i got one week ban after an accidental tk

Nope in fact I LOVE defending it.

Thempark actually has 3 very viable bombsites. It's definitely balanced enough for Ranked.

What are you pissed about? No one is offended, we are just talking about what happens if the leave mid-interrogation. You are the gold 4 that gets carried every game and just wanted to tell everyone that because we are in silver we are apparently bad. So do everyone a favor and take your ass off of siege.
---
I mean od actually probably use the acog more in most cases, but I believe having another site with slightly more zoom could help change what sights people pick.
---
And my bad, didn't really explain it that well I guess. Regarding nerf everything what I mean is this, instead of just instantly trying to limit the acog as they are starting to do now, try making one of the other sights more useful, we currently have 3 1x sights. So maybe if they took one people would pick that more and the acog less. My point is let's try something new before just limiting the acog.
---
This is some pretty weak b8 say somthing like Ash needed the acog to be removed or Tower should be the only map in ranked.
---
True, I am silver 4 tho so I can't really say much.

Either the PS4 recording system or buying a capture card like an elgato

I find plane to be more unbalanced then theme theme park. Then again like I said everyone has their own opinions on the matter that this just happens to be mine.
---
That's why there is so much outrage about? That's why every other post is about bomb only ranked? Plat 2 and above is great over exaggeration of who wants it. People from all ranks want it, and the majority of this sub and the community either likes it, or doesn't really care. 
---
It is something you have to adapt to. Plus you say casual has no meaning? Neither does ranked? Unless you care that much about a charm?

Hit or miss, I guess I never... Nevermind

Yeah but going from carrying the team to being a dead weight in like 20 minutes?
---
Kinda off-topic but I noticed that if I change my mindset/approach (not sure what to or how, but sometimes it just happens like magic) then I turn into a way better player and start getting kills, etc. Usually this is by chance but yesterday I somehow just decided to play better (only lasted for a bit :(). I always thought mindset couldn't change make a difference but now I'm starting to doubt myself

Except Tower is a somewhat garbage map tbh. Most people dislike it. And this is coming from someone that likes Tower. I do agree, Bank has some extremely shitty spawnpeeks and run outs. That‚Äôs why I only spawn sewers now. Because everytime I play Bank, half the team rushes Alley and wrecks all the kids on my team not already ADSing. It‚Äôs quite sad. But I think this is more of a map balancing issue than a spawnpeeking issue. Spawnpeeking is fine as long as it isn‚Äôt killing you as soon as you spawn. Or isn‚Äôt garbage like Bank. Bank has trash attacker spawnpoints. Hopefully they rework Bank attacker spawns or something in the future. Because the amount of runouts  with C4‚Äôs and high rof primary head level prefires is getting ridiculous

you just can‚Äôt stop being angry can you lol you‚Äôre the one who comes here and acts toxic but i‚Äôm the one who needs to delete reddit? nice logic you have there genius. people like you ruin the siege community. i‚Äôm done arguing with an angry kid. have a good one mate

You just can't stop being pathetic. People who just assume the vast majority of the community agrees with them are ruining the community. Go away now!

Am I the only one who think that some of is these cosplay guns look way to real to bring to a public spot

Are you on console or something? Your aim while shooting the Castle was kinda horrible, but predictable if on console.
---
Great post thanks for sharing
---
if you add in something that rivals the acog, you haven‚Äôt solved the problem that certain operators are too strong with the acog, you‚Äôve just given everyone a 1.5/2x. It‚Äôd massively fuck the balancing imo unless it was only for certain ops like the acog is now.

I had this exact game for PS1. Good fun

Why more Americans? We have plenty already.

It's really not when we have Lesion, Ela, Kapkan, etc. to gather that intel, this hypothetical gadget is immediately outclassed from the start.

Don't you think we have enough American operators? 8 in total! Why not give other nations some exposure:

- India

- Israel

- Argentina

Thank you very much! This is my third time editing a montage. I know the timing is not perfect on some kills but im trying to improve with that. But sometimes the kill just feels off when there is nothing to it, just getting the kill dosent seem right. But im trying as hard as i can to time the kills. If you would watch my first montage i think there is a big improvement not just in the quality but also in this. 
---
And ill also try to figure out how to isolate teamspeak even tho i think it adds sort of a nice background to it (only if its callouts for the game, whitch i know isnt the case everytime) 
---
Thanks for the feedback since i didnt get much of that yet!

Thanks!

That's not a pro, just a guy who put G2 in his name. And knowing where and what Maestro was doing isn't the luck. It's that he fired one shot at head level for anyone standing behind the counter, and then the recoil made his second shot hit the tiny pixel that Maestro was peeking through. The recoil was the lucky part. And even if it was a pro who knew Maestro was there and what he's doing, hitting that tiny shot from so far away would definitely include luck
---
Me need d

Yea. Also if u got a mute shes pointless as u can just stand on the routers
---
Makes sense
---
It‚Äôs 2019, I thought we were passed taking pictures of screens
---
But her dmr is still good tbh
---
They have already done the SAS and clash from the UK. Though they are doing another American in Warden.
---
They might do a few more of the Scandinavian countries.
---
I'd like to see some more South American operators, say from Colombia or Brazil.
---
Greek operators would be campy and possibly funny, because you just know one of them is going to be Spartan themed (the other possibly Athenian)
---
Are u retarded?
---
how would we know that's another year away, I'm hoping 2 are from Sweden, one from Norway with Taiwan, one from Ireland with Greece and 2 from Finland.
---
Lol if that‚Äôs what you define by luck then this whole fucking game is luck dude. Dude knew he was there period. Whole name of the game is spray and pray

I bet next match you‚Äôll be on team with a hacker and get a mmr rollback

Haha yeah that's old school man. I played on IGZ, then participated in the online tournaments when the Rogue Spear expansion released.

Can't even remember what I played on Mplayer though. Sudden Strike maybe?
---
‚ÄúNot my problem‚Äù
---
sounds like a cool country
---
They should put it back in. From what i've heard and who i've spoken to, people don't mind waiting extra time to play a map they want to play. Outback and fortress are hated in ranked so people shouldn't have to play htem if they don't want to.

why would you post this again. literally everyone already knows because it‚Äôs in her bio in game.

That happened to me yesterday it was funny

How do you get the visualizer behind the vigil icon?
---
Oh boy you have no idea
---
IMHO: suppressors only for fun, it's unlikely that competitive player would fall into "where that shot came from" situation: you still can hear the shots and most of the time you would see an enemy or atleast suggest where he is.
---
Suppressor damage reduction is solid, especially in 25+ metres situation, same goes about recoil.
---
I just got headshotted through my shield
---
Not really, the AKs in game have way less recoil than the c8, but the c8 being a copy of the AR15 has a piston for making the recoil softer and the 5.56 nato has less mass than the AK, making the recoil even less of a problem.
---
That's what frost gets for playing hostage

You‚Äôve got a lot resting on that next match

That dedication. Respectable. You either get flamed by your teammates or gassed the fck up so hard.

Interesting. I'm also left handed, in basically everything I do, including writing, sports, all that, but gaming is my only exception, I guess I grew up using my right hand to aim. Welp, if that works, good for you then.
---
When that happens I tend to get stuttering in game (but usually for bigger games like arma) hence why I swapped over. It‚Äôs smoother overall for my recording set up
---

Looks like console to me. The console community has always been horrible.
---
My bad, misunderstood the question. I thought it was talking about the drive inside the PC. In that case I usually hear people calling it a USB stick.
---
Not sure honestly.
---
Or misunderstood the question. No need to be so harsh about it, fuck.
---
I‚Äôm gonna get the ice cream cone one first and then the secret star but just hoping that they release the ice cream cone skin from the start and it‚Äôs not part of some bs event packs
---
I haven't played Bartlett in forever. I'm assuming they took it out already.
---
Actual RNG makes it so you actually have to get lucky. Unlike other games I'm pretty sure this one has no bad luck protection and you can spend you're whole time never getting one.
---
If I'm not mistaken this is a bug tho
---
The person that leaves should still face an MMR loss and a temporary ban, the longer the ban gets. Of course there should be a 5-10 minute wait just incase the player is just rebooting due to a bug.
---
Yeah and you can change the buttons' roles on DS4 through Accessibility on the PS4 settings so...
---
Israel would be cool, maybeeeee Indian, the other two, not so much
---
Yeah it's a real charm. The charms are about 99% of this games cosmetic appeal but the community hates them
---
What kind of aim was that
---
have my upvote for condolences

Guess who got their steam account back

It‚Äôs still in the game just not in rotations

Yes but everyone appreciates it as R6 or R6S
---
Damn...
---
Those are good points, though I still think that the 1.5-2 second window where enemies don't realize where they're being shot from is incredibly important (even in higher ranks). I'd also say that if you're playing as N√∏kk, your goal should be to sneak within 25-ish meters from your enemies. The damage reduction at that distance is pretty negligible, in most cases. I think your points are totally fair though, I'll have to run some tests with my buddies and see what they think.

Attack get in the building is the best thing you can do as an attacker don‚Äôt sit on the roof for 3 minuets. Drone before you enter. And as a Monty main it took me a really long time to get use to rifles and snags in general because I limited myself to a shield and a pistol I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt play shield ops because there quite fun (and frustrating at times) but don‚Äôt let them be your crutch.
---
Wtf is this
---
You only suck because you didn't play it from the start. If you played it from the start it'd be natural for you to make certain plays and setup certain strats since it'll build into you. When you're not used to something you have to think of it more, after a while you'll get better. Secure is basically TDM too, Bomb is actually more like an objective mode so be prepared to actually play the objective.
