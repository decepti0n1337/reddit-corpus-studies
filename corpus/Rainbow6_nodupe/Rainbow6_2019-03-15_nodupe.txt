Exactly, you should be aiming for headshots. And the MP5 has no recoil, which makes it perfect for headshots

Why?
---
because they haven't done anything to it yet.. and it's going to come out of beta in season 2
---
Countering the spawn peek
---
Making the low level playlist was a dumb idea of Ubisoft, tbh.
---
They basically forced anyone that like old ranked better than the try hard pick and ban list into casual.  And casual still doesn’t have old ranked defender spawn vote.
---
So naturally Of course increase in the “taxic “ behavior was bound to happen, along with more smurf accounts.
---
The new list should have been a clone of old ranked, or simply added defend voting to new casual.
---
Ubisoft dropped the ball, by trying to use the playlist changes to promote pro league views.
---
Congrats nice one
---
You get your 82 Renown faster atleast 
---
You were the only one to reference gachi. ♂ Thank ♂ you ♂ sir ♂
---
Did you win the game?! Really good clutch either way!
---
I thought this was a photoshopped meme at first holy shit
---
The special even could be like On her majesty's secret service with a special rescue op for ~10 hostages from the masks
---
Ela and Finka would be your best option then. 
---
Finka is good at rushing and helping out teammates if they are going into objective 
---
While ela did get nerfed if you play well she is still a viable roamer and can get the surprise on enemies, while also using her ability to inhibit enemies from entering objective
---
Kaid on the other hand is a semi anchor so he wouldn’t really fit what you want 
---
Funny clip but you need to lower your sensitivity my man 
---
Plz give me
---
FOOKIN LASAH SOIGHTS
---
I solo or at least duo-q a few times a week, and other than the occasional asshole, it's pretty okay. 
---
by that statement then id say probably finka. give everyone a boost and pick up down teamates with ability as well. then id say go ela and kaid for last
---
Lmao it looked like he got straight up slugged

Ok thanks for the suggestion I might get ela because I am feeling kinda bored on the defender side

No. But theyre only 500&gt;1000&gt;1500&gt;2000 and i think it continues to 2500 as its max.

Can't tell if woosh for me or season 2 is different from year 2

Use an impact grenade in the doorway, a mute, use a kapkan trap on that door or castle it so then youdint have to deal with it, put clash in the doorway, again blow a hole in the wall next to the doorway, use the new operator and hijack a twitch drone and destroy it that way. Those are some examples another would be being good at gun play and eliminating enemies as they approach you.

A 1.0 k/d in plat is much better than a 1.0 k/d in silver. Just think, if you only played against silvers your k/d would be like 1.6 xD
---
ur toxic u tried to TK
---
Also shotguns aren't instakills to the head 
---
I'm geussing you're kinda new to the game? Killing people through drone holes isn't really anything unique it happens almost every other game.
---
I don't get why they nerfed the recoil of the SMG sidearms rather than nerfing the firerate and damage. I think it would make more sense if they had an average or mediocre DPS with a low ammo capacity and having a little more recoil than other SMGs. Right now they only feel useful close range, which is pointless if the whole advantage in having one is that you can also bring a shotgun. 
---
1 shotguns don't do extra headshot damage. 2 you completely deserved that
---
For the Kaid comment, isn’t that a bad thing though. Surely you’d prefer actually making his weapons decent instead of keeping the scope on the pistol. Why should his main weapon struggle and the pistol excel?? Just curious that’s all
---
If you don’t clutch a 1v5, your teammates vote to kick you instantly
---
Ahhh go crazy ahhh go stoopid
---
I think this is my new favorite since hemorrhage
---
You lucky son of a bitch😠😠😠

Why am I a low skilled player because I prefer Siege when it was more tactical? Now it's more like CoD..

Should head to the hardware store get some portable flat led lights to Glu to it.

No I'm discount. I have a flashlight. For the GSG9 patch and German flag I just used some crayons. 
---
Sorry I meant "sPoiLeR mArK"
---
if you havent noticed most of the low ranked players just go to ranked because casual has a disproportionate amount of high golds and plats where a low gold and under would have an easier time in ranked. its a fucked system but it works
---
I thought that might be the case... ah well. I'll just play through it 
---
If everyone has a booster equipped it leads to a +190% renown gain which is pretty insane, you could get 1200+ from winning a ranked match. If you grind extract hostage on normal in a full-booster squad you will end up with absurd amount of renown.
---
Didn’t they say they had more planned at the invitational?
---
You are also not allowed to vote kick someone who is the last one alive and failed a clutch even though your 11 year old ass was dead a few feet down the hall
---
And I think all the subsequent nerfs to Vigil, and the fact his duration is so short, it would be ok. Hard to tell though unless they ever actually tested it. Primary nerfed, machine pistols nerfed (couple of patches ago), impacts would do less damage. A lot worse than previously in that regard 
---

It's very hard to cooperate with someone who plays in a different style.For example,I drone the room,hold the angle,watching my teammates' back.But they just rushed in and kill everyone,or step on a frost trap and get interrogated. :(

The game environment and purpose isn’t even comparable between Siege and Apex.

The ONLY similarities are there being guns and first person view.

If this is the worst sound you’ve ever dealt with in a game, I’m sorry. It actually works really well for what it needs to do.

Downvoted for not using the pmm.

lol dude we are in shock though. he keeps claiming upa nd down its BS but idk seems sketch now.

I’ve seen the same shit it’s fucking garbage

Enjoy your banned for being boosted by cheater ban for 15 days

K/D doesn't even show in ranked? Personally, I don't think it matters at all. The players who go look up stats obviously don't play the game at a high level to understand that k/d is not indicative of skill whatsoever. There are pros with a k/d around 1. Just win the game and keep stacking that elo
---
Although I understand if you just want to track it for yourself to see improvement, agree with a feature like that. Might be coming with the reworked ranked hub next season?
---
Mozzie's reload for his commando gun. It is amazing and I will never not cheer every time I see it.
---
ooooooh i see what you mean,

wait, hes a bum? what?
---
On PC its more frequent but not with friend groups just toxic individuals. Console I can agree with that there are more toxic clumps of friends.
---
Nice 
---
Impossible for me. I hate stupid shit and the sound design in Siege is the most autistic shit I've ever had to endure. These autistic developers want realism but bullets can't even penetrate 1/8 inch sheet metal. Ubisoft Montreal is a fucking joke. 
---
Middle East pingers crouch spamming in EU is the main reason my friends don't play this anymore. They stopped a year ago and shit still hasn't changed. 
---
I completely disagree with your last sentence. If you don't see where it's been placed when it is placed (which could be quite hard without seeing the Nomad doing it which at that point you would just shoot her anyway) it's almost impossible to see if placed in a good location. This isn't even mentioning the fact that you can place it in a way you can't shoot it before it activates unlike most claymore placements. It's like comparing a valkyrie camera which can be thrown nearly anywhere and can often be hard to see with a bulletproof camera which can only be placed on a wall or floor.
---
Maybe you've just played with Nomads that put their airjabs in plain sight in the middle of a wall but if you're playing against any competent Nomad they'll put them in a place where you have to either know where it is to shoot it (unlikely), impact it (somewhat likely) or just run into it to get rid of it (most likely).

Ok, then spend your time elsewhere, the skins are optional. 
---
It's casual it means fuck all and the "clutch or kick" is a siege meme similar to the Lord tachanka or 'rook mine' it's just a harmless laugh me and my mates do it when we play casual, it's just a bit of fun 
---
LIAR
---
Fuck me you know it's bad when you're calling people autistic while not knowing how sound works. 
---
Sound travels via vibrations, considering most walls have cavities as well as insulation etc, those will muffle the fuck out of sound because the sound waves will spread through those and lose energy. In other games they ignore walls which is why Sound is ezpz in other games to use while being totally unrealistic, in Siege, they get taken into account. 
---
No other game has a sound system where if you shoot a hole in a wall, it makes it easier to hear in the adjacent room due to that holes existence. Literally no other game does this. 
---
So get the fuck out of here with this bullshit, uneducated "mimimimi sound doesn't work like other shitty, poorly throughout games that are lazy and unrealistic as fuck" argument. 
---
Not gonna cry About, Nothing She could Really do to win to be fair:)

People that have mnk on console buy every season pass and elite skin they could get a pc but want an advantage.

I guess, just annoying usually. Even if I die, at least it’s hi to gun, not gun to essentially a metal/glass wall
---
damn even if it was casual and we didn't know?? lol
---
Yay understand but a lot of people like using the real operator because the attachments and have better gadget 
---
This happens for me too-never thought of blaming the update, but it makes sense. It’s ever since the update I honestly can’t play the game. Pls fix this ubi, if anyone has any solutions I’d be happy to test it out. 
---
Use all the credits on Tachanka. 
---
would love this one!

---
Oh he only got done by anti cheat bot which doesn't affect you, but even if you was playing ranked there's nothing the game could do to you as it's not your fault

This is \*c o o l\*

just kill your team before they even think about killing you

Thanks! Unfortunately we lost 5-4 in OT :(

Gah!! Why didn't i think of that?
---
Ah, some of his dialogue lines kinda sound that way. “Efficiency is clever laziness” and “I’ll just lie down and let Yokai handle this” are the first lines that come to mind.
---
No you got abu al fuku crouch spaming with m&amp;ks and in in gold/plat and im dealing with this shit
---
I feel bad for those people. 
---
Like. They know they're shit. They trash with a controller and get their ass kicked. They know they're trash on PC and would get their ass kicked. 
---
So what do they do? Buy an unfair advantage brag about rank (even though they're probably mid gold) to feel better about themselves while completely ignoring the fact they're cheating. 
---
Actually if you play ranked you have the opportunity to watch the most toxic FPS community in the universe because people there treat the game like it's casual while all the highly sweaty players play casual.
---
(Xbox) can’t even play on east servers anymore without getting booted the majority of the matches, absolute joke.

---
since when did Monty get buffed with a F2 as a primary weapon
---
Because they know they'd be fucked if they went against people on a level playing field lmao
---
Nothing can change your mind? That's a dumb statement to make in any situation, but especially more now about s1mple.
---
There is litterally no recollection of s1mple being toxic since he left liquid for Na'Vi about 2 years ago. He donated prize money to charity, not publically (someone else made it public). He's been nothing but respectful to everyone in interviews, never called himself the best even though he very clearly is, always is humble and talking about working harder and getting better. When you watch his stream you can see him being chill and positive.
---
He was toxic as shit, probably the most toxic a csgo pro has ever been. But that changed, he was very young back then, still is fairly young but shows an insane level of maturity nowadays.
---
Obviously his point about R6s is more about showing he likes the game than intimating he will actually change Esports, but if he hypothetically did, believe me that'd be a net positive for the Siege scene. 
---
Maestro. Ridiculous as anchor, good guns too. ACS and Baliff for opening up walls. Keratos and ALDA for being an anchor. ALDA may have some spawn peeking potential.
---
Pretty good skill, isn't it?

If I could toss Blitz into a portable wood chipper, I would do it every time I kill one. Which is fucking never.

Tbh PS1 ver was not great. More like... awful? I didn't played N64 ver but from what I have seen it looks like port of original game from PC.
---
HOW DARE YOU BE BAD AT THE GAME.
---
But yeah never understood that, I never fuck with people in the game if they mess up, I fuck with people who team kill or are toxic. I know everyone’s not great because I sucked to, when I am busy with college I start sucking, I’m gonna get horrible as time goes on it’s just part of the deal.

doesn't matter an ace starts from the first kill not when you start shooting...

Hard pill to swallow, your post is awful, unfunny and unoriginal, you shouldn't post here again. 
---
You only have one life so don’t waste it.&lt;3
---
I fucking hate these things I go and try my hardest and someone who is using this says that they are “good at the game” and I suck even though I use a controller and can’t swing around precisely and quickly 
---
well, for some of them its because theyve been nerfed, for some its because they get used not only by good players, but bad players too, so the bad players bring the win delta down, also, never talked about Blitz and Jackal, YOU said those guys, the reason blitz has a lower pick rate is because if you do anything besides *run in and melee anyone you see* you lose, if theres a lesion (who is picked quite often and a top tier defender) you are at a disadvantage, basically, the reason Blitz has a lower pick rate is because he has a decent amount of counters, Jackal IMO is super balanced compared to the other people you mentioned, the only reason hes considered 'meta' is because the most broken ops in the game have tracking abilities, and he also has a tracking ability, IMO hes the most balanced tracker in the game, so he doesnt deserve to even be mentioned here IMO
---
When i was saying "these guys are meta" i was trying to say that when they were released they introduced a super broken meta, since that meta hasnt been properly toned down by the devs yet, we still get teams that use the broke abilities
---
It wouldn't be on the wrong side if the players were shifted one to the right and the goalie was added back in
---
Nah lol

i'm pretty i plaeyed back to back matches against cheaters... in both cases they had qNg as part of their name, not the same person though. First match was quite hilarious. Two rounds in, we were winning 2-0, and they had 0 total kills for the entire team. then they suddenly got good and killed us all in 30sec.. prefires, wallbangs, whole shebang... then they are bad again...  But managed to win, montagne planting on the desk vs pulse ftw while 4v5. 
---
The other match... no chance.  one tap to the head while jumping in... on top of that killcam glitch, so can't even spectate..
---
Earlier as well had a teammate who was cheating.. got removed mid match... His buddy claimed he's coming back. Pretty sure was being boosted. 
---
So yeah, definite increase in cheaters. And I don't get. How hard it is to patch the game against cheaters? Buy some cheats, identify what they exploit and fix...  Run some heuristics to identify cheaters? There's ton of statistics that betray cheaters. If you gonna do live services gonna, you need to deliver on that good service...
---
really nice
---
I started playing this game around 3 months ago and the tks were the reason i started maining sheilds,  now im lvl 114 with both my accs combined and i try to help new players as much as possible. My best tip is to get good at terrorist hunt lone wolf, then casual. (bad grammar ik mobile)
---
It’s pretty much on luck I can say..... 
---
I'm pretty new, and suck even for my level. I stated this at the start of a casual match and immediately got a 3/4 vote to kick me. Luckily there was one guy that was nice, but still. Didn't even wait to start playing.
---
Keep crying no name!
---
"So help me, so help me, and cut!"
---
It's a bug since Burnt Horizon, the skin worked fine when it was released.
---
Learn to live with it? I can't even play it right now because they can't get their shit together. I understand a lot of the bugs that happen, hell I play it every day and still enjoy it. But when I download an update and it crashes it to the point that I have to re download the entire game, I think they have some fixing to do. And maybe, just maybe if enough people complain they will do something about it.
---
Nope. Just a photoshopped image of the new Cyclops headgear for Smoke. 
---
It’s pretty much on luck.....
---
Woow
---
It’s pretty much on luck..... 
---
Imagine you're droning and you get out of it to be stared to by the all powerful Mike Wasowski
---
Gives me BF3 vibes. That sweet map on rush where you got to jump down off the base and free fall with helicopters flying past you. Good times. Great job!
---
I’m a febuary noob that got the starter edition with all ten ops for ten bucks. And I’ve died a couple times from an acog Aiming through a millimeter doorway or tiny window hole. Good angle and all but shit is so wack 😂
---
Here’s Johnny ! 
---
"I don't mean to shit on" \*Proceeds to shit on\*
---
You have to install it under downloads or DLC.
---
Imo Uplay is just a better platform. And if you use a controller you will be laughed at and shit on
---
Looks great but couldn’t you have picked *any* other location on this map that is more interesting? lol
---
giving me those Damavand Peak feelings!
---
Your argument would be valid if the Win Delta stats weren’t based only on High Plat/ Diamond Ranked matches. These are arguably the best players in the world showing a consistent trend of a less than positive Win Delta. I think that means it’s not meta. I will 100% agree that it’s toxic and unfun to play against though. 
---
Really nice
---
this is not even head gear he is Mike lol
---
Why? There is such a minimal difference between this and the yellow universal skin. Why is this a legendary?
---
Damn dude why dont you shit one out then. Just because something is simple doesnt mean it isn't good. Learn to appreciate things more, some positivity would do you well.
---
Turn up the volume! 
---
ew
---
They do... on your team :(
---
Reeeeeeeee
---
Those stairs that scream "WELCOME MAT"
---
Don’t understand why you felt the need to post this
---
No jager defender lose against Ying
---
The guy is bait, they're waiting Hibby to save him.
---
Same here, one of the best cards I have ever bought.
---
Even R6S ran fine until Ubisoft pushed a random small update almost two months ago.
---
“kind of organic” lmao
---
Hey, bro. Using the “r” word isn’t cool, if even in jest. 
---
I've seen this posted more in two weeks than I have whacked off in 2 years. 
---
Technically, she didn’t **lose** ACOG. There is no reason for reunion.
---
wow this is so nice, I wish i have this
---
nope, i havent bought anything
---
Hire this man. 
---
No, i play on a standard monitor
---
[removed]
---
Bro dead ass. My friend sent it to me so o thought nobody else posted it lol. My bad
---
She lost it on the only useful weopon 😂😂
---
People don’t even talk about the real issue here. There are more mnk player on PC than ever before and it needs to be addressed. /s
---
I see Jäger is planning to endulge in some vodka
---
You just have them?
---
Isn't Cloud Haven just Wind Bastion?
---
It is time to invent a controller that does really well on fps games
---
I demand more!
---
Yep. Feel like the whole earth is against us huh?
---
With a tinier head hitbox for Ash :^)
---
Have tou never seen an official UBI ban wave go scrolling across your screen for 10 minutes? At what, 45 million players now? They could care less about bans
---
I would love to have this as a poster or even framed
---
Mozzie 100%
---
We can't see a wide shot but I really hope they turn her in Salma Hayek with her elitè skin.
---
I lost two of my buddies as they hated the direction R6 was going. Are we talking about the faster pace? 
---
Literally every game now we have aggressive defense run-outs.
---
I wish they'd bring in a Tactical Simulation playlist with instant death for any defenders exiting the building.
---
I've been playing since launch and I shouldn't get wiped out every round by a twitchy COD player, the game shouldn't reward cheese strategies. I want slow Siege back.
---
It's one of the levels names "Oregon"
---
It's the bomb site basement. 
---
You won't get always tked if you aren't with friends... Also if you run up to trio tkers just record the whole thing and send it to ubi... 
---
Can't be seen by drones if you own the drones

you literally hit her shoulder. open your eyes and slow the video down mate
---
alright, you don’t need to be a dick about it though. please stop being entitled and just listen to what he was saying. we enjoy this type of stuff, and if he put effort into it or not, who cares. it’s still awesome 
---
What's your name and platform? 
---
 Maybe I'm just running in to some mean people
---
I'd definitely switch to this!
---
I do this all the time. Its very frustrating. We need to be able to change controls completely on XBOX if its an option for Ubisoft.
---
Oh
---
Sledding time
---
Why are there so many legendarys was the whole 40gb all legendary skins 
---
Yeah.
---
 Doesn't help, I always re-queue for a match every 2 minutes for any matchmaking. 
---
PC and i have 2 acc. SageCp and ProxyCP
---
record, report to ubisoft
---
Not hackers, just kids using (paid) booting services.
---
Mozzie has gun which is pretty much Vigil's gun but the gadget is definitely a lot more useful for you and the team. Plus a good shotgun which is surprising good as a main weapon.
---
Nvm I verified and repaired my files and now it's working. 
---
 Yeah, people see team killing as the solution to everything, it bugs me. 
---
Expanding brain
---
lmao, i'm not disagreeing that doc is just patently better rn. But why should rook be that much less viable?  Feels exceptionally unwarranted.
---
right, so make a youtube vid where you recreate this in 5 minutes.
---
This may look easy but it takes longer than you expect.
---
It might be just me, I'm not sure. 
---
Never heard anyone over here call a Maori a Mozzie. 
---
Zofias year 2 i think 
---
You clearly didn’t notice the banana barrel sir. 
---
Ohh hopefully I can get a link! Thank you for the response!!
---
Noice :)
---
wheres the laundry on the counter?
---
1v5 down to a 1v1, 2000 ping, welp fuck me
---
Talking shit mate, it's very well documented that MnK gives an insane advantage over controller users, and Ubisoft consider it cheating themselves. 
---
I second this as British. Mozzie is the slang for a mosquito referring to his small stature and pests gadget. 
---
I know, not gonna lie, I was really disappointed 
---
Oh fair enough
---
This would be awesome for some swiss operators especially if i get to make a Swiss cheese pun
---
Dear idiot, it's not cheating until Ubisoft clearly says it is and adds it into their rules, with Microsoft backing them.
---
They haven't done that yet so if you can't beat em, join em. But imagine playing a competitive FPS on console, yikes.
---
Dear console players. Stop crying and buy a gaming PC then everyone will be on level playing field. 
---
FBI's watch list, some countries might be harder to get in

I'm new to this whole thing, please cut me some slack

---
You have SPQR, that is all you need
---
Deus Vult!
---
Those who use it know they are shit both at PC and Console, only way to achieve a high rank would be to abuse it like that! pathetic fucks  really. 
---
Thought this was r/shittyrainbow6 for a second there.
---
That made me laugh, very nice indeed, good Rook
---
Seems like a hack to me
---
Cancel the search and search for a new match again. It works, trust me. I always cancel after 4min
---
OP
---
Open 56 pack’s and had only this one
---
Ubisoft umm excuse me? Can you hire him please? Thx xoxo. 
---
Creeper in R6
---
Be with a 5 man as much as possible. Protect your flanks and protect your teammates flanks. Don’t do dumbshit in rank.  And don’t be a roamed unless you know the map, map knowledge is key to winning a game
---
No.
---
This has been discussed COUNTLESS times before, and a quick scan through the sub would have told you that EVERY TIME this has been asked, the majority has disagreed (except the first time, but even then, the samr conclusion was eventually reached), because vigil is fine and needs no changes.
---
And lion in his upcoming update is fine. Pros agreed to it as well. Let's not suggest changes until we test upcoming changes, shall we? Even then, it wouldn't be needed to do so.
---
Or just retarded by the looks of it lmao
---
MORE!!! This is awesome!
---
Both
---
I remember doing the 3rd one in my first ever match lol, my teammates were pretty chill so they didn't tk me lol
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
He‘s all the way up!
---
Ash mains learning this just now.
---
Cool
---
no 
---
That's hot. Perfect for pulse.
---
Beet
---
no
---
he wouldn't have much use for his speed though, his gadget would still be stationary anyways, and also the devs said they are working on his rework already, so maybe later on his turret becomes a portable minigun, who knows, anything could happen just to keep the lord happy lol.

---
What an incredibly stupid thing to say. 
---
I've stopped playing on console even though it's my main account and I've been playing since the frist week the game got released. It's really obvious when someone is using mnk. 
---
Sonic blast now decapitates u
---
He abandons matches he is going to lose, last season he played 1033 ranked matches, Won 471, Lost 0 and abandoned 562 of them (leave the match before the match is over)
---
Tell it to Pulse 
---
His head looks massive and it's not a nice headgear.
---
I mean I have an account on ps4 as well 600+ no real toxicity experienced of course few tkes but its not much 
---
You definitely can beat MnK users in a straight up gunfight. It depends how good you’ve gotten with your input method, in this case a controller. You can aim good with a controller if you developed a skill with it. 
---
The chances of somebody actually using a MnK on console though is very low. I’ve even seen my friends accuse people of MnK when they weren’t using one. A lot of people mistake high sensitivity or good aim for MnK use. 
---
I won’t lie and say MnK isn’t an advantage because it is, if the person you are going against is good with it. But also keep in mind that playing against people using Scuf controllers or Elite controllers is also going against people with an advantage. Those controllers offer taller sticks to give you more precise aim at higher sensitivities as well as enable you to use the face buttons without ever moving your thumbs from the sticks. 
---
Either way, the player has to get good with whatever he is using, and has to have game sense. No input method whether it be controller or MnK is instant god mode for anyone. 
---
this brings me up a thought, has anyone made sims of r6 yet?
---
23-19!!! We have a 23-19!!!!
---
Toxic babes are in position...
---
Yeah, I personally buy it as I really love the game. But I would still like to get my money's worth. Just getting  to play the new ops 7 days early? I might just hop on the tts. So called "exclusive" cosmetics that are basically just reskins? come on. The only really useful thing we get is the r6 credits.
---
Yeah cheating you out of your money wtf
---
It's so big that I'm lost there 
---
Oh I’m sorry I thought you where op
---
"I like Tachanka"
---
I’m not bragging about being able to code? I’m telling you I have experience and I know what I’m talking about. Ubisoft servers are shit, they have almost no security and constantly go down. But I’m not saying it’s injected at all? It’s totally possible for you to run code into online only servers with the right software. Sandboxie allows software to modify other software without it rejecting(easily) it.
---
I like how its 3iq not 0 and not 1 XD
---
Actually novices are dangerous part is so true. Sometimes new players can camp to very very stupit positions and when i die just think " how stupit can you be, you should be brainless if you really camp there ", but overall he killed me and thats the point, if he camp more professionally i would kill him because i know spots. Sometimes its really hard to play against new players if you experinced so much for them because you dont expect them to act like stupit, you though every of them are professionals.
---
I got 3 black ice in wind bastion. Mp5K, UMP45 and 552 commando 
---
Nah I stole it
---
Right?! The likeness is uncanny!
---
Lord Tachanka would probably cause an avalanche with all that screaming 
---
Nice job
---
It might have something to do with the special event for this season shown in the roadmap [rainbow six roadmap](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-au/game-info/seasonpass.aspx) 
---
Event day maybe
---
as  someone who grew up on a PC and MnK is my bread and butter... I am discouraged from buying a console because the controller is just so unnatural to me.
---
It is perfect for 3rd person games, racing, platformers etc but any FPS game... nah. Tried Doom on my friend's PS4 when I was considering buying one and ditching PC until I realised that playing on console would bar me from my two most favourite genres - RTS and FPS. So I stick with PC until there is fair matchmaking and support for MnK on consoles. 
---
I felt like I was being a bit rude, but honestly I legit don't have any ideas to make something different that is still interesting.
---
If you like uploading then great, maybe you will think of things you may see as interesting, and it may catch other people's attention.
---
At this point, they should just do the promised armour class rework, so reducing armour is no longer considered a nerf.
---
I know apparently this post was made before I’m sorry I didn’t know .
---
Yeah but what about Mozzie in the prep phase taking their drones though? he can at least get one of their drones 
---
There is no goalie on the green team only the second position that is the problem

Does every op need a direct counter? I mean thatcher has gone thia far with not having one
---
Can you make more of these pls
---
For me it is way more satisfying and fun to actually kill what I am shooting at, and to do so with a Deagle is all that much more meaty and satisfying to pull off.
---
So unlike old recoil which made me dread running out of primary ammo, I can at least now sort of rely on the sidearm AND feel good for using it.
---
Flat out upgrade to both usability and fun.

I was dissappointed when echo didnt have one

Exactly.

Omg 500 packs , I opened 250 from Jan to now playing and farming, took 2 1/2 months to get 1 million renown...2 of the 50 pack blocks were bad, I felt violated, one block of 50 was absolute fire and the other 2 blocks of fifty were more good then bad and from what I can see I was pretty lucky. 
---
Something I highly advise you do, I want you to look at the bottom of your screen, near your compass, where it tells you what room you're in. I want you to do this, EVERY time, for EVERY room, until you automatically know what room you're in. You don't have to consciously think about it, or where you are, if that's too much effort/ too boring, but when you play with others, and some guy yells a location, you will automatically know which room they are talking about, instead of going 
---
"Which room is that again." Seconds are crucial.
---
Hm..... ok you make a fair point that I cannot comeback to. Your point wins.
---
i play with a mate, and we are ok most of the time. we have enough firepower to take out 1 TK dickhead, and end up playing a lot of 2vXs too.

---
Only problem with playing with other players around your clearance level is that;
---
1. It will make smurfs even even more of a problem.
---
2. It will slow down the learning process of new players because they are less likely to play with experienced players, therefore less likely to learn off watching them and talking to them.
---
This could put some new players off. 
---
I swear to god ever since the buff In damage for her gun she has been very op for me. She is so underrated and the most powerful operator in the game if there is not a Jäger or you get ads’s.
---
this is dumb, and it's dumb Macie even said that. yeah no shit they're going to continue after year 4
---
Never saw this charm in game I guess its rare af now im more happy 😆

Make sure youre connected to the internet on your device. Restart the game and uPlay.

Vigil gadget makes hom invisible to noob players, and Lion drone is not a noob. This was explained on overwatch last patch notes. 
---
INB4 the next generation of consoles support M-KB natively, and this whole unfair advantage issue is out the window.
---
Sure it sucks right now as a console fps player to be stuck with pieces of shit that spend $80 for an (arguably) unfair advantage. But what can you do really? Or anyone for that matter other than the shits spending money on this. Don't pin me on this but i wouldn't be surprised if the console itself treats it like any other 3rd party controller, how's M$ or ubi going to differentiate what is or is not allowed to connect to the console?
---
i agree, most of them aren't bright enough to look at the upsides of a pc, over a console. if they have both, or at least experienced both, and enjoy couch gaming, than it's cool. but if they think that xbox is a better platform to game on (graphics, community, price, ect.) they are just plain wrong
---
Of course this comes from the Thatcher main.
---
The best strategy is to know that randoms don't care about strats. 
---
If a random is a thermite, go hibana
---
Random thatcher? Go twitch
---
If you need something done, do it yourself. That way when your randoms run off on their own, you still have the base covered.
---
Imagine fuze destroying the bomb and losing the match
---
Mozzie’s Comando 9: 36 damage, 750 fire rate, 25 round mag. 
---
Vigil’s K1A: 36 damage, 720 fire rate, 30 round mag. 
---
They both have similar and extremely low recoil. 
---
Mozzie wins here. His DPS is decently higher. Unless -5 bullets is a big deal to you. 
---
Mozzie is 2 speed, Vigil is 3 speed. 3 speeds dominate the meta, so Vigil wins here. 
---
Vigil can take away intel from attackers, why Mozzie can take away AND use the intel from the attackers. “He’s basically the Caveira of drones”, as Macie Jay says. One small mistake from the attackers can fuck over their whole team. Mozzie definitely wins here. 
---
Vigil has SMG secondaries, while Mozzie has a shotgun for breaching walls that also can kill people very consistently compared to the other secondary shotguns because it has a much better damage at range compared to them. It’s similar to Smoke’s shotgun with slightly less damage and only a 3 bullet capacity. I say Mozzie wins here because he has more utility and it gives him a more versatile loadout. You can run a shotgun and SMG at the same time, so he’s comparable to another Smoke in that way. 
---
Vigil can have impacts or a bulletproof cam. Mozzie can have a nitro or barbed wire. Nitros are obviously one of the strongest secondary gadgets, and Mozzie can get that AND cams at the same time, so Mozzie wins here. 
---
TL;DR: Unless being a 3 speed is a huge deal for you, Mozzie wins in every way. 
---
If they support it you will be against mnk players and also the support doesn't detect adapters so you can still be against controllers with it 
---
Spoiler alert: they reinforced it but removed the walls from the picture so we can't see the reinforcements.
---
That Calendar is on all Maps.
---
The E.D 14th April is related to the *Extra Day* of the Alpha Tests Phase.

Alpha Tests were till the 13th April 2015, because of the overwhelming reaction from Players they decided to give us one more Day (the 14.04.2015).

It has nothing to do with any Season releases or Events how other People always write under these Calendar Posts even when they dont know it.

It’s Hibana, I heard it yesterday

I've gotten some bad bounces is probably why they hate them and/or me using them

Tater
---
Yes, it's new and a pretty diappointing skin for a legendary.
---
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY TELLING ME that you did all that work but forgot to put in the infamous washing machine of indestructibility 
---
It’s available to buy with renown but it’s a really good one and evoensive
---
You can’t nut me when I’m already nutted 
---
The majority don't know the lore of the game. Most of us just hit multiplayer and play.
---
They didn't rework it, they made a new map. I honestly had no idea that it was the same place when I came back to siege.
---
Nigga
---
Theres no reason to argue about this topic it's a waste of time
---
Yet
---
Debatable since the G36C has an Acog and an angle grip
---
Sadly not, we weren’t granted two they teammates and they rushed us hard.
---
Well you're on reddit 
---
I get that but still
---
Oh sorry didnt see that. 
---
This could be for the Mexican and Peruvian operators a military base on de andes this could be a good operation.
---
please tell me your using an elite controller and not MnK lol
---
Unless you use fullscreen the game will only run at 60hz, even if your settings say 144hz. 
---
Some pro players found out they have been playing on 60hz their whole career just a month or so ago, its quite annoying really. 
---
Can you make a fbi open up animation 
---
This is as bad as the gator skin i have for them. Worst part is the new gator skin looks better than the 'legendary'
---
These elites are no bueno

well people can be dumb sometimes XD

I don't know why you have the urge to call everyone a neckbeard... But sure, whatever floats your boat.

I've encountered cheaters many times and I've seen a lot of them get banned. I actually have videos and screenshots of that.

But the r4c has not dps and higher fire rate and ash is a rushing operator so holo or reflex is still good
---
I completely agree, she’s easily one of the best characters in the game.
---
Well you don't have to be a dick about it
---
I'm lazy and i use reddit on my phone so...
---
quit complaining 
---
It looks so cool
---
signed. same here
---
I'm sorry to inform you but were have to tack an extra 5 seconds onto this ace for the following 2  reasons
---
Use of full ammo clip of an lmg without acog
---
Up against opponents who never stood a chance
---
Sorry for the mild inconvenience 
---
(Actually love the ace btw nice job)
---
i did this to myself the other day, i was about to clutch a 5v1 as buck and i cooked it to long while in the OBJ and yeah...
---
What about Saladin?
---
Huh, your account isn’t showing up when I search your new name, and it doesn’t show up when I search your old name. 
---
What is your Uplay identifier name? (The long line of numbers &amp; letters of the file you use for game settings)
---
What I'm saying is that we should still be able to play in custom or casual the old maps
---
Old but gold
---
What do you mean, this is the coolest legendary. Now u are banana man!
---
This is not a flick. You turned on him nerd get it right.
---
That mask is fly 
---
Nope that cant be santioned because that'll change the fundamentals if the game
---
Yes
---
yes please.

PvE Mode 
---
I’m a console player
---
good idea
---
starts playing russian anthem 
---
Nice, that’s amazingly good for the cost
---
All we need is Khalid
---
I know, she just looks like a tango dancer.
---
Me: *Presses Skip* R6: Whoa chill there son
---
Your right, I was disappointed to say the least 
---
I suppose I misinterpreted the “beep every few seconds” as literally every 2 seconds. My apologies. I just don’t want to see a Nomad nerf that renders her useless. And combining any amount of nerfs would be too much. Especially a trigger delay or periods of inactivity. 
---
F MEGA
---
Hey man I’m sorry I’m not original enough for you. I made this myself in iMovie but i acknowledge that it’s not the hardest meme to come up with and others have definitely thought of it on their own too.
---
In finnish this would mean music banana.
---
Whenever I see 4:3 stretched I feel like I'm watching a gameplay from the early 2000s or before
---
I assume it was someone saying $150 isn’t cheap. To be fair for the price that guy did great, I’ve put about $800 into mine.
---
It looks great! Also w g e never I see child's bedroom it reminds be of when I was low level and used to anchor in child's....never worked

Synthetic

Strange... the voice doesn't sound like any of the operators we already have in the game.
---
Also, the mid-season event will most likely only be a modified map or mode, as we have seen with the Mad House event.
---
Under normal circumstances, we wouldn't have done this. He started it as a joke, and I guess we all followed through.
---
understandable
---
If you’re referring to older seasonal skins than you can’t add them to any weapon that was released after that season. 
---
This is probably the one skin i regret getting
---

A good pair of headphones and being aware will do the trick, nice!

Wait what? It is? Never knew that thank you, always wanted to get into voxel

UNPLAYABLE
---
I think the Vigil cosplay is the best here if I'm being honest. The guy really nailed the ERC-7.
---
Can someone make the entire house already please?
---
Yeah for me, I sometimes hop on cod with my mates and the guns genuinely feel hollow, no kick or nothing, like I'm firing polystyrene out them. Super easy to control.
---
Then I hop back on Siege and I can't aim for shit for the first couple games. 
---
Alot of people do because they assume the person who shot them will push giving the defender a positional advantage
---
Ur aim
---
Lol I expected to die but they decided to not shoot me
---
level was never taken into account
---
Rappelling is already heavily punished, you can be seen without seeing inside, people can hear and see your rope, they just made it clunkier and less enticing with the change.
---
I think that jäger being a counter would be too harsh on gridlock. Maybe making it so mute is a counter and if she throws her trap things ( forgot what they’re called ) in the area of the mute jammer it stops it from activating and then she can either pick it up and throw it somewhere else or shoot the mute jammer. Just my opinion tho, over the year Ubisoft will change the ops so she may get a change at some point and they may find a better way to counter her :)
---
MSI Afterburner and RivaTuner, there are multiple video on how to get it setup on youtube.
---
Filthy repost from r/shittyrainbow6. This is some r/karmacourt case.
---
My first thought too. The fact that there's no rotations between the 2 sites was bewildering.
---
Hello Pryingtugboat85, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b1gvar/barricade_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So, there's a smurf, and EVERYONE is having a connection issue.  Sounds like a normal server issue to me.  Oh, and there's a smurf.
---
With this project it took approximately a three days from start to finish if I'm correct (not quite active working tho lol), but I already had the idea in mind so I just had to visualize it.
---
And thousand thanks mate, made me happy! :)
---
My guess is that if u purchase the game during the event then you will get the charm for the streamer you are currently subbed to. It won’t work if you had subbed in the past. 
---
I have seen lvl 150 players on console that played worse than a bronze
---
He still got downed when we were setting it up 😂
---
I need you to calm down
---
Nice! Good ace!  Though watching you fight that Clash was driving me crazy. :)
---
He cant help but lean spam
---
Guns in apex have practically no recoil whatsoever so after switching to siege from that you may need some catching up on recoil control 
---
Okay, you would know if you were here with us. Because this guy is boosting his friend by interfering with servers? This is a common thing on console, where you’re 3-0 in ranked and the enemy team boots the server. 
---
It's not funny. 
---
If you have read the other comments I have said many times you can call him a bomber I won't force anything on you but the fact is he's a breather whit all due respect to the tachanka main
---
How did you make this?
---
Thanks man, got the deluxe version!
---
2 paths if you've got the balls and the speed
---
Not 50, but maybe 30 or 35
---
Can someone tell me whats going on
---
“Favelas and the Boat” lol, confirmed 1000 hours😂
---
It's great dont get me wrong, but you didnt quite capture my rage when a teammate reinforces the wrong side of the wall so I can't place my black mirror from inside the storage closet. Other than that 10/10 amazing!
---
I think the only change Nomad really needs is giving her traps a buzz noise similar to mutes jammers when you're near it. The activation and deactivation idea you suggest kind of ruins the operator. What other op has a 50% chance of their gadget not working? Her airjab is already bright yellow and can't be used in combat because of its timed delay activation. 
---
Finally. That spot was damn hard to deal with.
---
r/onejob tsk tsk
---
I've had times were the servers crap out.  Has been happening a lot since the release of of Burnt Horizon.  If everyone has a abnormally high ping, that's the servers crapping out.
---
#1 mosque royale
---
No wonder I can never hit her head...
---
What is that?
---
Some other people said it but it's true, the clearance level thing will only making smurfing a bigger problem, and this toxicity has basically always been around. You said you are now in the Gold 1 range which is essentially the sweatiest and most toxic range to be in. That's because you have all the little kids who want to be plat but really arent good enough for it so they get their friends who are to carry them, or they just hope that their teammates will. As well this is when you start to see a lot of console players use mnk because they have no sense of morals and feel that it's not cheating and they just act extra toxic. I'm a plat 2 and honestly the worst part of every season is having to wade through the Gold 2 - 1 mess because it's so annoying. I do understand what you are saying though. I have noticed that solo queuing has resulted in seeing these kinds of people more as I soloed a lot last season for the first time and ran into young kids just wanting to be carried and getting mad when they died spawn peeking and left me in 1 v 5s and I only clutched 1 out of 2 of them. I'd say keep your head up and play the game you love, or dont that's up to you. I play xbox though if you wanna squad up, just message me.
---
Or what
---
too soon?
---
I’m not a pc player so I don’t know exactly what to do but has it been uninstalled and if so then just reinstall in. If that’s not the case then restart your game and see if it changes ? Sorry I can’t be of more help
---
Never too soon
---
Everyone’s ping was like 60 below 80% of the game. It wasn’t just a ping issue. It’s that none of us could move or do anything on attack and defense. And I joined the opposite teams party and they were saying the 2 other people on their team were doing it.
---
Probably next week
---
Lion finka thermite thatcher and ash if u have one of those silent fragger kids that only uses ash and rages whenever he gets killed by drops 10 bombs every game.
---
The lowest ping I have ever got is 77. And sometimes the ping gets stuck 260.
---
Now I wanna play as Tachanka in BF1...
---
Can confirm this is absolutely not a common issue on console, certainly not on PS4 anyway.
---
Mute
---
The win rates are from plat/diamond. Not sure what you mean by bad players
---
This was in a plat 2 game lol :) and Yeah i Really panicked at the end and thanks btw
---
Was your drink a grenade?
---
I get trying to be realistic, id like that a lot too but the thing is quick peeking is a stoneage and stupid tactic that makes it esy to shoot your head off since the enemy just needs to suppress the corner youre peeking from which will either result in you getting your head blown off or prevent you from shuffling side to side like an idiot. Which then gives them time to relocate and get a better angle on you for when you decide to put your face in the line of fire again shooting at nothing since the enemy moved and can now easily kill you. I dont quick peek because its stupid and makes me an easy target, but i also dont want a cool down time for leaning because i may get into a gunfight where i have to leaan multiple times and dont want this mechanic to prevent me from doing so.
---
Lol
---
I’m using a website for same sensitivity but it feels weird when I played Apex before R6. Probably recoil management is the biggest issue for me.
---
Clash’s abilities are yelling and dying
---
Happy cake day man :)
---
Die.
---
Trust me I was Going crazy as well :o
---
Which date does Dokkaebis SI charm mention? 
---
Ahhah I know right! Making still scenes is so different compared to 3d spaces, "cheating" the system is so easy in some ways lol
---
It’s what the New Zealand shooter wrote on his gun
---
And what's singing going to do in this situation 
---
Yeah jackal and maverick probably have some of the best weapons in the game other than the r4c and the 416c
---
Yeah, ths servers crapped out.  That's it.  Unless those 2 players were still moving around like normal, there's nothing weird going on.
---
full hd... 240 hz, before the update i had no problems reaching 240 fps but now i struggle to get 150 in buildings
---
The one could push site, but no one else could.
---
Because you own it
---
bet
---
Put it on Kaid for the lulz
---
Hey I have the banana charm its good
---
How did you make this? What program? Please share your secrets 
---
I wish I did, ubisoft is playing with me xd
---
Like I mentioned. This is on console, and this is a COMMON occurrence. This time it just made me a bit more tilted because I’m almost diamond.
---
Did you get this screen after updating the game?  Or did you just get it randomly?
---
I had a feeling honestly. There were many leaks about an event in April and I hoped it would be the whole rumored nuclear one, but it seems to be april fools instead. Wonder if att &amp; def will swap like all the suggestions asked for though. 
---
It really looks no better.  Ubisoft's art/modeling team for R6 has a serious problem depicting human faces, it's so bad.
---
damn
---
Lmao (laughing my apple off) 😂😂
---
Well, I'd consider it the source since that's where I got my information from. But I don't know, maybe I'm using the context wrong. 
---
I already did it and they do not answer me!
---
oh right ok thank you
---
I don't listen to khalid lol u right 
---
Sledge plus 590 is too fun 
---
With such a cool landscape/map they could insert helicopter as attacker's spawn like in the e3 trailer 2014. Nice work with the engine!
---
patience
---
I'm wasting money 😭
---
Omegalul is that something that special? 
---
Thanks!
---
Mute shouldn't have put his jammer there in the first place if they had a bandit. 
---
And even if the plan was to double up, destroying one of Thermite's Brimstones is a worthwhile trade-off (though should have waited for the impending thatcher (assuming they didn't go Maverick).
---
I do not mind VHS, too, I think it's cool, but you need to, that everything was visible, and then look at the movie is not very nice
---
That sounds really good but it would probably look really silly and would have a weird animation also
---
They need to nerf ads time in general, the game would be slower then for sure.
---
YOUR TARING THIS FAMILY APART

He's so angry about it.

Take my downvote, weeb, your a loser smurf.

/r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow PSAs because of repetitive abuses.

Choose a different title and re-submit your post. Thank you.
---
I was thinking one of two things
---
Split the shield health into three parts. So that if they were being shot from the right, they wouldn’t be as vulnerable from the left
---
Make it semi portable or attach to things like deplorable shields or bars
---
Pretty amusing - fine by me for an April fools event.
---
Thanks for the positive attitude man, but I doubt it :,(
---
She’s cleaning it
---
SPIN THE WHEEL
---
Most of us aren't good enough to need to emulate the pros.  
---
Then the aspect ratio thing is largely a matter of preference anyways - the real benefit is in *changing* your aspect ratio moreso than what you change it to. It forces you to start actively thinking about the mechanical actions you take again, taking your brain off of autopilot.  
---
As for scoring, that's disabled in Pro League matches to prevent people from learning extra info from the points. Turning them off voluntarily is only robbing yourself of information others have, for no real reason.
---
New hibana actually looks Asian now. Old hibana looks like a horse. 
---
It’s more Like looking at what you just jerked off to 
---
It could be for a flamethrower op
---
Me and my team have all had a solid 9 ping but sometimes play against a whole team with 100+. Really depends on the day
---
This isn't even a smurf account 
---
i love that map
---
So what do you wanna tell us?
---
To me when ever I see her do that it looks like she’s trying to bend the wrench then gives up
---
Shore
---
A lot of people dislike the diamond skin but I like it I think it looks good with an elite skin op in the winning team showcase 
---
But she is Japanese? She read to me as being from one of the darker Asian skinned nations, such as the Laos, Hmong, etc. I think they went a bit too heavy handed on how much makeup she’s wearing but overall it’s much better imo.
---
Looks dope! What kind of gadget do you think this would go well with? Maybe under-barrel flamethrower? Incendiary grenade launcher like Capitão's but with a massive radius? Special drone?
---
no she’s just so strong she can adjust it anyways
---
It’s a waste, It needs a MAJOR graphics overhaul sadly
---
Yeah they also patched the spot above the reinforcement near the hatch atop Kafe. You can’t shoot through it anymore
---
I was going to comment on the aim then I realized your on console and there isn’t anything you can do
---
Why didn’t Ubi use the actual reticle?
---
RATTLE ME BONES
---
Damn
---
They’ll probably have to make a new animation that he duck and come from below or that the shield flips forwards when no one is on it 
---
“Report for toxic behavior”
---
Otherwise, nothing else.
---
The old one looked more like a real person.
---
The new one looks, off, like uncanny valley off.
---
It will, it just may be better for you to run another op. I would reccomend rook like the others, as his shotgun is actually really good IMO. Nobody ever uses it over the mp5, but it deserves a little more recognition and will allow you to open holes without using impacts.
---
Oh mama
---
I tried to go for my original height which I am a bit shorter than Ying AKA the shortest operator (even shorter than Mozzie)
---
I think this is a solid clip. Getting started is tough for those who want the fame. But if you’re doing it because you enjoy, then you actually have a chance at growing it into something. The only critique I have is, personally I (&amp; most people I play with) only care about bomb. So maybe change your match making settings. Other than that, you’ve got potential!
---
The problem with L. Tachanka now isn't that people are going *around* his visor-shield, they're going *through* it. Because the shield is around the LMG and not him, you can find angles where you can shoot and destroy it without him even seeing you. 
---
While you idea would help in certain situations, I don't think it would help in the majority of cases, because such angles would still be possible.
---
OH FUCK
---
That’s way better than.... you know what fuck this, fuck all of you! Just because I get dog turd gun doesn’t mean I’m any less of a glaz player!! S/
---
WOW!!! dude
---
Now I want bit siege
---
Well thats the thing about fps’. You can’t it be so slow it’s not fun, but you also can’t have it so fast paced that you have no room to think
---
Incoming Mira face rework
---
There's a glitch where the game is connecting you to different servers. Such as living in cus it will connect you to eus. 
---
I actually agree with this a lot. I'd love to see fuze as a 2 speed, bios pick rate would instantly go up. 
---
Worse. And no longer asian
---
I got that and i was so sad because i thought i would at least get a gun skin and i felt lucky because i got the pack on a 5% roll
---
Even if you have MnK you can't lean without aiming on console
---
Definitely a Jager and Bandit main 
---
Sorry but I sided with Drifter 
---
you cant lean without aiming on console
---
Yeah
---
100% not mouse and keyboard 
---
What is happening? I don’t understand
---
Amazing job, it's better than any official startup screen!
---
I am trying to get into Siege after a long life in CS but it simply is not fun when playing alone. My biggest issue is the huge amount of leavers. I think in 80% of my games i end up playing one or two rounds, if not all, with uneven numbers. I've even loaded into 3v5's during placements recently. And what do these people get? 15 minute rank ban and renown penalty. Thats just not okay if you want to be taken seriously as a title. 
---
Aw fuck I forgot to put a water mark on the image, oh well
---
The ideal scenario. All the walls are open 
---
F 
---
Earth Day is on the 22nd
---
Even playing casual gives you a rank... you just can't see it.... if you look on r6 tabs youll see it as a value assigned to "SKILL"
---
How do you guys get the little main things by your name
---
And then the same noobs even put a reinforced shield on the door sometimes which is just laughable
---
there should be a megathread for shitty legendary skins [here’s](https://imgur.com/gallery/hBqjayd one I got a few days ago)

Pull a reverse Monty and put Clash at the door.

How do you do these

---
I don't understand the name. The skin looks like it has printed circuit traces on it. I think "PCB" would've been a more apt name. 
---
As far as i know no, the versions are not interchangeable, i think they even have different download/install sizes
---
Gonna need some more info than that boss. 
---
Disgusting
---
They usually get released a week after world wide release of the season operators, so probably this coming Tuesday/Wednesday.
---
Well, when a guy with a turban crashes 2 planes in a building in the name of Allah, you can state "terrorism" without a doubt, because historically, terrorism has been related with faith-related attacks or acts. I kill you because you don't believe in the same shit I believe in.
---
When a guy writes "turkofaggots" in an assault rifle and kills muslim people in their temple, you have no idea what's going on. It's not necessarily a faith thing. He could be a racist, he could be hatred towards people born in other countries. He could be a neo-nazi. I'm not sure what's the exact definition of terrorism, but I think of it as an act to create terror in a big population. Until you have more certainty on the crime reason, you can call it terrorist, mass murder, or fucked up psycho. Who cares.
---
If you have certainty or some clues that it was a faith-motivated act, I'm sure media would call it terrorism from scratch. I don't think the colour of the person who performs the attack is related with how the attack is considered, at all.
---
If I tell you "Hey Cav is on red stairs flanking you, you can take her out" and you choose to ignore that and get interrogated, don't be surprised if you catch a vote kick.
---
Yeah 😕 seems like most people got it fixed in the last patch so why would ubi fix something that only effects a small amount of people...to make the overall experience better? Nope. Of course not. 
---
Aka me when I 1st started
---
I got it while attacking while playing lion. He doesn’t have breach charges and I just slayed a bandit. 
---
There's an invisible barrier right there, making it impossible to shoot enemies that would be clearly visible in that doorway/hallway
---
Greatest of all time 
---
Guys how can you not understand what he’s saying
---
If there is no communication then mute did right thing and bandit should have waited. If bandit told mute not to and mute then its justified.
---
Who cares if a thermite charge is destroyed. At that point in time Mute was wasting attackers time with out any one dying. which is an extremely valuable thing to do.
---
This is how all my terrorist hunts are
---
Echo and lesion are fun and are good anchors
---
You're a good player but you need to be a lot better if you want to get big as a gameplay channel.
---
Uplay has two sizes. One with graphics package. About 20GB difference. I did do the larger file, the smaller file is about the same size as the steam file. But I doubt they will still work. Guess I'll just have to have both files... 
---
&gt;We have not enabled keyboard and mouse use on the console version of the game. If someone is using them, they are circumventing the approved usage outlined by Microsoft and Sony. I recommend reporting them to Microsoft and Sony so that they can take action.
---
This is what one of the devs said on a forum post about kbms. They essentially admit that they can't do anything about it, and using a kbm adapter doesn't circumvent Sony's rules as they endorse it. (I dunno about MS)
---
They also admit that they can natively support kbms, which would literally be the best thing for this game, but for some reason they choose not to. 
---
Worked just fine for me last night, you got a clip or anything?
---
Noass Nomad
---
When you get higher in ranks, like mid gold, the toxicity will calm down. Just the lower ranks where  people are salty and can't rank up they get toxic.
---
Toxicity in a videogame leads to toxicity in a videogame. It doesn't lead to IRL killing. No one welcomes alt-right shooters in their communities. Ubisoft has more than 20 millons playing this game. They can't go one by one. Toxicity systems are in place but you can call yourself B3nn\_Shapirou and it will never caught you. And you can't expect Ubisoft to delete B3nn\_Shapirou or H4111l\_H1i1i1TLLLLL333RRR. That doesn't mean Ubisoft is doing things bad. Again, do not blame the platform. Blame the assaulter. Blame their parents. Blame their friends. Blame him specifically. You can't blame a videogame. Gyms will also allow those pyschos to lift the same barbwells than you. That doesn't mean gyms suck or welcome those people with open arms
---
Maybe this game is just not for you.

r/rimjob_steve
---
not to me personally but to my friend so many times

guy on the far right is the new attacker
---
Yeah but I checked the place my server was in the menu and its always weu, the best place ping wise, does it change when I enter a match?
---
We should get it for few just for getting our hopes up
---
I was gonna say nice until you started t-bagging. Shame
---
Love my 1 speeds so I’m against Fuze being a 2 speed. Plus, his shield is not useless at all as it pairs well with the powerful PMM. It gives him the utility to tank against nitro/impacts or be a distraction. Also, it gives a body protection when fuzing if someone tried to rush behind you assuming the player hits most of his shots on the shield while spraying. 
---
Not that bad, but I dont think it fit the game. The old one looked more like you would expect a soldier to look like, while the new one looks too "pretty and cartoon-y"
---
Yeah this. She looks like a K-Pop star now. I thought she looked realistic before. Now she looks cartoonish.
---
That being said, she looks fucking dope in elite.
---
I think its time you take a break from rainbow six and try to find a new game you’ll enjoy. Sounds like to me that you’ve played r6 for quite some time. 
---
Oh, it was 8 bucks for me with the year 4 discount. So its probably just 10. 
---
Do u have a video of it? 
---
DOO DOOT

Ying because she has her candellas and on the defense side they're quite annoying

On Uplay itself or on other websites ?

At least this happened in casual. It’s way worse if this happens in ranked when you actually care about winning.
---
Yea and "hot" is what shows up on my newsfeed. Based on the comment sections of those posts I know I am not the only one who would rather not have it clutter up my news feed. 
---
I thought about making a joke in the description. Thanks for doing it for me 👍
---
Then don’t set the notification to hot?
---
I thought it was a mouth until I notice it actually a mustache.
---
Doc&gt;Jesus 
---
i would , got many cool stuff on ops i dont use , but i also own that one too ;)
---
My boss just walked by, thanks for marking this NSFW, you saved me from getting fired

I mean this wouldn't be the first time an operator got reworked

I don't have to make my own fun in this game. I just thoroughly enjoy it. I like the fun text chat I can have with randoms, I like the banter I have with my friends, and I enjoy the high learning curve and trying to get better. The fights require precise aiming or you're dead, which I also like. I like the wait of determining what your opponent will do and where. If you don't like the game anymore, it's time to find something else just like other games. Every game eventually gets old and you need to find something else. Sounds like you played a lot and got a lot of good hours out of it. Time to just move on. 
---
Yeah but nobody else wants a full rework just maybe a buff at the least
---
This is great
---
Not to sound ignorant but,mid gold? Sorry I just unlocked Rank play, I think my son is around lvl 50. Idk man. I feel like I'm starting to sound like I'm complaining to much. After all it's just a game right?
---
Damn, finishing placements in casual? Sick 
---
Yeah kind of like EA at this point.
---
Yeah somehow 
---
Don't sit still and hold an angle. They changed the camera position so it doesn't show what your character is actually doing. You need to keep moving this season if you want to live. Otherwise, part of your body shows around corners when you think you're safe
---
Cringe
---
The best thing to do with him is place the cam high so you have full coverage of the room. This also protects from some direct fire and uncooked nades.
---
When firing the laser and the enemy starts to loom at your cam and shoot, manually turn the cam away as the lens closes. It blocks the bullets.
---
You can place the two cams to look at each other. Pester them with one cam and switch to cam 2 when they are focused on cam 1.
---
Trying to get a few friends into it but for the moment I'm not having much luck :/
---
Ey oh howvdo you get the blue main tag next to your name? 
---
How is this casual if literally all the ten matches I played yesterday were all Ranked? And the two matches before this one were also ranked and that I clicked keep playing as team in those ranked matches.
---
Seem like a cheap way to get karma
---
Yes but you said he shouldn't anchor. I'm saying he *can* shallow roam, but that isn't his best utility. I'm saying his best utility is as a anchor, rarely leaving objective
---
I feel like they make OP operators for people who are new to this game so they get an advantage. Which is annoying for people who have been playing for awhile and they just get killed from someone who doesn’t even know how to play the game and they just have the OP operator.
---
unless ubisoft removes this kind of things and I lose my 100 destroyed barbed wire points
---
Lol I use this app like once a month don’t rlly care about my karma honestly barely even know what it is don’t know why you’re still typing I’m done replying to some random guy online that’s not worth my time have a lonely day :)
---
It was totally petty ngl
---
Yeah hit boxes are hella messed up this season, got killed like this 3 or 4 times and I've only played 10ish games. 
---
Bye, have fun looking for things to repost.
---
how to farm karma 101

I love when people only know one spawn peak
---
Thanks for reposting this for the 20th time.
---
Just accept it
---
Solid advice thanks man, out of those probs need some stats under my belt and can work on my aim. It's decent but can always be improved oh and map knowledge. Much better from when I first started but still not there yet. Do you recommend playing casual till I know the maps or just sit down on a custom game or something and learn em?

I really do hate that man 
---
Yea, I have the same issue with my aim... there is trick to it tho... never aim for enemy.
---
"nice one tap" ... "yea... that was meant to be a warning shot" 
---
"How the hell did you hit that pixel headshot?!" ... "well... I was aiming at cam on the other side of corridor and ... bullet bounced... hitting the guy in face... he probably thought it was peekers advantage but... I shot around the corner... damn he must be mad as hell after watching kill cam"
---
This looks amazing!

Win? Nah take a break next time find some people to queue with. Solo queue if full of complete self righteous fuckwits.

There is no reason to be hostile, I’m not a try hard but I fucking hate joining games in progress, this stops that

I can understand that, that was Hereford's biggest downside. I just think the new Hereford is way too big, and less interesting to play on in a lot of cases.
---
On console it’s your vertical/horizontal sens that’s your “hip fire” or un ads sens. Your ads sens has its own section

Yeah definitely. EU’s full of very toxic Italians and Arabic players too. I have to say, both servers are toxic. There’s toxicity everywhere.

Throw out everything you know from other shooters and pick a couple of basic ops as an introduction. I’d say go ash or thermite and doc or room till you get the feel for it

You didn't. The glitch was shit.  Never said it wasn't. From.my viewing it looked like you should have been watching to see the points for the charge and u didn't  see them; at that point u should go o shit and run for cover.
---
  I realize you assumed you got it. Which is fair I would assume the same thing. I of course never play bandit so I'm talking out my ass as usual.

Hey look a perfectly good lunch box.

But Kapkan would get one too and ubi said they would give one to any non 3 armor defenders

Not sure but she's just fast since you'll usually be using her pistol

Another subreddit that's going to be conquered by u/SrGrafo memes?

Why focus on ops gender? Better prioritise at their gadget and weapons first. Youtube spotlights exist.
---
So u saying Asians have Down’s syndrome?
---
I doubt you care anymore but it was on Border and I killed him from the classic runout where you blow open the wall downstairs and run out to valley and the one where you hit a hole in the wall upstairs and look out onto the air conditioning thing.
---
Start with terrorist hunt classic mode. This way you can build knowledge about the layout. 
---
Make call outs. In the call outs, say who, what direction it came from, and anything that stands out. For example, Jager, SW 1st floor, left hallway. Practice making them quick and on the fly. If you dont know the character, just say 1 ( or x number depending on what you see). If you dont know the room name, say the direction and describe the room. For example, N.E. blue hallway right side of the door.
---
Ask for clarification. If a teammate say,"he is over there", ask where again. Who the hell knows where over there is. For example:
---
Teammate dies
---
You ask, "Where was he?"
---
Teammate, "oh he is there by the door"
---
You ask, "What direction" or "Where relative to (insert your character)?
---
Plasma Pink &gt; Diamond
---
I have a job but I dont think the operators are worth that much money, especially since I already payed $60 dollars for the game
---
The LMG. Look at the stats on that behemoth! Why wouldn’t you take it?
---
Its becoming to mainstream
---
What if they’re just playing with friends, like I was plat 3 last season and when I’d play with my friends who aren’t as good, the lobby would look just like this. Am I just supposed to not play or something 
---
Sorry for my whole 2 hours on blitz, my bad dude,
---
You have obviously seen like 1 asian girl who looked like old hibana and thinks every asian looks like that
---
Well then, how’d you manage that?
---
This would be cool in the Himalayas, if they ever did Chinese CTUs or the Indian one 
---
It happened to me to(ps4) it was jaegers birthday challenge, and I went mute and got way more than 20 drones, and I made sure the challenge was activated. Pretty annoyed.
---
r/wooosh
---
Yeah it’s unfortunate. My buddy and I bounced around more ideas like in the 1st two rounds if a teammate leaves you won’t be penalized, but after you still will. 
---
happend to me too, but i was the only one instead of 3 just a 1v5 . lol
---
Woman, but she dummy T H I C C
---
That was actually really good advice my man... I certainly will take this into account when playing...Thank you!

All these meme videos are the same with meme music played over someone getting kills while it plays sounds from other games I don’t get why it’s so popular

He’s a Delta Force Operator, so as American as Chris Kyle and Apple Pie
---
New Hibana is a change much needed, I was shocked when it popped up in the patch notes! looks amazing.
---
Broke ass
---
I was 1 match away from silver and I got 2 games in a row with these ass holes in them. Just play the fucking game!
---
Yeah I tried the LMG on the test sever and it was good and the scope is good as well
---
The weapon skins made specifically for that gun are just not worth it my opinion. Just use a universal or seasonal skin.
---
You guys are no fun
---
You're getting pretty pissed off for someone claiming to not care

wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

Mozzie is great, especially when twitching twitch, but maestro is a great anchor. It really can be down to intel vs defense, which you’d prefer

Good shit weeb. R6tracker Global Position stats are also very inaccurate btw lmao.

I played the yugioh mobile game and they just drop you to the next tier down every season. That way if you leave for a while you'll have to work your way up. But people in silver dont get stuck against plat and diamond players during placement matches every season. It wouldn't be perfect because they just start you off at the lowest rank and it's not a team based game but still having to redo your placements every season is just dumb.
---
Both are good but I just fell in love with the F90, its also very efective opening barricades

you get less mmr the more matches you play, it has nothing to do with your rank

this is actually a 10/10 for me

Honestly no

That's fucked up dude

Edgy!

Not even funny, hope the mods perma-ban you.

Happened to me with my buddy but there was just two of us against five

OP how do you find ranked matches that only go 3 points

You kids don't know the pain that was old 3 hit, 20% speed barb wire. I wouldn't touch that corridore with a 10 foot pole...
