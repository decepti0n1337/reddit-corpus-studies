So I am the god of taking Bad stats a making a clutch out of them.

---
---
This
---
My first round as Warden when i swapped to his shotgun. Got an ace
---
No.
---
No, not everyone can go buy a keyboard and mouse. Sure it‚Äôs inexpensive. But if you want to use KB&amp;M go on a computer. Or if by some weird chance they do, you should be in servers on pc, not console anymore.
---
T hunt definitely helps with that. And a few maps are just bad in general (favela). Honestly tho if you just keep playing casual and even if you don‚Äôt do good at first you will eventually learn the maps and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
He looks like The Rock tho
---
i was an eh player until i followed the recommendations for the terrorist hunt. my aim was poor, and now i am calibrated to play on a wack ass sensitivity of 100-100-100.
---

---
i actually enjoy terrorist hunt, because there‚Äôs roughly 3 enemies per room, i run in, 3 headshots, 1 magazine, and its onto the next one. it helps to make sure you‚Äôre confident in your aim, not to mention i learned the maps a lot better from playing terrorist hunt. 
---
then make it a statement of a ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù in terrorist hunt before you dive off into several hours with your gang in ranked, to make sure your aim is on point, and your reaction time is ready.
---
Well that's mean ain't it?
---
Putting you in pc servers makes sense but it‚Äôs not happened
---
I know how to fix it play console u idiot lol üòÇ
---
This cosplay scares me to death, just like in game!! Well done.
---
Server.
---
Siege is the best LAN game ever.
---
Online?....fucking annoying.
---
J√§ger by chance?
---
Omg this happened to me a year ago with lion!
---
No. The map is still extremely poorly designed, there's only two possible rotates from either side of the map. The map itself is extremely tiny, and the sites themselves are incredibly bad.
---
Casual for sure
---
Capacity doesn't matter just make sure it has fast read and writes and is not full all the time.
---
Well her lmg-e stats aren't that bad, if I am not mistaken they are pretty darn close to her at with the exception of fire rate, but who needs that when u have 150 rounds in ur belt

---
What
---
I suggest not being such an arrogant prick buddy.
---
That could be from a game early season
---
The map is literally to small and to destructible.
---
Lets see if they rework it in the next 2 years
---
Not playing the game is still better
---
Recruit
---
The reason why her AR is more commonly picked is cause of the faster RoF and the slightly better recoil with the proper attachments. It also has a very huge difference in reloading speed. HOWEVER you can't suppress someone into a corner with only 30 bullets so who cares
---
Well not to be mean but the place is in a poor city where strong walls aren't common and are mostly thin wood walls.
---
True
---
I like the way it is for casual. That's mostly the nostalgia talking though. All my fav maps are horribly imbalanced, House, plane, yacht, and Favela.
---
This shit bothers me so much! Your screen looks clean, replay shows the person in the open for 2 seconds to line up a shot... makes me feel dumb and frustrated every time.
---
Even if you can't keep the ops, you can play them all for a month and you'd know which ops you liked and which you hated and then you can just buy the ones you like.
---
Yeah I use her lmg cuz I can handle the recoil, and again 150 rounds, fuck reloading, just spray
---
‚ÄúHmmm why do I remember OP‚Äôs name? Oh he‚Äôs the reposter from last time as well.‚Äù
---
He probably felt more comfortable using a gun without an acog in close quarters
---
Especially when you have a buddy who is also rocking an LMG AND is playing Finka

You can literally prefire a door for an entire Bomb plant..... it‚Äôs great when it works
---
Those weapons were automatics. The BOSG isn't.
---
Just a bug which has been in the game since lauch afaik. Just use discord or some other app. Only way to fix voice chat not working is restarting or starting a custom game then quitting immediately.

I think they announced that Ranked will require an actual unanimous vote.Wont help as much with a situation like this,but it will.
---
Nice
---
I can't believe that the gun and knife fight lasted for that long. I'm not great but my team would have forced me to uninstall if I'd lost that fight
---
Took my brain a minute to process
---
20k more and you can buy a skin
---
How long has this been like this for you? I was worried it was just me, but maybe their servers have been bad lately?
---
Is that in euros ?
---
R6 is competitive, just not enough. In the state that it‚Äôs currently in, it can‚Äôt compete with games like CS, if Ubisoft would just try and fix some of the well known issues that the community screams about on the daily it could have a chance.
---
Speaking of holding doors the 150 drum mag also makes it an easy bait for people who dont pay attention. Just today I was prefireing through a door stopped halfway and waited. Lesion came almost immediately and I finished him
---
When in reference to Russia, it kind of does. I'm not even mad, just found it in bad taste.

A couple of rounds but normalised afterwards

Wholesome post, should‚Äôve posted earlier for prime hours

Disable the Dolby sorround on R6, the spacial sound of the 7.1 is confusing as hell
---
How the actual fuck

I can see why that would make anyone uninstall. How bout this, this skin activates some sort of reverse fire for Doc against enemies that's not atleast 1m away from the outside.

Okay. Thanks! I didn‚Äôt know that.

Yeah

That particular shotgun is for breaching only; know this.

I have. I don‚Äôt understand the potato shooting, though, but someone just explained it to me.

it was nice.

Thanks mate!

This gave me the chills

bruh this is so insanely good

I know what the Potato famine is, I just didn‚Äôt know the term Potato shooting. Someone has explained it to me, now, so I understand the title.

Is this why I do better at 2am on my third 24oz can of redbull while listening through the fire and flames than when it's 4am I'm out of redbull and I turned my music off because it's a 1v3 and I'm getting no call outs so I gotta listen?

This friday (sept. 9th) but unless you have the 0ass, you cant get the ops till the 16th

Nah I tried but someone ran out and tapped him.

Maybe be slow then attack from different angles but eh that wouldn‚Äôt make sense
---
Dang good clip though
---
I‚Äôm still dtf
---
Your aim gets worse?
---
Looks awesome!
---
Are you lost
---
Like when you move, and the game teleports you back to your previous spot due to lag
---
There is no travel time on regular bullets, it's hitscan. Doc's pistol, Capitao's bolts, and most of not all projectiles do.
---
Hey if you leave what you want me to do next.
---
Sure
---
Ok
---
They better have let you in for free looking like that. Spot on costume!
---
I could try
---
...... I'm assuming you read a very small part of this post and assumed bit was about MnK users on console? It isn't about that in any way.
---
Sounds fun I‚Äôll try
---
HOT dog shit but he makes for a good casual session
---
it wasnt? i killed hibanna, crouched behind the filing cabinet, uncrouched, strafed right  to get a headshot, then crouched. i crouched twice killing the nomad?
---
Will do
---
Amazing, I got a 13k 0d game in newcomer today! I was so elated
---
This is something they're working on, actually you can see exclusive cutscenes on the official YouTube, for the moment, they're also working at an artbook with a lot of storyline from every operator and Harry with the battlepass.
---
Okay
---
What the fuck did I just read?
---
Nah tho, the Bajur is Siege's Jesus
---
Nice Gamertag
---
Some badass shit
---
Toxic much. Also its entirely based preference and I aint a fan of the AR. Its good but ima just stick with the LMG that can easily get me an Ace.
---
I don't understand what that has to do with what I said but I think most people should think shotguns suck and shouldn't be used.
---
There was a time where House was dominated by some sneaker wearing Germans snuck around with the zoom of a pair of binoculars. It was scary.
---
My heart was racing and I was a little aggressive, but its not that bad
---
I‚Äôll try
---
Thank you kind gamer
---
Yeah that was toxic but you know Reddit
---
Im sorry brother sadly your spaghetti will remain sauceless
---
Big brain time
---
You're welcome, kind player.
---
Thanks
---
You would assume wrongly.
---
I read it and I'm just pointing out while yes, you can plug in a keyboard normally, it wouldn't work in Siege.
---
I also support the idea of text chat with the keyboard controller pad, or just the regular menus like you brought up.
---
I never knew I needed this
---
If you wanna be toxic go to PC
---
old account?
---
I'm on pc
---
I like you too &lt;3
---
It‚Äôs a game
---
Then stay there
---
I'm Glad we had this conversation.
---
Dont come out
---
Imma come back to this
---
I was shocked. I've died so many times trying to get that lol
---
I saw you there!!!!! Your cosplay was so good I was to shy to ask for a picture tho but still good job :)
---
Alright, this has gone on long enough. Let‚Äôs just agree to disagree.
---
And what you want takes us away from the best experience.
---
If this was really an issue it would have at least been brought up by ubi but sense the launch of burnt horizon nothing, and that‚Äôs because it isn‚Äôt an issue
---
Dude I feel that. What platform do you play on.
---
Nah, he‚Äôs fine, the guns just take some practice. Other than that, his kit is pretty solid.
---
At least watch the video I sent
---
I did
---
Drivers, update them
---
Well then you are beyond help
---
Oh yeah
---
I think it's just to point out the rarity of drops. I wish I had picked up the Black Ice pack back when, bit that was before I had more financial independence. I also remember how people exploded when they heard they were going to add the skins to the loot table. Ah, the old days.
---
I agreed with some of it
---
Man's hasn't seen the sun in years
---
What happened
---
Absolutely awesome cosplay üòÑ
---
Year 1
---
But not the part were he says it‚Äôs a non-issue I guess
---
Sounds cool.
---
I can easily kill all of my teammates with 2 grenades!
---
Hot
---
Amazinf cosplay
---
Your firewall may be blocking the port required to use voice chat
---
I agreed with how he suggested to fix it
---
hmmmmmm
---
Game Cube wbu?
---
Idk man update your drivers, if that doesn‚Äôt work check the files or reinstall. I had something similar when I didn‚Äôt update my graphics card for a bit. Not to that extent but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd check first.
---
I'm a fan of get flanked's perspective on ops like lion finka and dok. The global abilities don't need too much skill, you just push a button and impact the round. Granted I think they're all great ops but I really am not a fan of their gadgets
---
I second this.
---
The Unblinking! I bought that one too DX
---
Congrats my guy
---
Welcome! To get started, just play around with the ops you have, and then find who you think is fun to play. Operator experience means a lot, so just play and don‚Äôt be afraid to explore. Don‚Äôt care about the backlash. If you want to have fun and do something ‚Äústupid‚Äù go for it!
---
Gameboy advance
---
People also pick the AR for the faster ADS speed
---
I‚Äôm not sure but go on plane on a private match one kaid other nomad and find out
---
I do 3d animation and rigging so I assumed that must be whats going on but I couldn't fathom why. Is anything ever intentionally rigged to the eyes or eyelids in the game aside from the eyes and eyelids themselves. What is the rigging process that could result in an error like this getting pushed out to customers?
---
Back when I first started my friend forced me into ranked for my first 10 games, I got copper, I'm glad they don't let you do that anymore
---
He‚Äôs not very fps intuitive lol, he does have his moments tho lmao
---
Yes
---
More like "welcome to siege". Not sure if I jave the stomach tbh. Two nights in a row of tk and 1st round kicks in casual. Sooo fun.
---
Tbh it also looks like my aim every time I play this game.  
---
  
---
I need to play R6 more and sharpen my aim
---
Let them sizzle for a good 3 seconds then throw for optimal flavor
---
ya i use it on most my weapons
---
aye is as the irish say "this be your brain on consoles, dont do consoles kids.... blimey"
---
rip
---
press f to pay respects

Casual only on console. Pc is toxic Af and full of try-hards
---
It will be higher than diamond
---
Is that a smurf account or are you god
---
Don‚Äôt see why you care it resets in 4 days
---
oh, that's just bad connection to the server, or bad internet connection in general
---
Thanks. What is the elo needed for this ranked?
---
Smurf.
---
I have 1500 hours in game.
---
It's just below the tip of the arrow
---
Just messing around lol
---
Ela‚Äôs mines can be great for roaming, I don‚Äôt play much Vigil but considering they still know you‚Äôre there when droning I‚Äôve always found his ability a lot less helpful than Ela‚Äôs. 
---
I actually think they‚Äôre easier to use roaming since you can specifically target where the attackers are coming in then sit back to jump on them more easily compared to how careful you have to be when using them on site.
---
Bruh
---
Yeah, like loop when I get back up from the airjab lol
---
They said it could not be done
---
At first, I thought that was going to happen.
---
Im legit about this i want to help some coppers out
---
September 9-10
---
Are you being serious? You don‚Äôt get why it makes you look so pathetic to put yourself down to copper just to feel good about yourself and smash a few new players? It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you being a nice guy helping a copper out, you just want to feel good about yourself and have a few easy wins and feel what it‚Äôs like to dominate a game of new players.
---
...
---
On Tuesday, stop asking these dumb questions, just look for the answer, you can find it almost everywhere
---
Coppers don't want your 'help'.
---
I dont hole myself up on a pedestal im not a fucking narcissist

For sure. That knife tho lol
---
Tf is that
---
Heavenly is Jesus.
---
Downvote for toxicity
---
Be honest want rank are you in on your main im just curious
---
Watch rogue-9s video on this, (it is intentional, it's actually what you would see IRL)
---
Gold 1
---
Console is a different breed
---
The fact that Doc is the toxic one in the cartoon is fucking perfect
---
Clearly not, but you want to be able to once you‚Äôve smashed a few new players and came out with top kills 20 games in a row since they all are new.
---
It's on kapkan's as well, because i have it and few other chimera bio-hazard outfits too.
---
Nice chap.
---
Thought this was just an in game render for like 10 minutes
---
They most likely are not new they are probably players that are just bad at FPS games in general and havent gotten good yet
---
i like how her mouth is the trigger
---
Dont you think half the fun of ranked is getting their through your own skill instead of being boosted
---
World of Gu
---
I mean new players are most likely to be down there since it‚Äôs a hard game to pick up and most will start at the bottom. Even so, you still want to shit on people who are bad at FPS games, so you still are a massive dickhead.
---
No i think the fun of ranked is when you clutch up or you do some impossible thing
---
Not my best clip. I ended up getting clapped after that.
---
It's great for spraying the un-reinforced walls walls on favela.
---
i preffer 9-11
---
The amount of times I've died trying to hammer someone as sledge even though I could've easily killed the person. Just yesterday we almost lost a game because I died trying to hammer someone, they ended up clutching the round and we went on a losing streak for a bit. Luckily managed to win though.
---
But with 50 failed attempts there's always at least 1 (hopefully) that works, and in my mind that makes it worth it.

Nah bro you're good, he's just a prick.
---
Amerooo the attacket
---
A blanket over your body would really tie it off
---
This is what I was thinking. Not much of a hazmat suit
---
Did I see you at PAX West?
---
The game doesn't have a good way of rewarding team play that gets wins versus simple fragging. That great callout you made is worth a lot less than the wall bang you enabled for another player. 
---
I think if the game had a better system that more heavily rewarded utility usage and offered players a chance to identify really strong strategy and teamwork, things would improve. 
---
I would totally donate some of my renown to a player who was really helping the team but not getting those precious kills.
---
This is like 4 stage act.
---
When I played the last year, I had a full friends team in every match, so didn't experienced it.  
---
Viewed some in the other team, but just in the most intense ranked matches.
---
This shit
---
Like at the end of Overwatch games where you vote for the MVP. Maybe they‚Äôd get some extra renown. That way you can vote for the most influential player rather than just the person who kill whored.
---
This is one of the things I love about siege, every gun has a distinct sound
---
It is because they take a videogame entirely too seriously.
---
Well I‚Äôm on console myself and in Gold as well, but considering Gold as of right now is the average rank there is a wide variety of people in there that can be good or bad, and the person you just mentioned is most likely the latter. Toxicity is a barrier that prevents the bad people from getting better because if they close themselves off with the toxicity they spew then there is no progress being made on their part.

"You look like schei√üe today"
---
well, okay then :(
---
I think it actually depends more on your playstyle. 
---
Vigil is good for more solo oriented style. Use his gadget to change/hold the angle safely without Attackers knowing where you are aiming from while his guns are pretty decent. 
---
Ela is more close combat oriented but her gadget helps out the team even when she's dead. 
---
If you are more of a team player, I'd suggest Ela but practice to get used to both her SMG and her shotgun.
---
If you're going into ranked yes as alot of the time, especially in higher ranks, you might be invited to a party for comms. Callouts would be really helpful then.
---
I wait at the end of the season mostly because I‚Äôve noticed they would have to put a huge amount of time into the game to even get to silver and i kinda want to help a few i don‚Äôt really get why people are getting mad I‚Äôm doing it on smurf so its not like I‚Äôm doing it for myself on my main account and the people i will be playing against are end operation coppers they are staying in copper for the rest of the operation if we are being realistic and a lot of people are going to say I‚Äôm doing it because i want to feel good about myself which is very ignorant why would i feel good about stomping on someone who is barley better then a terrorist in t hunt

Preach brother!

Finger in the trigger guard makes spidey senses tingle. Real or not.

This repost is sadder than Schindlers List. 
---
Dirty shit-poster.
---
The hologram idea itself is interesting. The fake reinforced wall or shield might be able to confuse the Attackers. Maybe add fake barricades as well. 
---
However, I'm not sure the need for passive like that.
---
Siege doesn't dumb down the game for noobs/kids to "do have the same chance to win". It's survival of the fittest here.
---
that's one hella of an impact nade
---
Dude. Are you insane or something? Why would that be an insult? 
---
I'm just telling you to piss off since I'm worried you'll drown in downvotes in this thread, because you don't realize  how ,and I quote,''dumb af'' you are.
---
It doesn‚Äôt really end up benefiting but the booster (you), because your artificially boosting them and disrupting their natural learning curve. Then when they face tougher opponents than they are supposed to be matched against it begins to dim their appetite to play. Theres really no good reason, but do as you see fit since you seem adamant.
---
Doesn't the barbed wires all get taken out together if you bunch them up?
---
It's funny that the bot classified it as a glitch.

Once again i play on a throwaway smurf account so no it dosnt benefit me and the reason is i enjoy helping the coppers that are having a hard time

N√∏kk is actually pretty decent at taking out roamers and being a soft Jackal replacement. Also, hit headshots. Her pea shooter of a gun is remarkably good at it.
---
This scoreboard is pleasant to watch
---
Nah, they had a free play week for everyone regardless of platform
---
Well yes but no, i mainly use the lmg but sometimes when i want to be a tryhard eg in ranked i go for the ak btw i put acog on lmg sometimes bcs sometimes u get fired from a distance but it fucks u up at close range
---
When someone knocks on yo door
---
I did this once. On round 3 I got fucking dumpstered and didnt get another kill till round 6 lmao
---
Thats why u don‚Äôt play with your food
---
I like N√∏kk, but yeah, the fucking fmg 9 is just terrible, since launch it is my least favourite smg in the game, couldnt they give her anything else than this cardboard cutout?
---
Casual has different rules and no leave penalty though.
---
Are you insane you say giving her an ACOG is strong yet you're hypocrite Giving her Alibi's SMG is stupid and would make her broken because the MX4 storm is really strong.

Dude.. I believe if you are experienced enough to know what walls needs to be reinforced, you also are to know you would have killed him. You aimed at his head I mean.. coincidence?

As well if you wanted to hole the wall with c4, why didn't you do it in the first place instead of meleeing it?

I'm sorry but I've had far too many experiences of this in ranked to know it's common practise.

And by the way, better being 5v5 with the wrong wall reinforced instead of being 4v5 with your damn hole in the wall.
---
finally someone said it
---
you are not ash yet, ash gotta never let go of that sprint button unless you are shooting. lol moving your aim aimlessly at everyone so people can think that you are some sort of human headless chicken. Then You've outdone yourself and you may call yourself ash may-ne.. lmao
---
This lol. I‚Äôm level 150ish and I still have moments where teammates scare the shit out of me and I shoot them
---
Yeah that would be pretty cool but you would have to take the SMG 11 since she only has that and a shotty
---
Actually, radiations fear him. The suit is here for decorum only.

Well ya own a watch, so I guess it‚Äôs a warden cosplay

Well that was before the change on 12th of Feb this year

i shouldn't expect anything from this sub honestly, it's usually just the same stupid shit that gets to the front page every time
---
This looks very accurate! I love it! :)

I‚Äôll be giving out golds to anyone who can correctly make out the sounds of pulses gadget via text.
---
Until Microsoft and ubi do something about then nothing will happen. Ubi themselves said that it isnt allowed but they cant do anything when its 3rd party software tricking the system. The only advice I could give is try to play smarter rather than try trying to go head to head against the scrubs
---
I was playing casual with mates in a party so no I couldn't talk in game, no I didnt know that was a thing in the game because I usually don't shoot my team mates through a wall while they are reinforcing, and I didn't use the nitro cell to start with incase a teammate had a shot gun or a impact nade so I didn't waste it.
---
OK first calm your saggy tits, I don't know why you're feeling personally attacked, and secondly the MX4 might be strong at close distances but that's the niche n√∏kk is supposed to be strong, as an alternative maybe kaids Aug or lesions t5 maybe? sorry that I don't know all the weapon stats of the top of my head maybe I remember the m4x wrong, but that's no reason to get personal.
---
Sincerely, an insane hypocrite.
---
Who's the fucks downvoting every post?
---
IMO Lion is still busted in high elo (plat 2 - dia)   
---
Being droned out by 3 drones, having 2 guys push you from either side, and then the fucking lion charge goes off too? Naah man. Naah. Its just to easy pressing 1 button and locking down people for 2 seconds. And yes, 2 seconds is still alot. I will admit though that the current state of lion is way more acceptable than release. The real issue then comes when you can pair these low skill ops together. Throw a doki in the mix and its just..
---
Lol you‚Äôre so soft
---
Dude for realses, where are you from? I would love to buy a drawing from you.
---
I swear if it becomes like CS:GO where some random guy screams into my ear every time I start the game I'm gonna quit for good
---
I can't see it, where is it?
---
Please shut up before I step on a lego
---
Or use chat like a decent human being ffs
---
Ye I assume it's going to work the same way here
---
That‚Äôs amazing! If I had been there, I would have been convinced that you were the voice actor for Cav, even though I have no idea what she really looks like
---
Dude I played Siege on a ¬£500 PC that I built up over years from Christmas and birthday money when I was too young and lazy to work... Get a grip. 
---
A cheap Ryzen 5, a 1660 or 1660ti, a 500W PSU gold+, a cheap motherboard and an 8GB stick of ram.
---
Ezpz you just spent ¬£500 and you now have a PC you can play Siege with. Add in a TV/Monitor, a mouse and keyboards and it's GG WP
---
Xim 4 Google it genius and on PS4 just download a software (don't play PS4 don't know the software)
---
Smooth haha

Everyone bow down before the lord

Maverick can counter bandit by cutting through and shooting the his battery gadget thingy
---
Just get uplay+ while it is free and then r6s ultimate
---
I‚Äôm mad for you I clenched my fists a little to
---
Snot is all over my phone thx brb
---
Yoo, I'm definitely going to try that
---
Maverick, IQ, Buck, and situationally even Fuze can be used in his place. While Thatcher is easily the most versatile, the ability to use vertical play on many sites makes the others decent at clearing gadgets too
---
Not funny didnt laugh
---
useless op
---
whats your rank
---
If you mean actual rank, bronze 3, but this was casual.
---
Sometimes fortnite has really toxic people, now it‚Äôs just a bunch of kids lol. I stopped playing fortnite and I‚Äôm happy about that. But I gotta go to school. Cya
---
I felt kinda bad but I was on offense and  I saw a lesion doing this and took out the tower with one foul swoop.
---
hmm
---
nice deagle
---
Best cav ever.  I would tell where they are all.
---
DAMN IT I WAS TOO SLOW
---
# *NICE*
---
just pull down 4head
---
Sorry fellow JoBro, maybe next time!
---
"this has to be console. No way it isn't"
---
Defender: like IQ mixed with Lion. Sends out a ping through the whole level, anyone using electronics will light up for team to see through walls.
---
It's an important part of the game that you can't hear after an explosion. Disabling that would give you an unfair advantage.
---
It changed for me :(
---
All missed just watch it frame by frame
---
With a renown booster you'll get between 300-500 every game if you win or lose,
---
do lesion's cardboard t5
---
they also want to kill. if someone takes all the kills it's no fun, just running arount the map for 2 minutes. im not saying it's ok, i'm saying what's the reason. they are about shootouts instead of winning the objective.
---
Damn loved it üòç
---
well it‚Äôs really just a buff on his glasses sorry i didn‚Äôt mean to say rework
---
Imagine being that pulse like ‚Äú is he gonna stop firingoohhh shhhiiitttt‚Äù
---
9? But I bet there‚Äôs one more behind the statue in the mid-life
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gotta run out of ammo at some point, right?‚Äù
---
"why you enjoy console"\*\*
---
There is 9 total montys
---
That‚Äôs awesome, man!
---
So those charts only show pc players. Leaving out the 75% of the community who play console. Siege has around 30 to 35 million players.  The charts are also only plat and above so 25% of the pc community. Those win charts are wrong in every way imaginable. Go get the other 28 million or so people who play the game and then you can use those charts as data.
---
Awesome but your beret is shit
---
Bruh this is the best counter to him ever
---
U call them toxic but ur crying lmao
---
When the season starts.
---
he doesn't need it
---
Your first alpha pack always is legendary.
---
he was leaning you weren't
---
Dread it, run from it, hockey pucks always arrive
---
i‚Äôm on controller
---
Lmao, you accidentally left me on read.
---
Familiar thing happends in PAYDAY 2, i know that from experience
---
Why are you even looking at the level? It doesn't say shit once you're past level 50.
---
I got the engraved skin for mutes mp5k for my first pack.
---
Siege is finally resembling its brother Ass Creed.
---
Well if they're diamond 3 and I'm copper 2 it's not normal I think
---
Give it black ice skin now
---
All 4 rounds. 3rd defense we had them 5v1, they hit the servers and get a plant down and we can't move until defuser runs out.
---
No, we don‚Äôt need that at all.
---
Need it on the MP5SD
---
1v1 me eyes of heaven
---
Ah yes, enslaved sauce
---
You have a casual MMR separated from your ranked MMR. If you want to play against people with your rank, play ranked (starting next season).
---
How reliably does it eject casings thou.
---
Sheesh
---
I'll try
---
It‚Äôs easy just only use shotgun
---
I hÃ∂aÃ∂vÃ∂eÃ∂ seen a picture of dokkebi with a penis
---
on console? hell yeah
---
Nope.
---
I solo queued to plat 2 on one of my accounts on PC. It's just not fun. You have to argue with your team to get them to do the most basic things in order to have a fighting chance. And of course the enemy team is a sweaty 5-stack that is super coordinated.
---
I'm just tired of it. I don't bother arguing anymore. If you don't do what you're supposed to, I won't either.
---
I'd love to, but I momentarily have no PS4 D:

Operator prices drop on the anniversary of their release. So when Y4S3 starts the Y1S3, Y2S3, and Y3S3 operators will see a price reduction.
---
Didnt realize what was wrong till just now
---
The answer is &gt;!10!&lt; &gt;!: Two in the room to the right, behind the large statue in the middle, on top of the divider, directly in front, three in the room in the back and one behind the gargoyle that is close on the left.!&lt;
---
Ultrawide gang :D
---
You sure it was diamond? Most diamonds I find on console are either living shitposts or leave after dying once.
---
Actually im low af i dont take the game too seriously and kinda fucked some positioning rankeds... Literally i dropped to copper 4 and i cant get out i have a bronze 1 lvl more or less still low so... Kinda perfect
---
You got any breadsticks?
---
I would watch more Pro games but too many things happen during a match for me to follow. It's easier to just watch one or two people and highlights but that's not the format currently.

Oh shit, can‚Äôt wait

On a serious note tho Jackal is amazing. The C7E with ACOG and compensator is the best thing. I still prefer hibana though. Just a personal preference
---
What‚Äôs it made of?
---
Tenerino
---
90% the top 10 percent is platinum diamond and champion. Champion is well under the top %
---
Hibana is good 
---
But I hate the way she only has 21 bullets in a clip
---
JoJo references are everywhere.
---
As much as I'd love to sit down and do some sort of practical project I don't think I'd be able to complete it. Props to you for managing to make it that quickly and this good
---
They have reinforced so it's a no
---
Well it's never happened nor likely will
---
Please get out of my way Mr corpse
---
Yeah I really want that to change. 21 bullets is too less. They should increase her mag capacity
---
Nope, planks block that shit
---
Too much green, but I like it, I could see this being like a common or uncommon

Cardboard mostly with a paper barrel

Less of a flank more of just moving to a different side. For it to be a flank they have to think you are somewhere else or they have to be in a fight with other people.
---
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME
---
It was mostly around 2 hours every day
---
Sep 10
---
Sept. 10th is my guess. It's normally on the TS for 2 weeks before it's released.
---
Queueing in tts sucks and I litterally waited 30 mins for 1 ranked game
---
Stop propagating this. Its such a stupid arbitrary number with little to no actual meaning. Alternate accounts, free weekenders all contribute to this. If you really want to impress me with a player based number why not use concurrent players? Oh yeah because that number is insurmountably smaller.
---
I‚Äôm not disappointed
---
Nah all they need is to match her head gear, uniform, weapon skin and weapon attachments but I guess that stresses the server too much
---
And Capitao solved as well
---
I'm happy i helped then \^\^
---
Realistically, I feel the actual number has to be 12-16 million.
---
This is Awesome! but is there one for clash?

I would love if an IQ squats down on my evil eye

That's an amazing Cav cosplay.

Try playing her and using different strategies.

disrespect
---
Idk why you were downvoted, but to answer we don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs been up in the air for a while that Tachanka would revive a rework but that‚Äôs been about it. Although we may have gotten an unconfirmed update from the devs on the issue through the new redone operator bios that are coming next season for the original 20 operators.

Hello __echo___, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d0ibbr/doc_mains/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

* This also includes video macros.

* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.

Thank you!

It wouldn't be useless, it'd give the community a voice which more than 80% pretty much dont. Which is one of the reasons the game is already dying.

Sure thing bud. Ubi will be pushing pl eventually. Enjoy while your casualness last

Yeah I don't think you can ever go wrong with Thatcher. I'm not sure I agree with you about his guns being good, but he's still a great Op

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Show and tell is going to be a bit...American this year
---
Aw you shoulda made the chibi Monty
---
u were the one in badgers video, that cosplay is fucking sick btw
---
My condolences that they don't lol
---
If a random invites you to a party, don‚Äôt accept
---
I understand what you're saying but the game is still popular enough to have those accounts made. The 50 million number is still a good measurement.
---
also the p9 has higher dps and higher damage per mag
---
I bet you secretly posted this for the crotch shot huh.... Thats disgusting.
---
And i like it.
---
Just bc the player base is so large now that‚Äôs why silvers seem better than they used to be. Whenever I‚Äôm spectating a silver I don‚Äôt have any faith in them clutching but they can surprise you sometimes lol. But yeah ranks don‚Äôt mean much unless you‚Äôre plat. I‚Äôve only been playing since operation white noise.  I didn‚Äôt play ranked when the invisibility glitch was out and the tachanka glitch where 3 armies are also 3 speeds. I just avoid playing ranked at all cost especially when there‚Äôs a game breaking glitch bc people like to exploit the hell out of it even more when it‚Äôs ranked
---
At the very least, being pounded with gunfire from chanda should slow monty/blitz to a crawl.
---
Last week I felt like I was hitting the enemy operator in the chest from close range.  Apparently it was only a confetti gun.
---
Thats one heavy Acog.
---
If you matchmake looking for a lobby (with randoms) does this still work?
---
I‚Äôve had friends who‚Äôs luck was like that, and others who‚Äôd get black ice at such a low level lol. Like they don‚Äôt even have the operator to use the camo lmao
---
Well I don't think they are from FBI right?
---
I would love that having just started the game. Cant get into the new maps enough in a short enough time period to really learn them as fast as I want. Would love to grind a map or smaller selection of maps.
---
Really I'm from the UK talk on mic all the time and never had anything like this said to me for been a Brit I've had more people say how they love my accent
---
Poor Pulse
---
I was just listing the remaining American ops
---
Separate win deltas where you can look at what applies most to you would be very useful. One complete win delta with all ranks and nothing else would be pretty useless, low rank players would really skew the data so that it‚Äôs not useful to high ranks and vice versa.
---
diamond elo = prefire everything

Nice clip, but just 1 of them is actually a one tap xD
---
Vote kick needs to be removed from casual it gets abused to much. Got kicked 3 times straight last night for not clutching 1v5s, apparent "baiting", and no reason
---
Looks amazing keep it up op
---
Truth, just means people like your game so much they will make multiple accounts (obviously for not great reasons, but still stands true)
---
1 v 5 AND defuse!  GG

Next match :

#I am gonna end this man's whole career

Watching this reminds me of my friend.  The running joke is that Sledge's grenades only home in on teammates because he never seems to kill anyone but teammates with them lol
---
Aw, that's so sweet!
---
You should cluster charge them.
---
10
---
Yeah one time I was playing in a 4 stack with my good friends. Friend 1 kept initiating a vote kick for the random. So we kicked him from the game
---
Good drawing:3
---
I see why not
---
Bruh he kinda cute ngl
---
Consistently yeah. But at the time I was spiking at random times, like when getting into a gunfight. I managed to kill 3 players but couldn't get the last 2.

Thanks everyone &lt;3
---
That is so satisfying to watch!
---
Takes me usually no longer than 60 seconds. What platform you on?
---
It‚Äôs just getting more popular in general too, people are looking for more modern shooters other than the typical CSGO, COD and BF games and Siege is drawing in a lot of people tired of those games.
---
GOTTEM!
---
But the players you killed may have only died because your ping is so delayed they can't hit you.
---
Not being a dick or anything.
---
i did have a retort, but apparently you're not good at reading:
---
&gt;no, that is a huge (not to mention misguided) generalization that doesn't include people who enjoy a game for a story, funny moments created by bugs or other players, etc.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;i'm not crying nor am i complaining about people "tryharding", i'm simply bringing up a valid point that you laughably wrote off narrow-mindedly before giving it some actual consideration.
---
not to mention this:
---
&gt;No you did say that and so you're trying to claim victory because YOU have no retort.
---
is just a fancy way of saying "no u", maybe if you had any ability to read you would've known that.
---
That clips dead ass year 1 wtf?
---
Which server do you play?
---
Down to bronze...
---
GamerLink might be better at getting you a team
---
Yeah it was over 2 years old
---
There is always a reason
---
Seas and one more server i cant remember the name of it starts with W i think
---
Honestly I'd have to agree, often times they balance stuff based on PC, look at kaid's shotgun when it came out, thing was basically uncontrollable on console but fine on PC, it's fixed now but for a while players were forced to use kaid's aug which at the time had crap damage including crap rate of fire to go along with it. Or Ela where using her scorpion is basically suicide where her shotgun is superior on console but on PC it's opposite
---
Get an ace, is cake day, have a friend to play games with.
---
Oh, yeah. it‚Äôs all coming together.
---
‚ÄúMice trapped nice‚Äù The frickle??
---
r/jesuschrist
---
Its possibly. I was also playing Twitch with her shotgun so anything is possible.
---
my dad just yells at me for playing :/ your parents seem cool OP
---
It's still super fucking bizarre to me that children who are young enough to get and appreciate a cake like this are allowed to play this murder simulator.
---
No but ive been arguing with people on this sub for a while now and have picked up a few positives and negatives
---
your a hypocrite you know? going on reddit and talking about being tked 1 time but you just made your whole team lose a round by fuzing them.
---
I never liked these sort of celebrations. Cause it's not actually 50 million when you see how many people remade accounts because of bans or to Smurf.
---
Yes but a recoil pattern would be nice, even if they only give her 30rnds
---
Also for claymore.
---
Year pass, season pass. Basically the same thing. It still doesn‚Äôt mean the players are free.

Ok good lol

I like the little detail on his mask.

BraxAttax
---
Yet you still can't reduce the hacker player base, DDoSing is still a thing, MnK on console still can't be dealt with, every latch brings a new OP glitch where an op gets literally *removed* from the game for a month, ping advantage is how everyone dies and you make everything in the game cost real money. GG Ubisoft. G fuckin G.

1. Fiddle with video settings and see if anything changes.

2. If nothing changed, do a fresh driver installation.
---
3. Change task priority to highest on the r6s.exe

4. Change settings in nvidia control panel.
---
If nothing helps, you probably have something installed incorrectly or something hardware related.
---
It happens my brother
---
See, red! Wait, that's blood.

#nice

Idk where u live but I can easily find a game in 30 seconds or less on a weekday at 2 or 3 pm. Think it‚Äôs just u bud
---
10, I think.
---
You can set your game mode preferences to hostage only but sadly, the map is still random.
---
Or BraxNoHax. Or Brax_to_the_Max. Or Brax_plays_Sax.
---
Oh god
---
It's fixed in pbe not live yet
---
so just because i'm not very good it means i must have ruined the game for others?
---
The best option is who ever shoots it is at fault.  Maybe attackers will be less hesitant doing random ass wall bangs
---
That aim looks suspiciously steady for a controller.
---
Pfft, Valve? Making games?
---
I approve
---
This is the type of high tier content I joined this sub for
---
Lmfao it did the opposite to me. I wish I spent more time caring about other stuff in high school than siege. 3 years in this damn game and I‚Äôm still the same where I started: stuck in gold.
---
You forgot to add the Korean text on the armor
---
they have to use credit card/paypal, so I don't really think there are getting that more hackers
---
I have 2k hours xD
---
Do a search with "the caber hammer", should get some good images.
---
Been playing since beta and have formed a genuine love for this game and how far it‚Äôs come.
---
Uh yeah half of them are the assholes with Smurf accounts
---
But pc is better I left Xbox and don‚Äôt regret it
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt think of a change that would effectively please everyone and keep the game the same. That‚Äôs I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to put that on the Devs, because the solution really is incredibly simple and THEORETICALLY possible. 
---
Tho I doubt it will ever happen lol
---
are you at home
---
What would a Ubisoft game be doing on Origin?
---
Copied from other thread:
---
2. Do a fresh driver installation.
---
He is probably from Canada.
---
Brax_attends_Pax? Brax_hates_tax? Brax_isBack...s?
---
You're obviously smurfing and throwing the game. A good introduction for newer players.
---
Day One here.
---
how do you know if get the charms?
---
My game has crashed probably only 3 times in the 4 years of ownership.
---
Omg this reminds me of the Degle in H3VR but real
---
Alright
---
Hello darkness...
---
I can't go on Reddit without expecting JoJo anymore.
---
i have a better way and that is on coastline  when u always spawn in ruins u just chen inblue bar if the hostage is there if not and the flare is also not their the hostage can only be in kitchen or penthouse so you just run around check through kitchen window and otherwise u know it is in penthouse in any case you will always be at 1 minute  wich is the timer for u to get  points
---
Uhm... yes? At some point, you probably changed it to be that way so you got some FPS drops.
---
250 is quite a lot for your specs and is probably only possible on shitty graphics.
---
I never really had problems with toxicity
---
if you have 2 groups clear each floor of outback at the same time so 2 people 2nd floor 3 people 1st floor you can find the hostage faster than one group on house
---
Don't change your task priority. That's a dumb suggestion and can ruin your computers stability.
---
*One tap intensifies*
---
I‚Äôll agree, but if Ubi lets console burn, they‚Äôll be losing more than 2/3 of their playerbase.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Agreed, Ubisoft will inevitably fuck up things even more if they continue to tweak it the wrong way but like you said the solution is supposed to be an incredibly simple and possible issue to address, as many other games have addressed teamkill/griefing incredibly well except for Siege.
---
Needs more cowbell
---
You know he got nerfed right
---
Yeah, thats nothing compared to launch. The game was REALLY bad back then. Smoke grenades would be incredibly inconsistent, BB was broken, shotguns were broken, lag spikes everywhere, rubber banding was normal, and a bunch of more issues with the game
---
He‚Äôs still a beast
---
Ying, shes better in more situations
---
I did not use the last one..
---
10/10 shit post
---
Had to take it in like a second, round was starting, started a second later
---
How is this even possible....
---
I never said it was easy but Microsoft has no benefit of people ddosing it's servers. I just want Ubisoft to be more transparent on the issue and if they are doing anything about it.
---
If this is unironic then reevaluate your life please
---
5 mln and 45 mln smurfs :D jk
---
Ubisoft has a dedicated team, and trust me, a screenshot on Reddit showing the absolute nothing won't help em.
---
Me: "I see 10"
---
Me: Looks down at other comments and sees answer
---
Me: "Well why do I bother"
---
I came from xbox to pc as well and my first season (all solo) I got bodied by pc kids. I was almost level 300 on xbox. Some people are just better at switching than others

I like paying for my skins and season pass, idc about how much money they need

I'm supporting them for treating me well as a consumer in 2019 where so many developers have failed me.

What exactly is going on here anyway?
---
Hopefully can get my hands on some!
---
Hard push 10 seconds in site.

They seem interesting, but look really bad in-game. They feel really flat.

It's the playoff of a major but yes you're right

Stop that

Nah nah, Zofia and Cav
---
I‚Äôm usually between gold 1-3
---
Let's be honest, my upvote is 10% for the pic and 90% for the title.
---
Recruit in rank nothing that great
---
There‚Äôs always hardcore modes.

It‚Äôs might be called resetting your cmos. But either way it‚Äôs the same thing
---
God has returned
---
Hes going to go another couple months thinking he cam shoot out cams now
---
Apex legends would like to have a word with you.
---
Siege is already dying so I doubt there'll be a second that isn't just for cash grabbing. I mean they already do that with the limited time cosmetics.  But yes Ela was overpowered when she came out but now with 8 nerfs and 0 buffs she's one of the worst operators in game.
---
If I had money I would be giving you a reward!
---
In all honesty i don‚Äôt think a whole lot of players who don‚Äôt use zofia or have done there research on her, would know about it as it is not her main ability, just like cav and her interrogations.
---
Haha you got called a shitter by a PS4 gold sucks to suck
---
Gadget skins plz?
---
I‚Äôd be so mad
---
I dont know wether OP responded to your comment by simply adding in your idea; or if you didn't read the post. But red dot for pistol has been included.
---
They only look good in menu and not so good in game especially the green silver one
---
r/theperfectpokemongame
---
In casual I usually play him but he‚Äôs not that great for ranked in my opinion
---
Not funny
---
They can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs on Xbox to stop sharing IP addresses when in parties
---
U said it was epic and that usually means better than average, and you‚Äôve failed your team by not planting while on site. Planting would‚Äôve made them focus on defusing and not you, giving u time to kill them. But yeah ig u won
---
Zofia and then maverick, Zofias guns are good with low recoil and I find a lot of mavericks don‚Äôt use there ability as they should
---

It‚Äôs pretty ironic, I just think it‚Äôs funny with a 2012 type meme and a watermark at the bottom left
---
Bro, do you see his kd? How is he a smurf? I recently moved from diamond on ps4, to plat 2 first season on PC. But that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs going to get it as well, they must not have good experience with a mouse and keyboard buts it their fault? Don‚Äôt just assume they are a smurf tf.

I did not use the last one

Wow, you should make these kinds of edits for actual PvP matches, next level content right here!

Try to open it on steam (if downloaded on uPlay or vice versa), if nothing changes, consider to open a ticket and ask for a text chat with an assistant.
---
I can't tell you're not that knowledgeable in the matter. It working for you is anecdotal, because literally every other forum where someone has suggested that, it makes their games or pc run worse. Sure your pc won't explode, but it's not good in the long run. I had issues with siege for years and fixed it without the use of changing priority. So I can assure you it'll be a temp fix for you in doing that. That is also not why siege can run like garbage. But hey man, if it worked for you it worked for you, but just enjoy it while it lasts. Cause that is not a permanent solution.
---
It's still misleading
---
How bout a mozzie one?
---
Oh yeah, were kinda badass. 
---
Quick note, it was EA who told them to do it. Respawn just covered it up
---
Maybe have him kill a couple people to get that dead emotionless expression
---
I know people, a lot. I've seen polls with thousands of people,  even myself own a different account for siege. At that rate i see and hear people who play the game I'd say a good 40% of that 50 million players is just extra accounts. I'm sure you even have one. I'm not saying siege is a shit game,  nor a unsuccessful one. But that 50 million number they think that's growing is quite over exaggerated.
---
How are we supposed to find it?
---
Haha I believe you. I think I'll just go with the deluxe. I'll deal with the grind.
---
Nothing. I have it through steam. steam launches Uplay but that's it. When I launch through Uplay, nothing happens. In control panel it says the game is running but it takes up 200 mb of ram and that's it. No CPU or gpu. Nothing.
---
it‚Äôs dying but it‚Äôs almost always top on twitch views? it‚Äôs also top at the fps charts so no it‚Äôs not close to dead bud
---
This actually would be really useful
---
Thanks! Tiny addition but I think it could be really helpful in tight situations.
---
probably because of your location
---
Apex is incredibly bullet sponge-y.
---
I was messing around, it‚Äôs actually a decent weapon but the R4C is superior.
---
I like that
---
Depends, if you go in with a friend you get more renown by going in solo, usually I get a friend , go to house, go to normal thunt and finish within 2 minutes. Getting about 115 every time with the year 4 pass, taking the yr pass off about 100 that to an hour is about 3000 per hour.
---
Map knowledge abuse?

I mean, I understand that. But they do it with pubg. Knowing ubi and their passive aggressive hatred for console, well never get one. Ever. Even if we do they'll charge for it.

Well first, explain your claim.

This rappel is probably my most used rappel  it‚Äôs better when you go upside down and peek the window on the first floor.

Double taps, but still impressive!
---
Read some of the other comments i explained why.
---
Before the map reworks, I would always play t hunt classic on a new map for 20 - 30 minutes just to get a basic idea and navigation. It takes a lot longer to learn angles, especially vertical angles.
---
Me and my friends play lots of r6 and cs:go where people die in only a few bullets, we tried apex and we realised that our accuracy past the first few bullets is awful and we hit the first 6-7 and then miss entire mags and end up being awful at the game
---
Try restarting ur router. Idk man it helped me
---
Ah I wish I could have helped since I have found fixes for a couple of problems but I have no idea what could cause something like that.
---
Check your audio was listing to music while doing thunt solo to get renenoun forgot to put it back up if that isn‚Äôt the case restart console
---
I was i didn‚Äôt record it tho
---
Lmao
---
I bought the standard edition (the old standard edition) and after 8 months of grinding, I unlocked all ops without paying.
---
We must‚Äôve been watching different majors.
---
Hmmmm
---
Nobody does. It got to the point that I was told to reformat my hard drive. That's too much work when only one program is having issues.
---
Cat on his keyboard maybe?
---
I always have either a doc or rook roaming and try to spawn peek and they die and leave the match, they also roam to reinforce floors which could‚Äôve been done with a 3 speed operator. It‚Äôs really annoying when people do this.

that‚Äôs why you need a full stack. a full stack gets you 190% renown and i end up getting 400 renown every time. so he should easily have over 39,000 if he rlly grinded for around 5 hours.

Team killing karma should be applied to all members of a party. Like if the composition of a team is 1 random, 1 random, and a 3 man squad. If one of them tks a random the warning should be applied to all of them. Too often do party‚Äôs just go along with whatever the other members are doing.

How far you makin him stretch that neck damn?
---
Okay i got you
---
I would say map knowledge my dude!!
---
Man I don‚Äôt know when you started playing but pre health this game was 10x worse than it is now. Sometimes I‚Äôll watch an old siege video on YouTube and it‚Äôs absolutely crazy how far this game has come.
---
Ubisoft just uses steam and origin as a market place, you‚Äôll still open Ubisoft‚Äôs launcher in the background.
---
go look at the average player per week and month charts, a funny trend is that it's going down. Heavily going down. Below csgo again to be correct. At least last I checked. The que times for siege have relatively stayed the same, for consoles at times even gotten longer. There's still hundreds of main menu glitches and party making glitches in game. That's an exaggeration but they're still very prominent. The hit registration is still buggy, sound glitches that have been in game since it came out are still around. Visual glitches with light especially are still around. Operators are completely broken in both directions. The game is in one of its worst states. Which is why average numbers are going down for players. Twitch means nothing when players are dropping.
---
Oh god lmao
---
Those were very generous numbers you were slicing off there too.
---
Not normally. You need a deployable shield and it's just a really tricky and weird parkour spot. In most other games you shouldn't have to worry about it.
---
Noted, thanks for the update
---
What kind of software do you use ? Looks pretty cool the way it came together
---
I started playing a few weeks after release.
---
Games much better no doubt, but the fact that I still see the same bugs every few months for 3 years is kinda sad. I‚Äôm tired of seeing the deplorable shield glitch, various invisibility glitches, etc. not to mention some balancing issues have remained for years. It took them months to balance Lion and Ela and Blackbeard properly and they‚Äôre still not quite balanced, Ela is borderline trash tier at least on console, Blackbeard is still extremely frustrating to play against, and Lion is still kinda broken.
---
imagine being this sad
---
As if everyone has a smurf not everyone is that sad
---
Thanks for your contribution to the conversation, truly enlightening
---
For the odd person who doesn't have one, there's another guy with 5 accounts.
---
And  absolutely frustrating
---
Hmmm yes, the evil eye here is made out of evil eye
---
And thank you for rewarding them for making you pay for a buggy laggy shitty game this setting us up for more live services that barely work propped up by idiotic microtransactions.
---
All 50 million of you are contributing to games getting even more shitty.
---
Thanks man I might copy you'r idea Screw who ever thinks it's to much Seige is a way of life!!!!
