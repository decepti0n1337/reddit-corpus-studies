I have no clue how to use Buck really. Is there any tips playing him?

Nahhhh. That wall just has a hit box

Get some friends, put a tag at the end of all ur names, have same profile pic

I find it funny that they are annoyed about it yet spells the name of the mountain wrong despite their disgrace towards the art direction of the undisclosed location.
---
Gordon Ramsey as an operator
---
Terrorist hunt and play with friends
---
U won't
---
Right... So a dude with no professional experience. Who hasn't worked on anything anywhere near as complex as Siege in his life is trying to take shots at the Siege Devs for struggling to work around the shitty game engine they're forced to work with... Gotcha.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Do you have any links to anything you've made? I'd love to see the games you've "developed" that make you think you know what issues the Siege devs run into. 
---
I am in a a mature pro clan but we don’t put our name in our gt
---
BobaFilGaming hmu
---
Mmmm thank you so much never tought of that. 
---
Depending on my operator and the map i will either follow my team or i will go solo. If am hibana/nomad i will go solo but if am monty or thermite i will follow my team.
---
The aug... that thing takes up then entire fucking screen and it sucks. 
---
Do it
---
****** I, reddit user ProudJagerMain, inform you that the subjects of the picture above are, in fact, not part of the official brand Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege
---
YES! Use the C8, do not run acog haha, pair up with a roam hunter like jackal and clear the floor vertical to the objective and then use your underbarrel shotty to clear the common spots where Mira’s or bandits would be
---
Nono solo acá 
---
I am in a amateur pro team and we don’t use our name in our gt
---
That's very good motivation and I appreciate it.
---
PC. Sorry I should've said that.
---
Well rip my idea 
---
Pensé que eras uruguayo que parte de zona norte?
---
They need to rework her model already 
---
PC.
---
Gameplay wise it makes sense though. If shotgun headshots were a thing you would aim at the head with a large spread relying on luck. Without headshots the skill is about aiming for the centre mass and making as many pellets hit as possible.  
---
My guns wouldn’t shoot, I’ve walked through the earth, shots didnt count,  couldn’t swap guns. Graphics never loaded in, the game kept telling me the party leader quit. 
---
Randomly disconnected all the time, can’t hear other players mics, can’t use my own, and the audio of the game has cut out several times 
---
Hmu on the weekend any I will
---
Nice also rip me
---
Are you joking? Cause that’s hilarious. An ametuer pro team?
---
US Central, however my Ping plays well with East coast. West coast, it's 50/50.
---
Sorry man
---
Calendar on the map is opened to April. Dokes new charm from the invitational packs says "end of the world" or something thing like that and the charm itself is a SD card with a date on the back that leads to April. Hmm a new event coming in April? Hopefully there's Easter eggs in the TTS like the leaked files from Operation Outbreak in the TTS. I love those type of things!
---
Damn you must need a i1000-000k for this 
---
I assume you’re pc haha, pretty sure that shits still unusable on console.
---
I'm also facing the same issue, i think the store is down but it's been 2 weeks since it's down. I think I'll miss out those packs. :(
---
If you click back into ranked que right away it’ll bring you back into the game you just left. 
---
His aim was potato, but some of those shield swing should have hit
---
What would his ability be?

🥔 aim

I'm so Glaz I got to read this comment

Literally playable now. FeelsOkayMate

Tells the enemies their cooking is worthless and cause them to fall into depression.
---
Yeah I'm on PC
---
Play buck and dock, they are infallible
---
This humanoid of the homosaipen species will not do this action currently specified
---
I think is a legendary skin 
---
Definitely a new skin coming out
---
By depression you mean like a downed state or are we talking like an ela concussion feeling?
---
this was a bomb ranked match, im plat 2
---
And rho a was the last weekend I belive as well

cs_oilrig
---
neither, they feel so bad they just go home
---
Darn :( I was hoping they were going to make something based on the Lindt cafe
---
Zionic what? 
---
Lmao I used to play csgo and for me bases are really consistent. This game however...
---
Ash will just run away
---
Valkyrie will throw a cam in your house and report you to the CIA
---
Hibana and sledge will make holes in your walls
---
Jäger will shoot you before you even enter your home
---
Tachanka is the safest choice, for he will love and nurture you
---
I’m pretty ass and I still have fun.
---
It says it’s a medium sized map divided into 3 sections so I think this is gonna be a good map unlike tower and villa
---
Oh yeah, i love oil rigs
---
I know. Part of the pain of this clip is seeing how wonky the game can be with melee and headshots I. E. the way he actually won the fight. 
---
Buck
---
Yea, I'm thinking so too. Is it universal or legendary to her is the real question lol.

We don't call it "gas" in Australia. We call it petrol. Literally unplayable.
---
just sucks that nobody gets caught in traps anymore. maybe one every 20 games
---
Use your ops gadgets, I see too much at my level people will only use a their gadget a little, the point of operators (mainly) is to utilize gadgets with your play style. But people never use them to their full potential, which basically makes them recruits with attachments
---
Why is every games' Australia map set in the deep outback?
---
Idk but it screams Australian at me
---
Ok cool
---
Ok
---
dont forget to drop frags through the holes you made in the floor
---
The first time was me playing as fuze 
---
The second time I TK a toxic guy who TKed me last round and was shooting at me.
---
Fortunate for those who have them. Unfortunate for those who dont. I own all of them since season one but i wouldnt mind for those who missed out to have a nab at them.

I started playing in Chimera so this lighting must have been quite an added difficulty 
---
Nice clip btw!
---
Chanka 
---
Haha that was so funny, I'm slapping my knees and rolling and the floor laughing out loud and dying in a ditch from how funny that just was
---
Good support operators with little difficulty on defense are Rook and Mute, and higher difficulty, like Doc, anyone who adds cams, and sometimes Lesion. Thatcher, Twitch, Monty, and Finka are also good supports. (Lion too, bit there's gonna be a rework) 
---
currently everything low, aside from shadows at medium and LOD at ultra
---
Talk away, that’s what he sub’s here for.
---
It’s worth it if you’re betting on g2
---
???
---
It all depends on your gaming chair.
---
Is it real
---
i cant wait for it tbh, maybe i'll finally be able to SPOT THE OBJECTIVE I'M DANCING ONTOP OF... or it's going to be the operation where doc comes in, tells us the cancer is terminal, and every operator is being replaced with lion
---
They have been! I just checked it, it was back in year 2. Thanks guys from Reddit, I'll play more glad again.
---
Thanks dude. This should’ve been around Chimera or so
---
*xylophone plays quietly in the background*
---
They would lose their uniqueness, what makes a skin special or "desired" is when it is hard or no longer acquirable. Even if it is ugly , the fact that is no longer available makes it special. 
---
I think OP forgot to link a video or something 
---
Probably
---
He could be like a juggernaut, with thick armor that has "hp." It could block like 2-3 traps before breaking
---
Man I decided to play some operators that I was told not to use because their utility was too low or they werent good enough/reliable enough, or use operators abilities where i think they belong and its worked out SO WELL. Ive been playing lots of Cav, Mira, and Buck. 3 people i used to not play normally on my old account because i was advised against it, but im actually doing well and clutching games and having fun! makes me entirely regret trying to learn from piers
---
Hambone 
---
But we already have Caveira...
---
I can't as well.
---
am i the only one or does the map look a whole lot like club house with a lil bit of oregon?
---
I do that trying to lean right sometimes when I try to aim and lean right quickly.
---
We like playing games together lol even tho I’m no good. Thank you!!
---
Chromosomes.
---
Make every defender Tachanka and every attacker Fuze
---
Dude siege was close to DOA as a muti player game gets. It's growing then and now. From what I see so long they just keep adding content. New people will get into it and keep the game alive. It's easy to come in with a mass of people first week but if no one stays then it does not matter. The game is hard to get going due to the lack of people and lose players because of that. Siege rebounding from such a weak start like dead by day light. When no one can say how long the game may last but seeing how it's already been a few years when rainbow came out. So long players dont burn out and content keep coming then siege will last long

Why would favela get reworked this year?

I'm guessing he was scoped in holding the angle going for defuser.

Operation Meatball? Do you mean Operation Pizza Time?

What's wrong?

Made by HDD gang
---
No, played siedge for 3 months( played every day for 1-2h) and already had nothing to get. Even with friends it's just boring. 
---
That may be part of it but the 16 best teams all compete in a tournament 
---
Shut up cunt
---
If you have trouble loading in you can turn down your texture settings to reduce loading time by a lot. Ultra textures particularily are extremely bad for loading times and should never be enabled with a HDD unless you want to get booted from games.
---
I feel like what this subreddit fails to understand is that a very large portion of the playerbase plays only secure area and basement is the only viable secure defend area on villa...
---
Welcome to Siege: where the players are more toxic than any other game, and where no one on Reddit really knows what they want. 
---
you tell me
---
U won’t 
---
Rook is supposed to be crouch spamming but the video is in 144p
---
My mans really did it 
---
Not the greatest, but this is from the game where I make it to platinum. It's a first for me in 1400 hours.
---
Why would it not? 
---
We really don’t know what maps will be reworked until we get the roadmap but Favela would make sense as it is an awful map with a nice setting, so a rework could fix that. I don’t think that Favela will be reworked, it’s just not unreasonable to think that it will.
---
because its the worst site on that map
---
I love Favela. It was my favorite map when it came out and I still love it now. Of course its not competitive since the design is pretty bad, but I love it

Whats tower? /s
---
Just play or watch thing but I just played for a while 
---
If you can find a friend to play it with they will help you especially if they are experienced 
---
Nintendo 64
---
A blitz is getting killed, that's what's wrong /s.
---
The crouch spam is hardly noticeable movement wise lol. I personally don't care either way, don't use it either. I just shoot torsos, so I get a 50/50 chance to headshot, and I suck at aiming anyways. 
---
best diss you’ve had! clap for yourself!!!
---
It can be good for laughs and good footage as with a little much you can score done good killstreaks by peaking outside the map and there's always some shenanigans going on but the Map is terrible for actual gameplay
---
No, you are right, it’s petrol everywhere in Australia, my guess is that they are calling it gas to cater to the seppos.
---
My problem is that my godliness has been consistent, and I’ve been averaging 4-5 kill games for days now. I think something is wrong with my controller or something.
---
God I used to play fuze on hostage just to annoy my friends
---
Its not about the movement being noticealbe, its about the fact that as he is moving so much his hitbox never alligns with his playermodel, which means that you cant hit him if you shoot the model that you can see, he also seems to have a recoil macro aswell.
---
Since its so linear, if you clutch a round it also looks amazing
---
Nah, NSW here, we also say petrol. The last gas thing made me sigh a little, but it’s only cosmetic, so it’s no big deal.
---
It didn’t need it I don’t think. Old Hereford and House were the staples of casual and custom games. They aren’t competitive maps, but they are great fun to play on especially in 2v2s or 3v3s in custom. Think of them as the Nuketown and Shipment of Siege.
---
EXACTLY WHY I PUT IT OUT 😂😭😂😭 spot on my friend. 
---
Buck yeah 
---
1. It's a p90 there's no recoil,
---
2. It's been proved hit boxes don't have that much disalignment.
---
But yes, the playermodels move too much. 
---
I agree with the OP on this, or at least make the detection timer be faster or screw something up for the defender’s view, because it is the stupid thing to allow a lucky defender to get possibly multiple quick kills simply because they jumped out of the building that they are not really suppose to leave. If I had it my way, the defender would be killed immediately by AI snipers if they came outside of their building during a round or the match.
---
but seriously, I still don't know a single call out for tower other than elevator... and i have no idea how to consistently get to it.
---
I'll take the advice. Thank you so much!
---
and I'm guessing you won't be jealous of the new charm I'm gonna complete the requirements for this weekend too.
---
Like TF2 medic realising he's healing a spy
---
It’s alright they tend to not make so much noise after they get their annual thumping from G2, really lengthens their perspective. 
---
Yea but to the left of the rock that looks awfully similar to another rock formation that is in the perfect position to be uluru and it’s counterpart (forgot the name) 
---
well i wasnt told to not play her, but when i played her, they just told me where to put it, but then they told me to just sit behind one mirror and dont move. with buck, because of his playstyle. they just wanted me to blindly follow them with a utility person (ex thatcher, thermite, hibana, etc). So instead of learning ways to traverse the maps, make certain plays and etc with buck, i never really got to learn. i was just always a sitting duck after doing my one job.
---
So basically Club House, but Australian.  
---
I like it! Simple but looks really cool hoping the other 3 are great aswell
---
Someone tried to do this to me and he wasnt moving, took me a while to see him but i killed him
---
Haha funny Australia upside down hur de dur
---
I live in ireland, not really jealous of how theyre obtained as i know theyre for attendees or those lucky enough to get codes but the combo is great. Ive been rocking the twitch drops 2018 invitational diamond charm and skin mainly. 
---
Yeah about the bad vision thing, the screen used to get piss yellow and was impossible to see. I think they should bring that back.
---
How did you get that one?
---
I'm gonna make sure I get the diamond one this weekend
---
Invitational Attendee charm
---
Elite skin?
---
Ayyy let's celebrate Bob Ross's death!
---
true true, but i wasnt good at any of it realistically. fragger/support/etc, i just did what my team told me without any knowledge of the "why". if i got the answer to the "why", then i still wasnt learning from MY OWN mistakes. i just kept learning from mistakes of what people told me to do, which didnt teach me much except to be scared when i had to play that spot again.
---
What would the new operators be?
---
That’s good I immediately thought of clubhouse when they did the preview screenshots. I really like the medium compact maps a lot. 
---
But where are the ground harnesses?
---
Been there...
---
Bro I gotchu right now if you want
---
I don't think he needs a nerf, he needs a counter. Like say the sound for going through electric reinforcements being loud, or an operator that can trap reinforced walls
---
Really depends on the player and map for me. I’m pretty good with glaz but not enough to be a main.  I really only select him if it’s a map that has good back lines to see into obj’s like clubhouse, coastline, etc. 
---
If you can only pick two, I say sledge and tachanka. Probably some of the most iconic siege ops
---
I like the map idea and the start screen but the name is pretty lame.
---
runouts are so easy to predict and counter. git guud 
---
God tower is awful
---
Not when they’re on the other side of the map
---
Yea but I heard the maps are too 
---
I know the feeling. 
---
Play mute and Sledge
---
That was amazing. So many times i've wanted to do that.
---
He squaked 7500 😂😂😂😂
---
that's what really drew me in when watching the gameplay reveal back in 2014, they were choosing spawn and they chose roof, then rappelled down onto it from a helicopter
---
That’s not my point. My point is that none of the other ops get a stereotypical outfit or map from release the closest is buck and the hockey mask it’s been authentic up until now. If you put sledge at release in William Wallace’s outfit I’d be exactly like I am now. Every single game featuring Aussies doesn’t feature us. It features mad max characters where it’s inappropriate it’s a tactical shooter not post apocalyptic game it’s out of place
---
Hey man I do it all the time too. I just hate it lol.
---
I’m not I’m saying that they are just putting mad max in a tactical shooter like it or not Canadians are Americans 
---
My favourite two maps. I'm excited then for this one!
---
Copper?
---
don’t start a ranked game if you can’t finish it. 
---
Bro we have a dude running around with a fucking sledgehammer in a "tactical shooter" where terrorists are trying blow buildings up and you wanna run around saying "it's out of place"... Really? 
---
Thanks. Friend
---
get lost 
---
There is no luck in the game, just forgetting about possible paths and making crucial mistakes
---
We're all human anyway
---
WELCOME, HUMAN.
---
Some ranked games take up to forty minutes, and some people have lives that might require them to be flexible. I doubt that is the case for someone that lives in their parent’s basement and plays for 13 hours a day
---
This, I agree I love him. 
---
You’re actually not allowed to post his username here. I’d just let it go and move on.
---
Hey, its janky as hell, just as he would want
---
Since they buggered up the "Gas" over Petrol/Fuel, we're going to load in the game and the driver's side is going to be incorrect for Australia.
---
Ubisoft must have gotten their research from Outback Steakhouse, the bloody aussie Simpsons episode is more accurate than that joint and Rainbow Six.
---
I’m not talking about the gadgets I’m talking about how every time an Australian gets put in media it’s never borderline accurate let alone Authentic 
---
lmaooo you’re a salty little fella. if you can’t finish a ranked match then don’t start one. it’s pretty simple 
---
r/boneappletea
---
I think Fortress is one of the more balanced of the newer maps. 3/4 bomb sites are definitely viable.
---
Siege is developed by a Canadian studio, and is published by a French publisher. I think it sucks that you feel misrepresented, but don't blanket blame Americans for something we didn't do.
---
Not to sure what you mean by the format of the invitational over PL. The only difference is it's best of 3 maps and over time where as PL is only 1 map and no over time 
---
No it's not. I never saw it.
---
Couldn't of have said if better myself. Great comment but seriously, fuck you Jäger.....it's me not you....
---
My question was basically do they use tactical realism or no?
---
I dorm have a problem with the damage felt by the claymore alone, just the fact that it killed me through an *indestructible* wall 
---
No
---
What the actual fuck is this
---
I’m not sure you understand what can happen between 15-40 minutes. It’s a lot
---
Anytime I specify I'm going to rush they pick every single trap op in the game I swear and it gets me everytime
---
Wind bastion skin
---
Damn I feel old.
---
Oh you mean the HUD settings. The players use the PL settings, they are slightly different. If you load up your HUD settings its actually an option if you want. 
---
Fuck off with politics, many people play games to avoid this shit.
---
I dont see him.
---
Australians are upside down Americans 
---
All I’m going to say is I’m pissed that Gridlock has to wear a motorcycle helmet. The last thing I want to wear when I’m going room to room clearing each corner is a helmet that obstructs a large amount of my vision. Plus it just ruins his character model in general. This game hasn’t released a decent looking operator since Vigil. 
---
then don’t play ranked kid. because you can’t understand your schedule you have to cost other people the game? maybe one day you’ll get out of copper 
---
That’s an odd way to put it tho don’t you think ? Like literally no one says this , it just seems like you blamed America for Canada’s mistakes and back pedaled because you didn’t wanna seem wrong , that’s just how it looks tho 
---
The last panel makes me so happy
---
thats the point
---
Look guys im helping pepega
---
Thanks, if it's not a bother. Could you link me to it? I want to make sure I watch the right one.
---
2 years 2 late bro, sorry. they might make seasonal skins available again in the future for a little bit, theyve done it before
---
Yeah and it’s supposedly trying to bring back an old style of playing with more decision making and destruction 
---
There he is. There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn't he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.
---
I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a girl as you once again type your little "Australia is upside down" quip. I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it's okay, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on reddit posting about a far off country. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became an "Australia is upside down" poster. A pathetic unfunny "Australia is upside down" poster. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because everything you say is "AUSTRALIA IS UPSIDE DOWN AUSTRALIA IS UPSIDE DOWN KANGAROOS LMAO". You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.

I guess you'd say they're amateur/mod hosted? You're right, Ubisoft's servers went down.

But the people [allr6.com](https://allr6.com) made a patch to basically re-add online support (and they host servers). Not sure who's behind it but it's actually legit. You can find more info if you google allr6 and Rainbow Six 3: Gold

Doc has the most fucking skins, ubi needs maverick or clash or any fucking year 2 or 3 operator skins, but they do nothing but make more skins for the fucking year one ops
---
I’m not seeing a bad idea here.
---
I've done this before I know your pain.
---
so basically a shitty remake of the plane

---
Stupid rainbow bitch wasnt paying me so i found a new job as you can tell
---
True, I can agree that the DLC ops need more skins but I'd say 80% of Doc's skins are fucking shit and he needs something that is actually appealing and not complete rubbish! 🙂
---
Ah, yes the heavenly light. But on a side note I got lucky with killing Blitz twice when I was like this.
---
This is really well done
---
The crashed truck Isn't looking very australian without a bull bar as well. You think they would have picked up on these things after looking at reference images.
---
Still a birth smh
---
That sounds really cool. Thats a great idea 
---
I feel like it seems that there's more toxicity on PC because of more communication options on PC, and there certainly is a fair bit of toxicity towards girls so if you do get Rainbow I'd say be ready to mute someone at a moment's notice but it definitely is a great game, I recently hit 600 hours and have enjoyed 90% it and my female friends who actually tried it did enjoy it too
---
IT DON'T BE REPAIRED TODAY?!
---
Xbox is a toxicity fest, PS4 is better. Never really heard any unironic toxicity towards girls tho. Unless it’s Goddess but that’s a whole other story. 
---
Aight cool thanks
---
What about the droid attack on the -wookies- I mean map
---
That would be ideal
---
what the fuck was that
---
Buy 8 cuz then you can just download more RAM off the internet for free.
---
That guy messed uuup
---
How the fuck does this upside-down garbage get 9k upvotes?
---
Siege is equally toxic to all genders.
---
TLDR: you won't get special attention but you will be teamkilled, teabagged, trolled memed etc with the rest of the players.
---
Praises SAS and plays GEO?
---
The Chewbacca Defense?
---

---
Is this a containment breach reference?
---
can confirm that xbox is a toxicity fest, in casual it's teamkilling/vote kicking half the time, in ranked it's nothing but meta abuse from mid-gold-higher. i kind of feel like this game is in a sorry state because the devs dont rly act on toxicity on anything but PC.
---
They look like fake ones tho, poses aren’t right

it's a popular symbol amongst australian hippies

The MM elo system in this game is terrible

It’s actually most likely ignorance. UBI doesn’t do a lot of research, as illustrated by the look of, and weapons of, operators post launch. So to be frank I’m surprised that they did enough to call it a service station and not a gas station. 
---
Hold up this update came out already or what?
---
Yay. another 90° map
---
This was posted on this sub just a little bit ago
---
More like any subreddit forever to be fair. Well annoying 
---
Your best bet will be to find a 5-man squad to roll with so that edgy kids/adults aren't given the chance to grief you. The siege community can be toxic in general, but you're just making yourself an easy target for some people if you speak up. I wish it wasn't that way but it's simply reality.

Hah good one I enjoyed that chuckle thank you for that.

Melee skins when?
---
Not a fan of the kill feed since it's in a different place than in my own gameplay, but the defuse plant timer/bar is A+.

omg I watched the entire day and was even watching in class for no reason. How could they forget this? and Im banned from the chat too!

You mean after or before placement matches?

Legit only reason to ever run recruit- in game power rangers low budget cosplay

Can i haz?

Heretic.

Damn iPhones

You forgot the "down"

Upvote yours too

It works perfectly well. Teams can ban operators who they find annoying, blitz is aids, lion is OP as fuck, cav is a dumb ban and clash is annoying. 
---
They're decent bans. 
---
Ops picture had Lesion banned. Who is incredibly strong and annoying.

They're good bans. So what the fuck is the issue?

An idea, if your not comfortable with using vc, is to gain some experience and gat good at the game, probably making you more respected.
---
OP, if you do get the game, I wish you the best of luck. Many aces shall come to you
---
Makes no sense. This has nothing to do with game balancing. The same could be said for heart shots. 
---
Hippy hoppety get off me property 
---
Play how you want, experiment, as long as you're having fun everything is A okay.
---
Yeah, the PS4 community is nothing but toxic from my experience so far. I get vote kicked every other match, kids screaming I suck, adults telling me to kill me, tked constantly.    
---
I just want to enjoy the game for fuck sake.
---
Cuz they’ll never fix the game so we might as well get them to fix something
---
Apparently fucking so 
---
Kk

If Australia is upside down for this season all American operators should all 1 speed 3 armour.
---
No prob big Rick! Happy hunting. 
---
I like it but nah. Hangar would be too big, but the entire ship is made of steel. Very few destructible walls or anything. I could only see this working if it was the bridge. 
---
I like GROM for dlc as well. Zofia's lmg is so underused, (I got 2 aces with it) and her gadget is also great. And I don't think I need to mention Ela

It's operation Snake's Rig.

Yo bro, this is not about nerf. This is a bug. So RIP.
---
House is great, small, tactical, not too big 
---
Yeah and the German police cars on Club House are very clearly designed by an American who didn't even bother googling.
---
And Blitz' shield skin with the text on it? Baaad German, bafflingly bad, not a single native has proofread that. 
---
No it’s just a joke used by lots of people (usually along with *teleports behind you*). Containment just used it in one of their episodes.
---
I'm sorry to hear that...
---
I'm older too by this games standards (27) - there are a lot of younger kids that really ruin the game.

It's titled misleading title. My dude

Yes please. I noticed this immediately and it's annoying to see that Ubisoft hasn't done their research. Fix please!!!!

Every detail in world building matters. This is just lazy. Yes it's a multiplayer small map match based shooter but it still shows proper design and importance of content.

U are correct!

I'm currently trying to get a group together to smash them out but it's not going well.

Good thing is that it's complete 5, not win 5, so if I can get the group together we just need to get through 5 matches. 
---
I wish I took a photo before I got the alpha back so I had the proof but I had 82% last week and I hadn't lost every game I played.
---
aight, thx boss xD
---
Who cares? Its not that big of a deal.
---
Isn't like 70+ australia empty desert?
---
Everything about the accuracy isn't right. If the American unit is supposed to be the FBI, why is the Australian CTU SASR? It just feels like Ubisoft put together a whole bunch of stereotypes and made a guess at the CTU. For reference it should be ASIS. Also the uniforms are just horrific. Even if they were SASR their uniform should be black.
---
Playing on Xbox 100% not a hacker. Just a lucky shot

NA/PC - ubi is the same as my reddit name
---
This is beautiful.
---
He's joking like the Europeans did with the aboriginal over their land etc.
---
Have you not heard about Bunnings?
---
I think that they more mean that it's stereotypical, as in, of course the Aussie map is a petrol station in the outbac, whereas other countries' maps are set in more nuanced locations. 
---
Why r u running
---
The story for the map makes sense to be where it is. And Australia is known for its deserts so an Aussie expansion would want to be recognisable 
---
Yes, sorry for spoilers but your 'gas' is a damn liquid folks 
---
No one calls petrol "gas" anywhere except USA
---
fuel ya'll
---
tag the ubi community people, epi, noty etc.

By that logic, all the french operators are three speeds, 1 armor.

I'm pretty new to R6S and I have terrible aim lol so thanks for the tip!

Oh there was a small update yesterday on my PS4 and said UI updates so it might be that

You’re just either good on console or bad in PC because PC aiming is significantly easier, and I have played for console since 2015 only switching to Oc a few months ago.

I think there’s a pretty big unanswered question from the community. Will the operators on this map have some sort of special equipment to keep them on the ground? Seeing as we’re on the bottom of the plant idk how they won’t fall off without some equipment of some kind.
---
same.
---
they should delete this challenges 
---
ask them what? you have to know the question before you can ask a question. 
---
Ubisoft is based in Montreal a city that half the time doesn't even speak the same language as the rest of their country and you're expecting them to know yours.
---
No, you’re using the same account

Then leave

I can lower the settings to medium or low, that’s now problem, cheers :)

Knife and spray. Move from his left to his right, wait for him to make a wrong move and shoot him.

Dont get crazy with the preliminary groups, the charm challenge only counts during the last 3 days (Fri-Sat-Sun)

Do we even say roadhouse? It’s not really a term I’ve come across in Qld too often. It’d be a servo. 
---
Thanks. It’s not perfect but it’s the basis of an effective rework

The Australian one looks like the British plug but upside-down, drunk and squinting. Accurate.

Ah yes, I love it when people are immune to lesion mines and frost traps when crouching. I also love it when ankle high kapkan traps don't trigger when someone goes through at crouch height. Aren't Ubisoft games great?

I didn't like Ela when she was overpowered, it kinda didn't feel fair. But now I like her but the only thing I'd change is less left and right recoil on the Scorpian, I feel burst firing is a must, even with a compensator on.

Overall both are great operators I love to bits, the Bosak sisters will always get my pick.

Well, imho, your best options are to guard the objective and just either taze your opponent until they die, (I believe Clash's shield does 5 damage per second, with a range of 12 meters, but it only can run 5 seconds before it needs to be recharged, so probably best to fire in short bursts, and of course, don't let the attacker melee you, otherwise they can shoot your exposed leg.) or hope to get an edge in a firefight with your machine pistol.

Australian ops?
---
Well considering there's a lot of them, Recruits would fit well, but who would be Jerry? Hmm...maybe Buck? Trying to throw grenades but failing is kinda like the golf thing for Jerry? Beth could be Ash. Summer might be I dunno...Dokkaebi? Ela?
---
These are just guesses. I'd say Recruit would fit well with Mr. Meeseeks since he's the only op that can be multiple of.
---
No worries

Yes I am familiar, had to get a voltage adapter and that makes sense but by now you could just regulate the voltage through the plug in atleast that seems feasible.. I doubt the female and male bits really have that big of an impact on the voltage

---
Few things, I like the idea of using that out building as extra space. I think there should be a hatch on the top going in. I also think the extra storage space should be moved flush with the back stair well and move the door to the to the side facing the alley. Then there should be a soft wall garage for stock receiving that would lead right into the stock room. Doing this should limit the defenders ability to use that side door to peek at attackers looking into Bakery Kitchen.

The new map is, according to Devs, inspired by Coastline and Oregon, so all seems good! They know what they need to be doing right!  
---
They need to rework Villa to be more Attacker friendly though.
---
I play a lot of casual, and I've never had that? 
---
I know
---
Pretty clear what got you a warning though
---
Have you tried solo queueing and *asking people who are already online* to add you?
---
Make friends. It's that simple.
---
You need to be able to strategize and be a team player. Do not go in expecting a counter-strike type of game.
---
Alright buddy,
---
I sold my CSGO knife to buy r6, and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. I’ve invested 2k hours into this game and love it.
---
Here’s the best way to get into it:
---
Realize: YOU WILL DIE. A LOT. Expect to. This ain’t to cod shooter where you get shot 1000 times then regent your health, it’s tactical. Communicate with your team, scavenge for information, and coordinate a well planned attack to defense utilizing hundreds of unique gadgets, special for each operator.
---
Now that I’ve intimidated you, let’s start. Go to play -&gt; situations -&gt; and start with the first one. These provide very good information to how to play the game and what to expect. Watch the whole video each time, then play it slow, utilizing what it teaches you.
---
You completed every situation? Good, that’s great. Now it’s time to get serious... t-hunt. Play some terrorist hunt, learn the ins and outs of every map, practice your aim and gadgets. 
---
You know every map decently well? You can make callouts? Awesome. Now we’re getting serious: casual. 
---
This is gonna be hard. It’s new. It’s pretty self explanatory though. You’ll learn by playing. 
---
Everything that I utilize to make me Plat 1 I’ve learned from other people. Watch your kill cams, see what they did, see what you fucked up. Fix it. They killed you from a cool angle in the garage? Try it out next round. Didn’t know you could throw a c4 there? Now you do. It’s all about learning. 
---
Ranked will come when you need it to. Don’t worry about it now. Focus on learning.
---
Good luck, it’s worth the work. 
---
Censorship saves the day one again
---
"Australian"
---
It’s the force..
---
You'll be spending a lot of time in T Hunt. You can also use a free website called aimbooster.com to practice reflex outside the game. Take the time to find your perfect aim sensitivity and stick with it. Finding your perfect mouse is also optimal so I recommend watching RocketJumpNinja on YouTube for mouse reviews. That's all I offer at the moment. I'm sure a better player will have more helpful tips
---
Its not weird bullshit. Its the way people speak in the place they are trying to recreate. So they can take the fucking trouble to do it properly.
---
Hello AlphaSaintX412, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aptk9b/operation_blood_dragon/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
did you win the last round tho
---
Tachanka's turret is awesome bait too. 
---
Well, whats your FPS and whats the refreshrate of your monitor?
---
Try V-sync or something similar
---
It used to be low. This was a while ago now it’s high
---
I’m working on the top floor currently however it’s really hard unless you extend that upper floor balcony all the way across and change a lot of the lay out. I’m trying to find a way to keep it as similar as possible, while making it a lot more balanced. But yeah, it’s solid
---
Literally unplayable
---
My usual squad started playing Apex Legends too, so I've been trying to look for someone who is fine with me still being new to the game and won't flip out when they realise I'm a girl 😂
---
I find your sense of "fun" disturbing. Sorry.
---
Due for a upgrade in 2 weeks thankfully 
---
Okay so, first you stick to one kind of DPI. Mine is set to 800.  
---
Now you go to Rainbow 6 sensitivity settings and change it so that your character does a 180 degree turn (Turns around exactly) when you drag the mouse over to one side of your mousepad. Also turn off mouse acceleration in game and in Windows mouse settings (Google it if you don't know where it is)  
---
Now you go to Terrorist hunt, hard difficulty, switch your gun to semi auto and then start taking headshots only. This is how you build aim.  
---
Also CSGO is free. Download it, download a couple of aim maps, use that to practise as well.
---
Atleast i can take a joke lmao
---
The problem with this is that it doesn't let me connect to the match so I have to leave it just keeps me in soectation for the whole match 
---
Switzerland, Austria,Argentina and Portugal is more important. Sry

Current is just voltage divided by resistance so a lower voltage would mean a lower current surely?

No one call petrol "gas" in Australia. (calls\*) If you're gonna correct them correct your english first....

Is this what it is like to have a seizure?

Email ubi maybe? best i can think
---
In Mexico they say Gas

The direction of spin should change with the seasons anyway.
---
The two things annoy me with Villa are the whole of basement being pretty much unused in bomb and the sound isn’t great (But I’ve noticed a lot of sound issues since the latest update)
---
You do realize that a company taking a certain stance it irrelevant in a discussion of how things could/should be, right?

Did you even read my post? Or just what you wanted to see to become enraged?  My point was console should allow native m/kB support, including the games released for it, like pc does. I also clearly stated that currently using a mouse and keyboard is considered cheating. And as a side note, I don’t understand how ubi can call it cheating, but do nothing about it. There stance on the subject is report it to Sony or Microsoft, companies which offer m/kB licensee emulators and don’t consider their use against TOS.

&gt; * PC: 11:00 EST / 16:00 UTC
---
&gt; * PS4: 11:30 EST / 16:30 UTC

When is new season coming out? 
---
Join a Discord! Usually YouTubers have discord channels with lots of players in them. I’ve made a few friends that way too! 
---
Oh yeah. They even have the infamous window that the ATF breached on the roof and got their asses shot up.
---
Can confirm that you need to be in the lobby with all 5, it doesn't work if you click "keep playing as a team" after the game ends you need to invite them
---
It would probably scare the Polish operators more
---
I was aiming more for a stroke ☹️🔫
---
48 hours or less and you need 25 hours for the charm
---
Low-key not worth the effort
---
300 iq play
---
Yes i did! 
---
Literally how Montagne should be played
---
usually some of their voice actors fake their accents because ubi can't seem to hire proper native speakers from their country.
---
That is some good pasta
---
Fun fact: Iran also uses the European outlet.
---
And Turkey too, I think... But not sure about that one.
---
That's always my first thought, but then you gotta think that the other guy died to that.
---
“U R gay?”
---
[removed]
---
It's the only way some people communicate on console. 
---
Okay but could it be your hardware? Im running specs below minimum requirements and it usually works but i assume that when it crashes it is because of that
---
Ha.
---
Putting enmity behind in times of need. I get it.
---
Definitely possible.
---
That’s what I’m saying it should show the matches of today
---
That was cinematic as fuck
---
If by point notifications you are referring to what pops up at the side then these prove helpful for some people. 
---
For example I can kill someone and begin to move away before realising the "carrier denied" notification popped up so I go back and defend the defuser. 
---
Or if I randomly spray through a wall it will let me know I have injured someone. 
---
Right? Me, who has never missed any Charm, gave a pass on this one completely. It's just not worth it.
---
Sometimes when I have issues, I can go to the website ([club.ubisoft.com](https://club.ubisoft.com)) and collect them from there.
---
Operation shit fuck shit
---
Assholes vote kick simply because they can. Why this feature is still in the game is beyond me.
---
It’s a wonderful thing.
---
Ohhhh yeaaaa
---
Circuits generally have a maximum amperage for safety reasons, so a socket thats setup for 15amps @ 120is 1800watts, a 15 amp circuit @ 230 is 3450 watts, thats a lot more energy for heating water.
---
It’s happenimg since y1s1,some players got rhe black ice bundle and they have missing some skins,needs to be adressed..
---
It’s in casual there’s none
---
But people are still really salty 
---
I looked it up and the style is completely different aswell
---
You alone will save his statistics 
---
Make ubi rethink the rework 
---
You are the champion of the Lord 
---
Praise be unto thee 
---
That hurt to watch
---
Im a 214 player, used to be super hyped about this game and even tho it lasted for over 1400 hours I just don’t enjoy it the way I used to, don’t get me wrong is a great game, but most of my friends are playing something else, got bored or don’t even play anymore, so yeah, finding 4 people it’s quite annoying, and the only night I did had a full squad, there’s this bug where it sounds as if someone left the game but the 5 of us where there, only counted one for the challenge even if we played a whole overtime in R.I playlist 
---
OP never said he was underrated, just that he didn't have either of the Para Bellum ops.
---
That douche bag Finka. I love it 
---
Yup, luckily Xbox has an easy way to just find people going for the charm.  Although my connection is trash and the game likes to kick me when I hit a lag spike.
---
So this challenge is an extreme pain in the ass for me.  Had to get it though because I love Chinese new year stuff.
---
We must make a religion about the lord and savior Tachanka.
---
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.
---
Just watch, it only counts from Feb 15-17 IIRC
---
It's confirmed were getting this in game? Not just spectator mode?
---
Why are you showing me this lmao
---
Need Mozzie driving a ute
---
He had nothing to lose, also he would have guaranteed loss if he'd stopped defusing due to the time left.
---
Actually it was Ranked. 
---
No it's not,he has to die now.
---
you’re pretty dense aren’t you. you said this game has a low player count when there are over 40 million players. they are free rewards because you get them for just playing the game how you normally would. you have to pay nothing for them. you’re acting entitled like you should get more for doing less when you don’t know anything about the game

Open a support ticket they helped me out a lot. We don't give them nearly enough credit.

There is a third sensitivity option that you probably have set extremely high. If you look lower in the options menu it’s there. It’s for sensitivity while scoped in. Usually most people keep this higher than the regular sensitivity (as do I). 👍🏼
---

---
You ever drink hard water? Minerals gives it the goodeth tasté
---
It's not confirmed. This is only spectator mode UI.
---
Honestly of the maps since blood orchid only villa has been some what rememberable and actually decent. 
---
Even though its huge it still plays like some of the smaller maps because it doesn't have a bunch of blind corners, doesn't have a bunch of easy to pull of spawn peaks (still has more then smaller maps but not as bad as like themepark), it plays well on every gamemode, and lastly all the long halls and large rooms just makes it seem like one of the smaller maps
---
Only about half the maps used at one time but that's the only major complaint I can think of about it. 
---
I'm hoping that this year we can get more large maps like villa that despite being large actually seem worth playing.
---
Side note I dont hate fortress to much ether the only problems I can think with it is it has a lot of possibilities towards blind corners, a lot of the objectives have a lot of destructible walls and like most the large maps half of it doesn't get used
---
I swear it feels different/better on Sledge than a Thatcher. You might also have just gotten used to a different operators gun, so your recoil muscle memory is off.
---
Thank God a rational explanation. Thanks, Forge. 
---
“It’S eChOlOcAtIoN!” never explained anything. 
---
Yup, that is exactly what I meant by that. 
---
Nope not by a long shot try a cassowary.
---
 Thanks to Prodigio Pete for making a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9f81L6g6Qo) about this. 
---
Fookin lazer soights is bang on, actually. All the SAS accents are perfect. 
---
All of this sounds good, though I think it’s a bummer they’re reintroducing Renown costs for the Legacy Operators. Really feels like they should all be available to everyone by default. I thought that was a great change for the game.
---
You can stop worrying about grenades coming up.
---
Yeah Mav is another dude who I can do well, but haven't played him much in a month. Early grim sky, I used to do really well, but after I started dropping in ranks when soloqueuing, I reduced my roster to cap, buck and nomad only.
---
Mav is so frikking versatile. I can guarantee you that he'll see a Nerf soon, alongside nomad.
---
What in tarnation.
---
Oops, my bad. Thank you!
---
Confused with all this stuff.  All I know is I bought the game used on amazon years ago for $18.  
---
Though optionally, for fun, I've probably spent around $150-$200 or so on elites, costumes, and new characters as they are released.  
---
Stopped buying the COD games years and years and years ago when they introduced jet packs and jumping 20 ft in the air.  Even spending $200, this game has overall saved me money vs. buying the newest COD each year @ $60 a pop.  
---
Y4 related: Has anyone seen any leaks for the Y4S1 Seasonal Skins? I've got some renown saved and trying to decide if I want a Y3S4 skin or wait for the next season.
---
Happy cake day
---
No probs! Happy to help you.
---
looks a wee bit fragile 
---
We were hoping that the Microsoft paint one would make people realize how saturated this was getting but they're still being upvoted. 
---
We don't like changing rules every time something gets a little over saturated as we'd like to just see these kinds of things run their course and lose favorability. We'll be keeping close eye on it though based on the feedback we're seeing in this thread. 
---
Much wow 
---
11/10 delivery 
---
Mad clap
---
Typo I believe, it's saids 600 Renown. It should say 600 R6 Credits when describing the Gold Edition.
---
Its an accurate representations of a chef sprinkling toppings on to a pizza, 90% of the "used toppings" dont actually go on to the pizza. 
---
Unless there is another way i can give you the 15 dollars
---
No because you can literally do this as a shield 
---
What happens to the users who had the Starter Edition? 
---
Hmmm, ~~Logan~~ Mozzie looks 4 armor
---
And i see Grodlock[ riding that emu](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/apumjc/gridlock_riding_an_emu/) in background
---
I got into this game after my buddy gifted me the game and I never got around to playing it. Finally gave it a try and it’s super fun but hard to get good at which to me is fun. Thanks for this giveaway man
---
Maverick is the first operator I bought (out of all the « primary » ones)
---
He feels really rewarding to play with and it is so much fun when you get that sweet double-kill through a hole.
---
I’m personally looking for an operator that brings you a lot of fun, no matter how well you perform with him.
---
Well my parts are from 2012 and barely a medium end PC.
---
Very happy they’re dropping prices on older operators, gonna be sweet!
---
In before the inevitable complaints:
---
"Starter Edition should've come with the base operators to begin with!"
---
"I spent 5000 hours unlocking all the operators and NOW you give everyone the base operators for free?!"
---
&gt;Reintroducing Progression for Legacy Operators
---
&gt;For new players and Starter Edition owners who have been upgraded to the base game, they will see the return of the progression system for unlocking the original 20 Legacy Operators. Legacy Operators will cost 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 Renown based on how many Operators from a specific CTU you have unlocked.
---
If I'm reading this right, players that get the standard edition won't have the base 20 unlocked by default anymore. I wonder how that affects someone that got the Standard edition a week ago.
---
No Pro League skins for Clash yet.
---
Ubi already said they are gonna fix it before launch, they got it 
---
happy cake day
---
Oh god, here comes all the people thinking they're entitled to renown refunds. 
---
Exactly zero agents?
---
Don’t play casual if you don’t like it.
---
You are the biggest potato I have ever seen
---
That rage quit is up to 11 because of the gun falling after the player's sudden deconstitution.
---
Yes only recruit when i get into a game
---
They need to shorten the ban timer to 15-20 seconds.  
---
Also I don't think it's fair to play one side for 3 rounds in a row because it causes the situation sometimes where a team that dominates at defense or attack only has to win 1 round on their weak side to win the game.  With mixed rounds it gives the other team a better chance to get some wins in before the match is unfairly decided early.
---
Also, the ban system highlights which ops need an obvious rework.
---
Watch the tutorials, they should supply you with enough Renown to buy one operator. You will also have enough to buy one more after 2 or 3 matches.
---
But the only other option is ranked i just wanna have fun
---
Ubisoft has plans for 10 Years with 100+ operators in the game before it is done. Year 4 starts next month.
---
Could you look at price tags in Unlock Operator menus?
---
Convection bake &gt; anything else
---
Aren’t special ops have to be fit, or am i missing something?
---
It’s a bunch of French Canadians making the game don’t be too down if they don’t know Australian lingo 
---
My guess is that it's a Super Shorty.
---
with my luck it probably won't stick to the wall and I will end up killing myself with the nitro.
---
Are we looking at another potential 1 speed, 3 armor?
---
Use them then
---
Whattttt that sounds more like your game files might be corrupt. Do you play on uplay or steam ?
---
Only way I could think of is a picture of the card’s code.
---
She will be a thicc trap because guys will call her thicc but she looks like a man so it would be gay
---
Yup.
---
Pretty much the only reason I'd ever consider moving to America.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/apw0vd/blog_post_upcoming_changes_to_editions_year_4/ btw
---
who plays twitch with a shotgun?!lol
---
This is sounds nice and all but What about Advance Edition users? 
---
Wait. Are new edition rules already in place?
---
And the problem with that is?
---
yeah, nobody gives a shit
---
Looks like it.
---
OMG IT HAPPENED. My starter got upgraded this is amazing.  I’m so happy rn. I already have all the ops but still, this is great!
---
Have fun in ranked, its an electronic medal that resets every season, not a big deal.
---
Isn’t the standard edition supposed to give you the base agents? 3 of my friends also bought it and got all base operators
---
How its weatier than cas
---
Zofia
---
just get friends 4Head
---
I think it's rather exciting but I can see the argument against more observational tools. Lucky we will have pick and ban if it all goes wrong.
---
Cheers!
---
Wasnt it to mock with this viral of fan-made operations?? 
---
New Year 4 Edition launched earlier today with changes. Unlocking the base operators really isn't too bad so don't worry about it.
---
3 armor for sure, and looks really cartoony.
---
Looks like a sawed off ithaca with a pistol grip.
---
Is there anywhere I can go to get confirmation on this ? And how will I know if I received the year 4 pass
---
For me it looks like 1 speed and 1 armor, she does not have any good armor on her
---
imo it's not much of a nerf since they get me with a headshot most times already, even when peeking, which is what's getting under my skin about them the most
---
The only picks I saw playing casual with &amp; against Diamond (&amp; "Copper IV") players were ops with ACOGs. I'm not entirely sure how to combat that since picking Glaz just gets me kicked by those toxic losers. Works well against run-outs &amp; peeks, but they don't seem to understand that.
---
I thought they were supposed to be better at the game than I am, at that rank.
---
So, just because your team doesn’t have fun doesn’t mean you can’t, some of my best matches in ranked are when I’m just having fun, one match i random queued ranked and dropped and 11 kill as recruit. Enjoy yourself.
---
 The great emu war...
---
Good man
---
The algorithms changed literally today. The standard edition got cheaper, but you now have to unlock operators individually. 
---
When will the sale happen? 
---
Could you check if you have Magma weapon skin in your inventory?
---
I love Rainbow Six because it is a whole different experience than other games I have played. Sometimes it can be much more tactical than others, but overall, it's a very good experience. I can learn to have fun with my teammates and enemies alike, and make some memorable moments.
---
Even if I don't win, thanks for doing this giveaway man :)
---
Clutching the round and killing the opponent is never a mistake though 
---
Please refer to the video lol 
---
Yessss, so happy, you should have to grind to get ops, it builds experience too.
---
You did fine 
---
I will check when I’m home ! But I don’t know if the changes are now already 
---
Glad see ppl use the Ubisoft club app
---
Le Chanka maymay Xd

[I'm sorry but what in the hell are you calling low effort!?!](https://imgur.com/qv64vUU)
---
Ok but so are gameplay clips and most of the discussions about balance on this subreddit. 
---
The point of a subreddit is to share content related to siege. If some dedicated fans wanna go out of thier way to create full 3D level concepts and operator icons with some quality behind them then those should be welcomed. 
---
It's images with some text slapped on them that are lame.
---
No pl for shotguns
---
How do you get that icon by your name
---
Super Shorty? Taking me back to BF4, Ubi. Love it
---
Maybe then people will play as a team, Jolly Cooperation!
---
solid plays dude
---
Ubisoft is the absolute worst about holding onto digital content.  I fought them for 5 days at the beginning of this year to get Rayman Origins back in my library, after I paid for it back in 2015.  Idk what their deal is, and their customer support is actually atrocious.  Plus through my interaction I found out they actually don't keep a log of your purchase history, meaning they cannot trace whether you own their digital content, which blows because it disappears so often.
---
I go most days of the week cause I live nearby, was swimming with a 3.8M great shark the other day, only found out when I got home it was 100-200m away from the shore.
---
Most stuff here isn’t really a risk, especially because we’re all aware of it, it’s ingrained into us to be careful of snakes when bushwalking etc when we’re kids. Or lookout for black widow spiders when lifting pallets because they like tight spaces.
---
and a pretty old one too
---
Of I tried to do this the enemy would just shoot through the shield and kill me
---
Mozzie snorted some kangaroo powder
---
As a person who almost has all the ops on console and bought the starter edition on pc, seeing this made me cry.
---
sorted by new so have an upvote
---
You feel like if they buff the concept of a 3 armour that would being some interest, I thought one of Matimo's Sunday mailbox spoke on the topic.
---
*cries knowing I’ll never get 3 ministers set up*
---
But it was just Kaid and Maestro. But that’s in a whole year. Am I missing something? That still makes up less than 1/3 of the ops in Y3. 
---
ying, ela is garboo 
---
Not that bad tho
---
I played the alpha, the beta, and bought the game day 1, but I could have never predicted how far R6 would have gone. 2 months into release I figured the game was going to be a flop, thank goodness I was wrong. 
---
very true
---
You should be using the cams, and callouts to get the jump on the enemy. 
---
The information she can gather is worth more than her gun, that’s why it’s weak.
---
Oldie but a Goodie
---
That's console! 
---
Yeah, I just launched today and I'm getting some intermittent lag every few seconds even in menus. I'm on PC though. 
---
Lmao. Secure, bronze gameplay, breaching charge on blitz, how much more copper can this get?
---
You make it sound like they're decoding the dead sea scroll. Ask a few gamercentric people of the nation you're recreating and ask them to have a look around the map and point out anything out of place. Hell, ask /r/Rainbow6.
---
Not difficult or even expensive.
---
Looks like it got enough now, so that's good.
---
Was going to put “gameplay” but I felt like mods wouldn’t be happy with that. This is basically gameplay. this is gameplay 
---
JAGER V2?
---
Happy cake dayy
---
my experience with console is that people are *hungry* for their kills, and will stop at nothing to get them, even if it means that they die from someone else
---
no u both
---
I agree, I didn't mean to say that they should be removed, just that both ends of the quality spectrum are pretty much as useless. Both's only purpose is to entertain the fans and both get hundreds of upvotes.
---
Well if you've never missed any charm , that means you've done other charms that had the exact same requirements if not more challenging. Example would be the Lenovo challenge
---
...I just finished buying all of the ops last week. That was 20$ and hundreds of hours that now feel wasted lol. Happy my friends can get more ops now though!
---
That would be sweet!
---
That’s not how percentages work. Let’s compare:
---
Pretend rook armor makes you take 50% damage. 
---
1 shot that would do 50 damage now does 25
---
5 shots that would do 10 damage each now do 5 damage each, so 25 total. 
---
This is called the distributive property of mathematics. 
---
i’m ashamed to know you 
---
Intel is the most important thing in siege. 
---
I would take the renown so I could buy me all those Alpha packs the other people could afford... and get myself some good old duplicates
---
Well it's nice that there showing the ranks now
---
Idk but 30 hours is not right (too long).I takes me about 10-15 hours to get 25000 (not including boosters) and about 5-7 to get 12500
---
HOLY SHIT GO AHEAD AND DOWNVOTE ME BUT WHAT IS THAT AIM
---
Hahahahaa u legend
---
Tf did I just watch. 
---
Whats Legacy operators ?
---
My playgroup got together to get that charm, but one had internet issues so we could never complete a round as a team. RIP
---
For me the indicators are usually the yellow three bars followed up by the yellow bars turning red and a red plug showing up 
---
You never play mute or smoke? Sounds like you need to learn anchor
---
Look at the announcement today - the base edition of the game is available on PC for $20.00, but will *not* be coming to console. Instead, console players are only given the option to purchase the Deluxe edition of the game.
---
This is great.
---
What weapons have bad iron sights, I prefer them over a reflex and on some maps, even an ACOG
---
Except for ash, jesus those are bad
---
Doesn't change the fact that there will only be the Deluxe edition on consoles.
---
🦀Starter edition is gone🦀
---
Also pretty nice that they upgraded all starter edition people for free! I upgraded to standard during the steam winter sale is December so it's a bit late for me but it's great for literally everyone else.
---
Those might be connection issues. Check your internet and stuff. I was able to fix my problem by just restarting my PC
---
Cav got greedy and wanted the interrogation. Probably told teammates not to kill him. 
---
Yeah for bomb it's really good.
---
It doesn't work because it's not supposed to work. If you get ranked in rainbow to work how it should, please tell me what satanic ritual you had to do before hand, and how many goats I need to sacrifice to the Lord and savior TaCHUNKa. It does suck how bad ranked is rn. Take this as a good luck charm *hands over paper-mache replica of the Lord's Artifact charm*
---
P90 isn't any old SMG.  It has a 51 round magazine.
---
What about advanced edition?  
---
# "Am I a Joke To You?"
---
Tachanka is really bad though. An ACOG would be a good enough buff for him to be at least semi viable until he gets an actual rework 
---
Roadmap has already been revealed, no Uruguay
---
Thanks for clarifying your point. What percentage of missed shots is a potato aim because what I see is not but the video you posted is def tater 
---
Grind

U need to keep grinding sry

Hello Play3rJiP! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
Kaid is a new operator so he’s not allowed to be picked in pro league, he’s still their to be picked they just are t allowed to use him which leads me to believe it was a miss click 
---
It's good, but they always ban the same ops. Echo is banned 80%, Maestro and Mira too. Lion and Blitz are the most banned in the attack, before Dokkaebi and Thermite.
---
Where’s the vigil wall paper
---
needs more chest in general. Actually she just needs more everything 
---
Can i not just buy the complete edition and add it to my ubi account?
---
CCCCCCCCCCC
---
The mp5 is like the definition of "any old SMG" though.
---
He’s decent maybe let him place his traps faster
---
I have, on several occasions, sternly told my squadmates to not BM for this reason. It just creates losing scenarios. Just finish the round and move on. 
---
Glad y’all got the win! 
---
Valk’s gun is good. It shoots fast and has no recoil. It may kill slow, but anyone with a good aim can make it work great. Her ability is SUPER strong. She doesn’t need a really good gun too. She’s a support operator. 
---
But wait, so that means that new players that buy the standard edition will have to buy the legacy operators? or only the ones who upgrated.

Sensitivity is something that is purely subjective. Asking for other people's opinions or their sensitivity won't really help you as it's entirely up to you. I play 500 dpi 7/7/45, but there are heaps of people who play their ADS sens at 100. Overall though, a lower sens is typically the way to go considering you can always buy a larger mousepad to quickly flick you mouse to turn around whilst still being precise. It also comes down to just practise at aimming reguardless of sens.
---
Far Cry 4 &lt;3
---
The shotgun is a great tool for pushes and the smg has a high recoil but it's menage able.
---
U can throw smoke against the floor in front of a wall the smoke will go through the wall but not the surface it lays on that is a decent way of damage players 
---
It's like buying something for $50 and then seeing it go on sale like, *a year later* and asking for a refund. How do these people not realize how ridiculous they're being?
---
Yeah, for sure, also feel like since the shield is in front on the barrel it should reduce the vertical recoil just a bit with shield equipped.
---
It has a compatible rail for an ACOG. 
---
And nobody says “twot” in England, but we still have Clash
---
The shotty smg combo is very hard to use ever since the nerf. I don’t really recommend smoke anymore. 
---
And then Mozzie can re-hack the overridden drones?
---
Cano Serrado
---
YEE YEE WE DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR FUNNY BACKWARDS SPEAK KANGAROO RANGLER HERE IN THE U S OF A WE CALL IT GAS
---
i lost doc operation health headgear
---
Then don't try to rationalize yourself when people prove your idiocy. 
---
Smoke is great for entry denial so when you know someone’s gonna go through a door or hatch throw ONE gas grenade. He is more useful in ranked due to the late push most players do. Just play him some and learn his recoil pattern.
---
BTW: use his primary smg it has little to no recoil and has a good time to kill.
---
i'm a complete newbie, jumping in because my roommate likes to play.
---
can someone give a shot from the hip guess on who the favorites are, so i can watch  the 4 "best" teams' matches prior to the playoff stage?
---
i don't have time to watch 20 hours of coverage per day, but want to watch a few matches in advance.
---
thanks guys
---
Never seen a finer definition of Bamboozling...
---
Oh you mean the modern day dinosaur... yeah fuck those things. 
---
I would recommend the dual SMG setup. Roaming works pretty good with Smoke, but thats up to you.
---
Do ppl on Pc have grind for origonal ops?
---
Isn’t grindlock the drone blocker 
---
I have so many questions and I am so confused
---
I consistently see console Siege for under 20 euros at game stores. Though I'm not sure about the digital side
---
No, it's still Standard Edition. Look at the Steam page.
---
Thanks. Coulda swore it was nerfed but I guess not!
---
Thanks. I thought it was nerfed.

There was a Valentines day weapon skin last year that was unlocked by a Challenge. No way to get it now.
---
I mean even if I'm rude their support staff should still do their job. If they are decideding to do their job purely based on pleases and thank yous then no we should not give them more credit. Lol
---
Americans repeat the 'upside down' joke over and over and they think it's funny every time.
---
In my opinion, i think that it's more likely to be Argentina.
---
I know, i know.. the sun beams correspond to the Uruguayan Sol De Mayo but:
---
(All of this assuming that this Sun means that we are getting new ops from south america in the seasson 2)
---
1- If we consider that we know by fact that new CTUs boosts the sales on the CTU´s nacionality country, then we can argue that Argentina has a larger population than Uruguay. I think that there is no sense to realease operators from Uruguay if you have a 12 times larger population country next to it.
---
2- Probably, the guy/s that made this part of the map didn´t know the different between the two differents "designs" of the sun so they just took up what they thougt it was "cooler" for the map desing. Probably they had a similar problem when they choose "Gas" insted of "Fuel" for the Australian map.
---
An other posibility is that, taking in account that Uruguay and Argentina are two REALLY similar countries (The same kind of similiarity between a state of USA from an other state), they would decide to realise one OP from Argentina and an other one from Uruguay
---
Good job
---
That's also a really generic sun design, but possible
---
I don't know anything about a nerf but when was it? 
---
fat*
---
And yet, the lower half of England is coloured differently to signify that Clash is from a different CTU. Really wouldn’t have been difficult to leave Wales, and Ireland in its entirety blank.
---
Someone turn this upside pls 
---
Hope thsts not a seasonal skin because it looks like ass
---
This gave me cancer...
---
Nah, what needs to stop is getting thrown into a 2nd round game EVERY fucking time I solo q in casual, I'm not gonna gonna play ranked without friends, so I'm fucking sick of this bullshit.
---
Ok, I'm done now.
---
you said “other leaks” and “picture” when they are the same, do you really think that that picture shows a viable gadget? its easily spottable i dont think ubi would add it
---
Coastline’s pretty big, home slice

Ask and you shall receive

I THOUGHT there was one awhile ago. Like when his LMG was nerfed. I guess I was wrong though.
---
Lol
---
There’s a GRIDLOCK on the chat in rainbow6
---
Was absolutely worth 2 bucks 😂
---
You knew exactly what you were buying, and agreed to buying it, you even signed and accepted a form that agreed to all of Ubi's terms of services. 
---
You have no reason to be refunded for anything. You have not lost anything like with them removing the ACOG from SMG-11, 416-C and MP7, where you actually lost the ACOG and therefore the renown. So, there is no reason be refunded for anything as you still have everything you paid and agreed for.

9 ball is a game. 8 ball, or snooker are more popular elsewhere. im unsure if 9 ball was made in roo land or not.
---
I flex on them by shooting their peasant drones
---
Basically yes. If you've already completed the long grind of unlocking all of the original operators in the Starter Edition, then the Regular Edition doesn't give you anything new.
---
Wdym, this is Mira’s view so its not the black part, view this as if it was inside OBJ
---
The r36 started early I see. 
---
* One less EDD, but the EDDs do more damage (50/60/70 instead of 40/50/60)
---
* Thinner character model/smaller hitbox since he's not a 3 armor anymore
---
its dark gray transparent from inside
---
It was a joke but he was also trying to prove a point. 
---
It's really not hard and I'm surprised at the amount of people who have trouble with it.
---
On PC, click the flair button in the sidebar and select the one you want. On mobile, click the 3 dots in the top right and then click "Change user flair".
---
Yeah don't know that and I play him a lot 
---
They reduced all the prices to 500(1st op of the ctu) 1000 (2nd) third 1.500 fourth 2000 for the standard ops you should not have gotten them for free tho 
---
use the fmg9 with p226 suppressed while roaming
---
Kill trading is a bit silly sometimes
---
Nah it isn’t legendary 
---
They changed the way it works. Starter edition no longer exists. The sub should have info on the change somewhere 
---
We need some South Africans.
---
Again, it’s a leak, from a early dev build of the game. It could be changed or tweaked before launch. But this is what we have so far. 
---
The glass or frame
---
Aw :(
---
What
---
Responded to the wrong person, lol.
---
Nah. Arent they already brechable by those ops?
---
again what was the other leak besides the picture and names
---
Whooosh
---
Whoops, lemme fix that
---
Oh shit, I just read the post and it said all starter edition people got a free upgrade to standard! I love u I
---
Tinfoil skin gang rise up

South Americans too. We need more people from the Southern Hemisphere in general

Looks like a SPAS-12 a bit, but probably isn’t

Didn't they say they weren't going to elite all of 5he S.A.S members?

Will starter edition owners get a refund for all the ops they bought for 12500?

A.b.s.o.l.u.t.e.l.y. O.u.t.p.l.a.y.e.d.

Yes, the MP5 is a relatively old gun that still functions. Glad someone else noticed. /s
---
OP is playing on console, that's why he was saying console siege.
---
I don’t doubt their ability I just think it’s more likely this an alpha pick skin or a skin that simply will never be released to the public 
---
I don’t know. It’s a bug I think. Happens to me too
---
Alright in my defense I couldn't even think of something that tachanka would do, Everyone else there was just easy pickings

R6 cosplay is generally very easy to do since its mostly tacticool gear.

How do white bar

Sir! My bullets seem to not work! This water pistol isn’t enough firepower!

(Monty looks mildly annoyed and slightly wet now)
---
How much renown were operators for people on normal/not starter version?
---
I'm honestly waiting for these jokes
---
I feel like I’m the only person on this sub who doesn’t have a 3D printer
---
never played it actually. Nice comeback by the way. Have fun with puberty. 
---
I am not a huge fan of the challenges that require you to play as an OP you dont have, I have no idea if everyone gets the exact same challenges but as a newer player without too much free time these fun weekly challenges give me something fun to aim for while also getting a small little bonus making it a slight bit easier to unlock more ops with the extra 1500ish possible renown. But when you cant do 2-3 of them because they require you to play as someone you dont have you lose out on that small chunk of renown and a fun challenge. 
---
I read it at tater tots... which she should have as well... they’re good... I’m hungry.

Cosmetics! I spent about 150k recently on some new cosmetics for some operators.

Lol, my dad calls tater tots "potato nuggets" and I have no desire to call them anything else but that anymore.

slow news day huh?
---
God my first match was on Favela and I absolutely hated it, I thought I would love it because back in MW2 Favela was my favorite map but in siege it just feels too tight/verticle and I feel like I never saw anyone.
---
No one can give an exact percentage. It's just based on the eye test. If the kill was not done in an efficient manner--wasting a considerable number of bullets while shooting--it's a potato situation. If the kills is clean and efficient--wasting minimal bullets--it's not a potato situation.

This is way better than a motorcycle

I give a nice person the same customer service as a rude person because it's my job to give good customer service not only give good custmer service to those I deem worthy of it.
