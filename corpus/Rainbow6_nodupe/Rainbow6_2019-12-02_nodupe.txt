Clashes shield says bikini meaning Bikinibodhi
---
Yes! It was awesome
---
Hes speaking facts though. They cant do anything about it without boosters exploiting it
---
I did

My best memory when i killed one guy with 2-3 bullets and another one guy through the wall
---
Game sound?
---
Just a maple leaf covering his junk, cmon Ubi, you can do it lol
---
As a buck main, I am with Ubisoft in this occasion
---
Wouldent that make it a old version of the deagle?😂
---
Checked everything
---
Is it happening only in the game or for the whole PC/console?
---
Unranked does have skill matchmaking right? My 2nd account is level 30 but I get put with gold 2s In unranked
---
I guess. Is that necessarily a bad thing? : )
---
Ash gang rise up
---
Just siege. PS4 party works, MW game chat works
---
Learn the maps and their best spots to roam and wait for attackers. That’s the thing that’s helped me most.
---
Oh I'm sorry, I haven't had that happen before, I can't help you there
---
I remember when recruit shield was used in pl
---
hm... probably acing with GIGN recruit in overtime. it was my first ace ever, and was completely by accident. I found a chill group of guys and we had a blast playing together, but on the last round, two of them left. so we were on defense on Kanal, in a 3v5 against a team who we had no idea how we'd been beating before. so we decided "fuck it, recruit time." I went GIGN with shotty and revolver, and roamed while my teammates held down the bombs. two of them got cocky and rushed bridge, so they died. next, I picked one off on stairs with revolver. by that point, an IQ had made it to site and killed both of my teammates, so I went back to site and dispatched her. The last enemy was Fuze, and he had the defuser. he sent a charge through the ceiling and put me at like 15 health- things were dire. so one of the random guys I'm playing with (who I'm now good friends with) goes "Hide behind my shield, I have an idea." and in All-chat, I see him go "HE'S AFK IN BASEMENT, JUST GO PLANT." for some reason, that poor fuze took the bait, and went to plant on B. I vault the shield and run over just in time for him to still be finishing the animation, and bang, overtime recruit ace incorporating some silly bait. I'm still pretty new, and sometimes get a bit discouraged by toxicity or my own lack of skill, but when I remember stuff like this it makes me smile and play on.
---
Why is there so many operator main on this?!?
---
Because it will be pretty much useless, they can’t do updates everyday on console. 
---
Games that can do updates every are beta.
---
Makes it not as unique but u do have a point? Any ideas? After the first shot the recoil is difficult, reduce second shot recoil and have each shot more balanced between them. (Easier to predict)
---
Pmm says hi
---
Skill based matchmaking is a myth. I just got an ace a little bit ago in like a 2v5
---
Guess you disagree with what people are saying in PL but ey wait see what happens once they in PL
---
I felt it was basically Call of Duty gameplay with none of the elements that make Siege interesting. That's why I personally hated it.
---

That would be way OP. Locking the defense out when everyone is roaming and not on objective? LOL
---
I thought about a one way invisible shield op that makes things behind it disappear while standing still
---
Good news everyone!
---
Nice . The enemy team potato aimed so badly tho
---
Hahaha shit would be so funny
---
Good job. This video could have been 2+ minutes shorter.
---
Castle is actually very good, many don't know how to use his effectively
---
I’m giggling just thinking about it LOL!
---
Yea sorry i didn’t know how long to clip it and I’m kinda stupid
---
That’s your problem for not re-queueing
---
They'll care when they see the current stats.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Everyone apart from the cheats has stopped playing the game.
---
Aight, when I accept and am on invite me or I invite you and we 1v1 or do whatever. Cya later man.
---
Worth it.
---
oof, thanks tho
---
If not later tonight ill be back on weekends so msg me
---
Deal
---
I'm not sure "always" is the right word. I think silver and below yeah there's a chance they freak out. But "always" nahhh
---
Wdym?
---
Yeah, big rip
---
I always put it back up, no disrespect
---
Shame it can't be seen
---
It was you wasn't it 👀
---
I ain’t no expert but ain’t it the white ball your supposed to hit
---
Yeah I know. I mean, you know I got the kill because it’s a final kill cam

Yea i see, just saying tho, people will trash talk so that's a shame
---
i just got kicked out of 2 matches in a row cuz of my “slow connection “
---
Post Production will take most of December and Early Jan as we've got other projects. We love the rushes we got and I'm super excited! The shots are SO SICK
---
I bought a scuf impact for around £200 once absolutely hated it and the R2 trigger broke  after about 2 hours managed to get a full refund
---
It really should be changed. That is very good portion of the screen that’s taken up which often causes a few problems.
---
Just 4 years , feels longer
---
The moment I uninstalled it
---
Definitely wasn't the best, but it was fun, and I enjoyed it
---
Get out the lawyers we going to court
---
On bank, i went through alley access at one of the windows, and flanked a tachanka, hopped on his LMG and aced.
---
It was just hostage in plane
---
It was nothing like the Halloween event either. It was pointless.

Imagine if Glaz’s special was having two primaries (no sidearm of course) instead of the thermal sight... the power and higher popularity of Glaz if that was true.

I mean, in game. What if I'm a player who doesn't use Reddit or Discord? These are outside ways of improving quality of life

---
Thank you for your service
---
Damn
---
I almost never get into games that are close to end
---
You know way too much about Blackbeard’s butt.
---
Maverick is a really good choice, but it depends on your play style. Do you prefer information gathering, rushing, or sneaking?
---
That's a good point lie, for me I find listening carefully and knowing your surroundings will take care of that,  when you get tracked they are going to push you keep your angles tight and prefire...i don't think it's that difficult to counter really, and with the new nerf on his ability Jackal ain't gonna be that big of a threat anymore.
---
That time I was spawn peeked
---
Nice idea, but this tweak will have no impact in pro-league because players don't see the points they earn on screen, therefore it's unlikely that it'll be implemented. 
---
Also, Zofia's concussion nades give you points as long as it explodes. That means you'll still earn points even if the room is empty, as long as the nade pops.
---
Maybe it's birthday cake frosting instead of pastels?
---

It’s not even an exploit also not even that hard to counter

Bowel movement
---
I did spend 8 years in the Navy. ;)
---
Seriously though, someone pointed it out to me and now I can’t unsee it. You’re welcome. Haha.
---
I'm more of a sneaking kind of guy, but I do love gathering info on the enemy team. Respect for making Tachanka too
---
Yes, of course I know that. But Warden's pistol seems to give more speed than intended.
---
By far my first ace. I was a frost main when I started. I got 3 kills with my traps and the last 2 kills were in a 1v2 situation with the defuser planted. This was also the first time I used the super 90 shotgun.
---
Hope it's Monday, probably Tuesday, might be Wednesday if delayed
---
Then you get 2-tapped by the revolver. Same outcome
---
Weird flex.
---
It happens to everyone on my almost 800 people friend list
---
This is beautiful
---
When keeping it real goes wrong
---
I personally love Mavrick, but you have to know how to use him well and not instantly get shot in the face
---
I almost always. I can count on one hand the amount of full games I've been in today.
---
I dont understand,  these retards thought you were a "gamer girl" and the got mad at you and TKed when you didnt talk to them?
---
Neat idea, but it can still be exploited by a squad of toxic teammates.
---
A pretty good Assault rifle and the highest capacity gun in the game
---
Because you are supposed to play a full game which is 3 rounds, you only join later because there’s lots of leavers
---
I'm 19. I have over 2000 hours in the game. Between pc and ps4. Almost 1k on ps4 between my main and smurf. I think I know how players play. The fact your tryna insult me is kinda cute doe
---
LOL! Great answer.
---
Bad manners
---
Basically being a dick. Like t bagging. Stupid strats that work. Spawn peeking
---
It almost certainly won't be tomorrow, as it wasn't announced today. As far back as I can remember they've always Tweeted the date and maintenance times the day before release.
---
It's a Lmg with 150 rounds
---
Can't have a fun game when ubi keeps putting me in a game with 1 round left.
---
3 ops has the ita12s, I think spd 9mm and Prb 92 for secondary
---
The F90 and 416-C for primary 
---
And smoke grenades,stuns
---
Just glad people appreciate it
---
Yes I do, I have practiced them for longer than I'd like to admit 
---
The placement I'm talking about here is when I peek someone right on their head, or vise versa. It was a lucky guess to place them there based on the cover in the room
---
I never seem to get ones that go for the shot instead of the knife. (Gold 2 and 1 most of the season)
---
Damn, right as I was going to start listening to it
---
Who bans Blitz? I never see him getting banned.
---
This feels weird
---
I feel you man, really sucks. I've always looked forward to their podcasts every week. For a few weeks they werent posting any so I thought maybe they were forgetting to or something, it's a damn shame
---
Maestro main huh, you have good taste my friend. From all the the times I’ve gotten killed while I was on cams, or spraying with his 31 drum mag shotgun, I love maestro and this game.
---
True, maybe one vote per squad could fix this issue
---
The team you joined didn’t have fun either being at a disadvantage.
---
How about a nomad &amp; jager colab?
---
No ones even said it’s release on Monday
---
Well I have one question with Mavrick can you make reinforcements fall out if you make like a whole rectangle with him or no
---
I’ve read it everywhere. It’s been on tts for 3 weeks
---
Cake daaaaaaayyyyy! Happy to you!
---
You can, it just takes a lot of juice
---
Oh no oh fuck, watch out vigil German milf is behind you.
---
Yeah, but who knows, one can hope, can he not?
---
1.All you red is pure speculation and noting official
---
2. They never released a season a Monday.
---
3. They give the date a day or 2 before. We didn’t hear anything from ubi so it’s not tomorrow.
---
Thank you I know it’s a stupid question but I never seen it done so I didn’t know if you could or not
---
Oh ok
---
signed
---
Honestly I'd say Maverick is a perfect choice for you then. He has some pretty good guns, and you can get some pretty cheesy stealth kills through walls
---
*whispers to vigil* if it runs on batteries I’ll see it
---
Everything you said is spot on when everyone knows what theyre doing. Everything you said is a gamble in casual, uncommon in unranked and *expected* in ranked. The fact you can articulate the way you did proves youre not the kind of player i described
---
You can, but it's normally more practical to use small holes, clear a room, then enter
---
444
---
I wouldn't call them lucky. Because it's a lot harder to flick up from the chest than to flick down from head to crouch position. Basically, you aim train so that regardless of scensro, your crosshair is ready to fight.
---
Pip is nice and realistic but implementing it is very resource intensive.
---
That just helps my case more.

Yes, you can still hear it. If you want to sneak up on enemies, you should be walking instead of sprinting.
---
Lmfao of course you can make up a bs statement. Your an internet troll. You sit around breaking other people down all day. Stop being such a bitch and understand there are retards out there. Just cuz you think you would shoot at people if they are reinforcing the door right in front of you when your monty doesnt mean everyone else out there will. Like for real. Stop bitching about everything and accept that you dont know all

*laughs in Capitao and teamwork*
---
That’s no problem thank you, I think it said the first ten were 1000 coins, sounds like a regular game where you have to earn them. I’m happy with that.
---
you cant play recruit in ranked
---
Did they fixed the desynchronized empity mag realoading of the M4?
---
Congrats!
---
Lion main gets my upvote
---
The greyed out are the original operators before dlc operators started to come. U hav to unlock them by credits or renown. They LL be cheap renown , u can unlock them all easily.
---
It was sold last season, unobtainable now.
---
Unless you buy an account with it or they magically bring it back but every season 4 characters get pro league skins.
---
this is worst  [https://youtu.be/Aj-Ejf6Sn-E](https://youtu.be/Aj-Ejf6Sn-E)
---
Bad mannered
---
Yea, it starts at 500 and goes up 500 per operator in each CTU. So your first spetznaz is 500, your second is 1000, etc, then your first GIGN is 500, then 1000, etc.
---
When you use your backpack as a pillow
---
Miss old blitz eyes
---
Yeah sorry, more than happy to grind and learn the game, and as I said to the person who gifted it who was apologising for getting the wrong one, don’t be daft I’m thankful for the game regardless haha. 
---
Looking forward to learning this maps, I’ve played just over an hour and it feels so far so good.
---
If you leave the game it counts as a lose either way so it still would affect w/l

One question of mine is why is the gun so small compared to her face it looks weird to me do i shrink when it get close or something
---
Perfect, I’m sure all that will make more sense the more time I spend in game.
---
Thanks for the answer
---
This can be abused very badly
---
Literally the game before, 2 rounds in 2 guys leave. Us 3 manage to win a couple rounds despite being 3v5 but we lose 3-5. Still lost the normal ELO despite 2 dudes ditching and almost winning.
---
Is sad if you don’t get it but want it. I want a Montagne one.

---
Thank you. Definitely going to join you guys
---
If you are refering to last day post that was one guy trolling, we don't know the date yet.
---
Arrows probs or whatever is most parallel to wasd, so ojkl maybe?
---
Yes plenty of players during peak times. Queue times are a little longer during morning hours (in US, at least), but you can still find matches.
---
It’s for spectators
---
I would think that they would be playing since they announced that MentalistC is joining the roster
---
You can complete Situations for quick and easy renown by completing the bonuses. I think it’s 200 renown per bonus, also don’t forget about the weekly challenges. :)
---
&gt;ubi claims there's a hidden MMR for casual which I know is nonsense cause I on the regular end up in casual games
---
You can start by looking up how the different systems work. Casual has a MMR system thats the same backend as the rank but it uses causal mmr. 
---
Those 6000 Rank mmr champs dont always try to win their casual matches and use it as a warm up by running around and leaving early. Due to that their casual mmr is way lower than their rank mmr. 
---
Anyone playing casual with a group of friends will have higher casual mmr. If you get a group of friends that are high gold, they'll normally have higher casual mmr due to wining a lot of matches. 
---
&gt;Just look at the mess the newcomer playlist if it's nothing but smurfs padding KDR
---
No one is padding Casual KDR lol, only KDR thats getting padded is ranked. People fuck around in smurfs on newcomers is cause they want to have easier matches cause they cant consistent win on their normal ranks. Rather than getting better, they just smurf on newcomers to feel better.
---
The longest time I’ve had to wait is 3 minutes

Time will tell. People will still comfort ban him at the beginning of the season to see how the Meta fleshes out. Kinda how Lion was still banned all the time even after his rework until better strats were found

D U A L  M O N T Y  S H I E L D S
---
I don’t see why not. Having Glaz’s rifle and another automatic rifle in the place of a sidearm would be pretty great.
---
I remember my very first round 2 years ago playing sledge and my cousin who convinced me to buy siege wanted to “see what I would do” I died walking at someone holding a hammer with malicious intent.

I tried so hard and got so far, but in the End it doesnt even matter.

Sorry, i had to do this.
---
ok boomer

Pog.
---
Try using something more official than an overused two words
---
Its a visual thing ubi did to make things look proportional when they are away. The reason it looks so bad is because the gun is proportional to the head, but in CQB youre not that close to the enemy which is why you dont see it. Its the same things with legs while you are prawning
---

Hip fire recoil before you ADS
---
You can now officially become a toxic Jäger main
---
I feel your pain. I picked up this game last year for Xbox and had the same problem. Once I got around level 30-40 it didn’t happen as much, but even now at 60 it seems like some people teamkill you for the stupidest reasons, on casual play that is.
---
I love the gameplay overall but this is the most toxic player base of any game I have played. Maybe it was better near release but lots of ‘friendly casuals’ have moved on while lots of salty tryhards remain???
---
This literal exact same thing happened to my friend the other day
---
Is English like your 3rd language or something? 
---
"Our best guess is that the Rainbow Six Siege Ember Rise release date is September 9, 2019 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Every season the reveal"
---
Thats a guess date. The offical release was 11th
---
Operation red crow for sure
---
Do you mind sharing how you’re able to crouch so well
---
Angled acog? How do you control the recoil?
---
its actually harder to turn, since on console you can just hold the stick in a direction, but a lot easier to do fine movements. a lot of the thing about getting used to PC is finding the right sensitivity that allows you to aim precisely while also being fast enough that you can turn around without running out of space for your mouse.
---
I dont play unranked only cuz its exactly like ranked but no reward, basically a waste of time. But thats just me and I dont even warm up since I’m on a time crunch most of the time that I play R6, unfortunately.
---
Yes but no
---
It is obviously just bad design, it is not a balance mechanic...
---
I would make the hole right before you throw though, otherwise you give them somewhere to shoot a fire bolt or a cooked nade.

Idk which map I hate more this or tower. Definitely tower but that’s not saying much lol
---
New paintball guns
---
Who the fuck is imo
---
Could be like it's with Y1 operataors, you can only buy it in a bundle, but i don't know really
---
Also iq has fbi pistol and alibi has the bope pistol in the pictures
---
This is me in casual when teammates barricade OBJ with 10 seconds of pre game
---
Yup. I'm afraid it never does, the only place for virtually uniform opinion is on the actual political subs.
---
He can't lose at this point. Fellow gamer, fellow trump supporter brother.
---
I never leave though.
---
Lol, any tips for someone just starting to try out ranked?
---
I don't think it fell on either side or the political line. Just an awesome picture....
---
With an awesome president!
---
Ya I really don’t understand some of the hate he gets
---
I'd select him every round
---
I somehow managed to knife the whole team with blitz, with one flash per person.
---
It was on yacht
---
I think this is the valid answer /s
---
I wanted to see what people think about Kali vs. Glaz.
---
I think there were hitmarker they removed them Long ago
---
Warden is a 1 speed no?
---
Client side debris and dead bodies (I am aware they will potentially fix it on Y5S1)
---

*sumo slams the hostage into oblivion*
---
how about claymore killing the attackers as clash?
---
I'm kinda depressed seing this because my $850 account got perm banned for messages only I could see. I need a life.
---
Can't think of how many times I've broke a peek hole in a barrier and been cucked by csd. Also, always fun seeing drones hiding near bodies cuz they think they're inside them.
---
Tried it, didn't work. Got any other ideas??
---
That destroys Glaz’s potential for versatility.
---
I've gotten the some thing it was just for my ping tho

You do know that both the acog and his sight are of the same magnification, don't you?

And you now want to give a higher kick full auto 5x zoom to take it even further out of Siege's average engagement distance?

You either end up with toxic players or they think your an anoying kid, either way, it's really fucked. best to learn callouts and specific location on the map.

Why ha?

Oh my...... Ubi, what have you done?!

and a universal skin before the start of a new Year (X) season (X)

I fucking hate how dark mw is. But I want to make breach holes in any ceiling like in the initial trailer
---
1- the game engine made it's on
---
2- the microsoft azure servers it's hosted on
---
The amount of crouch spamming is maddening.
---
what's wrong with the engine
---
tuesday goddamnit it's always on a tuesday. or at least should be.
---
Of course Castle is your first option.
---
Thank you for this
---
I think Sam thought you asked about Ash's Hitbox hence why it searches the 3D models.
---
Well as a mute main i'm offended.
---
The reason I didnt list the seasonal skin is because its a pre order bonus which usually lasts from December till March.
---
got any solid proof for that ?
---
Tbh i have no idea how to help whats the same thing as WASD for lefties?
---
Farkn nice.
---
Same reason as for why they have their own pro league.
---
Despite the fact that woman are able to compete in pro league as it is unisex, the toxicity towards them still exists even amongst teammates. 
---
There is a reason why so many women compete in the women's only league when they are clearly talented enough for unisex challenger.
---
The Bailiff is a shotgun revolver. This allows you to get a little more consistency.
---
With the Bailiff being a shotgun revolver, you'll get more consistency.
---
All the toxicity aside, casual cannot really be used to judge your true skill (note the TRUE part).
---
If this is good for you then good job, keep working on it. Always room for improvements, even if you're ranked champion 1.
---
Well f**k, this is what we get for being nice.
---
Hey man you need your eyes testing because it’s actually not an M4 or a HK 416, it’s a HK416C. Haha don’t know where you got that idea when the rail and gas block on view uniquely identifying it as such.
---
It’s called thumb over bore, there’s more than one way to use a grip.
---
Hey I gotta tame that gas blowback recoil some how /s
---
If you're ranked in real ranked you should be matched with similar people in Unranked. It's literally just casual with ranked rules. It doesn't help you improve.

---
Not really from my experience. I play well with him (when I do get to play) as a low Gold tier player, but most other people I come across don't know how to use him or don't care to. Or they're just on the novelty of scanning footprints
---
If it ain't on this sub, it ain't nowhere.
---
1000 hours . started during God blackbeard
---
Certain tiers of players ban other ops more often than others. There's lots of gold and silver players who ban jackal and cav because they dont know how to play against it effectively. Then higher tiers ban people like lesion, ela, echo, blitz. because they know in the right hands that shit is deadly.
---
Jackal got less bans on the TTS, so there is hope.
---
BC called. He wants his title back.
---
The pick and ban system is a piece of duct tape that the devs have used to try and hold a poorly balanced game and a whiny playerbase together. The mere fact that there are "must-bans" at all prove that its broken. Are you a jackal or an echo main? Have fun not being able to use your favorite character.
---
Why does people not knowing how to play have anything to do with how strong the char is?
---
He gets banned in every ranked game i play lmao
---
The teams banning mindlessly,that’s a team issue,not the ban systems.
---
this is shaiiko dropping 24 kills and still losing but not in pro leauge
---
More maps
---
So you think perfect balance is possible?
---
We ain’t got one,lad.
---
damn i saw that guy and after he lost he waz crying about me playin newcomer
---
Damn nice
---
Fuck no.
---
So ? where is the proof ?
---
&gt;Unless you're in a stack of 3+,
---
Which you should be to get the most out of this "team based communication demanding" game but nobody seems to want to do that, so, no, the system isn't flawed, the people that play it are.
---
Except the pros. They have positive iq.
---
is that a gacha ball?
---
Bruh stop dreaming content of the greatest memer bikinibodhi &gt;:(
---
I have around 500h aand i szarted when Cav came out(idk the season T_T)
---
Calling him soup man is really apt because hes a Cantonese person from Hong Kong and Canto's love their soup.
---
&gt;lol console aim
---
Thanks for showing that we arent as bad as the PC-oppressors say we are.
---
Do you see a place for the game's engine for this ?
---
of course there is the "gg ez" prick, probably a sore loser when he loses
---
I mean, people only figured out how OP Lion was after he was available in PL. I'm not saying that you should blindly follow the statistics but we need more time before we know for sure how strong he is.
---
If only was good enough to play in these higher tiers then. And true, Blitz is either a free kill for Defence or go all John Wick on the them.
---
Their argument often is "he has slow ads".
---
Only a tactical dud adss with Monty.
---
That's some smart gameplay, thumbs up!
---
I don't know how many times I've hot breached with blitz and fucked guys up. And also got fucked up.
---
I went to my buddy’s house the other day and he had siege on Pc, tried terrorist hunt with mouse and key. Hated it. Then I went and played ranked with a controller on PC and got placed plat for his account. I did all 10 games that night.....
---
I want a movie please
---
Good point, but I feel like pick and ban is not for the regular playerbase. Should've stayed in pro league. Or at least only be in available to higher ranks.
---
Certain picks will always be banned out more often that's just how it is .. you cannot make all the operators 100% balanced especially when u have to compare the difference between public ranked games vs comp where different things shine. my advice stop trying to main something you know is despised in public ranked especially in lower elos
---
I agree in part, really good players are great examples of this.
---
This is a different angle that I believed for a while, good aim combined with good game sense is always a plus, but is always replicatable by luck especially with the fast ttk. The type where as soon as you peek you hit a headshot
---
I really wish that was always the case, but often I think it's more beneficial to have one of the 3 lucky factors than the game sense
---
I feel you. Blitz is my other main, it's such a love-hate relationship.
---
This is just plain false. 140k is Steam alone which is the smallest platform for Siege.
---
Why though? ~~casual~~ quick play is already basically death match
---
Who do you play with?
---
Not operators,I mean do you Solo Q,play with friends,etc?
---
When were those numbers released? Or you mean in ranked in general? Didn't know they released those numbers. I grabbed a screenshot of the hot breach podcast they did in Spain at Ubisoft. I believe that's from PC Plat&amp;Diamond. It lists Jackal as the most banned for the Y4S2.3 and Y4S3 patches. In Y4S3 Jackal is banned 72% and Monty 32%. Still second highest ban rate tho in both those patches
---
The tenchaka trap. Enemies are so invested in stealing it it becomes their downfall
---
Jagers ass be like: (   (
---
I really want a case study why those two letters get people so angry, cus i can get why but for me, I couldnt care less to get angry about that for some random ass player to say that...
---
That is the single most greatest thing in seige history. F in the chat for the patch already 😤
---
I have obviously learnt to play other ops, and already did but I'm not trying to main Jackal per se just recently, I've been maining him since his release basically
---
Casual (aka quickplay) :
---
#Am i a joke to you ?
---
Give me a while. I'll try to pull out the numbers 
---
It was released in the first season after pick and ban, where Monty was the highest ban. I'm sure of it. If I'm wrong, I'll accept it. but need a while to get that pic.
---
"i cOuldNt finD tHe sOurCe" when its literally in the corner.

Many people say that. Mostly because they're perverts
---
My best memory was when I played the game.
---
Maybe of this blows up or a famous player like coconut or bikini it will
---
That's makes me want to believe that glaz should have one now
---
I do not know xd people often not watching enough
---
Yeah...quittttteeeee the stretch

I didnt even think about adding weapons... brb

You shot a wizard
---
Try searching online, that's what me and my friends did when we joined a heartstone tournament. You could also try hosting your own with an entry fee and the winner takes it all.

This works, i use it alot in csgo, but now i will try it on siege as well

I got nobody :(

I don't have anybody either. So you're not alone

Yes

Check my post history, ive been alone so much ive been suicidal.

Does South Africa even have a special ops unit?
---
9.5, but if it costed over 5K i'd pass
---
The word you’re looking for is crutch, not handicap.
---
I don't get it

This is why they banned 
---
Shotguns in the trenches
---
Now the question is which op should I choose Blackbeard or Caveira ?
---
I know I changed it. But you agree right lmao
---
If I saw that thing IRL, I probably couldn’t hold myself and would  throw it as powerful as I can do.
---
IQ is very useful for finding echo drones and lesions traps. You can even find pulse and vigil when they use their gadget. (I think you can see people on their phones too...im not too sure on that tbh) 
---
I recommend using her gadget when it's relatively safe; since you'll have your pistol out. Unless you're a god and can just headshot people.
---
Frost is an interesting one since her traps can put people into a downed state. You can double/triple stack windows if you want to hold it. You can also place your traps in spots where people wont be looking down since they can get shot at. Best example I could give off the top of my head would be  white stairs on Kafe.
---
 Tbh placing frost traps in unexpected spots is where you'll get most of her traps to work. You can also just stick them behind shields lol. Those will get you kills also.
---
Im gonna buy wamai as fast as i can just To do this
---
Watch the video

Your flair does say you like scaring people....
---
Amaru’s nose is an absolute unit.
---
Draw the lord
---
Caveira. I want patrik/caveira drawing
---
I say play with at least one other person, or if you play solo then play Bomb. The people who play bomb typically take the game more serious so they won't put their team at a disadvantage by team killing most of the time.
---
With Frost you can use her shotgun to make a vault hole in a soft wall then put a frost mat on the other side, if you have a Castle they can put a barricade nearby so attackers will be more inclined to use the rotation
---
##False!!
---
This is false as you misspelled casual in the title brother! Ranked is just mnk users and toxicity
---
Now toss it at the wall!:D

Can confirm. We also like our tea

Hmm have any examples?

My god for honor actually got a trend to spread to another game. My happiness is immeasurable and my day has been made. (Im under the mentality that for honor has low populations compared to games like siege)

To me you seem more than good. You just made a simple mistakes. They happen even to the best.
---
UWAAAAAGHHHH

I’m asking which person am I Mira or Monty because you wanted to know what I would’ve done

I just shot once at the window and hit a headshot there was no one spawn peaking

It might be tommorow, ubi usually posts at 5 PM est the release date of the season for the next day, so it might be tommorow because nothing was posted about it on their page yesterday

Thanks :)

I get where you're coming from. But I believe the controversial discussion of what is or isn't racist is not suited for this subreddit so we should just stop here.

Can you send me the original?

If thats meant to be a gladiator pun then im even more happy as im a Gladiator main.
---
I have it in the comments somewhere
---
what the fuck
---
So, idk if this varies from platform to platform but the welcome matt's hitbox is slightly bigger than you'd think. You can place that bad boy beside doorways and have a little part of it visible to the people coming through. Thing is, it's quite hard to spot and even if only a centimetre is in the door it's self it will catch enemies. As for unexpected spots, it depends on the enemies. Try see what routes they take in the first defending round and then adjust your traps the next. Lastly, always be willing to experiment a little, try find new blind spots and cheeky trap placements, also if necessary you can do the double trap on Windows and doors.

I bought a new computer in February and somehow I completely missed the fact that my new graphics card only had Displayports and one HDMI port, so the 120Hz monitor I had so far been using with DVI could now only be used with old type HDMI and was capped 60Hz and my second monitor couldn't connect at all.
---
Getting my FPS cut in half really hurt my aim and made the game difficult to play. I only had to endure it for 2 weeks or so, but for that time I changed my playstyle to be a bit more passive and played more intel ops than combat ones, as well as just played less Siege and more Apex Legends since it was the hot new game at the time.
---
Crap, he didn't see my username flair

But u can actually kill ppl on range if u have a good aim (but u cant even tapfire with ela)
---
oh yeah that's big brain
---
11/10
---
I don't understand . Why the hell the PC players have to suffer the balance change when it's not even an issue on it ?
---
When you stop asking
---
Do you see an announcement for it ?
---
Is it just me or do i see a dickbutt in the bg
---
Sorry , lad . I am just using the old reddit
---
When the entire team killed each other and I clutched a 1v5 on defenders
---
Interesting observation

I've not gone on I'm just asking so I can see if it'll be live by the time I'm home or if I can stay at my grandparents for longer

Wdym whats tge issue

He’s there, watching

Half of them didn't even try shooting at him lol shut up

Yeah

Stay longer there . There is no official time or a release on when is Shifting Tides release

Ah okay, thanks

No problem , lad

What’s the difference between universal and seasonal?

It’d be a 10/10 without the text imo.
---
In Burnt Horizon, the entire file system was reorganized and the game was shrunk down from 131GB to about 60GB, but the game has gone through several seasons since then and now we’re back up to the 100GB+

The amount of luck

Does it actually work? Like have electronics in it?

That's the entire point. It's not like he did anything so amazing to get the right to teabag lol

I always feel that things ARE balanced around PC and Pro League/Tournament players. For example, if Blackbeard does receive yet another nerf, it's based on the Plat and Diamond players when they show the charts. Blackbeard is almost never used effectively by average players. Same as Ela's shotgun. Maybe Pro League players hate it and maybe the recoil is super controllable on PC but on console and to the average player it's not OP. The average players make up the vast majority of the playerbase and consoles make up I'd assume around 2/3 the playerbase so why are things balanced around Pro League with the fact that Pro League is played on PC in mind? I get that to "balance Pro League" changes need to be made but maybe for the tournaments balance things differently so the majority of the playerbase doesn't have to suffer? Just my two cents.
---
Nah I couldnt find an LED to put in it cause I'd need a battery and i couldnt find one. So i just put a blue pvc piece as the lense
---
Nothing happens that warrants that title
---
Only thing I can think of is maybe the update releases today so they popped that back up to prepare for it to change to Theme Park?
---
Can confirm, last time i used Buck my frag hit the hostage instead of an enemy

Care to explain?

cleared a t hunt under 15 minutes with 50 health left isn’t impressive tbf. like i’m not trying to be a dick but t hunts have like 20 ais that can’t aim
---
It isn't useless input, he's telling you that you reload too much.
---
I did something like that but I stopped playing siege and started playing modern warfare.
---
But last night I tried to play siege and I tried to do a 90 ° turn but did a 180° turn because I wasn't used to the sensitivity so I got no kills for the 5 games I played and I haven't played for a month.
---
Sadly most of that season's skins are poorly wrapped on other guns. I understand the appeal, but running it on all possible guns would show just how bad it looks on some.
---
*vote kick initiated*
---
operator charts and balance changes are based off high plat and diamond ranked on pc only...
---
Pick and ban feature is a crap in all games...I never ban, I use the banning phase for go to the toilet, take something to drink, check the social media or play with my cat
---
I was close to wining but I couldnt cuz 0 secs and 7 sec defusr time and bandit was right behind me

Oh wow there's no mini map? I've been playing for almost two years and I never realized this, thank you ;). I can tell you have trouble making friends because you're such a toxic asshole for no reason. By the way the last time I played ranked (wind bastion) I was plat so you're wrong ;)
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying. Not the entire community.

When you plant it stops the timer. So that’s not an issue. But you never showed yourself dying to a bandit in this clip so we have no idea.

Seriously.. Nobody who has recently started playing the game to the game wouldn't know this-- It's a situation called Article 5 - Usually, it's only unlocked by playing all of the situations and getting to the last one.

I totally agree. I don't even play Jackal often so you have a non-butthurt guy backing you up. Jackal is annoying at best but not NEARLY as op as pick and ban would have you believe.

There isn't a best it's mostly preference. But, your rank mattered alot. For example high fire rate guns do great in high tier due to chance for the headshot, but bad in low tier as they don't do alot of damage.

If you think that rape isn't abhorrent, then I don't think it's me who needs to grab a dictionary. The word is banned because there is never a context where it should be used in game chat. There is literally nothing more to it.

So a cav on attacking? But like counter cav?

Castle is complicated because he’s useful and strong (still somewhat niche) at very high levels like in pro league, because his gadget relies on strong team coordination and strategy so much. They don’t want to buff him so that it makes him overpowered in pro league
---
Tachanka has been bad for a long time because Ubisoft realized early on two things: his gadget is inherently bad in a game like this, no matter how you buff it **and** the character is a meme in the community 
---
This meant to them that the only way to make him useable is to completely change his gadget in a revolutionary way, but they haven’t because it would not only ruin the meme but it would also take roughly the same amount of work as releasing a new operator with a unique gadget so they’ve opted just not to change him, at least so far

"I'm gonna commit sudoku"

Yeah there’s some accidental bycatch, but again the solution for those players is to learn from the system (it’s not like it permabans on the first offense) and stop using those words, even if they’re not necessarily offensive

Nice work but seriously why is all the people that do this kinda stuff cav mains?

Oh wow. There go my free 50 points for just aiming for the head

Maybe, but it’s still less accurate and with slower fire rate

This type of censorship is useless and stupid, very easy to get around and most of the time it gives more trouble to normal people that said something offensive in god knowns what language they don't known.

Too bad the gun can’t kill

Yep. At least on Xbox you get invited to a party and occasionally the other team invites you to shit talk you too.

Also the switch from secure to bomb was hard but I learned it in road to SI and it was so fun that I didn't care as much when ranked changed

Hibana mains unite!

much sadded
---
The Mp5k has a bit over 100 total less dps than the Aug 42. Also has a harsher damage falloff.
---
The point of the operator is that there weapons aren't great but they are good at scouting ahead so they can locate where the enemies are before the rest go in so that nobody would have ro go back into there drones if they dont id everyone during prep phase. So at the start of the action phase the new operator would go in first, making sure the coast is clear and tagging any enemies that they spot
---
That shotgun would be a downgrade
---
Just go through all your weapon skins, takes me like ten minutes whenever that thing happens

SAS shotgun is pretty good for defense. Offense it works good with Sledge. Personally, I run Finka shotty on Favela and rush into obj within 10 seconds and clap people with the SASG.
---
Roaming is literally a vital aspect to defending
---
People like you are the reason we can't have nice things anymore.
---
Yeah, it's mainly for my gunfights. I found that on my main I get nervous or unconfident in my aim and I lose tones of gunfights because of it.
---
I agree that roaming shouldn't be rewarded. Do you agree that Jackal in his current state cripples roamers completely and is actually not fun to play against?
---
I’m sure you think spawn killing is too lol
---
chat filter in a M game where the obj is killing other people... welcome to 2019.. where people cant handle some mean words online...

Train was the biggest problem with the map, or do you just mean trains as a cosmetic aspect to the map?

I would love m4 for warden.

Well this has ruined my week. Today was the only time I could play it and that was only cause my boss closes the store for the day for it. Now I'm losing out on 144 dollars as well as my company losing a lot more . Thanx a lot Ubisoft for not announcing it earlier then a day before. They need to step it up on denouncing literally more then 20 sites "release dates" so those of us who actually work for a living can manage our schedules better.

Ik the supernova is the worst in my opinion I was just comparing it to the inconsisity of a one shot kill/down
---
Agreed. Me and my buddy always say "good try" over comms even when it's not. Cause talking shit to your team only makes the next rounds worse.
---
I don’t mind playing against him at all personally,  and I think that he should completely cripple roamers.   Roaming and spawn peeking make this game objectively worse.   If the rounds were 3-5 minutes longer roaming wouldn’t be a problem
---
Ya; your zee pettiest pverson I knöw, Marius : p
---
no thanks? I'd rather have the MPX than that trash.
---
For that you can do a couple things. 1.) Getting the smurf account. I know on PC you're gonna have to get a new copy, but for me on Xbox I just had to be signed in as my main and load the game on my alt and i kept all my DLC ops. So thats one option. 2.) you can play a load of T-Hunt. Use guns like the SMG-11/12 and work on accuracy and recoil control. That is by far the easiest option imo, but if you want to smurf you can. Just dont rely on it is all i would say.
---
I typed "homo" in the in game text chat and it git cencored
---
How is shooting people ok but homosexual people arent?
---
Ok let us assume 200 mil was the maximum amount the game could have costed to develop. So what? According to your list other games also cost around the same to develop, and that is the cost without mtx or dlcs or future developments. 
---
I think you are living in a reality that does not exist and will not exist for a while. The reason for my bias and my statements is based on the reality we live in where companies like Amazon (you know how they run their business ;) ) exist. Hence if I were to run a business like this, a successful one atleast, I would expect it to be run the exact same way with similar pricing model otherwise I will end up as a company that gets bought out by giant and all because my game was good but my business model of the company wasnt.
---
If mtx are life ads and annoying to you and you ignore them and you still find them annoying, you just proved to yourself that you have a personal problem. I see ads and mtx all the time. I do not get annoyed. Why would I? It isn't forcing me to buy anything or do anything. It isn't even shoving anything down my throat. So this is a personal problem you have to fix yourself. You paid an entry fee into R6S and R6S has given you an opportunity to play the game without forcing anything on you, so the fact that you think you are being annoyed with premium options is a personal problem.
---
Your last paragraph is useless in the argument as you can ignore all those things and play the game to the exact same advantage as a developer who probably owns every single thing in this game. So that statement is just meh. I am sorry they look greedy in your eyes. They do not in mine as I see they have done strategic and according to their success, correct decisions to reach where they are.

Amaru is very selfish. She doesn't really provide anything for offense whatsoever.  She's just a gimmick op. No real point in ever using her in like unranked/ranked. I'd like to see her get a buff, but I dont know how Ubi would go about it.

Their censorship still sucks.

Your flair... When blitz was terrible but fun

If you would write 'killed yourself', it would work.

Ok. Good art tho

I love then idea for the defender it seems balanced and hella useful the attacker on the other hand though sounds dope as hell and super cool seems a little too powerful maybe if it was 3hp per instead of the 5hp per it would be more balanced

I joined in just after year four season 2 was released with warden and nökk introduced, but I don’t even think ubi doesn’t care about their game.

Playing situations is a pro move on a new account. Easy way to get alot of renown without playing alot of games so you can have your operators quickly.

probably both i have to get a new labtop though the sound thing is broke so it wont recorded what would you call the season

Yeah, you can barely see me, it’s hella annoying in an actual game

I think the purpose of the battlepass is to increase player retention and get users to play more often. This is just conjecture but I'm guessing during the trial battlepass the active player numbers didn't meet expectations and they're revising it.

Yeah that’s true. Filters are just dumb and never actually work cuz they take words that aren’t bad at all and ruin sentences and it’s awful lol. BFV and sieges filters are so dumb.

And I wouldn’t necessarily go with the rallying KKK members in cod tho. Like yes there’s are people shooting the N word all over the place I’m cod and tons of other words. But of those people most of them probably don’t say it in a rl situation. It’s just the usual cod trash talk.

I'm fine with starting off from bronze and climbing while learning camera placements, map movement, hatch locations and efficient wallbangs+game knowledge, i don't mind getting a low rank and climbing and won't be discouraged by it

What i am discouraged by is is the game punishing me for no reason

In Tower you basically spawn above defenders so they can't spawnkill you. In other maps, I know it's frustrating because I never spawnpeek and I hate who does it, but I understood that it's just in the game mechanics so I stopped getting angry at them and started blaming myself for not being ready to counter it.

Amazing animation.

He makes S of his gas :D

Hard disagree. Higher levels of play are extremely gunskill heavy. CS is a lot like siege with the same sorts of tactical gameplay but DM is very popular among pros in that. Siege is just as much about gunskill as strategy.

Not true. If you force yourself out of your comfort zone and play more aggressively or take more chances on one account vs not being able to on the other shows the difference. I dont define myself based on my numbers, but on my playstyle and impact I make in the game.

Yeah but its the first time ( I think) an major update released a Tuesday. Normally it’s a Wednesday or a Thursday. 
---
I don’t get why people freak out that much, like we don’t know more than they do. Also what 2-3 days change in your life.
---
People like you are the reason I die in 2 seconds.
---
Yes! And turn off pay to win operators like ash or rook. They are unfair to people who were too slow to pick them. Also both teams should start  on attacking. Better balance. Also make every operator Thatcher.

The cosplay looks sick as fuck.
