I second this. They are extremely helpful in many areas.
---
---
---
This season on console has been horrible. From the very beginning people have been ddossing.
---
Yeah. Clubhouse defending basement, go up the stairs, set the turret up in front of the window on them. Tear down the window when the round starts, get on the turret, and fuck up anyone who dares to go tunnel while they can't do shit to you.
---
I used to be a Castle main before I got dlc because it though his shotgun was op for how fast it shoots and the damage but I was weird when I played him by roaming shooting at everything that moved.
---
Nice

Its always nice locking down objective with mute and castle.

Na

THIS. There are very few problems with perspective in siege. It's all about positions and prefiring.

2 seconds isn't a lot

Or like a glaz scope

One of those. Probably late August or mid September. We haven't gotten any leaks or anything like that so far
---
That looks sick
---
Im sorry Im American I cant understand you
---
He weighs  a lot and it’s all muscle
---
While my comment was a joke, frost is the highest win rate defender in the game.
---
Monty cant kill you from behind his shield, dosent  have a completely see through shield his teammates can strafe behind and peek from, has an abundance of counters that are plentiful on the defensive side, and dosent have a fucking automatic weapon. 
---
Monty is a balanced shield operator, Clash is the least balanced shield operator.
---
Okay thanks for the translation
---
i personally love playing against castle setups, just use the castles to your advantage, you know they won't come from there so it's a safe spot kind of

---
Fix what dude? The guy's a plat 3 you have a gold 1 on ur team. Seems pretty close to me.
---
they do, the movement penalty is only for smoke vision
---
i used to be one. i've barley played him for like over a year and for some reason he's still my most used defender
---
*Jäger no!*
---
no
---
Great to see my country being in Team Rainbow!
---
I love playing castle but every time I do I just get 4 roamers on my team whining about how I reinforced objective
---
Yes it will be 60 dollars full price 
---
It doesn't matter what engine it's using. It's still a new game and we don't know how much content will be in in yet but they have a new team working on it so I'm guessing a lot.
---
Anyhow I don't care about the cost of a game if we are talking 10-20 dollars difference it's really not much money
---
thanks! I hate it!
---
you can still hear reloads
---
level 300, noob! must be copper 4
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
JK, wish I was that high
---
They were smurphing - they bragged about being diamond at the beginning of the game. Que's should be based on the highest player's rank - not the team average
---
Yes
---
get used to a high sensitivity
---
I fucking like this. Like ACR Heartbeat Sensor
---
WOW
---
No. Blitz
---
Out of 45 million total players, do you really think that YOU are the only one running breach charges on Hibana?
---
Wonderful idea
---
This would ruin the game
---
B u l g e
---
The elite have all reference previous things the ops have done. Smoke was a troublemaker. This is a troublemaker Elite skin. What else would he have been? Plague doctors don’t exist anymore.
---
Same. Probably the most iconic operator
---
Imagine how balanced blitz would finally be
---
There is definitely a potential. Her utility aspect can be that she’s the best Anchor killer by giving more strength to her current stealth mechanic. 
---
There’s a character in League of Legends who is a Support but instead of supporting teams by bringing tankiness or healing/shields, he just straightout executes enemy who are below certain HP. He supports team by just straight-out killing certain enemies.
---
Nokk should have more advantages and reasons to pick her over the other Attackers. She is not a strong solo operator and really need something more for her to be justified. 
---
Even Warden, in his current terrible state, has more justifiable reasons and will be more justified once he gets little bit of adjustment. 
---
Despite the tiny buff Nokk received, there’s still no reason for her to be picked unfortunately.
---
This is fucking awful
---
Yea and lose all entertainment and joy for the game due to booters,cheaters and general assholes.
---
We need it
---
ive mained castle before for a good chunk of time.  what no one tells you is, that behind his awkward, clunkiness, he's a lot of fun and a really solid op and pick.  just dont be a douche and castle your team in at the start of the round, because no one will like youuuu
---
Surrender needs to be gone too.   You see it at the start of every new season.  Opposing team kicking your ass and then they surrender.
---
and the spears bounce off of him, and then fire flares up from the ground and he pulls out a LMGuitar and starts shredding some spinal cords and regular chords, and then flexes so hard everyone else in the victory screen explodes
---
New meta
---
He sounds like the heavy from TF2
---
No
---
Cough counterstike
---
I always get annoyed by how bad cosplays are but holy shit this is amazing, and for literally the hardest guy to cosplay, incredible work
---
I like your thinking
---
The reality is you can’t do a hell of a lot
---
Oh the thing that should’ve been fixed was the load time, not controller on PC. I probably should’ve specified that.
---
Pause on that title
---
So you're going to throw a nitro or a smoke past a Clash? That math don't add up chief. You really cant flank behind them, the objective is behind them, if you're in the obj whybate you looking at Clash? If the person behind Clash sets their reticule on your head, or were you'll likely appear, and micro peeks you, the peekers advantage wont let you see them until they're back behind the shield.
---
I was thinking this as well hopefully there is a possible solution in the works.
---
Thx lol

Very good game. Wait for title update 5 before going in wt5
---
And this is why im curious how Quarantine is going to be.
---
Lmao as a twitch main I agree
---
Damn what was the votekick at the end for?
---
In the past. Not anymore :(
---
How is the PS4 community on rainbow. Most of the people on Xbox me and my friends have come in contact with  will kill you just to get a kill or are just pricks in chat.
---
#Netf Twitch
---
So you're saying that if you're in pro league, and dont earn over 3 kills a game, you should be sacked? Bit harsh imo.
---
Also, the pro league thing was a joke. If you couldn't pick up on that, you've got no chance mate.
---
Yo same I'm from peru too!
---
Yeah, me too. I open up the wall into the balcony, and castle the door into connector, and tear down the door that goes from connector to the balcony. It allows for runouts and it gives protection so attackers can’t shoot us from barrel.
---
At the moment there is no punishment for ddosing, they won’t get banned
---
I had a joke with my friends about this last night
---
According to the in-game stats...this is the truth
---
There’s a few traditional band I’d like to change, honestly... Let’s all start banning random ops, lmao. Probably more use than banning Blitz, at this point.
---
 I never see such groupings in ranked.
---
Dude, he died. Quit being an insufferable cunt.
---
New Hereford is f u c k e d
---
I really wish people would play siege properly
---
No way this is photoshopped. I guess this is confirmed?
---
He has a dev skin on his gun. Maybe? Or he is cheating and getting everything on the game?
---
Terro hunt helps with aiming and newcomers is just all noobs
---
Bruh I thought you said bionocles but I bet it could hold both
---
Says the IQ main
---
even without the cloth, the helmet in the photo isn't the one she wears in-game
---
bruh 👏👏😝🤤😜
---
I think the best way to up his pick rate is to give just one more barricade upping it to 4 would make him just that much better on certain maps.
---
No it’s full of smurfs I heard
---
Have faith amigo! The time will come
---
Depending on plystyle, defense is better because the corners you hold are much harder to counter than when your an attacker. Don't ping when u spot an enemy when you're just droning (not start of round). Teamwork is key
---
On ps4 and xbox there are bound to be smurfs in the newcomer playlists.
---
But they should be able to 1v1 her with the shield offline, unless they're bad.
---
So I'm assuming Lesion Elite  is a reference to his time in the  Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau ?
---
As well as complete noobs who don’t know anything
---
There's this thing called speaking into a microphone.
---
Ah i see. But its not a ubisoft problem its console hardware. Consoles only have Hard drives while pc have a choices to use a SSD which is what changes ur load times significantly
---
Newcomer playlist is better for newbies. It gives you a sense of how to actually play with others and not just AI. I suggest that, but for aim maybe T-hunt.
---
It's not as bad as vote kicking I'm just pissed because it's happened all day
---
I’m pretty sure like 90% of the players in newcomers are smurfs
---
I’d say play a few terrorist hunts then switch to casual, I hear newcomer has lots of smurfs so casual might be better for you
---
I can never solo que, I always either play with one or two other people
---
Bro
---
Big brain plays.
---
It’s only easy to counter if the guy using blitz is brain dead. If he can get somewhat close to you and knows what he’s doing you’re done.
---
F
---
I thought this was a render holy shit. Very nice ( Come, break your back against a mountain)
---
I agree
---
Solo q players just get fucked constantly
---
Why dont you put barb and c4 together and see the results cause i think for higher ranked people have kaided barb wire is very useful
---
UNLIMITED POWER!!!
---
lmao I don’t care about jackal and blitz, my team always bans montagne
---
I don’t know some people are stupid ya know 🤷‍♂️
---
Thatcher can do it, doesn't really last long enough to make much of a difference.
---
Interesting idea! I like it
---
That’s their fault then. If they can’t play as a team in a team based game then they deserve the loss.
---
Cant you change your fov on PC?
---
Well impossible for r6 is what I mean
---
since when has she had those flip-down goggles in game then?
---
You know they make up the majority of the game, right?
---
Yes there are 👀
---
In casual me and my group of friends just screw around and try our new Mira spots or show off stuff we saw in pro league or whatever when we don’t feel like playing ranked or want to grind alpha packs. The only time we’ll ever truly try hard is if the other team is full of toxic 12 year olds that get mad when they lose so they break out lion, dokk, jackal, finka sasg, and blitz and get slammed because they are trash. These sweaty kids that think they’re so good for getting boosted to diamond and having to flex in casual are cancer. 
---
Side note: I have a shit ton of stories of 11 year olds spawnpeeking as jager and get wrecked only to see he’s a “diAMonD BTw” at the end of the game.
---
Agreed
---
you can but i purposely use 60. it fits me best
---
It’s the same account just in different places
---
Considering everyone bans him, you can’t really be a Blitz main, anymore. I was for a while, actually got pretty skilled with the flash and melee. At least a 3K every round, because no one wanted to approach to aggressive Blitz. 😂 Don’t get me started on the Aggressive Monty push, especially if you have someone you trust shooting over your shoulder.
---
It's not the Clash you should be afraid of - it's the acog totin' defender she's making callouts to.
---
Whats the max?
---
I never said there were perspective problems I said that’s how perspective should be.
---
Firstly, no it really doesn’t. No character from the titanfall/apex universe wears a varsity jacket with a gas mask.
---
Secondly, you can only get so creative if you limit elite skins to mimic those of the world wars, because it just won’t make sense half of the time.
---
 
---
Thirdly, lesion’s elite is chemical threat disposal uniform. It’s a uniform to protect him from harsh chemicals and such when he was a part of the EODB
---
Yeah I can definitely agree with that.
---
Do you think an adjustment to her secondary gadgets could be useful? Frags maybe instead of breaching charge or stuns?
---
Shoulder. You shot to the left (his right your left) of his head
---
For me, it’s usually Monty, Blitz, Caveira, and either Lesion or Echo. Everyone I main on defence, basically... Since everyone bans my mains, it’s pushed me to start playing other operators, which is actually helping me a lot.
---
I really hope they don't nerf the shield operators again. My favorite clutch ever was a 1 v 5 where I used FBI shield recruit. If he could get a laser sight on the 5.7 that would be a reason to nerf pistol accuracy.
---
# wheres the rolex huh?
---
And? Not every Solo Q player cooperates with their team. Doesn’t really matter if you are Solo Queuing either because Clash can still be dealt with with just simple callouts.
---
Especially if you’re solo queuing... Can you imagine 😦
---
Nah this was a bug
---
Happy cake day
---
pulse
---
Well if you get let's say a ranked ban if you leave a match you connect too then it wouldn't be a big issue
---
On console at Least, I would say about half diamonds are boosted af and got there by queueing with 4 other low plat players on copper smurfs tbh just to say they got diamond. I’ve destroyed a lot of diamonds doing this and I’m only plat 3.
---
The SCAR-L was ditched by SF and Rangers shortly after using it. They did like the SCAR-H though. So perhaps make that as a DMR for one of the ops. The rest is pretty spot on.
---
I was a castle main.
---
Until I unlocked Mira in my second week of playing.
---
Ash: "I need a fucking cig..."
---
And not everyone can. It’s funny how much the try hard talk shit about solo qers but if they stop playing the game dies
---
Why do you want to practice Thunt
---
samantha Fisher
---
I mean it does have a weird who’s the baby daddy mystery going on in team rainbow.
---
Yyyyup lol
---
It would be so funny to see the boosted kids that are “diamond” go against actual diamonds and get rolled every game.
---
The people who care enough ddos have multiple accounts
---
He lets me fuze a room with almost no chance of getting hit
---
his elite is basically the lord tachanka bundle, i dont think they’ll release an elite, it would be too powerful for the game to handle
---
Hahahaha that would be hilarious to see. Good anti boosting strat right there.
---
Cause it can be really fun
---
I’m not talking shit about Solo queuers. I never meant for it to come out like that, I’m just saying there is really no excuse for someone playing on their own to not even provide simple callouts. You don’t have to do complex strats to win, you just have to communicate.
---
Could be. It would definitely give her slightly bit more killing potential but I also feel like it diverges away from her stealthy approach.
---
I'm not to sure tbh. I'd say her gadget needs to be focused much more (being able to run, no waves appearing etc) before deciding on her secondary gadgets.
---
His came out last season... that isnt too long
---
Thank you, callouts are definitely something we need to work on for sure usually they aren’t that great or there just aren’t many
---
Dont think thats ranked
---
I play castle all the time (95% of defense rounds)
---
The title's not a mistake he's just coming out
---
Actually aim is just as important on console as much as pc, even thought console has aim assist you still need to have somewhat competent with aim or else you'll get dusted. I have multiple clips showing that aiming is the only thing actually keeping you alive. By tactics I usually mean with aiming because you cant do things as fast since you dont have a mouse.
---
This. She directly solo counters two rank S operators with ease
---
Thanks for the explanation. I thought it was a somehow boosted Nomad booper (looks hilarious — throw runouts waaaay up in the air — and shoot them).
---
You shouldn't be able to get seasonal skins at all but, ubisoft made an acception with that skin, so be grateful
---
Maybe for bomb if you play Thatcher and at the last seconds of the match if he throws his empty at a bomb it will disable it for a few seconds giving the attackers the few extra seconds for the last kill or the plant
---
How does CS do this? Do they stream on their own custom platform or is it something that can be done with YouTube/Twitch? If it's the latter, it should've absolutely been a thing a long time ago for Siege.
---
Why did you take a picture of your screen?
---
Wasn’t cas my guy just Xbox trash cans lmao
---
This is why I hate the rank bans. People ban ops they hate playing against rather than ban ops who bring better utility.  ( yes there is a time and place to ban lesion but it’s very situational)
---
Honestly they could make those changes in lieu of a Siege 2. That would take the game to the next level, no doubt.
---
Sounds like a silver, this true?
---
Console doesn’t have aim assist, just letting u know. Other than that I agree
---
I'd argue that's a little overkill, they still have to be relevant
---
We don't can you please explain how?
---
Did u report him, gets em more triggered
---
and you'd be wrong, shields don't need to be relevant as they don't belong in siege anyway
---
Thank you kind sir
---
I mean I'm way beyond the level to play it so I e never experienced it myself, but I can definitely imagine it's a problem. As soon as it was announced it's pretty obvious.. doesn't take a genius to realize what's going to happen with a playlist like that.
---
Imo it was just a bad idea from the start, and it probably even worsens the experience for actual new players.
---
I like the way they’re going. It looks good.
---
I think the reason Siege 2 might be necessary is that Siege's engine can't handle the kinds of advanced lighting the OP was suggesting. If we want next level stealth, maybe Siege needs a new engine.
---
And I think for Ubi to dev a new engine (or license a different one and rebuild Siege in it), we'd need to buy in a tfull-game price.
---
I hope this becomes a thing
---
Yes it does lol, you can change it in the settings
---
eww, red dot.
---
JTxic is my ID, I'm free rn. Would you like me to add you or you add me?
---
I think they do this on twitch but I’m not 100% sure on this because I don’t really watch csgo streams too often but I think it’s on twitch
---
Agreed, I mean its personally my fault I like to play rank with my friend because we try to test our skill and carry our teams if we need too. Also lesion is very situational player for most maps tbh because of his traps so I wasnt too mad with him being banned
---
I think flashlights would be incredibly annoying to play against tbh, but more attachments and better differentiation between attachments could be cool. At the very least, streamline the current barrel attachments and include more info in the description, and maybe make them more unique. 
---
The "cutting lights" part is really interesting though, I really wish there were more tactical things that attackers/defenders could do. The droning is a really fun part of siege and something that really differentiates it, so anything that adds on to this is something that would be welcome.
---
Sadly the game is only tactical on paper and everyone would cry about it if it got added (like night time maps) because I can't get MUH pixel peeks in the dark!!!
---
I'm with you. I think this would make Siege more fun overall. Ranked with "competitive lighting" would be really intense.
---
It would also give our trap operators something else to do with thier traps. Booby trap the circuit breaker? Or booby trap the OBJ?
---
Siege 2, baby.
---
your best bet will be to send in a ticket at ubisoft's support site or at r6fix.com
---
As long as it’s not a cav Ban. Like it’s just a waste of a ban and I get triggered over that
---
Well if it's only on Twitch it'd me not use to me personally. For some reason when I try to stream on Twitch I get constant buffering unless I stream in non HD quality, meanwhile I can stream the exact same game on YouTube in HD with no hiccups.
---
https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1152235275344592896?s=20
---
Yea that would work. But no other operator requires 2 ppl to counter him/her at the same time 😂
---
Anyone know how this works on Android?
---
FuZe Is ThE wOrSt AtTaCkEr! But seriously look at that skill
---
Only in high levels do people mostly drone out, low levels don't have any damn sense sometimes, and even some high levels like to just rush in
---
I have my own private theory that the servers are just bad at some points and slower wifi cant handle the amount of people on the server; thus, people with good wifi are unaffected, but with bad wifi you spike from 27 ping to 900. It happens to me.
---
I bought the black ice skins for his weapons back when they came out, so now I feel obligated to use him
---
Yeah I saw twitch one too
---
**CARGO SHORTS**
---
Be thankful you didn't have to complete 100 defensive Terrorist Hunts like the rest of us who got it before the patch.
---
Oh I'm boutta bust
---
[Okay here's](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/201893439766396928/602342360420188193/bank.PNG) something I made. Ignore how scuffed my paint skills are plox.
---
Orange = Castle barricades
---
Yellow = regular barricades
---
Grey = reinforcements
---
The strat requires a castle and a smoke/mute to hold above. The castle locks down the top floor and opens the hatch in closet, allowing you to hold the admin rotation hole from above. The castle in the room will protect you from anyone in the hallway.
---
The smoke/castle will blow holes in the floor so he can hold all the entranes from above, and will also help reinforce the two CEO walls at the back.
---
Entering the top floor hold will be impossible without alerting the defenders, as ash/zofia/sledge will be extremely loud in breaking them down- allowing you to react with plenty of time. 
---
Ideally you will also have a mute/bandit place his jammers on the CEO walls so they can't be breached, but his requires at least 3 players in a discord call to coordinate.
---
On site you have two anchors, ideally a doc and someone else. One will hold in each site, with a rotation hole in admin so your 1 roamer can get in from open area.
---
With this strat this site goes from pure garbage to being one of the best in the map, if not the entire game.
---
Blitz should be in B tier, he’s almost a must have in full party ranked squads. Along with being great team player he’s can protect himself while solo roaming perfectly fine. Also Kapkan is a great op, barely anyone looks for traps and it does decent damage, also he has impacts.
---
I think it would be really cool, and add a whole new level of depth and play. I doubt ubi hasn't thought if this though. Unfortunately, it's something they might save until a potential sequel. The current game engine would have a hard time with it though, as lighting, especially interior lighting is kinda weak/isn't meant to be turned off/on, make rooms dark. Etc
---
Well then Sam Fisher needs to be an Operator!!
---
There’s 4s of us!
---
I’m a degenerate at this point
---
Cool idea but please just take a screen shot next time.
---
Sorry, I only had a one day pass to cc. I got fuze and dokkabei.
---
Lmao only if
---
They could also make it where the person who leaves mid Match goes down a rank like if they were gold 2 and they leave they will go to gold 3
---
Didn't even attempt to square the camera with the monitor either. How this isn't top comment is beyond me
---
Lol add an entire game changing feature to give Castle a buff.
---
It won't work. period.
---
&gt;Thatcher’s weapons are good and so is his ability, but there are alternatives to him.
---
What alternative? No other operator can destroy electronic gadgets so quickly and efficiently.
---
&gt; You want them to rebuild a game completely,
---
No, I want them to build a functioning game without legit gamebreaking bugs and garbage ranked play. Y'know, the thing everyone *already* paid for?
---
The lighting in the game is already kinda dogs, doing this would just rape the engine limitations and fuck over low spec players. Also people would just starting their brightness to max or whatever.
---
The implementation would be clunky regardless.
---
Take my updoot you dirty sumbitch
---
I mean, to be fair, Tom Clancy’s games are never super realistic. They’re always about delivering an exciting, tactical firefighting experience while revolving around hyper advanced gadgets.
---
Twitch. Better guns, efficient ability
---
My friends and I dead ass talked about this in season 2
---
Its ok
---
People would literally just max their brightness and nothing would change. All it would do is make maps like themepark even MORE unplayable, and fuck over anyone who doesn't have a 1000$ monitor.
---
Finka is probably a little easier to use since the primary gadget is easier to make use of. Plus she has frag grenades which are great. 
---
If you do choose Finka I'd recommend using the machine gun since the Spear is pretty mediocre at best.
---
Spooky scary  S L E D G E
---
Hey! You found your glove it looks like! (R0gue, the bandit at invite)
---
Play battlefield 4 until it happens. Also, come on man you don't know how to screenshot?
---
Clearly you've never witnessed the power of T H E S U N. It's an HK416 with 8 flashlights. Guaranteed to blind those puny NVG users and anyone else on the wrong end of the barrel.
---
Thank
---
In no way is it even close to being as efficient or as reliable as Thatcher's ability.
---
Yo why my nigga Chanka in bottom?
---
Am I the only one who think's IQ's guns suck? the 552 bounces so much compared to every other AR, the AUG is unusable, and the LMG is an LMG
---
Ying is infinitely better than finka, finka is a casual only operator. Finka also actively fucks over your team to an incredible amount, imagine being mid spray with blackbeard angled grip and your teammate presses their button...
---
This has actually gotten me killed before at match point, losing us the game. 
---
Ying is both fun and very viable, I would highly recommend her over finka ANY DAY.
---
Except you wont get a one shot head shot and its easily the worst shot gun in the game. It's not even a guaranteed kill at close range and theres no kill at a distance.
---
0/10 no recruit

All memes aside, in a game that heavily relies on movement, having a mounted turret is the last thing u want
---
He too good for this list my guy
---
R/wooosh
---
Holy fuck I never even thought of that. Doesn’t even seem that far fetched.
---
This would benefit renown grind bots a lot. I've ran into two of them the last couple of days, just joins and occasionally crouched or proned on spawn.
---
50 ingame with "0.003379" as your multiplier.
---
The only way to get kicked from a match is to kill a teammate after reverse friendly fire RFF is activated. To do this though you'd have to kill them with an explosive since gun fire would only damage you. 
---
For RFF to activate in the first place you need to kill a teammate or inflict enough damage to your teammates for it to activate.
---
It would also completely alter current gameplay. lol
---
Its not that difficult to throw your drone next to any device and shock it. Only downside i can think of are jammers
---
i see nothing wrong with this. only the foolish will suffer
---
Ok you were on thin ice there buddy
---
Cool concept just feel like it changes the game ALOT and it would be a curveball for all players.
---
Not everyone has an rtx 2080
---
If you shoot someone in the body too much you get a reverse friendly fire mechanic activated, if you keep shooting you die.
---
If you do it agian you get kicked I believe.
---
You have clearly killed far too many people recently.

###Caps lock title

Please re-post your submission using standard letters.

Look up due process aswell

That would be great as it's own gamemode.
---
Lol I know, people take these charts seriously, which has kinda become a meme in of itself, I never take any of em seriously, cus I see them so much, I've just stopped caring.
---
Problem with blitz is that his hitbox is really bit. On ranked if you against good players, you probably wont get a kapkan kill.
---
I got it as well
---
It's really good idea and I would love to see but I feel like all people would have to do is turn up the brightness...
---
I feel like the CZ is by far the more viable weapon, since you can actually get kills under your own skill.
---
The SMG-12 is more of an RNG gun. I prefer it on vigil purely for the destructive ability.
---
Wasn’t this what we thought one of the ops was gonna be a few seasons ago? Blackout or something was the name
---
What
---
God what about a fucking screenshot Jesus Christ
---
Gl to you too.
---
552 is decent but no one picks her because of her low ROF compared Ash’s R-4C and her not-so-flashy gadget.
---
r/unexpectedgimli
---
Cant deny she one of the best
---
These are some epic gamer moments
---
No. This is the whole reason Mozzie got implemented. If you can’t get into obj, then mozzie did a good job. The game shouldn’t be one-sided just because you say so. What if you were the bandit trying to bandit trick the garage? Would you be happy with a free twitch drone running around obj?
---
Yessss halo gun halo gun give Ubisoft
---
Capitao is good because... why not? There's no real disadvantage to having him, so I honestly just perma pick him. He's also a surprisingly good alternative to Ash since he's still a 3 speed at the end of the day.
---
Statistically you’re average as well. I have no reason to believe you’re any smarter than anyone else here.
---
Are they scouting area 51?
---
What about bandit/maid/mute vs thermite and thatcher?
---
Where'd you get the idea that you don't need to buy Quarantine when it releases? It's the Siege engine and all but isn't titled as Siege whatsoever
---
Nokk is actually scp-096 from an alternate reality where it is part of an mtf unit, change my mind.
---
ikr like honestly, why would a Smoke Elite which you can directly buy with R6 Credits be the Plague Doctor Skin that literally everyone is asking for?
---
It's much better for Ubi to put it in the Halloween Packs which you need to unlock by paying for the whole collection, because SurpriseMechanics™
---
Hahaha before mozzie the bandit would have to deal with the twitch drone coming in to the garage while he bandit trucks and honestly it wasn’t a big problem cuz the drone is very loud and you can hear it coming. But mozzie is just too op
---
Many better picks. Ash, Hibana, and Maverick.
---
Possibly, the big with debris staying in barricades has been around for 4 years and they’re going to change that soon, so they could change leaning. You could try bring inv it up to ubi on forums to try and see if they’ll change it. It’s worked before, and I wouldn’t complain if that happened.
---
As if I fucking read that, I just scrolled thourgh and turned it off without a second thought, I was more worried about video settings than aim assist
---
for some reason I can vision this, kicking down barricades, and I see how this could work with the nomad animation.
---
I will certainly try this thanks!
---
EFT may not be the gold standard here. [Check out insurgency's night maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpIbAG2EAkU) if you really wanna see night maps done right
---
Almost all maps already got the base for it. You can turn off all lights with thatcher (even the fire bins on theme park) they just turn back on after a bit. (People keep forgetting that thatch turns off lights...)
---
Also. Wildlands also runs on AnvilNext and that game has shootable lights. I dont really see why R6 couldnt have that.
---
No but thermite and thatcher are different because thatcher is the one that counters all those operators not thermite. Thermite just gets the reinforcements open after thatcher counters those operators
---
Imagine waking up and seeing THAT staring at you
---
This would make caveira so op tho.
---
Still a mad idea
---
Suppressor are trash
---
This is just what they should have done for Halloween one year
---
*when the f2 gets nerfed*
---
Okay, what if you're attacking snow mobile on Chalet.
---
You have a Thermite, Thatcher, Buck and Maverick.
---
In this situation you need either Capitao or Montagne.
---
&gt; I honestly never use her gadget when I play her because you can seldomly do anything with it. Generally you are too close to enemies before you start getting within ping range of her gadget, and even then if you place a gadget well you can't destroy it even if you know where it is.
---
In the least rude way possible, you’re using her wrong. The range is fine, 20m is more than enough to scan safely. You don’t need the scanner out 24/7 but you should be using it pretty frequently if the enemy has an electronic heavy line up. 
---
IQ hard counters so many strong operators already she’s in no need of a buff. If the enemy has a Valk, Echo, Lesion, Pulse, and/or Vigil you should be scanning pretty much every room before you enter at the very least there’s seldom that are so large that you can’t scan the entire room from outside it. 
---
When you’re pushing a the site with teammates, for the most part, you should have your scanner out until the Yokai and Valk cams are dealt with. 
---
&gt; It was definitely a mistake taking away her grenades because they were her most valuable tool in actually destroying defender gadgets.
---
Only certain gadgets. Not to mention, most people used them to get kills anyway and it’s a 
---
waste of frags to use them to destroy gadgets. The operators who IQ hurts the most don’t have gadgets that typically require frags to deal with. 
---
Except maybe some cheeky echo spots, there’s nothing that frag grenades would do to make it easier for IQ to deal with her main counters. 
---
 There’s no place to put a meaningful Valk cam that you can’t just shoot out. 
---
Lesion mines in windows are pretty much the only occasion where you would need frags and even then, you can just go somewhere else.  
---
Pretty much the only operators who IQ would need frags to deal with it Ela, Maestro and potentially Bandit and Mute and anyone with bullet proof candy Other than them, IQ can deal with almost all battery hard gadgets with her pistol.
---
But Maestro doesn’t need another counter and bullet proof cams can be punched or or blown up at range by Zofia and Ash, so it should never be that much of a problem. 
---
Everyone else has gadgets that can be shot normally without the assistance of grenades or counters the grenades anyway in the case of Jäger. 
---
&gt; Plus I don't think the German pistol is all that good. I'd much rather have the FBI 5.7 or the SAS P226 because they just have a lot nicer sights.
---
It’s nothing spectacular but it gets the job done. You’re not Cav, you’re not getting kills with her pistol unless you’re hunting Pulse or Vigil. And even then, often times you’ll switch to your rifle anyway.
---
That’d be pretty cool. It’d be like an objective to defend outside if the bomb site. As a defender you would have to put a person in that room.
---
Recruit provides no utility to any team regardless of the game mode, choosing him on defense hinders his team more than it helps because he gets one less reinforcement and has no primary ability. He was meant to be a free choice to players who didn't have any operators. Him getting removed from the ranked pool is a good thing.
---
This actually makes a surprising amount of sense.
---
How tf, did u carry your team every single game? Cuz every time I solo queue I get teammates that go 4 rounds without a single kill
---
Throw them in the room when you're buddy is trying to plant lol. It's insanely simple.
---
I like how you say "revealed" like it's some big secret that Ubisoft just revealed to the public.
---
It’s weird because my ping was about 20 and then I spent 3 weeks at my dad’s in Idaho and when I came back and tried to play here in Cali my ping is about 80 but jumps to 180 occasionally.

I just thought of this, maybe it's already kinda in the game, but what if jackal had a thermal camera on his headgear? He could see where bullet casings dropped from where people were shooting and go long they stood there, if they were prone or standing. Just small changes like that would be an awesome slight buff to jackal.
---
Well guess what
---
&gt;!not me fam sorry!&lt;
---
Honestly the buff i want is a quicker switch from gadget to non gadget.
---
And if i have her primary out and tap the bumper out of her gadget, have it being out her primary quickly.  I dont want to go  from gadget, to pistol, to primary.
---
She is just so slow.  Pulse doesnt have this problem and he gets c4.  Yet she cant even have frags
---
I know it’s that simple, but I found more uses for breach charges especially cause my friends don’t usually plays softbreachers. (I try to make up for it with breach charges or playing sledge.) that being said I usually get myself killed with smokes.
---
Wouldn’t this take sometime to do for each map though?
---
https://i.redd.it/8f8s5k5llob21.jpg
---
Not always free Elo for the 5 I’ve one many of ranked with a one man deficit
---
You shouldn't.  Prefiring doors is part of the game.
---
Honestly If you're having this problem you just need to get better at the game.
---
Yea I try
---
Same
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but you wont find people like that on console
---
Maybe Nøkk and Warden were operators they had on the back burner/freezer? We know Nomad was the first operator from the freezer, maybe these two are the newest from the freezer
---
That's too realistic for this game.
---
Well this just makes recruit a must pick, and ubisoft is trying to remove recruit from the game. This would be terrible for the game balance and play.
---
You can pick whoever you want, apart from Tachanka who is usually a sign of someone throwing. In an ideal world you would want a hard breacher and people like Thatcher/Twitch to get rid of Bandit batteries or Mutes jammers, but no one is going to force you or complain. If they want it that bad they will pick them. Basically pick who you want and have fun, don't force yourself to play how you don't want to.
---
or just give us a flashlight attachment we can turn on and off
---
Inb4 everyone says you were lagging or aim was off
---
Finka/Fuze's, Ying's, Maestro's (but not in that order)
---
Melee?????
---
Echo time
---
I think he’s actually pretty good, he can hold down a mira very well with his gadget. For example, default mira in hallway on servers on bank, bomb
---
You can use a usb flash drive to get the video from your ps4. From there you can put it on your pc and sync it to your phone or you can email it to yourself and save the attachment (depending on clip size)
---
It'll be cool but I think this can only happen in siege 2.
---
They should save that for a proper Spies vs Mercs game.
---
Bruh give thermite his nades back
---
Esports are forcing the game to be balanced. It was never a realistic shooter. Chill.
---
Ok I’ll try that, thanks!
---
bruh 👏👏🙌🙌🙌
---
+1
---
Plus defenders will camp at the circuit breaker. It might distract from the objective
---
Scp memes in R6? _Nice_
---
I agree with your point but this game was built as a realistic game that didn't anticipate much success and was meant to be in the vein of the other Rainbow Six games, but it became a hit after the community pushed for support through its first year.
---
Since it gained popularity its been balanced and improved to be an eSports game and is being treated as such nowadays.
---
No not really, you just bought a season pass with an average skin
---
Because House is a extreme beta map..
---
Yes, he died of cancer. And what about all the other players that died of cancer? What about the players that died because of a drunk driver or because they got deployed and didn't come home? Why does this one guy get immortalized ingame and not any of the others?
---
That's because nøkk is from the Danish special forces
---
Got it. TY.
---
This works on the Android app as well.
---
#wat
---
The game shouldn't be allowed to go pitch black but dark red UV lights should come on
---
They should bring back his breaching charges and nades back
---
Purchased a $3 account or changed his name
---
im not judging how or why, i just find it funny.
---
Playing on night maps is bad enough for me, and this would give defenders a boost — something we don’t need. This could be a cool mini game mode though.
---
Those are textures on the map not footprints
---
I’m still in high school, so there’s not much I can really do here, I used to play a lot more than I do currently. Now I’m averaging about 18-25h every 2 weeks. I used to play a lot of siege because I had no friends but now I’m balancing it between fitness, social interaction and driving so I wouldn’t say I’m addicted anymore.
---
It literally doesnt matter how you see it. They are lootboxes, you said it yourself. The bill is about removing lootboxes (and lootboxes in that bill are something you open and get random thing, it doesnt matter what are the chances, if you open something and it doesnt have 100% chance of getting the one 1 you have to be informed of getting its considered lootbox, you have to know what youre gonna get and it cannot be random). Is it gamblig? No. Does it matter? Fucking no its still a lootbox
---
The bill will most likely go thru but it still can be somewhat changed but lootboxes are most likely going to get removed
---
No, every lootboxes, doesnt matter if you pay for them or no
---
Vigil will be op here because he can just hide in the shadows since he looks like a silhouette
---
Yo remember when he just gassed all people with the plague, and not cause trouble like in his bio lmao
---
Di-did you clutch the ace?
---
Just sayin
---
They are being removed because of gambling which is spending REAL MONEY on a random chance, alpha packs can only be brought with renown, they’re still loot boxes, just not the bad ones
---
If you want to get out into higher ranks dont blame it all on your teammates. Just focus on what you can do better and improve on because that's all that you can do.
---
I did. Not too proud of it because they just rushed me one by one lmao
---
Are there any rectangular pistols with no visible hammer? If yes: you have a Glock.
---
Maybe make adult only lobbies or something but banning kids from playing the game is a dumb idea.
---
Or they could give us a map that's very dark. It'll be safer if it's restricted to an event
---
Only thing left to do is upvote the post so much that somehow it reaches the r6 devs teams and let them be the judge but yea if this got added it'll be so awesome!
---
I am trying my hardest i was top frag 5 games in a row today still lost all 4-0
---
negev
---
I think they would but Glock is a bitch to get licensing from, at least that’s what I heard.
---
Well here is the thing you can’t just bring a gun and call it a glock without copyrights and some of the secondary’s are glocks they are just named different because of copyright reasons
---
I've been saying to my friends for years that lights in siege should be able to be shot / turned off in some way if the players wanted to. Just like how you can shoot radios and speakers to better listen for movement, a change like this to lights would be beneficial for both sides and wouldn't really ruin any aspect of the game, and even adds to the destruction mechanics. Also some lights are just fucking annoying and either ruin your view through a site or are just plain distracting.
---
Why would you not just screen shot,
---
Outgunned, and out of luck.
---
Gaz, go around the back and cut the power. Soap, get ready!
---
It's a quote from cod 4.
---
True but that would be so cool tho mw2 had the g18 but it wouldn't be as cool if siege made one
---
Same but we got Blackbeard on defense
---
was this on Xbox this past Friday ? strange same happened to me on the same map last night
---
Oh god. Please don't do this in casual. Callouts are bad already please.
---
Cav duh
---
It's quite tough game design to make darkness work as an important mechanic in a shooter.
---
If every player is a high-tech professional soldier, then all of them can be carrying NVGs, and the final result of the darkness mechanic is to palette-swap everything into ugly colors.  Then the cosmetic skins aren't visible, and those cosmetics are funding the game...
---
Warden
---
I could only imagine
---
I don't see any problems with button adjustments on pc, however console maybe difficult.
---
I don't play console myself, but I think opening/closing could be a single "F" click(whatever it is on console), while barricading could be holding "F".
---
Locking a door may be another story tho :/
---
I would be too lol i hate when people can't just play the game fair and let people have fun
---
&gt; It’s just getting boring always playing the game with the same operators being banned every match.
---
Feel the same way.
---
The current ban system is great compared to nothing. But I wish they would disable the ability to vote for an operator or two randomly.
---
Example: Ban phase starts. Jackal and Bandit are greyed out where nobody can vote to ban them this game.  Next game another two random ops get greyed out.
---
That could be it but sometimes it could be the people who you match against and that depends on your rank sometimes too because I’m gold 4 and a lot people I play with or against can be really toxic
---
Ive played whole rounds where I’m exclusively operating a drone, essentially making it a 4v5 fight, the call outs and intel on enemies positions and gadgets usually always result in my team winning. It’s about the actual OBJECTIVE, not ego boosts and kills.
---
Not here to micromanage your recording skills (lol) this is amazing!
---
It's not really a funny joke though. All it does is cause people to talk down to those they think are worse than them, when in reality everyone has bad games.
---
So they left when the score was still 1-1? That's really shitty.
---
"you monster"
---
By playing Cav and murdering a buck.
---
Now whether you do it in-game or IRL is your choice, but let me warn you that life insurance doesn't cover voluntary IRL damages.
---
Just not nook and your fine
---
I haven't played ranked since like one match in burnt horizon because it just got toxic, which being unranked may keep away a lot of the toxicity
---
this is actually cool, hope this gets in the game.
---
Mr Beast teasing a new defender with a cannon 👀
---
ok ur opinions duly noted
---
I play both and for console you have to hold square to barricade doors and press square to reload
---
Why do I feel like I’m gonna be one of those people that wooosh
---
Just don't play Nook and your fine
---
Thermite M870
---
Nøkk.
---
Seeing a skull painted face is all spooky and all, but have you ever tried to spot somebody desperately in a camera, only to get off and see them in your face, under a wire mesh mash, with a glowing yellow hand?
---
Nah. That's something I can't un-see.
---
The ban phase?
---
I like the idea, it would be hard to implement however. They have to be very careful not to break the balance and flow of the game. Also think if they'd add them to already existing maps or add them to all the new maps in the future.
---
But thats a good idea for a new op, one that rienforces doors making them only breakable with a breaching charge (or a thermite charge, hibana etc etc)
---
Look me up on R6Tab. Console player I'm guessing?
---
I've bottom fragged plenty of games simply because of bad luck or play style differences before.
---
One round I was playing sledge and holding an angle. I'm staring at it for 20 seconds, before I turn away. As soon as I turn a bandit peeks me and instantly kills me.
---
Other times I die to some anchoring doc (I play holo/angled/laser on everything since i play entry fragger) since I simply can't compete with an ACOG at long distances.
---
Other times my teammate just gets all the kills before I have time to. Other times I choose to play safe and let my teammates get the kills, such as covering the defuser post plant.
---
Not on TTS now that the torch sounds like a god damn jet engine
---
The "A POS" on his vest is his blood type but I have no idea what the JM16 means.
---
I feel like this would be more of an advantage to the defenders.
---
It will mostly likely will my friend is a silver four and he hardly deals with toxic people and I honestly just might drop down so I don’t have to deal with toxic people
---
It is, and he won't be coming back because Ubisoft made it clear that they don't want a liability in a game revolving around operators with specific gadgets
---
For someone who says full body shields are counter able, your nothing better than a gold 2.
---
Nothing.
---
Loadouts are fine so far. I'd rather not risk losing balance for some pointless nostalgia.
---
There’s no bans
---
None.
---
Literally none. They'll hear you regardless.
---
Among the 3, DEFINITELY gridlock.
---
She's too good.
---
Notice how I didn't say Clash's counter was nades or fire bolts. Because it's so fucking easy to just press V on your keyboard to kill her. I also explicitly didn't mention Monty in my comment because he's an actually useful op.
---
Imagine telling me to go play gold 4 ranked while complaining about Clash omegaLul.
---
ohh ok thanks for letting me know
---
Pick and ban is dogshit, take it out of the game.
---
Just me.
---
Thinking about playing a game like this gives me goosebumps. I'd probably shit myself if I get ran at while the powers off
---
1- 6p41
---
2- T95 LSW
---
3- mSAW (yes, I prefer to call it mSAW for differentiation purposes)
---
Honourable mention for the G8A1, the 850 RPM spray gun.
---
Tttt Tttttt
---
siege already has enough jump scares as it is, lol
---
Its because theyre fucking lazy lmao, its must easier to pasta redacted into all fields than actually figure something out
---
Yeah , we need a new engine .
---
0/10 muh immersion ruined
---
And it should be kinda like a heavy attack. It would take a long swing and must be slower than melee. :D
---
I swear I never felt as inconfident doing sth as when playing videogames.
---
In every closecombat situation I loose and just freak out and die.
---
Castle mains unite
---
Haha fuck OP amirite
---
This isn’t your average toxicity, this is advanced toxicity
---
Right, that's my point is that it **won't ever** be used correctly in pugs. Pick and ban is a pro thing, and that's where it should stay. **Ubi has this sick perverted view of what pug ranked should be.**
---
 They're trying to make it like pro league, make the game **sweatier and more tryhard** at the cost of newer players or casual players.
---
 In my opinion pick and ban has absolutely no place in public ranked, as it defeats the purpose of even having it. ***There's no tactical or strategic element to banning Jackal every fucking game in the season.***
---
People are scared of strong operators so they ban them, just like echo and blitz, when in reality someone like those two are **easy** to counter. 
---
**The whole point** of Pick and Ban, the whole reason it was invented, was for **pro league, 5-stack, synergetic teams** who ban x and y on various maps for ***various strategic reasons,*** be it because of the nature of the map or the objectives. Not because "cAv ScArY".
---
 It's the same thing with making ranked bomb only. What possible fucking reason did they have for making ranked bomb only? Oh because the Pros play bomb only oh okay. All it does is limit the content and replayability of the game to pug players, you know the 98% of people who play the game.
---
And what happens after all of this? They nerf strong, solid operators for absolutely no reason aside from some filthy bronze player repeatedly banning echo because he doesnt know how to run Thatcher or IQ.
---
They're nerfing Echo, the number one most defensive, area denial, plant denial anchor for no reason. He's not broken, he's never been broken. He's just strong, and that's how he should be, **it's how he was designed to be.**
---
 Theyre nerfing Jackal, who definitely does not need a nerf, in the most useless way possible, instead of just making Mute a hard counter. 
---
They're nerfing shield Ops because people don't know how to throw a c4, when in reality the shield ops are fine.
---
They're nerfing Maverick, a stealth based attacker, by making him....louder. Once again, Mav is not unbalanced and doesn't need to be touched. He is not a breacher, his job is not entry, it's putting pressure on anchors. There's no reasoning with enough sense to make an already balanced and underpicked operator weaker. 
---
And they're buffing Nokk in the most useless way imaginable, instead of giving her loadout an upgrade.
---
And they refuse to acknowledge Warden, who is now the **worst** defender in the game. 
---
Ubi has their head up their ass, and anyone who says they're listening to there community is full of shit.
---
Time to make some in BO2
---
If my internet was shit at the moment. Please explain. How was i able to join a new round of ranked DIRECTLY AFTER without them offering me to join a new match of ranked. And why was i getting a ranked 30 min ban MIDGAME of a another RANKED match? Explain please :)
---
Stopping halfway and pleasing nobody:
---
*It's the Ubisoft way!*
---

Ah okay haha. Arcade mode or something with deathmatches/rotating gamemodes would be cool

I used to draw out sketches for maps and I had the same idea
---
What is this Quarantine every one is posting about?
---
Have always been kinda upsetti spaghetti you couldn't shoot out the lights
---
That actually sounds really cool would make the game more interesting!
---
And with a squad, yes.
---
Ever beat a team of gold sweats (5stack) with some unranked random? It truly is a great feeling.
---
Do people not search the sub before posting ideas?
---
This is asked at least twice a month. Answer is already no. Because A, it is game breaking, and B, mute needs no changes.
---
I also use Shadowplay\\Share and they upload to YT with no problems.
---
Good guide. Probably the highest skill ceiling on an OP
---
"what if we make grenades dislodge a bomb from it's position?"
---
Yeah actually did that 
---
But sometimes the high ranked guys arent the best either
---
How about an attacking operator that temporarily cuts the power and has the ability to see more in the dark, although it would only work on night maps it seems like a pretty cool idea.
---
I figured it out! Here's a link to a post I just made with the video attached.

Ok thx
---
Btw sorry if I did something wrong to get all those downvotes:(
---
Yeah dude. The other day I got pissed off while playing with a full team of friends. I kept dying without a kill even though I was lighting people up with chest and headshots. Threw down my headset, and just kind of went through the motions without caring anymore. And like after another game, I was all of a sudden top of our team for almost every game after that. Nearly pulling off an ace twice.
---
You are a night owl haha are you around 18 hours

Its cool and all, but what exactly does kaid have to do woth desert storm?

---
Are you telling me that the expert team of developers on Ubisoft can't polish their games?
---
Dishonor on you dishonor on your family dishonor on your cow!
---
lol of course I'm getting downvoted for making a simple mistake, never change, Reddit.
---
Yeah, a few people have mentioned it, and I would agree, but both bullets 50 and 49 hit, which doesn’t make sense. I guess it really do be like that :’(
---
I hate when I pick thatcher and give call outs of spawn peeks. Thermite always dies

Well then I guess you don’t like wasting time

I don't really give a shit about muh immersion btw I'm just saying what's up. No need to long post lmao.

Happy birthday! Here’s a birthday tip for you, try using her holo site on maps with tight corners and peeks, I think you’ll love it :)
---
I love the banning. Don't take it away from us lowly silvers.

I dont see why that would ever be a problem. If you arent already ads’d when you see an enemy your typically screwed no matter what ads speed ur gun has

I would never use flashlight, it would reveal my location. Such a stupid gadget in a competitive shooter.

Good idea, until you get into higher tier ranked matches where that window is prefired 100% of the time

And they were both white males
---
That's called lag
---
To be fair sometimes that just doesn’t appear at all
---
HOW? Okay

I’m here for ya!

I am gonna replace the whole game with minecraft sounds

I mean it's not bulletproof. Probly just got shot through it

Bf4 is such a good game. Nice job as well

We were 2-1 and suddenly my teammates left one by one. I planned to throw the game but I'll take the free win.

Oh god they’re just gonna disable headshots

I love nøkk too!
---
&gt;You're missing the point. The system was created and designed for pro play, not pugs. It was never in pugs before because **wasn't fucking designed to be there.** And now that it's here what's happened?
---
&gt;The people who are good get matched with some pk randies who don't know you can kill blitz with a c4 from a mile away and who ends up getting banned? Game after game after game after game?  Jackal, Echo, Blitz, and Cav. 
---
Ubi doesn't care about coppers, bronzes and silvers. They consult pros when they make changes. Just cause they only show us the charts doesn't mean that's the only data they use. They only care for consistent and releatable data, which is available at plat, diamond and PL.
---
Go to the PL sub and you'll see the abundance of support for a blitz and Monty nerf from casters, coaches and pros. I was in a discussion with Mzo where he said exactly this, that blitz and Monty have multiple issues that must be ironed out, starting with hipfire adjustments and melee hit, and that's exactly what has happened. They even supported the alteration of Jackal, but not as vehemently as they wanted blitz nerfed.
---
So, yes, they don't give a flying føkk about anybody below plat, even if they say "we want to make them less annoying". That's just a reason to keep us happy, and anybody with 10 IQ knows that.
---
&gt;Why? It's not because they're broken. It's because simp ass randos don't want to play against them out of convenience, which is the opposite of why Pick and Ban was created in the first place. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;The reason they were reluctant to add Pick and Ban prior to now was specifically because they were worried something like this would happen, and it takes away from the game. 
---
Am I allowed to say that you missed the point that **THIS IS A TEAM BASED TACTICAL SHOOTER?** Which means you are SUPPOSED to have a team? One has ALL the resources to get one and imporve, and he chooses to curse Ubi for not catering to a solo rusher with 0 communication in a game revolving around communication?
---
That's stupid. Nothing is stopping him or her from playing the game at it's fullest other than his or her own stupidity and ego and wishes to get free Reddit karma.
---
&gt;And like I said, they're gonna look at the data and take it as "Oh well Echo is broken, Jackal is broken, shields are broken since they keep getting banned so let's just nerf them!" And that's exactly what the fuck they're doing and it's gonna keep happening because ***Pick and Ban was not designed for pug games.***
---
No. Just cause the give us 
---
&gt;You really think it's a fair statement to tell the ENTIRE playerbase they're incompetent because they don't make 5 stacks every single game and study strats and maps and what Ops would be devastating on what's objectives and why to ban them? Across all three platforms? You think that's a fair thing to say? 
---
Yes. It is fair. And I'm calling myself incompetent as well because sometimes I'm just lazy to go out and get a squad and solo queue, but I know the flaws in that and instead don't complain that Ubi isn't catering to solo players in a game designed for team plays. Yes, it is fair, because this game was designed with a format to be played which was made evident and the tools provided to do the same. You are free to play it the way you please, but you cannot curse the developers when you choose to play it in a way that isn't in-line with the ACTUAL playstyles that was made evident Because that is a choice you made.
---
Pick and ban wasn't designed for stacks only. 6th pick was designed for stacks only. PnB was designed for communication, which can be achieved with simple use for the mic. Now if the playerbase can't do that, then that's a playerbase problem. Not the system's problem.
---
&gt;Let me tell you, **the good players that are high gold and above already do that.** They ALREADY do that, but I'd hope you'd realize that rando casuals far outweigh veteran players. 
---
There's casual for that.
---
&gt;So yes, I will blame Ubi for this whole season being dogshit. Two of the least picked, least played, weakest operators, a map rework that nobody asked for and has already been forgotten about, and pick and ban being in the game. 
---
So what? The content creation sits idle and doesn't release anything? You do realise that the content team is different from the bug fixes and development team, don't you? They announced that. They released weak ops. Fine. They can always buff them. Now they'll have data of 22 million players.
---
Also, kafe was busted. Had only 1 viabke site. I've argued with people who've willingly chosen to turn a blind eye to the obvious for almost an entire season, so I'm not going to waste time on that.
---
&gt;Ubi has always been incompetent all throughout the life of Siege, with nonstop, game breaking bugs, broken operators, shit servers, and them still not addressing the DDOS problem in Plat.
---
They've addressed ddos. They also said it is hard to differentiate between a normal net snap, which doesn't deserve a ban, and a ddos where the cause deserves a ban, so they are working on it. You are free to walk in and give them a solution.
---
&gt;***Also Mavs torch was n e v e r silent, those $10 earbuds you're using just weren't hearing him ;)***

I usually take things more seriously when i'm alone which is why i went that horribly far. Especially since I was also in a really bad mood. But at least you seem to understand how i feel about it, which is kind of comforting. I'm not sure i can ever play it again, or at least in it's current state. But for now i do need a long break for sure.
---
I ban him in Chateu and Bank

Was about to install it again. Thanks you saved me some rage.

i run 30 V, 40 H, and 38 ADS
---
running a high sens is better for flicks, but it's much harder to hold tight angles and aim at range. don't ever run a sens under 30, your aim will be incredibly slow.
---
running a middle of the road sens is good, with each sens being between 35-60 ideally so you get benefits of both low and high sens
---
Or maybe it was 20x but still
---
I would ~~hope~~ think a company like Ubisoft could manage to not make it game breaking
---
Also a preference thing, but I’m on xbox and play at 45-45, Advanced Rotation, Deadzone at 8-8.

Hmm... You must be new around these parts then? 😂

No, more of an incredibly naive OG player wanting some nostalgia 😪

Yeah maybe for defenders but mostly when I play attackers I go for longer ranges out of the range for the smgs so let's say glaz wouldnt help with a high fov but like ash rushing yes that would help her. But the reason I say 80 it's a good number between max and min so you dont have to change it when you want to play longer ranger or change it when you go shotgun

i'd rather not have to play against jager, bandit, and SMG-11 acog. i also think you're forgetting how bad the old lighting was, it was near impossible to see outside as a defender. plus, the old Hereford was a broken, unbalanced mess. it would be a cool nostalgia thing, but pretty broken from a gameplay standpoint.
---
correct. I have mine at 6

East US

Ooust. Recruit elite is needed

the DDOS problem started popping up on console about a year ago, but it wasn't nearly as big of a problem as it is now.
---
Gridlock is unavailable right now. She's at McDonalds.
---
Oh. That’s a shame, I’m just glad me nor my friends had to experience it
---
I don't necessarily agree that it's defender sided but I do prefer the playstyle of defenders more. I have a hard time deciding on an Attacker to consider my "main" while on Defense I have a handful I love a lot.

Now he get's nerfed.

drax would be proud

It’s cargo shorts

Exactly i noticed if the enemy headshots me first but i still pull the trigger,  hear my gun fire but die instantly it's like my bullets magically disappear from the game and the enemy takes no dmg
---
Such a waste of time...
---
Yer fair enough try ask for some elo back
---
I always prefire that window.
---
I don’t rely on hip fire when I use a shield op, I am happy with this change.
---
it’s that war helmet dawg
---
Why does it always have to be spetsnaz
---
Been there, done that
---
Your retard
---
Headshots do something like 15x damage, which is always an instant kill.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
You died bcs the blood is on a screen for a few frames. Youbshot him i a chest your ads gone on his head and then he killed you, but blood was still on a screen when you had ads on his head.
---
*shoots 1 bullet, still has 30 shots*
---
*reloads anyway*
---
Well, idk, i don't play siege to be on a professional team, i jus play to have fun every once in a while. I think the lights thing would give the game another touch of realism (in casual~). If it's too much of a problem then they should change the game modes to "fun", "tryhard" and "ranked" :3
---
“No! Andy! It’s just bolognese!”

Hello ChubbyCretin! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:

"But is also needs to make sense" at this point, barely. Glaz's rifle can go through the windows on airforce one with not one problem whatsoever but Clash's shield? Nope, bounces right off.
---
How are they defending it lmao
---
Internet conection is a problem :) Ubisoft serwers too ;)
---
Aw shot! May I ask how old your PS4 Slim is?
---
Ah thanks I'll remember that, I lost 3 games worth of mmr
---
I recommend going to r/seigeacademy for this
---
🤡🤡🤡
---
Alright
---
Her pickrate would skyrocket. And probably winrate too. This would be broken in ranked. Finkas fine
---
Honestly bullshit I play really early in the morning and late at night and this happens so many times that I play, that eventually I just switch to Ranked to get away from it.

I always just thought it was Lesion's version of Ying's armor

Not entire maps by themselves, but specific sites on maps. Good examples are:

* CEO Office and Executive Lounge (2nd floor site) on Bank.
---
* Work Office and Exhibition (2nd floor east site) on Skyscraper.

These are the 2 I've found, I'm sure others might be able to add to it.

I was queuing up in ranked with a friend and we got with a clan that ended up leave before I loaded in LOL and we almost won
---
happened to me twice with that same scope on gridlock's LMG ...
---
Bloody well played mate!
---
I don't know any other devs that at siege. (I am a dev)
---
The true solo queue
---
No, just no. Please No.
---
ping abuse is not a thing in Siege, I don't know why people still believe that. having high ping is a severe disadvantage
---
This same thing happened to me yesterday against a nomad..
---
The lag in terrorist hunt your experiencing probably is because of v sync. Go to options and find video then turn v sync off
---
Whenever you need to find players try to look at r/r6slfg or the officials rainbow six discord
---
I played this clip like 9 times now , goodness me 😂😂
---
I would love an option from like a 3 armor defender to be able to spartan kick shields
---
Ok thx for the tip, will try!
---
If you don't have open nat on your connection it might be a problem. Servers are shit in this game and this game have lots of problem. Only in R6 is laggy menu ;)
---
I hate when these explanations come out and everyone freaks out “look Ubisoft isn’t wrong!!”
---
Isn’t this another problem in itself? Shouldn’t everything be completely in sync so we don’t have issues like this? 
---
I understand some aspects of the game need to be server side and some need to be client side, but they NEED to be completely in sync to create a good gaming experience. There’s nothing more frustrating then being in a peak battle with someone just to see blood then die from them when they haven’t even turned the corner on your screen. 
---
Maybe the perspective needs to change? Idk I’m not a game developer but something needs to be done. This, on top of the MMR boosting issues, DDOSing, and defenders being 2 steps in front of me when I spawn on attack makes it REALLY difficult to enjoy the game. And I’ve been playing since beta.
---
Np let me know if it worked
---
Okay you are high
---
Yes he killed him.
---
I dont know about that but I'll take your word for it
---
I honestly don't understand what happened, did he get triggered and try to tk?
---
Ha
---
Lol me i bought it for 15K rewon (Yeah we can buy it )
---
I watched the video, you hit his neck bro. I dont think those count as a head anymore but im not sure
---
I am a dev and I have no idea
---
how you got it?
---
Probably not, but worth a shot anyway.
---
Yes adapter makes R6 think that m&amp;k is controller
---
I wish
---
So I’m not gonna lie I watched this clip about 10 times. I’m pretty sure you didn’t shoot his head. It looks like you JUST caught the top of his chest/neck and then he backed his head up into the blood spray. I could be wrong but I looked really closely
---
As someone who is knew to RB6, who has watched tons of tips and tricks videos, read guides on how to improve, one thing I didn't ever see mentioned was the importance of ROF. 
---
I was learning Sledge as tons of people said he's easy to learn, but I was struggling to get kills because his gun is too slow. I was getting domed before I even had chance to fire back over a couple rounds.
---
I've recently switched to Buck and Twitch, and I've improved on attack. I went 2-3 weeks using Sledge and struggling to frag. But swapping out to Buck or Twitch I've instantly improved, simply because their guns fire quicker. 
---
Anyone who is knew and reading this, I recommend using Twitch. Her Drone helps map knowledge too. I wasn't droning on any other operators, but now I've used Twitch I've realised the importance of droning and I now do it all the time.
---
Welcome to the British police force
---
Why
---
Hit reg has always been kinda broken
---
Sorry but what is open nat?
---
Good and quick thinking, you'll be great at the game in notime
---
second is really just kapkan minus the explosives
---
Honestly, she's pretty good for what she is now. The whole point of sidearm gadget is so you can't just now down people and then destroy every gadget in range. Pulse has a similar reason. It's too broken for the primary to be active.
---
He didnt hit the head.   
---
If you bother to check it you see the ammo count drop and a bullet fire when the crosshair is on the shoulder and then on the neck and then OP dies.   
---
The neck doesnt count as the head because its a game and a head is still a head without a neck.
---
holy fuck
---
Both consoles are the same shit lol
---
Not with Monty
---
And people say hit reg is not real
---
But likewise, teams that win uneven matches shouldn't gain as much.
---
lol the SASG would like a word
---
Hacker I assume?
---
But,  if this game takes place in the future (near or distant)  how old are they,  really?
---
Because its a game and a head is still a head if you take the neck out.   
---
Balance and fun.
---
Well damn
---
dosser, it’s a big problem on console, he can be considered a hacker but not really, it’s confusing
---
Till u can 1 tap headshot above bb’s shield
---
When slowing it down OP probably realized he wasnt aiming at the head when the bullets had been fired.  OP's solution.... Blur it massively with software so people cant see it.   
---
\*puts on tin foil hat\*
---
Then why is blood coming from his head if he got shot in the torso?
---
there are only 5 defenders with acog, plus attacker weapons are significantly better. this is an unneeded change
---
The SASG has much more recoil, bigger damage dropoff and isn't available on a 3-speed.
---
Oof how did that go
---
Idk dude, IQ is my main on atk. Her Aug with silencer and a cog is my go config. Her 552 with a similar config with foregrip. I've no problems with that, the lmg is the only one I don't use often, though when I first started that was the man weapon I used.
---
Well the game takes place in our time
---
Dont get why this has gotten so many upvotes.  the video shows him missing the head, Hitting the neck and shoulder.   
---
Neither of which count as a headshot for damage multipliers.
---
Holy f.cking sh.t dude you killed them
---
we beat him 3-0 after he tried hitting servers lol, he kept trying to get us to join his party to hit us off i suppose
---
Well that happens a lot but recently I’ve been getting spawn peaked in skyscraper by bandit or mozzie
---
Yeah it is possible but few people who ddos crash the server because no one gains elo doing it. They only usually crash the server straight in the begging at the end or if there team is down 3
---
Hello, my uplay is North.- and my discord is North#1493 please add me I am down to play

People that use MnK on console are pathetic.  Was the main reason I switched to PC 3 years ago. If I'm gonna have to learn MnK, I might as well play other people using MnK.
---
Xim users are the scummiest people around lmao.
---
Err one bad lot of hit reg doesnt mean its always bad when someone misses.  Explaining OP's post as not being a problem doesnt invalidate genuine problems.   
---
Absolutely nothing wrong with OP's situation when you watch the video. He misses the head and hits the shoulder &amp; neck. Neither of which are the head.
---
If you got some proof you can report him to Ubisoft by opening a ticket through their support platform
---
Shit like this reminds me why I’m taking a break from Siege
---
I'm not much of a Montagne player, but i felt good about this round. Baited out all of Smoke's gas and kept the British bros distracted for nearly the entire round. Felt this image was reddit-worthy, and just a little comical.
---
People r now thinking of this. This was the whole premise of shielders
---
i mean 106 win loss in ranked should be enough but no we didn’t record him actually attempting to do it
---
I managed to down a few by headshots, of course through penetration by objects which shouldn't be penetrated but still...
---
It wasn't a headshot that has happened to me alot you hit him between the neck and shoulder as close to the neck as possible and you saw it as a headshot coz your recoil pulled the sight at his head when the blood started to come out of him
---
I mean i would prefer to, but I don't really feel good about just asking for silver/gold players when im in mid-copper at best. It sounds like asking for boosting to me, and I certainly don't want that.
---
Stuff of nightmares

Pro league packs, not avaliable anymore

Well just a FYI, if you want people to check out your channel , don’t make the 1 minute teaser 30 seconds going to your YouTube channel then the rest just showing mvp screens. Thats not intriguing and didn’t grab my attention at all and doesn’t display anything of what your channel is like when it comes to content besides some low comedy with a boring teaser
---
It was from an event exclusive alpha pack. I lucked out and got it. Sadly, you won't be able to get it anymore.
---
I do miss a lot else about old siege too
---
Thats six invitationals outfit for doc only obtained by opening Six Invitationals pack which never returns

Ubugsoft
---
Sledge works great for me, and with buck/twitch you can only control and move your mouse so much.
---
The L85A2 does 47 damage per shot so depending on the health/range of your opponent you can 3 shot.
---
If you have played a game like CS for a while or at least used to you will know how to control the recoil for most of the guns in rainbow, therefore making it better for pixel peaks and long range gun fights.
---
I guess in the end what really matters most of the time is making sure your cursor is actually on the person you intend shooting, unlike OP the shot is clearly on the docks neck.
---

Hello r/softwaregore? Yes, this game right here.

It's limited time, it's a skin that came out when "Road to S.I." was a game mode in like Y4S2.
---
He had a pretty cringy profile picture I’m gonna say he learned it from fortnite
---
He also called me a potato
---
Highly situational but I do see this happen when you do a back push and get control of wine when attacking the garage of chalet. People’s first instinct is to just destroy all defender utility on sight, but the mira looking towards the garage wall/fireplace stairs can come in mega clutch if left closed
---
I’m on xbox so not surprising. It’s so annoying

Its an exclusive six invitational skin from the six invitational alpha packs. U cant get them anymore.

---
oh boy your in for a treat in the US
---
Damn. Thanks, everyone. Haven't been playing the game long enough to see the 2019 Invitationals.
---
The 50th bullet hit his neck I believe. That tripped me up because the blood appeared a bit after the ammo count went down so I thought you did hit his head.
---
It seems that I’ll go weeks without doing any trades, and then have 3-4 happen in the same day. Probably due to having different playstyles different days without realizing, and I guess playing more agressive will result in more trades?
---
Oh yeah this is 🅱️ig 🅱️rain time.

To replicate it in game, sorta.

Easier to make random height and write retacted for sure.

Every game would end in a draw because no one would be able to see.

Ah that's what it's called
---
You caused him to swallow his toothpick.
---
The bullets that killed him didnt come from doc...
---
Client side animations. From gridlock’s POV, he shot him in the head, but clearly she shot him in the Neck otherwise Doc would have died.
---
Funny, mine is made of potato

Not bad, but one claymore in that drone hole and you would be screwed

Looks like they're the only ones having fun anymore.

Or not, and we stop having people play recruit and waste a useful operator slot for the round

---
Bruh that’s not pengu
---
The only real buff the AUG could get would be changing how she holds it. The G8 is fine, you just can’t entry frag with it, and she doesn’t need frags, she was too versatile and Maestro doesn’t need another hard counter and there’s only like 1 or 2 gadgets where she’d need frags to destroy and that’s pretty situational.
---
Nope r6 tab me british_galaxy_ PS4
---
It's not like it would affect serious play, as Recruit is not in ranked, only casual.

Reporting in siege on console or via xbox? Indeed in siege it does absolutely nothing. But on xbox there’s this enforcement team checking the report what i’ve heard
---
Textbook definition of spray n pray.
---
I just watched the video, and although it looks like you should have killed doc, you didnt appear to die from his bullets but rather a second bullet stream that occured behind you, which bare in mind warden was still up. I dont think doc killed you
---
I’ve been playing ranked nonstop for like 2 weeks so hopefully by next season I can get my shit together and hit plat. 🙏🙏

And yes they are cheating with it in siege.

It may get refunded
---
I think it's because the slow mo probably also smooths out the video so it doesn't look frame by frame, and it does that by morphing the frames together in between. So the frames kind of slide into each other a lot more naturally.

Alibi is perfectly balanced imo. Her gun has ok damage but a really high fire rate so I don't feel a damage increase is necessary.

Ubisoft showed the hitbox problems when releasing Warden and Nokk. In the gameplay for them they show glaze hitreg just not registering. It's ok because it's an esport.
---
Same rule applies press X on your keyboard
---
Try a different controller? It worked for my friend. He had the same problem
---
Thats it
---
I’m going to start using this spot
---
Idk probably
---
Fair enough.
---
Hitreg isn't broken. The shot is fired when the ammo count goes down. But it doesn't register until a few frames later by then his recoil has pulled him up into the head. Shot actually hit the neck, which is not a part of the head hitbox.
---
Your new to the game. It's supposed to be this way GG

Do you know what a shield is?
---
No sadly the game wouldnt load in until the BB left
---
if i tries that, my bullets would go to the edge of the crosshair lol
---
BB's shield doesn't cover his entire head if you're even slightly above him. It can be as little as a few pixels, but if you want complete coverage as Blackbeard you need to be above whoever you're shooting at.
---
A lot of people still play it.
---
All the games after BF4 had had controversy to them, splitting the fan base across 3-4 games.
---
BFH wasn't really a battlefield game.
---
BF1 was too arcadey.
---
BF5 just fucking sucks.
---
BF4 Is usually the game people look to for a good, classic battlefield experience. Imo it's the last good one. I've been waiting 6 years for a new, good battlefield :'(
---
No, it is. They changed it in Year One.
---
I stared at this far longer than I should have
---
Oh god.. claymores
---
Only way to get rid of shitty random teammates is to do a 5 man
---
Haha alot of shit.
---
I have a clip of me getting a 3k and the last dude ran outside to rotate away from geisha. So I walk into geisha so I can wallbang him while he's in karaoke. I guess he somehow thought I was the enemy because he sprays me down as he entered the room.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
The bullet probably hit a pixel off the head into his shoulder/neck area. I can’t really tell when the bullet shot exactly but confusion like this happens a lot because after you shoot the bullet you move your crosshair over his head and than all the blood comes out, making it seem like you shot him right in the head
---
Probably nomad, these ops are all situational but nomads gadget is potentially the most consistent but she has the worst weapons out of the 3
---
He overstimmed
---
during the melee he exposes his head
---
Souja boy tell em
---
You think?
---
That's actually spot on, you nailed it mate.
---
I was already upset because I tked someone 2 rounds before because he walked in front of me while I was shooting a guy spawnpeeking that same window. He put it as intentional and tried to vote me out but failed.
---
на
---
ok sweet will do
---
He will be less picked at higher ranks. Lower ranks he will be over used but get killed more then normal.
---
I feel your pain, the other day I shot a enemy in the face with Dokkaebi rifle and put them at 1 hp
---
Why cant people just "git gud" at the game need to ddos people to win
---
Ah makes sense
---
Nice 😂 I sure love xbox players
---
Siege = flawless video game

•you shot doc in the neck. 
---
•warden killed you.
---

---
I like your flair
---
Woosh
---
Oh boy
---
Let me get the scroll. Well first of I threw my rank this season and all of my friends are in mid gold and I'm in copper four so dumbass teammates when I try, random dumbass glitches, bullshit headshots (ubi fix) and just other random ass things taht don't make sense
---
idk, the best part is he was with a diamond who had a 3 win loss and a .9 kd
---
unless blitz's shoulder is inside his fucking mouth i'm just gonna have to disagree on that one
---
You shot doc in the neck. The recoil pulled you up, your next shot was in the wall. &amp; warden was the one who killed you.
---
By the time you can react to that you would be dead, espacially if you take into account latency. Maybe on LAN you can
---
That was actually to his neck. If you watch clearly you will notice he shoots the bullet before he points through his head. And that blood may deceive you to think it's a hs .
---
Usually it shows if you have ping or packet loss, probably just bad server
---
Seeing as you’re the only person with this issue, it makes sense that the issue isn’t with the game, but rather with your set up. But if blaming things other than yourself feels good keep going.
---
The upper neck I'm pretty sure not the entire neck

Hello XuloGaming, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cg0bc3/im_going_to_picture_the_hostage_as_netflix_now/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

But op never said the Doc killed him.
---
I could be wrong but that’s how I remember it. My brain is kinda scrambled right now.
---
proleague awaits ya soldier.
---
No one plays glaz right now in high ranks. He doodoo as of right now.
---
possible, but i doubt it. most people that do that sort of thing have protection from it
---
Se, now just find those situations :I
---
Yes, that’s the point here, I was talking
---
First time?
---
*Is this the real life???*
---
i kinda feel, that 95% of the playerbase would dislike this. you know, everyone hates change anyway, and especially when it is a game changing, and not exactly needed. and people would still complain about not fixing things
---
Meme park is getting reworked, thankfully.
---
So I'd currently replace meme park with chalet in the sh*t tier list.

homie thats a tilde
---
Because not everybody understands the true meaning of "balance".
---
Hs does 120 dmg doc can overheal too 140hp
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.  
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).  
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.  
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because ~~Hiko was~~ you were already dead.
---
I probably use it more than his main gun, it just fits my playstyle with him. It melts people as long as youre in the same room.
---
Beautiful
---
Same thing happened to me a few days ago
---
Lol you hit his nose not head
---
shield meleeing in defence would be way too op tho, u could just camp next to an important door
---
I'm so glad they haven't added (and hope they never do) emotes in Siege. 
---
I know they'd probably make a lot of money but I personally hate that crap.
---
But you were not killed by Doc, it was Warden who killed you from behind.
---
Step1, have potato aim
---
Step2, get domed
---
Step3, complain on the internet
---
Step4, ???
---
Step5, profit
---
Not headshot lol
---
I see,  I haven’t played the game in a while so I guess the new recoil kind of just shook me
---
That's amazing

Twitch has already been nerfed a tonne, she used to have infinite shocks on her drone but still with a cooldown. I still dont think she needs to be nerfed too much

#WELCOME TO THE RAINBOW
---
The stick looks kinda odd, as if it has been partially cut off, its fake
---
The p9 has good damage, does it have bad penetration?
---
Just add some natural sway so we dont look like robots when holding a doorway and have our gun bounce up and down with each step.
---
This will also give the walk function an actual use. Half the people I play with dont even know it exists.
---
You get used to it overtime, it sucks but then again so does everyone else so it balances.
---
Maybe its because of pengu and maciejay saying that they should remove one shot headshot
---
You can't get black ice on blackbeard

Headshots no matter what are a instakill I've tried the over heal before it doesn't matter

---
I know this now. I just figured it was another one of those ultimately dumb questions.
---
I dont remember exactly what is but I do remember hearing in an episode of the hotbreach podcast that the p9 cant 1 shot headshot under very specific conditions.
---
cause its copper
---
Noobody is forcing you to do it, if you dont want to, or if you would rather change up the rules for yourself go ahead, it's all about getting some exercise in to your gaming sessions
---
Maybe because you missed most your shots
---
Lesion is very strong currently so he is a good pick
---
There’s far less damaging weapons, p9 does 45? P90, scorpion, mp5, vector, etc
---
I want Nøkk and Vigil to have babies and it be wholesome af. Like mini vigil and Nøkk running around and here rings Aunty Caviera.
---
Ella’s scorpion isn’t bad at all, a vertical grip and muzzle break are all you need and decent recoil control and it’s easily one of the best defending SMGs
---
No developer with half a brain would ever ever release a game and publicly say something so ambitious. Especially something like siege where this kind of shooter didn’t really exist before.
---
Wtf. This is the sort of thing that I dream of achieving, hats off to you sir!
---
Just shroud things
---
Insaaaaaane
---
We just recently hit silver 3 so yeah basically it is
---
Lesion, incredibly high rate of fire with still practically no recoil, a pretty decent pistol, a nuisance gadget that I like to use as a radar, and coupled with frosts mats to finish somone. Vigil is also pretty good, a great gun, decent secondaries, and 3 speed.
---
Exactly.
---
Whoops I meant to say “That’s not a *bad* way to go about it”, meaning I think it’s a decent idea. He needs a tweak.
---
Don't know why you got downvoted. It's true, the MPX is amazing. You just have to actually be able to aim.
---
Jager for the carbine but lesion for the rest of the loadout

just kill zofia and doc smh

Its not even trashing controllers, theyre better for things like fighting games, platformers, some rpg games (if the UI is laid out for controller, like dark souls for example) but in that same vein mnk is just outright better for fps games. 
---
I dont understand why console players get so mad when you tell them that (not you but ive just gotten tons of "hurr durr pc masterrace" bs. I have nothing against people who play on console, just staing facts

Back muscles and biceps might be a bit under trained with this routine, chuck in some pull ups / bent over rows if anyone gets team killed

Just buy whoever pleases you the most! It's cosmetics that you pay 20 odd dollars for that you can never see when in-game! It's all about your personal feel.

Mine is Monty but they kind of ruined shields with the nerf so probably Dokkeabi.
---
Warden is fine as he is, he has a high RoF accurate gun that does an average dps why does he need a buff to his gun?
---
thankgodifinallyfoundmysoulmate.m4a

Such an awful skin. Can’t believe they are releasing it.

(I will comment this on every single Smoke Elite post until I die)
---
You gonna get it SBR'd?
---
Yeah, I do. Your furthering the toxicity in this community by trying to insult a person who posted a nice clip.
---
The guy is very nice, and he meant no ill intent. Your trying to put him down because you don't view it as a skilled play.
---
It was a good enough play to get my attention, I've been distancing myself from the siege community, and rarely check the subreddit. But he's managed to grab my attention. 
---
He grabbed yours and well, and you tried to put him down.
---
I may be from another community (For Honor) but I can acknowledge when a fellow human does a cool act, and it should be recognized.
---
And I am willing to take up arms to defend kind people against those like you.
---
Darn it :/ We need fix for that, couse I literaly died countless times to those spikes already... I'm an average player and this issue makes me even more worthless to the team than normaly xD
---
The more ranked matches you play the less wlo you start getting
---
Thats your opinon, I think its awesome
---
The picture is my components list for the PC I play Siege on, and I've got a 144hz 1440p G-Sync monitor so I want to get the best framerate I can out of this thing, but I'm seeing wild variance in framerates. Sometimes it's up at 150+ and others it drops down to 40-50 fps while in a game. The drops are really noticeable and suck when you're in a firefight because it's choppy.   
---
I've tried lowering settings more but that actually seemed to make things worse so I just switched back to recommended settings and enabled an FPS cap in the .ini file. I set a 150fps cap at first but still got a lot of drops/ stuttering so I lowered it to 80 last night. It seems better but not great.   
---
Looking into this I see a lot of mentions of the 100% CPU usage bug which is what my hardware monitor seems to indicate, but at the same time I'm not sure if it's actually my CPU bottlenecking.  
---
How can I diagnose the root of this problem/ how can I fix it? If it IS the CPU bug it seems like the jury is out on whether a new CPU fixes it or not. Any and all info is greatly appreciated.

Hey I made a post about that a while back &lt;3

i really don’t wanna start a witch-hunt, if someone ask, i’ll tell them

indeed
---
Because he is a 3 armor with a mediocre gun without acog. The mpx is great on valkyrie because not only does she have the mobility, she has the Intel to be able to prefire. The playstyle with 3 armors is to take long distance fights or pixel peaks. Warden's fits neither. He is like a tachanka now.
---
Except cavs will affect her run slightly, is this true with nokk or not?
---
I want more maps in ranked as well so reworking maps is the best solution to have that. I’m excited for Kanal to come next season as that map (besides Favela) has been the bane of my existence in Casual and would love it to redeem it self.
---
Not with buck
---
yes
---
The thing is that they dont even ask me to. When i press ranked, it automaticly searches for a new match :/

Are you on console?
---
Well they aren’t anymore
---
The toothpick was stuck in his teeth, he was trying to get it out.
---
Never
---
Nah man this isn’t normal console, this is copper V right here, the second to last guy didn’t even shoot
---
See again your doing it again.
---
Hard pass
---
He would get dumped on in R6. Because R6 has an actual pro scene unlike that crap game.
---
Mav cannot be silent because hard breaching of any size or shape is so influential that it cannot be silent. He could make peek holes in reinforcements quieter than you could make punch holes in soft walls, and reinforcements are the defenders' only reliable wall defense, so that's fundamentally broken. Added to that, he was so bugged that you could hear him burning a wall 2 rooms away but not when next to the wall.
---
He was both bugged and broken. Hard breaching, as KixStar once said, has been, and will always be the most influential act an attacker can commit to and Carry out, so doing that whilst the defenders can simply cannot notice is completely broken and against the ways of the game.
---
Lesion, he is useful on any point, slows downs pushes and has a great smg with little recoil.
---
Never what?
---
if that were true no pro player would ever run angled grip
---
You should also realize it's console
---
Favela in ranked .... rather have it taken out of casual
---
yeah on pc aiming is easier but it's like that for everyone else too so you have to practice just as hard
---
Yes sir
---
Who is this guy? What did he do? How the fuck does he have 106 W/L?

sorryforthattho.mmf
---
Hitting servers so he can’t lose :(, nothing good
---
plane has a thing for "losing" those t's into oblivion (or out the rear-left side door), house works fine.
---
But agreed, t-hunts for aim and basic movement practice, a lot of t-hunts! If you run more than just one small map (maybe the ranked pool) you can get more familiar with maps as well at the same time.
---
Work on pre-aim and basic game-sense, knowing all the time what is going on is a huge advantage, give you room to make or change plays safely and effectively.
---
I use no acog cause the recoil on this weapon is redicoulous
---
They don’t need nerfs
---
Maybe people don't care what the most optimal way to play a game is? Also, console games have a larger player base and longevity than their computer counter parts, for the most part.
---
The amount of people who do it for fun blows my mind.
---
They shoot my drone, look at me and THEN DO IT AGAIN! We need to be legally allowed to TK when this happens.
---
Calling you out for your negative actions?
---
I'll gladly call you out for being amoral. And I'll do it all my life.
---
So go ahead, say I'm doing it.
---
Btw, I would ask anyone reading this thread, or you specifically, to report me. I did insult you, and I apologize, but I feel like it should be investigated by the mods, I did something wrong as well and should be punished accordingly.
---
Not to mention his C7E hits like a garbage truck while also having zero recoil, it’s a shame he seems to get instabanned every ranked game these days. I always play him when he isn’t banned.
---
I mean spawn rushes are garbage but you should definitely expect a run out if you have a defuser planted and people watching it outside, there's no other way to win a situation like that.

Exactly the same. I am a lifelong xbox player, very good with a controller but a couple months with keyboard and mouse is so much better.

---
You clearly haven’t seen PC gameplay of siege outside of R6 youtubers mr PS4. As someone who plays on PC, a lot of people miss flicks and some flat out don’t even try to hit them. Sure, it’s possible to easily do flicks but just bc it’s on pc doesn’t mean most people can do them. 
---
And yeah the flick doesn’t make this person good unless they can consecutively hit that shot.

Finka, versatility

First, no, you are wrong. Aiming on controller involves a significant amount of luck, just is what it is. You cant be precise like you can on a mnk (which also takes a degree of luck, just far smaller) this is because of the precision of the tool youre using. This is not something you can argue, it just is how it is, no other way to say it. Idk how you classify "more skill" but in my mind, skillful things have less luck and more ability to dictate the outcome of what youre doing, which is obviously mnk. 
---
Second, im not shitting on anyone, play whatever you want, with whatever you want, i could care less. I just dont understand how anyone can manage using a controller for precision games. Like i said in another comment, controllers are great for platformers, fighting games, racing games etc. But FPS games? Nope. Same with rts games, theres a reason all console rts games fail, because you just cant use a controller to play them. Not knocking anyone or "shitting" on them either, i would ask the same question but in revese to someone playing dark souls and a mnk
---
Third, the only reason youre getting mad is because you know im right but for some reason you want to be adamant about an obviously inferior tool for the job at hand. No idea why you care so much, but there it is
---
Where do you see it?
---
True art
---
I feel like the low damage and high recoil on the smg would balance it out if it had an ACOG.
---
Now that I look at it it’s a neck shot and isn’t a headshot
---
Finka is a phenomenal op...
---
I just feel that it was lazy to give her guns they would never use especially the pistols. There was no reason to not have a USP.
---
As soon as i heard "well okay" I felt a rant coming.
---
Yeah i couldve worded it better
---
Glaz works differently, everything that was broken is probably still broken, or fixed but broken in another way... New things are broken.
---
Its beautiful
---
Ubisoft owes you 600 r6 credits, start the petition lads!

---
There both shit
---
I go Mute whenever I see someone pick Castle. They go together like Thermite and Thatcher.

Not going to happen, plus there are way more options than Jäger to spawnpeek with.
---
Also, an ACOG is not essential to spawnpeek.
---
A lot of new ops
---
Lol fucking nerd
---
Dude talking about 1-2 minute planks like it's just that easy
---
The only problem with that is that then you can always have it for when you're about to be flashed so that no matter what you are always protected against flashes, so i can see why his ability is like that.
---
Ubisoft fixed it. 
---
So yes, it's still possible.
---
How?
---
Because it wouldn't be balanced if she did.

---
no. no one knows why zofia cant revive herself
---
This is the dumbest post ever
---
she has a weaker gun because her ability is so good
---
and broken things
---
and old broken things like silent walk
---
and even older broken things like no ddos protection
---
and even older older broken things like no sound 
---
and even older older older broken things that got to the state that you could call it a feature like ashs hitbox
---
First your horizontal sensitivity is too low and why did you go for the knife when you have the hardest hitting pistol in the game
---
1. No but they can hear you reload and I'm not sure about the in game callouts.
---
2. Ubisoft thought that it would distinguish her and give her some Flair like docs. But like docs it's next to useless and doesn't work often. She's good without it
---
you're gonna get downvoted, because the majority of this sub appears to be console player base, but theres a reason no big spectator eSport uses console as their mainline. People wanna see the highest level of play if they're gonna watch someone else play video games, and console is never the highest level of play

There is definitely something wrong with Fuze and he's bound to get a rework sooner or later, but his gadget is the one that needs rework first, then we can determine what speed is he suitable for, but at this point, I don't believe they will change his speed based on all his uniform, character design since he's so bulky.
---
Please stop bullying shield Fuze mains :(
---
This never worked in pokemon though...
---
That's a fucking work of art
---
How about who's strong on map/sites and if your defending or attacking first
---
Credit?
---
What recoil? She literally has no recoil and the firerate is absurd on that thing. You clearly weren't around on the days of the pocket sniper (smg11 when it had an acog and little to no recoil).
---
That gun had less bullets, slower fire rate and yet it was absolutely op. The only things that kept it from being nerfed up until y1s4 were an unexperienced balancing team and playerbase.
---
Hibana because of her utility and her assault rifle is godly (plus im a weeb) and frost because i find satisfying when people fall into my traps and i love her 9mm smg.
---
i understand what a brace is and looks like. i have one on my pistol AR. but the keyword is "stock". the laws about what braces are and should be and how they are used (whether or not you can shoulder it) is changing all the time. one year it's fine to shoulder, the next year it's illegal. and not that anyone's really looking and going to call you out on shouldering a pistol brace, but if you'd rather not deal with the inane laws, getting it registered as an SBR is the safest. and this will also legally allow you to attach a forward grip.
---
Its not an smg
---
I mean.... Buy skins for whoever you play often.  No point in buying the  glaz elite if you never play glaz etc...
---
Or he was in a custom game with his friends and they let him do that 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Did you guys win?
---
Guys it's not that ubisoft hates us.. this would literally be broken. Especially if recruit is given DLC weapons. Imagine if you would 5 recruits with the FO-12. Or all recruit 3 speeds spawnpeeking with mp5 acog. 5 alda-556s. 5 kaid pistols. 5 f2s.. broken all the way
---
The quality is bad because you used your phone to record it, not because it's on Xbox
---
because the enemies were literally brain dead and had no situational awareness. Go into the rocket league sub, post a clip where the other team is obviously stupid, and tell them that you're smurfing or playing in silver and no one will care anymore
---
That 3rd guy was so clueless
---
this comment though, a gun that shoots 800RPM shoots 13 rounds in 1 second this gunfight was maybe 3 seconds long.... Now to be specific the M249 in this video has a 650RPM fire rate is at about 11 bullets per second. peaks like this just shouldn't be possible when a full auto gun is pelting bullets at the same edge because you should literally be walking into them and melting immediately. But this is siege and not real life, so we have to deal with stupid hitscan bullet registration instead of actual ballistic physics.
---
There all around the circle
---
You played yourself
---
you must be fun at parties
---
1) No they cant
---
2) Best guess: 1 person on each side has the ability to self-revive. Doc on defending, and Zophia on attacking.
---
Yeah, but it's still marvelous this wasn't a kill
---
dude hit a 90 degree flick, instantly, with only 60 fps. Nah this isn't something most PC players do.
---
Clown question
---
Yeah the only thing locked behind a pay wall is cosmetics.
---
That dont do shit too
---
I’m people and i find that offensive
---
Poor guy
---
Steam has a larger player base then both PS4 and Xbox One combined...
---
The server side is shit. You can stick loads onto the server from client side. CLIENT SIDE. It's how they break the servers and it's how most of the hacks work. The problem is that I'm pretty sure they'd have to rebuild massive swathes of the game to fix the issue which is why it's taking so long. 
---
So yes, is it hard to fix, but it's also entirely their fault that it's this bad.
---
Is it real or airsoft?
---
Ubisoft.
---
Fix
---
Pick one.
---
My mains are the ones in my flair and they dont have elites (except for pulse but I already have his elite) so I dont know who to buy
---
Well these are opinions, it doesn’t matter if you consider the clip objectively better. There are more factors than kill count anyways. That’s not the discussion topic to begin with. You were upset that people didn’t like the clip and how they stated their opinions.
---
You can pretend as much as you want that KBM doesn’t have a skill gap or advantage, that just makes you sound crazy.  Yea, it’s not like players on controller could never get a kill against them or anything, that’s not what I said. I said there is a skill gap.
---
Well you got a couple of my responses mixed up into other meanings and you missed the context of a few other comments that aren’t mine. 
---
Also you are taking some phrases too literal. Obviously no one can hear you, but you knew what I meant by that previous phrase.
---
The enemy team can hear your screams as in being shot, but not your voice lines. Zofia's withstand on the other hand, just because, there isnt really a good explanation and i've only been able to do it twice without being instantly blasted by the enemy.

A good Clash player will pivot when her shield is hit to prevent most of the ballistic damage she would take.

Impact nades/explosive poke ball has joined the chat
---
If I went to parties, I'd be inclined to agree.
---
Ahhh feels like home already
---
Ah, what anti cheat software do you guys use? I could probably google it, but I’m sure you could tell me more about it.
---
I'm not home currently but I will do that next time
---
When and why? The CZ is such a good smg
---
I wouldn’t say the gun is too big. But the barrel is just a tad short for me.
---
That Dokkaebi needs to uninstall PRONTO.
---
Basically what OP said. The .308 vector doesn’t exist so your gonna best be is probably to 3D Print it
---
So, when you doing 20 matches you try to carry your team to get a good rank for yourself don’t have to win. 
---
When you get gold 1 like me you play 3 more matches and bam season done got my charm YEYE

youre having a issue with shotgun damage drop off. just play with elas shotgun, the range is a sniper rifle
---
"Farmers" What is this Clash of Clans? It's pretty obvious you don't play the game and you obviously didn't bother checking my R6Tab. Meanwhile you're stuck in Gold 4, never competed in a go4 in your life and think you're the shit lmao.
---
Was the gun aimed at a 45 degree angle?
---
Best I can do is my first born son.
---
Guys, I'm not saying I should be allowed to teamkill all I want. I am asking what the point of the forgive option is, if it doesn't actually forgive your teammate, and simply gets them banned rather than killed by excessive friendly fire.
---
Can anyone here make an argument to justify that?
---
Considering how short rounds are, and the stricter AFK timer - this is such a bad idea.
---
This was like this for the hole first round , a buddy tk me , nothing changed , why ? Just why ?
---
True but I dont need it to be real Real, just something to cosplay as or hang over a fireplace next to Cavs head mounted lol
---
Lol let's get a pile going over here
---
You wouldn't happen to know anybody who can 3D print something like that?
---
What is this console supremacy
---
Notice the *after every game*, not between rounds
---
I was 300 lbs starting now the anorexia is setting in.
---
strange, do you play on console? I havent had that lobby issue on PC in years
---
Had that happen. Also on ps4, but I was cav and they quit before I could finish them/interrogate them.
---
All of this in casual :')
---
I had a stroke reading your title.
---
There are companies that do custom highly detailed 3D  Printing items for you. I don’t know it of the the top of my head but a quick google search could do it.
---
It looks really cool. Wish I could have one
---
you have to restart your game.
---
u/Danielsaaaan
---
Favelas is in Rio De Janeiro
---
Hip fire should be worse like most shield ops.
---
They really should give Mira an elite honestly
---
you have to restart to reconnect to your original game.
---
welcome to copper btw
---
Did you miss the "Flash" part?
---
Cool keep me posted
---
Youre right about that, nothing good has come out in ages.
---
Jäger acog would be nice
---
I'm sure itll depend on the state.  Not to get too political, but I'm sure it's easier in right winged states.  I can only speak for TN, but I have never had issues buying pistols or ARs, but just got declined for a full auto FNH I wanted to buy.
---
Best to just so some research and find if your state has any limitations.  I would lean towards saying you're safe, as the ATF application only asks if you've taken illegal/nonprescription drugs IIRC
---
I think it would be cool if everything in the game worked on friendlies and yourself. Would make people have to play more cautious.
---
2 teammates not connecting or the clash overload?
---
Alright then, the system is in place, I get that I shouldn't be any special snowflake because it was with friends.
---
Rules are rules, I totally understand that no one person should be exempt. That is NOT my argument here. 
---
I am simply stating that the forgive system is flawed. What it inherently does is make it so that if you choose NOT to forgive, friendly fire is reversed back onto you. If you choose TO forgive, they are instead banned for further friendly fire.  
---
How does that make any sense to you?
---
You never played on console?! 
---
PFSSSSHHT
---
It’s pretty obvious you have no skill as you’re defending one of the most broken ops in the game. Clash is probably the only reason you’ll ever be plat lmfao. + imagine bragging about competing in a competition lol. Gets carried into a virtual competition and thinks he’s the shit 🤣
---
... How would I use R6Tracker on console?
---
But as I said. It's Siege being Siege. I mean I was unaffected by the Showdown bug but a lot of other people were getting it. It's honestly just luck of the draw with this bloody game lol
---
Like what should I Google to begin with?
---
It is done
---
Nope.  There is an audible think when Clash’s shield is smacked away, and being flashed would have little effect on this.  In case of doubt, just slowly pivot left for a second or two before turning back the way you were facing.
---
he's trolling, if you watch his streams he's actually nice, it's weird

I got booted for the first time yesterday on r6. Last time I got booted was back on bo2 when people cared about the competitive playlist. Now that I know their strategy, if I get invited by an enemy team I'm joining off a hotspot on my laptop and booting them back.
---
Restart your siege and you’ll have it
---
Maybe level instead of rank?

Literally
---
Calm down and restart the game.

No black ice?

Jackal's nerf isn't something that will be as bad.  I'm a jackal main and the nerf is something I'm psyched about because maybe I can play him in ranked

you're uninstalling this game because you can't get free skins that are gonna be bad anyway? ok

&gt; The SASG has much more recoil, bigger damage dropoff 
---
The SASG does 50 dmg per pellet. At close range compared to the FO 12 or SPAS 15, its doing WAY more damage.
---
lol, one day you’ll run into someone who’s quicker then you
---
This is what Ubisoft has wanted us to do since the start.
---
How? 😂 i go against people my rank which is why i have a 1 kd im not gonna go like 20-5 every game against high plats and diamonds and im not that sad to boost my self to diamond mate like honestly stop tryna chat shit over reddit fucking toxic kid
---
I tried already 90 fov is amazing
---
Okay, that would've been awesome lol

---
Alright, can you hear me out here for a second please? I'm not even trying to say you should agree with me. I just want you to read this with an open mind.  
---
Let me ask you this. If someone intentionally teamkilled you, would you forgive them? Probably not, right?
---
Let's explore that scenario for a second. This person is being toxic, right? You don't want them to continue to be toxic and teamkill, so you chose the "F5 don't forgive" option. 
---
He now has reverse friendly fire. This person now literally can't teamkill anymore. The damage they do to teammates is now reflected onto them.
---
They now, in no way, can get banned. Wait, what? It's true, since they can no longer teamkill at all, they can now no longer receive a ban sentence, as you need to teamkill twice to get banned.
---
So much for the ban preventing toxicity, right? It doesn't even affect those intentional teamkillers.
---
Let me tell you who it does affect. Let's say you were spraying at an enemy, and a teammate walked in front of you. You shot them, but it was an accident, right? So they forgive you. You would probably do the same, right?
---
Now lets say it happens again. Super rare, I get that, but let's say it does happen again. No harm, no foul, it wasn't your fault. So they forgive you again- whoops! You just got banned. It seems them forgiving you did nothing at all, but allow you to get banned.
---
Why should the person you intentionally forgave get banned, while the one you did not forgive is left alone?
---
Does that make any sense to you?
---
(Also, try not to throw the word toxic around so much)
---
Idk I know Xbox has a share option
---
Thanks man. Is this your content?
---
That’s awesome
---
Six makes references to England in her bio so I’m thinking thatcher be her father from a land far over.
---
Really? I play xbox :( so when i play they do stupid stuff like reinforcing between sites but i have to admit if its a 1v1 its so hard to watch as they miss there shots with the smg 11 or smg 12 but in ranked low gold average it seems fine which is why i play it.
---
If you test it let me know bc frankly I don't lvl a smurf up
---
I want Sledge AR-33 though.
---
Yeah, that's what i should have done
---
Jeez, well aren't you a ray of sunshine.
---

Sir, Chuck Yeager was a test pilot in the US. One of the first men to break the speed of sound if my memory serves.
---
Yea but trigger discipline is also a thing, so even if you meant it or not you should have enough trigger discipline to not shoot teammates. If you can’t control that trigger discipline you are making others games worse, intentional or not.
---
Just screenshot it on your phone it takes literally seconds

this got downvoted because it was your opinion, disappointing.

I just don't understand what satisfaction you get from winning by cheating. I am quite competitive when it comes to videogames, but I would never cheat. What is the point of playing if you always win?

True
---
Wait a minute that's illegal.
---
Dude it is scary
---
They actually have assault rifles
---
I picked up Siege in February, played for a bit and then picked it back up two months later and I gotta say this game is too fucking funny.
---
Bruh I’ve been playing since blood orchid and my highest rank is gold 1 I’m not that bad
---
Jackal gets banned, 5 jump squats
---
Oh well you can’t balance for casual unless you want to fuck your game up
---
As far as .45 Subguns, I've always wanted a Kriss Vector. They make a 10mm version now!
---
&gt;Especially something like siege where this kind of shooter didn’t really exist before
---
What kind of shooter? It's an innovative game but it's definitely not wholly original in basically any regard
---
My downstairs neighbours will hate me
---
Is it functional? Obviously it's not fully auto if it is functional
---
Character spam lags the game, the big toxicity ban wave recently was from people abusing it.
---
And what's with the voting to kick the last player alive? Not sure if this is the game for me lol.
---
Wish This was merch, just have a wall of r6s guns with skins
---
Dang over 200 games played, that’s a real grind
---
I think it's a USP.
---
For me I want echos lol. Dude has literally no aesthetics it’s either reskin or a camera on ur face
---
But how did they catch the nøkks on camera?
---
I didn’t kill the hostage though and I haven’t teamkilled anyone else today. Is it a limit that resets weekly or something? I accidentally teamkilled someone in a firefight yesterday but that’s it.

Why are you always posting wrong shit on this subreddit?

Bah. It's just a button press. What matters at the end of the day is how you feel about it.
---
Lesion is elite
---
I know this is random, but how do you say what you main?
---
Uhm wha
---
Does that reset at some point or something? I mean its not like hes always on a winstreak.
---
if you have a hacker on your match, every round start, you have to do 10 sit-ups
---
I lowkey miss hostage from ranked.
---
For all of the imbalances it really gets the blood pumping.
---
RIP. Ubi needs to figure this shit out. This season is hot garbage.
---
Oh I would hit up a mira elite in a heartbeat
---
I also have been hitting doc specifically in the lower head and him not dying
---
it's hard to say really. I do not believe it is.
---
Does it need to specifically in big ass bold letters say "THIS IS WHAT THE CHARM FOR PHANTOM SIGHT LOOKS LIKE, THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER, WE DESIGNED A RANDOM PLACEHOLDER WITH A THEME INSTEAD OF JUST SHOWING THE CHARM DESIGN THAT WE FINISHED IN 2 DAYS IN THE OFFICE"
---
She looks exactly like Ash. We don't need clones everywhere
---
Of which I'm starting to question them. 
---
If not AR, they should have given her slightly bit stronger Defender guns. She's the only non-shield Attacker who gets outgunned by popular Defenders. She has the least fighting chance against Anchors holding angle. 
---
Now she's one of the worst Attacker according to Ubi's own data.
---
The biggest flex in siege MY GOD
---
One time I had that same glass reflect the piano in piano room even though there was no way it could reflect that.
---
This was a struggle to read but I completely agree the system is fucked up. You get punished way more for losing games in a row versus rewarded for winning games in a row. I went from Silver Iv to Copper 1 after losing 5 games in a row, 2 of which from DDoS. I won 5 games in a row tonight , getting MVP in 2 games and second or third in the others, and literally just got back up to Bronze III. Insanity.
---
Ubi could have used more fictional guns or something if they don't have license to use certain brands. 
---
Nokk is one of the most unique Attacker and deserves her own gun so she can be balanced around more easily.
---
That’s the only reason why I’m going for Plat instead of being okay in Gold this Season, the reward charms actually look good for a change.
---
Jäger and Bandit are 3 speed
---
Totally agree with you 😉👍 Thanks for the support! 💪🏻
---
Yea and im a pc plat u fucking retard so nice assumption again. If its headshots for days then go fucking use it and climb to the rank 1 in diamond cause ur so good at the game and never miss a shot right? Ur just a fucking armchair diamond who probably sucks dick at the game and thinks he knows everything about the game so u make statements like o dmrs suck dick because i said so, maybe u just suck dick at the game and my assumption is you do.
---
That's cause they got rid of console pro league smartass.
---
This is like "Unpopular opinion: Sandwiches are good", it is the most agreeable opinion you can possibly make.
---
i know right and my friend who had a bad day went from gold 3 to bronze 1 and that season was barley able to get gold 4 by the end
---
Lmao your fucking flairs
---
OpErAtiOn hEaLTh
---
Umm... what the French toast?
---
You need to chill tfo man. I haven’t played rank for awhile so I didn’t know that it shows the actual physical reward at the beginning of each season. God forbid there is any surprise to it? You fuckin dick.
---
Lesion is an amazing solo queue operator. On PC, even you're a semi decent player with good game sense, you can literally use him to carry yourself out of gold every season.
---
  
---
Valk is also amazing for solo queue. Been maining her since Dust Line, and over time have adopted and adjusted strats for most sites that allow me to just make aggressive solo plays with no risk of dying (unless I potato). Use her to solo carry myself into plat 3-2 every season. From there I'll usually pick up a squad
