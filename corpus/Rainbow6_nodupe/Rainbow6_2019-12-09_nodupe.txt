Sorry to do this, but the left engine should’ve gone out, not the right one unless she somehow overpenetrated and missed the left engine and hit the other side
---
---
---
Exactly. Idgaf what ubi's reasoning is, but it was so much better when it was atk -&gt; def -&gt; atk -&gt; def and vice versa
---
Oh. I read as "her the rapist... "
---
rip
---
But fraggers are essential for the game. Wanting to get kills isnt a bad thing, teams need players who can get kills to succeed.
---
Yes and the fmg 9 has the same stats as the mp5sd, it used to have the same stats as mp5 aswel until they nerfed that

You seen arrested development?

I think it’s glitches/they accidentally gave the notification early

Really? The Saran Wrap only does so much. Anything with a decent rate of fire will shred it, and the head of the poor BB.
---
Don’t see the problem, everything is in order
---
who needs serious reworks?
---
Blackbeard. No one ever goes for the head of I run him, and my shots are all deflected off the shield when I shoot him. Also Bandit and Ash. Idk how to properly use Bandit, and Ash is just too sweaty
---
Nice prank
---
And ops designed for it,  fair enough. Cav, vigil, Glaz this season etc are fraggers totally designed around kills. 
---
Twitch, doc, rook, ash and other 3 speeds offer great utility and shouldn’t be used that way. The only op that should be or have 3 speed properties are Cav and maybe Nokk. That’s it. 
---
The game is better when they’re not played and designed that way. Ash has evolved into a fragger and was never designed to be one. 
---
Weapons shouldn’t dictate you picking them; the utility takes precedence but it doesn’t and that’s wronf
---
Juan himself
---
What did you do?
---
*cough cough* Warden *cough* he wack as shit.
---
I'm also thinking Amaru a little bit, but she is way too much of a wild card so dunno...
---
I agree. I’d rather they spent time working on the ops we actually have to deal with. And honestly there are some objectives that he’s not half bad on. His gun hits crazy hard so all it takes is one overconfident ash peeking to get some use out of it
---
Ahhh, was just waiting for someone to say that hah
---
[deleted]
---
I’m not thinking really a buff, but instead a rework that makes him a little harder. Something that makes him a bit better if your good but also stopping lower level players from getting easy triple kills by just placing one over obj

Thanks for the info

Oh of course not. But it doesn't help. If you take the difficulty of aiming with a controller out of the equation I imagine this game would be very different. If your bullets went exactly where you wanted them, you could just point and click. What a treat that would be. That's not the life for me though. More likely to hit Plat with a regular team and by knowing your role, proper positioning and map knowledge.
---
Agree to dis agree
---
Nah we got it all wrong, mans just wanna see shaiiko and beaulo blow punches smh
---
Anchoring is easier because of how effective 3 speeds or ops with amazing weaponry are at taking a couple of enemies down with them leaving the anchors to pick up the pieces.
---
This game is defender sided and isn’t helped by the fact that 3 speeds can often feel ‘unkillable’ and make no sense balance wise, making the attackers job all that much harder. 
---
You know what would level out the playing field more! Nerfing speed and specific weaponry and buffing utility for said ops. The fundamental elements this game are built around. 
---
I just want a game whereby operators have clear pros and cons, while being built from the ground up to have a kit that suits a specific role perfectly. 
---
Cav is a good example, and vigil sort of is as well however his gadget could be salvaged into something brilliant for this game but it isn’t that at the moment. 
---
We need more ops like Gridlock and Kaid and less like Ash and jäger. They know this as well, hence why we haven’t seen a 3 speed operator in over a year, why the ops recently have been cautiously underpowered for the most part, and why they’re recycling weapons they know aren’t the strongest (Goyo is the only exception to this!)

You're actually getting 800+ fps on the homescreen??
---
False
---
It’s a sniper
---
&gt;what rank will be displayed by my name?
---
Depends on which region you are playing at the time. If you are sliver on asia and plat on the us. You play on asian servers, it will show sliver. 
---
&gt;Furthermore, what charm would I get?
---
The highest rank you got within the season on any region. using the above example, you'll get plat. 
---
&gt; Would I get two if I had two separate ones?
---
No. only one charm and its the highest charm.
---
Why. I mean I did but why
---
I once got two 2% back to back and it was insane.
---
it's an only 13 seconds video, lol, so real
---
Only reason its "Defender sided" is because its a new map and people dont know how to attack it. 
---
The map just got released. give it a season before writing it off.
---
Yeah give it acog
---
Generally, no. I don't spawnpeek. Most of the people I play against also know the common spawnpeeks. Sometimes if I'm memeing I might go for a cheeky spawnpeek with wardens smg12 but given how bad that gun's recoil is I'd say it's a sufficient handicap to make the act of spawnpeeking funny.

this gets suggested about once a month. repeatedly posting it does not make the idea better

You just sound like the usual whiney players of r6 that want random unnecessary changes🤷‍♂️
---
I don’t even play siege I play d2
---
My brain couldn't stop reading carrier pigeon. I was so confused for a minute
---
Ubi didnt release new maps directly to the ranked map pool. 
---
When themepark was originally added into the game, they started using different map pools. The community then spammed pretty much everything from twitter, reddit, ubi forums and youtube asking the devs to add the new map into the ranked map pool.
---
Rosa rosa rosaaa 🎶
---
Game play of r6 but doesnt play it.. okayyy🤦‍♂️😂
---
It's fine to release them into ranked. There are oodles of ways to practice it long before it hits ranked. If you don't know the map it's on you. 
---
It's mildly defender sided atm, but there are plenty of ways to get in the building and plenty of cover to use. Just have to get used to it while the meta strats filter down the food chain there. It's a bit soon to be too worried about it.
---
I find the trick is, wait outside 1 minute... Don't ever rush strait in its way too obvious and expected.
---
Okay

Oh looooolll😂

I have him a 4K spawnpeek with his turret in ranked last month I hope that pleases him for a minute
---
this isn't even rainbow six tho
---
Yeah, that fire rate just isn't forgiving in a game where time to kill is so quick.  Miss a shot and as long as the person peeking you has half decent aim they're probably gonna get you.
---
I haven't played her yet as I don't have the season pass, but I know for a fact that I'll be better with the buffed glaz.  That's not going to stop me as I'm gonna play her just for that satisfying gunplay that you only get with bolt actions, but I know I'm gonna be shit with her.

Yea man, I think I’d be a great addition to the team.

Okay?

Which one is his side job?

first of all right now I dont think you can buy wamai but if you want to wait just think about why you want both and try to decide which you would have more fun on and then pick that

---
How retarded do you have to be to believe that lmao?
---
A bitch move is to be toxic and accuse others of being pussies when they want to uninstall the game with the most toxic community.
---
Wamai can also hurt the team if he doesn’t know how to use him. If he’s on console he has to wait a few days to buy Wamai with renown.
---
You get less renown
---
Ones a god damn killing machine, the other a porn star
---
Very true, but not to the same degree as Goyo, at least in my opinion.

And that’s true even for casual, sorry, „quickplay“ since it’s just more fun

---
What does that mean?
---
Im so sad but I was at work one day and a guy came up to me to buy something and he was literally spot on if there was ever an actor needed for warden he was the fuckin guy I asked him if he knew what rainbow six was and he didn't and then we both went our ways haha
---
I use medal it’s a replay website where you can clip up to a minute in the pst by clicking f8
---
Is a better choice anyways.
---
Any time, and you have a good day too. I don’t think Wamai is available right now, but he will be soon.
---
It's casual , lul
---
True
---
Can’t wait to see team mates using Wamai as a toxic way to kill each other with enemy frags lmao
---
Console I can understand, but on pc it changes the dynamic and lowers the value of an actual skill
---
I understand and agree with most of your arguments, but dmrs are already plenty viable so I just don’t see your point
---
Just send a fucking dm dont spam this garbage on the sub
---
whats daryl doing here
---
My favorite thing is throwing magnets outside and near common peeking spots so if someone tries to throw a nade then they either have to run away and give everyone else intel as to where they are or get killed if it’s a Frag/Capitao bolt.
---
Thanks for your reply.  I'm trying to limit my son's online time so I think I might upgrade a little. He gets pretty obsessed with reaching level after level on Fortnite. While I don't necessarily want to spoil him and spend a lot of money, I want him to enjoy playing with limited time online.

---
What will you playing it on? I can only speak from my experience with console players on how ban happy they are.
---
It's a universal feature in all modes, it has to be a unanimous vote from your entire team, and I wouldn't worry too much. If you're they concerned, find some people to run with, just 1 can make sure you don't get kicked.
---
is that a tachanka?
---
One person stars a vote on a player and if everyone votes yes then the voted player will be kicked. Don’t worry though, even if your new it happens very rarely and even if one person says no you’ll remain on the match. Not to mention there’s a game mode designed for new players so everyone will be new as well so they’d have no reason to kick you. Getting kicked happens like once in a blue moon so again it’s nothing to worry about

---
I know that this is an old post but, goddamn. This just happened to me. However dude just kept shooting me down to 9%.

Now I can’t play for 30 fucking minutes because some ass screwed me and when I got a new match it was the same running one and I decided to bail. Fuck this shit.

Yeah, so? What you gonna do? Call the Spetsnaz on me?

Explain how. Like just create a party and invite my team and then mute them on there? Have to do all that instead of just muting them directly in game?
---
You aren't copper 2 because of teammates

That would just mean if you're losing you leave and cheat the system out of losing your mmr. YOU might not do it, but too many people WOULD. It sucks but its not getting changed and it shouldn't be.
---
I quite literally do get new matches but they are consistently cancer. You are brave to assume I don't do that.
---
Uninstalling a game because the people are toxic is ok. GTAO is mostly about playing with others and they are fairly toxic, too.
---
Nobody is a coward or feeble because they uninstalled due to a consistently toxic/unenjoyable community. That means they don't have stockholm syndrome.
---
Newcomer is full of smurfs NGL
---
Recoil control?

Haha
---
Solution to that would be to take mmr away from people who leave and just not from the people who stayed in game

But I see what u mean

You can't use that word in a game that's rated 15+.

Hey I’ve been playing since day one so leave my strats alone lmao

---
My friends and I actually came up with a pretty good update to this:
---
The less people you have on your team and loose the game. The less mmr you loose
---
The less people the enemy team has and you win, the less mmr you’ll gain 
---
The less people your team has and still won, the more mmr you gain 
---
The less people on the enemy team and you loose, the more mmr you loose
---
i have almost 1000h on steam and i can say it sucks

i was so confused by your title, but i finally figured it out. not bitching or trying to start an argument, the character "Flash" isn't owned or created by Marvel, they belong to DC. that's why i had such a hard time understanding your title. a pretty understandable mistake. your fixed title, for anyone who cares that much: 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
#  Maybe DC can make Ash a woman Flash character.
---
One has highly advanced glasses that he can see through smoke and flashes with and warden has some cool too i guess.
---
Entire mag towards one person, one taps next...theu are complete opisets but its beutiful
---
Great! I hate it!
---
Warden is now ruined for me
---
There is only **one** Marley, game won't allow two.
---
Слава Україні
---
Go back to tumblr pls. No one wants you here.
---
Every game i play doesn't have servers for us so while u do agree with you. its a way bigger problem that needs to be solved by more companies and games. I currently play in eu servers to make it as good as i can still
---
Damn impressive!
---
Hopefully one of those people work with Ubisoft ;)
---
Then you evidently weren’t plat
---
I tried many different options but its still the same shit audio :(
---
They just stand there... MENACINGLY
---
Happened to me too. Came back to Siege after 2 years. All games since then have felt like csgo. No immersion, just shooting.
---
Haha, okay.
---
The guy means well, but he's a content creator for lower ranked and new players, which isn't a knock against him.
---
I just think if you want to have good balance in a game as complex as Siege, you want to listen to Pro players and and content creators that have reached the upper echelons of Siege.
---
Flanked is a great guy from what I hear and I personally would love to talk about Siege with him.
---
Finally. Someone who shares my pain
---
Frost is my favorite operator aswell
---
Yep. The lowering of sensitivity on it increases accuracy absurdly at long range while even at short range it competes very well with 1x’s. Intel is very important in Siege, and IF you know where the enemy is, the ACOG can go toe to toe against 1x’s easily. The ONLY situation where 1x’s consistently outperform ACOG if at close range AND while the ACOG user doesn’t know where the enemy is. Those have to be happening at the same time for a 1x to consistently win. It’s too situational
---
Well firstly, you can just give him blue smokes to clearly identity that it's warden's and not from an attacker. Secondly, it wouldn't be too strong because all you have to do as an attacker is not push while the smoke is up. At best, it's just a time delay tool similar to the operator Smoke.
---
true, flanked is only great for beginners and not good enough for higher ranked players
---
"Press space to enter"
---
But when she shoots, she still used side of her hand to keep it steady.
---
Mute's character concept is, by far, the best
---
Thank you, mate... Happy sieging
---
Well meat wall was not the last one I got but it probably would have.This is because the final two trophies I needed was the ranked ones.
---
The new beaulo my guy
---
Hibana
---
Happy sieging mate
---
I'm not sure if this is the answer, but the red dot sights certainly need some love.
---
The range on her gadget is absolutely tiny, people just need to adapt their gadget placement to it. If you put bandit's batteries on the far parts of a 2 wall and Kali shoots in the middle she won't get either, so you need Intel before you can use her gadget where Thatcher can just simply throw his emp without worrying. Same for Kaid with his range buff, on a lot of hatches it's even impossible to get the Kaid device with Kali (Oregon laundry for example).
---
So as for the gadget, it's a much weaker thatcher that does have the benefit of being able to take out shields and bulletproof cams. If people learn to adapt their gadget placement (and deny drones, this is an area I see people fail personally) she is way less effective than Thatcher. 
---
As for the gun, that's a whole other debate I can't really have with you as I'm on PC and I think it's not really a comparable situation. Speaking from my experience (low plat PC currently), she is very strong sure but the fact that it's very easy to shoot back on PC makes her weak as well. Long ass ads time means she is only really viable from outside in and then has to switch to her sidearm, which while strong isn't anything to fear as a defender
---
Well it is an awesome cinematic.
---
I think you missed the word player. Your sentence should have been this “ I’m an Xbox #player and have all achievements.”
---
Cool
---
Pretty scummy not like the massive mmo rpg raid shadow legends which you guys should download right now
---
Yeah that housing is THICC. You have to keep in mind that if you play with teammates that give you intel and you know the location of enemies more often, the size of the housing starts mattering less because you know where to aim. If you play solo queue with zero communication, a reflex sight will probably save you often. Also, on weapons like the LMG, since I know I’m going to be firing a lot and the enemies will hear me and flank me, I use reflex
---
These bugs have been happening way too often lately...
---
it makes me so angry when they insta leave after u down them. I encountered a dude recently that left instantly on 3 rounds.
---
*inhales* God I love console
---
is meta spawn peek similator tho ?
---
Lel.
---
I am now sad
---
Gj!
---
I see what you did there
---
It would literally be pointless on a 1 speed attacker, especially with his playstyle
---
Yeah but it would increase his meme value by like 20 points
---
Also he has 3 guns already
---
i was 4man squad and we stopped the queue and the same milisecond we found a match so we were in a ranked we couldnt connect to. First day of season Ez lose of elo
---
You don’t need to tell me.
---
This video is great, and the end made me laugh, thank you
---
if i would report the dude to ubi, would it count as griefing?
---
 Could paint fill cuts but it looks good
---
Doubt it’d do much...
---
the dominance....
---
Was thinking of painting it but I’m not sure. I’m also working on one for Nøkk’s icon.
---
Dont worry i use royal, but if i had BI i would use that instead.
---
They just be vibing. Kinda fresh doe ngl
---
Fuck it give it to him. Also give him frags and make him 3 speed too
---
Its an older code but it checks out
---
marley would be fuming
---
That gives a good estimate on skill
---
Impossible
---
Do you not want a sniper on Warden?
---
Gameplay? Yes her LMG hurts.
---
Visually? I DONT KNOW DEAR GOD HELP LIKE 35 FLASHES WENT OFF IN OBJ I CANT SEE IM BLIND OH LORD TACHANKA HELP
---
Noban is the ban phase equivalent of M870 recruit.
---
He wanted to show the headshot by circling the target with bullets firsts,very epic

I clicked this and immediately thought I got rickrolled but this was an actual comment and I am grateful to you sir

I got new headphones too And thanks to honey I got them for the cheapest price!
---
&gt;Once we start gaining only 40 or so MMR we just ditch the game because you're no longer rewarded for winning and you simply stagnate.
---
Just utter nonsense though. If you get to that stage and you cannot continue to climb then that's where you should be and the system is working well.
---
&gt;It's valid but flawed for me
---
A complete contradiction.
---
No
---
I agree but disagree i think it is this way to make sure u can’t get 100 mmr per match to champion
---
Imagine being able to see the full gun before you're dead.
---
Call of War
---
Monty is able to protect himself really well, but Blitz is almost a joke and it's hard to him to shield himself.
---
It's a shit idea
---
I think it’s normal to have an OP that you use better than the others, but it’s still important to know how to use everyone since they all can be useful depending on map, mode and situation
---
Now all we need is the curved barrel and then It would be OP
---
Monty is harder to kill, but Blitz has a way higher chance of actually killing you.
---
He's a bot
---
Your right

But what if they watcher where they stepped?

I love this video!
---
OC? If it is can i have YT link? Want to watch it in full resolution :D
---
You win/lose less because you are supposed to be around the rank you are supposed to be.
---
Monty dies to his own team more often than not
---
If that's watchtower, what's small tower called?
---
I never have played them but they sound fun so yes
---
That's facts
---
Watched a gameplay of it once. Looks like it plays Fate/Grand Order but simpler and without "that" feature Fate is loved for.
---
No. Recruit=throwing
---
Versatility is the best asset, maining ash doesn’t compensate you for being a good player imo. People who do better with ash and know how to play every op is a good player though.
---
How does it play? the first TW game I played was Shogun 2, I tried medieval but just didn't hold me at all.
---
barely anyone plays recruit
---
Nice
---
It's great but awful
---
play the operators depending on the map/area/situation
---
It's kind of annoying when you have randos that don't realise you can just walk her down when you have her alone.
---
My guess is 3rd week of December.
---
While sitting on pewdiepies chair. Hey did u know that its only $399!
---
No please
---
Ubi is scared of recruit’s holy powers
---
Recruit is op in ranked with a 5 stack unfortunatly
---
What’s sad is that I’ve played this and have never seen that pop up
---
No they were horrible
---
You are not supposed to play recruit, he’s only there for players with less than 5 operators
---
Now this puts a smile on my face.
---
You'll never know proper relaxation if you're not wearing an ever comfortable pair of MeUndies underwear!
---
No tears, no tears...
---
Idk, Monument Valley was atleast one decent idea
---
Well yes but actually no
---
What the hell are you even saying
---
Agree with most comments here, be versatile, what does your team need on which map etc. Much more important IMO
---
Just ditch the ads entirely and let the fans do the advertising
---
i.e. beamng drive, CoH?
---
Damn this is good
---
It differs person to person some people would prefer to have several ops that they like and are good at but there are also those who like to play a specific op that they have invested time into and maybe have good skins for
---
If you lose or can't win consistently, I agree you are where you should be. But it's not impossible to improve mid-Season and start winning a bunch. When we get to that stage, we can't climb not because we're getting blasted or outplayed, but because we have to play unrealistically well. You want to climb from Gold 2 to 1 when you win 30 MMR? You're gonna have to win 8 or so games in a row! Hours upon hours to go up a single rank, and not even a high rank but an average one. I'd understand if we were talking about High Plat-Champion but that's not the case here.
---
And by "valid but flawed" I mean it makes sense in many aspects but falls short in others, in this case it's correct in that it keeps players in their bounds when they can't beat the grind, but it's incorrect in that when they beat that grind they don't get the rewards they deserve.
---
Fuck off you cunt just because a person is any more or less rich doesnt justify plagiarism
---
Didnt someone else find this while it was on the TTS I know I did when messing around in a custom game.
---
I only feel bad if I made a lucky kill, but this was a nice planned c4!
---
Yes
---
I see u are a man of culture as well :)
---
new game mode confirmed
---
I dont know how to give feedback as it's never happened to me but I'd say tag the community mods so they can respond to you
---
That’s too big brain lmao
---
Limbshot does not injure/kill unless the victim was already low
---
The reflex is odd though. The point at which the bullet flies towards isn’t the centre of the scope, and having no circular point for aim is confusing to me. I can’t use a vertex has my basis for aim personally. 
---
Nothing wrong with the smol things in life 👀
---
Vigil the suicide bomber.
---
Brilliant, was under the impression it was always a one hit DBNO. 
---
Assuming her arm is in front of her chest, it’ll penetrate and still do full damage?
---
Lol, but people love to drop logic for baseless emotion.
---
Yeah, OC
---
Rise of Kingdoms had lots of false advertising too though
---
Arm counts as bodyshot doesn't it? Only legs have dmg reduction as far as I know
---
Hopefully you’re not like me, I saved 10 and got black ice for the p9
---
Well...still a shitty thing to do but at least they actually remade it rather than just stealing it (what a fucking low bar mobile companies have set...), I lost count of the amount of games that just took gameplay videos from Total War and said “this is our game”
---
Cancel the game search!!!
---
I guess not, I hit her arm and did 60
---
&gt;The reflex is odd though. The point at which the bullet flies towards isn’t the centre of the scope, and having no circular point for aim is confusing to me. I can’t use a vertex has my basis for aim personally. 
---
Yeah took me a while to master it, but thank the stars it isn't the centre, because that would be hella messed up. The triangle tip is perfect for me but that's just me though. Full triangle would have blocked the head.

So that's what the text box does..

me being relatively unfamiliar with this game is why I made this post

“Gears of Halo Theft Auto: 5”
---
Well guess I was wrong
---
Nah you got to throw 2 impacts randomly and kill all of them
---
Theres always a loophole, eh?
---
And they always get rid of the good maps
---
why tho
---
That's not what they said. They've never given confirmation on how long exactly they'll update the game, what they said is that they would like to have at least 100 operators in the game. That doesn't mean they'll just stop updating the game once they reach their milestone.
---
Atleast they made it instead of just stealing it like other mobile games
---
Lovely!!!
---
Yur toxic
---
Have I said they are?
---
Understandable. We've all been there. Whether you have 7 hours or 750, you can learn something new every day.

Yeah one day my Dad said "Play the hardest difficulty and you'll become the best" and it changed my gaming career forever.
---
Oh well I think teamkilling is wrong!
---
&gt;  Some people like having these maps in the game
---
And?
---
&gt;That's why I came up with a system that lets you choose not to play casual maps if you don't want to.
---
Shit maps should be removed
---
Ok, it just seemed like you were being condescending for no reason given I am brand new
---
I agree
---
Tbf most of Money grab free 2 download but pay 2 play usually make very bad oc advertisements so they instead just copy other or entirely stole from other games to cut cost because they rarely plan to keep their game because PLOT (not really) TWIST the game itself wasn’t even oc but and shameless ripoff too
---
Well you're wrong.
---
You don't need to even enter the house to win easily...
---
His is the one where he's behind his barrier with bullets going by.

---
If they want to remove 3 maps from QM that's fine as long as its 3 random maps or if it's a set rotation throughout the year so we don't remove a map more than once.

Changed the shadows to be accurate to zombies is at least one plus for it.

He’s right you are a cunt
---
Not sure about that. Might wanna check out coreRoss's video on that.

Or put in a different playlist that you can enjoy if you want to. It's a win-win.
---
I trust every monty with my life
---
I know you your the shockey one right?

Nah don’t get it save up for something better tbh

I saw...

Your attempt implies that I think they are better.

Operation Phantom sight v2

Thats  tuff

My two most played games of all time in one picture, I like it!
---
I approve of the lordKini one
---
*Drools in spawnpeeker*
---
LMG is good but I’ve been using her for a while and prefer her AR. It has great accuracy and fire rate, but LMG does work as well
---
Alibi would be my choice, depends on your play style though
---
Yea if they mute and Un mute it breaks it
---
That is neither smart nor witty, it was easily predictable and so overused that you look simply stupid saying it. Find original content
---
I got this like yesterday but i can't use weapon really well.
---
Idk I’ve had multiple instances were I’ve been hit by Kali and left with like 20 health, but I always get a down when I use Kali? Maybe the shots where she has hit me and I have not got down are penetration shots but who knows
---
Any game with a thriving competitive community has a casual mode as close as possible to the ranked version just without the numbers. Look at Overwatch vs TF2 as a crude example. Overwatch has exactly the same ruleset for both competitive and ranked, the only difference is the number of rounds. TF2's casual mode is a clusterfuck mess and it's competitive scene is basically a completely different game. Which game has a thriving competitive community? Hmm....
---
What Siege needs is a "fucking about" playlist not for casual to **be** the "fucking about" playlist.
---
I think you should consider if I give a fuck, cause what started as an ironic comment ("What a bitch move") turned into a fuckfest of bullshit cause one guy decided to fuck around for hours on
---
Maybe I felt dirty because it was casual . Or maybe I felt it was dirty because I HATE dying by C4 below me and I did it to someone getting revived 😂😂😂

Goyo or mozzie

There’s no way they’re just updating one game for a decade. This game is going to look quite dated eventually. There will be a Siege 2.
---
how exactly if you can't see or shoot through them? put them on a door near spawn and to a runout at start?
---
you can on console
---
Then stop caring about your rank and just focus on improving your own gameplay. Rank is just a pixelated icon. And play unranked if you really do care
---
Hello 7he_Hidden_Leaf, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e8cno4/can_we_put_an_end_to_this_please/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Not anymore, arms reduce a bit and legs some more than arms, there are 3 categories of penetration now: no pen (if the arm is in front of the head, its not a headshot), parcial pen (only penetrates limbs, so if they are blocking another body part, the shot counts as if it had hit that body part), and full pen (the shot can go through multiple enemies and/or walls)
---
Edit: rogue9 has a video explaining it
---
If you are doing crap on attack now you were probably always crap on attack and just didnt notice. Changing the round order didnt magically make you worse on attack lol.
---
Go to something like r6tab and look up your stats on attack. Its probably pretty similar as it always was.
---
Your not the first to say this but yes, just aim for the head so they don't get downed
---
Don’t just fire her concussions at an enemy, the weapon switch time is very slow and if you do that then you will still get headshot before you can fire. Use it to check if any enemy is around a corner or at a peak spot because it’s detonated just by being near someone, not a time limit. It gives you good intel on their position and can make rushing in a lot easier.
---
What's the issue here?
---
What does recriit have that other ops don’t?
---
Whatever weapon you want to play, just pivk the operator that has it naturally.
---
Do it with valk cams as well! She can be used like that on so many entrances into the buildings. Especially if you have teammates who can sit on cams too
---
*FBI wants to know your location*

It’s not what I’m saying mate

Discord doesn't have a mute button? Genuinely asking cause I could've sworn I saw it before

Eh the Fabian one is better
---
Thank god I got that Jager bundle before hand lol, same with twitch’s Penta set
---
When fid he upload it?
---
There is an unranked playlist for exactly what your describing idiot. Casual should be fun to play and not competitive.
---
Also, your comparing a game that came out recently to a game that came out while I was in high school in terms of community. People don’t play CS: Source anymore either...
---
I switch perspective and it only went 90 degrees instead of 180.

Git gud

Ah ok thank you

It’s just the tree’s shadow lol

Thank you kind stranger
---
2/3 attachments out of those 3 sounds fair. And then make the bipod deploy super fast and on any height surface up to his chest, like tables and stuff. He still retains some level of commitment to use his LMG, but it's fast enough that you're not just wallbanged each game.
---
It was so easy you were almost asking for it though. Just take it on the chin and laugh along instead of being offended.
---
I assumed everyone figured this out on TTS, seemed pretty obvious
---
i call small tower and the tower that was used in the clip big tower.
---
Depends on your play style. I would recommend Alibi. She is a good operator with fine loadout. Pn the other hand, playing Clash could be very entertaining. But again, if you are looking for a competitive operator, I think Alibi is the best fit for me.
---
**D:**
---
I got play this season too after exactly one year of playing
---
holy shit my dude, that is some good editing.
---
This is a ridiculous argument. Montagne can plant a defuser in a corner somewhere and block it from access by defenders while other attackers snipe the oncoming defenders. 
---
Hostage is challenging no matter what side your playing on and so is secure. Certain maps give an advantage to one team or the other, no doubt about that. But bomb gives an advantage to attackers almost every time unless the defenders all have mics and are playing like a pro-league team.
---
I mean I get the immersion thing for some games but this isn’t Skyrim dude, no one is playing for immersion. It’s meant to be a competitive shooter....like CSGO which I mean the guy above says it feels like CSGO yeah I think that’s the point. There’s games meant for immersion typical story RPGs but siege is not a story RPG like it’s meant to be people running around shooting people, immersion has never been a selling point or even a talking point it’s not that type of game
---
It's a new map, new maps are always defender sided when they are first introduced as it takes time for people to properly learn how to play it and attack sites/enter the building.
---
Recently started putting them into razor wire again
---
That was cool as shit. I love that the glaz didn't move either
---
Really? I’ll have to look into it
---
I wish it was 2m. Feels like it has an effective range of 10cm.
---
Finally a good warden buff suggestion. I do think warden is actually pretty good since he was made into a 2/2 with nitrocell but your proposal makes him a bit more useful beyond denying smoke and flashes.
---
He is a great spawn peeker
---
I know, and I played at a high plat/diamond level/champion level from y1s1 right up until last season when I stopped playing. I figured with those numbers I’d see more people than the same ones for literally years. It’s kind of cool because you make lots of friends and enemies lol.
---
Id say I crouch the "normal" amount. I just find it more comfy to map crouch to space. Thats one of the great things about PC.
---
I’d recommend just taking a break and switching to another game for a little. I took a 3 month break from Siege when I wasn’t enjoying the game and came back. The game has been much more enjoyable since than.
---
And caveira = spy even though i know spy is a dude

Time to take off my gas mask

There's no difference really just different controller, probably less toxicity since xbox bans slightly bad words. Other than that I can't see a difference.
---
Can you mute text chat? Because my last round we had some kid who refused to stop spamming the n word and “kill the gays”, and his team refused to kick him because he was carrying their whole team.
---
Buck
---
IRL i would think that an impact would go right through it too. Not enough resistance from the curtain to set it off
---
Kaplan is the only really worthwhile Spentsnaz op
---
Oh okay. Tried to find what point bonuses are but it always gave me results about mmr or renown.
---
That's amazing that I didn't notice that either. Thought you were peek moaning. But yeah, that was weird.
---
Russian servers please Papa Ubi!
---
Rook and sledge
---
Fuze
---
If that proved to be a problem make it so that the curtain flaps open for a certain amount of time when you pass through it
---
OK cool thanks man
---
Pretty sure you can, but I'm not sure either because I play console. I imagine if you dug through the options you'd find something, but even then I'm not sure
---
CS:Go would like to have a conversation with you
---
Fast peeking shouldn't have been removed, it lowers the skill ceiling. Fuck dropshotting though.
---
Yes. This would be huge for newer players. Especially when I'm playing with friends getting into the game that don't know where to spawn.
---
Too slow and clusters charges aren’t really that good anymore
---
Should hit up bandit. He never flakes like finka.
---
#:(
---
Slow and steady wins my race my guy
---
Using gay as an insult: tiny brain
---
Thermite has a reliable AR for attack which has reasonable recoil. His gadget (blowing up reinforced walls) is super useful for playing as a team in casual and ranked. He is an Attacker.
---
As for defense, Rook has a solid gun (MP5) which you can put an acog on. His gadget is putting down armour plates for you team, which you can do at the start and forget about, simple right?
---
He is slow but also fun!
---
First off some really basic things are to increase you fov. I'd reccomend anywhere between 80 and 90. Also change drone and gadget deployment to advanced if they arent already. Play a lot of terrorist hunt and find which muzzle attachments work best for you. T hunt helps train your aim as well. Also pengu talks about this a lot but when peeking or holding an angle, peek it from far away. If you are right up next to a door peeking around it the enemy can see your head way before you can because of the way the cameras and POV work now. So my advice is to back a few meters off of a door while peeking or holding.
---
Says the Bandit main lol
---
Games like rocket League have it. You're acting like rebinding controls is unique to PC.
---
I know its a little off-topic, but what's the setting that makes the lights on the pistol iron sights look like that?
---
Castle is fine as he his. Maybe buff the ump a little
---
Can't wait for siege's physics to deal with this one.
---
I actually posted an idea for a very gadget similar to this, but it was an attacker gadget they could use to temporarily block an entry way while guarding a defuser or holding an objective. Basically trying to to take a defensive gadget and figure out how it could be applied by an attacker
---
That Maverick was as awake as my sexual partners after i've drugged them
---
For new players Slow and steady wins the race, they might not be able to control recoil that well and his lmg is perfect for new players
---
Macie Jay's IQ in Siege is scary
---
Of couse your not hacking your playing console...

So bright!!

operation shifting shrooms
---
Oof
---
Fair enough. Though when I started out, I found just fragging on offence with ops like ash and twitch was quite helpful. Then anchoring on defence to get a feel for peak angles and bomb locations on defence
---
Ash and Bandit are pretty good starting ops, as well as sledge and Kapkan.
---
With a finka boost nearly every weapon has none recoil so what’s ur point?
---
Looooong time ago, sights got changed at one point
---
Well that won’t happen
---
I found higher speeds on defense easier for myself because I wasn’t that good at controlling recoil on attack with like ash or iq
---
Wow you must have 10 *mouths*

you gotta do  [https://drops-register.ubi.com](https://drops-register.ubi.com/) before the event i think?

That’s how literally anyone above like gold IV plays lol, he wasn’t spamming anything.  Exploitable “Crouch spamming” was patched out of the game a while ago.
---
Considering the post was Star Wars related it’s not that unexpected.
---
Always happen to me
---
Lol
---
He has a point.
---
There was absolutely, legitimately no reason for you to call him names when he did nothing such to you. Granted things happen over the internet, but that was still your fault. You didn't stick to the tone of the conversation.
---
How do i fix it?
---
So ? still credit the artist
---
It is.
---
wtf bro for real this shit hit me hard
---
All they need to do is allow for his barricades to be electrocuted
---
Honestly I think it’d be a good idea. It’s a weak smg which fits with their ideas for her having the  FMG9, it’s internally suppressed which fits her stealthy gadget and play style, and would allow her an ACOG without having a strong AR that might make her unbalanced. I’ve been a strong advocate for Nook-MP5SD since her release
---
Nice DDoS, why is this funny?
---
Ok. I'll try that out. Thanks!
---
Im all in for 3 armor, new weapon but 4 May be a Bit much, idk
---
I don't know what else now . You must contact ubisoft's support i am afraid
---
I like ROF and low recoil.
---
When i first played i was platinum without having binds for lean and only using the pistols (5k hours in cs) just came back after 4 years of not playing and people are way better but a significant number of people ive come across have 0 clue how to jiggle or properly clear etc. Also the default bindings suck
---
This matched up perfectly with the music im listening to
---

---
and if it's not your picture . Why not use search function to look for the original post ?
---
You can't bind the mouse wheel in r6
---
Why is this actually making me sad
---
4 second casual defuse kek
---
Anyone else notice how there isn’t nearly as many repost on Reddit?
---
Indeed. I don't mind waiting for a few more minutes when I get a game where I don't play with 4 randoms (from which the most don't care about giving call outs or to communicate in any way) against a 4er or 5er stack. It happens way too often.
---
This is so true this is what seige will be in7yrs
---
Who on God's great green earth in the right mind would want to nerf the single most balanced operator ever to be released in siege?
---
Okay but not everyone is a loser who gives a shit lol
---
He is tired of being called a weak operator (he is super useful if played well)
---
No from SA but glad to hear it !
---
I agree with this
---
Can't change your mind when you are completely right.
---
I agree, he’s fine where he is. Yes he’s situation but there most definitely is a time and place for him. I think his pick rate has gone up after Kafe made it to PL. the bakery castle strat is now huge in ranked. Plus he’s  imperative on gym/bed room on club.
---
The Fabian reality is one that I am content with living in.

No, but do you have Call of Warface: Garden Blaster Fort - The 69th instalment?

Thanks for the help anyway! I'll see how that goes

I can try... cancer kills, smurfs don't. I win

But siege copied mobile games first with Clashes Clash of Clans style shouting.

If you call something negative ‘gay’ it implies that you think being gay is bad.
---
Before I knew I was queer I used gay the same way, once I realised I wasn’t straight I stopped. Because using gay as an insult turns it into the butt of the joke, what’s funny about being gay?

*oh no*

 Im Here since Wind Bastion and i have to say that your Points are on Point (heh), i have to say Wind Bastion and burned Horizon were a blast and the game is still fun but  it was better before. I really Hope this gets more Attention because you can count me in.
---
yeah, just shot first, still not how the game is supossed to be played, when ur playing site and 2 of the enemies have 150 ping and one has 20, how are u supossed to know when to peek first?
---
If u wanna have a conversation fine, but if ur just gonna be a sarcastic 15 yr old then the discussion is over

I smell Episode 2: Revenge of the Recruits!!!
---
What about PC servers?
---
Why he kinda cute tho
---
What's the point of this post?
---
This just made me very sad
---
Sound cutting out has always been an issue on console as far as I'm aware. I've had enemies breach a window 20 feet behind me and I don't hear anything until they start shooting.
---
What about when they’re ducked down?
---
"Haha ashton, I got my first gold"
---
Well this is on an R6 subreddit so it doesn't count.
---
Death to the Tsar!
---
I love these comics so much.
---
Found the silver - let me guess you get angry at "Ash mains" (that don't even play Ash anymore) because they have better gunskill? Entry fragging and roaming are valid tactics that have their counters. Should we remove leaning and slow everyone's movement speed by half as well?
---
Fuck up. Ofc it does ye fat fuck
---
They do literally fuck all about mouse and keyboard let alone strike force, scuff or cronus max. Nothing will happen unfortunately.
---
I knew you could use the railing but not just strait up vault onto it
---
1. This would probably be impossible on console.
---
2. This is the counter part for goyo, you have to explode his shields manually. If he could explode all 3 shields remotely and while in safety it would be too op.
---
What Level are u? And rank?
---
This is my wallpaper now.
---
And this is why I should never be trusted to look for things
---
I'm 5'7" and 117lbs.
---
Shut up ye fat fuck
---
I’m talking about the increased range of his gadget, he can now electrify 3 walls with one electroclaw
---
We attract each other Brother
---
That really was sad
---
Sometimes there’s one guy ( normally the last to join) that will bug out the game. Basically the round can’t start until he quit or is kicked.
---
But like if I send them the video is that not proof enough? The kid is literally showing how to set it up and then has gameplay with it
---
And scufs aren’t really an issue pro console gamers use those, but a recoil mod is a big issue
---
Shoulder
---
Haha I'm guessing you've been Rick rolled 1 to many times to fall for it?
---
Why.. why make this? This is fucking depressing
---
Ubi thinks we are testing the game for free.
---
Yeah I find the damage to be underwhelming
---
If you have a NVIDIA GPU try to see if you’re using any game filters
---
Came to ask this too. It’s gotta be 4-500.
---
Ok but he still gets banned at the beginning of every match, so apparently something's not right
---
Oh shit yeah I bought that one too lol
---
RB6: Fortnite
---
Excuse my French, but you are le retardéd
---
That would be dumb, especially if it’s like cs where it takes money into account. People who are plat and higher could trade/ sell their charms.
---
10/10 actually gods at the game
---
The movement at the start of the game made me wanna die
---
Sure it may increase the player base but would it increase the quality of the game?
---
Is it mute or smoke that's supporting his dreams, in the doodle?
---
imagine getting a tachanka up there and reinforcing one of the walls and setting a shield
---
Clutch or kick
---
That terrorist is feeling it in his toes
---
On console, you would push R1 to pull out the gadget, and L2/R2. But I see how it could be too OP. What is a good way of playing Goyo?
---
I wanna buy him a new one now😭
---
It’s a rank game. How is this stuff happening
---
I dont know If Theres Something with the Servers but the Numbers of registered Players jumped from 35 Up to 40mil the Last year
---
I’m trying dad
---
why did they change hibana and mira's voices though? I miss old Mira voice :(
---
Shotguns are the laziest way of killing drones. If you're gonna be lazy at least pay attention to your surroundings.
---
The game is very active, its weird that you had trouble matchmaking. Perhaps is the system trying to calculate your trueskill
---
Camping really is a problem in COD though thanks to how the sound works and the low TTK
---
r/emojipolice I’m going to have to ticket you
---
Maybe a server issue... we have done a ton of terrorist hunts but are currently at 12 minutes for an unranked match and nothing.
---
Place his gadget close to position you want to hold and shoot or use an impact to destroy when someone is pushing you or there’s not much time left. 
---
If you don’t want to do any of this you can put a kapkan behind it and it will explode automatically.
---
Looks like Thatcher and sledge
---
Next episode needs to be the real baby yoda force choking IQ with Recruit in the background ecstatic to meet the real deal
---
I mean I can't give it a baseline if I dont get to play lol
---
I just dunno If I could should buy this, bcuz in the end its a glitch and I dont get shit
---

---
It wouldn't be objectively better - people have preferences. The circle around the dot on the Holo might help some people, for example.
---
then... dont trade with them.  Its supposed to be a nice friendly free trading system
---
Some maps are just god awful for spawnpeeks. What's worse is when they run out and can headshot you without being spotted in time
---
𝓕

Bye Felicia 👋
---
Eh overwatch is worse, but yea I think it's just the beast that is competitive multiplayer brings out the worst in people
---
Lesion over there looking like TheRussianBadger
---
Idk why but this brought a tear to my eye seeing how far we've all come as not just a game, but a tightly woven community
---
50 million players and I’m still waiting an hour for a match
---
Would you take a picture for your character card holding a loaded gun right by your face?
---
Thanks for playing, hope you enjoy CoD more than you did Siege.
---
I meeeaaaannnnnn
---
Im going to go stand in front of a fuze grenade launcher now.
---
I can't tell if it's worse but it sure as hell isn't better. I've practically stopped trying to peek through barricades because changes are I'll just melee the barricade and be left with a hole full of debris that I can't see through but the enemy can.
---
That actually looks great man, good job!
---
Damn, thanks everyone for updating me. Shame to see it end like that. Oh, well.
---
Hahahha loool XDDDDD he so so FUNNY and EPIC and UNIQUE!!11!!!1!!
---
This community gets dumber by the day tbh.
---
i can tell ur like 12 if u think cod is a rewarding experience of leveling up the same way as u do in seige
---
That’d be sicko
---
Post ur rank.
---
Ok
---
Yes. It makes more sense than not
---
Le epic troll post
---
Well simply put. Get a team.
---
Yeah I agree.. but it’s the right direction
---
According to my calculations you would have won before you got the hostage because it says you got him last so yeah.
---
Boners be like
---
If you would have asked me 6 months ago which was better siege or cod, i would have said siege. But i played so much it got very boring and unrewarding.
---
After 10 mins ? Shit, when this happens to me everyone leaves within 5 seconds.
---
Fuze cause boom
---
Ok this one exactly does not exist.
---
But you got Sledge, who has similar shotgun, one more nade and better breaching charge.
---
Or Buck with his under-barrel shotgun, which isn’t bad either, but lower on the ammo.
---
The perfect one is killing all alive things including your whole team
---
No, no i did enjoy siege a lot for a year, longer than any other game but now its just boring.
---
This is the way
---
Just saw a shirt on amazon that said that and I was a pixel peak away from buying it
---
The Nøkk buff we really need.
---
“Sigh” *unzips*
---
He thinks since he’s 45.
---
Honestly I don't think thats the solution to this. Sure it sucks to play against a coordinated team but with how team focused this game is you just kinda have to suck it up and deal with it. Personally I think they should add a small delay before you can lean the other direction to fix the lean spam. Ash already doesn't have a headshot hitbox but with the lean spam its getting ridiculous.
---
f
---
Man I couldn’t agree with you more. I’m a mid/high plat player and I can’t even hop into a game to mess around anymore. The SBMM ruins it. I (and I think you as well) have an easier time in ranked itself cause it’s matching players in my actual skill still. About a week ago I queued a casual and ended up going against a 5 stacks that included the 45th RANKED CHAMP IN NA. WTF UBI
---
Now you need to make a comic of him getting a new one for Christmas.
---
I am going to follow you just in case there is a sequel.
---
After your first couple ranked games after your placements you get like 80 mmr and it starts slowly going down until it goes down to around 20 from my experience
---
Wow Mozzie seems super useful. That’s awesome. Thank you for taking your time and responding. Two more questions and I’ll stop bugging you. 
---
I’ve seen cameras that had a blue light instead of a red light. Does that mean your teammate is looking through it? 
---
I’m pretty sure I’ve seen a frost trap that looked like a bear trap. Am I mistaken? 
---
These answers really help out so again thank you.
---
*someone starts shouting in a foreign language and then you get team killed*
---
Oh Man, that guy is pissed of about this till today, I bet he is
---
Lord please forgive me for what I’m about to do
---
Its honestly fucking ridiculous how Casual has been borked even harder then it usually is. I played against the same three guys for the seven or so matches that I played. And thats with exiting to the menu and waiting for a little bit before queueing again. And these guys are all around the Gold 1 ,Plat 3 area so of course they rotfl stomped me and my team of randos every time. Its just so unfun that I don't even know if I want to play anymore.
---
Splinter cell elite? Tf is that
---
I learned how to play mnk with Minecraft, but custom games should let you do the same thing. It's an environment where there is not threat and you can just do what you want, ie practice movement. 
---
Basically just practice practice practice. You can try T-hunt once you feel comfortable enough with walking and aiming. 
---
Look up Braction on YouTube, you'll thank me later.
---
Alibi
---
It's actually pretty easy. Score and snap, sands, drills, and shapes pretty easy. Glued it together with some BSI super glue.
---
Oh no
