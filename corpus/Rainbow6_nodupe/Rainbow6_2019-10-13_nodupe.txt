I bought the game at release, played a ton of Tachanka back then because I was convinced I could make him work. I then replayed him a lot when they added the shield on the turret. Not so much today, but once in a while on casual. I play almost every ops in the game also, indiscriminately.

I glad to know you're good, is really great to watch how many people like Kapkan, but remember comrade always take care of you and your comrades

Looks like the one shot that hit landed in Monty's chest/shoulder.
---
I'm telling you, the blood splatter is a bigger part of the problem than people realize - it blooms large enough to misrepresent where the shots landed.

There‚Äôs literally a frame of the tip of the reticle on his forehead and blood coming out from it, I know there‚Äôs no audio so it‚Äôs hard to tell when shooting

Which is sad because she does need it. She‚Äôs identical to Castle; totally ok and viable but in PL but still in need of more.
---
The only reason she is strong in PL is the camera interaction. I don‚Äôt really think a better FMG or 3 speed would change that much, or make her over the top, rather just be additive comfort buffs that make her more fun/useable to the average player without stretching her beyond her current power level in PL. 
---
Also, would it be the end of the work if she were tipped into being a STRONGER operator overall? Going from a situational niche pocket strat pick to competing with Zophia/Ash/Sledge/Buck for a pick wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing in the world.
---
I would like Nokk to be more of an iconic staple in general, so elevating her to that caliber of operator, to me, would actually be awesome.
---
If you are good with recoil I recommend ela but personally i say Lesion but mira is ok too
---
Hm, all aren‚Äôt bad choices but I could recommend lesion to you because, all you‚Äôd have to do is place your traps and play really passive, also impacts are a good secondary gadget. Ela shotty is strong on console and basically makes any player good with that, plus the traps are still good in meta. Mira takes map knowledge and placement to use her, not saying you don‚Äôt know anything but she seems most effective to your teammates who would know her better or know the placements.
---
yea im on xbox but idk if its just me but i feel like im not bad at controlling recoil

I believe that pc controls are better dont have to flex on my fellow console players

So the hand shotgun pistol then?

It's like that logic of eating toilet paper so it wipes on the way out. Btw Happy Cake day

it looks like a snow globe

Then maybe try lesion because the recoil isnt that bad and i play on xbox too
---
thanks! im on console so ig that narrows it down to the two (maybe a little towards ela)

What the fuck lol

Oh I didn't thx ‚ù§Ô∏è

It's there for choices, a lot of people just want to play any maps in any mode since they aren't present on unranked / ranked.
---
There is 0 reason to remove casual nor unranked.
---
While seige is a competitive game , which is why people hate others leaving, because it give the other team a majorly disadvantage, it needs a mode for casual players that just want to chill and have fun , plus having only unranked would remove two whole game modes , casual is needed for a more well casual player base

I'm sorry about this but to post I need positive comment karma and I just got reddit so if you could help a r6 homie post on reddit that would be great

His smg takes getting used to, when i first got him i hated him, now hes my go to roamer besides valc
---
What?
---
I suggest not getting nomad, her ability is great but her 2 primary weapons are not that good.
---
Depends on what rank you are
---
But it really do be like that...
---
It has been the best thing they added because I was able to leave the forsaken land known as casual.
---
If they implement the changes you are saying it becomes basically casual with a few tweaks and ruining the playlist.
---
Agreed my friend
---
It do. üò©
---
Bomb only is not ranked setting technically. Although it is a pro setting and 90% of ranked players turn off other modes because the game is truly balanced around it.
---
Ela is your worst choice,  i main her and even i can say she's one of the worst operators  for gameplay. For story she'd be the best though.
---
Yessssss
---
No rank became bomb only during burnt horizon.
---
Yeah, I play on PC too, and it's definitely a superior experience to console.
---
The hot breach podcast did a whole episode on Ubi and they talked about the feedback they are getting on Nokk. Apparently the pro‚Äôs have been saying hold off on any big buff as she is starting to get scrimmed more and more. They lead the charge on this stuff and I bet this will lead to her showing up more in ranked.
---
I'm not saying she is a bad op or you can't do good with her guns, I mean I use and have no problem but the weapons are just not the best and I recommend buying other ops first.
---
That's neat, real good work
---
Like Buck and Gridlock

I got one for the MP5 and my friend tk‚Äôd me because of it

By tryhard I mean playing casual and killing everyone like it's a ProLeague match

OP where did you get it from? Did you buy it or make it?
---
:kappa:
---
Not a head shot. Looked at it frame by frame and you shot just below the neck. The recoil raised the sight up simultaneously up to the upper neck. Looks like a head shot in real time, but you can see the moment that you shot. Got bottom of neck

For me I love playing Bandit. His MP7 is a friggin laser beam and I always have a blast with defenders who have nitro cells.  Plus his gadget helps the team out and if I die after placing them all down it's all good.  Tho I tend to roam and lurk alot on defence so I'll set the room up then bounce.  On a side note I like Mozzie for the same reason but his gadget isn't as useful to the team as bandit's. But that super shorty and Colt commando are no heckin joke either.  So basically on defense I'm trying to help the team as much as I can and get my stuff placed before I die. Defenders who work for this are usually Bandit, Jager, Kapkan, Mute, Rook, Mozzie, Frost, Castel (gross) and lesion.  On attack I like Sledge and buck for hard fast breaching and cheek clappin'. IQ is fun for destroying electronics through soft walls and hunting down Pulse. Fuze is fun too as long as you turn off hostage mode. I think it all comes down to who has the guns you enjoy using and works with your playstyle. For me I noticed when I was trying to play like a competitive pro I wasnt having as much fun it was too serious.  I've found that it's way more fun to just goof around and try new things, just play the game for fun. It sounds like you've got the same mindset going on so maybe those suggestions will help.

---
Maestro is both really fun and can provide a lot of intel and use to his team!
---
Memes aside, how do you guys like Tachanka? I'm part Russian so it's fun to play as all the Russian dudes especially since they're all really good. However, everytime I play Tachanka I find myself just wanting to play Kapkan instead. They're both really similar like rook and doc but whenever I play Tachanka I don't know where to use the turret and wish I could be a 2 speed like Kapkan.
---
Only took me 1,500 alpha pack openings, now time for the rest of them!!
---
Zofia for Seay play, dokaebi for more complicated and sometimes more fun play
---
Then where would the esc key be? the Tilda is usually under the esc key
---
Maestro is fun to play. His cams are annoying to enemies which is fun to play around with. Also he has the only LMG on defense.
---
First one always looked like ben Affleck to me
---
You need an image for that?
---
And for their actual uses too. It would be cool to use Russian scopes on other ops and the default scopes on Russian ops
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt. This is clearly a 60%, where the ESC is defaulted to the tilde spot, since there is not a function row. Depending on the board, it could be a custom layout. But I doubt it‚Äôs anything other than ESC on the main layer. 
---
Usually you would have tilde on a layer instead, along with the F-keys.

I don't know anyone who smurfs for stats. I also don't think you can fix smurfing tbj. Sometimes people just wanna "pwn n00bs". I have 4 alternate accounts for this, when I can't be bothered sweating. 
---
Though it is pretty much ONLY Siege that I smurf in... no other ranked shooter. So might be something there.
---
It's amazing trust me
---
you wanna give me bhop lessons?
---
Completely agree with you. I've prevoiusly posted some suggestions in other thread, might as well add them here.
---
Options to toggle different things in t-hunt:
---
* Types of grenades terrorists use: none, flash, smoke, frag or any combination
---
* Amount of barbed wire: none, low, medium, high
---
* Amount of C4 traps: none, low, medium, high
---
* More varied spawn positions for terrorists
---
* How often terrorists flinch: never, rarely, sometimes, often, always
---
* Player invincibility. Option to enable a counter that tracks how much damage you have taken
---
* Possibility to adjust terrorist‚Äôs accuracy and reaction time: slider + default options such as pro, average, instant etc
---
* Only headshots do damage, adjustable headshot multiplier
---
* Number of terrorists, option for infinite spawns
---
* Terrorists have fixed or random operator skins
---
* Defenders available in all modes
---
* Infinite ammo, clip size and gadgets
---
* Number of bombers: none, low, medium, high, only bombers
---
* Ability to change operator and loadout on the fly (maybe require you to spawn again)
---
* Adjust terrorist‚Äôs behaviour on the fly: stay still, peek angels, move towards you, sprint, etc.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 And some PvE focused suggestions:
---
* Different classes of terrorists, each with different skins:
---
   * Fast  flankers with SMGs. These are the guys that are more likely to come  investigate noises and try to flank you when you‚Äôre engaged with  multiple enemies
---
   * Sniper with Glaz‚Äôs or Kaid‚Äôs gun. They prefer to set up in long hallways and open spaces
---
   * Regular troops with shotguns, LMGs and assault rifles
---
* Some groups set up and hold rooms while others patrol the map
---
* Terrorists use operator gadgets: batteries, lifeline, crossbow, Mira window, Castle barricades etc.
---
* One time use first aid kits next to ammo boxes
---
You became neo
---
Idk exactly but that‚Äôs the season where cartman and Heidi are in a relation-ship
---
Some guy just decided to go full copper on you
---
What attacking ops?
---
what is the key combination?
---
When you're tabbed out the natural reaction is to left click to resume playing. As you can guess left click is to shoot ü§£
---
The cevlar waist crotch guard thing. Just search that or something
---
Pretty sure his current detection lasts almost twice as long as cav interrogation, but you do next to none of the amount of work or risk taking to get. And it‚Äôs consistently re-scanable. The other comparable ops are Lion, Dokkabi, and Alibi. Lion lasts approx 4 seconds, Dok is 7 or so, and Alibi is approx the same. 
---
It is very over powered. The nerf isn‚Äôt even really a nerf. It‚Äôs a redesign and rework to rebalance him closer to where he should have been. It‚Äôs like how Blackbeard had a shield with 900HP, nine times the health of an OP, to the point that all the player had to do was equip the shield and leave it on the whole game and have zero movement penalty and the risk of them dying was slim. He got reworked and is perfectly balanced now and so many people played him because he was op and then griped when he became balanced.
---
Exactly. Someone gets it.
---
This is not funny. This joke has not been funny for a very long time, if it ever even was in the first place. It‚Äôs just became a way for people to get karma for no effort by making people think this is some obscure inside joke.

Fuse would be c4. But see a hammer isn't subtle but an emo grenade could be so..... Thatcher isn't exactly a hammer.
---
can you not read I said she's important but overrated
---
She‚Äôs only constantly banned in lower ranks
---
bruh why are you grovelling over a skin
---
One little qusteion, how can you get this recruit main icon?
---
It's a boy called Kenny
---
She is only banned in lower ranked games. Cav is an easy counter it all depends on how good you are at checking your surroundings, how good your aim is, and how good your movement is. Her pistol has already been nerfed before as it used to do 99 damage with little to no drop off if I remember correctly so she could literally randomly shoot corners and make everyone one shot. Just learn how to counter cav and she won‚Äôt be an issue.
---
I always thought that the hammer and scalpel thing would have sledge watching it being sad thinking "I thought I was the hammer"
---
Well I‚Äôve never been in copper so I‚Äôll just have to take your word for it. Lol.
---
Just keep a drone watching your flank and your headset volume high and you are all good.
---
Old proleague skins never come back
---
Then how does the situation where both kill each other happen?
---
The second alpha pack I ever opened, was black ice for glaz. (it's still my only black ice)
---
Yes, when you purchased it you just needed to add it to your uplay account. It's not limited to console and all cosmetics sold and are available across all platforms.
---
She was there on your screen. It looked as if she timed and aimed her shots head level so she prefired your head mid lean milliseconds before you can see her.
---
That‚Äôs because your on console the whole game is copper 5 on console.

We ban them most of the time which is about 40%, we make an effort to just ban whoever. We most of the time just pick at random. But if no one picks Lesion is gone just cause he is annoying. But we ban kapkan to blitz, sledge to hibana. No one is safe.
---
Yep, so was I. The solution is ranked, then you only play against people as skilled as you.
---
Also no headphones in a game where knowing where the enemy is coming from is your biggest advantageüòÖ.

That‚Äôs a renown farmer
---
I should get Vigil or Maestro. They both have amazing guns and impact grenades. Maestro is an anchor but his camera's are very good. Vigil is a good roamer who cannot be detected by drones. These 2 are basically my main defenders.
---
so hibana but in better? A rocket launcher is an OP idea for this game. Doesn¬¥t matter if it is only hard breach or does boatloads of damage too (which it probably would).
---
Vigil is really good. You just need to use his gadget the right way.
---
OK why are the key prints on the side of the key caps as opposed to he top?
---
What did u make it on
---
Vigil is good for roaming, mastro has good anchor ability with his cam, lion is good for his ability and so is finka alibi is more if you enjoy roaming in my opinion and her ability is known by most now. 
---
I would recommend ela her ability is good for alerting where people are coming from and helping with get the kill.
---
and a fifth version is a missfire to balance it out

Very nice, would love to see some other elites too!

Thanks and no! :) I love it! Elite skin for Kapkan disappointing me much
---
Have you really though? This camo doesn't work in many situations, I personally have never seen it in ranked this season.
---
LOL ikr
---
Honestly, I've been post processing using reshade to avoid this bullshit. If you can afford to drop 20fps it makes the game not look like shit, and using the lumasharpen and clarity options you can make the characters playermodels more contrasted against their surroundings. It's Battleye approved.
---

r/rainbow6 has a tendency to beat already dead and unfunny jokes into the ground to the point where it's just cringy

Well if I‚Äôm on console then it‚Äôs Zofia Maverick and  Jackal(though i wanna switch one out for Ash), and Bandit Doc and Valkyrie 
---
On PC I‚Äôll usually go with Ash or sledge, and Bandit or Pulse and probably Alibi once I get her

Thats literally the point of camoflauge. For a community who cried about realism and got mad about the wrong ammo being on an op, you guys sure hate it when something realistic is a disadvantage for you.

Idk what to believe because epi recently stated that they are looking at giving 2 speed, 2 armor defenders access to an ACOG on semi auto weapons

This doesn't look legit.

Atleast in my country no-one gets arrested only fined and even then its the parents

A true rollercoaster of emotions

Wait, you didnt get to plant, how did you win? The new rules said Def should've won lol
---
I prefer playing without them
---
i often go 0k 1a and never say ez, even if i (rarely) carry. always just a simple gg, win or loss. its just them being toxic, or like the crab riding the albino crocodile
---
happy cakeday

Happy Cake Day and RIP House :(
---
A military shooter without camo. Might as well play fortnite. Man, you would have hated MW/MW2 with Ghost, Cold Blooded, and a sniper rifle on Wastes (or really any map).
---
You can always skip forward to when Giants are on attack and have a Nokk in their lineup. Takes like 30 seconds to click through the video to find the rounds she was in.
---
Alibi is the one. Her clones are a lot of fun. Switching with them after the enemy shot them is just plenty of fun
---
Restart and it should be ok
---
Do u ride a mechanical bull often?

The PS4 or the game?
---
I know that but pro league gameplay is always good to watch and I haven't seen any in a while, so thought I might as well. Was a really good game!
---
N√∏kk
---
I can only speak from my own experience, and I see at least one or two people per game wearing them. There's still plenty of issues with the game (boosting is gone, but matches can still be horribly mismatched. I'm high plat 3 and went against king George last night and he is champion 36, as well as 3 other diamonds in his group, how is that fair? Maps that shouldn't be in ranked still are. The game still randomly crashes like it did at the beginning of the season, sound is fucked, ect) and I can't even imagine what it is like for comp teams looking for scrims right now.
---
Just because they are a small issue that flies under the radar for some people doesn't mean ubi should let it stay that way. These skins are really good, almost as much as the twitch and valk elites were when they were released.
---
Maybe is the economic version
---
To bad it's the censored version of the ops

Yep...  It's hard to even get across their skulls that no one really plays blitz anymore especially

But when you win against a cheater it‚Äôs literally because the other players are throwing to make the cheater not win. I‚Äôm also sure that almost anyone would take a free win if they were matched up with a cheater.

This is the real question

On mobile hit the three dots in the top right hand side of the sub and go to change flair and from there go to edit flair. You add all your mains by just putting the ops names it‚Äôs 12/10
---
Are you all good or silver, I can‚Äôt tell
---
The beginning was horrible. Im on xbox, and even my casual/unranked games were ddossed. (They added unranked btw, not sure if you were aware.)
---
But now, I havent been ddossed ever since they posted the message. I got up to plat 2, im hoping to get to Plat 1 but it‚Äôs gonna be a uphill climb while its wet and slippery.
---
Meta hasnt changed much but I‚Äôve noticed an increase in shield use.

Amaru‚Äôs useless because of how the barricades break early and you‚Äôre forced to stand still for 2 seconds.

*Moderators do not whitelist for this.*
---
So the defender has a proximity sensor?
---
600H and still dont know mobility...
---
They better keep it, otherwise we have to attack ubis headquarters.
---
All weapons are the same speed, except for pistols, which are slightly faster. Ignore mobility, it doesn't mean anything.

I can see that, obviously you can‚Äôt survive without losing 50 health.

You are playing from the future
---
Yes,I've seen it a lot here as well, idk who the artist is, but if I will know I will edit/post a comment again.
---
This situation is extremely rare, but has happened a couple of times for me. Just gotta make sure that your matchmaking timer doesn't reach 20s otherwise you will be connected to a different ranked match, and still get abandon penalty for the one you left. 
---
Also this works sometimes - connect to a terro hunt solo, and once it starts, just go back to lobby and start ranked again. You may get reconnected back if you are lucky.
---
no u
---
Ubisoft pls make this reality
---
She good
---
Clash is an Olympic runner change my mind
---
Not to mention outdated...
---
A) A High level Ubisoft developer said there will never be a k9 operator since they talked about that 2 years ago.
---
B) Would you really want to shoot 5 people?
---
 It‚Äôs not broken
---
Why what happened to house
---
Hmm, yes. This will make a fine addition to my hentai collection
---
They could make the dog user controlled so it would be more fair. And a k9 unit would be awesome
---
I don't see how is that related to the post? So he might be 13 or 11, heck, I was playing CoD 1 when I was 6 years old, and Max Payne 1 when I was 6 or 7 years old, and guess what? I am still perfectly normal and stable, it hasn't really affected me.
---
It's up to the parents to decide if he can play or not, and if the child behaves and it doesn't affect him in any way, he may continue.
---
For reference, I am 22, but I played many games when I was 13, that were for 18 and older.
---
Weapon draw animations in general would be cool. Only concern would be with attackers getting rushed by defenders and not having their guns. Don't see any reason defenders couldn't get them though.
---
^Hell would even help with the accidental instant spawn kills from accidentally holding down the trigger. (PS: To many spawns line defenders up to head shot teammates)
---
Yo, you have any good twitch hentai I can borrow?
---
Why does that sound like roblox death sound

I thought they took plane out of the rotation
---
You say that like they care.
---
What if ubi just doesn‚Äôt let them play ranked. Then they can still play the game without affecting others too much
---
The problem with Clash is that when you do go up against someone that plays her is they‚Äôre usually gonna be real good at playing her.
---
Might as well have been a 1v5
---
I've been trying to find a match for 30 minutes now. Games broken.
---
I'm just giving examples. It's dump to always ban Jackal or Clash just because you can't deal with them.
---
Yea, ok, lets go back to when Nokk was announced and this whole sub was all "m'realism"
---
This community defends shit under the premise of realism, but throws it out the window when it comes to shit like EMP grenades, xray vision, and nano-machine healing. Something as simple as fucking CAMO, in a goddamn shooter; cause ya boy there playing on his 720p monitor can't see a moving target 15 feet in front of him; and suddenly everyone is crying cause he's not painted up and glowing with a giant sign that says "**HERE I AM!**"  
---
Get the fuck outta here with that weak ass shit. Pussy boy.
---
Why‚Äôd you have to remind me of that :c
---
Kill lion, bang zofia and marry maestro
---
Have you tried restarting your game? Ultimately I suggest reaching out to [Ubisoft Support](https://support.ubi.com/Cases/New) if you have not already.
---
**inhales**
---
 CAPTAIN. CAAAVEEEMAAAAAAAAAAN
---
But in Silver-Gold Elo the Clash player (very rare) are relatively bad.
---
Why ban someone you can deal with
---
Clash is God level if you go against someone who is good with her. She's a volatile operator, not that many people are bad at her, but if someone is, it's really difficult to challenge her.
---
Tbh the days of people using ACOGs are nearly over, they just arent that much better and considering that youll usually be within 10m of someone they are unnecessary now.
---
Even the Pros have switched to holographic or reflex sights
---
i guess, but some of the people were still distracted from killing your teammate
---
That's a big if.
---
yeah that‚Äôs the one
---
Just asked everyone who plays siege, they said sure
---
R4C 100000%
---
Some floors in the game have large beams that can‚Äôt be penetrated by Fuze charges, so the bombs have nowhere to go
---
I'm also getting the same problem. Theres no error code just abandon sanction for a game I cant reconnect to. On xbox1 btw.
---
We are monitoring incoming reports of this issue. To clarify, were you in a group originally when you were queueing? Or did you try to queue with a friend after the error? Do you have a video at all from this issue?
---
EDIT: Could you also clarify how you are stopping the queue? (Restarting the whole game, canceling matchmaking and starting again)
---
This looks like the start of a really bad porno
---
The fuck happened? 
---
Sorry to see homie
---
Lol, imagine criticizing the opinions of top players as a shitter who can hardly stay positive on console. Must suck to suck.
---
Valk and IQ
---
R4C
---
Why ban someone nobody plays?
---
Its cool, but must be updated...
---
What? I just hopped on and found a game immediately
---
Probably from last season
---
umm, if jackal isn‚Äôt banned people will play him. The reason he isn‚Äôt played is because he is always banned
---
Smoke &amp; Sledge
---
Well in hardline you're constantly respawning however in Siege its at most 3-5 times per match.
---
Looks more realistic
---
Jackal isn't that good tho. Tbh I was kinda toxic when I wrote that. Imo Clash is a useless ban.
---
310 hours of playing and you can‚Äôt remember G36C or how to spell Ash? That‚Äôs gonna be a yikes from me
---
Look at this mnk.
---
what are we supposed to do with this
---
Echo
---
Mobility does not correlate to movement speed bonusses.
---
did he have any flashes? frags? smokes? maybe even drones?
---
I know we couldnt skype tonight.
---
Jackal is good, instantly ping a roamer multiple times, use that and a few coordinated players and roaming is no more. Not to mention his C7E is one of the best guns in the game and he gets a secondary shotgun 
---
Also clash gets banned because she‚Äôs a bitch to deal with and just really annoying.
---
I know, you would have to be pretty desperate to agree to play on console
---
You have to finish the mission above 50% health.
---
Out of stock, should have known. Thanks for the link!
---
Bosg acog now
---
A different operator
---
It was from a while back. The actual owner of this account just told me how to upload clips onto reddit.
---
Probably airsoft
---
Standard primaries have no effect on movement speed. Neither do secondary smg's or shotguns. Pistols give you a 5% movement speed bonus. Shields give you a movement speed penalty. Clash is slow as fck because she is a 1-speed and wears a shield (shield penalty is permanent, no matter wether you're holding the shield or have it on the back)
---
0.o
---
Yeah, Jackal is damn good, I'm sorry. Clash is a unnecessary tho imo
---
Hot
---
Controller but thanks
---
More like greatly improved.
---
Are you guys stopping the queue in-game and trying to queue up again? Or actually restarting the whole game?
---
Until the end of time*
---
Like I said before, it's the *new* content that weighs the most. When all you have is essentially a recolor, it can re use assets. When you play with doc as elite doc, it's doc with assets pasted over the original. It weighs barely any more in terms of gigabyte space in comparison to a brand new operator. Skins for guns have nearly no weight, and a gadget skin is the same as a gun skin. Bandits battery literally just has flames on it, that's like 1 extra megabyte at most. 
---
Fully creating a brand new model, new voice lines and running and reload animations takes up tons more space, because it has to "fill" an entirely new box. With an elite skin, it's just "adding" to the box, if you get my drift.
---
I think u should get recruit
---
Then why dont it say 200 renown next to it like in this picture  http://imgur.com/gallery/bpbGuna from my 2nd account?
---
And what do you mean "Just get gud"  you mean its automatically going to fix the glitch if i "get gud"?
---
Pretty much anyone else. Fuze, Thatcher, or Thermite are far more useful.
---
I completely disagree. Pick and ban might not be as good as it is in pro league but that‚Äôs expected. The only real ban I think that is a comfort ban (in high ranks at least) is jackal. Otherwise it‚Äôs mira, echo maestro on defence and monty, hard breach and thatcher on attack. They are very similar bans to pro league and like in pro league there is a select few operators that are banned (because the ops that are banned are very influential).

Yeah, I think Jackal is a frustration ban for most, but Cav and Clash bans are wastes in ~90% of cases.

You're the one calling people 'shitters'. You're not a top player either, considering you're in plat.

---
Indeed
---
Because that's the number 1 way to throw the round after the plant. All you have to do is NOT let them disable by staying alive and guarding defuser but most people get all kill hungry and go hunt the defenders.
---
Was your post title perhaps a twomad reference?
---
I don't think so because it automatically picked sledge during the banning phase and would auto  pick sledge or smoke.
---
salt
---
Yeah I tend to not play ranked much because 
---
1) I suck
---
2)M&amp;K players
---
3)For some reason my matchmaking is incredibly unbalanced when I play alone
---
The past few seasons I've played Ranked enough to get a solid rank and then I've played nothing but casual because my ranks on console are infested with cheaters whether it be MnK, macros or ddosers. For example last season I played the game pretty much every single day, yet only played 17 ranked games and got to Plat2.
---
This season I've changed what I do, I grinded to Plat 2 and then dropped rank on purpose so I don't have to play cheaters. It sucks, but it's the best compromise imo.. I can still grind for my good rank but I don't then have to play nothing but cheaters for the rest of the season afterwards.
---
My capta always told me scielececwas a girls best friend
---

---

---

---
Nah I‚Äôm pretty sure some weapons have very slightly different ads times than others (I‚Äôm obviously talking about minuscule amount of time), it‚Äôs like saying all water tastes exactly the same, it just ain‚Äôt true.
---
It was a bug that was happening to me all night :/ it would take minutes to load into each round
---
Nah thats just Cav being an spy and stealing intel
---
In case I need to do a 100 meter sprint, I know which secondary to use now.
---
I feel like people who play casual just like to troll and TK the time.

&gt; Oh I'm sorry, you want your shooter to be "fair"

Yup, that's how an eSports shooter works. The game playing for you isn't a "tactical advantage", you shitter.

No they don‚Äôt. About a year ago they standardized all ads times

---
Same here.
---
Alright, then it was just my impression
---
I also play overwatch. I never play Ash and I enjoy Ashe. it‚Äôs not difficult to remember i promise
---
I get that. Playing on PC, I don‚Äôt encounter cheaters that often. They‚Äôre definitely there but doesn‚Äôt seem to happen a lot, not enough to notice I should say. I really couldn‚Äôt imagine playing this on console.

---
Isn't it the same in CS:GO?.. Changing it doesn't make sense realistic wise...
---
This is beautiful, Vigil would be beautiful drawn with this style as well.
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Nothing wrong with this. I love it
---
Using camo to conceal yourself is suddenly "the game playing for you". You're a fucking idiot.
---
This game is a broken piece of jank shit too. All I ever see on this sub is how fucking broken shit is all the time.
---
Except we have direct messaging which is even worse because it‚Äôs specifically towards you that they‚Äôre sending bm.
---
Yeah but cus it's on a slated surface at some point It tilts up and down
---
This game isn't friendly for kids. Hypothetically it'd get a huge influx but I think they'd leave after a short while of getting killed constantly
---
The game is solo unfriendly, so why play modes that are designed (more) for stacks?
---
Nah that's just ice

My favorite aces are with the bosg lol and took shooty.

Acog and inherent suppression would be the only difference between the guns, FMG-9 and MP5SD have identical stats across the board.
---
If they wanted to avoid an Acog and stay in the SMG space MP5K and MP7 are also options, though their fire rate would be a significant step up from the FMG-9.

Not OP
---
Want to know what else is a bruh moment accidentally getting a double kill and not clipping it but putting it on mixer 
---
The double kill pretty much was a guy behind the door with another behind i peeked round and two shots were needed one was a head shot another was a body but killed him as he was low af
---
The FMG-9 shows almost no benefit to her play style, at least imo. It‚Äôs just there to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù her, even though she‚Äôs not even that OP. She should get J√§ger‚Äôs rifle but suppressed or the MP5SD
---
*But uses pistol as a secondary rather than the Super Shorty shotgun
---
But other than that, great C4 and spray. You make a fellow Mozzie main proud.

Staring at the ceiling at 2:30 in my pitch black room: ‚Äúif I aimed higher I could‚Äôve killed thermite‚Äù

&gt;Soz fam but this is making this game play out like a CoD-style twitch shooter with some Rainbow Six elements in it.
---
No, it's making it play like Rainbow Six Siege. People leaning isn't new, it's been in Siege since the start, so people leaning in fights can't make it "not" feel like Siege. If you don't like the way the game plays, you're free to admit that it's not for you, though.

Enjoy your day :)

Too long without my House and Favela

Universal outbreak one

Oceans tooth(I‚Äôm fairly sure that‚Äôs the Y4S1 shark skin) and R6 Invitational are my personal favorites.

Those gloves are way too big for that man's build.
---
Just a scenario your echo 40 hp after spawn peeking with a gun that shoots peas after 20m or could be doc with a really good gun which doesn't shoot peas after 20m with 80hp and 1 less stim. Which one would you chose?
---
It kinda bugs me that the wood is not breaking in a gamey way. I have played this game way to long. It's the camerathing all over again.
---
I can tell from this comment you live a boring life /s
---
do you not read patch notes?
---
Whip nae nae
---
Mainly because he's more valuable than the other two, especially rook
---
Not allowed, but they aren't going to look into it far enough to be able to stop you. After all, you are paying them again to play. Have a blast, go at it.
---
Likely a case of the very elusive headshot-down.
---
Mathematically, based on how the game is designed to work, it's not supposed to be possible to headshot-down someone - Headshots deal something crazy like x50 damage, and in order to be downed a player needs to have between -25 and 0 health (Basically, they can't get "overkilled" by the shot that puts them below 1 HP by too much). There should be no case where a headshot can do this.
---
However, in certain rare cases, it still happens. In the cases I've seen, it usually involves the shot penetrating a surface of some sort (which reduces it's damage by a percentage), so it's likely something to do with damage reducing effects not computing properly.
---
I'm pretty sure this bug has been in the game since launch, but it's so rare that the devs haven't bothered to patch it (or they can't, because they don't have enough hard data to know what even actually causes it).
---
Bro, same. I have the highest grafix on a MacBook air

Hello CallMeMrPsycho, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dhhl66/rainbow_6_open_tournament/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
This breaks my heart
---
you did it, you crazy SOAB you did it
---
Finka
---
they are on the list yes
---
The shotgun so sexy tho
---
At the Japan final. It‚Äôs not a major, just a seasonal final.
---
Where is this from?
---
you forgot one major benefit of IQ
---
It won‚Äôt be a major, it‚Äôs just a seasonal final. It will be there though
---
Not really, no. The 20-something damage a bullet with a suppressor for her silent gameplay is utterly useless in almost any scenario.
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
One of my favourite draw animations is this from [MW3](https://youtu.be/GPIwXu_uGWI)
---
Use his ability when you wanna know where people are. Use the gun wot shoots bullets. You'll be mainlining him in no time
---
Because I wanna just play the game man. I don‚Äôt want the stress of winning, even in unranked. Like sure, I might be platinum, and I‚Äôll get 10 kills in one game, but those are rare days for me. And sometimes I wanna just chill and play operators like Tachanka, or use meme guns like certain DMRs and the BOSG.
---
I honestly still laugh about the fact they gave Oper9‚Äôrs fookin Taurus‚Äôs. 
---
One of the least effective and reliable weapon companies comparative to Springfield  and Hi-point.
---
Yeah my bad, I forgot to mention, the other teammates also chose that option too.

Well, machine pistols are 180 ms  of delay till fully ads, 0.18 sec, vs the pistol which is 0.1 or 100 ms.
---
So its a 0.08 seconds of difference, so idk if it's worth it still.
---
 
---
Of course if it's an smg and not a machine pistol, then its 200 ms or 0.2 seconds, so here we see a 0.1 seconds difference, so still a real small difference yo pick a pistol over a full auto gun.
---
Watch rogue9 video about ads times this season, pretty informative regarding the new ads times, and may make you use vertical on guns you used to use angled grip for faster ads.
---
There's usually no reason to pick a pistol over a machine pistols or a shotgun.
---
Idk then
---
Hey Op, try manually selecting the data center from settings.ini file.

Yeah let‚Äôs hear how you can edit the title man. How do you do it? 
---
You can‚Äôt.
---
Honestly twitch and ash are so much fun to play
---
Power creep
---
A man can hope.

You hate to see it

Castle very much has a place in the meta in a higher level of play rn

But it's unnecessary because the gadget is already good as it is just needs to be used correctly for it it to be effective
---
It depends on how i feel that day but lately I've been maining Fuze
---
That‚Äôs a new one.
---
I remember when Frost just came out her shotty was so good.
---
Gridlock is my main right now. 
---
I would do terribly things to be able to put that SAW scope on any attack gun...
---
Though Amaru has some uses in roam clearing, she seems to be built as a "fun" operator
---
Alright. How?
---
It's a gun in a box
---
Would love to see the video
---
Alibi is much more useful and you probably shouldnt add to the massive amount of toxicity already in the game.
---
Don't main anybody. Even better, don't main lion. Be versatile.
---
But if you do choose it, v308, pop scan when you see somebody on drone or somebody asks for a scan, don't pop just after spawn cause it's useless, save 1 to 2 for post plant, that's it. That's literally a pro tips guide cause he's a low skill high reward op.
---
i swear to god i was gonna link the same thing
---
man shut your lame ass up
---
Yeah I agree that's why I posted this
---
Clash gets banned a lot in ranked, so factor that in. Alibi never gets banned.
---
I like Thatcher a lot on attack and Ela on defense
---
Ah a fellow man/woman/whatever as well
---
Clash is good in a squad, Alibi is better by herself. Clash isn‚Äôt a toxic pick in the slightest, people just don‚Äôt know how to go against her properly and they get annoyed by it.
---
Did I say I was
---
Ump and p90 are worse. Have you even seen the p90's stats? It's pathetic.
---
You do know that the fmg has the exact same stats as the mp5k and mp5sd, and does more damage than the mp5, don't you? If you can kill attackers with the mp5k/sd, then you can kill defenders just fine with the fmg.
---
Damn....
---
Have you been disconnected from a match at all recently? Some players were disconnected from one match, got put into a new ranked match, and then eventually got an abandonment penalty from the first match.
---
I‚Äôll see
