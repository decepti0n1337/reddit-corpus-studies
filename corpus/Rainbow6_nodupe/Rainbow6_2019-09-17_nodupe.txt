Perhaps it was fixed recently.

---
---
Hows theme park bad I really have no problem on that map
---
Dont forget the gu on or near the frost trap to confirm the kill
---
yeahh, but they might not care about it.
---
The strategy is to wait until late season because you can still have a no rank play or diamond boosting with a copper UNTIL they get ranked
---
one frag grenade ...
---
That stinks. I still like to get them.
---
Probably
---
Click on the attack or defense tab and it has all the ops listed and you can unlock them from there
---
id ban skyscraper, tower, hereford, and theme park tbh
---
The uprise in Ela cosplayers is a secret protest of Ela's elite skin because they prove that Ela looks stunning in her default outfit while they made her $15 elite skin as bad as Castle's pickrate.
---
I’ve seen 66000 on PC
---
Ah, ok thanks
---
Was it on PC? Cuz lately we've been crashing for no reason and it's annoying. Ubi should have at least some sort of compensation for this.
---
No it was on Xbox
---
Cool just zoom it in so we can’t see your shitty connection to the server in the top right of the screen.

Zofia feels viable again /s
---
That's what I'm saying. From my experience, the casual MMR (in whatever form it is) doesn't feel like it works properly for players with significant play time. All it does is shelter newer players (which is what newcomer should be for, if they fixed the smurfing).
---
I didn't mention this in my original post, but when casual had random matchmaking, I **never** saw any complaints regarding it, but then when it worked by rank and then had its own MMR introduced, I only see complaints about it. I didn't want to mention this originally since I knew someone would come along and go "Akshually, random is terrible", so here we are haha. For the record though, in my opinion, having skill based matchmaking in casual lobbies is terrible.
---
Now we just need a load of legion mines on there and we’re set
---
Umm when and what is this?
---
I'm just curious why Favela, the giant paper bag, isn't on the ban list
---
Put a pest there and some barbed wire and a nitro cell lol
---
I quit the challemge after about 7 hours of gameplay, and 1 kill I forgot to record.
---
Ubi I beg buff sledge :(
---
What's the floor plan? Carpet, Tile, Hardwood? How many bedrooms? Bathrooms? Square feet? Please, if you call Chaos home, then I'll have to know if it qualifies.
---
Put an Ela mine on the side lesion in front of the shield and then you good
---
I also don’t want to ask for anything because them it seems like I’m lying and just trying to get stuff for free. I just want them to fix issues like this like make it so that if it lag out on the last round you shouldn’t get banned at all
---
LMAO
---
How easy they go down. Even web stressers knock them off.
---
Bro same I just have up, one of my friends said that opening up and cleaning your ps4 helps but I think that’s just for general well being of the ps4
---
Oh. That's sucks but that makes literally no sense. Idk how u left the game but it's stupid that you couldn't reconnect. I mean I get that Ubi wants to crack down on the prob but it's ass.
---
How would this enhance gameplay?
---
Report Goyo for griefing
---
Better to have vote you out then then later in the game, saves you time.  I dont understand the thought process (but I know thats already going too far).  I dont get why its more appealing to go 4 vs. 5.  More than likely a group of 6th grade kids screaming into the mic anyway.
---
I'm Type sol bitch
---
The game ended like 20 seconds after I disconnected
---
One frag later
---
Goyo about to be banned like Clash and IQ just you wait.
---
Mute!! Have you been fooking around with me canisters?!
---
As far as ranked maps go, I really only hate Skyscraper tbh. Since they removed hereford and fortress
---
Neither is Theme Park...
---
Fortress, villa, favela
---
Sebastiano?? That’d be perfect haha

So many Ela cosplayers recently... All of them better looking than her elite, too.
---
Pretty sure even the pump actions can shoot faster than that.
---
Thanks for the advice. I plan on working on it for sure this was just something really rough put together. Never really didn't anything like this but was super addicting to do so we will see where it goes.
---
If 1 match affects your KD your way too early into the game to care so much about KD. 
---
a .8 change is like just got into ranked levels of change off one match.
---
wow that's some intense stuff right there
---
It's literally nothing but a giant fucking paper bag
---
We all do bruh
---
Had to getaway from his porn sub.
---
He still aint banned...
---
I agree w some of your points but I would counter and say she did evolve and her play style did change because the players have to in order to do well w her, for reasons previously stated. And I was sharing tips on how I play because obviously we have two different play styles w her, and I’m the one doing fine where she is. you’re more so focused on stats but she’s still got a pretty decent win delta (Another reason ubi won’t nerf her) and most people would say she’s fine where she is. what do you suggest she goes back to her pre nerf state? They literally have no way to make her better without being op aside from maybe one buff which would be impacts, anything else on top of that and she would be too strong again. And you agreed with me in saying they extended her learning curve which is basically what I told you yet you said you didn’t agree lol and don’t say I have long essays when you give me something like this response. That’s being hypocritical. and duh she’s going to get outgunned THATS WHY THEY NERFED HER. You’re not supposed to win direct gunfights at an ar’s range or a dmr’s range anymore. They made it to where you have to be smart how you play her not just running around the map engaging everyone you see, make them come to you, that’s why I believe she’s a great shallow roamer, that’s why the barbed wire is a nice combo w her grzmots, they have to play your game. You’re wasting their time and until they kill you they can’t be safe planting the defuser. And you’re using her mines wrong idc if you call me a cunt. Who puts them in the middle of the floor and who throws them so high that they don’t work? That sounds more like a you problem then an ela problem, again you gotta be creative w them, I’ve never had anyone in all my 100+ hours w ela spot my mines. I’m not saying I’m the best ela main ever bc obviously I’m not but geeze dude you’re making it sound like she has to 1v5 clutch every round or else she’s useless.
---
The warcrime is the duck charm
---
Ela a snacc.
---
Me: *places trap mine on the doorways* Stand clear of the door way!
---
Some idiot Frost main: *places traps under my trap*
---
Me:...yo wtf, imma get points taken away.
---
I had every single OP so I Just got the 25K renown and spent on the 5 alpha pack and got 5 common XD.
---
True
---
You’re forgetting Ela
---
CHALET 1, Tower 2, skyscraper and Hereford 3
---
Yea no msft always pushed crossplay it's just sony wouldn't until fortnite appears with their don't exclusives deal and boom bam money crossplay
---
uWu
---
Can Maestro's turret activate Goyo's trap?
---
Are the gu’s on the other side?
---
You could also argue ddosing is an FBI problem, but they probably have much more important problems to deal with also.
---
it has never been what my pc has run idk what to do
---
You gotta put an ela mine and an ADS
---
This gon get removed in 3..2..
---
Mehhh half the time I get squaded up with ding dongs. lol plus every game is just a training exercise and the T-Hunts are the real missions fun lil fact for ya
---
No such thing for an Aussie. They’re the Irish of down undah!
---
No way! If you surrender that's an automatic loss, but if you play theres that tiniest almost insignificant chance that you may win. Besides, I like a challenge
---
No I mean in the lore Lion got Doc's coworkers KIA
---
This is the single greatest shitpost I've ever seen in my entire life. I'm dying XD
---
Put a frost trap infront of it and smoke above it.
---
Bud is this 480p?
---
Hahahaha German and polish. I feel terrible for laughing
---
What’s wrong with outback or fortress? And why isn’t skyscraper in there?
---
There’s a gu mine right in the other side
---
I really wish that Warden and Mira's elite skins are a Mom &amp; BBQ Dad combo skin.
---
I’m in NA wbu
---
And np
---
EU, F
---
Yea fuck em
---
I don’t even have to listen to the audio to know they called you g*y/fagg*t/n*gger and then said give me amaru
---
Considering the state jackal is in now the murderers footprints are probably still there
---
I played 300 matches in EU last season
---
Really, why? 😂
---
I played like 100+ matches in EU last season
---
Put a mat down and a gu mine before and after
---
Try and maintain rank in NA and I wanted to play ranked so
---
Meh. Console. Doesn't count.
---
no 2 others also suggested a secondary SMG also, You gotta think though would anyone even use her deagle anymore if you replace her 5.7 USG.
---
I believe ubi gave her a shit loadout so you're forced to use her guns for balance purpose as barely anyone used smokes gun before Nokk released
---
Not that big a deal yet you keep commenting on it lol. Siege community is retarded
---
Wait sledge wasn’t even there
---
Smash it with a hammer
---
Yeah that makes sense. Hiw bad was the ping like?
---
Good ideas!
---
Noob 😎
---
Yeah man I know that. But hey I just think Lion gets so much shit cause he’s the only op that does if by the book/ gets shit done like I’m the black sheep of my family and so is lion in the Rainbow family. It’s like this character was made for me lol
---
Naw, I like it
---
Aim head level
---
Man save the clips after the killcam boys lmao
---
What happened?
---
You guys got kill hungry and Clash fucked you up. 
---
That’s what happened.
---
Shouldn’t thatcher be the dad? However I could see warden as the dad due to that mustache
---
uh uh uh uh uh uh 
---
💀🌀
---
Fair enough. I'm just saying if I were in Doc's position I would be livid for the rest of my days
---
Change your hair a little bit and you'd be a dead ringer for Goyo
---
You okay
---
How do I find good friends tho??
---
No there's drone holes so you can get out
---
Quite.
---
Actually not what happened for once..
---
Uhhhh
---
Yeah, no I understand. I'm still learning new spots and new strats all the time in the game. There's something new to see
---
So true I'll make a call out like far east of blue tunnel and the next dude just goes "uhhh over there"
---
Done.
---
I haven’t experienced any type of Ddos but I hate how ppl are doing this to the game
---
“It’s perfect for holding trash” “that’s the point doc”
---
The game will die on consoles if they can’t do anything. Also, this tells something about gamers too. Every time there’s something you can abuse, a way too many use it.
---
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER
---
I'm just testing a flare.
---
I've got the matching uniform.
---
Holy fuck
---
I think I just nutted
---
That's not potato aim it's good
---
Where did you take this photo at? Place looks cool
---
My exact same thought in the end
---
I was just playing.. seems like a you problem, my friend. Sorry.
---
Eye of Sauron?
---
You had hola health
---
(That's one in Spanish)
---
Ditto bro
---
I haven’t played it since ranked, but you didn’t need new ops to make it hell; it was hell. Hard breachers effortlessly opened up every exterior wall into site and turned it into a killzone. Once the sitting ducks on OBJ were cleared, send one of your players inside to plant/cap while the rest of you cover from multiple angles outside without ever having to step inside the building. Rinse and repeat every attack, no matter where defense went.
---
To have any chance on defense *required* ballsy, dangerous run outs and if the attackers picked safe overwatch positions they were either ready to kill you or could just ignore you while you lost the objective.
---
Is that at Acog on your pistol?
---
Since I only play casual all I have to do is wait for kapkan to put his traps and destroy then where I want to put mine down, just remember to do this outside of his vision so you don't get TK'd
---
Ever heard of a screenshot?
---
Theme park is a good map imo. Chalet is garbage I don’t know why anyone thinks it’s a good map
---
I've never seen lootboxes with so many uncommons in them, I've gotten so many fucking uncommons its crazy, I've gotten 1 legendary so far and like 3 purples
---
1hp and a dream! I shat bricks when she dropped as I switched to reload my secondary
---
Hello VigilThicc, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d5abnp/blackout_crashes/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Lol
---
Just you man i aint no god i play on ps4 and i mean her loadout is good supernova smg-11 is great
---
WHY NO VILLA VILLA SUCKS
---
Are you on console?
---
Over time, her SMG has had a recoil buff, and a damage buff to make it the hammer it is now.
---
Most players below the “serious” ranks want kills more than to win. They wont admit it, and will say that getting kills= winning. Thats not always the case. I am no pro but its hard to play with my friends. They down someone 3 inches away from them and while getting shot at by another guy try to finish the one at their feet.
---
leave then
---
Our gf
---
Forgot a mute jammer, and lesion trap.
---
Quacked
---
PS4 here and we are having the same issues. Absoltley nothing to do with ping because we have full squad around 9 ping. Didn't happen before the new season except for very rare occasions. I killed a guy and the game processing the action crashed me out of the game.
---
Are they Carole and Tuesday?
---
Where’s the Frost Trap?
---
Big rip to all the Lion mains :/
---
I started playing about around Burnt Horizon
---
Any of the three. I find her most effective as a lurker, using her cams to get frags in rooms your close to/in
---
Just you bud
---
And this is why I'm glad to be on console. This would be annoying as fuck to deal with.
---
Very useful gadget and very good gun so yeah she needs a nerf
---
if you add a welcome mat and a mute jammer, it'll be equivilant to, either the maginot line, or the reason the geneva convetion was writen in the first place.
---
be quite
---
I recently learned this and now move my traps, to all frost mains out there, i'm sorry.
---
I only play solo queue so I'm not stressed in any way shape or form
---
I’m actually in gold you failed abortion
---
That sucks
---
You forgot the frost trap and the ela mine
---
Looks like you figured it out
---
You shoulda gotten clapped on the last kill lmfao
---
Sorry about the bad quality btw.
---
Fuckin bikinibodhi. I know that’s him
---
Ubisoft made 1 billion off of seige last year, I think they can afford it
---
your forgetting barbed wire
---
When no one talks theres not teammates to listen to. At least lmk you arent sitting in party chat. Some people arent listening at all
---
Yeah that's why you would usually see a rook player or a smart teammate destroy the armor when some time has passed
---
Frost?
---
I got it too, I'm about to unlock mira (just got the game a month ago) to use it :D
---
What’s so bad about outback and fortress? Both maps seems pretty average to me.
---
You can also grab some armor after you've been downed once, but all you'll get is taking reduced dmg into of going DBNO
---
Frost trap
---
It has a cloaking device installed in it so that when it deploys, it turns nearly invisible.  Aids in the stealth aspect of them and keeps them from getting wrecked right away.
---
Why does zofia cost more than ela?
---
Apuntate comprarle el uniforme de cedro intenso en el futuro, le queda genial con eso.
---
AmaRUUUU
---
Me too 
---
I have a booster!
---
Yay I claimed it and I didn’t get it.  Just like all of the other twitch prime items... even tho it’s linked lmao
---
They've never actually changed the rate of fire for any of the full auto guns, it's more likely they changed the menu values to match the actual value
---
Ctrl-F

---
What the actual fuck Ubi
---
How do u make ur voice overlay transparent?
---
Damn krauts took our shotguns, but meanwhile this shorts wearing jackass is stabbing people with fucking neurotoxin.
---
When Glaz got Warden's version of seeing through smoke by standing still, he dropped from being one of the best operators the the very worst attacker. Now imagine having that ability but on a low duration, high cooldown, pea shooter without acog, 1 speed, and not being able to deploy the smoke yourself. So you'd be relying on the enemy to be using smokes or flashes,  if they have any,  and if they decide to use them on Warden.
---
Si la cosa es que no juego buck, eso es lo que mas me duele
---
So you gonna give this man some free alpha packs or something for his troubles?
---
A Man should not be able to have such power
---
Same in unranked, people always starts to give callouts when we are 3 - 4 lmao
---
They literally discussed this like 3 weeks ago, this isn’t anything that new
---
Alpha Pack percentage affecting loot is a really, really bad idea. It would encourage throwing so fucking hard. The game would become unplayable due to people purposefully losing over, and over, and over, and over (and over, and over, and over) and over - and over, and over - and over, to try to get a better drop. Think about it, you get like a 1.5% increase for a casual loss? People would throw 30-40 matches in order to have a shot at a Legendary pack.
---
I just recently bought asus tuff gaming laptop was like 650$ ryzen 5 1050ti 4gb gpu I’m running on very high 90-110 fps
---
I want to get lesions but I feel like his gun skins are pretty bad, although he’s one of my mains and I have the best stats out of all my ops with him
---
When i play Kapkan i try to predict which way the enemy might traverse through the doorway. If i know he will probably rush, i place the trap on head level, since everyone is looking down.
---
[removed]
---
source? I have 19h with cavi and would love for her to have an elite skin
---
It’s just such an intimidating game lol. I’m gonna try to jump back into t hunt tomorrow for starters.
---
In the past it was a bad weapon... Now it's a bad weapon with bad animations.
---
Trash aim
---
t hunt sucks, do casual or unranked
---
that would be amazing, cavi and lesion are my two defending mains but I don’t like lesions elite all that much
---
Oh thanks, now I can't unsee it smh
---
You're forgiven. It's also our responsibility to not out our traps on your existing ones. Also, don't put your Kapkans on windows until frost is done and left the windows alone.
---
Ela is one of the worst defenders in the game currently.
---
Hey I like outback
---
It's getting really annoying.
---
that was my reaction when they annouced it
---
blitz main btw
---
EXTRA THI-
---
Lol I just saw two more.
---
To be fair running behind doc saying shoot me deserves death.

---
In Western US half of my matches are with people who don't speak English. I check their stats and they're ALWAYS plat or diamond in Asia, but unranked here. I agree, I don't know why the rank changes based on location
---
Don't worry about it man. I got around 600 hours in this game, and I only just recently found out you can set preferences for casual game modes.
---
That is nice and well but I bet only a handful of people read that. What I mean is that they make a statement which is very visible, be it "we are working on it, but it's hard" or whatever - but in the current climate a lot of players feel left behind.
---
Also there is currently NO word whatsoever out about the instability, and people reported it even on the TTS (I know I did).

Why do a lot of console players melee randomly? Is it something about the game controls on console? I've seen it a lot of this sub when the clip is from console. Not hating or anything, just genuinely curious.
---
And also options to turn on/off bombers and barbed wire rooms. Some people play Thunt for fun and not for practice.
---
*Fucking bullshit~*
---
No one ever wants to hear it, but it is what it is. If they actually cared, like really cared, they'd take action on it.
---
How long do you have to ware it
---
Sorry but I like moving targets that don’t keel over when I shoot them for tracking training
---
they removed bombers this season already
---
I've been getting that a lot too. Contacted customer support and they found it had something to do with the NVIDIA Game Ready drivers for my GeForce. Had me do a clean install without that driver, and I havent had problems since then.
---
*Did you see the fucking comment posted by UbiNoty~*
---
Ya they do i have seen it on my PS4 chances are you have yet to come up against a hacker that has been banned.
---
Oh thank God it's a cross post
---
Honestly it’s the most balanced map cuz both teams get to play outside!
---
We play as 3 stack most days and when one of us gets voted to kick we all just leave. Basically "there you fuck sticks, play as a twosome and get waxed, hope you enjoy it"
---
R4c for rush, G36C for outside aiming
---
They don’t do it on console at all
---
It's one of the best guns, but it's not the best.
---
Highest DPS and lowest TTK only, but that's a body shot thing.
---
Other SMG are good because they have higher ROF for headshot lotto, and the 416C only has 740 RPM.
---
I don't remember how much muzzle flash does the 416C have, but it could be one of the reason why you have problem with it.
---
It is an bug that occured during Chimera too
---
But hopefully I can get one before they remove it again
---
There are even people getting into matchmaking 1v5, we have to face.. ubi lost control over their bugs/ddosers and all the annoying stuff..
---
Actually, it isn't a ringtone. It is the vibration sound. Any device will have a vibration feature. It can be made to vibrate.
---
The question you should be asking is why isn't rainbow's closed circuit Intel system more secure.
---
Basically, defenders' security has been dropped to train them for device hacks, such as from Dok.
---
They should do that to people who reinforce the wall next to my mirror
---
no frost trap and gu mines? pffff
---
no
---
They should make it like csgo, where there is a 5 minute warmup and if anyone leaves during that warmup the match is cancelled and the person who left gets banned and loses MMR. During this warmup there should be a shooting range where PvP damage is disabled for that time.
---
Isn't that what the shotgun is for? The literally only use for the ita12s is breaching.
---
that is exactly why she can't waste any more time!
---
Wtf am i watching
---
Im so happy i got it when it was available. Also bring back outbreak
---
Its just feels
---
*naked*
---
Available yet for me? Didn’t buy pass y want to trol team tho
---
nah Fortress sucks. rooms, corridors everything.
---
wow, this game never *ceases to amaze me* how shitty it is
---
Now it's just missing an ADS...
---
Why don't you get gud instead of talking about how good you are?
---
Poor doc 😂😂
---
Their liberal use of the word "C*nt" begs to differ
---
Almost all Professional csgo players use aim_botz to warm up and I'm sure the same would be true of siege players if available
---
That's not a story...
---
...Its the plans for the evening
---
Wtaf was that mute doing?
---
How was it buffed?  I need to know now 😂
---
They only care about pc. Might as well switch. I did
---
Only content u downloaded from the xbox store are available on your smurf just like pro leaque sets. (These are actual item you can see when u go to your game and press manage) but everything u buy in game with renown or seige credits. Those wont be available on other accounts (year operator bundels elite uniforms and other cosmetics) i think this is this way to prevent or atleast make it harder for people like u to use smurfs. Cause if you have to use a smurf you are probably not in the rank u deserve to be in.
---
Why the hell did this man get down voted so much.. he just said we he enjoys doing.. IN CASUAL.. Jesus Christ.. poor guy

Why would a device used to view and control cams vibrate? It wouldn’t it’s dumb as hell. Also, it wouldn’t vibrate that loud if for some dumb reason they put the tech in to make it vibrate.
---
I saw this but with a grizzly on top and a bear trap behind it
---
I already am. My hs ratio and rank show that. Why dont you grow a brain?
---
Had a ranked win last night that didn't count. I also didn't receive any renown and alpha pack chance increase, just like my friend and teammates in that match.

Unless this is a known kind of visual bug that fixes itself after some time, I'm not sure if I will get my points. It's been over 9 hours :/

There are much worser ranked maos out there,
---
In my opinion they did a pretty good job on this map, they closed a ton of windows, got some new rotation, new spots and its one of the maps which is counterable as attacker.
---
Its still a better rework than the new Cafe.
---
Just because I did a quick peak doesn’t mean I’m sweating lmao
---
Damn...man I love montt clutches
---
Put a frost mat there and you got yourself a real anchor
---
Omg I was just talking about this mad agree
---
110% agree
---
Nice skin tho
---
Expect ubi are not going to bother to try and sue the guy so nothing will happen to him
---
Fair enough. But you could still introduce my operator and buff warden.
---
Why do I have -1 upvotes . All I said is true .

Reporting on console doesn’t help since Ubisoft can only ban accounts which belong to Ubisoft. On Xbox and ps4 your account belongs either to Microsoft or Sony and they seem to ignore bad behavior since banning would mean they knock an account not only for siege out which is bad for them financially wise
---
"VP-Next" could be solution. Dedicated IP  and not need to install any app. Also no limitation in p2p and bandwidth.
---
You could buy a new game and do some of its challenges.
---
What's pathfinder mean too btw?
---
It’s fucking awesome
---
"Milked for content on youtube" 
---
Damn son, I wouldn't suggest you uploading a video in which you got shat on lol
---
I disagree, I like skyscraper more than fortress. Less confusing
---
Nah making people like you mad and trolling them is kinda my niche
---
Banhammer
---
You still need a Ubisoft Club account to play online. They could ban this account, it belongs to Ubisoft.
---
Why aren't they unlocked then? Is this a bug
---
I'm really sleepy so forgive me if I forgotten something obvious. Does any operator have a passive, especially a passive that is separate from there gadget?
---
If so, who?
---
Even jackal has to click on footprint's.
---
Also the whole smoke thing seems a little weak for anyone except Warden and maybe Pulse.
---
Might as well just have normal smokes right? I mean it DOES specifically counter just Glad I think ...which also sounds wrong.
---
But , if your heat signature is only hidden while in smoke, wouldn't one simply throw a nade into it and or spray it, since they can't see you ? (Unless there Warden ofc).
---
Explain to me exactly what else the fuck you are even remotely capable of doing. What kind of juvenile, rage against the machine, bullshit are you feeding me here.
---
To hell with their design.
---
Wow, I thought this was official artwork, I actually thought it was 3d artwork. Nice!
---
I feel this

How tf you capture such a photo
---
Is it me or is that the Hemlok from Titanfall/Apex Legends?
---
I had 80%
---
Warden doesn't need to be OP, he just needs to be decent. Literally everything about him before this season's buffs were terrible qualities. 1 speed with a weak as fuck gun, no ACOG, and a basically useless gadget since he has no way to utilize it offensively.
---
Warden is my boi, but he's so garbage and will continue to be until Ubi at least gives him a gun with an ACOG like the P90. Not only does it fit his character to carry one, but it's just as much of a pea shooter as the MPX. The only thing that would be effectively different is the ACOG (and the 20 extra rounds) which would help him out a lot.
---
moro
---
It is shared from the apex legends subreddit.
---
\*Breathe in\* BOYO
---
Its not a console only problem, however i think the issue PC has with hackers has somewhat removed alot of the players who would be likely to do this kind of action.
---
I'll say this for the last time:
---
THEY DON'T CARE!
---
In like 3 hours I believe
---
thank the devs it's not like this anymore
---
I actually had a friend that managed to get 99.5 before. I have a video of it because I don’t expect anybody to believe me. I didn’t at first. Turns out that when you pass 100% it just gives you the alpha pack
---
Then what do you suggest they do to fix it?
---
thats basically heart beat sensor
---
The only time warden has worked out for me, was when a blitz chased me down a set of stairs. He flashed me but I activated the glasses and was able to dome him. I enjoy playing him, but his gadget is rarely useful.
---
Had a game like that today. I play with 3 of my friends so the 5th person is a random. We were losing in the first two rounds and this random kept dying early and leaving the rest of us to finish the round but we were not as good as the other team. He turns on his microphone to say "what the fuck are you guys doing? You guys suck" and leaves the game... Come on man.
---
I want one of these
---
Got ddosed in an unranked game when it was 1-1..
---
They’re doing god’s work
---
That will useless to add cause using MK can't be proved since ubi can't detect of someone using it and you can't ban someone because you think he might be using MK it's not like wall hacks or aimbot that are easy to prove I used to play on console and I know it is a big problem to be honest it is the main reason why I switched to pc
---
Why do I find it so cute that you call him ''the shield guy''?
---
Yeah, y’know. Bring it’s damage down, increase the cool down. They can do that
---
Warden with the MPX is literally the same thing as Rook or Doc with an MP5, just without an ACOG.
---
”Legendary Weapon Skin”
---
I think it’s somekind of basketball?
---
got ddosed in an unranked match when it was only 1-1..
---
Why?
---
They won't ban ur psn or xbox live account but they can ban the ubi account which is cause I to lose all ur progress in the game
---
I can disagree
---
Thank you :))
---
Did you think he was going to the wall? No , I thought he was going to come threw the door like a regular human being
---
Of course you can
---
Wow the 101th same Comment butchering weeks of work c: such wow
---
Basically, but it's only one scan that last 2-3 seconds
---
Clach and blitz are a waste of ban especially clash she is super easy to deal with
---
Abandoned building in Budapest
---
Sometimes it controls me
---
I wonder if you can lose your way into an alpha pack
---
That's great to hear.

They were, it didnt show unless you had them iirc

It's ALGAE FIN
---
You can't do anything about it, Ubisoft is trying to igonore as it costs alot of money to fix this problem.
---
Have you tried being less toxic?
---
The first two bullets hit dead on from the looks of it.
---
It's okay , lad :)
---
Lmfao, nice
---
I feel like making him a 2 speed and letting him see while moving would be a better trade off
---
I love this so much
---
Are they leaving or is it the game being weird? This season has had a lot of game crashes with it.
---
Its operation ember rise now and Ubisoft still hadn't done anything about it
---
Algae fin
---
I swear this thing happened to me and my team today also on bank in casual
---
Yea it can
---
Welcome to the club.
---
Passive abilities require nothing to trigger. All mentioned above are not passive abilities. You have to react pretty quickly to stun yourself as doc, or hold down the action key to get up as zofia. Even though they aren’t MAIN abilities, they most certainly are not passive.
---
The hit box of the normal wall gets bigger when you reinforce the wall and sometimes the New reinforced walls hit box ends up clipping through other objects in which case those objects get destroyed like mute jammers and goyo sheilds and most other wall places items
---
Just like if a drone is hugging the other side of the wall and the wall is reinforced, the drone is destroyed. Same applies for Goyos gadget.
---
No noob it’s a feature
---
It’s a feature not a bug
---
I have feeling that i have seen this name in casual before

One would hope. Thanks.

Crouch spam back.

An ace . And against cheaters ? This will be the top post in no time

With only the goyo i can tell you it might survive.

I once played it like this and we killed 2 people with goyos, aftetwards we let them push and without us or them even knowing.. the frosts were still on place and downed the other 2 guys.

I just close the game by the task manager (I'm a PC noob so idk if that damages the game or not, and it is faster than restarting the computer) and yeah it is frustrating.

Lol you could probably still carry me ngl
---
I want to talk about the meme side of Rainbow, like content creators and memes.
---
It’s called a frag grenade, and though it can’t destroy ADSs it’s pretty awesome at getting everything else. Maybe this is why they gave them to dokki and glaz 
---
I may be speaking out of my butt because I don’t know how the range compares but.. yeah
---
He didn't think of a beter use in a small room
---
Classic fuze. Nice editing tho
---
I’ll invite you
---
Well it makes it like the matches didn't happen
---
Just because you get black ice doesn't mean you main that character
---
It really does suck, especially if it’s ranked, since if you leave and don’t return, you get a temporary ban
---
I’ve tried that but siege always pops up infront of it and I can’t alt tab out or anything. Maybe next time I’ll try to take the game out of full screen
---
Don't spawn peek me then or i'll counter-spawn peek you !
---
A friend of me got a leaving penalty without a reason. He didn't left the game or went afk
---
Nope. You'd see Tower and Skyscraper banned before Outback and Theme Park.  
---
Theme Park isn't even bad, just too dark in a few areas.
---
You have a proof of them wanting to ddos with a picture of their platform and username too.
---
Send that to Microsoft and Ubisoft Support.
---
It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that you got more Elo because of the cheaters, even if you lost against them. Essentially, they’re removing those matches, they getting rid of any effect they had on any players. You’re just back where you were if you hadn’t played against cheaters
---
In theory. A good clash wont allow it. A good clash gives you the clash spin.
---
In the first case - WE dont need this screen at all. This is UI nad UX failure - one unnecessary click.
---
They've made glaz useless. Removing impacts and give them sheilds, removing sheilds and giving them barbed wires, like why the fuck are they constantly taking things away from operators and give them ideas things.
---
I’ll look into it, thanks!
---
What if you had laid instead of bandit, and put a Ela mine and a frost trap by the shield

Or he's just playing a custom game with friends and recorded a funny moment that happened..? Hard to believe someone would fake such an underwhelming clip.
---
I wouldn't say to main Jäger immediately, but definitely give him a try. Great pull tho. Im jealous
---
Fire rate really doesn't matter when the fo-12 puts out almost the exact same damage per mag and per second as both the sagia and french semi shotgun. It doesn't need as nerf. She's already one of the weakest op's in game.
---
Looks awesome! Why’d you get detention though?
---
Ah yes please just nerf it even though most people don’t run it and it sucks if you don’t use it properly maybe get better at the game and you should never die to shotguns
---
agreed
---
That is any other reason for this, I don’t know if I put it in here but I want to get a separation from levels, to be exact, 0-60 and everyone else just mixed in, I know it isn’t fair and all but it’s only to test my aim, I personally for some reason, don’t know why, but ranked is easier for some reason, I’ll be honest, so my plays suck anyways overall, I can promise you that I don’t Ash rush people or spawn peek in casual though, the people who do spawn peek in it are just sweats that warm up constantly, for me it’s only to see how bad my aim is that day
---

Damn I'll give you that but the toxicity on Xbox is just ridiculous

Nomad is by far one of the best ops to have.
---
So things they can’t do anything about and something that is completely opinion based will kill the game huh or just kill it for you
---
A week after release
---
Cus I'm free! Free-falling!!!
---
Is it real? I damn hope so! I got kicked three times last ranked match!! I got 12 kills 2 deaths and we still lost 4-5
---
Very true
---
I think the vortex is amazing, I kinda wish they'd give it to frost
---
i wonder what happens if both teams completely leave
---
I think i had a stroke after i saw this picture
---
*Marley intensifies*
---
Me neither, it’s happening in casual and unranked even
---
Aww man, XboxAhoy was my GUY for awhile...I hope he gets back into the fray with the upcoming MW series.

Shes probably really toxic. Like pre nerf Ela. Look at that look in her eyes, I bet she dropshots like crazy.

Yeah I feel you on that, it would definitely benefit newer players in casual

Indeed

I’ll give that try. Thanks.

Right.

You love to see it

I’m gonna stop you right there

I'm glad I bring you joy.

This a very simple &amp; needed Thunt QoL! And should be fairly easy to Ubi to implement, after all they've done it before during the outbreak event. A team of Gridlock, Echo, Doc / Finka, Montagne / Clash &amp; Goyo / Capitao would be super fun, in Thunt disarm bomb at realistic imo!
---
Bonus points for Ubi, if they give us an on / off switch for Nitro Cell Rooms, barbed wire rooms &amp; bombers; every bot is a bombers game mode option  &amp; headshot only option! And if they remove the flinch / weapon punch when you hit a White Mask bot, with any of your guns.

Nowhere near as powerful as smokes.

 And sometime, the only way to save a life **Is to take one**

Oops

I doubt hoty got carried, its not hard to get plat 2
---
this is fucking awesome, OP
---
I might be dumb but what’s going on here? I don’t see any cheating
---
Nobody scared the lord
---
I'm sure they would if they had any control over the servers, but they run off of Microsoft azure servers, so they can't really do anything about it
---
W.T.F
---
This the latest reply known to man
---
3 barrels now that's epic
---
Who?
---
Easy to explain but it is stupid explanation lmao. Basically they wanted people to see quicker progression in ranks rather than holy shit I won five games and I am still silver 4. Now almost every three games you will increase in ranked so you "feel" good but in all reality nothing has actually changed. You are still at the same elo being played from last season and the change is just a feel good measure not an actual compensation for rank variety
---
Yeah, I agree. I wouldn't classify this as "cheating," this is just overloading a server to kick all of the players. I agree it's scummy, it happened to me last night, but it's not "cheating."
---
I'm a quick learner I suppose

It’s just him lagging or the servers themselves being slow. Sometimes if the connection isn’t good, it’ll turn into a constant rubber banding situation. No ones actually cheating though

Yea claymore's ideal if you're overwatch sniper

Unfortunately Smokes are more versatile since being overwatch sniper tends to result in you being the last guy standing, while not being overwatch sniper means you have to push with everyone else.

Frags now offer a unique benefit to smokes, esp for the last man standing

Mac lol no
---
Seriously the Devs should take a look at the rampant cheating &amp; ddosing issues at hand. Literally Asia servers are filled with cheaters 7/10 of games. 
---
Just go take a look at the list of players with 5k MMR &amp; their stats. 
---
Don't get me started with the DDOS &amp; server issues currently happening with this new seasonal patch...
---
Low effort is still better than no effort at all good art mate
---
I really wish Ubi made things like this to sell. I just want more Siege merch.
---
Luck
---
i think i was the bandit or we did exact the same on the same place ^^
---
Good job
---
I play her as a fast and quiet rusher. Someone checking cams is gonna feel a lot more comfortable without their cams all shot the fuck out
---
Terrorists can do that, you're able to only hold your pistol.
---
Why do you think Ubisoft intended there to be DDOSers?
---
Your fault for staying still behind an unreinforced wall
---
Well except Bank, Plane, Kanal, Kafe, Coastline, Checkpoint, Consulate, Outback, etc.  You know, basically any map with spawn peeks or runouts.
---
Because shotguns are unreliable and inconsistent. Feels like a dice roll everytime you shoot a enemy that is not at melee range.
---
flick?
---
Did they gave no headphones?
---
A small flick
---
They made it so you can't rush scoped anymore by forcing you to move slowly while scoped to still get the benefit.
---
Then they gave him frags so he's more versatile
---
Except anyone with an ACOG can counter a spawnpeek. Some even better than Glaz :(
---
This looks like a action Big Monster  Movie where she is tze Big Monster that destroys anything
---
Think it is today when the ops released on Wednesday, the timer said 5 days 24 hours
---
Good job, I’m proud!
---
BUt you can't always report accurately. Unless the guy blatantly says I am doing it or his name has an indication of doing it, Ubi has no way of finding out who is doing it.
---
Yes and when you select an oporator, you can see there full body.
---
All you need is HUNK and you will have a new Alpha Team
---
Congrats man,Omw to plat as well
---
Blitz is inevitable you fucked in this situation
---
low effort only qualify if you doing it under 1 min
---
What they are doing is called DDOSing. DDOSing is illegal and is a federal crime with prison time.
---
Just need to give warden defender smokes. Lime 3 or 4 with low duration and smaller radius.
---
I'm responding to the blog post. Effectively Ubisoft is telling us to throw a match if we suspect the enemy of cheating or take an abandon as the most effective way of maintaining our MMR. What a useless system.
---
Recoil on both guns is horrible so it makes using an acog hard.
---
Your low effort is better my my max effort
---
Fishing for compliments.
---
Thicc smoke
---
remmington ACR
---
I wish but it’s up to the company like Sony to do that since Ubisoft can’t just ban them like a finger like on PC,they need permission from them
---
Bet
---
The 11th is when it released the 9th was a Monday
---
What did it cost?
---
I will never understand why the Germans have managed to hold onto their borderline busted weapons. Bandits has 6 damage on the also amazing mx4 storm of alibi and jaeger has a whopping 9 damage on kapkans smig in exchange for just 10 rpm.
---
In the case of jaeger at least there’s the worse recoil, lack of an angled grip (although that’s usually not too important on defence because angle holding is important)  and the worse ads time. But those downsides are pretty small.
---
Plus they have extremely good gadgets, it boggles the mind.
---
Ahh so I'm just an idiot that got my info wrong got it thanks for the help everyone
---
I did that on clubhouse once, rook. Just thought "turn around" and domed a thatcher
---
what about a cav on site?
---
Sledge looks like “you got him fucked up” and he brought the crew to roll through
---
Not always. One time Siege was messing up and my name said Durango and I had access to year 2 ops only. Not even original. Yes it was in Ember Rise
---
Purge them in holy hell fire!
---
Am I the only one that's sad bc they took away Jagers deployable shield? I feel like it was unnecessary.
---
Remember no Russian
---
This fucking sucks
---
They should make certain ops weaker if all equipment isnt deployed.
---
I also have SAS pistol. I have died many times trying to get the final kill with it so I can show off
---
Well now you do
---
Remove the stand still to see limitation on him and he'll be semi decent
---
That's one crazy short sawed off shotgun you got there, thatcher

Please don't ever do that again, make a recovery file of windows and go off of that. You'll have a watermark to activate windows but it's a lot more reliable.
---
No one forces you to open the discussion and see the clip. If you are not interested you can simply ignore the post.

I will come inside of you cunt
---
I only play in 5 stacks and all of us can still play but all of us got this same two match reduction of MMR. We beat two separate cheaters in two separate matches both of which went 9 rounds and I have videos of. I didn't submit them as a ticket because I figured Ubisoft would punish us for winning in an unfun match full of hackers who tried their best to beat us.
---
if they add swedish ops without ak5 imma be pissed (mainly cuz im swedish) 
---
but it would be nice to have the xm8.
---
but we wont see new guns until next year anyway so thats a big sad.
---
Pog
---
Idk y lost 2 placements games for shit like that
---
Spawnpeak just used reversed card.
---
Do you end each match miles above the rest of your team?
---
Smokes would be even more helpful.  Helps for reclaiming a bomb site mor effectively, helps to deter quick plants, the number of uses is amazing
---
I honestly wish they never gave Glaz the infrared vision.  He should have stayed the way he was with the high damage and high recoil.  He is a sniper and was supposed to counter spawn-peeks.  Now I feel like he is designed to be a fragger, but now his fragging is weak.
---
Do you use the Arx or the ak-74? I recently just bought her and I’m not sure which is better.
---
What the fuck goes through your mind when you decide to post this trash fucking content on a internet forum
---
Sh*t happens. I get it.
---
yikes
---
But windows isn't secure. Besides Apple is more expensive so it has to be better.
---
Absolutely insane craftsmanship OP!
---
I never really took those positive things about the suppressor into consideration I'll probably give it a try tonight and see if my view on it changes but I'm still not convinced that there is a point for the laser unless your playing against bronze tear players who don't watch for it
---
Hello WhoopWhoopington, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d5i6bf/anyone_elses_game_crashing_a_lot_lately/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I use both because they are bothering really good but the AK-74 has a smaller mag.
---
Like cunt this is dogshit. Not even an impressive play
---
It's the sixth sense xD
---
Yeah, makes him actually wanna quit and just become a hot dog salesman.
---

---
Wait a second.. I had this as a charm in game before Mira’s elite was even leaked
---
Agreed. Operators with niche roles should do them well, especially when you’re opting for them over ops who are strong on every site or have good weapons. Currently, picking Warden means you’ve left a better option behind.
---
As a moustache man irl, I feel insulted by warden's uselessness.
---
Yes but what I’m saying is they ruined her, they should have balanced her to a 70% pick rate not a 0% which is what they did. I’m not saying I like to abuse broken things, but just balance her
---
That is good, yes.
---
Similar experience on outback, planted on sight and then was watching an angle then I thought, someone is gotta be behind me and turn and domed a caveria silent stepping into the door way. Dude that was supposed to be watching that door way had looked away and it's probably the sickest thing I've done.
---
A single headshot from any weapons is an instakill, rook armor let’s you take two more body shots of any kind
---
Definitely not lowkey.
---
Reminder that Bandit’s MP7 used to have 36 damage
---
It’s been alive for like 4 years and still has an incredibly strong following, keep dreaming.
---
That craps ugly af
---
I'm more disgusted by the 27 bullets in the magazine. I mean come on cant yiu just reload
---
Who sent what?
---
No,that's what Fuzes LMG skin says when reloading
---
How is this a failure? I thought the default was the white garage image?
---
How to get unpopular in 4 words
---
*sigh*, Goyo shields are going to cause so many issues...
---
Correct. The ARX has heavier hitting rounds, but fewer of them.
---
No game lasts forever. Stop being delusional.
---
That's silly. There's enough time to plant all three and make it to a spawnpeek site.
---
Canberra?
---
no attachments work too if you aim for the head
---
Why are you booing me I'm right
---
I'm way to poor to get one but I'm curious in how to do this because I saw a Dokkabei one too.. 🤔
---
It's a small, roughly baseball sized, object which is thrown in the general direction of enemy operatives so that it can explode and cause damage to them.
---
Ash’s r4c, frosts gun has little to no recoil but shoots really slowly
---
mozzie commando, c75 auto
---
&gt;A castle window to obj. 
---
&gt;Everyone in obj.
---
&gt;Mute not muting window. 
---
Bruh.

Basically every gun on PC.
---
treat the flair as if it’s an emoji. you can put :zofia: or :ash: and it’d put that as your flair. you can do up to 5
---
Did you win?
---
It's not too difficult. There's a bunch of different programs or apps that let you edit/create watchfaces.
---
Im on ps4 forgot to mention
---
Whos the other dude?
---
I've done this multiple times already, I had 147 packs not too long ago. I saved them up this past Christmas because I wasn't able to get any presents or get any so that was my Xmas present opening lol And boy did I get some good drops! I got back to back legionaries at one point. Good luck when you open them!
---
if this is the worst pack system then you havent played black ops 4
---
Montagne gets a 360 shield, sledge can remove entire meshes off the map, tachanka with a portable minigun
---
I know lol
---
No, got 4 kills though.
---
Still learning Nomad, but I do enjoy her.. it seems like both these air jabs were placed close to each other. If an enemy walks by them both, will only one trigger?
---
А как поддержать то? Просто комент оставить? Тогда I agree
---
Frost has less recoil than ash for me r4c is hard to control
---
Thanks for the very fast reply :)
---
should be hiding across the map doing nothing helpful
---
Yea like the front of the shield goes into the wall like the fuze charge but instead of throwing out grenades it destroys the wall like sledge
---
oh yeah
---
Sledge can break reinforced walls
---
nobody ever said the shotgun is bad its one of the best if not the best shotty
---
Does 78 damage to 1 armour, then does less to 2 and 3 armour, usually taking 1 more shot to kill with each armour increase but only when it’s fairly long range, at close range it’s gonna be 2 shots, when I first started I favoured dmr’s as well, usually 2-3 shots to kill someone, rather than multiple bullets that have high recoil, but I’m the game of siege, headshot is 1 shot no matter what, unless there’s like 3-4 people lined up in a row and you headshot them all with 1 bullet then the last guy will live, just some random siege mechanics
---
It's happened to me before. I met some cool guys after I got a 4k on their team in my last defense round and lost. We then grouped up and wrecked every team we played for the next 5 games.
---
I restarted multiple times throughout yesterday. I checked my twitch account and my Ubisoft account multiple times. Everything is correct. To be fair I haven’t ran into anyone using the skin yet...and i assume a lot of people have twitch prime. So maybe it’s just delayed a bit on pc.
---
Nah, no problem. Not too busy right now and I thought why not help you out :)) If you ever do get a watch or whatever and want to design your own things, feel free to reach out :))
---
Do you have compensater and foregrip on it?
---
More like 35 shots 3 guys
---
Are you on pc? I am on pc and I checked many times and everything is correct.  Can only think that maybe it is delayed on pc.
---
I will when I get one. Thanks
---
Have fun with your 100 commons
---
vigil's k1a, go with an vertical grip and a muzzle break and there will nearly be any recoil whatsoever
---
Commando
---
Nice to see a sense of humour in the devs
---
You had one job!!!
---
German science is the best in the world
---
Not funny, didn't laugh. Also, they're portuguese, not brazillian
---
Not  really much use in warden
---
and reinforce and place down barber wire and most times pick up rook armor ?
---
he sent it
---
not the only way to buff him at all, however it would most certainly help. If this was to happen, they need to lower the speed of other operators, as we need more 1 speed attackers, not further reducing the amount we have. 
---
If Fuze was to become a 2 speed, then yes, his weapon just in case it becomes an issue, should be nerfed a little before with this change. No risks should be taken.  The ops that could be become a 1 speed are --&gt;
---
Lion
---
* Keep him scans the same, but also add a passive which insta-tags runouts with a full body outline (Like old Lion), to entice people to keep on playing him.
---
* Swap Fuze's and Lion's Equipment around so lion gains Breaches and Smokes, while Fuze gains Claymore and Stuns.
---
Glaz
---
* Reduce the penalty for movement even further in terms of his thermal vision
---
   * Takes 6.5 secs of movement to lose the vision completely (Same as currently)
---
   * Now only takes 0.5 seconds to regain full charge, allowing him to regain vision easier (Buff)
---
* Provide the GSh-18 pistol with the Romeo 1 Reflex sight, so it competes with the PMM more
---
* Provide an additional OTs-03 variant called the OTs-03A which has a faster fire rate at the cost of damage. Buff the damage of the base OTs-03 with this. Do what they've done with the Ember Rise recycled weapons by giving them a different colour scheme to the original weapons on their first lot of ops.
---
Maybe even Twitch
---
* Provides us with a gadget destruction operator for all speed values, with her armour seeming quite extensive so it wouldn't seem too unreasonable
---
* The F2 would likely feel more balanced because of this change, so this is another bonus
---
* Buff the Twitch Drone noticeably, by increasing zaps, allowing it to jump, and giving it some other benefits
---
* People would be playing her for the gadget (which is a lot better) and she would seemingly have less impact fragging wise. This actually makes a lot of sense to me personally.
---
Console? Console has a crashing problem, and pc has a freezing problem
---
It’s happened to me too, I submitted a support ticket on r6fix so hopefully it helps, I’ll attach this image to it as well
---
Yup. 100% I have almost 600hrs in THunt and &gt;1min in PvP. I assume that's default, cause I've never played PvP, even for a second. I play solo or with one friend.
---
Always believed in you 👌🏼
---
When is the ft. with jäger acog
---
Fake account
---
Yeah that would be a great addition to the current shield ops
---
Your the hibana right
---
I wonder if anyone has tried getting a vpn to combat being hit offline...
---
Ubi might as well put Warden in the same place they put Barlett University, in the fucking TRASH BIN.
---
youre buns
---
Why does Ash have a Russian red dot?
---
What is their to fix? this is exactly how they wanted the gadget to work.
---
I just watched the event unfold. I'm the termite
---
It does not matter if it is a desktop or a PS4. Open it up, clean it with pressured air and reapply thermal paste.
---
It's even worse on ps4 mate... way worse
---
Timing after all. 
---
Kaid's claws take time to start their effect and while It CAN be done it's extremely difficult against Thermite, while on Hibana is quote easier. 
---
Also, unlike with Bandit, Thatcher is a viable counter against it. 
---
So yeah, Kaid can trick Hibana and isn't directly countered by Maverick, but isn't as reliable as Bandit and can't almost do anything against Thermite unless you have some kind of support from an outside Valkyrie cam or you are extremely good at predicting Thermite.
---
Your mom got stale  
---
Its 2019 we out here saying yo daddy's so fat jokes now
---
What if you're playing on wifi, lose connection, and reconnect with a different ip? You've just been banned for having shitty wifi

If you go onto the subreddit itself you can edit your user flair and set it to which ever operator your heart desires.

---
no it's removed from all of her guns :(
---
Non season pass players should get access to the new Ops starting tomorrow
---
he’s better than the last guy he had to kill...either that or his controller died at the wrong time. he’s probably better than you too
---
it's gone from all of her guns tho
---
NUL
---
Clash dont do it!!
---
I looked at that and saw that ALL the GSG9 ops have a M45
---
Why would you change IP addresses though? It’s unlikely that your external IP would change.
---
Even then, it’s not the rest of the teams fault that your internet is bad.
---
Thank you for this :)
---
coming grom x1, i know xD
---
Tomorrow will be a week since Ember Rise released.
---
Not today
---
then open a ticket on the ubisoft support page
---
link: [https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/Games](https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/Games)
---
Ironic
---
It's unlikely, but possible. I've had it happen to me on university wifi (not while in game)
---
For a company trying to expand their playerbase, do you really think it's a good idea to band everyone who has bad internet?
---
I mean it’s just a game that I play for fun so I don’t really care, just didn’t realize how toxic this sub could be though
---
Sure I guess I’ll do that but im pretty sure it’s on Ubi’s side
---
Fair enough
---
Oh yeah, they were a day later this season, it's usually Tuesday
---
What the heck is "Refined"?
---
T hunt spam lean corners that’s what I did
---
I remember sitting in the queue with friends for 20+ minutes to play the same 3 groups over and over. Those were the days. I played on console back then tho so rip all my year 1 seasonal skins and glacier skin.
---
Same man! We had to deal with so much more bullshit back then compared to now haha.
---
But why? That doesnt help much
---
You can *start* worrying about grenades now
---
THIS SHIT IS SO ANNOYING
---
Fuck you, Twitch is S+ tier.
---
Honestly, it's not hard if you wanna find someone's address passwords etc try out weleakinfo they have a large database of people you can simply just search their username and you have a good chance of finding info 😄
---
Yea your IP address will change eventually. But it’s unlikely to change within the 5-10 minutes it takes you to reconnect. If it does, that’s just bad luck.
---
There’s still been some crashing and also ddossing (Ps4)
---
Came here to plug for the T5 as well, absolutely incredible weapon. I don’t play Lesion for the Gu, I play him for the T5
---
I mean the satisfaction of opening them all at once is so good
---
Are you teammates Ddosing?
---
Well it's kind of convenient when Ubisoft can see this one guy that has played 200 games this season and 195 of those games have been ddosed and he has one every single one of those games that have been ddossed.
---
If they don't already have a system similar to what I mentioned then they need to make one. Then they can permanently ban players and have it appear in the top right. This will send a clear message to everybody else that it's time to stop.
---
And also they may not get a jail sentence but Ubisoft will prohibit them from using their services and playing their games.
---
Just goes to show that kills and that bullshit don't matter. Competent teammates and communication are far more important.
---
The chibi was a nice touch
---
Yup, the bum at the bottom
---
press F to pay your respects
---
Came out on Wednesday bud
---
Today or tomorrow
---
And he had the audacity to say, “EZ clap” after the game... notice how their top dude smacked us early on
---
There is no leak of a new gadget,just a tease of them wanting to rework his gadget or give a new one. what part did you not understand about that?
---
Notice the only reason we even won was cuz we won an attack round
---
F
---
lol
---
I was just saying how silly it was.
---
Alright everything else but that last kill made sense
---
This happened to my friends and I yesterday in fkn casual man.
---
Bandit's battery doesn't kill the hostage, why not make this not kill the hostage and then problem solved. It's not like Hostage is a ranked gamemode either.
---
It just started
---
Also gets capped spawn peeking through a bullet hole.
---
hes too dangerous to be left alive
---
Kaid
---
The season isn’t over?
---
So basically it's gotten to the point where the enemy team will hit the servers when your on attack and it will keep you from moving so your basically stuck at spawn and cant move and have to watch the timer run to zero and then you lose for not planting the bomb lol or if they are on attack they will try and plant the bomb and if they do then they hit the servers so the defenders cant move and defuse the bomb... then you lose lol, its alot of fun
---
Which is what they are for. Blitz's pistol is the only thing I have one on.
---
You can stop worrying about grenades now
---
So... did you manage to fix it?
---

---
I see it as the other way round, I'd rather be down a sledge hammer than reinforcements tbh
---
Definitely. A single soft wall right next to a door where the attackers can run out woth the hostage. Seems balanced.
---
Yeah I guessed the ddos is still going on, don't think it will ever get fixed tbh unfortunately
---
Well it's obvious that somebody is Ddossing when a player has played over 200 games this season and 190 of those games have been DDOSED. And 190 of those games he has won.
---
I am fairly sure Ubisoft has a system in place similar to that that they can use and hopefully next season we should see in the top right of our screens many players banned for Ddosing related offences.
---
Pretty epic ngl
---
Again pickrate and winrate doesn’t matter with certain ops. If Clash was bad why do you see people wrecking with her? Why do pros use clash? Your argument is stupid bruh.
---
Happy cake day!
---
This is a good idea to base I never really interact with this skylight
---
me after watching: holy fuck that was so clean, no way can people complain about anthing
---
*checks comments*
---
sigh.
---
Same reason ash has managed to hold her r4c stat wise. People love to play them, and there isn't anything objectively broken about their kit, it is just incredibly solid, and as a result a lot of good entry frags play them. Their utility is just a bonus, though with Jager it is arguably a necessity.
---
If only either one is missing, I would call it "2 Valks 1 Ash" or "2 Valks 1 Thermite"
---
It could be like the symbol thing on pc where one day people woke up with banned accounts because they spammed the symbol and I I started banning them
---
If she's rarely picked and when she does get picked her winrate is way below 50% it's not a good sign
---
He ran out of sand slots to rewind time
---
Its not meant to trick anyone, its used for entry denial, like caps bolts. Very useful for late pushes
---
Monty
---
this got me dying xD
---
Answer my question.
---
I use it on all shotguns and SMGs. Especially shotguns are must-have.
---
Personally don't use one for Monty. Don't know why.
---
That was some slow turning. Was this console?
---
I said rework his gadget or give him a new one.
---
Exactly. Even with a headshot.
---
Console
---
But not a flanking machine
---
*fucking beats you with her magic wand*
---
No, dude, therE's literally over 15+ ranks of copper because below the lowest rank of copper there's 1500 MMR that still exists
---
Is that because the proper way to use them is to not use them?
---
I  think you should read about the   lag compensation system thats in place
---
Obviously not if you're still having a problem, not the problem of the people who have good internet. I play on NA with 9 or EU with 80-90 so I feel the pain of shots not counting but nothing really can be done about it.
---
And what are the downsides to using the compensator, muzzle brake, flash hider, and vertical grips? What are the downsides to using optics vs. irons?
---
I heard this will actually be a completely separate game
---
It's a whole game based on the operation just with more cutscenes,missions and characters. What do you expect?
---
Well yeah but hopefully better then the op the gave us
---
What do you mean?
---
Uh oh..
---
Nice
---
Your ass clenches cuz of all that crouching spam lol
---
Now why do the German operators have 1911s? They design the damn game, can’t they put the right weapon they have in their hands?
---
Cyberbullied to commit suicide, you monster.
---
4v5 is winable just dont be shit
---
You could say THIS IS WHERE IT STOPS for you getting clash aces
---
I think a 9 ping and a 30 ping should have no diff and exactly there was no diff until this season.  80-90 is way too high
---
That zofia cant aim
---
UPlay+ hasn't even been up a month and they have been doing Proloeuge sets for Years, You do not need to sign up for plus to buy them.
---
*The fact that you cannot see him/her doesn't mean there isn't living being other side of the screen.*
---
R6 is a horror game chapter 2
---
The game doesn't match you on your rank label. It matches you based on your MMR, if you are incable of beating players with less than 1500 MMR at a consistent enough rate to climb, you shouldn't be out of copper. What do you want ubi to do? Reduce global MMR by 1500? Then all you do is shunt everyone up by a massive MMR gaps. The average player would be in fucking diamond/high plat if you did that. You can still see your MMR, so you can continue to climb your MMR, and if you think Ubisoft should remove this.lower buffer because you can't climb out of copper, I genuinely do not know what I'm supposed to say.
---
Unfortunately convenient doesn’t equal a conviction in a court of law. The burden of proof is beyond reasonable doubt and other than circumstantial evidence (eg games the user was in was DDOS) they aren’t going to have that.
---
Is this a serious question or are you trolling? There is a very clear and easy answer for all of those.
---
Neither could I
---
Time, effort, and dedication is what I see here my friend nice job
---
I play with a friend in Poland who would have 110-130 on NA, also 80-90 is like middle of the road for what I see on EU since there are players from the Middle East on the servers.
---
ah yes carrier, favorite map
---
Bandit reminds me of that meme with the guy hitting a bong while two people are fighting in front of him
---
Its on a smurf account. I checked. I reported it anyway through the thing on their profile

Money doesn't magically add freature into a dated game engine. They took some time just to add in extra spectators to the Lan build.

What's the downside of grips and all the various muzzle attachments? IIRC, Heavy Barrel gave you more recoil, but they removed it.
---
What do you think if Quarantine is an open world?

PELA TERRA, PELO MAR!

He literally said that you don't get the others. Which means your comment is redundant. But being able to toggle the lazer sight would have an animation that makes you vulnerable for a second, same as pulling out your lifeline as Zofia.  Not to mention if you forget to turn it off, it could give away your position. Those would be its downsides.
---
I'm just a little on edge from a rough day, so I apologize. But that rule does not make sense in this setting because it was a single letter and you still knew exactly what I was saying. I wouldnt correct someone in this situation because I would come off as asshole grammar police. We are now talking about the spelling error instead of what we were both here to talk about. Yes sometimes maybe you should correct people, but not when it's this trivial.
---
I use lazor on like everything. I wouldve placed it on the corner to your right and you wouldn't have noticed it. Gotta keep it on a wall that they cant see or keep moving  quickly and have them not see it at all.
---
Вы русский?
---
Good luck linking a actual name with an account name to ban
---
Basically, it's all they can "do" but even then they cant really... do it
---
Why are there so many console players
---
You get more points if someone else takes the kill than if you do. Knockdown plus kill assist is more than knockdown assist plus kill confirmed.
---
YTA

Nobody:

PlayStation: It's a cross

The vortex holo.

Alright will try that

If you don't have every peak memorized you are as good as dead.

I would make a point about you being high on LSD, but that's low hanging fruit, you do you pal, even if i disagree
---
If you're that triggered by a ks in cas you need to stop playing rainbow.
---
Oh. But that doesnt really matter.
---
I play on ps4 without a mic....there is no communication other than knifing, shooting or pinging
---
it is simple if the call is RUSH then you commit to the rush to 100%. That's the rule I didn't make it I just follow it
---
Honestly it doesn't matter as long as the enemy dies. I've stolen kills on accident because I thought the person was prone. Tking over a downed kill is petty and not worth your energy.
---
I would agree with you if it wasn't sledge
---
Younger sibling should play on their own account to avoid dropping elo. We all knew this change was coming. If you all play ranked together nightly then it shouldn't be a problem, unless someone is solo queuing ranked instead of casual/unranked and getting away from the group.
---
Hmm yes, gatekeeping rainbow
---
Besides, as i said multiple times, he stole my kill, then started shooting me, where i then shot him
---
So you respond to someone taking a 1 away from your score by completely ruining the rest of their experience? Very mature omegalul
---
most people do 400 Dpi and some whatever sense they're comfortable at.  I do 1 sense and 3200 Dpi. that give it's the same speed as 400 only if feels better for me
---
Just move to pc and play ranked on there
---
I think it should be the same as CSGO where 5 stacks can play together no matter what ranks they are, but to find the game, it should take the higher ranks with 100x more weight so the enemies will all be the same as the highest player on the team.  This is better than taking an average and seems like a fair penalty if you want to play with lower/higher teammates while also letting people play with their friends.
---
When people forget that Jager's more than an HK416...
---
Thank you my dude
---
This reminds me of the first menu :D
---
I feel like they made unranked for this. But if you don't want to play unranked, then what's the harm in your friend grinding mmr with the people around his rank? Also don't let little siblings play ranked, that'll help
---
600 is the dpi I feel most comfortable but I just can’t find a sens to go with it
---
Weird graphics, they look like collector models or something
---
I’m fucking colorblind so holo is the only way I can go omegalul, a tiny grey dot with either reflex or red is awful for me
---
That and he shot me a bunch, down to 5hp, where he woulda killed me but i shot him in the face
---
The downside is that you don't get the benefit of the alternative grips. There are no alternative under barrels, therefore the downside is you have to deal with something that isn't a factor when it's unequipped.
---
tbf that's pretty much how spawnpeeking goes anyways, it's a headshot vs headshot fight usually...
---
Wish my dog played seige
---
Lion op
---
At 1,000. Pls sir
---
Not that much of a big deal with Bandit tho. 
---
You need to only make some microholes and shoot at them. A drone is more than enough in guiding you for maximum efficiency. 
---
And if you are opening an outside wall probably Thermite is only waiting for you to do your things, he can just save his drone and help you destroying the batteries. 
---
Not as fast as tossing an EMP, but if you don't want to bring Twitch you might as well do It rather than leaving important walls in place.
---
**+ 130**
---
Although it is not mentioned in-game, the laser sight also decreases shotgun spread while in ADS as well, which is why they are more common on shotguns.
---
That's the nice thing about Rook, too.  As long as you put his bag down near your team you've done your job
---
That means a Scout died.

\&gt;  A flying dove has a one out of one hundred chance of being released whenever a Scout is killed via gibbing.
---
Her superior gun don’t @ me
---
I wish could get that luck
---
Yeah, you needs to use frags on buck and sledge.
---
Good PC's are expensive + all my friends are on xbox
---
This is badly worded, I see you saying he shot you first after stealing your kill, so in retaliation you killed him.  The kill steal is pretty much irrelevant because it doesn't matter, but if the guy started shooting you, you're totally justified in defending yourself.
---
Reducing hipfire spread is the only thing that lasers do in this game.
---
1. That's irrelevant 
---
2. You took the time to creep on my acc
---
3. You're clearly uninformed on psychedelics and how beneficial they are for one's mental health. Keep listening to your middle school D.A.R.E classes kiddo.
---
This is super cool! How you made it?
---
Would make sense if its released in that timeframe. That is the end of year 4 season 4 going to the start of year 5 season 1.
---
Just wondering but do you think it would be easier to add k&amp;m support so that it is available to everyone instead of the overwatch thing(idk about ps4 but the xbox console has support on games like sea of thieves and I’m pretty sure you can find a k&amp;m set for pretty cheap)
---
Honestly, I like both combos. If I'm using the SIX12SD, sometimes I'll switch to the Five-Seven, as it has more capacity.
---
the original video https://youtu.be/uXBtMglqe08
---
You spelled useless wrong...
---
Me and the bois
---
peaks are 10x harder now because the new camera perspective is in the center of the face now so you gotta know ur angle real good or dont peek at all
---
I've never used the five seven, too little damage for me. I also find the drag recoil helps me land headshots for some reason
---
I pick sort of a turn cone I guess you would call it...if I flick to the left or right I want it to stop at a certain area approximately.   If I spin all the way around just from a small flick that's too much.
---
*Switch sides*
---
Yea when I try that I usually can’t control the recoil
---
Hey, it is a free thing to add to the weapon, why not!
---
... meh.
---
TBH, I don't feel I'm in a good situation if I found my teammate using lasers.
---
Also the M870 benefited from the shotgun buff.
---
I suspect the reason they don't see harder nerfs is because at [high level play](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/news/rainbow6/siege-v3/y3s4_defenders_342847.png) bandit's actually underpowered for his pick rate and jager's success is comparable to Ash
---
did i hear doc main
---
I'm sure you're just fine at the game, half you enjoy buck too, I have the most time with him than any other operator!
---
The Five-Seven only takes one, MAYBE two less shots to kill people than the Deagle, which isnt a problem if you have a good trigger finger.
---
But I choose the one that's the most fun, and what's more fun than a Desert Eagle .50
---
i love to get spawnpeeked, it's just a free kill for me and i can feel smug about it.
---
1.) Dpi should be in increments of 200. Eg; 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200 etc.
---
2.) Don't have your DPI set higher than 1600 or lower than 400, anything too high and your game will start smoothing. Anything too low, and your aim will be jittery af.
---
3.) Pick a sens that "feels" nice, and then lower it.
---
I said you do you, it's low hanging fruit insulting you based on your personal decisions, if u wanna do drugs then that's fine, i agree with legalisation of weed, but only if the CBD levels are high, to give a standard.
---
The THC chemical component is the most dangerous tho
---
Also, i think that the brain can get hooked on the drug if used to often, specifically if it crosses the blood / brain barrier
---
If having good mental health means being high all the time, I'll take my crap mental health thank you
---
they're lowkey in that no one ever things about them until they become a problem.  Kinda the same way no one thinks about rook armor until they survive because of it
---
I would like that a lot actually. Also congrats on hitting plat 2 on ur 3rd week on PC!
---
Check and see if your mic is the primary device for your PC
---
The background happens to me sometimes when it’s connected but there’s way more glitches that that. If it really bothers you that much then going to the operators tab and going back usually fixes it
---
Yeah, I’m all for nerfing shields but that was honestly almost useless nerf. I mean, if you’re one v one you’d just knife the dude again. Or hip fire confirm kill if you suspect someone’s nearby. Only Doc can be a threat in this situation anyways.
---
If you play on PC you can at least still play the game.
---
I agree with mozzie and gridlock being perfect, both of them have brought gadgets that have effected the meta
---
Nokk and Warden were two ops that were extremely underwhelming and added nothing to attack or defence 
---
Goyo I think will be like mozzie, I feel like a lot of players will create strats with him quickly, while Amaru is similar to when gridlock launched, we just need to give it time to see how useful she is
---
This is exactly how I play both Kaid and Nomad. AUG with holo, ARX with iron sights, AK with reflex, leave the acog with the pistol when I wanna get some snipes in
---
Dude same thing happens to me, it’s the funniest thing.
---
My second alpha pack ever was a duplicate. Quit the game for a week.
---
No game has lasted for ever *yet*
---
Imagine thinking someone taking 1 kill ruined your game lol (oh and it’s very ironic)
---
Restart your router/modem or disconnect things from it
---
Even then yeah you can just spam knife the fucker to oblivion
---
For those who wanna know what the Japanese says (In the order they appear):
---
- 私 は 死にたい(Watashi wa shinitai): I want to die
---
- クソチームキル (Kuso chiimukiru): Shitty teamkill 
---
- この オタク を 蹴る(Kono otaku o keru): Kick this nerd
---
- アンインストール(Aninsutooru): Uninstall
---
- 犬のキャスト(Inu no kyasuto): Dog’s Cast (Name of the channel I think)
---
Why do people do this and think this is funny. Like seriously I thought this was a glitch but according to someone it’s not and I’m guessing people who put their shields near the hostage can get banned.
---
I think hitting them with a projectile does like 5 damage alone so that is what may have killed them.
---
I mean, it's not like they missed every shot..
---
House takes me back to the first siege reveal it’s iconic
---
Um because i'm sick and tired of people posting aces or clutches that literally a cave dwelling 5 year old could pull of even if they had never seen a mouse and keyboard/controller in their life
---
Bro, was on pc during placement, got DDoS twice, or maybe three times, placed Silver 2 after fighting my damn hardest with plats and golds. Silvers and below generally don’t have a brain, if you solo queue. Still salty bout that one
---
I said 2 godly players
---
It was a flash, I was making joke
---
Kk then... I guess every night before I go to bed I'll just have to go into unranked and kill my team. So they can tear down that bullshit!!!
---
I feel like they changed the algorithm for the packs. I used to get epic/legendary stuff all the time, now all I get is commons
---
Monty requires communication and the player cant be a dimwit. I see way too many Monty players standing in corners when they shouldn't be, standing out of corners when they shouldn't be, and ADSing when a melee or even hip fire would suffice. 
---
Monty can act as a mobile attacking Mira with skilled teams and can protect plants, revives, and prevent defusals. He is also pretty intimidating as you dont know who he is calling out and just stands in OBJ half the time. Menacingly.
---
Why tf is there a report option for hacking on console. Can you even fucking hack on console?
---
I ran into the fabled SSG 5 Stack once and I started saying ever church prayer I’ve ever known. The game was a mercifully short 0-4
---
"I can only get kills when I dont have to use a gun" 
---
- I translated it for everyone
---
This reminds me about the guy complaining about r4c acog and how its unplayable now
---
I’m aware I was just trying to figure out what happens
---
Is that al madrigal?
---
Good, Kk then... I guess every night before I go to bed I'll just have to go into unranked and kill my team. So they can tear down that bullshit!!!
---
Oh ok, sorry for the confusion, carry on
---
Never seen a game take away content punishing long time players to cater to noobs. Its sad really
---
Imagine being this much of a pathetic child you think throwing a what is essentially a digital tantrum every night will make Ubisoft change anything at all.
---
I know that Nokk had an AR to begin with (Galil according to Pengu who test played her apparently) but where did you hear that Warden was 2 Speed to begin with?
---
I never heard that part before.
---
Ahahah
---
Nah I just like the extra challenge of getting right next to a fucker and a shield helps a fuckton. Yeah I guess it’s time for me to switch back to capito for my knife kills
---
Situational ah-what?-ness.
---
this happened to a friend not me, but I understand where you’re coming from. Also, the goal of this post wasn’t to downgrade siege in any way lmao, just a small thing that happened for a split second and I wanted to slightly mock the phrase that people use constantly.
---
I mean they should do something about it but i dont think they should do this
---
Oh sorry that must affect you so mutch
---
Restaurant and Tea room are two viable sites on Tower, even media centre can be made viable.
---
That makes 3 for tower.
---
Skyscraper? Tea room/karaoke is 1. And maybe work office with the castle strat if you’re lucky but it’s still shit. Skyscraper is garbage.
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly.

Hello Commercial_Trouble, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d5oty0/game_crashing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
[Quarantine Website Link](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/quarantine/en-us/)
---
First spotted by "Sean" on the R6 Discord server this afternoon.
---
Did they take it out from the rotation completely? If so that is stupid and I predict it will be back in no time if we complain enough
---
Solo? If you are very very good with him. Otherwise no.  
---
In a Team: definitely. Not every time, but if you play well together and know exactly what strat you want to execute.
---
Ye sits just annoying ya know like play the game right it’s pretty much Makie ring her useless ya know
---
Take my upvote
---
Is cool if you think he’s good
---
Grassy ass
---
I just had a stroke reading this
---
That boi garbage
---
My bad auto correct
---
Fritwilliams shutup little bro you gotta learn what pulling your weight is and playing your part its that's what voting and having a voice is
---
I've been looking at it backwards the entire time
---
I know right
---
Monthly rotation. 3 in 3 out. Shoulda never been taken out in the first place is my point. And while you may be right i dont see enough ppl talking about this.
---
You should not be friends with that person
---
You can still play in customs
---
I disagree do you know how long it can take to get to that level I’m plat 2 level 120 and I’ve been playing a fair bit maybe that’s just my struggle with leveling up but id say I’m not that bad of a player just my opinion been playing over a year
---
In ranked you can only see level, I think your in unranked lol
---
Yeah, it's been taken out of casual rotation too, along with I think 5 others map (Plane, Yacht, Theme Park, Tower and Favela)
---
I’m currently plat 1 so I’m not sure if it’s to do with rank. If I have an unranked person or one of my mates who is a lower rank with me, I’d usually find a game on Neu pretty quickly. (Last season that is)
---
Such trash they should call him Oscar the grouch
---
Yeah, you have a voice. But so do I, and I'm using that voice to tell you you sound like an absolute idiot. Don't whine about something and not expect people to respond.
---
Either unranked u can’t see ranks
---
I've been playing this games since launch son dont test
---
Is imposible to get an ace with him
---
