No I don‚Äôt think it should be zoomed outside too but I just call it a downside cause you can die because of it.

---
---
What's wrong with meming in casual.
---
These are operators that I see in general being played the least not including myself
---
He fuckin ded
---
Probably in a party with the gold and an unranked. And how does a copper in the OTHER team result in YOU loosing?
---
Reticle is on his head, blood is out, it‚Äôs an attacker weapon so it probably had a high rate of fire, so yes, this is probably a headshot
---
if you would just look at the scoreboard you see he is intentionally on that bronze rank even tho hes clearly above plat 3 in rank
---
Didn‚Äôt they just do a ban wave? For ddosers on console?
---
I use the sasg mostly for destruction and close range and the pmm for longer range encounters(sometimes spawn peeks if I‚Äôm a brave boi)
---
Doing so is quite easy, you dont
---
By 3 fucking kills. Have you never had a bad game?
---
Points do a pretty poor job of accounting for everything players do to help their team win.  For example, you get no points for droning in a teammate and setting up his kill with your intel.  Or for making a callout that saves your teammate.  Or for forcing attackers to spend two minutes dealing with your roam.  But those actions improve your chance to win just the same as if you had assisted on the kill or traded out your teammate's death.
---

---
The only thing that captures everything you do to help your team win is win percentage.   Over time, the random factors (luck, teammate quality, opponent quality) tend to even out and how often you win is determined by your performance (kills, callouts, gadget usage, etc).
---
No, you played multiple games with a cheater, on your team or against. It rolls back the games exactly, so unless you gain and lose 150&lt; elo it was multiple games.
---
Ps, closet cheater lol, ur guessing
---
And people still keep banning jackals like this ü§£üëé
---
actually my 60% hit comes from aiming off them, and miraculously hitting a hs
---
Crying
---
Yeah but those weren‚Äôt detected by batteleye, which isn‚Äôt even running on the console version. They were detected by Ubisoft themselves probably by looking at server crash data and combining that with their match data to find players who beyond a doubt stressed the servers they were playing in
---
please don't cry ;~;
---
Idk what you mean they are almost twins
---
Wayne how‚Äôre y-Good an-Well-No y-
---
Acceptfl4ck - Unranked during this game, been Diamond every season since Health.
---
VBlankJK - Unranked during this game, been Diamond every season since Health.
---
That's the problem bud. The new system stops nothing. The 1000MMR restriction only restricts people who are already Ranked, meaning someone who is currently Unranked but has been Diamond every season can still queue with and do all 10 placements  with 4 Copper 4's who are already Ranked.
---
Imagine the absolute terror
---
All I see is boosted P3s on your team lmfao.
---
It‚Äôs impossible to get all that from a single screenshot, we would need a (slow motion) video to see the moment he fired and if there were any server or connection issues at the time
---
Youre argument was that you need to be close which is risky but agree you should always be close if youre playing objective lol 
---
So either you do 2-5 pings, which any more than 2 EVER, which 2 is the LEAST likely of the tiers of pings given the time segments, which is annoying OR you can not track people down by footsteps and call out over teamchat. So if you have even basic communication skills, you can not ping and track all day and then ping when you know you can get 5 lol 
---
Yes it got slightly better but it was like going for terrible to bad lol 
---
I still think Jackal is broken and could have got a better rework.
---
I will still vote to ban Jackal and he is still worse than every other op pretty much.
---
You wanna main Jackal, go for it, I don‚Äôt really care lol 
---
You‚Äôre beind hard headed.
---
Yes it is not live yet, I know. 
---
It‚Äôs like Tachanka needs a rework too as no one uses him unless they‚Äôre playing for the memes lol
---
Yeah, because after he shot his collar bone area or shoulder OP could've moved the reticle on the head.
---
OP also didn't upload a video either. 
---
The point here is simple: you guys are gullible and don't understand hit detection in Siege.
---
Sorry I forgot I was expected to fucking look up everyone I see on the stat tracker.
---
I was initially pleased but making him a 2 armour and 2 speed means he  a valk without cams.
---
And the extra  speed...but he still needs to stand still to use his glasses.
---
# ü•á
---
No?
---
 Individual performance (other than that it makes it more/less likely you win) isn't a factor at all.
---
MMR  gain/loss is based on 3 things:  the outcome of the game (win and gain,  lose and lose), how likely that outcome was (based on the MMR of the  two teams), and your individual uncertainty value.  As you play more  matches within a season, beating weaker opponents and losing to stronger  ones, the algorithm becomes more certain you are placed correctly and  reduces the amount your MMR is updated by after each match.
---
If you are interested in more details (from official sources), I recommend:

He was literally banned the day after how is that guessing
---
Finka is underrated. She is literally a shit tier annoyance to have on your team.
---
Ubisoft's philosophy is that if a streamer doesn't like something, then no one should have it
---
Make the shotgun a primary but give it the 5% speed boost of pistols, on a 3 speed of course.
---
I'd play it, but I admit, that's subjective.
---
true
---
Nice
---
idk it just looked cool from pictures, not so much the one I made tho...
---
Minecraft be like:
---
I'm simply pointing out the issue with the current system that you weren't aware of because it's something the playerbase should know of so it gets fixed. You seem very angry and aggressive for no apparent reason.
---
I‚Äôm 30 I play on PS4. 
---
Ex CS and TF2 player pc player. Boy was controller a hard thing to get used too. Since my last console was Xbox original. Used to be heavy into PC master life. 
---
But yeah, RB6 is a fantastic game to come out. Really awesome take on tactical FPS SnD type. 
---
 
---
Super excited for new COD as well xD
---
I don‚Äôt really see any use for the second one. I would think ghosts have other gadgets that would make for a better ability in siege
---
[removed]
---
This would be perfectly ruined with a doc spawn peeking
---
Heck but now you deleted it :(
---
This is just typical plat masturbation
---
You have booty joke tickler this is clearly imbalanced
---
Why were 3 of them in White Hall lmao
---
Nice ace
---
Yes requeuing after a few minuites does resolve this, yes I'm only having this issue with the casual playlist.
---
Hey there Robert! This is something we are currently investigating. Could you answer some questions for me?  
---
* What is the name of your ISP (Internet Service Provider)?
---
* What datacenter are you currently connecting to? 
---
* Did you get an error message when you disconnected? (Example: 6-0x00001000 )
---
* What platform do you play Siege on? You can send me a message with your Ubisoft username if you do not feel comfortable sharing it publicly!
---
Well shit neither do I. How about a steam id instead so we can squad up and destroy some people
---
( ‚Ä¢\_‚Ä¢)&gt;‚åê‚ñ†-‚ñ†  (‚åê‚ñ†\_‚ñ†)
---
^(srsly I have no one to play with oh god oh fu)
---
thanks, now I have to masturbate and I'll be late for work
---
Something extremely similar just happened to me. It's so fucking annoying getting unavoidable abandon penalties for doing nothing wrong
---
Chomp
---
Great looking, but it's Jager.
---
Thank you for sharing! We are monitoring recent reports of long queue times with certain playlists. We appreciate that info!
---
Thanks! I'll make note of this a well. I appreciate the report!
---
Gave up the PC life. I don‚Äôt even have a PC that works. 
---
I work IT and kinda ruined my interest in computers. Consoles just work. No maintaining, fixing or issues for the most parts. 
---
Plus point and click got too easy and still is. 
---
I get more immersion with a controller. And the challenge is more satisfying for me now.
---
Though I‚Äôd always recommend building a PC.
---
Higher than plat but ur still bad.
---
ah yes another guy who don't use acog in every gun. you have the biggest brain out there
---
I totally agree I try to have fun and test out stuff but then these diamonds and plats keep going against me and make the game not fun
---
Game over man, game over!
---
Why
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRISS_KARD
---
This is what the kap40 was based on.
---
To be fair it is harder to get better when going against or playing with smurfs
---
**KRISS KARD**
---
The KRISS KARD (KRISS Automatic, Research &amp; Development) is a prototype of semi-automatic pistol being developed by KRISS USA (formerly Transformational Defense Industries (TDI)). It is chambered in .45 ACP, and utilizes the same Super V System as the KRISS Vector, but in a much smaller package to minimize recoil and muzzle rise. It will not have a blowback slide; instead it has a T-shaped cocking handle on the rear.

Eh, I've been in que far to long which is also why I avoid that mode now

I‚Äôm wet

And intrigued

But mostly ashamed

*zips up pants*

Shoot before you poot.

For fucks sake.

Been playing over 2 1/2 years and I only have like 5 Black Ice and only have the full set for Buck. 
---
Good for you though.
---
How come?
---
I've seen this since Velvet Shell? Year 2 season 1......
---
Yeah his gadget is straight trash
---
It‚Äôs been like this for 4 years lol. It‚Äôs just how it is. It can make headshots a little frustrating but it‚Äôs just how it is.
---
Understandable. To be fair, we‚Äôre all geniuses in retrospect; im sure I would‚Äôve done the same
---
I get that it‚Äôs been like this for 4 years. But they could still change it so that dying makes more sense than they shot you through a pixel and the bullet came out of their forehead.

The toxic Ranked star playerbase who only use mics to harass people when players like myself have been giving callouts the entire time üòÖ

You‚Äôre welcome! Glad to know that Ubi is listening

Hes a hacky boi

Take the shot? So waste two mags

Thank you üôå

Thank you sir

Why thank you my friend ü§ô

What‚Äôs wrong? If it‚Äôs only the fact that it‚Äôs barely not in the box who cares, you can still read the point.

Thank you pal üëã

Thanks for the suggestion. But a friend of mine said it‚Äôs my RAM (?) I‚Äôm no good with pc so I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing :)
---
please learn how to do the MVP animation.
---
Muzzle ACOG. I never run laser and never hip fire. If I was going to run holo it would be rare and only if I felt like playing hyper aggressive which I usually dont
---
For real bro kinda screwed me
---
Ok.
---
No, they hated him because he generalized all console players to be garbage.
---
These guys were constantly harassing me and putting me down because I was having a bad game despite half of them going 0 and 3. They made me feel like shit so I decided to post this.

I played with fluxee he was really toxic

Thx dude

Rule #4 and Rule #8
---
You must be so much fun at parties
---
same
---
Different games do it differently. I personally prefer non hitscan games and where you have to account for drop and travel like Tarkov or battlefield. You just have to accept it‚Äôs the way the game is and it won‚Äôt change. 
---
When I‚Äôm feeling like competitive shooters I‚Äôm stuck with siege or CS. And I prefer siege.
---
Love the DOOM music!
---
Your own fault pretty much.
---
I mean honestly this looks like a premium skin for a shitty free to play csgo clone. I agree there's a lot of shitty siege skins, but there's plenty of different stuff for everyone
---
Lol what happened
---
‚ÄúNo witch-hunting‚Äù
---
This chat started 106-86 days ago lol
---
Hey Ubisoft, pay this guy for the design and put it on the store pls
---
I hate you but I feel bad hating you.
---
Bearing 9is just tap only, smg 12 is hose and jiggle, and the smg 11 is just drag down FAST.
---
They‚Äôre internet trolls on a video game that like you said played worse than you did half the time. Try not to let it get to you or upset you. Just find a new lobby once the match is over or something
---
No offense but theres no proof , they dont even have a rff symbol in the post , and  reddit is not a personal army to witch hunt random players because someone tells us to . Plus this kinda ties into rule four of basically dont asuse people for shit you cannot prove
---
It be like that sometimes
---
Good ol mr president
---
Ewwwww, jogo dublado...
---
Will do, updated
---
Too much lmao
---
Not really something you see in ranked. But if it were me, I would use him to get enemies to run into a teamates sightlines. Just something to think about. Also. NEVER. ON. HOSTAGE. In ranked, you will get teamkilled.
---
F
---
lmao
---
You buy it ‚Äúin game‚Äù go to the store section and it should be under the box labeled digital content. They‚Äôll be some armor stuff but way at the bottom will be all the gemstone skins and the bundle above the individual skins. I‚Äôm personally a fan of the gold skin as it goes well with the pro league outfits!
---
I know bro. Never see him in rank. But your strat isn't it a little situational ?
---
"yo who the hell killed the furry" 
---
best words i've heard all day
---
Don‚Äôt care
---
Why didn‚Äôt you just leave the match?
---
fake, knife hit reg worked lol
---
Isn‚Äôt this against the subreddit rule of no memes?
---
No one gonna bring up the smg 12? Aight
---
Is there any possible way at all to somehow link my Uplay r6 to my steam account so I can use steam wallet?
---
I was trying to make a murder hole but I only had one hand on the controller cause I was eating
---
I love IQ with grenade
---
That‚Äôs what I thought I know the call out I just didn‚Äôt know if he need it or not
---
SMg-11 ain‚Äôt too hard to control on console.Gove it a few games and you will be good.
---
Now,the bearing and the SMg-12?
---
Fuck em.
---
/s?
---
Ranked
---
i cant tell. i rarely ever seen it get used by the operators that have it. Ela on the other hand, every good/smart one i ever ran into uses the shotgun over the SMG, and its too effective at midrange. based on recent stats, from what i remember, she was one of the only operators (if not the only one) that had a higher kd with the shotgun than SMG.
---
Yep
---
The last terrorist got stuck, so OP was able to replenish his barbed wire and reinforcements indefinitely from the supply crate as the round never ended, because the last terrorist was still alive.
---
Lol I had something similar happen earlier I peeked as thatcher headshot doc and then noticed slightly to the left a mozzie peaking and before I could move he dinked me.
---
This is not very Incredibles!
---
Hype, that's the key word, these companies like to hide their numbers so they can lie and no one shows the reality. So they can charge high on an abandoned game. That's why they want to abandon steam, because negative reviews hinder sales.
---
u/uqusas
---
Textbook example of why I don't really like highly competitive games usually like this. Turns people into assholes because of their inability to temper those things. Seems like anything that people feel like they can be esports leet pro breeds this kind of attitude and it sucks.
---
Hey me too!
---
Bitch
---
ANOTHER ONE. AHHHHH
---
I find the smg11 shoots with very little recoil and shake if u use an out o locker assigned to a mouse button
---
Absolutely not, this is how game modes die.
---
Wtf
---
*They said it could not be done. They were wrong.*
---
I'm gonna be real with you... you'll have to get a new account ubi hates going back on bans
---
Let's start with theres no way in hell that many people are playing unranked
---
Yeah probably, if you don't believe the Chinese government conspiracy theories. Why would you buy it there though
---
What in the hot crispy Kentucky finger licking good did i just watch.
---
Ubi confirmed that Uplay has double the Seige players that Steam does, it makes sense as it is cheaper there.
---
Hmmmm
---
It's all the damn stress. Seriously Luigi has the worst anxiety of any video game character I've ever seen.
---
though Maestro is italian for real
---
you could also directly buy it from ubisoft or laybe even steam
---
I got Black Ice for the P90, Aug A2, 417, MK1 9mm, and the p226 mk25. Took me 1300 hours.

I'm from Australia I use whips
---
Kill it with fire

Uh?

And he's only like high mid tier in Smash Ultimate.

I cannot physically upvote, for this post is at 666
---
Oh fuck off
---
Since no one has mentioned it: You can still get a bundle with black ice for the Super 90.
---
Id say the smg11 is like a rocket lifting off and the smg12 is the earth exploding
---
Pretty much as good as her gadget gets whenever she's played by randoms.
---
I thought we left all that troll channel crap back in 2012?
---
You gay, I‚Äôve only got 3 black ice. For the L85(happy bout that tho), fmg-9 and ak-12. Is tried then all just for the mp5 black ice
---
Do you have a whip like belt
---
Double Pummel Beatdown
---
&gt;He's just as much an operator as any other ops out there.
---
If you're telling me that recruit is as much an operator as hibana, then you need some water, son
---
Me and him were both having the same problem, I could only see the beginning for like 10 loops
---
Get ya friends to throw some matches and get bk down to you.
---
I would rather not be backfilled into an ongoing unranked game that is on 0-3 or even 3-0. That's a waste of time for me.
---
5m
---
Who told you that?
---
Why did I think that the balaclava was teeth for a sec?
---
As somebody who is a fucking sweat in ranked even I my friend is like silver or bronze I'll still play with them on a Smurf. I won't go xxtrihardXDxx.
---
This game is up to it's eyeballs in balance and gameplay and technical nags that will interfere with your attempts to play it competitively. I still love this game, but if you're running from one game cause the balance is frustrating you this is a sour destination to end up at. It's not balanced, there are characters that will show up in 95% of all your matches and others that are not worth playing at all. There is often a clear right and wrong gun and attachments to use. Some maps and objectives give favor to one team or the other. There is hackers, smurfs, boosters, and every few months a new major exploit seems to show up. The netcode is often considered questionable, the hitreg is often considered questionable.. The developers make slow progress to fix things and sometimes it goes backwards instead.
---
:D
---
Burst my bubble? Lol. What do you think why I said *"random"* and went on to explain my point further? It should be very obvious that I understand how the recoil system in CS works from what I said.
---
Of course the bullets go where you aim if you tap fire. Would be hilarious if not.
---
I have been playing for almost 2 years and haven't even gotten one. not kidding!
---
Lmao
---
That frost mat one was close.
---
Hats off for crediting the original author.

If you took that from Russian Badger's video, then I'd say m4.

Else, none.

Yeah jager should put his ads on the outside next time.

They took it out this season

Wow thanks for not letting me spawnpeek

Are...you in the 360 avatar creator?

He smokes off the door which forces the enemy to go a different direction where he set up a claymore
---
Oh I didn't notice, I thought he won by time ^^. Happy cake day btw
---
Look what the gadget kill challenge does to people
---
Thanks
---
I have an alternate account where I purchased no operators just so I can play recruit in unranked/ranked. Much fun. Especially when I confuse people in the lobby with my sorcery.
---
Nice play bro, that's exactly how cav is meant to be played,i have to get used to it though :/
---
A perfect interrogation and the team capitalized on it. Good to see.
---
Only concern would be is that people would pick glaz and ads to see if people are close to them which sounds broken
---
I know Rooks ability, but what‚Äôs Thatchers?
---
But even the damage isn't consistent. Sometimes I can blow them away with a single shot, but other times they don't even lose half their health before I get killed
---
Recently I got a phone call right at the beginning of bank. Didn‚Äôt wear headphones, didn‚Äôt know they were in basement, went through tunnel, got two kills. Sadly, I apparently play better without headphones

Emp grenade, gets rid of electronics such as jagers and bandit battery's to name a few

They work through walls and are great for allowing thermite/hibana to breach reinforcements

Question. How was glaz op pre-rework? I dont think i had ever even thought of pre-rework glaz as being op in the slightest.
---
Oh so he‚Äôs like the attackers mute in a way. That sounds good, thanks
---
Its a viable strategy. Saw it in pro league once
---
Hey, that's Thatcher's line!
---
Wait excuse me how the fuck
---
Not sure because I've never had a chance to use a real SVU, but on the internet it says the gun uses 7.62*54mmR catridges.
---
Doesn't this kind of produce the same effect?
---
If you're close to an emeny you'll most likely be moving about anyway. If you're far away you'll most likely be stationary holding a line of sight.

---
They won‚Äôt add it because they don‚Äôt want you to know how dead the game really is.
---
Perhaps not at Ranked levels since the weapon itself wasn't that good really, but in Pro League with a coordinated team Glaz was definitely broken.
---
There is a reason why it got reworked in the first place.
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt been playing siege for that long so I‚Äôm still not good. But I am trying to use more of a variety of ops
---
Sort of, he's just great at cleaning out defensive utility to allow an attack to get some ground. 
---
He does have some nuance aswell, knowing when to use a grenade and where is a massive part of it. Helped me learn a lot of tendencies that defences use
---
plasma pink is a legendary alpha pack item, so good luck
---
*Unranked - 227,332*
---
Waiting 10 minutes in queue and getting the same teammates and enemies each match may prove something different about unranked mode.
---
Press start to mount LMG
---
Yeah, just mean he shuts off electronics like mute
---
If you‚Äôre waiting for a respawn in rainbow 6 your ass needs a head CR to check for brain malfunction üòÇ
---
I guess thats fair. I dont watch pro league (almost never) so i cant really comment on that. Do you know if there are any videos on youtube or reddit that might show how powerful it was in pro league pre-rework?
---
For the most part mute jams them, thatcher gets rid of them outright, although they are moving away from this
---
Ubisoft works hard, latency works harder
---
Thanksgiving
---
damn, i can hear the song
---
I‚Äôm pretty bad at drawing so
---
Entry fraging is exactly the reason he got nerfed
---
7.62x54 makes perfect sense since it is a soviet round
---
I mean you aren‚Äôt wrong
---
&gt; you have to shoot them in the head multiple times before they die
---
Maybe it represents bad hitreg?
---
And there are people who don't even enjoy PvP in this game. So for them, TH is "the real game".
---
So you're admitting it's going to be ineffective.
---
Yes his scope's magnification makes it hard to use in CQC anyway, but it is possible when it's absolutely necessary. When it depends on range, using it in CQC is just not an option because your gadget simply doesn't work.
---
r/cursedimages
---
I hope they do that, your concept is really good
---
This comment made me fucking die thanks for that.
---
What's the problem? Free skin isn't good?
---
Why can't this be a real skin??? Oh that's right you don't work for Ubi. They're really missing out because this is awesome.
---
Looks amazing!!!

To me it seems like you ran out of arguments. If you want pve theres so many better shooters out there. If you don't want to do multiplayer, there is zero point in playing r6s. 
---
And in terms of hitreg, that's a retarded argument. Bad hitreg shouldn't even be a part of a game, let alone a feature.
---
I've gone through a list of assets in current maps that I can take inspiration from for my level creation and there aren't many I can go to, so I feel the casino may be the way forward
---
and what should ubisoft do?
---
Dont forget "Assholes who pick a class, then switches out at the last second"
---
You should make blocks red letters that say Blyat
---
GET DOWN!!
---
what‚Äôs the point of the thumb stick extender? How does it help? I‚Äôm genuinely curious, maybe I‚Äôll get one
---
Nice idea but I would have liked if he didn't have his weapon nerfed for real tho
---
I think they should've gave him back his awesome damage from the good old days instead of buffing his fire rate.
---
I agree with his scope nerf though.
---
you reinforced kids REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Should be a instant death countdown for people that do this.
---
Sure comrade
---
you go up to a black person and ask them if they think their ebonics and hot cheetos through a sensitive mic is annoying and they gonna give you an ear, or faceful. because that‚Äôs racist. same concept. 
---
this post literally screams mexicans annoy me when they have the mic on and everybody‚Äôs home. it‚Äôs casual racism.
---
How ppl are controlling the recoil pleat give tips
---
Russians don‚Äôt use 30-06
---
You‚Äôre the one assuming that they are Mexicans
---
I do think this will make him worse overall, but at least would feel consistent. I mean Glaz can‚Äôt get much value at range so having no banana vision until after makes it pointless overall. 
---
It would feel better though as you don‚Äôt keep seeing yellow then it going away, and then coming back, over the time they‚Äôre moving
---
Nice but Soviet Union symbol on helmet, upvoted
---
Omg
---
What a play
---
I think they should just undo what they did to him with this nerf, end also do the same thing with Warden.
---
I‚Äôm assuming he‚Äôs playing on an NA server by the way he types, so by proxy, the only spanish speaking people on an NA server would usually be a mexican, yes. or puerto rican, if anything which is an incredibly similar form of spanish.
---
Lmfao I guess u could call it that
---
I mean, the PMM is shooting 9*18mm which should by all means make it the weakest pistol in the game, so its pretty obvious that they're targeting balance over realism.
---
It's not really a strat.
---
Why not bonfire day?
---
I liked Glaz better before the banana scope.
---
Username maybe? idk could be a number of reasons
---
This such an amazing idea yet I think Ubisoft's execution of the idea won't work.
---
Mozzie is a beta male

If you deem it intentional they shouldn't be able to.

Is there a good way to practice defense ops too?
---
its high noon
---
Ig it is

Why you think he's got a shield? Can't have a deaf, blind, dumb guy with a fully auto weapon. Just wouldn't be responsible.
---
It's like 2 blind monkeys trying to fight around a tree
---
twitch gang rise up r/we_wana_fuck_twitch
---
don't get me wrong: the option to votekick a hacker or someone toxic is good... but if someone already has RFF active.. they shouldn't be able to start a votekick or vote in general....
---
You think they're morons for doing that, but at least they probably know how to take a fucking screencap.
---
Drunk fights are epic... ly slow
---
Make more operators plz this is cool
---
I find scoring/markers distracting in games.
---
If ur on PC I'm willing to test it with ya
---
Yes a bad skin on a single gun is the new nice skin that's on every vanilla and Y1S1 gun. /s
---
It‚Äôs not
---
There's a rumor that when PMM (actually, just PM before, M for modified) was adopted by USSR police and military somewhere around 1951, one unlucky military officer went home too early (bad habit, don't do that), found his wife having horizontal fun with another man and tried to kill them both using that sidearm. He wasted whole magazine, shot them both and both survived somehow. 
---
Truth or not, but PM(M) with 9\*18 while having greater "stopping power" is considered a lot "weaker" than it's predecessor Tokarev TT with those 7.62\*25.
---
Anyway, it's kinda funny that small PM(M) with 9\*18 has more damage in this game than sidearms with absolutely monstrous .45ACP or with .40SW, .44AMP . Realistic enough, I guess.
---

Can't you just put money on your steam wallet and then buy R6 points from that?

Yeah, Kyle something something. He plays for wildcard you should be able to find him in the links on the stickered post on this sub under his screen name.
---
Your holo hurts me
---
absolute mad lad
---
One kill
---
Nice to see you even structured them from left to right. xD
---
Yes, a 3 word comment saying the joke then you can be misread. I admit I could have interpreted it wrong but you did not help that at all. So yes you do need to grow up.
---
He wasn't last, that's why we still lost
---
His dmr buff is going to. He‚Äôs a sniper, snipers stay still. You shouldn‚Äôt be 5m away playing glaz. You‚Äôre playing him wrong then.
---
His glasses need to be like cavs silent step and works whilst moving
---
Nasty
---
well that makes sense i guess. if you dont have any of the characters whos the only one left to play?
---
Not physically
---
What did he say? It was removed
---
True but people said wtf and reported me what should I do if I get banned?
---
Exactly, that's why his scope doesn't have effect at 5m
---
Mount it.
---
He was broken in the hands of a pro, which is why they changed him to what he is now.  Now he can't simply walk into any room scoped and see people's feet before they can see him.
---
*happy Ash noises*
---
Nope. The way you buy r6 is by going through ubi, clicking shop on steam. But it doesn't send me to steam.
---
Star jump??
---
I'm not the one who reverted to insults though, you could have just asked politely and I could have explained.
---
Instead you decided to be a cock. So no, I don't need to grow up
---
So you‚Äôre gonna pretend like you don‚Äôt have to push into objective sometimes when playing as glaz? I‚Äôve gotten plenty of up close kills with him
---
Don‚Äôt talk to my dad ever again!
---
Thanks! I was skipping through the vid and can't see it,can you tell me where you see me do the thing where I dip down? Thanks
---
I have almost every black ice, I'm missing maybe 1-2
---
on your screen hatch was broken, server side it's not
---
And would you politely ask anything after being called a joke? I really don't think so...
---
No problem („ÜÅœâ„ÜÅ)
---
"The Perfect Glaz"
---
I mean now that you say that I'm starting to see. Really the most glaring issue is the mag well. I like how you managed to get the charging rod and main spring (though I think the charging handle is a little thicker).
---
The only problem with the MP9 (probably because use just used Clash's) is that in reality that's the wrong stock and idk if that's the suppress used with it. These things don't matter and probably would be different than the real thing if they added them to the game anyway. 
---
Can I recommend [imfdb.com](https://imfdb.com) as they tend to have more good quality pictures than Wikipedia (though Wikipedia tends to have more info).
---
it‚Äôs the internet imagine taking everything seriously
---
You are a toxic child.

---
I don't feel like you know what you said.
---
Neat
---
Did you try putting it in rice?
---
Haha I don't actually get spawn peaked because I'm not a noob. But people who do it are just sad and likely unskilled looking for cheap kills. (like yourself from the sounds of it)
---
I have, dipshit. 
---
How is less than an inch of drop at 30 meters significant?
---
How is a two inch deflection at 80 meters significant?
---
90% of gun fights in siege are within 10 meters. In what situation would bullet drop ever have significant effect?
---
A .45 drops about 17 inches. So flat.
---
I thought Doki was banned
---
So if they won 4 matches without getting kills this is either photoshopped or I‚Äôm not catching on
---
Console has especially braindead players like this. I haven't seen people like this on PC ever. And no I'm not calling all console players braindead.
---
damn you got nothin to say about it
---
homeless got himself 10 pcs from origin and got 10 r6s account searching for a ranked match at the same time and set the world record basically
---
He skipped
---
Lets hope nobody steal this picture for karma whoring
---
Hey OP . Put a watermark on this
---
In the mother fucking situation I laid out in my initial comment. When a douchebag snipes someone with a pistol from across the map. Moron. 9mm at 100m is 12in drop. .45acp at 100m is 17in.
---
If it makes you feel better my team never bans jackal
---
I guess u didn't read what I wrote.
---
They based him off Ben Shapiro
---
If you have R6 on steam, you both need to start it from there. If it's by uplay you need to do it by uplay. I had this problem, I hope it'll help
---
HE...

HE'S AN ILLUMINATI!

I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm unskilled necessarily, however, getting a few cheap kills here and there to tilt the opponents is always the best part.

Aw he's so excited. He and his buddies about to have a shield rush.

This
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Ah I see now, that's unfortunate
---
Looks like a miss / shoulder tap. Definetely not a headshot
---
Kind of a shame, since the F2000 appeared in both *Wildlands* as well as *Breakpoint* (this time as the SC-20K, a name from *Splinter Cell*). I had hoped some more weapons^* would make the leap to *Siege*, like Zofia's LMG-E.

i found that on day one and forgot to post it lmao

Could you answer some questions for me?

* What is your ISP's name?

* What datacenter are you connecting to?

True dat
---
She always had shield. They gave her camera
---
My proudest fap
---
It's console so less texture, less fov and add the fact that there's a high chance since he's on his couch he's not using headset, add that to the fact That he may be low level and u got the mix
---
i just saw that video holy shit thats amazing
---
All units, suspect has escaped. Hostage KIA.
---
What platform do you play Siege on? Have you checked in with [Ubisoft Support](https://support.ubi.com/Cases/New) yet?
---
I never understood how do people "sneak" or "hide" from players for just having Mira's shield in hand. Can someone explain? I don't own Mira sorry.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
if youve been playing since Y3 and your aim is still worse than controller aim youre doing something wrong
---
Just to clarify, you are queueing up for a match, you get the notification a match was found, but cancel the queue as you are getting the message, and then get the abandonment penalty?
---
Maybe you can put  a golden Lord Tachanka Statue in  a fontain. Man i wish i was a map dev on Ubi
---
No one probably knows that, cuz why would you pick them over smokes with his ability
---
&gt;This would never happen in pro league because mira would be banned

I wonder how Sha77e feels....
---
I cant remember how much this is all worth, I think its around 50 Pounds, I'm not sure since I havent boughten an elite recently but if i'm wrong just correct me.
---
LMFAO HIS NAME IS RANK IS EASY
---
you misspelled console player
---
I'm excited to see the finished product!! The sketch looks great :D
---
Him and Warden just both need reworked to have "thermal vision" that can be toggled on and off (and only last like 5 seconds on a CD). Period. That's it.
---
No complicated movement-based algorithms, or weird "different degrees of vibrant" or "you have to sit still to see through smoke".
---
They're both arguably the worst ops in the game right now. Giving them toggleable temporary "thermal vision" to see through smoke or other non-wall things would make them useful again. Can you imagine looking through a crack but unsure if it's a person or debris? Toggle thermal vision. If it lights up, take the shot. That's the dynamic we need for both of those operators. 
---
Having them both function the same would make warden a good pick, especially when the enemy might have a glaz.
---

Ahh I see, and why do people commonly use the Mira shield to "sneak"?
---
My guess is in between 22 - 25 Oct.
---
Taking Dokkaebi's and Finka's nades in order to give them to Nokk and Amaru would be an interesting change. Dokkaebi keeps her smokes, which fit her role, and Finka stays in a reasonable spot for a universal ability operator.

This happened to me as well although my WiFi has cut out in the loading screen
---
thats pretty ¬¢A$H MON‚Ç¨¬•
---
You just have to restart siege
---
Oh I'm well aware of that, problem is that it doesn't do anything to make it more consistent. It'll still jerk randomly away from what you're aiming, albeit less so, but still enough to make you miss completely.
---
Every operator has two gadgets, a primary (unique) gadget and a secondary (generic) gadget. Each operator only has one primary gadget, but a choice between two secondary gadgets, these being smoke grenades and breach charges for Fuze. Fuze's primary gadget is his Cluster Charge, so it does not show up in the inventory menu nor can it be replaced by another gadget.
---
I'm pretty sure unranked has it's own hidden MMR.
---
Wow that guy is fucking annoying.
---
there's an edd on the bottom right of the door, with the elite skin.

You can get even more if you tie the round on 4-4 but it requires a death.

At least i know its yours

Not by much

You can't tie anymore
---
Yes it does, i contested a secure area game for ir a whole minute into overtime earlier
---
upload the whole game so we know it's not staged
---
That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball!
---
yes but then glaz would be right back where he was. he got nerfed because he was too strong in pro league. he was too good at entry fragging, he could just smoke it out, clear the room, teammate gets the plant, and he covered defuser.
---
I am well aware that it is a video game. How would it be a waste of time? Are you a siege developer? Do you know how long it would take to implement? No. So fuck off and take your own medicine. Stop bitching. What an absolutely pointless chime in.
---
Sounds really far fetched and the fact that he cheated in general is sad.

I forgot how broken bb was
---
Jackal's getting claymore soon
---
no you saw better versions of it. this one is just a version someone else saw somewhere else and changed without putting any thought into it like how you have to tpose/plank until respawn and have no time to work out between rounds because of that
---
Yeah I feel that my guy
---
He means after he planted it, but it's still probably just so that he could see around the cabinet and not just be pushed all the way to the back.
---
Taking out a rectangular black thing wider than a doorway. I mean, I guess it covers the middle of mira's silhouette, but only if you consider the mirror a separate thing from mira.
---
Not really far fetched. The second the cheats are detected, the permaban kicks in and all the mmr will be taken/returned for every game that acct has played for the season I‚Äôm assuming. But yea definitely not his proudest moment

---
Why is jagers HP so low
---
I'm careful to watch the replay and it's unmistakable that it's mnk. The "stutter" of the aim after the kill is clearly them moving the mouse to the edge of the mouse mat numerous times. I accept there are many many times I'm shite, or they're brilliant players, but what I'm talking about is the ones that are obvious mnk and the rise in those players.
---
Which server?

His vision is based on movement

I think I forgot to increase the height lol

Are you real? Thank youüòÜ . I have also many other operators drawnüòá

yeah i am having the same issue for the last couple days i waited for 15 minutes and still could not find a game i play pc and am gold 1 and i usually try search for like 3 minutes and restart the search but still doesnt work forced to play casual if i want to warm up
---
He was continuing the joke, as you never see Mira in pro league since she gets banned all the time.
---
Was a completely different game back then. I hope they release an event or even something separate so I can go back and play again.
---
Indeed I'm real :P Which one is your favorite you've done so far?   
---
Have you done Ash? She's my favorite to play.
---
Ubisoft is retarted for making that possible
---
Adapters like the XIM Apex allow for the connection of mnk to console without the system detecting it as mnk.
---

Pretty useless if you die without using them and often unnecessary so no, they're not the best secondary gadget. Useful in many different ways Ubisoft did not account for, yeah, but if you bring 10 and nothing to slow the enemies down then y'all all getting killed. Just watch you don't blow up your teammates' gadgets like barbed wire when trying to nade someone reloading next to a doorway, behind a wall.
---
Nitro Cell is the same in a way. Sometimes it's very useful, sometimes you will die without using it at all, sometimes you will do nothing with it but cause destruction that helps the enemy. Kills with Nitro can be the cheapest way to turn the round in your favor though.
---
Barbed definitely isn't the best after all the nerfs, but it works great in certain places. Same for shields, they've become stronger, but have limited use. Same for the bulletproof cam, it can be strong, but has limited use.

I think secondary gadgets are pretty balanced at the moment, but impacts are definitely brought a ton more than they should be. Often times when you bring impacts instead of something else you hurt your team. 
---
Cav impacts make little to no sense since with how shitty her SMG and how good her shotgun is it's a no-contest choice, if you have the shotgun you might as well bring the cam and be useful.
---
Alibi and Maestro both have a secondary shotty. Impacts on them should almost never be brought unless for a very specific tactic, NEVER "just in case I need to yeet". Both barbed and shield are better in this situation.
---
Vigil's impacts make some sense I guess, but the cam is a good choice too, especially if you are running the BOSG.
---
Kaid given his limited ammo on the TCSG12 and how C4 doesn't combine with his kit at all makes some sense even though people will tell you it doesn't. Also works great for very specific holds that require you to impact trick.
---
To Clash, impacts are useless. There isn't a time that you can use them and 1 will not always make a good walkable hole for her. Barbed combines well with her being defenseless when she cannot slow down her opponents or bring them into crossfire with teammates, it's also good for covering her flanks.
---
Goyo - use C4, impacts, whatever. I prefer the C4 on him, but neither combine especially well with his shields. In theory you can remotely detonate your shields by using a preplaced C4, so there is that. C4 can also be used to create deadly vaults with his shield without exposing oneself, but that risks getting both destroyed very much. Same for Kapkan - use whatever, I prefer Nitro since he had it to begin with and impacts don't do much for him. They'd work much better on Frost, making deadly vaults, not an operator that can only trap doorways, making more ways to go around your traps is not the smartest idea, but impacts can still be useful on him.
---
Lesion I pretty much always use impacts, since cam is of little use to him, he already does a ton of intel. In the past shield used to be very good with him for the doorways, but impacts still usually a better choice.
---
Now that Rook has barbed - use it. Use it unless you need impacts for rotations. Just use barbed unless you really need impacts for rotations or tricking.
---
Castle has the camera and impacts and impacts actually combo very well with his barricades when you sometimes need to bring them down quickly, so impacts here most of the time, just like Lesion.
---
This is my stance on bringing impact nades and a bit on the other gadgets. Impact tricking is unarguably broken good at times, but impacts are not as versatile as most other gadgets I'd say, most usually 2 per squad will be more than enough, sometimes you shouldn't bring any if you have shotguns and no need of tricking, since there are more useful gadgets that can have an impact even when you're dead or one that can get (potentially) easy kills - Nitro Cell.
---
Yeah it is, it‚Äôs just a general piece of music you can hear during Ember Rise
---
Thank you

You can win without kills by letting if you have the defuser planted and running out after your team dies.
---
Really, how sensitive is everyone that I can‚Äôt say only on Xbox
---
Alright, add my psn: xFvnta
---
Huh, I didn‚Äôt know that! Thanks for telling me that, makes me wonder what other stuff I didn‚Äôt hear.
---
It‚Äôs called recoil control.
---
Why are these clips always on console tho lol. it's too perfect
---
My sens is almost identical to OPs.  The reason I keep mine so far apart is because the movement caused by the low V and High H is very similar to PC's movement.  Idk if thats why OP does it, but its what works for me having played both platforms.
---
Buy a console
---
ty for this üòÇ
---
I have done Bandit, Glaz proleague, J√§ger elite, Kaplan, Rook ,Doc, Ela,Valkyrie, Tachanka , Mozzie, Hibana and now Warden :D. No ash sadly :/. I like bandit because i made him calmy eyes.
---
I agree. Not a fan tbh. But that's ok.
---

Thanks i hate it
---
Thx for all of your help I think I will go with nomad I am a big fan on the rook pop and I can control that recoil I think I can control nomads
---
Copper 5 be like
---
it‚Äôs literally the most difficult to control, are you kidding? you ever fired an A10 warthog from your hand?
---
bucks recoil is easier. vector recoil is immensely easier. i might say the F2 is easier but i don‚Äôt play twitch. just because it‚Äôs easy for you doesn‚Äôt make it easy for other people, and I‚Äôm assuming since it has the highest fire rate in the game, most have problems with it on console.
---
Rebuttal about not checking before posting
---
its from my smartphone because I just had to send this in our rainbow whatsapp group
---
Bruh you can't even spell.
---
Try the smg 12. Have you every tried the smg 11 anyways?
---
Wave good bye to your knee caps, chuckleheads
---
and originally from the share button at ps4
---
Sadly I can say I‚Äôve done and successfully have done this in
---
Because people like you react like this.
---
Still bothers me when I check rooms. I'm like nothing in here. Dead. Dirt bike helmet. There is a room on the bottom floor of favala with ten helmets on a rack. His perfect camo
---
i‚Äôve tried both plenty, yes. 12 less since i don‚Äôt play vigil or dokk much. used to be a smoke main though, so if that says anything
---
New profile pic
---
I want to know why you blew it though
---
Make a pot of coffee and reset the queue every 5 minutes. Bring something to read.
---
He lost his shins in ww2.
---
Wow so quick-witted... thats all u got ? Ur NA brain must be very small (keep downvoting me losers, u think I actually care haha)
---
As I watched this, Durude Sandstorm played by a Kazoo was playing in my mind
---
If you actually didn't care, you wouldn't say that you didn't care. Someone has something to prove.
---
Have you ever taken the time to just practice the smg 11 recoil ever? 1 minute is all you need to master it.
---
r/neverbrokeabone
---
It‚Äôs a team game, not a cod game
---
did you read my reply? smoke main... had plenty of time to get it right...? doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs still not the worst recoil?
---
Non related question, but there are any leaks of S04 operators/gadgets?
---
D E T A I L S
---
*just click on em bro*
---
You are too powerful and must be eliminated
---
I've seen enough internet to see where this is going.
---
Yeah, totally agree!
---
slithering and slethering around like a boss
---
I could agree with the smaller maps. At least 2 more would be nice. The large maps can be a little overwhelming on days when you just want to relax (Bank). But as far as the 2v2 goes, wouldn‚Äôt custom game be the same thing? Or were you thinking more of a specialized online experience?
---
tea would be nice to see if unranked or casual is faster
---
You sure?
---
So warden?
---
Cause rogue 9 made it a meme
---
I saw a full gang. Ela wanted to play gweent
---
no pc on earth could handle that
---
when the spookrober is draging you down
---
A commin duplicate, im afraid.
---
We were doing shotguns only , I‚Äôm not that bad
---
That's what I thought. He didn't test it?
---
Nope lmao
---
lol greed, you know this game once the proper BP launches will have more microtransactions than some F2P games?
---
Believe it or not , but I was playing with a full squad of plat 3s/2 s

I‚Äôm pissed they took Kaids barbed wire, let me and bandit make the floor electric dammit
---
its really what you said: an simulation in vr in order to train. not used by the army but by r6 but whatever.
---
That's surprising
---
It stops boosting, be thankful

This would be helpful -- if it was the elite.

Or you just stand outside big garage below the window, aim upwards and voila!, there goes the welcome mat.
---
It punishes people for being sloppy
---
I thought it was pretty cool but then I saw the BOSG... oh lawd
---
When people ask why those on console get made fun of, show them this video.
---
Lion be like "I wonder where the last enemy is ?" ü§î
---
Only console players would do that
---
Probably because Turtle Beaches are overpriced garbage that only sell well because of the name. They're basically the Beats of the gaming headset world.
---
And why are the CTU‚Äòs fighting other CTU‚Äòs? Doesn‚Äôt that make the other CTU‚Äòs terrorists? They‚Äôve become what they swore to destroy! 
---
And on both sides speaks the same announcer, maybe he‚Äôs the real enemy? 
---
To be honest, rainbow is one of the more realistic shooters I‚Äôve played, even tho many things that happen are questionable. I like that there‚Äôs Team damage, I‚Äôm not abusing it and so aren‚Äôt many other people I‚Äôm playing with and I play a lot of siege, without team damage something would miss and would ruin the game a bit, for example the enemy team is capturing the objective, while fuze is outside and keeps fuzing, you can‚Äôt take care of the enemy team and they capture the objective fuze‚Äòs grenades keep them covered.
---
Or the whole defender team would hide in smoke‚Äòs smoke
---
You dont need much for gold
---
Ur clean bro

I use that for melee
---
Very Sneaky..
---
Cuz it ain't Call of Booty brother
---
I see now

Suprised no one shot him through the drone hole
---
Its fun
---
Why does this give off really lewd vibes despite not an ounce of nudity
---
Yeah but this is a new instance of it, and as far as I know, nobody pointed it out.
---
Lol
