I feel you bro ;(

To clarify:

Xbox - yes

PS4 - no
---
PC - no

Maestro if ur going for year 3s but I’m assuming you already have him so definitely finks , she brings more to the team than nomad can , nomad is just an operator with an underwhelming ability that helps with fragging but her guns aren’t great 
---
Oh it happens. I've seen it.
---
Jesus, I give up after 5 minutes
---
No that’s just an issue with the killcams. They were seeing the same as u
---
She is part of a CTU, proactively fighting terrorism, it wouldn't be too surprising, and then you also consider her age, and the fact that some people have different genes so their hands may look old (I'm actually one of those people, for being in my late teens). And I've seen them myself in game and... They honestly, really doesn't look that bad.
---
Name checks out.
---
Not needed though
---
Clip of the year.
---
you're the shittiest mirror of them all
---
no
---
Who even needs synchronized debris when you can have this? #makebarricadesgreatagain
---
Ikr ): 
---
You're such a dick.
---
Hit it up lone wolf. Then you can practice without four other people getting all of the kills
---
I'm deffo a Lesion main. He just speaks to me.
---
Actually was needed you fucker
---
You should be proud
---
Thats logical and all, but you have to consider what it looks like when shes got the default skin on. Her hands look slimmer and younger and generally more feminine. I think they really just botched it on this one :( so sad cause I love the rest of the skin. 
---
You don't get the AP boost and R6 credits though
---
Ok good to know. 
---
This is what happens when you peek to much
---
If it does not have Lesions icon on the bottom of the shoe its pointless.
---
Good to know. 
---
Ok what is g2a?
---
The lord must not change
---
How does the killcam look like? :Think:
---
my crouch walking screwed me
---
@blackman
---
I know bud, I'm wondering why it's happening so often
---
The fact that people have been abusing Xim M&amp;K for an edge on controller players since at least 360 days without a word or legal call for it to stop by MS, likely means that there is financial means people are unaware of.
---

---
Even if developers enable use of real M&amp;K in their games, they'd separate by control interface for fairness and people would still use the Xim or pirated gear to have an advantage on controller users.  Not shocking when tons of players abuse anything they can every time they can.
---
With all the issues this game has with hit reg, sync, debris, global gadgets, movement spam, peeker advantage, and such, I wouldn't be betting on Ubi to handle an issue like this anytime soon.
---
No can confirm all shield, and try to step back a bit for knife, the shield Ops have a shorter melee range. Just a tip from a blitz main himself
---
This game calls for help. End his suffering eith Operation Health 2
---
YOU FUCKING MUPPET
---
I know the tachanka bit is a joke, but there are operator interactions in outbreak that could be considered flavor material-- give you a better idea of who the characters are.
---
Nowadays, is anything consistent? I get it, its not appealing, and you have to look at her hands every time you play the character, but, at the end of the day, it's just a skin, and Ubisoft has other important matters to attend to that fixing a few fingers... But you never know, somethings a fixed and unannounced at the start of each season... If it bothers you that much, maybe wait until Operation Burnt Horizon
---
I wasn’t aware that this was an issue on Xbox 360!! I thought it was a newish trend.
---
gotta be sneakin' around, aren't ya?
---
Need help on Xbox. Can anyone help? 
---
I noticed vigil got yinged lioned and jackal tracked at the same time.....
---
Blackbeard is a pretty toxic operator though
---
Creepy frost plays

Fair enough

Can't substitute a defender ban for an attacker 
---
Lol, people these days. I grew up playing Halo 2 and teabagging wasn’t toxic, it’s the way of life. You do something cool, you teabag. If you think teabagging is toxic you really need to get some thicker skin
---
You can never go wrong with Thatcher, Rook, Doc, Jager, Lesion, Jackal, Valk, Kaid or Hibana. They’re always a good pick on any map. The most important thing is knowing the maps and call outs.
---
There is already some kind of hidden hp you get which gradually goes down as you bleed it. This is why things like Prismas and Black Eyes can take a few hits to kill some enemies.

A boomerang shooting weapon would be the best thing ubi could add for australians

Added Mute to defence

Nah that's just bc Blitz is bad

They had no idea what they were doing

Hes not that bad. If you have trouble just play an Op with a high ROF like Bandit and keep aiming for the head
---
None are directly better but buck has a similar gadget as well has a stronger rifle compared to sledge though doesn't have the SMG 11
---
Grats and hopefully many more! I got my first on consulate I think don't remember it that much. Yesterday I got an Ace in a 5v1 knife fight was pretty cool that the other team held true and didn't gun me down.
---
Open mic... but most of all the ones that call me trash while I'm trying to clutch

This is some Star Wars force type shit
---
You use a boomerang to disable drones, then hack them.

Huh? He has the Y1, Y2, Y3 ops. Isn't that worth like three season passes alone? I don't remember season passes being $3
---
That’s what a undercover Ubisoft worker would say

I'm going with Hydrogen Chloride.

Blitz OP
---
How do you get the tags for your main operator?
---
Could've gone Doc.
---
You are acting as if we're not interested in dealing with toxicity as a whole, only when it affects women.
---
&gt;the woman(there, is that better?) in that video was saying all sorts of very mean things to that guy on a personal level
---
I'll watch it soon, but taking your word for it, she sounds toxic AF and definitively deserves punishment for that.
---
BTW, yes, it is. A woman is a female member of the human species → Woman = Female + Human → Female = Woman - Human. At least, when you use it as a noun, not an adjective. "A female nurse stitched me" is completely fine. "A female gave me water" is not. It's a bit of an exaggeration, obviously, but you get the point. 
---
&gt;Are you suggesting that because you're picked on for being a trans female that it's somehow worse than being called ugly, or fat, or buck toothed
---
It's not a matter of "better" or "worse". It's a matter that I (and about 50% of the population) can't help being women. We can't change that. And it's immediately apparent when we go on voice comms - we're instantly identified as women (or, in my case, since I haven't trained my voice well enough, trans woman). Being ugly or fat isn't something you can identify from voice alone. Being buck toothed could affect your voice, so yeah, I imagine it must suck. The thing is, and here's the kicker: *we are targeted not by our actions, but our existence.*
---
&gt; No one should be picked on for any reason at all 
---
And here I fully, completely, 110% agree with you. Toxicity has no place in games, or anywhere for that matter. Even if it is "justified" (a piss poor play, like say, accidentally fuzing the hostage). What I do disagree with is that bringing up specific forms of toxicity does a disservice to the fight. 
---
There's a concept I've learned in programming called "divide and conquer" (wow, such an innovative and groundbreaking concept! /s). If we split the "Toxicity Monolith" into the several ways it presents itself (one of which being misogyny), and combat those specifically, we're bound to get better results. Because much like anything in life, there's no way to tackle broad problems with a single tool. You wouldn't expect to build an entire house with just a single screwdriver, would you?
---
There are a significant number of ways people can be toxic, and we'd have an easier time handling those if we combat them specifically. 
---
PS: that video has really low sound! 
---
I got to be the same a while back so I left the game for about 3 weeks and when I came back I was better than ever. Sometimes you get too deep into it and end up burning yourself out hard.
---
Congrats! I played against macie earlier too on bank. We were defending basement and he rushed through garage and knifed 3 of us while we were preoccupied by a plant from Server room. 
---
Yes buy the game now, it's on sale rn: https://store.ubi.com/us/tom-clancys-rainbow-six--siege-complete-edition/5a74872229e123bf13fea7ec.html?lang=en_US
---
Also if you're on pc in North America I'd be down to show you around 
---
Never nerf recoil. I’d always take damage nerf over recoil.
---
Heard acogs suck nuts on console 
---
It’s an extra 1-2 bullets at range. Not insignificant.
---
sorry pal, its your day off... 
---
Unless they have any vertical destruction 
---
I love hearing the C4 exploding in the distance
---
Recoils not that bad tbh :/
---
not, i made it.
---
Legendary?
---
Can somebody link me all of the menu backgrounds? My controller broke and I haven't gotten to playing Siege since the Invitational weekends came in.
---
Its honestly decent. But dat spread....
---
But what if it had an effect of the circle that slowly runs put while you’re knocked?
---
Your team has 5 roamers including you. Do you stay Cav?

Playing ranked. 
---
Sometimes some things have bigger sales then others. Happens all the time.
---
Dude I have 1300 hours in or something and I don’t have all but that’s great dude 🤙🤙
---
The recruit shield strat is awesome
---
I understand this is good, it’s actually great! The thing is, people who do not know much of the game or someone who doesn’t know the difference between the starter edition may accidentally buy the starter thinking it is better. Why would you sell the worse edition for more? When does that ever make sense?
---
Everything you just said I agree with, even regarding the semantics of referring to women as women(grammatically speaking you are correct). So I'm not really sure why we are arguing? If it is an objective to cut down on toxicity of all kinds then I have no quarrel with you, it's fine if we bring up mysoginistic toxicity as long as we acknowledge that it's not the only form of toxicity or that it somehow is worse than others.
---
Shhh he's waiting for someone to give him gold
---
You okay? You wanna talk about it?
---
What’s your psn?
---
sometimes some items have bigger sale percentages then others. It literally happens all the time.
---
This would be sick! Defenders have to hold a line "small building" while attackers retreat and make a path!

Dats tough
---
Yeah, he doesn’t need a nerf. Though maybe a change wouldn’t be bad. Like making the area off effect of the torch be bigger.
---
You mean you FINALLY found some teamwork...
---
If by "expensive edition" you mean "standard" - it came with 21/45 of the operators, meaning you'd only need ~15hrs of playing to get to half.
---
I unlocked every character after about 300hrs on standard edition.
---
You either did not buy the "expensive version", or have wayyyy more than half, buddy.
---
Then let's agree to agree! o/

I get tk just picking Ela and get weird messages (Xbox) but I laugh it off sadly
---
i guess so
---
The issue isn’t really the sound (even though it’s super annoying), it’s the fact he has no counters. Pick Bandit or Kaid, he can still open it. What’s the point. 
---
He breaks the game and the concept of defending just because of his gadget. One small peak hole can clear an entire room because it’s too risky. 
---
Any safe area that has reinforcements, as well as something to prevent breaching on that reinforcement should ALWAYS be cover, unless opened by a loud Hibana or Thermite charge
---
They should just revert to the old way barricades broke where the debris was forced outside/away from the window/door
---
Oh i dont crouchspam either, i genuinely teabag when its deserved
---
Happy cakeday
---
Mute them and report for toxicity, and if they are being really toxic leave.
---
This is like hyper realistic and I’m flipping my shit because it looks so good 
---
well people definitely know when they see the sale price, one is normally $39.99 and one is $14.99 it says it. It's just because things get different sale prices notices sometimes things are 10% off sometimes 90% its just a sale price is all
---
Claymores are so fun though.
---
Because you broke the glass whilst shooting, the game kinda messes up in the kill cam and shows it already broke/shattered. The other players will have seen what you saw 
---
I played some Clash in casual solo queue and was pleasantly surprised that my teammates capitalized on my stuns. Most teamwork I’ve seen solo queuing (over level 100 btw).
---
And what should i Say??? 
---
F
---
What does SSD stand for
---
Because they saw it in proleague.
---
Same as lion often being banned in SI.
---
Starter edition doesnt have all the basic ops unlocked
---
DETAILS 
---
He also wasn't acting like it was. Level 100 is roughly 300 hours or so in the game. Long enough to say "after all this time in game, X happened."
---
These comments are the most pointless flexes.
---
Get this man to the front page. This needs to be fixed.
---
If I want a break from a game I play something else. Right now I am bouncing between R6, Destiny 2, Forza Horizon 4, and Red Dead Redemption 2.
---
You can't use mouse and keyboard on most PS4 games, especially multiplayer ones, without purchasing a 3rd party adapter. 
---
There’s not really much Sony could do it’s linked to your Ubisoft account not your psn that’s why it works for fortnite because it’s linked to you epic games account and not your psn 
---
Fuck that. I bought starter day 1 and just got complete this lunar sale for $32. I only had 8 ops (had 7 hours in two years). Now I have 40 hours.
---
I bought it 4 days ago. Addicted. I'm not too bad either its surprising. I recommend buying it. Ny 2 griefs are it seems like when people in my team leave they don't get backfilled, but the enemies team does lol. Also occasional "x gamer tag you suck", but that's coming from someone who's dead spectating someone alive so who cares. 
---
when are they going on sale?
---
You have a problem enough to voice your disapproving opinion on a form that never asked for it. That's enough to conclude you wanting to shame someone for the ops they pick, which are in the game and part of its meta. 
---
You feeling the need to jump in and provide nothing to the original post is enough to show me your bias and bitterness towards ops you (in all your importance) disapprove of.
---
You play with newbs?
---
Yea I see your point but I still think he’s in a good place , I don’t think he deserves a nerf just because people play him in a selfish way 
---
Kap or Cap. Kapkan has a shit gadget and mediocre at best weapons. Cap has good weapons and a good gadget.
---
That is one W I D E screen goddamn
---
That is fucking awesome 
---
Each original op is 12 500 renown, season ops are 25k. This version is a pain in the ass and is only for pc I think 
---
"EREREGHHGH THE GAME IS PERFECTLY FINE GUYSSSS, LOOK AT THE GRAPHS THERE ARE 7 GORRILION MORE PLAYERS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR THAT IS GOOD RIGHT ????"
---
Snake strat work all the time in casual at least 1 of every five games
---
I like showing new people how to play the game 
---
Same, each season i just keep my renown for the next season's ops. easier than paying for a season pass. Most of  the seasonal skins are ass now anyway, have been for a while.
---
I think you should’ve done a fast fade transition for the beginning, it feels a bit too abrupt. Other than that it’s pretty cool
---
All I'm saying is that I wanted to know who else to consider and all I got were people wanting to tear me down for who I already used.
---
I'm not trying to start anything, but I posted for an honest response and got nothing but looks down other people's noses.
---
If you want to suggest ops that you use and I should consider, I'd be happy to hear about it.
---
Why do you think people buy it? 
---
Ok?
---
You clearly missed every shot try changing your aspect ratio to 420x69
---
Actually tho
---
I have a 2080 at 1080p ultra with an r5 1600x and I get 160-180 capped to 144
---
Well it’s not only that it’s just he has a strong weapon with an acog on it, which it’s not the damage it’s the recoil. I think if people are leaning towards roaming with him then they should take the acog off the mp5 and put it only on the p90. 
---
Yeah you're right I'll keep that in mind for my next project
---
Jager amibo? Possible smash character?
---
Hibana the old timer 
---
Not grinding if youre just playing the game, especially considering the fact that they havent been released
---
I actually bought it, the first thing that I thought was that grinding would not be that hard but I was wrong. Since this version has the complete game without a lot of ops I thought it was a good price. I learned that is not a good option
---
I'm confused by this, why would I play a game and not try to win? That's literally the whole point.
---
"Good round good round" that guy is a legend
---
There's a contractual agreement between devs and Sony that Sony have control over their player's data. If Ubi turned on cross-progression they'd be sued.
---
I only noticed it after I recorded it lmao
---
You mean road to S.I.?
---
Yes, or a sexy sounding 12 year old boy.
---
What is brightness 
---
*leans 2 meters to the left*
---
I mean, I don’t know if we need the extra hp indicator. It could be confusing. See armor doesn’t really give you extra hp it just helps mitigate damage. You know it’s working if you don’t get headshot and you go into down but not out.
---
&gt; This doesn't make sense. The game is supposed to be played in the manner the game permits.
---
Therefore the people using the new game rules, bans the above operators. Since "the game permits"  banning operators in the SI mode 
---
How?
---
yeah, i don't enjoy normal operator lean spam, in fact i want it toned down, but shield lean spam is on another level just so much worse because you can't just aim for the head.
---
Yes
---
Blitz...krieg. And then Stalingrad happened.
---
Yeah but he is a slow operator so the best way to roam with him is to stay relatively close to obj otherwise you’re just using him improperly, like you said he makes a lot of noise so it shouldn’t be too hard for players to tell when he’s coming by . They could probably recoil nerf him but I think that would make their pick rate drop drastically . I like to think Ubisoft tries to balance out operators not break them completely so they have to figure out a way to balance him out, even tho I personally think he’s pretty balanced already 
---
Was lowkey hoping for a castle scream too
---
I didnt say I was against banning, I said I wanted to hear about other good operators. 
---
I am the one wanting to adapt to the new rules and be prepared for the change.
---
Do you have any useful suggestions?
---
Wasn’t that glitch fixed in Chimera?
---
*notices a plummeting dokkaebi in the round ended cam*
---
That still seems very high considering you have servers relatively close. You could lookup how to run a ping test on your computer. Basically you type in a very simple command prompt message and you can tell it to repeat the test 10,000 times (~2hrs). Once it's done, it will tell you what your average ping is and how many times you've experienced packet loss. I typically use Google's  address (8.8.8.8) because or how simple it is to remember. This helped me identify an issue with my ISP in the past where they had to come drop new lines due to corrosion. A perfectly "healthy" connection should have no packet loss, but a couple wouldn't necessarily mean much. If you have a lot or consistently high ping, it would suggest a probably independent of ubi. If it comes back just fine, it would suggest it was likely ubi.

Nah you should probably just leave Reddit while you have a chance, it's really a terrible place.

my dear god thats pretty good
---
You mean shield team 6?
---
That's cause Finnish like the red headed step child of European linguistics; Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian are all common ancestors of each-other. Norwegian being their "parent" so to speak. Icelandic and Norwegian both share a common ancestor as well - Old Norse. Think of this like Great, Great, Great Grandpa. But because of that distance it's hard to tell they're related.
---
Finnish, of course, isn't related to any of it's neighboring languages (besides the obvious ones: Estonian and Karelian) like Russian, and the other Scandinavians. It is its own branch called the Finnic-Uralic branch. Then the Swedes and English had to fuck it all up by introducing their dirty non-Finnish words complicating the whole system. But the cool thing is the "old Finnish" words still exist and you won't sound like a mad-man like you would in English. So in theory you could speak untainted Finnish. It's just less common.
---
2 of his shots near the end were right on, regardless of aim punch his reticle wasn’t above his head for either of the shots 
---
SPECTRE would like to know your location

Nerf. He is nothing without his ACOG. Also these posts are so annoying, quite with the spam.

Ddos most likely
---
It's because it's not focusing based on the objects distance from the camera. It's basically blurring everything except the center of the shot.
---
Wait is that a StarCraft reference, and also he didn't make this, it's a cinematic in the game
---
Thanks!
---
My guy does NOT know how to fire single shots
---
Got mine in 2 games. Those were the most intense matches I had.

If that is a telephoto then he needs to back the fuck up lol

I've lost from that. It was a while ago though

Because then you wouldn't have anyone to matchmake with. People will falsely report others they perceive as bad.

INTO THE MOTHERLAND! THE GERMAN ARMY MARCH! BROTHERS, SIDE BY SIDE. TO STOP THE NAZI CHARGE! 
---
You copper as hell 
---
This has been happening to me too. I have 9 ping consistently and then out of nowhere my ping goes to 3000 and I get kicked. I've tested other games, and rainbow six is the ONLY one that spikes ping. Every other game runs fine. Additionally I check my internet speed regularly and it is not changing when my ping spikes. Rainbow is just not letting me play for some reason. Oh and connected through Ethernet.
---
Don’t be worried. I’m around level 126 and I feel like I have just entered a period where I am starting to get comfortable in this game. I’m sure your skill is not reflected in your rank, it rarely does at that level. Just keep on trying your best. Do terrorist hunt before you play, settle for nothing but headshots on the bots. Use comms and find a team you have fun with and can win games alongside. I have a feeling you’re going to start having a lot more fun and improve your game significantly if you do.
---
Ur gey 
---
I came here to say that, dammit! Oh well. Take your updoot.
---
Then just don't say it's a repost. No one forced you to say it, but if you want to say it, just check next time.

Well she doesn't have a hit box.

Yes it is, lol I was referencing this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7pVSqfCFps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7pVSqfCFps)

Friend: "Did you know we can vote ban another op?"

Me: "Oh really?"

****Vote kick initiated***
---
Yes this person is taking credit for a situation cinematic
---
Yeah no. You buy a game full price and then you're expected to just dish out more dollars to make up for imbalance created by additional characters? That's a bloody joke - this game is still selling for close to full price almost 3 years later. That has no other reasons than greed. "Pride and accomplishment" à la Ubisoft. There are reputable companies who have provided far bigger updates for free, there is no excuse for this bullshit.

I main him and smog but sledge is good to start transitioning in to faster ops

Also building a PC from the bottom up can be expensive, unless you go for minimum specs.
---
on the scimitar pro its better to do keys across from each other (like 10 and 12) since you can roll your thumb left and right to them but you have to forcibly click the middle button (such as 11)
---
I dunno if it's just the difference between PC and console, but I was insanely good back in the mw/mw2/black ops days. MW4 though? Not even close. 
---
Which is weird because I was also really good at BF2 and Bad Company 2 on PC. I really don't want to admit it might be because I'm getting old.

My god the panic and chaos. It's beautiful

I got my last one yesterday too!! Feelsgoodman

Whats impressive is that he shot you

Hyped for the operator with the cat ears, gonna be broken in pro league.
---
The way they move and aim is completely different. Mnk users often have an easier time tracking an enemie while moving, while controller users generally need to do a combination of strafing and horizontal aiming to keep their enemy in sight. Mnk users will also have a slight wobble to their reticle that's pretty much impossible to reproduce on an analogue stick. 
---
I would say then that if you are TK'ed let you should be able to leave no issue. but this brings about a whole host of new ways to abuse it so that's a no there aswell

Not to mention fucking *carrying it around on his back for the entire round*

His back must be strong as steel
---
Aight im glad I wasn’t just being dumb
---
I agree
---
Ok I was just curious since people have thought I was an mnk user 
---
Yeah this game with hitreq and ping really doesn't make sense like if you go play in a different region your ping is going affect your ability to kill because of the delay yet others with like 200 ping seems to benefit them and hurt the native the most sometimes. Also, 9 ping to 20-50 ping shouldn't really affect hitreq but this game is wonky; like all you can see is their head you see blood they don't die and you do; sometimes they don't even take damage. Still don't get how blood can register find with hits but not damage.

Depending on what mouse you have you should be able to open your mouse settings software and fiddle with the DPI to get a more precise setting. More DPI = higher sensitivity.

The fuck did I just watch?
---
Where were these people this morning. Couldn’t even win a match in casual.
---
Fucking sweatfest.
---
What was that (plz no bully im new to seige)
---
Same, its not unexplained its stupid kids that bought the game cause its so cheap now and don't really care about the consequences since it would take a lot to get ban.
---
Well done! Going for this myself right now; I was going to buy them but where's the sense of achievement in that? 😁 Have a wonderful day! 
---
I don't know had 1 guy mess around with a group of 4 costing us an easy win.
---
"Just play in a very small area and get good."
---
according to r6tap hes also an Ash and Jager main. Has like no time on Blitz, you mustve scarred him

Honestly besides grouping up with one person, just record all the teamkills and submit it to ubisoft to get them ban/suspended.

Man from owning this game. This video makes me want to buy it again XD

What? A fortnite player cant browse rainbow6 subs? And you ask why hes toxic.
---
Turn down your brightness please
---
Im mid west but still willing to play
---
yeah fuck people for having hobbies haha
---
Kupa. We played with you like a single night and then my friend got off angry
---
It is stupid I agree. Casual itself needs a complete overhaul to make it less toxic and more focused on the actual competitive aspects of this game like picking spawns and certain ops for certain objectives. What you suggested is a good start to what a forgive/punish system could look like. 
---
I’m glad you enjoyed it and I hope it made your day a bit brighter!
---
almost a great loop... 
---
*stares in disbelief*
---
I’ll tell ya this. I almost posted the same thing a week ago, and was very hesitant to purchase this game. I pulled the trigger and so far I’m having more fun than I’ve ever had playing a game. Can be frustrating, but also intense and crazy satisfying. Worth it for sure, I’ve been playing every night for hours 
---
This game needs to start making some serious changes. They need to start thinking about maybe even making a Siege 2 because right now the game is not in good shape.
---
Ah fair enough, I didn’t really think about the expense. Seems like the main reason is just to make it easy! Must get boring man. One of the best things about this game is the learning curve, the mnk probs takes most of that out!! 
---
Watching her body flying out the window was satisfying to watch. 
---
Was hoping for a Tachanka scream
---
wtf they are so bad...
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ thats casual for you... I dont know what else to say
---
Don’t play casual then? Casual is for having fun and just trying new stuff or being an idiot, ranked is where you play properly. And then depending on skill you can go further
---
Lmo had all at 500 hours, intense thunt grinding

I've been consistently high gold with the occasional plat 3 since the 30's(when I started playing ranked). Currently 157
---
Weird, I went and tested where you were sitting and thought it was because of the weird way you had to get into that small space, but it registered my shots fine. Although I did do it on a LAN instead of using UBI's servers..
---
I still want to say it was because of that weird spot you chose, but that sucks.
---
Eewww why do we have weebs on this community OFF 
---
It doesn't really matter when everyone actually uses a controller. But as soon as one person is using KB&amp;M it ruins it.
---
You could say the same about all the racing series around the world that use almost completley stock cars. It'll be competitive as long as they are on a equal playing field but if one person is racing an F1 its gonna ruin it for everyone.
---
I played road to si yesterday me and my friends voted to ban Yong because their flash is more overpower and then other 3 people vote blitz
---
Yeah, I got the majority of characters by grinding thunt, I put some music on and grind for a few hours.
---
Yes they should.  Or they should at least add division style missions in without the annoying grind the division has.
---
Stop being braindead and dont reinforce walls tgat mira is close to?
---
But the existing community is still playing, they could make money off of them.
---
He is god now 
---
compare this when your asking why they dont play pc, a pc can cost anywhere from 650-1800 gbp before buying the game and peripherals an xbox comes with the game in a bundle for 250 + 110 for a xim apex (craetes a 1 to 1 tracking feel and converts a MnK to use a controllers buttons meaning the mouse is still replacating an analogue stick so there aim isnt as precise as a pc) theres an average of 500 gbp difference betwenn console and xim to pc gaming. me personally id never leave 144hz to be able to destroy console players, However i see no unfair advantage from MnK whn its only crouch spam that takes away the skill base controller players can still beat a mouse and keyboard you just need to be clever about it and in siege where holding an angle is the best then if your holding the right angle youll win anyway. there is no advantage to using a converter than from using an elite or custom controller.
---
10/10 would watch shitshow again.

Yep

I5 should be enough as it's enough for newer games. It's a bug with the latest update as the FPS dips massively.

I refuse to pay into their shitty gambling loot boxes, so just from the free packs I got the headgear and charm for Dokkaebi (worthless), but also the uniform and headgear for Ash.

Common mistakes happen, and will continue happening since habits are hard to forget, thus I usually correct the common mistakes, since most mistakes happen to native speakers who got used to write like they talk, or just don't give a damn, that's from my experience at least.

Mute is low key the best operator in siege

Silver is nothing to be ashamed of, that level of play has increased in skill so much over the past few seasons, if you're going solo on your games then you've got the ability to reach platinum 4 at least

 Ah I tried this once when I was alone on a team and came up against a full 5 squad. I spent the prep spelling help on the wall and then went to the attackers crouching up and down. Needless to say they arrested me like target practice and blew me to pieces. Lesson learned. Take no prisoners.

My friend stopped playing siege for a long time after he hit 117. I wonder why
---
Probably just guessed. If you see a hole in a soft wall, you just shoot it. Most likely there's a defender behind one
---
Angela Basset's voice: *"They're highly trained professionals, the best in the world."*
---
No its obvious that this guy is using a game pad, the others are obviously use it too, because you know if you can't shoot you you will be dead within  a second. 
---
Who cares, it's casual.

It’s then before they killed him

NOSTALGIA!! How on earth do you even remember that name?!!!

Shit.

Ditto for corpses.

I never talk in game chat due to my fear of other players being toxic so i usually communicate via ping. But my friend got hate mail from an ash main for literally no reason.

No I ain't. Just giving info for people

Try to make up some fun rules...
---
Usually knife only or pistol only
---
Yeah. Recoil control, aiming and game sense. All from siege. Have a decent recoil control aim and game sense. But my reaction time still sucks balls.
---
I see you have never played this game on pc, that potato aim from both sides indicates clearly that its on console and if you look close enough, below the icons you can see controller keybinds. And yes majority of people who play on pc would destroy most of console players, its just a fact and there are good youtube videos explaining the situation.
---
Thanks you rock dude! I’ve been checking daily since the 30th but must have missed yesterday haha

Is there a higher chance to encounter young kids on consoles?

And if you want to kill the enemy team, Fuze is a god with droning or Lion. Lion is on the floor above/below, hits scan, Fuze pops charge, if they move to run away from the hockey pucks Lion or another teammate on the floor above/below can floorbang the life out of them.
---
Thanks man x
---
This seems normal. 
---
As far as screen actually shaking, I’ve lost bunches of gunfights because I had a Fuze on my team and his cluster charge shakes the screen way too fucking much.
---
Free weekend?
---
Or wait put the charge above obj, lion and fuze use lmgs to trap them into the room, then blow the charge and kill them as they run. After the blasts all rush in and mop up whats left. Thats something I've done too.
---
That 360 at 1:19 100% mouse and keyboard

I’ve done this and it works, and everything gets saved.

So we need to kill dogs? DUMB IDEA

Nah, dummy high discounts to the point where standard edition is the cost of a meal at mcdonalds, and the complete edition is the price of a 9 piece bucket meal at KFC

Good point, I am well aware that you can't change a person, most people are often grateful for the correction and spell the word correctly, but obviously there are others who won't give a damn and continue their own way.
---
I don't care if the person corrects themselves afterwards, but usually glad if someone fixes their old bad habits.
---
1/Yes
---
given the AI in THunt I can't see this happening, the only way it *could* work is if the operator controlled the dog similar to a drone as the path finding simply isn't good enough
---
Was fixed in Chimera, came back in Grim Sky, i guess its back now

The average xbox players in the community

You own the drones on attack... Don't break them

Hello, *Jey-the-curious!*

How’s the new blood doing?

Id love doc on t hunt classic, but itd probably cause more problems then itd solve
---
7 the game looks good but when you compare it to say BFV it's simply not as good
---
What kind of problems?
---
They should just cancel the game when someone leaves after 1 or 2 rounds. Plus you cant really tell the difference between someone force quitting the game or the game crashing, or someone just disabling their internet connection or their internet actually went down

Rainbow Six Lockdown. I’ve enjoyed every Rainbow Six game I’ve played, Siege being my favorite. But Lockdown hits me hard with the nostalgia. Plus I remember it being a very fun game, although I admit it has been many years since I played it.

I dont usually upvote question posts but you have made my day. 
---
##Habbna 
---
Aside from my amusement, assuming you are using the starter edition since base operators are free to obtain, thermite is more of a hardbreacher than hibana. Whilst thermite can open a larger wall to gain entry, hibana is used more to make peek / kill holes and opening hatches. People still use all 3 of her x kairos to open a full wall but its often unnecessary and leaves her short to hard breach any other access point. 
---
I often play in at least a 3 stack, and I have never witnessed this level of coordination. Then again, I am like level 25 lol.
---
Leave me alone I sold all my skins in cs for r6 (good investment as r6 is a good game)  and I only had enough for starter pack but I don’t care as I got good ops and if I play the game that’s fine 
---
Echo and Mira
---
Thought ence would be playing in this.
---
when Lion mains protest 
---
Really good defenders
---
Depends, I personally prefer echo and mira but ela is fun if you're a COD normie /s
---
Give any 1x sight a try, especially on smaller maps, it makes the f2 far more controllable.
---
If its on console its usually to test out their new swanky xim keyboard and mouse. If youre on PC its likely theyre testing their keys to be toxic and crouch spam otherwise its jusy generally them getting used to new controls. Cant see any other reason since there is no real reward in custom games
---
 
---
My father is witness of this

Why tho?

And I don’t upvote anything cause I’m to lazy to reach the button even if I enjoy it I just keep scrolling down

you dense! that's exactly what Lion wants you to do "STAND STILL" 
---
smash
---
Nope, they were knocked out in the first round of qualifiers. 
---
Yes. If you are bronze 2
---
Echo is a great Intel gatherer, Mira is just great for her weapons and Ela is... well she's Ela
---
I have a few.
---
Scaith: IRA
---
Has an upgraded, indestructible, wider deployable shield.
---
Backstory: Came from a wealthy family, always looked up to grandpa who was a WWII pilot. Upon his death, she was inspired to use her Engineering skills with military, wears grandpa’s pilot helmet.
---
Monitor: NSA
---
Has Mk. VII Intel Glasses, displays last viewed camera on top left of screen and enemy spotted pings show the operator icon over ping when glasses are on. Glasses can be turned off to avoid counters.
---
Backstory: He would be Rainbow Six’s strategist, similar to how Caviera is Rainbow Six’s interrogator. I was thinking of a backstory that would tragically scar him mentally and socially, like being on a mission and having to execute his squad because they were traitors. After that, he would be picked up by Rainbow Six with his attacking counterpart, Goliath.  
---
Those are my two most developed characters.
---
Depends
---
Ash weapon skin and the Doc uniform.  Didn't get the challenge this week, playlist was too toxic to be enjoyable.
---
yea but hear me out,if he dosnt know where you are he cant find you
---
Which can help the team the most
---
Well the base game is currently cheaper than the starter edition so theres some irony in there somewhere. 
---
Echo and Mira are much more essential for a variety of maps compared to Ela
---
True
---
go to nvidia settings and change power managment from prefer maximum performance to ---&gt; optimal power u wont lose any fps but u wont throttle all the time
---
Which server do you play on?
---
JuSt StAnD sTiLl. In higher lvl of gameplay he is way too op. Bc what they do is either drone you out and pop a lion and ying at the same s time, making it so not only are you blind but if you try to run away it reveals your position. 
---
Today is Monday
---
Aww, cheers. Yea console. Was a kid in one my games ranting about the other team using mouse, but I didn't pay attention to his name so I don't know if it was him. 
---
So basically her grenade is useless
---
REEEEE. Console ESL team. 
---
its a common thing, beacuse alot of youtubers made "PRO FPS TIPS"...
---
optimal power make ur game run the same speed when ur playing, but when ur in lobby it doesnt go full ham, its rests and temps go down which means more stable performance
---
Shit man have fun!! I hope i can go one day im from belgium

---
You got downvoted to hell, but man, I understand you.
---
Usually  a sale should still make the normal version more expansive than the worse option, in this case it's the opposite, which makes no sense and means that starter edition literally shouldn't exist in this case.
---
Go into the NVida Shadowplay settings and change it to 60. I use Shadowplay on a GTX 1070 and can get butter smooth 4k60fps recording with near 0 performance impact.
---
I'd love to agree but - even at vanilla ops there are some clear misses in CTU - like "spetsnaz" CTU which is a common name for "special forces/unit" of some CTU like "Alfa", "FSB" or Police's "OMON".
---
Like come on - most memed op in game uses WW2 MG as daily driver - wtf?

Anyone rank?

Legendary uniforms for Ash and Dokkaebi, I honestly just wanted to headgear for Dokki though :/

It’s akin to saying Voldemort. Except it’s so old some people don’t know it existed. 
---
Sketched*
---
I've never realized I wanted this til now.
---
There are people playing with a controller on PC with aim as good as a mouse users if not better
---
If you read the other comments you'd realise that I wasn't anywhere near the mira when I reinforced the wall, she came over to me and tkd me. 
---
cav pistol is stronger than her smg, so i use a shotgun as a primary wepon.

Edit: idk why i wrote this...

It’s a 15 minute ban and then 15 minute renown penalty.. is that what you’re getting mixed up with?

Good aim, possibly bad enemies, OP only has one of these.
---
Excuse me what did I just watch?
---
Recruit
---
I love the idea but it's pretty similar to mute currently the only difference is that you can see where the green area is, but it can also maybe delay hibana and thermite charges instead of blocking them and possibly disable claymores in the area but with mozzie coming out mute isn't going to be used for drones so ubi might consider this idea but wait for the sasr results before this goes active. But my guy you are a genius and I love this idea
---
Glad with full scope is the same as using any other gun with acog, you don’t switch it out just cuz you’re closer up.
---
I’m not asking to replace teamwork. But something to help if there is no teamwork while Solo q’ing
---
It’s. You still see the yellow outlines. Glaz is not meant to push obj inside of smoke to kill everybody even thi that is his place rn. Teammates can still fill the role throwing smokes.  
---
Does jackal’s gadget need claymore? No. Should he have one? Yes. His job is to take out roamers. His gadget is useless outside and inside shutting down atleast one flank with claymore would help alot.
---
Do my hours count if I watch on my Xbox? 
---
That whole thing just hurt my soul 
---
Poof poof poof YOU FUCKING MUP- Boom boom boom boom
---
Once you start playing ranked with randomers, don't expect anything from them. Don't expect them to know what you know. Reinforcements, rotations and tight angles are things you'll learn over time, don't expect others to have that knowledge. Communicate, and be direct with what you want. Make it clear for everyone, so the team can work as a team.
---
Map knowledge, game sense and teamwork outweighs good aim.
---
On defence, PLAY TIME. That's a big one. Wait and be patient. Don't peek angles you don't have to. Don't make noise by constantly moving around, giving away your position. It's very important to plan ahead and give yourself time to react appropriately to the enemy's actions.
---
I like the strat, will do it, thanks 
---
Haven't played in a bit, didn't know they removed the smokes
---
Are you talking about the thumb stick covers? If so, do they really help? I've looked at them before and I didn't think it would actually help, just an extra thing to add.
---
I have everything except Doki outfit. 
---
I think you are confusing hard breacher (ie: thermite, hibana, maverick) with regular soft breachers (ie: any op who has breach charges) I’ve been playing the game since before velvet shell and their has never been a time when a castle wall needed a thermite to get through it 
---
Well as i see it the most underrated ops are Finka and Termite on attack, Castle in defance. Like most of the defander ops are used continuesly. And if you don't have a real strat most people won't get Finka on a normal round. I know that Termcher thing but if you don'have a Thatcher you might go with Hibana as a better choice at that point.
---
&gt; I’m not asking to replace teamwork. But something to help if there is no teamwork while Solo q’ing
---
ie something to replace the need for teamwork
---
You keep spreading misinformation Brodie , you never needed a hard breacher for castle walls you only needed a regular breach charge 
---
wtf is that clash doing
---
Tbf, it doesnt matter how bad you are playing against the likes of them. Jees

This is very well done, do you have a link to a full quality version of it? I would love that on my desktop wallpaper

Or you could look for the toxic 360's they do at the end of the round or when they kill you.
---
these are the people i hate
---
Restart the game and it will show up
---
Nah you just suck. 
---
You get raw aiming and recoil advantages, don't be a sped.
---
They should replace Breaches with Flashbangs. This will certainly improve his potential as a duelist.

Yeah she had zero plant denial , once she got her smokes out and young’s thrown , it was a done deal most of the time

Tooooooxiiiiiic

Not a single person played even decently in that clip

Wow, nearly every kill is coming from crouch spamming, this is embarrassing...

nahhh i’m just a garbage player that gets lucky 
---
lol yeah idk how i was so calm 
---
Yeah I don’t know German I was using it as a cooler thanks

Personally i don't like playing with children because their is more screaming and toxicity in lobbies that are populated with them. Fortunately we have mute buttons, which i use frequently.

I personally think it would be a great way to let the community voice their opinions on a topic without it getting lost in the garbage. Also maybe a mini survey to say what the next weeks topic should be.

Thank you for this. Your sacrifice was not in vain.
---
More than positive we already have those, or at least something similar.
---
u/LewisUK, could you enlighten our little friend here?
---
What update ? Every time I start up steam and there is an update it is automatically done. It is not asking me to update anything.
---
why not see the kill cam
---
True, it would be easy to just 1 shot people from afar. But still, a point blank shotgun shot to the head shouldn't leave people injured
---
Buying a booster is technically spending real money on renown, so PussySlayer69 would be correct.
---
Exactly she isn't really a strong counter in the first  place.  Do you have any ideas on what should be able to counter though? 
---
And he said
---
Yes. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** FUR6Community! ^(hug)
---
And what if it took 2 breaching charges or grenades to break instead?
---
To be honest, I'd be happy with it blocking Fuze charges and sledge hammers. 
---
The meta used to be as such, however recently the lose/win rate on penthouse has favored attackers more: especially with the Mira bans 
---
Ness- "Okay :D"

Gg ez

Bullets are his counter

What am I waiting for? I just want to go play the game now.

Having no counter is not a bad thing by itself and Maverick is far from the only character without one. There is no counter at all for Capitao, Caveira, Doc, Rook, Blackbeard, IQ and debatably Buck and Sledge.

Thank you so much :) ill make sure to use him and try to become a rook main :) @"

play looooooooots of thunt with him, it helps TONS

Thank you guys! All the comments are helpful :3

I love how you just let vigil stroll on by lol
---
How long is each live stream? 
---
How people moved from fortnite to apex be like
---
And then she got blown up and flew though a fucking barricade
---
This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.
---
His counter is kaid now or get this you can actually shoot him through the holes he makes.
---
They fixed Kaid's shotgun Recoil as well it's a monster now
---
“Let them come”
---
What about Bosg and Kaid Shotguns?
---
So, where’s Vigil? He’s wearing ERC-7, so I can’t see him...
---
&gt; There is some hateful shit in here towards console, which is disappointing. This is not indicative of everyone on console
---
i think its more of a joke, everyone knows aim on console is shitty compared to PC, you're aiming with a little thumbstick with like 1 inch range of motion
---
i was even watching a japanese pro-league console game and there were uh.... "incidents" like this lol. one guy aimed straight at the floor in the middle of a fight
---
but hey, in the end we're all playing siege so :)
---
Lol
---
y u bully me :(
---
HA Got eeeeem
---
Most of the pellets probably went around his head
---
 Nice, but why isnt he spawn peaking?
---
Cav has a hat?
---
Level 168 and I agree
---
Love how that garage looks, looks like it could be a fun map!
---
god, it's amazing! I love the detail, amount of color, everything! 
---
I really got heart attack watching this... i cant figure out who is worse than the other, you? Lion? Hibana? 
---
Lions banned a lot because he’s broken. Maverick isn’t banned because he’s a 3 speed and players don’t utilise his gadget well at all, because he’s a 3 speed. It’s obvious
---
right now your thumbstick can only move, lets say, 1 inch from max-left to max-right. by making the thumbstick longer via controlfreaks, now you are capable of more precise smaller movements than before
---
the longer the 'thumbstick', the smaller the movement ingame is for each mm moved 
---
Looks like we'll get a unique map for once.
---
I hated the squarey-everythings-the-same feel of recent maps like villa, tower or hereford.
---

---
Not too inaccurate, as those three things are probably the only things you'd need out in the middle of nowhere.
---
But they usually aren't that big.

It feels accelerated because you’re viewing thru a magnification.

Why is he using RDS Angled grip?

How cool would it be if the kangaroo just kicked your shit into the other end of the map doing 99 damage allowing you to fire a 360 backflip across the map one tap on that spawn peaking vigil. 
---
Or it just kicked vigil in the face everytime hes picked.
---
not in my country but i'm in america anyone else get this
---
Just no a 3 speed isn't what counts and he isn't that much played plus there are better ops for fragging. Ur point is 3 speeds are a problem and mav is a good op but neither op or the best fragger in game.

Your a maverick main. Of course you’d say that.

Mav should’ve always been a 1 speed with how strong his gadget is. At least there would’ve been an obvious downside to his kit, after the fact he cannot be countered

Solo queue attacking on maps like Villa and the new Hereford can be really difficult.

Thank fucking Christ this seems like a small map, which won’t be useless space
---
OBVIOUSLY, you can. Since you get 1 Uplay coin for every $ spend in uplay, and you can redeem 30 coins for 200 renown, you can cash in all that renown with real money.
---
Cell phones are inferior to a Full size camera 
---
yes. the game is pretty simple. i did zero problems learning this game but i played other fps games before. the one thing everyone needs to do is learning maps in custom, thats it.
---
Ye ubi said it would function similar to a more mobile version of rappelling 
---
Ps4 is shit i got vote to kick cause i used ash and got 2 kills both headshots and won the round ( 2 is good for me cause im ass)

But some macro lens look like this....

I am also a photographer 
---
Nice Art, let me follow you on Twitter =) 
---
Yea because they are so consistent now
---
Nice concept, but since they are adding the operation "Burnt Horizon" maybe change the Horizon fraze for something other
---
Macro lens can look like this, the person complaining is wrong 
---
didn’t wanna give anybody the impression that i’m trying to get youtube clicks lol and it would’ve been taken down. 
---
add windows XP type errors to a game like siege... creates black hole 
---
uhm... sure?
---
...what the fuck? What’s the difference? You’re linking your YouTube video either way. 
---
Because it's suicide. 
---
They went from no flanking routes to far to many flanking routes. 
---
Server side destruction of Siege’s caliber is impossible, no wireless connection could sync that all up in real time 
---
I can’t wait until the mods remove this because it because no fun on r/Rainbow6
---
I'd say it'll be towards the beginning/middle of march
---
yeah, no
---
Them saying its in Beta so they can change it as they see fit is a legal bandaid? If they removed the word Beta tomorrow would it change anything
---
Thoughts from an Aussie - Why have a shark hanging in the middle of an outback servo? The locals would have nothing to do with sharks, being 1000s of kms from the coast. Would make more sense to have a huge croc or a buffalo or bloody wild camel! Other than that they did a great job, it definitely has an outback Australian feel to it. Even the scrap metal kangaroo doesn’t look like a gimmick, that would be a normal thing to see. Can’t wait to have a look at all the detail in the shops to see all the souvenirs. 
---
looks good man can you do like a bandit weilding lightning or something next think it would look cool if you don't have the time it is ok
---
absolute masterpiece my guy
---
I'm sorry but what 
---
I think the *best* Doc would be better than just good tho 🤔
---
Test servers already exist
---
Because it depends a lot of who do you get matched up with, at least in my experience I got well received and even helped, but when playing with some friends who were new to the game the rest of the team was very toxic if you can say it like that, they even team killed and tried to expel my friends, so my point is that there’s “good” and “bad” people in the game, it is just kind of luck with who you get matched up with. 
---

i should've mentioned but i imagine it it be rope not metal, and shooting connecting the parts to the wall and pulling it down (taking longer than pulling down a barricade)
---
Now this is epic

---
Yo post more of these that’s tight
---
I excuse me wtf
---
Not white and black enough to replace my old one but still very good
---
No, not at all. firstly, it's just a very difficult game. There's a lot of factors to think about in comparison to something like CS:GO. I usually like to say CS is like a contest of raw skill and a few, refined factors in the form of guns and grenades. Siege has way more factors into every round. Operator speeds and armors, different guns and secondary gadgets, the primary gadgets are gamechanging, and the map destruction in a game with such cramped indoor maps. 
---
It's a LOT to learn - it's more than just skill and basic strategy, it's very complicated, and the game's tutorials do not teach the vast majority of the subtleties of it all. Not just what things to, but how to use them effectively, and even just basic skill and game knowledge is very difficult to learn and can take hundreds of hours, just to be anything better than Silver level of skill. 
---
I don't think I started getting more than 2 kills a game *max* regularly until I was at least 100 hours in. At 500 hours, I've learned the intricacies of all the gadgets and whatnot, but I'm still honing my gamesense and strategy, as well as mechanical skill. And that's with *extensive* outside research. It ain't an easy game to start playing.
---
This is why you just shoot instead of going for a damn knife

If that's the case then just try to download and install it to the same folder and when it's all done, verify the game with steam. It should work then

I mean that really depends on how much you play. Like i dont remember the name of the rooms but i remember most of the maps. Only exceptions are basement of villa and some parts of the first floor on fortress. But that part of the map is used less on bomb.

I'm in love with this map already

This. I started the game recently, summer 2018, and have about 226 hours. I go back and forth between gold 4 and silver 1 in PC. With that being said, my relatively short time playing this game compared to year ones has taught me this game has one of the biggest learning curves of any game. (Although I should note I got into PC gaming around the same time, as this was the first shooter I played on PC) Starting out I was terrible and had to repeatedly tell myself that it’s only a game and I’ll get better with time, no need to get angry and ruin the fun with friends. Speaking of friends, they are crucial in playing this game. If you play with randoms, you will get your fair share of toxicity and then some. It’s important to have friends that can coach you up and teach you some mechanics without having someone yell in your ear or type obscenities at you telling you to kys. I don’t think this is a game for newbies unless you have those prerequisites. It’s so much fun though, once you get your bearings, and worth the uphill climb imo if you have patience to learn and get better. I have watched countless pro competitions on twitch and tutorials on YouTube and I’m still nowhere near being plat. Highest I’ve gotten is gold 2. 
---
How is this contributing in any way to this discussion
---
Ubisoft would never have the guts to add them, their current agenda goes against that.
---
I dont do it to dominate, I do it for comfort, I only play on console to play with friends and play super casually, but if I was a console player I would totally be all over using it competitively, like, look, the problem is chronic now, its not going away. Sony and Microsoft dont give a shit neither to developers, so join them, you wont regret it.
---
Same thought

---
I hope so
---
personally i feel like the maps are easy when you play em enough and after playing for a while it becomes muscle memory
---
every time a new map comes out i get in a custom game with friends and learn everything and where it goes so i know all the maps pretty well
---
after a while you learn
---
edit: i have around 900 hours
---
It isn't and I'm really not funny or original but I have a bad habit of being fucking annoying all the time.
---
For soviet Russia 
---
I feel you on that. I feel like somethings gotta give though. They were going to put Israel in year 2 but then they got cold feet about it cause of the backlash. If only Ubisoft could gather the courage and just do it. The game will still have its fan base

PC.

Gameplay wise it makes sense though. If shotgun headshots were a thing you would aim at the head with a large spread relying on luck. Without headshots the skill is about aiming for the centre mass and making as many pellets hit as possible.  
---
My guns wouldn’t shoot, I’ve walked through the earth, shots didnt count,  couldn’t swap guns. Graphics never loaded in, the game kept telling me the party leader quit. 
---
Randomly disconnected all the time, can’t hear other players mics, can’t use my own, and the audio of the game has cut out several times 
---
Hmu on the weekend any I will
---
Nice also rip me
---
Are you joking? Cause that’s hilarious. An ametuer pro team?
---
US Central, however my Ping plays well with East coast. West coast, it's 50/50.
---
Sorry man

Calendar on the map is opened to April. Dokes new charm from the invitational packs says "end of the world" or something thing like that and the charm itself is a SD card with a date on the back that leads to April. Hmm a new event coming in April? Hopefully there's Easter eggs in the TTS like the leaked files from Operation Outbreak in the TTS. I love those type of things!
---
Damn you must need a i1000-000k for this 
---
I assume you’re pc haha, pretty sure that shits still unusable on console.
---
I'm also facing the same issue, i think the store is down but it's been 2 weeks since it's down. I think I'll miss out those packs. :(
---
If you click back into ranked que right away it’ll bring you back into the game you just left. 
---
His aim was potato, but some of those shield swing should have hit
---
What would his ability be?

Tells the enemies their cooking is worthless and cause them to fall into depression.

---
This humanoid of the homosaipen species will not do this action currently specified

---
Zionic what? 
---
Lmao I used to play csgo and for me bases are really consistent. This game however...
---
Ash will just run away
---
Valkyrie will throw a cam in your house and report you to the CIA
---
Hibana and sledge will make holes in your walls
---
Jäger will shoot you before you even enter your home
---
Tachanka is the safest choice, for he will love and nurture you
---
I’m pretty ass and I still have fun.
---
It says it’s a medium sized map divided into 3 sections so I think this is gonna be a good map unlike tower and villa
---
Oh yeah, i love oil rigs
---
I know. Part of the pain of this clip is seeing how wonky the game can be with melee and headshots I. E. the way he actually won the fight. 
---
Buck
---
Yea, I'm thinking so too. Is it universal or legendary to her is the real question lol.

We don't call it "gas" in Australia. We call it petrol. Literally unplayable.
---
just sucks that nobody gets caught in traps anymore. maybe one every 20 games
---
Use your ops gadgets, I see too much at my level people will only use a their gadget a little, the point of operators (mainly) is to utilize gadgets with your play style. But people never use them to their full potential, which basically makes them recruits with attachments
---
Why is every games' Australia map set in the deep outback?
---
Idk but it screams Australian at me
---
Ok cool
---
Ok
---
dont forget to drop frags through the holes you made in the floor
