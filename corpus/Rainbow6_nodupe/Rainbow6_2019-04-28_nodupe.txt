It's called "I queued for 30 minutes and found no matches at all". But of course I am expected to go through that because if I didn't your precious games would be affected. And of cause *brilliant* players like you shouldn't have to put up with such scum as a new player, amirite?

I love the AK-74 and didn't like the ARX the few times I used it
---
I agree friendly fire in Terrorist Hunt is absolutely annoying, even with the added health to players (because of people team killing in the first place).
---

---
I've found that since they buffed player health how players grieve me is they choose a high damage gun (LMG/Shotgun/Etc) or use C4 and then team kill or kill the hostage. 
---
It would be nice to report why players are being toxic; cheating, afk farming, griefing/teamkilling and for this report if found valid accumulated into some form of discipline. 
---
And an added function to avoid players who are being toxic. And block a player who is being toxic so you don't get match-made with them in the future.

From the NATO website ‚ÄúArticle 5 provides that if a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked.‚Äù The first implementation of Article 5 was after 9/11
---
Bartlett University gets attacked by the terrorists in white masks and you as part of team rainbow are tasked with eliminating the hostiles and defusing the two bombs they have placed on site. The cutscenes for that thing are epic you really need to watch them.
---
It's kind of stupid though because I go on Rampages all the time yet mine is Crystal Clear White I probably have like 500 player kills and about 6000 or so NPC kills with a total of I think a week and a half of game time so I feel like they should make it a little more limited
---
Reeeee

Zoinks! That got dark.
---
I like that, if only people who aren't queued up with you can commend you.
---
the situation article 5? it's a terrorist hunt mission you get after getting all 30 stars in the situations, but no one does it anymore so get some friends ready if you want to do it as you need a full team of 5. also it's really hard cause there's this smoke gas everywhere and you cant see 10m ahead.

Didn‚Äôt it just get buffed?

An operator based almost entirely on what a nitro cell can simply do. No.
---
Overwatch did this and it works like shit
---
Imagine teamkilling and not knowing how to do it without getting banned.
---
GSG9 ops are fine. They are at the realistic end of the spectrum. The GROM, 707... are at the opposite end. And I hate that Ubisoft is fueling the waifu and cute female operator look in this game.

It‚Äôs supposed to be a Tom Clancy game for fucks sake.

Exactly my thoughts. I solo queue all the time so I don't know if this was from a loss or a win. I haven't won recently (the solo queue experience from plat 3 to gold 4) and this isn't clear if it was from a result of winning against a cheater or not but it took away mmr regardless.

Yeah but in my experience a kippah is only worn when going to prayer (unless you're a member of the orthodox sect)

So the point is for the P90 to always be situationally useless?

I don't like seeing that people want ACOGs gone from any gun,ACOGs make sense for 1 speed ops, and on attack it should always be there, shit like that is y I haven't play the game much this month, a lot of server problems and the ranked system just not fun to progress through.

I think it would be interesting. I don‚Äôt blame you

Excuse me?

Might be useful if he could pick up a dead ally and use them as a human meat shield as well
---
I strongly agree with this, for all platforms, a few issues could occur though, sledge's SMG with burst fire would become like a secondary sniper and so would vigil/dokebbi. But overall is a great Idea :)
---
It's actually just an attacker who is 12 feet tall so when he uncrouches beneath an open hatch, he can see into the room above and kill everybody.
---
Well they could try to balance it by getting the recoil dawn and making it hit even less then the MP5 but have a high cap mag
---
Thank you so much! I agree but I definitely feel it for clash, her win rate just isn't in a good spot and something needs to change with her. Thanks again for the feedback.

I jut want something like situations, but expanded to roughly 20 minute mini campaigns that service as an introduction to what the ops can do. Maybe a little backstory too, akin to what you said.

Play mozzie maybe you‚Äôll win
---
I always suspected like a hidden hair clip or something
---
You‚Äôre right. But to the untrained eye it might as well be an sr25
---
The problem is though, the head, in some of my scenarios. were the only thing I could hit. I was contesting some guy who was crouched behind a shield, all I could see was his head, and I know I hit him because of the blood mist coming out of his head.
---
It isn't a Mozzie cosplay if you don't have a Kanguru in your background or a Tarantula in the wall.
---
Just how is that possible my mind cannot process
---
Wait there is diffrent power ports in other countries

Well, yes I know that this is just an ar15 but to the untrained eye it may be an SR25
---

---
he's fun, but you gotta give more information than that. do you enjoy hunting people down and playing more as an anti roamer than someone pressing the objective? I personally really like him so I'm biased but it depends on your playstyle.

I think the reason why this isn't used that often, is because Hibana is used on sites where hatches are the main focus.

Same bro

It takes up to much of the screen

They can't patch it but I wish they would maintain it better. Ban more dossers
---
I usually do this myself, but one time I tried it, and I ended up getting stuck in my hole and couldn't get out lmao

So? Anyone can play one ranked game, get 20 kills, win and have these same stats and only play casual

Still doesn‚Äôt effect me but oh well

Welcome to Reddit. If it's not a repost, it's not welcome here
---
I may be wrong, but I think they've since changed that back. You're right, for a while all the default year one operators were unlocked, but since they've changed the pricing scheme for how operators are priced based on time released, you now have to pay for default operators (twitch, mute...)
---
just sayin its not really a smurf account if its higher than level 100

Some people don‚Äôt play the game obsessively like you or I. Give the community a break dude.

I believe she has multiple with muppets in it idk tho.
---
How do y‚Äôall play without scopes

Finka is good if you like to push or stick with Blackbeard if you stay behind, for defense mozzie is a good choice and Kaid is really good for his slug shotgun and yes they are merging his weapon but only his ammo stash

"..and this is fabian"

*smacks lips*

Sir how do you not have twitch at level 78

They need to find these pieces of shit and ban them forever.

I hate Clash - she doesn't have a proper counter. Thatcher's effects only last a few seconds, not nearly long enough to gain an advantage on what is, essentially, a defensive Monty. What if the attackers don't have grenades to counter, too?

Well, my laptop has a terrible gtx1050ti, so I‚Äôm a bit afraid of buying an FPS on PC due to possible low performance
---
Pc is more competitive I‚Äôd say, and has things like fov slider and you can change aspect ratio, downside is hackers although ubisofts been cracking down on them lately
---
This is coming from a console player, the downside here is less customization in controls and mouse and keyboard on console
---
I understand your point but in contrast this happens to everyone and because it happens to everyone that influences the fact for everyone to do what which has been done... you see I am an intellectual, I watch Rick and Morty; that was a completely unrelated fact now watch me destroy your argument. First off I have to agree to the fact that there are more hackers and trollers now... however that comes with a growing game... however if you look at the game in 2015 you would see flying teleporting hackers... Beaulo would have experienced this, so I don‚Äôt think he really realised how far the game itself has come in turn with hackers. And tbh it‚Äôs really easy to deal with them... if your on the same team. Yes they could be in a squad, however Ubisoft has made announcements recognising this problem and are making better solutions for it. And also in regards to Toxicity.... that is not the games fault there are people who just want to be arses and tbh go right fucking ahead. If they want people to hate them for the time they are around so be it. Also in regards as to why ‚Äúthis kinda talk digs it a bigger grave‚Äù I mean it. Once people start saying this shit the game is dead. You are saying that it grabs the devs attention... yes it does but for the wrong reasons... the last thing we want is a rushed money grab like destiny 2‚Äôs fucking annual pass. Or some shit like black ops dlc. Or worse still. We want game optimisation you say... or toxicity checks well you can fuck that.... look at 2015‚Äôs Rainbow then 2019‚Äôs. And if you can honestly tell me 2015 had a cleaner game... you can lick your own bagina.

---
It's filthy frank, BITCH
---
Fuck Mozzie, and everyone who plays him. Sincerely, former Twitch main
---
1.) removing one shot headshot for every weapon except DMRs would be fine imo. it would give DMRs a place in the game, because it currently has none and that is a shame because i love DMRs. some people say the game would become run-and-gun if One Shot Headshot was removed from the game, but it really wouldnt if the game keeps having a low TTK (2-4) bullets. also, it wouldnt be pointless to pick a low ROF gun over a high ROF gun. those that say in BF or COD people run out into the open in a close range fight forget that they do so because they will respawn in 5 seconds, whereas in Siege people wont run into the open because they wont respawn till the round ends.
---
2.) i think to make sure the TTK stays within 2-4 bullets its best to remove the armour ratings and instead only give speed rating to operators, like Ash is fast and Doc is slow. people will instinctively use fast operators for aggression and taking point, and slow ones for support, just like they do now, with the exception of Doc and Rook because they currently have ACOGs and the one shot headshot mechanic. 
---
3.) some Siege fans are so proud of how successful the game has been, but i think some of it has to do with timing. many people here have come from other FPS franchises that are in a bad place right now (COD, especially Battlefield imo). when other FPS franchises fix their shit, many will leave Siege behind and that will expose its true success. it will still have many people playing it because its the only game of its type, especially on the console market, but it wont be as big as it is now. after getting a taste of Siege, i am very willing to play a truly hardcore tactical shooter. Siege on the other hand has some mechanics that are even more casual than casual, like reload. when you are reloading and caught by surprise when an enemy jumps you, you can fire the remaining bullets in the gun and kill him. but in Battlefield (so called casual game), if you are caught like that then you are either dead or have to quickly switch to pistol. tell me, which was the so called tactical shooter again? in Siege people talk about secondaries for only 2 reasons. if they can equip a shotgun secondary for destruction (Mira, Jackal, etc), or have a machine pistol for a secondary and have a shotgun for primary (Smoke, Mute). secondary weapons are never talked about for killing potential in a oh-shit moment, when in COD and Battlefield secondaries are given a lot more importance. 
---
4.) when some people defend one shot headshots, the lack of consistency in the logic they use and the lack of self awareness borders on cult behaviour. on the one hand they will say they see OSHS mechanic as a tool that rewards skillful aim and allows a player to clutch a fight vs multiple opponents. but isnt a tactical shooter meant to make the game more about brains, tactics and teamwork instead of raw aiming ability? the best game at raw aim is CSGO. why else do Siege pro use it as warmup hours before they play their LAN matches? if CSGO doesnt have headshots for each gun, then neither should Siege if they used their logic of making the game as skillful as possible. but here they will make a departure from the logic they were using to protect current features. that is why i think this game has an identity problem, it doesnt know what it wants to be, and the community defends it like a cult does.
---
IDEA: 3 hover boi drone
---
Idea fix the fucking game
---
iPhone to wii would be nice
---
Kid you realize even attackers play defence... *what OP is talking about*
---
that‚Äôs not a bad idea
---
Or when all of your teammates died and you're the only one left and take your time. They don't want to wait on your ass so they just vote to kick you out. It's so frustrating sometimes but the community is very toxic in general. Do you and don't give a damn about others, otherwise you won't enjoy the game with all those toxic and selfish goatheads in it

Read the title of your post. Now think of that on a global scale. Yes people are fucking dicks all over the world. More so outside of siege and if you know.. you know.

Christ this is embarrassing
---
Well, it's probably because they can get a rise from people without any real consequences. Just play with a 5 stack of friends or something and you should be good.
---
Little story: My buddy and I were playing late at night and ran into a 5 stack with one player hard carrying them, we thought nothing of it. On the second to last round I found out from my killcam and told my buddy and he didn't believe me so I called the cheater out his whole team got defensive and angry at me and he joked about it and last round comes he aces our team, each kill being total bullshit including my friend who from that point on we knew he was 100% hacking as well as our other 3 teammates. We reported him, log in and get this message a few days later.
---
No problem man I was just wondering what sort of platform you guys play on
---
I think that this 14 yrs old is taller than mozzie
---
(as he said in acoged french)
---
Don't kid me. OP is sharing his experiences with map and I share mine. And I'm pretty sure most part of his complains are in fact about defending while attackers can shoot you from everywhere.
---
What's your point?
---
You should be able to run at above 60 fps as long as your laptop doesn't throttle like hell.
---
Both are getting a rework but indeed, Kafe is probably coming next season
---
The new Hereford is way better and even kinda competitive
---
I hope they'll remove Chalet/Skyscraper, add the reworked Kafe and things should be fine.
---
Well, almost all of my games are casual and even more often I solo queue. And similar strat came out several times without even talking. It's just so easy to attack it as long as one person watches stairs behind.
---
No,the only way is to check every weapon

It‚Äôs a team based tactical shooter...why tf would anyone want to solo queue with randoms if they can 5 stack with people they know and almost guarantee the win..
---
That‚Äôs takes all the fun out of the game.

No because then it becomes only about kills and then fucks with 4 mans

I cant really recommend many operators since I've just gotten a few I know I enjoy and have stuck to them. But I can tell you who you really shouldn't get.

Ela right now in her state is one of the weakest operators. Her gun does 22 damage and has recoil horizontally to the point of where it's random which makes the already meh vertical recoil uncontrollable. Compared to every other roamer she really didn't compare as every other roamer brings much more to the player and the field in terms of a better gadget,  better guns,  or better synergy with both of them. Ela doesn't bring any of those. She has yes a good shotgun but horrible secondary gadgets. She has a "okay" mine which it really isn't but a horrible carbine or a short ranged shotgun. Just right now Ela isn't very good,  not one bit.

Play solo or with friends. People seem to think tk-ing is more acceptable on T-hunt.

\*insert pun sound\*

Isn't Ireland a part of United Kingdom ? (I'm from Central Europe, I may be wrong)  If it is, then I doubt they will release Irish operator separately from UK when Sledge is Scottish and is in UK unit.
---
His guns are really good if u can hit ur shots and he is a really good support kinda character, track the footprints and let other people hunt. Hes really fun.
---
He‚Äôs really good in a 1v1 , he‚Äôs really good for flanking and his guns are one of the best , if you can aim well then the bosg12 can dominate
---
That looks amazing! Any chance you could make this a wallpaper? Or is it already high res?
---
Remember bud, there are no Ash mains. There are only Yaeger mains on attack
---
I coudn't agree more
---
I can hear doc mains weeping
---
Is John wick an operator now ?
---
Try some aim boosters to improve your skill. Practice with one a few times a day. Clicking those little dots frequently can really improve your aim
---
I felt that
---
The sad thing is he tried it every round he was on defence
---
Bandit is also the one that sits near thatcher emps most of the time and loosing the targeting reticle can get you killed.
---
Damn
---
Sledge: *Meh*. The animation and skins are nice, but I really don't like how the model makes him look fat or the round hammer.
---
Blackbeard: Pretty good, the mediocre weapon skins are the only downside.
---
Hibana: The fact that she doesn't use her X-KAIROS pellets as a ninja star either in-game or during her animation despite it being implied right here ruins my day and my disappointment is immeasurable. 0/10. (It is a decent looking skin though)
---
Blitz: Easily one of the best Elites. 10/10.
---
IQ: Legit the worst or 2nd worst Elite in the game, tied with Pulse's. Terrible skin, terrible animation, terrible weapon skins.
---
Money. Somebody --corporate sponsors-- happens to be spending money on this so people can see their logos, slogans, and products.    
---
It also demonstrates that UBI's vision and implementation of eSports is kinda broken just like parts of the game itself.  One would think they would structure things better to have it so all the teams playing would be in it to win it.  Maybe they should double or even quadruple the number of teams that compete in their events?
---
I agree
---
The backpacks got no hit box
---
c h u n k c h u n k
---
I see where you're coming from but then say we are a 5 stack playing against  a 3 and  a 2 stack, we still have an advantage
---
It was confirmed in Para Bellum
---
I do that all the time
---
Use peekers advantage against him, it's not that hard, and if you're all golds, how come your team mate can drop 12 but you drop 2? If you didn't stand a chance tf do you want me to do? Git gud and stop crying. It happened to me, I didn't bitch, I accepted it, looked over my mistakes, and I've been better since.
---
I had the same. I had an angle on a maverick hole and suddenly I got headshot. The killcam shows that the maverick killed me through the hole I was looking at and he saw my full body and I didn‚Äôt even saw his head
---
Bc people put that between letters in bad words and they believe that's the only time that people would use three slashes
---
I wish i didn't look at it.
---
WTF
---
The red corners of the hibana charge aiming reticle, that look like this
---
|__                     __|
---
Align the tip of the vertical section of the corner with the centre of the bottom row of reinforcement prongs
---
I really thought they where going to play more seriously now that shaiiko is unbanned lol

After I watched the film Boy, I can tell a kiwi straight away, before, I struggled. I'm ashamed to say I'm a Brit and work with kiwis and Aussies!
---
I was wishing that the reward was free r6 credits, but fuck dat the raptor legs frost is better
---
Is it dangerous?
---
Thing is, this would reintroduce the reseting meta as you could now down your team mate to get them back to 40 HP. 
---
Dropping to 20hp was the idea in trying to remove this from the game.
---
I‚Äôm a big fan of the pulse skin. I still think that twitch/jager are the top tier and I‚Äôve really liked the doc skin as of recent.
---
That's kind of idiotic, you'd think that a company like Ubisoft would have a system that can tell between someone saying something offensive and accidentally pressing a few keys on their keyboard.
---
1, get a better camera 2, get a pc
---
I was there for six months a year ago on UDP, played on xbox and never had an issue matchmaking, although you will see the same people often
---
I was in a casual, chill
---
The aim, the speed, the recoil control. Idk where to start..
---
This, does put a smile on my face
---
It would remove an accidental pick, no more auto pick tachanka it's rare but it happens. A lot of reasons, can't think of them all sorry way too tired.
---
THAT IS SO TOXIC, I LOVE IT
---
Have you tried deleting and downloading again?
---
If I could draw I would make this into a picture right away
---
the idea is good, but this change was made for a reason. with that you would only encourage the one thing they wanted to get rid off: instant resets.
---
just walk through the fucking door
---
i got banned after leaving and rejoining and i cant seem to find the appeal ban link anywhere :P
---
I‚Äôve lost every game for the past month, and I logged on yesterday to see ‚Äúyou were in a game with a cheater on your team, were removing 100MMR‚Äù fucking bullshit
---
Oof
---
Yes that‚Äôs called infinite overtime. It goes on forever until you are ahead by two rounds
---
Very clean
---
Okay but either you are lying about being 14 or you steal your moms credit card for some weird shit.
---
Sounds like you have a lot of friends
---
To be honest I don't think wait times will double because from my experience, 5 stacks are definitely not the most common amount of communicating players per a team, it's usually 2 or 3 tjat are most common, so the wait times will be affected, but not massively
---
I was gonna make that joke...
---
Now how in the hell did you do that?
---
She's gonna replace that bike with a tricycle near the end of the season
---
zironic was in the perfect position, only pic I could find to work. With this idea and suggestion.
---
ok? i often play 5 stack with mates, do you? bet you won‚Äôt reply
---
It only applies if you are in the same squad as the cheater
---
Thanks :)
---
That's an OOF for the opposite team, nice ace
---
Yeah very frequently in fact
---
You just hold the button then release when you want to swing.
---
Not if you draw the last round
---
Why is this guy not a pro player?
---
That's because the only time people use Tachanka are shitters in silver and you actually have to know how to play the game to use Clash effectively..
---
Doing the Lord‚Äôs work
---
I dont even know what that is
---
I don't really remember my silver experience but I guess situations like this on video are rare
---
Im sry but i dont think the 7 people that said the same thing helped u out much...kill cams arent accurate btw
---
I remember back in dust line there was like operator art on the vents on border and everyone thought it was the new operators
---
Me and 2 of my friends did extract hostage on plane, I went Glaz, one went Monty, and one went Lion (when he was still OP AF), I cleared as many enemies as possible on the wing, my friend did a scan to make it easier to see where the hostage was (higher activity), monty went in first with shield up, took all the hits while the lion backed him up, once I was done on the wing, I would allow them to gather attention whilst I flanked them, we grabbed the hostage, we found an exit, I threw down smokes to hide myself and I shot them whilst I was on the stairs, once it was clear, we moved down, and we all got the achievement. And that is a step by step guide to winning on realistic

Lol im just messing cuz everyone responded when it only takes one u know?
---
Yea
---
You can‚Äôt stop smurfing so get over it
---
One round was a draw
---
Here if you don't agree or like the fact that I played secure in a casual, just piss off and go be a dick to someone else, and leave this guy alone he's just trying to be a good person
---
*Slavit√£o*
---
My group played and beat cheaters. I lost 48 another lost 52 and the final lost 120
---
If 1.25 years counts as new :P
---
Yeah no. I‚Äôd just avoid him if he‚Äôs that outspoken and toxic.
---
Me too, this was pretty lucky and just bad play from those guys. But i try to do aim practise during the little free time i have.
---
Definitely, but being a game marketed as a Competitive and eSports ready game, they should put lot more focus on fixing the problems with Ranked, the competitive mode of the game.
---
This also isn't some small indie studio's game, they got plenty of developers to focus on multiple things at once.
---
I love how we have a mute and block option in the game, yet Ubi insists on policing people who do nothing wrong. This system is so FUCKING STUPIIIIID.
---
Like, if someone says something bad in chat, just fucking mute them. Fuck sake.
---
I like it, and it seems well balanced as long as they don't have new-ela tier guns.
---
Thanks for the warning.
---
leave him alone? he came out of nowhere and said i had no friends
---
I'll see if I can upload some clips of alternate ways
---
No problem
---
repost
---
Tell me you got the ace, please
---
He has good evidence to support that statement
---
Its ranked
---
Lmao same
---
If you are referring to ranked it is because of boosting. 
---
In casual you have the same mmr as a plat 1. Their rank and clearance level does not affect the casual matching and vice versa.
---
police shooting people isn‚Äôt the issue, people shooting other people is. not sure why you can‚Äôt understand that
---
Are u playing on 5:4 aspect ratio?
---
Then you have every right to be mad
---
Jeez turn your sense down
---
what because i hate secure area? Solid evidence mate!

I think it‚Äôs Pro League rules to avoid screen clutter for viewers.

Every time you get the chance use that strategy they always think it‚Äôs a dead body so the go past it then you kill them
---
This is worse than reinforcing kids. I've had this happen to me a couple of times. But not that often... luckly
---
You must be real fun in parties.
---
I'm speechless
---
all my friends are the same
---
my brother is IV gold and play always in ranked. but im new to this game. so i play casual when people see my rank they take me as a smurfer so i get killed all the time.
---
Spawn peelers don't usually peek, they either peel themselves with a razor blade or fruits that teammates may be carrying. The few odd times they peek usually result in a trainwreck (example video above)
---
I like it. It kinda looks like a cake
---
You commented about something completely unrelated to what I posted and started talking about how secure area takes away all the strategy, but this isn't a post about secure area so literally no one cares. Stop pretending you're in the right here and just go shit on someone else's post about something completely unrelated to it
---
Na, the 14yo is too tall!
---
Reddit compression makes him hard to see. He was very visible in-game.

nah i can quit game and advice everyone not to play it

the best way to fix a bike is to jiggle one of the carb mounting bolts until it works.

It is, relative to many pc fps gamers you're a kindergardner
---
I think that this could be added although when getting downed by your teammate and picking them up ASAP, you should still get 20. Only when an enemy downs you shall the system be used.
---
What about instead of copying she steals their gadget, or whatever they had left i.e. she steals the last trax gridlock had left, the three tanks maverick had left, but only being able to hold one type of gadget at a time. It makes more sense than fabricating something as advanced as Mavericks torch or grid locks trax, because if you read their bios you'll see they were hard to engineer in the labs, let alone the field
---
I didn't know he thought of it I saw someone on the enemy team do it the other day
---
You‚Äôre just hurting yourself but ok üòÇ
---
I actually like this map.. well the second floor atleast.. it‚Äôs fun and there‚Äôs no other map like it.. I enjoy it
---
They wanted to illustrate what they are doing regarding the huge mountain of issues the game has.
---
I wish I were this good, but instead of ripping apart their skulls they would simply tear me five new ass holes
---
I feel like Monty and Tachanka aren‚Äôt going to be getting one anytime soon seeing as the rainbow is magic event wasn‚Äôt too long ago and they both got bright pink butterfly and unicorn skins.
---
The engine is already capable of this, they just haven't done this because of design reasons. I want a version of Siege that is less "stunty" and rushy, ans looks like this too. Like Squad meets Siege. It would look more like this for sure. I also love realistic randomness in games, and that's something everyone seems to want patched out of Siege as much as possible, and I don't like that way of thinking.
---
Siege is officially canceled for you
---
Basically porn
---
I thought silent step stopped feet from being found? Any that are seen is when she was not using ability... I am confusion
---
smurf
---
True
---
I got my first black ice a few days ago. For Thermite‚Äôs 556XI
---
I‚Äôve completely given up with ranked now. Like last season I was gold one, almost plat 3 (highest I‚Äôve ever been) and I played my last match to get plat; the entire enemy team was either a Smurf or keyboard and mouse or both. I just gave up ranked is a joke
---
Everytime I peak a window or something and get killed from the window or door im peaking. I never seen anyone but they always see me.

I always wanted black ice for that gun, I found like 15 black ices through alpha packs but I just can't get the ones I like.
---
Tf who calls it a rush out it‚Äôs a runout and that early in the game it‚Äôs still just a spawn peek
---
I have been playing since the fucking game lunch and i never got one üò†

I mean when every other gun can one shot headshot, why are you mad about a single shot double barrel with no ACOG?
---
*SKILL*
---
I have nearly 1000 hours in game and I finally got the skin
---
Its called pc
---
There are many terrible people in the world, and this game both makes it easy for them and rewards them for this behaviour.
---
I dunno this is the only real possibility... Maybe u missed it
---
Yeah it's engraved. Aged, but engraved.
---
Because a full body is a much easier target than a head. ACOG isn‚Äôt necessary, just look at J√§ger.
---
Yep is just Lora fucking croft with Cavs facepaint you can do this in like 3 layers on Photoshop. This required no skill to make.
---
Well I have more than 2000 hours so this explains everything XD
---
I dont want to change your mind
---
Wish I could tell ya
---
Sad.  It‚Äôs casual.  How sub par

yes, while silent step is active it stops new footprints from being generated but it also prevents jackals scan from pinging her while it is active

they dont seem to hear anything with the words "improve TH" on it.
---
If you go by the data alone Lion and Blitz would need a buff, please, ignore the data. Data means just so little compared to so many other factors. As I said, he is essential in PL, ESL and High Elo matches. Castle requires good communication and good strats in order to work properly, which the average solo q player simply can not achive.

There are some mini games that you can download to better your aim, just do them 5 minutes a day before playing or while you're matchmaking. I did that with CSGO (when I used to play it, then I bought R6 which I always wanted and well, here I am) and after a week and a half or so of doing 5 minutes of pure aim practice, I was shredding people. It still wasn't perfect but the point is, do that and I have faith you'll get there fast :)

Echo needs to be toned down yeah, but he isn't in desperate need of a nerf, and uh. Don't start this whole buffblitz bullshit again, I never want to have to experience getting blitz rushed by some copper using an Xbox controller ever again
---
Game engine could do this, at the cost of frame rate and a lot of other performance issues. I think someone already said that the lighting used to look this way but if you were trying to peak a window you were blinded all the time. Don‚Äôt get me wrong; the game graphics look pretty dated, but I think the best version of the game is gonna be with simple but high fidelity graphics.

I didnt notice it in game. Only knew because of the renown prompt

I have to disagree on some of these, like lion, i think his new rework makes him do what he was supposed to without being op, but his lmg needs nerfing, echo ffs of course he needs a nerf, shields just need to not be buggy, my head got zapped by my own clash shield because it was bugged throgh the shield, capitaos new rework does a little to much dps, mav definatly does maybe a range decrease on his torch, nomad i dont really see and need for nerfs, her guns are a little op but not to bad, and mozzie is already terrible because of a simple thing, THAT PEOPLE SHOOT MY FUCKING DRONES

Bandit's iron sight is amazing as it help with bandit tricking.

If they thatcher a wall you were bandit tricking, your reticle will not be damaged. If you use holo, the thatcher will disable the reticle and you will just get an empty square.

Also it's commonly known as the best weapon to use iron-sights on.

Great job op!
---
Shotguns are unreliable af
---
Sadly true
---
Literally unplayable
---
Or that.
---
Hole in the garage door. I had to watch it a few times before I saw it
---
This sparks joy
---
defending house is so shit peeks are actually worth it
---
Man, this is satisfying. I can't stand the spawnpeeking that stems from some inability to sit still. No wonder these "pro" players always cry to nerf Lion, Jackal, Dokkabei, etc. - really messes with your strat of running around like this is CoD, I guess.
---
It‚Äôs special forces
---
That last guy jfc
---
This game is just unplayable
---
Damn, are they aware of this at least?
---
As a J√§ger main, I really like this
---
Valkyrie OP on favela
---
Wait what's happening here?
---
I‚Äôm usually level headed when I‚Äôm getting beat. 
---
That made me extremely aggravated.
---
Screw this game I cannot even play this shit anymore
---
This didn't kill her but the same gun will kill you from 25ft away.
---
woah woah woah, who bombs us and does the road killings? the middle east, the ira, because for the middle east, we are way easier to attack than the us who are on the other side of the world.
---
not just that, getting a gun is very easy in the us and probably does more damage than bombs. 
---
also, how do you prevent gun crime? restrict gun laws? how do you prevent knife crime? well not as easy. you already have to be like 25 or something to buy kitchen knives but seen as they are so easy to make, know wonder we have an issue which the government is desperately trying to tackle. in the us however, not to bothered about the school shootings are they
---
No
---
I can't wait. It seems for some reason this season in particular the trolls have been much more noticeable compared to previous seasons.
---
We will avenge him!!!
---
I sniped someone with the M870 last night lmao. Must of been incredibly low
---
Look at the bright side, there is nothing more to lose, you are free now.
---
ubi deemed the hole too small and even though you fi the game deniyes that
---
This game is so broken! I‚Äôm not playing it anymore!
---
You should try to get a good group of friends together, even if their not as good as you it is much more fun, and you can destroy the low ranks ;-)
---
Yeah watched like 7 times and I finally saw it after I commented
---
Best mechanic ever used in the entire FPS game industry that no other game developer wants to do for some reason: 
---
&gt;!Black Screen Flashbang Effect!&lt;
---
But that's kinda dumb to me. If it can cloak others gadgets just let it cloak itself
---
Finka: *surges*
---
Bandit: *D R U G S*
---
"Your stomach says 'don't shoot' but I say 'cluster charge is in place'."
---
What the hell is that....?
---
Best op
---
Xd
---
Ya lesions a perfect comparison, not in gameplay, but in balancing I think. I usually run the spear but I don't like sticking to one thing so I'd say I use the lmg and spear pretty evenly, maybe the spear just a bit more
---
That would make it a bit op though...
---
Bit late, but it should also have the area of effect as of a Kaid to make it a little bit more balanced
---
The ability to lean without aiming down sights is really handy, especially with blitz and I wish console had it.
---
Buy a better mouse lol, it will help a lot
---
Unplayable
---
I don‚Äôt play pc, but if I did I would probably use ctrl button to crouch
---
They used to have the letter "V" banned, you just gotta go with it
---
Alright I'll try that(^_^)
---
Wow, your so QuIrKy
---
Ctrl is prone.
---
wtf roblox
---
Kaids area of effect is pretty small tho, usually the electronics aren't bunched together. Maybe IQ would just be able to see the manteaus so she can still destroy them and then she could see the rest of the electronics
---
Swap C with ctrl, or dont croutch at all. Easy.
---
Yea but atleast I dont have the game sense of Helen Keller
---
Why isn‚Äôt tower or that stupid yacht on ranked?
---
Damn and i got stuck with blitz while typing a reply thanks ubi
---
Alright I'll try that :)
---
How long have you been playing cause I think it more so comes with being comfortable, as you're put into more situations like that you'll shake less.
---
Outstanding move
---
Cooking is brilliant when used on a surface. Can coordinate it with a breach charge.     
---
The other main way is to roll it through drone holes which can be very effective on certain sites/areas.    
---
     
---
My favourite isn't exactly viable, but set one off before fuzing can really disorient people, expecially if you throw in a few breach charges/lmg fire. Hard to set up but the payoff can be hilarious.
---
At least you didn't get an alpha pack charm
---
Cause enough people complained
---
Hello uuwwuuu, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bigdfc/_/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Sounds pretty solid but almost like a better j√§ger
---
That‚Äôs cute
---
Oh my, this is beautiful üíú
---
I never saw Ying as a site rusher. I always had more fun using her as a breach booster by timing the charges on surfaces or rolling them in drone holes.
---
she looks like the girl from dogeball
---
That would make it reasonable, but I feel with this community most people will complain about how this operator would make IQ's ability a little bit useless but if this operator gets 3 manteaus with Kaid's area of effect and IQ keeps her ability then it should be balanced. *I'm and IQ main so thats why I hope she keeps her ability*
---
so cute‚ù§
---
You'll never catch me alive, coppers!
---
Thank you dad
---
Teammate: Watch out they have *x* operator
---
Me: *looks at top hud* yep they sure do.
---
I like it but I also think they should go home the Ak74u too g give him a different smg for defense. Plus I think it's not doing the game just if you have Russians and don't have some of the most popular Russian weapons.
---
Every time I see the word Kobe in Seige, I keep saying it in MeatyMarley's voice. Help.
---
This.
---
Hey, what platform?
---
I want to die

Grow a pair and deal with the fact that in an online game you have to play with other people?
---
Wow
---
I play with crouch on the spacebar and the vault on the c button.. Works out fine for me..
---
Wow, what a great gatekeeper you are.
---
Have a downvote
---
You love to see it
---
I had an enemy team that always spawn peeked on that Christmas map, so I just went Glaz and at any windows that had a hole it it. Got two kills immediately, and one jumped out to try and stop me, who got immediately domed by a teammate.
---
How do you get the umlaut on a letter?
---
probably. sometimes, I think they don't give a shit about it
---
Either that was lucky as f\*\*k or you deserve more than plat 3
---
Perfect Rook Bait EZ
---
Use crouch as space, prone as control, and vault as v. Also, b is a good option. Wherever your thumb is closest too when it is resting on the space bar. Good luck &amp; i hope you find the most comfortable method!
---
T-AA. If I want fps, I go for 80 - 80 on the sliders.
---
Hm like half the people have mics on ps4 the other half can‚Äôt interact is what I‚Äôm trying to say
---
I should also add, in offline, on lowest, my frames are around 200 on average.
---
Why not ban bandit or Mira
---
I still would have found a way to get my c4 stuck on the top lmao. Nice tho
---
They‚Äôre pretty cool hacks
---
But banning thermite and thatcher
---
You could ban Mira or echo instead
---
Your comment literally means nothing.. Of course he can scam your footprints, that's his gadget.. I'm saying you can use his gadget against him if you have good game sense and can set up an ambush.....
---
I was on defense, the lesion downed the hostage and left and it said prevent revive instead of revive the hostage since they were essentially tk‚Äôd, then I went to revive the hostage, Valk shot me, the hostage died and we won the round, and they did this every round
---
Ok so i know some peoply think it dumb to put 50%, i m fine with that it gives me 144fps and i m happy with that, if you are not guy that need good graphics try with 50% and medium(or low) shadows.
---
Currently with 1050ti i can stay in 144fps.
---
Sorry for the confusion lol
---
I think it has to do with the announcement of reflective damage. There was an uptick in team killing back when they announced harsher punishments too.
---
We need echo in the background being hungry looking at the cat :D
---
Careful, I think the enemy has guns!
---
What do u play on i can help you out
---
I think the like super cheap 15 dollar version on steam made you buy each and every operator at high renown prices
---
Stick to one or two ops until you know some maps and game mechanics
---
First off Scan*. How can you use his gadget against him if he is constantly scanning you, it also doesn‚Äôt help that those 5 scans also show his teammates so your not only dealing with him but four other players
---
it ain‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs honest work
---
Try locking your fps to 60,120 and 144 to see cpu % will change atleast that how works for me. Currently i m on 80%~ cpu usage.
---
It‚Äôs the mouse he‚Äôs using
---
My solution would be if you lean left, let camera be on right eye, same for other side. If you arent leaning camera will be the new one.
---
Upvote if this glitch is far more game breaking than crouch spamming
---
I'm playing with medium and 50%. My fps is around 130.
---
I said "they're in the building" once and got kicked.

They got some moon boots on I tell you what.

Pretty much what happened in PUBG

villa can eat my cheeks
---
What? You guys never seen a smoke grenade before?
---
So long as you have a 4 or 5 man, ying, lesion, Finka, zofia are easy support characters to play with reasonably good guns with a steady amount of recoil as well as decent utilities. However I play bomb exclusively so this could differ on gamodes.
---
But their are no counters
---
Why
