Maybe you should realize it‚Äôs impossible to have a bug free game, and bug fixing is a difficult process. And using that to justify your degeneracy is just as retarded as you are.
---
I don‚Äôt actually like this idea, the OP you choose changes depending on wether you are playing Offense and Defense and what map you play.
---
Can't play casual as a Gold as I face Plats and Diamonds. Can't play ranked as a Gold because I face Plats and Diamonds. It's a cruel world.
---
BB's dad Shieldbeard
---
Apex it.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a lot but it‚Äôs not supposed to be something you can earn in a couple games. You get a free renown booster on Ubisoft club so that is pretty helpful, but otherwise just play ranked and T-hunt. There are plenty of renown farming methods in YouTube you can find.
---
That's just the siege community for you.
---
Geezus they haven‚Äôt even been revealed yet and all I see is ‚ÄúBroken‚Äù and ‚ÄúOP‚Äù do people seriously want smoke planting to go without risk through this whole games lifespan??
---
that level tho
---
yea i cant ever just play to relax lol
---
I played about 10 games in the last 2 days on PS4, I saw someone doing this glitch or at least attempting it in almost every single game.
---

---
If they can't fix this within the next few days they should at the very least temporarily disable shields and clash from the game.
---
I feel you, I haven't even touched the game since word got out about this glitch, which sucks because I enjoy the hell out of this game.
---
I just hate Blitz. You make a good point.
---
They were also so quick to patch the ways to get on top of tarps on coastline but shit like this takes months to fix. At least with tarps you can still die. There was no need to patch that as a priority when shit like this exists
---
It‚Äôs the enemy team messing with it. Has happened to me twice. Fyi melees and explosives are the way to kill when that happens so you can still win
---
RemindMe! 10 years
---
It is airsoft. Civilian AR platforms have two pins. This one has a third, meaning it‚Äôs airsoft or an illegal AR.
---
Next time, shotgun the barricade and hammer the injured guy on the other side.
---
Cool idea
---
[removed]
---
Apex Legends, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare (maybe other cod games, AW was the last one I played), Boarderlands games... It's definitely not an original idea.
---
Hehe 42 packs and 0 boosters, 420.
---
Honestly bro I feel you, he just makes you panic when you hear that chugga chugga of his sprint
---
Anyone else feel like the animated screens just hurt to look at? Way rather have a good piece of art than the poor texture animation.
---
And blitz. I went blitz against a clash glitcher and she was just freaking out. Still not going to play siege until this is fixed.
---
I‚Äôm the habona
---
no, he has to be lying.
---
Well, they werent able to disable breaching charges from shield operators when there was a glitch that needed them both. It means bad news for us my friend..
---
Also i am playing in pc plat, so people probably take this game more seriously in there than on console
---
So basically fortnite lobby
---
What if you pick the same ops?
---
It‚Äôs the idea of somebody designed to beat you up close with a kit that either feels underpowered or overpowered. As someone who NEVER plays shields I feel they are overpowered. This is magnified because I usually play solo.
---
I was thinking of using a select fire  button since DMR are semi auto anyway
---
This ja√´ger remembered his acog unlike in game ja√´ger.

UPDATE:  [https://imgur.com/a/7fxeoQh](https://imgur.com/a/7fxeoQh)

Sick Bro!
---
I‚Äôm just tired of seeing the same thing over and over again

This would be awesome
---
ash shot you through the window
---
For me, I play on PS4 and never really had a problem with toxicity. Maybe I got lucky, but it seems like it's less of a problem than people think. (To me. Maybe it is that bad and I haven't seen it.)
---
They have a system like this in Rocket League. I think it would work well in siege!
---
To be fair you shouldn‚Äôt have played ranked knowing this glitch existed.
---
Not sure, I haven‚Äôt played pc in a while but it is rampant on Xbox
---
Yes
---
N.O. ACOG removal does not balance an operators pick rate. It does nothing. The whole purpose of ACOG is to stop defenders being op and holding tight and long angles the entire round which you can't see without an ACOG.
---
Yes finally able to show off my doc outfit, I‚Äôm not good enough to see in MVP lmao.

This is fair, but dlc ops should cost money

This is Ubisoft's flagship games as a service. How are they supposed to make money if you don't buy the season pass?
---
Thank you
---
I literally LOL'ed when the dialogue was cut to insert the sound clip "vigil"
---
omg yes
---
Clash. Just a solid black ice shield.
---
Offense: 5 Blitz operators rushing the objective.
---
Defense: 5 Lesions to litter the objective with traps.
---
I‚Äôm going to fly over to your house, come down to that basement your hiding in, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt!
---
Nope. Now take this downvote
---
I was refering to the glitch that is being abused rn on multiplayer.
---
I think the game was designed to be played as a hostage game if I'm reading it right from the initial trailers. 
---
I've always thought the map pool could be split where ranked gave you mode specific maps. Bomb has 7 maps, secure has 7, hostage has 7... And then you have a seperate rank for each mode. 
---
Idk just a thought though.
---
No he was on his smurf flexing and being toxic
---
That was the longest 9 minutes and 5 seconds of my entire life.
---
Being toxic and flexing he was on his smurf
---
Remember how in payday 2 you could customize the music for basically every different screen? Yeah we need that for siege
---
Thanks
---
If leak is accurate, operator is supposed to be like both cav and vigil
---
Upvoted.
---
Shit, i guess I gotta do my placements now.
---
Either all lesion or all docs for defence. No one will die with doc and no one is getting into obj. with lesion. And all finka or montagne for attack. No one will hit anyone and sasg rush with double health
---
According to the leaks that's actually a female.
---
Great idea! Too bad you‚Äôll actually be level 1200 before they implement something like this lol.
---
I saw this BS lastnight in a match.
---
No
---
It‚Äôs Ma‚Äôam!!
---
Yea but u can‚Äôt mute teamkilling genius
---
Which one üòÇüòÇ
---
Lmao no dude. This isn‚Äôt the Xbox 360
---
No the Danish Frogmen was the female in the leaks and the Secret Service was a man. But again those are leaks so we‚Äôll know for sure in the next couple of days here.
---
Couldn't be at a worse time. Milan starts soon and a good chunk of the people who would tune in are harboring some negative feelings bc of these game breaking glitches.
---
We already lost hostage this season to a glitch. Now we can't play the other 2 modes either. Sucks man.
---
That's actually a great idea too. If they design a map with just considering the game mode then they will be more balanced. Since a lot of the maps either have a good bomb spot with bad secure or vise versa.
---
Try the plutonium launcher. You can always find a good lobby
---
Oh soarry
---
I cant tell you sorry :) hope you understand :)
---
My opinion, Clash (so much shocking power and just having a giant wall of shields), Smoke (could hold off pushes from a doorway for quite a long time), Maybe Twitch (obvious reason), definitely Ying (again, obvious), Finka (stacked boosts), maybe Nomad (Could lock down massive sections of a map easily), maybe Doc (so much heals), Obviously Tachanka (just spawn peak multiple windows with the turrets), Echo (could deny plants for potential an entire round), Mira (could stack windows everywhere and especially with the vector), maybe Lesion (all the needles), Maestro, (So many LMGs and turrets), and probably Mozzie, (possibly could take all the attacker drones).
---
Ahh ok, I actually heard that they were both female. But yeah, grain of salt.
---
It started on Xbox
---
Know the feeling
---
Showing them off to who?
---
All Fuze ops would be a nightmare and so would all Ying's. 
---
Picture every 2 seconds dealing with a Fuze charge or Candela as an anchor. You'd stand no chance.
---
Shoulda made noobmaster69 a tachanka main
---
Definitely, it even says in his bio he took part in counter piracy ops, which could mean that he was sniping pirates with his SR25
---
I like wan better.
---
Gamebreaking glitch that can be done with IQ. She is invisible to defenders, on her view she is still outside. She makes no sound at all making it impossible to locate her
---
Omfg
---
Bandit?
---
Yeah I thought that and then when I got placed in Silver I realized casual players were playing better on average it seemed.
---
Well whyd u pick Twitch
---
Who the hell mains castle tho?
---
Me too i love his shotgun
---
I added a text to add context. She killed 4 people in my team doing this. No one saw her, Killcam shows she is outside. This is ps4 so it cant be hacks.
---
#*Clearance level 1189*
---
Looks awfully like a fibonacci spiral to me.
---
It's happend to me a couple of times today as well and I was really confused

Yeah could be

It was a typo. The abbr. is mlao - Mongolian Llama Assault Operation
---
If I got to log onto just to see Elite Soviet Fuze very day, I might log on just to see the menu.
---
How dare you take an operator that anyone could‚Äôve picked! You should be banned for being faster than me!
---
How do you manage that
---
Did you walk straight at her and make no effort to flank or
---
There's no eye. The atmosphere is the gif is suppose to be mysterious almost like these two are appearing out of no where. Some basic information about one these operators might be hidden too but nice try dude
---
Ubi pls

Edit: there‚Äôs no battleeye on R6 for console. The logo just shows up on the main loading screen on all platforms.
---
It says my main right there
---
LETS FUCKING GO BOIS.  *Like nice playing and all but like the highlight of the clip*
---
It‚Äôd be kind of weird considering that‚Äôd be the first op with a passive as their main gadget (Dokk and Cav don‚Äôt count since, yes they have passives but they also have activated abilities)
---
Not even the right number
---
Those are rookie numbers
---
They could have made every wear all black and cover their faces, when are y‚Äôall going to realize thats terrible for character design?
---
Flank? Im sorry but you do realise that im playing in gold right? If someone pays even 2% of their attention to me i cant flank them....
---
Where do I say hacking? Not my video a friends. It‚Äôs clearly the new invisible glitch.
---
Gotta hype up the team ya feel

Rn?

I have no words

Nah suppressor on jaeger god teir

Yeah I know, I've seen the leaks, just wondering if it was referencing something else in the same patch though, New event, rework of something etc.
---
Why do u like him
---
Why do you think he likes his 6-inch blade.
---
I think this person is saying they lost due to a shield glitch unless I'm wrong
---
She was outside and killed the guy contesting bruh
---
Chinese sweat shop workers get half a grain of rice for every glitch they find. The person who found this one might‚Äôve gotten a whole grain.
---
These are the things that fuel my nightmares
---
I think thats the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve seen today.. what do you use to edit lmao?
---
Ash and Zofia are S but otherwise the best one i‚Äôve seen
---
Ah, I see
---
Gr8 b8 m8
---
Dokkaebi looks like Markiplier
---
are we just going to ignore the fact that he is level 1189
---
Is the new op's ability is sinking through the floor? That would be cool
---
That would be epic!
---
He's  representing SDU members who are on-call and just throw their gear on top of whatever they happen to be wearing when they got called in
---
Not a nice one, she was shield glitching.
---
Yea i got killed twice by IQ who use this glitch, and im playing on console..
---
I don't think they can get the license to add the glock in, if Warden doesn't have a new handgun it will be a pre exisiting varient of whatever he gets kinda like Gridlock with the SAW varient of Capitao's M249 LMG.
---
Jaeger is still one of the strongest ops in this game and will be even after this guy comes out. Why do people keep trying to downplay how insanely good many of the starter ops still are?
---
Not really, isn't it supposed to be the same material? I mean you'd kind of expect it to be
---
Clash is an S right now till her damn glitch gets patched.
---
Hacker girl in an a world with really advanced technology. I wonder what she'd do
---
I think kapkan should be at least A, I mean he's got a great loadout and also very useful for playing OBJ
---
I mean if you let them know where you are you aren't flanking. Crouch-walk, sneak up on the bitch, and pop her. 
---
If that's too hard, bring frags and roll them near her feet. Preferably one in front, one behind, or have a teammate flash her just before you lob yours. Alternatively, use Zofia.
---
You fail to realize how much of this sub get erections when they see "tacticool" shit
---
If i were you.. i would contact ubi support and ask for 6 r6 credits
---
I‚Äôm sorry whose preferred op is castle? TF?
---
Because he is fast; both speed and gun. I like bandit tricking as well
---
What, do you not agree with the idea of having to think more tactically in a tactical fps?
---
Doesn't seem like it due to their reply to me.
---
The amount of editing that went into this...amazing
---
This is actually a great idea. With this new season at least they‚Äôre adding the whole ‚ÄúFavorite Attacker &amp; Defender‚Äù sections on the Operator screen so they could easily go the extra mile and add something like this too.
---
I wont
---
And also Jager, and IQ.. damn those glitches
---
leaker said they're called Nokk and Warden and she got it right the American is wearing a suit and tie.
---
Unfortunately there's no new maps other than Outback this year, I think they're reworking some maps to make them more balanced and to help them fit the game engine or something like that they said a while ago.
---
Hopefully they put more maps in with Year 5 maybe 2 new maps like with Year 3.
---
hit em w the apex special my guy
---
Out of everyone, Mira looks the most "normal" in my opinion
---
I like him alot if you know what I mean
---
I find it laughable that this game has an esports scene. How many random bugs and failed hitbox registrations must occur in a pro league match, that everyone just has to ignore like nothing happened.
---
With how much it fucked the game, it might as well have been a prostitute
---
Capitao should be A his load out sucks and rook should be S other than that its the best one I‚Äôve seen yet
---
Honestly, just stay away from ranked until the glitch is patched. There is really nothing you can do about it and doing it yourself is no better.
---
Windows movie maker and Microsoft paint
---
I may be a tad off but there‚Äôs not a noticeable weight difference between it and my ar-15 and I believe they‚Äôre the same model. I know it‚Äôs at the very least 10lbs though
---
I was just in a lobby with that she was the last one alive every round and one them all
---
This bad boy can fit so much glitches in it.
---
I was the 69th comment and 666th upvote
---
Yeah actually just yesterday I got a glitch where clash can shoot with her shield out
---
Nope. But then again most operators lore is not very fleshed out. It's basically headcanon.
---
Remember when Hereford was bad but still not as bad as it is now?
---
No problem, listen tell me if he bothers you again
---
That's an issue I've been facing for a long time,I do have a group of friends but not all of them are available during weekdays,given we all are working.
---
It seems the only solution is to not have a stranger queue up,most of them don't even use Mike,and when I do,they hardly respond.
---
The new op is wearing a suit... is there even a contest

I think your title was fine OP &lt;3

Deploys a ladder that you have to climb but it‚Äôs too short to get you all the way up so you have to vault into the room.

Maybe an extendable ladder so the longer you hold the deploy button, the taller it gets so you can stop the length at half the room height and then you can climb on it and peek your head up from the bottom?

How about bug fixes instead

I dont think these were the best clips to post if you wanted feedback. Sure people can still give you some, but just posting "kill clips" and asking for advice just seems like a humble brag.

lol no they didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄòLook at Fallout‚Äô I get your point that just makes me laugh. Bethesda or Zenimax fits in there.

All games have bugs and issues. Siege as far as I‚Äôm concerned is one of the best games out there. I‚Äôve never run into the clash or IQ bugs. The lopsided matchmaking. It‚Äôs a solid game.
---
Dont forget that welcome mat
---
F for the acog

NICE.... EXACT FUCKING TEAM THE NEXT MATCH
---
Oh yeah i get it you‚Äôd be more cometortable with opinions from siegers but you‚Äôd have more reliability with youtubers like linus or even websites like pcpartpicker, that‚Äôs just me through I‚Äôd give you some cheap suggestions because the games you mentioned now adays can be played with just about anything, but I‚Äôm at work, good luck bud
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it. My friend has a $700 pc and it rubs siege and apex just fine. He usually has if not the highest, second highest settings on
---
What other uses will it have besides countering Maverick?
---
Oh HELL NO! Not in ranked! And I don‚Äôt get kills with it. I just dick around with it. All in casual. Ranked sucks. I‚Äôm not touching that shithole
---
Oh really? That is kinda of nice to know that you cant get pcs to run those games for not too much money.
---
I have 1300 hours on console siege and 340 hours on pc, which roughly 40 hours have been spent on rook, I think I know how to control the recoil of his gun by now.
---
Thank you for those suggestions. I will definitely look into them.
---
Also the game would pick your preferred operator if you were afk during pick phase.
---
While this would be a good feature, I feel like this would be way too much work

Guess you didn't look at the clip I linked lmao.

Yay, I‚Äôm getting downvotes for my opinion! Wooooo!

did you read the part that says it has a high ammo pack and can be used as a barricade substitute?

also, it can be used to block small windows like the Chalet's kitchen window and the one in the Outback's kitchen opening.

like i said, a lot of improvisations and potential for this gun.

Dear fucking god how bad can you physically be to lose a 1v1 when you can't even be shot good lord what a fucking tool, nice plays lmao.

Every game, I‚Äôm in a game with them, I almost turn to the dark side.

Thank you very much, glad you like it! I love IQ as well, will definitely draw her at some point :)
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see it!
---
because they didnt fix the bug itself. they only fix the method of how to cause it. that in itself is not a fix otherwise that bug would've been eradicated with operation health but i dont believe it will ever happen. maybe were lucky and with the new shields they finally got things right but as usual im having doubts.
---
There's so much wrong  with this post idec anymore lmao
---
Eww. Really? 
---
I havent played because of connection issues. First round is good. Second round I shoot up to 500 ping. No idea why.

so cav 2.0 ad vigil 2.0.      also, whats comTalk? (side note I am stupid)
---
Everything looks good except for the fact that Tachanka isn‚Äôt in S tier.
---
A well played Blitz is way way higher than that
---
I highly disagree with Alibi‚Äôs placement. She‚Äôs B tier at best in my opinion. Lesion should be in S class, he‚Äôs fantastic in almost every way.
---
alibi and cav in s tier, nice joke list
---
Yooooo that was you?!?
---
That part I did not understand at first. Thanks for explaining.
---
&gt;A shitty part of the game.  It's not good gameplay, it's bad and spawnpeekers lose generally.

You're contradicting yourself. It is a sh*tty part so attackers shouldn't have a problem dealing with it.
---
Spawnpeeking is a high risk high reward tactic. Wasting a tremendous amount of attackers' time at the cost of exposing yourself completely, being a free kill for attackers. That's why only the best in aim and position do it, and it requires a ton of practice.
---
So if a guy wants to perfect it to help the team, let him. As an attacker, you shouldn't have a problem, and as a defender, if he's a rook, he isn't an absolute necessity anyway.
---
What software did you use?
---
The fact that he put lesion in the same column as tachanka is a meme
---
I get that. But I think the risk is too high for the reward. Especially with her sub-par guns :/
---
Same on the ps4, I clapped a clash glitcher and then proceeded to be called toxic and then he left the lobby. I get way more satisfaction taking an L and ruining a glitchers fun then winning with them.
---
Or they look at this reddit when they're thirsty and want to drink the community's tears and laugh at us complain.
---
sad part is both of these bugs are super old bugs that were "fixed". specially the jager face shield. 
---
Hell people are reusing the old memes to make fun on the "new" bug.
---
Idk is it‚Äôs a glitch or hacking. But from what I know you can‚Äôt hack on console or wouldn‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs possible. Anyway I was in the basement of Oregon and iq killed me when she was in spawn.
---
First pick your parts, which is gonna take some research on your end.
---
Then i suggest following this video guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkiIW0Twj3U by linustechtips. It goes step by step on putting together a pc and goes over things novice builders may miss (ex. enabling dual channel and xmp for ram)
---
General tips:
---
-
---
*  Don't cheap out on a powersupply. But don't buy a high wattage one if you don't need it. Use this calculator once you picked your other parts to see around what wattage you need https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator
---
* Graphics card is generally the most important in terms of getting good performance, followed by the processor. Those two are gonna be the costly parts.
---
* Find a guide on how to pirate windows and create a bootable usb to save you $100 bucks on the OS. Nobody really cares if you pirate windows.
---
* Use windows 10, since it will make your life easier by installing most drivers for you. But make sure you install the latest graphics card drivers from AMD or NVIDIA website as those are most up to date. 
---
* DON'T TRY TO UPDATE BIOS OF MOTHERBOARD. GOLDEN RULE IS IF IT IS NOT BROKEN DON'T TRY TO FIX IT.
---
* If you live in the US use https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/
---
* If you are looking to play only r6, apex and smite, you are looking to spend around $500-$600 on a build. Those will allow you to max out those games at &gt; 60fps generally
---
Edit: Also an ssd will go a long way in decreasing load times. They are pretty cheap right now. Install your OS and most played games on an ssd.  Samsung and crucial are good, reliable brands and a 500gb one can be bought for ~60-70 usd on sale, if you buy from google express. Avoid ADATA as they are unreliable.
---
I would still rather the artists work on something else.. some games don't change the background on their menu ever. This is not very important.
---
They just put in a new team kill system.
---
Name checks out
---
There are no definite roles for most operators, IQ can be quite a good flex/fragger
---
Theme park is good though
---
TV should be the best over all
---
Did you just misgender me?
---
NGL Mira is really hot like this
---
I know and everyone just has to test it out lol. I went 3 games straight of being shot by teammates and shit before getting off because I couldn't play. For reference that was a day or so after it came out
---
100 IQ play, they can't hear you spawnpeeking.

It‚Äôs dying my friend
---
Well if you‚Äôre good at what you do then you can reduce the risk and increase the reward, resulting in the multiple 4ks I got with her just today :)
---
I disagree with the statement about her guns though, they are somewhat good guns but I think they have less damage just so that somebody can actually have a chance to turn around before they‚Äôre dead as Cav frequently shoots from behind, she has a major advantage and others deserve a chance to counter her.
---
I'm a very simple man. I see a JoJo reference, I upvote the JoJo reference.
---
Oh shit. It's like someone selling a car but without wheels. :D Thanks for your time and answer. So tell me, if I get it; If I will do all ten situations, that aren't hard to do, I will get enough money to buy 8 operators?
---
I TKed a guy using this exploit, I was praised by the enemy and by my team
---
r/unexpectedjojo

They should just put the "scope" on LMGs and DMRs.
---
That would be the easiest shit to counter and its pointless.

just imagine having a kapkan trap, a grzmot, gu, and a frost mat just sitting there on one hatch waiting for the new operator to just climb thru

Not even part of the RFF release lol, it'll come out much later
---
Last second pushes? Rushes? Kapkans can be placed anywhere, i think it would be kinda cool IMO
---
People who do this shit are actual pieces of human garbage, they don't give a single shit about the game's health and future.

It‚Äôs enough for a basic understanding of what you‚Äôd like to play as and a good starting point, the edition i have is no longer for sale, but I had to spend 600 hours to unlock all operators and only started with 4 operators that I couldn‚Äôt even choose. As you can imagine it‚Äôs much much easier now, and you won‚Äôt have to put in so much effort for all operators. I‚Äôd get thatcher, thermite, ash, sledge, bandit, jager, doc and rook. Although newer players absolutely love kapkan and fuze.
---
Pink smoke, unicorn tachanka, etc.
---
Probably not easy to fix ur not a developer. They might do it with the server maintenance that was supposed to happen yesterday
---
Literally so fuckin gay
---
Can't remember was there a new map in leaks or a rework?
---
yeah the roadmap says that there will be an american and danish ops
---
Flair checks out.
---
Me: "I fear no man! But... That thing... It scares me."
---
Blitz: https://gfycat.com/jointdenseasiandamselfly
---
Must be so hard to just disable an operator and lock them out. Not saying the glitch is easily fixed.
---
What a brilliant idea I love this !
---
That‚Äôs why I prefire as defender whenever thermite opens a wall
---
Yh but must people open hatches with thermite/hibana and breaching charges and they'd just destroy them and also no operators can actually reach any hatch without standing on something so it would be pointless
---
Breaking someones heart temporarily is better than making the game unplayable for millions! 0 fucks given about people main if its game breaking. play something else for a bit or don't play. That &gt; unplayable game for millions.
---
A headset basically.
---
yeah cause the fucking marketing team is dealing with the game bug fixing.
---
They won‚Äôt ban him, it‚Äôs a glitch exploit not a hack so they won‚Äôt ban him at all
---
Wack
---
For real. I hated that event honestly lol
---
what the fuck you on about that was mad.
---
How bout it in bosg12
---
If this operator is climbing through a hatch though, lets say on Oregon, bombsite dorms, and this op climbs through, easy 50 hp gone. Hibana is probably gunna be picked a lot if thats the case tho.
---
That way you may end up with twin operators
---
I miss the road to S.I. artwork they had
---
Buying Ash's elite is a waste of money anyway!
---
Do you have proof?
---
There is also an IQ invisibly glitch. These glitches mixed in with all the mouse and keyboard low lifes and this game is completely unplayable.
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs always like this... do you remember the glitch with valk cameras on bank?
---
thank god they cant just disable an operator, gamebreaking bug no hotfix. and this game wants to be taken seriously lol, any other big company would have this shit hotfixed immediately
---
No because for the sake of game balancing it would not make any sense
---
Stealing dem apex features now ?
---
Devs: regression time

Kafe rework next season (IIRC). No new map for the rest of this year.
---
First thing ubi needs to put in to the main screen is a fucking inventory
---
No, she can't do that unfortunately
---
It seems that learning how to play capitao will be used by me a lot in upcoming days
---
Can I report for this?
---
You cant compare console with pc, you got the aimassistant, we use our reflexes.
---
Maybe you just need to get used to how FPS games on PC work.
---
Could u expand on that ?
---
You wont be saying that once you have all the operators.
---
Fuck that made me laugh more than it should‚Äôve!
---
Agreed, still have to disable hostage in Ranked because some scum will use the exploit which has been going on for months now.
---
Why is it that they can‚Äôt put a testing range into the game ?
---
aaah that's hot!
---
Blitz balance idea: mount an A10's Minigun on his shield and make his shield full coverage from 360¬∞ so he can't be killed
---
Ohok
---
yep that looks awesome but I rarely play it anymore and I have potato aim now cause I don't play it and my friend plays on computer now and rarely goes on console and rarely play the game.I need friends to play with D:
---
the best buff to Blitz is reinitialize him to his former state, a 1 speed 3 armor, 5 flashs and no timeout between flash.
---
Never said I was good lol :)
---
was this on bank? And were you bandit lol?
---
Makes me think of borderlands...but what exactly would you prefer? It's better than the same menu for 4 years, right?
---
Perfectly executed.
---
That‚Äôs the main problem with Blitz, as soon as he enters objective he‚Äôs flanked by people farther away. This is what I mean by right now it just has to do with how far away he is.
---
Rubbing out full load
---
crocs in attak or defesne mod
---
Try csgo subreddit, they have a lot of people who know about that.
---
*[Nods in Korean]*
---
i mean, no more toxic than players on any other platform, and they can still play at least
---
&gt;Other game companies fix their issues almost immediately or within a timely manner.
---
Eh, that's def not true
---
source: i play other games
---
wow
---
So well in this case you are for sure right.
---
But in most cases trolls have a free way. 
---
I just can hope it gets improved so tk-squads gets punished as they should. 
---
So add forgive and kick. So you can forgive him as in your situation or you can solo kick him because he shot you for fun.
---
I yesterday had a round with 4 french kids, they hit nothing and i aced the 1st round. Then the first came up with "We will ruin your game now!" 
---
And started to shot me as soon as we spawn.
---
As they were 4 and repeated it i had bo chance otherwise than leaving.
---
I got that
---
Chill out
---
You're offering a better solution in your comment without noticing. Rather than blocking operators until a fix is released, block deployable shields for now.
---
I'm sent here by the chosen one?
---
I think this grossly underestimates the Nano Machine Finka Rush with a no recoil LMG.This works in mid gold at least for a kill or two for me. Plus she has grenades.
---
The fact is that Ubi can't supplement such system in R6.
---
You are basically asking for a ''Quarantine'' system inspired by Fortnite/LOL where the problem can be temporarily removed and solved, but they technically can't do that, because people PAID for the operators and the game in general. Fortnite/LOL are games based on this system (balance wise) and it works very well, but they are Free to Play games.   
---
Don't get me wrong I'm not happy with the time responsiveness of Ubi right now, but you have to take in considaration the fact that they can't pratically implement a system like this, because there are legal problems linked with the money spent by the customers of the game (even if the 99% of the community want a system like this and does not care about removing an operator for a week or two). What they could do (and I hope they will in the near future) is creating (or boosting) a dedicated team for Hotfixing major problem in a week or less.
---
It is cheating.
---
Why?
---
NP, tbh that's probably why xbox pro league was cancelled, because lack of aim assist made the gameplay unentertaining. üòÇ

Another glitch? LMFAOO They havent even fixed the clash one xddd
---
Ash
---
Invite so ubi can see this
---
I don't think stats should transfer, because the game plays differently on console vs PC, mostly because of pacing, but also gunplay is different due to weapons behaving differently and controllers affecting gunplay in general.
---
However, I agree that characters and unlocked items (headgears, uniforms, weapon skins, attachments) should be transferrable, even if it's a one-time thing. I started playing on PC, so I can't speak for all console players. But it seems like there are far more console players transitioning to PC than the other way around from what I've seen.
---
Two birthday skins coming right up!
---
Its better to do it but reverse on attack
---
Thank you for contacting Ubisoft Support. We apologise for any possible delay in our response and any inconvenience that it might have caused.
---
Based on the provided information so far, I understand that your avatar has been banned and you consider that unfair and offending.
---
We are sorry for the experienced negative emotions. Mind that offending you was not our intention.
---
So I have been using this avatar for about a week or two. Got an email from ubi saying it has been suspended. I email ubi asking why and they only told me this nonsense.
---
I am really confused, what‚Äôs wrong with it? Below is the reply from Ubisoft support.
---
‚ÄúHowever, according to Terms of use of Ubisoft's services, an avatar is getting banned only if it breaches the conditions.

---
I started playing clash (the right way) and throwing impacts at people shields before they do the glitch
---
and they would hotfix it within a week. ubi would take another season
---
Lol the image of Maverick on one side burning holes while the op is on the other side trying to cover them at the same time is hilarious.
---
I don't like the design of the shortdot in rainbow. When u ads there is absolutely no housing from the scope and it looks so 2d like it's from a 90s shooter.
---
But i think the scope would look pretty good on the m14. Irl the difference between shortdot and acog ist the reticle and the option to zoom in. shortdots usually have an option to switch in a fluent transition between 1x and 4x zoom.
---
i‚Äôm definitely subscribing after watching the whole video
---
literally me every time in game when I see ‚Äòpeak me‚Äô
---
You mean tom cruise?
---
I feel your pain, I have that too. It's the ugliest skin in the game imo.
---
It's not about the change being minor, because I absolutely agree with that. Even disabling clash would be minor considering there are still 22 operators to choose from.
---
They say the issue is within the engine that doesn't allow them to have an on/off switch on operators/gadgets but whether that's true or not, I guess we will never know... We should at least pressure them to change the way they approach bugs in my opinion so we can have hotfixes like every other respectable game does.
---
Also Epi said they would talk about the glitches this Monday, but that didn't happen. I don't know if we were lied to or if something bad happened.
---
I don't see what there is to get worked up over. If you don't like the theme music, then mute it. If you don't want to see the screen, then just switch to looking at Operators while you wait.
---
Frankly, as much as I've seen it over and over, I like watching Mozzie be a goof.
---
You definitely can and I know someone who has, you don‚Äôt even need to connect it to the mother board anymore they can connect through your USB port. The fact is you‚Äôre 100% wrong whether you believe the facts or not is up to you.
---
Some maps like outback and hereford don't have bombers. Not sure about c4 rooms though. I do hereford classic t-hunt all the time and I don't think I've seen a c4 room that wasn't in an isolated and/or unnecessary room.
---
It's unplayable, played two ranked games in a row and they just shield glitched. One even said "I won't be banned, exploiters only get a 7 day ban anyway". It's ruined the game.
---
YARE YARE DAZE
---
You sound like a pretty coordinated player. You know just solo que. Why ? 
---
1) Season gonna end this month this resetting your rank.
---
2) You need some solo experience as when to rely on                  yourself because it's never enough. 
---
3) It'll give you the taste of the wild and further push you to improve yourself.
---
I agree it's horrible. I report/ team kill if someone does it. But I still see it as ubi not fixing glitches rather than players cheating. I see where you're coming from though.
---
Yeah its back and annoying.

Thank you so much man!
---
Shields are a long time source of bad glitches. I‚Äôd just cut them altogether since they suck in almost every situation.
---
pretty sure that didnt happen
---
I know, it‚Äôs just something about it salts my apples. Like most of the time I don‚Äôt give a shit about whether or not what I say or write makes sense, it‚Äôs just the comma instead of a full stop feels weird to me.
---
Like in Payday 2
---
Yea, my most played op is valk, and personally I have either found similar or the same spots or even better ones than have been shown on youtube, guess we are part of the 0.01%
---
Using this logic, Ubi can't disable any features of the game because people paid for the game. Overwatch has disabled some heroes before because some critical issues were found about them. However, those were bugs which would outright crash the server for everybody.
---
I would, but I have an amd card
---
Thanks. Are you also aware of the deployable shield glitch displayed in the video? These have invaded most ranked games.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúruining.‚Äù I just never watch videos it‚Äôs not a big deal
---
Nah dude, you just don't know.
---
I see it now, was confused. Thought I had ended my sentence with a ',' on my comment.
---
I have Black ice on his smg lol
---
How did this glitch returned?
---
You really think an engine designed for assassins creed then repurposed for Siege is going to have some shit like that?
---
*Laughs in crocodile*
---
"People walking in front of my sight" maybe?
---
if castle doesnt get put in d tier where he belongs smh my head
---
Tier lists don't belong in Siege imo, they are better suited for 1v1 fighter games. Most operators are dependant on the strat, teammates/opponents operator choice and site.
---
Dude these memes r so dead

Didn‚Äôt the roadmap say there Swedish?

---
Yea but in overwatch you get the heroes for free, in siege people pay real money for operators so if they disable them people would complain saying that they spent real money and they can‚Äôt play an operator
---
Everybody gangster till the helmet starts walking
---
The odd thing is that Valkyrie is written in the game and can be seen on a daily basis yet people still don't know how to spell it.
---
Just like me in ranked, RIP
---
* laughs in school shooting*
---
I don‚Äôt see a gridlock male version, I just see Tom Cruise
---
been asking for this for ages... altough I wish they would make a proper training range
---
This has nothing to do with ping
---
I'll give it a try I guess. I thought I did before, but I don't know for sure
---
Das what i was gonna do
---
Yes.
---
Exploiting the game, and gaining a unfair advantage intentionally by glitching is cheating
---
Report them
---
Maybe it isn't about that but taking the time to find them. I've personally gone with Valkyrie in custom maps and wasted hours in there just playing with the cameras and angles...
---
PS: lol with the downvotes, guess they didn't like the brag... Or the fact that I stopped playing (wtf)
---
Lol gridlock already looks like a dude. No filter needed
---
You‚Äôd be surprised
---
Personally I really hate a ton of the skins in this game and I really think we need to price these more responsibly
---
They are putting a deployable shield in front of there face and you can't hit them the other one I have no idea
---
the fuck man that's bs...
---
Or you could delete it???
---
I remember that casual i joined where 4 people spawnpeeked, i had glaz, was a easy 5v1 afterwards.

Ima snag lover and i couldn't agree mo wif ya mate!

It's a bird
---
What if you can add a custom song as well
---
I believe that kapkan should be higher
---
Yeah i see, only when he stand still he gets his vision, but you are right the next one defender counters him out completly. Will be shit if you cant move a centimetre without losing sight through the smoke, while probably pushed by the new one.
---
The danish operator got that soul stone
---
There‚Äôs coppers out that would sue because they wouldn‚Äôt be able to play an operator they spent money for and win because they spent money and UBI is denying it

Haha nice!!

Notice how it happens more in casual...... I wonder why.

From memory, that's all but don't hold me to that.. It's more of an adjustment to what should have been the case from the beginning.
---
Get the copypasta.
---
It's that jaegar shield glitch bit with every defender
---
üçÜüëåüí¶üí¶
---
That looks like an L96. I'd like to see how that'd play out in a game like siege.
---
Easily, he's one of the best operators currently or at the very least in my opinion he is.
---
His M4 is a really great weapon but his gadget allows him to pretty much open any place he wants without there being a counter for him and the majority of the time you still can't hear him do it.
---
Wonderful that totally makes the game playable
---
So many glitches on this game right now.
---
What a relief! 
---
You should become a councillor, your very good üëç
---
Dokka potter! LOL
---
That‚Äôs the space and soul stone
---
They just need to remove deployable shields until they fix this
---
I know I qm
---
Just finished lost a match with one of those abusers on my team. I threw and always picked Clash to prevent that idiot from using it. Even though he has been plat for a few seasons, he does this to quickly gain elo. 
---
I really hope glitchers like these are banned as well.
---
To add to OPs thoughts, they could literally just ban a single gadget on the operator. These glitches require the use of barb wire and deploy shields. All they have to do it temporarily disable the secondary gadget.
---
Maverick is pretty awesome, his gadget can be used in a variety of situations. He is one of my favorite operators.
---
Noice
---
it'd decrease if ubisoft didn't have a special talent in fucking everything up each season
---
Have they even said anything about the multiple game breaking bugs yet?
---
Nah the original poster and all that commented on it also did.
---
You feel very confident behind your keyboard today don‚Äôt you
---
I remember when I got my first ace, I was Kapkan(You see where this is going) one of my teammates got knocked and the person who knocked him, ran into the Kapkan, killing my teammate and himself.
---
I disagree but that‚Äôs ok üëç
---
nope,I'm from mainland China, I live in Beijing.
---
i‚Äôm annoyed by not being able to get in a car with drones
---
I can assure you that is my clip, that is my voice and my friends voice aswell. Maybe there is a certain spot on those stairs where this happens and someone else also encountered that issue.
---
Sorry for no volume
---
Yes my parents let me use the internet today. One hapi boi.
---
It's just like Chimera again when that invisible glitch was going on.  It didn't get fixed for a little over 2 weeks.  I'd be surprised if Ubisoft fixes this in less than that.

Hello SRD_Javi, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bojesn/heres_another_clip_of_the_broken_clash_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I‚Äôm gonna take this image for...reasons
---
One of the few operator ideas I've liked. Rainbow has already passed the "realistic" gadgets so metal-like glue doesn't sound too crazy to me...
---
I have 15 hours on frost right now with around 120 welcome mat injures/kills and a 64.70% winrate. Outback by far the best map for frost get at least one guy every game
---
But, Hibana and Mav arent really OP right now, right?
---
That's in inGame chat? o.0
---
Put her face on Lord Farquad NOW
---
True but it‚Äôs also a ban able offense on console for that reason. You can still have awesome aim on console still.
---
These are independent casters/organization. Not related nor correlated to Ubisoft at all. It‚Äôs probably a left over prop from CSGO casting
---
fucking weeb reposters...
---
I don't know why Ubisoft doesn't work immediately in this case and in new-old glitches cases. With every hour without fixing it I'm having less respect about whole Ubisoft. They should go back to making single player games instead of trying to run multiplayer competetive game. Great game is losing its fame and respect because of bunch of people who doesn't know how to manage game like that
---
Pick one.
---
Yeah Ubisoft, this post right here
---
We don't want this shit in casual either, thanks.
---
Did you read his post
---
Have you taken a look at this subreddit at all?
---
I can se you playing on Xbox/ps4
---
Username checks out
---
That poor recruit
---
I'd just love some modifiers.
---
Disable C4, barbed and bombers for some brainless aim training with music.
---
Bombers only for some more action.
---
Endless horde mode for a bit of shooting with friends without try hard mode as in PVP.
---
All of those could just have renown disabled or multipliers added to them.
---
Not yet.
---
Joan Miro, fyi
---
UBI be like: *listen I am gonna eat this, grab another, I gotta make a phone call quick THEN I‚Äôm coming back for fixes just hold tight!*
---
There is video evidence of hundreds of people doing the hostage glitch over and over and then re-queing to do it again, and I have yet to hear of anybody getting banned for it. This game NEEDS actual active enforcement because the way things are, the only thing stopping any individual match from turning into a broken cesspool are notions of fun and sportsmanship. Glitches from years past are now reappearing and immediately explode because people know there will be no consequences. This will keep happening until Ubi actually commits to doing something different or the game dies.
---
We need to make the petition attendet to that problem
---
Play Outback. There's none of those things, at least in hostage rescue mode
---
Fuck no
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just pick and ban
---
While it's a repost I'm still angry. They knew what they were doing and still did that. That's just a dick move.
---
They have indeed. Aware of and working on solutions.
---
i play with a full squad and im gold 1 wym?
---
F√ºhrerious.
---
Alright i was just curious. Played in my first Go4 last weekend and kind of fell in love with that setup, except maybe the 10 second pick timer lol
---
Or you could learn to counter them.
---
Wait
---
Alright mr. Invisible

Love it how there's a cavity in the sledge one

The Russo brothers already lifted the spoiler ban so if you still haven‚Äôt seen it that‚Äôs on you

---
I counted six. Frost, echo, vigil, alibi, mozzie and lion
---
Tom Clancy had the founder of Six, John Clark, torture dudes to death on multiple occasions.
---
He just had a very rah rah USA mentality, so he didn't consider the actions of the soldiers to be terrorism.
---
Fourthded
---
Nah they shouldn‚Äôt be banned forever for using a glitch. The devs are at fault for the glitch‚Äôs existence so the people using them don‚Äôt deserve the full consequence as someone running scripts or real cheats such as wallhacks.
---
 I‚Äôd say a 2 week ban would suffice. That‚Äôs usually how long it takes for a glitch to be fixed anyways so removing them from the game during that time would help everyone.
---
This new danish stealth op everyone is talking about might have his covered
---
I saw a bunch of people getting banned last night when I was playing and assumed that was what it was for.
---
Im annoyed with you.
---
It‚Äôs the shadow from his mic. I zoomed in and realized that. Plus secret service aren‚Äôt allowed to have facial hair.
---
In Hammer &amp; Scalpel you literally see the simulation turn off in Hereford.

works for Rook too

Just played a t-hunt and then I was able to queue. Maybe try that

Funny how this is relevant again lol, just add Xbox to the list as it is affected now too.

Considering all R6 leaks were spot on so far and the current one.got everything right so far too... i'd say it's a safe bet.
---
***lmg mounted and loaded***
---
Its on his watch. Could be the activation point for their abilities.
---
I'm literally so good at countering these shield glitches that my teammates can see the shield on the enemy teams face when I cant. I can just headshot them.
---
Considering you repelled in one of the most common places on that deployment, the luck would be more about the timing than the location.
---
Specifically, the part you leave out is that the cheater CHOOSES to activate the glitch. It doesn't happen by accident. There is a wilful action made without influence doom Ubi or anyone else.
---
I didn't count alibi because her face is shown in her artwork.
---
this guy must've camped near a gamestop before anyone could
---
Yeah but even then it's 5.
---
We know the Danish one is the attacker because of the hammer and scalpel short. The part where Dokkaebi and Thatcher go back to their personal armory in the attacker ward you can see a Danish flag in the distance.
---
It was given out in Chimera after backlash for the first introduction of limited time pay only alpha packs. Mostly because the elite skin was to be only in the alpha packs. 
---
To stop people from being so pissed off, they released 2 versions. One that had digital camo and one that had desert camo. The digital camo would remain chance only whilst everyone else got the desert one for free.
---
That's what I'm hoping for.
---
Thank you for your help, but just tried and still couldn't....
---
I think coreross made a perfect assumption that that was said as a joke in a sense as it was the absolute and complete opposite; it could be that she is given no voice lines, no bio, no face, etc.
---
Yep.  I know.  I edited the post.
---
Watching you shoot at the door at point blank range to break it hurt my head a lil not gonna lie
---
I love server degradation
---
***i fucking enjoy justice***
---
its not gonna get patched till the next operation comes out guaranteed
---
Considering how common they are in Siege, Ubisoft also loves them a lot
---
Bud I don't think u understand ik this all I am talking in a 1v1 situation it's a 1 in 500 chance u win... Talk to any pro and they will tell u the same I did ur just fucking retarded ur the type of dude when people call u out for being a shit blitz player cause u don't know how to play without using op ops
---
You can stun (zofia) him, you can capitao fire him, you van impact nade him (ash/zofia), or use surpressive lmg fire. Just because he can see through the flashes doesn't mean he can't be stunned.

I'm sorry. I have no excuse for that, being a lvl 139.

Well it is all about the profit. We live in a different time and let's blame 2013-2015 for this gay ass trend.

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about their is clearly nothing wrong with siege your over reacting‚Äù
---
Like I said compared to a mouse and keyboard it‚Äôs nothing lol
---
Is the crashing after I attempt to go through "PRESS ANY KEY" on PC also included in this problem?
---
Same here thought it was my network but its not apparantely
---
Some players prefer something other than ACOG dependent on the map. For others, it may have to do with the red dot also being the easiest to associate they're center-mass orientation with it. It took me a bit to realize Reflex is the tip of the arrow, for example. It's easier for me to see my sight picture with a red dot or holo, then it is for a reflect; for example.
---
That‚Äôs just too much
---
I want the irl operator photos as menu screens again
---
&gt;but they are Free to Play games.
---
Except you can buy champs in LoL with RP which costs real money to obtain meaning you're entire premise is faulty and incorrect.
---
At least you're trying to think logically though.
---
Ok what the fuck Valkyrie
---
Well I'm pretty sure dokkeabi is a model, but wears glasses and nerd clothes on purpose

How do you mean recoil scripts? You talking about macros?

Operator Fire and Ice incoming.

How will you feel when you have a non game related issue

Yeah it does wanna make me throw up
---
If you can't kill bombers you're bad at aiming.
---
Try this on Zofia
---
Prachtig
---
Well, they can't disable clash because some people paid actual money for her. Maybe disable her weapons until it's fixed.  Shields and IQ should disabled.
---
*iq disappears*
---
the two best are austral and board but i like board the most
---
It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre hard to kill, they just don‚Äôt reflect actual enemies well and are a general nuisance.
---
Goddamn fuckin weebs
---
Haha look at me I‚Äôm so edgy
---
It depends. i'd say go digital.
---
the glitch has been absent for quite a long time
---
This exists?
---
Of course they were
---
How did they manage to REMOVE this like 3 seasons ago and now its back after the most recent patch?
---
Well, considering R6's broken netcode, I think it perfectly reflects PVP enemies!
---
Hehe but you know what I mean

Thanks for the reminder! :-)

Yup I‚Äôve had that happen to me there and on the stairs in bank. Vaulting over the top of those stairs you‚Äôre on has an inconsistent chance of you falling out of the map. Very annoying when tryna rotate
---
Git bisect
---
To those who encoutered that IQ glitch: when you got killed by her, was she just crouching at her spawn while you were completely somewhere else? 
---
Because that happend to me today and my team just couldn't figure out where she was. Is that the same glitch?
---
This was on ps4 btw.
---
Not even copper console isn‚Äôt that bad, he‚Äôs a bot or at least pretending to be one. lol
---
They can and should
---
I more just don't because of my opinions toward Ubisoft and microtransactions, I probably wouldn't've bought this game any time recently with what I think now.
---
So I don‚Äôt know how to do them nor do I care, but the clash is she can have her shield up and still shoot her gun so she‚Äôs just an invincible turret walking around. The shield glitch is it‚Äôs almost as if the defender gets a blackboard shield but it‚Äôs their deplorable shield and you can‚Äôt see them when their crouched/prone, they‚Äôre also not able to be shot from the front. But they can shoot you and see you with no problem. The IQ one I just learned about from this video. It‚Äôs bloody ridiculous

Yep

Gubisoft monkies did another fucky wucky?

How surprising... No wait, the other one, expected.

One of them also had (pretty sure the ss guy) I supposed to have a MK17 variant
---
I'm taken aback by the negative comments on this post so far. Siege is a complex piece of software, and it's continuously evolving. Bugs are going to creep into the game from time to time. This is a fact of life. No amount of Q/A can exercise all possible gadget interactions and weird corner cases. It took the community months to uncover the latest batch of glitches.
---
As for the suggestions offered: Disabling ops is unrealistic. We're talking about at least 12 operators here, and many are absolutely crucial for defending most sites in the game. Disabling the deployable shield is more plausible, but depending on how the game code is structured, this might not be a straightforward task. It could be the case that fixing the underlying issue is comparable in the amount of time and effort needed.
---
Acknowledging the glitches is a two-edged sword. On one hand, it might comfort the small fraction of the player base that frequents Reddit. On the other hand, it might give those glitches more publicity. After all, once you hear about a glitch, you're one YouTube search away from reproducing it.
---
Like you, I'm frustrated with the current state of the game, and I haven't played in a week (even though I usually play daily). However, it's unclear to me what Ubi can do here. Sometimes, fixing bugs on the same day just isn't feasible.
---
Yeah I think so. IQ does something that leaves her model stuck somewhere and walks around invis, so that sounds like it
---
How did all these glitches come out around the same time.
---
Hmmm i totally smell it
---
Operation health 3
---
Disabling a character works fine tho in other Games where People can pay real money for them too. Just look at lol for example.
---
They can't because of engine limitations, that's what they've said in the past.
---
Whether you want to believe them or not is up to you.
---
That's the smell of fried potatoes
---
I totally agree it is annoying playing against diamonds and plats while my team is unranked. Not saying diamonds and high level ranks can‚Äôt play casual they should be separated within their level like Golds-Diamonds paired and everyone else and below maybe but they should just separate them with matchmaking. Because it‚Äôs not fun to play if you die in 3 seconds against 1.5kd+ people
---
good idea, but ubi will totes fuck it up
---
As Epi stated a while ago disabling or removing an Operator would lead to other issues, and these would significantly sacrifice the stability of the game. This is why Ubi don't want to remove Operators or gadgets when a glitch is discovered, and instead focus on fixing it.

Not really anymore. She has been nerfed many times. Her Scorpion has as much recoil as a dildo filled truck that falls of a cliff and her Grzmots aren't really that useful anymore. UNLESS you either use the FO12, which is a good semi auto or you 3rnd burst fire the scorpion aswell as familiarizing with it's recoil pattern. Otherwise, look elsewhere, such as smoke, bandit or lesion.

Why is jackal below S tier? He has I believe the second best assault rifle, a breaching shotgun, smokes, and an ability that is almost always useful. Easily an S tier operator.
---
I pray there is a hot fix soon. If we have to wait 3-4 weeks for a patch of this I‚Äôm leaving siege for a while.
---
Wish reporting people actually did something
---
The hostage one has been around for a while now, I first encountered it last month. The clash one is just the shield glitch but better, and IQ can be invisible because reasons. IQ has been around for a week or so and clash and shield are a couple of days since they exploded. Thankfully people don‚Äôt know how to use the IQ one or even know about it for the most part but considering the frustration of players atm I would guess it‚Äôs not long before that comes to the forefront as people get more agitated and see more problems.
---
danish operator can phase through the floors
---
Every time I see shit like this I expect it to be PC cause that's where you have more control over the program, but it's always console XD wtf.
---
People need to just move to siege pc lol.
---
They disabled hibana when she came out, completely broke the game for a lot of people, as in couldn't even log in, im surprised people have forgotten this.
---
New IQ glitch, along with deployable shield/clash shield glitch. A lot of people are abusing the shit out of it. I wouldn‚Äôt play any ranked until this gets fixed.

You have much crazier shit happening in Tom Clancy's game, like a rogue agency taking control of the White House.

BTW I don't think Hereford Base is that defended in reality, just look at this : https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1259162/Google-Street-View-shows-secret-SAS-base-major-security-breach.html
---
Frankly, even in reality, I'm pretty sure a small team of the best tactical unit in the world could take over ONE building. An empty training building on top of that. So if they had security clearance in the first place (maybe it's the first thing they did as rogue agents), it's basically a walk in the park.
---
It's a reference to Avengers Endgame.
---
^ This 100% Siege is bringing Ubi big bucks and asking for a stable playing experience in a game where several quality control measures are missing is something that will rightfully piss off people who put lots of money and time into this game. This isn't some amateur dev team we're talking about here. Three years into the game and having glitches and exploits like this constantly appear/reappear is unacceptable.
---
This game is a joke, literally unplayable.

---
I have a theory, it looks like the eye of a hurricane and Ubi said that they want to do more events. What if we got like a natural disaster type event.
---
It's honestly probably a problem with how they wrote in the operators. It seems to scream out that there is some hardcoded values related to the operators that shouldn't be. I'd figure that they'd want to grab operators from the database as a load so its easy to add/remove them, but it doesn't seem like that's the case (again, no idea why) which leads to a ton of side-effects whenever an operator needs to be disabled
---
I hate this glitch
---
Only disable the deployable shield gadget and clash for now. That's not quite a big as impact but still remedies for now.
---
Hello and welcome to Reddit, please don't do whatever it is you're doing.
---
Nope.
---
people who exploit ARE cheaters, just not hackers.
---
&gt; also hacked 1k lootboxes into everyones profile, like the COD-Robin Hood)
---
It would be nice if R6 hackers gave everybody 1k Alpha packs --other impossible to get packs too-- along with loads of R6 credits instead of cheesy ass wallhacks, aimbots, and speed glitches. /kinda\_s   
---
 I supposed this is proof that Siege community is more toxic than CoD community.
---
Yay gamebreaking glitches!!
---
Also I swear fucking Frost Mats are the best anti-cheat in this game lmao
---
ah so you're just a troll. You're right, im an idiot for taking your bait
---
the game has lost 1/3 of it's player base since same time last year... even worse it now is at 40k on steam which must be the lowest in years

---
No eta yet on the glitches mentioned in the original post.
---
Are you saying my comment is incorrect?
---
Honestly me and my friends said the exact same it‚Äôs so annoying
---
Might as well just disable clash at that point. You've removed her primary and her gadget so why not just disable her altogether
---
no, we just randomly got everyone to 5k
---
I don‚Äôt wanna solo queue and when I‚Äôm in a team, we‚Äôre only ever two or three, so I just play casual. You behave like casual is ranked with your ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk to us‚Äù schtick. Mute them and nut up, you said yourself its casual - you aren‚Äôt losing anything of value by keeping a random on the team. All you‚Äôre doing is ruining someone else‚Äôs spare time.
---
When the whole team roams... 
---
He thought you were on team blue most likely.  Probably did see you drop in but it didn‚Äôt click.
---
Because it's common sense. But Ubisoft just don't care for some reason. It's mental.
---
You can do more with exploits than you ever could with hacks, and they don't do anything about it. No wonder people will jump at the opportunity every single time if there's no punishment for it.

I understand but rb6 will not react on that I try this so many thines because of other glitches or bugs and that's disturbing that game so much
---
Totally agree. If you‚Äôre gonna do it for fun then do it in a private lobby with friends, not online where renown and exp are involved.
---
re-instaled it today and removed it in less than an hour again due to server issues (again) seems like all game makers/hosts are cutting costs these days
---
The Witcher 3
---
I agree, it shouldn‚Äôt be a full on permaban to do something that the devs have allowed to exist in the game, regardless of it being a bug (excluding cheats that are facilitated with 3rd party software). What about when outback was new and you could repel into the window with the AC unit? It was extremely popular
---
Reminds me of when destiny was able to drive through buildings in PUBG so he started running everyone over. Yeah it ruined the game for some people, but if blueballs entertainment had their shit together it wouldn‚Äôt have happened in the first place.
---
"A different way to play" fuck me.

Let's have someone do this glitch in a Pro League match eh? We'll see how people respond to that.
---
Thank üíö get back to me when theres an ETA üëÄüëÄ

Props for not abusing that horrid glitch
---
lol just like being toxic

Just play on outback

Garrys Mod Trouble in Terrorist Town

Castle is where he is because of his ability to stop rushes, tachanka is only D because of his lower level play

Mine‚Äôs did the same. I just did something else for a while and then came back to it. It worked but, from the things I‚Äôve seen, I believe it‚Äôs from high ping... (I might be wrong)
---
Fuck the renown booster; I want my 800 elo back
---
Can you take your dick out of ur mouth?
---
I'm all for that too to be honest but if the stupid rule is something about people paying money for her and Ubi temp removing her then this would be the way around it. 
---
To note: I've bought the season passes every time and wouldn't care if they disabled ops anytime there are game breaking bugs like this because at this point I'd rather not even play then have to deal with it.
---
Also displaying his brains above there

Im honestly trying to make this perfect so im changing it based on suggestions

That's why I don't play siege as much as I used to

A post has been added just now regarding the glitches

Enemy: good look shooting my head when I do the shield glitch

Ash: good look shooting my head if I don‚Äôt have a head shot hit box

If you don't like it don't watch it. And please stop jerking yourself off because you are part of "pC mASteR RaCE"

I ran into a Jager using the shield glitch a few days ago. Can someone explain to me whats happening? I havent played consistantly the last few weeks due to work and travel.

For real? Frost and Ying get fucking shotgun skins and then smokes skin is on his smg? Wtf is this shit

OP: \*plays Uno reverse card\*

I know probably who you are talking about. And i disagree with you, yes, it is unfair and fucked up that you teach people how to do it. But the more people catch onto it in smaller pieriod of time, the more attention from ubi it gets (as well as tells ubi how people actually achieve those glitches)

There's one for clash?
---
Did they fix the glitches?
---
Oh wow so that's what happened to me in THunt as IQ a few days ago, I was really confused since I was stuck with only a crosshair and no character model at spawn but somehow could "shoot" (ammo went down) and move since somehow I moved to a spot where the Terries could shoot and kill me.
---
But I don't know how people kill others this way since I had no control of the camera, nothing moved and I only saw the view my character saw at initial spawn.
---
Agreed, as much as I wanted to go into ranked I didn't. Played casual until I just couldn't take it anymore then went to Apex.
---
youo cant get banned fooor glitch , so no its cheating
---
Yeah mate in diamond ranked, why would you need to boost in diamond elo?
---
No idea. I agree, looks creepy... Did someone put that there?
---
Console aim is actually almost the same as PC aim. Wanna know how? Because dipshits use mnk on console
---
Horrible analogy, pretty sure ubi doesn‚Äôt ban for glitches AKA it‚Äôs not ‚Äòillegal‚Äô.
---
Gold 2 isn't even that high, but that's also why the uncertainty is so high at the beginning and then adjusts as time progresses. This game is highly team based anyways so individual performance at higher ranks means nothing if you don't work well as a team.
---
Risk of Rain 2
---
r6 has the same recoil system now (they copied fixed recoil patterns from cs). the only difference is that in CS you need to be still for your gun to be accurate. and yea cs looks pretty simplistic, but its a competitive FPS game, so graphics arent high on the priority list.
---
Mhmm

YES! idc what everyone says about Blackbeard being balanced, just because he was nerfed many many times doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs balanced, because in case you didn‚Äôt realize, when you need multiple headshots to die in a one-shot headshot game, that‚Äôs basically cheating

You considered getting a punching bag? I feel that would help you alleviate your unneeded stress. This is a complex game and because of that it has complex issues that require complex fixes. Don‚Äôt worry about it so much, instead of putting your anger towards them out it towards something worthwhile.
---
Not to frost mats
---
Diamond skin to flex. It does look ugly it‚Äôs just a flex though. Otherwise grab alpha packs. I‚Äôm on a 2nd account now, after all the money I put in on my main account I‚Äôm just grabbing alpha packs and the diamond skin.
---
I thought it was Russian thank you for the clarification, I would give you gold if i could
---
No one talks about how the colors on each op is the color of the team they‚Äôre on
---
Oh it‚Äôs gonna look like shorty tin foil, but you gotta flex on the other team so you might as well get it
---
Operator skins? Your main maybe
---
Because that‚Äôs the team colors, orange is defense and blue is attack

Make plays not excuses

With this train of thought If you found a dollar on the ground someone dropped you just committed theft and should be locked up forever (unless you pay bail)

Typical  J√§ger main
---
For what, Siege to die off, or to fix the bugs?
---
Also Dead by Daylight. It's gotten to a point I've stopped playing it due to BHVR's shit and how every fucking update introduces new bugs and they can't implement any new features and fix properly
---
Lol what a memer
---
Lmao
---
"hm pizza or pasta today?"
---
It's so bad. At least this one has some fucking color! Wind bastion was just blah and brown. They should have updated menu screens though.
---
No need to remove them. Just disable 'advanced gadget deployment' which is required to do the glitches.....
---
There is no platinum 4 you idiot
---
Why are people obsessed with dokkaebi
---
Yeah G2 isn‚Äôt very high, but it‚Äôs high for someone who is usually copper/bronze. Which is what I‚Äôm saying. 
---
I just mean that since it‚Äôs teambased you basically just get fucked by RNG matchmaking. Like half my NA games no one will give callouts except me. It‚Äôs just cancer. Plus leavers. Like ranked in this game is barely above casual to me. 
---
Like you shouldn‚Äôt be able to get Plat by actually just having lucky placements. Which is very possible right now.
---
WEU servers? Having the same problem with my mates.
---
J√§ger was cosplaying your friend?! Sweet!

'more female' gridlock looks like straight from a random asian mmorpg
---
They should though.
---
Yeah same here man, cannot bear to play this game anymore, probably won't come back till next season. Just playing battlefront 2 even though its not great and has problems itself, or borderlands goty.
---
Its an in-game glitch affecting all platforms. gtfo
---
&gt; Are these on console as well? I don't think I've run into them yet
---
OP's video is from console.
---
I think they wanted to do a event for each season (cant remember where i got that from). For Y4S1 we got the april fools, So no nuke event in that season even though it could have been cool
---
Mordhau, Insurgency Sandstorm, Hunt: Showdown.
---
This is terrible logic though.
---
The main point is that we are not implementing some law which requires all bug fixes to be handled in the same manner.  Using it as a example as how it could affect other problems is irrelevant because we can address other problems when they pop up.  We do not have to apply this temporary fix to other problems.  I hate the idea that "well maybe something worse happens later and this solution isn't a great fix so we should do nothing now".  Sometimes doing nothing is a fine response.  Most of the time taking the easy solution to a problem is the better path.  They temporarily address some of these issues.  They don't, but they could.  They have shown they can take items away from some ops and give them to others.  Throw in a change of loadout for OPs and done.  Does it solve all of the problems? No, but you can deal with some of them.  They don't want to do it because it costs them money to push out shit like this so they want to minimize their patches.
---
Also, some of this shit,notably the deployable shield have been problems basically every season.  I don't even think they need to temporarily ban it, I think they need to full on remove it.  They can't make it work without some bug popping up every couple of months.  It was a fun idea, but it isn't working out well.  Sometimes you have to cut your losses and admit a mistake.
---
I think Kaid is commander from a video I saw about him.
---
Had this the other night. Other team started with only 2 players, obviously won the round and gained 3MMR, so worth my time, then the next game I get clash glitches and -73MMR. So awesome
---
Dang. I'll wait another week but if things are still broken I'm giving up on siege
---
It's a separate gamemode, not a warm-up centre
---
What a gaymer
---
We should take bets on how long they take to fix these. Next season?
---
Admitidly.... these glitches require a specific number of steps which a normal player wouldn't do. Picking shit up, putting it down again, picking shit up, doing a 360, putting shit up again (not the actual steps). 
---
I would imagine these glitches would be very difficult for a QA team to find.
---
Once again, I don‚Äôt know why people are speculating the operator in the water to be Nokk. I mean I guess they kinda look the part, but they have the orang light while the one standing has the blue light, and we all know Nokk is supposed to be an attacker.

Hello undeadghillie02, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bonc7b/rainbow_six_siege_offers_the_most_tactical/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Not seen it a single time on pc, got 1k+ hours
---
amazing concept! looks actually real! hats off to you, man
---
another idea i have for this: last played defender on left, last played attacker on right, most played operator in middle
---
But an exploit can be done unintentionally, and they have no way of distinguishing ‚Äúgame broke itself‚Äù from ‚Äúplayer broke game‚Äù
---
Sadly, some of my friends doing those glitches justify themselves by "Everybody is doing it, so might as well do it", which is obviously a fallacy. Nothing much to do against it, other than repeatedly discourage their use.
---
Can only hope they fix it soon enough.
---
How do u get the operator names next to yalls name
---
That‚Äôs what most people use it as
---
Waaah waah
---
Invitational
---
I'm 100% in favor of a mode with respawning recruits or whatever roaming a map so I can practice my aim, make it give no renown just no C4, Bombers or the flinching that's unique to terrorist enemies.
---
They should disable the glitchy operators
---
Feel ranked on PS4 is mostly luck if ur smurfing or not.
---
It is quite an impact for a percentage of players.
---
I missed a few which I‚Äôm gutted about but hey ho
---
Theres a reason thats one of the only times they've done that is cause it causes more bugs and problems behind the scenes
---
t-hunt it is then‚òùÔ∏èüòê
---
Everyone is suggesting mordhau. I‚Äôm going to have to check it out
---
tarkov is an interesting game to try
---
That last clip at the end, fuck that glitch. Had to deal with two spawnpeekers using that shield plus a clash shooting through her shield as well. If u use glitches or cheats in a game, your trash, please disconnect from the game and rethink your life. U have no say in anything related to gaming. Let us enjoy our game in peace
---
If you're getting consistently reported for glitching it's safe to assume that they're doing it purposefully.
---
agreed
---
I‚Äôve been overwhelmingly convinced that I need to check out Tarkov and Mordhau
---
yeah but. even longer wait time
---
Oh yeah for sure dude, free easy way to rank up. It does suck right now.
---
https://youtu.be/I4y5r8zYhzY
---
Here is how to do.
---
Edit: By the way this bug provides almost 0 advantage when performed as you cannot use or pick up the first turret. And placing the second one removes the first.
---
What about Sledge, Mute, Smoke, Thatcher, Ash, Thermite, Pulse, Castle, IQ, Fuze, Gridlock, Mozzie, BlackBeard, Valkyrie, Buck, Frost, Echo, Jackal, Lesion, Vigil, Lion, Clash, Maverick and Nomad?
---
What do they mean?!
---
Beware the Hall Monitor lady.
---
Fuck DBL Online
---
I have pretty good luck just strafing and keeping my sights on their head. As soon as they drop their shield it's a headshot. Works more often than not for me.
---
well for one the art team that creates cosmetics does not fix glitches and also this elite skin was a made a long time ago the whole thing leaked months ago and they only just released it now
---
to think we narrowly avoided this becoming a game-wide problem when ubi had the stupid idea to censor siege and merge versions.
---
Nah I can't deny that. It does allow me to aim when I'm crouch peaking and stuff. But that's nothing compared to what he's accusing me of. Anyway hopefully I'm getting my wrist sorted soon. So I can switch to pc in a couple of months anyway once that's done.
---
Fuck you guys, games fucked. Will be a huge drop in player base.
---
Yeah it's ridiculously insane now in ranked for PS4. I'm low gold right now and every defensive round I'm up against a Clash and a Jager. Funny enough it's only them two with kills every time.
---
How do they understand anything with everyone screaming over everyone else?
---
This is why I'm on a rainbow six break
---
I'm in
---
They call her ash because she‚Äôs jewish
---
Ubisoft gave a warning that entailed defenders needing to reinforce the hatch on the same level as the objective. That being said, orange watch is probably an attacker capable of moving up through hatches.
---
Fuckin ubisux
---
This game is and will always be trash!
---
Yeah it's currently happening on PS4.

He was.

I recently heard about this glitch. Ubisoft is working on patching it, but exploits are always tricky
---
You can also use the Xbox app and download it onto your phone
---
I know, sorry. I'm just so triggered at the current state of the game :'(
---
To be fair, wouldn't the bugs being abused this much help them pinpoint the exact cause for these issues quicker?  
---
I'm just talking out of my ass but still curious
---
I too think their shield is deplorable.
---
Stop
---
Sorry if it sounded rude. I'm pretty triggered as well.
---
No, a win for the entire community would be being able to play a game that fucking works. You know a game we've payed for. Fucking fuming at the state of the game right now.
---
Doesn't work on PC, at least with mouse and keyboard.
---
How dare projared divorce that pupper
---
Yeah r6 is litteraly unplayable,even in casual..
---
They already have a system to selectively disable choosing an operator -- the pick and ban system. Using the methods from this may not be trivial, but it's obviously possible
---
A quick look over the stats tell you that no, the game has not lost 1/3rd of the player base since last year. Also, are you that amazed that when the servers are down and people cant play for a day theres a drop in numbers on that day?
---
Hello tjdeignan,
---
Should be Donald Trump
---
Just keep playing and when you die and fuck up learn from it.
---
And this is the exact answer/opinion/two cents most of the "community" gives. The game is coded in certain way and some of its functions cant be removed, fixed, etc.
---
Nigga that's not blue, that's burple.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty good guess considering the previous seasons and that the reveal is this Sunday/Saturday
---
One thing I can say though. It doesn't stop potato aim. He accused me of MnK when I potatoed so hard it was unreal. I missed 110 bullets with caps lmg and he still accused me of MnK when I killed him. I just started laughing at that point.
---
Bruh just played a ranked and their whole team shield and clash glitched. I‚Äôm too furious and ubi rn.
---
I just wanna know how Ubisoft keeps reintroducing old glitches and breaking stuff. Montagne had this same glitch and the J√§ger shield glitch is also back. My friends played a match of Oregon and the kill cam showed them getting killed from someone outside. They were in laundry room.
---
How, you can only buy standard ones with renown. It‚Äôs the special event ones that cost money.
---
Yeah they have such good operators but only use them to sell packs which is a shame. Outbreak was like a window to what could have been.
---

like a tank shell deflecting from a tiger tank

If anyone dose any of these glitches delete your game and never play the game again your obviously to trash you have to glitch to get a kills

Lmao stop opening your scire tab every 2 seconds

Maybe every 2-5 levels?

What bias?

clash is a piece of shit and i despise anyone who plays her.

Level 1,189 anyone?

Oh yeah. It's hands down the best game on console right now. It has no competition which is also annoying because it's mega broken. The community has gotten so toxic over the past 3 years aswell. I'm expecting to get a ban from PSN now because I called him a "moron" for thinking I was MnK after I just did a 1440 spin. The game desperately needs an operation health 2.
---
Ironically frost has the actual bear traps
---
Just got killed by an invisible Ash. WTF have you released? Is there any sort of QA before you release your patches? This is absolutely ridiculous!
---
&gt;don‚Äôt have the power to delete whatever YouTube channel that they want
---
Of course they don't? This is about banning him from the game. They could ban him, and anyone who abuses this exploit deliberately. Will send a clear message.
---
I‚Äôve been really enjoying Overwatch again.

I know it has a rep of toxicity but honestly either I‚Äôm blinded by Siege or it‚Äôs just a locale thing.

I‚Äôm having a good time and leaving gaming sessions when I want instead of ‚Äúbetter quit while I‚Äôm ahead‚Äù

I mean it‚Äôs scummy but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs as bad. After all there are no bugs, only hidden features

I‚Äôd argue getting aced on by someone who can shoot through their shield makes the lobby more toxic

I'm honestly thinking of giving up siege till Ubi fixes this. It's one of the worst bug and glitch floods that siege has ever seen and this (my fourth gold 1 season) was gonna be the one I hit plat. Well... was gonna hit plat...
---
Finally someone who agrees!
---
He‚Äôs taking a nap
---
Well Ubisoft didn‚Äôt confirm it was some guy on Reddit
---
Tbh the enemy team had a glitching clash who got team killed for it. But my dude only got one kill and got taken off guard and died.
---
my money is on option B
---
You are in the wrong you idiot, why would we let a hacker continue and duck up everyone else‚Äôs time
---
I've been playing since operation health, and I JUST learned you can shoot open a hatch...
---
If your taking about operators being quarantined, then that is only in ProLeague.
---
Why they thought the addition of an extended barrel on a semi-automatic shotgun was a good idea is beyond me

---
Too bad there's no punishment for abusing glitches
---
Well a youtuber can hide their gamertag and stuff when they upload a video so they don‚Äôt know who to ban
---
Yh boi
---
is it fixed already? i tried it on a custom game and it didnt work and i had to update the game
---
Holy fuck, that is fucking sad with how often shit breaks in this game. Was curious about coming back but man fuck, ubi is still as incompetent as ever.
---
No. I‚Äôm not in the wrong. I just think different than you lmao. Idgaf about the other team. They‚Äôre literally the *enemy team* of course I wanna fuck them up. It‚Äôs a game and I wanna have fun lel. There‚Äôs no right or wrong it‚Äôs who cares about the other team and I don‚Äôt
---
It seems to be that the playermodel and player become separated so when the player moves around and whatnot there's no model for them so the game doesn't render them at all.  When they step on a frost mat the model gets updated and so they can be seen again

Buddy...the OP is talking about what Operation Health is. The responder was telling him it was the worst season ever. The OP then said he was being biased since the OP asked for what it was, not how people felt about it

Are people exploiting this glitch reportable for toxic behaviour? Is submitting video footage worth it, is it something that breaches terms of service?

No, I won‚Äôt wine. Cause I learned the glitches myself and whenever it‚Äôs against me I do it back. Modern problems require modern solutions. Get a grip. And what‚Äôs R6 hell? I‚Äôm having a hell of a lot of fun rn if that‚Äôs what you mean, so thanks!

YOU'LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE *puts pun to head*

I think you got something mixed up there. She is no model. Neither profession nor personality wise. The concept art of hers used the image of areal Korean model though which is probably what you were thinking about.
---
I‚Äôm just not gonna play the game. Shame cause this is one of my favorite games. But if it‚Äôs really gonna take months to get things fixed, I‚Äôm moving on.

You killed a random because he didn‚Äôt go recruit with you? Toxic...

Ah yes, you can learn against a shielded enemy shooting through the shield, and I know won‚Äôt wine, you will Whine. No one else is having fun you toxic piece of shit

As a genuine clash main I‚Äôm offended but it‚Äôs funny when I play clash with no hacks and people run in fear
---
Please tell me this glitch is back.. why have they not fixed this?? It's been what.. 4 years!?

Sounds like you need a better gaming chair?

Most online games are heading on toxic downwards spiral. Its quite awful to watch

He‚Äôs also not a billion dollar company

I've been playing this beautiful game since Operation Blood Orchid and you know, the game has been (and ultimately still is) through some hardships along the way. Blitz shield glitch, Deployable Shield (same as we have right now) and Reinforcement-Man glitches, planting outside Service Entrance in Coastline, hardbreach sound issues, Tachanka glitch. We've seen a lot, really. 
---
But today, this game's health is in its worst. We have 3 game breaking bugs. Which is unacceptable considering this game is in its fourth year. How you manage to bring even bigger new problems with every update is beyond me. Granted, you can't play the game because of this matchmaking error occuring in all of Europe. 
---
Ubisoft, this is not your first game as some indie developer. You've been in this business for 20 years, a multi-billion worth company that has worked on triple-A titles for countless times. Seriously, what the hell?
---
Carl you should take the impact grenade I was about to throw at that wall and eat it.
---
I remember when I first got on people on my team helped me learn the game, but now when new people get on the get team killed.
---
Way ahead of ya
---
are you not aware that there are separate teams for bug fixes and content? operation health 2 would not help patches come any quicker. use the search bar before posting

I understand where you're coming from, but wouldn't it be better if this channel didn't provide a TUTORIAL for the glitch, instead of simply pointing out the issue?
---
agreed, it‚Äôs bad right now.
---
I love this game, but these constant glitches make the game unplayable. Kids using the glitches and then trolling about it, its ridiculous. I have never seen a game with so many problems over and over. Its sad. I am sure it won't get patched for a while, since thats how it always seems to be with Ubisoft. Pathetic.
---
We're getting pick and ban next season for ranked anyway so if there's an operator with a glitch we can ban them not the most optimal but it could help more matches by the time a patch comes
---
Tbh its not just rainbow. I think its just gaming as a whole thats on a downwards spiral.
---
I only play bomb but I joined my friends lobby and it put us in a hostage game and got deranked from plat
---
They don't ban anyone ever. Its a joke. This game is trash with glitches like these.
---
Probably your fucking will to live, filthy reposter
---
You can also still fall down a hatch completely silent.
---
This game has so many issues right now.

Wait until you run into IQ. She stands outside the building and somehow one shot kills you anywhere you are.

Nice to meet you konner

Hey, ranked is "beta". /s

A little kid achieved that within a few seconds did more than I could in 160+ levels. Feels bad man

You made use of an indirect link to an album hosted on `imgur.com`.

Please be considerate of mobile and RES users, and re-submit linking to the proper location. Try replacing `gallery` with `a` in the URL, check if the link works correctly, and submit that link.

Not hacks, just a stupid, spaghetti coded bug.
---
Still some hope in the community after all I suppose
---
You're talking about a physical copy of the game right? Don't know where's the problem. My cousin bought a physical copy and he has the ability to change the language to English in the options of the game. Never really heard that there's a problem with not being able to change this.

You used to get detected in the church doorway on club house

 Nice to meet you Linx!

Big brain plays. GG

Currently Plat 2 (been plat 1 flirting with diamond most of the season) today I've already ran into 2 matches with invisible IQ and Clash glitchers. Seems to be fairly common right now at least on PS4 in the upper ranks. Gonna just cut my losses and accept this rank for this season unless the glitches are fixed before season end which I doubt will happen.
---
Hahaha this is one of the funniest siege clips I have seen, thanks for sharing.
---
Next year, then they‚Äôll reappear in the next year as they always do
---
Also pro league isn't dropping in views either. Siege is in a good state popularity and population-wise... sadly the same cannot be said of the game itself.
---
I suggested this about a year ago and got a lot of hate hope this goes another way
---
In my opinion, the best thing to do it put them in a special pool. They can only play with other known or suspected exploters/cheaters. This way they are none the wiser and cheaters play with cheaters which the honest players play with the honest players.

&gt; legal problems. 
---
They have absolutely NO obligation to maintain the permanent and constant use of operators that are purchased with fake currency (and ya, even R6 credits are fake currency, even if you can only get them with real currency). They hold all rights to change, modify, add, or remove things deemed necessary (by them) for the state of the game.
---
there's an invisible IQ glitch now? wth is going on with this game
---
I wonder which server were u in.
---
I have my opinions on Ubisoft, as of their years on console but especially in the last 4 years or so about releasing games that have KNOWN issues even still in the beta. They've gone down quick in my mind because of these issues and then rushing to release their "next big game".. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I mean just insta lock her then change last second. That's what i do when someone goes castle and completely bungles the objective.
---
what is the new friendly fire system on siege can someone pls tell me
---
Just leave the game, stupid
---
Man i hate it when people do this and then complain when you report them. "Its not hacking bro. Its just a glitch."
---
Literally my experience every tome i give it a shot after a month ir two break. Reminds me why i keep leaving it

It should be

I just died inside a little bit

Oh, and let‚Äôs give the shotgun to a three-speed whose gadget is made to disorient and slow down attackers while we‚Äôre at it.
---
My pet peeve is when Kaids put there claws dead center in the middle of the reinforced walls, you provide no challenge for maverick when he has to look for the electro claw if they have no thatcher
---
You don't have the right to have access to each operator you paid for (with fake currency) forever. That's insane. Why do people keep saying this? If they decide to end the game and close the servers by the end of this year, they can.
---
Games shut down their servers temporarily for fixes quite often. That removes access to the game you PAID for... but it doesn't matter. Same goes with temporary disabling of operators. Hell, same goes with if they chose to permanently remove an operator like Lion.

I think you need to get some friends on Siege, my boy.

R4C shouldn‚Äôt have an acog anyway

I‚Äôm sorry I knew the conversation that happend but I just wanted to make sure you were aware that it was a glitch. I know people have mod menus on  fortnite and call of duty.

Yeah, couldnt agree more. Ordinary CN players also hate these hackers. They ruin everyone's gaming experience, including oridinary CN players like us.

That title wasn‚Äôt lion

I personally think the bundle is pretty good, but I don‚Äôt know why Finka isn‚Äôt using [this headgear](https://www.reddit.com/r/R6SiegeFashionAdvice/comments/bgku6w/new_calamity_finka_bundle_0423/) as it‚Äôd match more with Lion.

you should save for new ops, just so you can instant lock them. It makes people mad sometimes, I enough it

5/7 games people were glitching today, somehow we won 6/7 but it still sucks, but gonna play anymore until they fix it

no. now quit with these annoying posts

Great

That's for patches. A hotfix doesn't need that. I know Destiny is a game that frequently updates and fixes their game without having to go through platform approval every time.
---
Does Sony still charge for every patch upload? Can't remember if they kept that with the PS4 or removed it. What a stupid restriction on Devs.

Personally I'm fine with the other modes having ranked versions, but I just wish they all had separate ranks considering how different they are.
