You're playing casual
---
---
---
ITS IN OUR MIND
---
So will I be able to equip the skins I got for mozzie and gridlock again?
---
It's Mr. Bear
---
There‚Äôs also the forgive part of it as well isn‚Äôt there?
---
He took some of the acid ubi had while making the gamemode
---
Go to your post, share it and it should say crosspost on reddit. Then post it on r/R6OperatorCreator 
---
oh 
---
mine hasnt been working this afternoon either... my friends isnt either... but not everyone is having the same issues... there are a few guys in my games that say its fine for them...
---
You mean the prettiest gentleman 
---
B E T R A Y A L
---
The turns have tabled
---
Ironic.
---
But that ISN'T what trap means unless it is being misused. It was used properly in this case and people still found a way to be offended by it. There was absolutely no context here that trap was being used to refer to a trans person. OP probably didn't even know trap could be construed as a slur, since that isn't what the word is MEANT to be used for. 
---
Yeeeeees
---
BROTHER
---
Search around for the sub first next time? Plenty of people have posted and every post is titled as it being a new skin. Yes it's a new skin for this season, no you are not the first to post it.
---
Yeah and no one actually has fun in casual anymore everyone is really toxic.
---
Love it! Would love a mod that makes sims kill each other with guns 
---
Well dont play anymore. I havent played in 2 years but decided to redownload it. I take it in stride. I get kicked,TKed and berated all the time because I use a controller. Look it isnt my fault the PC I play on the most is in the living room and I am 12' from my TV. Well that and my wife and I get a kick out of the children and man children making fools of themselves when they get on the mic. You do you. Ever did lone wolf terrorist hunt? I do that often when I dont want to hear immature clowns take a game too seriously.
---
Stop kink-shaming him. 
---
I‚Äôm gold 3 lvl 64 I started playing about a month and a half ago, I really tried to do my best by watching pro players and youtubers, I honestly was not good when I first started. What i‚Äôm trying to say is don‚Äôt put yourself down. Because your only silver 4, practice and you will do good. 
---
Hey guys! We got a‚ÄùCool Guy‚Äù here? 
---
This was posted three days ago 
---
I found another radio to shoot 
---
Personally prefer kaid but my friends say kaid and the rainbow six commentators say kaid so idk what to call him 
---
I‚Äôm ABS plastic 4 so I definitely can‚Äôt judge
---
i am currently having the issue now... i have restarted my game and it didnt work... im in Discord at the same time... Both mine and my friends arent working for in game
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yes
---
This is so dope! Great job!
---
True
---
I‚Äôm assuming you mean Finka. It depends on your play style and team composition. For pure frags right off the bat, Finka. If you‚Äôre willing to learn how to use her, Ying. Dokkaebi is not a bad choice, I just think the other two are a little better right now 
---
Anti-semetric 
---
What's the new Ying cooking mechanics?
---
I was also cosplaying Dokki that day and honestly this is absolute goals, great work on the details!
---
I was doing a daily and decided to do it as Monty on a realistic t-hunt
---
Get friends lmao.

Was his name fetusyeetus?

Have had this problem for MONTHS. I play on PC and have reported this issue to r6fix long ago and so has many others. I usually run discord in the background. For some reason the communications in R6 seem to crash very often.
---
And maybe for like balancing after a certain amount of time your drone starts auto scanning.
---
I would not want to loose an arrow with an exposed arm like that.... 
---
What don't you understand about "I have plenty of people to play with"?
---
That's a very nice username but i meant the "Ash Main" sign
---
Oof level 213 but silver 2
---
I thinking just like normal prop hunt they should make noises every little while
---
Wasn‚Äôt this posted back when the Invitationals event started?
---
No its like what tachanka does he pulls it out of his ass and sets it down except you dont use he just powers it up and it stays on for 45 seconds before overheating and powering down.
---
u/i-shoud-be-recalled 
---
Any fix? Going through this same thing now. Can't make it past the beginning of round 2.
---
Lol I feel stupid I thought that‚Äôs what you meant....  go to the community page push the 3 dots at the top and click user flair 
---
35 vertical 42 horizontal, lvl 210 
---
kind of sucks but that's okay. as long as you enjoy it
---
The reflex is viable, its just personal preference when it comes to what sight people use.
---
The red dot is viable, its just personal preference when it comes to what sight people use.
---
Very clean
---
But why? Why would you do that?
---
You have some brown on your nose. 
---
No.
---
where?
---
They reversed how her grenades work - before, cooking a Candela would increase the time it takes before it "explodes". Now, just throwing it will make it take a while before "exploding", while cooking it will make it "explode" immediately. It really is a smart and elegant solution to her being a pain to play against.
---
Thanks bro ur the best  &lt;3
---
It is mini sniper. It beats the Scorpion in every way possible, damage, recoil, spammyness, and range kind of. The Scorpion is well meh. But either way Ela is the worst roamer to pick in the game, and is very very mediocre at best.
---
next to capitao and clash
---
Please don‚Äôt kinkshame me. 
---
The back
---
Oh I will.
---
Just a Side note about Zero
---
* Like Tachanka he pulls it out and sets it down but rather than getting on it to use it, he powers it up and it takes 3 seconds to generate.
---
* The PLT (portable light tower) overheats after 45 seconds post set-up and shuts down
---
* It takes 25 seconds to cool down before being powered up again which takes 3 seconds.
---
* The PLT can be picked up and used somewhere else.
---
Lol yup 
---
The other day, 3/4 voted to kick me in the beginning of the match. I ended up as the MVP. This stuff used to bother me, but I enjoy the game otherwise, so I just look for another match. Casual needs to be more casual though.
---
I‚Äôll have to check when I can get on my computer, it won‚Äôt load on mobile right now. This is new for this season too for me so I‚Äôm gonna assume it‚Äôs the same thing.
---
No like I‚Äôm asking you, if he sat on the bus where would he go
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Monty‚Äôs face when he sees the 7 Gu mines but it‚Äôs too late
---
Happy birth day sledge, happy birthday sledge happy birthday to you üéÇ üéÅ üéâ 
---
Well, that‚Äôs good because being kinkshamed is another kink of mine. 
---
I love those announcements. One of my favs is "Please don't shoot the smoke dectors, they are not cameras." 
---
Ok that‚Äôs what I thought 
---
Oh shit oh fuck!
---
c:
---
How about most things in between?
---
I do that all the time too lol keep it quiet I don‚Äôt want a patch
---
Peepeepoopoo man
---
I‚Äôm a bad person
---
EWWW light mode what are you a normie????
---
Mostly
---
D R U G S
---
Not anymore, he was banned.
---
I don't think thats really a thing.
---
Was the whole game in slow motion? 
---
THaTs COnSoLE fOr yoU
---
Remember those dog tag charms we got? I'll take a skin over a charm any day, especially if relatively the same time is going into each. 
---
...it already is? 
---
Usually when someone‚Äôs calling someone trash they‚Äôre talking about their gun play
---
Ok good ^_^
---
You mean willy wonka on acid
---
So you did this just to try and get karma? Really?
---
Guess I‚Äôll die
---
*gunshot,fade to black*
---
Is it? I don‚Äôt remember it being there.
---
Esports ready.
---
Funny how sorting by controversial shows you the comments that are the most correct in this thread
---
ITS A TRAP
---
Thank you!
---
Leading countries? Leading in what, exactly? 
---
It is. If the playlist is still up, take another look around bud. 
---
Well yeah. These are worse, but... The IQ elite is still bad.

"It was naptime for Mr. Bear. Naptime... Forever."

"Well... who'd known there was so much stuffing inside poor Mr. Bear?"

hostage is the juggernaut

5v1
---
That book is amazing and also I really want a hospital map in ranked if you‚Äôve read it you‚Äôd know why
---
And that's still 1 extra loot box they are encouraging people to buy.
---
So your approach is all wrong. They don't expect anyone but whales and idiots to buy all 16. They are looking for people who will gamble for the skin they want after not getting the one they want after 2 days. 
---
you missed
---
*Take back everything we've lost!* 
---
No how they killed me
---
Even worse!
---
Imagine being in his position. He spent so much of his life taking the education and training required  to join the GIGN, do so well that you are removed from it and put into one of the most secretive and effective task forces in the world then they mock you by equipping you with a pretty pink butterfly helmet that you might just die wearing because of the nature of his job. 
---
If they did that the game would snap in half and nobody would be able to play due to bugs.
---
You have to hit the person to kill them.
---
I still can believe he has a canon beard
---
Well I hope it stays 
---
Devs lying to gamers again because it doesn't make them money! Surprise surprise.
---
What's worst that it isn't even all cosmetics included in the event, it's just one pack good for one item.
---
No? It is something I have been experiencing. Didn‚Äôt realize I needed to screen shot my own ‚Äúkicking‚Äù? My bad dude
---
Mean while I‚Äôm over here getting duplicates every pack... 
---
They hit their shots, and you died.
---
Same exact thing happened to me 2v5 we almost won.They played the most toxic ops to play in a 5v2 blitz,Monty,Clash,,fuze,ash, and finka.it really sucks
---
Really? I‚Äôve gotten 99 before lol 
---
That fine print is important 
---
april fools event
---
The record scratch when you open the game is just so perfect
---
How do you get that unlucky 
---
There's two account management pages, one you get to through uPlay and one you get to through the website. Use the website.
---
I just wish they put some kind of pack spinner St the end for the event. It's just a lazy cash grab and I wish they respected their customers more 
---
Not sureüòÇ only happened once lol 
---
this joke has been beaten to death every day for the last 4 years 
---
Players of my skill dont exist. Besides, if you get a team of below average players that solves nothing. 
---
What's your home "servers". I live in Midwest U.S and can connect to north coast, west coast or south coast without too much issue. SC is my usual though. Have a UK pal though and he says EU servers are pretty sweat while U.S is kinda EZ.
---
Not for all games but for R6 i agree it would be a utter disaster unless they added Mouse and keyboard support on consoles along with console and pc cross play (all assuming it happens)
---
CoPyRiGhT
---
Australia is my home server. I find Australian servers to be more difficult compared to US
---
Honestly
---
you buy them with r6 credits
---
"ClUtcH oR KIcK"
---
56 or something like that 
---
excellent work!
---
Ohhhh. Dang. 
---
give format please 
---
That sucks
---
Bet haha the hostage was killin me tho
---
I always swallow my pride and say ‚Äúgr‚Äù after ever round and ‚Äúgg wp‚Äù after every game. It‚Äôs keeps me humble. 
---
What about just a simple text feature like in for honor
---
It really did

Damn nice. Ubisoft sorta favored me today, so i got a nice nitro cell 3k and killed the last dude with a headshot giving me 4 (there wasn't 5 as one had left earlier), got a ace with Frost and finally got Black Ice for one of my mains; Pulse.
---
What do the Sims think of it?
---
To be honest, i hate this event.
---
They literally chose the worst map to do this on.  Is rather have had a barbie dream house type make over.
---
But the crappy lighting and horrible rotations.  Along with stupid op selection and shit hostage sites makes it really bad.
---
3th round
---
I agree with you
---
It's in options under controls. I do like this new way because sometimes you get shot at and cant break animation the old way. 
---
You should be hired as a architect! That‚Äôs what I have to say ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
At least you weren't the guy that got 99 percent 
---
Nice job but why, why would you put a suppressor on the P9 with Monty?! 
---
This wasn‚Äôt a cheat you goober. You just got fucked by the game 
---
by riding the rainbow unicorn and defeating the leprechaun at the end of the rainbow
---
Both are very good. Lion requires good coordination but i think his gun is a little stronger than yings. I would prob go with ying for her ability
---
he shoots a spider like robot, i thought thats where you got the inspiration from 
---
True, 
---
I‚Äôm bout to go to bed man have a good night get wins when you play.
---
Wow :( so dumb
---
Mr homeless did it first
---
I think runouts to secure a kill or to get someone on roof or to snatch a nice snipe or C4 are not toxic as there is risk but is a bit more "sweat" ish but depends on how much they do it and how far they go. If it's to spawn peek then it's toxic.
---
Yong
---
If you look at the video, you can see that a large portion of the defuser is past where the wall was. 
---
Did you know that if you plant on a hatch, and the hatch is destroyed, the defuser falls out of the room and you instantly lose. This is the same effect. The defuser ended up outside the range of the bomb room so you instantly lost.
---
I want it so bad, you have no idea
---
Normally I play with a squad of 3-4
---
Yup
---
I was at 27% today and furious.
---
Not to be confused with Cherry Bebis...
---
We don't drink that here...
---
Oky ^^Ty
---
&gt;Porque no los dos
---
again, while both makes sense, ubisoft has shown its not afraid to get rid of perfectly good stuff.
---
Gridlock*
---
I'd be more than happy if they made each item purchasable, as opposed to having to lootbox gamble.
---
He's a Jager main, what did you expect?

A wild squid appears

First of all, props to you sir, and thank you for your service. Secondly, according to their website the closest to you is German I believe.
---
Yep! Surely there are a lot fewer servers, some maps and gamemodes are rarely played, but there are a few servers that always seem to be populated. A lot of conquest large servers, a few dedicated map servers like Shanghai, Metro, Locker, and a few more different ones. My favorite is an all DLC Rush server. BF4 has never been this much fun for me, even at its height.
---
‚ÄúToxic‚Äù gets thrown around so randomly nowadays smh how is this even toxic
---
You wanna tell us why you think it's a joke first?
---
The detail blows my mind like when you shoot a flower and it cries or you impact a wall it changes the wall to a cartoon explosion or the present with a turtle inside 
---
I read "I'm not crying" and didnt read the rest
---
I killed Mr bear and I got a instant 30 min ban üòÇ
---
Game hasn‚Äôt even been out for half that amount of time.
---
I'm not in the service anymore, I got out year and now I'm just a contractor, but thank you anyways and ty for the info.
---
*dances behind desk in approval*
---
The report button does nothing regardless of platform.
---
FOR MR BEAR!
---
It's highly dependent on your win rate, with a 50% win rate takes an average of 13 games and land around 27% mark. But a win rate of around 10% takes on average 30 games. 
---
There's also a present with a bear in it in the basement obj.
---
We lost 4-5 why would I be mad I don't care much because I literally won the next 3 matches and I don't care if I get banned I don't post much any way 
---
Feel like charms shouldn't be in these premium packs
---
Damn I wanted to make that comment :c
---
Ahh okay! Well hey still, thank you. And yeah of course man
---
Didn't even get to see what they said.
---
Its how it is, yesterday my team got shot throught unbreachable walls a whole match.
---
The guy ended the match with a perfect score...
---
No autoban, so all we were able to do is report for toxic behavior.
---
Btw. Dont try to report ubi hackers and stuff, they dont care :)
---
Outbreak &gt; April Fools &gt; Halloween
---
You have to shoot 40 drones and you have a week. It's obviously doable in that time span but it can be annoying because everyone just goes to hunt drones 
---
Yeah but I cant picture that face with his voice
---
Uh, you sure? Some new stuff just recently broke and you're touting them? Shields are absolutely fucked rn.
---
He was also on the other team.
---
When
---
Every match, I park my drone in front of the first defender I see. So far nobody has reciprocated. PS4
---
man this is hilarious. 
---
Ironsight gives more vision and is immune to Tatcher's mines, if you Bandit Trick often, that's a useful perk.
---
Thank you for doing the research 
---
If we read the bio, the elite set actually aligns with his pranking habit and his work as an undercover agent.
---
I liked it imo. Lot like what I had imagined him to be. 
---
Good job my dude!

144p quality btw

Ima just say lion and nomad are fairly average in casual however in pro league and high level ranked they are stoopid broken lesion is a similar case imo also he gets 7 lesion needs a nerf still imo not a huge one just like making the Gu‚Äôs only 5 or 6 or make it so it can deal a maximum amount of damage before all of its poison is gone
---
Quick question that‚Äôs now related to the post how do you get the thing next to your user that says your main
---
Now I have a reason to play sims.
---
Don't peek unless you have to :) you're on defense, all you gotta do is run out that timer and make them come to you, so don't hand them your life by taking gunfights you don't have to (unless you're reasonably certain you can win them)
---
Play your utility, any intel you can feed a roamer is good intel
---
And don't be afraid to try something new, I personally love very open strats, and tend to open a lot of holes.
---
Launchpad with different tones of the announcers lines
---
you are not using M&amp;K on console are you?
---
How much? 1.25??
---
1.5
---
It starts talking in a language that‚Äôs sounds Korean, yet not the type that Doki Doki girl speaks... you don‚Äôt understand a word, but without thinking Buck answers anyway... 
---
Nigga, stop lyin'
---
I dunno what you are talking about, they got rid of all the toxic people when they banned all the text chat racists on PC, the community is literally perfect!  : \^  )
---
1. Alpha packs are free which are not locked behind a pay well its only these special packs. All characters can be earned fairly easily with renown it‚Äôs not that big of a deal I did it when they were all 25,000
---
2. Greatly reduce is still not 0 and I‚Äôm only talking paid packs which btw you can even buy default packs with money so the only way they can sell packs is through a system like this
---
3. This game needs revenue I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the only way but it‚Äôs a fair one many games do it and are you saying you can only get ops with real money? They don‚Äôt even change the game that much when playing the majority used aren‚Äôt even dlc a lot of default operators are great
---
4. I honestly don‚Äôt know about this, but it‚Äôs not some suits ubi isn‚Äôt a charity they can‚Äôt live off of community love again I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt think either of us are game devs
---
5. Yea well maybe you‚Äôve heard it enough but seriously just cause you hear something doesn‚Äôt make it invalid, plus at least they give you a few free packs which is better than some
---
Also to wrap it up I really don‚Äôt appreciate your condescending tone when responding it came off as very aggressive when I was just trying to make a counter argument. At the end of the day I‚Äôm just tired of hearing ubi bad cause this is a fun event with weird cosmetics that cost money which is fine.
---
Uhh, I'm pretty sure I'd notice that, the wiki says no magnification and I'm going to lean on that, considering I primarily use the holo and haven't noticed a difference compared to the reflex...
---
What system are you even playing on, a day 1 PS4?
---
Oh i was unaware
---
Sounds to me like you got destroyed by them, got hella salty and decided to post here hoping someone can ban them, instead of filing a support ticket.
---
I really wonder if any of these people who defend shields that don't main shields have ever been above plat 3
---
His shield counts as gadget and they think it is fair
---
As a smoke main, do you prefer the shotgun to the smg?
---
Lmao took me a while to figure out what that meant, but no I'm not. Thanks though! High compliment 
---
I would pay money for that
---
Also one last thing about the overwatch model is the fact that you could drop more than 40$ (which is the entire siege collection cost) and still not get a skin you want from the collection so I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good model
---
Doesn‚Äôt surprise me the lesion main is toxic lmao
---
Nah, tf2 is worse. 
---
Obviously you care enough to make a post about it and whine like a little bitch on Reddit while breaking its rules.
---
they looks awesome. really good job mate :) 
---
100%, shotgun, smg-11 is the way to go. Play around with the muzzle attachments, IIRC flash hider will make it pretty manageable, but think tap firing. It's a fantastic gun if you can land your headshots.
---
Are you Korean? Because your writing on the vest looks impressive! (I've tried painting/writing on fabric)
---
[Another version I have as my ingame profile picture](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/856102816335201285/82EF128FEBEA32DDE37709D4395BCEFA3F6DD928/)
---
whats with the mini Trident? I thought they used forks
---
How can I get one of these for pc? Asking for a friend
---
so bandit is tachanka?
---
both
---
Ikr, I had to leave the rest of the thread out because of it.
---
Learn the maps; learn to 'see through walls'. Learn the strategies; learn what the enemies can do and probably will do. put urself in the position of rhe enemy, give callouts, information is key
---
That fucked the fairytale up
---
Dust line, plat 3
---
truly a cav main
---
mess with your sensitivity and do a lot of t-hunt. not just to finish it, but to flick to heads
---
No this is not real it is just an Idea although I do wish it was
---
I mean that would a nice substitute
---
Play the situations before playing casual or ranked to get used to quick reactions and hitting your targets better it gives you a more relaxed view on getting killed and will make you react better when it comes to actually fighting someone 
---
Tachanka is greater than god. How dare you class him so low.
---
Looks awesome dude. Don‚Äôt listen to the asshats.
---
So if one or two still want to fight in the next rounds let s just tk them and then vote surrender. No thanks. That just a #BS
---
Reminds me of back in the old days when you had to work for the ops
---
Perhaps I could practice Cav and Get the upcoming Danish dude. Right now I like being more supportive by sharing intel or scouting ahead with a shield.
---
Yes ik I don‚Äôt do any of that. I have done just a little code but not enough to be even okay at it. But you gotta understand a game like fortnite per say, they come out with weekly updates and fixes. Also bugs are not really the problem. I can deal with a bug for a bit. What I can‚Äôt deal with is the broken operators they take forever to fix when people are pleading for them too. So many people everyday come up with good ideas to fix broken ops but Ubisoft still takes so long.
---
That's just because I have potato aim haha
---
True but you‚Äôre not seeing any more than anyone else. Everything is just larger and more pixelated. I wouldn‚Äôt consider it cheating. 
---
It has an overnerfed mag size and is statistically the worst DMR
---
Support roles are underrated. You can feel the satisfaction as the enemy panics. 
---
People who look for lore in anything lol. You probably were one of those people who uploaded videos of yourself looking for bigfoot in san andreas
---
Mr bear betrays
---
New title: mr betray
---
(if you have played shadow of war you know what i mean) 
---
to protect the lord because the lord himself forget his shield
---
Most important thing for siege imo: 
---
Map knowledge.
---
If you can nail that, then generally the other stuff will come with time. No amount of aiming or reactions will compensate for understanding how a map flows, where to aim to wallbang common spots, which areas are on the other side of a wall etc. If you can visualise what is above, below and around you through the walls, then you have a massive advantage over most players.
---
It looks a bit creepy to me. It reminds me of the lodge from until dawn
---
It's the drug test if the operators can handle mission on drugs
---
I honestly think the aug is a really good rifle...
---
depends on the map tbh
---
It seems like any lore connected to the event will just be that the mother and daughter(?) is the family that used to live on the House map.
---
I don't have any yet and I'm lvl 44
---
What the actual fuck is this 
---
I don't know if you could call me a support player but I do like to take a slower more calculated push. I'm really just hoping that by playing with golds I can improve. My slow paced style doesn't really fit with the 'Meta' in low ranks
---
Kaid is Mr. x confirmed

Awwww look at that cute little thermite making his father proud
---
my friend felt gay and i cant understand why
---
ubisoft you better start making a kids show about this
---
Is siege actually 86 gb now after this? PC/SSD are acting like its fucking massive and it won't load :(
---
Trying my best, they have to stop flat out ignoring the issue someday right?

Bullet proof vest thnx rook

*Oh no* the UwUs are here
---
What if you are a attacker and you destroy your own drones does it count for the callenge?
---
Oh yeah I do understand that it was used before, my point is that idiots have co opted it and now use it to deny people like me their existence 
---
It's Road to S.I all over again. I didn't mind headshots and kills and stuff. But fuck drones, fuck drones in particular! Defender Gadgets are nice because you have at least three ways of destroying them. Drones can have 10 max per round and you gotta hope nobody shoots them before you or they don't escape.
---
Long story short Kills/Headshots yay, Drones nay!
---
That would be amazing on Monty 
---
Would you rather play like a gold player and be stuck being fucked out of wins because half your team leaves in round 2 forcing you to drop into Copper?
---
Fortinte is a far far simpler game than rainbow. There‚Äôs no unique gadgets that affect other gadgets and gameplay in unique ways depending on the map/situation that have to be taken into account. There are different type of guns and health/shield boosts. Child‚Äôs play to fix in comparison. 
---
Yes its fair cause the game was very close.
---
You guys for real, it's the same skin for each operator only with a color change ffs 
---
Hmm... That's strange, because I just picked eight random games from G2 from pro league s9 and the recent invitational and monty was banned/played on every game aside from ones played on consulate.
---
I'd be interested to see where you are getting your pick/ban rates from.
---
They can take my Princess rifle from my cold dead hands
---
Haha yea 
---
He probably knew what he meant he was just using ‚Äúdefenders?‚Äù In a way to try and correct him. People commonly use a question to correct someone when they are confused or if the other person is confused. Calm down buddy.
---
We all knew but thanks
---
Hey there dad
---
If you don‚Äôt want to buy it, don‚Äôt. I have all the operators and I will always get the season pass if I can, I have all the operators, want to know who I main? Bandit and thatcher, trust me you don‚Äôt need the new ops. If you don‚Äôt want to buy it then don‚Äôt buy it
---
Geoff and Jeremy
---
this is cool. my theory is that its the kid of the family of that actual house who idolises the people who came and helped their family(rainbow team) . and being a kid obviously would start to play out these situations. and what ever happened with the presidents plan thats gonna be on the news and the kid is might of seen and so is playing out that situation..
---
In the game story they are just training so it makes complete sense for run outs with no other enemy‚Äôs than the attacker ops.
---
&gt;I love how no one says anything about Siege's ridiculous about of pain content but rages about everything else. Call of Duty released a red dot sight for a measly $1. RHEEEEEE. OMG enough with this microtrasaction bs. Siege releases a simple reskin of a character for $10+. 
---
Call of Duty puts a price tag on every weapon and map, no questions asked (at least anywhere near the content's release).  Battlefield has similar pricing on the DLC content.  Both franchises have also released multiple titles with full AAA price tags since Siege released.  There are also usually ways to purchase performance improving items with cash, creating elements of pay to win.
---
&gt;Want the new operator? Well either fork over the money or grind for about a week. The best part is. This isn't some free to play trash like Fornite. This is full price $40-$60 game. With most of the operators locked.
---
All the base operators are unlocked with the $40 price of the game.  The only operators you will pay extra for are the operators that have come out post launch, over the past nearly three and a half years.  And every one of those operators is available to purchase through enough gameplay if you do not want to pay the cash.  But for every operator you purchase with renown, that's money Ubisoft is not recouping on their cost to produce those operators.  You're expectation seems to be that Ubisoft should pay to maintain the servers and produce more content in perpetuity without ways to make up that cost.
---
Yes, if cosmetics are the main content additions you are most excited about, the Siege pricing model is not very consumer-friendly.  But if you care mostly about the operators, weapons, and maps, there is only one other game that comes anywhere close to as consumer-friendly of a model in the AAA shooter space, and that's Overwatch (and Blizzard puts out FAR less content per year than Ubisoft does with Siege).  If Siege were an Activision or EA property, we'd likely already be on Siege 3 (with Siege and Siege 2 coming with $60 base price tags) and $10-$15 map packs every 3-4 months.
---
A polish ap needs to happen i agree
---
Imagine being mad over cosmetic items that you can just... Not wear.
---
Then why wouldn't Ela be in it?
---
By that logic, House is Zofias home. Wow those bastards are now going for the Operatives families... 
---
That got dark
---
The new bgm is brainwashing 
---
[removed]
---
No kill it with fire.
---
It's a fucking joke event. All it does is take a break from the normal game, and even then, it's  completely optional to play it. I don't understand how people can be so upset, when they can simply just NOT PLAY IT.
---
Eh ?! That‚Äôs bud ü§ôüèª
---
Well, that's on you.
---
The challenges specify the requirements.
---
This kind of logic is thrown everywhere by people who have not the slightest clue of what they're talking about. 
---
Do you really think there is like one guy named "Tom Clancy" who builds the entire game? 
---
There are different teams working on different projects to be tested and released. The people who know how to design and implement assets into the engine are not the same people programming the engine to do weird shit. It's not a binary schedule where they either do "this" or "that". 
---
&gt; but if they fixed the bugs, hitreg etc.
---
I just love how you guys say shit like this as if you work with development yourself. Yea if they just did THAT instead of anything else like that would be super cool, and they just don't do that, because obviously they are forced to do events and cosmetics, instead of fixing what literally every single fps game dev actually wants. 
---
Enough with this shit.
---
Shotty
---
My friend and I were right. People will get triggered by an april fools event, shame really.
---
Crazy how often this sort of thing comes up. "You better support this game for the next 5 years, but don't you dare try to get another cent out of me despite the 100's if not 1000's of hours of fun you've provided me."
---
\^
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
And still no polish male operators.
---
In what world is this good content
---
Better than getting university for sure

As a french canadian who manage to play with single language self centered young racists americans who comstantly Ask why ¬´¬†american servers¬†¬ª accept orher species of human. Not understandind that ¬´¬†american¬†¬ª stand for the continent, not the country. ( i‚Äôm so fed up with the pathological and Proud ignorance of United staters) 
---
I am asking what is the link between the language and the teamkills? An asshole is an asshole.wathever the language he uses to drop is shit.
---
For your info, i do not count anymore the Number of time i was teamkill just because of my nickname or my accent.

Scorpion
---
PASS THOSE THERMITES AROUND
---
Was fully expecting an /s at the end of this
---
Threading the needle with that one.
---
Yes you should i need it in my life
---
You complaining that they haven't done this sooner? 
---
&gt; TACTICAL focused game and I expect it to remain so
---
And it is not now, because?
---
Really wish they might imitate the csgo system, especially in Ranked. I don't want to play maps that I am poor in.
---
Looking at this thread is aggravating. Imagine getting this much flak for having an opinion.
---
Nobody is even mad about the event itself. I've actually seen zero. The only complaint I'm seeing is that people don't care for the magic pack cosmetics being there outside the event, and this sub is totally ripping people apart for having that perfectly understandable opinion.
---
This happened to me. I aced and couldn‚Äôt (locate) the bomb even though I was looking right at it so we lost. It‚Äôs only happened once though. 
---
Someone should show him what most competitive players looked like in RB6 3 when the meta was to run no armor (full speed) and most people ran with mismatched vibrant colors. 
---
I don‚Äôt think he is going around the nerf because he‚Äôs just enlarging his screen. The area he is enlarging doesn‚Äôt have any increased quality. He still sees the exact same pixels as any other player. If this is cheating then we might as well ban glasses that people wear to make certain colors more visible, etc. 
---
‚Äúshaking my head my head‚Äù
---
It's a new trend for the birthday challenges, they give you weapon skins now. Kind of a shame that they're all the exact same pattern. It fits here, but having bright yellow stars on every gun doesn't look great.
---
Eeeehh...
---
It‚Äôs oddly easy to control due to the high rate of fire, it feels consistent so if you‚Äôve got a fairly ‚Äúmedium‚Äù to high sens controlling it is no problem.
---
&gt;  pointless Operation Health
---
mfw you have yet no clue what you're talking about, that's a fact anyway.
---
Shotgun is the goat 
---
It‚Äôs only a week long event for fun and it‚Äôs not forcing you to play that game mode. 
---
dont care still want it
---
If they all looked like their actual agencies all of the characters would look nearly identical in all the tactical stuff. Its a fictional game.
---
The same as fortnite, yes, a game.
---
I know, I have a few :) looks great on Thermite especially with the new April fool's event haha. What's great about Blitz it's that it's on his shield rather than on his gun, that's why I commented, skins for shields are still rare and this one is basically free !
---
If only we could have seen how far we have come since then
---
I have no problem is playing a random map pool.
---
I just want 7 or 9 maps constantly rotated and I'm happy even if they don't give me map choice. So I dont have to remember 20 angles per site per map. Even the pro league has a 7 map pool.
---
I love the concept of a multi-billion dollar studio not having separate teams doing entirely different parts of the design process
---
POLISH MAPPP
---
So you really want the stupid pink gear?
---
&gt;	Today, ubi fails to deliver what the old players expect,
---
I bought the game when it released in 2015 and I‚Äôm fine with how things are going so suck it noob. Go back in time and buy the game earlier if you *actually* want to have an opinion. 
---
Neither do a majority of the ops, but ok
---
Look how they murdered my boy....
---
NO. I have a petition to make it permanent but r/rainbow6 doesn't let me post the link so that other people can see it 
---
Psst...they're pretty much cartoon characters now...
---
I get that your thoughts about the April Fools mode is your opinion and that it sucks that the Polish map got cancelled, but could you please explain how people who bought the season pass got more screwed over by Operation Health than others when owning the pass has literally zero effect on someone's access to a season's map? This is coming from someone who has played from launch and purchased every season pass.
---
hahha funny, when I bought this game I wanted a semi realistic coop shooter and now we got a game with ops in pink uniforms
---
Playing diamond ranked bomb is like crossplay PC at this point so no difference if xbox is added
---
Other than buying with R6 credits and shooting 40 attacker drones, is there a way I can get more packs? 
---
If your willing to spend money for cosmetics go for it 
---
Logically no it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs all cosmetic and won‚Äôt change the game at all
---
Wait. That‚Äôs illegal 
---
If you cant show your cosmetics, whats even the point?
---
Hey look, I bought this skin for 20$, which no one cant see. It will make them worthless.
---
I imagine Thatcher saying this to Maverick...
---
Favourite so far is "Please store your ACOGs in the overhead compartments."
---
Really feels like a dig to Ash and Bandit.
---
Unrelated, just curious, what season did you start playing siege?
---
The game is still tactical as fuck. Watch PL some times.
---
&gt; it fails to make the game work properly
---
They are constantly releasing bug fixes all the damn time. They've done such a good job lately addressing community requested things like crouch/lean spam, lion rework, pick and ban coming. It is a video game that is in year 4 of consistent patches, shit is going to break when you update it. As long as they are consistent in fixing it quickly that is fine.
---
&gt;  MEANWHILE they have time for unnecesary (imo) stuff like this.
---
Will never understand this complaint. It is a giant fucking AAA studio. Do you think it is like a group of 5 people working on this thing?
---
Pity the poor bastards who were high while playing! 
---
But mira and bandit and mute are on the other team
---
Its a meme/joke/reference
---
Unfortunately no 
---
Have you looked at the steam stats for this game, there‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs dying. Ubi needs to figure out if they care about their competitive player base or their casual player base so the competitive players can leave and the casual can come in, or this game will die this year. 
---
Shit like this while funny, hurts the game in the long run. There are so many broken things right now they don‚Äôt have the excuse of making crap like this. C4 is literally crashing the game right now.
---
It‚Äôs still toxic 
---
Kills can win you the game, more important on attack than defense tho. On defense time can easily win you the game 9/10 times. One impact grenade stopping a thermite charge can win you the game, rather than getting 3 kills but allowing the site to be opened up and everybody getting peeked on site. 
---
Kills are important to some degree, but lack of or getting a lot of them doesn't say much. So many ways to contribute to a win outside of kills. 
---
Bold of you to assume inflection and tone through text. 
---
Nah dude, Tachanka unicorn all the way lol

Fuze main?

It's got Rainbow in the name mate :P

What are you playing that has a rook.
---
Go play CSGO and Arma 3.

Remember to throw both your drones on attacking team and let the other team kill them :)

I can say the same about you. We won‚Äôt agree on this. You have your opinion and I have mine. Have a good day. 
---
Lets put it this way, i agree but theres nothing worse they can do. And the worst really wont make a huge impact in the long run. Ive been playing since op black ice launched and ive seen siege grow up. Its changed alot but i personally like it where it is currently. I see where you stand. I do, but siege for me is just a fun game to play with friends. Occasionally being serious but occasionally also going and completely owning the other team with a recruit shield rush. 
---
Ad hominem. Classical fallacy.
---
Go play CSGO if you want no skins. 
---
Do you mean like getting a select few to pick from? I haven't played CSGO in years so I can't remember how they do it.
---
Did you really just say "Grr" to emphasize your frustration... Bro, that's kinda cringe...
---
This is how they take Mozzie places
---
Siege has 100% been following the community, so I don't think we can really complain about what the game has become.
---
It ruins the overall art direction.
---
As one of the old players, I highly disagree. Yes it is tactical game at the start but things like this is why the community stays around. The fanart, the chibis, all the shit "tactical players" bitch about. 
---
A tactical game on its own will not last by itself and as much as tactical fans get butthurt about this, you aren't the ones fueling the continual development of the game. 
---
This game would already be in 6ft in the ground and in a poorly made coffin if this game is pure tactical. 
---
Another thing as well, most of the people who bitch about these events/headgears have no idea about project management or how to run a department in a gaming company. 
---
This  is literally a reskinned airplane which is made by artists primarily. The bug fixers don't really have to do anything for this other than a short QA. This is replace texture with new texture type of work. 
---
Please tell me this is real! 
---
There is a realist mode, you know? 
---
Pretty sure the hitreg isn't as bad as you'd believe. The hitboxes are incredibly precise. If you think you got bullshitted clip the gameplay and slow it down, chances are you just missed.
---
Naah, I ONLY play smoke and TACHANKA in that mode lol 
---
(X) DOUBT
---
You have changed the topic to something more personal and subjective. Of course you should have an option to change the graphics towards your taste, but saying it has a tactical affect gameplay wise is not true, and the game is still the same. 
---
Cough* ash
---
I'm mocking OP lmao
---
Siege is just a hard game to be good at and have a fun stream. With sound so important playing music will hinder gameplay and not to mention the focus needed for real competitive play. It‚Äôs a sad truth but not much you can do
---
Preach it 
---
Unless I'm getting r/whooshed 
---
&gt;It's not just about this particular event but the way this game is going. 
---
I forgot that r/rainbow6 users can see the future.
---
&gt;Not everyone will agree but back in 2016 I bought R6 when it was a TACTICAL focused game and I expect it to remain so.
---
How is it not a tactical focused game? Literally nothing has changed in the basic style of the game, sure new characters have been added to the roster, but the way you actually play the game is the same, all that's has changed is the variety of threats you could have during a round.
---
&gt;Today, ubi fails to deliver what the old players expect, 
---
Ah, a true man of the people, who's voice speaks for the literal millions of old players
---
&gt;its fails to make the game work properly and MEANWHILE they have time for unnecesary (imo) stuff like this. 
---
Again, I know this had been pulled out to you dozens of times in this thread, there are different people working in different aspects of the game, the level designers are a completely different set of people from the guys working on hotboxes
---
Cluster charges through a wall could be done. 
---
1.) Why the nsfw tag?  
---
2.) Don't shitpost for karma
---
"If [cross-play] becomes a thing I want to be able to put my current account on another console or even merge accounts." Lose the attitude and learn context
---
I'm not sure and anyways the challenge can only be done on the plane map, which doesn't have mozzie or mute
---
*the Geneva convention would like to know your location*
---
I had to buy every fucking pack in order to get the entire Smoke outfit. 
---
Only collection I had actually bought packs for, though.
---
I'm pretty sure I got the wrong idea from your post, what I got was, You think that if Lord Tachanka is getting reworked he should basically become Heavy from Tf2, and be able to walk around mowing people down with it, or mount his LMG.
---
The problem I have with yearly releases having microtransactions is that the game is going to be surpassed by another release in a year's time, so the money they make solely from sales would be enough to keep the game running for a year. At first I was against the format of microtransactions for lootboxes, but thinking about it more it makes sense to have them, particularly in this game because of the longevity of this game. There's been constant updates to siege for the past three and a half years, and if they ran the game off sales alone there would be much less content being pushed out. Having lootboxes (that, by the way, only give you cosmetic items that, tactically speaking, would give you a disadvantage in a firefight) allows the game to have a constant stream of revenue and allows more money to be allocated to other places, like the professional scene. It also allows the game to be sold at ridiculous discounts (you can buy the game pretty frequently for &lt;$20). I think the format they're doing right now is great because, personally, I enjoy having consistent updates and teams dedicated to specific aspects of the game that in the long-term make the game awesome.
---
Right, because the artists making skins also do bugfixes
---
Right. That's why they work with on different teams, and went the two sides of development have nothing to do with each other.
---
&gt; Seriously please explain how that is still tactical.
---
This is a tactical _game_. Not a military simulation. This game is still per definition _tactical_.
---
&gt;You literally just agreed with the point I was trying to make...
---
Yes, about the cosmetics, but not the game itself. R6S is not about military realism, it's a tacticool game and it has been that since launch with its characters. 
---
it's a real life version of a game-canon operator tool, that is cool. Removed. 
---
Nice work. 
---
??? How? 
---
What good is an ACOG if you sprint everywhere? Lol
---
I honestly really want the Smoke furry outfit.. I don't know whats wrong with me.
---
He does though, it won't display till he relogs or/and actually plays another match.
---
[deleted]
---
Why would you argue with people that are saying they know what they're talking about, when you just said you don't, and that you're an idiot? There's a reason your first comment got downvoted.
---
.38 special
---
I think starter edition is the cheapest edition if they still have it, just look on steam/uplay 
---
Though I recommend getting the full game so you can play all the operators right away
---
I did the challange, recieved nothing. Fun
---
I remember one being something along the lines of "Sorry for the turbulence, oh wait, it's just Nomad's airjabs."
---
Everytime i look its usually only like 15k total viewers or less sometimes
---
Explaining why this article is relevant on this sub might make this comment very long, possibly longer than the article itself. After reading it though, you will probably understand why Rainbow Six's gameplay is so peculiar compared to other online shooters and possibly the philosophical roots of this difference
---
I've died a couple times already because some of the operators just blend in to the background 
---
And J√§ger and smoke/sledge/mute SMG-11.
---
They should have made it for ranked on the 1st
---
I‚Äôm always the one that brings the F2 instead though....
---
Its controllable, really feels like a coinflip but somewhat controllable
---
definately smg, i rarely use her shotugn
---
You posted it twice by accident 
---
What if you were funny, huh?
---
The dude had 340 ping and you had 9, there's going to be huge desync there. Also, due to the twitchy movements that you made I suspect you're using a mouse and keyboard adapter on console? Fuck off.
---
Lol. It‚Äôs the devs that coded the game mode, and did level design, etc that should be doing bug fixes. Also making skins costs the company money, money probably better suited to fix problems.
---
Or huddle them all into a closet and then reinforce all 4 walls
---
Fake, but it is well done.
---
Rich boii can pay 5$
---
lol that's me when I don't want to get shot
---
well it probably shouldve done more, but calling it pointless is being completely delusional. I understand the hate on some things, but hating on something that actually helped is just plain ridiculous.
---
3 words:
---
Mute and Mozzie
---
You mean improve everything.
---
We shouldn't shut up and accept lootboxes, they're manipulative, scummy and randomized, I'm usually a forgiving person, but this is terrible, and CS:GO isn't even that bad, particularly considering that the Steam Marketplace exists, and trading is an important part of CS:GO, lootboxes actually make sense in CS:GO, as they don't manipulate the economy, unlike a place like TF2's Mann Co. Store, where it does influence the economy, but we're talking about R6S here.
---
And packs being cheap isn't much of an excuse, and they're also not cheap, a full set has been said to be what? 40 Dollars?
---
Lol that was hilarious xD
---
It isn't, you can even tell by the graphics.
---
Really? It never gives me my renown or rank. 
---
Not really, it depends on how you have it set up 
---
Um is this a mod? or did they really change the plane to look like that?
---
Ummm, they changed the breach charge, they are changing the deployable sheild, added a bulletproof cam not long ago, recoil changed 2 seasons ago, changed the ways wall destruction works. Idk what more mechanics change you want it you dont want to change the whole game.
---
It‚Äôs the new April fools event 
---
Maybe because it makes more sense from a gameplay and practicality standpoint 
---
You can buy the alpha pack ones from the store???
---
Damn I need to get back on it, been too busy grinding on FH4
---
Found the anti sjw who watches little ben Shapiro 24/7
---
Ya you right when it comes to great skins atleast ow theres a chance no matter how small it is. Personally idc about cosmetics in r6 and more about the conpetitive environment. But thats now what we talking about here. When it comes to the best skins overwatch has it more consumer friendly 
---
I agree with all those, although I can't personally relate to the console issues (I'm on PC). Hopefully the dividing of tasks into teams for Year 4 allows them to fix all of these things
---
I think ranked needs more maps. Its so boring playing on the same ones with the same sites over and over again. It falls into an automatic response rather than actual planning and creative strategy. I would agree, the unbalanced maps need to be removed but if they can add more balanced maps into ranked, by all means do that please. 
---
I don't think the ranked maps make Siege less competitive, the ranking system in general does. Rank doesn't matter, that's common knowledge at this point. If you want Siege to be more competitive, then you have to make the rewards of winning mean something, which ranked doesn't do. 
---
I think the ranked rule set is fine, as you have to remember that people have actual lives. If matches go on for too long people will be more likely to leave in the middle of them, and with more people leaving matches, ranked will matter less. I think it should adopt the rule set of the Road to Invitationals event instead
---
As for the new game mode, no. Instead of adding an entirely new game mode called competitive, they should just make ranked a bit more balanced, meaningful, and competitive. Ranked was meant to be that competitive game mode, it makes no sense to have another one. If you want more competitive games, they should add a tournament system, where you can queue with a squad into a tournament bracket of either 4, 8, or 16. Winning tournaments like these would be very rewarding with a lot of renown, exp, and just winning the tournament in itself. You could also track your placements of these tournaments, it would show how many times you got first, second, third, etc.
---
While the majority of those ideas are good, they each have their individual problems (This is not counting the ones that the player has full control over, such as map selection, etc.) which would require other changes to address. Instead of listing basic outlines, an overarching plan should be suggested, as Ubisoft has already considered all of these changes, they just don't know how to deal with the problems that come with them or they don't want to.
---
Neither. 
---
You should add a shield or something on Black beards cuz that skulls just seems naked like that XD
---
I'm saying that we don't know the "leaks" are 100% accurate until its officially revealed.

Last I saw a 1050ti omen laptop was $500 usd but I think it was half off so possibly not. With that price look for used or sales tbh
---
You are talking about changes, but I think the game needs another gamemode that will stay in the game. It just got boring after a while and to be honest that made me pretty sad

---
The captain has turned on the fasten seatbelts sign.... party pooper
---
Ok, thanks
---
I just want like a 50/50 chance to get one when you roll a normal alpha pack. They wouldn‚Äôt do that tho because that would actually influence people to play the game.
---
Download link br√∂ther?

That dosent comes under mechanics, but ok. I get you now.

everyone always says that but look at Gridlock and Mozzie only the genders were wrong.
---
Wow!

It's a door handle, you use them to open doors üëç

I'm pretty sure I'm exactly what It is now üòÇ
---
I'm just estimating based on what I see. Most golds and above play ranked only or rarely casual. You might find the occasional plat or diamond if you win a lot.
---
Please forgive me I'm not really a graphic artist, feel free to make better ones!
---
Well played but why not using reflex?
---
I have both my pc and steam link hard linked to my network so there not much lag, it's more about upscaling and Res quality
---
If you're on xbox you need to unplug your headset to get it to work again. Seems like going into a party chat makes siege forget you have a mic.
---
Leave skins to the unique gadgets with legendary uniforms 
---
I love the theory, but no chance that is what they were going for lol. I appreciate you adding a layer to it though. I hope Zofia doesn't live in a home that looks like the map House though. There is only 1 bathroom. 
---
I mean it‚Äôs nice but it‚Äôs not something that should take priority at the moment
---
Nomad looks like an egg with her regular headgear 
---
I think it‚Äôs a sick idea. U could have pro teams on them. Or who ever ur playing as logo
---
I‚Äôve seen Acer Nitro 5s for sale around $500. 
---
Thatcher because I like to help my team out on the offense. I really like his weapon and his ability is useful in 95% of rounds. I've been trying to learn Finka because my friends told me to, but I just despise her gun. 
---
On defense I don't really have a true main, but I usually rotate between Cav, Smoke, and Jager. Cav for the ability, Smoke and Jager for their weapons. 
---
See I have the opposite problem where I can top frag every game and still be in bronze. :/
---
reeepost
---
im so salty this is fake, i like using nomad but she looks like trent reznor. I would insta buy this headgear if it were real. 
---
I miss the old Rank Icons
---
Very cool!

Monty is fuckin' clairvoyant.
---
Yeah they are nostalgic but the new ones are more distinguishable 
---

hm. Seems like my name Average is just an average name. 
---
You have control of whether or not you queue for ranked with that connection.
---
These are awesome! Can't wait to be able to download them!
---
Spamming now. Congratulations. 
---
No offense I think this is kinda stupid 
---
I ended inviting them to a party to have a 2v3 and they got destroyed by my friend and I. 2 of them rage quit then the leader stayed just to finish it. But thank you!

He put he creative tag to show it is not real

Crouch spam fix is live on TTS, IIRC.

And now we have some childish bs on plane

You don't seem to understand a very simple point so it bore repeating.

Thank you for not putting it in stupid alpha packs
---
Hot pink
---
Red-ish pink
---
Hot pink, another answer means colorblindness
---
This should be the way they implement these, if they *hopefully* do. 
---
My average squad talk right here.
---
I'm saying, the internet suddenly gets slow in the middle of a ranked match, (which can go to overtime and everything so it's long), you lag, and you shouldn't get kicked instantly.
---
Honestly all i see is blood red
---
Bright PINK
---
I think it's red
---
Wait, didn't they change it so the complete edition (which comes with the base OPs unlocked) is their new standard edition?
---
No, just fantasy.
---
It‚Äôs like a hot pink
---
Many games switched to 3d menus.
---
I don't know why. Regular 2d menus look a lot more professional and load faster.
---
Not the hero we wanted, but the hero we needed for sure 
---
I thought this was real.
---
Was about to get on siege just to buy it.
---
Shame on you OP...
---
SHAME
---
I remember seeing something awhile back saying that making these menus costed more money to make than the 3D model ones. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true though 
---
SOLD
---
Nope you‚Äôre the only one. Definitely not the 50+ posts every week saying the same thing. üôÑüôÑ
---
It's confusing because the maps are supposed to be simulations but then outback had a backstory to the map making it seem like an actual event. 
---
you skipped over the clown headgear, lucha libre masks, rock star outfits, etc.  
---
  
---
this game has plenty of bad ideas for cosmetics, but it has never affected the gameplay.
---
That would be cool but it would most likely be in the division, much like what ghost recon wildlands did 
---
It's pink
---
Yellow
---
I would agree for the operators who had og pl sets like jager bandit iq and ash to get redone new pl sets but for stuff like echo and smoke which was just like a year ago no that‚Äôs on you bud 
---
it is confusing. same with gender nowadays
---
It looks like garbage lmao
---
Magenta 
---
It's black obviously 
---
Yeah that's a real life gun lol.
---
House map in Poland = scrapped polish map.

Fuck. No. 
---
Lol yea, they‚Äôve updated how you get the new cars so you have to actually work for em
---
Might not be able to afford a pc 
---
The game is still fun for me and new operators are definitely interesting. You should start playing again haha
---
It could be circumvented by randomly cycling through the barricades each round. First round all defenders get barricades from person A, then second round from person B, etc.
---
Same with attacker drones please. We need more skins/remodels!
---
Aight sick. Thanks for the input man. Will look into it
---
Id buy this
---
They are the artist
---
Alright thanks. Will look into it 
---
Then why buy a mouse and keyboard? 
---
It's just washed up PC players who are tired of getting destroyed on their platform, so they result in bullying console players &amp; ruining the experience for everyone. 
---
Thanks dude. I will look into it
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
This would cause way more problems then it solves. Here's the thing: defenders already have a huge advantage when the round starts, that's why only select defenders have ACOG and why all defenders only have SMGs (except J√§ger, Mozzie, and Maestro). If there wasn't ACOG for attackers on their ARs, then the game would be extremely defender sided since attackers would no longer have the advantage of ACOG, they would be on the same level as defenders who like I said already have a huge advantage before the round even starts.
---
Clickbaiting haha. Still awesome but get the feeling with the title the idea was to mislead for a second
---
I joined and a week before we got Operation Health. Its weird to think some people dont know what Operation Health is.

Not entirely. Especially in the context people use it here. 
---
Why she look cross eyed
---
Pulse is vanilla 
---
to have an unfair advantage on console
---
The voice actors don't sound the same at all. Zofia has a polish accent, the mother on the AF map is american. To top it off, House is set in America (I think specifically Florida?) and Zofia resides in the R6 HQ, which I believe is in the United Kingdom. 
---
It's a cool theory, and I really appreciate the effort put into it and the lines drawn, but it's just not plausible because of the voice, accent, and locations 
---
How could you
---
Monetised reinforcements...yay
---
just chanka because of his low pick and very low win rate
---
You shouldn‚Äôt, it gives you a great advantage over people playing with controllers. 
---
What if zofia
---
Completely agree.
---
i'm pretty sure it's just a character/gadget rework and his appearance will remain largely the same
---
Monetise reinforcements? Yay...
---
Insta-switch Pulse with the 13 meter scan range was certainly a special time. 
---
Which is stupid tbh 
---
What do you mean by not entirely? Im a little slow lol
---
Big Jaggy Boi is best and if you say anything else I'll break into your house and pet your dog without asking for permission.
---
Yes you are
---
Good thing I wasn‚Äôt in this game
---
So disgusting yet amazing
---
They can though. The problem is they don't want to devote the resources because it would be a cat and mouse game. Check out the hotbreach podcast on it. They had Epi on. 
---

Oh okay.

Nah. A much needed element to combat rushing. 
---
don't mind me im just BLEEDING TO DEATH
---
Is it an air soft gun?? 
---
I don't think this would be a great idea. I know I'll get shit on for this but CSGO went through a number of updates where some of the biggest changes were changing the background of commonly played areas to make players standing in front of them more visible. What I'm getting at is I think this would open the door for players to place down a barricade that matches the color of their skin they are wearing, Think Echos elite skin paired with a red colored door. 
---
^^^ this
---
Pirating was/is so bad over there companies have just given up and sell it for less to encourage people to at least pay something.
---
damn. Are there any programs known to not get you banned?
---
Not sure and you probably can rebound keys in game 
---
Exactly. It's like the 6th graders who can't take an insult from an 7th grader so they go to the elementary kids to bully them
---
3 random cartridges on the table are different calibers REEEE
---
So similar to what Maverick can do, but safer and louder I imagine? 
---
Omg WHY HAS NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF THIS
---
After a couple rounds of me doing poorly I'll pull out recruit with the SAS shotgun and I usually end up doing really well.
---
Except it‚Äôs the actually the 3rd
---
r/redditsings
---
Alibi mains have schizophrenia, i mean look how many there are
---
Yeah it‚Äôs way too easy to kill blitz at range especially with an acog 
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
---
I drew this
---
Why do the graphics look so much better irl
---
nah, it‚Äôs just for general use. I know I could close the program before launching the game, but I‚Äôll probably forget one day.
---
Do you mean the receiver all of it‚Äôs on? Hard to say since OP is using an Airsoft gun. 
---
Zofia‚Äôs AK in game is a Polish FB Beryl.
---
I love the concept that people believe the professional 3d artists are also professional programmers. No one in either of those professions has time for other shit, why would they do both??
---
Yes but it's main aim would be to shoot people though the reinforced walls, to warn people to take cover there could be a loud clocking sound or something like that. 
---
Been like that since release... 
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be 
---
I don't agree with him when he says one shot hs should be removed from the game for most guns in general, but I do agree in wallbang situations
---
lmao
---
Why the fuck y'all got so triggered, I never said half of things you have pointed. 
---
What are you trying to rebind the keys to 
---
The guy  looks great but I despise that stock
---
It makes me shudder. 
---
I kinda is but free. 
---
rebinding the bottom right keys to arrow keys. The woes of having a 60% keyboard.
---
ok?
---
You lucky bastard
---
No, just no. This idea gives enemies no ability to play around it or anticipate it in any way. 
---
Didn't know that, good thing. 
---
That'd be cool, but I feel like there'd be a lot of dicks. Lol kids will draw dicks on everything. 
---
The bottom right?
---
Ah, so this isnt an airsoft gun?
---
I was stuck in copper for a really long time until I played in a five stack of people. That is the best way to get out because copper has so many smurfs, throwers, and players that don't know what they are doing. 
---
My favourite thing is regardless of hostage site everyone always just comes in that main entrance so it's always a shit show there and the sweaty diamonds have moved on so you can just do stupid stuff
---
How would that indicate dedication? People buy much more expensive optics all the time.
---
Sometimes I feel like she has no strength to be in combat, since she is so freaking skinny. 
---
there is no diamond 1, 2, or 3, it's just diamond. and i wouldn't agree with your opinion even if you were dia. just curious if your rank has anything to do with your opinion.
---
fun
---
Exactly why I wont give it to you
---
No offense? Recruit rush then?
---
I like plane. It's not balanced at all, but I enjoy playing on it. I'd certainly take it over Fortress or Tower any day
---
I'm going to assume it's low then
---
What if op doesn't want one
---
Assume what you want
---
He clearly just too a step to your right and shot the side of your head
---
Takes it to pax: gets arrested 
---
if it wasn't low then you would say it along with your username + platform :)
---
I started playing right after outbreak ended. I really want to try it.
---
So toxic... 
---
It‚Äôs beautiful. 
---
No. For the last time. I want an opinion without rank affecting result
---
Can you remind me how this achievement is completed?
---
Gsg9 recruit benefits more to a team than Tachanka. Change my mind.
---
Plug Walk, dudu, i dont even understand how to fucking plug walk.
---
Haha, i Think i Got that right
---
exactly... i cant be unfaithful to my one and only...
---
you say that as an excuse to not admit it, if you weren't ashamed of it then you would openly give it.
---
Winning a hostage match on hereford base 
---
I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt brought it back. Surely they still have the files and a working version of it. 
---
Would love too see it make a comeback, even if it‚Äôs the same levels as last time, just change up the operator selection. It‚Äôd be cool to see it during October for the Halloween event. 
---
What did i just watch
---
Find a group 
---
Use capitao‚Äôs LMG with the scope and look up while outside on a map
---
So how do you not complete the achievement? I‚Äôve done hostage several times on it.
---
You need a high IQ to appreciate the legendary Gun charms I have almost all of them my personal favorite is the alpha pack
---
If it helps you sleep
---
Pls no, or if done, make it a something you have to enable only in custom games as I originally bought and enjoyed the game so much base on the realism and feeling of teamwork, as this has gone away I would not want these in the game, I don‚Äôt know how many other people share my opinion 
---
I mean, he's actually OK if you like being a living claymore
---
If I remember correctly I think you have to 3-0 on Hereford to get the trophy 
---
Doesn't montey run with it like blitz?
---
I wish ubim would make skins for drones, barricades, reinforcements,deployable shields, barbed wire, claymore, nitro cells, and maybe even gadgets if theyre down for that
---
üòÇ
---
Yea seriously. These plays only work against trash cans. 
---
same here. since magic patch i do have heavy lags from match to match
---
I love when I shoot a teammate in the foot with shotgun spread, they fall over dead, and I get kicked instantly.
---
Because it's a really stupid idea. Hey, let's give reinforcement skins now too while we're at it. And how about cam skins now?? Not everything in the goddamn game needs skins.
---
 I‚Äôve glad u didn‚Äôt just separate them but had them together makes it even better 
---
Thank you, I needed this today üôèüèª
---
cool thanks
---
that's a smart move, thank you young master
---
I agree. She's a short girl so I like to make her feel tall...when I'm nice.
---
Enemy team went BRICKO MODE
---
Furries agains humanity 
---
I really wish there was more customization in rainbow. Operators and guns are nice, but I want to have a drone skin, or a gadget skin. It would at least be nice to have a variety of hostages rather than human #1 and human #2.
---
Maybe even custom melee weapon skins, like kaids knife or some absurd bullshit like a whisk?
---
The main problem is that the game is tactical, and once absurd stuff gets added, the game gets warped some.
---
Unless OP also has a real nice gat to go with that ACOG and just slapped it on his airsoft rig.
---
If it was comedy, then no worries. It just sounded a little blunt in my eyes.
---
fuze has a really dumb helmet and the top part isn't actually his head.
---
It's CaSUaL
---
there are a few different models of acogs. plus ones that come w stuff like a top-mounted rmr
---
That would either be a blast or a huge disappointment 
---
Rifle is Fine.
---
Also the other two teammates did virtually nothing as what they did was akin too "huh ohkay."
---
I had the game but stopped playing throughout the event cause I didn‚Äôt know it happened ;-;
---
Ps4?
---
Jesus Christ the hip fire 
---
Defending with blitz
---
Standard comes with all the original operators, but you have to get all the dlc operators by purchasing them with renown. 
---
Why does Blitz shield only have 5 flashes? Why doesn't IQ just strap her gadget to her rifle? What is in Doc's stims that allow people to literally shrug off mortal wounds and inevitable blood loss, recovering from a crippling state that limits their movement to a crawl, and begin sprinting around like nothing happened? Why does Mute's jammer stop Blitz's hardwired shield from flashing? What technology allows the drones to scan the location of people and display it for everyone to see?
---
I get where you're coming from, and I've had similar gripes with other games, but there were a bunch of gameplay-only inclusions in the base game, and the only ability they've released that genuinely seems out of place is Alibi's hologram, and it's not a huge stretch in a world where heartbeat scanners exist.
---
House indeed is located in the US.
---
Also, happy cake day!
---
fucking muppets... 
---
A lot of gadgets would be useless. 
---
I'm aware

No reflections are real on objects like this. Or anything. Really. It's just an image slapped onto it to make it *look* like a reflection. Environment mapping. Ubi just used the sky box for this one I guess.

Horrible idea. On paper good. Until hackers come in to play.

Killing 40 drones in a week is now for elite hardcore gamers? Lol.

This isn't a weekly challenge that gives you renown like the others. It's a challenge that gives you a special alpha pack. Why would that make it so you can just log in and get it?
---
If you're only logging into games for the challenges you have other issues 
---
Just the flower, but thank you very much.
---
No no no no.... Valkyrie has the best ass, I mean, have you seen the thing? It's absolutely gigantic. Don't get me wrong, Dokkaebi is a nice gal but not the best, understood?

I‚Äôve never heard of outbreak getting hated on just chimera with broken lion.

if you bothered to read one of the 10000000 posts about this you‚Äôd know there‚Äôs literally nothing Ubisoft can do. people like you blaming them have no idea how it works. it‚Äôs on Sony and Microsoft

I don‚Äôt think he was referring to the content of the update, I think he‚Äôs talking more about the glitches and bugs that came with outbreak.

Further evidence that he must be nerfed ASAP

It's been 5 hours, where the fuck is it?

You can still join a team, play Go4's, Offline tournaments (Not LAN) I'd say go for it.

Hitting plat 3 solo queuing is the same as a glorified gold 1, once you've solo queued to plat 2 and above, only are you worthy of being deemed as good. And solo queuing is dependant on luck, queue at peak hours
