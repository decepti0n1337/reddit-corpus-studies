You let your 8 year old play this game?

---
---
9 months of renown to buy attachments? Just win like 10 matches and you‚Äôd have enough to buy all of them
---
Nice job
---
OP, please contact mod to appeal this, this is more of a PSA rather than glitch.
---
It's a feels bad
---
Gold Blacks
---
No he just likes the icons...
---
Well than aren't you so lucky. I don't intend to pre aim each time as most of the time that shit doesn't even fucking happen. So props to you if you can but some of us ain't so lucky all the time.
---
i remember buying a new op, and having to grind a lot more just so i could use the attachments, wish they never added that..
---
10 days left..
---
as an Aussie twitch main, I am both terrified and excited for Mozzie. Help.
---
i haven't heard anything of a rework happening anytime soon? who knows, i sure hope you're right, i havent played the tts yet so i have no idea.
---
OH YEAH I remember just having enough for the op and then going in no attachments or maybe having a scope and nothing else 
---
Did you buy the base edition? The one that is $5 more made the operators the cheaper price. 
---

---
The base edition made all the starters 25k, I think it‚Äôs silly. 
---
The worst was when you had just enough money to buy the new ops but not enough to buy the attachments 
---
I don't even feel it's that long ago
---
God dammit I'm spending more money. I made a mistake of adding Hibana to my main rotation operators a week before they announced a new elite skin.
---
Thank you for replying.
---
Happy cake day btw
---
First time?
---
It's still red
---
Glaz‚Äôs change is great! Exactly what he needed.   
---
Glaz wasn‚Äôt op, but he was being abused imo.  The developers have a problem where they design operators, but don‚Äôt think about how they could be abused. (Examples: Lion, thermal Glaz, 2 speed blitz.)   
---
Glaz‚Äôs role is to be a support sniper, but his thermal scope was being used as an entry fragger (front-line killer) position.
---
I played all first year then stopped. When i just recently started playing i was so confused thinking i had already bought things. Lol new players got it easy
---
Bandit tricking 2.0
---
**I am still tilted there's no renown compensation.**
---
I seriously must have dropped about 100,000 renown and countless hours of play unlocking all the attachments and vanilla operators.
---
First time playing smoke, or first time on the sub?
---
There's still time. 
---
Doc must purge the cancer
---
Ah alright. It's not for me to say how you parent your children. I just thought 8 years old was a little young to be play siege.

Y do u even use long barrels

PC or console?

Number 1 seems good but it has to be almost unanimous choice to ban map so 8-9 votes.

as a new player, i feel for you guys üòîü§ü

---
Console
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure us old school players got compensated, iirc.
---
I'll run finka with an lmg, but that because, like, I run into the room putting bullets into every possible angle-watching spot...
---
One is a smonk and the other is a smoke
---
Fuze's LMG? 
---
Yeah honestly I don't get it. I find myself taking red dot over acog sometimes, even.
---
Little more. Yeah, yeah. *Sniffs**Sniffs*
---
Literally the day after I bought the last attachment I wanted for my last operator I had unlocked, they announced this change
---
sorry you're gonna have to rephrase that, I don't get what you mean at all. However, if you meant wether it affects your stats, it should not, since Ubisoft recognises this as a 3rd party interruption and should usually let you reconnect to the ranked match or search for a new game.
---
I bought all attachments (for all ops I had) and all the 20 basic ops, but I'm just upset for no renown back. Good for all attachments and 20 basic ops free but for the love of God please give me my renown back. :(
---
What?!
---
Did you fix it????????? 
---
Once again the sub feels entitled to something just cause new players don't have to grind. It's not like any of us were going to spend the renown on anything significant since the only other thing in the game are overpriced cosmetics and none of the genuinely good ones can be bought with renown anyway. If Ubi gifted you all like 50k renown you would all still bitch that it wasn't enough or some shit.
---
&gt;struggle

&gt;winning once 
---
Nigga what 
---
At least we got the mothafuckin *SIDEWINDER* ash elite set
---
Nope there‚Äôs never been a Plat 4, however about 2 years ago the rank tiers were swapped around, so Plat 1 was the lowest platinum rank, and it went to to Plat 2, then Plat 3 and then diamond. 
---
Huh looks awfully simaler to Jager's and Bandits...
---
Seems to be doing okay with an ethernet cable... but why would wifi make me lag only on this game?
---
Learn how to do it and you will know
---
Unpopular opinion: I actually like the G36C 
---
Well what did you think was in the other canister?
---
Hey
---
It's still not going to be meta.
---
Not if I flash him first!
---
Silent for thunt afaik. Probably not really a high priority.
---
The weapon is broken with anything approaching normal recoil because of the insane fire-rate on a 3 speed. If they just nerfed the fire-rate down to like 900 and gave it normal recoil it would probably be fine - although the 40 round mag would still need to be watched closely.
---
Yes you can do this but only up to three drones.
---
But it has always been there?
---
Same boat brother
---
Having a bad day?
---
It's not, it's just on a shitty operator.
---
I wish
---
Audio might be bugged. 
---
Yes. Though every thing is in extremely close range. A normal encounter in siege [the head takes up much, much more of the screen](https://imgur.com/a/wjtdvYI), and so you don't need to aim nearly as much, as well as spraying at close ranges is pretty easy in Rainbow so you can hit 90% of the shots when spraying, but at longer ranges (which are common in cs) its much harder to spray. As well as CS has intricate recoil patterns which stray away from the y axis, that you have to learn. 
---
Simply put, in Siege you don't need to think too much about your shots, because if you miss you know you can hit the next 5 shots pretty easy, but in CS if you don't calculate every single click you're dead.
---
Literally came into the game a few months before they switched. I was so pissed all my hard work getting almost all the base guys was for nothing. Reknown that could have gone to a DLC op. Gah
---
I mean, its not, but I feel like the community really have voiced an opinion on changes for it.
---
no, holo on 4:3 ratio is absolutely unstoppable
---
What‚Äôs your rank? I‚Äôve never once seen anyone in high ranks run the red dot
---
I had one of these guys before. It's absolutely infuriating. 
---
reflex is an ugly sight
---
So what does this actually change for the people using it?
---
Elite hibana or Elite bandit :thonk: 
---
Gold 1
---
Leasion soup
---
I'm honestly more upset that Lion and Glaz aren't nerfed yet. 
---
I did it for the achievement and was pleasantly surprised
---
That's a [MLG strat](http://i.embed.ly/1/image/Resize?key=92b31102528511e1a2ec4040d3dc5c07&amp;width=1000&amp;grow=true&amp;url=http://i.imgur.com/2VdOr89.jpg).
---
Yeah I save for 50 packs over most the season and then don't get any black ice it's great
---
2 would be fine, but i think 1 is the best option.
---
Yes, they did a lot, but don't over-defend them on their communication. They lie  a lot to make their work look harder and better. I know that they're working with Ubisoft for the servers, they announced a new partner (don't remember the name) which would create servers based in Africa too. They lied. That's what I'm saying. I love ubisoft games for their concept, but I hate the way they manage their promotion, so fake. 
---
That is like a placebo. It doesnt make it quicker. Just reques. If anything that just makes it longer
---
One pest-one drone only
---
not the point but ok
---
I remember when I found out they were free. I was kinda triggered for the rest of the day since i had bought so many attachments 
---
uhhhhh.....
---
Really? WTF Ubisoft I want my renown! 
---
Accurate
---
Lol
---
They specifically said season 2 for p&amp;b In the panel though
---
Posted twice?
---
I think they meant if you can catch more than one drone with one shot from mozzie if the drones are close together idkü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This right here. It's so lazy like how has it taken them over 6 months just to nerf his ability in every way? This should have been a long time ago if they're going to be this lazy. Rework implies his ability is going to be completely changed. 
---
Come to think of it, we're never going to to get plague doctor smoke elite. It's going to be this.

On pc?

I just started playing again and my friend couldn‚Äôt comprehend my confusion and excitement at being able to equip all these fun new attachments.
---
thank you, its been a long time lol
---
Well, it simply let's them actually be able to use their uplay versions because Ubi updated the file. The old version has an outdated version of the defaultargs.dll file so the uplay version gives you an error. This fixes it
---
Probably has AirPods on under them. 
---
I remember the day I 100% the situations just for the renown. Now there's no point lol
---
Yeah, I'm not entirely sure why I've held onto so much of it. I've bought some skins but I generally like what I've got so I just haven't been motivated to spend lol.
---
Literally unplayable 
---
I know, just when I hit the shoot button, nothing happens, like I don't have access to those abilities
---
PC or Console 
---
Sorry but WTF ARE THOSE GUYS DOING?!

And the free renown and booster in the UBIsoft club

"Ubisoft wants to know your location"

Almost 5 minutes for 4 seconds of action

---
Reading this as I'm getting smashed by Smurfs lmao 
---
that recoil pattern is yucc
---
I was extremely confused one day when I suddenly had all the attachments
---
When blackbeards shield was made with a unknown alien element 
---
Pull up on em with a staple gun
---
March 5 or 6
---
I mean, not extend barrel.
---
Almost the same but not as visible. It just change a few cm. I need 45cm to do a 360 but at the game it result on a 50cm to do a 360, for example. 
---
Every match I see if I'm able to do a 360 and I change my sens in game. But is consistent, sometimes the sens slower in some situations and sometimes is faster but every match is different. Any solution?
---
That reaction time tho
---
Just FYI if you didn't know Lion will only cost you 20k at the start of Y4S1, with their new operator pricing system
---
This guy gets it
---
Maybe an event. They‚Äôll be doing lots of events this year
---
It‚Äôs a nail gun that‚Äôs used when you put up a barricade
---
Oh.  Yeah, that‚Äôs a lot faster lol
---
I only use the g36 so its not that big of a difference
---
Didn't think it was that color though 
---
Honestly I was there for over 10 minutes but Xbox will only let you record up to the last 5
---
Yep it was
---
Smurfs aren't that bad though. They're still using MMR system, so if you're playing against them you're around their skill level.
---
Only real issues with smurfs are when they boost in ranked. Either deranking to copper 4 to get their friends to a higher rank easier or being plat/diamond and starting a new account to get their friends to higher rank.
---
Said a few times Ubi should just make ranked matchmaking take MMR of the highest rank in the squad. That way diamonds will be fighting other diamonds with a copper teammate, they'll lose ranks and won't play with the coppers anymore.
---
I'm facepalming so hard right now
---
There used to be a ten minute option, I guess they've taken it off. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the color of them
---
Probably never
---
You gotta post it on youtube
---
Ikr ive had one non smurf game outta 15 today
---
you have to buy the attachments now
---
If you owned the game since release then you could have bought some of the Black Ice bundles during season 1 
---
It‚Äôs a god scope with the smoke, I always throw both in the obj and push, I have total accuracy and they just blind fire. I see the change as a high risk high reward change.
---
Picking up drones
---
I thought it was just a black color
---
It really does. The reason people like it, is because it's better than old Hereford. Not that it's a good map
---
It has lower fire rate and lower damage though, it's more a case of power vs difficulty. 
---
Blood orchid gang
---
Holy....
---
&gt;I was gonna add the fact that people consider Fuze as a gadget destroyer rather than a fragger. Understandable, but I rather get kills with my charges than gadgets;)   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Plus jager severely harms that gadget destroyer proposition, unless you consider wasting jagers ADS a gadget waster which is actually understandable.
---
Add me, my gamer tag is Stealthy B0B 
---
Matters what elo you‚Äôre in
---
The only thing that matter are the FOKIN LASER SIGHTS
---
Okay. I‚Äôll add you
---
Imo they should have all of the maps in casual. Don‚Äôt see why not. 
---
I had to go to Ubisoft club and once it connected it worked.
---
"I'd let you enter my objective"
---
Ranked always needed something else in my opinion. I've played off and on since release, each season I leave with the same impression, that the ranks are top heavy and bloated -- Silver &amp; Gold especially. You place, win a few matches and get put in Silver &amp; Gold where it seems like the majority of players are, but there is intense disparity from player to player.
---
Yeah let's give another shield a speed buff, typical /r/Rainbow6/new material right here.
---
It‚Äôs big but not huge, and that‚Äôs the scenario where the age difference is the biggest, since the post implies that back when they were a kid, attachments cost money, which was a change that only happened a year or so ago, so I‚Äôm being generous when assuming that they‚Äôve been here from the start since a lot of people weren‚Äôt.
---
Lol nah its just a meme name 
---
Looking back that probably would be an issue
---
Do you seriously start getting nostalgia boners after only 4 years?
---
That‚Äôs most likely a 25 rounder. 20 round GI mags are strait
---
Your reading comprehension is awful. I'm telling you I played quite a bit on release, enough to where I know all these fundamentals you are wasting breathe on.
---
I remember buying every single sigh tfor every weapon and then they gave it for free. I was a little bit pissed. 
---
Likewise. Seems people are abusing the system while they still can.
---
Average player. Fuck pro league. They should be making sure the game is fun for the vast majority, 
---
He hides drugs in them that's why they are hollow. Duh.
---
I say less Europe Asia and America, more everyone else
---
You right
---
I used to run RD until all of a sudden my aim started dropping off. IDK if the actual sight changed, or just the way I needed to play, but now I use everything but red dot depending on my op.

Hey sorry I heard you sniff, ant chance you happen to be sniffin a baguette

Oh well, once you‚Äôve been playing for as long as I have. Then you notice very subtle things.

How am I cringey and desperate. I see the toxicity of rainbow crosses over onto the sun reddit. I was simply asking a question.

That was the philosophy, better have a soldier get cancer in 15 years than have less of a chance to fight during a chemical attack

What?

Oof

No probsm
---
i accidently paused on the second shot after pausing on the first shot you should have killed him
---
he had airpods on*
---
Man, I remember these days. I‚Äôd usually save up for operator and attachments so I have enough before buying the operator
---
i accidentally paused on the second shot after pausing on the first shot you should have killed him
---
Take down this post 
---
OMG yes. I wasted so much renown back in the day. It was bad. I would buy all the sights for every operator.
---
They are messing with you
---
Here's a tip if you haven't figured this shit out yet doc. Shoot them in the head. And they fucking die. Damage doesn't matter then. And the shotgun is one of the better defender shotguns. But then again my playstyle works well with valk because I can actually hit people in the head and kill them. Shotgun is situational and useful.
---
Kinda irrelevant, but good in a coordinated team in very niche scenarios.
---
Why is this even remotely close to being SI playlists fault???
---
I will just wanted to go here for some help also
---
[Why are you lying?](https://r6.tracker.network/profile/psn/dobstp/seasons)
---
I used the G36C when I first started playing because I wasnt used to the recoil (came from overwatch on console to R6 on PC), and once I got through my Ash/Jager phase I just kinda didnt want to play her enough to get used to the R4C's recoil and I kept the G36C on at all times. I dont have to 'get used' to her anymore pog
---
Maybe they don‚Äôt see each other 
---
This! It was a right decision to remove nades from her.
---
I want Ela to be Jager-like: strong gun, useful ability, no nades for deep roaming.
---
Jager can be played efficiently as semi-roamer/anchor because of his 416-C. Ela should be like him for me.
---
*Budum tssssss*
---
Yeah ik can you explain to me what happened 
---
I‚Äôm interested. PC or Console?
---
Oh my god... how do you not understand that only this NEW ACCOUNT is 43. I'm done here you dont just have bad comprehension. You're fucking retarded.  Also I'm an
---
if this happens to me I would be pissed.
---
Because #killsmatter
---
They don‚Äôt ban console players. This is 100% allowed as far as they‚Äôre concerned 
---
Same. Early days of Operation Chimera. Feltso frustrated I didn't play the game for 2 weeks. 
---
Just muckin' around, relax. *under breath* Least I'm not sampling my own produce ...
---
It‚Äôs such bull I just wanna er it trending see if I can take a stand some way
---
Hijacking this if you don't mind...
---
Where could I get gear like this?
---
Anyone remember having to buy the original ops? They would stagger in price so the more you bought the more they cost.
---
I had unlocked all the non dlc ops a little later they gave them out for free
---
Casual and you didn't leave?
---
Wth?
---
MFW they go Glaz on consulate 
---
You should've shot, that was entirely your fault
---
No
---
Should have put skittlz instead of macie jay tho, mostly because they move like if their having a seizure...
---
Not really, it's for testing operators and new features before releases. 
---
Or maybe my melee should have killed him after the first 5 times??
---
yep 
---
literally thx ubi
---
Velvet Shell for me
---
1/2016
---
You hit his shield 100% of the time, he just turned. But yeah, shields need changing for going against them and playing as one. 
---
Put a lenny face on it
---
I'd be down
---
They're thinking of making the damage they shoot at you deal damage to them or something, there is a vid on YouTube about burnt horizon and the technical changes
---
I know I should have shot but you would think one of those would have connected lol 
---
Beta, so I think that was Aug 2015 or something like that. I have about 3,500 hours on PS4 (probably more if you include the hours on Xbox and PC I've also put in). 
---
And I'm still learning new things in OLD maps all the time. The depth this game has is out of this world. 
---
Ik what you mean but most of the time he‚Äôs genuinely mad. Look at Macie, he doesn‚Äôt over exaggerate stuff to be entertaining, atleast I find him more fun to watch than KG. Also most of the time he gets more viewers on than KG
---
Remove dups!! The amount of times I've gotten the same item within the space of 5 packs is insane! 
---
cause he needs a buff
---
this is a big fuck no. no more shields i beg you. 
---
Don't play Secure Area üôÜ
---
Not really, I definitely would've blamed myself there for not shooting. 
---
Cyka blyat; same as everything else in Russian.
---
Never seen Pengu rage as much as KG. Even tho he‚Äôs the best player in the world, he should get more mad than KG when he dies but he doesn‚Äôt.

Oh god oh fuck I‚Äôm shaking and crying rn

The spawn point I'm most worried about is the northern one. 
---
You have this sneaky run out on the western veranda. You could also bust open the bottom of the double doors on the east restaurant double door. You could also do a run out on the north-middle veranda. It's terrifying. All I can say is I will be avoiding the northern (camping) spawn at launch.

I loved the Water on Mars episode(episodes?)

I want my renown back for all the renown I spent on these ubi so I can smash it into alpha packs only to get duplicates and end up with it back on my account

Since release, ps4 joined pc I wanna say during White Noise.

Was it hard? That type of drone parkour takes skill, let me tell you. I spent 5 years in Afghanistan honing that skill and oh oh boy was it a ride!
---
the fucking beast 
---
Blood orchid my guy 
---
then you get shit like lion/yellow people glaz/TTS nomad because the average player can't even utilise 20% of a broken operator power whilst in pro league they run rampant.
---
In the first few seasons / years people were obsessed with getting to diamond. Now that a lot of people have hit their goals of plat / diamond, they're now trying to get copper. It's become really toxic. 
---
Wow Dying Light 2 gameplay looks sick! 
---
CHUNGUS?
---
Mostly americans? How do you get that idea?
---
Not entirely sure why its an issue that they play with this aspect ratio. If its more comfortable to them and it doesnt give then an unfair advantage over you, whys it matter?
---
I‚Äôd like to see a buff to his primary as well. Maybe a 75 round magazine.
---
7 americans
---
5 british
---
5 french
---
5 russian
---
4 germans
---
2 everyone else
---
nah thats not enough just hive him unlimited energy bullets and since its energy theres no recoil :)
---
Not thick enough
---
Thank you for this piece of art 
---
As in that a lot of americans have been added that replaced other potential countries for no reason. They could have atleast added some germans and russians. Not expecting any more of any DLC country but atleast the base ones
---
Still doesnt explain how were only getting Americans and theyre replacing everything when theyre not. We got 1 last year 2 in year 1 and 4 launched with the game. Thats not "taking over" in any right 
---
You're welcome my dude
---
This would be a great idea to play with your friends in a custom game. Imagine having a drone fight 
---
Theres only been 3 more added man and one was part of a British based season so hes only technically an american op. So again how so?
---
Has 141 bullets and reloads, kills 2 ppl who were injured from claymore
---
Its not. But we could have had more countries. Other people from different countries would like to see their country and there are still a lot of important countries to cover.
---
My personal idea would be some sort of anti stealth device for reinforced walls that delays the attacker or alerts the defense since his silence is one of the stupidest parts of his gadget.m. As silly as it sounds, even having an operator set up floodlights pointed towards walls would work well. Basically function like a blinding effect to anyone looking through the holes and limit their ability to get free kills until they can deal with the floodlights (which taken out should be able to alert the defense considering a giant light just got removed from the room). With smaller holes, it would be harder to pinpoint the blinding light's location, but larger holes like Thermites would allow enough view to pin point its center. 
---
D E T A I L S
---
Oh fucking boo boo I‚Äôve gotten like 13 commons in a row right now
---
Were getting a lot of them this year too. Theres also the fact americans have a lot of variety in their spec ops which is why theyre very popular. But personally I don't really think this to be true. 
---
It‚Äôs that guy adjusting to your knife not ur fault
---
Isnt year 4 the last year?

Was it though ?

I get more satisfaction out of killing caviera than I do when I get a 3k

On steam, right click siege in the library and go in to properties, go to DLCs and untick that box I think it should be 
---
That did the trick! Thank you, it's now only 80gbs
---
Solid advice there.
---
Instead, think of your teammate as bait - as in if I were an attacker who takes out that teammate, where would I be? Then position yourself accordingly to take out that attacker who is focused the that teammate.
---
This isn‚Äôt the same photo, the ears don‚Äôt match and there‚Äôs no facial hair.

I think he means Yacht. The map design of Yacht is linear but not to the extent of Plane.

mine is 75gb without ultra dlc allthouhgt i will run on ultra
---
cant forget the yacht t poser
---
Alex Remy said that it is useless now since they have the new TK system now. So Ubi did not confirm it officially
---
I have been trying to do this for a month now glad to see someone finally did it haha
---
How were the days better lmao, the game was bugged to shit.
---
As it is, there are already too few maps, coming from Counterstrike where there was literally hundreds of maps.
---
One thing I liked about CS was that it left the original maps unmolested and offered a version 2 of the map that is improved. So fans of the original still get to play it.
---
WHAT
---
ADDS TO R6 EXPERIENCE?
---
I hear his heavy breathing because you prefer Alibi over him, so he angry.

Funny, you keep trying to pass off this idea that "most ideas are suggested by Pros" but you can't actually name any cases of this.

I have multiple times. One is that building a new op isnt just "take these guns from the game and put them in" voicing them has 21 (as of right now) separate voicelines required. And to add a country but take everything from other countries is not only lazy but extremely boring. Id rather not have operators added just to have a rainbow of ops and have actually interesting ops with new and nuanced abilities rather then a fucking check board of nationalities just for the sake of it.
---
Is that the strawberry fields skin on his fmg

Perfect!

It‚Äôs a joke that it.

How do you guys get your main names?
---
I remember being able to unlock Mira but not being able to buy any attachments for her guns. I played with iron sight Vector for quite some time. 
---
I would honestly have a fuckin fruit salad of emotions if i was the unfortunate fucker
---
Can they just rework Tower? It is literally the only map I see come up and feel like clicking return to menu immediately.
---
If Favela was too full of destructible walls, Tower is the absolute opposite with floors and walls that are bulletproof.
---
Probably is rocking some Air Pods underneath.
---
that's how mafia works 
---
It's really easy, the only tough part is the jump to the painting because it is fairly inconsistent.
---
Didn't G2 just play that other team in the SI finals in that unbalanced map which the announcers said favoured defenders?
---
TLDR: even the ranked maps in Sixth Invitational was unbalanced.
---
Thank you

He doesn't mean anything at all, "Jackal Main".

How to delete someone post? 
---
Smoke/mute are the only operators who we don't know right?
---
Mira is an intel op though, instead of a camera you have a window, same purpose different application.
---
Good old days when you were able to farm 50k in one hour.
---
Never had the chanse to play it :(

Twitch: *cryes in the corner*

This.
---
we all know Lion is overpowered in coordinated teams and has one of the highest ban rate in pro-league, 
---
but even without the upcoming nerf, he is borderline useless in the **average pub games** without the "Jackal&amp;Friends" Meme team.
---
Adding a "runout" tag does not exactly make the attacker's team runout-proof. The tag will make runouts risky at the starting phase, but becomes less effective it you do a runout mid-game with the attacker's back facing you.
---
This new passive idea would not make lion any more op for good pre-made teams while giving it more utility for casual solo games.
---

The myth says Montreal is in Canada. But it‚Äôs just French America

Also you had 4 people.

For me it was very good

I think I have a better name for him...Demo
---
Also maybe not sheriff, make him like a rainbow's explosives expert
---
He keeps leaming without aiming to flex on console nibbas
---
Well if you're sprinting at attackers and expecting to win the gunfight every time then your playstyle is kinda flawed.
---
She has those concussion mines for a reason, and that's to put yourself at an advantage when engaging with the attackers.
---
The Scorpion still can shred 1-2 enemies below 10m, especially when the enemy can't retaliate efficiently.

There‚Äôs where he went when he said he was gonna get milk

im thermite main how do i get that lil tag.
---
Okay kid. I will talk to your mom when she allows to play ;)
---
I finally saved up the 22500 it takes to buy packs from just playing normally. Took me a while to acquire it and was originally gonna buy one of the last 5 operators I needed...
---
I got 5 packs instead and got 4 commons and a rare that was just solid green for an operator I don't even use. Hurts so damn much man.
---
I hate map reworks. I just figured all this shit out and then it gets completely changed.
---
Echo's device isn't a phone, more of a sort of PDA mounted on his wrist, thus may be screened differently in terms of protocols (probably also to avoid others finding a way to control Yokai)
---
What did you expect from a game called rainbow six where you play in a team of 5 player ?
---
if youre on here via pc check the right side, should be an option set your flair.  
---
otherwise.....welcome thermite....mmmmmmmmmmm...
---
Because he does not use a "regular" phone like the other operators, he has it integrated in his uniform.
---
Good stuff man. I also prefer Mira with a red dot.
---
Wow! Awesome idea! Attacker spawn could be from small boats, and up ropes to the platforms. Very good idea and an up vote from me.
---
He threw his phone away because she kept calling him
---
They didn't give the game mode an official ending, and honestly we want it. 
---
I have no memory of the names, but imo only one of the 3 is epicm
---
That‚Äôs one stupid Monty. 
---
Yeah I meant Oregon kitchen, sorry
---
Hey man that's pretty coo.... ooooh wait it's a custom game :|
---
SMOMK
---
They have never changed any weapon for any operator so I doubt that will happen, also scorpion is fine. 
---
Thays wonderful! I would be delighted to see it grow. I love the game, love the community and want to contribute to it in a big way! Its open now for you and everyone else to contribute good sir! Fee free to have at it! üí™
---
IDK about you guys but im doing GREAT with the holo on r4-c
---
What‚Äôs in the... filters?
---
10/10 would want to know what's in the canister 
---
I can't tell if you're being serious. Her operator logo, is obviously a knife.
---
Then people complain when I mute people in chat and lone wolf nearly all rounds. Sometimes you just need five seconds into the operator screen to see that the round is gonna be a shit show.
---
I really appreciate you taking the time to give feedback! üôè
---
He looks so dumb
---
Maybe they decided to fix the ear a little bit and the facial hair maybe is just the resolution isn't enough?
---
What I mean is that the abilities of the defender will maybe fit very good to a Secret Service Operator and not to a Danish special unit. We will see what part his lore will take when they come out.  
---
What Id love to see is when he has a danish background (Like Frost an Asian background). But that‚Äôs unlikely. I still don‚Äôt get why they split some seasons with 2 different special units 
---
Exactly what I was thinking, glad you liked my idea!
---
Well I don‚Äôt play nearly as much as you obviously. 
---
Even I didn‚Äôt believe it I‚Äôm never getting as lucky again 
---
Sounds like it
---
No probs. I'll go check the site out after wrok.
---
You seem to forget that ash acog.
---
*screams internally and gets banned by dming everyone thats connected to ubisoft*
---
Happy microphone day
---
I never wanted a change in the holo, I really didn't care about it but I appreciate the change, the colour matching the weapon and the reflections I think it's great
---
Nothing has been announced so probably not
---
hip fire is genuinely shit in siege.
---
I have never seen direct harassment to females, but I think that most girls don‚Äôt talk while playing. Probably because they are afraid of situations where people begin harassing them. 
---
Someone I know someone who is female and plays r6s has told some of her stories to me. Most of them include guys who sounds drunk, try to ‚Äòcompliment‚Äô her on her ‚Äúwomanly parts‚Äù, ask her out and attempt to befriend her.
---
Of course females aren‚Äôt exempt exempt from being toxic either. I have had experiences where a group of females would constantly complain when they died or when we lost a round, and TK when told to be quiet.
---
Of course toxicity against females are bad, but I believe we should begin stopping toxicity at the base first before targeting toxicity directed at different demographics. Gubisoft needs to fix this soon as IMO this game is extremely hard to play when people who TK, leave games, and target people simply because of who they are, are still playing this game without barely any consequences.
---
well, check his concept arts. He has face which might not satisfy you though..  
---
The real face might be different in the game when it's revealed...
---
most ash diamonds use holo or reflex so i dont know how that makes any sense
---
Although I did enjoy it, it could have done with some better challenges since you usually had to do 3 or so missions before you completed one, and matchmaking made you do the missions in a random order
---
Exactly I'm the same way! It's just like oh cool thanks Ubi that's a nice change for aesthetics. But then like I said people are flipping shit smh 
---
‚ÄúWhy are you even there?!‚Äù
---
I mean smoke is still a really good operator. How balanced is it that he basically can get 2 primaries at once.
---
Machine pistols are probably one of the hardest things to balance around.
---
Who cares about pro level. Put the ‚Äògood‚Äô maps into ranked and pro and leave every map in casual. Leave us our maps and stop pandering to 0.005% of players because of flaws in one map under very particular circumstances. There‚Äôs better things to be doing. 
---
Scorpion is not fine.  
---
Downpour.
---
Yeah, it's cool, I just wish that they used a proper Russian urban camo, like [Kamish Urban](https://2img.net/h/i601.photobucket.com/albums/tt91/doc446/49186200.jpg) instead of the Ukraine-used [TTsKO blue](https://www.timpul.md/uploads/modules/news/2014/02/55652/why-ukraines-berkut-special-police-force-is-so-scary.jpg).

It really sucks I love siege as a game but it's so frustrating the way the game is being played atm
---
He lost it spawnpeaking
---
I have a different team (full Plat 3). You want to scrim DM me. We are all germans
---
With the recent changes announced I realized that the community is really ungrateful, like the game is great, it survived a lot of bugs and all, the devs try to please all kind of players and they just complain 
---
It really isn‚Äôt that difficult to simply change the color of an item. Because of this, it cannot be compared to the bugs seen in the TS.
---

'nother former cs player checking in here. The g36 is easier to to hit head shots with. Don't be a little lord fuckpants about it.
---
It's already stupid that Ying is only immune to her candelas, having Blitz being immune to flashes would be a "bruh" moment for her.
---
Ubi care about pro level. Plain and simple. 
---
LUL
---
I know it's so sad. I love this game but things have been killing it for me lately and the community is a big part 
---
I love the game too, comunity is sometimes good sometimes bad but I met many great people just talking through voice chat and with some of them I'm playing sometimes.
---
Btw sorry for my bad english its not my primary language
---
And let's make cavs silent step make her invisible, and immune to bullets. And give tachanka a machine gun on a unicycle.

Yup... I only play when I'm with at least three friends now because random players are just to tiring
---
I see your point, but for me the smg 11 is uncontrollable.  I just wish they reversed the nerf for him. :(
---
Yea its all set up for freesync, the game is perfectly fine in borderless. Runs super smooth just want the extra bit of performance from full screen mode, I'll probably just have to settle for borderless though.
---
Ok
---
It wasn‚Äôt perfect but it was three linear campaign PVE style maps that was a change of pace for most siege players as well as including a whole bunch of story and lore. It managed to be challenging and require teamwork as much as MP.
---
when the \*canister\* kicks in
---
But people such as pengu paint her as a bigger problem then she would be if she just was balanced properly instead of they are doing, I don‚Äôt care ash specifically is getting nerfed, I don‚Äôt player. I‚Äôm worried that they will start giving other 3 speed attackers no acog regularly.
---
Being Siege he was probably spectating teammates for that long while dead.

Heheh I though this was just kinds meming until I thought about how handy it can be

I always feel bad because my friends are low rank but I'm plat and I get matched against the middle ground so my friends get shit on and I carry and the other team is in a weird limbo, but I want to play with my irl friends in siege
---
The image you showed is a 5-3 match. 
---
That's an even game. It went to over-time. Sure the plat player dominated, for his side, but statistically the MMR system did it's job here.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you in general but this is a terrible example to illustrate your point.
---
Then maybe we could have actual spawns where we rappel from a helicopter....

When i get a purple it will be Black Ice for the french Defenders. 100% of every purple Pack i got in my R6 Career. I can‚Äòt count how many Black Ice Dupes i pulled.

Its good since i often play as Doc/Rook because of the MP5, but come on game there are a lot more Operators than those two Defenders.
---
Idk the x.x, but the one that added mozzie, out back, and gridlock
---
What have you done?
---
Have they found a fix for bullets going straight through shields from the front yet tho? Bc just yesterday i got killed by that once and damaged another time.
---
I have noticed it happening a lot in general when standing at barricaded windows, idk if that has an effect. 
---
Haven‚Äôt they always just stood there?

I was in a match with a full squad. The opposing team only had 1 player join in. We surrendered after 2 rounds because we felt sorry for him.

If you dont have a drone in big tower, there is no way to react to that jumpout, its rely just tryharding on a high level.

How do you destroy everything with just 25 buck shotgun bullets??
---
Ela is still pretty strong.
---
She used to be OP. She used to have no recoil at all, and with that firerate could spawnkill like no other. They nerfed her down to reason, her weapon is harder to use at long ranges, the 22 dmg is fine given how high the firerate is. She doesn't need any buff.

Ikr?
---
I'm just now finding out that Buck is a dude...
---
Maybe she loads single rounds into the chamber manually?
---
Yeah but once set up defenders don't really have an effective way of dealing with Airjabs, I mean if you are lucky maybe you have an Evil eye that can zap it or now with Mozzie a Twitch drone, but impacts are not really able to reliably remove the airjab like it is for say a claymore, and using a C4 feels a bit costly (and gives your position away fast).
---
Gridlock has average weaponry overall I'd say, yes the M249 hits hard but it has one of the lowest fire rates, the F90 is about the same as IQ's AUG, I agree however that the shotgun and pistol are both solid. Unlike Nomad however Gridlock's gadget can be shot and is usually in a predictable location, as in, the floor, not hidden away in some obscure angle no line of sight has. Still a powerful gadget that will probably see changes and tweaks as we go regardless, just perhaps a tad easier to counter than the Airjab.

Of course not. /s

I kinda like it though 
---
I‚Äôm more in the boat of if you down someone and they leave you should get the kill 
---
Yea I agree. I started playing on grim sky and missed it. So much effort for such a short time. New players wouldn't even know the lore existed. In fact many operator videos aren't even in the game client. Cutscenes are expensive, seems like a waste.
---
That‚Äôs also facts the amount of frost mats wasted and missed interrogations hurts.

I mean that on a respirator like lions finkas or mutes the air hoses from the air canister on his back would replace the cartridge of the respirator

Wow, just straight up destroys the claymore. Damn ubi, freaking make us use skill instead of luck. 
---
And many in the community decried these operators and their unreasonable distance from reality in these instances too. 
---
Should we get a wheelchair bound operator next? Or is that a bridge too far for you? 
---
 You think a small indy studio like Ubisoft can do something like that?
---
Beautiful. Thanks.

Perfect game. No bugs

---
DM me
---
Looks like a bug
---
"Car" eh?
---
Yeah, still doable you just gotta keep in mind launch distance which does make some original trap places impossible, like on Plane there were a couple places that you couldn't take out either without multiple impacts or a well thrown C4 that would be certain death for anyone caught but now the claymore just gets broked by some flying defenders
---
Kinda agreed, but it‚Äôs new. 
---
I‚Äôd rather play Tower in ranked than Fortress lol
---
I just leave it on top of the tv it‚Äôs good enough
---
I have over 60h played as Ela and I gotta say damn she is fun to play yet I'm certain her gun needs some work. No matter how meme it is gonna sound Ela supposed to be UNIQUE, that's why I really like 2) and 3). Right now I'm mostly using her shotgun since her gun is super inconsistent if it comes to getting kills... that's the same reason why I don't play any shields operators, they are all too buggy.

The recoil is still quite substantial, however I‚Äôve noticed they‚Äôve removed the random bouncing effect it has when you fire for a prolonged amount of time. So it‚Äôs a lot easier to control because it doesn‚Äôt bounce from left to right as much as it‚Äôs just predominantly just vertical.

There is no direct counter to Blackbeard himself. With the addition to nomad flanking him also becomes dangerous, so being able to get blind on a window is hard sometimes. Sometimes you also #Have to peek him if he‚Äôs guarding the bomb on a window. Blackbeard just like lion is fundamentally broken. Being able to survive a head shot no matter how few, is broken. There is no other way around it.

While I love Oregon, I hate maps like Tower and Fortress
---
well maybe they can work it like csgo, you play with other unranked people and slowly gain elo whiilst playing your first 10 matches, so you could be playing against silvers because you have won a couple games and worked up to that elo
---
The amount of effort put in makes me sad it'll probably never happen. I love the ideas, wish ubi could be this creative 
---
False. They could rework just like lion. Or they could remove him temporarily until he‚Äôs reworked. Other companies remove item temporarily that are just broken.

Not me m8, my friend.

Blitz is worse

#ONE FRIENDLY OPERATOR REMAINING
---
It's really good, I like it.
---
that‚Äôs the majority of video game subreddits, just a circle jerk of people complaining over stupid non-issues   
---
No one has ever done that!
---
Plzzzzzsszzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, I'll take 1 out of the three probably. But I'd be happy with any of the 3
---
Nice play, but reloaded at 141 bullets?
---
Woulda look at that! Great art for both my mains!
---
Good point, but i think the change necessitates more medic ops. Since making an entire mechanic revolve around one op would be mundane, not to mention not very balanced. 
---
I know finka has a temporary HP boost but im thinking more of an OP that is similar to Doc in the way Bandit is similar to Kaid or Mute.
---
An example i guess would be a 3 speed defender whose gadget is essentially to toss deployable med packs that defenders can pick up and get 20 hp healed (no overhealing, doesnt revive downed ops and has more charges than doc).
---
Who knows? Maybe some of the season 4 ops will be medic themed ops.

Amazing! Really well made, I could see these being added!
---
I feel like if they rewarded players with the outbreak packs for playing outbreak there would‚Äôve been way less bitching 
---
The memories and competitive fun tbh 
---
I know I am too. It‚Äôs so annoying not being able to switch it out. I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll see this and maybe implement it later down this new season 
---
Any fap mains out there?
---
As a new player (who is level 21), I can't really learn anything in casual. Everybody roams, constant tk or kick, no comms. I played 3 of my 10 ranked games yesterday and learned a lot more. 
---
 Maybe it's because you get more rounds on the map, or because people are actually calling things out. I didn't even know the compass gave you the room names. Lastly wouldn't it be better to play with copper or bronze players, then constantly getting destroyed by lvl 150 casual players. Just the opinion of someone brand new to siege. 
---
Did they confirm the launch day?
---
Would much rather static image. Not because of muh resources or anything, just annoys me having moving stuff on a menu screen.
---
happens a lot .... 
---
Use laser sight on that gun üòÇ
---
There's nothing wrong with what we have now. It's in no way poorly animated or low quality. I'd rather they focus on the important things anyway. Plus, there are tons of popular games out there with completely static main menus. At least they're putting in the effort to switch it up each season. That's more effort than most.
---
Jackal is very strong. Decent gadget, very powerful AR, smokes
---
But only here Air Forces are Special too.
---
I'd love more of these menu animations like with mozzie and gridlock. The finger gun animation is so cool.
---
2 smokes would have been more toxic
---
xd
---
J√§ger and Jackal
---
Can we talk about that poopy team call "outside"?! Pretty terrible info from his teammate there. 
---
Guess I main Hibana now
---
Actually that Burnt Horizon animations done by an internal Ubisoft partner. :) (Not R6, but Ubisoft). So they could do animations like that other than in game rendered animation.
---
lvl 90 here, been playing since chimera. My friends all played ranked because of the toxicity in casual, so the moment I was able to get into ranked, there was no other option if I wanted to play with them. I feel it helped me learn the maps faster, and because I had my group (guys ranged from bronze to gold) I learned a lot of the strategies for different sites, and typically finish right around gold 3 or 4.  
---
Best advice I could give to a new player looking to play ranked is just jump in a custom game with a friend and look at the map. Figure out the layout so you know where you're going, and maybe get an idea of what to reinforce. Other than that get a group you can play with because communication is huge. Then you just got to get exposure. 
---
Ok, so I see a lot of these comments getting downvotes, but you SHOULD have shot. As someone who's loved Monty, and has played him since before he was good (pre-c4 nerf), I can confidently say thay any enemy who comes in for the melee and doesnt shoot is a free kill. I dont recall ever getting knifed as Monty, and, if I was, it's because of my own stupidity.
---
Any shield with half a brain will simply turn their body so that the shield is facing your second melee. This isn't broken, so much as you just messing up. Not trying to be rude, but just accept it. You should have shot.
---
You just activated my trap card! 
---
How do you know which way they will be blasted though?

---
Yeah honestly. I've also been hoping for like a live operator view instead of the cards when you pick your op. Like they have the weapons and uniform and stuff you choose, and they're like doing they're little shuffling thing they do on their menu 
---
I probably do that once a day
---
Wasn't the first one the one that had the oil rig mission? You had the target that was kill or capture, I think, but all the guy did was sit in his room with an SMG and would spray the moment you entered unless you used a flash.

Cause ubi is bad 
---
Diamond for reference is 1200 MMR higher than Platinum 3. That is a pretty massive skill gap. Often times it will be me and 4 mid-golds against 4 diamonds and a bronze (that they are boosting off of) which is pretty frustrating.
---
I don't have a problem playing with Plat 1s I guess, even though the MMR gap between Plat 2 &amp; 1 is pretty massive. But this really needs to be addressed by the devs finally. It has been over 3 years. 
---
No it isn't, it is great 
---
The diamonds are probably queuing up with lower ranks to mess up the match making

Nearly 2 years actually. They were removed around chimera correct? Or was it before that? Tbh idek but either way i enjoyed those days. It made renown seem more important.

---
Wait. Who said that u can‚Äôt kill with it after the patch?
---
There are plenty. This is during peak hours. I regularly run into teams stacked with diamonds. They are just boosting off a lower level party host. It is stupid common and needs to be addressed. 
---
Its perfect
---
By giving it to everyone or taking it away that removes a lot of variety to the game, running ACOG on every op would be boring af IMO.

At least with the way it is it encourages different playstyles.

---
That is exactly what is happening. And that is what I want to hear Ubisoft address finally, after 3 years of bad ranked matchmaking. Placement matches should take into account the previous season's MMR (which it doesn't) and ranked matches should have some kind of rank lock to lock out high ranks from boosting off of low ranks by queuing up with them. 
---
I did. If xbox dvr recorded party chat you would hear me losing my shit and my friend telling me "stop that now."

Well, it's not like they are making a bad excuse. Something like a high quality CGI render would presumably take up a lot of space. It's common knowledge that Sony and Microsoft have data limits on games that are on their platform. The game is around 70-100GB of space on PC and will probably be near the same on consoles. It's become a meme at this point but it is a proper reason.
---
They don't have these restrictions on PC but the thing is Ubi doesn't have any incentive to cater to the PC audience specifically. It's not like CSGO where every player is on PC and nothing else, it's also not like many console games which make deals with one of these platforms for exclusivity and other deals.
---
Car? was broke? Now isn't broken anymore? What does it possibly say under the no bubble? So many questions!
---
I don't get it.
---
Too much effort. It's Ubisoft and they've proven that they'll just do the bare minimum to make money in r6, that's it.

Bar/game is my favorite place to defend.
---
I think it has a bit of a flash point with teamwork and communication. It's very, very hard to defend without some coordinated effort. However, with just a bit of team work, it quickly becomes one of the easiest places to defend.
---
Thanks but I actually play on Xbox. Is it even possible on consoles?
---
The cartoonishly childish route their taking the skin system in this game is ridiculous. Keep it military.
---
Why is no one pointing out that Glaz didn‚Äôt react to Jaeger at all, almost as if he was invisible.
---
Aren't they? Besides Lion and finka, i'd say most of the operators have been pretty creative. 
---
I was hoping that there was gonna be an infected gamemode during it
---
Ok I keep hearing ops are free but I still have to pay renown to unloc year one ops. 
---
The longer u charge the brighter the flash
---
I see someone gets no kills
---
i laughed when you ditched the gun to get the melee. nice one!
---
i got both set correctly, its not me just failing with aim, it has to do with network issues. thats why people can still shoot me when im already behind cover. and that some shots just dont deal any damage at all.
---
the no limits mode has been proposed many times and it would be garbage. having 5 blitz‚Äôs and ash‚Äôs would be garbage. having 5 lesions and 5 maestros would be garbage. same with the full power mode or whatever. having OP ops mixed with balanced ops is trash and they were nerfed for a reason 
---
FoRtNiTe BlOoM iS tOo MuCh.

This isn't really a rework, just a big Nerf to his existing kit. 
---
Then I would recommend those intel anchor operators. Maestro, echo, valk. On attack I would probably do thatcher, sledge, or Montague. These are usually support that has other people push with you. What rank and system?   
---
Wish I could play them again, I started during outbreak and sucked at it.
---
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt sprint while charging‚Äù he‚Äôs going for a brisk walk then?

Without the flash it's pretty easy to just mince his feet while he's sprinting.

Another reason to have my country in the game
---
Everyone's opinion is subjective. I had a blast for the three weeks it was live, and I felt like it was a refreshing breath of fresh air. Not to mention, when asked about the community's feelings after the event, it was almost an even split between those who enjoyed the mode and those who did think it was underwhelming. 
---
It‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm just retarded and thought of charge in the wrong context

Does this mean it‚Äôs illegal to play those characters during November? :thinking:

You know there are 7 maps in the pro league map pool. Stop being intentionally dishonest. Playing 7 good maps is better than playing 14 where at least 6 of them have extremely boiled down strats or poor design. Playing consulate 3 times in a row is still better than playing consulate, then Hereford, then Kafe.

---
Minus the spot where her gadget still sucks, and Buck's C8-SFW is basically the same as Ash's, especially if you play him right and aren't using it like a sniper rifle, and he has the best DMR in the game, which is worth it if you ARE using Buck at ranges longer than where the C8 can be easily controlled by anyone above Bronze.

---
This is my drone spot every time. It‚Äôs the best flank watching drone on the map. Ok Maybe not THE BEST, but it‚Äôs a great one and most people don‚Äôt see it
---
No. I place like from 3 to 5 (sometimes more) kills per rounds. I just see many people ignoring everything around them and going solely for kills in this game like it's CoD. When it's for example 5v1 then everyone wants the last person alive and they all die leaving you in a 1v1 situation. Changing it to dealt damage it shouldn't be that serious
---
Is a huge "optional" advantage really optional?
---
I would just get it for an operator you play. Rook may not have the best elite, though I bought it due to me maining him.

True, ya got me there

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.

Please re-post your submission using standard letters.
---
The point of the game is to kill to other team... No matter how much you "play strategically" if you die before the other team, than it doesn't matter how smart you play 
---
and I find that very welcome, because the recent ones have been somewhat underwhelming. Hereford, Villa, and Fortress play way too similar for me, and have what feels like "filler" sites. Like, on Hereford, top floor and basement are quite fun and interesting, and first floor has some potential thanks to the huge wall in the middle and stairs splitting the two sites, but the second floor site is just "i sleep". On villa, the top floor sites are also quite fun, but for me the 1st floor sites might as well not exist. And Fortress has some cool ways to enter, but the actual push to each site feels exactly the same. 
---
Compare it to like chalet, which is not a great map by any means, but the sites are all very different which makes playing it much more fun for me
---
That right there is the one and only reason I don't use lasers.
---
Maybe it was a preview of something larger to come? Or take it down after 3 weeks, fix up the bugs and ship it back out. But since it's not a huge part of the game they can take their time. 
---
Looks like an elephant. 
---
Nope. I'm a team player and most of the times I don't get mad about assists. I've been playing lesion lately and assists are okay to me
---
It was requested
---
"misleading title"
---
I honestly think that his pistol should be holstered while his shield is out and his sprint should be his ability and while sprinting you press the fire button to flash. You‚Äôd have unlimited flashes with a charge up but he could only sprint a limited time and his melee is his primary form of combat but can use his pistol at the risk of putting his shield away.
---
Not to mention the current engine we have in-game I think they said, (and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) only has the capability of keeping broken objects/debris client side to prevent a lot of lag too. 
---
yess i got to updoot from 999 to 1.0k!!
---
That's honestly just how the internet is 
---
Why? Them saying they're going to make improvements is not the same as saying they have a terrible make.
---
I've taken the reworks on these maps to be more in the improvement category. They've seen how the gameplay actually works out and have opportunities to react/improve.
---
Arguably, every map has room for improvement. Doesn't mean that it should be taken out of rotation.
---
I feel like this is saying that you shouldn't drive a Cadillac around because it's not a Rolls Royce. Sure, a Rolls Royce is "better", but it's not like a Cadillac is a bad car either.
---
Oh. Apparently it's not possible, many people suggested it but there's just not enough buttons
---
Missed a spot :)
---
This is gonna suck to hear, but vigil will most likely not gonna be getting an elite anytime soon. No big crowd is asking for it and Ubi is going through the seasons slowly, and it'll take a while for them to get to white noise
---

That still leaves stuff like gathering Intel, opening up the map, and securing the objective all unaccounted for. The objective isn't just to kill your opponents, but also to plant the defuser/take over the room/grab the hostage. Damage also doesn't mean anything if they don't go down/die. A team of 1 hp people could still win the game.
---
PS4 upgrade question.
---
I've got the standard edition on disk (before all the starter edition nonsense). Through the grind I've unlocked 4 of the year 1 ops and have nomad through the pack giveaway.
---
If I buy the gold edition in sale in the PS store am I right in thinking I'll get the year 4 pass and operators, the other 4 year 1 ops unlocked that I'm missing and get to keep nomad and can give the disk to a friend to play?
---
Apologies if this has been answered already but everything I've read has been related to PC.

Why is learning bomb sites that won't get picked in ranked important? 
---
Yes but sometimes people when being on bombsite completely forget about the defuser and just go after the alive people instead of playing the objective and winning the round. Killing is a second factor

Winning is fun. I watch pro league so that I know how to win more, so I can have more fun, by winning. Sometimes that involves doing things that pros do. I can have more fun in this game that I love by winning using strategies that players better than me (pros) are using.
---
I fail to understand how shunning pro league and all the strategies that can be learned from it makes the game more fun for you.

One of my favorite highlight compilations put together by u/ace0136 and featuring our friend group. We encounter quite a few funny moments, but his skills in editing and in Siege are no small part of this!

No I don't believe so. They addressed at the end of OP Health/Beginning of Blood Orchid that they had to remove and possibly alter some of the maps and operators because of the data limits but other than that I don't think it's been brought up.
---
This game mode had potential. I loved the selected few characters you could use, the different enemies you had and how to kill them. I know it got repetitive but it wasn‚Äôt based on you, it was based on your team. It definitely could‚Äôve been a small campaign, we know how it ends. Or do we? We all know how it starts, but what if it‚Äôs somewhere else too? Another part of the world.. how about some terrorist grab a hold of a sample of the virus. Invasion and those are only scouts??? So many possibilities for such a small project... 
---
But don‚Äôt mind me, just saying stuff as a concerned gamer, that‚Äôs all. 
---
Cool they look great
---
That's not hentai, that's a God damn Shakespearean tragedy.

You said in this comment he‚Äôs annoying. If there‚Äôs a way to add a little more skill on both sides it would make him less annoying. You could also give a small buff to blitz along side this like more range on the flash since the other players have time to react to the flash
---
It gets better, I thought the same at first but j'played through it, now it rarely happens to me. There are Just a lot of low level trolls and smurf who ruin it for all the low level players 
---
they already have a charge period after you use the flash that lasts a second

I think you‚Äôre **underestimating** the reaction time of pros. You‚Äôve seen the clips where they turn as clash with the shield on their back and turn back around with their gun. They‚Äôre super fucking quick because Siege is all they do. 
---
You‚Äôre seriously trying to argue that a *pro* Blitz would outgun a **pro** Bandit let‚Äôs say. That‚Äôs so backwards I just can‚Äôt believe you even took that avenue. 
---
I‚Äôm not complaining about avoiding the flash either. I‚Äôm just saying that taking the movement away from a movement character after already nerfing the range of his flash into the ground is a bad move. 
---
I really don‚Äôt understand the point you‚Äôre trying to make here either. Is this a nerf? Or a useless change? ‚Äî in your eyes ‚Äî because the way I‚Äôm understanding your argument is that this is just... a change for the sake of changing it? You don‚Äôt seem to think it will make Blitz any less viable but you also don‚Äôt seem to think it will make him more viable. I‚Äôm confused on your argument all around. Why post a Blitz nerf if you refuse to admit it‚Äôs a nerf?
---
Yes, they used it as a reason why they can't do certain things with Operators.
---
Bro, portrait video of a screen? 
---
Yea, I know that. In terms of penetrative power Glaz's rifle is probably the highest, but I can't remember the caliber off the top of my head. D-eagle and Beowulf 50 rounds are high power low (relative) penetration. You probably meant to respond to OP there.
---
lol
---
The problem comes with the current ranking system. When you start out unranked at the beginning of a new season, you actually have a rank, and IIRC it's like mid Gold. Your wins and losses increase and decrease the ELO respectively until your ten placements are over and it shows you where you placed. However it also means you will have level 24s who are new to ranked playing with level 338 Plat Ones who have been playing since launch. You wont be playing against coppers and bronzes for a while because chances are you will end up either getting carried by higher level players who you wont learn a lot from because their game sense will be much more developed than yours, or you'll be with a relatively lower ranked team that gets absolutely stomped on so hard that you dont know what happened. What happens more often than not when new players hop into ranked before they really know maps and how the game works is that they end up hurting the elo of higher players, all whilst not learning much more than they really would in casual. Its better to play in casual until you learn the maps and operators, hence a higher level minimum requirement.
---
Or just bring back Clash's tongue because that's what we all really want 
---
Don‚Äôt afl renown farm, it‚Äôs gay.
---
What do you mean by that? And do you have a backstory for them? I‚Äôd love to read them 
---
I love Favela (on casual) because it just plays SOO differently than all the other maps. It's more hectic and fast paced imo. 
---
Kinda, it's nice to meet someone who also researchs
---
What does the game mode have to do with the fact Lion didn't work for multiplayer? 
---
I liked the rain though. Nice and calming.
---
In terrorist hunt you get ammo boxes to refill your ammo.
---
They do extract hostage because you can keep it going indefinitely. In the other ones you're not able to freely explore every part of the map without ending the t-hunt.
---
Do they ever undo balance changes in the middle of a TTS cycle just to evaluate feedback? No. The change was likely made because it made Capitao's asphyxiating bolts too powerful. Don't be surprised if Burnt Horizon launches with a toned-down version of the changes (or no change at all).

I'm saying wait until the australian season starts and see what the price of everything is. You will even have gathered some extra renown by that time
---
Hire this guy!
---
Lol, here I was thinking how cool the menu screens are in R6.
---
Excuse me but wtf (that Fallout-meme)
---
Thank you comrade.
---
Fixed btw
---
Then you‚Äôll get teamkilled by nades if someone wants to teamkill you. 
---
Xbox or PS4? I‚Äôm still learning advanced parts of siege but I have about 300 hours on Xbox and I‚Äôd be willing to play with ya a bit
---
&gt;Damn this early? Yeah but they'll be early prototypes right for December 2019 when they release they can't be fully fleshed out right? 
---
What do you mean "early prototypes by December"?
---
Its bullshit but you really should have pushed the rook
---
Just saying to change the nationality not the entire operator. 
---
Still so pissed that stuff never got used.  All her (?) concept art was so cool!!
---
My point was all the negative feedback I saw on this sub was directed towards MP not Outbreak, besides from being a bit repetitive Outbreak seemed pretty well received after being released.
---
Ah okay, that seems reasonable too. I guess I'll shoot a couple bullets next time then into the windows. I figured it wasn't for wall banging because they do it on the prep phase.
---
I remember when there was the mission inside the hospital me and Another friend, we had to go to On the landing pad, the amount of enemies was high (we were playing for the charms) After that game, we stayed 20 minutes on the menu üòÇ
---
Haha yeah you‚Äôre right, I apologize.
---
10/10 would buy her elite skin.
---
Ping wheel slots can be changed 
---
Definitely perfect.
---
the nail gun might have better range than the balif
---
ah sorry
---
Blitz‚Äôs range was significantly nerfed a while back.  You might have to be closer than you think.
---
Booo
---
What I dont get just make shield bash like an airjab. When you got with a shield it just knocks them over and then you gotta finish. Keep people playing as a team and corridinating while still being useful and removing defenders from the fight? 
---
It‚Äôs defenders that do it though. And it‚Äôs to break the glass so they can hear better 
---
They dont realize that if you just kinda spray into the shield the hitbox on it will just kinda go, "meh", and let a few go through.
---
Although I prefer real communication like open the damn mic. but I solo queue a lot and people on my team would barely open their mic (or they would but it'd be 4 people speaking italian or french and make the game miserable for me because of the shouting and rage. Please dont do that) even tho my mic is on. So something like this wouldn't hurt at all and in fact it'd be really helpful for solo players. 
---
Oh man, haven't thought about [as_oilrig](https://cso.fandom.com/wiki/Oilrig) for CS 1.x in forever!  
---
Im holding and it automatically cancels halfway through
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs still those dicks in casual though
---
Knew how to get up to the lamp, but wasn't aware of the loudspeaker steps :O  
---
Now I have a new goal in my life
---
This is really good. Well done! 
---
Nah, you right. I've played PC Siege for a couple years now and randoms are usually hella toxic.
---
Smart child
---
Is the problem where his flash still effects you even if you‚Äôre turned away still a thing 
---
Thank you, Lion's Vector and Miras (on the other sheet) are my favourite weapons. I live the way they look.
---
Probably either renown boosting or deranking 
---
This is basically a Lion Dokkabei combo though? Also what would the counters be?
---
Keep up the good work!!
---
Where is Zofia?
---
Yeah she looks visibly kind of chubby but it doesn't *necessarily* mean she's not stronk too.
---
I don't think any of the other operators look that overweight, although it's difficult to tell from the ones with full armor on (and not cargo shorts and a t-shirt...)
---
dammit
---
This is so good!!
---
They need a couple for each season imo
---
Yeah the 2nd one is complete shit.
---
It says it in the post but level 58
---
'data limits' but the fucking game is 100GB
---
still don't understand how that's even possible
---
You know what‚Äôs worse than tearing, input lag
---
9/9/45
---
400 dpi
---
What keeps me playing siege is the awful servers.
---
I rather have tears than input lag 
---
Yes thats with season pass owners
---
That was brutal.
---
Only problem with fap mains is Lesion makes the whole game unplayable
---
In the game right now? Yes.
---
With this suggested fix? No, because that would defeat the purpose of being able to turn around.
---
No, that's your clearance level. I'm talking about your rank, like copper, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, or diamond.
---
That was the partüòÇ
---
PeruVian

Wait so early access starts tomorrow right?

where is my stamp for everything TH related ? where is it....?

**YES PLEASE , UBI LISTEN TO THE OP!**
---
This! I LOVED the close-up photos, especially the ones with [CTU patches](https://i.imgur.com/9IZgudL.png) and the like. It's so light on resources, too.
---
No thats tts people on pc play new operation march 6 should be the release date
---
*They know too much, silence them.*
---
Usually it's platinum players with very low rank players to boost.
---
But I thought you said it comes 7 days early for season pass holders. 
---
What about the users with multiple accounts? One ranked for their 5 stacks and one ranked for their solo queues.  Raising that bar might lower Ubisoft return on multiple accounts.
---
"Fan-Made" I dunno, it didn't really roll off the tongue all that well... 
---
Season starts tomorrow but season pass holders get the ops exclusively for the first 7 days then they everything opens to the public.
---
Would be so unfair on console players, they wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance
---
Ok thanks. 
---
When burnt horizon is released you cant buy the ops with r6 creds or renown 
---
Those arms though
---
All grounds are covered my friend.  I really appreciate the concert.
---
I believe they said the TS will be 3 weeks from now on not 2. so if that starts this season then it will not come out till the 12th
---
Sledges mask reminds me of those training masks
---
This is live it‚Äôs just hold to crouch spam correct? 
---
Now I see why he only has one
---
Rainbow six blitz royale
---
Yes!! There's nothing more satisfying than a shotgun flank (Bandit main)
---
Trusty ol spot
---
It‚Äôs a menu ffs
---
I know but I said just have an option you know just an option like fortnite has cross play
---
Aids
---
I really don‚Äôt like Outback, it feels a lot like Bartlett 2 to me. You can just leave 1 player around site on defense and just full court press the attackers because the only ways inside are through windows. Mozzie and Gridlock are great though, Mozzie may need some slight tweaking but I think it is okay for him to capture 3 drones because it‚Äôs not very consistent against coordinated players.
---
PS4 also has the touch pad which games never use for whatever reason. 
---
Or just remove the shield and make it a strobe flashlight. Can't wield your pistol while holding flashlight. 
---
Thank you so much for taking the time and writing a response. I really appreciate it and that is the exact idea behind it.
---
Already used

Buck‚Äôs arch nemesis: Grisly

I think you took a stab at the other guys too

Damn son. Amazing

shh no wrongthink allowed in this sub. Please stick to the "Ubi bad" format from now on. Thank you /s
---
Learn to arm aim. Get a proper desk setup. Measure sensitivity in cm/360. Use lowest dpi that gives you the control/consistency you need. Learn to change your multiplier. Warm up using other games because hand eye coordination and time hitting targets is what's going to get your coordination and aim up. But siege is a game where it can be up to 80% map knowledge depending on your skill level.
---
And to add insult to injury you get teamkilled at the start of the round and don‚Äôt even get to experience the game or have any fun :))))
---
Also when a teammate is following you ping the enemy above their head and stay to one side just enough so your guy can peek. Mic communication because everyone will try to c4 you, telling your teammate when to back up or run is pretty important for a temporary like that 
---
I‚Äôm indeed trying to get a little more karma, but it was never my intention to make it look like I worked together on artworks like this. That‚Äôs way to difficult for me. Im really sorry for the mistakes but this was my first day posting. I‚Äôll take the critics with me for the future.
---
I am talking about warming up your aim. Working that muscle memory back to optimal condition.
---
Look, if you do not think such an exercise would benefit you, all the better.
---
But many people in the community have expressed a desire to see such a feature.
---
Even some youtubers like Get Flanked said it would be nice (go watch his latest video about what he finds disappointing in the Y4 roadmap if you don't want to take my word for it).
---
All I'm saying is that some people would love for this to happen, and if you don't think it would be useful, you're ebtitled to your opinions.
---
well it almost never happens and it looks very goofy to me
---
It's a fact. Do a basic google search, there is absolutely zero use of visible lasers in combat. They use IR lasers that are only used under night vision. Are you totally clueless and trying to disagree with me still?
---
I very much agree
---
Exactly. This post isn't even a good idea, and all you have to do to realize that is think about it for more than 60 seconds. 
---
As someone with over 600 hip fire kills on the SG-CQB, shhh. Dont give away the secret!
---
Ooo great advice. I just said it happens at the end of every match, meaning I play a full match with no issues and then can never follow up into another match. No connection issues while playing or any other game. 
---
Thanks for the awesome advice 
---
Literally my friends been using this since I got the game 
---
Even if you don't spot him. You always instantly know there is a vigil. But the thing is, you know he is there, but not exactly where he is. That is why he works 
---
So, being that ubisoft has access to servers and people who are capable(?) of coding. They could theoretically code a video into the menu that they could update on their server and the game client could download and save it each time it is updated and it wouldn't have to have any extra rendering on the part of the engine or the computer other than playing said video.
---
Theoretically.
---
'Salways how that is.
---
Better yet, a campaign considering they have all this story that they showed in the short movie. Smdh missed opportunities 
---
Watch they are gonna change it 
---
What type of people are you playing against grass 4????
---
I really wish I could learn how to headshot through shields
---
True, but does that not make Pengu‚Äôs assessment more credible when compared to the assessment of a casual player?

That's pretty much the existence of this subreddit, everyone wants something, they do it, they want something else, it's like bringing a kid into ToysRUs to get something and as soon as you leave they want a different toy. It's dumb.  
---
(Shout out to my nibbas that remember ToysRUs)
---
I have 695 hours and have almost 400? How is that even possible
---
Sometimes I experience that stuff too. Usually lasts a day, I tend to think it‚Äôs more of my playing funky and this not going my way. Just give it a day and play again. 
---
It's actually not a bandanna, it's a hair net, and Bandit part times at as soup kitchen.
---
I believe most pros go between 26-40 cm /360 for this game. You'll usually see lower cm/360s (higher sensitivity players) depending on the games target speed. But it's all preference - find a balance between reaction speed and consistency with muscle memory. It will take months to dial it in perfectly.
---
I have a FX8350 and GRX 960FTW and I get a constant 144. I have overclocks tho 
---
Not in my opinion
---
But hey, you have yours and I have mine and I respect yours
---
Just wait till next season they are changing it to the regular edition
---
What about reverting him to pre-Y3?
---
Yeah the 1660 Ti seems like the sweet spot right now. An RTX 2060 might be a bit overkill considering I dont remember the last time I played a game other than Siege. 
---
Lesion and jackal
---
\[T]/
---
It used to be longer distance but he was nerfed earlier this year. I agree is should be closer to the old distance. 
---
Hahaha hahaha ahaha it's funny cuz he's from the memes of the lord thing that is repost but still funniest meme hahahahahahah
---
You dont drawn much but you draw good
---
its been "Fixed" In nearly every season since launch... I doubt they can make it stick this time either.
---
‚ÄúWhat can I complain about now‚Äù
---
Simple answer is ubisoft make 100% of the money on uplay. PSN they need to give the 20% discount money already directly to sony for using their service.
---
Thanks!
---
So your Siege benchmark score will show 144+ during the entrance scene? 
---
What does this mean?? I am worried now. I have no knowledge of Y4S1 aside from the changes to ops and new stuff coming. Aside from all that i have no clue about anything tied to the game cost,etc.
---
I don't really prefer one over the other, but I liked the originals because it made the operator feel more unique and individual. I don't see why the color coding is necessary. Knowing Ash and Thermite are FBI by seeing the color of logo at the top doesn't give me any more information than by just knowing their logo. Color coded or not you still need to know the logo.
---
Yeah
---
I‚Äôll look into it, thanks.
---
1. Buy the year 1s, the are 40% off.
---
2. Buy hibana, not fucking cav or frost.
---
3. Buy either buck, blackbeard or valkyrie.
---
4. Then buy echo.
---
5. Then you can buy the shitty ones.
---
Ps. no offebse to the other ops, but cmon bro
---
i actually had footage of it but it didnt save due to me having no disk space.  
---
Because rendering raytraced environments in real time would be laggy as fuck, with each frames taking several minutes or even longer to render. 
---
If they put a video of a pre-rendered ray-traced background it wouldn't be as HD because of the video compression. And mind you, these cg trailers are rendered with much higher quality raytracing than the dumped down stuff u see in games like battlefield v, so rtx cards won't help u either.

This. I didn't think the air force were their social forces unless they pulled a SAs

Cargo shorts have to be past the knees, but not enough to hinder movement. Otherwise 10/10!

You should ADS, as thats what the holograms are doing. Otherwise that was great

You haven't yet the entitled kids who go around using hax and killing their team mates while yelling at them for dying so soon telling them to get good or uninstall their lives.

fornite is made on it's own engine that epic designed would be part of it i'm sure.
---
hmm that may or may not be me blowing your face off.
---
Not sure why everyone is saying data limits would even be an issue or file size, it'd just be stored as a fairly high quality compressed video file, probably a few hundred megabytes or maybe even less depending on how long / complex the clip was. 
---
Are you taking that to PAX East, I'm going there in my tachanka cosplay
---
The attacker looks interesting, I hope the defender never becomes a thing, ever.  
---
Having defenders run up behind you on placed that used to be safe is something I definitely don't want added into the game.
---
VGS CHAT
---
Recruit is bae
---
Huh, that's a level-headed perspective if I've ever read one.
---
I liked to see a Frenchman and a German, or a Korean and Canadian try to communicate verbally effectively.
---
Ubisoft made a statement on MnK. It‚Äôs cheating, but there is no way to detect it.
---
As for DDOSes, I believe it‚Äôs an issue that should bother Sony and Microsoft more than Ubisoft. 
---
The artist is [TraXim](https://www.redbubble.com/people/traxim?ref=artist_title_name)
---
I find Lesion to be 100x more frustrating to play against than Blitz... Just gonna put that out there.
---
That is amazing. Great work.
---
If you had to pick between sprinting and charging the flash, the flash would be practically useless, unless the range on the flash is drastically increased. 
---
Sociopaths and psychopaths are attracted to this game.
---
I think I heard it was March 5th
---
What's the new nerf? 
---
Thanks
---
For me I would take a role like a sniper and cater to how I would want it to work and start with the main function and go from there on external design. Wish we could post pic comments, I would say did some
---
On what platform do you play?
---
ubi can't stop ddosers
---
It's 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 still, not 5000 per CTU.
---
Yeah if you're gonna hide there gotta reinforce it
---
ence doesn't even have a siege team any more, and uuno transferred to lestream months ago
---
It is intended
---
Is there anything I can improve?
---
Are you hacking?
---
How would playing a pre-rendered video as menu background cook your CPU more than the current real-time rendered menu backgrounds?
---
Hide in the northern corner of the room. It had more than enough covef
---
Im pretty sure the actual artist is pisamak on tumblr. Stealing art and claiming its yours isnt cool man.
---
I understand, take the main function and what you want it to be, create it, then create the outer shell and external aesthetics
---
You overestimate the power of my CPU
---
For siege they are awful otherwise I am indifferent towards them
---
When I was a monty main I mainly used him to spot enemies and ping em and occasionally pop off kills

Yes ur right I found this picture on my phone and I remember it was something like 3or4months ago

Howdy! I debuted a Lesion at the Six Invitationals this year! I've got a lot of ideas for your costume, but first off. You freaking nailed the thigh strap setup!

Yep, on the roof of bank

Sensitivity goes down on Xbox too. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs more on PC but it‚Äôs the same mechanic
---
Since we have another week of testing, probably March 11^th
---
Pretty much. Many looked like shit or just didnt turn into much but a few were badass. Like I took inspiration from the AWM and made a semi auto sniper rifle which they ended up making a similar looking one a few years later in Halo Reach
---
Debatable. Someone who isn't a PL player can have a great understanding of game balance.
---
Somebody's been playing apex. Bloodhound?

That‚Äôs not what I wanted to hearüò≠

Because some people find it funny?
---
That glaz is missing a few chromies for that one. 
---
Lol dont let him fool you, its not his art. He stole it.
---
I wouldn't call the 3d models we have now "low quality". They're pretty nice and the one coming in Burnt Horizon has a lot of personality behind it.
---
Obviously no. If you ever tried to play with a full communicating team you can easily understand how much different the game is. Its more strategic, competitive and fun for me (and you gain two grades at least)
---
Also Fabian a few months ago in a podcast said that the game we usually play is very different from what r6 really is. 
---
I usually duo queue so yeah, im kinda frustrated every time there is lack of communication too
---
Not funny but satisfying to me
---
"slight character animation" is still a 2 min loop. There needs to be some variation to movements and people don't want to see the same stretch every 30 seconds. If you want a still image with dust particles than that's a whole other story and would be resource cheaper than the current menu (png with a shader running on it)
---
Why does such topic bother you in the first place? Kill assist involves much more than simply dealing damage. 
---
Thank you!
---
Don't forget to plant without telling them. Also, plant in the wrong place
---
honestly this fixed it me for but that weird me out is that I can spot the other obj in the back but not the in front of me

Well, it seems like you picked the wrong helmet, plate carrier and googles. But if you‚Äôre going for a budget cosplay then it‚Äôs alright.

Please give us an option to have a boring generic menu system. The menu systems with characters are very cringe/awkward for me and I'd like an option to change. Thanks.

Because your average player can‚Äôt abuse something to its fullest like a pro player can. She is super op in a post plant situation which with a group of randoms in a casual setting is super rare. She also provides a ton of intel on roamers, which in a pro setting is shared extremely well. In ranked people just typically use her to either hope no one follows them or jumps out a window on them. 
---
Also this got removed
---
then when you see the shield flank or gtfo before they see you
---
Not notching it on the moment, so its not so irritating as the rain. 
---
Hell, even Lion and Finka were creative.  Outbreak was amazing, Lion's ability, while broken, is cool as fuck, and Finka is pretty cool, too
---
Infinite scans is not as much of a problem imo because usually people in silver or higher don‚Äôt scan
---
If this is an act of renown grind, its an ass one imo, as you get more renown by playing the game and shitting on TH (because goobi cant stop giving those 150 renown quest to t hunt) than just AFKing
---
I do agree on how strong echo can be but from my experience he seems to get his way if you are lurking alone with no teammates and I usually consider bringing a thatcher almost every time if i see they like using echo i like bringing him way more than iQ because i have died plenty of times looking for that damn drone on the roof

Magoota magoota magoota

I did post it a while back you can search for it on my profile

When the removed the seasonal skins data limits were blamed as well iirc.
---
I always think reverse damage for Team-killing offences should be the norm in shooters. Don‚Äôt let people get you down man, at the end of the day it‚Äôs just a game. Worry about yourself and it all falls together for you eventually. Time and gameplay, the educational Siege YouTube video if you need (want) tips. Not all siege players are toxic. Hope this helps in anyway.ü§ù

She will be op on maps with linear roam (Coastline, Border), and even on those she may simply force impact nade operators on roam. I don't think she'll be banned on maps like Villa or Kafe. Her sole role in the team is the roam control, you'll be missing other important operators when you pick her. Other than airjab, which can be taken out with an impact, she has average rifles and a secondary which can no longer be spammed after the recoil nerf. She's pretty good but I don't think she'll be a "must ban" operator. 
---
Ever heart of sarcasm?
