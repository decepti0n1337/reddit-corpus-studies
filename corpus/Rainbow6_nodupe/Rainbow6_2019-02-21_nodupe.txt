Steam is ultimately liable, but from a practical point of view I wonder who is to blame? i.e. Did Steam put that sale picture up or did Ubisoft do it?  Has Valve just failed to activate the sale?

This little quips are what makes siege so close to my heart along with the god tier gameplay.

It's gotten pretty bad. I want to be clear though, there are still people who use a controller in plat and diamond, and it's pretty easy to tell that they are just good. You also have to be aware of people using modded controllers that have paddles. I really want to make it to plat, and I was literally one game away this season, but then came in the MnK players, and they absolutely destroyed us. I have friends who have made it to diamond and plat on PS4 using only a controller, and after watching how they play, it's easy to tell when someone is using MnK. It's an unfair advantage, but life isn't fair. I just constantly try to get better with a controller, and hopefully someday have the ability to surpass any MnK player who decides to just be a douche.

You should try spinning, it's a good trick!

Ok, I understand that, but to me that is a different issue than matching *existing* diamond players that are queued with Copper/Bronze teammates to a Gold/Silver lobby. To me it seems that Ubi should do something about De-Ranking as a problem and something about high tier players queuing with low tier players as 2 separate problems. 
---
yeah and it was tactical realism

Same to you! Happy cake day!

I've had a sneaking suspicion I have some form of ADD/ADHD for a long time now, but I'm of two minds about it. The first says that all the symptoms I ever read for ADHD fit me almost to the letter, and the second says I'm self-diagnosing. It doesn't help that my dad is adamant about me NOT having it.
---
Yea me too. Even tho its reusing an old gun I'm also kinda glad they know that you can put a mag in a SAW rather than coming up with some complete bullshit gun like they did with the V308
---
That would be awesome! I would really appreciate it if you could, whenever you can that is
---
You mean Hugh Jackman?
---
I don't see how that can create a loop. Maybe Thermite and Bandit.
---
My point is I‚Äôve played tones of rainbow games and not once have I felt the urge to go online and demand Lion be nerfed because I was killed by him, instead I flank, dodge, kill or even [gasps] stand still whilst his ability is active (because believe it or not his movement detecting drone is activated when it detects [dramatic music] *movement*). Granted this doesn‚Äôt always work because sometimes he‚Äôs a good shot or I screw up or something and prompts to him if he does get that kill, it was a good play. 
---
You wouldn‚Äôt get pissed and go online because sledge killed you with his hammer or ash with her breach charges and what‚Äôs funny about that is it‚Äôs actually easier to just stand still for like 3 seconds than it is to kill ash or sledge. 
---
ALSO everyone using the recent matches as ‚Äòproof‚Äô that he‚Äôs OP because ‚ÄútHe BeSt PlAyEr In ThE wOrLd WaS kIlLeD bY hIm‚Äù and that ‚ÄúiT wAs ImPoSsIbLe FoR hIm To WiN‚Äù let me ask you this: if it was soooooo impossible for that strat to be beaten then why wasn‚Äôt it used every time? Smoke sight, lion uses his ability whilst monty defends and ____ plants? Simple: because the defenders managed to kill the enemies or block them in some other way from doing that strat. Meaning what we‚Äôve learnt is that not only is it possible for that strat to be beaten but that it gets beaten ALL THE TIME. 
---
6 inch blade???
---
I think the issue is that everyone willing to play on the TS plays on the Outback exclusive casual mode.

Honestly I agree, this game has some bad people, but they are making a tk system so you don't get tk'd as often.
---
1st week of March.

Man how many hours did you put into the game in that time frame? That‚Äôs ridiculous

I really don't care about my rank. I rather just enjoy playing siege playing ranked rather then entering the toxic cesspool that is casual.

When you play too much Red Dead Redemption 2
---
Hi! You are wrong!

His secondaries are between the choices of his Super Shorty shotgun or the SDP 9MM Pistol.  
---
Have a good day!
---
No problem. 2 different opinions here. At the end the Pros and devs decide. 
---
Vigil on the other hand: this bars you see on the screen are actually a negative and a positive thing. You know he is there somewhere, but you don‚Äôt know where he is exactly. He could be in the next room, above or below. Often players don‚Äôt utilize this the right way to give them an advantage 
---
They can say that they did but it doesn‚Äôt seem like it with all the rubber banding my team is doing while having under 20 ping 
---
I‚Äôve been just fine, what server are you?
---
Give up
---
not a gauge of his actual usefulness in a fight tho, in the SSG G2 match pengu got dumpstered while playing blitz
---
I see your argument but if that's not in place then people could abuse the system and just pull their cord disconnecting from the match while fucking over the team and not get any penalty. It sucks but it's a necessary evil. If it happened once it's just an off match/night for you. You'll get them next time champ. If it happens a lot, it's on you to make sure you have a stable enough connection to play. 
---
Imagine how much that hammer would hurt on your spine 
---
i‚Äôve been 1 r6 credit under a skin, you don‚Äôt see me crying out for free money

Thanks anyhow. I'll have to ask her. Considering my wife bought me the standard edition for PC is like to know for when I get my computer hooked back up.
---
Yeeeees!!! Welcome back, my man!

Odd, they never showed either ops using or even having a pistol

Don't let monty get in in the first place.
---
Surprised that it isn't a hamburger
---
I‚Äôd recommend ditching secure area and play bomb.
---
Zofia is upgraded ash but slower
---
This elite skin is by far the second worst (nothing near bad compared to Bandit‚Äôs upcoming elite skin)
---
Did they take anything away from what you bought? No.
---
No hard feelings. I know my squad mate was riling you guys up. Made for an intense game.
---
Haha never noticed until now
---
No he hasn't. We got a sneak peak at a ***potential*** re-work for him, but it is not due out at the start of Y4S1 and no finite changes have been made short of the promises made in the Year 4 notes.
---
They're legitimate mags
---
Best way to get good is to practice brother. What do you play on? Maybe I could help you out.
---
Ember Celica as a unique for an operator? Sure. 
---
Edit: Deleted my comment, was responding to the wrong thread on the wrong tab.
---
false cuzzz my brother bought the yr 4 pass and it linked to my account on the same pc so they took away his yr 4 pass gave it to me he complained to ubi support and he got 1200 credits and a yr 4 pass all for bitching about it but now we both have a yr 4 pass so im sure they have a way of doing it
---
How about you use the search function before making a post.
---
Mouse and keyboard is undetectable on console because it sends it signals through a controller, get used to it, it‚Äôs going to be here for a long time
---
that means Cav is OP if we take the defender stats into account lol
---
Lmao what name is it
---
*flexes arm* Oh man, that's beautiful. 
---
Yeah, but I personally believe mira is actually more trouble to have than shes worth. I mean bar kinda sucks, at least in secure, the other bomb sites are fine and same with secure. My squad seems to always pick penthouse first and we just play entertainment and have 2 or 3 roamers. Or if we can kill any immediate window holds then we are golden. I just think that the way it is designed it's hard for defenders to control bit also for attackers to establish a foothold without maybe getting flanked so that is good. Kitchen is definitely the best defense obj. And yeah one of my squad configs has a mira main but I'd still rather have someone besides her. 
---
What is that charm???
---
Of course not. You received exactly what you paid for. 
---
To be quite honest, I don't think that half the player base even knows what the Waco siege is. But it would be kinda cool if it was
---
Loosely 
---
r/alwaystobeexpectedjojo
---
"Man, fuck Zavala" is what I said everytime he popped up 
---
I mean she‚Äôs arguably the strongest defensive op in the game
---
But I SS this...o.O
---
was that a bABY? ü§îü§îü§î
---
But I‚Äôm not, look at his post history. 
---
Is this official art or fan made?
---
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN
---
The amount of games I played that banned Cav was like 80%+... lazy people who don‚Äôt want to drone 
---
Unless you want to buy an elite skin or event alpha pack (like the invitational packs we just had) I'd say go for it, having all the right operators is key to this game.
---
I think you can still play the old hereford base in situation.
---
march 5th
---
Yeah but why not get him banned? I don‚Äôt see the reason not to mass report him?
---
Now the emus. Shoot them and get to high ground, as none shall survive
---
Vigil would be so OP. He'd have a 100% pick rate in PL if he was on attack with no pick and ban. Imagine vigil being able to rush past Yokai, Black Eye and Valk Cams and the only indicator is white distortion. Vigil fragging would be more common than Ash fragging
---
He was like "why are we still here just to suffer"
---
Oh

Damn, this could totally be me. I always assumed that since I wasn't hyper I couldn't have ADHD, but maybe I should look into it a little more...
---
Buck has some pretty funny lines during outbreak.
---
I agree with you. Unlike hacking on PC, it‚Äôs hard to get someone banned for console mouse and keyboard.
---
I think a lot of PC players don‚Äôt understand that. So mass reporting with proof is the only real way.
---
No, Yin and Yang.
---
But the tide looks blue!
---
I think the Glaz rework is really good. He's no longer an entry fragger, he can use his smokes to move in with his team and lock down an angle. When you take off his scope his gun is still strong and he can move and win gun fights, but he won't be able to see you through smoke and move around which was too op.
---
Nitro, impacts, Smoke &amp; Lesion are your best ways of getting Monty to move if not die outright
---
 If you don't have those... sadly it's just over, if the room has 2 doors you might be able to flank or bait him away from the door.
---
No because Valk‚Äôs cams are stealthy and extremely hard to find in the right spots, assuming you don‚Äôt have an IQ. Mozzie is gonna be good but he won‚Äôt hurt Valk at all in my opinion 
---
Yeah! They both are pretty straight forward and can fit quite a few different play styles. 
---
Iirc it's supposed to be part of his personality where he uses humour as a way to cover up his stress
---
Yes it is. A few of the maps are based on real life events actually. I think Chalet has a cool backstory but I can‚Äôt remember what it is 
---
The gadget sounds pretty useless IMO. You're sacrificing damage for a speed penalty, can't penetrate walls and you only get one mag. Most gun fights are decided within an instant, so the speed penalty is useless, especially since this is an attacker and most of his kills will come from people standing still. 
---
The weapon choices are....eh. It's mostly accurate to what the USMS use, tho I'm not sure they use the AC-556. The Colt 9mm is an awful choice for attack as it just isn't a plain old AR. Also, i know everyone wants a glock, but it's not happening. No Ubisoft game since Vegas 2 has had a glock in the game, and that's probably not changing. It's very likely they got told by glock to stop using the likeness of their guns in the games, and they complied. I mean, the Glock is one of, if not, the most prominent law enforcement pistol, and it's still not in Siege. There is 100% a reason for this.  
---
The joke was that I replaced Yin with Ying, like the operator.
---
Funniest detail is the men kissing on the wall that is a shield pattern for Blitz
---
üòÇ
---
No because when I first ever played siege which was terrorist hunt I really enjoyed it, it needs to be left alone but kids room should be changed.
---
Blue is first, then green, red orange yellow. I think.... probably... Idk I just know that blue is first.
---
How would that be useful? Just shoot the cams lmao. The rare scenario where you‚Äôre being watched by Valk and can‚Äôt find the cam isn‚Äôt enough to make an attacking Vigil viable 
---
Yo bud chill he's shit now you can runs as much as you want when his ability is active well if anyone picks lion of  course. still like his gun atleast they didn't do anything to that. 
---
I read the entirety of both articles. Yes I do know what Google is, and it provides the definition of racism quite well.
---
The Irish Times article doesn't provide a counter argument to my point or give the original definition of racism, so it's completely irrelevant.
---
The Huffington post article doesn't provide a counter argument to my point either. It also doesn't show sources for the original definition of racism, so it is also mostly irrelevant.
---
You haven't provided a source for the original definition of racism.
---
Even if the original definition of racism is what you say it is it still doesn't matter. The original definition of awful meant the same thing as awesome, but it means the exact opposite now. It doesn't matter what the original definition of a word is, what a word means depends¬†not on its origin, but on how speakers of a language understand it.¬†The modern definition and meaning of racism is "prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior" so that is what the word means.
---
You can be racist to anybody no matter their race. The argument that you can't be racist to white people is a way to make prejudice against white people sound not so bad. *You can't be racist to white people, only prejudice* is an obvious way to make hateful opinions seem less bad. 
---
Oh my god
---
Tbh, I think tachanka is better (dont mind my flair) because he is on defense. If you sit still on defense and hold 1 or 2 solid angles, you have more use than an op like glaz that can be constantly flanked because he is forced the stay still. I never thought I could say that tachanka wasn't the worst russian operator...
---
No, you're thinking of Scout the Dog.
---
Thanks man, you've got the first two right, I know that. Once I jump into a match with my meme squad again I'll let you know.
---
Now you‚Äôll know why they call me Revolver Ocelot
---
Whaaat!?!people crouch spam in game all the time this is good practice for what youll see in ranked

Do you just like him because he's fun? If so what makes him fun? 
---
Agreed!

Brother, you're alive!
---
Now I imagine Mozzie taking the drone and starts saying to the attacker operating it: Hello there!Mind if I borrow your drone? I could really use one right now, especially that Twitch drone.
---
A different defender then says: Stop joking around Mozzie!
---
Mozzie: Aaaah... okay then *puts pest on the drone*
---
I know man... I'm just ecstatic with how much they nerfed him. Like, he's dead, he's fucking dead. Come Y4S2. I won't need to deal with this dumbshit operator anymore. 
---
This ain‚Äôt it chief. Nomad is crazy good. They already took away her stuns because she was too good. The claymore is pretty redundant but it never hurts to have breaching capability 
---
Didn't realize it was a joke as a lot of people believe that it's actually Ying and Yang non Yin and Yang
---
I never want it in Siege, but a battle royal with Siege‚Äôs guns and gun play could be sick. 
---
lol they couldn't get long hair on the ingame model so the redo the artwork...
---
All the Siege operators are codenames just like 007. The real Hibana died when the ghost from The Ring took her soul after her phone rang as she ran past a tv in Fortress. You know the well with the screaming ghoul there, that's Hibana 1.0.
---
Similar things had happened to Twitch, Rook, Ash, Jaeger who had face changes. Their respective CTUs just assigned their codenames to new operators to act like business as usual. 
---
when do they come out for everyone? I have the season pass.
---
I‚Äôve seen some say her gadget is ridiculous and I‚Äôve seen others say it‚Äôs garbage tier. I‚Äôm on console so I can‚Äôt play her but it‚Äôs driving me crazy seeing so many people putting her on completely opposite sides of the spectrum 
---
that's your interpretation. They're not really worth it for duty or even competition, which makes it irrelevant.
---
This reminds me of cayde6üò¢

I just looked it up and you're right. That's odd that they're just now decreasing the prices. I'll definitely wait to buy until then.

&gt; Okay the suffix ism means a system is in place so that means racism is just a system based on race.
---
They are 2 different terms though, that's not what you're understanding.
---
&gt; Who made this system white people and who benefited from this system? white people.
---
PEOPLE DID!! This is what you SJWs don't get. Europeans were more advanced so they had the ability to do what they did. Same with how the Arabs enslaved millions of blacks (even more than the Europeans did) and even castrated the men. But British treated the Irish, who are also white, like crap. Blacks captured and sold other blacks to Europeans for christ sake! The Europeans barely went further than the coast of Africa until around the time slavery was already being abolished in Britain!
---
&gt; I know what I am thinking and saying. 
---
No, you literally don't. You live in a bubble, never to have your ideas challenged.
---
&gt; Even now they still have problems with the systematic racism that was put there by real racists. 
---
They're brutally massacring quite a lot of white people, many of whom have had their families there for 200-400 years but you still gotta blame whitey.
---
1. Way different look
---
2. Old hibana will make your skin a wallpaper
---
I think it‚Äôs because they want all operators to be owned and they realized that for some people 25,000 is high. 
---
I literally do that every time on that site
---
Nah they have the same body type and facial structure.

She's friends with thermite she really don't even look that emo in my opinion.

This is the new, popular racism now. "I'm looking out for the other". Face any criticism? "Why are you so hateful! Bigot! Racist! Oppression is everywhere!"
---
It definitely is for me. I've probably only gotten a total of about 50k renown; I only was able to get all the year 1s by buying the deluxe edition when it was on sale for $12.
---
Wait till after year 4.m starts. Zofia is very good as well as lesion(both mentioned) but really it all depends on your play style. 
---
I have the gold edition. But it makes no difference since I got it when the game launched so all I got is the gold and Christmas wrapping paper skins for guns.

Wow, from the building came about the best game I‚Äôve ever played! 
---
Toxic kids you accidentally tkd would probably punish you anyway 
---
Have you even looked at Mira, and Alibi? Yes they fucking are.

Wait you think pro league is a representation of of MOST pc players, I‚Äôm sorry to tell ya but MOST pc players are silver and can barely hit the back side of a barn

Fitting reinforcements and other gadgets in your pockets is not a design choice, jackass. Attempt critical thought before you type more nonsense.

No advantage of a firing range over Thunt
---
You still have no good points and because of this you are calling me a closeted racist to cover your ass. 
---
I'm not being close minded, you are just wrong in my view, and I'm attempting to prove you wrong.
---
I don't feel that I am better than you, but I do think that you are wrong so I am proving you wrong through a debate.
---
People like me are why things haven't improved. You mean people who debate and wish for evidence when a claim is made?
---
The meaning of liberal is not that you want things fair, but I actually do want things to be fair. 
---
I dismissed the poor arguments and lack of evidence that you had, unfortunately that was your entire argument.
---
I didn't harass you, I gave my responses to your comments.
---
I'm sorry that I ruined your day. It was wrong of me to instantly call you racist, and I apologize for that. I hope you have a better day tomorrow.

They BUTCHERED her to start with. This is a substantial improvement

Happy cake day!!

I'd call it tryharding if he rushed with both his bolts, droned, and then aced.
---
Here, he just bum rushed, mindlessly.
---
I still think they should instakill from anywhere, because why would you equip them, and take the time to line up an already really difficult shot when you can just shoot them? Honestly I don‚Äôt think throwing knifes belong in Siege and idk what you could even do to convince people to use them.
---
Did you just counter someone's argument by dealing a death blow to your own? Lol
---
It's correct for this particular MP5 model but it looks ugly with nearly all of the skins.
---
Awesome. Ubi has been doing a really good job lately.
---
try its in the same spirit as anthem but different power fantasy. its F2P play so the barrier for enter is low. if you somehow feel stuck just ask the chat in the game plenty of friendly people who'll help you out, just don't beg.
---
and have a wiki page open cause you'll have to do bit of reading get most of  the stuff needed
---
Alibi's main ability seems pretty cool. I, admittedly, usually fall for the decoys; but how good are her weapon choices? Are they able to compete with the likes of Fuze and Ash's weapons?
---
In the Test Server, it lowers the amount of health that you get when being down from 50hp to 20hp.
---
it wasnt mindlessly rushes hes a pretry good success rate if theres no comms
---
If you get downed and get revived it's 20hp now, not 50.
---
Fair point. 
---
Is there something I‚Äôm missing here?
---
Is your GPU overclocked?
---
Haha sadly :( 
---
Thanks a lot.
---
What am I missing? 
---
for pushing site? 
---
While he‚Äôs fuzing he‚Äôs

i sad

Ok, I would recommend someone like maestro or maybe frost for defense and for offense probably nomad if you don‚Äôt already have her due to being able to use airjabs 
---
bruh theres one person left

get lost

*their* game

They could have been more aware of what was going on

Why would it not be?

She actually looks Japanese so I feel like this is a welcome change.

rook absolutely does not need a buff. he just got nerfed 
---
*sigh*

Did that Tachanka glitch ever get patched? Where you could turn 3 armor 1 speeds into 3 armor 3 speeds? Cause I had a good time doing that as Mira with friends in custom games

no, it‚Äôs a GTX 1080 ti and processor is i7 9700k

Well duh, rainbow 6 is a competitive FPS that is only a few years old. Pok√©mon is decades old and is super popular among children and adults who still enjoy it.

I like Glaz's icon. Can we buy these as charms? Never noticed them.

The only advice I can give you is never solo queue, having just one friend with you removes your other teammates ability to vote kick you.

At this point people think if you have too much free time on your hands

Hey buddy, i am a go a big 10-4 nope on this

What am I looking at?

Mozzie is the guy and gridlock is the girl. I think you got the names wrong in that convo
---
These post make me want UBI to release realistic uniforms in a tactical skin set. 
---
Naw man he needs a deployable shield
---
Year 4 is the Year of the changes.
---
Dont buy the pass because its not worth prebuying ops you may not even use.
---
Lying about lack of change just proves you didnt watch the Invitational and are uninformed.
---
yeah sadly in my case Im roughly a high bronze player so its literally impossible for me not to drop to copper every single season and just getting lumped in with the absolute most toxic mess of players. I dont expect it to change honestly as its been 3 years.
---
he needs attacker gear you dumb fuck he's not a defender are you on drugs?

What system do you play on?

Th√© fact that you‚Äôre a blitz main infuriates everyone

Tbh I was expecting a sledge fall down onto the drone and sledge it.....
---
This DBNO change is a Doc buff
---
I'll just share how I did this because I feel like it was a bit easier than this strategy:
---
* Protect Hostage
---
* House
---
* Master Bedroom
---
* Lord Tachanka
---
Setup your turret behind the overturned bed -try to position yourself so the window and double-door are behind it *(this is where you'll be getting your penetration kills portion on this grind)*. Bring barbed wire and litter it under the window, in the double doorway, shower doorway, closet doorway, and anywhere they've breached a hard wall. Save your reinforcements to plug the holes for when they do breach the soft walls *(you can sometimes sneak in wall bangs if you can hear them using a breaching charge)*. As for the penetration kills, they tend to hop-in from the window and funnel-in through the double-door or closet *(if they've breached that wall)*, so just use the audio cues from the barbed wire and top of the frame to know where to aim *(if you see/hear the window barricade being broken/is down, then that's where they are)*. It's a bit of guesstimation because you're blind firing for most of it, but I found this a lot easier than hunting down kills...just let them come to you.
---
**Note:**
---
You don't HAVE to use Tachanka, but I found his turret went through the AI rather easily when going for the blind firing penetration kills *(and this was before the half-shield was patched in)*. Realistically, you can use any Defender that has barbed wire because that's the key to slowing them down for easy pickings -so Bandit, or now, Kaid are great options if you want to prevent hard breaches on select walls and littering wire everywhere, following the same basic principle above. Yeah, this is what worked for me. I just found letting them funnel-in through known locations, with minimal walls to flank me worked the best for grinding all those T-hunt kills. As a bonus, you'll likely also net the Camper achievement *(complete 100 Defend T-hunts)* while grinding all those kills. 
---
I like the aspect of not being spawnpeeked by mad skill doc though
---
Happy birthday! üéÇ 
---
Nice
---
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of cross platform? 
---
how big is that... block wise
---
There are people who play on console with Xims. 
---
Lmao
---
Until his damage lower than ~110 ttk will not change. Look at Caveira, so much rant about damage nerf from 99 to 65, but this change do mostly nothing with her TTK at close. Even 125 damage back then still requires 2 shot in middle-long ranges, thanks to damage drop-off. But this high damage is just frustrating to play against. One hit and you at 5-10 hp, walking dead man.
---
Glaz still can snipe even with current or smaller damage, because he still can spot enemy without problem, and deal some damage or kill. If you give thermal sight to every DMR in game, they would become long-range sniper rifles, but still with nice CQB stats.
---
i should say, how many blocks is a single pixel
---
Their numbers... are overwhelming!

You went recruits. You don't get to be salty about loosing.

probably cuz its kinda silly to think ubi would make these holes. IDK

Rappel along its outside

I think it is on the website. Try again in an hour or something. Don't worry you'll get your account back
---
Quirky moment
---
Wats ur tean rank tho
---
It‚Äôs actually something they‚Äôre implementing soon, friendly fire is core in the game but it will be punished coming soon. (Will edit with link when I find it.)
---
Pro tip. Don't play that Jager who gets killed in the first five seconds of every round. Turns out a 4v5 against G2 is not fun.
---
When in the screen when it shows teams inv (invite) them
---
I knew one of those comments would come out. These are the, "Just stand still" kind of comments. 
---
No. Memes go on the other sub. Let's try and keep this one vaguely decent. 
---
You go into the custom game, then you go to where you see your siege party and would switch profile and stuff, then there‚Äôs an option to add members 
---
Their adding where if someone teamkills, if that same person puts any damage to another team mate that whole match, they will get reflected damage and the team mate will experience no damage
---
I am a bit torn on it. On one hand, it looks too out of place in Siege. On the other, Hibana is my main and white X-Kairos look so dope.
---
No because you just have to be smart with your drone, keep an eye on the timer 
---
I love him, but probably won't play him much. just really prefer trap ops, and when I'm not playing one of them I'm playing Mute or Castle. Although I think if you paired him with a mute you could almost completely wipe out the attackers' drone advantage. I'm thinking try to kill as many drones as you can during prep to get the attackers' drones down to 5 total, then set up his gadget as traps to try and get another 2 (or 3? Can't remember how many charges of his gadget he has). If you do it well you'd seriously screw over the attackers' intel ability.
---
Since I'm new, why would that be a core function in the game, wouldn't that ruin it? 
---
How would you nerf blitz without reducing him to the point of being useless? Take away his ability to ADS? Increase the time it takes to ADS? Take away his ability to lean? Take away his gun entirely?
---
You should check out year 4 roadmap panel so you would know something whats coming
---
The problem isn't the FF, that should be in the game, the problem is that it's not punished well enough
---
I've got a chevrolet movie thea-tor
---
I think removing friendly fire is against the spirit of the game but i do agree we need something against teamkilling. People in this subreddit have talked about a forgive or punish system when u get teamkilled which sounds ideal to me
---
Well in a game that's supposed to be semi-realistic, I think its good. Yeah the people who abuse it suck, but the idea is that as a tactical realism game, anything and everything can kill you. You're supposed to keep track of where your team is. Also the only way to get a reset is to have friendly fire. If there was no friendly fire, they'd have to change a bunch of the game codes, mechanics, and metas just to remove it.
---
She's a big woman yes, but she can snap the terrorists in two with her bare arms
---
But I think it's a political thing or just immature people who can fathom the fact people can look in different ways in a game because it's diversity (as in makes the game less boring instead of 100 characters who look the same) 
---
They‚Äôre going for more of a tactical semi-realism, you can‚Äôt stand in front of someone while someone is shooting someone else in real life, and they want it similar in game.
---
Thank god

I woke up on a weekend. sometimes I take about 3 hours to brush my teeth on weekends after I wake up because i will be reading a book or finishing up a tv show. then I will brush teeth and complete the necessary self care before heading out to see big picture on screen in dark room. I go in car. on the way there iil throw on some tunes, I have a "ride and not die" Spotify playlist for my car rides. before I park I will make extra sure to not bump into any cars, taking the average parking process a bit lengthier than usual. go in theater for sit down watchytimes and ppl leave and go extra long marathon. movies eh. flash flash bang bang steel man, blue red white man, green man, black woman, hammer man. see all. then people get angry no infinity war. start bathroom exodus, intermittent leaving of course. coma back no glove man yet, so put leftover rectum chocolate on bucket. go go power rangers. staff comes in escorts the people out. glove man go. raccoon sad, snap. leave. go home. play "ride and not die playlist for after visiting place with fecal matter smell" on car ride home. like to relax with food. eat food. maybe go exercise or just cut down trees. I murder deer and bath in their guts, very erotic. doubt anyone is still reading. yeah that's the story. those are the tremendous details.
---
Well I remember posting this like 6 months ago but it got deleted for some reason. New mods?
---
well you gets the best mvp animation so you‚Äôre good for now 
---
I love Mozzie
---
Because Siege is trying to keep the little realism aspects it still has left. One of them is you not shooting through all your teammates.
---
Also Fuze
---
you're not alone!
---
Or each of his buddies take 1 turn each. 
---
Yes but then again, cams hacked by dokk can still be used by defenders, whereas the hacked drone can‚Äôt. 
---
oh lol mb, idk man. find a sens that's good &amp; rely on reaction time, that's what i do
---
‚ÄúProfessional Skills‚Äù
---
Yes, I did 
---
This would be useful for spawn team kills. From my experience with this system most people are more than fair with it and forgive when it‚Äôs genuinely an accident. 
---
Bandit tricking isn't really an exploit, it's just a technique used with the gadget. If you consider bandit tricking an exploit you could say the same thing about people who play pulse and c4 the ground from below to get kills. 
---
Haha, I don't even play jager so i don't see that being a problem. Maybe ill be the lesion that dies in the first 5 seconds instead!
---
Is there any way I could reference them again?
---
The problem is the FF that occurs within the first 20 seconds of the game. Once the team actually gets close to the objective it‚Äôs hardly an issue. 
---
a 10v10 mode would be a pretty funny/hectic arcade mode. Maybe with bigger objectives as well because so many players.

Slap a holo on that AR and get used to the recoil and Buck turns into a monster in close range. Not to mention the fact he has a shotgun strapped to the bottom of his gun which is surprisingly deadly if you're close enough. His DMR is alright but I feel like if you're trying to peak and snipe with Buck you'd be better off stitching to an op that's better suited to that style, as you lose most of his utility of environmental destruction from positions like that. 
---
sledge is about to absolutely fuck lion
---
Okay, right? I'm so confused why this isn't a bigger issue. It's literally a game breaking bug when you cannot communicate with your team. 
---
Yeh nah I‚Äôll hack this drone ye cunt
---
Shields are broken and frustrating for the majority of players. Take them out of the game.
---
Correction: It was Match Point 2-1 for our team my bad. Just watch as everyone slowly leaves after it turns to a 1v3 
---
https://youtu.be/hu-9m5dr47c
---
mods/modes. im talkin, knife only, or everyone can choose same op,  capture the flag(knife only) with autorespawn, drone olympics and more
---
Sometimes when I close my eyes to go to sleep at night I just see the animation for reinforcing walls, over and over again. 
---
Ok from behind and console. I dont understand wheres the destruction
---
Nver heard that someone asked...
---
Ive always been curious how a 10v10 game would play.
---
Y s.a.s pink
---
Yes
---
I'm glad Y4S1 will have a prototype behaivor thing
---
it looks like a Crayola crayon in a tube  
---
You also have R6 amino if you are interesed
---
Straight outta China
---
I dont think anybody knows what the mobility value on the weapons means...my guess is ads time, the lower, the slower
---
Exactly. Not sure what OP thinks he‚Äôs doing.
---
Rook sounds american/canadian too
---
"uselles" 
---
Do you know what the nerf will be? 
---
Recruit with sights would be too powerful
---
What's r6 amino?
---
Here we can see why balancing the game around pro league is stupid.
---
What's R6 amino?
---
If they did a game like this or added these skins to darkest dungeon that would be great.
---
Easy fix would be: soft capped mmr limit of (let's say) 1000 points
---
Groupe of 5 friends want to play, 4 of them are plat and fifth is just a silver
---
System then looks at the people's mmr, see that there is 4 people with in 1000 mmr cap and 1 outside it
---
System then calculates the avarege mmr of those 4 plats and treats the silver as this mmr, then calculates the new average of these 5 (4 real mmr's and 1 adjusted) 
---
Not the perfect solution but would definitely fix the copper smurfs with plats/diamonds in ranked and would still allow friends to play together
---
I see, you are a man of australium as well
---
Everyone loves mozzie, besides the rest of team rainbow
---
KawaiiEars
---
I tend to pre-aim about where their head would be if they're crouch walking because I find the transition up is much easier when coupled with recoil, as opposed to trying to aim down from standing head level. I also feel like this gives me a better view. If I'm aiming high and they walk in low there's that much less of them for me to see, but if I'm aiming low to begin with I'll catch them regardless. 
---
Team Rainbow truly has the utility for any situation, be it anti-terrorism or just plain mundane tasks like photography.
---
It would definitely make twitch more powerful as a hard counter to mozzie.
---
But atm twitchs utility is lacking I feel like it would make her gadget more viable.
---
But atm mozzie has 3 spiders so that‚Äôs like 3 doorways. Means attackers will have to get to the door to thatcher or shoot through the floor with IQ. So mozzie and Mira compliment each other as he protects her black mirrors if he puts them all around her black mirror.
---
I do see your point though I don‚Äôt think it would make her OP in any way though
---
Doesn't make any sense. 
---
When you flash it shows a tiny spot on your head. Looks like blitz lowered it barely for the flush. Just watch it 1 to 2 I believe in here. Where it happens. Do anyone else see this.
---
But your team doesn‚Äôt, unless you are talking with them, when you aren‚Äôt always in a 5 man
---
which part?
---
Do you know Namsan Tower?
---
That backround sound tho
---
This is the dumbest thing I've skimmed over in weeks.
---
More like buff
---
Looks like a dumbbell
---
Dat edge-weighted spread, amirite
---
Her utility is weak overall yes her f2 balances her out. Just a neat idea I think it will make for a interesting game of cat and mouse and it wouldn‚Äôt be too powerful as you can just shoot the twitch drone before it sniffs out the spiders.
---
I agree she‚Äôs a balanced overall tho 
---
&gt;But atm twitchs utility is lacking I feel like it would make her gadget more viable.
---
I would disagree with this as well while Thatcher can mostly do the same job in a quicker and safer manner his gadget is limited by range where Twitch's isn't and some an EMP won't destroy but Twitch can.
---
Also putting that point aside I'd argue that because Twitch still has one of the best guns in the game that she'd be pretty powerful so long as her gadget remained viable to some degree.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt think it would make her OP in any way though
---
It's not to say I think this would make Twitch herself OP but the idea is to powerful a counter to Mozzie. At least with how I see you idea working out would allow a Twitch drone to purposefully charge through areas to intentionally get and counter Mozzie's drones.
---
Only if it cost all 5 charges would it be balanced IMO. 
---
At 1 it would be no different then shooting it but without even having to look for it or aim for it, at 2 it costs more and you can't get all three in this manner but you can potentially get two then shoot the third, at 3 you can only get one but you can still shoot twice, at 4 you can still shoot once more.
---
Well im german and most people think im scottish trying to hide my accent, tho i know how scottish sounds and i do absolutely not sound scottish at all...fookin lasersights
---
All of it. Leave the game as it is. No need for BR in any shape or form.
---
The footprint/shoe print changes depending on the operator [Here is a image ](https://i.imgur.com/zlfeaQY.png)
---
This is so wholesome. We need more "happier" operators and not so much emo ones. This menu alone gives the operators much more life and character than the others. \*cough clash\*
---
Yeah no problem. xD
---
Not sorted by release date? REEEEEEEEEEEEE

Is there any way I can download one of these and use it as a wallpaper?

or its a modifier on sprint speed on topo of the armor one idk

While I understand what you mean, it's very wrong to say you grow out of it. You develop ways to counteract it, methods to cope with it, but you can never grow out of it, you'll always struggle with it.
---
But some people do report developing good enough coping mechanisms to not need further therapy or medication, without much issue. I'm glad to hear you've found improvement ^ ^
---
It's just representing the realistic Siege experience. J√§ger has no idea what he's doing and Rook is a toxic TKer while Pulse is just away and nowhere near where he's needed.
---
It's not realistic? I thought it was. Rainbow doesn't hire people based on their fitness, but based on their experience, and ability to handle situations and also their gadgets. She looks like a woman who lifts a lot of heavy stuff and like to eat a lot too I don't see a problem with this
---
He/she wasn't being sarcastic though lol.  Just said it was a weird complaint.  
---
I don't know what to even say anymore 
---
This is pure gold
---
Now I do :D been there after all
---
So I feel the way you would counter the twitch drone is if you ever play twitch you know her drone don‚Äôt survive long in site lol.
---
Ask mute could stop the twitch drones from charging in as well. 
---
You do realize this is the R6 sub right?  Was founded on top of a salt mine
---
Yeah that's a problem too. There are far more boys being diagnosed than girls, but there shouldn't be much difference, so it's clear that some boys are diagnosed with it just because they're being normal hyperactive kids. It's a shame
---
Why you keep asking this questions? Look at the enemy Team look at ALL their ranks not only one or two of them. Search this reddit for Infos and also check how matchmaking works, you can find it here you can find on google you can find on Ubisoft HP. That is the 10th post in the last 20 mins about this issue and I think the 100 this week...
---
They have bronze player... Matchmaking is based on the avarage team. So one unranked and a bronze...
---
So you get banned for 24h if you get no kill. Have you think that sometimes you get good teammates who spawnpeek and get like 2 kills (toxic lol) or in general they get good frags and you see none or your kill will be stolen. 
---
Cayde?
---
Comment on number 3.
---
I would also like it, if instead of operators you could create your own personal character and equip it with CTU/opertor kits. Same game, more personal chars. But its an idea that would have to be done from release, now its too late for that
---
His traps deal 4 dmg per second instead of 8
---
Never had so munch money

whenever i see cameras in the mall i instinctively want to shoot them

Siege becomin childish with this. Unpopular opinion but i don‚Äôt like that pistol animation.

I just notice bandit has [this](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XTignWZ-dpY/V6DrxoW9CwI/AAAAAAAAALw/yQzuBcZlkpMQpnQDPQRKUaw_y0vNtx6kwCLcB/s320/Bundespolizei-Logos.svg.png) tattoed on his head in this picture 
---
You forgot:
---
* attacker that place "false sound" devices
---
* traps that ping attackers (like kapkan's but nonlethal)
---
* anti-grenade nets
---
* attacker that freeze reinforcement walls (walls become soft for a some time)
---
* vigil on attack

Who the f EVER asked for a Blitz buff???

it would be cool if she could throw her charges like this to create view-holes

If you just gave it to transfer it would already be great

Mozzie Van Der Linde.

&gt; Then I swapped O with R3. That way I could crouch, aim and move all at the same time but at the cost that leaning right I had to push O which wasn‚Äôt much of a concern since I needed to change my stance more readily.
---
I did the same but didn't think about the lean!  I don't use lean to much at the moment to be fair.
---
Sounds like ash to me. Why isn‚Äôt ash banned nearly as much as blitz?
---
Blitz was one of the most banned attackers
---
Diamond skin demands much from us.
---
12th of march, probably.
---
Any proof of this? 
---
And its not like he was the most banned operator in the S.I playlist for no reason. Plus the devs even said they recognise the problems that shields are and are working on changes for them. 
---
Honestly its a shame to see so many people need to play these crutch operators to do anything, operators that just fundamentally do not belong in a competitive FPS. 
---
Yeah i got one of these as well the hype was real for that opening!!

The only solution is to drink more tea mate - it worked for me.

Yeah but you dont need to do that when you can just easily get a glock or rifle through far easier channels.

Again, more guns leave the US to the cartels than the cartels bringing into the US. I think you are under appreciating just how many guns there are in the US.

Holy hell imagine playing 13 rounds and getting a grand total of 1 kill.. That must of been a frustrating game for those lads.

Now he is no risk very little reward

Terrible suggestion, that would be broken

Get tested, if you're able. There is literally zero harm in checking to be sure.
---
Here's the thing; having a mental illness isn't an excuse, it's an explanation. It tells you WHY you have these problems that you do, not that you're totally exempt from dealing with them.
---
But this is a good thing, because now that you know the cause, you CAN address and deal with them, with known ways of coping/improving. Otherwise you're just bumbling around in the dark, hoping something you try works.
---
I'm 26, and that was essentially what I did until about three years ago. Dropped out of college because I literally could not concentrate no matter how hard I tried, no matter what methods I used, couldn't even sit down to read work without getting distracted by something else. I spent sleepless nights genuinely trying hard to work and finding myself unable, and wondering if I was just worthless and didn't care enough.
---
Then, I looked into what I was experiencing. Everything seem to hit the beats, I got checked, and lo and behold, I had it, severely. I started changing my habits to account for it, and while I still haven't finished college, I DO have a stable job that I don't hate, and overall, I feel so much less incapable of basic function, and am able to live on my own with my partner.
---
That doctor's appointment was the turning point of my life. It was worth it, even if I wasn't really sure before I went. Sorry for the tangent I went on, but if these words can help someone who is going through what I did, then it's worth it to me.
---
Why make this post? We know elites we will be coming anyway just not the order, if you don't have anything to show, why even make this click bait post.

Show us when you are "allowed to" as you claim.

If you don't realise pistols are guns you're a dumb cunt

Yeah so did I, my mates in the party chat way over hyped it
---
I made the same purchase earlier this season. I had too much renown and it was the only logical choice.

The ITA12s is a special case since it only has 4 pellets instead of 8. Dont use it for killing. Ever.

for caveira game sense does help a lot. You want the player to come to you ideally so you can get the drop on them. A lot of that just comes from getting the hours in. Playing shields isn't cheesing I would say. If you wanna stay alive then keep playing shield operators nothing wrong with it.

Well, to be fair, if we had realistic shotguns in the game, they would be OP.

Want to know a game that tried implementing real shotguns? Insurgency Sandstorm.

He‚Äôs the most banned because people aren‚Äôt adapted to playing against him like they are say with Monty because he‚Äôs easier to learn how to play with so more play with him compared to with Blitz thus why you‚Äôd see twice as many Monty players than Blitz players in Y1 + Y2 so when there is a good Blitz which is a rarity people aren‚Äôt used to the different play style compared to how others play Blitz

Unless you told me it was Australian SASR troops i would never have been able to figure it out. Depending on the terrain most militaries look very similar, which at that point you would just have an attacking team running around in mostly the same outfit. This way we get some destinctions between the countries and ops.   
---
Sorry mate, it's a game. Same way we dont see huge sound wave blasting drones able to scan an entire building in real life ;)

i don't understand why people find this better. he looks like such a loser.

Lol were you in this sub before that buff? Daily threads of BUFF BLITZ BUFF BLITZ on the frontpage
---
They should remove the jamming feature to stop blitz flashes cus it doesnt make any sense...
---
Because of Fps or have I missed something, it‚Äôs their choice to go on it so as long it‚Äôs not a disadvantage to actual pc players surely it would be ok
---
Also I‚Äôd rather have nice graphics and 60 FPS on my Xbox than ugly graphics and 20 
---
First there is no gun show loop hole. Second, if these things are such a problem why are crimes not committed with legally owned guns. You want to hurt gun owners who do it legally, when the issue is illegally owned fire arms. How many of these shootings come from people who legally own their firearms. Not many. Stop hurting the law abiding gun owners. If we can guns, they will still be brought into the US and criminals will still have access to them.

I dislike the excessive spread in general, but yes, the spread should just be the same but with normal hipfire inaccuracy.

You hit the wooden frame if you look closely on the first bullet. every other went above him due to recoil control. Except in the very last spray before you died, you hit like one or 2 bullets in his upper chest.

Of course you are. It would make the game ultimately easier for you. And you'd be ranked higher than your skill level actually is, all because you're just good on one map, playing it over and over again.
---
No it Doesn't.
---
The shotgun revolver (Bailiff) is the one with 4 pellets.
---
The ITA 12S actually has the highest point blank damage of all the shotguns (580) but it also has by far the most spread and damage drop off, making it almost useless in practice. 
---
Who is acc so sad they care about downvotes tho
---
Idk why but I have a fear of the terrorists in this game (especially the bombers) and it always makes me play like crap because I just run away from them lol. You on the other hand are so good nice job

There are like two communities on there and rarely do people post on them, idk I hoped there would be something better

Than u User her false most of the time she is only used for the mirar but she can clear so many traps and cams that she is theoretical pretty good utilizing the team. And now she is way to easy when killing a mirror so it's balanced.

And let's be real I played mozzie a few times I mostly try to get as many drones as possible so eventually you don't have to think about getting caught 
---
Ah for once Blitz is a positivity üòÇ 
---
thats the point. gotta be versatile :)
---
Then ya you just need the test server
---
Yeah and since, in my opinion, either looks fine, I'm okay with them going for the option that is much easier on everyone's FPS. R6 has never had a hairstyle like that before, and it would either look stiff plastic or take some actually modern flowing simulation. The bald option is the "cop out" decision, which is necessary sometimes to keep the game accessible to those of us with less powerful computers.
---
Amazing setup my friend. Personally the cord (I assume for the headset) trailing off to the left makes my heart cringe a tiny bit, but I think that's just bc I have cats and know they'd end up pulling down the entire setup by attacking that :P 
---
Thanks for sharing!

Indirectly it was to clean the code up to make fixing bugs easier.

*Wooo* It's your **1st Cakeday** TheStokeyBumPokey! ^(hug)
---
That's good to know, does it download the whole r6 files plus the tts updates or what.l?
---
Drop blackbeard for Ying, thats rage
---
It appears R6S is set after TF2?
---
I wonder if the gadgets are powered by Australium? Or maybe souls? Or even just plain old electricity? Maybe they're hammer editor bugs?
---
Oh, this rabbit hole goes deep.
---
Since the game is related to TF2, and is proven to be in the same universe, one could infer that some of the ops are related to some of the TF2 characters, otherwise, what'd be the point of crossing over with TF2?
---
The question is: Who's whose daddy?
---
Thanks, I'll be buying a new wireless headset soon just not sure what one to go with. Cats are sick
---
No I ended up falling through the map lol
---
I think it downloads everything, it took the same time to download as the actual game for me so probably
---
Everyone would play on House! Also implement it into Casual only and you have to queue at least say 3 maps

LOVE IT 
---
Give me a hug :3
---
Yes they do (but only at like 20m)
---
As for their effective range, it's really short, because unlike in most other games they need to compete with automatic weapons that can kill in one shot at any range while also having a ttk so fast that unless you kill them in 1-2 shots you will be out-ttk'd by even many weaker automatics. 
---
The reason her ability is mediocre at best is attackers kill her drone before she can get a good amount of utility most of the time.
---
She is good for getting that black mirror and that amazing weapon.
---
But Mozzie will be used to keep black mirrors safe. It will be a new thing I guarantee that. Especially in competitive play.

Good game

At least spell "croissant" right, right?

No that's 200+ IQ and she is using 3000000% of her brain
---
I have to ask, what‚Äôs with everyone‚Äôs new found hatred for blitz?
---
Right so let‚Äôs start off the devs have only agreed with the Blitz being ‚Äòannoying‚Äô shit cus it‚Äôs a mass of people saying, they are gonna agree with the majority rather than the minority, Monty being the 3rd most banned in PL is no surprise, obviously due to the fact PL teams are well coordinated and Monty is a heavy support op, gathers intel etc so obviously he will get banned yet you don‚Äôt see people screaming ‚ÄòMonty op‚Äô right? 
---
Again Blitz being banned in S.I. Is cus again people are not adapted against playing against Blitz, I remember when #BuffBlitz was the buzz cus barely anyone could play him, but with the buffs comes higher picks rates comes realisation of what Blitz can do in the right hands so then people realise he can be decent but alas your knowledge on an op will be slim if you barely see them get played properly so the new bandwagon was ban Blitz cus he is part of the toxic meta *Lion Jackal Dokkaebi Ying Blitz*. Obviously Lion was the main problem but people knew if you stand still cus of the Lion scan... you can‚Äôt run away from the Blitz or Ying and then it circles back to little knowledge dealing with a Blitz 
---
Also Ash‚Äôs nerf is reasonable, 99% pick rate of the R4c over the G36C with the R4c being one of the most powerful rifles in the game itself, the devs commented on the fact that they want Ash players to get out of their comfort zone and try other operators as Ash is a basic operator/ easy to play. Not that removing the acog is a big deal, she will still be a high tier op
---
keep up the great work :)
---
Is it just me but watching this a second time when he turns to the other cameras can you hear in your head, ‚Äúnever mind I‚Äôll find someone like youuuuuuuuuuu‚Äù

Van diemon's land is a myth!
---
It did trick people and game publishers continue to trick people with trailers like that.
---
ive never once seen it written TF|2. its always tf2 coz no one likes team fortress
---
Fun, but not op
---
thats why he needed a blitz. what you're saying is the complete wrong way to play with shields. they are shield operators with pistols, not the other way around. if you see players on a suicide mission run and gun with blitz you're either playing at a very low rank or the blitz has god like aim. he feels at a really good place on the tts. he's not too slow but he's noticably slower, also his flash radius is a lot closer. 
---
lol theres no list of exclusive acronyms
---
With hair like that, he looks less badass and looks like a hipster.
---
He is a biker. No biker has that hair ever.
---
can I request a vigil?
---
Am I stupid or is Yokai and Valk cams no Electronic device (^_^) Sorry for the bad Englisch im German Lmao
---
I don't think that will work , blitz blinds anyone , even a toilet .
---
0.002 so I can adjust the sensitivity more precisely, 8 felt too fast.
---
I think an important thing to consider too is that these numbers may be so high because of the console players.  Blitz is much harder to play against on console because of how much precision it can take to headshot him.  Controllers are just not great for that and there is probably a large portion of the playerbase that doesn't adjust sensitivity or has it set to high for them.  Most Blitz on console can just charge and get away with it.

I mean, by definition doing any work would cost them time and money. They could simply just not release content. Which is what they chose to do.

Regardless of if your teammates aren't helpful or not, it is going to take you a hell of a lot longer to get used to this game than mos other FPS games.

Whoever threw that smoke gonna get a talking to for sure haha

If I had to guess, first week or march.

That smoke was so clutch
---
Clash
---
His flashes are already shit, not "the best in the game." Every other stun is better than blitz
---
I like your way of thinking here. So as a retort to this, what about, ignoring the defenders, taking acogs from AR's where that operator has access to an acog or where their loadout pick rate is vastly unbalanced in their selection like ash?
---
This is so cool. I can't wait to see a whole series of operators in this style
---
Tru
---
thanks it means alot to me to see such appreciation for something i've actually created! &lt;3 
---
oh boy... if he gets some kind of optic camo similar to mgs4 solid snake that will cause some serious headaches...
---
This game is competitive and played competitive by most players so no we don't want casual maps like house to be released we want good solid maps.
---
House shouldn't be changed that's sure but it also shouldn't be a house 2 in game 
---
Bad idea. 
---
That's not what you're suggesting whatsoever.
---
It's kinda frustrating how games make shotguns .
---
They go further than you'd expect and the spread is less than what you're seeing in games .
---
You can kill a mid - long range target easily with buckshot
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
So... Gay biker? 
---
not true at all his flashes are the most constant in the game and will always flash if you are close enough. You can't even turn around to avoid being flashed
---
I would check the ranks of the players banning Blitz. It was always very low. My team banned lion consistently, and we often 3 stacked. Other wo players would try to ban blitz. 
---
The amount of bitching about Blitz in the community is purely due to the fact people don‚Äôt know how to counter him.
---
To be honest it's much harder to spawnpeek in elevator cuz your full body is exposed while the attackers only have their head shown
---
Do you have any links to a website or page for the league?
---
I play on console and would probably be quite interested in looking for a team.
---
Haha indeed lol, I like it too
---
Key words. "Close enough" the flash itself is powerful, but you have to be kissing the enemy for it to be useful

Wym? Your post has nothing about casual in it lol. Also, I am referring to maps that already exist. You‚Äôre literally suggesting that they make new shit maps instead of reworking broken ones. Why in any circumstance would they make new maps just to add into casual? 
---
Australia doesn't even exist, so how could there be islands near by?
---
looking like a fucken angry orange
---
Yeah, Lion should have been a 1 speed.
---
At least we now finally have another non-shield 1 speed on attack. 
---
Maybe if you hit his shield with enough ammo, it stuns him and knocks him backwards. This doesnt expose Blitz as he doesnt fall over but it may be enough time for the defender to run and get help or reload. I agree he is strong in 1v1s

Meanwhile dumbasses in road to S.I. Are banning Blitz...
---
She's trash tier though. One impact or like 10 bullets stop her plans completely. She definitely doesn't need a nerf
---
Yes sir 
---
Then it could be balance, but an unnecessary change. Take for example, jackals are. The thing was a monster on release, best damage, best firerate, and best reload speed, did it get its acog taken? No, because it didnt need it taken away. It got its stats nerfed. The r4c is unique because its viable in almost all ranges, and gobbi, being good, wants to fix this by taken away on of the r4cs major advantages. Without the acog she is no where near as viable at medium range as she once was, now only being truly affective in close range. Thats why the g36c still has acog. I rest my case.
---
It's the same as lowering the FOV, but instead of a 1:1 width:height change, it only changes the width.
---
It's not placebo, but it certainly looks dumb (plus it's CQC, periferal vision is important)
---
TY
---
I really like these two characters. The polarized personalities is very cool 
---
Unlike Glaz and Monty, Ying has the lowest win delta of all attackers and 3rd lowest pickrate. She does not decimate this much in ranked where Yager has 60% pickrate and no one bothers clearing ADS.
---
his flashes still flash at close-mid range and his passive ability makes that pretty easy to accomplish
---
Definitely. This game is really unique. So much different than anything else even with my 150+ hours.
---
Shhhhh don‚Äôt expose my next project

Normally, my mic is not working. However, my mic is working so fine that my friend even can hear me. I felt so relieved for this shit. My best advice is to set your mic to "on", but not push to talk. Turn your volume threshold to 0 for voice btw. If that doesn't work then, maybe make a teamspeak or discord group with your friends to speak.

---
We're not even in to the first season and there's already complaining about a future character being OP. We don't even know their gadget for sure.
---
Maybe changes to smoke grenades and barbed wire too? 
---
Agree with you on your sentiments. Except Fortress.
---
*Fortress is bae.*
---
Yeah it's really the best. It's a mix of old and modern and it works really well.
---
WEEKS?! 
---
Shucks
---
She's going to be decent i think, her gadget's pretty good to compensate for the downsides, but her guns do seem a bit bad, which is not ideal if you're a 1 speed op. 
---
They have color....
---
Yeah him and mozzie lmao
---
It's Sledge...
---
Open r/rainbow6 and check the top right corner for 3 dots. Click that and it should show an option for community flairs
---
She could widen the detection area **and** optimise his code. Not necessarily increasing range by optimising code.
---
Almost like it's a team based game
---
Give the LVPO on the M249 to Gridlock‚Äôs assault rifle, and this to Mozzie‚Äôs Commando
---
Thats awesome
---
Then no one would use any other sights.  Ubi puts good sights on certain weapons that aren‚Äôt super powerful to make them a little better.
---
inferior smoke main
---
Wh-what?
---
Personally, it's because it goes against the nature/mechanics/feel of the game. On top of that, it would further split the player base and it would take longer to find games (more game-modes means less people for matchmaking in every mode). Things like Outbreak Mode and the Halloween maps are fun because they're goofy, limited time engagements, but they always lead back to the core game. Siege doesn't need to hop on the Battle Royale train because its base gameplay is already what the fans want. BR is a crowded market and it would only tarnish the unique nature of Siege if they tried to shoehorn that mode into the game. Not to mention, they'd have to rework a lot of the mechanics (TTK, weapon mechanics like bullet drop, gadget purpose, etc).
---
I don't know, it's just an opinion, but I think that a BR mode would upset the hardcore player base and only bring in new players who don't care about what we, as fans, like about the game.
---
&gt;This game is competitive and played competitive by most players 
---
You got a source for this? 
---
Exactly. *Over* the hole, not directly on the hole, so I shouldn't have gotten that kill.
---
Most of the time you can do the same tricks, but some dont work for some reason.
---
What ?
---
Wait wait wait- Is it coming back!?
---
His passive being? A shield isn't a passive, it's a weapon. Also what do you consider medium range
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got em!!!
---
I‚Äôm a tad confused. Explanation please?
---
Play maverick than you pp head
---
his passive is sprinting with his sheild up. this covers everything but his legs 
---
Internet Explorer users... smh
---
Best time to start
---
I‚Äôm loving this!!!!
---
&gt; I personally think its a great decision to prioritize reworking existing maps instead of adding new ones that suck in the end again (fortress, tower, favela, ...)
---
The irony is two of the maps you listed were *designed to be competitive* 
---
And if you remember with Favela, one of those uncompetitive maps no one wants in ranked, when they threatened to remove it from the game entirely there were riots and countless people claiming "Okay it shouldn't be in ranked but leave it in casual" 
---
aw fuck i cant believe you‚Äôve done this
---
But maverick is just slower thermite 
---
I want one with long hair and a ponytail
---
Ngl I like the artwork
---
When you play vs people who don't know what drones are

It still happens if you stay still and just turn around or simply reload.
---
Thanks men
---
It‚Äôs called glacier. You could only get it season 1. 
---
You can crouch and lean at the same time... Also what shows that he IS using controller is how when he turns, it is usually ALWAYS a straight line, no jitter or anything.
---
It would make Shields mostly useless, Fuze would just be a way worse Montagne, Montagne would be unchanged and Blitz would still be busted in many situations except he'd now *need* a wingman following him around to clean up the blinded enemies (which is already the best thing to do with Blitz) and he will be slower now bc he can't shield sprint. 
---
Just to compare them all to Clash, the current worst operator in the game:
---
Clash: can slow down enemies and damage them, she also has a full auto secondary smg with a sight. 
---
Blitz: can blind enemies instead, has a low damage pistol.
---
Montagne: the same except he can now be killed 1v1 with a melee attack.
---
Fuze: he'll suck, but Fuze players will just never use a shield again to fix that.
---
So basically it's a big nerf to Monty, Blitz will be changed significantly, going from a rusher to a Monty that blinds you and then has his teammate kill you, Fuze with shield will be useless.
---
That‚Äôd be pretty neat of the somehow added handstops in the game. Be that middle ground between the AFG and VFG. Not as fast as the AFG, but not as good at holding down recoil as the VFG.
---
I wouldn't even be mad if I was the maestro tbh
---
Kade?Kaid I guess?
---
If yes, you should say his name like Kaa-eed , and not kade.
---
Better
---
THEY HAVE SKINS IN THE GAME FOR BOTH BUT ZERO OF THE OPERATORS FROM THE LOCATIONS
---
Physically they ARE bigger. The enemy takes up more pixels on your monitor.
---
In game (as in, the game engine) it does not.
---
The assumption is that with wider enemies (as in, wider on your monitor) it makes it easier to aim at them, which is true. Same reason why ACOGs are useful (since it makes the enemies physically bigger, since it zooms in)
---
Thats lion 
---
HAHhahahAHHA
---
I‚Äôm talking about the people, not what they are doing.
---
I used to play Counter Strike on a semi pro level back in CS: source and I can 100% say that bad "timing" is extremely common and just as frustrating.
---
That sounds dummy op
---
Nice planning and nice luck too.
---
It's kinda sad that some people on this thread think you are. Just the way you turn around is such an obvious piece of evidence that you are using a controller.
---
I did my part to downvote you down to just 4
---
Buff Doc
---
Yeah, except for the loading times, especially for PC where people often get kicked for taking too long to load in.
---
I see that you‚Äôre not a fan of the United States. 
---
You could nerf it somehow.. you go to camera vision when you use it so you‚Äôre more vulnerable.
---
Or get certain amount of ammo.
---
Camera is shootable then it‚Äôs redundant and it only shoots 90 degree or something
---
One of the problems with Clash is that she's a defending operator, her shield is an offensive tool that should be used to move from cover-to-cover, but it's instead in a defending role where you're already set up to be in cover, using something to counter powerful lines of sight as... Something, I don't even know, I mean, half of the people who play Clash don't really seem to be able to use her correctly, the other half aren't very good at it and just annoy the shit out of anyone who actually fights her despite her lacking gadget.
---
Yea.. we dont need any more Germans
---
that's not sway but bounce?
---
Lmao the amount of times I‚Äôve done this 
---
You guys are talking about New Zealand where is Tasmania
---
If you're gonna switch to mnk on console you're a coward as well.
---
That's what her gadget has always looked like
---
That‚Äôs very neatstro. I like 
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about something like that a lot as well, i think it would be nice so I don‚Äôt have to play god awful maps.
---
But what the fuck is the bot doing?
---
Glacier from season 1 its not available any more

Apparently, aside from the FBI ops.

---
It is too cute. I love seeing things like this.
---
srry bro is lion
---
Ah, he even looks like a pussy
---
Why are you proposing the exact opposite of reality? 
---
We are getting a "working" game with no maps. Period. They can do map buffs and churn out a casual map at the same time. They can fix the game, like they always do, at the same time. 
---
Making a less balanced (as long as it's not horribly broken) map is far less effort than a competitive, fully balanced, fully play tested ranked tier map. You can just churn it out and deploy it. 
---
... they fixed it for next season. 
---
Glaz as a soft breach? 
---
Have you played ranked in Gold and Plat? Most games have blitz there.
---
i think so
---
(X) to doubt.
---
This is beyond science
---
But still, you can hide behind a wall, hold an angle and anyone who tries to fight it is dead. It is pretty much blackbeard but this time you actually just cannot shoot him at all
---
Alright
---
Yeah that might be cool, maybe some thing like the rainbow six Vegas games
---
Looks kinda like nomad from wild lands.
---
don't play a game meant for 17+ when you're 12, it's technically illegal üëªüëªüëªüëªüëªüëªüëª

Legendary alpha pack headgear. Faded leather I believe 
---
G2 banned Cav in one of their games on Villa due to the glitch.
---
So you get a handgun that you have to slowly swap to instead of the quick ADS animation even though rn normal shield ops already lose basically every 1v1 fight unless they're Blitz with charges left.
---
The added defense will not make up for losing:
---
1. Killing power (both ohk melee and shooting with shield out)
---
2. Decreased mobility (you need to put away your shield to run)
---
3. In Montagne's case just being straight up nerfed bc your shield is now vulnerable to melee. 
---
its not bad if using as bait or if you got a table behind. 
---
I mean when your name is "FortniteIsDope" it says all.

UPDATE:  
---
I have tried to update the integrated graphics driver but it comes up with an error, saying something along the lines of "Windows has found drivers for the unit, but an error occurred whilst trying to install"

I then tried to follow the Ubisoft forums thread ([https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1814978-Battleye-blocked-loading-of-file](https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1814978-Battleye-blocked-loading-of-file)), so R6S, Steam and BattlEye all ran as admin, but again to no avail. I'm going to re-install the game hoping a miracle will happen (somehow)
---
Maybe just don‚Äôt let it shoot then and it‚Äôs an ability to quickly check around corners
---
Half the time people don't even realize people are looting in the same area as you until they start shooting. Being able to choose your drop location doesnt necessarily dictate when you'll have your fist engagement. And imagin thinking BRs have more unpredictability than siege...thats a good laugh to start the day. Thanks bud!
---
A map buff needs not that much effort because they knew where's the problem so they have more time to rework ops, rework gadgets, and fixing bugs, netcode, hit boxes and ranked system and that's what they doing in year 4 so what's ur point again? Making a useless map because u would like it? Doesn't sound like a good concept for a multimillion company

I‚Äôd be 100% okay with bringing back old pro league sets, but old seasons skins are limited for a reason.  It‚Äôs a way to show off ‚ÄúI played during this season.‚Äù  Black ice gets special treatment for some reasons.

Too bad she got nerfed this season.

Right? I thought they were supposed to fix her instead they hit her with the chubby stick.

It seems the red lines between operators signify bad relations and the green ones signify good relations. How interesting. Also how come fuze isn't in the shield category, he has a shield.

Balance = fun, because you won't constantly be losing one side because of a bad map design that favoured the opposing side. Losing isn't fun unless you wanted to. You just wasted your time.
---
Dude I have no idea what you're talking about. I've seen maybe 2 star wars movies and I don't remember any quote from them. You know not everything is a reference about your nerdy hobbies right? Maybe if you got a job you wouldn't be so obsessed with a children's film. Another win fo me
---
Massive demand for it, and now no one cares about Black Ice because every man and their dog has half the set. That's a great example for why Ubi shouldn't do it, value and prestige is low for the skin now.

I‚Äôd imagine the only way to implement that into a game like this is maybe only one side (front or back) is cloaked at a time maybe? Or it might even cause damage if it‚Äôs on for too long who knows

Outbreak recruit? Don‚Äôt you mean White Castle?

I'm just waiting for a map set in Santorini üòç

That‚Äôs all I used, until I started forcing myself to use ACOG and I eventually began to love it. You also learn how to hold different angles that are a little farther. My defense with ACOG vs no ACOG changes how I play.

yeah that's true

I mean if they make a lion movie just grab ryan reynolds 
---
It was a free weekend so all the operators were unlocked for that. It was not a permanent change

I thought the base game ops are free cause I had about all then the update came then I had all

Still thought the change was stupid, she didn't need to be nerfed.

This is the most relatable thing I‚Äôve seen all day

Its not that big. A good player can adapt to a small change like that and thrive with the other sights. And if you blame your lack of kills on the lack of an acog then get better or use another op.

It's called a pop-shot.

I wouldn't say Ela's gun is her best gun, it depends, also, it is incredibly inaccurate amongst semi-automatic shotguns, coming from someone who (at least on the defensive side) uses most of them.
---
I don't agree with picking what maps you play (since there's no pick and ban for maps) when playing  competivaly, as you could be good on 2-3 maps, only play these 2-3 maps and get a rank you don't deserve since you only played a couple of maps and have no idea how any other map plays.

Not r/woooosh

Joke acknowledged by poster

Roamers are easily droned out, Vigil is less so. Vigil can work as an anchor, but his intended purpose is as a roamer, which is why he‚Äôs three speed. 
---
The gods have been pleased.

THATS CASTLE? Looks more like a operator leak!
---
‚ÄúOh shi-‚Äú
---
the only shooters i‚Äôve played extensively are socom (3rd person), destiny, cod, and siege. sidearms were useful in all of those except cod. man, i miss socom.
---
Headshots don‚Äôt really exist in shotguns, but it will still give you headshot points. 
---
it's a simple solution but idk why Ubi doesn't want to do anything about it! a lot of competitive games have this, like csgo.
---
it has ruined the game for gold players, cause the average MMR of every single one of these squads is between gold 1-4 ! gold is a fckn hell right now, if you get stuck in it you can't come out no matter how much you try ... every time I start a win streak there comes this kinda matches that screws everything I've done in like 10 minutes!
---
There's a short blurb about it in this image. bottom right of the corkboard... And for the record, Sam Fisher moved to Third Echelon from the CIA - not the Secret Service.

You should make a poster out of it.Good job!
---
Oh ok. I'm not terribly upset about it cuz I still killed him but now I know why it downed him.
---
Me to bro I'll pray for you 
---
I honestly think it's way too erratic even for close-medium range.  The MP7 is pretty similar, and my opinion is if they made the CZ similar to that gun but with just a bit more vertical recoil you could keep the 40rd mag.  No impacts but a good gadget for locking down areas would still be okay.  Obviously dont make the gun like it was when she was broken.  The bad recoil and damage nerf just kinda makes her not that good at all.
---
Am I the onlo one who is comparing uniform on this photo to every Frogman Corps photo on Google, to make me believe we're going to get Frogman?

Hello there mr

Ya that‚Äôs what happens it‚Äôs just really annoying

The fuck is this elitism? Are we really at the point of hating on people for their choice of aspect ratio??
---
Yeah I could see that

I don‚Äôt even think I need to ask what rank you are.
---
Thx dad :)
---
Woah there cowboy
---
Just some really immature people bro üò™
---
Cam would actually be pretty decent for clash. 
---
That, and if any pellet in the shotgun touched the head it was a headshot. So people would just spray as many shotgun rounds as possible and one pellet would connect and kill. It was miserable.
---
Also notice that all the attacker gadgets are on the left side (excluding the drone since it can technically be used by both sides) maybe it's an Attacker gadget?
---
Question is: should I force myself to use ACOG until I get better with it or stick with what feels good right now?

True that

My girl is looking sharp

Im kinda new to siege and outta the loop what is this and what does this mean
---
Tachanka is still awesome :)
---
As stated, it sounds plausible. Ubisoft is probably hinting at something, if it is a tripwire sensor for attacker‚Äôs, imma be so damn happy
---
Fisher would be insalely OP and mechanically wouldn't really work anywhere in 6.

*Pulls out a knife* As my mate Thatcher would tell me, "no lag"

He used false hockey puts so what? It's a misdemeanor at best.

Yeah we don‚Äôt need such thing; we got Mira windows.
---
It's like Dark matter in BO4 lol
---
damn it karen
---
A mobile deployable shield, i guess its similiar to maestro cam and the bulletproof cam:
---
Same gadget in common and special form, season 2 will be the shield meta, on defense.
---
Ano it sucks big time. I think it was a rushed lean/spam fix. instead of just adding a cool down inbetween crouch and lean and removing the ability to ads from standing lean and you come out of ads when you crouch. (If you understand me) 
---
I mean technically shotgun HIPFIRE spread should be tighten by ability... But guess what? It is.
---
Came to say this. That is 100% a flash bang.
---
Nomad and kaid just chilling 
---
I did this yesterday to a poor IQ on tower. Was in the rafters above elevator and as an afterthought just as I was passing one of the hatches, turned and shot it with Jackal's secondary shotgun and IQ walked in front of me just as I did it
---
It was an interesting bug tho you have to admit. Not nearly as annoying as some others 
---
What really? The gun is pretty trash as it is
---
I watched his voice lines video and a couple Koreans said he had a north Korean accent
---
casual tho
---
buck mains always kill themselves with nades at least once
---
I still don't understand why they made her so fat....
---
Bro idk what kinda bananas you been eating, but are you alright?
---
You right. The e curves into the r, thought it was an a.
---
I've always said this, even back in the beginning. How does the shield melee actually kill somehow? Getting punched with a big metal plate wouldn't be enjoyable, but it would hardly kill someone. Assuming they are punching with the flat part and not a jab with the edge. I think it should only do 20-30 damage, and knock you down like the air jab. Gives the shield op an opportunity to ads and shoot, but doesn't make them a tank that can just run through the enemy at will.
---
Yeah Technical expertise on how to blow stuff up. 
---
Give us full customizability. let us use piccatinny sights on Russian Guns. Let me use an okp on a mp7. Let me swap out my stock for other ones. Shorter barrels for ADS speed. Let me choose to use tons of 10 rounders, some 30 rounders or a couple 60 rounders.
---
Yes, I prefer to play casual instead of ranked. Everyone has a preference. 
---
Magic
---
Weapon/Equipment skin = trash as well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
So basically Mira?
---
Matchmaking should just be random. My account only finds plats and diamonds in casual while I only play for fun.  
---
It kinda ruins what casual means, If people want a balanced match they should play ranked.  
---
Ofcourse low levels should get matched against eachother. But level 100+ should get matched in one pool, casual now takes ages to find a match and when it does people have 10 times my ping just so that I go against the same MMR -.-  
---
On my starter pack account I find level 100 and 200+ guys who play against level 10(my starter pack) but when my level 200 account wants to play casual it has to wait 5 minutes, thanks ubisoft!  
---
Man would that be fun.
---
Grenades and lmg and I play doc, playing team medic has always been fun for me.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea actually, a bulletproof cam would go well with Clash. Better than impacts at least 
---
If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, then why can‚Äôt I think of an example of the Cobra Effect?

A finka main that dont hate finkas guns this is new.

This is rich coming from a fuckin Ela main.

Youll have the skins when you buy them

There is nothing really wrong with it but to be fair I like the lmg the most it hits like a tank, her ar is a aight but lmg is more fun

Honest question, how many times are you going to post this exact clip before you think ‚Äúyou know I think that‚Äôs enough‚Äù 
---
They can also change portrait photos.
---
Also why they don't change rank symbols. They can do minor interventions to make the game content look nice, but they don't.

Hello danny1201, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/at8ajn/petition_to_maka_danish_crown_prince_the_danish/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
it‚Äôs hard to say without a gauge of what skill level you currently are and what your strengths/ weaknesses are, but in general I‚Äôd say watch the odd pro league game, these guys know the ins and outs of every map and every operator and it‚Äôs the fastest way to learn  new tricks and what does and doesn‚Äôt work in siege. 
---
also, don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment- again, I don‚Äôt know you from Adam so you could be the #1 ranked Doc player in the world, and you just sit in site every round and never die. If that‚Äôs the case, give jager a go, and try and play more aggressively and see where your strengths and weaknesses lie and go from there. 
---
don‚Äôt get mad when you die, watch the kill cams and try and get a gauge of the reason you seem to be dying most rounds. A lot of the time it‚Äôs not preventable or it‚Äôs just being outgunned etc, but again there‚Äôs stuff to be learnt here. If you‚Äôre *always * dying to a blackbeard or a glaz, you‚Äôre probably peeking too much, and if you always just get outgunned then it‚Äôs just a case of going in to t hunt and practising your aim.

do you have any extra six invt code that you can give me? üòÇ just kidding what did it feel like to play the new ops for the first time?
---
Think of it like Fov. If you bump it up to 90 you feel alot faster than you do when the fov is 60 even though you're moving the same speed. I see it the same way with different aspect ratios, yes it feels easier to aim because enemies are slightly bigger zoomed, but it's still the same game with or without the native Res
---
I like how Doc's chill with everyone except Lion lol. No-one likes the poor dude.
---
Could that be Dane above the TL attack 
---
And where‚Äôs the Blackbeard?
---
Yeah I've done the 3000 points and I've won rounds with Glaz, Fuze, and Chanka. None are being rewarded or progresses. I'm saving up for the unicorn and army man outfits too.
---
Lean spamming yes but not crouch spamming yet this will be probably fixed by season 2. 
---
Change the ranked map pool to esl maps already! (maybe keep the 2 or 3most recent maps too to see how they play out) 
---
Restart the game and see if it still says you own it. Sometimes with new bundles it glitches and says you own it even if you don't.
---
Same thing happened to me with the Blitz bundle
---
straight from the go kanye
---
Awesome setup but, you might want to put your pc on a mat not on a carpet my dude
---
Tell that to vigils 
---
The way I play him is use the claws to electrocute barbed wire &amp; shields from either below or on the other side of a wall. It is actually really useful. Example Set 2 barbed wire on a door entering the obj and either place the claw below or on the opposite side of a wall to create a tricky situation. I've actually gotten kills with this trick because most of the time people just melee the wire. 
---
More like HOLY SHIT! Lol 
---
No, do you?
---
Seems like you are correct. I just rewatched the video I saw this in and they were on attack.
---
Good question. 
---
I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a flex. I play lesion most and I think he‚Äôs best roaming the outside of objectives picking when his Gu gets triggered. Like an aggressive bouncer. Or roam him up and down choke points trailing his mines behind him so he can‚Äôt get flanked. 
---
Well if I can ask you anything then what‚Äôs your favorite super market?
---
Was the event value for money?

 this post sucks

Yeah i understand where you coming from with the no white but the gold outlines match with the gold outlines on Ash's leaked pro league set too and exact same position on the uniform list

Thanks for your in depth response, I‚Äôll defiantly take what you said into account and try it out!

So when you say all shields does this include an extended Montagne?
---
PS: I know my post is ironic, but can we stop spaming subreddit with every cutout from one wallpaper?
---
Are you sure it's pretty rare? I have Ash, IQ, and mute with black ice for all guns. 
---
He does this every time for the past 3 seasons and you play along with him for those 3 seasons yet you don't encourage it? You just let him ruin the game.

Unsure, but it was more the fact he didn't source at all combined with it came off as a bit dodgy

They changed it back to how it used to be, start with recruit and then buy base ops increasingly getting more expensive to a max of 2000 renown per op. In total it takes 25k to unlock all of them.
---
*Twitch rework
---
In all honesty, I don't think it's that good of a skin
---
Thank you guys for such in depth and helpful responses :)
---
I suppose they should make Kaid hurt his back if he runs too much as well, ooh maybe even let Jackal have a mental breakdown after he scans footprints or even better have Lion torture random animal on the map instead of playing the objective...
---
Just watching this stressed me out
---
That‚Äôs how I felt with ash acog removal 
---
Well in an earlier comment by you, you stated that he has a 22 percent pick rate, so let‚Äôs go with that. 22 percent isn‚Äôt even in the top ten most picked ops, and I know he doesn‚Äôt get banned a lot because I actually watch pro league outside majors, so what is your point?

How dare people not look like their carefully angled pics lol
---
They also show your location, most players will easily notice it on the wall. Thus it is generally recommended that you only run them on shotguns (since you will almost always hipfire with them), or shield operators since you will hipfire a lot more with their guns and stealth isn't a remote option.

I like but never get. My friend who started playing like three weeks ago got one for medic and rook

Fisher is better at handling environments (sneaking, jumping) while being a top notch shooter/fighter but he's not built for the stuff Rainbow does (besieging a compound and clearing it).

Whereas, in theory, one Rainbow guy can John Wick a house full of White Masks.  Sam could do the same, too, but he couldn't speed through it, I'd think.

They can be arranged in a ring. All of the LEDs don't have to be on all the time either, so having them also be a visual timer is still plausible. The short range of tracking would definitely be the effect of less LEDs flooding the FOV.

---
That was Doc.  Lion's face was never shown off during Outbreak, it was only Doc.

The only faces that were fully rendered without anything blocking them were Thermite, Doc, and Ash.  Tachanka also had his "Face" rendered, however that still included his camo balaclava.

Why
---
I had played since beta and for 2 years I used that technique and solo queued myself to plat almost every single season and I found myself using the stance change more than I needed the lean. So you should do fine as well. Getting that scuf though really changed things. Went from around 50ish sensitivity to 90s with a 50ish ads. Lol

:D
---
Well once you get there, you'll make your mind up about it's colour
---
Again?
---
I don't see why you imply that the map points are only for the attacker OPs origin place

That's probably because we are getting ops from Peru and Mexico in Y4S3

I would be semi-fine with farming if just getting 1 op didn't take upwards of 20 hours. Make me grind skins and shit, but not a core gameplay mechanic. Having less ops is objectively a disadvantage on a game like r6.

Oh no power to ya just a joke
---
yea same here :/
---
Hmmm, why would you want to spend people making skins for heroes that are almost never played? You know that lol is made for horny boys? And they will pick the big tiddie Ahri instead of some kind Warwick even if he'll be meta
---
Seems theres issues between the Canadians and the Russians too, makes sense tbh.
---
"If they die, they die..."
---
I think it needs to be faster unless they changed it recently.
---
No. Theres clearly a note saying buff with docs circled name. Its ops being changed and played with. Also some hints on designed roles and styles of play. 
---
LUL fucking gold cuck your opinion is irrelevant , go back to playing fortnite or console u gook
---
GRW references
---
F for Cayde-6
---
shotguns have 0 headshot multiplier. a headshot and a body shot do the same damage. you‚Äôre better off aiming for the body tbh, because there‚Äôs more area for your pellets to hit. it still tells you if you kill/down someone with a headshot on a shotgun, though. 
---
The only names were mozzie an gridlock which I‚Äôm pretty sure we already knew by the time the trailer came out
---
Remember, no hostages
---
Good clip but now become the 300iq play and do that as an attacker but place a claymore in the hole as they are defusing!
---
Use a #, #LIKE THIS

Except it‚Äôs not funny

My girl

Got the same skin a wile back had to become a mute main

Darn, guess I‚Äôll go back to playing Vegas 2 until I get gold.
---
I swear I yell this sometimes when I see a teammate reloading in front of an enemy on the objective.
---
*Gaz telling you to switch to your pistol intensifies*
---
Know why this happens? They got hacks so they know when you look away (expect the unexpected)
---
Honestly don‚Äôt have much trouble with blitz players that try to solo rushdown. Just hold some distance and hold on their head. They‚Äôll try to ads and you pop them in the face. If they try to close the gap just shoot exposed body parts. 
---
Could just be that I‚Äôm trash and face trash blitz players, but I find them obnoxious but not difficult. Give me a shield Ofer something like maverick any day.

144hz but even when I capped the game to 144hz in the ini. File it would drop below that for no reason 
---
Nope

AC: Oddessy reference more likely. There are GRW references so it seems more likely to be another references than something not mentioned in this year 4 reveal
---
There you happy
---
Yes but I‚Äôm curious as to how the got it in the first place and what else they may use it for 
---
Dude I have read it it‚Äôs for discussion as to what it‚Äôs gonna be used for or who‚Äôs going to use it...
---
She got promoted after dealing with the White Masks, if you've played the situations or terrorist hunt, you have seen them.

More likely Ubi couldn't afford Angela Bassett, so they replaced her

Doesn‚Äôt the board have Best Mates by thatchers picture connected to smoke it looks like

Post #I‚Äôve lost count
---
Ahh ok thanks :)
---
I was just about to post this. Look at the shield with wheels? thoughts? 
---
I do to
---
The two black iced I have are SUPER 90, and fuze/finka lmg
---
that's not a knife, THIS IS A KNIFE!
---
Also interchangeable with "got cs:go'd"
---
Please no invisible ops, words cannot describe how busted that would be
---
Ok i unsub
---
I like that one, too bad a universal skin will be coming out just like it.
---
Maestros lmg pre hipfire nerf 
---
Every problem‚Äôs got a root cause, lol.  I think maybe RPM for the MK14 is too low and needs to be buffed, but drop damage to 65.
---
The ability might be tweaking, too
---
Where would you suggest I start?  I‚Äôm gonna try taking a look at the ability first
---
Im joking m8
---
i think you was right. 
---
Ur dad
---
Not intended but there's an entire feature that lets you play on it
---
Id consider burning down all of French Canada if that were true. 
---
Mhm.
---
Ela getting a kill
---
Well then in reality you're only dropping from 144fps to 110 minus frametime. And to me that doesn't seem all that drastic. You cannot expect many games nowadays to achieve 144 constantly.
---
I zoomed in a bunch it looks like smoke to me you can see a full gas mask in the front
---
possible chanka buff lol
---
Fooking Chunky mains
---
But he slapped lion to the face so he doesnt love attackers either 
---
They obtained it by making bust, its used to fund the R6 program.
---
Frost should be in lesion's place imo.
---
You run out of places to put your mines if you anchor lesion. Its way more effective to set your first to mines around obj, then move outward. That way you can maximize the amount of places you'll get warnings from people stepping on them.  Filling obj with mines is pointless apart from Hostage rescue.
---
yeh that‚Äôs legit the next line in the video 
---
Damn didnt know someone posted it already :/
---
I miss Glaz's rifle pre recoil nerf.
---
His wife is alive, but you may be right about corruption in Rainbow
---
The underlying note may give a bigger hint but my latin isn‚Äôt that good.
---
If this ever in the game I‚Äôm yeehawing on everybody
---
Crowd Control means controlling the actions and movements of a group. I'm pretty sure a big fucking bear trap is gonna make you think twice about jumping through a window or over a barrier.

Hello crazycharlo90, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ata766/rest_in_peace_rook/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Starter edition just got free upgrade to standard edition for all starter edition owners
---
yeah true, wanted to get a gold charm at least though but doesnt look like thats happening
---
Yeah I know thats why I was confused
---
You're absolutely right, same as when you get frustrated trying to learn anything new, it's always good to take a small break and come back.
---
Yea I believe translated this means ‚Äúthe hunter Corp‚Äù
---
ADHD players just got their new main.
---
I didn‚Äôt even read that üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Starter edition player here. All starter edition players received a change where all base ops are no 2k renown instead of 12.5k. it makes unlocking new ops much faster and makes it feel like less of a grind.
---
Yeah, I agree I was a bit to the side so that could have explained the melee, but I was still 2D and merged into the shield in the replay
---
sorry, I didn‚Äôt know the title ‚ÄúSick Mozzie Art‚Äù actually meant ‚Äúofficial ubi art‚Äù or ‚Äúubi art team‚Äù
---
That's up to you. Do you want to grind for ops or get several to start with. I bought mine with season pass starting year 2. But had to grind original 20 and year 1s. 
---
Happens pretty often.... 
---
oops lmao i meant deluxe 
---
Data limits may apply
---
you're actually a fuckin brainlet lmfao
---
it's about the art not the characters

Vent: I love this game but solo queuing in casual is so frustrating. 15% chance you‚Äôll get team killed on purpose and 15% chance you‚Äôll randomly get kicked by your team. 
---
I just don‚Äôt understand what makes people enjoy ruining other people‚Äôs fun. I had time for one game before going to my second job and I get voted out of a game halfway through. Looking forward to the TK punishment going into effect. 
---
Perhaps a loading screen for the loading screen? Maybe a loading screen for the loading of the loading screen just in case.
---
Because people on this subreddit are mostly faggots.
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to the game, so I‚Äôm just gonna go a head and study that top right corner
---
Looks awesome, love your style :) 
---
On console, with V-sync on its locked at 30, with it off its capped at 60 but dips from time to time to 50, but only for like a second 
---

Love some good ADHD representation in games. Makes me feel even more at home with siege.

Not on the roadmap but they did announce that it was Secret Service at the Invitational.

YOU'RE THE LAST ONE COMPLETE THE MISSION

I missed that part of the stream then
---
I know, I'm just saying, if you wanna do all the recruit colors
---
Not only stole it, but really downgraded the image quality 
---
Spy would be a 3 speed 1 armor
---
Merc would be 2 speed 2 armor 
---
I'd like to see some sort of vision mechanic (like the Sonar Goggles) on one of the operators. I'd also like to see the Fourth Echelon Spider-Bot (though do we have too many drones?) or some other gadget like the Ring Airfoil and introduce a knock out mechanic or something like that.
---
I like ur art style
---
*NO RUNNIN‚Äô IN THE HALLS!*
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
Yeah same thing happened to me and my friends in ranked, we were all playing but then kicked from the game in round 2, but stayed in the same party
---
I must have missed that part of the stream.
---
Thank you 
---
Deus Vult(?)
---
congratulations 
---
Didn't it leak like a year or so ago?
---
 My internet has gone out only during ranked matches for some reason recently. Went from gold 3 to silver 3 in a day so I feel you
---
I know and it irks me every time. I haven't seen something quite like that though.
---
Love this style! Nomad looks so cute 
---
Man, must be so wet. Why don't you just live on land like everyone else?
---
you can buy Bundles for R6 Credits but the single skins for renown in the normal operator tab
---
I think after -10 you stop losing. 
---
Just like how upvotes and karma aren‚Äôt the same. After certain upper and lower limits they stop being equivalent. 
---
 F
---
I went from console to PC (700+ hours on xbox) and got the highest while kt was 70% off. 
---
If you can afford it, its too good of a deal to pass up, and helped push a few friends to PC as well.
---
Yea Idk why I felt the need to put those since it was pretty damn obvious
---
What if you could grind for acoldes or titles on your characters/guns (stat tracks on CS for example) and other shit without having to grind the ops.
---
I'm not against grind. I'm an osrs player. I'm against bad business models.
---
They could add new things to grind, new things to grind in significant and fun ways that actually feel challenging. We just have the lazy way of grinding which is passive grinding that isn't any fun and it's just there as a wall for content.
---
I'm ok with that form of grinding when it comes to none-core gameplay stuff, but ops is crossing a line since it directly affects the outcome of a game. Caveira right now is completely busted due to her "bug", but I can't play her due to not having her. I have to suffer in ranked against players who have her and abuse her mechanics (it's not really a bug, it's just a mechanic abuse) without a single chance of me doing it myself, I'm at a direct disadvantage due to it. Maverick too and many other ops. Don't have ela so holding stairs with her on bank is not a strat I can do either which directly impacts how much I can win the map.
---
That‚Äôs stupid
---
Eh, Buck has too much kick for an ACOG to be effective in my opinion.
---
They might look at removing it from Twitch‚Äôs F2, I can seem removing it from IQ‚Äôs AUG, which is fine since the commando is better imo.
---
In terms of operators that would lose their ACOGs I honestly don‚Äôt know lmao.
---
That latin doesn‚Äôt translate to anything significant from what I can tell. Lorem ipsum dolor is typically Latin placeholder text.
---
He killed a hostageü§£ü§£
---
yeah i think ill do it, only 12 bucks 
---
Clearly you just need to watch that flank until the round ends. 
---
no, this guys just a raging penis.
---
the fact that this appears on his bio page and in two official blog posts does though.
---
don't get me wrong I've commisioned stream assets and will ALWAYS give credit to the artist I paid because he is responsible for the amazing work.
---
i just think at this point snark wasn't really necessary and the onus of credit falls on ubi first before op can give it.
---
Dang I was hoping ubi would give a tease or something
---
Doki regardless is sexy mami
---
Looks a little like Paul George with no hair
---
Well I think both of our opinions have our rights and wrongs...let‚Äôs just accept that and call it a day 
---
Probably Twitch's F2.
---
Isnt that "counter strike online"
---
&gt;brainlet
---
I'm going to use this term now hehe
---
I love how you called him rude but your the one that just called him a whore 
---
Add this without telling anyone, See how long it takes for the community to figure it out since no one ever actually picks their drones back up anyways.
---
you know, I was gonna say that we have other types of knives too but I honestly can't think of any others...
---
Idk... sounds fishy.
---
Yeah I think it was part of the roadmap reveal but I‚Äôd have to rewatch it.
---
haha you said the p*nis word
---
This is just an awful idea for both sides. Attack it would be broken, defense it would be terrible lol
---
Oh yep I‚Äôm putting that on rn
---
I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you chief but there are two
---
Not at all what I mean. 
---
My point is that the current hibana artwork shows a white teen male. With your logic hibana could be a martian but I'd still be in the wrong
---
If we go to the actual in game model [i'd say she looks more than half japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq7-wfYO_-I)
---
Please go around and ask your friends and family with a picture of the current hibana and ask for her race and gender. I'll be damned if they don't respond white male.
---
Link to the year 2 ops?
---
No, it‚Äôs downvoted because it‚Äôs literally a worthless comment. It‚Äôs like commenting ‚Äúlol.‚Äù Just upvote and move on. Don‚Äôt clutter the comment section.

Credit the original artist

Don't want to yokai can handle it

I play on console as well, on Xbox One.
---
Yeah. If a Ubi rep sees this I would gladly send over the account name of the player who force booted us out of the game. It was weird because it enacted that old bug where you can't search because it thinks your party members are already in a game.

ayy

Is there a theatre mode in seige or something? I've been seeing a few of these types of videos lately.
