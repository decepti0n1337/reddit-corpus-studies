The only thing that matters is winning

In your other comment you said you suck at it so it must take some skill, that or you’re just really bad.   
---

---
A huge part of this game is learning angles. With peekers advantage you can easily kill spawn peekers if you know where they will be.
---
Probably not. I was only replying like this because of the OP context. He seemed to be taking it seriously, so I did too.
---
Bruh how deep of a scroll are you on for 11 daat old post to come up?

the purpose of a solo queue playlist is to be matched with other people playing solo. banning communication is moronic. this game is based around team communication. banning it entirely is moronic. how would it be possible to do things as simple as breaching a wall if you can’t communicate.

To me, two in particular stand out. The Supernova and the FMG-9. Both are just terrible guns. The Supernova is really only good for softwall destruction, but Hibana has breaches for that. The FMG-9, on the other hand, is just *horrendously* bad in all departments.
---
Oddly enough we did
---
U could do the echo spawn peek with the yokais
---
nope. just your garbage internet
---
I think people only recently figured out how to do it effectively, I saw Evan’s video a couple days ago and saw talk of it before that. Seems legit though, and it generally follows party invites on Xbox.
---
Classic Libtard. Hahahahhahahahahahaha
---
I switched to PC and it's so much better. Xbox is fucking teeming with smurfs, they're like rats. It's way too easy to smurf on xbox.

IMO it looks like someone spilled lemonade in a pool, but it's not actually that bad.

Best feel ever to counter spawn peek
---
Ok, also, do you use the lmg?
---
Yings is ass, only good thing is the mag and was the reload, bow it's just the mag
---
Is it only for the seal ops
---
Is it a camera or just LEDs?
---
It’s good for newcomers to play against better players so they can see an example of how to play better
---
Oh shit I forgot about that
---
Nice
---
IQs lmg is great, high rof decent damage and fantastic recoil... Only has 50 rounds as an lmg but other than that it's nuts, and IQs ARs are pretty mediocre as well
---
Mate I’ve had diamonds from last season play me in bronze.

Fuck this seasons matchmaking.

Damn, thats nice

Someone spelled "peeked" properly !

---
HHAHAHAAHA... .    Love it.   Do more
---
Communication is a part of siege as much as aim and positioning
---
The only thing it really takes is speed and possession which takes a little bit of practice but honestly not a lot of scale which is why I'm not good at it because I don't waste my time practicing something that I don't like doing especially when all 4 of my team mates are trying to do it at the same time.
---
It's not really skillful and it does ruin some maps
---
well looks like I'm fucked, thx for telling me tho
---
Actually no. Glaz's dmr with supppressor now takes 1 more shot to kill unless u are within 10 metres. Thanks to 81 damage nerf from 180. Gun like f2 shines better without suppressor. It just boosts TTK pretty huge. F2 will take 2 more  bullets to kill beyond 15 metres whivh is bad because then TTK for the smg and ar will be same so you wont have firepower advantage anymore.
---
I have used suppressor on every gun INCLUDING buck's C8 in italy+ grim sky season just to see if its really worth the long run. It wasn't anywhere except on glaz, but lining up shots with suppressed OTS is hardest part there. If its about being stealthy behind smoke u can probably prone and enemy will prefire above u in most cases.
---
Frost's smg seems to have no disadvantage with suppressor ever though. I would love to put honorable mention here of r4c. Non existent recoil + general play style of ash makes her immune to damage nerf on her rifles. Unless you tryin to hold long angles ofc
---
#**you just had to fucking say it**
---
Why this picture tho ?
---
Too bad. Just tell them to get good lul XD
---
Not true, the Sterling was a 45 caliber while the Sten was a 9mm. Certain variations exist ofc but the model of the iron sights and mag curvature makes it the Sten, modernized
---
I have that one &gt;:)

*to those who fell for long con: you fell victim to one of the classic blunders!

Oh there are people who make excuses in every game, but it is accepted that they are a jerk. You start a round in Overwatch and your Mei locks your team in the spawn room? They are a jerk. Your teammate purposely feeding in League? They are a jerk, and you will definitely report them for it. Only in the siege community do people fight tooth and nail for the right for people to be jerks to their teammates because 'it is casual, so get over yourself'. It is ridiculous, and part of the toxicity of this game. You shouldn't be held hostage by teammates that have no intention of playing the game correctly, no matter what game you are playing. A 'casual' queue does not excuse that kind of behavior. 
---
Casual queue is to escape the pressures of needing to be well informed and skilled at the game, operators, and maps. Casual queue is not an escape from trying to actually play the game correctly. 
---
That isn't Purple-Man's ruleset, that is common sense. Personally, in whatever game, people with that kind of attitude, that subject teammates they don't know to griefing, I'm reporting them. Sorry to be a party pooper, get some friends and run a custom game.
---
That one costs 60$ right?
---
I expected that tbh, 3v5? Too outmatched
---
I just went 14-4, lost 5-3 and played down a man for the last 5 rounds and I lost 50 something MMR. Winning is the only thing that matters which I think is stupid.
---
Tbf these are also chibi

it's rook, which is more accurate. he has nothing to lose

Did you make this or did the guy that posted it a week ago make it?

Same it’s why I got into streaming siege. If you have enough time I’d recommend it.
---
No acog not interested
---
Don’t forget about clash
---
The game is so much more fun if you sprint to the obj with a shotgun
---
Clearly you don't know balance so don't talk about skill if you don't even know this
---
These lazy community managers, they should be making new operators and shit.
---
Even without the Damage reduction. This sounds very much like Call of Duty
---
r/suicidebywords
---
I almost bamboozled ya
---
Well yes but hey that’s kinda the reality for all high population games.
---
PCs are expensive and most people play on console. Sure you can have a better experience on PC but most of us can’t justify the cost thus limiting the amount of players on PC compared to PS4 and Xbox. I’ve seen diamond ranked ques taking over an hour on PC because the population isn’t as healthy.
---
Its probably not Ubis fault. Maybe someone was DDOSing
---
Map knowledge yes I suppose. Placement sure. But skill? Not really
---
I just get fucking annoyed with run outs and spawn peaks that's not how the game is meant to be played (looks at acogs taken from bandit and jager and only 1 speed defense ops given acogs)
---
It shouldnt not count as a loss, just you lose less elo and/or renown for losing and gain more for winning imo

Imagine believing shes not. Lol

The "Apagón" Blackout Grenade is a modified 9-Bang, subsituted with a frequency that is specifically tailored to attacks it's target's nerves in the eyes. When affected by the blackout grenade the victim will be rendered partially blind for 3 seconds. As the effects begin to fade away the screen of the player will fade in and out until it is completely gone, this lasts 4 seconds. The effect lasts for a total of 7 seconds and can mean the differnce between life and death for a rushing attacker.
---
Yup it's ass
---
yeah i know i was mostly just being sarcastic about ubisoft
---
Would have been nice to keep both and call the new one Hereford Air Field.
---
I use 70 horizontal and 35 vertical. But your ads should be your main focus. You do most of your shooting down sight. I prefer a low ads to make minute adjustments with more thump input movement with less repercussion

No they are knowledge you gain from exoring and experiencing. Skill is winning in a fair fight. Being able to insta kill someone who can't see you because you know where to stand doesn't
---
100% not his account.
---
Why would they care? They took their money.
---
Learn the layouts of each map and how they connect. That way you know where to go and how enemies will pop out. Start with T Hunt first.
---
Communicate with teammates and ask for feedback. If you don't understand, ask for clarification. Call out enemies you see and what direction they are coming from. Use the compass to help you. If you don't know the room name, describe it as best and quickly as you can. For example, "white stairs right side of the door" or " southwest second floor at the Thermite hole".
---
Learn how to use and position your drones. They are excellent for checking rooms.
---
If you get frustrated, just put the game down and take a break. Maybe 20 mins or a week. It all depends on you.

The commando is avg in every regard Except recoil, having more than most of the weapons in the game... The lmg is pretty good if you use it like jackals PDW, bc that high rof and easy recoil makes it a CQC nightmare

How quick would it be to detonate? Slow like candelas or faster like flash bangs?

The worst pain is starting a clutch from a 2v4 to a 1v4 but as soon as your team mate dies your ping goes to 1000 and you start glitching, stuck in one spot with a sledge in front of you that you would of killed if your router didn't have a mental spasm
---
Fetish?🤔

Oh yes, the typical Favela defensive strat.
---
My bad I’m a dumbo only saw one (new here (kinda))
---
It's even better when it's sheer luck. I now just shoot random windows around head level just for the chance of it.
---
Well, because they prefer Ranked to Casual. Like I said, Casual can be a shit show. Sometimes it's just easier to go into Ranked and fuck around with friends. I guess I've never cared much about the rank because I'm just a lowly pleb, but that's my two cents.
---
100% backed. sounds amazing.
---
Worst guns by category (my opinion, which is based mostly on damage per second and other factors).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Worst Assault/Battle Rifle -  Finka's Spear .308, outclassed by every other Assault/Battle rifle in regards to dps and is arguably the worst primary she has.
---
Worst DMR - Glaz's OTs-03, technically the worst DMR, but because of its uniqueness to the operator and his ability, it gets a pass.
---
Worst LMG - Ying's T-95 LSW, not a bad weapon, just the lowest dps LMG, although I would personally say IQ's LMG is worse because it is completely outclassed, but at least its DPS is decent.
---
Worst SMG - Caveira's M12, lowest DPS SMG in the game and is completely outclassed by the SPAS-15, easy choice here.
---
Worst Machine Pistol - Clash's SPSMG9, not a bad weapon by any means and acts more like a regular SMG, while the SMG-12 has insane recoil and the C75 auto cannot have a sight attached, their hard hitting capability just outclasses the SPSMG9.
---
Worst Shotgun - Echo/Hibana's Supernova, no contest here, even every secondary shotgun has higher DPS and more utility functions.
---
Worst Pistol - Ela/Zofia's RG15, there is not exactly a horrible pistol in this game, but this one has the lowest DPS out of all of them, however, the custom sight on the weapon is its saving grace and can lead to some crazy kills, and the green laser sight is a nice touch.
---
As someone who recently go into siege because of a friend playing the game, I cannot suggest this game enough rn, having a blast playing it
---
what? glaz is a one man army and can easily put pressure on a team by himself, he needs to be toned back some

Nice score

One might say, Caveira got... smashed.
---
Kinda sick
---
Observe the map in t hunt as well. Use drones to your advantage. Intelligence is key to winning.
---
ATTACK: Blackbeard,Buck,Jackal,Ying
---
Defence: Lesion,Echo,Caveira,Frost,Valkrie
---
Remember all ops are good if you know how to use them. This is my opinion and i think these are the best.

So, it’s not a tactical shooter that tries to emulate situations that swat or police force deal with.... ummmm then what is Bank? House? Chalet? Favela? Literally any map with cop cares and shit surrounding the place?

If it was a Raid, then I’d agree but more often then not the maps generally have a response theme more than a raid theme
---
Do you have suggestions on how to stop spawn peeking? I'm honestly blanking on any good ideas.

But you dont play with diamonds in ranked unless you are diamond so you should play ranked

They might add more . Lets wait and see

Out of curiosity, how would you suggest dissuading these?

What is cheating even good for? Every cheater claims they’ll never get caught and they always go down a week or two later. It ruins the game for others and only makes it fun for themselves and it’s not even true fun because they’re letting a program let them win instead of the satisfaction of attaining that victory with your own blood sweat and tears
---
Apart from thunt, outbreak, and the situations
---
Them dont play siege? It is trash behavior, you can’t change my mind
---
I'm sorry? This game is supposed to be pumping out stuff for like 10 years, so you have plenty of time to grind out those operators I suppose.

I am sorry to inform you, but you really shouldn’t be questioning someone’s intelligential status when you add “th0t” at the end of all your bullshit comments. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Oof, imagine being immature and trying to place the blame on someone who points out a flaw in ubisofts matchmaking system and toxic people who go to casual to shit on people who are just trying to relax, are you 12? You’re acting like it mate

---
Or she's [mad she doesn't have a claymore right now](https://youtu.be/sdlU8Lrm720)

Watch this shit get nerfed to where you can only melee it
---
In my Opinion the F2 is the best AR in the game right now. I feel like me and many other siege players would pick twitch over fuse if they were picking for gun. Sure the AK might statistically have the best DPS but situationally the F2 is the superior choice most of the time. As long as you pick your fights right the F2 will outgun the opponent just based on fire rate. The easily manageable recoil and pretty decent damage helps.
---
It could be a CPU bottleneck. I had i7 7700k and it would struggle at around 160+ frames so you could try locking the frames to 144 to see if it still happens. Also your CPU is underperforming on top of that. What CPU cooler do you have?
---
You also forgot the toxicity
---
This was me :)
---
So you'll eat a rechargeable battery if Ubisoft DOESN'T remove Favela from the game? Just checking if that was a typo or not.
---
Nah the game is dead for me, been dead since outback came in, they don’t fix the issues instead they nerf ops who don’t need it and just add bundles to buy
---
All these comments I was seeing earlier on my post lmao. Everyone has similar thoughts I can see.
---
That is just asinine in my opinion, but it goes to show you how toxic this community is, all the diamond and high plats are complaining because of some guy who wants to just enjoy the game has an issue with them coming to casual and being all kinds of extra and smacking people in regular matchmaking, no modesty whatsoever
---
Ad Mortem!!
---
Alright man, clearly you care way more about this than I do. It’s just a game to me. My rank has no real world value. It’s not like I’m paid in any way.
---
You do you.
---
Hm. Well, there are a few I thought of that tried to dissuade it rather than outright stop it. 
---
My first idea would be:
---
Reduce the amount of time till spotted by 0.5 seconds and have 2 seconds you’ll take DoT (Damage over Time) Damage (similar to how smoke gas canisters work) and I think the damage should at least be in the middle of about like 10 or 12 damage a second. Also, if the map is in the middle of the night, you’ll have a spot light shined on you and make it blinding (not majorly) almost similar to the red (or was it yellow?) screen that immediately popped up once you ran out.
---
That’s my first and only idea I’ve got atm.
---
No
---
I know but maybe rework them
---
He's got a big dick that's why
---
Its really funny because in the lore thatcher and lion hate eachother
---
There is blood on almost allmaps
---
I still have flashbacks of pre nerf Lion, it still haunts me
---
Jackal with his PDW9 will do you wonders
---
If you couldn't buy it in the store, it would bead black ice 24/7
---
and anyway I'd rather play on 5 good maps than a bunch of shit ones
---
I really want to see a 1 v 5 of mustardstab against multiple mustard variants.

Even now we most likely get a repeat map 3 or 4 matches into a session. Then we get bored, barely try and change game afterwards. Can't imagine playing a map pool that guarantees repeats.

The worst gun is the aa12 (Italian drum shotty) it was op untill the rpm nerf
---
Ghost squadron was called to service
---
Copper 4 is just Hell. Only the Doom Slayer could make it out in one piece. I certainly couldn't
---
It was Mustard, with a knife in the kitchen.
---
This game isn’t realistic lol look at what half the operators can do
---
Well dps is an **utterly useless** stat in siege. It's all about how quickly you can negate enemies, so TTK matters.
---
Regardless, for the most part, your classification is right. Ak12 might have a lower ttk on 1 armours against the legend sprayer famas, but still takes the top spot alongside the famas thanks to 3 shot consistency.
---
But as for shotgun, that will always be a controversial point. M870 is the hardest hitting and m590 is the most consistent, both having equal Destruction potential, and I'd even count the tcsg12 slugSMR as one and give that top spot. FO12 is the most lethal, so I doubt there's a clear winner there.
---
And yes, camrs is the best dmr thanks to it's consistency and spamability.
---
I wish it had the originally listed 700 (?) RPM frlm when it launched. Thing would be viable. Or give kt an angled IMO. Then could it compete with the viability of the 6P41.
---
Omg that’s sexy af
---
But I can control it...
---
I understand your point but normally for me at least the repeat map is a shit map never a good one im normally fine if I get coastline for the 2nd time one session but if I get Kafe for the  2nd time I do as you said
---
Well personally I actually played the "nerf" lion more, just feels more useful for pushes.
---
Sounds good. Can't wait to see it!

I agree and disagree cuz there are some dogshit maps such as Hereford, skyscraper, and fortress that have no place in the ranked rotation but I would really say at the moment the bigger issue is that there are too many maps in the ranked rotation (currently 14) and that could be fixed by removing the more gimmicky and less competitive maps like the ones mentioned above. Because of the number of maps though i still with about 1150 hours on the game and being in low plat end up still having no clue how to play some maps as its literally a 1/14 chance that i get some maps
---
Ranked is stressful and solo queuing as a diamond isn’t fun. When my 5 man isn’t on I play casual and play how I normally do so I get an alpha pack with black ice but commons have been more likely for me lately. The glitching, lag switching and crashing the server because someone on the enemy team is a sore loser is some of the issue of high ranks.
---
The reason for that is because they’re such a different game. Playing with a mouse vs playing with a controller changes the entirety of the game. A console diamond could be a pc silver and vis versa. I would be lucky to get a kill on console when something other than a shotgun while am referred to as the best playing in my friend group (not a flex. We all are hot garbage I’m just that new bag of garbage that hasn’t rotted yet)

Happened to me with overwatch. couldn't get any games with normal low level and uninformed players like myself. almost all stacks of low level accs together grinding qp to play ranked
---
This is amazing
---
Look into grabbing friends or friendly players to help you learn the ropes, r6s has a huge learning curve but that is part of the fun. r/R6STeams can hook you up with a squad of welcoming players. Make friends with friendly players you meet in matches. 
---
R6's has a toxic portion of players who would do anything to ruin the experience for newcomers. The game is great so don't let the toxic bunch drive you away.
---
I will explain everything about those 2 statements, especially this one and get you all of the proper information and research tomorrow morning. I'd love to do it right now because I'm actually enjoying this discussion... But unfortunetly I'm about to clock in at work and if I get caught with my phone out again my colossal cunt of a boss will break it and fire me like shes done to 3 other people this week. 😒

Tbh I never thought about ranked/KDR lmao I was just thinking about my unlocked skins and other cosmetic stuffs

Where are people who disconnect while being interrogated
---
Then later out of nowhere his friends and family get a text message that just says **"YOUR POSITION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED."**
---
I'm pretty sure my team was defending when this was taken, 😂 and the bandit who did this was slightly drunk
---
I’m a console player as well. Well done
---
I’ve got it too and I love it, I just wish I had some valk headgear/uniforms that it matched with

Well there’s a simpler answer for that one.

I’ve been doing that I guess my controller is broken or something but thanks for the help anyway

Googled it. It’s real
---
I like how Peter Dinklage is there
---
Thank you for the reply. :)
---
A lot of players spawn peek because they're not good at much else. So when you kill them you basically take the one thing away from them that they can do
---
Like Jäger but too many toxic people playing as him.
---
Okey. So you mean the peeking angles for example  and destructable walls is making it hard? I guess that's a great point.
---

Which one? The AR or the DMR?
---
Yeah, I’m not on PS4 so I don’t know if L3 was the same button as the Joystick. It might be different button entirely though, so if you look at the bottom right of your screen in a custom game lobby, you’ll also find some options there.

Wait what it’s not 1 opfor holy shit

Regarding your wallpaper engine edit, I don't know too much about wallpaper engine (if it uses cpu/ram in the background), but maybe try running siege with wallpaper engine disabled

Ah got it! Thought u want to blame the Game like other posts which say „pro League read“. I was confused ^^

will try doubt it will fix the issue because its fine when i play solo
---
Certain words are flagged offensive and will ban you, even though 15 days is huge
---
What makes you say that?
---
you misunderstood. my main point is that people almost always assume that mentioning cross-play means pc and consoles rather than between consoles and i think it does'n make sense especially in an fps game. i get that people would like to play with their friend, me too, i just don't understand the assuming part.
---
I know some are flagged but if i dont know a flagged word and i say it i will be banned
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
I wasn't the one who downed the guy, I wasn't gonna kill him. It was my teammate who got robbed in the situation. I could care less about k/d or w/l. I play for fun, my only goal is to get kills with hip fire.
---
I agree the limit should be increased for actual leavers but not for disconnects.
---
You can always restart the game.
---
At least Favela is fun for attacking. Tower on the other hand...
---
Clean!
---
Finally, time to smurf.
---
Pretty much how doc mains act on attack
---
That dude straight up dabs whenever you knife him
---
You were on beast mode!
---
Not not all the adapter cost quite abit so only people that care that much about being dicks buy it
---
6ix9nie will be happy if he sees this.
---
I know the hand supposed to be in that shape because of the way she use her ability but it seems like her fingers are missing and I cant unsee
---
Not all heroes wear capes, some carry a sledgehammer and are send by the lord himself
---
One recruit doesn't even need to be in game anymore and shouldn't be as they add nothing to the team. Two you could say the same thing about Ela, her gadget and secondary gadgets are shit and ppl only pick her for the guns. Oh wait even those are pretty shit especially the scorpion thinking it can shoot anything farther than 2ft away from you.  Oh wait i main Ela.
---
Yeah, his main issue is that he has the same UMP as pulse, and that is required to be a bad gun so pulse isn't broken.
---
As much as I agree with you, there's no way people won't smurf. Best we can do is warn our friends who are trying it and call out Smurfs when we see them. Doesn't solve the problem but it might at least let new players know they aren't supposed to be stomped this hard
---
"Fortissimo" is like "very strong" in italian is not German xD
---
Its reasonable and i completely agree with you, i didnt even thought about that posibility, but probably dickheads are gonna do it anyway
---
Echo: Imma end this woman’s eyes career
---
&gt; add baguette instead
---
Have you ever been hit with a 3-day old baguette?
---
Oh god
---
On one hand I feel like siege is a baptism by fire kind of game. Get past the smurfs, hackers, and toxic teammates then you can actually get good. But on the other hand, players should be able to play in a pure state of the game to see if they like it or not.
---
Let me just get a clarification here.
---
If somebody has a new account, he can still play casual, right? It's not like he's restricted to newcommer as the only game mode, right?
---
I think this was first suggested on about the second day of the season....
---
I have only one strat that is kinda fool proof (skyscraper office) you lock down lobby to remove window line of sight and bamboo door and it usually works pretty well.
---
Yeah that's not gonna happen, it's open season in newcomer this weekend.
---
If only, you'll always get the toxic assholes tho
---
People who smurf are paying for an extra copy...of course they are going to want extra on their investments. I disagree with it, like it ruins the new players experience
---
I like how all the people that went from heli past the cam didn’t shoot it out.
---
Yeah it was a ranked game as well
---
Yup. In my head . "Oh I'll block a random area so if they spawn that side it slows them down."
---
And then theres my roamer.....
---
Sorry if I'm mistaken but they removed Recruit from ranked these mf, didn't they (F)?
---
Sure, but there are little "gaps" between the knifes
---

---
This looks good
---
&gt;It's been 2 days since Season Pass owners were supposed to get the new ops.
---
No, it hasn't. You get them on release.
---
True. My take on this fact would be: If you want to smurf, do it in casual but not in the newcomer playlist.
---
Whenever I’m on a 4K my friends seek out the kill steal
---
r/yourgay
---
No. The operation will come out on the 11th. The season pass owners will then have that week until the 18th to play them. Then on the 18th everyone else can buy and play them along with the season pass owners.
---
I love the MPX. I'm not a fan of the kick from Deagle.
---
Oh. Well I don't have any friends (that play the game) so that's not really a prob for me. Feel sorry for you.
---
No problem, getting 20 drones is easily done.
---
Thank you my man, hope you keep making new content and you will be amazed of your own improvement. I started out with pretty shitty photo edits and looking back I'm amazed how much I've improved
---
You can’t get ops before they’re released lol
---
You’ll get them when Phantom Sight is released, and non season pass owners won’t be able to purchase them
---
Hahahahaha
---
But I have the season pass. It guarantees you get access to the new ops 7 days early.
---
We can at least try to get the reddit community to agree on not doing it. It kinda worked with the "no spoiler" policy for Endgame on 9gag! :)
---
Well was a good idea since your team is lacking hard breachers unless mav is gonna spend to canisters to open it lol.
---
This put a smile on my face &lt;3
---
Hey!! Some of us can read! (Not all the words, just the small ones)
---
Season pass owners get them on release. Everyone else a week later.
---
Oh ok. Sorry I didn't know this was the case.
---
Not this weekend, though. That's my point. People will get new accounts for free and will smurf like hell, but I would wish they wouldn't dip into the newcomer playlist.  
---
Yeah, they’d need to do that and then change the cool down to start at 30-60 minutes before joining again. Some people would take the 15 minutes to avoid the loss for the team
---
At least you got the cam...
---
Definitely not. You should always be aiming for the head In siege. This gun has a great fire rate and low recoil. Makes it an excellent weapon.
---
Mavericks a 2 speed
---
The season isn’t even live. How are you supposed to play them if they aren’t live
---
Sick
---
Only if search bar was useful
---
PC and console guns are balanced differntly, just btw.

This is reddit not 9gag and this is a game not a movie spoiler.
---
Roomer
---
I saw your post on r/airsoft . Hello fellow airsofter!!
---
I obviously know what it's for. What I'm wondering is why is it a part of the Home Screen, with it be along the E3 reveals, with a date set?
---
Controller
---
So gift some of the best players in the game a garbage skin?
---
wholesome
---
Stop using the UMP, it's shotgun time like a real n word 😎
---
I wouldn’t go down the route of adding handling nerfs, as that won’t solve any of the frustrations which is all down to sound. 
---
The sound surely has to be tweaked, but to what extent. Maybe make it so that they both walking and crouch walking have the same sound cues, but each provide different advantages and disadvantages. 
---
Maybe crouch walking could be a little faster, but worse handling and the opposite for walking. Just some quick thoughts but you get what I mean
---
Well they use characters together, like there is a thermite or hibana then Thatcher or twitch. Also most castles don't know which door to castle up or they castle the same door/window every time
---
We did it boys. We got rid of kicks
---
Agree
---
Definitely. He is vital for Skyscraper work office and Clubhouse bedroom. Useful for Border vents.
---
I really think it's interesting that it seems like people either have a really bad time in Siege or not at all. I almost never have problems with toxicity in solo queue and I am playing in that rank area, too.
---
Ah the trolls

Just him standing by the doorway, flashing anyone who goes near him. (On attack. That was my tk)
---
glad you noticed :)
---
This means I already tried it way before making this post
---
I agree Fuze should be a 2 speed, there's nothing inherent about cluster charges that necessitates being a 1 speed. As far as Russians that haven't gotten fat from vodka, there is Glaz and Kapkan, who are both 2 speeds.
---
He is good but annoying
---
u/nwordcountbot u/r4g3_qu1t3r
---
it only costs 100k thats not much
---
Lol. Last ranked game for me this season...
---
It might be you but jackals pretty good his AR makes a funny noise
---
Teamwork... all 5 players know where the castle walls will be before they are even placed. On another note though  I have seen castle walls hurt the defenders in pro league from time to time.
---
That's really good!
---
So get this, how many flashes does he have at a time?
---
Did you pay ?
---
In order to complete *Caviera charm challenge*, you must have been sneaky about it. Where you sneaky?
---
It does sound a little different than the other ones
---
Gridlock has been dedicated to fixing that bike. She has worked day and night to try and get it just right, while mozzie stands there, pullijg fakes guns on her. The last day of burnt horizon should be gridlock driving away from an angry horde 2D kangaroos while mozzie is left to defend his precious vegemite from the tyrannical kamgaroo overlords. Just my opinion tho.
---
In my opinion, the game is less toxic than the ones you mentioned because it’s not free. Even though the standard edition is only 20 bucks now it still costs something. League is the most toxic form of entertainment I have ever played in my life of playing video games. Sure Siege has its moments were it resembles league and matches where the same things happen, but I can consistently get a good game of siege without being endlessly mocked, cursed, and slurred at for every mistake I make.  I can’t get that with League and I think that’s partially due to the low stakes when one decides to play League. If you get banned, oh well just make another account and go at it again.
---
Its blatant sarcasm, I did the exact same thing when it happened to me and friends, but its alot harder now with the removal of point whoring (continuously scanning to get ludicrous amount of points).
---
They should make it a skin for every weapon similar to black ice
---
Imagine that glitch with monty fully extended
---
Can straight hear it bounce lol
---
But those are some weak ass springs for that truck
---
I'm going to have to disagree with you there.  Personally I really like new Hereford and think it is a fun map to play on.  Sure on some parts of the map you have to navigate but it's really not that hard.
---
yeah me lol i understand why now
---
mouse-sensitivity.com is great, I can't remember if Siege or CS:GO are premium or not though
---
I was joking. Bunch of spazzes lol
---
Might have to wait for an Ela player to answer that, since I never use her, sorry. Testing the recoil pattern for smg11 in custom match should provide you with answer though.
---
So basically TTS ranked (next season's ranked) without influencing your MMR.
---
Give me the god damn ESL mappool (+new season map) already FFS.
---
I main thermite and I got this a few months back. Honestly one of the nicest black ices overall, IMO.
---
“apparently”
---
I probably can just look it up. Thanks again
---
No Rooks are fine. However, you’d be surprised how many people pick thermite and hibana and don’t do anything. Even when it’s very obvious which wall needs to be open like on garages.
---
the map-pool is still the same so it's not quite ESL
---
Mute has the best gun skins and a good animation. Pulse has good gun skins but everyone hates his elite.
---
It is ranked without ranks and its great
---
What is in challenges?
---
You know that’s how people are gonna be, I just hope the best for anyone starting out because this game is amazing. Wouldn’t have another game to be playing this much ever in my life
---
Elon musk is also African lol but she just looks mediterrean in game and in the art.
---
But it shouldn’t matter right? The art op posted is pretty dope
---
Smurfing is making a new account to purposely play against low levels and just shitting on them
---
But I wanna see Gridlocks thicc thighs
---
And Mozzie doing his adorable lil finger gun
---
This gun has a lot of really cool skins. I can never decide which to use.
---
What about Hibana? How does she look?
---
50* but i mean hopefully they won’t make new accounts
---
Its gonna the new ranked system for next season. 3 round defend and then, 3 round attack. The team that wins 4 rounds first, wins.
---
Same map-pool as currently in ranked, BUT:
---
Bomb-only, 3attacks/3defense rounds in a row, pick&amp;ban.
---
Basically the same as on the TTS currently
---
elon musk is south african of dutch descent of course he’s white
---
alibi is libyan with an unclear family heritage and inconsistent art to boot, but she is portrayed as darker skinned in game
---
and yeah the art is good but you did ask why it mattered if alibi was dark skinned or not
---
Because the new operation is not yet live. This one is just for the new ranked system.
---
Does it make a difference to your rank or is it only casual?
---
Ive convinced 2 of my friends to get it and they’re having a blast, 1 other friend however is very skeptical about siege and we’ve convinced him to try it this weekend but if he gets shat on by smurfs he probably won’t end up buying it. It’s a shame because I know he would genuinely enjoy it once he figures it out.
---
nice cat!
---
Frost
---
BEAUTIFUL SCREEN
---
Elaborate
---
I think she has one of the coolest logos, but I hate playing her. I hate horizontal recoil.
---
Nothing yet... They'll likely add stuff tomorrow
---
It only happens to me on the menu screen with the two operators faffing about.
---
Yup I guess so
---
OK I will consider that
---
Xbox player, can disagree everyone plays with mouse and keyboard so it would make no difference
---
When it's already a minute after the preparation phase and you're starting at the 1 plate some roaming dink didn't pick up
---
Same here, but with buck.
---
Aah, the coincidence.
---
Doesn't he also have a low winrate? Or maybe he used to at least.
---
Here's to hoping......
---
.......
---
agreed
---
Uhhhhhhhhh
---
Her elite looks good and skins are quality. Her gadget is cool but her animation is lacking. She just fires a bow all elegant and stuff
---
It's fucked when neither a thatcher, twitch or even a maverick don't try to get rid of jammers and batteries
---
Ok, so how much do those cost
---
It is how ranked will be next season--so the same rules as Road to SI except map pool (the 14 map ranked pool instead of the 7 map PL pool that was used for road to SI).
---

---
It's good, it gives you time to adjust and chsnge your strat. Been playing it on scrims since it started and honestly it just makes way more sense
---
People slam servers on PC too, as for MnK, yes it exists but from my experience it exists more in Plat1-Diamond which 99% of this sub is nowhere near on console. And even when you do run into it, it isnt *that* frequent
---
Trust me, once you get used to Bomb, Secure Area will look barely better than Hostage

K. Long as it doesn't get sexual I'm chill. I've heard I should get deluxe too, what does gold have that it doesn't?

---
Im talking about the limited time event
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but the shading seemed somehow better than now
---
New challenges will probably appear within the next 12 hours. The challenges appeared later than the Road to S.I. playlist when that event first launched.
---
i think the sale starts at the end of the weekend
---
It does not effect your rank.  I'm not sure if it uses and effects your (hidden) casual MMR or it is separate.
---
I would probably give it a day to settle in
---
Tbh It's A Good idea but I think that it should be footprints instead of smoke trail. I think smoke as: It's inconsistent, it would cover the screen which wouldn't help anyone, Its just a bit broken.

I think footprints would be better as It would be easy to implement, there would also be and easy to implement timer with footprint colour.
---
Thanks! I guess I’ve never been on this soon after a new playlist launch. Wasn’t sure if it was a bug or a misleading button
---
RIP Siege. I bought this game because watching the video of a team rescuing a hostage on House. Now neither house or hostage are in the game. We were promised more game modes, but now only.have 1. Just make a new game instead of slapping the original players in the face
---
€40 per season
---
No, it does not.
---
is this live?
---
Are those per year then
---
Ok, I don't get what that "for now" part. lol Are they going to tally it up at the end of the season for you? Also, last time I played Apex it didn't tally overall wins and losses so not sure why they implemented that unless it effects the Apex Elite queue.
---
They're trying features to bring to ranked. Ranked desperately needs a vote to kick feature
---
Those are all decent maps. I remember getting favela or yacht in ranked and that was a nightmare.
---
My siege suddenly switched to this background after a restart and updated with this playlist without an actual downloadable update of any kind; did any of you get an actual update?
---
He meleed your shoulder
---
nope, it counts as a loss for your mmr but not your stats. so he plays coppers to farm easy wins and kd, then leaves if hes about to lose
---
Oh yes indeed €40 per year. One year is 4 seasons
---
PS4 already  has crossplay with PC it’s called diamond rank bomb. 
---
I would love if they added crossplay and the diamond MnK shitcans would get thrown in plat because in comparison to diamond PC players they suck ass
---
Oh yeah
---
Tbh I kinda forgot he had another primary 😂
---
I’ll fix it
---
Wow
---
the post we needed but dont deserve
---
Even so, it's a shitstorm on both sides.
---
Your use of the word "but" and "cause" are incorrect. Sorry but i had to say it, this sentence is so poorly constructed. You use the word "but" when whatever follows is seemingly contradictory. Example, "it was very hard *but* i still finished strong." And you said "cause" totally pointless. It didn't take you so long *because* it kept getting tedious, it took you so long *and* it was tedious.
---
"I suffered a lot because it kept getting so tedious and it took me so long to do them." That is the sentence you were looking for.
---
Go ahead and downvote me now, i said my piece.

supprised tho because his profile says he does go4s. would of thought he’d be better than that
---
the thing is that matchmaking and ranks are based on percentages of the playerbase so even if you can opt out of playing cross plattform yourself, all the mmr stuff gets distorted resulting in worse matchmaking and thus not an improvement but the opposite :)
---
Truly miss the days when Heartbeat sensor was in the class above all others 😞
---
Why there won't be other modes in ranked? Secure the area was a lot fun :(
---
Exactly the kind of idiotic comment you'd expect from a Man-child who visits meme posts on this sub.
---
Maybe there could be cross play between all for casual and different types of game modes (like event game modes) but only cross play between consoles for ranked and pc stays alone
---
Thats the coolest thing

So a weaker lesion?

Ubi should actually make short cinematics for the community. Like a short clip of ash saying that she doesn’t need an acog to win. Etc

Just to be clear, it's a free weekend. After the weekend is over that means your access is revoked and you need to buy it. All in-game xp and in game currency you collect will carry over.

The sale should last a few more days after the weekend is over.

I mean seriously: [this](https://i.gyazo.com/b94386b1ef679f544ead5031673f6602.png) shouldn't happen
---
I honestly think its fine the way it is. I believe its running off a group total MMR. My group of Plat 3's, Gold 1 and a Plat 2 played a group of Plat 2's and a Diamond and we beat them. I also play in a group where the ranks vary a lot  but we still have mostly balanced games (sometimes you just get beat).
---
I’ll probably start seeing them all the time now
---
That’s a very specific situation that for me doesn’t happen very often
---
He's meant to be annoying (Like lesion) for trying to replace your self to attack and a rush/plant denial.

god please help

Technical test server if if I'm not mistaken. They changed it to just test sever (TS) but I don't like how short it is to say. 
---
It's pretty much just a two or three week period before a new season with a live version of the next season where PC players can play the full season to find any bugs.
---
All right I except that.

Thanks. Appreciate it!

Is this sarcasm? Cause it’s bad
---
I guess my next question is what recruit loadouts you take for both Attack and Defend. Curious because lots of attackers have tons of utility plus a gadget and extra reinforcement. Also what do you do if your team were to need a Thatcher, Thermite etc
---

Also if you are curious about ela I believe you can go into the test server and test her out since all ops are unlocked

Pro tip: Main Blitz
---
ZA WARUDO! STOP TIME!
---
Oh now you're f**ked!

I have the Blitz tag because He is the funniest operator to play for me. Blitz is not even in the top 10 most played.
---
Alright I think i will go test it.
---
What tracker is that? I've never seen that one before.
---
*Shots fired: 0*
---
And at that moment a thermite main was born.

Horrible matchmaking, 9/10 join in process. Disappointing.

The one from ubi themselves

Rainbow6.ubi.com

Its a classic club challenge thats why i got there
---
Lvl 133 and not a single black ice
---
I find that the most pointless button. For ranked, that is.
---
If one can't take a decision **in ranked**, then they shouldn't be playing it.
---
Imagine knowing what F12 does.
---
I'm in this picture and i don't like it
---
They are professional counter terrorists,if ash,jäger,bandit and such were real they wouldn't give a fuck about not having an acog.
---
How can you use ora ora? You are Dio!
---
Shit I do it all the time... Theres also a window you can peek around the same area to kill a thermite

Thanks!

Nice repost, this was literally posted 15 minutes prior to your posting -.-

Lies! Deception!
---
No, the files were already in your game files and they just toggled it on serverside. No update needed.
---
To be honest, i don't think Ubi cares about console players too much. Why don't we have hipfire lean yet? maybe double tap the sticks?
---
Don't need to explain anything. Get a tattoo of an oreo for all anyone cares. Looks cool to me.

It's sought after because you could buy it back in siege's first dlc season, but since then you can only get it from alpha packs
---
Shoot his knife and he becomes even more cute
---
He does
---
Depends on the objective and map. If you plan on busting out ceilings or floors it’s easier to shoot them with a wide range of view vs zoomed in. If you’re not doing as much vertical breaching, the acog will usually be better.
---
My reply was about IQ, not Bandit, so don't try getting smart with me
---
I wish I had that. IQ has been my main as of late because of how amazing that gun is. I'm surprised it doesn't get used more often- it's like hibana's gun except with a bigger mag. The ADS is a bit slow but it just shreds.
---
June 11 for season pass owners
---
Would pay 50 bucks for it on mp7
---
True, it's hard to attack on theme park, so glad it's getting a rework
---
Back then, this was gold level of play. Things were different, very different
---
And i'll happily tell you - Because lacking a gadget =/= lacking utility. The lack of a wall \*is\* a deficit to the team, one that I really don't understand as there are some defenders who honestly bring way more to the table than even the other operators and \*should\* have this penalty.   
---
Otherwise in personal belief I do think the community suffers from "Unique Operator Syndrome" - Where because recruit is not unique (...Which is in fact a unique trait) that people are blinded by what he \*can\* bring to the table. Otherwise I do honestly believe it just might be the difference in people, as I would gladly like to talk out the pros/cons and debate it out - Or even play a couple matches with ya.
---
What's the disadvantage of Lesion?
---
b i g  y e e t
---
He’s not as strong in bomb as he is on hostage or secure. There’s much more room to cover. I’ll agree with you though that it’s over saturated.
---
Yeah he's pretty underpowered right now
---
same here, I believe playing as a stack has so much advantage over soloQ ..my friends only 5 stack and they never been below plat 2 ..but only advantage for me playing with him is facing better players as you said
---
Very nicely done, love the effort on some of the seasonal skins.
---
I’ve seen diamond footage from Y1S1 that looks like silvers nowadays
---
Do you run a 5 man? If not then doing dumb stuff like that could be looked at as toxic because you're hurting your team by not even trying.
---
Oh shit you right. It's an actual 'no u'
---
I agree I think they’re balanced I just have a personal preference for the defenders guns, if given the chance I’d probably use lesions smg and the mp5 even on attackers
---
Amen.
---
Haha yeah I have it on the pistol too so I run the same kit but I use the disgusting pro league uni with the big gold eyes. It's actually a great pistol they wasted it on SAS, wish it went to GSG9 or GIGN.
---
#CLIENT SIDE AHHHH
---
Under that age are allowed to play the game though. It's only that they aren't allowed to purchase it. I mean, Siege is just about as tame as M or 18's go. It should probably be a 16. I mean, I probably wouldn't let a 6 year old play it, but 12? Sure!
---
I expected these answers. For a group - that's basically impossible. I live in Finland, which means there is nobody in my timezone capable of laughing, and much less of carrying a new player. Second - I don't expect to get good after 40 hours. Not at all. I expected, however NOT to be put against people who are like you - level 100 and up. Which I am.
---
EVERY.
---
FUCKING.
---
TIME.
---
There's simply no opportunity to get better. I mean I don't even have time to learn where the cameras are before I am killed.
---
I think it's pretty good, I settle in a rank a couple weeks into the season and if its below my skill I'll rise up slowly but still be facing similar skill levels and if its above my level I'll quickly drop. 
---
Having higher gains defeats the purpose of the whole thing becuase no one would even settle in their skill level. You're meant to be stuck in plat or you're meant to be stuck in diamond, you shouldn't change rank every few games, makes no sense.
---
Got accused of cheating here
---
It’s a perspective glitch
---
Aye, like 2 years ago... bit late now. I've managed to unlock about 10 pistol black ice skins... that's all my black ice.
---
Lesion? OP? After the gun and mine damage nerf?
---
That's gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
How the hell will the developers make it "instantly bannable"? As a smurf, you are registering your account using a completely different email account. 
---
I understand your intent and your frustration, but from a technology perspective, this sounds like an incredibly complicated problem to solve. (Source: I am a PM at a tech company).
---
Siege has always required PS+ for me, must of been some kind of glitch for you to get away with it or something.
---
Weird.
---
Time.
---
If the attackers rush at round start, youve got maybe 3 traps set up and probably dont have the best angle
---
I’ve always struggled with it personally, what attachments do you run?
---
On the contrary, I think I'll add some text that explain how a good team composition works, and the emphasis on having roles within the team. Many new players just go for comfort pick (which is fine) but then dont understand why they lost.
---
his effectiveness is insane, especially in competitive play. 3 traps before round starts place them in buffer rooms near obj. put another 3 in obj as anchor. Whole point of it is that his traps offer too much. I just think that his traps do too many things. They are over saturated with effects.
---
Grey text on a grey background makes this difficult to read. I like your approach though.
---
Never spawn Vally on border. If they're fast enough they can see your whole team when you spawn in for the second it takes you to get down the hill out the line of site. Most people aren't but those that are can kill 1-3 people or at least down them.
---
Even those that aren't can still get you between the gate and the acp or after. Theres plenty if spots they can do it from too on the second floor
---
Cuz then I'm gunna suspend the game to do it...
---
Okey. Guess I'm lucky I have got a lot of them. But I like to have "realistic" skins so I run with the silver/platinum skin on like 90% of my guns and then Damascus Steel on the older weapons.
---
No way man, the game has been growing constantly since release in 2015, obviously the only logical step for Ubi to take is to fundamentally change the main game mode.  People clearly like playing it, so it has to completely change.  /s
---
I don't get it, I'm not in the pro league, I love ranked the way it is and I have been playing it pretty religiously since the beta.  If people want to play like they're in pro league, why can't it just be in GameBattles or ESL?
---
Very pretty but don't really see how these help giving how a lot of ops are classified a bit weird.
---
How is Lion anti-roam nowadays? He gives a few short bursts of info about the whereabouts of some enemies.
---
Currently playing without PS+ and no problems, don't know what to tell you.
---
This is awful. If people want to play ranked secure area they should be able to. If they enjoy it its their choice. Personally I know me and the group of 15 or so people I play with wont be playing once this change happens along with countless others Ive spoken too. It seems a majority of players dont enjoy bomb or hostage, so if ubisoft wants to drive away half or more of their dedicated playerbase its their choice.
---
Theyre pulling a Destiny 2.
---
One other quality is their gadget subset allows them to forego a tactical utility for something like a frag or nitro cell. It isn't much, and highly depends on how much you use the operator's tactical, but it is a trade-off.
---
Have you tried being Japanese?
---
A E S T H E T I C
---
B E G I N N E R S
---
His traps, while super useful, are electronics and can be destroyed by Thatcher, Twitch or IQ. Thinking about it, he is indeed Utility Denial since you can't plant the defuser with a Gu in your leg. But overall he's a high-tier character.
---
Lesion is not the best defender in the game.
---
I would, but “User profile failed to load” hates me. I haven’t played since the middle of Wind Bastion :(
---
It'll be just as easy for the other team when the side switch happens. It's really fair tbh.
---
Please dont make this one time event. I love casual playlists like these.
---
The optical attachments are not as good, and the range is not as good either.
---
It sounded like a bunch of people who swallowed helium and kept yelling and kicked me before I could clutch
---
Alright thanks for explaining.
---
Sure why not. It's a skill cannon so I'd be okay with it being able to snipe people.
---
If you have the season pass i think
---
Nope, bomb sucks and to win it still requires actual skill.
---
#LMAO
---
I don't know about the you guys on PC but on console the Deagle is not fun to use at all.. if your target is about 15 meters away from you, landing 2 shots is a miracle
---
All the fucking time
---
That’s also ridiculous. That weapon is fucking amazing. Zero recoil, good damage, good fire rate. The only downside to it is that it’s only on Kapkan and Lord. Should be at the very least C tier, if not B.
---
Yeah, me too
---
I also wonder if my spraying was a reason for the bug, like maybe i destroyed it in the same frame as the breach charge and game got branfarts or something.
---
No PC only
---
You can buy one of them still, for Frosts Shotgun
---
Blitz is fine as is.
---
Lies
---
Do you not play often?
---
I just thought that these looked really professional for just concepts
---
But that is one of its main drawbacks, it is on two operators that are not picked often.
---
Give me a valid reason why bomb sucks. I'll happily listen to you.
---
so that pisses me off a little
---
My teammates in general
---
You either don’t play a lot or you lose/abandon matches a lot haha
---
Lol HP
---
Oh don't worry.
---
It pisses everyone off
---
Played when beta came out and off and on since then been playing a lot more lately
---
Range isn’t all that important, most fire fights occur within 15 meters anyway, well within the range of little, if any, drop off.
---
When you compare Lesion to other trap operators, then he seems overpowered, but if you compare him to other top tier defending operators he doesn't seem game breaking. Operators like Echo, Valkyrie, Maestro, and Mira are also picked/banned extremely often in pro league and are on a similar level of power if not beyond. Mira has the simplest gadget if the bunch, but it's completely game changing. Maestro of all of them seems the most similar to Lesion by the amount of stuff your gadget can do: evil eyes can be placed in so many different spots and are bulletproof, they can open up and shoot people, deny hard breach, destroy drones, provide intel, etc.. Lesion is stronk af, but there are other ops on a similar power level.
---
Very impressive
---
I was today years old when I found out there was a FiVe-SeVeN black ice...
---
I got out like 2 weeks ago
---
Skyscraper is shit as well, now that you mention it. 
---
If you ask me, ranked map pool should be:
---
-Bank
---
-Border
---
-Consulate
---
-Coastline
---
-Club House
---
-Kafe (reworked)
---
-Outback
---
-Oregon
---
-Villa
---
Sorry, I don't know any priests that play Rainbow 6. Good luck though!
---
great,now intentionally downranked diamonds can now choose to ban ops against their mains.
---
Weird
---
Somehow I feel like a lot of ppl think they need to play the op.  Just read it lol
---
I'm like lvl 108 and I only have black ice for GSH-18
---
No i didnt.  The mods deleted it because calling you a cunt was against sub rules.
---
There is one difference though. They have bad maps in this playlist. They took the bad maps out of the Road to SI playlist.
---
Depends on what situation you are in, nobody would want to attempt a runout with the VSN, but runouts with the K1A are viable because of its range and the fact it is on a 1 speed operator.
---
You're not wrong, but I was playing FPS games at his age. Fuck I played Drakengard when I wasn't much older.
---
Still doesn't make it right, I guess.
---
I think the worst part about any rank is just getting out of it. I always had troubke getting out if gold, and I was stuck for like 2 or 3 seasons. I played 1 season with a friend, and boom, hit plat 3 that season ans have been mid plat ever since.
---
Sorry for some errors, my keaboard Is in Italian so It modifies a lot of things I write.
---
Wait, so this new update is the one where Ranked becomes garbage and only goes to bomb right? Guess I'll be going to casual for secure then
---
new ops with all the ass weapons
---
No, every attacker WILL outgun you, attackers guns are mostly supposed to have higher damage than the defenders
---
I'd have to agree with you! I think between the eyes and the background claws its the strongest out of the three
---
Well then observe the enemy and see what they do that way you can learn to counter various strategies and techniques. You're not gonna get better by playing against Coppers.
---
Are coming changes on matchmaking too?
---
Not the best, but definitely high-tier.
---
It sucks because some people aren't as good as other people are in the game and having 2 objectives often separated is hard to defend. I mean, pretty much the entire community hates bomb.
---
It’s all in the “DETAILS!”
---
I live in brasil
---
25R$ for 1 month is a shit
---
"Joining game in progress" playlist
---
Ftfy
---
Ah makes sense. Cheers
---
I don’t get why so many people have a fear of blitz, especially now that his flash ability has such a long cool down. If you can aim decently you can hit arms or legs.
---
I guess it’s more difficult on console, but still I managed to get my fair share of blitz kills on PS4.
---
So is there a bigger, higher contrast version? Even overzoomed this is hard to read.
---
Wtf i never need ps plus to play
---
Gib german ops pls ;_;
---
Tachanka should have all those in max.
---
Ubi better nerf them before the next season or someone's gonna find a way to harness the power
---
As someone who didn't play ranked beforehand, I actually kinda enjoy it despite losing. Feels more casual and not as long with the 3 attack / 3 defend rounds each
---
The game is free but it’s still an online multiplayer game, plus is required to play online games.
---
Right, but the difference between the fire rates weapons completely overshadow the UMP45. That was the main reason the UMP45 is so low, because the fire rate is one of the game's worst.
---
That lightning in the beginning is giving me flashbacks...
---
Don’t forget if you attack first in overtime and thatcher is banned you’re fucked on some sites. 
---
Against a good team Oregon basement with mirrors/kaid/mute is impossible to open
---
NO WAY ! I though you die then you have 15 health
---
The issue comes from those "gamers" who play fortnight, bitching about cross play on the god forsaken game. 
---
Cross play should only be implement between consoles in shooters, 
---
Racing games, sports games, that's fine by my book.
---
"kill 100 players in one game"
---
I know i need plus to play online but i never need plus to play
---
The changes seem pretty polarizing - a lot of people voicing love/hate. Ubi should have some sort of poll/survey to determine what ranked the people want OR just have 2 Queues in game and see what more people prefer playing (Current ranked style vs Pro League style). 
---
I personally don't think i'm going to like the added time of Pick/Ban at start and not having operators I enjoy playing (RIP Echo forever) consistently banned out.
---
Nice. I didn't know that, had the situation with both guys killing each other often but never with infinite overtime
---
Seriously, you can't even see the mouse move and he's doing 180s.
---
No problem, best of luck
---
As far as ive seen watching streamer on tts, there is no new map. Just reworked kafe and its the same map pool.
---
That's cuz a bunch of plats/ diamonds have 2nd accounts that they go to play against bronze people on... The amount of smurf accounts is very high. As well as the hackers on PC.
---
T hunt is different from pvp :)
---
Still disabled sadly
---
[It shows ps plus is required for me.](https://i.imgur.com/7DyTeVL.png)

Will this count as your provisional games?
---
Ricardo is literally god
---
The next operator will be called 'Artie' Just wait..😎
---
But I just played an online game, how am I not connected?
---
Oh no, the competitive playlist now only contains the competitive game mode. What a disaster
---
Love the skins and depth put into this. Great job buddy!
---
normal live servers all platforms
---
Nah
---
No more Grid fixing motorcycle on my main menu screen.  THANK FUCKING GOD!
---
What I’m saying is, if people want to play ranked but stick to secure who is it hurting? What’s the big deal if friends just wanna get together, play ranked but not bomb?
---
no thats on around the 11th
---
The amount of stupid bans I’ve came across today was unreal...
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Its on the Live normal servers, Its the old map with the existing operators. Only difference is the rank settings
---
.... 6-9
---
He will only be able to use his gadget twice to make sure it is not overpowered.
---
Its seafood preparing for revenge
---
Yeah. Its the County that im in
---
Thermite just blew out a hole and starts mincing through it. Need a camp outfit to match
---
What? 1. the first sentence doesn't really make sense, if you're good, you're good regardless of the gamemode you play 2. If you ever played Bomb, you would know that i would say 95% of bombsites are defender-sided, example (the basement of Oregon, just slap a fucking Mira in there and you win). 3. 99% of people i know play Bomb, actually, it has been a while since i have ever been with a person that plays secure or hostage, let alone hate Bomb itself. That's why ubisoft made ranked bomb-only, because that's what the most majority of players play and like, most secure or hostage players play this game casually, and don't care much about rank or KD or anything of that matter. You can still play casual and enjoy the game like you always did.
---
And on that day, a new gamer was born 
---
Welcome little man
---
Except the legs are unreliable. Blitz is a menace, but he's extremely unreliable. He's either bullshit for or against you, and that's just not a good base for an operator.
---
Lol. Half or more. Overestimate much? Its more like half or more don't really give a shit what they play including bomb.
---
Ah yes, nothing like being blinded and then murdered with absolutely 0 way to counter him :)
---
Dude. No one likes bomb. It's ALOT harder to defend then hostage or secure area, i think hostage would be much better and more realistic instead of bomb
---
Unfortunately it seems they’re not. 
---
Shame that we’re so close to having a playable ranked.
---
to be honest, i'd rather have new guns. just imagine Nokk with an F2000 and Warden with a Galil ACE carbine. 
---
of course if they are worried about balance they can just copy stats of weaker existing guns.
---
Xbox to ps4 would be amazing and you know people would play it if this was the case
---
what do you mean?
---
&gt;pretty much the entire community hates bomb.
---
I'll take things "you just made up" for $500, alex. As far as ranked matches are concerned im pretty sure bomb is far and away the most popular
---
The laziness is rife in Ubisoft
---
Yeah it's the same as my username, Chargold12
---
Especially for a kid. My daughter is 5 and has trouble with the sensitivity on my mouse at 1200dpi playing hearthstone with me.
---
I hope Ubi mimics this idea ;)
---
I hate morning thunder. Fuck shields lol
---
“YOU’RE NEXT DESGRACADOS!”
---
Um, okay, i haven't met anyone who likes bomb, except for maybe you and that other guy. You have a point or just wasting my time?
---
And make ranked a snoozefest, no thanks.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I bought the game four days ago and there’s already a free weekend?!
---
There's no difference. Steam
---
gonna be honest with u chief this list is kinda wrong unless its your own opnion ( wich is totally cool) this list does not compare to the meta
---
Many reasons
---
Avoid win 10 1803 and 1809.
---
I thought Ranked was finally not in beta last patch? I am probably wrong tho.
---
Such as?
---
I love casual

Those are some awesome ideas. Sopros is the only thing I wouldn't want from this, sounds like his ability is like the "Second Chance" perk from CoD Black Ops and I hated that. The rest sounds amazing though. Great job!
---
Many within the 300 comments
---
If you were losing 3 rounds as one side, you were destined to get stomped anyway.

jesus give this man a medal
---
The  Bearing9 , smg secondary.

Btw he plays on a 2014 laptop that he got for 200$ it sucks

---
Get outta here with that logic!!!!!
---
Because it'll piss off your teammates if you dont actually try your hardest to be a team player if you're not a new player but have access to the operators.
---
Ahh...Icic...okie will take note XD
---
Mini map maybe? Idk
---
It's an experience where you can immediately attempt to fix what went wrong and counter the opponent.
---
I was playing with slivers
---
recruit is giving jäger a bj
---
Then I have yet to see it lol
---
Sweet can’t wait
---
It'd be your team's fault for losing three in a row though, not adapting to the enemy team's strategies and paths. For example, you in the basement and they pick a Hibana first round and kill two from hatches? Next round go Kaid and negate that strategy of theirs.
---
Oh god he's playing Glaz
---
The layout of theme park isn't maze like at all, it is just the lighting that needs work. Chalet on the other hand is my least favorite ranked map because of how lopsided the sites are. Trophy is the only viable site. Garage is broken with maverick and the new capitao, Rotates are almost impossible in the other two sites, and it is quite difficult in garage as well. At least you have the ability to roam in Theme Park.
---
Me too. I’d be happy to queue with you and just run through basic stuff.
---
Damn!  I really like the Lynx idea!
---
Don't have an answer for ya, ask Ubi
---
Most of the maps are based off of real things, though. Oregon is based off of the Waco cult incident.
---
Cheers thanks, that's all I need to know. Gonna go whoop a few noobs while there's a free weekend 😉
---
Oh shit yeah that’s hot. I like that user name too. My GT on Xbox is A loaf 0f bread. So I always love seeing another breadi boi.
---
Balance is one thing, but this game already lacks variety in terms of game modes in my opinion. Taking away two out of three game modes just because some sweaty asses don't like them is total bullshit.
---
This is brilliant. I'm still hoping we get an SSG operater. Siege has lots of players from Pakistan.

---
Alright you have fun
---
Pc
---
All I see is a bunch of chatter about Favela and Hereford (which absolutely does not need to be changed), and then one or two saying Tower is too roamer friendly. Again, if attackers would stick together and focus on attacking one single objective and have a decent flank watch, tower is not a problem. Most maps, with the exception of Favela and Yacht, are like that.
---
Everything’s better on PC
---
Not even close, it’s wayyy to narrow to be competitive.
---
You should definitely get this game. The community is active, developers are nice and responsive and the game itself is fun if you let it's hooks into you, especially if you have some friends who have the game.
---
Those are all super cool! I think Sopros throwing his gun is a little unrealistic, but I would love to see all of these things included in the game!
---
And hes getting nerfed so succ dicc. WHY ARE THEY NERFING HIM HE WAS FINE
---
If the only ops they have get banned, you get recruit.
---
Love the collection but I hope Ubisoft doesn’t continue this trend if not adding new weapons. I feel like an operators weapon should be as unique to them as their ability so seeing an operator who has an ability which isn’t that different from Cav and Vigil with no new guns is alarming
---
If only you could google it
---
&gt;”I like to have ‘realistic’ skins...”
---
&gt;silver/platinum
---
That’s gonna be a no for me dog. Black, tan, green, or some other kind of neutral color.
---
Damn i wantet to comment exactly the same
---
I would love a electricity based attacker. I know we got Thatcher and Twitch on attackers. But I am looking for more like Kaid or Bandit type of lingering electricity gadget. 
---
A version I could think of is like a Kaid Rtila device than the attacker op can place on reinforced walls to electrocute someone behind it and destroy gadgets.  It could have longer range than bandit electrified wall, but it could also be a limited time only
---
I'm 37 with 3 kids, a full time job, a mortgage, and bills up the wazoo. But I still make time for siege for at least a few hours on Saturday. And I usually rank plat and gold if I have time to grind at it a little. I can't compete with high schoolers that have cat like reflexes, nor the patience for their online banter, but I'm impressed I can still hold my own.
---
Yeah ps4 is probably the best place to get it anyways, from what ive experienced its the least toxic version of the game.
---
But like... Deagle... Muzzle brake.... Need I say more?
---
Accident
---
Rogue 9 has a video on the hard data of every muzzle attachment
---
If it’s the TS you own all the ops, if not then IdK. He might’ve selected him
---
PC. Everything is better on PC, exceptions being driving, fighting, and sports games, and even then that's just input method.
---
Couldn’t give less of a shit about pros opinion because I don’t play like them what so ever.
---
I love the ideas and as much as id love to see new guns. I just dont think there is much point in introducing more. Like if an op has a new gun with 48 damage and 650 RPM why not just give them the para or the m248?
---
The community is very active on PS4, it's what I play the game on. The only issue you'll get playing the game on console is that controllers just aren't as precise as a mouse and keyboard, but it's not the kind of issue that should keep you from being good at the game. Since it's free this weekend, I'd recommend getting a couple of friends of yours who have PS4's to play it with you and see if they like it as well. The game is a blast with friends. Good luck, hope you like the game.
---
My buddy is gonna check this game out for the first time this weekend, and I'm definitely gonna show him this. I feel like with the help of someone who has a least a little bit of knowledge, this is a useful tool for noobs.
---
That dead Vigil though... dramatic.
---
They should keep this background.
---
Change my mind.
---
Dude this amazing, good job I just wish I could read it better
---
What do you think?
---
*A grain of salt*
---
I'm not sure, they have same stats but I'm not sure about recoil patterns. Mute's MP5K also works really well for me though.
---
Holy shit
---
No chance for a map preference for ranked?
---
I'd only be happy if you could put the shield on your back and dual wield
---
They’re good guns to have in a load-out regardless of originality
---
Lynx is my favorite out of all these because it provides an amazing balance, like Lion or Dokkaebi’s abilities it singlehandedly trumps them
---
Honestly I read this as ForHonor subreddit and I got real confused
---
I believe challenged reset in about 30 min to an hour, they almost always reset around then on Thursdays, also this confirms the new season dropping the 11th which is sicko
---
Great effort, great ideas, loved Lynx &lt;3
---
Well 99% of the Diamonds disappear from that weird mixed unranked Elo at the beginning of each season so the smurfs only make up a small portion I would say.
---
bruh not at all i recoreded this way before i even had reddit
---
They dont really need a poll, they have the player data. 
---
FWIW though the response to pick and ban and the Road to SI playlist was overwhemlinly positive.
---
didnt you always have to have it
---
Heres the rest of the weapons name on mimics guns Desarollos Industriales Casanave SC-2005
---
100% quitting Ps4 too and i really hope we can play when free weekend is over because i don't wan to loose all the friends i made on Ps4.
---
That's what I thought. Please don't bring last stand to R6.. It would be annoying as hell to down someone, then take a random headshot from a lucky hipfire and lose the round. No thank you.
---
Good luck in your console silver games
---
Honestly, the map pool is fine if they give us a CSGO style map choice system. With the changes coming to ranked next season, it’s really the only thing missing now.
---
I got my girlfriend into Siege a few months ago, and in order to make it easier to onboard her, I got a smurf account to play Newcomers with her. During each round, I would provide encouragement, callouts and direction to my teammates (many of whom were true newcomers). I wasn't toxic in voice or text chat, and I usually played passive information gathering or support roles. 
---
Many of those people would've gained a grasp of basic concepts like boiler plate strats for attack and defense, not reinforcing between sites, and better team composition. 
---
Should my smurf account have been banned given the information above?
---
actually it would be cool if they showed an acog charm instead and placed it in the game.
---
Maestro is like "Which stairs?"
---
I didnt but now i do fuck
---
Assuming misleading title is meant to be passive aggressive, chill out. Ubisoft was having a hard time getting the approvals needed to use the likeness’s of new guns.
---
Your weapon choices are absolutely on point. Seriously, the game needs new weapons like these. Bizon, ACE23, MAG7... great choices
---
I bought 200 alpha packs and haven’t gotten black ice. Tell me your secret
---
I'd give Vigil at least a tiny bit of utility denial with his high Intel because I kill so many drones with him, but that's just me
---
r/nice
---
Imagine being this worked up over something someone else said on the internet
---
It is easy to hit shots because it has no recoil so therefore it is good
---
Because casual has a seperate, less advanced matchmaking. Im level 216, and im matched against level 30’s to 300’s, sometimes level 0s
---
Rest In Peace recruit 😔👆
---
For reals though better droning was what got me to plat solo que, I never used to like it but now if i play a different game i just think fuck me i wish i had a drone. It's a huge part of what makes siege what it is. If you dont enjoy it then play something else.
---
Vertically yes but the horizontal is worse than the machine pistols
---
This is it, the new pro league strat.
---
I'm lvl 78 and dont have a single black ice
---
I am Okay with the same guns but I don’t think fmg is a good weapon for this kind of operator.
---
Holy shit, right? I’ve always wanted to play a full match of tactical realism with 5 v 5 recruits and no HUD.
---
It’d be hilarious.
---
Because nine times out of ten it is suicide.
---
My wife plays on PS4 with a pretty cool crew, her handle is madge_626.
---
But to me he sounds like a shield op with last stand
---
My main issue is that it needs more descriptive areas. Like you have to know the exact names of stuff to make callouts for the most part.
---
probably a week
---
Spectator glitch, happens all the time
---
He also bitches and whines that ping abuse is a thing, can’t accept when hes outplayed. Hes a whiny baby

Me and my friend get to attack at the start 95% of the time, we have been playing siege for over 3 years now and that hasn’t changed, next season its gonna be attack attack and attack........
---
I think it has something to do with the location me and my friend live, we are located in the netherlands and all have a steady 9 ms

Good design, some of these are questionable tho. How is ying more of an antiroamer than jackal and gridlock?
---
You need 3
---
Thanks. This just makes me wanna find it more now.
---
I too have some ideas that I've posted before, which maybe you could include in a year 6 concept
---
Maybe also include a stat for how good they are at pushing site and planting for attackers, or redefine support to include this.   
---
Same goes for plant denial on defense.   
---
I think these two stats would help new players think in terms of winning as a team, instead of saving the AWP.
---
They already talked about releasing the old client as a "game mode" some time
---
HOLY HECKIN FRICK! IS THIS A JOJO'S REFERENCE?????

I would love a pp bizon
---
THANK YOU
---
It's not in beta as of June 11th (the pro league update)
---
Got one for fuzes lmg yesterday. Sucks cuz i never play fuze but i was pretty hyped
---
Luckily it doesn’t matter is banned I main all 😈
---
Yeah I’m gonna try again now
---
Irl shield bearers usually catty 2 pistols, but they don't throw one instead they holster the first and take out the second
---
Silent dawn sounds like a great idea, I really like the idea of placing something like microphones all around the map.
---
Your sens is digusting, poor kid couldnt even move a muscle
---
Rook mine
---
Pretty sure Ar33 is a version of the G3 or is the G3 but probably will change stuff. Also pretty sure irrc cap's AR is a Fal.
---
For balancing reasons. Eg, the UMP. Terrible gun, but it has to be, or pulse would be op. Unfortunately, Castle is also affected by that.
---
"Some people" should uninstall.

---
I just got here today, lol
---
Do you know the file? And we need to delete it every time we update the game right?
---
You could still play them in casual at least. But this is really a subjective issue. A lot of people will prefer it to be more competitive than having more game modes cuz just focusing on improving their gameplay and getting better at the game is enough, and others want more modes even if they aren’t as balanced. Both are valid ways of thinking. Idk I feel like the game already has so much variety in how a match can play out that leaving the other modes to casual and having the most balanced parts in competitive makes sense. Counter strike only has one game mode yet it’s one of the most popular games of all time. It’s more about variety in how a match can play out and focusing on improving your gameplay for a lot of people who actually play competitive.

---
Plane can be turned into a one floor map with 5 reinforcements and 2 roamers. Attackers can be trapped in spawn with very little effort on the defenders part. 
---
Every plant in house can be held from outside the building with only one vault prompt.
---
I remember playing ranked on both of these maps and I, along with a majority of the player base, do not wish to return there. They are fun maps, not competitive maps. They should remain in casual.
---
Idc what anyone says, this flat out dope! Good job bro!!! Keep it up!!
---
CSGO has 3 ranked game modes and you can choose maps to play on. Besides that there's plenty unranked modes and shot tone of unofficial modes. This isn't really an argument
