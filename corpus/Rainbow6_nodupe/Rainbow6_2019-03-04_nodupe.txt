Need to NERF Echos blast effect, it pisses me off that a flashbang can go off 5 feet away from you and barely effect you, but a blast of noise literally turns you into Hellen Keller for the rest of the round

---
245k currently 
---
I have a little over 30K right now, Saving up to get the new Seasonal Weapon Skins when Burnt Horizon releases.
---
__Oh yeah I forgot that the only thing that matters about an operator is their gadget.__
---
what is mobility
---
I think he's not bad in ranked bc if you know how his gadget works it becomes a very effective tool but he's still defenetly out of the meta and extremely situational, there're few spots where you can confidently get a kill with the first nade without giving an opponent time to react and run away 
---
Smart üëç
---
Thatcher‚Äôs situation (I think)
---
I am at 406K rn trying to go to 1 million before august
---
cosmetics are useless. worry more about balance 
---
Ahh...duh.
---
None of the challenges are ticking for me. Just tried to do the Shotgun T-Hunt kills and even that wouldn't tick.
---
See my other comment. I threw the last 2 out of maybe 20 matches beacuse i was so curious. But at that point I was so low rank it was basically casual. I apologize for my behaviour
---
I think I got about 14K
---
I'm still trying to buy operators though
---
2k
---
They downvoted him, because he told them the truth. 
---
So you want her to be impossible to counter because it requires teamwork to stop her?  Cav isn‚Äôt good in higher ranks because she preys on loners and that doesn‚Äôt happen with players who actually know how to play
---
I never save up more than 30k. I buy what I want, I have an operator skin for everyone that I generally like. 
---
how many matches did you throw to try to get some internet points 
---
Like if they go Archives on Bank, Fuze from above Vastly OP. But any other obj is almost useless, unless you know the team is going to pick alot of trap operators, then you can fuze an area to destroy them as best as you can
---
Cav, I definitely think her lore is one of the better ones and would be a cool idea :).
---
Happened to me but i got finka'd while cav was looking around for others lol
---
Oh shit that breathing was the bomber?! I thought it was Gridlock sprinting down a hallway, damn my bad. 
---
2
---
ZULUL 
---
When you run out of rifle ammo right when he turns the corner
---
That is literally the most practical operator idea I‚Äôve heard. That would be fun to be on both ends of though. They could also have a time period where you can speak through it and just say stuff to the enemy.
---
That's the point though of it. It's a tactical thing my dude to I encourage smarter rushing rather then straight rushing. And yes any team can rush and win any pro will tell you that any plat or diamond will tell you that heard them say it myself. Its skill and not the strategy itself. The strategy on it's own is no matter what gonna always be considered toxic, the least ubi can do is lower the toxicity around it and give everyone on the game a proper chance to counter it in some way
---

---
They are about to add the new comers playlist. I'll easily bet the first round of every round of that will be a rush I'm almost tempted to make a smurf account just to prove myself right
---
I used to always shit myself when I would forget about the bomber in Glaz‚Äôs situation
---
A better bandit elite than that trash junkie they call an elite. (I know bandit used to be a 'junkie', but still this elite is just...bad.)
---
I‚Äôm utterly disgusted at this poor and tasteless representation of riders. What a bigot. Everyone knows a real rider sleeps on their garage crawler under their bike. 
---
Wonder how many airsoft rounds it takes to down someone with it, oh don‚Äôt forget to interrogate either 
---
Holy crap

Hello ZippoNipples! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**

I prefer to believe that OP form 4'd a legit suppressor just for an airsoft gun lol 
---
People act like making Fuze a 2 speed will fix his fundamental problems. Being an incredibly loud operator with a gadget that trained ears will hear while needing to be on the side of a soft wall or barricade is innately dumb. Allow him to deploy his gadget onto a surface from a distance kind of like Ying so that he doesnt need to put himself into the line of fire to cluster charge and I think he would become a lot better.
---
they‚Äôve literally said they‚Äôre working on it. calm down 
---
Where the hell did you read that i *want* her to become anything? A shitty op is better than a broken one, be it in PL or pub.
---
F
---
Siege on console is a cesspool of toxicity.
---
So i guess there actually IS a reason for the beta tag...
---
because not having it ruins the game and makes it unplayable 
---
Like league levels? 
---
That‚Äôs probably your issue. Learn how to communicate. I solo queue half the time and I still don‚Äôt get rushed. Idk how you can complain about rushes yet say you don‚Äôt get rushed. Like what? That‚Äôs like me complaining that Glaz is OP even though he never kills me. And smoke only stops a rush for like 10 seconds. It‚Äôs stupid to waste your smoke so early in the round when you can save it and be much more beneficial for the team later in the round. You can just use a roamer or trap operator and pressure them out of a rush 29 times a better early in the round. You don‚Äôt need to waste a gadget to stop a rush for 10 seconds. No one plays him like this unless you have an easy kill. Smoke is so easy to counter early in the round. Just go a different route and laugh because he wasted his gadget. 
---
I tend to try to come up with practical ideas for the game rather then off the walls stuff. A lot of it gets hate but ultimately on almost everything I say on reddit is ether something that would actually work or something that could help the game
---
waste of your time and your teammates time 
---
You still need suppressor height sights for an Osprey. You can even see on SilencerCo's page that they have it outfitted to a Glock with raised sights and it still doesn't appear to clear the can.
---
Hot take: all of your idea but it‚Äôs just bombers with no non-bomber AI 
---
Thats imposible.
---
Same
---
Siege is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. I have more than 2500 hours of my life wasted on it. Probably gonna have another 1000 hours before I‚Äôm done with it. Best $60 I ever spent and now it‚Äôs only like $20
---
Is it possible for solo queuing to be less frustrating, I.e: making it so solo queued players are matched with other solo players and not going against stacks? Other games do this and I think it would be worth implementing in Siege.
---
Also a ping system like the one in Apex Legends would be amazing.
---
Alibi needs to change decoy uniform. I feel bad when i bought the pro league skin and it puts me at a disadvantage.
---
Also ela' higher horizontal recoil than vertical can be mitigated to an extent with angled grip. Just my two cents. I go gripless on jager for the same reason.  Just my 2 cents.
---
I get one when I hear that bomb click and I get blinded from his blue light
---
Smh...
---
Cav's gun has zip ties holding the cloth on in-game though. I'm pretty sure they're not even flush cut, just like the ones on OPs gun
---
Flair doesnt check out
---
I really want to get into it, but I only got console, so like do I suffer the toxicity or wait til I get a PC?
---
Ye hate to see it
---
True. Im sorry. Im admittedly selfish and will never throw again
---
Wasn't this graphic already been posted?
---
I think we need to get badger, Anthonypit1, tuxbird, and another 7 big R6 tubers and have them play a few matches with pro league rules
---
Siege take so long to learn i have 500 hours and i still haven‚Äôt learned everything, you need as much time as you can get
---
What?!? You‚Äôve been spawnkilled by Alibi with a shotgun. Bruh. Smh. Yeah any character can do a good runout, but if they get instant domed by a prefiring team, they won‚Äôt get a kill. It‚Äôs so easy to counter. So damn easy. Just because you pick an operator with a DMR that doesn‚Äôt mean anything. I don‚Äôt need thermal imaging if my bullet hits their head before I even see them. Learn how to prefire boi 
---
Smooooooooookkkkeeesssss
---
Why is Frost's pick rate so low?
---
will Capitao's blue smoke ever be coming back?
---
So glad the meme is finally dying. he could of had a rework already if it wasnt for that meme.
---
*pulls up wattpad* lets get to work
---
Mhhhh
---
They‚Äôre so predictable though is what bores me, especially on new Hereford. Any entrance point you go in will automatically attract 5-6 terrorists, then there‚Äôs normally 1-2 rooms on the same floor housing 3, that brings you down to 14 which spawns one at some spawnpoint and comes to you, then once you hit 9 the same thing happens, then the last 6 are not hard to find. I would loooooooove it if the AI terrorists could learn from your gameplay and adapt to it. 
---
^Mhhh
---
Average weapons. That's a good joke. They're awful
---
I'd say HK416 is more likely than g36.
---
"Online interactions not rated by ESRB"
---
Well I'm not, so why bring it up if you aren't either? 
---
The games community is really toxic. i recommend that you get a group of 4 friends to constantly play with just to avoid this next time
---
 
---
Drag down further, it's all preference and personally I'd rather move my joystick a whole lot to control the recoil than just a tiny bit, don't like the sensitivity it just feels less controlled. 
---
Because you're wrong?
---
Are you really not gonna use a google or reddit search bar? There also numerous season notes and roadmaps on the subject.
---
Are you the source? What's the twitter, tumblr, artstation?
---
.... cloaking mines and drones, big sonar drones, fidget spinnig thermite projectiles... yeeahh i think your point crashed along with your stupid comment.  
---
What you should have said is " For another, it adds competition, it makes the game more difficult because it forces you to second guess decisions to ensure you don't accidentally kill your teammates in the process of your actions..." as said by @ShiftyGaz. That is exactly why i feel that team damage removal would be a bad decision.
---
Ok, you taking up beef with an underpowered op and siding with a fucking shield. Smh
---
I thought it was in the lightbulb but it's at the chain which makes this much better lol
---
When Montange in your only friend
---
"How am I supposed to enjoy browsing a SFW subreddit for a video game about the military if I can't jerk my ding dong to every piece of fan art?! This is ridiculous!"
---
It is reverse friendly fire after 1 kill. It was revealed in the siege invitational. Here's a link to the vid: (https://youtu.be/tu2wXfLN3ps). 
---
Well yea, but also their guns are pretty good. The operator like ela has a good shotgun primary for cqb, and SMG that will miss every shot unless you very close. Her gadget is fine as it is rn. The problem is her weapon. 
---
Angled grip does nothing for recoil.
---
Lion was only good in pro league? Wut? 
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
It was revealed in the invitational. Here's a link to the video: https://youtu.be/tu2wXfLN3ps 
---
So yes they are doing something...
---
Makes it so much easier to peak from the corners with acog as you have a more magnification on your scope. 
---
have you got the elite skin though
---
\^\^\^\^   
---
The placement of a charge is incredible loud. Destroy the window glass on windows but leave the barricades intact and you'll be able to hear the charges beeing placed alot easier.
---
Yeah.  Play on console.  He's horrid on console
---
German Princess. Sounds about right 
---
If you're on PC, you could always download the test server just to try out ops before you get them. Test server has every op unlocked by default for everyone.
---
Definitely looks like a real weapon lol. 
---
A SWAT team was called onto my campus because a kid was shooting an air soft gun out the window. They busted down doors and pointed assault rifles at kids, zip tied em up and stuff, thought it was an active shooter situation. 
---
You‚Äôre probably not that stupid but I never forgot that. 
---
Yup. Queen Ela and the Princess of Germany.
---
Roaming doc and rook is cancer. That's why they should lose their acogs as well 
---
Far easier to get people to look for them
---
Wrong about what? I asked a question, not make a statement. You're the wrong one here bud
---
Sound concussions can kill you.
---
Can they put an aug on a new operator? Love the aug just feel useless to my team using IQ, do ppl use IQ alot?
---
My heart usually ends up stopping when I hear bombers
---
Only one that needs changed is smg12 and even then just a tiny bit, they're working as intended, it's meant to be a last resort of sorts. 
---
Where's the link you are talking about?
---
Yep, an unfortunate truth. 
---
0% ban rate*
---
gotttt eeeeeeeeeeem
---
yeah everybody who plays high sens must use mnk of course
---
I've tried every combination possible. The only one that makes it usable at all is vertical grip and compensator 
---
Maybe have like a throwback event where you have the opportunity to unlock old stuff but being able to get it normally defeats the purpose. Imagine being someone who grinded out the events and then a few months later, everyone was able to unlock the stuff anyway willy-nilly.
---
No you must get black ice for smoke and claymores and elite skin cyka blyat 
---
&gt;Wrong about what?
---
Your ability to look for yourself. Your conception of what the anti tk system will be. Much more I'd guess.
---
&gt; You're the wrong one here bud
---
About..?
---
Is there a reason that the development, deployment, and implementation of different builds to the TTS remains a logistic nightmare on the team, despite 3 full years to refine the process?
---
Technically with the season pass you can get 99.90%
---
Timing for the meme song should start near the c4 kill.
---
Either or it'd still make sense.
---
Very true. I think I'm just going to delete the link.

I‚Äôm glad we agree. I find the new nerf is just Ubisoft and their messed up priorities. You have guns like the F2 and the R4-C on your lineup, yet an already weak DMR is the top priority?
---
Love the freak out there after the Doc kill
---
Realise your mistakes and work on them
---
To practice aim go in T Hunt or situations. And try to get some friends to play with, learn stuff in the game while having fun.
---
Yeah honestly dont take it too hard, I still have bad games, bad days etc 1000+ hours especially on ps4 with controller, PC is just easy aim so its harder to have bad whatever but yeah, even shroud is like it's one of those games where you can have shitty times but also really good ones, it varies
---
Op what platform? Maybe I can help ya out. 
---
Find some friends to play with, makes the game more fun, easier, and better all around

An RPG is rocket propelled though, and the guy I was responding to was meaning rocket propelled grenade as he clearly wasn't referring to the Russian anti tank weapon.

So guys

Most likely it will be out Tuesday.

Thanks :)
---
Also can you take vertical shots pls I would love making it my wallpaper
---
Not a combat uniform.
---
Air jabs have legitimately saved me just as much as killed me. I once got blown clear of the line of fire of two enemies (they were in the blast radius as well) and recovered first, shooting them both. 
---
Still a uniform they wear.

Have it be an operation paperclip type thing. A valuable scientist being held prisoner by their own government and two sides trying to secure them.

 Ok I‚Äôm assuming that you are on console. For the first issue, you should turn v sync off. If you have it on terrorist hunt caps at 30 FPS on console, but if you turn it off it gets higher. I play on Xbox one x and when I turned it off, it caps at 80 FPS.

Calm down Satan 
---
I like that skin too
---
This happens to me except it‚Äôs silver 1 :(
---
I don't like a lot of the skins honestly
---
Are we going to see more attachments or gadgets be given to all the operators? E.I. new grenades, 2x or cantersights?
---
Misleading title I expected 4 hammer kills.
---
Yeah but I don't know if that means I can buy it on March 4th. Or if it means I can't

Didn‚Äôt it get delayed a few months?

When are the Monty Pro league and IQ skins getting fixed? :)
---
What do you understand "before" to mean?
---
Same. I like the Elite skins except for Blitz
---
Ahh yes, _*Aussies*_
---
Hmm. what I meant by that was that Tachanka be usable in the META that has evolved in Rainbow. That is exposing as little of yourself as possible and shooting people in the head while moving fast. That is what I meant. I dont care if he isn't important. I just want that they make him usable. No other operator other than Clash is like that.
---
Good job
---
Not until Humanity as a whole can stop being toxic to each other.
---
Thanks for the new threat
---
The question is can he rocket jump 
---
Just a FYI.
---
While its annoying to be matched against high ping players and smurfs, Its not cheating technically since its not against the TOS to have multiple accounts or slightly high ping and reporting those accounts will not do anything. 
---
Wait so you didn‚Äôt intentionally drop to copper? lol
---
This was some fantastic advice, and I definitely never have touched the shotgun.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I use the L85, and you're absolutely right: It's far more accurate and the damage seems to be on-par with the AR33, despite being at a slightly slower rate of fire.
---
I use reflex for sure as an attachment, with everything else except laser sights (because, as a Thatcher main, fookin' laser sights). 
---
As for the equipment, I like to use the breaching charges with the L85. I'm not sure why, I just like being useful in terms of knocking down walls and assaulting enemies from the backside. I'll have to try the better fire rate for breaching and clearing, though!
---
Why did you steel this off of Instagram smfh
---
Well, there's not really something I can tell you about it. Microsoft is not really talkative about this topic and keep things quiet. All I know is that there is one. It is up to game devs *if* and how they want to use it.
---
But the adapters that cost as much as the console itself are still working. I mean it is a good idea to able to play on console with a MnK if you some sort of disability, but especially nowadays where Xbox has ~~6 years after PS4 /s~~ native MnK support there is no real use for it anymore.
---
YES
---
Yes. 
---
Did this earlier with my mates. We ended up winning a match by priming grenades and running up to the opponent. There was only 4 of us so we kicked the 5th guy repeatedly. We must‚Äôve kicked atleast 15 people but we gave them a fair warning before he next match. 
---
That's one woke grangran
---
Nope... I‚Äôm screwed lol
---
Even weirder is that they let a guy with not only an lmg, but also extremely dangerous hockey pucks into a hostage situation.
---
Well, considering how most of those people ended up, I'd say he's kinda justified in subscribing to the Spock ideology
---
tonight? are you new?
---
Oh don‚Äôt worry, I don‚Äôt report them. I just repeatedly teamkill them on my ‚Äútotally not illegal‚Äù smurf account. 
---
Annnnd my day is ruined
---
18.5/20. Wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòpersuasive‚Äô enough

Hello Strikeeey, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ax28le/found_a_glitch_on_fortress/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
unless this is your first time playing a fps game, there is not fucking way to accidently drop to copper 4 / 900 ish mmr.
---
You have to actively throw games to get this low, Even being afk will keep you around copper. 
---
I remember when Alpha Packs first came out and I think everybody started at 50%, I ended up getting to about 80% but ever since then, the highest I‚Äôve gotten was about 40%
---
it was probaly stolen from reddit
---
Ouch, sorry jumping to conclusions. I thought you were one of the plats who dropped to copper to doo doo in kids. Solo queuing is hell I feel the pain. I‚Äôve solo queued since black ice and I‚Äôve been gold ever since dust line, the highest I‚Äôve got is gold 1 :(
---
Recruit
---
Have you tried hiding out of the view of smokes. Also lesion
---
and you must be a balanced operator that isn't just a member cyka blyat
---
I like the skin as well 
---
Look all I can tell you is "Peek long" and "Save AWP"
---
Where does all this lore come from? It sounds so interesting but have no clue where to read about it all.

Attackers: zofia and jackal

Defenders: Ela and vigil or alibi

Killcams aren't accurate

This will even be better when Ubi removes Gold 4 and adds Copper, Bronze and Silver 5 in Y4S2

True.

A diamond solo(unless your a pro you dont solo dia rank) queues up they will get matched with other high plats and worse case low plats/gold1s. 
---
They will not get matched with silvers or low golds even with the current matchmaking system. Everytime you get a diamond in a sliver match, its cause of search baiting 
---
not enough to deserve that

no it's especially bad tonight

Plot twists: 
---
Artist was also drunk. 
---
I get the joke, and I get that it's annoying that people post this as much but say a more casual person enjoying Siege goes to the Reddit about 48 hours before the new season is supposed to launch and sees no mention of a release post. Twitter also mentions nothing if they do check that.
---
Isn't it normal for people to ask? They just want a little update on the current state of things without keeping up with Siege every day. Reddit is a perfect place for that, as players can help each other out with that info, however little we know.
---
Especially this season with people hearing 3 weeks of tts and thinking it applies to this season already it isn't that out of the ordinary that people ask. Could they check the new feed and find an answer? Possibly, but not with jokes like this, already seen people repeating this who genuinely seem to think it was delayed (not the brightest move on their part imo). 
---
I find Ubi's strategy annoying that they rather not risk delaying an officially announced release date and just keep us in the dark easily up to 24 hours before the release.

Ahh I see well fuck
---
I should clarify this: 
---
I'm complaining about the mag because using mags in an M249 is about as reliable as the Germans were to the Russians during WWII.
---
Suffice to say, your M249 will jam if you put an M4 mag in it. Which is ironic considering the mag well is built for M4 mags... 
---
Really you should only put mags in an M249 if you're completely out of belts and can't get any more.

Man they couldn't even make the lava skin glow. This would be sick tho
---
Wheres Lion

Expecting Skyrim intro 
---
I feel like the lava parts on the skin should glow or something. The skin as it is looks too matte.
---
To be honest old Hereford was one of my favorite maps, it was just so fun
---
That‚Äôs been in the game since launch lmao 
---
That is actually... not offensive at all.

As Marines say : accuracy by volume

You can‚Äôt spend money on them. Black ice drops from Alpha Packs only which can be earned from winning games or buying with renown and there is no way to spend money to earn renown other than a renown boost. This picture right here shows cold hard dedication and a little bit of luck.

Smaller and lighter support weapon good for suppression. Jams pretty easily though

---
From what I seen other online, team PVP games do is have a rank cut-off in which diamond players can squad up with platinum and above while lower rank players can squad up with everyone except diamond players. 
---
Along with the rank cut-off you should be matched with other teams(squad or otherwise) that have a similar MMR rating to you(e.g. both teams with an MMR estimate of Gold 2) or 1 tier rank higher (e.g. your team is MMR estimate is gold 1 and opposing team MMR estimate is gold 2).

I had the cam off, Feelsbadman

Nice üòÅ

fake news

How? I unload like 5 shots center mass before it kills me.
---
Omg genius
---
You didn't make the head big enough
---
New Hereford is ass change my mind.
---
Yes. I think some parts of the gun should be shiny like 10-20%. The rest matte and the lava should def. glow
---
That's totally fine dude. I dont adore the skins but the charms are low key cute 
---
This is going to get more upvotes than the post itself

I legit did not understand what was so upsetting until after he went inside the room and then I remembered ‚Äúyes, that amazing map where we all made great memories üò¢‚Äù.

I feel you, but i did have two friends with me

Not a bad idea. I don't think he'd be that viable but he could be a fun operator just to increase options for attackers.
---
Personally my own take in addition to everything already said I'd give him BB's ADS speed with the rifle, maybe even a tiny bit slower too, but given what the rifle is make the bipod usable and when he's using it against something he has a decent amount less recoil.
---
I think those two additions would really push his sniper role, rewarding stationary play but making him easier to find and punishing people that want to try and advance quickly without switching to his pistol.
---
Eh. It was.... S1 wae the canadian season aka buck and frost.
---
No thanks, I main Fuze and can do surgical fuzing even on some hostage rooms with current trajectories.
---
Camping as cab in the attic, fuzeing rooms below from said attic
---
The turret as a primary weapon and a bipod. Similar to how glaz has a rifle and a scope. it's just that simple.
---
Weird flex but ok...

Spawnpeekers these days....
---
Yeah that's the answer

Who does the new season come out?

Nope ash doesn‚Äôt have a head

Sucks the fun out of the game honestly.

This is an old picture lol. still funny but seems like a repost

Amazing!

Please tell me Pita is plural

Damn only 3 kills on the other side. Bro u bad

They are. The clothes and armor aren't part of the hitbox, only the body is.

The only one I can see being different is Gridlock because of how big she is and she isn't wearing anything bulky.

You loose a lot don't you .

I have watched this without sound, and I'm hearing crying sounds

Ah yes, anecdotal evidence. I actually don‚Äôt know that many diamonds personally, but straw man argument aside; What does that have to do with reverse boosting?

Everyone have their right to do what they want. As long as you‚Äôre not obnoxious about it I guess. Oh, and as long as you don‚Äôt go out of your way to attack someone for not liking a ship you like

Since everybody is down voting me to hell for no reason and believing this guy, here is some proof.  Look at the date fellas https://imgur.com/download/wYEKxMB , check the date

I would like to point out the map is still in the scenario missions.

Thats a really strong biohazard container. must be a plat

i like how you had to go to situation one to get the map

Oh, that makes it less funny IMO.

This is why I don't get why people want the "original op" look. Everyone would look the same.

I came back after a year and I saw so many uniforms that made one person look like someone entirely different. It wasn't fun and its exactly why it makes no sense why people want this.

Will a hardcore, tactical realism mode ever be added? Has the developers interest in this mode completely vanished? I think the active player base is now large enough for new modes to be added and this particular mode would suit the rainbow six title more than the two monster themed modes that have been tried. It could significantly change the way the game is played, without big changes to the game.
---
i don't have time to look at that while playing, so i don't care.
---
Pretty much
---
The lava skin isn't too bad on some weapons

Lord Tachanka was actually to powerful so he agreed with ubishite to only use 0.0001% of his power.
---
has been fixed since ages.
---
I really didn't like old Hereford and I was excited for the rework, but they made it somehow...worse.
---
I know different people work on different maps. Feels like the people who made Tower made the dumb layout, and the people who designed all the boring brown maps designed the visuals. 
---
Turned a bad, but sometimes fun map (like House) into a bad map in general (like Fortress). Rework the rework!
---
He needs at least 1.5x scope on his lmg

I've fo g36 and f2

The downstairs area on old Hereford was legit the best area from the OG maps. Defending that was paradise 
---
The pulse animation looks so goofy since he doesn't have any hair
---
You do you i guess. As long as you dont try to force it on others its cool
---
I think the new one is better balanced
---
They need to ad a headshot sound already
---
Oh if you want to get a clip from Xbox then just upload it to OneDrive and download it from the web client or from the app on your phone
---
yes, because having a one shot kill sniper in a game like siege is a good idea...not.
---
I don't understand why almost everyone is complaining about them. They're the best headshot training in the game, easily

For some reason my head immediately went to ‚Äúis being 4 worth it?‚Äù And really, no sure your little and no one hates u unless u are annoying but everyone treats you like a 3 year old, if I had to chose an age but i had to be little I would go with 7 that like 1st grade I think so I would be treated like a big kid but wouldn‚Äôt have to much responsibility, plus I would probe just getting access to the library so I could read a lot to pass the time

I've seen many people speak good about Mira. Problem is, I might not know where to put her mirrors. Besides Mira, I was leaning towards Echo, Valk or Maestro.

Win 100 games on defense in terrorist hunt 
---
Your connections spiked so you never moved for the doc. Kill cams aren‚Äôt accurate it shows your prospective just from a different angle, not what the server/enemy seen
---
Fortnite tried that and it gotten around within a week AND had a load of false positives for elite controllers so it was dropped.
---
There are many videos on YouTube to show you the placements
---
I don't have maestro and echo but Valk is my favorite op of all
---
Best way to do it is just set it to defend because then you can work on all the trophy's

I would love to play a mode even its a limited time. where roles are reverse Att on def and def on Att

I don't think he should get a Barret m107 .50 cal give him something in .300 win mag or .338 lapua magnum. Maybe an M98b or possibly in the same rifle Chris Kyle used the McMillan tactical .300 win mag.
---
Hello PappaJew,
---
You can play casual... The system is on every serious ranked game I cant believe ubi is so big and won't implement a easy good system. 
---
Outbreak was neat for a minute but it got stale fast. They should stick to making smaller PvP events. Maybe we'll see a terrorist hunt rework someday though. 
---
I don't get how people can miss that p

piece of shit map. Don't get me wrong, I don't enjoy New Hereford a whole lot either, but at least the map has more than one stairway.

My bad, I misread your first comment, it‚Äôs late over here, I apologize.

TTS thread here (contains R6Fix link): [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/ax4n0l/realistic\_level\_terrorists\_do\_nothing\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/ax4n0l/realistic_level_terrorists_do_nothing_about/)
---
You are trying to justify boosting and smurfing...
---
Xbox you?
---
That's exactly what the tts is for, yet the scale of a new season launch is much larger than the number of testers on PC. That plus last minute changes is probably what made them choose for a separate launch last time. Either that or they handed in the patch to late and that's why the patch was launched a day later last season. 
---
That said, I'm hoping for a same day launch.
---
Yeah it doesn‚Äôt take KDA into account I‚Äôve heard ? 
---
What do you like about Valk?
---
True true 
---
Thanks for the answer, i was actually looking the video on your coreross channel and not in 6News, thought you deleted it.  
---
Also now i see that i was looking at the wrong twitter account lol, hoping we get more info on the cosmetics soon.
---
Maybe not damage, but I feel like an "enemies downed" stat would be nice to see. Just for some context

welp

I've already been up there, but the movie title is missing. What's the music from?

They did, he used to drop 5 C4 now he drops 5 frags, although i think they said the old explosion radius was a bug.

Always acog imo

old hereford, home.
---
To be continued 
---
Are there any plans to make 1 speed 3 armor operators more viable? 
---
Gridlock is a first in a long time, so maybe you think the position they're in is satisfactory for now? Or is the speed/armor balance in need of adjustment in you opinion?

every second post is about blitz here

Then every Ash I have seen knows some weird Matrix shit.

Only 2000's kids will understand

YES DO THIS NOW UBI
---
Ok, so I was so confused because I am new to the game and was wondering why that map from the first situations was not in the playlist... and I‚Äôve been wondering what the old version of the map looks like... It all adds up
---
You're right, it's all bad 
---
How do you delete someone's post
---
Yeah
---
I swear I've seen this one before
---
Just wait till next season for the new ops
---
Lol true. I don't know why I didn't think of Mira. 
---
Btw, Mira acog would be life changing.
---
Yea lol
---
*Some men just want to watch the world burn.*
---
I have posted it once maybe 4 months ago
---
Maverick is miles above the rest. Maybe check out the upcoming season and see if Gridlock suits you as well.
---
Oh wow, that‚Äôs so cool. I would of never have spotted that lol
---
I don‚Äôt hate the idea. With the intel heavy defending side it would be nice for attack 
---
&gt; What color is the boathouse at Hereford
---
I don't like your attitude...
---
They are not a legit Diamond, thats the issue here. 
---
They are boosting to get Diamond by abusing the matchmaking so they can be carried to it. This is why Diamond is one of the most common ranks in the game, and completely nullifies the hard work legitimate Diamonds actually put into the game to get to that level 
---
M762 - Vert Grip + Flash Hider
---
LMG-E - Vert Grip + Compensator
---
This is what I run normally, however you could swap the flash hider on the M762 to a muzzle brake and the compensator on the LMG-E to a flash hider if you find vertical recoil hard to control.
---
Imo
---
Maverick &gt; Finka = Nomad &gt; Lion
---
Really?  
---
Honestly I don't feel like she needs it, But I'm an ash main i'm bias'd XD  
---
But if they were to put this in, I wouldn't be opposed too it, would mean handling the R4-C actually takes a bit more skill just like with Bucks, and makes her a tad bit more utility focus'd, not by much but still
---
If it doesnt come out tomorrow, I will come back here.
---
***F***
---
I thought they would announce it.
---
I like pig bones
---
Well that's actually a great idea, definitely gonna try it out id ubi makes super tiny maps for 1v1 or 2v2 gunfights. But still, what if it drives players away from current pvp games
---
Yes it was out of place, but i still enjoyed it for the first 5 hours or so
---
I like animals in tiny cages cooked alive
---
There are two inside also.
---
that shits creepy
---
I ripped my dogs heart out and replaced it with frozen pizza rolls
---
I smash baby piglets heads on walls to feed them to the mothers then whip them to death
---
it be like that lmao
---
But I'm not complaining? I think you're missing the point here...
---
I must be pretty dense today as I dont know what your post has to do with the loss comic other than it has 4 panels.

Ore forgetting that one secure area on new Hereford base that has one door and one window

---
They tweeted about wind bastion release 1 day prior to launch. 
---
Idea i gave the other day is if you intentionally leave during a Ranked game, then you should be forced to sit the next round out. 
---
That way its only yourself and your team that your hurting, and will encourage people to be less toxic within the community. 
---
Cav may have been able to interrogate in that situation (she wouldnt have in this example, but theoretically) - and leaving denys her this utility. Similarly ive lost at least double digit Frost kills because they leave and rejoin. 
---
I haven't play R6S when this mode came out :(

I imagine the creation of clash went like that

Fucktard - "Hey guys we've been seeing a shit ton of bandit x montagne shit so what if..."

Fucktard - "C'mon the shield will be electric and shit"
---

---
Fucktard - "I'll make it easily counterable"
---
Everyone - "Fuck fine"

Secure area basement with Mira was untouchable, imagine having a Kaid to electrify the hatch from below and the two corner Mira walls
---
Why is the SMG-12 so long?
---
tbf two discounts in 6 months isn't a large amount. I am mostly wondering if there has been sales at time of a new season before is all. 
---
Agreed. I used to main Maestro and have tons of super cool evil eye spots. But I've never played him since my Maestro KD dropped to 1.9, dude I am getting so scared at losing some of my ops' KD
---
Typical console players

Meant to say end of december so three months. I cant say if there has been one at the start of a season but I doubt there will be one. Maybe wait until easter or something

I'd love to read what you have to say about it. 
---
Most, not all. 
---
Wierd flex, are you OK? 
---
I dont know the CS:GO system, but at this point, everything is a good option.
---
Yup, if they can make a system that tracks those serial-leavers and toxic people and is able to match them together, then it clears up the issue for those who play the game like it should be played.
---
I think it's LoL that also has a pretty good system
---
Soo, that means that Assassin's Creed which is connected to the Watch Dogs universe is connected to Rainbow Six, thats connected to Ghost Recon, that's connected to Splinter Cell that's connected to Far Cry.
---
Huh
---
Bruh . Had to join the band wagon 
---
If reworking an operator that's been useless since release is their lowest priority I have to wonder what their highest priority is.
---
Precisely. If you use the vert grip you end up reducing the vertical part of your recoil. Then a greater part of your recoil is horizontal.
---
Having more vertical recoil sorts of "flatten" things out for me
---
Whats with the shin holster?  You gonna bend down to grab your gun?  Check out those sketchers bro.

The music is phenomenal.  That's why.  That Up theme is just... good.

Ok thank you 
---
For the record, you're 100% correct, that is the emergency magwell meant for emergency feeding only.
---
If you use it as a primary feed to the gun your a fucking moron, especially since the most you can get out a stalag is 100 rounds, and the base box size for an M249 is 200 rounds.
---
It'd be cool to have the old maps (also pre-rework clubhouse,...) in private matches.
---
Shouldn't be a big effort for UBI.
---
Please stop
---
Hiding just means you give him freedom to do wha he wants aka push the objective calling things clera while he does. And come on you know that you can just step back and take out the needle with plenty of time to still push. Just gonna end it with the fact that he's getting reworked, highly banned in PL and has been stated by UBI that he's way too good at what he does. 
---
&gt; Fourth question: what are your plans for castle and tachanka reworks? Also why did it take you 9 months to rework lion and then actually change so little things like counter time and pinging system instead of outlines?
---
This is the question that needs to be answered. They're calling it a rework but it absolutely isn't. We saw hundreds of valid suggestions posted her and elsewhere on the internet and it feels like they just threw their hands in the air and just said, "Well, let's just make it weaker and call it a day!"
---
Maybe 
---
Ka-yeet 
---
Best MILF tho
---
M√ñTT√ñL√Ñ!
---
Maybe a knockdown effect similar to the airjab, but you can still hipfire while you get up? Gives you the chance to shoot their feet out or something while they take a shot at you while you're on the ground.
---
This, so much!   
---
I played Bartlett in a custom game with 9 other people yesterday, it was loads of fun... even tho everyone else complained about the map. 
---
I think Jackal destroyed it but it lagged and still exploded but with no damage
---
Sadly guns can't be skill based or at least mostly. No matter how good you can control the recoil at some point it's gonna be uncontrolable. It's not just vertical recoil too. A good example is Twitch. You just need to pull down because she is all about the vertical recoil, but yet it's not like you can make it a laser
---
Then why wasn't everyone upside down?
---
Where's the jump out of the window at the end? Amateur hour over here.
---
the subtly is lost on the recruit main
---
Yes you can say it‚Äôs a much more balanced map. But the old one is the better one for me.
---
It was known back when it came out
---
&gt;Why does it take so long to fix/buff/nerf something?
---
Solid question. Why aren't they testing meta changes with the TTS? It's available and it has a high rate of participation. It's the perfect test bed for changes.
---
Dam i miss this map.... why tf they have to change it
---
There is no reliable way to detect MnK on console, as for now. Many have tried.
---
Then sledge and dokkaebi have same hitbox, yeah? although it looks different
---
*Sees health*
---
Nice
---
The complete Edition was on Sale in the Ubisoft store till yesterday. 50 ‚Ç¨ for all Ops and season Pass. Incredible offer.
---
Unfortunatly i bought the game via Steam and an Upgrade is not possible if you bought in on steam and buy the complete Edition from uplay (i asked ubisoft support and this is what they answered me).
---
I would start all over. Skins, Rank, K/D, Stats would be all gone.
---
I really mad about this.
---
But thats the way it is.
---
No need to be rude
---
Why would I wanna play a gamemode about dermatology 
---
Is absolutely blyatifull
---
In a world in which Ying doesn't exist?
---
Eh airsoft pistols almost always use gas tho
---
Likely yes, at least if we believe Ubisoft. Still though that's a fair point as if Gridlock has a different hitbox why couldn't other ops that have come after the hitbox rework have different hitboxes. So I don't know about that one :D
---
because competitive r6 is a meme
---
Nope it was shit and a waste of resources.

I just thought the picture was just washed out.

Can I get a F in chat cos my dad doesn't agree to getting the season pass for me until next week
---
Hibana is with Pulse from the charm released during the SI Invitationals so there‚Äôs that. I highly doubt Finka and Tachanka since the dude is old enough to be her dad, Ubisoft might just keep it as a meme instead of setting it in stone 
---
That you still need uplay to play it. Seems stupid  but if you loose access to either you can't play.
---
I also though it didn't matter until I lost access to my steam account and couldn't play r6 for a week.

I pretty much play nothing but casual anymore and almost nobody plays Ela and if they do they use the shotgun. Despite the fact of having one of the best traps in the game nobody wants to lose the ability to kill somebody 5 feet from them.
---
See CSGO BR. Forced to limit to terrible weapons with an insanely small ammo pool. No thanks. 
---
U arent  
---
If you have a suppressor on I'd take it off, high damage is the only real saving grace of that gun
---
Did they even say it was too strong? I thoguht they removed it because they needed additional testing.
---
Flair checks out
---
This is amazing. I still remember when you guys used to be small-time You-tubers and looking back now, you all have come a long way. You guys have done so much for the Siege community, and it is such a great honour and show of recognition to be interviewing ItsEpi.  
---
I know it is Get\_Flanked's dream to interview Alexandre Remy, the brand director for Rainbow Six Siege, on the Hot Breach Podcast, and I look forward to that day with great anticipation. Because that day will come, and because you guys deserve it.
---
GGs to you guys {-}7
---
Well for one, if I'm going to try to peek aggressively, I wouldn't stay crouched because that slows down your movement speed and when you do want to quick peek, try strafing and when you peek the corner, lean the direction that you're strafing towards and quickly strafe back behind a corner (quickly leaning the opposite way so that you can get your head out of the way asap
---
R6 is cheaper on Steam since UPlay isn't offered in my local currency
---
Only 6 kills for the diamond? Bahahahahaha
---
For whatever reason I kind of like the 417. Good change of pace sometimes. Still wouldn‚Äôt want the Black ice for it tho 
---
I like how ash was barely banned but she‚Äôs losing acog. 
---
Your point? 
---
Craig - Are there any plans to do anything about stream snipers for major streamers in our community? This is really becoming an issue that needs to be addressed. 
---
In a perfect world, you would match with the highest rank in your que
---
They still kept it clubhouse and only made a few changes, so that's good.
---
But they took away the unique "2 building" gameplay in the upper floors, or the open bar area with the elevated pool table.
---
Garage is now also very hard to defend.
---
Yeah it might be legit but kinda feels like they did it to sell it too the thirsty "Lol my main is T H I C C" crowd who don't do it ironically.
---
Hahaha man i miss that
---
1200 Rate of fire, 50 damage
---
Should the armour/speed of an operator affect the extent of recoil? In general 3 speed ops should have higher recoil than 1 speeds. For example capitao with the lmg should have worse recoil than gridlock with the same lmg.
---
Yessir
---
Original &gt; new
---
Unless it's the Spetsnaz, but yeah.
---
Damn she's sunBurnt(Horizon)
---
It was awesome
---
until you played every map.
---
It also didn't help that they made a storyline for it, but you couldn't play it in the right order so you were randomly thrown into a piece of the story.
---
Yikes, I never saw the full changes, just a single screenshot. I must admit though, it does look a hell of a lot easier to follow than Hereford's new aesthetic.
---
Up is a masterpiece in cinema and one of the best movies of all time.
---
Just had to use this opportunity to praise Up because it‚Äôs really good.
---
If that was me I would have unloaded into Docs body.
---
You are underestimating my Recruit power!
---
He's annoying because he is unbalanced... 
---
I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs the case. Care to elaborate?
---
This same question is being asked once every 20 minutes on this sub, Not too hard to look around for an answer before posting.
---
You can kill someone the same exact moment because I have defused a bomb and been killed yet we still ended up winning the round 
---
For me id have to say sludge. Simple ability decent weapons cool elite I also like destroying soft walls but defense I love valk perfect gun for me great gadget and a BEAUTIFUL elite skin
---
That's now how game companies and publisher works, they have to deliver at least something off the requirements sheet and then push it into production, Ubisoft was probably fine with scrapping those 5 more maps and scenarios because they might have already thought that they wanted to bring outbreak back, bigger and better, using those already half made 5 maps, maybe in a different setting or whatever
---
Story wise, maybe they weren't that much connected to the prior scenarios and were just their own story arch 
---
I liked the concept, but it was poorly executed. It was hyped but there were only three missions, and no reason to replay them. The packs were expensive and had barely any items that people wanted. They could have implemented more chances for people to earn them instead of locking them behind a paywall.
---
Me neither, but I played a lot of the OW co-ops amd those were fun so r6s should be fun too
---
It really isn‚Äôt. It may fool kids in casual, but it really isn‚Äôt that good
---
During the reveal of this season they said that TS will be active for 3 weeks instead of 2. That means the date of the release most likely is around the 12th
---
In my opinion, Ash losing her ACOG isn't a nerf, it's more of a rework, similar to Caviera. If you look at Pro League, many players are dropping the ACOG on attack and switching to Holo's because of the faster ADS time, which is more useful in the rush meta.
---
If all we have is a "leak" then we don't actually know anything about new Twitch Prime packs. So you're not going to get an answer.
---
I do the same thing üòÇ
---
Honestly, that rank is not that bad. It's above average.   
---
And be thankful you got a Legendary instead of a common duplicate.
---
He can still do that, he just needs to stand still in the smoke some times; but that wasn't really my main point; my main point is that Glaz isn't played as a sniper because sniping i  general isn't really effective in siege, and he usually doesn't do it significantly better than any other operator with a DMR. 
---
What if you accidentally shot a teammate with a shotgun 3 times? Current system already autokicks you after 2 kills.
---
Can someone explain why this is sad? Haven‚Äôt been keeping up with siege
---
Could have been a lot better
---
Appreciate the compliment, I‚Äôm just mad at myself for getting into the game so late. 
---
He's annoying yes. Unbalanced? maybe. He's countered by lesion pretty hard and good team play in general. 
---
I've seen this before. Explain yourself.
---
This guy knows
---
I can imagine. he could shoot through reinforced walls and shit.
---
I'd love to see more event modes like this, if only so they can expand on the lore and characters a bit. Who knew it would take a zombie outbreak to make me feel SAD for Jager?
---
&gt; He can still do that, he just needs to stand still in the smoke some times
---
So a completely different approach...
---
I'd rather a useless operator than a broken as shit one. 
---
Hey didn't Tuxbird name you in one of his videos??
---
what time zone?
---
Again, the scale is clearly presented to you and this is the only way it could have worked. They're not misleading anyone, they specifically added that scale to avoid that.
---
Lion, B
---
I didn't get to enjoy it because I only got three fps :(
---
I pulled something like that with my buddy playing Clash. We were on bank so people were peeking the windows into upstairs so I used his shield like that and domed the dude. 
---
Outbreak had too small of a schedule for a seperate story arc to even be worth considering.
---
There is someone with my user name on siege but no, thats someone else. I just use this name because all possible variations of my user name for everything else was taken.
---
Oh ok! I'll do that when I get home. Thank you
---
Not really, it's just a nerf.
---
You won't be able to do smoke pushes as easily but you can still do them, and they will still be Glaz's most powerful aspect. 
---
A kapkan or a lesion will reduce his effectiveness dramatically. 1 trap op (which you should have a majority of the time) isn't a huge sacrifice lmao. He's just annoying, not unbalanced. 
---
In other reddit post someone talk with Ubi support and they said there is no volcano skin if you buy it now. 
---
Yes the fuck we do 
---
Yeah I‚Äôd love to play it again. 
---
&gt; Not really, it's just a nerf.
---
In one iteration he can run and gun in smoke and see you perfectly. In the other he has to stand still for however many seconds before you can even be seen.
---
"Not really"
---
&gt; Microsoft probably didn't want to put any more money into the project.
---
Don‚Äôt you think there‚Äôs a possibility that could apply to Ubisoft as well?
---
I never played Outbreak and I regret it üò≠
---
And you only opened 46 holes.
---
He can fairly successfully. Tis somewhat of a risk though.
---
I miss it sometimes yeah. It was something to do that was fun at times than trying to deal with Ranked all the time
---
Aswell as contacting steam support I would check your other accounts. If someone can get into your steam they can sure as shit get into other stuff. How did you backup your recover codes? They would have needed those or access to your email to steal it. Plus all the extra info required to reset a password. 
---
(Me a Mira main) WHAT THE HECK IS THAT RECOIL
---
It'll probably drop on the 6th
---
Old Hereford was sm better
---
I don't even know who that is lol
---
Good point :/ but that mainly comes from her f2 and I'm not asking for the drones to be quieter of able to jump, just some more tasers, also Mozzie is basically a counter to twitch and in some instances you'll Can't get into places without sacrificing another drone

Great play mate! Trust me, the more you play Frost the cooler welcome mat kills you‚Äôll get and it‚Äôs glorious. I‚Äôve been a frost main since I started and it‚Äôs been amazing. 
---
It could do. Which is also not "for no reason". As I'm saying in every other comment: The mode was around for too short a time for any extra effort or money to be wasted on it. They certainly would never have considered 8 maps.
---
How can you see the enemy operators in the loading screen
---
Outbreak was honestly the best and I wish I had played it a little more
---
It‚Äôs odd. I liked playing them, but I did not like their use of efforts. For all the time they spent making those detailed levels, the community just slurped it up in an evening and said ‚ÄúNice. What else you got?‚Äù
---
Replayable content needs more intelligent design and reuse of game mechanics, which is why I think they shouldn‚Äôt do more things like this. If they have inventive game modes for people to play multiplayer on existing maps, I think that would make a lot more sense.
---
He is technically an information operator because he can see his gu mines and tell where people are with a little map knowledge. He can be a roamer because he needs to spread his gu mines around and go to where one was triggered.
---
Just make shield melee nonlethal god damnit!
---
Could you elaborate? I stopped following For Honor.
---
Thermite would cost 3RR. He both destroys in artifact and makes it so they can block. Mute would be white like a ghostly prison.  
---
What makes him annoying? The fact he can sprint, flash and shoot within 1 second? Is it the broken hitboxes? Is it the broken flashing mechanic where he can flash you even if you're a 3 speed sprinting away from him? 
---
What exactly is it that makes him annoying?
---
I Love the tat.    
---
And lets zero care about the "removal stuff and so"   
---
(I have a lot off tats of a other game there in my history here, and i will also never thinking about removing them on the moment)   
---
  
---
The fun thing about lesion is you can play him however you want because his gadget is super great at telling you where the enemy is coming from
---
Depends how you play him. I play him as a roamer
---
Yes he is but, he is also a good anchor.
---
Very sick art 
---
And those fresh ass kicks
---
I played siege for its tactical gameplay it was based on originally. Not to read a fan fiction of an operator.
---
Username checks out
---
It was not a good match - I joined that round, too. 
---
Thing we do for internet points. Glad you are here to get some too
---
We have no confirmation yet but looking at past seasons points to it dropping tomorrow. We are all currently waiting for ubisoft to confirm the date.
---
True. Then you just shouldn't be allowed to party up with anyone that isn't the same rank as you. 
---
It takes a lot of practice. I know it seems like you're not getting anywhere but when I played on PlayStation I was level 165 and I was still garbage. When I switched to Xbox I'm level 110 and I'm not to bad. I hit plat this season. It takes time and a lot of dedication. In 3 months I have over 1300 THunts. It may depend on what you play on and some people, no matter how much they play they will never improve
---
How do I download it through steam though if i've bought the game on uplay?
---
I see your a fellow player üé∏. Nice drone and Marshall amp.
---
It is though
---
Casual and ranked mm are the exact same system working on their queues respective data.
---
She worked on a farm that's why she is big
---
Also do you play ranked?
---
Rework, not buff.
---
Just make his primary the LMG, and give it a bipod as his gadget.  That way, he can still mount his LMG, but he can also be more mobile
---
It‚Äôs not the third in Montreal. 
---
Shhhhhh quiet! We don't want them to know!
---
You had a connection issue at the beginning though
---
It does
---
Yeah it kinda does makes me feel good about my doc cosplay and thanks üí™
---
April fools mode!
---
Ok, i think you need to understand something first, 1. console and pc are two very different platforms, 2. PC has a higher pixel count and faster screen time than console does, this is the main factor of why there should'nt be a cross platform between console and pc. Console would get wrecked if it was up against a pc in terms of acuraccy and speed.
---
Wouldnt that... Make her more in shape? Not fat..?
---
I may be one of those people
---
Isn't she First Nations?
---
PETA will confiscate that gun... and use it to shoot pigs at a farm. 
---
Those are dentist gloves i use 2 gloves on each hand
---
Is that true tho? Guessing you are a console player hahaha
---
No wanna about it
---
Why am I this fookin emotional over this
---
ü¶† Lesion
---
KPV is 100+ pounds why would anyone wanna lug that around, he should just have a decked out PKM with a bipod and be a filthy defense pointman 
---
She looked fine on the trailer but her current Ingame model looks strange
---
Wow you're just an asshole
---
Yep was bronze 3 last season and started at silver 4 in wb but now I'm copper 4 with 800 elo. I have a losing streak for weeks now.

Check the subs sidebar from a desktop browser (desktop browser is accessible from mobile too)
---
Wouldn't this be Rainbow Thicc Siege?
---
I agree with this statement. Casual is just a cesspool of toxicity. Players get kicked easily, team kills happen at higher rates because the games don't really matter, and rounds are too damn long. Ranked is the way to go. Yeah you might hit silver or bronze, but you will improve every season. 
---
You could tell that was console by how rigid it was with the movement
---
What operators do you use? You might be using guns with too much recoil 
---
If you think about that for even a second you might notice how dumb that is.
---
*People abuse a thing, instead of attempting to fix it just remove it entirely.*
---
It‚Äôs the teammate version of the braindead individual who gets their drone killed in the opening 20 seconds of the prep phase and then makes it their unconscious mission to get your carefully placed drone destroyed by keeping their stubby dorito dusted finger on the X key. 
---
What happened to the fifth? 
---
I think you missed the point.
---
Tomorrow
---
I haven‚Äôt seen this glitch for a couple months totally thought they fixed it but guess not. 
---
Bitch, she ain‚Äôt underrated 
---
It's the best event that Ubi has had. They should really bring it back.
---
Ash mains are converting themselves to another 3 speed
---
You would need to buy it again
---
It's Ubisoft not EA
---
This is just not true though. The only site that is overly one-sided is the top floor in favor of the defenders (which is terrible and needs to be fixed), but the rest of the sites aren't that broken at all.
---
Old Hereford was absolutely terrible, with the only site that could be defened was basement, and even that was near impossible.
---
Bro dont worry im copper 4 too. It gets a lot easier when your teammates talk to you. Ive had a few games in ranked recently where my teammates dont talk, besides the ones I grouped with before. 
---
OH SHIT HERE COMES THATCHER
---
I've using forst and iq with the commando
---
Thanks I figured it out
---
Thanks dude ^^
---
Yeah, this guy blames all his internet issues on the game. He's really just a toxic 14 years old on a meaningless crusade.

His LMG feels unfair using it. It has a very high fire rate and has lots of bullets. Still surprised it hasn't received a nerf.

Hello skaaaaaaa, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ax8meb/when_burnt_horizon_is_dropping/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I just thought i posted it in the wrong time zone, my friends suggested i post it at night in my country for better results.
---
I don't have my games recorded but I can say that it is totally false or not working as intended. I had completely different experience when playing casual and for some time checked enemy team every match. In like 80% of the time I was placed against plat/diamond player, no such thing in ranked.
---
I would like it back but it got boring after about 2 days of playing it as it was the same thing everytime. With that said, if they were to add it back, hopefully there'd be new stuff added.
---
Already added you
---
Get rid of the round 1 lost part and it would look great.
---
Yep...and it was patched around almost instantly 
---
Kind of a stupid question tbh.
---
they did
---
i agree
---
My boi Rocket League was in there since its release! Love to see that!
---
Mira and Jackal have two shotguns, you mean the big one or the small one? 
---
He was injured in the corner and I didn't realize for another 30 seconds 
---
Did you even read what I wrote?
---
The systems work on the data from their queue only. You play more ranked it seems so the data it has on you is more accurate.
---
I can foresee that Maestro will be next in the "ACOG removal catastrophe"
---
Well, since the defender has no real gadget, (1) you are giving up valk or bandit for her in order to get the two extra reinforcements. (2) having two extra reinforcements does not take away the obj's vulnerability. (2a) you are down a person (if he left or you team killed him before he put his reinforcements) , well 2 more reinforcements. (2b)  normally on most maps it would only be used to cover flanks away from the obj, since on (most) maps 10 reinforcements should be enough to cover all the soft walls. 
---
No i understand the point you want rank system to be like csgo, but before that they have to fix ranking system my friend finished his last2 season plat and this seaon eventhough he was in first spot and won most of his games he started silver 2 so if i am not going to play with him beacuse i am plat 2 yath fuck that shit brah
---
Yes 
---
I agree
---
There is, and you get reconnected if you requeue.
---
Send it! - Marley
---
Well it‚Äôs not like he has any other options since the shotgun is garbage.
---
Need room to see it 
---
Against noobs with crap aim, he‚Äôs op. Against people that throw impacts and shoots a hundred bullets at the feet and shoulders... not so much.
---
If attackers are semi-decent you wont be able to control the lobby. No matter what strat you come up with. Thats why you wont see even attempts to hold the lobby in pro league, even in challenger league where the level is way lower.
---
Hibana, spinning in to competition
---
If you queue for ranked again it'll put you back in your match as long as you didn't abandon.
---
Need rook to see it
---
It makes no sense either lmao i mean it‚Äôs that that good of a game
---
Am console player. Can confirm.

I did make this.

You just click on ranked again to search and it puts you back into the game.

---
I never thought I'd ever see a payday meme again.
---
We need an operator who drops medic bags.
---
Oh ok my bad 
---
I mained him when i first started playing and i always turned to the side when reloading so my shield blocks bullets.
---
Because there was a player on the enemy team with a similar low level
---
He must find his own way to push forward out of the Gulag, and in order to do that, he must be able to load his own LMG, and strike down the hostages.
---
*sigh* this weeb shit again
---
How would you feel about the idea of Ash's gadget becoming an underbarrel attachment like bucks skeleton key, removing her access to a grip thus making recoil worse, making her guns require a bit more in terms of skill with recoil management, but also giving her a slightly better gadget in return and making her a bit more utility based? 
---
Nice clutch but what in the actual fuck was that last guy doing....ZERO need to push that at all. Get an angle and wait it out. Big oof

Still, dope ass clutch for sure. 10/10

I just wanna piggy back on this. Is Nomad broken? I play Nomad a lot, she is very fun. But if an airjab is involved in me getting a kill, that enemy didn't have a chance (most of the time). I guess you could argue that they should have waited me out, as the attacker Nomad does have to push forward eventually. But it's almost a foolproof flank/corner watch. 
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. I'm eating Cheetos.

Siege can even die faster (...)? Rainbow Six are not games like Skyrim that can live and live for ages after release. Maybe some people would replay missions to do them differently, but generally singeplayer r6 game would die rather quickly. Siege is here for few years now and game as well as player base is only getting bigger and bigger and it's pretty unlikely to die anytime soon.

He's 1 speed (which is particularly awful on attack), and his gadget is way, way too risky to use in almost all situations, and isn't even useful on most sites in the game. He can only be realistically used on sites with destructible floors above (unless he wants to be instantly killed) and even there his pucks have much more bark than bite, and he's still at significant risk of being flanked, c4'd from below or just outright shot.
---
He's not completely unusable, especially against less coordinated teams, but at a high level he's just too risky for what's often little to no payoff.

Luckily the game is rated 17+/18 depending on the country, so most likely the other players will be responsible adults.

True, but if your going to have an LMG I want to fire a truck load of bullets without reloading. While playing capitao I had many times where having the 100 bullets was the sole reason I survived.

This is your opinion and i respect it, thats why we need an ability to choose maps to play in ranked

Operators get reduced by 5000 renown for every year they've been in the game. Year 3 Season 1 operators (Finka + Lion) will probably be 20,000, but Y2S4 -&gt; Y2S2 ops will be 20,000. Y2S1 -&gt; Y1S2 will be 15,000. Frost + Buck will probably be 10,000, or will be in 3 months time.

Nothing to do with opinion. They are broken.

Somehow managed to get a double kill with Jackals secondary shotgun, I was dumbfounded but it was also point blank.

It's like that all over, they hold the rules like Moses has them on the back of the ten commandments with no room for grey area.

Anyone got a guess on what time it‚Äôs dropping?

You're joking yeah?

Rainbow Six boots me out of a game in like 25% of my ranked matches. I can't rejoin either, I just get an infinite loading screen when I try. 
---
I don't really care about my rank so I don't care that much about the ELO penalty, but it's pretty annoying that I can't queue for 15 minutes. Please don't make that even worse. 
---
I'd play more casual (it boots me out of casual too) but it has a horrendous ruleset. 
---
We are also not to good but we are a groupo friends playing to much, what languages are you comfortable with and what do you want to do? Chill in casual are become the next pro? A bit more information about you would be nice

Yea, i hope they listen because i can‚Äòt wait a whole season for such a good rework
---
thirsty bois asking for stl, do some work?

You know op is the source right ?
---
It means he's going back to how he is on the live servers rn, I.E he doesn't have volumetricly spread fire like he did for the first few versions of the TS lately. 
---
At this point that's your opinion, and I won't argue the matter of if it's fair or not.
---
But you may want to write in a post next time the fact you got melee'd, because the way you wrote it it seemed like a completely random issue.

Lol, he died of an overdose.  Fentanyl.

KOST would be really cool, but if I remember correctly, it's tracked manually. Kills or objective plays or survival are easy enough to track, but I don't know if they could track trades accurately.
---
Some kid who died of a drug overdose, his friends begged Ubisoft to give him something, and they gave him an arcade.  Why?  Good question.
---
They have - I just saw a video of a Rogue 9 interview on this. Basically it‚Äôs too difficult for them to do this because there is too small of a population of players in high ranks that it would be unfair to them; matchmaking would be far too long for them and there are chances they might not find games at all if their games were restricted to high rank players only. They‚Äôre looking into it but the solution is not a simple one.

Hello rooperttiino,

Why was Montagne banned more than blitz??

This needs to be an elite animation for someone. The little smile at the end is too reminiscent of one.

Good? Old Hereford may be controlled by attackers from outside stairs.

House literally dont playable coz freaking bad design in terms of runout. 
---
I kinda love old map but its will be big mistake bring this maps in Ranked.
---
I think this is a great change. If you think about it, her ability can be super powerful. It affects every player and goes on indefinitely until defenders completely stop what they are doing, roaming, holding angles, etc, and have to go through a few second animation where they are completely vulnerable, all the while letting off a huge audio cue of where they are. Even if her weapons are sub-par, her entire team benefits hugely from it. There's a reason she's used and banned quite often in PL. 
---
Thank you

Rook is Thiccer

You are our best friend please don‚Äôt betray us

Outbrake was too boring after 3-4 matches, even if u play on hard. If Ubi make new cooperative mod, but make it more unscripted and unpredictable, it will be more and more fun and coop expirience than Outbreak's
---
They‚Äôll most likely transfer over to twitch mains over iq

Yeah i would advise buying things from store if you are not looking for athing that only comes from alpha packs. But i know how it feels like. At a point i had 76000 renown and i was saving it for the Dimond skin.

Than i blew it all on other skins.

I regret living right now.

Take my word and gather it, don't blow it on skins or alpha packs.

It only works in Thunt, they both have normal destruction in PvP

Yeah I'm not super happy about that. My guess is "resets" weren't really intended by ubi. They might not like the fact people are downing friendlies to get that extra bit of health. It will take some getting used to, but I'm sure it will be fine.

Well I always feel that he could just do with a little more, like I‚Äôm always left feeling underwhelmed.

as soon as a famous pro cries about something, it becomes a fact which is really stupid. pengu kept bitching about how clash is super OP and will destroy in proleague, how he and kantoreketti could 2v5 an entire team with her, etc etc

then she barely gets picked and when she does its often a loss in proleague... lol

Yup that‚Äôs ranked... you‚Äôre punished more for losing than you are rewarded for winning. Just how it goes.

You could shoot a one bullet hole in a wall and shoot a fire bolt through it to deny huge areas. Because the bolts fall to the floor, it doesn't matter if you aim over or under the correct objects. You could shoot over some reinforcements to deny bandit tricking, miras, and any defenders there. You could burn the entirety of small closet in Oregon through a single bullet hole in the floor. 
---
The size of the bolts is fine is they don't have the propagation system that drops the bolts to the floor. They're also fine if the keep the propagation with the current smaller size. With both, you can shoot an area such as half wall in armory on border, and it will cover the wall, the area behind the wall, and any objects that you can vault on top of, making it an instant death
---
Combined with the fact that the bolts themselves have no counters (ADS don't catch them, cannot shoot them out of the air) makes them OP in the TTS version
---
&gt;most fan art is shit and just jerk bait, also fuck anime
---
That's what I think
---
If i buy it today will i get it?
---
If your team has more people than the enemy team at the end you get less Elo or if you have better players ie plat 3, silver 4, gold 1, bronze 4, bronze 4 against team of silvers and vice versa
---
Should be 2 sledge hits, 15 melee strikes electrify able and he should get only 2 of them also maybe no space for drones. Also take twice as long as regular barricades to place of take down. 
---
right now you can already do that on oregon, and confirm the kill on her with your 2 bolts as the fire goes through the wall
---
Where the fuck is IQ? 
---
It's 500, not "Soo".

I'll trust you since you a sledge main

It's like a fucking creeper

This will be the first season I don‚Äôt give a shit about getting to plat, no point.

Isn't that sorta frowned upon by ubi? I'm not completely certain, but I think his "buff" wouldn't allow the fire to go through walls.
---
I asked the same question - I‚Äôm dying to hear any kind of response to this. It literally drives me mad.
---
Nobody cares in casual. TF2 casual is just that, casual. There is always a large abundance of new players at any given time anyway, so one more will never hurt

The thing is everytime I see the scoreboard the teams seem pretty even. I have also lost 110 points despite playing 4v5 pretty much from the 1st round.
---
My last game was -130. Teams were like:
---
- bronze, bronze, bronze, silver, bronze (mine)
---
- bronze, bronze, bronze, gold, cooper (opponents)
---
Pretty sure the rank divisions were very close as well.
---
That would be making the graph much harder to understand all for the benefit of one single game. It's not worth it.

If that was me sledge would've 1 tapped me considering my luck.

No it just makes it easier to read, no more sliding axis‚Äô just one standard X axis and scale. The info doesn‚Äôt change it‚Äôs just easier to read

No, the people who play it are just a bunch of man children who yank their dick to imaginary video game characters. And Ubisoft happily encourages it by constantly releasing Disney Princess operators.

Yeah, I‚Äôve seen pics but this is my first time seeing it in person.  The cover art is awesome

On console (at least on Xbox) many players at high ranks crash the servers when they are about to lose, so they don‚Äôt take a loss by cancelling the match with a ‚Äúserver connection error‚Äù - is Ubisoft award of this? Is there any way to combat this and stop it from happening? Is there anything I can do as a player to report such people?
---
Also what system?
---
We can just make Thatcher's EMP map wide???

Yess i believe so

can a 12yo be classified a neckbeard if they cant even grow one?
---
Hi there jamming buddy!
---
I don‚Äôt see where I insulted the artist‚Äôs work, but alright. 
---
&gt; just how it goes
---
Nope, there is a system calculating the average MMR's. If you are consistently losing more than you are gaining you are consistently playing against teams that on average (or total, doesn't matter) have a lower MMR than your team. 
---
A higher ranked team will lose more points playing against a lower ranked team (say a team of plats lose to golds, they lose a lot as they shouldn't be losing to golds). If a team of plats win against golds they won't gain as much of course, as they were supposed to win.
---
It's a pretty neat system
---
Going into Y4 and this is yet another old bug that's not been fixed. Classic Ubisoft

Hello Nick! How's yer mum?

Any title beach headset will get the job done. I have stealths which are pretty good

Depends on the game. Recent example I can think of is Kingdom Hearts 3. I've been a fan of the series since it started and have waited a long time for the 3rd and "final" game to be released. I thought about taking release day off so I could binge through it, partially because I just wanted to play it and partially because I was worried that if I didn't beat it right away, I would see spoilers online within a couple of days.
---
I cant understand them to play the game, but it is so awful when you shoot sb in his head with your whole magazine, and than he kills you and isnt hurt.
---
It's not misleading, I didn't get to play a single round.
---
Thanks its been annoying me for the past 2 weeks
---
Honestly, I don't miss it one bit. Overall, it was pretty bad IMO. I played it through once and that was plenty enough.
---
Yea this definetly should have thousands of upvotes
---
Nah I'm being serious I can easily server hop in west coast no issues for casual. There is no server restriction else how could people get multiple ranks in each server

Okay this is a really good drawing but...she looks a bit off you know? When comparing the in game face to this...XD

Because they‚Äôre free spirited strong women god damnit. Do their stomachs hurt your fragile masculinity? DO THEY?!?!

She's a 1 speed so literally no one will play her in ranked.
---
There's debate about her utility in competitive play, she will probably be played only when nomad is banned.
---
Jk 
---
But your only taking in account of the middle pellet with the shotties they have more than 1 inculding lets say 5 more your doing way more damage and within  range of shotties you can snipe people indoors down hallways and corners and runaway and chip them off with a single pellet
---
Its 300gb of videos

doesn't matter, even reporting with hard proof wont get him banned, especially if he has a season pass

Holy shit if you'd excuse me I'm gone for a while

I don't think you've seen the mods for r/destinythegame. They basically remove any post directly criticizing Bungie's decisions
---
Thousands of hours? Based on what? I have 500h and almost all of operators. With standard edition, no booster packs, no r6 credits or whatsoever. And I'm not even playing ranked (which gives the most renown) that much. Most of this time is casual. Even Thunt took a lot more of my time than ranked. I do weekly challenges sometimes, but with no particular caring.
---
If I cared about grinding I could've easily have all operators at least 100h ago, but I play for fun and operators just drop in from time to time.
---
Oh that must be new because I bought the year 3 pass in June 2018 and I still got the 600 Credits. So I had no idea that they introduced a new system
---
Bro orange lining up one at a time to politely let you shoot them is what cost them the round.
---
You'd have to print that out and have it taped to your screen to remember all those rules.  
---
how about the only rule is loser pays.
---
this needs to get solved. it's a huge yikes.
---
So no lion, glaz or capitao rework this season..  FeelsBadMan
---
the whole point of the fucking buff was to rework shotguns so the middle pellet exists as a different entity to the rest with only that one having a headshot multiplier. The other pellets sure they'll still do damage but if you're within shotgun range you're still better off aiming for the body.
---
Nah man, I'm married, and plus, Ela's a videogame character, that's just weird.

Where's IQ?

And if your not you can still one shot from a far or chip damage them your still going to be stronger than dmrs and glazez sniper for being able to do that
---
Its still a bad idea to make shot guns have a 100% accuarte pellet even without red dot even fair to be fight against
---
I wish that was in matchmaking it would make life so much better.

The overall seems pretty accurate:

Ela - (1.73m)

Ash - (1.70m)

Finka - (1.71m)

I was excited to be able to use shield ops without getting shot through my shield but I guess Ubi is fine with them being broken as always...

The R4-C and 552 Commando are the main guns I use for attack. 416 and MP9 for defense. Always nades and breaching charges, or impacts and barbed wire. The only true handicap I would agree with is the 1 reinforcement on defense.

What the fuck, if you hit the headshot you deserve to win the fight, the point isn't the fucking hipfire at the head you aim in with your shotgun and shoot them in the head, that's fucking much easier to do than praying that you got their head in the dead centre of your crosshair, Chip damage means like 10 damage because of drop off, you're not stronger than any dmrs.

In mid-February they eliminated the starter edition and dropped the price on the standard edition to $20, at which time they reinstated the renown unlock progression for the base operators.
---
They cost 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 renown depending on how many operators you have unlocked already from the original units. For comparison, you get about 200-500 renown for each game you play, so you'll unlock at least one op in each play session when you start out, which is more than enough for you to learn.
---
*time to fuck shit up!!! *
---
I wernt scrolling through the sub because I had better things to do, the fact that you‚Äôre here arguing over a question tells me you do not (have anything better to do) does that break it down for you mate or do you need someone to read it to you?
---
TF2 Will never give up!
---
Yes but ela is like any other roaming op, she has utility to help her roam with a high firing gun with a high mag size and she‚Äôs a three speed 
---
Are we sure they dont have a controller
---
They were but reverted the change after they remove the starter edition which didn't even include base ops if I'm correct
---
its the 6th
---
Anytime
---
theres a walk button to go slower, i think thats what you mean
---
Thats how I roll
---
But her SMG is shit.  She isn't a good op man.  I use her, too.  I use her and Alibi, and I can safely say hands down Alibi is better.  
---
Just use the G36C? It's still an above average gun with no recoil. 
---
Holy shit why haven‚Äôt  people learned to keep the final product on for longer than 5 seconds.

who‚Äôs the green-haired one?
---
Thanks love üòò
---
Wdym I‚Äôm in gold 3 on console and I can control the recoil on he shotgun it‚Äôs easy
---
When I try tapping, I still get jerky movement. Perhaps a matter of practice?
---
Hi All, that's a wrap for the podcast today.  I just wanted to drop by and say a massive thank you for all the questions.
---
We did our best to ask Epi as many as we could!  I hope some of you got the answers you wanted. :)
---
Thanks again,
---
Pete.
---
Fuck offfff
---
Your first comment was literally‚Äô its pinned in the sub‚Äô so beg to differ all you wantüòÇ and if you feel that strongly about it I suggest you do something about it mate
---
&gt;the fact that you‚Äôre here arguing over a question 
---
Telling you that you should be able to find information yourself*-
---
&gt; does that break it down for you mate or do you need someone to read it to you?
---
Perfect. Just one problem in that what you wrote doesn't mean that whatsoever.
---
"The fact your here arguing over a question just tells me you don‚Äôt (You) need to be on reddit all day to see a post made before this one?
---
The turret positioning is relatively poor. All the would need to do is ping you once, and any of the windows behind you could be blind fired through for an ez kill.
---
Console has less recoil than pc 
---
 It‚Äôs really not tho, it has a high fire rate with a high mag size, yes alibi is better, but out of the ops the guy doesn‚Äôt have I would say he should get Ela
---
I get it when slow-walking. On normal speed its worse, I think.
---
&gt; Your first comment was literally‚Äô its pinned in the sub‚Äô so beg to differ all you want
---
So in your mind 60 is a smaller number than 27?
---
&gt;and if you feel that strongly about it I suggest you do something about it mate
---
haha the scum trying to be a hardman
---
Who tf has an rpg in rainbow that is definitely a butt plug 
---
Still no sound fix for console? :( it is almost a year now i guess???
---
r/R6STeams
---
Does that apply to Frost mats as well? 
---
The streamers I mean are guys like Macie and z1ronicdk, PC players.
---
i play on 16:10 but I think Beaulo plays on 4:3
---
Yeah this is still a problem on console.  The issue is that shields desync from player movements.  Your shield will be pointed straight forward on your screen, but on the defender‚Äôs screen it‚Äôll be pointed the opposite direction.   
---
Ubisoft is most likely aware of the issue, but it would be an absolute nightmare to diagnose and fix, so I think that‚Äôs why there‚Äôre refusing to acknowledge the issue.
---
i wish they took the backpack from 2nd photo, abd used it on the 1st one. 
---
trust me on this one you won‚Äôt regret it
---
Bro it came out last month? R u dumb
---
Oh well the female OPs are all ridiculous. Like they're all 99th percentile for females 
---
it will come out in 6th okay

Good point, been a while since playing gayday
---
Thank you, are there like online tournaments for fun or anything of that nature 
---
And what comes nex, my good sons, is from Gods mouth to your ears. And i will make it hurt, for rest of your miserable fooking lifes. 
---
Yeah i know by now
---
Im pretty sure Beaulo plays on 16:10

As a casual player I loved old Hereford. It was so fun to play in. Ubisoft screwed up with the design for new hereford. They should have kept the same concrete style of Hereford. Making it all brick makes it look like a completely different base. That is something people did not ask for.
---
His Shotgun DMR has very little recoil. Ive been consistently using it purely because of how easy it is to use. Other DMRs like bucks or twitch's are harder to use. Do you want it to have 0 recoil? 
---
Well I was backing up my knowledge with evidence.
---
Side note: Ubi needs to redo the bios of most every OG operator
---
i always go solo ranked and have gold 3 rank. Dont forget to give callouts and communicate
---
You get a MMR like you do in Ranked - only you dont get told what it is. Thus in theory its possible to be a "Casual Diamond", but you'll never know what your rank it. 
---
This creates a massive issue because as a Diamond Ranked player - i have no interest in playing casual. Too toxic, etc for me and i dont find it useful. However, if i was to play casual - i would be unranked, in the Silver/Gold level...... yet im a Diamond ranked player. 
---
This creates the issue the skill in casual is extremely well spread out - the best casual players will likely be Golds because they are the only ones playing it enough without going into Ranked in order to get the theoretical Casual Diamond. 
---
Basically it causes a lot of weird stuff to happen - coppers are unlikely to leave a casual game as well so their casual ranks dont go down in the way some ranked players might when they quit out after dying etc. 
---
You should have written fook instead of fuck
---
I pray that their souls may repent before judgement day. The Father Russia will surely devour them if they refuse.

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
I ***NEED*** ~~A MEDIC BAG~~ SOME NANOBOTS
---
But it really is.  He should get Lesion.  Lesion is lightyears ahead of Ela.
---
Better guns, better gadget, access to impacts, able to effectively roam or anchor.  
---
What makes Ela a better pick than Alibi or Lesion?  Sure, he already has Alibi, but not Lesion.
---
You're delusional if you think Ela's better than Lesion, and this is coming from a person who's mained Ela since day one.
---
That the game woukd be space efficient if it needed to be.
---
It was a checkpoint-based Horde mode, like Left4Dead. A one-time, 1month even to unlock exclusive skins.
---
Because somebody can make actually good art? 
---
Really? she is much worse than I thought. I was planning to stop playing roamers for a couple of weeks, but not anymore. Thanks for the info
---
Ahh it was reverted. I see. Okay. Thank you guys for the reply!
---
I wouldn't say Echo is broken, but ever since he has gotten 2 drones imo he might be a little too strong. And Nomad isn't a problem in ranked play, but in PL she might be considered a little broken due to the fact that you're literally defenseless after you get hit by an airjab.
---
Central and East coast 
---
PepeHands
---
I think favela should be removed, and the old hereford should take its place. Then we could have a great map back, and get rid of a horrible map.
---
Boy, do i have news for you. 
---
Yeah, it's really annoying as well, because I'm a big destiny fan ( been playing since vanilla D1)  and if I want a subreddit where I can frequent and get news about the game, while also sharing thoughts about it, I don't really have a good middle ground to be in. I can choose to either see only negative posts that just make me sad about the game, or I can choose to see only positive posts, but I'm not allowed to express any concern about the development. I've since chosen to frequent r/destiny2 since then, I at least don't get depressed constantly.
---
Funny thing is though, r/destiny2 was literally created as a response to the constant negativity that was running rampant on r/destinythegame after the game's initial release. Ironically, it ended up being just as bad, in a complete opposiste manner.
---
Well thanks i'll just try to be patient with idiot randoms sorry if i just seem angry as hell it's because i am it's quite frustrating that they can just kill you like that and they don't get shit but when you do it boom insta ban.
---
Well I guess, but for those who dont know hes from Boston, like me, it looks like its nyc
---
What
---
OP doesn't have to play recruit if he doesn't want to.
---
Was I the only one who didn‚Äôt give a single shit about it? 
---
yeah I guess so, I think I was off last time I did the math, but it still takes too long for it to be worth it for me. 
---
You're right, but if they see these comments then they'll know so I guess it works out.
---
&gt; Cav counters her because you can silently take out Airjabs, clear out Airjabs in corners with Impacts, and pop up behind her and eliminate her.
---
....do you place your air jabs on the floor in front of a door or something? You place it above on as high as you can to stop defenders from entering through the door. You cant impact those jabs let alone shoot em/see without getting jabed. 
---
I've found that you can sometimes get news on upcoming events for the game over on r/raidsecrets. But I haven't been over there in a while. I took a break shortly after black armory for some life stuff.
---
So I wasn't insane when said camera is not aligned properly with head model when leaning!
---
I see what you mean now
---
Good point
---
I don't team kill at all matter of fact i try to avoid it as much as possible but sometimes when i'm having a bad day and i just wanna play some games on Siege and some idiots just team kills me for no reason i just suddenly have the urge to do the same and mind you i don't randomly kill anyone on the team i kill those who did it to me or who was part of it
---
I usually leave mine where I‚Äôm going to push from. You can typically figure out where the team will be defending before the round even starts. So if I‚Äôm pushing from main lobby on chalet to get hatches with Hibana, I‚Äôll leave it near there so I can drone quickly when I‚Äôm ready. 
---
I started to miss it when it was removed. 
---
Good job, keep goin
---
Hawt squad bois
---
Thank you :)
---
how'd you figure that one out Columbo?
---
What I don't get though is why they just wouldn't do a separate older build of the game (a bit like TTS) with Outbreak still included. Of course that would mean a lot of bugs which have been fixed since then are still there, but it shouldn't hurt when you can only play PvE on already optimized maps. Renown and XP could be transferred to the live build.
---
I want the photo in the back
---
Huh, I heard that they gave up in casual mmr but I guess not. Is your placement partially determined by your ranked position? because I'm bronze rn so that might explain it. 
---
they removed everything i was looking towards to. what a disappointment
---
I think being creative is better. If everyone uses pro spots, you know where to check.
---
U play PS4?
---
Let me just grab my magnifying glass right quick
---
Ok
---
Just about got it
---
Almost....
---
Oh he just turned to the right a bit
---
*Chokes on 8 ball *
---
A sacrifice must be made to use the mighty LMG in combat
---
I use my first done to look for roamers in areas I plan to push first. for instance on coastline if they are master bedroom I always put a done in trophy room or lounge and just monitor the areas around it. i keep my second drone so I can put it in the obj late when it's less likely for someone to give away there position to shoot a drone. 
---
This is no way close to an anime drawing
---
That‚Äôs funny cause Blackbeard is still very strong. Also Lion did need a nerf and I‚Äôd rather him be underpowered than overpowered. You‚Äôre the one bitching without reason.
---
No it‚Äôs chill
---
The anchors for the most part will have multiple jager ADS inside the obj to take care of the airjabs. Airjabs are not a major issue for anchors, its a anti roamer/flank tool in the current meta. 
---
You keep saying cav counters nomad, that makes no sense. How can a cav shoot a airjab that they cant see without getting triggered? Impacts dont work on a well placed airjab. 
---
Echoing a nomad doesnt counter the airjab, thats like saying echo counters lion or jackal. Echo charging a nomad doesnt make flanks easier when she already have the jabs planted. 
---
It‚Äôs more balanced than Favela and I miss it lots
---
Okay thank you :)
---
We also need punishment for mass team killers or the game should have a system that can recognise people who purposely underperform/ throw games.For example, they can‚Äôt be a plat 2 and going 0-4, if they‚Äôve just gone 5-1 in the previous game. 
---
Literally as I read through this post, the whole enemy team wiped themselves out to make it a 5v2 when it was 3-0. Soon as we start attacking, the last two guys blew themselves up with a C4. Fucking hell its great being in Silver 2
---
There's people complaining about the rework.  Maybe you're not, but there's still a ton of people complaining about it.
---
I agree!
---
Honestly, yeah. i've seen people do some crazy things with it.
---
It has been that way since the long long ago, even in the time before the operation of health. 
---
Then don't play ranked? 
---
There‚Äôre only 5 of them, and the colors of their shirts aren‚Äôt even rainbow. Literally unplayable.
---
It released month ago my dude
---
Same here brother
---
I miss the aesthetics of old hereford so bad :,(
---
Bro this thread/replies to your comments are the dumbest thing i heard since lions Juststandstill bs. 
---
like how the hell is shooting trap that you cant even see without triggering a counter. 
---
Yes! We need back hotpotato! 
---
Hello ghosttalon1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/axdwcl/can_someone_explain_how_this_kill_is_not_bullshit/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I wouldn't mind if they brought the map back to the Casual pool. I mean, it's in the game anyways and on Casual I give no shit if it's balanced or not. House and plane are two of my favorite maps and the reworked Hereford feels kind of *dead*
---
And your poor
---
Im silver 3 but get placed against Plat 2- Diamond in my casual games on my alternate account. It‚Äôs not fun but what surprises me is that I‚Äôll get 2-3 kills and go positive half the time but I‚Äôll do shit in some ranked games against people who are silver. I just don‚Äôt get it
---
I asked the Ubi support team earlier today if I would get it and was bummed that they said I wouldn't. Just bought it now and got the skin :D thanks for letting us know you got it
---
i got it :)!! 
---
I really miss Old Hereford in PVP.
---
Why couldn't they just have both maps in rotation (Old/New) or just renamed the new Hereford as something completely different.
---
You could always be the one who drones if you do a better job at it :)
---
This is Siege on Xbox I‚Äôm a Nutshell.
---
What... Is this??
---
So that whole thing about having the season pass and getting the ops a week before the people who dont is bullshit? Or does the new season start and everyone that doesn't habe ot has to wait another week.
---
Easy. It's Ash. Her whole thing is "bullshit". Her blazing peek speed? Bullshit. Her hitbox? Bullshit. TTK with her guns? Bullshit. Her gadget? Bullshit. 
---
She herself is bullshit incarnate. There is no escaping.
---
It's not tho lol
---
Did he lose it?
---
Is it too late to get the Volcano skin today?

Watch that pick rate and win vector go down, down, down. No breaching utility, and the nerf that never ends. All you need to do now is add SMG kick to her DMR and you'll have attacking Ela :)

Think Wednesday but the new the r6 trackor says that I'm unranked when I am ramked
---
right? haha
---
OMG now I've got to do something for r6 for mine in my design class
---
no, because then you're guessing and if I'm clutching I don't want 4 people's guesses in my ears that I can make myself, I want to hear enemies
---
True but I think Jimmy fits mozzie, Both are crack heads

Season Pass holders get them for the first week of the operation. All non pass holders must wait a week before purchasing the new operators.

Oh ill just delete my comment now, you may if you want

No harm in it, Might keep it for others who dont know the context

Thats so weird. I assumed that it would br the other way around. Thanks.
---
You have issues. Feeling superior as hell, what the fuck man?
---
Since when people must be nationalist as fuck about a game? It isn‚Äôt dying, you‚Äôre creating yourself a problem. You come here with a pessimistic vision that doesn‚Äôt correlate the reality of things, say that everyone thinks it but man...you‚Äôre alone.
---
I and many other people (including op) think that bandit shouldn‚Äôt be bald, also the tattoos aren‚Äôt really done correctly so they look like they came out of bo1
---
this only works for new people/friends, but for people that have been playing this game for awhile with great knowledge, and people like backseat gaming or calling out things that are wrong, is the worst thing you can do
---
Rip comment. You can prolly edit your comment to make it more descriptive idk.
---
Just a rework is fine
---
He‚Äôs undercover in a biker gang it makes *perfect* sense for him to be bald
---
Yeah that's a great suggestion 
---
All maps should be in casual even if they're broken and they should put the map preference back in for cas
---
Hell yeah. Can I get a dm of info. Uplay/steam, discord, stuff like that 
---
based on the same logic
---
OPs teammates also aren't forced to try to win... they are free to throw any games they feel like
