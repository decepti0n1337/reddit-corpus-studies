Just what I was thinking. Instead of making one gun sub-par and giving the other a huge buff, he can have two equally competitive weapons. Options are nice. I can see where one would be good while the other would flop.

---
However, Dokkaebi doesn't really need two DMRs. But, that's just me.
---
---
---
Yes, you may. There will be people that allow it. There will also be people who don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the fun of casual. Like it or not
---
Woah woah woah. Basic Teamwork, in my public matches? Get out of here with your witchcraft.

i agree

That would be awesome, maybe you would unlock them by having ops in that ctu

Am I wrong?
---
I personally don‚Äôt tk someone for not picking recruit.. however it will always make me laugh watching a caveira get her head blown off with a m870 for refusing to conform
---
Casual is nothing more than just casual, as you say yourself. You shouldn‚Äôt be forced into doing anything in casual. By that logic, would you tell a player new to the game to put up with griefing? Because that‚Äôs what this encourages.
---
But I already installed the new update
---
That‚Äôs a retarded suggestion. Maybe if Vigil had an actually viable alternative, but outside of being annoying at best, the bosg could never be a viable primary, acog or not.
---
Agreed
---
Wait nvm it's working now, thanks
---
Same issue

I usually wait a minute or two if the chat is friendly  to leave. You don't lose any points from leaving.

Is it too much to ask for a "what cunt" or "fuck off" voice line with either the elite or normal mozzie?
---
But it could be more fun in a not competitive context.

No. But I also have played R6 since launch and have dealt with it myself... I choose to not let it make me mad. R6 has always had this problem and I‚Äôve learned to embrace it. It‚Äôs Fn hilarious at times. Even on the receiving end it sometimes tickles me. I‚Äôd be sad to not see it anymore honestly... it‚Äôs kinda part of the casual experience at this point to me

Looks like he just flicked, if you have high enough sensitivity and a little bit of luck, it looks like mnk. I've been accused before, I thought it was pretty funny because I don't think my aims that good.

I mean technically but there‚Äôs no enforcement for it

How about the Russian one and when the enemy shoots you it Yells"SUKA BLYAT!!!" It plays tri poloski then it forces the clock to stop and you all start slave squatting.

Simulation doesnt mean vr. They mean it's just a training exercise for the ops. I'm sure they have activities outside of the scenarios that they do to train.

That was the best purchase I made in that game and I want that so bad

It is in terms of it being Ash's. It doesn't have the highest DPS, but low recoil and high fire rate make it insanely frag-friendly. DPS isn't everything, tell that to Fuze!
---
 Yes i want snoop dogg doing my callouts like in cod ghosts
---
They are not chickening out. Core Siege players that understand the game know that the concept of 1v1 in Siege is stupid since the game is built around teamplay and overall team coordination etc.
---
It is not a game for solo play, the sum of the parts is more important than any single cog in the team.
---
The whole premise of the game requires you to be a good cog in a war machine, i.e. Work with the team and not have a lone wolf mentality. 1v1 is a joke/meme in Siege.
---
It would be like playing COD and asking for a pillow fight when you lose. Siege players see it as sad/pathetic and ignorant of what makes Siege...well Siege.
---
I only saw console players ask for 1v1s. Does not happen on PC in my experience except when used ironically or knowingly as a meme.
---
Have you been away from the game for a while? he definitely is immune. I pop that skill whenever lion pops that scan and away i go. Even gives me points for stopping the scan‚Äôs effects on me.
---
They should make a meme skin for him because he is supposed to be goofy.
---
You being older and on PlayStation doesn't change anything. You could have downloaded the clip to your phone and posted on this sub
---
They should bring all the unique game modes back. They are fun to play when you just want to relax away from ranked and switch things up a bit.
---
Cool. My argument is that multiplayer is not in VR. Instead of refuting my points, everyone is just downvoting me. I'd like to see the other side's counterpoints.
---
Edit: thank you for downvoting me again instead of actually setting up an arguement.
---
Well Sony can't do much right I don't know many High rank xbox players most mnk xbox players end up getting banned

Ya i saw that.  It went through the door like a foot and then glitch to the right and then back at you. At first I thought badit or mozie who ever that was went back in and through a grenade back but then i saw the teamate damage and that i don't think those guys have grenades.
---
wow. that 0%/0% on cav. its almost as if the pistol rework was a giant nerf and not a buff like non-cav players insist every time a bitch about them ruining her.
---
Overtime music is intense and I love it
---
A, individual resistances is already in the game. (Echo &amp; dokkabi, iq &amp; pulse). B, cav is banned alot and I want to lower that. C, it's a small nerf that buffs a weak character.
---
Yes yes
---
on pc im getting shit on left and right by that abomination of a mira wannabe :(
---
Imma be honest, I hate this art style

It is a very good format

Maybe instead of banning ops you don't like, ban ops that give tactical advantage

(As someone that plays to enjoy the game) I usually ban operators that I find are an annoyance to play against, jackal as it‚Äôs pretty annoying to be tracked every 5 seconds and hve to be so warry of where I step and cav simply because I hate the feelings of having to constantly watch my back for any of those pesky silent steps
---
A brick of C4 that big would probably level a piece of most of the maps irl

Crossfader was a seasonal, it‚Äôs not going to become available again

What i meant the model in the pic is a 2.5x and it should replace the acog on game which is a 4x model
---
we were on queue, we got kicked out of queue for some error, we restart game, game says we need to reconenct, try to reconect, game says another error, what we can do?
---
They don‚Äôt understand the giving yourself a advantage doesn‚Äôt make you good
---
I would love this but i just dont more bugs
---
The problem with it dealing damage to the hostage is that, when the gadget is detonated the attackers could drop the hostage into the area of effect. This is the problem that happened when Goyo was originally added to the game.
---
Now they just need to go all spetsnaz recruit with saiga 12
---
A 6 foot reach never loses reception
---
Not relevant to the ACOG itself but it is relevant to scopes, they should add the AimPoint CompM4 scope. It‚Äôs a nice scope.
---
That's what I thought when she released. I feel like he should be able to put holes in the shield, but that bullet won't hurt her. Like bullet makes a hole, and that hole can be shot through
---
Nothing, you can do it's rather  unfortunate but tbh I like the system personally never had an issue and it's done wonderd to deal with toxic team killers / rage quitters.
---
You‚Äôre ads sensitivity is way too high if you‚Äôre trying to make small adjustments with the sticks and overshooting that badly.

What‚Äôs weird is based of research I did on the weapon, this wouldn‚Äôt to far from reality. It‚Äôs a weapon that uses submachine gun style parts yet from some reason uses 5.56 ammo
---
Monte mains are a great example. Not the best at getting his own kills, but it's great to have a dmr behind him to get kills for him.
---
sorry for the audio, but i thought it was a nice 4k clutch. I'm only in gold 3 with 40 hours on record.
---
"Guys, the defuser's down, got get it."
---
Did you hear him the first time ACOG ON BOSG, I hope that clears it up
---
Its fucking stupid.
---
And what grammar did I fuck up? The part where I intentionally am mocking your room temperature IQ?
---
The defenders but glaz can see their individual pours
---
But only fuze can activate the charge so it should damage the hostage. You wont play him in Hostage just in Bomb or Secure the Area
---
Yeah sorry
---
No, there is a risk/reward for using his gadget. Careless placement is on you. 
---
If the fuze charge doesn't kill the hostage, people would bomb the room, smoke and run out.
---
Unfortunately
---
No the dialogue sound is good I want the weird warping effect sound to go
---
I‚Äôm saving this post for whenever my friends do a shit play and then I just spam them with this video XDDD
---
Personally, I don't think it should get an ACOG but that's just my opinion. The really big issues that I wish Youtubers would lord their influence over is getting Warden better weapon options (Or buffing Warden in general) and buffing the UMP 45 or replacing it.
---
Yeah I also have that same problem man, last Phantom Sight I have a cool PC temp and 50% cpu usage but now, I get high cpu and low fps
---
Noice!

Yeah sorry that you dont have a life. Unlike you the dude has free time to do something other than arguing with a 13 yr old

Been convincing people to get rid of the likes of twitch and jager. Changing the games entirely. So many people main these ops and are totally shit without them. Also I'm a Kapkan main. So no twitch means atleast 3 triggers. üòÇüòÇüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Gridlock. Lion‚Äôs been nerfed badly and for good measure he was very annoying to play against. Weapons wise both are similar but it honestly depends on how much you play either one (which may lead to bias). I‚Äôve played both of them a little bit and found gridlocks gadget to be more enjoyable especially since there‚Äôs an offence defence interaction when the gadget is deployed, rather than standing still to avoid being seen
---
Thank you!
---
Didn't know he was 13 sorry i fully respect that
---
[my own tutorial I guess](https://youtu.be/9nxxPevXga0)
---
How do you show who you main? I personally main Blitz
---
Better then nothing :)
---
Luck is the most part. I've gotten more thermite charge kills than regular breach charges.
---
The best advice is to distract/pressure the enemy into overlooking the charge or forcing them into the charge. 
---
One example is the Japanese map with the upstairs office. If you plant behind the desk and blow the hatch, they are forced to climb over the desk to get to the defuser.
---
u/SAU-SIEGE you almost have more karma than followers on the r6 subreddit. We all love you and your huge impact on this community.
---
I would try this it worked for me, maybe you might have some luck!
---
Thanking you does seem ridiculous, but if the downed person doesn't get killed immediately they should be finished by anybody given that there is a chance that they crawl away if you wait for the person who 'deserves the kill'

Have you seen Goyo's shotgun? That thing is basically a rifle

Still OP in a team, easy one click Intel influence, and the lower priming time makes it harder for defenders to find a safe spot once they get droned put.
---
He's not much of a terror in a team, unlike before, but in a coordinated stack of even 3 players, he's a literal monster.

Wait is Cpt.Sunstark watching this too ?

Cav had an glitch. Model during silent walk crouching went lower than your own FoV. You could hide behind some objects while crouch silent walking and be actually invisible, as you body did not peek at all, while also being able to shoot enemoes she saw from her perspective.

Rook's plates can reduce incoming damage by guns by 20% turning 3speeds into 3speeds 3armor and you basically can never waste his gadget
---
Doc has 120 extra HP laying around in his pocket. If you revive teammates with his gadget they will have 75HP instead of 20HP
---
Not to forget the MP5 which has basically no recoil and is a headshot machine
---
Oof
---
Good ol‚Äô Spud gun
---
Operators like Lion, Dokk, and Jackal are great for this, if they aren't banned of course. Most good run-out spots you can kind of memorize, and ask any freind with a claymore or deploy one yourself to watch the run out, but tbh that's all you can do other than watch the doorway and hope you have better aim.
---
ive only played bad company and bf1

Also droning is very useful on attack, probably the most useful tool you have as an attacker.

Go to documents, my games, rainbow six, some random alphanumeric string, setting file, then look for the fps cap.
---
Charge your controller

yeh adding acog with 3 speed would make him OP

Play lone wolf terrorist hunt without aim assist and go for headshots, keep yourself in a low ammo scenario, keep 2 mags only and kill every terrorist in house-extract hostage.

Took me 100 hours to realise that if you looked up with a drone you could jump higher. To be fair it was the very start of the game and didn't see anyone else jumping high.
---
It's not. It's a bug. Sorry you just got shafted. Blackbeard has a similar thing happen on occasion, as do the other Shield Operators.
---
Looking at your replies it seems you have this issue in casual. My simple question, that I ask with no intentions of hostility, is why not play unranked? It‚Äôs much more serious there rather than in casual, but still not effecting any mmr or being too high stake.

It's a player problem god damnit, people keep cancelling queue as the match starts. And given loading time problems with people who arent using SSD's, I dont think they want to add a match cancelled issue since if its effective operating window is too big, it could be abused.

Theoretically, this should be happening more often to the opposing team than you in your games, so relax.

You could try and join the discord or look for teammates to queue with so you have a better chance.  If you're much better than copper players you should be hard stomping them with a decent KDA so with a couple of good teammates you guys should easily be able to carry out the games.

No, gun recycling isn't fair. Licensing is just their excuse. If they just change the name of the gun, there's no licensing problem. And the recoil of this game's guns is not strong. Even if ubi gives us a new gun, we can adjust. It's just that ubisoft is making excuses because it's annoying to make guns. If we don't protest strongly, they'll be even more lazy.

Also, if you do buy it again on UPLAY, you'll get two R6S in the UPLAY library, one for Steam one for UPLAY.
---
You could try writing it out in notepad, then pasting it in, and replacing the operators with their icons. My flair can be written as ":maestro::fuze::finka::lesion::gridlock: Maestro Main". I can paste it into my flair, then click on each op an replace it with the appropriate icon.

You can tell people that you are holding an angle when they do it constantly. If it is a one off in a round where someone rotates to get to safety let it slip. As soon as you start climbing ranks your teammates will have the game sense to know which angle is held and when not to cross. But is is something that you can¬¥t always prevent.
---
Siege needs to make an option where you can play from a list of old game modes like that and rainbow is magic
---
There‚Äôs been plenty of leaks
---
There has been ill try to link them to you
---
This is correct as the PS4 does all this when downloading/applying an update:
---
- Create a temporary space to apply the patch (that temp space needs at least the full size of the game to the patch be applied + whatever the size of the update is)
---
- Make a copy of the game data in the temporary space.
---
- Apply the patch in the game data in the temporary space.
---
- Test if everything was right with the game data in the temporary space.
---
- Swap the game data with the patched game data in temporary space.
---
Siege is a big game so since the PS4 makes a copy of the entire game in temp space you will need a lot.... This is why we have the stupid copying after the download of an update which takes forever!!

You cannot play R6 on a laptop my guy

Actually it was a 3v5 and there was 1 ally to my right so teammate* and I thought that the team could use some support from the outside which I would have easily managed because I already took out 1 so it was a 3v4 and I had doc in my sights, after it was a level playing field I was gonna push site. Also I was using habana with acog so I think it would be more beneficial for me to be there since I knew it was bank and long range operators can have a much larger impact than rushing with speed 3s and risking, maybe it‚Äôs not everybody‚Äôs play style but it‚Äôs certainly mine :)

That's a really good idea

That honestly is a great way to do it 
---
We need more synergy with ops and this is one way to implement and improve the lack of synergy
---
So they're doing the new thing where they cycle maps in and out on a monthly basis, we may not get it back for a few more weeks
---
They removed it from casual, ranked, unranked, and newcomer. I'm pretty sure

Hello ZrelIl, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/diai9j/lucky_shot/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

It hasn‚Äôt been in ranked for a couple years and was never in unranked but I‚Äôm curious to why it‚Äôs not in casual
---
And cav has always been such a solo op giving her another op that can get almost a thermite Thatcher type dynamic to it would be really interesting in the right hands
---
I much prefer idea #2 compared to idea #1.
---
Idea #1 seems like it would end up making a lot of games really unbalanced by banning specific operators to give the enemy team a disadvantage

Yeah him being vulnerable to thatcher is the best way to balance him, it won‚Äôt make any sens that thatcher could destroy batteries but not the electro claws. In the next patch he will be able to electrify 3 walls with only one claw. If this will be good that remain to be seen because not many obj have 3 walls one next to the other.

Thank you! I really appreciate that and I'll keep doing my best to \^\^
---
1 and 2 I agree, however on point 3: getting battle points for kills will encourage people to play exclusively for kills which can end up in people dying for getting even more greedy, and end up losing more games. Instead it should be getting battle points for winning rounds, matches, etc, something you have to do as a team.
---
So you'd rather them keep adding broken maps instead of fixing the broken maps we already have?
---
You don't have to win though. And i wouldn't call playing a video game is "work"
---
Where you ask? On the G36C...

we knew that since ER reveal. its a test battle pass so they can make changes

Outback is broken?
---
Why do you view new maps as ‚Äúbroken‚Äù instead of remapping old content and calling it an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù
---
Not, when other actions will get you points too. Kills should reward low points, objective play, using gadgets should give more ofc
---
Never open a Mira
---
Its not about the content. 
---
This system is their initial release to test the feature, they already highlighted that this pass would be "mini" with fewer items but available to everyone. In december the fully fledged pass will release with much better cosmetics with free and premium tiers. For now this 7 day pass gives you 4 charms just for playing the game and the full system will give players an incentive to play (outside of achieving a higher placement in ranked). I like the idea, coming from someone who has played nearly every day since launch - it did get stale when you get nothing for playing.
---
I only play casual but what /gamemode is this
---
(Sorta new to the game)
---
Then just make it 10-15 seconds each.
---
Haven‚Äôt been online yet (RL sucks sometimes), but this pick is from the livegame. So it‚Äôs like Ranked but in S4 the actual Battle pass will get onto live servers
---
I agree with you on that the old maps need to be fixed first then they need to add new maps after for example I would take a favela rework over a new map any day I would kill to have that be a viable map it just looks so nice and the colors are beautiful but it‚Äôs just so unbalanced
---
It‚Äôs to represent what the free one will look like, and the free will definitely have gaps
---
Alright thanks
---
It was when it was released, not broken in like the "it's literally impossible to defend this certain room" sense, like glitches and stuff.
---
My top reworks for next year are Chalet, Skyscraper, and Favela. I would say Yacht but I feel Favela would be an easier map to rework then Yacht because yacht, much like Plane, is limited by its design as a whole. The design being it‚Äôs a Vehicle, not a building. This isn‚Äôt me saying I don‚Äôt want Yacht reworked but I think we all know Favela needs it more.
---
Your if was about if there would be a halloween event at all, which is nonsensical
---
I'd rather have that guy on my team than you. Then at least there'd be a chance I could have fun.
---
Uhm, yes it does
---
Disagree with #3. If you make it to play for kills, assist, or plants, then people will play rounds for that and not the actual game. Especially for plant, where all I see is being tk‚Äôd so they can selfishly plant. Kills will be make people not play the objective. Assist is just no. So, play more is the better option here.
---
7 tiers, 60 battlepoints per round won ,120 per match win, 100 per match loss. multiply those by 0.25 and you know how much you will get for playing ranked
---
Wtf
---
Wait this is going on?
---
I played last night, never noticed
---
It‚Äôs tied between siege and battlefield 4/1 for me, especially how you can change the color of the headshot marker in bf4
---
They're gonna start putting content behind it that you could have bought with renown before
---
This was pushed forward to today due to the issues with the Console patch which was delayed. Ubisoft sets a schedule for quite some time ahead so the written work is already done, they just needed to recorrect it. 
---
Nice to see people have nothing better to complain about...

---
Yea we were apparently in the same game. BIG spook.
---
New maps are always full of glitches, ridiculous spawnpeeks, and in general just stuff that makes a map broken. Some of the old maps are just plain unbalanced, take Favela for example. I'd rather have Favela get reworked than get multiple new maps.
---
Like what?  There are already items that can only be purchased with credits?

yeah go on the defensive. go cheat in casual

he's the most powerful operator bc he can say the n word
---
Recruit with AK12 is OP
---
I don't like what's in it but I don't mind. I think next season when the rewards are good it'll entice people to keep playing the entire season
---
I really enjoyed taking a look at your list however,I dunno, I'd consider IQ to barely be making B tier. Strictly personally speaking I didnt really find much use of her operator skill.
---
I believe so. I have different strategies based on the offense tempo (rush vs setup) and that factors in what defense location I play. Take Oregon for example - usually go basement or kids bedroom 1/2 respectively. Why would you chance going tower or kitchen first round being 0-3 when you don‚Äôt know the offense strategy? Pick basement, win the round, and learn how they attack. That will let pick #2 and #3 location based on that information easier to play.

Yes, I played a few games and got an "unranked" bonus that was the exact 25% percent of the game won + rounds won.

I'm not too fussed honestly, I've never given a shit about skins really.

Theyre nice to have but not worth spending money on IMO.

That literally happened after one guy went nuts I was killed few seconds after the start. The next three rounds I saved the game being last (wo)man standing. That felt good
---
It's a test. In season 4 they said there will be a proper Battle-Pass
---
i disagree with some operators like 
---
- Kaid and buck are way too low. 
---
buck is one of the best operators in the game. he has nades on of the best ars in the game. and the best soft wall breacher.  Def an A
---
kaid is a better bandit as you can do it from a far and kaid tricking is pretty easy. You can also get hatches which bandit can‚Äôt do.
---
- alibi, finka and rook are too high imo.
---
alibi doesn‚Äôt have the same use as bandit in terms of how good there are. prob a C
---
i don‚Äôt like getting finka boosted. I would put her at like C.

rook is a solid op not a A tho. def a B

Giving the defense 7 more seconds to disable or the attack 7 fewer seconds to plant would shift the balance even further in the defense's favor.  The best option would be to reduce the disable timer by 7 seconds but allow all disables started before the timer ends to continue.
---
This is literally the start of Raiden's fatality
---
You don‚Äôt have to blindly shit on him like that. Especially the personal insult. He‚Äôs just having fun dude.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I thought. I just pay too much for internet for this to be happening cause of ping lol but you might be right
---
Oregon
---
Tuon vihreet kuulat
---
why the shields so low? especially monty, he should atleast be A teir.
---
It's perspective but it's not an issue. It's simply how perspective works in real life too. Closer you are to an angle the worse your vision around the angle will be. That and ping combined make it even worse
---
If I encounter that in my game I would be terrified
---
I'm not saying she's a must pick, I'm just saying that a niche exists for Nokk against teams like that.
---
What's niche does Amaru fit into? Rushing I guess?
---
he posted something and i‚Äôm criticizing him
---
Yeah he wasn't even with his default camo, you shoulda been able to see him even with the fucking deagle sights, first post I see where is actually the game's fault
---
Is he saying that because you have to remove the FH and that would make the barrel under the limit? 
---
Because that‚Äôs an sbr as it is if so.
---
This seems to be a ranking list for solo play rather than team play.
---
Honestly if your biggest concern is not being able to kill spawn peekers with N√∏kk you aren‚Äôt looking at it correct. If they spawn-peek, their head is exposed and you shoot it. If it is too far to see, that‚Äôs a N√∏kk acog problem.
---
As for the fmg9, it is pretty bad. Nobody ever uses it on smoke because why would they. It isn‚Äôt like his other guns are good, the fmg is so bad. I don‚Äôt see how an extended barrel would help the gun. Something like a damage buff or recoil nerf to make it like a laser (mpx style), would be a better buff.
---
Imo it‚Äôs one of those guns that you have to have  good aim for(not saying you have bad aim just hear me out). If you can land every shot it‚Äôs good but if you miss one or 2 you‚Äôre pretty much dead.

Oh thanks, but I actually use the shotgun revolver, and that can be very useful. My start is to place none of my prisms (toxic I know) but I place one way outside obj and 2 in it. With the 2 in it is that I place them with a soft wall in front of them and if I get pushed back to obj. I will shoot holes in the walls a high the shotgun to make holes that they didn't see before. They usually shoot them and I get 1 or even 2 tracks which give me valuable info on them.
---
I'd love to but i didn't save a clip of it. Should i still report?
---
When is it happening?
---
Anybody that puts it up other than Ubisoft probably doesn't have a license so the quality will either be hit,or more likely miss.
---
Duh smoke was having a bad day and teachable the god decided to kill the hibana with a gu mine
---
Personal insults are not criticizing. They‚Äôre personal insults
---
I think that's a good idea amaru really needs a buff and this could be a step in the right direction
---
It‚Äôs a bug on twitch that the two yellow light are in front of the drone and on it. She‚Äôs was probably under the thing.
---
go away
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of funny the only girl in r6 that‚Äôs average height is Mira, 5‚Äô5, but she‚Äôs the second shortest girl in rainbow, most of the girls are 5‚Äô7 - 5‚Äô8, which is pretty y‚Äôall for a girl,but I guess ubi just said fuck it and made Amaru 6‚Äô2
---
I find it hilarious when they say it's easier yet they lose and do nothing the entire match. Not to mention, they're still in gold 1/plat 3 after 60+ games.
---
#bosgacog
---
changing up finka to have more of a healing focus would be nice
---
Caviera may be Spook Bitch, but the spookiest Op of all is a Sledge you didn't know was around the corner.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty cool addition to the game so I don‚Äôt have to mindlessly play for no rewards (Just because I‚Äôll buy it)
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb5DITStXlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb5DITStXlI)  that's the first thing that came to my mind lol
---
Super niche circumstances, I know. But with a main attribute of Amaru being the element of suprise I think given the right timing you can catch some defenders off guard.
---
Until they charge 100,000 renown for it
---
This will take skins/charms we would normally get/unlock and gates them off behind a paywall. these will then also be loaded into everyones hdds and sit there for the rest of the games life.
---
Isn‚Äôt the whole point of every game to run like a simulation? Like the defenders act as heavily committed terrorists who want sacrifice themselves so the bomb can detonate, meanwhile the attackers are there to defuse the bomb and situation, in order to bring peace amongst the civilians, while all gadgets and ops act as people profiles and actual gadget ideas to progress this idea.
---
Haha same
---
This is the only thing that I don‚Äôt want to support unless it‚Äôs free with the season pass
---
Yeah I did, about 8 months ago
---
_task failed succesfully_
---
Someone's salty because they died as defender with a second left on the clock huh?
---
But anyway, who really cares, it's already been established that the fights are just training. Lore-wise the timer is there artificially, Six just gave them a timer to put pressure on the attacking team, the amount of time means nothing, that's why in terrorist hunt, (what is presumably real events,) you do have to plant the defuser even if all enemies are dead.
---
no cap thats so true big chunky rook and doc have been getting away with it recently at least for me that is.
---
I certainly won‚Äôt be buying it, but it would be nice if they gave it to season pass holders. I don‚Äôt want to pay 35 bucks just to have to pay more for a battle pass
---
OOOOOH I CAN'T BREATH
---
bro data limits bro
---
He‚Äôs from an alternate dimension where there was a Rainbow Six Siege campaign.
---
It takes to long
---
Nah fam thats all for now.
---
Ah I see you joined an existing match
---
üóø
---
I've tried restarting and it doesnt work my entire game
---
ALL MUST BOW BEFORE THE LORD!
---
Ahh so 2020 when quarantine comes out?
---
It‚Äôs easily the most common terrorist hunt challenge
---
She got thicc feet
---
I'll honest drop siege I won't support any game that does a battle pass ever.
---
Whoever invented them needs shot in his greedy fucking face
---
What party did the kkk vote for in 2016? Kkk always been small government even when the party name said democrat you ding dong
---
In that case that would be the future.
---
n
---
Nice title........
---
She probably did it was just labeled hush money
---
i see...played watch dogs 1 and was so disappointed, that i never tried the 2nd one
---
Wouldn't mind a very small damage or fire rate buff. Just enough to make FMG be bit more impactful but not enough to surpass shotgun/smg11 combo so that it won't be much of a buff for Smoke players. 
---
With Pros playing Nokk lately though, I doubt Ubi will give a huge changes and buffs for Nokk. Only thing I can see happening is giving her another 2 or 3 sec longer gadget usage.
---
House and plane defend hostage, you can spawnpeak half the wave, probably easier than multiplayer, you actually get to pick the ops for your challenge
---
Trust me guys, this isn‚Äôt over
---
I did the same fuckin thing lmao
---
It‚Äôs still way longer than classic
---
Last year I got the skeleton head for J√§ger out of the free pack. Still the biggest flex ever.
---
The book has VR training Sims. We play that in multiplayer
---
Wow all the downvotes. Guess everyone hates free stuff?
---
What is there to hate? Nothing changed.. now you just get more rewards for playing and winning more.
---
Bro jagers been possessed
---
If im not bad, when the elite was announced they said it was nationalist
---
Looks absolutely amazing!
---
You are very talented!
---
I
---
I know it's not a thread for this, but is Alibi worth playing in general? How's her gun?
---
No, not really
---
test what 4 shitty rewards?lmao
---
Poor Ying, she‚Äôs such a cute little shrimp
---
Really? You got a source, I couldn't find a clear answer
---
Lmaooo
---
It‚Äôs tuff
---
Lol yellow iceüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Because it would be farmable?
---
You don't get rewarded in custom games because it would be way too easy to abuse it and farm renown / battle pass progress / alpha packs etc. If you're more than 5 your only way would be to rotate each game. It sucks yes but offering rewards for custom games simply does not work.
---
To be fair, the game has been supported well past its initial launch. Ubi still needs money to support the game and their leagues. There‚Äôs no way that buying the battle passes supports their entire production on the game.
---
But the thing is video games are often awful at knowing if a player can get through an obsticle. Even worse that its a dynamic hole.
---
That's just sad.
---
I would genuinely like to know why ubisoft thinks they need a battlepass. Like, I get money. But what went through their heads.
---
Charms were a mistake.
---
I mean battlepasses arent inherently that bad. Most have a lot of cosmetics for just 10‚Ç¨ and most refund the credits spent on buying the pass if you complete it. Its sure as shit better than lootboxes. And the challenges and objectives to level it up can be fun for a lot of people. Id rather take a good battlepass than the random alphapack only event skins we got right now.
---
Mmmmm I like
---
They can do that without a battle pass.
---
Battle passes are just greed
---
120 for a match won. 60 for a round won. 100 for a match lost. 25% bonus for playing in ranked.
---
You can get a max of 525 per match if it is ranked and goes to overtime.
---
Wait, is it really available ?
---
Really charms i dont fucking use charms!!! That gives me no incentives to participate.
---
Yes they are.
---
Ash
---
Yea
---
Wow! All the rewards are shit!
---
Let me see if i find it
---
New ops, maps, leagues and more can be supported for a 4 year old game without other means of money making how? You want more gambling or a set system of rewards for playing?
---
It wouldn‚Äôt really put that much of an edge on it, vigil‚Äôs smg would still be way more viable in any situation. Acog would just turn it into a meme cannon.
---
Mira's great, if you know the default spots for her gadget and how to play her. This guy is just not great with mira.
---
I don't know, why don't you ask...
---
...YOURSELF!
---
What is
---
Sounds good! Pro tip: stay positive! And even if you have a weak moment and get toxic, just calm down, maybe if u handle it in the same match, apologize and go on!
---
Just play a lot, watch some videos about the game and all that to see and understand things like angles and perspectives, basic set ups for defense and attacking, etc.
---
Dammit now I can‚Äôt unsee it, thanks
---
This happens to me sometimes, I just alt-tab, open the start menu and close it and the taskbar should go away.
---
Yes!!! Also r/unexpectedkoolaidman
---
Yea, I‚Äôm not sure all what happened. I still can only count 3 shooting kills. I know one of the other guys stepped on my trap (the last guy I kill) but not sure how I downed the other lol.
---
Better than random look boxes
---
Yeah, it would be fun on casual or unranked
---
It's so shes a bigger target coming through windows
---
FOR GLORY
---
Lowkey didnt know that pulse had an elite. Also you forgot blackbeard. Also also, lesion looks cool tho.
---
There ain't nothin' in the world 30 rounds can't solve
---
Who cares, you don‚Äôt have to buy it. 10-20$ for a vast line of cosmetics and it will give people something to do. It‚Äôs better then paying 10$ for one skin
---
The responses on this thread... 
---
They do put a smile on my face.
---
Man, I've argued with people like you before on the internet. Instead of admitting a small thing or arguing against it, they will go for insults and straight up denial. It's kind of sad but I know I can't persuade you so hope you just have fun in siege man.
---
Yep, the official one
---
If you mean why they don't all have the same ones, simple, Mira running around with an acog would be horrifying.
---
If your question meant something else then ask away
---
'Tis the man himself
---
There will be a paid pass tho lmao
---
Bro how the Fuck is ash above anyone else fucking f- tier elite skin

Maybe I just get carried but I‚Äôm plat with a 1.1 k/d. I‚Äôm intrigued that yours is so much higher yet you‚Äôve just now gotten plat. Congratulations though!
---
Disgusting
---
People like you actually make me puke. The entitlement in this subreddit is actually hilarious. The game is around $30, you have the ability to get every operator in this game for *free*, maps for *free*, reworks for *free*, and you're going to complain that Ubisoft wants to add support for the game in the future? Give me a fucking break.
---
Call me Harry!
---
You can buy a mini keypad with an analogue stick for your thumb. IIRC, Razer make one. There's even a pro player that uses/used to use it.
---
Your statement literally is invalid as i already pointed out why.
---
They put all the limited and cool items players WANT behind a paywall to put pressure into them into buying the pass.
---
It's the same like the event packs,only difference being one gambling and the other one putting effort into unlocking the content you PAID for.
---
That took a turn holy shit
---
FOR HONOR
---
With the bosg you get 1 shot body kills if they are close anyway.
---
I need explaining
---
F
---
Eh Ill pass. I think its kinda dumb to have a battle pass in a game thats not free to play
---
Okay, bye. üëã
---
I know there will be. I was just talking the current mini pass. Taking their opportunity to show people not familiar with battle passes how it works and its only 7 levels and third of it is empty. If they cant fill 7 levels how are they gonna fill 100 levels in the paid pass
---
Whelp, thanks
---
They mean why cant Ubi give different attachments to operators using the same guns. E.g. like giving ACOG to Nokk's FMG but not smonk 
---
And to answer the question, Ubi has stated that theres limitations on that due to the way the guns and attachments are coded.
---
Carry us to this victory all mighty one
---
Sure the premium will have better items but if as a player you can‚Äôt say to yourself I don‚Äôt need it and I don‚Äôt have the money to put into this it‚Äôs kind of your fault. I never buy any special alpha packs or any cosmetic items from any games. As the consumer you have to ask you: what value will I get from this? They are a business, they need money in order to be able to 1. Keep the servers 2. Pay the devs to make more content. If players want to buy it and have the means, they should but the game doesn‚Äôt pressure you to buy the cosmetic items, you pressure yourself.
---
Is this an actual post?
---
who‚Äôs letting vigil be that thicc
---
What
---
Once again, you don‚Äôt have to buy it. It‚Äôs not pay to win so what‚Äôs the big deal? After all there just cosmetics. You WANT THEM whether or not there behind a paywall. You want to buy a nice sports car, just because it‚Äôs behind a hefty paywall doesn‚Äôt mean the deal ship can‚Äôt sell it. AFTER ALL YOUR THE ONE THAT WANTS IT
---
I say some shit like ‚Äúu fuckin sirious‚Äù and just call it a bruh moment after that
