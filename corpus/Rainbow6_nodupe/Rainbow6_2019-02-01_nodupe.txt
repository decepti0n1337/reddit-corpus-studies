Yeah still good for spraying tho and honestly I think it has more controllable recoil than the smg-11. Its better than a pistol in my opinion.
---
---
---
Yeah just him another god damn roaming op and leave his gadget useless
---
That's not feasible in almost any skill level of play, as roamers may die to her team, granting the attackers a huge advantage as it is. This would make her effect when one defender dies much smaller and more reasonable. 
---
Really? A lot of people still like the smg-11 over the bearing 9. The one bright side is that echo's pistol is awesome. 
---
Huh my friend’s woodwork teacher looks just like pulse as well. On another note, my science teacher looks like Walter White in the later episodes.
---
Never tried it I know some ppl are running it. P229 gang I might try it.
---
So that’s what, Lion (already coming), Finka, Doki, Rook, and Cav? We haven’t even gotten the Tachanka rework that he’s practically needed from launch. Adding another 4 isn’t going to do anything other than slow down the progression on the 2 they already have in the works which are desperately needed along with just regular bug fixes before this many reworks are even discussed.

Interact is F, melee is E. That's how I do it for every first person game I own. I like my games to be very consistent as far as controls are concerned. Getting mouse sensitivity the same across every game is a massive pain, but it's worth it
---
Wat
---
Thats understandable 
---
Sameeeee
---
I don’t think you quite understand how effective Lion can be. 
---
Let me know how well ‘just stand still’ works when you come against a team higher than silver that actually communicates. 
---
No. BOSG.
---
No. Totally not biased
---
And give her an actually primary please :)
---
I forget the name but it was a seasonal a long time ago, you can’t get it anymore.
---
Here’s an idea: what if setting off a logic bomb caused all phones (attacker and defender) to ring, but if one phone got hacked you could see not only defender cams but defender phone cams?
---
Nah, plenty of women shave their head, it doesn't ruin anything.
---
Thank you!
---
His PARA 308 is really good! It basically has the same damage and rate of fire as his LMG (I think the recoil is quite similar as well, not sure). But you can aim down sights with it faster, which personally suits me better than a larger ammo capacity.
---
Op obviously doesn’t use a suppressor on c-75

But you can’t rotate onto your side while your side and aim. Basically you can’t have your rifle and legs in a 90° angle like in the video, they always are sorta in front or behind you, which exposes you more 
---
Play a shit ton of terrorist hunt for the first while and use as low a sensitivity as you can manage (lower the better in siege)
---
Yes

Just curious, how would this differ from the current system since it’s first-person, not third person?
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/844/770/e9d.jpg
---
1 yes totally, you can grind for renown without money. I recommande you to buy the standard edition not the starter because it would make you grind much more (unless you intend to play a lot like 20hours/week)
---
2 Well no, many people are really dumb. People lacks of shooting skills and other lacks of brain/game sense. I hope it's not your case. Also I recommend you to find and play with a team so they can support you,  because some people in the commu ity are very toxic to new players. 
---
3 not necessary in casual, many people don't talk even if they own a mic in casual. Ranked is more fun and a mic is useful but not mandatory. But if you want to play with a team you will obviously need a mic.
---
4 DLC are just to get some special customization equipment and unlock operators without even grinding. They also allow you to play  new one week before common players and that's all. You don't need to buy anything more to play. 
---
5 there are some customisation options you can buy with "renown" in game currency that you have to play to win some, some with real money only and among all these skin some are limited in time. There are plenty of skin but half are ugly. You can use skin on your main weapon, your secondary weapon, your headgear, your uniform set. Elite bundles and proleague bundles are a headgear binded to the uniform. Elites uniforms also includes a special animation if you are on the top of the scoreboard of the winning team.
---
So yes you can play and have fun without spending more than about $30
---
You didn't asked it but I recommend you to play on pc because the community is a bit less toxic and the shotguns are not fucked. Also it's easier to find a squad to play with regularly (wich is way more fun IMO) . 
---
As someone who mains dokkaebi I’d love to see this 
---
I really think the phones turning off automatically is making her gadget a lot less of a threat. As now you can just hold an angle and wait for it to turn off 
---
Just make the horizontal recoil better, not more dmg or rounds. The extra dmg or ammo would probably be too good at higher level play.
---
This has been happening so much lately 
---
[removed]
---
does for me
---
When aiming, you would roll in place, rather than spin on a Yaw axis. But not when outside of ADS.
---
Kinda like MGSV.
---
Kinda unstructured but entertaining 
---
Oh, you're in middle-school, got it.
---
I feel like its one of these O__O style things

Nice drawing

Really? Wouldn't a lower sens make it harder to switch to enemies?

"It's time for operation: Spicy Meatball, motherfucker"

The idea I always liked: Dok _has_ to hack in order to call phones BUT she can also hack into cameras. The hacking process is an autonomous virus that she has to protect for ~30 seconds. In the meantime, any defender can destroy the camera she's hacking in order to stop the hack (and the defenders are told which cam is being hacked. This way, the calls can countered and Dok creates an interactive secondary objective on the map, which promotes teamwork/communication, without nerfing her at all (because being able to hack cams without killing an enemy is a pretty big buff even with the drawbacks.)
---

---
What a middle finger to the defenders! I love it hahaha
---
The depression’s setting in my guy
---
It be like that sometimes
---
I could get down with those changes
---
I swear that map is cursed lol
---
Not gonna lie, I kinda miss the old rainbow 
---
That is a good point, but I was referring to the attacking ops that you've chosen.
---
Dude this is nuts you're insanely talented
---
Secondary SMGs need a recoil buff regardless. Not to their former glory, but a middle ground between what they are now and were.
---
I was one of the people that wanted Blitz to be 2/2, because it was a change that made complete sense.  
---
Then they made it so he could sprint with his shield up, and that instantly became something most of us stopped asking for.  
---
You're exactly right, they went too far and now he's just a pain in the ass.
---
So, then because Dokkaebi can be shot mid call, hers is not a global either?
---
Besides, it still affects the way the attacking team views the defending one. I dunno about you, but when I spot an enemy Rook on the defending team I automatically assume the whole team has a plate and try to play less aggressive in response. That has a tangible effect whether the roamers are stupid or not.
---
Oof
---
You forgot to strap the A-10 warthog to her back
---
&gt;when Ela had 15 too many pierogis
---
Because of this I switched the interact key to "tab" and melee to "F"
---
Then you're just going to end up buffing every male character since they have superior size and strength. 
---
You don’t need good aim lol just throw smokes in and push
---
Didn’t see that coming
---
Tachanka is Putin confirmed
---
That is a good point but I was mainly referring to the attacking team's ops.
---
If you aren't already, try playing lots of ranked. At first you'll suck but then you get better as you learn more. Just try to gain a sense of different strategies and eventually you'll be good enough to do them and predict them, like spawn peeks, rushes, roamers, and campers, etc. Hopefully by that point your other skills will develop like aim, trigger finger, and map knowledge, etc. Also I recommend playing with other people that are pretty good because just being in that environment inevitably helps you out. Don't worry about rushing on objective all the time, or staying camped for a whole round. Just think about the best thing to do and you'll definitely improve.
---
Finally, a wallpaper that will fit my 21:9 monitor!
---
Because you don’t just get randomly banned. You have to do something consistently over time to get banned.
---
Well if you have a mic, make callouts, if you don't leave it to the operators alive to use the cameras and make callouts, if they are unable to do so, don't spam the ever living shit out of the camera for something unimportant and use the scan only when needed.
---
My main hatred is people who scan and spam with valk cams when it's unnecessary, it gets worse when they scan with attacker drones and twitch drones.
---
It's better off to let the drone/cam sit and be used by someone alive if you are unable to make the callouts that way, you don't end up screwing your team over even more after dying. The only acceptable time to spam the shit out of it as I said is the last moments of a round, where it helps the most. It's stupid because it's very situational and there's not much you can do about it.
---
That’s hot, nice drawing, you should draw buck next ;) he’s my main
---
You know you're in good hands when you play with a 4 Stack Russians that only pick Russian operators !
---
I prefer a 1v1. Drone him out and pre fire. Usually dude is in obj waiting.
---
Also finding your right sensitivity is huge I’ve noticed 
---
Hey that's me!

Mute's jammer range needs another flat buff anyway.

It sucks when you get shitty teammates. Sometimes your team is great, but then this happens.

Can you provide a download link for 1440p? I would credit you for sure!
---
Dokkaibei double barrel 👌
---
It tries to mat h you with people your skill level and no one is as good as you!
---
How about simplify it, and make it so dokkaebi just needs to get a phone to use the logic bomb? As well as a (quite long) ring timer.
---
She'll still be incredibly powerful, just more of a late-game op than initial push. 
---
I can control the Smg 12 on console and PC. Vigil main here.
---
Be my dad. Buck is my main and this is freaking sexy af
---
If you look at my first post I just joked about the book seeing if it warned you of how broken the game was. A fucktard then proceeded to reply as if there is nothing broken so I replied back with what is broken. Then you failed at defending PC as you probably suck at using a controller and rely on mouse and keyboard. And now we are here. ;)
---
I have played both. You have no argument at all. This is a team based game where communication is key. So in saying that PC has text chat is retarded as it's super delayed in many situations. Also in PC people are playing using an external communication programs which is leaving out the other people on the team. 
---
Having more ways to communicate causes more problems than in solves. All players on the team need to be in game chat, since it just "works so well on PC", and be communicating. 
---
So PC has cheaters (yes even some you probably weren't aware of in your "5 months" of cheater free gameplay) and there are too many ways to communicate that dont involve other players on your own team, which gives for a terrible experience  in my opinion. 
---
Yes console has parties, but it's simple to send an invite to a party and to join one.
---
What I'm saying is there is no reason the rules have to be absolute. I can think of so many situations where a TK might be accidental. Killing your teammate by accident when they are being  interrogated, bad grenades, missed shots through soft walls, them running past your breach charge and the list goes on. But by your logic all of those situations should be banable offences. Just adding a forgive button would make clearing up true accidents so much easier without the need for indiscriminate bans. 
---
SO THICCC 
---
She has a huge risk, with her logic bomb having at least two second activation along with two seconds of inactivity hacking the phones. Cams can be shot out by both teams even if hacked and the defense can still use them.
---
Her ability is no different in risk and reward from a Cav Interrogation.
---
Her only viable primary is a DMR that can be beat my most full autos in the game and 2 secondaries that need you to be in close quarters with SMG users to fight effectively with.
---
Similarly, Lesion has 8 gu mines he can see anywhere on the map, they’re invisible, they stop sprinting and planting while taking 10 damage every 3 or so seconds.
---
Along with a 2 second animation of taking it out, he has a strong SMG and a powerful pistol.
---
His only counters are IQ, that has to switch to her pistol to find, and twitch who has to waste a shock for just one. He is the definition of low risk, high reward.
---
You’re kidding me right let me break it down for you
---
Took=2 steps to gain ability, has to be used during a safe time, requires every member to grab armour to make it effective. Dokkaebi= holds a button ANYWHERE on the map at ANY TIME to activate her ability. Instantly affects the WHOLE ENEMY TEAM without any further steps. They are not the same in the slightest 
---
I just made it up, 
---
Credit to u/midolahud for the original wallpaper, I just changed up the colors.
---
There was a ton of bitching about Dokk until Lion came onto the scene and people basically forgot about her ability. Then they just bitched about the sidearm SMGs until those were made borderline useless. 
---
If your still playing it on ps4 you'll still have the game. If your switching platforms you'll need to buy it for the chosen platform. As for season pass I don't own it so I can't say for sure. 
---
Imao, grind territory hunt on a 45 sens, work your way up to a higher sens till you aim is on point. When you see a body, don’t start spraying, lock on to his body/head if you can and hit your shots. Oh, and another thing, don’t use shotguns ;)
---
It's a nice place, I would actually like to go to the Kafe
---
r/namflashbacks
---
Controllers have smooth acceleration. They don't "snap". Even at 100 sens a controller is smooth.
---
FO12 M590A1 SG-CQB
---
So shouldn’t the choice be to the person who brought the gadget 
---
Even though it has nothing to do with the characters of siege, it's a great book and certainly captures the feel very well.
---
We've hit Instagram level captions 
---
Couldn't this easily be misinterpreted? 
---
I'm not paying 100$ for an adapter .
---
At least it'll be better when they fix the spam meta
---
Pretty sure it was actually increased so he could jam two reinforced walls with one jammer.
---
So far I think this is the only necessary operator idea on this entire sub.
---
Personally, I'd like Dokk's phone call to be a 1 handed move, similar to how a breach charge detonator works. Having her 'prep' and trigger on two separate animations would make the intended changes listed above more viable to hunting down roamers or hiding defenders as that animation can get you killed really easily if you aren't careful. Making her have two different phases may not affect the first call, but it'd also make it harder to train together calls one after another as well as give defenders an opportunity to deny that call. 
---
Wow that’s lame, guess I’m not high enough Elo to be annoyed by that happening lol 
---
Thats my main
---
in game low texture setting will make result like that for cut scene
---
Nope! 
---
Mate you do realize that half of these posts are jokes.
---
are you telling me, to save 80gb, i have to move around 1 file to another folder depending on if i'm using uplay/steam
---
nebraska corn 10/10 would add
---
As a half Dokk main, this seems awesome.
---
That fucktard is right, there is no inherent problems in siege rn, good night. 
---
Does the same not apply to Kapkan? He’s safe during the prep phase his only real worry is a twitch drone. What about Lesion? Sure it can be dangerous to peak and throw a gu but there are plenty of moments throughout the round where he’s safe enough to do it. And when you think about it both of those, along with Maestro who sits comfortably in objective on his EEs all do damage and have the capability of being lethal. A phone call can’t be lethal or even deal damage on its own. You can’t make sweeping statements saying X type of gadget/operator needs to be reworked because the same can be said for many of the gadgets in the game.
---
Also with your statement that Dokkaebi and Finka can stay in spawn and use their abilities if they wanted can’t the same be said for Twitch? Completely safe and  having a massive impact on the match.
---
This game is just a game of decision making. You just need the experience to know the right calls at the right time. You will get better
---
Cause you can't 
---
2 steps vs. 1 step. Yup, real difference there. I guess following that logic Thermite is a far more broken operator than Maverick since his gadget requires far more steps.
---
A safe time? You mean like the entire 45 seconds of prep the entire defense gets at the start of a round? That kind of safe time?
---
You’re absolutely right though, the fact that Rook’s ability lasts the entire round, and guarantees a non-headshot down makes his global far more powerful. His win delta backs that up too.
---
You also did not acknowledge my second argument from before.
---
So a friend had to go eat dinner and dropped the moment we had joined a match. Litteraly we were all kicked to the menu ad as I started another queue again with four of us I was shot back into the game alone, minus the last guy we were with. 
---
it was safe to say we lost that one. but we at least fought hard. 
---
Wutever coppers idc
---
Head could be a bit later but otherwise looks great — keep it up!
---
The only problem with this is that most people get so toxic after getting team killed that, accident or not, they would instantly press "NOT forgive"
---
maybe bind it to your mouse.
---
Last kill: “Yea guys I just hit copper IV”
---
You'll learn Dw , the key is to play more and take a break when you're burned out
---
Then it is a fair fight! All cruisers! Fire at will! BURN THEIR MONGREL HIDES! 
---
Is it like Fortnite, where you can literally just plug, in, and play on M&amp;K? Trying to decide if I should buy it. but if that's the case. that's a deal breaker. 
---
Jackal's eyenox doesn't need service to work either. Fairly sure the jammer just fucks up electronics, not just jams connection.
---

---
Meh, i do it all the time on Black ops 4. 65in is enough for split screen. 
---
Yeah that’s it thank you
---
Yep!
---
Probably the 100% CPU bug. 
---
Try either putting your Texture Quality one step higher. Or try capping your frame rate in the GameSettings.ini file. 
---
Hmm. Not sure why you bring up a go4 tournament unless you are using it to flex and say you are better and deserve this valk change lol either way gg have fun 
---
If you finish the game you already get the result of the roll, the animation is just for show, it even works if the servers go down during a match, once you reconnect the percentage will be higher than before.
---
First: new packs confirmed! Hawaii DLC inc :D love that!  
---
Second: as soon as the match is over and you load into the ending screen, the game already knows how much renown etc you gained and if you got an alpha pack or not. I left several hundreds of times without looking at this wheel and every time the percentage was increased or I got a pack. 
---
I got my first one today for the UMP.
---
i love this 
---
Thanks. 
---
This kills me because I play with Melee on F and interact on G. I like being able to knife fast with the F key but for the first month of playing this way I would often drop my rook armour and then immediately knife it.
---
This is one of the best drawings I've ever seen 
---
Wat.
---
Tachanka main is just a joke. I'm a Lesion and Jackal/Dokk main, but play Tachanka when Lesion gets picked by someone else because I have really good results with him. He actually is my highest K/D, mostly on pistol kills while mobile. I don't just sit on his turret usually. 
---
Clearly fake he would have tk you.
---
Yes. Literally one file

I’m saying that when I’m with 3 players that have comp play experience I should be able to deny the rando from giving away the location of my utility that I brought for my squad 
---
On the tail end of the 0th second... Nice.
---
Creative. 
---
This is so good but the sudden cutoff gives me anxiety (yeah I know you can’t technically fade out pen)
---
The crux of this argument is that it is between the people who run these ops and those who don’t and I think that the buff is needed for we who play these ops and I challenge you to find a single valk or echo main who would you agree with you in not adding the option

The twitch drone can be shot, are you actually serious. Maestro has to be on his cams to use them. Kapan has to use the majority of his prep phase sitting up, lesion has to stay alive long enough to max out his utility. I will happily say that all global operators are not healthy for the game and need to e reworked. 
---
Looks like bank to me
---
Hella fun with good bomb defuse denial 
---
I don't remember learning about it in school, but it's definitely one for the books 😂
---
well, you're absolutely right there,and that's why whenever there's a caveira, i don't push alone unless cavvy is dead already or I'm the only one left.(Caveira Main)
---
Pick a different op. 
---
The PDW recoil can be bad but it has gotten me some pretty odd kills.  One kill was when I was running by a door in cafe when I hear movement and the recoil brings my crosshairs up to cabs head through the barricade.  I love both guns but to me the pdw just has the bigger mag cap
---
If your internet is too slow, then it will detect a bad enough connection as -1ms and connect you thinking it's the fastest, used to happen to me a lot
---
global effect abilities have no place in this game, any esport for that matter. its been this long i doubt Ubisoft will listen. but if they do better late than never.
---
Well you reported them alot. What did you think was gonna happen?
---
What rank are you?
---
The fact that it was with one mag just adds to the clutch
---
Looks more like blackbeard cosplaying as maestro.
---
Valk 
---
Ops come first.
---
Since the time I joined, which was BO end, I'd say para bellum.
---
I like iqs better personally. 
---
Are there still people that think the cav changes are a nerf? Sure you loose 3 bullets in your mag and the damage goes down from 99 to 65 but the drop off now is much better and her pistol needs only 2 body shots feom medium range rather than 3 or 4 before the nerf. The changes just take the randomness out of cav. 
---
Basically: good cav players will benefit from the changes, bad cav players suffer from the changes. 
---
&gt;reports friend for toxicity a ton

You'd need a good system to "detect" wrong switching.

Valkyrie
---
There is no auto ban for just being reported, otherwise diamond players and pro players will get mass reported for playing casual
---
Bad Cav players already chickened out and stopped playing her.
---
Yeah para bellum was pretty good 
---
It's not a hologram tho.... ^^^^/^^^^s
---
Mate, pros are asking for a monty nerf.
---
He's that powerful. He doesn't need a buff. He's viable as long as you know how to communicate and llay.

---
Why windowed mode tho?
---
i just mean how its obvious that a live person isn't actually reviewing the stuff
---
I wonder why they chose Doc 
---
His gadget is meant to waste time the enemy drones and doesn’t know where you are you could even be on a different floor, you waste +12 seconds of time and you could get a kill but even just he waste of time is so beneficial.
---
GET YOUR PLATES 
---
At least 6 because of Pick and Ban.
---
If only 2 and both are denied due to opfor's bans, then SOL.
---
If only 4 and the strategy used by your team is countered, your team is SOL.
---
With at least 6, you can have a back up strategy.
---
I kinda thought it looked like an Anki Vector painted to look like mute,But then again,I'm an Idiot
---
Well thats too bad lmao. Her potential  is much higher now with her not being a complete liability at bigger distances, but if theyre not ready to adapt to it its their mistake.
---
Some use all, fraggers use only 3 or 4, like Joystick of empire plays ash, iq, jackal and maybe one other. Kanto as well, ash, zofia, Finka and frag-heavy ops. Hungry is the best ying main, so if you don't ban ying against him, you are in for a nightmare.
---
Some have versatile playstyles, but most have a roster of ops that they are bulletproof with.
---
To me, Maestro is one of the most badass looking ops in the game.
---
I would stick with 2 each, 3 max. Being very good with an operator is obviously great, but you should always have another one that you’re fairly close in skill with for different situations.

Exactly.

At least we know her skill ceiling will increase, so that's good.

If nothing works for you and you play on PC, you could change the server manually.

i'm glad someone else has recognised how cute mute looks when deploying his jammers. it's so adorable lol.

The timer will be more realistic because shebrings ans like im real life phone you'll have a missed call but at the same time you should be able to close the calk

Why does everyone in this subreddit hate actual rainbow 6 players and their opinions?
---
asking for a friend

Bruv I remember when the Alda had an epic hipfire grouping. I didn’t even have to ads.  I think that was a stupid nerf by Ubi imo as not many people main maestro.

Where’s the acog good job tho

by winning/losing. mmr depends on the ranks of the other players, generally if you beat slightly higher ranks you get more, and lower you get little less, and a surrender is just a quick loss

Please break back Outbreak Ubi. And a horde mode/firefight with the Outbreak enemies on normal multiplayer maps would be great too.

I too have that purple and gold bag.

borderline witchhunt request

I also did the same thing same operator same map!
---
Serenity in the background..:(
---
Nothing can be done to him. He will do it in a game if you mention it or not. And I'm not requesting anything. Just venting about ubisoft's shitty punishment system
---
Recoil in rainbow isn’t that hard to manage on pc at least, if you just run recoil intensive guns with attachments that don’t help recoil, and play a few games or some t hunts with it, you’ll build muscle memory fairly quickly. It worked for me.
---
There's*

Pretty much how i survived a 1v4 or 1v5 every damn time. Enemy is being cocky
---
I have posted the radius thing a week ago and got down voted, why they up voted your post? Oh yeah , because you made a picture
---
Well to be fair you're pretty obviously toxic in my opinion. A non toxic person doesn't lash out and hate the community for a vocal minority's actions, a non toxic person would just be angry for a bit and let their anger control them
---
Honestly there is nothing wrong with the current system. You can get 2 team kills provided you didn’t get them in prep phase. If you somehow kill some in the start of the round + another one after you should blame yourself. I do understand where you’re coming from but Ubi is already pretty lenient towards teamkilling.

I know im a scumbag

True! It’s important to watch out for spawnpeeks on coastline, themepark, Oregon etc.
---
Or just add a timer and stop trying to add stupid shit to her gadget 
---
Upload this to wallpaper engine workshop, the people over there would love to see some oc (and definitely not so I can use it)
---
good idea, i think if anything you should just spend another 10 minutes and make sure you're cutting the operators out as cleanly as you can, that's the only issue i see

I'm mad now
---
I have never once been located via logic bomb. If anything the buff part should be applied for sure. I don’t feel like the range limitation is necessary personally. 
---
Ohhh I actually see!!!! 
---
An amazing story nonetheless 
---
Dokki, jackal, Valkyrie, rook
---
I sense the r/Rainbow6Rule34
---
Believe me it’s not just pc. On Xbox my friend got team killed for playing lesion and for his accent, he also aced that round. That is a toxic as you can get. 
---
I think the patch comes out Feb. 5.  Fingers crossed
---
lion isnt too op
---
True. I’m quite low in the skill barrier (Gold II/Gold I) so I’m not that sure about higher levels of play, but increased damage probably would cause hell for the other team. As for horizontal recoil, I never really found it a problem; it was just the vertical I didn’t like.
---
Did you just call a drawing: ink art
---
jackal is the best op
---
J O K E
---
Blitz and Lion aren’t broken.
---
Jesus. One single slip and you’ve fucked it all up, respect.
---
It's mainly cause harassment for femals, young aged or people that cannot afford a good mic on their own yet so they just don't wanna get harassed for bugging their team with the old and good "EArRaPE mIC"
---
I don’t see it, but you can use “hold” instead of “toggle” crouch, it makes it really easy
---
30 seconds I think is reasonable.
---
Ran into a hacker once that did that except he didn't see me. Supposedly he was plat 2 but I doubt a plat 2 would go down to silver 4
---
Because the option is ,get this, optional if i want to assist my team, i will. If my team are just trolling i would much rather prefer to spend my time adjustings my operators
---
You spam pinging cams XD 
---
jk im not hating, gj. But a tip for life is don't mark unless it will help.
---
But why would they rush a deadend with a cav in there with a shotgun
---
Why would a future operators ability have to only counter dokkaebi?
---
Echo can provide visual support, concussive blasts, and news flash.... eliminate finka boosts on an enemy.  Look at that a gadget that can do multiple things.
---
Mute jammers that can stop drones, and look at that... block Lions scan and Dokkaebis calls.
---
So trying to say an operator would only exist to solely counter her is dumb.  The fact someone wants to make that case is silly in of itself.  And if they really wanted a quick soft counter they could make it so Vigil cant get called, make it like his signal disrupts the phone call or something.  That means Vigil can counter Dokk sort of like Cav does Jackal. 
---
I once had to leave a game. I was playing Mute so I placed all jammers and reinforced the site, and when the action phase started, I rushed towards the attackers trying to take at least one out before leaving my team for a 4v5 situation. Sadly I was only able to destroy 1 Twitch drone before dying.
---
Looks like Snape from the Harry Potter Meme
---
Is not a joke , It's just art 
---
Frost is awesome on defense and buck has an amazing gun + ability and frag nades. Otherwise maverick has no counter. Mira is also an amazing defender. 
---
That's all you had to say instead of sounding like an asshole

because it's casual kick your teammate? you've explained nothing and wasted everyone's time
---
Here are my suggestions based on received data:
---
**Attack:**
---
- Capitao
---
- Zofia
---
- Finka
---
- Lion
---
**Defence:**
---
- Valkyrie
---
- Echo
---
- Vigil
---
- Alibi
---
- Maestro
---
- Kaid
---
*If you give me some more information, I may be able to shorten the roster.*
---
Yeah it's fine but believe me I want a pc I just can't afford one so I got a used PS4 for 140 so it's the best I got
---
If the vote kick says 3/4 i just start killing my teammates lol
---
Yeah okay isn't to bad of a compromise 
---
Honestly most of the toxic behavior I've experienced has been from little sqeakers. The ones who aren't toxic try their best and I appreciate how they try to coordinate teamwork, but a lot of their suggestions suck. I've got team killed because I "stole their kill". If they have the maturity, communication skills, and basic human decency then I have no problem and often enjoy playing with them. But too many lack one or more of these and that is just not cool. They chat spam or have annoying music blaring through the in game voice chat. I like good teammates regardless or skill or age, I  hate the stereotyoical 12 yr old CoD squeaker. Play like a decent person, or dont play.
---
Hmm... I just read the last part on the message and realised you were in a different region then me. I'm EU, but I'm sure I can play on SCUS without lag. 
---
Not in ranked 
---
I mean, that's what you suggested/implied in your post :'D
---
Mute jammers are not a good enough counter for lion and dokkaebis... If you seriously think they are all that's needed then you are either misguided or a fan of those operators and so are biased. Also, your examples are not a good representation of what we are discussing, my issue isn't with the gadgets functionality, more the fact it's global and requires no mechanical skill to use, a point you seem to have completely ignored. 
---
No way, 1 minute is way too long. No one is ever gonna let it ring for a full minute. 15-20 seconds I feel is a good tipping point where you would sometimes let it ring (ie when being pushed by the enemy team) or disable it on other times.
---
Anyone who's not in immediate danger, or who is roaming will definitely still manually disable even if there's an auto disable after 15-20 seconds.
---
Are you saying that I'm not? 
---
Very very bad lol
---
I like the concept I just don’t think it fits her
---
Too early to say
---
Oh my bad I just read the title aha
---
This is good advice, listen to this guy!!
---
Play more is all I have to say.
---
I can’t see anything in that clip lol
---
I doubt he’ll like the transition from 850/900 RPM to 585 RPM Frost has.
---
Buck isn’t someone you can attach a “low recoil” tag on.
---
Maverick can work.
---
Mira is not noob-friendly at all and requires a ton of map knowledge.
---
men of culture
---
The game has slowly started to lose its luster and with the fix to the reticles in grim sky the horrid hit detection has just come into focus more. 
---
Also lion wasnt actually that bad finka is and was the one that needed more nerfs 
---
Lesion is the most Op of all listed.
---
Buck has hard recoil 
---
IDK what platform your on I'm guessing console? But it's definitely much better on PC especially with the ability to type
---
better hide you mail
---
Idk really, but I think they only ban you if you play several rounds with the same Hacker. 
---
I call bs
---
Common sense will tell you obviously not.
---
only if you queued with him
---
Please don't let a repost be on the front page again.
---
Hit reg/ hit boxes is practically a dead issue in this game. Nearly all problems have been fixed, a part from the rare and obscure. People need to stop complaining about an issue that isn't there.
---
I always wondered why R6 felt the need to add a filter to the chat that can instantly ban people being racist, etc..
---
  
---
then I remember how the community is.
---
Would place internet router near... just so I can play cars with it
---
Yes, Israel has good standing with *most* countries but I think the Palestine situation is the big political problem I'm referring to.

I'm just so bad at countering him I guess. Always get wallbanged by him. I think his range of the heartbeat sensor should be nerft but that's just me. (sorry for the bad English) 
---
Have to agree, we have a lot of QoL updates but as a whole I do think old Siege was better in terms of community and meta gameplay. Slow, communicative gameplay with teammates compared to lean crouch spamming arcade shooter gameplay we have now, though you're correct in that the slow gameplay masked the issues that have always been there. 
---
Thats a bunch of sweats sitting in discord trying to get a 4v5 situation in QP for the "clutch moments"
---
Yeah then i don't really get why...
---
Are you playing on console or PC ?
---
Bad... I don't care of the rank, i wanna only play, the rank came with time
---
I can understand going down to gold 4, but from plat to silver, That was suspect. Also, it was super easy to win on the first round. I did a 1v1 with him. He just peeked and flashed but I got the kill, then he beat me in 8 rounds in a row. After he started "Tryharding"
---
But he was ash and lean spamming, so I think he turned on hacks then.
---
*ow0*
---
OP blatantly steals the work of others and edits out their watermarks and this community is constantly upvoting all his posts...
---
If i have to clutch like 1v2 and somebody starts vote kick, ill just leave because i dont want to try get win for toxic people
---
And Rogue Spear... And Raven Shield... How I miss thee.
---
When someone played the originals, and read the book feels alienated from Siege because its got nothing to do with Rainbow Six.
---
Thats not to say Siege would be a bad game, its got its own merits but the R6 is just a sticker on it.
---
That font rotation is more frustrating than the skin itself 
---
Ranked is not comp
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I have never seen higher than gold 😒
---
Whats going on big guy, you just stepped on my wife
---
Same here :P
---
Never 
---
my honest opinion on this (level 80 console, level 200+ on pc), I had things like that happen on pc but the community on console is far far worse       
---
they teamkill you way more often and make use of the votekick system because there is not chat implemented like on PC where they can harass you with words           
---
      
---
R6 has been one of the worst experiences ever for me and many of my friends on console, league of legends and cs source/go combined are a blessing compared to this 
---
Sorry shoulda been more clear,  i know its unreasonable to ask but the aspect ratio is a little short therefore if scaled to a dual 16:9 screens the current aspect ration either cuts off a bit of the top and bottom or it leaves black bars on the side. If possible i was just asking for one with an aspect ratio closer to 32:9 to be used on two 16:9 monitors. 
---
I think its because he didn't immediately kill them and went for the interrogation, even though everyone was already down and he knew where everyone was. He would have wasted like 5 seconds of everyones time, apparently that was enough reason to kick him for his team.
---
I wonder how many times this has been posted here
---
Oi this is lit 🔥 
---
That's one of the reasons why I'll jump back straight into ranked. At least I can't get greifed THAT hard and I'm gotten good at giving intel when I'm the first to die.
---
you're not the only one
---
Kix dropping mad bars
---
Oh damn. This needs a fix asap. Pretty useful drone spot for attackers and defenders can't do shit about it
---
Its in beta because ranking multiple players is in it's self, near impossible. There are too many variables, and tracking each and every one of them would require (exaggerating, to a degree) an ai capable supercomputer

I mean yeah, I agree. I'm not going to condemn them for having bugs but at least put some more effort into at least trying to fix them. How hard is it to fix a visual bug that only happens in the menus, when you're already out of the game? It's honestly pretty infuriating.
---
The post has a flair : Fluff !
---
It contradicts the purpose of matchmaking. Siege has a pretty long learning curve than other competitive FPS games and not everyone is equally capable at this game. I've been here since black ice and the highest rank I could reach was plat 2. Isn't this unfair to the lower ranks to match up against high plats or diamonds just because they have a copper in the squad? After all siege isn't all run and gun but strategized execution of plans. 
---
But did you win? 
---
For me the problem is not the time it takes for castle to set up his barricade and so on.. It's the way he's easily countered (Sledge, Ash and everyone with a breach charge or nade).
---
And it can be a real pain in the ass playing as a roamer with a castle on the team who block doorways.
---
My friends are just as unreliable, cuz they did this to me once XD but it wad hella funny
---
Aye yer right
---
&gt; cross-subreddit spam
---
Hey Danilablond what do you mean by cross-subreddit spam , im new in this reddit thing?
---
I almost got kicked yesterday for not clutching a 1 v 5 on casual.... came back to this game after a year. I’ve never seen a more toxic community in a game since the pubg pre-game lobbies.
---
Honestly they should implement a system that you can only get kicked after you team killed someone that would make newer players experience much better tbh. 
---
epic
---
I usually ping on the outside cams because then everyone can see the exact enemy positions and it also ID's them so it's easier to keep track of who is dead. The outside cam will get shot either way 95% of the time so might as well.
---
Of course you don't need to ping more than once, but this was casual anyways so whatever. They still have the camera on the other side which has vision on the repelling players
---

Muzzle reduces vertical climb the most

---
I'm more curiuos about what a "rappel breach" is, is that a hot breach on a window?
---
I tried to play this game a couple of weeks ago for the first time in about a year and got team killed as soon as I spawned in. The very first match. 
---
If it’s any consolation the video just missed me getting yeeted by one. 
---
Actually muzzle break decreases the reset time of the screen aswell so it is always pulling down the recoil for you thus making vertical recoil better and the effect is better the slower the fire rate and worse the higher the firerate
---
Well she’s a guy so

Thanks man,I've loved your country's food ever since I learnt your beautiful language at school,although I'm terrible *por parlez Francois, par quelque chose à propos de raclette qui fait battre mon coeur plus vite*

---
What I'm proposing clearly provides an incentive to play the game in the manner it is intended and not be toxic and you see that as a bad thing, are u surprised I assume you are part of the problem? Your viewpoint is illogical unless you are toxic
---
Dude it's just 4 stacks on casual.. There is no real reason to do it just because they can 
---
Yeah and in none of his videos are people THIS unaware. Not "4 of my team just died right behind me" unaware
---
to be fair, I hinge some of my playstyle on people being able to remove them
---
That's what you get for playing casual 
---
That was a thing in year 1. If you put his barricade up on a door, removed it, and then put a shield in the doorframe, it became impossible to vault over it. This was pretty strong in year 1 since there were fewer ops with explosives. It made some hostage sites impossible to take. 
---
It used to be in ranked, but I'm pretty it's been about a year or so since it was removed.
---
I perfectly understand wanting a slight damage buff on Kaid... But 38 of damage with an ACOG? You are basically asking for Kaid to get an attacker's weapon with that.
---
It’s the dream meme team
---
The fact is toxic players don’t give a shit about their gaming experience they’ll get on an alt if they want to play a actual match and your causation are wrong if you think that how they join matches will make them stop it won’t you don’t care about their experience you just don’t want to have to deal with something you don’t like to when you just haven’t noticed your opinion doesn’t matter.
---
They don't need a reason. They didnt want to play with op and they kicked him end of story
---
Oh yeah, completely forgot about that.
---
It’s the 90 day booster bundle. 3700 r6 credits when a normal 30 is 1800 something. 
---
Yeah dude I feel you, I’m really looking forward to how ranked is becoming more like pro league, should maintain my interest for at least another year.
---
And I myself have a few elites, Halloween, digital content, etc. Just seeing you say that was the first time I did the rough math on it. But if I’m thinking about it: ($game) + ($seasonpass x 4) + (digitalcontent/eliteskins) = $360+* / 5 years.....
---
It comes out to cheaper than almost any other widely accepted subscription (ig. Spotify, Netflix) over the same amount of time..
---
*minimum 
---
What kind of cancer has the matchmaking given *you*?
---
Yeah, but where was this task released? Is it already in-game in the club challenges tab?
---
I dont play ranked
---
Ubisoft needs to get their act together.. So you're saying blitz needs a buff? 
---
I think he needs a slight buff but 38 damage and an acog??? Maybe like 34-35 damage or the acog but with both thats just a bit much.
---
You know what Siege needs to make the game trully enjoyable?
---
\- Give us an option if we agree or not to join ongoing matches
---
\- Give us an option to choose maps to play, AND NEVER FORCE US TO PLAY MAPS WE DON'T WANT
---
\- Team-killing issues? No problem, just add reverse hit, if a toxic idiot wants to kill a team-mate, he dies instead. Only at first 30 seconds.
---
\- Reporting toxic behaviours should bring harsher punishments such as 1 week/1month /permaban for multiple toxicity.
---
\- People exploiting such as crouch spam and/or other exploits that gives unfair advantages should be a instant ban and make their time wasted on opening tickets to UBI for removing the ban and giving reasons and waiting days for an unban. ALL toxic players should be in a permanent list to let UBI check if they deserve a second chance or not. Easy money for UBI, people get banned because of their stupid toxicity but still wants to play siege? buy a new game. Nobody wants to waste money so this will prevents a lot of players to break any rules.
---
\- During the phase when we choose the operator to load the map in background, it's stupid that only after everybody choosed their operator the game start loading.
---
\- Also it's very annoying that we have to wait loooong time for a player that have a potato PC. Just separate players with bad computers with other players that have a good PC. It's not that hard implementing on battleye to read computer specs and decide if is good enough or not.
---
\- Make destructive wood server-side. It's annoying that a piece of wood blocks my view and I can't see shit but other teams kills me because they see from other side.
---
Sorry if this is a common type of post. Just confused us a bit.
---
/u/ubi-noty this bug has been mentioned here a few days ago already; is there a ticket on R6fix/are you guys aware of it?

That is a bug as well as the animation pictured here. Both are making a comeback next week

Do you mean buy Rainbow Six? Or buy a MnK adapter? Cause the latter would be pretty scummy.   
---
If you’re asking if you should buy R6, yeah it’s an incredibly fun and rewarding game and the MnK problem isn’t as frequent as some of the subreddit makes you think it is. 
---
&gt; 3 - I am not really sure what you asked there.
---
i mean, does Glaz bullets go where the sight is aiming? sometimes it feels like it doesnt, even to guy with good ping and hit registration.
---
I actually got TKed yesterday for doing my best. Did something I felt was right after planting, but it didn't work out, so some idiot who was constantly complaining in voice chat TKed me. He had like 11 kills and was a condescending prick throughout the match.

Destroyed

this

You mean the pedo van

Bad manners

Oh

But that's exactly what he asked "why would they kick me" he asked....
---
No. The candy van. Come get some ;) 
---
Why vote to kick needs to be removed case in point. Too much power for how toxic this community is. Especially on console 
---
As I said in many replies and edited post, I will have to move around a lot and won't be able to play on pc
---
[Posted a guess](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/alywlw/first_time_playing_siege_in_67_months_glad_the/efid7rq) a bit lower as to the actual motivation for doing it.
---
I can get that some people think there's no reason and it's just trolling, etc., but there's a reason behind every action -- voluntary or involuntary -- and, with humans, it almost always comes down to emotion or survival.
---
I never understand why they want to kick you out of the team and abandon the chance of winning.
---
Can someone explain this logic to me please?
---
Key words: "and abandon the chance of winning" are you dumb?
---
Yes but like I said we give em a cgance first

Looks good, nice job op.
---
Yes but being a laser beam doesn't help in close quarters fighting especially against a twitch with 900 fire rate. Unless you aim right away for headshot you have a guaranteed loss in that fight
---
Do you serve jell-o?
---
Your up against any attacker with higher fire rate than you, if you miss the headshot you are confirmed to lose the fight
---
Nah, it would better if it was just cav without the face mask and with normal clothes on
---
Next time his team shouldn’t have died like jackasses. There’s a time limit for a reason, if you kick someone for using the allotted time, your a toxic piece of garbage 
---
that's a pretty expensive window alarm
---
A chance for what to irritate you by not playing the way you want ? 
---
Yes, she is just picked more then she should be, its the community's fault for not swapping from Ash, they are stuck to her. Some Ash players ACTUALLY play her for the gadget. I know i wouldn't like to go to that wall and put a breach charge, go back to the spot and then breach, IM LAZY BRUH. All i have to do is shoot her thingy :) 
---
I thinking giving the r4c more recoil, another charge for her gadget, making the g36c the high damage low fire rate low recoil gun, will do much better sense his damage isn't high to pay for the low recoil. From that people will the g36c more for lower recoil that they may like, and Ash will be played for the reason she should be played, at least more.
---
There is no direct change to Ash to make her play rate lower, again, its the community, everyone thinks Ash is their op sense they probably came from cod or battle field, OR they just like the gun, which is dumb, or possibly just not wanting to let the Ash 5 speed rush op no hitbox meme die

just dont take it personally, and see it as a rude random person, you ask in the street for time/direction. (i know weird analogy, but thats the best you get from me) and move to your next game, dont take it to heart.
---
I will stop complaining when, indeed, it isn't there. But it is, so...
---
Ash isn’t overpowered she’s just a fragger nobody cares if she dies. Messing with her guns would make her underpowered... she’s cool as she is 
---
Ever heard of jackals guns?? Also r4 has slower ads time then her other weapon.
---
I tried that and it made it stutter less but the inconsistency was still there 
---
The gun is very good, she has serious window trap utility, the gun is a laser beam with solid damage, it’s better than kaids gun, I don’t see the issue, she’s a very balanced op, and you should be winning close quarters because you’re using a reflex and noobs on attack run acogs so hit your headshot, it’s very easy with that gun 
---
Rappel spam
---
Thanks I'll try it out. 
---
Do not listen to the speed and hit boxes comments please. The reason is that her gun is better for fragging with the 3 speed. Also i prefer her gadget sense it gives you time to be ready to hold the angle you open, while with Zo you have to get cover switch to your gun and peak, which might get you killed

---
Yeah I wouldn't mind if they increase the recoil on the R4-C. Thing never had much recoil anyway and they buffed it for no reason with the new recoil patterns.
---
I wouldn't agree so much on that... her guns have different sides to them
---
AUG - Lower damage higher fire rate
---
The other AR that i do not remember the name of has more damage less recoil and lower fire rate
---
And the yatatatata mechine which i do not have to explain
---
You have better luck finding people on the LFG feature on xbox.
---
Haven't played ranked for like 6 months, didn't even know they took that away, loved watching that animation why would they remove that.
---
Hahaha is that what plat looks like on console?!? 
---
Thermite doesn’t need a buff. 
---
As for Ash, just nerf the R4-C. They’re never going to remove it. Just make it perform like a compact AR (close to an SMG). Give it more recoil (20%+) and lower damage to 33 (from 39). That way it is most definitely a closer performing weapon to the G36C
---
Yes the bullets go to where the sight is aimming, maybe you have too much bounce for each shot, have you tried the muzzle break? Also the hit reg is broken for everyone. #UbiBugs4Life
---
I play on console and it’s the same fucking thing, we can’t hide the fact that the community is shitter than ever
---
C A N C E R!
---
Exactly they all say something like this “ she’s balanced because she’s a fragger, she provides no utility, her gun is good and she’s fast which is how some people like to play, nobody cares when ash dies because she simply doesn’t have any utility she’s just a Run and gun type of operator, as well as all females have the same hitbox”

Yes and the g36c always felt like the lower recoil gun when i was a noob, now i understand it wasn't
---
I used to run G36C because it was easier to control but I think it’s been fixed since when it was bad because I can control the R4-C just fine now, give it a try if you haven’t in a while
---
Here’s how I know it on pc there is a bug where your mic won’t work I don’t have problems with it as I use a 3rd party software called discord but if there is someone solo queuing and he can’t spot the enemy to help his teamate out that’s not good
---
Ah. 3GB of VRAM isn’t helping. Try lowering your texture and AA settings first, maybe try a resolution like 1400x900 if you’re desperate. otherwise I assume it’s drivers. That rig shouldn’t really bottom out so low in normal gameplay. I have a 1050 Ti and usually bottom out around 95 frames
---
Seeing the feedback given they will probably change it in March with the release of Y4S1
---
It showed by me for the best of 10 seconds. The weekend challenge is ticking off as well, meaning there are people playing
---
Same rules as last weekend?
---
It's up for me, in a match atm
---
Serious question: how would you feel about a karma-like system for reporting? Reporting someone would lower your "karma" and there would be a commend button as well (or something of that nature) to raise your "karma". Lower "karma" players would get matched with lower karma players and vice-versa. Toxicity would be more isolated with toxicity and less toxic players would only play with less toxic player.
---
somebody died in open and nobody got the re-frag, had to think where he would most likely be in there 
---
I like this opinion and I've heard of that guy. I'm gonna stick with it. I was just discouraged because we lost 3 right off the bat. 
---
So how do u propose we deal with toxic players then chief? Are u happy that people leave games and TK and get no punishment?
---
Funny thing is, I started on pc recently after playing on xbox and use my elite controller and I was dropping 10/1 kdr in my games

Im talking about the win delta of the mid scene of  wind bastion not pro leauge.

I don't care about it being more like pro league
---
I restarted my game (after I died) because my sound was bugged, my team won that round which won us the game, I reconnected and saw the end screen but still got an abandon sanction and lost a rank 👌👌
---
I really wish they'd actually fix *something*, like I don't get the feeling they're doing much except for releasing skins, are there even programmers working on the game? 
---
On the r6 main page, on the top right hand corner should be three dots. When u select it select user flair, from there you can change it.
---
Dude look you just dont get it. GUNS PLAY DIFFERENTLY. period no way around it. Just because you get a kill with the f2 at the same range or the same way  as dmr doesn't mean the f2 is now basically the dmr. They play differently otherwise there wouldn't be any point in having multiple guns on an op. And mo matter how you put it or what you do shotguns will always be better then assault rifles for rushing, dmrs will always be best for holding an out door peek, lmgs are best for holding an angle with suppressive fire, and assault rifles and smgs are the all around hence why defense only has 1 lmg and 1 dmr and 1 shield, because if everyone on defense has them then they wouldn't need to reinforce just push back at the enemies. Ash is a rusher shes made to be in room first for the attackers to apply pressure aka the best use for a shotgun.
---
Alright, i'll try rolling back the drivers. Thanks
---
Oh, fuck off. "IT DOESNT ADD ANYTHING!!!!" Is such a useless argument that needs to die. They have added many things over the years that don't affect gameplay. It's probably because Ubisoft know the basics of visual design/presentation and is a AAA game studio with the resources to spare. You think this twat would understand that given the years of graphical innovation. Fuck design, people like this want a soulless husk of a game that runs on diesel and pain. Just two squares firing slightly smaller squares at one another until one person sees Winner flash on screen and the other gets ejected into orbit.
---
Your critique is absolutely baseless and useless and makes you look like an idiot. Here's a better one: They removed the round tracker because, between picking ops and spawn, it was just a bit of UI clutter that slowed the time before rounds (At least that's what Epi said in an AMA). If they found a way to implement it that addresses all these issues it would be an interesting and unique aspect to the game, especially important now considering how Ubisoft is a competitive FPS sharing the market with countless others, a little personality is something this game needs. I will say though, it seems unlikely Ubisoft will do something like this unfortunately.
---
I would be too. Good luck!
---
This sucks, but honestly the best solution to this is to find friends to play with. Even if it's just 1-2 at a time it makes  a huge difference.
---
I do agree, she should have a shotgun. I would fucking love it. 
---
R4C just needs a bit more recoil. Give it some horizontal jumps, make it require more skill. 
---
As far as the G36C, I think it’s a staple for the R6 games and it should be used more. It is actually good, but underused because the R4C being better.
---
Our thicc lazy boy as samurai? Itch please
---
Np, good luck 
---
I think it's pretty simple though. Make his barriers two-stage breakable using easy/low exposure explosives/hibanas/ashes/sledges -- things you shoot or throw from far away (leave breach charges the way they are since they require you to walk up to it and expose yourself/feet).  First explosive cracks it and leaves holes you can see through, but you can't quite get in.  and second takes it down.  I'd accept 2 of these instead of 3 even with this mod.
---
That only happens in Gold rank and above. Below gold is mostly the dregs of humanity and trolling 12 year olds. If you can get one good game out of three (where you don't get teamkilled) then it's a good night.

---
Ranked is the competitive game mode for Siege.
---
It isn't fun. Players keep dropping out like a normal casual.
---
Also, there's no reveal or 6th pick.
---
&gt;I like Siege because it's tactical.
---
I hold angles all day as a defender and lose to some guy that just sprints around the corner and instantly headshots me. Can't call this game tactical.
---
I think the issues it is that only show kill/death as a metric and not team work. It's the same idea that your K/D isn't as important as W/L. 
---

Bucks C8. The recoil is rough but once you get a handle on it, it shreds people. Also learning how to properly play him is a huge boost. Any coordinated team with a good buck player is terrifying.

Restart your game

Most of the Triple A games have that option but Ubisoft is just a small indie company

My only gripe with P&amp;B is that its *too long*. Theres always that one clown that doesnt click anything so you just sit there for 30s, or 2 minutes in total. Should be reduced to 15s.

---
So all except Caveira, Vigil, Clash, Doc and Pulse.
---
There will 99% sure be one the weekend of the 16th of February
---
looks like 3armor
---
•Is the new mode fun?
---
Yes, very.
---
•What is your experience with the ban phase? Which operators get banned the most?
---
Blitz is being banned almost every match. Lion, Twitch, and hard breachers make up the rest of the attacker bans. I love banning Finka, though.  
---
Mira and Echo are the main defenders being banned. Followed by Caveira, Clash, and Lesion.
---
•Do you enjoy the attack/defense rotation? Is one side favored?
---
I'd rather go back and forth, still. It gets old playing on one side, and breaking it up also helps prevent teams from completely dominating or being completely dominated.  
---
Defense is favored. Always has been and always will be. As long as we're not playing House or Favela, defense has the advantage. If you play your cards right, in the banning phase, it can become even more difficult for an opposing team to come back after losing the first 3 rounds.
---
•Does the limited map pool fit the playlist?
---
It "fits", sure. Is it too limited? Yes. I'd rather play the full Ranked playlist. I already was playing Coastline, *every Ranked session*. So \*\*\*\*ing tired of that map. With the banning, it's fun to see what can be done on the sites that were once less desirable.
---
•What is your opinion on the mode being Bomb-only? Do you enjoy the increased planting/defusing duration?
---
Bomb is the most balanced mode, but I'd be fine with playing this style with the other modes. Again, the banning system is what is fun about this mode, in my opinion. We should still alternate each round between attacking and defending. Imagine Secure Area or Hostage without alternating... that makes it defender favored even more so than Bomb.
---
•Should this mode be implemented for Ranked play?
---
Just the banning. Maybe the longer plant and defuse, sure.
---
•Should this mode be implemented for Casual play?
---
Probably not. If you just add the banning to Ranked, that isn't too much of a difference between Casual and Ranked.  
---
Casual rounds should be 3 minutes, though. We can handle shorter rounds.
---
•Should this mode find a permanent place in a separate playlist from Ranked or Casual?
---
If you add a separate playlist, making it a 3rd option, that divides the playerbase even further and this game will begin to lose players because loading into games will take longer. It already can take 6-8 minutes for me to find matches when I'm solo, during the afternoon. That's too long when compared to other multiplayer games.
---
Weekends only
---
Yes this is a good idea but wait a little bit after words if you want to because a lot of hackers get more accounts on the sale do the last day Munro it porobably won't work though 
---
I’m horrible at the game and I can buy all of them with cash. 
---
No skill required.
---
The next free weekend will most likely be 15th Feb during the pro-league finals - (going on past free weekends).
---
That's why I like roaming. Holding angles sucks because you're standing still and waiting. If you roam you can listen for footsteps and make decisions, while if you anchor the footsteps just make you sweaty since you're basically pinned to the room. At least that's how I feel about it
---
Yeah, it happens a lot.

It is working now

---
Ditto but with Nomad
---
ash elite doesnt count unless black viper
---
Yeh I saw a clash buff idea and it was to make her burst a flames but it slowly gets weaker the  more bullets in the magazine you fire 
---
I agree with most people that this should be the new ranked mode, but I also really enjoy the fact that there is currently an **unranked** mode that is fun to play. Being able to choose spawns and sites without worrying about rank is so great. I love being able to experiment without negatively affecting my future games, or those of my teammates.
---
happens to me as well during the past two weeks
---
Well I mean those will run faster but my friend has a 6GB and he gets a steady 200 at ultra settings with the extra graphics pack.
---
You’re right. Just saying it’s annoying 
---
CS doesnt have Killcams, you can usually tell when somebody is cheating anyway. And it´s not like you having a killcam reduces the ammount of cheating in the game. It just punishes more legit players imo as it gives you intel on what they did to kill you.
---
Kafe is okayish, Theme Park is not and Hereford is basically a bigger Barlett, no thanks. Casual has MM, just put leave penalty in and be done with it.

That's great news. I haven't heard that. Also never actually heard of someone who was diamond on xbox so props to you (obviously I knew they were out there but, they're the top 1%). 
---
Ranked is still in beta. So...
---
This is gonna be way easier.
---
Can you do a phone background of maestro saying "after this drinks are on me" in this style XD
---
Casual should stay as casual is currently. This should then become Ranked and keep the maps that are played at pro play only. Then have a third mode called Unranked, whereby this is the mode but with the current Ranked map pool and includes new maps. We now have enough players for 3 separate modes where there is a healthy player base for all 3 of them
---
* *Is the new mode fun?*
---
Yes!
---
* *What is your experience with the ban phase? Which operators get banned the most?*
---
Overall it's going well. I feel like Blitz/Lion/Any Hard breacher are common for ATK, and Cav/Echo/Mira are the popular ones on DEF.
---
* *Do you enjoy the attack/defense rotation? Is one side favored?*
---
Yes, very much so! I like the 3 back-to-back rounds before swapping sides. I enjoy both ATK and DEF
---
* *Does the limited map pool fit the playlist?*
---
I wouldn't mind having more variety -like the Ranked playlist with these PL settings.
---
* *What is your opinion on the mode being Bomb-only? Do you enjoy the increased planting/defusing duration?*
---
I enjoy bomb the most, but Secure and Hostage do have their moments. As for the plant/defuse time, I've not really noticed, so I will say that it's fine.
---
* *Should this mode be implemented for Ranked play?*
---
YES, PLEASE!
---
* *Should this mode be implemented for Casual play?*
---
I'd prefer if the PL became the new ranked, and Ranked became the new Casual -in other words, full casual  map pool, no abandon penalties/etc, but have the 3m rounds and spawn selection from Ranked setting. 
---
* *Should this mode find a permanent place in a separate playlist from Ranked or Casual?*
---
I feel like that would splinter the player base a bit. Like I mentioned in the bullet point above, rotate Ranked to Casual, and make the PL the new Ranked format (with a larger map pool just for variety, maybe kick in Secure/Hostage). 
---
Wow, look at this .9 shitter.
---
That’s really cool would definitely buy it if it was in the game
---
For the same reason, people assume you're playing with a m&amp;k on console if you do good.
---
At least I play ranked ;)
---
Ash = no skill
---
Elite = Skills but down 0-2
---
Trash, change my mind
---
Monty takes a different skill set than other ops. Honestly he's very difficult to play effectively. So the kids that are saying that "Monty takes no skill" are utterly wrong. You're simply movable cover for your team and knowing what your shield does cover and doesn't cover requires a certain skill set imo. 
---
They already have the code for wildlands. I feel like they could copy and paste then touch it up a little 
---
How many elites are there? I own them all 🙄
---
Finka got downs

It more falls along the line of are they smurfing and doing it purposely 
---
Or are they actually new and have no idea, it’s easy for me because you don’t see a mute putting hammers in the hallway 
---
I created the same topic 6 hours ago
---
- Ban phase is a mixed bag. Whilst I like the idea in prospect, it basically turns into a ban blitz/lion simulator and that's just not very interesting or tactical. It's also an absolute mess if you're not in at least a 3-man. Still, it's reasonably interesting I guess. It makes far, far more sense at a pro team level though, and in a game which centralises around certain characters (Hard breachers/denial), there's far more potential for producing stupid games out of it than say, in dota.
---
- Attack Defense Rotation is something that can work, but it's really contigent on the maps being well balanced for each side, which kind of kills any attempts at making deliberately Def/Atk sided maps in the vein of nuke in counterstrike. I generally just don't get the point.
---
- The map pool should be at least 9 for my money. Any smaller than that and you've got little oppurtunity for experimentation and it's gets repetitive quickly. I'd argue the same for pro league - 9 maps is not too much to learn.
---
- Bomb only is good. I'd like to think hostage could be revamped into a competitive mode someday but Secure area is a lost cause.
---
- This mode should be for ranked play, but as a third playlist called competitive with it's own MMR. Siege has more than enough players to support it, and some of it's features (small map pool, bans) can be seen as constraining and aren't for everyone.
---
the mode right now is still not ranked, of course there are going to be people leaving. if it was implemented in ranked leaving wont be a problem(well,it will be less of a problem).
---
They kicked you and lost that round...idiots

Only the beginning
---
I mean, you left a ranked game on match point and you're complaining about getting banned? It's not like there's a little bit of code here and there they can go oops I see that's wrong let me fix that and boom works perfectly. They fix a lot of bugs each patch, unfortunately adding more content ends up introducing more bugs, this is an underlying issue with a bad engine or rather a game that's built on an engine that's not fit for purpose. 
---
Honestly issues that ruin the experience for me only come up a few times every few hours maybe, and only if I'm taking the game seriously. I understand for people who really want everything to be perfect they're gonna dislike a lot about siege, but it's come so far and will continue to improve over time. It's easy to see the negative stuff and forget about the positive changes. 
---
Of course the sound bug wasn't your fault, but it was your decision to leave on match point, I don't know what ubi could have done for you there, everyone gets bugs in any game

Had to remove it for being toxic, sorry bud.
---
1) I'd prefer Mute to prevent Dokka calls and Lion scans. 
---
2) No, he edges will still be breachable 
---
3) No, it's just the hitreg in this game and sometimes you may only be hitting the clothes of the enemy, which does nothing
---
4) Higher ping used to give you an advantage, but now it's fixed and will be a disadvantage to you. It will get a little more difficult but one can get used to it. Getting a better router will mostly only increase the range of your wireless connection. If you're cabled then you're fine.

It’s extremely annoying. It was 0-3 and we started to come back, on the round before ot he obviously left and turned on walls. We eventually got it down to a 5v2 on the last round and he crashed the server. I don’t understand how these people are still low silvers lmao.
---
The joke
---
That pic in the top right lmao
---
It's normally not like that. I think the main issue in Casual is that the rounds are way too long. When I occasionally play Casual, I usually play at a speed I would in Ranked or Comp. Usually, in Ranked, I would die with like 90-30 second to go, but with that speed same speed in Casual, I have to sit and watch a Fuze sitting on the roof doing nothing.
---
If you're getting voted out like that in Casual, you're probably doing nothing but holding an angle from outside even though the defenders have no clue where you are, let alone going to challenge you. 
---
If you play Casual as a warm-up, stop, and just play T-Hunt, even on normal if you want.
---
Learn to frag, be aware of your surroundings. I've only accidentally killed a teammate once in two years of playing. Since then I've been careful about what I do
---
I'm not sure if blitz really needs a nerf, it's just he is really annoying.
---
Repeating waves of people trying to copy famous R6 youtubers with following features:
---
\- Colored subtitles all around screen
---
\- Acting like being mental, commonly one retarded friend 
---
\- Loud as fuck audio of people talking
---
\- "Hilarious" plays that in fact are not either funny nor good
---
\- Lack of any good content
---
\- Dramatic zooms
---
\- Recruit/Tachanka memes 
---
yeah that's from top of my head, all R6 youtubers nowadays are just annoying fucks copying each other
---
Might be, but that [same uniform and beret was used in WW2](http://www.9thpara.net/images/9thatthunder.jpg) as well. I agree with the Blitz helmet, but the rest doesn't look like 80's to me.
---
This is cool.
---
i mean yeah, i more or less was just wondering what kind of person says that someone is the issue just because they point out a flaw in your grand plan to stop toxic behavior. and this post wasn't even a forum to talk about ideas. you stated your plan, someone disagreed and you said, and i quote, " I'm.guessing you are toxic player " without offering any counter to his point. so it clear that anything brought to this discussion would not merit your actual time to think of a decisive answer or debate worthy retort.
---
 i hope you take this experience and choose to grow from it but i cant force you to do anything, all i can do is wish you the best and hope you succeed in your life. best of luck to you my man.
---
Beatiful. See ya on the front page
---
It’s not op tho
---
thank
---
I think lowering should lower your 'karma' after a few gimmies, whatever the average player reports per month.  If someone reports everytime someone kills them or someone doesnt clutch on their team, they will add up fast and start to decay the karma.  After a couple accidental team kills or injuring teammates your karma also decays. Too many reports against you, also could downgrade it.
---
@angry_impreza
---
It do be like that.
---
I restart the search after 2 minutes 
---
It will update after a while
---
You do know that it said attackers win the round right?
---
lmaoo tom and jerry
---
Way I see it is why pick me for being alive when you being alive would have helped, would accually hate to be a new player to this game lol.
---
I ehh dont think this is a good idea because the purpose of fuze is to create chaos not like to be a fragger like buck
---
Echo is not op but lion is still broken if lion was not broken he would be allowed in pro-league 
---
Where?? 
---
why not just let go of the barricade button? I mean you have to hold it till its finished so letting go just stops it?
---
No I'm arguing that its better for a rush. I'm not arguing that anyone that is competent can use ether however. Recectly I almost got an ace and it was taken away because an ela managed to out gun me as bb with her shotgun when I had every advantage. Was on plane in cargo and she was peaking around the post or luggage thing was pretty smart
---
Fuze time
---
God no I barely have time to finish a normal game of ranked as it is, Ubi better not make it any longer. 
---
I don't get it, what's wrong? 
---
Damn a cav elite would be dope af. Looking forward for it
---
Uh lion banned proleague ugh
---
I need to find a decent comp group for R6 on PC. Would be fun. And people who know that not everyone is gonna be god at the game, and don't take it so seriously as my friend group does...
---
Wow people here really don't like Neotokyo I guess.
---
I can hear this image
---
Do you not have the whole comic? In the rest of it, echo reveals that he uses hentai magazines instead of plates. 
---
I dont really agree I think hes in a good spot 
---
You don't need to destroy drones fyi. 
---
The challenge never awarded me a pack
---
so its reportable for toxic behaviour?
---
As cool as that sounds thats OP
---
Hello General-0rgana, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/am470w/rs6_matchmaking_broken_on_xbox/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Can't remember it either, you must've made it up.
---
I want the challenge, other people want the challenge, the packs have cool stuff and there's no penalty for leaving.
---
It's just going to happen, I like to stay for the renown, but maybe those people don't have a lot of time or it's a day off work and that's their playtime for the week. 
---
Well, you posted a photo of your penis on Reddit. 
---
Maybe stand back, then shoot, and if u did do that, then rip
---
Nice!!! I love the speed of the smoke in the background 
---
His position in the meta is to make defenders reposition, you can't really do that well if you don't have anywhere to do that.
---
Most attackers are just playing for the challenge pack and not the game itself, which doesn't help. 
---
While I agree there should be a safeguard, that is inching towards the trap we are already in. Too much safeguarding against that leads to an ineffective system. Ubi would have to balance that very carefully or implement some other kind of method to avoid report spamming. 
---
It would be the same as attacking from above.
---
This always happens when your the only one with a kill too. Just be glad you didnt have to spend the next 15 mins getting your ass kicked. 
---
I'm not yet sure why this information is important, but thank you anyway. 
---
No I did not catch that actually.  Thank you for pointing that out. 
---
there is no overpowered defender but a lot of overpowered attackers.change my mind.
---
You can't play with your steam friends anyway. You add people on Uplay regardless of whether it's launched from steam or Uplay. 
---
They're exploiting a system that is in place for people who genuinely disconnect, they're cheating. 
---
The size of kaids member....
---
I would say yeah
---
Interesting, I’ll have to give it a look. Thanks for letting me know.
---
anything is reportable for toxic behavior
---
Damn it, it's beautiful.🤤
---
What about him starting the motorcycle with batteries then blowing the gas at the camera when it zooms in so it fades with the exhaust?
---
Tom and Jerry reference...nice touch.
---
Her face looks so weird. 
---
Whoa. You sound like you took this so personally. 
---
And that's not the case i was already in the building and didn't sit still even for 2 seconds. They probably triggered when i pulled out my drone because i needed info to work with. None of them gave any calls.
---
so you gonna leave this hearing?
---
It definitely seems that OP's teammates were tired of another cav teabagging for freakin 1 minute. Some cavs just LOVE being toxic af.
---
this pretty much
---
Sends the report to a remote village in Austria where a team of elite commandos commences hunting down the target. 
---
Coming from a defending Ela main, I could have potentially done that with both, the Scorpion has low damage but a pretty good ROF.
---
Yeah, but he only really works well when you have good spots to use your clusters on, that sort of relies on the floor above being viable for using your clusters on, or a lot of un-reinforced walls.
---
In all seriousness, Thatcher will 100% work towards the challenge. 
---
Pretty sure that’s not how freaking lightning works.
---
Your comment is cringe. 
---
How?
---
Did you add the challenge in the first place?
---
Extra THICK
---
They don't take memes that they like down...
---
It’s rude unnecessarily. 
---
Tachanka isn’t copper, he is Diamond 
---
Kinda knew wasn’t sure but I just deleted the post so ya
---
are you this stupid
---
Attack harder tho
---
Fuse is also meant to clear defender utilities not just get kills he’s especially use when there is a frost. 
---
I got to 24 on the drone challenge then remembered to electrify barbed wire with laid and bandit and breezed the last few.
---
/u/coreross
---
The FBI is in route to your current location
---
There's no logic. Just toxic nonsense. 
---
Fair criticisms, but definitely wrong to say I make YouTube videos and "pray they will be famous."  Fame is overrated. I understand it is much better to have a couple close friends than be loved by thousands of people that don't really know you.  Its not the money either, I don't make a cent off these videos.   
---
I make these videos because they are what I would enjoy watching and I want to make other people laugh.  I understand that I can't speak for everyone, and a lot of people do get into making videos for the wrong reasons. But don't act like you know everyone. I don't want to be antagonized for trying to show people what I've made. I spent a year recording and a month editing it, knowing I wont get a penny out of it. Then I got to share the video and I'm the asshole? 
---
I'm not even mad at you, because you aren't the only person who has this sentiment. Most people hate anything from YT under the assumption I'm trying to make money off them. 
---
There already is a no walls mode in the game. You and your friend go the pasta duo with AA-12s and delete those walls faster than ash dodging headshots. 
---
Yeah those are breakable
---
Hello Chrimorks, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/am52bw/discord_chat/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Mate that's not rude, if you are offended by that you need to reassess your life
---
I thought I was just very bad with Glaz, shooting what I thought were headshots and bodyshots and then seeing enemy with 100% health in kill cam. But now that I've searched Reddit by "glaz hit reg" and seen multiple posts about this I feel a little better.
---
You told some one else you knew the answer
---
Not with that fucking haircut 
---
But isn't that a fundamental issue in game design? 
---
Just give him IQs elite skin. Id love to see my Bandit dressed in green.
---
No
---
It's a viral meme... 
---
What do you mean? I can hear that damn drone and Thomas The Blitz Engine coming for me right now.
---
after five minutes restart q
---
&gt;	hear
---
Come
---
On
---
Man 
---
You don’t get to decide what’s universally rude lmao
---
Why don’t you reassess your logic?
---
I’m really liking the format, but if they make this the new ranked it doesn’t have to mirror pro league exactly.  Keep the same maps we have in ranked today and include the killcam.  
---
I'd recommend Frost or Lesion. If you start using Lesion you'll win a lot more matches 
---
No she’s not from Lisbon but I think she might be bisexual
---
yeah
---
It's not a solution to the garbage that is client side debris, but I find that knifing the barricade instead of punching it seems to make it happen less often 
---
Bro what are you the comment police?? Just take your offended ass out of here
---
i don't teast anything
---
Moddos why advertising discord but not guides for new players? 
---
Maybe throw some transitions when switching clips and some stutter effects. But clips are a lot more entertaining than full rounds
---
Calm down kid. Sorry you got called out. 
---
I mean, yeah, although the animation could possibly stay for deploying them on the ground or on nearby walls.
---
 [u/UbiNoty](https://new.reddit.com/u/UbiNoty) Hi-res version please? :)
---
No.
---
Shirt! 
---
It’s a plane! 
---
Kid? Judging from your comments you are the kid mate
---
Nah
---
I've gotten so many kills like this. I use red silk on most of my guns too lmao. R u me 
---
So should I just not be ADSing with a shotgun?
---
True... He can still effectively do that though.
---
It’s very easy to do that just lose games
---
Looks like a Japanese GIGN member but nice though
---
Sure would 
---
Yes absolutely. 
---
Why?
---
Just like June 4th, 1989
---
You ever get weirdness quitting the queue? Sometimes it thinks you're in a game when you re-start the queue.
---
Big facts. 
---
Also delete acog pistol
---
&gt; Ever played a game where having high latency would be advantageous?
---
no. but you said previously that it used to be an advantage. i know its a disadvantage, but i wanted to hear someone else say it because many people seem to think its an advantage. when they get my shit registration, then they will know that is all bullshit.
---
could be the distance the the server you are connected to at the time
---
Isn’t that the definition of overpowered? You can have the literal best player to ever touch the game versus a Silver 3 Monty sitting in a corner and the silver wins it.
---
Doesn’t it make sense for the skillcap to allow the better player to have a chance to win?
---
Wtf
---
Even tho I don’t have a pc im gonna get a steam account and buy for the future lmfao 
---
Exactly. It’s the same if you blame a casino for you losing money. It’s your own fault and it’s just bad luck
---
The real issue here is the G36C 
---
Got his original jamming radius too
---
So fuck the other team who's not having fun.
---
Doc, rook, jager, lesion, echo, frost. Pick any one and you're good. All of them have good guns, abilities or both and echo rook and doc also have acogs. 
---
mods will delete this because god forbid anyone criticizes their game
---
We all know that is bs
---
Lol no
---
Don’t think I don’t see the pic in the back
---
It’s not his fault he wants to dress up his ops and Ubi wants money. ^/s
---
1. Maybe
---
2. No
---
This is the most relatable thing I’ve ever seen lol.
---
You can do that if you 5 stack in csgo i believe might be wrong but thats happened to me.
---
I am aware of trust factor, but if Im forced to play over 1000 hours of shit matches to start having a good time, sorry but thats not acceptable. Siege has a steep learning curve, it can be harsh to start with, but csgo has a similar curve, top that with the fact every match makes you wonder why you play in the first place. Never got that with siege.
---
I love csgo, but I refuse to play matchmaking, and so did my friends, they couldnt bare to play till rank 21. if you dont mind playing with nothing but smurfs hackers and toxic russians good for you, but thats far from the worst side siege
---
he's gonna kidnap caveira and blind her
---
I’m crying. 
---
I mean Kapkan says it all 
---
It was a joke. The starter edition is so bad that ubi made it cost more than standard so noone touches that shit with a 12 feet pole.
---
If you're waiting for more than 7 minutes, you're wasting your own time
---
Oh man. How mistaken you are.
---
Give me a few examples of changes that the Pros wanted that ruined game balance.
---
Recoil control is an issue for me with the R4C, still love it though.
---
Are you making me choose? Oh boy, I'm unconventional and disagreeable in so many ways, from disliking the ACOG to thinking Shotguns are actually really good.
---
You show me a tower around the cost of my used 229$ PS4 I got at gamestop lmao then we’ll come up with a plan
---
You still are... in casual people go to play the game right? And you’re barring them from doing that for a match.
---
puss
---
Lol, I like how all the fanboys mindlessly downvote any comment stating that this is not a bug and this was made on purpose so you couldn't bitch about diamonds playing with coppers. 
---
Because of you this game is broken and furthermore turns into Ubi's cash cow. Stop believing this bs and let's make them actually fix their game and not make excuses. 
---
Yeah everyone just jumps the gun on anything besides the R4C or the 416 
---
Neverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
The mad lad doesn’t stop
---
I do it for you guys 
---
well ubi don't know if you gonna read it or not but however... deleted the game f\*ck ubisoft and if there is anything i would do is don't play games anymore from ubisoft.....
---
Servers are shit
---
matchmaking is poop
---
and the russians on the eu server is manure....
---
The only question is why it was re-posted. I've seen it before with plenty of upvotes; unless it miraculously got deleted.
---
For months people, streamers, redditors, have all began to notice that in dev blogs, Ubi will say things along the lines of ‘based on feedback from pro league’ instead of ‘based on community feedback’ quite often 
---
Nah it's just on sale
---
I'd take Caveira with just Silent Step, no Luison or Interrogate, but yeah.
---
Yeah what he said
---
God damn! That impact went right up her ass!!
---
[reminds me when n0thing pulled of this sick pistol round on cs:go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNJY_bRVPY)
---
You know that it was all for a joke and a shitty video right? if you get triggered by teamkilling, don't watch it? I even said triggerwarning. If the players that i've killed are okay with it and tought it was a joke, why can't you?
---

You're acting like it's every game, it's not, and it's not like just because you're going against higher ranks you're going to lose, you can win, and lots of times people do. But if no one new is playing you're just going to get more competitive teams and you'll match with higher ranks more often because there's less lower ranks that normally only play with their friends - this isn't some epidemic, it's juts some matches you're faced against higher ranks than others, suck it up and do your best, your ability to have fun isn't dependent on your opponent, if it were the game wouldn't be fun because you'd have to be playing people below your level to have fun, but playing against higher levels makes you better, but if you're juts saying "screw it, I'm going to lose because they're higher ranks" you're not going to get better and you're going to have this problem more and more. 
---
Agreed you don't need that negativity in an already toxic game
---
I think i agree especially with the water gun ( AUG A3 ) buff
---
Mira
---
That's a good question I think maybe the reload button could work but maybe not.
---
Might as well delete now because no one will respond. Use the LFG feature on xbox. 
---
I only use ACOG on defense, and use shotguns quite often. You’re a god, don’t worry 
---
Mira.exe has stopped working.
---
They just got released..
---
They got ugly Year 4 Pass exclusivs and next Season they will get Pro League Gold Sets.
---
Everything else is random.
---
What about maestro alda ??. 35 damage 900 rpm acog . And a 81 rounds in 1 magazine . 
---
I think he's irritating to fight, like several other operators, I don't think he's OP.
---
Yeah. That's the whole point of the post.
---
Usually they still want the normal version to be more pricy, not this time though.
---
Please make this the new ranked and make current ranked the new casual. It just makes too much sense
---
Yea I stopped playing for a month cuz I kinda got sick of it but when I got back the first game I got into I immediately got kicked. It kinda spoiled the game for me and now i don’t really play at all anymore. RIP my 1400 hours on siege
---
Haha I like that caveira get banned two times. 
---
Ik with pc you really need to aim for the head. With consoles it’s hard to find players actively aiming for the head so body shots are the go to. Also it’s just how I played that game. My other clips I’m usually aiming higher up.
---
I think the animation is decided at the time of the melee.  You need to be AWAY from the barricade and then close in on it in order to knife it.  If you are near a wall/barricade and melee then pull away, you will just weapon melee the air.
---
Honestly dont think we would know unless ubi release a statement about it cuz i've destroyed grzmots, gu mines and jammers that didnt count
---
Practice. Then practice some more
---
The guy came from the side door that he wasn't watching and then the guy missed a couple shots.  Do we really need to make posts like this shaming people for not having good aim in video games?
---
I do hope though that it shows how much people hate playing blitz, dokkaiebi, lion, cav and clash
---
Show me where I said they weren't viable in bomb. 
---
That sounds right, my B
---
I’m not saying OP, I’m just saying they are incredibly strong and are seeing a lot of use rate at the moment. We don’t need a duplicate operator.
---
it really fits echo + he's a 3 armor so the metal plate is still fitting 
---
At least it’s in T hunt
---
I am, I ripped the knees slightly and everything 
---
I did buy the elite Frost cause she looks fuckin dope 
---
I can understand that, I see it from your perspective 
---
Everyone help out the community. I wanna see Lesion, Kapkan, Mute, Bandit and Jager in every match!
---
I think this happens a lot more if you move backwards while melee. When i play valk i break the barricades moving forward continuously and seems to push the debris outwards. Idk maybe it could be the melee physics.
---
You get the *Year Pass* exclusiv Uniform and Headgear for all 8 Year3 Operators.
---
And all bonuses since the *Year 3 Pass* is still active till 4th March.
---
The only thing you dont get is *Damascus Steel* because its a preorder Skin.
---
When I was 13 I was searching hard for that good NSFW shit.
---
The challenges last 3 days
---
I wouldn't mind if he was a lower level but he's around level 90, yes
---
"damn dis bish got sum fine ass ass"
---
Alibi is Libyan
---
Destroy one gadget and you will have participated. 
---
The problem was the guy that came from his left was really loud, really easy to see on the right side of his screen, and proceeded to mess up an easy kill. All of that is the problem, not just the aim
---
At least it's *valanced*
---
It’s not that hard with console, I play on it and it’s easy.
---
Woah relax. I didn't read the other comments, they were under threshold. I had no idea you were a student with no money to spare.. 
---
Should be less subtle. 
---
I read your memory card...I can detect the toxicity from here. 
---
I read your memory card...I see you like fuzing the hostage.
---
I read your memory card...you can stop worrying about PMCs now
---
People give in to peer pressure so easily. Start of the round, people start to try to kick one guy. I ask why, and they say, "just because", and I say no. Then they kick prompt me. The guy who was going to be kicked "just because" votes yes, I get kicked.
---
I consider doc pretty weak to be honest. His gadget really isn't very useful
---
Erm.. no thanks. I have a hard enough time scrolling through all the charms I'll never use. There are many other things the UI team can do with their time.
---
As far as I'm aware, yes, but they might be half, I'm not 100% on that. 
---
Might be pretty basic, but I am not good at Siege so I got really excited! 
---
it looks really well but mute's pants are like a bit thiccer 
---
An actual answer:
---
The thing happening in this scene is Speed Shooting, you can tell cause Finka has a stopwatch, and both of them have safety glasses. Someone pulls a gun out their holster and shoots 3 rounds as quickly and accurately as possible. Finka is impressed because Alibi is good, which ties into Alibi's lore of being great at shooting competitions.
---
Right behind where that rook is standing is a door that leads to the outside
---
I would probably like it, if it were more around the size of a map like Border or Coastline.  For me the sheer size, on top of being 3 levels is just too much.
---
Maybe not having the ACOG is a good idea, this is further explained in flashbangs.
---
I would not keep the flash-bangs as that could result in broken spawnpeeking (You could chuck the flash into their spawn and they are history at that point) but I dont know
---
The smokes will have to go since one defender already has smokes (only difference is that they kill)
---
Keeping the impact will probably be useful for traversing the map but only if the operator has already use the gadget they have unless they have impacts
---
I would suggest it being like the ammo boxes in Terrorist Hunt, but cannot be used to restock Nitro Cells and only one operator has a restock with about 30 extra ammunition for their side arm but 25 for their primary, this is to make it more similar to Rook.
---
tbh who cares
---
I second this. Op needs to train himself to always look at the compass and room name. That way he can immediately say "church S.E." or whatever. As time goes on he'll learn and remember the calls. 
---
I actually hated it, it makes kills the only stat that matters. Which as we all know intel is the real game changer.
---
-$15 dollars because of the free Ash Elite. But also potentially even more if he spent a lot to get the Black Viper version.
---
Wonderful critiques, agree with everything
---
Hello ctb614, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/am6u0v/major_voip_problem/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They stopped counting the bullets fired mechanic a while ago, I wouldn’t be able to tell you why they did it
---
For those who really care, she’s timing the way Alibi shoots at something and is obviously impressed by it idk
---
I love this game but due to the insanely high levels of toxicity I just dont want to keep playing it.
---
Show me the part where I'm angry. I was having a normal discussion with someone else 
---
Yea
---
Seems about right. Nothing has changed. They need to implement a new system. 
---
When your ping is higher than your score 
---
cheetah would be a cool name
---
For better or for worse?
---
Rook when people try taking a donut
---
I can’t view your account
---
Sure thing, but if its going to be hard to accomplish, Id like the reward to be more substantial, like another pack lol
---
Thanks for the suggestion! Will try that out. 
---
He comin
---
Every console clip on this sub is so dumb. It's a bunch of players running in 1 by one not paying attention. 9/10 PC players don't do that
---
yeah siege on console is infected with m+k, bunch of pussies with no skill everywhere. reason i stopped playing this game
---
ah sound cheers 
---
Ok thanks 
---
You could put right lean on q and left lean on e. So when you are holding a to move left, you still have a finger to press e (left lean) and vice versa. 
---
Personally, I just use the default just fine, it just takes a week or 2 to get used to it. Trying other binds just messed with my head and would have taken longer to get used to in comparison to the default.
---
They can teamkill though, had that happen loads of times.
---
Wooooooosh
---
That's a lot of damage 
---
You are an idiot, you missed the joke
---
Though i can imagine it’s more unforgiving on console, since it’s basically cheating.
---
he/she could have two ladders that also could be reused/destroyed, maybe 3 seconds of deployment time 
---
Thanks. Will try this aswell. 
---
A weapon to surpass metal gear!

It has nothing to do with who is new or not. 
---
It is purely about balance. People who are new at the game, have no idea how to play it, people who are shit at the game, like myself and you, don't know how to play the game. 
---
We have no idea what the hell we're doing. That's why we're bad in the first place.
---
You wouldn't trust a janitor to perform heart surgery would you? No you wouldn't because a Janitor would have no idea what the fuck he should be doing.
---
Much like you wouldn't ask anyone below high plat/Diamond to balance a game, because they have no idea what they're doing. 
---
The experienced players understand the game better than everyone else... Their opinion has way more weight than anyone elses.
---
That's a nice clean fireplace/ tv setup. I like the color scheme 
---
Did you miss the /s? Are you the idiot?
---
Im not the only one thinking this, also probably the reason youre getting this number of upvotes, in comparison with, lets say, SAU-SIEGE. Because his comics are actually funny.
---
Patience, it probably has to update the statistics which in ubis case can taken time.
---
also we were supposed to do a casual but never ended up doing it i deleted them all after
---
Took a similarly long break due to the m&amp;k fag plague on console. Came back and it was worse than ever. Sadly uninstalled. I’ll miss it. 
---
It took us 3 days to make to potato salad buddy.

**3 D A Y S**
---
Thank you for the comment however I didnt seem relevant - not hating or dislike just saying thank you!
---
Yeah I thought about two and that can be re-used but it has to be easily destroyed with like an impact grenade to make it weak vs operator that roams with impacts, the synergy with Hibana would be total I think, probably a 2/2 and the deployment time is cool too, need to think of the rest 
---
Thanks
---
I personally think it wouldn't do much. I have never seen anyone place nitro cells and watch them to try and get a kill, only people throwing them and detonating them straight away.
---
The game has a hard enough time keeping up with 3 speeds. It definitely won't handle 4 speeds.
---
Barbed wire is also a nice easy one.
---
There is ways to detect it though. WASD movements are very different compared to analog stick movements. What doesn’t make sense is Ubi says it’s not bannable, but Ubi is the one that made it so you can’t just plug your MnK in and play, you need the adapter. They’re basically saying it’s OK to break their rules.
---
when you dont take your plates
---
My man did you not see that frost to your right at the start of the clip
---
You don't need to be lesbian to admire a piece of ass
---
also we where supposed to do a custom game but never ended up doing it
---
Wow something posted on insta before reddit
---
guys cmon you’re both idiots for missing jokes now kiss 
---
No u
---
You dont want to hear this but move slower or a different way then
---
Question is, were they thinking?
---
There is one. Idk what it’s called tho. And it’s not Ubisoft made. MrHomeless did a vid on it awhile ago
---
Well sony accepts it so ubi has no more say you should talk about it on r/ps4
---
I'm starting to think the window is what causes it to stay into place instead of going outward
---
Same reason they add an entirely different red dot for ela and zofias pistols, clashes smg, maestros revolver. It just adds a touch of personality to the Russian operators. I think nomad has her own sight too right? 
---
OOF
---
I don’t see it as a huge game changer but it could be a fun addition to the game.
---
You know there's more to maestro than his gadget, right? And Echo's two counters are the least picked attackers that both have to get pretty close and lucky to defeat his drones.
---
Its pointless to crouch this fast, you will spam into a headshot
---
The recoil of the smg 12 and the rate of fire of the dmr
---
Don't be a toxic douche and you won't have to worry about it.
---
Its acc lucky af
---
I remember that, I miss it!
---
I'm confuze
---
a good gun doesn't mean he's overpowered.
---
Enable steam overlay in the settings. 
---
Oot
---
Also debrises shouldn't be client sided. I see people running through a barricade or shooting through a full barricade.
---
 Vertical and Flash, if you want the best choice in terms of a recoil
---
How
---
Silently correcting your grammar 
---
my uncle looks like pulse too 
---
If you get revenge then get banned. If it's ranked let them kill you so they get banned or leave the game. It's pretty fucking ez 2 not git banned
---
And my day is ruined
---
Yo that's so cool wtf 
---
This is the same problem I have. The thing you need to understand is that as far as gameplay is concerned, Casual and Ranked are in different video games.
---
The amount of team cohesion and communication required to be consistent in Ranked is unthinkable in Casual. Also Casual is a shooting range, but gunskills are secondary in ranked
---
Try working on operator synergy with your team and communication with either strangers or the people you play with.
---
This got me good
---
C28A1 mounted and loaded.
---
I had the same issue with this and the Divison discord. I got better teammates that actually communicated from solo queuing more often.
---
What’s with the red balloon in the top right hand corner
---
Join during pick phase
---
whats wrong with all these backgrounds lmao.
---
I know its not a huge deal but wtf :D
---
Nah id rather get banned than not play becuase of team killers, im just asking how long it'll take until i get ban cooldowned
---
Your father looks like 'Johnny Sins'.
---
It’s not thousands, only hundreds 
---
Tom and Jerry
---
Firing rate shouldn't be an issue with the DMR - try to stop spamming it and really be careful about your shots.
---
The SMG-12 is a shotgun unless you're bursting heavily. Try to only use it in close quarters. You're probably better off with the CZ in either case. The SMG-12 has been pretty unpredictable since the nerf
---
Although women are funny 
---
But at the same time it makes it less special since everyone will be using it
---
well i suggest not to use the other secondary and just pull down on your mouse and hope for the best. the dmr is better than the shotgun, the rate of fire of it is slow, but there is hardly any recoil. it’s pretty satisfying to get kills with.

Weird, i normally use twitch/thatcher, i got all 15 in one match as twitch (some really awesome enemies, placed all gadgets down for me)
---
Thats also true
---
I joined mid pick and it automatically gave me recruit even though you wouldn’t be able to pick him normally in the SI mode
---
It's already enabled, but it still won't open with shift tab. It never has opened for me before.  I think uplay would just open it in it's own browser and thats how I was able to buy stuff before.
---
Lmao
---
Big Tachungus don’t @me
---
Thanks 👍
---
Im level 51, im bronze (i think) becuase i havent played ranked in a while and i mostly play on xbox
---
Valkyrie is a support player. Her utility and gadgets (if used properly) are HUGE for a team with good cohesion. Ela's gun is very very good in close quarters and her gadget great for op hunting.
---
Think of Valk as discount Echo, and Ela as high-recoil jager
---
 &lt;3
---
Aye this games physics are weird siege does what siege wants 🤣
---
Ok get perma banned and never play again. And it doesn't go back down for months. It think it's like 6 months with no bans for it to go from 7 days to 3 day bans. Honestly it's not hard to not get banned in the game and I play everyday. If you're at a 7 day ban then you're probably doing some toxic shit and need to not play the game anyway.
