Vigil forgot to turn his ability on before you took the picture. Unlucky

Both. First fist downs them. The second will make them wish they were being interrogated instead

This is definitely the most likely. I‚Äôve had to vote new people out quite a bit recently because everyone was having to wait an absurd amount of time.

This one goes out to all the drones lost due to the cut off.
---
It really doesn't matter, it's a video game.
---
He would have died if not for the Doc lol(Look at Cavs health when Doc stimmed her)
---
Favorite was velvet shell. It really changed up the meta of the time and was a really good edition. 
---
Least is either this one or chimera. This one was super buggy and rough but chimera gave us lion and finka which was bad too.
---
Almost like a character who can two shot you and go completely silent. Oh wait she already exists
---
It literally couldn‚Äôt matter more.
---
Mr maverick I don‚Äôt feel so good
---
‚ÄúInterrogated‚Äù. Oh they will be
---
Yup
---
Jackal for sure
---
As a Dev it should be copy pasting a method and just changing variables for recoil, damage, dropoff, ECT. Animators have the hardest job with new weapons.
---
They are incredible! Thanks heaps for sharing! :)
---
You can't always control that. Plenty of random drones have been lost to this due to roamers.
---
Fuze has earned this right, with his flawless cluster charges every stinkin time. 
---
Seriously tho, do you know anyone that could help? I'm being dead serious about getting fuze into a french girl pose.
---
Then you have issues, she's in the game and is staying that way, sucks to be you.
---
I‚Äôm so mad all the time!
---
whatever season they fixed the lighting, and operation health both best and worst, because we missed out on a season, but they also fixed a lot of shit.
---
People being toxic to you doesn‚Äôt mean you doing it back isn‚Äôt also toxic.
---
Yeah I know you're serious and no I'm not going to help you. Even if I knew how. Which I do
---
I dislike it's going to bomb only, but I love the rest of the changes, and omg them charms look amazing 
---
I think we either need to go to 
---
Competitive mode (full PL rules, bomb only, 7seconds defuse timer, map pool, 3round side changes) and also then ranked which is just current ranked with pick ban and all modes controlled by matchmaking preferences 
---
Or have ranked bomb, secure area and hostage as separate ranked playlists
---
The background and colors need more **details,** however.

As impressive as this is, I oddly lost my shit as the random recruit just came jumping into view.
---
Its the little things that amuse me the most.
---
No. She has the body of a strong-man. She has no flab. It‚Äôs pure muscle
---
Mhm. Ok.
---
I don‚Äôt know if I missed a post you made earlier but I am interested and would love for you to explain the operators to me!
---
I was gonna say Grim sky was my least favorite season cause of its rocky start, but I do think that this current season is definitely down there, easily worse than Grim sky. My favorite is Para Bellum
---
Tbh. You can‚Äôt go wrong with any of them. Buck is so satisfying to play as though.
---
How can you say this season when the second set of operators haven‚Äôt even come out yet
---
That was cav. I told everyone in the game I was going to post it on reddit.
---
Except Lesion's Elite is supposed to be CBRN design....so after he joined team Rainbow they made the Elite suit for him.
---
It isn't from his past, it is the uniform of his present and future missions etc.
---
The problem with giving her the SAME weapon as smoke is that ubisoft now can't balance the weapon independently of the operators. If they make the fmg better to help smoke it will now inadvertently buff Nokk too, they should just make a similar weapon for this reason alone.
---
‚ÄúWow dude sorry I walked behind you‚Äù
---
[removed]
---
I really think they should reduce the ammo counts for some of the guns so you actually have a chance of running out of ammo.
---
I have a document that contains all their info. If you'd like I can send it your way!
---
Hey you should add me on xbox for evolve/Siege. Gt - Wish 4 Demise
---
if it doesnt affect her performance it doesnt matter. its not like the australian unit has the most strict rules either (mozzie has adhd and rides a fucking motorcycle)
---
don't they usually come out at like 9am est
---
Down to play on xbox one.
---
I like how the smoke in the back is almost the same as on the nokk/warden art work.
---
Facts
---
These are snacks, she will not shoot those, she will eat them.
---
 I agree. I personally would love to see WW2 reference. Like some sort of guerilla soldier during sino-japanese war. Thus the elite would look more mature...
---
And even if they wanted to make futuristic skin so badly, they could have used more of the black patterns, similar to Crysis outfit.
---
So you just split them up, and let them all have separate mmr, other games manage it perfectly fine. 
---
There is plenty of ways they could keep all modes in a ranked environment
---
That's probably going to come.
---
Having to hide your drones before the prep phase ends is not that hard to do. If your drone got caught after the phase ended then thats poor drone management/placement on your part. 
---
We don't need them to make the game easier. People just need to get better. That way it'll be more rewarding of a game to play instead of dumbing it down so people can feel good about themlselves
---

Kinda want to grab it
---
I want Elite for Ying so badly
---
Then that would be the fault of the player leaving, they could‚Äôve been saved and maybe Caveira wasn‚Äôt going to interrogate, but they decide to leave anyway just to make it so there‚Äôs absolutely no chance they will be interrogated. It‚Äôs a punishment for leaving as well.
---
Why couldn't they just give us the text? Their website is sluggish to navigate and the details are spread around overblown graphics that while nice, just impede going through the notes.
---
Nook is very much not for new players. She‚Äôs gonna he used for lots of intel and will need to relay it to your Team. 
---
Sledge is good for starters.
---
I don‚Äôt like it
---
I wanted north Hollywood shootout S.W.A.T elite for him. It would make sense for his character since he worked in L.A
---
And it was a headshot. If I aimed higher cav would have died.
---
Rook and doc are both pretty easy to master and are both chunky mofo's
---
552 is far better
---
&gt; hereford
---
We don't want that shit either mate.
---
Ubisoft:
---
Clash shoots through shield; IQ invisible?... I sleep
---
Sledge can‚Äôt vandalize cars... REAL SHIT???
---
Bones is one of the best headgears in the game. What are you talking about?
---
cheers
---
Well, shouldn‚Äôt of they given a callout that they were being interrogated?
---
If you love ‚Äùtank roles‚Äù I would suggest an anchor for you. These are usually Rook, Doc, Lesion, Clash, Echo, etc. If you like a tank role these chunky guys are used to sit on an objective and watch the entrances to the rooms; these are what you will want if you are new. They allow you to learn recoil patterns and learn how scopes work; plus it teaches you the difference between Passive and Active Gadgets.
---
If you also want to learn maps I would suggest Terrorist Hunt and just playing casual and pay attention to everything. 
---
Hope this helps
---
-Stxrm (A Dokkaebi/Lesion Main)
---
Like 90 percent of the community is quite happy with RFF, its only very certain people who aren't happy
---
Well if we take a look back at gaming history and even recent history, developers want to make it easier for new players to fit in and not get discouraged. That's as why they made the newcomer mode even though it is swamped with Smurfs RN. So it would be in the best interest to continue a smooth transition from drone phase to attack phase instead dog an abrupt halt. It comes off unpolished. Sorta like Blackbeard's reload animation. It just doesn't reload it feels really weird. 
---
If you encourage drones to continue to be cut off at the end of the phase then do you also encourage all automatic reloading to not be a thing as well?
---
Definitely keep the skull. I think an attacking smoke would be cool. But the problem is, Capitao. You‚Äôd have to make it a little more original and creative (keep the gas launcher). I suggest maybe something of a nomad like trap that detonates on proxy.
---
Yes, in an ideal world :(
---
Why does it seem so excessive..
---
And the people punished are the remaining attackers in the game, not the person who left.  That's my issue with it.  If it was a five stack that's okay, but it won't always be a five stack thus there will be some randoms punished unfairly because of a person who has no attachment to them whatsoever.
---
I do have a solution to this problem that doesn't come with it the collateral of auto-interrogations that I posted on another comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/br3oku/here_comes_that_opinion_again/eo9uf3q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

&gt;even reply to this because you won't be able to handle your weirdass theory being debunked
---
Hi. I'm not you, so I'll reply as long as I'm free to do so.
---
&gt;e: oh holy shit you actually made a post on the PL sub and still got told you were wrong ahahahahaha
---
I needed proof for you kids here that refuse to believe what is broken is broken.
---
I doubt you have read the replies, so let me TL;DR;"tooStupid" it for you. He isn't as influential in the current meta as he was in Chimera and PB. The current meta revolved around a lot of anti-intel, where BB isn't finding the best place. Doesn't change they tact that he still violates the most fundamental rule of siege and is broken. One dude even replied saying "I don't want him buffed. Keep him dead". Not sure about you, but r6pl sub has a lot more legitimate IQ people than over here. The quality of tmreplies were also better than the ones here that simply say hIs ShIeLd bReAkS LuL.
---
Everybody knows he's broken, and those who don't love their false sense of protection. In case you haven't noticed, even on the PL sub post, we already proved that.
---
As a former Bandit main, I‚Äôm not a Lesion main.
---
considering he barely touches it that's not really an issue.
---
I will never forget that moment my teammate called her octopus lady
---
On the bright side, they had some really nice music in that season though.
---
Yeah I definetly will have to look into it. All feedback is great!

Two armor vs Warden in a suit 3 armor haha.

It doesn‚Äôt even show up in my DLC!i have the PayPal records showing I did fucking pay lol and it‚Äôs not showing up in the store anymore either!
---
That's still massive confirmation bias. In situations where a dead body could fuck up the shot (meaning any shot taken at floor level or over a windowsill/table/object a body could fall on), far far more shots don't wind up blocked than do.
---
lol you can't buy it again even if you tried on steam. you already own it..
---
Shit every time if they spot my drone before I can hide it or can't get away from them.

No such thing

---
I don‚Äôt think they would let her out of the cage without fixing the glitch, same with claymores and deployable shields, but they‚Äôve said that they will address it tomorrow
---
The cam denial thing is already out with N√∏kk, and I don‚Äôt think we should add an operator that denies Mira because it‚Äôs just not realistic. Think about it, your literally making yourself invisible to a window. The only way to do that is to *be invisible*. I would love to have an operator that would be ‚Äúimmune‚Äù from traps for 5 seconds, say twice a round? It would be hard to balance but is realistic.
---
im not saying shes definitely their sister, im just theorizing. they also said that if you look through the lore enough its easy to see who nokk is

OP asked how to relieve some stress

It‚Äôs cross acron
---
banana
---
Correct me if im wrong, but i think that resembles zoobles more than bakugan.
---
Thank you bot, I know but everyone there already knows how to do this, this is for the people who dont usually use the tts
---
I personally don‚Äôt think warthunder will relieve stress. It‚Äôs just a boring game for me. I used to like simulators, but I‚Äôd rather just play Minecraft because it‚Äôs more relaxing.
---
Indeed f
---
This is why the siege community isn‚Äôt taken seriously. It‚Äôs also why I don‚Äôt 1v1.
---
I think Lore is enough payoff by itself
---
Nice play :)
---
It's different from person to person. I like to keep it competitive, but in something I know I have an advantage in.
---
Is the FW-190 line on the same tier? Or is it after the 109‚Äôs?
---
tachanka is a hard one to rework because his operator is based around cementing himself implace and holding obj/angles in a game that thrives off of moving around and staying hiden

What is your comment? Are you being...wholesome?! Get out. This is not allowed on reddit. /s

Thanks for the help! Do u know (or anyone) when the new season will come out on the TTS?
---
Operation should release on June 11th so that should be when pass holders will gain access.
---
I‚Äôve done that, it just says a week before everyone else. I was wondering if they‚Äôve announced a date
---
Turn that frown upside down
---
No one knows. They didn't give a release date. Just be patient.
---
Psychological warfare.

dead meme
---
Why wouldn't they get the operators they paid money for??
---
One of the major points of buying a Year pass is to get that years operators.
---
Oh okay, yeah I think you should because I know while the Clancy universe borrows from reality that there are definitely differences and its own "history". Example, during the reveal the announcer said Warden worked for "President Baldwin" who I do not know if they exist in other Clancy references or not or if this is new and only siege. I agree that something about the Zofia Ela theory feels off, so I am excited for the release so I can read through everything more carefully to see. From what I've read so far though, there is a lot of reference to family which Zofia and Ela's stuff says that a lot but idk.
---
I am an idiot sorry for existing

You mean less mmr gain and loss?

Just the kill feed thing

I'm not much of a skin guy so I don't buy any skins. However, Sledge, Kapkan, J√§ger and Valkyrie are all quite nice. Not sure what I think about Lesion till I see him in game.
---
Well in the profile it says it's a toothpick. Although it also says he was influenced by MarkÂì•, a character who loves to have a match in his mouth. So...either way?
---
I kinda wish that one of her secondary guns was the C75 auto or the bearing 9, But it's too late for ubi to change her secondary weapons.
---
Yeah like someone said, She is danish. If she said her name correctly (obv she would) it wouldn‚Äôt be Knock of Nokk its N√∏kk, its hard to explain the sound but its more like Nokk but the o sounds like an american ugh (just the u tho) so Nu(gh)kk idk if that makes sense? Basically take the u from  ugh and say that instead of o.
---
No it saves through ubisoft
---
the question is, do you know what it means?
---
Distance is why, it‚Äôs much safer to use the pellets from an angle and off a distance then to have thermite run up to the door that‚Äôs probably inside the map and risk being exposed. Also hibana can take out all three castles from a safe distance vs thermite who you‚Äôd rather blow A REALLY BIG HOLE IN THE WALL.
---
Nokk is like vigil's crazy ex-gf that hates that he is with Cav.
---
Unplayable!
---
Where are you finding these?
---
Took vigil Crtl C goes to attackers Crtl V N√∏kk is born
---
Mate I was gold two and got queued with 2 diamonds, a plat and 2 coppers.
---
If eagle eye is an attacker maybe he/she could have a drone like echos that can jump on ceilings and instead of concussion the drone can spot enemies like jackal and it tracks their movements 3 times.
---
lmao you‚Äôre awful, we wouldn‚Äôt even be in the same game together. you‚Äôre really self conscious about ya age aren‚Äôt ya pal? every comment you leave is calling people children
---
Or maybe they are taking queues from what the community thinks are cool and interesting ideas
---
I am here as fifth confirmation and i cofirm all those informations!

We need an option to drone ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Made with mematic
---
Yea i think it may actually be a bakugan. My bad
---
Ash has the speed and utility to blind a clash and run up and take her out not to mention her breach charges do some damage if aimed correctly. As for the buck, sledge and finka all it would take is a good cooked grenade getting passed her shield to take her down. At least that‚Äôs how I interpret it as.
---
I wasn‚Äôt blaming us losing on the ranks. I just found it funny that their team and our team had such a whacky range of ranks
---
well that just seems kinda pointless
---
I wanna der more Germans because everyone of the original CTU‚Äòs has more than four now except the Germans. Some options would be the SEK,ZUZ or KSK.
---
You were 100% carried.
---
I have similar stats to yours and placed Bronze 1 in these last two seasons.
---
I have also placed Gold 1 and Silver 2 in prior seasons because - carried by randos that the game matchmade me with.
---
And dude, if you think that you will dominate in Bronze or copper, hahaha. Stay in Silver or Gold. That is where the decent players are. Bronze and Copper are full of Plat derankers who will condemn you to Copper IV before you know what is happening.
---
It would still be a cool touch though
---
It says right there on the image that it‚Äôs up to para bellum
---
Well I mean I‚Äôd say pick and ban is way more of a pro league feature than just taking out unbalanced maps
---
This should've been an elite skin for the aprils fool event we just got tbh
---
That red charm... looks so good.
---
Well tarkov you could speed reload a full mag and have him grab it off the geound.
---
Can you access them through your phone?
---
It was an effect that put one team at a disadvantage. Seeing attackers from there was near impossible due to the water, and the sound of the sprinkles made it too hard to hear enemy actions, such as the hatch being opened up by a Hibana.
---
lmao poor guy
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just gonna get annoying because 20 other people will flood the feed with this stuff :)
---
Thetcher can basically be used every round. He counters heaps of the defence. Hes most commonly used to take out badit batteries or mute jammers but can be used to counter Jager, maestros, echo, pulse. He is actually one of the most versatile ops on the game.
---
Ha go tell the devs
---
i play on both and the skill gap between pc and console is there, when you spawn peek on console everyone justs gets scared and doesnt do anything, downvote me if you want, that still doesnt change anything console peasants
---
Clearly a boosted scumbag
---
Don't get what that has to do with elite skin. He's already in the SDU. That's his CTU.
---
Australian APAC caster. Don't know his name.
---
F
---
Btw are the for everyone or only for Y4 pass holders?
---
Well i mean for me that 90% of the time i tried him that there was barely any tech defense.
---
Console plebs.. just sayin
---
Actually, in Mandarin, to skip out on a meeting/date etc. is called "to let go of a pigeon"ÊîæÈ¥øÂ≠ê. However this is weird to put in a Hong Kong operator since in Cantonese it is called "to let go of a plane"ÊîæÈ£õÊ©ü.
---
Badass
---
What American does Warden balance out with?
---
It‚Äôs a good idea but sorta bad till they fix the spawn peeking problem on some maps. Example: if you spawn TeaCups in Theme Park and some one runs out of Drug Storage they can 1 Tap you if you‚Äôre standing still and even if you move and they don‚Äôt ü•î then that‚Äôs at least 20 health gone.
---
Over all though good idea.
---
That happened to me in ranked it was fun
---
Ridiculous. My team always calls it. Going 3-0 then boooooom
---
lol i dont understand why console peasants get so triggered when they console sucks. its literally a fact

wtf

Momentum also works the other way round, people get cocky, people think they can get away with making mistakes. It hurts more in this format because you have never seen the other side attack/defend, and if you get too carried away you can easily lose rounds. You lose 2 rounds and then momentum is with the losing side. Going 3-0 down is the old format, was worse for a team which is losing.
---
Both formats have different advantages and disadvantages, psychologically. But saying, it's unfair/unbalanced is just dumb because both teams are on equal grounds.
---
Why not just have a "Ranked Bomb" and a "Ranked Secure" playlist?
---
I was just about to play Clash because I liked the playstyle then she got removed.
---
I learnt this by playing my favourite attacker, Polish Sister Lady, however when I went to place my claymore, I was unpleasantly surprised then went to the subreddit to see if this was a new bug.
---
Oh well. I just wanted to zap people...
---
Thank you.
---
Oh.
---
Ok. Knowledge gained. Thanks.
---
I did not ask for reasons to diminish the removal of secure area, rather opening a discussion for those who are in the same boat as Rogue9 and iceycat who are as oblivious as to why they can not create an equal playing field for everyone rather than pushing everyone to play one mode. This change wont effect bomb only players, and so any negitive points that were made - highlights the bias of bomb only players. :)

I feel like the solution is to have bomb only from gold 1 and above so people who play at high skill levels are playing the most balanced mode but low skill levels it is less important to what mode as people play less meta

thanks ;)

Good point and I agree

Lmao, you have been on Reddit for 7 months, have 1 Karma, 1 comment, and you came to the most random comment on a terribly shit post, and you somehow you chose to respond to me. So that means that you're either OP's alt account, or you're his friend. Either case is equally pathetic.
---
He's disgusted.

You right you right
---
Imagine Nokk having the C7, that shit fucking scary
---
*Why you bully me?*
---
Im a bomb player and I wouldn‚Äôt mind secure sill being in the ranked playlist. However, it‚Äôll stop me from getting out into Secure games when I join a friend who hasn‚Äôt got Bomb only on. Also, I agree that some secure games are intense, but it all comes down to a couple things in Secure that don‚Äôt exist in Bomb:
---
1. Just open the wall.
---
2. Just hide in objective while it‚Äôs contested then jump out on the opponent to win.
---
3. If you know down an attacker and you‚Äôre both contesting objective in a 1v1, start teabagging and leave objective until the last second before they secure it then kill the downed player.
---
It sucks that they‚Äôve removed Secure but to be honest, it‚Äôs a perfectly understandable reason. The whole game is designed about being competitive and tactical. For the most part, Secure lacks both tactics and competitiveness. The moments are not anywhere near as intense as Bomb and not to mention that the maps themselves are all based around Bomb and not another gamemode. Look at Hostage for example. The hostage and extraction point are 5 seconds away from each other for the most part. Not to mention tactics, which is something you have to have in Bomb. You have to have coordination and good synergy as a team to be able to effectively push and whittle down the opponents when playing Bomb. You have to adapt your playstyle and choose more operators in order to have a more versatile team. In Secure, one person can rush objective and stay in there until the rest of the attacking team will come. All you essentially need in Secure is Hibana/Thermite and Thatcher/Twitch and you can win the game. 
---
To counter your last point, then removing Bomb and Secure are two completely different things. I feel like I‚Äôve typed enough though so I don‚Äôt want to go into that rn lmao. 
---
All in all, it sucks and I empathise with Secure players (I don‚Äôt mind Hostage being out of Ranked) but from a gameplay standpoint, it makes perfect sense as to why they removed it.
---
Is that just the percentage of people who have completed article 5?
---
I always hated guys shooting at the very beginning of the round until... I did a full spree by myself by just picking up the controller ;-;
---

---
This is what I get for sorting by new lol
---
I‚Äôm a clash main and I understand why people hate her. Sorry
---
Because they shouldn‚Äôt have made her have intense recoil at least do what they did to cav nerf the damage at a further range. They nerf every weapon with recoil.
---
However, the spine of this game is competing gameplay and tactics. I don‚Äôt disagree with you but wanting to play the game competitively, by this I mean an intense game, you simply cannot be playing Secure.
---
No because even the 2 secondary SMG's made her powerful it was a last minute decision and they quickly changed it, both Year 4: Season 3 operators will only have 1 new weapon
---
Depends if you love pineapple on your pizza.
---
Same happened to me,but the the speed will come after you get more muscle memory for aiming and get more confident. Believe me. I used to watch shroud when he played r6 and tried to copy what he did, big mistake. Think about hours that the pro players/streamers have put into this game. If pengu has played close to 10000 hours versus my 600 then i dont see a reason why should i be even as good as he is now.
---
Very sad :c
---
yeah this is hell
---
Stop sucking
---
I‚Äôm a huge fan of Pro League, which has caused me to play only bomb so I may be a little biased in this discussion 
---
I find bomb a lot more competitive as it places more of an emphasis on map control. In a hostage/secure game the Defense fortifies one room, making roaming more difficult and anchoring very different. 
---
Bomb appeals to me more due to the added layer of strategy (who takes defuser, where to plant, calling for teammates to hold dangerous angles whilst plant is going down. Also makes a game feel a little slower and more methodical, rather than drone site, jump in, grab hostage and run for the hills 
---
In a perfect world for me, there would be a competitive playlist, which mirrors pro league rule sets in every way (except maybe round counts), regular ranked become a mix between bomb and secure, and hostage should only be in Casual, if at all
---
Indeed

His quote for the beginning of the round would be: All aboard the Polar Express!
---
That's not a sniper rifle, it's the SIX12 SD with a red dot sight which she has.

And his ability should be collecting tickets
---
that‚Äôs the best feeling.
---
Nah maestro becomes attacker like sledge but he just runs around kicking his teammates through walls and can kill defenders by doing it against a reinforced wall
---
If favela and skyscraper had a child.
---
There is no such thing as an "noncompetitive" game mode in a game where you switch sides. Every team has an equal opportunity at attack or defense and it all comes down to strategy and skill to see who wins. How is that not balanced or competitive? CS:GO doesnt remove maps or game modes just because one team is slightly favored to win a round. Switching sides exists for a reason.
---
I'm not a hater of bomb, I like more strategic gmemodes but I never have a 5 stack, which means I have to rely on rando which is harder to do in bomb than secure
---
What happened to her
---
A lot of these DLC ops don‚Äôt even have videos like that. 
---
A good chunk of them were revealed in tailored gameplay footage during a Rainbow Six event and had narration over top of them.
---
what in the?
---
Perhaps we should have less Ammo in siege and add the mechanic. It's pathetic how much more ammo rifles have compared to shotguns.
---
Just reset the queue. At that point you‚Äôre just wasting your own time
---
i will add you when i am back home, but i think you're in :D
---
Damn right. Took me and my friend no more than 5 minutes to realize how this new system could be exploited even worse than the old one.
---
Essentially, if you bully someone into killing you, or they do so accidentally, you're given a near-limitless pass to deal partial damage to them for the rest of the game.
---
I know there's a cap, but it's too high to really matter.
---
This system is still in dire need of tweaking.
---
I also love bomb, but if people wanted bomb only there was a setting for it, there is no reason to strip that right away from people who wanted it
---
Not once did I say that console was just as good, however it‚Äôs an apples to oranges comparison. I‚Äôm stating that the pc side seems to think copper to platinum is basically the same level of retardation.
---
Yay! Gold 4 rn btw

Whilst I agree with that suggestion, I have already restarted the queue 4 times previously and each time went up to 8 minutes.

This isn't an uncommon occurrence in this game and is probably one of the most problematic things with this game.

I heard it's Twitch and Cav (never played Ghost Recon) but is it Cav and Valk or Twitch and Valk in that case

Rainbow Six is a big franchise, 1998 is when it was initially released

It‚Äôs not advice. It‚Äôs a heads up ;)

Or when he says that while your the last OP and you have C4
---
That isn't fair to say "Just play casual" casual has maps like favela, so I think it's not fair people have to risk bad maps, or diamonds and plats in their game, to be able to play a game mode they want. In plus, you could choose to disable secure for ranked so the only thing your doing is restricting the players that did like ranked secure, and your reason? It should be as competitive as possible. What? You had the option to play bomb only before. So your saying that just because you have the option, you want everyone to live by that option? I just don't understand.
---
many games have this feature, lol.
---
Unfortunately there's literally nothing you can do. Same with people exploiting glitches and hitting servers. Just part of the console siege experience.
---
&gt; Not nearly as much as the demand for pick and ban and the other changes mind you.
---
True
---
&gt; Those people already play ranked bomb-only with other modes turned off
---
Holy fucking hell how many times does this need to be said? That is not how that button works. You are only guaranteed to get a Bomb match, if ALL 9 OTHER players have set their preference to Bomb-only. If you are the only one with Bomb-only preference in the lobby, you can still get a Secure or Hostage match.

I actually made an operator idea for a completion, where my design was an operator with this kinda foam. I can find my suggestion, where I believe I explain why the foam can block bullets

Out of 23 ops 9 are under 10%, half are severely underpicked.
---
And find me, out of 25 ops, 5 (not half, just 5) ops where the default/meta/best weapon is a LMG/Shotty/DMR when they have also a AR/SMG (counting also secondary SMG) and you'll be right.

Until then LMG, shotguns, DMR and pistols are objectively worse than assault rifles or SMGs.

You literally contradicted yourself. To avoid Hostage, you had to ask your mates to turn it off, which means you could have got it if they didn't have it turned off.

Casual was *designed* to be aimed towards more casual players. Today it's:
---
- A place for lvl 250+ player 5 man squads to shit on new players and players wanting just a casual match.
---
- A place where high ranked players shows off how incredibly good they are at this game, teamkilling and voting to kick anyone who isn't as good as them.
---
- A place where the top leveled players in a team would leave the game, whenever their team suffers a single loss, and where other teammates follow and quits as well, leaving just 1 or 2 players to battle it out against a relatively well coordinated team of 5 after just one round into the match.
---
- A place where people get a few giggles from just voting to kick anyone, even the last dude standing in a 1v1.
---
- A place where people with mics shittalk anyone who makes a mistake, telling them exactly how bad they are at this game and that they should just die already.

So... instead of bitching about Ranked becoming what it should have always been, you could... idk... bitch about Casual being shit, so Ubisoft could make it better.
---
Yes, according to Ubi. But nothing further can be done. Ubi has disabled default kb&amp;m support since the begining, but they cannot stop people using adaptor.
---
Actually removing the hit indicator or making it so only every other shot has one might bring it up to par with the other barrels.
---
she's a pro apex player
---
Ranked is hit or miss. If you're doing your placements then you're going to get really bad teammates. If you happen to be placed in gold then it'll really be luck of the draw for good teammates because Gold rank unfortunately is filled with carried golds that have no idea how to play or smurfs who only play for fun rather than to win.
---
The issue with hostage is that even when it does show up every few months in ranked it never plays like intended. 
---
Hostage is just TDM with a ‚Äúno frag room‚Äù clause and a human meat shield
---
I know this isn't related to the shooting (also live in Vegas), but man, I remember way back when R6 Vegas came up. IIRC, there was some controversy bc Vegas was still high up on AQAB's list, and our mayor basically came out and said the game's setting was fine so long as the locations/casinos/layouts were fictitious. I like those games a lot, but it's funny to see the Calypso across the way from the Paris and a stone's throw from the Bellagio
---
&gt;If you know down an attacker and you‚Äôre both contesting objective in a 1v1, start teabagging and leave objective until the last second before they secure it then kill the downed player.

I never understood why people who take video games like esports can‚Äôt let casual players just enjoy the game. If you wanna take the game seriously, go ahead. Nobody is stoping you. But don‚Äôt force it that way upon players who just wanna play the game and have fun.
---
The edit is sublime
---
Of course someone made that chart
---
ok first of all don't assume or put words in people's mouths like ever. that's just bad debate practice. second of all ranked has bad maps in it already so there's not much a difference between it and casual in terms of map balance.
---
Just confused, that's all.
---
‚ÄúThey said it could not be done...‚Äù
---
Nope you just can't fkn read. 
---
I played solo for more than 700 hours with hostage off and I never got a hostage game unless MY SQUAD had it on. You are stating that the people in YOUR LOBBY not YOUR SQUAD might affect the mode you're in and that's just not true. It's YOUR SQUAD, aka YOUR FRIENDS that might land you a secure game if you have it off, not anyone in YOUR LOBBY. 
---
So by any means if you queue alone or with people that agree with you, you're never at risk of getting in a mode you don't want to. 
---
But yet you think this change affects you, flawless reasoning.
---
I remember seeing this months ago
---
honestly, it will never stop, one of the devs talked about it last major to quote him, "it is literally a cat &amp; mouse game. Every time we patch out a method \[of KB/M on console\], 30 minutes later there will be a patch for that program and it will work again." GetFlanked also did a video addressing this very issue, he says that it's out of ubi's hands and the console manufacturers (Sony &amp; Microsoft) have all the decision making power. My best advice to you right now is to just get a PC. Otherwise, if you're worried about losing your friends just accept that there will always be KB/M players on console and just have the best fun you can.
---
That's an exception, Because once the player hits level 50, it's gone.

I never really played PC properly until 2 or 3 month ago for Siege. Within a week or so I could snap headshot like it was nothing. Mouse is easy part (after I spent an hour researching sensitivity settings on YouTube).
---
The hard part for me was the movement on buttons rather than stick.
---
Also take the time to customise mouse buttons etc for gadgets where its easiest to reach and should be fine within a few weeks.
---
can we stop with these posts already? are you all new to siege or what?
---
Many yes
---
Maybe that‚Äôs exactly why they are doing it. Things like the FMG are good but never see play. Give it a chance.
---
The game is only balanced for bomb not the other modes. That is why they did it. It is as simple as that.
---
The deployables he puts down are laser turrets. The gimmick is that they are impervious to guns unless the operator of the turret opens the front glass to shoot.
---
Rather than use them as laser turrets, our boi here uses them as bulletproof cover to protect his instakill headshot hitbox while lining up easy kills on the unsuspecting enemies.

R6 has great mechanics, but it also has a lot it could learn from other games. Counter strike has existed for years and they've got a lot of their shit together. You say R6 games are pioneers but where is the replay system? The community servers? They should definitely follow csgo in that respect. No point in being different for different sake
---
Thanks pal
---
So matching 20 million instead of 60 million is going to make a difference? 
---
Sure if you only have a couple hundred concurrent players, splitting the player base is a issue. But siege is huge now. The are no matching time issues any more. 
---
At least bit that we see here, North American and pc
---
I got all of them. I'm happy
---
This will help Solo-Q a lot. Now you will get people in your games who (for the most part) are their actual rank in bomb. Also it helps the community understand balancing/operator decisions when its centered around one game mode that everyone plays. I would be pissed if I was a secure player as well but I'm telling you....try bomb and you will love it.
---
I'll support this! One viable site isn't enough for a map to be in ranked. A map isn't fun if it's 99% solely decided by who gets to attack twice in OT.
---
Oh, and keybinds are all your choice, as long as you can hit the things you need to press without fatfingering something else, ex. (V is melee by default, and can cause problems with G, for grenades and gadgets. I personally use one of the side buttons on my mouse for melee.

By design you mean the net on her head? That is not really exclusive to the Danish Frogman, as you can see pictures about the Jaegerkorpset wearing the same net.
---
They wanted to give an AR to Nokk but it was too powerful, hence the FMG.
---
Laziness or not, his answer makes a perfect sense to be honest. We have seen Ubi's laziness as you have mentioned but I just dont see why the lack of weapons is such a huge issue.
---
Yeah I prefer PC players as, hackers aside, most are normal adult people whereas console has too many kids and immature man children.
---
Teamkilling never really happens on PC, it is frowned upon since the community there have standards which I appreciate. 
---
I jump back to PS4 and miss my shots cos its a controller (getting used to controller movement again) and then I'll get TKed for it or some other such nonsense.

Not much can be done about irresponsible parents letting Fortnite dickhead Timmy play Siege.....I find a lot of it chalks up to parents that should not be allowed have kids since they let them play whatever they like with no boundaries or common sense values.

This has happened to me before. Definitely a glitch. Once you leave the game and come back it‚Äôll be back so take advantage of them.
---
yep then try practicing your aim on casual
---
From my understanding on the patch notes I believe when she has accessed the cams and is viewing them the light will be yellow since she's an attacker. That's why they've had to simplify it basically...all cams regardless of the device will be blue when defenders are using / yellow when attackers are using / white will only be used by vigil and nokk to confirm they can't be seen.
---
Personally I think that for a ranked environment, the most competitive settings should be in place. Bomb just so happens to be the most competitive game mode so I personally like this change. Also imo, only pl maps should be in the rotation, also the new seasonal map
---
I can respect that and I agree it's thrilling to do all those run outs. Well if Ubi does one new map and three map buffs per year, maybe you will get your wish.
---
woooosh

Current retirement age in Morocco is 61 so we might be losing him sooner than that!

I main Echo and even I don‚Äôt do that, I played a match where a kid wanted to do a solo clutch for his YT channel and killed the entire team. He did not clutch he died when he stupidly ran in and tried to plant the bomb with THE ENTIRE ENEMY TEAM WAS IN THERE!!!

Thx for the response :)

R6 has been around for 20 years. One of the first games to do single shot headshots, no respawns, no jumping...
---
Siege devs have pooneered some good design, operators, destruction... But they are trying to hard to copy other 'pro league' titles with stuff like reducing round times, increasing the speed and trying to turn the game I to fast paced good for tv action. When the game was designed for slower paced more realistic action
---
Not much to really go on with your post there, mate.
---
Does it happen all the time? 
---
What is the serer you are connecting to, and your location?
---
Have you checked the Network tab in your resource monitor to see if anything is using it all up? (all my game saves will auto backup to google drive once a week, and that just kills my internet for 10 minutes until it is completed)
---
these "60" million players are spread across PC, PS, XB and each have more than 6 server-regions. majority being console, therefore yes there will be a difference and no you wont even have 20millions on PC, especially in one region.
---
According to steam (yes I know uplay exists too) there are currently aprx. 60k players per day on average...
---
I‚Äôm not sure if the operator‚Äôs in game age changes over time or not
---
Probably like some bullshit
---
Might have something to do with how ranked keeps getting more and more content removed from it.
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
Try out Sledge. Basically a Buck with a better gun in my opinion. Run Compensator and Vertical and your good.
---
from what I understand some of the devs were pulled from Siege to work on the new Ghost Recon game. so I don't think it was just them being lazy, it was kind of out of their control. Ubi's fault but not really the dev's fault
---
Reposterino
---
Didn‚Äôt downvote - upvote
---
That's why I suggested only having it on every other shot, that can give you an extra shot which makes up for the loss of damage.
---
As some have pointed out, the different modes should have separate ranks. They are vastly different and a player who's platinum in Secure Area for example, might not play the other two at the same level. I know I didn't when I switched from Secure Area back in Red Crow to exclusively bomb which I've been ever since.
---
I'm also pretty certain that the maps are mainly designed around Bomb and the other two most likely only come in later where they might make some tweaks to help them be more viable, but mainly they just see which rooms would fit the best for each objective in Hostage / SA. Bomb is also arguably the most balanced mode of them all which is probably at least a part of the reason why it's the only mode in Pro League play. Secure Area can lead to some situations where the round lasts forever and some rooms are much easier to defend than they should be (not that all sites are perfect on Bomb either). Hostage is just a clusterfuck of a mode honestly with very little balance whatsoever and while I hate it, there's no reason why it'd be wrong to enjoy playing it.
---
Just slap a different rank for each player in each mode and we're set.
---
damn
---
maybe
---
Expect server maintenance for TTS at around 11 or midday central time (you can look up your own time zone) with a patch soon after.
---
How is that even related to this thread?
---
it really did make maps i've played hundreds of times feel new because the new strats you have to use
---
you got that charm if you watched a tot amount of hour of the proleague via twitch official channel
---
I guess, but it doesn't really phase me. In fact, this proposed change would only benefit those who need to aim with a shotgun. Meaning, finka rushing with the sausage is not a problem because she is just hip firing.
---
I mean like the platinum and diamond ones and the other 6? Or are they the same?
---
So they can't do both is what you're telling me? They have 3 months between each season and ‚Äé13,742 employees but they can't create new content and fix bugs? no one is asking for it to be done instantly, hell, I'd be fine with operation health 2 over this, it's just lazyness.
---
If only one person rappels on the spiral wall/windows or is on the roof its a free kill...
---
Yeah it's funny. People always say how big he is. But he smol boi.
---
Dont turn shadow on low they are Great for getting easy prefires i think he is thinking of shading or something like that. But shadows should be high or better imo
---
I see him possibly being one of the top most banned ops because of his ability.  It would be a tough vote for me between Echo and him.
---
There is one pro for this change. Since secure is the easiest game mode certain players tend to only play it. (I did the same for 3 months).  
---
 I see this at beginning of every season, while ranking up until high gold. Enabling all games modes significantly increases learning curve. There are so many clueless players running in bomb eventough based on their rank/level they should have atleast a basic understanding  bomb mode/sites. It's clearly because they divide their learning/playing between 3 game modes.  
---
 IMO secure/hostage should only be available for new players after have a minimal understanding of the game mode which around most things are balanced. They just teach them bad habbits. For example so many poeple convinced garage is the most viable site in Chalet eventough in bomb it's not that simple. Same with Consulate's garage. After certain experience you understand how to play all 3 modes but in the beginning it can be counterproductive. Also it makes matchmaking unbalanced.
---
I‚Äôm high gold/plat and wouldn‚Äôt mind playing as all my friends have stopped for the end of the season. If you guys get into gold quick we could easily push plat.
---
It's simple.  Limit the range of MMRs that can queue together unless 5 stacked, like CSGO does.
---
Oh okay so like how do you link the rainbow account and twitch account
---
I say this in the nicest way possible, but what a fucking moron

Forgot his name but the guy who said that also leaked Y4S2 ops (and a lot of other ops) and also got the rework of Kanal and Kafe right.
---
What kind of thumbs do you have that line up with your other knuckles?
---
At high levels of play, having an 81 round mag and ACOG is far more useful than an easier recoil pattern (recoil doesn't really matter once you get used to that gun's pattern)
---
*secret* service
---
Yes but when you have a lobby full of plat2s the difference in skill level between all players is massive. It doesn't take much to destroy people in casual. A gold 1 can do the same, and a gold 1 can also "accidentaly" end up in plat 2.
---
How bout smoke or mute? Good shotgun and if you learn to control the smg11 it rules as well.
---
It‚Äôs one of the best dmr‚Äôs
---
Yeah sure mate, what‚Äôs your name on Uplay?
---
Hello whatsf3lix,
---
I honestly agree with this though i only play and enjoy bomb mode. Ubisoft rushed this decision and they should have accounted for players who want to play ranked but not pro league, siege is a game after all.  
---
they should  add a new playlist of fix the casual matchmaking/rules 
---
 first.
---
i like it
---
Just casual things
---
At first the lmgs aren't that good because it's a fcking cqc game and the mg3 is huge m8. The uzi is outdated and even though there are some older weapons they are unique a fcking uzi is not unique when there is a mag 10.
---
Recoil is a bit more than this because u have vertical and horizontal recoil and horizontal recoil can't be controlled like vertical recoil. So it needs knowledge and a feeling for some weapons. Buck for example isn't easy to control.
---
Ur logic would mean that cs go recoil is just pull down ur weapon and that's wrong.
---
There is a reason why they gave the FMG to Nokk, because that is a weapon which will balance out her skill. You can play around with the stats all you want: low dmg but high fire rate, high dmg-low fire rate, it doesnt matter in a sense that it should be on the level of the FMG. Then again, it's just doesnt make any sense to waste resources on creating a weapon wich would perform as the same as the FMG if we already have the FMG.
---
I wouldn't get on a cam in front of that window to start the round. You're asking to get put on a highlight clip
---
Fucking stop the G.I.S. T-hunt challenges. They are a pain in the ass.
---
I've wanted an attacker for a while who can rapel up hatches, Both these operators are what we need in siege.
---
Lmao. IQ on 1F takes out everything electronic, or Thatcher or Mav. Zofia/Ash/Sledge (some of the most popular ops) take out castles easily. Barrel storage is nigh indefensible. If you have a heavy site presence you will get demolished from vertical play, and if you have a heavy roam presence a Thermite/Thatcher will force people to filter in from maybe 2 entrances (door + rota hole). Pretty much the shittiest site in Hereford.
---
Hey chill, in truth I'm not angry about the update "wich" guns they use won't ruin the operator. I'm just curious about the community opinion, personally I thought if they tweaked him to a 2 speed and a minor buff to his ability he could be a very viable op. I'm not disagreeing with how he can counter but he could be more fun as well and exciting.
---
Usually updates go live between 3pm and 4pm cest
---
From skin exposing to Smoke's Canisters, only Smoke has the suit protect him, the dev team once explained this.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind it and I personally feel that the game should be working smoothly before you enter a new season so you just don‚Äôt keep piling up the issues.
---
The people who say that when its not true are just as bad as the actual blind fan boys.
---
Oh no! That's a crime of a century!

*HOW DARE YOU USE MAESTROS GODLINESS FOR SOMETHING AS DISGUSTING AS THAT*

There are so many counters to the Shield i honestly dont see the problem with them that could cause "frustration"
---
You can still play it in casual :)
---
Yeah no. Maybe the 2F vertical play to shoot out hard breach on the single wall, but it is still the shittiest secure room site on Hereford. The bomb sites on B/3F are much better.
---
Operation health 2 would also mean no new guns aswell. But seriously, new guns aren't needed for the game so i would prefer they focus on other parts of the game that are needed.
---
Just don't turn off your ears and you should be fine.
---
Oh i dont think so
---
The problem is when making him a 2 speed people start roaming and than they break his ability and making him less useful with this addition he is more or less forced to be on spot and making him more efficient on spot. But yes many people won't like this.
---
Sry for being rude but to many people don't get the point of this ops and need to rant about it which annoys me
---
Welcome to watchmojo.com today were counting down our picks for the top 10 anime battles
---
So Valkyrie has a dick?
---
Oh. You get the season rank charms (bronze copper silver gold platinum diamond) from playing ranked matches and getting into that rank for the season. So if you hit platinum and drop out you still get the platinum charm.
---
Probably 12-2pm ET.
---
Git gud
---
People ask the same question every time. And the question is always in the title. You think imma read the body when all i need to do an answer the question?
---
now it's too late to get it,but next time you watch proleague or major events like Six Invitational or Six Major via twitch official channel you should look near the title of the stream the Twitch Drop section from there you will be able to link account and get the charm
---
Absolutely
---
Okay thanks
---
*laughs in the skylight right above him*
---
Can we just remove all operators they anoy me soooo much we should just be a Recruit Only game
---
Yeah no prob
---
Good now i can be queued with people who actually know how to play bomb. 
---
Very infuriating that you play with people who just play for kills or roamers that are nowhere to be found when bomb is planted.
---
I can see why people are upset by this change, but bomb is a whole different animal compared to secure and hostage. Besides the objective in those gamemodes rarely ever make a difference, You are basically playing team deathmatch in those gamemodes.
---
I was playing Favela and got downed (I swear I headshot the Kapkan) and she was just afk (we lost 3-0 because of her)
---
They're making the game more competitive, it's naturally going to be played faster if that's the most effective thing. If you're talking about reducing the casual round timer by 30 seconds that's because you don't need 4 minutes to not push the objective then in the last 10 seconds run in and blindly die like most casual rounds go. (Obviously exaggerating) The game originally was built to be slower, but tachanka was also originally a good operator. Now people know the game better, and the game's focus shifts with people's skill.
---
My favorites are Bandit, Doc, and Mute.
---
Okay thanks a lot any idea when the next one of these events will be?
---
Body is Vigils model
---
There's always a bigger ass to eat*
---
Apparently so! An awful decision for the community, no matter how many bomb elitists try to justify it, it makes zero sense.
---
Thank you!
---
It's sarcasm.
---
i guess around 6pm CET
---
To make you get banned?
---
It's like bucks dmr mixed with ela's shotgun

Use it on drone holes to block them

lol I only have sledge
---
Bomb diamonds get ass blasted by secure plats 
---
Bomb players: :O 
---
It works both ways bud, both game modes have different strategies.
---
Not only money also makes the game size bigger and nobody wants that tbh. This is why operators videos are only on yt now.
---
URRhhHHGGG Colonel, I‚Äôm an idiot. r/woooosh
---
I know, you said 18+, and I'm only 16, but I would be interested if you really need to fill up that space. Also, if you say 18+ because of squeakers and/or voice, I was told that I sound like 21, so maybe we can go play some matches and then you decide whether you would give me a chance or not. Would really appreciate that :)
---
oh my fucking god
---
That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre making ranked more competitive
---
Sneaky turds like this are screwed when programmers learn what parallax is.
---
That's correct. 
---
I've heard stories where people didn't get their highest rank as their charm, but again, just stories. Never seen any proof lol.
---
I bought Ash first then Pulse.
---
Yeah, and they‚Äôre forced to play maps like Favela or sites like Teller's on Border. No thank you.
---
Hopefully the next elite is Mira, possibly something connected to her past when she was working as a mechanic with her father... but Smoke and Montagne are due one too.
---
I play the game pretty casually and like to try my hand in ranked when I can. The sweaty players don‚Äôt mean more, we all bought the game.
---
Yes, but, which of those were you given? Or did you get to choose?
---
Its just some clan rule because some kid gave our leader a very difficult time and what not, i cant change it, but i can try to work something out, also for r6 the minimum age is 17 i do believe

I know that much, but from what I understand, before Frost and Buck were released the original CTUs had to be purchased in the same way DLC characters are nowadays. So with that in mind, which CTU was unlocked by default? Or did you have Recruit until you had enough renown to purchase someone?
---
I love how this question is in every comment section.
---
For the record, I could of been higher than gold 3. I 've faced Diamonds who were mouse and keyboard and beat them. Mnk play at all levels so relax. Mnk love secure too and well done for checking my page to find me mention my rank well done for wasting your time
---
Because it wasn't balanced. Some angles you could see the enemy fine while they couldn't see you very well and vice versa. Visual clutter like that shouldn't be in a game like Siege.
---
thanos is getting all of these infinity stones.
---
Disgusting. 
---
I love it.
---
You got to chose originally
---
three weeks from now
---
Tactical Spooking Operations
---
Ah, so the game gave you just enough renown to choose someone and begin playing?
---
Last I checked;

Xbox One; 50 vert, 70 hori, 45 ads, 5/5 deadzone. 
---
On pc: a 36? Think I'm running like 1200 dpi.

Chef Sledge bundle.
---
Should be on or around the 11th of June. Approximately 3 weeks after TTS launch.
---
First DLC operator I bought was Valkyrie, First operator at all i think Thermite but i didn't remember since so much time was passed.
---
Idk I‚Äôm pretty sure if you just bought the complete edition it wouldn‚Äôt matter
---
Ban reinforcements
---
So if you don't like bomb you can only play the one game type with a long timer, no choice in site to defend, and bad maps in rotation? Why not let the players actually have a choice instead?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be as bothered if we could choose our sites in casual or remove garbage maps like Favela...but we can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs between that or forced bomb with PL rules, without even the PL map pool.
---
I saw the footprints going into the room and none leaving, and I almost died
---
iT's PiZzA tImE
---
The actual post I made (refer to the title) refers to solo smurfing. The problem of boosting overall, especially on ranked, is a more complex issue. But the casual experience is supposed to be casual, it doesn't even make sense to me that it's skill- based mm.
---
No thanks, I‚Äôll stick to the Elite skin
---
That's weird. I could've sworn I tried throwing one as Mute recently and it plopped like a stone. I'll test it again today and see.
---
They're also loud as shit and have no place in the middle of an important objective. Sound is a key component of Siege. There's no point in making it hard to hear plants/counterdefuses for the sake of "muh realism." It only hurts the gameplay.
---
On one shoulder, the 416-C recommends me to use it for toxic spawn peeks.
---
On the other, the M870 wants me to disrespect them with it by saying their not worthy of being spawn peeked.
---
Of course. I love the c1 and have black ice for it but the super 90 is my child. Even if it's not its former crossmapping self it's still amazing.
---
What about u and the Aug? When ur in an automatic mood
---
^ 2F play, just bandit trick the other wall, no issues. Yep taking bomb sites on the 3f are the worst to take
---
But if you just play a lot of ranked and have like a 3 day booster or something, you can get them both really fast. I think last week I got about 100k renown with a 7 day booster.
---
Every time someone on the other team hard carries their team (14+ kills) it‚Äôs always a damn doc main. Doc isn‚Äôt even good! Rook is better.
---
You need mental help
---
Well considering he‚Äôs shooting them right off spawn I doubt anybody would have time to get all the way up there before he is gone
---
They said in the reveal for this season they are not ready to release the shields yet but they did show off some changes
---
\*great ideas
---
You: *points out something*
---
Americans:  **TRIGGER DISCIPLINE**
---
&gt;gold 1 can also "accidentaly" end up in plat 2.
---
  
---
Doubt. The only way that's happening is if they have an insane luck streak right after placements when their ELO still has elasticity.
---
I think that it can be shot from a launcher
---
The audio in the video leads me to believe this isn‚Äôt the first time he used that spot that game
---
I have it on Xbone
---
So your telling me the worst map in ranked pool Is worse than favela? And also how did I put words in people's mouth I quoted him saying Just play casual tf?
---
But with recruit you get 2 utilities so balanced
---
I don‚Äôt understand it. If causal was the exact same game mode as ranked minus ranks then sure I can see a slight argument. It‚Äôs not though. So why cut the content?
---
I used to call it the stuper 90 cause it was stupid good lol. Tbh I don‚Äôt really use the aug that much. I love the shotgun so much.
---
Drone gets shot: You Died!
---
I mean he wants to make money just like you when you go to work everyday...
---
No. 
---
Don't^At^Me
---
I read that as cargo hoodie
---
Yeah but it's about the connotation. "Camping" in siege is not negative, but it is negative in traditional fps games.
---
The very bottom face pic reminds me of Tom cruise.
---
If they saw you cut a hole, their gonna be staring at that wall like a hawk.
---
if this was console they wouldn't hit you their in a million years
---
I have a squad of 4 sometimes 5 and we only play Secure casual because there is no Ranked Secure
---
He is Mr. Fantastic.
---
What a team player!
---
They are probably going to rework him soon and hopefully Tachanka too
---
Fun as hell thou
---
I saw it once on the recomended games or something but when i search for it it is not here
---
Thats basically what happened
---
Hey, how do you get that Doc Main tag?
---
&gt; Epi said Nokk had a carbine and it was taken away 
---
That doesnt even make sense.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
IF that were true, why not just nerf her AR? It's not like there is any consistency in this game... we have how many ARs with diffrent RoFs/DMG/recoil?
---
We have 9mms hitting harder than 7.62 and .556s .. this game has -zero- consistency.
---
Just nerf hers, and nobody would bat an eye.
---
&gt; Personally I don't like N√∏kk... 
---
It is war, then.
---
TL:DR
---
at least with operation health they were upfront about cutting content
---
i also hate this mindset that ubi has to either fix bugs currently in the game OR add new content. they're not a small indie studio, they should have the budget and manpower to do both (have one team make new content, and the other fix current problems). [after all siege has pulled in over 1 billion in revenue for ubisoft.](https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/15/rainbow-six-siege-tops-1-1-billion-in-revenues-and-45-million-players/)

Just play solo defense on house in the workshop you fucking normies

You can spawnpeek all the terros from balcony, place barbwire on stairs and kids room so you know when they're coming and just pop them
---
Literally the easiest 250 credits you'll get
---
"Not so quiet after all, hm?"
---
Not necessarily, you wouldn't have to give valk one. Also, bandit is still wayyy stronger than Kaid and a lot of people don't like the shotgun. I feel it would be a change for the better and would make him a little bit stronger. He has his uses, but he is still 3 armour and has to hold long peeks.
---
But the question is how would you rank performance? Most people say kills, but I would rather have a Monty  that gets a plant off or a thermite that breaches an important wall, rather than a blackbeard that gets an extra kill every round. kills are still important, but how do you determine their value in comparison to other objective oriented plays? Maybe a voting for teammates or opponent players system? but that would surely be abused.
---
Totally agree, i like secure area too
---
Wow. Normally I get lower frames.
---
honestly i think they've forgotten that he even exists

If Caveira have interrogation, why can't Nokk have negotiation? ü§î

Caveira: "Spill it!"

Nokk: "Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Look ! It's your teammate's Smoke's SMG ! 
---
Caveira: "And ... ?"
---
Nokk: "Well ... hm ... I'm gonna tell you a secret but don't tell anyone ok?"
---
Caveira: "Go on !"
---
Nokk: "Errr ... I'm actually a big fan of Smoke/Vigil/Lesion and more importantly You Senpai!, I've been finding ways to join the defender task force but your boss doesn't allow the same abilities on your side!"
---
Caveira: "Wanna kill us all and you can have your spot then ... ?"
---
Nokk: "No no no! I'm being dead serious! But ... let me tell you something more important, your new buddy ... your new buddy ... W ... W ... Warden is actually ... an undercover ... his smart glass said to be immune against smoke and flash, but it's actually injected with 5G technology, once activated all your teammates location are revealed"
---
Caveira: "OwO Freally ... Imma go kill that POS!! Like right fucking now"
---
Nokk: "Yeah men))) that's why his chest armor says "A POS" also, hey want some Denmark cookie before you blast off as well?"
---
To me her biggest issue is the same one Monty has, in a three way gunfight with Clash/Monty in the middle the person on their side can't be as gun ho with their shots for risk of shooting them.
---
Rather this just being a teammate issue the opposing player is facing a bulletproof wall that they are free to shoot the edge of hoping for a shot at the player behind, the other person has much less room to shoot before their start hitting the Monty/Clash.
---
Side note, that issue is made so much worse because so many of the people that play either can't seem to sit still and wanted to constantly shuffle back and forth.
---
I play casual only since release, its nowhere near as bas as you make it out to be.

Okay thank you, and I like running and gunning if that what fragging means lol
---
My nonexistent son is cizzors he will beat you in speedrunning
---
lol
---
I would rate this a 5/7
---
Not OP but [here](https://www.windowscentral.com/rainbow-six-siege-clash-shield-glitch-interview), it's from an interview with Alexandre Remy
---
Oh ya that's a good option thanks
---
When you take away maestros shield, and he just creates his own
---
&gt;Does CSGO have a ranked version of deathmatch or gun game? 
---
Dont even try to compare siege to CSGO.
---
Deathmatch and gungame rely on respawning, and are a warmup for comp.
---
What gamemode relys on respawning, or hell a 5 minute warmup mode in Siege?
---
Oh right, none.
---
And if I do play a casual bomb/hostage mode, I wont be teamkilled for picking a new gun, unlike siege's operators.
---
Even CSGO allows Hostage AND bomb defusial in their competitive modes. They only remove a few maps for public comp too, to rework them.
---
And valve doesn't take weeks to fix gamebreaking bugs... like shield exploits.
---
r/rimjobsteve
---
When you a dealing with a competitive game like Siege, your ranked/competitive mode NEEDS to be similar to PL. They have found what works and what PL has enjoyed, and they feel the need to bring it to Ranked now. After playing the SI playlist I don't see how ANYONE can be opposed to it, I haven't ever enjoyed Siege as much as I did on those weekends. It creates a better quality for the competative side of the game, while Casual still holds everything for those who want to enjoy them. I've put a lot of time in Casual, and I see no reason why people disregaurd it so much. Those who want to play Hostage, Secure, or not comp maps can have a perfectly fine and enjoyable time in Casual, you don't need a rank tacked onto something to make it enjoyable.
---
About time ubi starts tailoring the game to ultra competitive
---
You have ascended.
---
Her hitbox is stupidly small which makes hitting her very hard. Also she is very fast and before Ubi removed the ACOG on the R4-C had one of the best guns in the game.
---
How?
---
My only real complaint is that you could already play bomb only if you wanted.  You (and your teammates) just had to turn off your settings for Secure, and Hostage.    
---
I completely understand bomb is considered the more balanced game mode, so it‚Äôs a sort of reasonable decision.  But I still think having the option to play secure area in ranked should be there.  A lot of players are more comfortable playing secure than they are bomb, and imo it‚Äôs part of the experience I payed for.   
---
Hostage never should‚Äôve been in ranked though.  Hostage needs a massive overhaul.
---
Second opinion, I also like cheese on pizza
---
Isn't reinforcing the garage door a must? Lol mozzie got his helmet blown off for doing it late
---
Clap them ash cheeks
---
There‚Äôs no telling....maybe you‚Äôll get some nice people in your games. Who knows lol.

You generally have to spam click the spot on the screen to lock that op if you want a chance. At least for the first few days

I have secure and hostage enabled and played it maybe 3 times in the last 2 years, makes no difference in high rank since nobody else has it enabled. I imagine this will make the ranks more proportional everyone is in the same pool of play.
---
My bad thanks bro
---
Maybe not 2 rounds but just on the first one
---
&gt;tachanka was also originally a good operator.
---
Nah, he was never good.
---
Will give it a try later, cheers
---
My uncle is Jeff Kaplan he will haunt your dreams
---
Yeah that seems more better, id rather loose 3 minutes than 6.
---
Understandable.
---
I agree. I noticed the most important thing is sensitivity. So many people have too high sensitivities and their aim ends up flicking around everywhere. 
---
General sensitivity is important but deadzone is key. It fine tunes your aim so much.

REPOST ALERT REPOST ALERT!!!!!!!

What the actual fuck is this

That‚Äôs very cool!  I love folklore, so that was a great read!
---
That's a way to maintain positivity in this horror show of a game.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it
---
Love it.
---
haha very funny
---
Lmao you have spurred me on to post my clips
---
Casual Monty is really sad to watch.
---
A lot of people don't take advantage of his vertical capability. While he can't make gaping holes like Buck or Sledge, his gadget is quiet so you can make small holes above common hiding spots without defenders knowing.
---
Because the community is extremely cringey. I've seen too many kids dancing in public spaces to justify playing that game.
---
Never baricade doors for nothing
---
The PDW is not weak my guy it's just overlooked cause the C7E is so good.
---
I can understand why you have come to the conclusion you have.
---
But - Siege is not a game that can endure such a change. I think the game will loose a big portion of it's player base. I myself am a high plat player. And I have friends in both Diamond, Plat, Gold, Silver and Bronze, and I would be furious if I couldn't play with them all. It's actually the exact feature that makes me not wanna play CS:GO, since we always have to be 5 players to start a match.
---
Also I think it will make the smurfing problem much, much, much worse than it is right now.
---
I was going to say he looks like Gary Oldman
---
Hey at least fortnite is doing some good, that's practically where most of the trash players are now. It's like a video game day care.
---
The simplest and most effective Tachanka rework would be to just improve the stats on his turret.
---
Remove the recoil (it's mounted to a tripod ffs) and increase the shield's health (so that anyone angle-cheesing it will at least have to spend a substantial amount of time and ammo.)
---
UTC never changes, and most of Europe is on UTC+2 right now IIRC so it's at 19:30, except of course if you're British, Portuguese etc
---
Agreed, I was saying that because it is compared to ARs
---
It really doesn't do much of anything, like at end of the prep phase you could but they can literally shoot down the barricade in two seconds
---
I see you're ps4. Wanna play together?
---
I would love to know how you stack those flairs dad
---
I don't think this is the right place to ask
---
So first ur observation is correct but u forgot a few things.
---
At first nokk is copied but brings in a new role for attack but even cav can't operate that stealthy so she brings in something Noone else can do. Yes decision making isn't that hard but there for the use of the ability isn't that good compared to hibana. My point with hiaban was that she is more or less thermite so she isn't something original.
---
Warden also fullfilles a role Noone else has on defense and also is the first counter to capitao and galz.
---
Teamplay: u can combine a nokk with a jackel to track and eliminate a roamer with a never seen efficiency. Nokk also can flank the enemy defense and break it, so the main attack has a huge advantage. Of course is nokk also capable of being selfish but with her weak loadout I don't think that selfish people going to play her.
---
Wardens teamplay: combine him with Mira and u can denie every smoke plant with communication u can make callouts and give ur m8s a position for the C4. Warden rly brings in a teamplay component that u need to use otherwise he won't be that effective through his weak mpx and no C4 and being a 1 speed.
---
U know I see ur problems but when thinking about possibly new ways to play and making a comparison to older ops I rly love the new ways to play.
---
And being realistic hibana doesn't need that much decision making : when having a thermite go for hatches otherwise open the main walls that u attack every round.
---
Oh shit it's you again. Nvm no hax. Just great aim
---
So canonically everything roughly is happenig in the same year ?
---
No its an extension question. Can you but R6 Credits ingame?
---
Probably lost all your games so your % goes up
---
So if fortnite is considered for kids, what's does that make ninja then, a really tall kid? ü§î
---
I gotcha and I really don't think the Fmg will be all that bad either, I really don't use smoke but when I did I used that a majority of the time
---
Level 185 here.  Console former plat (currently gold) anyway... all I play and know is secure.  I try Bomb and it's a whole 'nother game to me. I get confused, don't know what's going on, get TK'd and knifed for securing certain walls (not between sites of course) and it's like a whole 'nother culture I don't understand.   I'm already used to all my plays and routes and techniques w/ secure.  I come back to Siege nearly every day for secure. I have hostage and bomb disabled.  I really wish to keep the option to play the mode I like in ranked.   Secure ranked is serious but not as sweaty as bomb.  Not everyone is 16.
---
Did you respond to the wrong person? I said the point he is arguing is irrelevant to me as I agree with the point. I'm just pointing out the flaw in his argument. Money being spent is a straight up flawed argument as somebody advocating the opposite can just point out they spent the same or more and now they're at a stalemate.
---
The m12 is even worse than the fmg 9
---
Proper trigger discipline
---
Yeah and it can be useful in last few seconds to mess up an attacker but you have to put it up during the end of a round which is well risky
---
I find it funny that you make it sound like I can't get any kills and just stay in the back all the time :)
---
But if you really find dead weight annoying, you should stop solo-que and get yourself a 5-stack that can match yourself.
---
Maybe down in Copper. I'm a high Plat/Diamond and we have great aim because we're versing M&amp;K
---
Watch out for the skylight tho
---
Sorry but the game doesn‚Äôt revolve around whether you are getting carried by people a higher rank or you carrying people a lower rank than you. Plus it‚Äôs only in ranked so nobody‚Äôs preventing you from not playing with all of your friends. A similar system is in overwatch and the community is doing just fine. They didn‚Äôt lose half of their playerbase
---
"...They were wrong..."
---
 it just depends on what part of the states your in
---
Can‚Äôt wait for someone to get mad at a missed headshot cause they were really aiming at his pizza head
---
It's a net, not a cloth. You can easily see through it.

You guys honestly have skills, like to shoot that many bullets and not even hit them by accident, that's crazy.

Either you loose a lot or have bad luck

Smurf

It tells you how many people have each trophy on ps4
---
MP5K and the FMG have almost identical stats what would be the point besides being aesthetically accurate
---
Yeah, all of the post-launch missions are available forever now. The Two Ghost Recon Crossover missions (Operation Silent Spade (GRFS) and Operation Oracle (GRB)) are accessible via the Cartel destabilisation screen, the Splinter Cell mission (Operation Watchman) is started when you enter the province of La Cruz, and the Rainbow Six (Operation Archangel) and Predator (The Jungle Moved) missions can be found in Libertad and Caimanes.
---
Thank you bro
---
I don‚Äôt know, I play on console, and think that and Frost‚Äôs smg are strong for picking people off... N√∏kk is for the front line, but it seems like for a more stealthy approach... She still not Ash
---
Doesn‚Äôt it reduce your vision though?
---
LOL ohhhhhh the classic money vs time argument. 30 bucks for a year pass with new content every few months is hands down a crazy good value if you're enjoying the game. I can barely go see a movie and eat at the theater for less than 20 bucks. 30 for something I'll get more than a couple hours out of (a movie) is a solid return. Don't be absurd lol.
---
When the FMG has the same stats as pre-nerf mp5
---
I think I first saw it in a Macie Jay video, I don't know who CoconutBrah is. To youtube, I guess!
---
Would be a fun event but would make running the game harder and it would be chaotic
---
Cav and vigil two precise examples of ops I absolutely have problems with for this very reason and in fact are the two ops Nokk is a combination of ....
---
As for doc I described it above in this thread go find it but he does indeed have lasting value for team. Echo does as well in the same way as maestro ( his drones are cameras ). 
---
Smokes grenades benefit his whole team for entry denial but he has to be alive for any value to his team. This is ok as my main point is the lasting value to his team and team play abilities. Also smoke has generally a fairly weak kit so I let him off the hook a bit for that
---
Looks like the ash flashbanged that thatcher
---
Maybe farm reowns and get one if them?
---
The actual ubi/rainbow site concept art for N√∏kk

10/10
---
Until everyone gets teamed killed to make it 2vs7
---
Ubi mentioned she originally had an AR but it was too powerful.
---
I know right!
---
I play rocket league on a daily basis because the game has insanse variety and competition. Crazy how that works.
---
I can try hard in ranked 3s in champ 2 or switch to a completely different mode like dropshot/rumble/ hoops and still have ranks and unique end of season rewards to play for. All while having queue times around 30 seconds!
---
Oh and casual isn‚Äôt completely unplayable cancer.
---
It‚Äôs crazy how a game like rocket league does it so much better than pretty much any other competitive game.
---
I agree with this if it was a few months ago but now that csgo is a free to play game they are still growing. A lot of the new players don‚Äôt stay around, but yes anyone who uses reddit most likely has played cs for a year +
---
I would love to see their face the exact moment when they realise what there shooting at. It must be like the moment when you see yourself running in the kapkan trap or you realise that the enemy team has a frost and you didn't look down while vaulting. A look of pure terror and defeat.
---
I bet thats on purpose.

Yea I understand what you feel, but most importantly at least you had fun ;)
---
I play Xbox, it‚Äôs not that bad
---
Well god dam I‚Äôm not a builder but I know you need a good foundation in all things. Maybe Ubisoft cheaped out and didn‚Äôt fully commit. Siege 2 or whatever sequel this has will be interesting to see now that they probably realize they own one of the best realistic CQC games there is.
---
My only problem was she played dumb to ask leading questions. Just tell the designer to explain.
---
he is already gone, as he spawnpeaked and got 2 teammates...

Every time you and the other guy said "Bomb", it should've been replaced with "Pro-League"

Hello IgnitionESL, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/brdobp/join_our_esl_team_ignition/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I was unreasonably uncomfortable watching this clip.

Well I'm glad you didn't saw it was the voices in your head! Lol. 
---
I'm sure it wasn't easy, I would never pretend it was and and it's not something I would want to do. 
---
Also if you want some really cringe jokes, just ask me. Mine could clear a room.
---
Exactly, I have probably 500 hours put into the game, only about 10 of those are in ranked.
---
I can't tell if this is toxic or if the enemy just sucked
---
There really are exceedingly few exceptions to this rule of gadgets providing utility to the team as R6S is on the whole a team oriented game...

Hmm yeah, the way he held his arms up suggests so, I didnt even notice. Good eye damn
---
No, it's woven from thin material. It might darken your vision very little, but the camouflage is much better.
---
oooo I should make a menacing edit lol
---
A six foot blade never loses reception
---
That‚Äôs true, I guess my problem is more with people who try to peek every round. Yes, they are easy to counter; however, I still don‚Äôt see it as fun competitively to win a 5v3: whether you are defending or attacking.
---
Please do
---
Ubi said she had an AR in early development and she was overpowered
---
She was probably nervous about being the new face for siege. A loyal but fierce fan base. I don‚Äôt blame her for not being super articulate for her first one. I wish her luck, she did good!
---
P90SD. No acog, low damage. Would be fair and cool.
---
it would be more perfect if it was the demon woman caveira
---
‚ÄúUseful‚Äù
---
I'd go more with incentivising staying in game than punishing leaving. Ranked already punishes leavers, yet lower ranks don't really care. So it's an easy example of why just the stick won't work. You need the carrot as well. And there are numerous cases that back this up (XCOM 2 punishing taking your time with turn timers for instance, there are plenty of mods that lengthen or disable them).
---
The whole using acog as balancing thing kinda pisses me off a little. If Ubisoft seems to fucking hate acog so much why not just completely remove them? That sounds balanced to me.
---
*I'm not that good at drawing*
---
‚ÄúFoolishness, cav, foolishness.‚Äù
---
Yeet that candela
---
My thought on all of this is why not make separate playlist ranks? That way secure, hostage, and bomb are all separated from one another. Most games with ranked modes have this in their ranking system.
---
You hate having it happen to you, but love when you get one. I remember an ace I got on bank front door spawn peeking. I felt like a king. 
---
Actual tips
---
Don‚Äôt spawn popular run out spawn spots or be ready for one if you don‚Äôt want to change your spawn spot
---
If I bought the season 4 pass that gave me mozzie and gridlock will that also give me the two new ones when they come out ?
---
Lights on; lights OUT!
---
It‚Äôs okay she was nervous. But whoever wrote the script deserves to be shot. It was so cringy and made people dislike her
---
What's the deal with the chainmail viel, head thing, exactly? Tactism somehow?
---
Most of this game these days are minimum effort, they just barely do enough to make it scrape by
---
Not bad kid.
---
Better than I could do
---
To chanka
---
Cav has counterplay called teamplay and communication. Same goes for nokk when a roamer is far away and doesn't provide real use nokk will be superior and this is something good. Ops like nokk, vigil and cav don't need teamplay as something essential but they punish when there isn't teamplay.
---
Nokk is limited throughout the weapons the timer and she only can go not run. This makes her vulnerable and is a good counter, she also has plenty real counters.
---
When u combine the new ops with ur team u can get the most out of them if not ur not screwed like a hibana but u potentially lose 50 percent of ur effectiveness.
---
As long they balance out team oriented and teamplay oriented ops iam happy about such a new approach
---
It's not that bad on PS4 either, I'm just saying it is not like PC where aim is so easy even a 5 year old can do it.
---
It hurts to see maestro alibi lion and finka fucking up the color pattern
---
Yeeeees
---
Dude, you missed out _big-time._
---
But it‚Äôs pretty good
---
Oh look, another karma farm!
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware csgo was free to play now, so that definitely changes things!
---
Fairs
---
Yeah
---
It‚Äôs the old hibana character model
---
This is why you play on PC
---
Restart your queue it normally works when I do that
---
Valk is thicc, Grindlock is just fat
---
Exactly. If you wanted to play bomb only just turn off the other 2. Those that never wanted bomb only never turned it off.
---
I quite like them, actually    
---
Those small yellow dots on a digital camo, plus i have a thing for highlighted belts and harnesses
---
Its called "anchoring" in Siege though lol
---
BRO IM SO HAPPY FINALLY
---
She's a pretty shitty mechanic despite what everyone else says.
---
i like to take a break for a couple days or so from playing the game, because then when i play again, i get hyper aware and more energetic. or sometimes i'll just down a monster or a redbull about 10 minutes before i play
---
A wielding helmet?
---
It is camping, but there is abosultely nothing wrong with it lmao, it's Siege
---
To my knowledge there aren't any Norwegian (or Danish like Nokk) born operators.
---
I could be wrong, but iirc the only operator not originally from the country they work for is Ash, who was born in Israel.
---
Will it turn me into a lvl 327 doc main that spawn kills everyone?
---
Already tried that
---
Bearing is easier to control than the smg 12 lol
---
Kapkan should be higher than that...his traps will work more times than you could imagine. You just need to be more creative with the placement.(Not just the entrances of the objective but places often used and not checked by attackers, try putting yourself in their shoes.) 60 damage is a pretty big chunk of health and you can easily identify where was the explosion. He is also a pretty good lurker with a supressor, and angled grip on his smg. (Sorry for bad grammar, if i wrote anything stupid)
---
It‚Äôs when you run carrying the weapon with only one hand but I actually don‚Äôt know where that is in siege....
---
The difference between this and past updates to ranked is you can already turn off other game modes if you didn't want to play them.
---
This isn‚Äôt really a massive problem. This might happen 1/20 games or not even that
---
I did play a lot of lol hots and ow
---
Bruh I didn‚Äôt know you could do that with yings flash things
---
Or whatever her name is
---
Yeah but with the way the shoulders are aligned it doesn‚Äôt look like that is the case
---
Is it an issue? I think it fits her design considering her stealth is used to get up close and personal. Giving her an assault rifle with ACOG wouldnt fit her character; kind of like why Cav's pistol is most effective at close range.
---
I play exclusively bomb and have for a year or so. I think it‚Äôs a smart decision as far as balancing goes. However, I do see where people are coming from. It does feel like they‚Äôre restricting Ranked more and more, but that‚Äôs to make it as competitive as possible and I dig that
---
yeah that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre called, sorry my brain is fried i just took two finals

It's arsine in the canister. Neat.

This is common I chalk it up to a high rank being bored and just wants to ruin it for those who aren‚Äôt at his level. COD and overwatch has the same issues

You're getting awfully /r/iamverysmart over a bad attempt at humor.
---
It isn't some hot take either. Ubisoft has been actively balancing and designing their maps for Pro League. It's their new philosohpy regardless of your position on the changes. Pro league just happened to settle on bomb.
---
As for you, you didn't make any real point. Just spouted off some elitist bullshit, did some nice gatekeeping for a ranked mode in a video game, and then proceeded to spout out bullshit that would make casual even more of a fuckfest, which i wanna touch on.
---
Casual right now, in it's current state, is the perfect balance between the two. 3:30 minute rounds, best of 5. I really think that any more like the current comp queue will actively harm it.
---
 People play casual to chill out and have fun. Do stupid things. If it's literally just the comp queue, that removes the fun. Whether you want to actually believe it or not, this game needs casual to thrive. This game would not sustain well on the ranked playerbase alone.
---
It's so weird.
---
I think it would have been nice for warden to have the fmg and usg and give nokk the mpx. 
---
Devs said they couldn't let nook have an ar or acog because it was too strong, I'm sure they tested warden with an acog and just feared an anchor glaz.
---
I hate when new ops‚Äô gadgets are made ENTIRELY by other operators, they have no contribution
---
And the fact that Mira helped make hel is just weird too, like she‚Äôs an expert on bullet proof glass
---
What about Recruit chibi?
---
1. Acogs were taken away to stop people from holding long angles indoors and to stop 3 speeds from spawn peeking
---
2. Less people play ash and more people use the g36, which was ubisofts goal
---
I can see your point with the Deagle. Ubisoft has clearly started shifting away from realism and more towards whatever is fun or cool. What guns would you have given the new operators if you were in charge?
---
Fatty
---
The new operator Nokk I‚Äôm guessing since she operates her weapon with one hand while using her gadget.
---
U right
---
They never once lead us to believe they would make him a plague doctor and most of the recent elites tie into their character's story.
---
it‚Äôs the most competitive mode, i‚Äôm sure people like ARAMs on LoL but it doesn‚Äôt have a place in ranked
---
The pricing is pretty on par with other games and they offer plenty of opportunity to earn in game currency as is. Don't be a cheap-skate or don't complain
---
Jesus her eyes are the stuff of nightmares
---
Where's the new operator menu?
---
Just a fun fact: I'm from Poland as well
---
I never claimed they did.
---
At least no one could witness this since it was 5v5. No one would‚Äôve ever known...
---
Ohhh well I didn‚Äôt see her gameplay yet so that makes sense
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt really be calling for an acog before playing him. I‚Äôm just guessing that he won‚Äôt get picked as often as a three armor without one
---
I agree there are bigger games with less bugs. But this game has also been in development for a very long time and a lot of code constantly being piled on can mess things up drastically. Especially if their original base code from 4 years ago wasn't great. Which if it was then i would hope we could get another operation health or two so they can have a time off of making new content so they can fix everything.
---
Since when is Smoke's damage from his gadget "pathetic"? It's a fantastic area denial tool and anyone who tries to run through one will either die from the smoke or will get shot as soon as they through it. Besides that, Smoke's gas canisters are not effective as line of sight blockers. The cloud they create is inconsistent and isn't always the same on everyone's screen.
---
Because fuck you that's why
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
Honestly idk they both need love before being in the list ever again.
---
I'm still really sad the elite skin is not him in like, a stereotypical soccer dad outfit.. they memed IQ's elite, why not lesion too?
---
Not from what I've seen, I see your average player using it like it's just any other gun.  Anyone that has even the slightest idea what recoil control is should be able to use it granted they have a good sensitivity, the biggest problem is actually its  horizontal recoil, which is impossible to control as it goes left and right very quickly, that's what should be buffed really
---
Last year we had a season with no new weapons
---
I did a T'hunt extract hostage normal and got 2 bombers.
---
Dat weet ik ook wel, maar het is er can afgeleid en zoals je nu ziet zitten Nederlanders overal op Reddit
---
‚ÄúDeployed‚Äù I like that.
---
I wish we had seasonal dlc like chimera. But this time we're robbing banks. (That bank map tho)
---
Have what?
---
Absolutely terrible. Has extremely low damage for a shotgun. Its fire rate is less than viable considering it can only hold 3 shells at a time (one in the chamber, two in the magazine). The best shotgun in the game would have to be Frosts Super 90 or Echo and Hibanas Supernova. Of course theres always Dokkaebi and Vigils way robust shotgun but on console its not that good.
---
I'd thank him for the quick tour and admire him for his confidence.
---
They just pissed, cuz we got big dicks
---
The most robot battle ever, bandit vs ash
---
Well, good luck anyway.
---
ITS THE N√òKK-NESS MONSTER

My mouse just hovered over the unlock new OP button that's grayed out cause TTS unlocks all OP's for you.
---
They look like Timberland boots
---
Looks actually different than the recycled ones the past year. Very nice Ubi!
---
Longer wait than I thought
---
Defense and attack weapons have never mixed since this season
---
Everyone should like Bomb over Secure
---
Wardens background is marine before Secret Service
---
Lmao you‚Äôre so alone in this thread
---
Now this is an idea I can get behind because smoke and maestro will be more viable with a 7 second time.
---
You're off topic dude.
---
PUNISH THEM. They obviously do it more than once, this is not a 1 time thing. You can tell the diffrance between someone doing it accidental once of twice a week vs a group of 4 purposely doing it over and over again, taking it in turns so they dont face any punishment.
---
Reported for bullying
---
From a gold one to a silver one. You did good
---
Actual dane here and its nothing like nuck and its definately not nook, closest would be something like Noekk.
---
Castle is an underrated operator imo
---
Why isn't this on shittyrb6 instead of here
---
What happened to Justin anyways?
---
Yeah but she cute tho
---
Called chief he said this ain't it
---
Wait the furry skin wasn‚Äôt an elite ? üòÇ
---
Fuck I didnt plan on crying today.
---
id say you could give it to her if you just removed the acog
---
Idk i have never encounterd this even picking new ops like it happends but like at max once a week or once a month
---
Wow that's awful
---
Thanks. I appreciate that
---
Downvote me more pls. You get all the DLC for free anyway, there is literally zero reason to buy the season pass when you can just hop on the TTS to play the new operators.
---
Hello greySAMMY,
---
No, but there have been some leaked re-designs of the pro league sets for IQ, Tachanka, Rook, and Ash
---
His body got vaporized
---
Thermos
---
hopefully the automod doesn't keep removing these
---
Haha german men no more scope
---
Whoa you can‚Äôt do that, that‚Äôs too logical and wouldn‚Äôt spam the same question 1000 times
---
He's part of the Secret Service
---
Well, unless Ubi will finally buff him, he still can be memed.....
---
1. An automatic system is going to have a hard time making those calls
---
2. You can punish them. Ever heard of Ubisoft support? Honestly I have so much fun sending them clips of people being toxic assholes
---
There's nothing about sound in general in the patch notes. Just sound rework of some maps.
---
"Trash Camper" it's called "anchoring", being that one guy that defends the objective. don't be destabilized by this kind of crying people, play the way you want.

Hello. I was wondering: would you take on the challenge, and make a wallpaper? Because that example is really awesome, but i do not need a banner.

If yes, then:

-favourite op.: Mira
---
-colour theme: black/purple (i guess that fits Mira)
---
 \&gt;Most of them look cool to an extent &lt;
---
no, they dont, they all look dumb and stupid.  and a plague outfit would fit in with the rest of the shit. 
---
\&gt; I'm not getting into another argument so here: &lt;
---
dont post subjective as objective then.  
---
i wont happen, i can agree. i just wanted to know why this would any more stupid than the current elites. because it wouldn't. and this leak is just as shit as a plague doc in my opinion.   
---
(i dont care if they bring it,ill just be bloodhound is apex if  i want to be a plague doc so much ü§£ )
---
Then why does black beard shit his pants when facing spooky bitch? I‚Äôm pretty sure a navy seal wouldn‚Äôt break that easily.
---
This isnt a 1 time thing, this happened last week when I also tried to come back, I tried again this week and the same shit all the time.
---
I realize that, that is how I know he is American
---
Why did you stole my aim &gt;:(
---
Not true. They lost to the Ethiopia back when Europe was fighting for the colonization of Africa.
---
It was in the one about Bugs that talked about fixing the sound
---
Mmmmm, even then, I don't think its wise for an experienced player to necessarily teach newer players, my thing has always been you need to learn the game for yourself rather than become a 2nd me if you know what I mean. When I had friends that were new to the game like a year ago I pretty much just let them get to 20 and then immediately hopped in ranked and at the time I was consistently platinum and so that made them play against mid gold to higher golds even as unranked players which I think in the long run helped them learn the game albeit probably at a more dreadful experience in the beginning. I think if someone asks a general question you should answer them but thats just how I think the learning scenario should go, learning for yourself and becoming your own player.
---
Is it cute when you don‚Äôt see her coming and she proceeds to done you with a silenced degle

They‚Äôre separate accounts basically

probably chlorine

What is your NAT type set to?

Nice American thighs
---
In the tts you get all operators by free ( including the new ops)and if it we're for you to buy something there it will stay only in the tts.
---
I had this problem too. Very anoying. I got one-tapped by a Jager through that shield. Sometimes it bugs

What‚Äôs overtech‚Äôed about it? It‚Äôs CRBN hazmat suit with rigid armor panels laid over it.
---
His southern heritage plays into his personality
---
100% based on a rioter.
---
I think this would fit better as a normal uniform with his normal helmet recolored.
---
In the Game settings.ini file it just shows Tilda as the command and no way as far as I can see to change it. You can disable it by putting the value to 0 though.
---
Without a doubt, one of the worst elites in the game. I'm gonna riot.
---
It looks shit, but i still want it.
---
ok thanks for the help
---
Along with this, make several mav holes and then peek the door.  A lot of times, they will be looking at the holes and you can get the drop on them if you generally know where they are.
---
For* sorry i'm  general retard
---
nigga what argument this dude just said people are assholes
---
That is pretty smart thinking
---
I do clip, I do send them it. They still won't get banned.
---
Well...I know, this isn't much of a discussion to question the design and content of the game though or anything like that. Personally, I'm not interested in any camo invisibility thing, it just doesn't seem as fun to me I suppose, although would be more effective than invisible only to cams. 
---
but if we see things realistically, take away all the...game design and game balance thing, Rainbow would probably equip their operators with similar tech :V
---
Slower a little
---

Yeeeeeee haw.

So I assume this will be for halloween? Is it going to be Cowboys vs Natives?

Okay, but his hypothetical welsh heritage could uave played into his personality as well

You forgot to mention the cardboard IV drone yokai placements.

This and the fact that once you get into plat/diamond, you never get to play secure or hostage because people only play bomb in those ranks.
---
Hey buddy, I know I'm late but I recently got unbanned from this subreddit for posting a meme. It caused me to get a 90 day ban. Anyway thank you so much for posting this and tagging me, since the weapons Warden/N√∏kk have are already in the game, I guess I'm going to have to wait and see what's in store for Y4 S3
---
Btw this is an older clip I‚Äôm better now
---
[here is his elite animation](https://twitter.com/obutu3_/status/1130917772345585664). Definitly based on a rioter. 
---
I'm glad I bought his pro-league set. I like this outfit too, but not as an elite. This elite outfit would fit better as an special event outfit, and ubispft missed a lot of oppurtunities for his elite.
---
Oh shit, ive been leaving them open for the past 4 years
---
not necessarily, there are a lot of people who like secure as its just a pointless run-and-gun mechanic. you dont have to worry about who's got defuser and things like that. It's just Breach, Kill, Run into Area, Kill some more. Simple. It doesnt require teamwork. doesn't require lots of knowledge on the game. so It's a New Person's introduction to siege. It's also a Solo Queuer's Dream cus they dont have to struggle with someone hogging the defuser, then spawning where noone can help him, then dying by a roamer. You then have to get the def, then having to run back, then planting.
---
Yeah ig i just play with friends alot i usually play in with 2 or more friends and also on plat 1 diamond level might help to not get tk'd that sucks though dude im sorry
---
Hoes mad
---
knew it looked familiar.
---
I think he looks like Ned Flanders too.
---
It was posted on this sub last night
---
You can't get the same precision, sure. But you can get really fucking good
---
And it makes him look like a space marine
---
There were already videos where game bugged out and operators did the elite animation with the default uniforms/headgears .
---
"I have found youuuuu. Let's TALK. "

Yes, absolutely

ok.... now I am impressed

---
The short Australian laughed.
---
You‚Äôre right, there is no real reason to buy it. So did you ask why I might anyway? Because I want to support the devs so that free loaders like you can continue to have the game supported for years to come. If no one bought the pass, they wouldn‚Äôt come out with more dlc. I rarely play siege anymore, I peaked and got bored. I come back every couple months to check out the new ops and watch pro league when it comes around but that‚Äôs it. So I don‚Äôt need the pass. But I do it to support the game. I also give them my money expecting them to meet their standards set by past seasons. I agree we needed these ops in the game, but the abilities aren‚Äôt really new. So not much work there. Then 100% recycled guns? You‚Äôve gotta be kidding me. Then a remake of a map? It needed it, but half the work is already done, again. So yea, I gave them a full $30 for the season pass. I just don‚Äôt see them giving a full effort back this season.
---
What do you think we should do u/AssEater31 ?
---
You're probably gripping it too tightly, have a weird sens, or bad posture.
---
What a piece of shit to wait this long for
---
This has been in the game since the Outback TTS.
---
Proof:https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/ase8cs/console_panel_added_in_tts/
---
I could see some people being into this. It's a sort of stylish agro punk type of vibe. I wouldn't get it, but if I had it I would probably use it.
---
Fighting games actually have quite huge playerbases. Mortal Kombat, Tekken, Street Fighter, Smash Bros, just to name a few. Hell, even Melee still has a playerbase companies can only dream off.  In comparison to other games they don't really lack fans. For Honor lacks the fans cause it's just not that good of a game, I wouldn't even call it a fighter to be honest.
---
I highly doubt he went to For Honor on his own decision. Either way, I wish him well.
---
It's just ying's default uniform with a few bells and whistles. That isnt good to me, it's just more recycled content.
---
He was what 19 when he signed his contract therefore legally he is an adult so it's up to him to understand what he is signing.
---
She was ok. Not terrible but there were a lot of awkward moments and some cringe stuff. But I‚Äôm sure that will improve with experience
---
I cant remember his name, but if I remember correctly there was a bank robber in Australia (plz correct me if I'm wrong it has been years since I heard of this) back in the day that used homemade body armor in his robberies. One of the pieces was literally a bucket for a helmet.
---
‚ÄúHey man I‚Äôm gonna invite some friends over!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou gonna invite [REDACTED] or nah?‚Äù ‚ÄúI mean I was, know where she is?‚Äù ‚ÄúI think she went to [REDACTED] for the weekend.‚Äù
---
I actually like this elite, it fits with his lore.
---
That was a sick move at 0:11, just the split-second decision to bait to the right was perfect
---
No idea why people are shitting on this but don‚Äôt care about glaz‚Äôs elite
---
New operator Easter egg??
---
In the test server yeah
---
The toxic babes are now axe spray
---
His hair looks so fucking goofy
---
That... Is a good question
---
I have been watching vigil, i was tryna hop on the ledge in case someone come out and save him, and they did. I teabagged because they tried to kick me out when i had a 4k this round(had a kill early in the round) üòï
---
no idea why people are upset over this but not glaz‚Äôs elite
---
That would just turn Kaid into another cancer acog operator.
---
They want balanced game play and a competitive mode that requires teamwork and a tiny bit of strategy. They design the maps around Bomb, the ranked competitive game mode should be based around that. 
---
Secure is just tdm, holding a single room while people run around for frags and I shouldn‚Äôt even need to say anything about hostage. It‚Äôs easy to just destroy barbed wire, ying and start securing. For bomb, you usually have to actually have site control and with montange, lion, glaz, ying, nomad and others, you‚Äôre severely punished if you let them have site. 
---
To me, it‚Äôs easier to play secure and content creators aren‚Äôt exactly pros and either don‚Äôt play with other people or aren‚Äôt serious enough to bother playing bomb
---
I hate his elite, so this is further disappointing.
---
It's a glitch. They wouldn't keep secret a huge buff like that.
---
And they said multiple times that they slowed him down because they don't want him to be able to sprint and kill people while tanking 2 headshots.
---
No..
---
Yep. It is really fun... /s
---
only took about an hour but could've gone even faster than that if i didn't have to run back for ammo.

It‚Äôs a competitive game, you can play casually, but if you‚Äôre not serious enough to play against a good people in ranked then don‚Äôt play ranked.

Well no they aren't kids for a start so it's not Grooming. Also they didn't have to move that was their choice. Also they aren't touching them up or violating them sexually so it still isn't grooming.

I highly doubt they spiked his drink or forced him to drink or Gamble otherwise they would already be in shit over that.

Ubi literally doesn't release new guns with new ops one time in the entire history of Siege and people are bitching.
---
This subreddit is honestly embarrassing. We are getting new combinations (most likely loadouts looking like FMG9-Deagle and Shotgun-SMG12) with some quite powerful operator abilities, a fantastic map rework and some really nice bug and UI fixes, but of course, silver reddit comes in complaining they dont get a new gun to play with.

Suppressors add a bit of disorientation when shooting at someone that isn't expecting to be shot. Compared to non suppressed it may give you a few seconds of time to reposition or think of your next move when getting a pick on defense. The amount of time though, is determined by the skill of the enemy team aswell.

It's a good thing I don't play league or CSGO. I play rainbow6 siege.
---
I love the fact that [REDACTED], you know?
---
He is 36 years old and not 17... i think this is the worst elite and i didnt like Bandit very much either
---
Not bad. Better that Smokes leaked Elite.
---
After 1 year since the last time it happened and the year before that and the year before that\*
---
I remember a while ago there was either a leak saying one of the ops in development would "make defenders think about reinforcing hatches on the same floor as them" (or something very similar). Rappelling indoors would be neat, if very situational.
---
Or the tachanka skin was just for their other gun?
---
I'm talking about in comparison to games like shooters, battle royales, ect. Fighting games keep a decent playerbase, but nothing compared to other games. For Honors issues really stim from it's awful launch, slow balancing (the reason I stopped playing in the long run), and a lack of direction of where that balancing made sense. Fighting games for the most part are balanced for 1v1 fights, but For Honor has duels and 5 4v4 modes (3 of which no one plays) and the balances that make a character bad in 1v1 can make them oppressive in 4v4 modes and vice versa, or they're too strong in every mode.
---
Regardless, I think you're right. He did a lot of great work on siege and ubi probably moved him to try and bring for honor some more long term success and I wish him the best. It's definitely our loss, but the new girl has a lot of potential.

Finally hit my first platinum and this is the charm.

Chalet is horrendously bad and attack sided, with zero viable sites in the current meta. Trophy is *almost* okayish, but still falls flat considering how insanely easy it is to monty your way into Trophy room via stairs.

They took perfection and somehow improved it!
---
give him a hazmat suit.
---
Didn‚Äôt Kapkan‚Äôs pro league have the same skin for this gun?
---
Yes we do. It‚Äôs the most recent
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
Just get a mute on ur team man hahha not that hard to counter twitch on chalet
---
Unless the advantage is crippling than there is no excuse as to why it shouldn‚Äôt be in ranked.
---
Learn to adapt and make the most of the given situation instead of bitching and crying for shit to be removed unless, again, if the advantage cripples the other team badly (aka: Favela for defenders). 
---
You can‚Äôt call yourself a pro siege player if you aren‚Äôt good or great at every aspect of the game. Not everything is gonna be perfectly balanced (bomb isn‚Äôt perfectly balanced either) so using the whole (but it‚Äôs unbalanced) is a moot point unless the advantage, is again, crippling the receiving team.

Lol i know but i was trapped haha no where to go

His victory animation of him ripping one fat bong for 6 whole minutes straight was a bit much, personally.

It‚Äôs sad this is funny smh...racism is still racism even subtly ...it‚Äôs like laughing at someone handicap and saying you didn‚Äôt mean too.... community truly is trash and the mods in this sub are as well
---
Hes not supposed to close up the room. Hes supposed to funnel people and convince them to go other routes.
---
*reported*
---
Best thing about this skin: Look at how goddamn easy to COSPLAY that would be!
---
Honestly, as much as I would have preferred some WWI trench gear with a turn-of-the-century chemical hood to boot, this right here is gonna make my main man Smonk cost less than 600$ to cosplay well. For that, I am happy.

This oddly makes me think Hibana would make a good Mulan.
---
yes i do
---
yet can be helpful for teamwork,nothing is easier than killing an enemy who can't see anything
---
No I like the redesigned album ui better
---
Wait, isn't 3 round rotations where one can go the entire game on only either attack or defense? Won't it be fair if everyone has an equal opportunity to do both?
---
So have you done the push to do the speak
---
At least ban kaid to make it even tho, if it‚Äôs anyone else my OCD will be nettled
---
True. I think we were probably running an Mira/Echo/Lesion/Jager/Bandit. I rarely play Mira so that's why my loadouts are goofy sometimes.
---
Should have added it this season but I guess someone wanted to see it completely full first
---
Sad
---
Stat wise it's the strongest weapon btw
---
Underrated my ass, I hate his armor panels bc all they do is keep me from destroying fuze charges/breach charges, etc on the other side. Also anyone I hear walking around outside the panel I can't do anything about, most useless shit ever.
---
Lol gold rand
---
Ouch, reaaally not feeling this one. The fun of playing smoke is being able to strike fear into the enemy by roaming with a shotgun and catching them off guard, and his mysterious design really adds to the effect. I personally use the hound mask and play like a psycho for massive amounts of fun, but this skin would only serve to hurt that. Not really freaky or cool, just very in-your-face punk. Maybe some people will like this, me personally it's a definite not buy and believe me I've bought some bland elite skins in the past.
---
I'm thinking more of a football hooligan.
---
The uh.... sonic picture
---
I prefer 1080p
---
I mean Finka's Spear was a new gun and everybody stopped using it after they realized the LMG was just better. I guess if you just want something new for a couple weeks then I understand, but personally I care way less about operators' guns than the effect they have on the meta.
---
yes i do but nothing comes out nor can i hear my team  mates when they are speaking
---
Orrrr allow all operators be ban able bc in reality it‚Äôs the right thing to do.
---
So what does it matter if the new ops get banned?
---
Ahh Blackbeard, my favorite operator from black ice
---
Blackbeard black ice
---
I love black ice
---
Are all your wires plugged in correctly?
---
Pretty sure every map has April 14th circled on a calendar. "Max distance" makes me believe it'll be more of a Zipline type deal. Maybe one ammo that can be picked up. Shoot a horizontal lines that covers the outside of an entire floor and all th attackers can use it
---
1. Why doesn't twitch count? Also, going above and shooting the damn denial works too lol. 
---
2. This is literally what everyone said about 3 minute timer in ranked and the ranked map pool. Guess what? The changes ended up being great and made ranked much better. Play the game before saying these changes are "flat out stupid". 
---
3. You're out of your mind if you think the same meta goes on every round. Some Mira setups are default but the vast majority of games and rounds play out very differently from one another. If you think the same ops are banned, the most important factor in pick and ban is the preference of the individual teams which vary team to team.
---
All this complaining about banning the new ops. Get over it. It‚Äôs a feature and they are allowed to do it.
---
No u
---
Right! Or maybe in GR Breakpoint for a post launch op, you learn one of Rainbow got stranded on the island with you and you have to find and save them. Or, since Breakpoint is gonna have a pretty big tech focus, maybe we learn Skrell developed some Division tech like they did Rainbow‚Äôs drones and things like that. It doesn‚Äôt always have to involve team Rainbow, but just make this universe more interconnected.
---
agreed
---
That mf really be starin üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
Dude nobody cares.
---
I need the link to that
---
Yup probably getting it next season
---
What is ts
---
This is why no one takes this sub seriously
---
It‚Äôs actually not because people payed to use them exclusively for a week. Balance wise it would be the ‚Äúright thing to do‚Äù if they were op, but there not. And even if they were op it still shouldn‚Äôt be a thing cuz people spent money on it.
---
You don‚Äôt have to play ranked secure area. That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand.  This change does not impact bomb players at all. I‚Äôve played this game on and off since the game has come out. I really only play secure area. How is it fair that I have to get thrown into a whole another game mode I‚Äôm not used to. Makes no sense. ‚ÄúYou can play casual.‚Äù Casual is terrible and people fuck around too much. I really do not understand how people can be for this.
---
you tell me, why do some guys want to be girls or the other way around
---
It is like in pro league you can go to match point on one side.
---
Missed opportunity for May the fourth
---
25,000 renown or $5 each
---
He's 36 in game. The game updates the age in real time. He was born in 1983 so I don't think the website updated his birthday.
---
Sure all art is welcome...buuut... You should probaly look with someone with more power
