Stop playing Wood 4s, "playing a dead body" you literally got spotted on cam at the beginning of the clip so any common sense team would still see the Blitz logo on their UI

Also great wallpaper!

It‚Äôs not that hard to finish that challenge.. I‚Äôm not amazing at the game and finished it in like 4 hours. 
---
Also think about it. Kaid, clash, nomad, possibly gridlock, the new ops, all nerfed, because people didn‚Äôt want to adapt. 
---
Makes it even harder when someone steals Bandit in like 2 seconds so rip using the barbed wire and bandit combo for destroying drones.
---
yea this is why I hate these challenges because people will be toxic just because. I had to grind all day on the first day to complete the challenge 
---
No cross platform.

Love this. Give me more silliness.

You do realise what you get if you complete it right?

Take notes Ubisoft

Turbo controllers aren't anything like mnk retard

I'm gonna keep going, I guess. Just... Very frustrating.
---
do you really think this is reddit worthy
---
Its easier to run around with a russian shotty
---
Hahaha thank you thank you
---
Alright that's fine
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs not a challenge. It‚Äôs just fucking annoying. I want a challenge to get the prize, not complete a chore.
---
Contact ubi then I guess?
---
It‚Äôs not hard, just extremely tedious
---
No. Absolutely not.
---
But I do like to think to myself it being only a slight bit above all the reposts and memes.
---
Lol IQ needs better guns lol
---
2 great guns, great gadget, great utility with smokes and a secondary shotty. What are you missing?

So creative, I absolutely love your ideas! Keep up the great work!

Why don‚Äôt you ask the people that are in your actual game instead of dudes on Reddit?
---
Thank you very much mate you have a nice day 
---
What's off? Too low?
---
Skilled operator
---
I thought max was 140%?
---
Nothing better than seeing that one retard that's diamond that literally has no brain and has the name "keyboard smurf" and forgets how to do anything beyond "point and shoot." Yeah guys, that's the guy we should be promoting. Because this game is Call of Duty and using a mouse and keyboard is just "using your resources to your maximum potential" even though it shouldn't be possible and is considered cheating. 
---
How do people defend this stupid shit. As someone who plays on both platforms, I can easily say that if I were to buy a XIM and use mouse and keyboard on console I can almost guarantee I would hit diamond by the end of this month.
---
This is a game where any gun does less damage then a single knife or a hit from a shield. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs time to question realism. 
---
Do you have a source for this? And is the change pretty much 100% coming? 
---
Thatcher doesn‚Äôt suck, but you might be utter trash with him and that could be swaying your opinion.

Didn't know about it being posted on another R6 Reddit, I saw it on twitter and found it funny.

I had a friend try M&amp;KB, and he went from Gold 4 to Plat 2 in 2 weeks. But he started running into lobbies with nothing but M&amp;KB users
---
No I know. But i think it would be pretty cool. Plus its annoying when a Thatcher can throw one thing and break all of your needles I pretty good balancing as well
---
What‚Äôs wrong with that. Similar to most other often played ops like Hibana, Jackal, Zofia etc. Difference is she‚Äôs slow and has a gadget that is only strong with the coverage it has, not because the trax themselves are actually good

Communication, a squad of people you know, and lack of distraction. Other than raw skill, these will help.

I play Ying mostly for her weapon because I think her gadget is kinda too strong most of the time (case in point I have dozens of clips of me messing around and doing this to people), so balancing her gadget wont hurt her.

There's no way Ubisoft knows if that was a mistake or toxic behavior, maybe next time you'll choose better your weapons or practice a little more before a match

Ubi fix this shit plz
---
Ubisoft has made a statememt that they cannot do anything about it, the console maker will have to step in.
---
I‚Äôd say Kap then
---
Yes. Casual is play hard and warm up or get better at multi, and when you feel like you‚Äôre ready to play your best and try to win no matter what you play ranked. I had a lot of fun trying in casual, went to ranked and lost, felt like I wasn‚Äôt in the vibe to go off. Casual is not custom game and is for ranked without the pressure

Mute on Skyscraper work office, Kap or Echo for the other areas.

That means someone went out of their way to report you, and probably had friends do it too. I believe the avatar stuff is totally automated and report based, not likely that support will tell you why it was removed.

I thought it was more of a reference to goblin slayer

Can someone turn this into a skin concept? Like a cracked and rusted helmet with one red glowing eye, and a gray and torn outfit? He‚Äôd give like a ‚Äúghost of the battlefield‚Äù sort of vibe... that‚Äôd be dope.

I hate Ranked. I'm never prepared for it. I don't want to bother my friends because I'm scared they'll hate me for asking constantly to play Seige. I'm just having a shit day as well. Like I had too much nicotine so now my body is kinda in a slump

"Instant" only happens during a kill replay or an end of round replay. It never happens in the actual game.
---
I disagree because you‚Äôre still countering gadgets in the hopes that it helps your team though. I also disagree with the downplay of shooting. Gun play is still how like 90% of kills happen. From the very beginning, gadgets have separated this game from other shooters. If you want to see less gadgets, play CS:GO. That game is way more routine and bland because its been nearly the same throughout most of its existence. All you have are grenades and aim. Gadgets are tactical tools, even if the ones in R6 lean towards fiction. They keep the game from becoming the same setup each match.

Glitched killcam. Basically youre seeing where you thought you were but in reality, they (or the echo in this case) can see you. It happens a lot with shield operators where youre sort of in two different dimensions at one time. All you gotta know is that they saw you and the killcam isnt showing that properly.
---
Have you solved this problem? If yes, I will like to know how. Thank you.
---
Ditto on these three. They're more on the meme side of things. Always great to watch though

I got this and BB's charm from the second one which took about three to four hours (possibly longer) of doing noting but grinding out drone kills.

I think currently tho, with a singular red eye with the trail it‚Äôs safe to assume it was inspired by goblin slayer because it‚Äôs more topical than terminator or megaman x

Ive seen someone else post about this but they also said after a few days it didnt work anymore or something. Would be great if you didnt need ps plus for it. Tell me if it changes!
---
You should try it!!
---
The game is hella fun, with a lot of personality and hours and hours and hours of content.
---
I highly recommend it cause it was my first PC game I took back in the day, and still feels pretty fresh at this time.
---
And remember, multi-player games are fun for a while, but a single player can heal the burning of having bad times with random people. 
---
I‚Äôm a nub which weapon class do you recommend. Watched some videos I really don‚Äôt like the hunting horn but apparently it‚Äôs quite useful? Maybe bowguns?
---
or maybe an idea for a new operator?

Did the same. That bear deserved it.

Or the shield is inside of his body.
---
Not the siege Nomad?
---
I guess all weapons have their own skill levels.
---
But one good friend told me to try the sword and the shield, cause you can fight while you heal and still have some really cool combos, like making the shield and the sword into a full badass axe.
---
If you are new, don't worry, keep hunting, get good recipes, create good shit, and if you want to go more deeper, find some builds.

I like this idea as long as if that person comes back they don't have any reinforcements. I know sometimes in Ranked if a random leaves the game (which they usually do) my team decides to do a different objective than what we normally choose based on lack of reinforcements.
---
Here before it's trending. 
---
I love your art &lt;3

Looks amazing!

They really fucked up the clipping in the game in the latest update.

I agree but the new CSGO menu does look clean

Wow! Thank you so much!
---
Report toxic behaviour 
---
No. just no. As I was reading your post, my first impression is, that you lost games and your excuse is that your team has no communication. If you play well enough, having communication is only needed in platinum levels, and people do communicate there. 
---
Okay this but unironically 
---
Good job!

I have a clip laying around somewhere of be shooting at a doc, potatoing miserably, like shooting knee level 3 feet to the right miserable, and it counted as a head shot

A lot of the earlier guns have shit accuracy. The guns have different stats because it's a loot shooter and you've gotta feel some progression when getting better guns. Doesn't take long to find some guns with decent accuracy. Just gotta watch the stats.

And I'm really sorry that you have to deal with that. Seriously. You are probably better than most of the players that you are lobbied up with but they just disregard you because you are younger. It really sucks and I hope something can be done about it one day.

Does anyone else have little lagspikes since this update? I had 0 problems before that and now I have Lag spikes to 120MS (from a mild 39/40) every 20-30 seconds. I can¬¥t play like this. It is def. not on my connection end because everything runs 100% fine in other games.

And yet if I hit them on the chin it doesnt count as a headshot.

Considering I'm generally playing in platinum and there are consistently no comms says otherwise. And I'm not saying that teammates that don't talk are the sole reason we sometimes lose. Overall I win more games than I lose but it's just frustrating that it's 2019 and a large chunk of people still don't have a microphone of some sort.
---
so mostly the bigger maps is what you struggle with. i think you have more time in a game than you realise. in attack, pick one place where you will always spawn and get used to countering the runouts in that area. you can take a whole minute from spawn to enter the building, then spend another 2 minutes making your way to OBJ, droning, and reacting to opponents you find, then last 30 seconds is for planting the defuser or securing the area.
---
when defending large maps you have the advantage of opponents having to come to you, and keeping Echo drones just outside the OBJ will give you intel on where people are and when the push is coming. react to that when you think you can get the kill, or stay alive if you cant and the less time the opponents have the more problematic you will be to deal with.
---
Go look up the definition for indisputable 
---
That's nice.  Any legitimate guidance?
---
this is basically siege experience in a nutshell

i Wish the color of the goggles was the color of the recruit

Because your client does not know what the other guy sees. And you only see their perspective, as understood by your client. The only one who knows what both players see is the server.

Indisputable evidence means they literally watched you cheat.  
---
Obviously you have an unhealthy obsession with this game. You cheated. You got caught. Get over it. 
---
Mmm pop art

A sight is calibrated for a certain distance (and a certain wind). Most commonly you will calibrate (or zero, as its usually called) for 200m, wich means that the bullet will travel in an arc and hit right in the middle of the sight 200m away. By chance, that also means you zero for 50m, since the bullet travels from below the sight and upwards, and hit zero at 50m. Then it reach the apex somewhere between 50 and 200m, before travelling downwards and crosses zero 200m from you.
---
Most proper scopes also has helping lines in order to aim at points closer or further away from the zero. So, if you zero for 200m, but is going to shoot at something really far away, you will have to aim much higher. If you then have a line in the scope that corresponds to how far away you are going to shoot, you are able to use that other line as a temporary zero point. Otherwhise, you just have to aim high.
---
Also, if you zero for a long distance, but suddenly have to fight at close range, you will have to aim low in order to shoot straight ahead.
---
Bullets that travel instantly and in a straight line (as they do in both Siege, and in a lot of other games), are one of the things that makes Siege in no way realistic.

Yep, compared to CSGO Siege's MM is absolutely shocking. Plat 3 and I'm regularly seeing silvers and below alongside diamonds in the same game. CSGO on the other hand is a very consistent range between DMG-LEM, with the occasional MGE or supreme making an appearance.
---
It wasn't 2 v 5 though, you can tell by looking at total kills and deaths.
---
Good riddance

I agree

No no, you don't have to restart. It's just a ban for custom prof pics meaning you have to use the default ones. But well to be honest it's still not very nice to get :/

Completely agree, and I think you should lose less elo if you win some rounds in the game or someone leaves on the first two rounds and you lose. Reason I say first two is because it‚Äôll stop one guy sacrificing the game and going onto a second acc to save the others‚Äôs Elo.

Even though the r4c has fast ads times, it still can't compete with an angled grip, and in cqc, that angled grip is the key to winning fast paced fights.

I agree with the other guy, I prefer just a webcam. As soon as you start adding anything else it starts looking unnecessarily cluttered and unprofessional IMO. As soon as I see anything more than just the webcam and maybe a top dono right beneath it, it makes me think the streamer is new and not experienced because all the big streamers I watch have minimal to no HUD type elements

I'm having this issue as well, and I didn't even buy any of the weapon-specific skins for the new ops, just the universal ones. Can't find em anywhere, they're not in the library and even if I go thru the store to get em they're not there (All available skins owned) Sadface :(

For the mean time set Siege setting Squad Privacy "open" then your friends can just click your name in overlay and press "Join the game".

It‚Äôs just a killcam glitch, how did this get 5k upvotes I could have hundreds of clips like this Jesus

I've been saying this for years. It makes total sense for the match score to affect MMR changes. If a match goes to overtime, then clearly the two teams are evenly matched so why make any significant changes to their MMR? It would take longer to rank up and down but that's a good thing.
---
You can start the download, let steam create the directory, then put the uplay data for the game in it to overwrite it, restart steam and let steam do its magic

thanks bruh i was getting the same problem this worked

You obviously feel very strongly towards this, but I‚Äôm afraid to say Ubisoft will never ban people for using keyboards, just like they won‚Äôt ban people with bigger screens or better headsets.

First of all, good job on what you did and they are really good concepts.I would like to ask the question that i asked you two times before and could not get an answer. This operator‚Äôs image really looks like [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/KNibxfa). Is this where you got the inspiration from? Edit: Oh and one more thing, did you get inspiration for the name from Holes (Hector Zeroni) or because its inspiration comes from the first link or just because its cold? I thought so because it has no information and (Hector Zeroni) had no information too. Anyways,i would like to restate that i love it find it very successful. Edit 2: why did you choose the operations name ‚Äúblackout‚Äù? Is there any particular reason or it just came into your mind? Or was it the oxymoron of being both blacked out and flashed by light?
---
Gurrl you look fabulous!

Exactly. Do you actually know anyone from NZ?

Sure, I only said that because if one were to place the reinforcements and the person returns they shouldn't get them. as long as the system can't be abused I think this idea is fine.

I‚Äôm on ps4, and most of the time I‚Äôm in party chat because I don‚Äôt want to hear a bunch of kids that think they‚Äôre diamonds trying to give call outs after they die. Or people are on Instagram or Snapchat watching vids at max volume and I get ear raped. 
---
Whichever one has two face shields.
---
Oh, the instruction manual 
---
But that‚Äôs not how it works normally. You get invited to a party and they either kick you after the game if you don‚Äôt throw up 10+ kills and carry or you get with a bunch of kids which is obviously not what you want. Game chat just changed all of that. It‚Äôs just so much easier and so much better.

Ela's recoil is fine now but I'm assuming you're talking about the initial nerf, no gun should have that dogshit recoil

god damn. when i get real sweaty i sometimes dont do it but like, it gets me killed more than id like for sure. 
---
Looks great, however remove the operators, their icons will suffice. It also keeps the info away from the center of the screen.
---
It's a huge problem
---
Me neither, I was just bored &amp; a small break from my ranked grind was a nice stress relief. 1v1s on Siege are kinda useless &amp; are only asked by children or a 20 year old man-child, scrims between teams are a better test of abilities &amp; skills.
---
ya hate to see it &lt;/3
---
That sucks
---
Yeah I agree that‚Äôs very annoying but sometimes all you need is a general direction or just a Little call to know where someone is or who it is. If they don‚Äôt make good calls or they have music on you can mute them. We don‚Äôt have the little chat box PC has so voice chat is the only way and in a game that‚Äôs so team based id love to see the game chat pop a bit more.

It's a meme because glaz says "details" in his operator video

I just can't support this kinda stuff. You could totally buy a K+M too, so instead of bitching about it being unfair, why not just put yourself on their level?

How anyone can willingly play a shooter like Siege with a fucking controller is beyond me. I don't play on PS4, but if I did I would use a M+K adapter because *fuck* dogshit controllers. I've tried to play Siege on PS4 with controller and it's just plain unfun.

It‚Äôs happening to my keyboard too though. And like I said earlier, this only happens in r6 and if I tab out when it happens everything is back to normal

In what way then? You can‚Äôt simply choose how you want enemies to spawnpeek. Especially since that door is the most common spawnpeek in the game.

In no way. Defenders shouldn‚Äôt be able to spawnpeek. It‚Äôs a cheap way to get kills. 
---
It's because the multiplayer market has never been so bad. Every year a game comes out and I hope it takes me away from Siege, but then it turns out crap. Now I don't play Siege because I've done everything and it's getting a bit meh. Coop games until the next mp letdown.

Oh god. You apparently don't play OTHER Ubisoft games. Ghost recon wildlands is selling ACTUAL WEAPONS TO BE USED IN GAME FOR $10 A PIECE! is this a weapon players pay money for and use IN GAME to get an edge on the HORRIBLE aimbot like AI that's in the game. And the developers ignore the community when they cry out about the bullshit in that game and Ubisoft just ignores it. DUDE nothing your saying is coming from siege it's UBISOFT that is doing. Get the fuck over yourself. You wanna rage about Ubisoft injustice go play ghost recon and look at all the bullshit they have implimented and how they have abused thier fans then come back at me.at tell me is ALL sieges fault GTFO dude your just but hurt and pointing fingers at Ubisoft most popular game.and blaming it on that. When in actuality siege is the ONLY half way decent game to come.out of Ubisoft in a LONG time.
