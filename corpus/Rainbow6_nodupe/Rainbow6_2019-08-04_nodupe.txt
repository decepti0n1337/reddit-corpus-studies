Than why did you respond and downvote?
---
---
---
I think we can all agree that C4 shouldn‚Äôt knock around like a bouncy ball. It seems like the problem isn‚Äôt with shields, but how the counter to shields aren‚Äôt functioning properly.
---
I would argue that it is still a little bit less noticeable than just sprinting and with the ideal timings you only loose 5% speed:
---
I NEVER rush or play ash but I have to say that I really enjoyed my first time doing both lmao.
---
Gadgets
---
I feel like this isn‚Äôt just a spontaneous PSA.
---
Just gotta hope they have unique guns and these two will be awesome!
---
nice job respectable member of society
---
Lol I don‚Äôt think M&amp;K would give these kids any more brain cells then they have now.
---
The menus aren't graphically intensive, So yeah the FPS shoots up really high if you have V-Sync turned off.
---
If i dont do well i play it out and get off right after
---
Tbh I only noticed the bad depth perception in Siege, and I play many FPS games too. But dunno.
---
No, it's on pc also. (I'm plat 2 on xbox and like 3 games away plat 1 on pc)
---
REPOST
---
I'd let her make a woman outta me
---
Yeah, the plats I play with are stupid, and it's only my teammates most of the time
---
Damn he was having a fit because there was no diamond to carry him lol
---
You almost hit Zofia
---
Ah, it seems blitz pulled out the Uni reversed card in your ass. No wonder.
---
It just put a reverse uno card nothing wrong
---
200iq play by blitz
---
Just sent you a friend request
---
RNGesus hates you currently.
---
You did shoot him next round right
---
Also sometimes people who squad up in 4 stacks will kick the fifth player to make it harder on themselves
---
it‚Äôs ladies night
---
How is it a problem? Does he get an unfair advantage over you? No. He just wants operators. Big deal.
---
Was it already posted there or do you think it should go there?
---
woah now pewds lets avoid that bridge
---
Only people possessed by the devil play Lion
---
Sheilds are still broken and they'll stay broken because ubi has no idea how to fix a game.
---
yeah but have you ever been chased by a blitz? that's terrifying
---
Unpopular opinion: counter rush blitz.
---
context?
---
This was In a website
---
I was emailed this I‚Äôm not sure
---
For not fluting?
---
Yep
---
What does fluting mean?
---
Morphine time
---
Ok
---
This is from the Ubisoft club app giving me stats for my account I felt a little proud with the top 20% because I know I am shit
---
99% of the time shields are trash in the current call of duty meta. Especially now that reload canceling fucks the smelly corpse that was once this game's tactical gameplay with shields.
---
Speak of the devil apex is testing a feature where if you are a confirmed cheater you will only play against other cheaters
---
Exactly, once you get longarmed all of a sudden dead in the middle of the room is a great idea haha
---
Clutching. I meant to say clutching
---
It‚Äôs the Sam bot in the Ubisoft Club app. It tells you random facts whenever you login. Apprently i am in the top 8% with 1600 PVP headshots according to the AI.
---
Aight gotcha
---
*clutching. Sorry I typed it too fast
---
after 3 games in a row of solo q having 2 people quit within the first 2 rounds each game, you could say im harboring a lot of salt

Ok...

Thank you!
---
I thought it was something like kill someone with a breaching charge, which one is that called?
---
Had a guy get banned mid-casual match last night. It was amazing.
---
There's always just injure an enemy and then place it next to them blow it up before they move (or if your lucky they'll crawl over it being a decent human being letting you kill them in one of the more humiliating methods of death)... Or you can just give up knowing you'll never get the achievement and this is now your life living with this one regret that shall weigh over you for the rest of it.
---
Its killing someone with a breach charge

He's trying his hacks
---
seen it with pc too, ye
---
It's a lovely drawing, took me a minute to realize what was up with his arm though, but I see it now
---
I'll prefer the latter, thank you kind sir
---
He didn't do any damage. All the damage comes from the Lesion mine that Thermite stepped towards the top of the staircase.
---
good drawing, but why is lion wearing high heels
---
i guess people have been picking blackbeard for a while.
---
I mean, I did report him but as to be expected they dont respond at 2 am on a sunday lol. Probably gonna get banned on monday at latest. 
---
Mark my words: *\[Name\] has been banned by battleye*
---
Not nice &gt;:-(
---
if finka is op why isnt she picked often? She doesn't offer much more than a 5hp pick up and a temp 20 hp boost, which just makes the ops take an extra shot or 2 to kill to the body, if you dont aim for heads.
---
Fitbits
---
Nice.in pro league someone always plays yellow stairs.
---
It‚Äôs also got longer TTK I think, but I guess if that matters depends on your playstyle
---
Wait which one is that? I may have partially confused my self with that
---
I play Blitz all the time, I've been playing him since he was a 1-speed and everyone thought he sucked, and he was good then too.  
---
I think people who complain about it being sooo hard to kill shield ops just need to play 20 rounds as Blitz and see how they die most often... there are plenty of counters, just as you say. 
---
Not to mention the RNG of shield/player-rotation sync, or the fact that what you see from first-person is NOT what the enemy sees... even the slightest difference in elevation gives the defender a huge opportunity to kill you.
---
Lion is shit alone, but if he's used in a coordinated push, he's fucking *terrifying*.
---
The latter means the second option.
---
Humans' worst enemy working with humans
---
I too am wondering this
---
Most of those don‚Äôt work right now because Ubi accidentally made the echo drone 100% invisible. Echo is mega powerful because of that bug.
---
either that or he is trying to improve his casual ranking.
---
Ohhh an uneducated player, lets watch as he tries to rationalize through her 80,000 abilities
---
Add Ela and it would be one hell of a night
---
why does he have a bulge OwO
---
No such number
---
Shit.
---
It's better than what I can do.
---
Interesting. So what sight do you usually use? Holo?
---
Right sorry... Well I believe in you and all that
---
Platform?
---
Holo or reflex
---
Pc
---
All he did was catch it and throw it back
---
I changed it due to peoples criticisms and I think it's better now but tell me if anything else needs to changed
---
Repeal the NFA
---
No, If I'm playing smg11 and trying to control- and you activate mid spray, I'll pull it down into the floor and fail a kill because of it. All the recoil reduction does is fuck over players who bother to learn spray patterns.
---
And if you open the bottom right of that wall facing the office it will allow the person on the stairs to kill anyone trying to plant behind the desk. Way more useful imo than trying to keep someone from repelling through it.
---
She's a D tier operator that is only played in low elo casual and never sees the light of day in competitive. She doesn't actually provide anything worth while to the team and takes away an operator slot that could be replaced with someone actually useful.
---
Bruh what if shields had a health bar. Meaning you could shoot the shields until they‚Äôre bullet ridden and useless but shooting it usually gives your position away and depletes ammo.
---
## bruh üëåüòùü§§üíØüíØ
---
You doubt us mexicans to not practice climbing walls without rappeling irl?
---
Less they meming
---
I never had a problem with them when I play shields it seems like I get shot through it or die through it.
---
Blitz in my opinion isn‚Äôt bad to kill but Monty is annoying.
---
Never really had a problem with shields as long as you have a team that has good communication you should be fine
---
What kind of man used the left arm?
---
They sure as hell aren't that sticky.
---
It changed to orange when mozzy and gridlock came. And cameras are also orange and when hacked they are blue
---
What the fuckkkkk??
---
Frog lady hot
---
Fair
---
Technically acusing someone is different from proving something :v
---
Clash is the most annoying shield op change my mind
---
Siege is a master piece with NO glitches
---
Basically maverick
---
Sadly there's nothing you can do.
---
She's probably useful in low elos, but she drops off insanely hard since basically any other operator provides more for the team.
---
She basically provides a 20hp boost in a meta all about map pressure, she just isn't that useful.
---
Yes :D
---
Counterstrike eliminated CT shields for a reason
---
Ayy, Detroit: Become Human, loved that game.
---
Aqua darkness kazuma and megumin
---
Thank Xbox and the razer turret.
---
Nothing to see here. Pellets were just destroyed before detonation.
---
Living in Ontario as well. Game was working this morning.
---
No one shot them. They detonated that way.
---
Huh... that‚Äôs weird, you might have to wait for the next day but otherwise I‚Äôm quite lost too. :(
---
What a stupid thing to critique
---
This is happening to me on pc.
---
As an example, indeed, those numbers are not uncommon with a majority of the player base, but when everyone is a diamond, do the numbers even matter anymore?
---
Cursed comments 2 seconds after one person uploads it.
---
Recruit, I think
---
you get recruitv
---
Im not that type of people who are like "instagram sucks because they steal everything from reddit" or "putting emojis in the title is suicide on reddit" im just on reddit to kill time im not some big ass fan, so i put emojis as much as i want üòÄüòÅüòÇü§£üòÉüòÑüòÖüòòüòçüòéüòãüòäüòâüòÜüòóüòôüòö‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÇü§óü§©üòèüôÑüò∂üòëüòêü§®ü§îüò£üò•üòÆü§êüòØüò™üò´ Etc...
---
Isnt recruit banned in ranked
---
I got an abandoned penalty because my friend left a custom game
---
Casually goes back to popping the miras
---
Normally, yeah, but I've heard that you get recruit if you have no operators available
---
Oh ok
---
&gt;Even then if you can kill a tm getting interrogated then you should have a sight on the cav. 
---
Bold of you to assume I know how to aim well :')
---
Seems normal what‚Äôs the problem
---
You can‚Äôt stop them all
---
IDF actually
---
Coz pc players have better game sense? Strange logic
---
Kill a Ghast with its own nitro cell
---
IDF actually, but you do have a point
---
Confirmed. coreRoss tested it.
---
Chalet and meme park.
---
Guy got wrecked
---
Honestly, I've been playing Monty and i wish this would happen. I literally had a nitro clip into my shield for sheer fuck you status. Shields are a mixed bag, they work and are great defence at the cost of valuable offence, or they're absolute shit and you got head shot through the shield. Still love my butterfly Monty though :D
---
Before I get told I deserve it for playing Monty, when you're entire team picks rushers to die 30 seconds into the round someone needs to atleast try to plant and win. Cut me some slack for wanting to be a more supportive role in the team based shooter.
---
You have fun playing the game sure but wouldn't the game be even more fun when you wouldn't have these rounds where your encountering M&amp;K scum or getting fucked over by someone abusing the matchmaking?
---
Stuff like that is poisonous for a competitive game.
---
Losing means you dont lose a rank but now you have to win 3, or 5, or even 10 games just to rank up once. And that's not a gross count, if you have a 40%lose rate you might need 14 games just for 1 level.
---
&gt;.
---
I also see the "santa muerte" holding jewelry(skeletal hand) and there is also an eagle from the mexican flag
---
‚ÄúParry this you filthy casual.‚Äù
---
The Ubisoft club app gives daily activities reports and sometimes this stat shows up
---
its just flair of reddit
---
I personally used to main Monty when I played this and the nerf just ruined everything. Let the shields die in peace, they don't need any more nerfs.
---
Blackbeard is now just a Recruit with plastic wrap
---
Maestro or lesion or capitao. What rank r u at. If your a higher rank player (say gold 1+) capitao might be really useful. 
---
Maestro is a really solid operator and isnt banned often. He is very annoying to deal with and has a good kit. 
---
Lesion is banned a lot but has a good weapon and a good gadget. 
---
Capitao has a lotttt of utility. He can do area denial with his firebolts and his smokes are very useful for executes. Lion is also useful for executes but only with a coordinated 5 stack and the other 3 are better options over him for now.
---

bro your gonna miss it like by one if you ever get it it will be a true bruh moment
---
If the community doesn't allow cheaters to play perhaps they won't cheat.
---
Looks great, but I have heard lots of artists have trouble with legs
---
Exactly some of these bronze guys be making my gold ass look sorry
---
Then why do people pay for the charm then?
---
I know on here at one point someone posted a convo he had with ubi and they said the overlay is not bannable. So if they did get banned it might have been for more than just this.
---
Hot damn
---
i got the doge charm ;)
---
Unless you have a teammate extremely ready zofia is a no go,
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nomad is really good at denying a clash from moving foward, just don't fire it directly at her and make sure she cannot shoot it from a doorway if she unshields when you cannot see her.
---
Thatcher definitely forces a clash to back up, but use it right. I see too many thatchers just throw grenades into hallways and near clash and it does nothing ( I wish he could cook it like others so it instantly goes)
---
Yarp.
---
Said no one ever
---
Ok. I just used it in a casual match aaannnd did not like what I saw. Ignorance might be bliss.
---
The only C75 problem is its sight. I will never be able to use it only because of it.
---
:(
---
Imagine thinking Tachanka memes were funny more the six months after release, couldn't be me
---
what? charms are free
---
I don‚Äôt even see how people find this funny plus it‚Äôs labeled as ‚Äúnews‚Äù like cmon
---
Casual is horrible and newcomers is even worse
---
Have they tested it for frag grenades too?
---
Ubisoft went out of creativity
---
they dont have value to you, but they have value to 99% of people playing this game. People buy accounts just for skins for 100s of dollars (i personally havent) so they do hold value
---
Gimme IQ all day every day man

We don't know that it's useless for sure yet. Someone might come up with some new tricks.

I‚Äôve had the game since it came out and I just got the platinum trophy last month because they changed the trophies because who wants to do 100 terrorist hunts and 2500 terrorist kills

Aye let's play xXBigMeech214Xx i act stupid some times I wouldn't call myself funny but if we ever do play ranked I can get serious I'm frickin garbage at the game tho lol
---
Dam you right
---
This.
---
The names Bond....James Bond
---
Why not actually try and play to have fun?
---
hah i love yours
---
Psyched her out, mind games to win
---
Ok but that doesn't mean shield ops should be able to get bullshit one taps.
---
I didn'trealise there were servers on mars
---
The game is a glitchy bugfest garbage, its community's bigger part is trash and the only fun left is to ruin the children's matches *change my mind*

Give me

His name is kirito? Checks out.

Time it takes the reticle to centre after a shot

He‚Äôs practicing for ranked later on lmao.

Because originality
---
It's all in the flick of the wrist
---
Hey its WarOwl
---
Hand
---
Yes it is!
---
Agreeing hes a legend...
---
This is such an annoyance
---
they dont reduce velocity though. usually people use lower velocity rounds for less noise
---
My friend said he literally pushed Into the objective as blitz and kaid threw his nitro cell, it sticks on his shield as he rams it back to kaid, killing them both
---
its good on guns with really low recoil. jager, pulse/castle, etc
---
I got that legendary right after getting the banana skin for valks shotgun
---
Wonder what can be done though? Maybe he has more body protection without loosing speed instead?
---
So you're saying the audience is a bunch of hoes?
---
BUENOS DIOS FUCKBOI
---
How do you fight a shield ?
---
A. Throw a C4 FURTHER behind and activate it
---
B. Run around, flank them and shoot them
---
C. Fight directly like a real player
---
D. *Return to Menu*
---
I‚Äôve been DDOS‚Äôd in casual 4 games in a row
---
I mean he is the r6god
---
You're 10-ply bud
---
It doesn‚Äôt increase the death counter on their stats, and doesn‚Äôt give Cav the kill on her stats, so it makes their K/D better lmao
---
Because they‚Äôre all the same person?! 0.0
---
Still, BB is a pain in the ass for people that pre-aim level head.
---
Imma keep it real, I'd rather suffer hackers on casual and suffer the real deal players on ranked, ANYDAY, at least I can leave with getting Yeeted by ubi
---
It sucks sometime cause at least for Xbox people in platinum and diamond make group posts to carry bronzes and coppers so they can have easy games and rank up easy they need to have a thing like they do in overwatch where you have to be similar mmr like 1000 off of the party leader which would prevent a lot of it
---
Sometimes you cant go through on a breached wall, it throws you back
---
I see your point, so let me present to you: Finka sex nanomachines
---
As it says, but is in casual. I thinks it's because we won both attacking rounds.
---
Are you retarded
---
Oh yeah you right
---
Aren‚Äôt you guys on here complaining about how someone plays? 
---
Maybe a Xim isn‚Äôt why you died, maybe you‚Äôre just shit lmao.
---
I have a life, I have a job which actually bought me the thing you cry about when you get killed lol, maybe try enjoying the game instead of looking for an excuse to dying every game?
---
Nah, all you know how to do is sit behind a monitor and complain, my bad.
---
Anyway, I‚Äôve been replying to this thread for a while, I think we can both agree there are better things to do?
---
I KNOW
---
Shields are only a problem for coppers who can't aim
---
Ah, two female power rangers and a sentient fishing net what I always wanted.

---
Detroit was terrible but at least the memes are fun
---
Yeet
---
Finally a console player that takes the time to upload the file instead of recording it with their Nokia
---
Yup
---
They could at least reduce the recoil very slightly.
---
Best pickup line! Thanks BB &lt;3 ;)
---
Bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh how you gonna call that a clutch on casual maybe if you 1v5 on casual that's a clutch but a 1v1 on casual ain't clutch
---
No problem, also a tip, taking breaks, they‚Äôve done wonders on the shield glitch but I still get frustrated with shots being off or weird and buggy and it‚Äôs nice to step and maybe try different operators or a different game but taking a break when frustrated, a frustrated blitz is an irrational blitz, but yeah so much of blitz is experience his playstyle is split second decisions
---
"the pressure canister you are looking for is no longer available. Please come back later."
---
Can confirm.
---
Drones are green when Attackers using them, Blue when defenders using them, and white when Vigil has his gadget active. 
---
Cameras are blue when used by defenders and green when used by attackers. Idk if N√∏kk ability has the same effect on cams.
---
Big virgin energy
---
And you're proud of killing a bunch of new players. Good job, you impressed nobody.
---
Yes
---
That‚Äôs usually how I play anyway, if I get too frustrated I go play Minecraft or something calming. And as for split second decisions, that‚Äôs usually how I make a lot of decisions for a lot of things
---
Contact ubi support and provide a picture of each operator status page, the kill count and such, so they can verify that you are a mira main for example
---
Wait how i saw this meme scrolled 2 times and the same post came up again
---
If you look reeaally closely, you can see you hit the shoulder/neck instead of the head.
---
r/rareinsults
---
When it was placed it looked like that with the canister, and we shot it to try and fix it
---
At what rank did this shit-show happen?
---
You mean Ann?
---
You seem fit for the operator then, lots of my issues stemmed from being shot through shields and being irrational from those shots, shields are a whole new danger with the fixes out
---
Lmao nice game Ubisoft
---
I feel like it's not described so well
---
Compensator reduces horizontal recoil overall
---
Muzzle break has better first shot recoil, and it reduces vertical recoil
---
Flash hider reduces both but a little worse than the others.
---
Pick whatever you think works best for the gun you use. If you are not sure you can ask people or look it up
---
top right corner
---
Also Ash, Zofia, Hibana and Nomad have grenade launchers as their gadgets and they are all women.
---
Its a ritual to summon the clamore demon, he‚Äôll stop em
---
Wrong
---
Well, I wouldn't say lazy. It would be a pretty rare exception, and it just isn't worth it.
---
But then none of the other attachments are useful either if you have shit aim as well. What?
---
Why do you never lean? I think it'll help you get better! Gl in future rounds :)
---
Bruh this ain't no toy you better behave

We can go back to year 1 where he couldn't. Or even before he got the glass panels. My big boy couldn't even be safe peeking a door, let alone entering the building.
---
As absurd from a realist standpoint as it is, for balance Monty has to have some intense defensive capabilities to make up for his laughable offensive ones. Otherwise he's not even really going to be situational (like he is now) he's just bad.

Yo this got me hard

Imagine being that elitist, grow up man.

Her HEL Presence gives her sound reduction for players and cameras while she's walking or crouched. She loses it while she sprints, vaults, repels, etc.

Yellow icon is playable.. that's like 50ping, way low enough for gaming. Connection issues aren't really affecting gameplay unless icons are red

Merasmus! I am going to shove my boot up your ass!

Seriously though. I hope all is well and you can continue to stay safe. I was born in Hong Kong but moved to Canada as a toddler. I'm hearing and watching all the crazy things on the news as my parents always have Hong Kong news streaming on the tv. The stuff I'm seeing seems like the situation is fairly volatile and can dangerous pretty quick with a lot of innocent people involved.
---
I think I got shot through a shield 5 or so times playing ranked today. After that last game I deceived that I needed a break
---
Cuz op
---
Honestly, this is how it‚Äôs done. You basically scalded him at the same time as used such a polite tone. This is what I tell my friends to do to avoid comm bans. Well done OP.
---
what do you mean, hes just hooked up his gaming chair with rgb lighting

Could probably work pretty good with hatches, and if there‚Äôs a drone hole or something

Suppressors definitely do not silence the gunshot. It does make it quieter by a fair margin, but even [subsonic suppressed guns can be loud as hell.](https://youtu.be/0fb8CLXll9I) But yes, they don't reduce real world damage/kinetic energy and the barrel extension does have its benefits like the others.
---
you clearly don't know what those icons mean, also yellow ping icon is for 100 ping :)

Im guessing they had to learn to be both handed as a other comment stated you need to be right handed to join Rainbow 6 (Design Choice to make it easier and not to make a extra position for left handed Operators) IIRC.

She needs to miss all her attacks which is more suitable for the shield ops hip fire. Can‚Äôt hip fire with clash
---
I always find the stats for the extended barrel somewhat misleading. The ranges where that extra damage would actually matter, i.e. taking less shots to kill an enemy, practically dont exist in the game, almost all engagements are very close quarter. 
---
It is better than nothing, but if you can choose any other attachment (maybe with the exception of the silencer, Im not a fan of that) dont take the extended barrel.

I might be wrong cause I'm pretty much a new player myself but I think it goes from left to right: suppresor, flash hider, compensator, muzzle break, extended barrel

Wake me up if u fix glitches and bugs lol
---
What? Can you tell me more?
---
Yer, at the moment he‚Äôs kind of irrelevant, any operator with a breach can destroy his ability id even say remove 1 from him so he only has 3 (i think he has 4 Havent picked him in so long) which would make where you deploy his barricades more important.
---
Pick and Ban in ranked
---
Maybe I should play Minecraft and make friends with water sheep.
---
Haha that seems to be too true and how people act in the game also.
---
Considering they are the most elite counter-terrorist operators in the world, I would imagine that learning to be ambidextrous would be a piece of cake compared to anything else they have to go through.
---
I've seen frag grenades and cluster charges destroy them too, so be careful with those things
---
True, but if they commit a bit of money, they can do it I feel. They've made more money in June than they have in any other month before. If they don't even attempt to do it, I feel it would be out of it not being marketable enough or it wouldn't have enough scope to make money from immediately, but it would increase the game's playerbase and lifespan drastically.
---
His shots were on point what do you mean?
---
Getting a 1080p monitor is not something I would describe as wasting money if you a 1360x768 monitor. Obviously this only makes sense if your hardware can handle it. As for your other questions I don't now if there is an option for this
---
Impossible. - Thatcher
---
GU mine is perfectly fine. Consider the fact that is straight in her face (there is little bump behind her, that allows it to roll right in front of camera) and only object it looks disproportional to are once again legs and gun (which do not exist in the world at all). There is no way in FPS to render it otherwise unless you'd want to see your actual 3d model from face position, but as was proven by games that tried this...it's ugly and only works in games where nobody will see you from the side, so you can do animations with more feedback.

---
God it looks so fucking real!

Don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve been frustrated about that.

watch Coconut brah‚Äôs video on maestro spots

They didn't want to make the skin show every bullet

Yeah this gun is like 40ish years old it even has a shell extractor, i'll post a video here showing how the gun works if people want proof that it's just a toy
---
It's the same guy, he got into my second game too
---
Same, lol
---
For anyone wondering, that recoil chart that is shown when selecting attachments is actually very useful and accurate
---
It's like the only 1 in-game chart in any first person shooter that gives you a good example of how a gun / attachment performs
---
There is no way to leverage a higher ping. Having a higher ping when peeking another player, even if you prefire, has absolutely no impact on the encounter. Not with 10 ping, not with 10000 ping. The ping of the person peeking cannot affect a fight.
---
what rank are you?
---
Solo que is shit in higher ranks I recommend using something like moot so find a good team to play with when your friends are offline
---
wow well played
---
this is requiem
---
I see this as an absolute win!
---
you understand that bo4 has a different engine?
---
they are 2 complete different operators
---
Compensator is the one next to the extended barrel i think?
---
10/10
---
Very good to know. Thank you for sharing this!
---
Well the people that don‚Äôt play well with certain operators literally put themselves in a box and just stay there and that‚Äôs why they won‚Äôt progress. A game with 50 operators and 20 maps with 3 game modes and some players ‚Äúmain‚Äù is just sad. It‚Äôs the equivalent of playing a fighting game and only ever playing one character.
---
I know, that's the reason I didn't ask who is better, and asked who is more appropriate...
---
ubi live support should help you they cool
---
I would suggest maybe try taking a week off, or just try playing support ops and try not to focus on kills. Itll come back to you

This is actually, really cool, you could make a really tight looking hole here.

Same thing has happened to me before, not sure what causes this.
---
I'm confused. Bandit is a defender and defenders place down walls. Why would a defender place down a rubber wall so bandit couldn't electrify? Or if you think they should be an attacker, why would an attacker want to do anything with a wall? To make this work, they would have to turn a reinforced wall into a rubber one which would require Harry Potter to become an operator in siege.
---
R.E.D ! MOUNTED AND READY
---
New players go by the recoil chart,see the compensator and slap it on every classü§£
---
Are you deaf?
---
Prob just annoyed from dying,
---
also if you are not already interrogating them it works. (still why do this, you don't get anything from the match and who cares if you lose rather then leave?)
---
I think the obvious conclusion is they are leaving because annoyed, not because they want to annoy you.

its the cpu. its holding you back
---
I have this issue on xbox but just with head shots
---
Some actions an player do, change the hitbox, of the player, when a player goes from standing up to prone, the hitbox just snaps to prone, and doesn't do an animation like your character does.
---
So when you see a enemy do a sudden movement like quickpeeking, the hitbox immediately goes to a peeking hitbox, while you are still shooting at the empty enemy character.
---
Hopefully I helped and explained it properly
---
Nobody knows. In my imagination it would be rather easy to do that.
---
Just make it a double tap to knife/sprint outside of ads.
---
Well, it used to be so that when you left the game, Cav didnt get interrogation at all. Guess these people don't know it was changed.
---
Obviosly an attacker first off, second you don't turn the fucking wall into rubber, im saying they place it like a reinforced wall that can not be affected by wall traps. You're trying to read between the lines too hard. It's just an idea, I'm not a dev so it's not like I have a say in the making of operators.
---
you must be good at parties.
---
What does the smaller diamond thing mean?
---
meh, its fine

they are both important, depending on the map and playstyle. you can't just say which is more appropriate

Suppressor is not -15% dmg, tons of guns have way more damage reduction than just 15%, he even verified himself on his testing.

It's 2 different accounts for sure. Capital i lower case L. Just queues at the same time.
---
Fair enough what is it a gun those guys use in real life
---
Twice this season for me in plat 3
---
I play 1 game a week and got top 12%. So i thought it was kinda weird.
---
It's all preference. 83 is the closest you'll get to have a 1:1 sensitivity. I personally always play best on 400dpi 17 17 76. Every time I try to switch my sens to something 1:1, even after weeks of trying to get used to it, I play awful. Again, it's all preference.
---
I hate how video games make suppressors look like they hurt weapon performance when in actuality they increase bullet velocity and reduce recoil.
---
Gimme your feet
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure if this is still accurate, because I was looking into this around Black Ops 2 era. Part of it was limitations set by the consoles themselves I guess, but another part was that IT MIGHT give some players an advantage with the scuff controllers and such. 
---
Again, not sure if that‚Äôs still credible but that‚Äôs I what found when looking into it.
---
I play on console yet I still report players for 'hacking', even tho its impossible
---
This sludge just killed your ace
---
OP has it stopped for you? I checked today and I‚Äôm all good
---
Can you not read or is that just the stupid mans term of trying to convey "i dont understand anything simple". Just because you can play the game on 1903 does not mean the thousands of others now magically can too. it is a big issue for 1903 as Battleeye is not udated for it yet, so maybe either do some research or just be quiet - even if you can nobody gives a shit that you can - its not helping.
---
Someone already explained the diamond thing. What is centering time in practical terms?
---
Dude rainbow is a horror game
---
Lesions is like a must have in a ranked game but the problem with that is that he gets banned like 50% of the time and hes also fun to play, but if you dont want him then I would go with dokkaebi
---
Honestly though the Muzzle break feels like it does a better job across the board on almost every gun still. Even on long sprays it seems to handle better than the comp.
---
I would chalk it up to client lag, you had a slower connection and that caused you to think you were fully in, but on his screen you were still vaulting. 
---
Sorry, I don‚Äôt know if this helps, I‚Äôm just quickly trying to help people before work lol

That's a chance you take when you spray in random places
---
there‚Äôs plenty of good players without mnk on console including gold plat and diamond
---
why you so tilted haha, if she's that good, why don't i see her? Why is her pickrate that low? and if she has all those abilities that are somehow overpowered (despite lasting a mere 10 seconds) not making her banned all the time?
---
I agree with this but I think that instead of using the defender you just use the gun sorta like the recruit just with all the guns from all the ops you own (including DLC operators)
---
 Congrats. I‚Äôm going for the same next season. I‚Äôd do it this season but I‚Äôm stuck in gold and only getting 15 elo

I'm not tilted? Like at all, I'm actually packing right now listening to music, and why are people in copper? Because they're bad, and like you don't know how to play the game :)

The res is what i was expecting

i‚Äôm plat2 too &amp; i think the matchmaking is just based on people who are just online

Good luck :)
---
I also like the suppressor on jackals rifle ( not that I ever get to use him anymore) but its good for silently taking out cameras when you're hunting and his rifle is powerful enough that the damage reduction isn't to noticeable
---
Compensator everything
---
The more ranked games you play, the less ELO you gain/lose for a win or a loss. It‚Äôs how it works and it‚Äôs always been like this.
---
Centering time?
---
Yes and no. The picture is old.
---
Without a silencer the first shot of the weapon (and every penetrative shot) has a trail, while with the silencer every shot has a trail in any occasion, but less visible

---
Are you making a joke? I can't tell. Year 1 Season 4 was red crow

And im saying that even then there are other factors besides bullet speed that affect the quality of suppression.

Lucky man. I‚Äôve gotten only 1 black ice after playing this game for a long ass time and it‚Äôs not even for an operator I use üòÇ

First, hz have nothing to do with FPS. Then, it's more of a common thing on other ubi's subrredit For Honor, where console players get f**d due to them having 30 fps and 90 was chosen as a number for entire joke to work. You are way overthinking this.

Good clutch, especially since this is on console where it's hard to aim and react as well as you did, but what the hell was the enemy team doing? After the first 2 died they should have stopped peeking and retreated to a place where they can hold the bomb safely, and monty could have salvaged the round but instead was just completely braindead and tried to win a gunfight up close with a pistol. Still an impressive clutch however, a 1v5 is hard to win.

Justify your claim and I'll accept. But until then, it is the only clear indication we have of the inclination of a map to a particular side, so the point stands that it isn't meaningless.

The kids that complain about not being able to afford mouse and keyboard are the same kids walking around with ¬£500+ phones

Just because you can find one really cheap doesn't mean you can afford it. Some people have bills to pay and family to support. Consoles are ment to be played with a controller if you really want to use M&amp;K then buy a PC.

*meaty*. *lard*. That got me good
---
I play with console + wireshark!
---
I mean, only like 5% of ranked players are above gold 1. If you include people who dont even play ranked (which is most people) its probably under 1%.
---
Sure it sucks if you encounter it but like 99% of players never will.
---
That‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs the only hard part about trying to figure out a solution to people rage quitting ranked.

If had all 5 P9 operators I could just snap my fingers and they would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.

Yep!
---
But not everyone can afford a pc plus if the have ps plus and what every the Xbox version that should be able to get one eventually but in your opinion should that find a good anti adapter system
---
Then buy a PC.

No explanation required. Others are making the claim that high ping somehow gives an advantage even though basic logic dictates that it does not. The ones making the claim need to provide the explanation.

Just putting it in your terms. Win or loss is a literal waste of time because video games exist to waste time.
---
And yes I'm d4 in league. In the late game, it takes the reverse momentum of stealing just a couple team fights to turn a game around. Not rare at all unless you have idiots surrendering as soon as they lose lane.
---
0%
---
like I said its casual. they are not gonna bother with mmrs in casual. its not like rank is any better at match making but still.
---
if u wanna pick defender position and play with official rules, that's what ranked is for and I dont see ubi adding a that feature in to casual.
---
I guess league of legends has draft normal but its ubi. ubi will always be ubi :(
---
There is no way to but some people play on consoles for the fact they can't use M&amp;K so adding M&amp;K support would make the game unplayable for those that can't use it.

I think it's automatic/habit. I just try and tell people how easy he is to counter: remember where you were, and don't go looking for him. It's harder and scarier for him to come find you than vice versa.

did it ever occur to you that some people like using controller and play console because they enjoy using controller? why should everyone on console have to switch to MnK just to stay competitive. adapters match people against controller users. that‚Äôs the useful thing they add
---
If for some people money is really that tight that they can‚Äôt afford ¬£25 on a mouse and keyboard bundle, maybe they should not spend ¬£300 on a console, ¬£40 on a game and ¬£50 a year for a paid online service.

Read this, it would reduce the number of keyboard and mouse user but a considerable amount. https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bmguvw/this_is_how_you_minimise_keyword_minimise/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

there is absolutely 0 aim assist in ranked and casual only in t hunt can you use aim assist

Actually no, it Wouldn‚Äôt make him OP cause everyone would know it was him, it would probably actually be used as either a flanking or cutting off mechanic

Why not? just curious

Mate this is against sub rules. It'll get taken down.

Any idea when it was released
---
A minute into the round and all of my team except me and my buddy has died. They vote to kick me and my friend denies it. Less then a minute later I kill all 5 enemies to clutch up the round. Lesson: Have faith.

I second this
---
Here is the fix, make it native just like on PC. No lobby separation. If you feel that using a controller would put you at a disadvantage, then don't use one.
---
Smurfs playing you are just trying to level up as fast as possible so they can support their team in ranked, it‚Äôs not about destroying newcomers to feel good, it‚Äôs about gaining XP as fast as possible. 
---
Unfortunately you are just collateral.

&gt; **bandit** was using a **mira** to trick

Wait what?

Personally I didn‚Äôt mind the map but a rework to bring it back into ranked would be lovely

I third this
---
Multiple seasons ago. It‚Äôs been posted on this sub 1,000 times
---
If you search ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù you can see that someone posted the same skin 23 hours ago

No because there are other ranked maps that need rework and take priority over that sh*t, like chalet, skyscraper, Hereford, fortress, Oregon, etc..
---
FOV:45
---
I can hear the other team screaming at the poor Monty because he happened to die last:(
---
Yeah like he was looking though the mira to know when they placed a charge. Visual instead of sound but it can easily be countered by a twitch, just was cool to see.
---
I just started to play recently, and I preferred newcomer over casual because I got to study these smurfs who were more experienced and knowledgeable about their equipment placements and their strategies. You can‚Äôt learn from your mistakes if you aren‚Äôt punished for them! It makes you think about your approaches more and how you can counter their attacks/defenses.  Also, you learn about the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù counters some heroes have towards another, like Echo being completely immune to Dokkaebi‚Äôs phone calls, etc.
---
a rework is needed, the map can be a lot of fun, it's got great versatility that other maps just don't have, removing it would be a lose to the game but a rework to make it more traversable and easier to read would be great.

Thank you! &lt;3

You got them all right except the first one
---
There really isn't a good motivator for R6 anymore given the type of community that dwells inside it. Knowing that you are going to be met with toxic tryhards and sweaty opponents is a grand turnoff for the game and people looking to play to have fun.
---
U know they r changing it next season right?
---
I'm a clown?
---
Only people who dont know what to do when they get tracked ban jackal but it is more comfortable knowing they cant track you
---
You just have to surrender, you don't watch?
---
Source?
---
It's not hard if there's a defecit in skill, if they're on the same level or better than you; you're pretty screwed. 
---
Thats why he's one of the most common bans in pro league and in regular ranked.
---
so you are saying you can always win a gunfight against 2-3 people while being constantly pinged. If you sit in a corner they will just rush and prefire you.

It's literally impossible to roam with jackal in game. If you get tracked in the beginning of the round it will be you against half of the enemy team who know exactly where you are. Jackal makes clearing roamers ridiculously easy if there's any kind of teamwork happening.
---
It was just me alive they started a kick my friend said no I 1v5 clutch next round they tk me because "I could have saved them from dying:
---
I‚Äôve been playing the game since beta and I just don‚Äôt have any motivation to play anymore. The game was a fun and friendly and chill environment back then but now it‚Äôs just toxic people with console players using MnK and team killing all the time and it‚Äôs just not a fun environment anymore
---
Lol if they kicked you right as you kill the last one.
---
Basically they help reduce recoil for different styles of weapon fire. Flash hider for bursting(3-5 shots at a time), compensator for full auto, and the last one(can‚Äôt remember name) is for semi auto
---
That's not official though, Ubi haven't addressed that this is an issue or should change next season - I think they should
---
lmao i would‚Äôve been so pissed
---
thanks
---
agreed
---
And?

So the first couple shots would be accurate with flash hider than?
---

thanks man

 they bring up the website in the beginning but I‚Äôm not sure what site it is

Damn that's tuff. The trash cans don't like being out-preformed.

people can get downed yes
---
Exactly, longer you fire less accurate it‚Äôll be
---
      I always like to pick rook and give the enemy team t shirts or doc and help them if i got a toxic guy at my team on casual
---
godly.
---
Jackal is NOT OP. if you get tracked as an anchor on site then no one can do shit if u hold ur entrances to site, If u get trakced as a roamer, preaim/fire ate common doorways, and sit still rather than move consistently. Try bait the timer so u dont get wallbanged or floorbanged. I think people need to play more jackal themselves to understand how to counter him
---
There is literally a post on the front page of this sub right now that breaks down this information. https://nw.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cls26y/for_you_newer_players_this_is_what_each_one_does/
---
The muzzle break is for single shots only ( reduces the kick of one bullet)
---
I run it on the sasg too, cause tbh, it just sounds fucking nice
---
They did this after sadly and we were attacking
---
It‚Äôs easy as hell over on Xbox, no need to actually play when you can just DDos the server and win by default!
---
Was joking,why does nobody talk obout outback tho,both of those are trash
---
Imagine getting blown up by not seeing a claymore plantes next to the diffuser, hahaha
---
Did you end up winning the game?
---
yea we did
---
Nah not really shotguns. I‚Äôd say the higher tier players on console (the people that got to plat/diamond legitimately) actually do have good aim and are fun to watch, but the middle/lower tier players are definitely worse than PC players of the same rank
---
Well primaries are more of an opinion cuz it's like the Thatcher L85A2 v AR33 argument. You can do great things with both but it more comes down to personal opinion. As far as secondaries the shotgun is just like the ITA12S. More ppl use it for utility than an actual secondary. And the SDP 9mm isnt really anything special. Just another pistol in the armory.

**AWAKEN MY MASTERS**

Ngl the enemy team is quite similiar to one of the games I recently played. As in I was the silver 1 playing with my plat 1 and plat 3 friends, as well as a gold 3 on our team. No boosting literally just my friends are better at the game than me, I don't play it much so hence why I'm silver 1/gold 4 if I'm having a good day
---
I agree that it is probably less likely at higher ranks but never seeing makes me think it‚Äôs not that bad. I also play on pc and am mostly low gold and have never seen a team like that
---
I dont think so...
---
Damn
---
Thanks so much!!!!!
---
I definitely feel you, the "chck chck chck" noise gets me giddy all the time.

you should only be concerned if it's affecting your real life, like not eating or doing certain chores you have to do

ubisoft: lol its a team game, get a 5 stack

Yeah I'm in the same boat, my 5 stack includes 1 solid gold, me ranging in low bronze/silver/gold alot, 2 silvers and my friend who ranges from copper to silver ü§£. I think most of the time people aren't boosting, just playing with their friends

Is this casual?

Console? You know monty got kicked and they TKd each other after that
---
I immediately thought of a rule that would let you leave without penalty if you get tk‚Äôd twice. I‚Äôm sure that can be abused still
---
WHAT RANK ARE YOU HOW ARE THEY SO BAD AND YOU ARE GODLY LIKE LITERALLY SMITING THEM FOR FUCK SAKE WHY CANT I GET THESE IDIOTS ON THE ENEMY TEAM.
---
Good play though 10/10 would watch again
---
You clearly have no idea what copper is like.
---
You're cherry picking the effects of latency.
---
Latency has two affects, it provides an advantage in terms of movement, and a disadvantage in terms of shooting. In other words a players movements take half his ping before they are registered on the server and then sent to other players. Unfortunately, that player's bullets also take half of his ping to get to the server.
---
So, in your example, a player with 120ms ping peeking a victim with 60ms has a 90ms  advantage in terms of movement. This is the 60ms of delay before the server registers the movement plus the 30ms before the victim received the movement. However, the peeker has a 30ms **disadvantage** in terms of shooting. This is the 60ms disadvantage he has because his bullets take that long to register on the server minus the 30ms it takes the victims bullets to reach the server. When you combine the 90ms **advantage**, and the 30ms **disadvantage**, the peeker is left with a **60 ms advantage**. The formula for peeker's advantage with peeker ping = Pms and victim ping = Vms is always (Pms/2 + Vms/2) - (Pms/2 - Vms/2) .
---
This number is precisely what peeker's advantage is, and it is always exactly equal to **the ping of the victim**. Try it yourself, put any number you want as the peeker's ping, even 10000, the result is always the same. This is why the dev blog clearly states 
---
&gt; However, unlike the common perception, peeker‚Äôs advantage depends only on the speed of the victim‚Äôs connection, not the peeker‚Äôs. 
---
And this is why ultimately a high ping is such a massive **disadvantage**. Because when a player with 60ms gets peeked, they have a 60ms disadvantage. But when a player with 200ms gets peeked, they basically have to react 100% faster to even stand a chance.
---
Mission failed successfully

Not only dumb but also useless

I think if Ubisoft actually rewarded us for playing ranked it would be better for players. you gain more EXP and renown in casual. Then anything else.

It is indeed :)

I love this charm i have it on all my guns
---
MFW i live less than 10 minuets away love R6 and the event is 2 days after my birthday but i dont have enough money to go
---
Everyone get 2000+ ping all of sudden so you cant move but the timer still counts down. we basically cant do anything, easy win for them
---
Yikes, that's toxic. Then again, not like I should expect less from a good chunk of the Siege community. You've already made enough of a fool of yourself, and you're obviously the most stubborn thing on this earth because you're so butthurt. Not worth my time to argue anymore. Have fun stewing in your toxic sludge.

Nice work.

Yeah i know but the other 4 people could‚Äôve just chilled but you know how it is, they all acted like idiots but Monty was last so he gets all the blame lol

I dont get this do people get more xp now?? My girlfriend played 300 hours and she is level 90 i have 1018 hours and im  level 167 gold 1 she is copper 1 and my friends just bought the game like a week ago and they are already level 30
---
Buncha trashcans, it's funny that people are that desperate to win a video game
---
i just got nomad a couple days ago, love playing her. except for her guns. they're both horrible.
---
Honestly
---
How about no?
---
That feature is so annoying. I never surrender. Surrendering is for the weak
---
vigil probably
---
I understand that it's not a huge problem, because she is pretty balanced, but i just think smokes or flashbangs could be replaced for her claymore.
---
It constantly have the lowest ping in my games and I start defender pretty often
---
Happy little accidents :)
---
So basically a fuze and nomad combined? Not op at all
---
What if we used 100% of the brain
---
*screams in reinforced wall besides my mirror*
---
That would be way too overpowered. Not to mention adding lion and ying into the mix. Nothing the defenders could do.

Im guessing people got banned for it?

lmao, Ela isn't even close to being the worst defender in the game. castle, warden, and tachanka are in far worse spots.
---
the scorpion isn't even close to being the worst primary overall, the M12 or AUG A3 are worse
---
it's a pistol, its not supposed to be great. it's bad stats are balanced out by the fact that it's one of the 2 handguns that can equip a sight
---
barbed wire and a deployable shield are literally perfect for her kit, wire works extremely well with her mines

her mines aren't even close to lackluster, I really don't know why you think this. a long-lasting concussive effect is very good

you left out the fact that the FO-12 is probably the best shotgun in the game, that thing shreds
