When halloween event ends
---
---
---
Also twitch has one of the best primaries in the game with the f2 if you really want a good gun
---

---
Zofia is also a good one but i heard alot of people suggest her already
---
Holy shit

GET OUT OF HERE STALKER
---
This is shit, redundant, boring and unoriginal, you know I‚Äôm right
---
its clearly ubisoft itself lmao
---
Just put a drone in... like its a fucking hassle and irritating, but just drone it out. Like the Valley spawn peek on Border, you can literally watch them.
---
You were set up i think.
---
Just disconnect your network on pc
---
This is so cute, please make more!
---
Time for siege 2. Why waste any more time on this mess? Just start from scratch.
---
No ur not that stuff happens all the time. Next time don‚Äôt kill them till they realise. It‚Äôs more fun that way
---
Why would you do that !?
---
Thank you.
---
As cool as it sounds it would be, idk if op is the word but imbalanced, lets look at Chalet Basement. So this op could clog the drone hole, this would stop zofia stun locking the bandit, capitao fire, frag etc. then if the attack manages to pass all that then they get the wall open, it take an minutes 40 but there's time. Boom, wall has been clogged back up and the ash that was sent to apply pressure from behind needs to come back. It could be countered easily yes, but my problem is that it would counter a high skill floor ability of thermite, getting passed all the shit the attack can destroy a thermite charge with but throwing what i can only imagine as an impact nade filled with expanding foam. Which is the lowest skill floor possible
---
Blame them aliens !
---
That works, didnt think about that. Seeing as disconnecting your network on console has the same effect, and i just forgot about that until you mentioned it
---
It happens when you change profiles after you have already logged in.   Just shut the game down then load up with the profile you want.
---
This is cool how did you do it
---
Faster maybe...
---
But there‚Äôs a reason xbox pro league only lasted a year. It just doesn‚Äôt look as good to watch even if everyone is still very skilled (there are many current PC pros who used to compete on Xbox)
---
Just lean left and right at a dance
---
You have a good friend
---
Dang he even got the **Gloves**
---
I do this all the time as a joke, if my drone gets shot and the location isn't found. "I think they might be inside." Or if we all get caught my jammers, "I think they might have a Mute." It's fun.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could enjoy playing against a silent operator. It‚Äôs frustrating gameplay just like how the current meta is to crouch walk around the map as a 3 speed
---
I would buy
---
I took [this](https://s2.gaming-cdn.com/images/products/4891/orig/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege-deluxe-edition-cover.jpg) image and replaced the "Deluxe Edition" part
---
He took operator photos that were already designed, a Siege logo that was already designed, a background that was already designed and put them together.. he may have made the 'Test Server' title.
---
no
---
I thought that was the proposed nerf
---
His health was so low he was already sprouting wings.
---
The stats are the same as the commando 9
---
That spawn peek you have time to react, it‚Äôs an easy kill. I have no problem with that. I literally took one step and was shot in the head. That shouldn‚Äôt happen on any map
---
The p101c is technically a glock if I recall correctly.
---
Okay, thats fine
---
We are the emprahs fureh 
---
We are the angels of deaf
---
Okay. Border same thing, plane, House, etc etc. it‚Äôs gonna happen. Deal with it and move on man.
---
If you used a sensitivity that you were COMFORTABLE with for years would you change it?
---
Return to rainbow, claim your unit
---
It was intentional, toxic people in 3-man groups usually do it when they try to vote kick you, but the 4th guy doesn't do it, so they just get you banned...joy. Once you know, it's super easy to avoid tho
---
But N√∏kk‚Äôs gadget can‚Äôt really be buffed, unless you have an idea
---
Bikinibodhi has lost weight.
---
Warden is looking very young for a 48 year old
---
What a p.o.s.
---
We all know him and Gridlock having fun at home
---
Considering he's a chemistry teacher he'll blow you up with an exothermic. (In real life not in the game)
---
you‚Äôre a god among gods
---
This is the point in which the pornhub intro plays.
---
Na mate that‚Äôs not gonna happen
---
This is almost cursed
---
I am surprised you didn‚Äôt bring the gun. I mean you could have gotten an ace too while at it. You got the looks, skin color, uniform, and motivation.
---
Naw that‚Äôs mozzies gurl
---
How about blue
---
Wholesome
---
Yeah np, tell her she's done a great face job tho
---
Sadly i created monsters , since im the first one :(
---
Quick question: do you also refer to Gridlock as a cow as well? I mean lunch lady was good but I hear her mooing every time I click on her.
---
&gt;Mentions tachanka rework without saying anything substantial
---
Why even bother? This is clearly some BS
---
I'll send her the post and she'll know üòÇ
---
*GLANCE ACTIVATED*
---
Perfection
---
Maybe he just has more motivation...? u/fbi
---
He‚Äôs negatively charged same as girls. They‚Äôre all running away.

**Cosplay Comment Reminder:**
---
Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.
---
"When im around, you dont need toilet paper"- Warden, probably.
---
The Thermite buff we need...
---
Thats it I'm getting me wallet.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch that can happen if they connect at just the right point of the operator select.
---
Couple of small tweaks ‚Äî&gt;
---
- Remove vigil waveform effect off Yokai Drones
---
- Buff the FMG9 to 32 damage (from 30)
---
- Give her Smokes and Frags
---
Instantly a better operator overall. 
---
Other wilder suggestions could be to allow her to pass through and disable traps when walking with her gadget active. Can‚Äôt sprint but you can walk. She then keeps you on your toes
---
r/TopCommentGod
---
yeah
---
where is the cosplay? All I see is a wall... wait...
---
50% have the foam walls.
---
So UK legal?
---
People making such a big deal of a teamkill that dates from months ago , you guys are such snowflakes lmao. And also im only playing for honor , those are old clips
---
Nice lol
---
You've clearly never played CSGO.
---
Yes. But still.
---
On point !
---
As you were running to the car so you could get an angle into objective from spawn?
---
Its a blitz sheild
---
I‚Äôm not like other girls
---
Haha well i figued that
---
To be fair, there‚Äôs been plenty of shootings, it‚Äôs just the media is picky with what gets shown publicly.
---
You made the virgins all flustered.
---
r/im14andthisiswoooosh
---
Is the toy pistol the Chameleon camo?
---
good for you man, im not that good. i haave alright aim but i really lack in game sense
---
What real life weapon. Other than a 1911 would make sense to add?  I‚Äôm curious,  I‚Äôm not a huge gun person but feel like there aren‚Äôt any guns that would make sense to add
---
I get that but I‚Äôm new af so having someone be like he‚Äôs through this doorway would be helpful
---
They only did that with dota 2 didnt they?
---
Tf2 and csgo still run on source and they only use source 2 for their VR titles.
---
people sit in game chat with theyre mic muted and refuse to talk
---
It's gonna be a 6 hr long interrogation
---
I have his permission, I'm sure it will be fine.
---
Yes it is
---
wow this is good
---
lol
---
there kind of is a need tho...
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
Thanks!
---
But then a whole game mechanics redesign would have to happen. Plus, I feel like it‚Äôs an unwritten rule about defenders only using Close to Mid range weapons (minus Rook/Doc MP5 and Vigils Shotty). A High Cal Rifle could work but I think they‚Äôd make it a compact version.
---
So sick!
---
nice, you know i had to do it to em
---
How come?
---
Left Warden fake one. No way he could afford a Rolly like that
---
TFW American media can just pick and choose which mass shooting they want to cover that day.
---
Montreal 1989 had a huge school shooting though.
---
New info: the gadget related to thermite might not be a primary gadget but instead a secondary gadget. Opens a hole in reinforcements. Probably not a big enough hole to vault through.
---
Those are fake. All of the stars are already registered and named. You payed for a piece of paper.
---
Fucking
---
Lol
---
Ohhhh I see
---
We can enjoy things and hate things but we don't always have to be vocal about it. So if you don't enjoy something that doesnt mean everyone shares your sentiment. So i feel that if you haven't got anything constructive or nice to say then you have no reason to voice your opinion to those just trying to enjoy something. Have a good day/night making your music.
---
there has been like 8 in the last few days.
---
Ohhh I see
---
Where do you find this so-called ‚Äùgirlfriend‚Äù ?
---
*cries in corner*
---
You can tell its not a American school cause he doesn't have his gun
---
All that has is that a couple games got delayed, which IMO is a good thing.
---
Depends on which organization is doing the reporting
---
[deleted]
---
They asked for the stl. 25$ is a bit too much if you already have a printer
---
But but but I thought tachanka was the angel from god.
---
Update drivers for display? What GPU are you running?
---
A really big fking purge coming right up.
---
The face of death and fear made manifest
---
if i had a penny for every person that cheated and claimed they werent cheating when they get banned, i would be on the cover of forbes as the richest man on the planet
---
was this uniform a timed exclusive
---
Okay so Im having this issue as well. It closes Razer syanpse, Asus AI suite, as well as origin too.  The screen flashes quickly and the games loads but it shouldnt be doing this. 
---
Im runnning the newest Windows update as of me writing this and the newest Nvidia driver. 441.08
---
So was it the old drivers that fixed it you think or disabling low latency mode??...(I currently have mine set to Ultra)
---
What Nvidia driver are you using?
---
Facepaint really well done. You should one day try getting an entire outfit to wear in addition to that facepaint as well!
---
Im having the EXACT same issue, I have a case open with Ubisoft and am awaiting a fix....
---
Or I could light it on fire and it could be ghost rider lol
---
Undo bandit‚Äôs batteries
---
Public school brother
---
*it‚Äôs our precious*
---
he lookin slick bro
---
Woah, looks a lot better than mine :)
---
Not anymore. Stop bullying our commissioner Gorden.
---
My gf's halloween costume is like johncena.
---
It is in fact a house. Ahaha.
---
You can't see her. Just like i can't see the priest no more?
---
I wonder why this stupid mechanic isn‚Äôt fixed yet in fourth year of Siege.
---
Love it!
---
Oh how the turn tables
---
Lol good try
---
Okay. Then why we are getting Alibi the way she currently works if they could lift some limitations before introducing her into the game? Why we are getting ‚Äúhalf-finished‚Äù concepts in this game?
---
It would attract much more attention, as you say.
---
Ja das wissen wir, es gibt n√§mlich nur EINEN F√úHRER:  und zwar den IMPERATOR DER MENSCHHEIT
---
He wasnt ready!
---
aww damn you right ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
/s means you're saying things sarcastically.
---
felt cute, might blow up a hostage later
---
Yeah it would have worked in his case. Oh I didn't explain that well lol. Well thanks for clarifying, I don't think too hard when I'm tired lol. Have a good rest of the day/night.
---
Wait what there is recoil in siege? Since when?
---
[removed]
---
fuck him.
---
Omg father
---
Razer headset?
---
Atleast ARMA has working bipods and can brace weapons on low walls or the ground.
---
The retarded thing about sieges recoil is they are all special ops they should be able to control the recoil of their gun especialy the GIGN. They litteraly are trained to use every weapon imaginable.
---
Well at least he isn't that bad anymore after becoming a 2 speed. Now he is useful as a roamer
---
Looking fresh Macie.
---
I know he posted a picture of my Caveira look. He got my permission and he posted it a couple hours before mine.
---
Throw a flash into his class and watch him not react as all the other kids scream and panic
---
I did. But she don't care too much so i'm probs gonna live.
---
Psst, red dot good
---
The P90 skin is pretty good....... Shame I'll only use the shotgun and MP5.
---
You guys posted this less than 3 hours before this one, why repost?

Quarantine is gonna be something closer to l4d or payday than csgo or siege

My god can you people stop like reddit karma is something important?

"Oh no he is getting internet points call the police"

For real how can people care so much about reddit karma? Instead you guys just focus on the content.
---
You cured my neck, thanks bro.
---
Further proof that Fuze is a traitor.
---
1/10 cosplay. No "GOOSE" sticker on chest.
---
On a real note though, really amazing cosplay. A hell of a lot better than anything I could do. Great job!
---
You should‚Äôve been vigil then you two could make a nokk
---
Yes. But the teammates deliberately got him kicked
---
According to his post earlier he said he did it. That's what I was going off of.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dptiao/i_bought_a_star_and_named_it_bosgacog/

No it‚Äôs not i bought it and regretted it immedietly

Just embrace it and become one of us.

---
COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE
---
They are making fun of how old he is
---
But what if the leak is wrong and the one with the sniper rifle is with year 5
---
A tip is to not main warden. His gadget isn't used most of the time and is very situational. If you like his guns then Valkyrie is a really good information operator (she has the mpx like warden does) otherwise smoke/mute has the same shotgun who are both better than warden in most situations, for plant denial or information denial, but that's all just my opinion, so use it however you like
---
Cav is easy if you are droning properly. I hate clash though, shes really infuriating to go against when you are soloing.
---
Tep and recruit rush that bitch
---
9 mm is 0.0017895 rods
---
^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)
---
I don‚Äôt agree with that. You need the waveform effect for vigil to be fair and balanced, otherwise he‚Äôd be so infuriating to face, as a 3 speed with good weapons. 
---
I‚Äôd rather them just buff the waveform effect overall. For example, remove the fluctuation in waveform size depending on distance, and replace it with one constant length. This means it‚Äôs much harder for drones to figure out how close you are. You could be 2m away or 15m away and you‚Äôll get the same length. 
---
Also, increase the range to 20m, from 12m. This means he gets more coverage and can actually use his gadget a lot more effectively vertically through several floors and covering a large distance horizontally. 
---
This is how to buff his gadget
---
U N D E R A G E
---
Be real, when you shagged that night, did you let her keep the face paint on? lol
---
I thought the black lines under her nose was snot or some shit, caught me off guard right there
---
Oh wait i thought he asked a question, mb
---
XD
---
Wasn't at hers that night and i do find that rather rude of you to ask.
---
Well it‚Äôs a good job I brought Valkyrie as well! But how do I use her cameras, like do i try to place them outside, inside, high or low?
---
Thanks for the response aswell
---
I still have no idea how to deal with a clash or monte 1v1.
---
9 mm is 1.8639e-06 leagues
---
Neat I usually never deal with him tho every time he is in game he dies 30 seconds into the round from either doc or something else stupid
---
F then

It made my day even more knowing making my day made your day

If we could do a BF4 to PS4 convert (I used to play BF 4 on ps 3 until the new console came out)  meaning you pay for a new copy of the game on a new engine, but get to keep all of your earned operators, uniforms, skins charms, etc., I'd fork it over for a newer version.

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

They can ban for I don‚Äôt give a shit, I‚Äôm fighting for my beliefs

no don't cry :(
---
The moment when thermite eats the wall instead of blowing it up

You look familiar

I'm a PC platinum and jackal is getting banned like any other season.
---
Yeah I live in Texas. I have a buddy who moved back to Australia and he told me to be mozzie
---
Vibe check
---
(mabye) one day I'll understand how to do good cosplay for purim, maybe
---
You mean banned in the same common community that bans Cav because they felt she was Op, and banned blitz for the same reason?
---
Yeah, no, that's not credible data. That's people banning whatever they are too lazy to learn to counter.
---
Isn‚Äôt it a pop filter?
---
Haha america bad shooting haha bad bad
---
I'm a pc platinum and all I see banned is thermite / Thatcher / maverick, you still didn't give me a reason of why the nerf should be a thing.
---
&gt;most banned operator
---
In Ranked? Where people ban Cav, blitz, even "no ban"?
---
Sure.
---
I almost exclusively solo on all four of my accounts and have learned that random are going to be trash dipshit who can't tell the difference between an Ela or a Montage and couldn't hit the broadside of a barn from the inside of the barn. I whole heartedly agree with Echo, Mira, Thatcher, Thermite, etc. but not so much Blackbeard or Twitch.
---
Tried to get a Goose sticker but NOTHING would stick to my vest. I‚Äôm gonna be peeling off hot glue for years

Well it‚Äôs sideways so we‚Äôre have there

How you think that doe is feeling.

If you want I can hook you up with a full list of everything the Spetsnaz operators use. Hit me up on insta @pinambo
---
Shit post
---
People like grapes
---
Hope youre not Irish
---
Which magic hat did you pull out that nonsense from?
---
The game just gave up at the end
---
&gt;Yep. Remember the Tachanka with the Bustersword? Thats me.
---
A living legend
---
Thx
---
thank you a lot, i‚Äôm happy that i made you laugh
---
I've never heard a single good player complaining about jackal, you should read what you write before posting.
---
indeed they have
---
Don't give them that buff idea.
---
Relationship. Goals.
---
I‚Äôve also been wanting since forever
---
If you are playing Ranked, it's pretty much a guarantee you will face against a Twitch every defending round. Her gun is just too good not to bring her. The same is true for Jager. 
---
So banning Twitch forces the opposing team to play a different operator which they might not be as comfortable with. Some people are really good with Twitch but is nowhere near as effective without her.
---
These kinds of bans are really good in my opinion. It weakens the tryhards by taking away their main operators.
---
Please tell me you fucked that girl while she was dressed up as Kav.
---
It's literally a fleshlight attached to his mask
---
Wow he can  shoot the needles now that's great might be a little op but seems like a good buff
---
Okay get the fuck out
---
I think u need to establish a main that you enjoy playing and when you have a main you can decide on a playing style and knowing who to get next will be much easier. The base operators (the ones that cost 1000 renown) all have fairly different styles so I recommend getting all of them first.
---
After that just keep playing the game. If you have friends to play with then 1v1 or 2v2 can be really fun and helpful for practice. 
---
Feel free to ask me for tips on certain characters if you need.
---
My guy she has a carbine scorpion not the smg
---

Interesting, but this is in chimera or somewhere near it. How good is he now?

Yep, thats me being squashed. If you want I can send you a complete gear list for Fuze and the other Spetznas. Just send me a message on insta @pinambo and I‚Äôll set you up with the full list
---
Oh shit srry bro
---
Coastline!
---
He claims to be gold.
---
Shirt isnt tucked
---
She can hack dead defenders' phones, which gives acces to every defender camera.
---
I've since fixed it, but it is too lateüòî
---
Fuze is actually cute in this ngl
---
Not bad.
---
:3 thank you
---
Pulled a sneaky on us
---
Oh. I didn't know that. (I dont have her if you couldn't tell)
---
Dang dude this went so bad so quick. Reddit sucks lol
---
Nice cosplay dude!
---
No problem man
---
Thank you! I share a lot more on insta @pinambo!
---
Shameless selfpromotion
---
:D
---
The blitz guy looks like nazi todd from Breaking Bad
---
Now you know! Well i have had Ying for a long time and just recently i found out you can stick her Candela on soft walls to flash the other side, this game is amazing, i love it!
---
Only some. Just don't scroll down to the bottom, it's messy
---
well obviously
---
After that how do you lose
---
Yeah, I know. It‚Äôs so toxic now.
---
We are only like a month away from the new season, I would keep saving up and wait, and by then you could have enough for like 3 ops.
---
Gridlock is a really good operator, but is not that fun to play
---
r/foundthespawnpeaker
---
Hello BerserkChucky, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dq4bze/r6_tournament_5_pm_on_saturday_nov_2_10_buy_in/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Gridlock is really good for Bomb (ranked especially) the coverage the team stingers provide is great along with smoke grenades and a secondary shotgun. She also has a decent array of primary weapons as well.
---
I don‚Äôt even know what to say.
---
Bad luck. Team didn't seem to have done much either.
---
Hyper is pretty crazy on twitch, no idea if he streams though.
---
I've since fixed it, maybe I post again for more karmaü§î
---
At school that would‚Äôve been a scary day
---
I‚Äôd say Gridlock seems the better option in terms of comparing. Warden even though he got his speed buff, his gadget is now nerfed by that by opacity limit, so he‚Äôs more of a casual run and fun with his shotgun. Amaru works the similar style, as a fun op she isn‚Äôt bad but competitively and ranked overall she isn‚Äôt the play, she‚Äôs more of a run and gun for attackers, I guess the combo of an lmg and smg-11 is alright but she brings nothing to the table in terms of teamwork. Gridlock seems the better option if you‚Äôre a player that wants to improve yourself and learn what the better option cycle of operators are, so I hope this helps your decision.

He at least understands German which puts him so somewhere in Germany, Austria or Switzerland
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôll look him up on YT
---
What rank ?
---
Oh lawd he comin
---
Can‚Äôt you melee her to make her stumble?
---
phillipine standard time is my time zone
---
Sure, bud. I'll wait here for your screenshot showing your 28 kills game. Hmu when you get it. Also, really nice calling strangers idiots, you sure are a sweetheart.
---
I‚Äôm also guessing they‚Äôll only be available on a few operators to give them a slight buff
---
Lol Xbox pleb thinking plat 2 is hard
---
I think I will. I'm very interested in how you did your mask
---
Can confirm, am vibin
---
This is great.
---
i can't help but think that a defender is screaming in the background: INTEROGATIOOOOOOON
---
Take my +1
---
If they couldn't hit you while in it, you could hide somewhere and save all of them and then the attackers have no chance of winning.
---
Not with that aim, you only got those kills because you‚Äôre playing coppers
---
You're just invisible and fast not invincible
---
The mask was a bitch to paint but if you want I can give you some tips for that and show you how i did it
---
Awesome 4k mate!
---
happy cakeday
---
While you are raging in the internet, she might be sucking one or two cocks per minute, you better keep up the guard man, the wave takes the sleeping shrimps

no problem for sure

Well considering Xbox and pc coincide with rank the only difference is recoil because it is way easier to aim using a mouse and keyboard granted it is easier to learn how to use all the buttons on Xbox from the comfort ability then again the Xbox is at a defection with the ability to not lean at the hip I‚Äôd say your point is invalid and when you realize that the ranks use mmr or elo on ps4 Xbox and pc and it takes actual matches against real people to gain or lose elo they are the same from pc to console
---
it happens sometimes i just play bad for weeks its usully because I have something botehring me in my  life
---
Actually that would be a good buff for Castle
---
sorry youre getting all this :/
---
Although not a pro, i would reccomend watching godly. His twitch is twitch.tv/chrisgodly and his youtube is godly.
---
It‚Äôs ok, they‚Äôre only words. They don‚Äôt really mean anything to me. However, it is quite shocking. üòÇ
---
Very clear you're a hit with the ladies go clean your fucking fedora collection you incel fuck.
---
Wait that's illegal
---
OwO
---
It‚Äôs either the same two or three strategies over and over on defense or an easy win for the attackers if the defenders play it like actual hide and seek, unless the attackers really screw up their operator selection.
---
It was fun for like one night.
---
Really dude? Not everyone can afford an entire costume. You have no idea his reasoning.
---
Good costume! And least I can‚Äôt comment on how pale you looked on the Blitz post
---
Exactly!! Who Tf cares about the ITA12 when none will use it at all, the vector/shotty combo is obviously better than two shottys
---
Hey genius, it's not buck. It's Jason Vorhees.
---
I tried restarting but it's still not there, I'll contact them.
---
Ahhhh a fellow man of culture
---
Actually no I play Fraggers and support equally, you also think that support ops shouldn't be played and only Fragher should so you clearly know nothing about the game.
---
And yes you are pathetic I'm glad you can admit it.
---
So why is this nsfw?
---
Alright, best of luck man
---
I always have this skin on

Even then the patatoe is more reliableüòë

 A maintenance will occur on November 1, 2019 from 10:00am EST to 12:30pm EST and might cause disconnections from Ubisoft Club interfaces in and out of Ubisoft games.

imagine ubisoft busting into cheaters houses with blitz
---
What does imo stand for?
---
ITA12L is probably going to be reused on the new S4 or Y5 ops. Since its a prime candidate for reuse.
---
Bro your sensitivity is so slow, I could never lmao.  Also nice aceüëå

how would i copy the link if i posted the clip?

Nobody finds teamkilling actually funny. Except for the team killer themselves.

And the leavers...

Don‚Äôt get me started with those scumbags.

This would be helpful to know before the maintenance.

I would maestro if I were u

---
I relate so much!
---
No problemo üëçüèº
---
This is a really cool photo!
---
I consider this canon to the lore.
---
Disconnect your internet before playing the game, and if im correct, it'll unlock every operator for you to play as on t-hunt
---
Only blonde hair can make it !
---
Doesn‚Äôt even have to be on your team. Could‚Äôve been the enemy
---
Just followed, I needed to see Tachanka cosplays.
---
Goolimar
---
Muzzle brake on all guns.
---
Stay tuned for Unicorn Tachanka within a few months
---
In that case, stop hogging the map. 
---
I haven‚Äôt played it in 2 days of Casual and I really want to.
---
üòÜ
---
Tbh it was more of a quick scope
---
F
---
they're SO cute!
---
Nah I play clear glass the field I usually play at is pretty dark.
---
Thanks tho ;)
---
SMG 11 is better theoretically
---
:3 thank you!
---
Pretty bad clip since this literally happens every game
---
If the monsters are actually scattered and hiding I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôd be the case, I just really want to see a video where the monsters are trying to bunker and a recruit just fills the room with lead
---
Acog on Lewis gun, secondary is ACOG with Bosg
---
Your taking it way to seriously
---
Im just saying
---
Fuze was about to lose nnn but then buck like a bro saved him
---
Yeah im probably taking it. Its a game
---
not at all
---
It‚Äôs a meme
---
First I thought "common? what a *surprise..."* but then this happened
---
What if, hear me out, what if the shield covers the front of the segway?
---
No I bought rainbow through epic games because it was on discount
---
And the fact that it holds 2 slugs
---
Yep vould tell by the exclamation mark and the little wind effect thingy?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a uplay account tied to my epic games
---
So this is great and all but the problem is, it counters only 2 ops, which is kinda underpowered. Cool idea though.
---
Spicy? I kinda like the darker uniforms even back then when I bought a couple for some ops, like Buck back in the day had these white ass clothes and now I could buy darker shit for him.
---
Fuckin Mozzi let the bloody drones out
---
Oh I see. I know something about guns but not that much so yeah, that one got mixed
---
That‚Äôs just delaying the inevitable
---
:(
---
Can somebody please give me like a rundown on how to do this
---
Mute is my best friend when playing mozzie, love him &lt;3
---
The curse of solo queuing is drawing the luck of the deck, hoping your teammates will be competent or know how to shoot their firearms. It happens to the best of us but if you don‚Äôt want that happening to you again, I‚Äôd suggest going to discord to find better teammates around your rank or even communities for PlayStation.
---
I do the same, i have basic knowledge and a bit extended when it comes to parts and inner workings, but when it comes to names? Beats me
---
So youre the balloon?
---
Why have we not gotten an Atlyn helmet cosmetic for tachanks yet?
---
*Happy Static*
---
More like bosGAYcog
---
Blitz looks like Todd from breaking bad
---
Grwat drawing, but why her gadget in its deployed state doe? Like when its switched against a wall it looks like that but before it's a nice squishy icecream
---
I commented the same thing without even reading this lol he 100% does!
---
Not sure about SSO, but VSO (VitiazSpec) makes Gorka suits with the proper camo for both Fuze &amp; Tachanka.
---
Should have done better
---
On NNN? Disgraceful
---
When you trynna interrogate but he turns out to be a nice guy.
---
you actually can open hatches with assault rifles, smgs. not sure about meleeing tho
---
If you‚Äôll shoot someone in a game, you‚Äôll shoot someone in real life. It‚Äôs simple math
---
It should be his primary weapon my hypothetical stats are 40 dmg 550 RPM and 61/120 but it gets Russian ACOG with light recoil
---
This was a full stack. I have no clue what they were doing
---
Yep
---
I remember a really late night gaming session with some buds, like 20 hour at this point. I bought a pakol because it looked really cool. It's from Pakistan and you should buy it man, really cool and warm.
---
Yeah, what's up with that?
---
You can destroy them with regular rifles/pistols. They just take fucking forever. (as in like 2 dudes doing it wasting almost all their ammo) You basically have nothing left except the support beams before it falls apart though.
---
YOUR DRONES ARE MINE HAHA
---
spiky, rubber vagina
---
They should revert all the changes. Who gives a fuck if he‚Äôs a top fragger. If Ubisoft wanted a more support sniper operator they can add one in the future.
---
Crimson chin
---
exactly why would you want to stay in this game longer than you have to, tbagging for 10 mins isnt fun
---
They all left after the 2-1 round previously we had 3 tks.
---
Why
---
Get out of my swamp
---
thanks!
---
I agree but if they have loot boxes I think that they should be

I don't play siege; you can drop that thought right now. My friend is hovering in the bronze area. But he doesn't belong there. I've seen him make GOD plays, and he does it often. He's one of the best strategists I've ever seen. He knows where to be, and what to do when he gets there. He doesn't mess around and he shows no mercy. But here's the thing:
---
Siege is not, AND WILL NEVER BE, a one man game. Teamwork is a REQUIREMENT to win. Period. And he constantly gets put on a team of people who have no fucking clue what they're doing. And more often than not, most of the the people on the enemy team are actually trying to win, unlike his teammates.
---
How does my man get out of this hole?
---
Damn üòç
---
Yeah Blackbeard is there too, your point
---
it has higher dps but the f2 has higher firerate which is better
---
The best way to fix glaz would be to make his scope realistic.
---
Black cold/white hot so everything that's not a person is just different shades of black. heavy clothing mitigates IR signature. And his batteries dont fall put when he moves.
---
Oh and also it's not an eotech magnifier so he cant flip it on and off.
---
u will see when the time comes
---
She a beaut
---
Where is that creature found?
---
The destruction ones don't make since but the main joke is the indestructible dinosaur on Oregon.
---
You don‚Äôt scare me boy
---
idk man i pay them and they show up
---
No anime please I ain't fenna lose NNN
---
Shit hit reg, shit servers, tons of bugs, can't fix any problems and more
---
Thanks a lot man, tried it and it worked perfectly
---
whats the nr.1 thing?
---
Mute stops blitz's wired shield, jackals wired helmet, and lions *sonar* that isnt even an electrical device what the heck!
---
it's the servers that are down. But that's been known for a long time.
---
Blackbeard just needs to tape that dinosaur drawing onto his gun then.
---
Lol i once made a rotate there and started shooting the painting accidentally killing a teammate only to get tkd next round
---
to be fair, it only works half of the time you play this game, so it's understandable
---
Nerfing Caveira.

He is a great player based on his performance in unranked/casual. Not to mention his 2.9-3.1 K/D with all of the operators he uses, which definitely isn't bronze worthy. Bold of you to assume I'm some kind of vegetable who couldn't tell you the difference between a fish and a bird.
---
Entirely personal preference, try both out a lot and figure out which you like best
---
My name clearly says I love alibi and i play her a lot but vigil is defiantly a strong operator with good weapons and a good gadget for staying somewhat hidden

I dont think support can help me, since its a problem with the server. Im PC btw and my PC has managed to run r6 for more than 2000h so i dont think its my PC either. Especially because my friend has the same problem.

&gt;We wear the mask that grins and lies,

In counting all our tears and sighs?

Nay, let them only see us, while

       We wear the mask.

To thee from tortured souls arise.

We sing, but oh the clay is vile

Beneath our feet, and long the mile;

But let the world dream otherwise,

That‚Äôd be cool. Unfortunately all my friends think they‚Äôre too cool to cosplay despite their love of siege.  If only

I like it but I think 5 is too long. Maybe 3.5?

I want more ops with the ar33 not that shit

That's fine with me :3

can you read? I said without duplicates I would have every single item. And what should I do with the packs when I have every single skin?

Check for updates?
---
i got banned for cheating recently as well. i never cheat, i dont even know how to cheat. ubisoft appeal said they wont be lifting it and on the forums the devs said it was legit. again ive never ever cheated or even close to that. ubisoft can fuck themselves.
---
Well the thing is he‚Äôs got such a kd against bronze players which doesn‚Äôt say much since most of them are fairly new to the game and have absolutely no game sense. And it isn‚Äôt bold of me to assume you don‚Äôt know what your talking about since you don‚Äôt play the game and playing it changes perspectives quite heavily.
---
Red dot site with suppressor and laser sites on the MP5 lmaoo.
---
No gaming chair can do that it‚Äôs a glitch, in fact I bet it‚Äôs from season 1 before Valks looks got changed she made a face like in the second photo
---
The C8 is only used by Canadians. No other army ever has used it. I would recommend using the G36c as it‚Äôs more realistic.
---
Nothing is confirmed. I doubt Ubi will do it just because some Swedish YouTuber started a joke movement

I did not know that... I should do some more research thank you... :3

Thx bro

To be fair he probably only hit the shot because of the laser

That thing lookin like the chupacabra from grim adventures.

Wait no, nevermind, don‚Äôt change it. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_equipment_of_the_Norwegian_Army

This is an idea I've not seen before, well done sir

Oh lol that was some quick research nice going xD

Which loading piece do you get stuck on, along with that support can at least figure out what's wrong with it and when it'll be fixed

Thank you very much :3 &lt;3

You‚Äôll have to pay first if you wanna do that

OP Linked his twitter and Badger commented

It‚Äôs ingame currency and you can choose to gamble it on alpha packs or save up for uniforms etc in the shop. So it‚Äôs up to you what you do plus you get alpha packs from time to time for free. 
---
And you can‚Äôt say that there‚Äôs just bs in them out of my last 37 packs (yes I count them cause I love stats) I got 16 epics (4black ice), 2 legendarys and nice rare ones. Plus most commons/ uncommons were uniforms and headgears. That‚Äôs a great deal if you ask me

facts
---
He didn‚Äôt say general kenobi! Outrageous
---
u/WatchDogsOfficial
---
No, he means that the barricade should have hp which could be dmged in different ways. So lets say 1 sledge hit does 50 dmg and 1 breaching charge does 50 dmg and that breaks the barricade. As it is now its basically knife it 12 times(I think) or destroy it in 1 hit with other methods.

So you played Vs your friend and mistakenly shot you? I'm sorry but it feels so rigged no offense.

That's nice
---
I placed at Gold 3 but slowly declined lol, I've only been playing Siege on PC two months so I'm still not the best, will eventually get there though!
---
Gold 3 for a 2 month old player is really good
---
Hold up does that work?
---
No, but it will do 5 damage instead of 10 and you only get 5 but it recharges like lesions gu-mines. it would be awesome to collab. with Ubisoft
---
Definitely Mercy, only played once but that round man...
---
You always make some quality stuff my guy
---
Are you a roaming Chanka, spreading wisdom throughout the map, or are you an anchor, establishing you turrent shrine for all to gaze upon?
---
which is literally why rng is a bad system lmao
---
I've got loads of previous streams on there you can watch for the time being lol
---
Yeah. There was a specific reason why she has to do that and I don‚Äôt remember what it was
---
It‚Äôs what makes it juicy imo
---
People always ask, "what's in the canister?" But no one ever asks, "hows the canister?"

Same but Cav's shotgun is just nasty, and her SMG is horrible

Probably ‚Äútoo overpowered‚Äù. Even though once you use the thing it makes so much noise.

I dont think so

just learn to tap fire it or fire in short bursts.
---
y = mx + b -e
---
Que Benny hill theme
---
Not helpful when the damage is very low
---
On defense I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a tossup between the 416-C or the ALDA.
---
The high fire rate with the 80 round magazine makes it very good. It's also on defense, so it's better as they come to you. The ARX has a decent fire rate and a small clip. It's good, but you reload too often.
---
I feel like she should be able to hook it to her a belt and pull herself up but it takes a couple seconds to detach, similarly to picking up a deployed gadget, that way you can still shoot and move a tad bit, but you can‚Äôt just immediately jump in and slaughter obj
---
Yeah. That makes it a little more reasonable, but maybe no recharge. The weapon is described as something like a projectile. Might be a misunderstanding though.
---
One shot melee don't exist, personally i find that stupid, and the extremely easy recoil management on some guns. Gun fight wise, recoil is the most unrealistic imo, and gun damage.
---
To a certain degree, but it shouldn't arbitrarily waste people's times in the scale of hundreds of hours depending on dupe rates.
---
I mean I guess smoke and frost aren‚Äôt but the rest a skeletons, a dead body and a zombie.... and who says they couldn‚Äôt have done any other operator or not even done pulse
---
Nah tht would be wack, punish players for stupid decisions. Natural selection.
---
yes it is an electrified projectile hence the recharge
---
did everyone get thanos'd or something? what is this?
---
It suits my playstyle fast peeks and angle holds, when I'm not being trash.
---
I was about to ask that. And I don't know. XD
---
Float like a butterfly and float like a butterfly
---
I think ALDA takes it on the hip fire, but the 416 is more accurate for me personally.
---
are you sure thats cosplay, looks more like character art
---
No you don't. The Skorpion used to have virtually no recoil. It was bad.
---
Where it's at now is good.
---
At least horizontal, vertical is easy
---
I winder what would happen if you forced a draw every round by using a grenade to kill the last defender and attacker at the same time?

Yo, he looks like sean from my school.
