Go back to minecraft kid this game is rated m for mature and you clearly don't fit the criteria.

Oof
---
There should be an operator that gets spider senses for a short period of time
---
Stop bitching. You even did it on purpose the second time.
---
I agree with him. Dog&gt;Human
---
I would 100% kill your dog over people
---
Yeah there is no way a Dev like ubi is putting killing did as a gameplay mechanic in one of their mainstream Games
---
Glad it works!
---
True, true.
---
Think about it. We kill ourselves and each other. They are just innocent creature that love and will forgive us for anything
---
You mean nice play? Those were shotgun shots from 2 feet away
---
I just found my ps4 copy of siege actually. Was flipping though a old Cd holder thing and there she was
---
you could always just play a trap op to deal with the dog ( it‚Äôs called counter picking, top players use it to have an advantage )
---
Why not a robotic dog?

Looks really good!

Ladies, please no arguing in my post, especially on my first cake day. üòû

---
its 2019 lmao everyone plays minecraft fucking retard. Also, you're thr one who fely the need to complain i posted something, who's the child here?
---
Because my entire team was bitching.
---
maybe you are part of the problem. 
---
you go chasing frags and leave wholes on defense that silvers can't cover. if you want to leave silver and copper, you need to play defense, use barbed wire and get the kills.
---
I saw the video too but I really don‚Äôt think it belongs in rainbow six. It would mess up the game imo
---
It's unfair as the poster was sarcastic and everyone is fine with that, but what have I done?
---
Get used to it
---
Yep thanks man
---
Or the dog-killing trophy in MW where you have to kill 30 of them
---
Damn he really missed that double claymore kill
---
I‚Äôm not going for kills and leaving my team. It‚Äôs more or less me always trying to clutch up. I‚Äôm a doc main so defense is my strategy.
---
With skin this thin it‚Äôs no wonder why you play clash. /s

Rc4, f2, and the meme cannon
---
But
---
Are you ok with shooting a dog?
---
i suggest leaving doc then.
---
go for maestro. you can get more intel and delay the push, while using acog. 
---
i know how hard it is, i play alone for 4 years. i get to plat in two days nowadays, but used to get all the way down to silver during the beginning of the season.
---
if you can cluch and get kills, use maestro and lesion more. you have to delay push and get kills. pray for the rest not to be drunk.
---
Well, the recoil
---
If you are being serious, fuck you and your selfish human centric morality. You can't force your completely subjective beliefs on anyone, especially when the creature in question is the most destructive non-native species to ever exist.
---
Man the siege community is so nice and non-toxic

Why do I need to change your mind if you're right?

I get things like this all the time and people call me crazy

Yea true. I think as long as Ubi wouldn‚Äôt do anything that would make it seem ‚Äúcruel‚Äù (loud whimpering, limping, etc) then there‚Äôd be no problem adding a dog to the game, would also be a nice fresh addition imo. Hopefully we end up getting one,
---
The most usable iron sight is bandit in my opinion and no not because I‚Äôm a bandit main
---
Nice, I probably would miss with all 7 shots

After playing some CSGO for the first time today, it really makes you appreciate Ubi for cracking down on cheaters like they do.

ok then

I play on PC myself, but from this sub and the crazy ammounts of console clips, the play style is so different from PC to console and the way that console players play different than PC players probably screwed this guy up, and anyone else moving between the two.

Personal preference you like roamers or anchors
---
No. On some points you don‚Äôt even need to reinforce or don‚Äôt reinforce all the walls. And this will be hell for kapkan because he will have to place his walls and then go around the map and place his traps.
---
Ok
---
Oh, really? I think I joined like mid-Blood Orchid, but I didn't know that was an option back then.
---
Yea that ain‚Äôt me chief. I hate cheaters, and they all think they‚Äôre so cool doing it.
---
I came here to comment this. Thank you good sir/ma'am
---
Yeah, I wasn‚Äôt calling you out, I play here and there too
---
Oh ok, I never read the books or anything so that makes sense.
---
Those maps are unbalanced for *Ranked,* sure, but they're challenging to play on, and that's what makes it fun. Favela's got all those bustable walls, so it makes you really think where you're heading around the map. I don't disagree with you on Tower though, Tower's hot garbage.
---
Why do they need to mimick Ranked, though? Now they've got that Unranked playlist. Shouldn't that be enough? I want my House, dammit :c
---
Someone is always asking‚Äù what‚Äôs that smell‚Äù, you can now reply with‚Äù it‚Äôs what‚Äôs in the canister‚Äù

But it‚Äôs true
---
I would be more interested in making the dog a robotic one. Doesn't really need to be a realistic dog but a electronic sniffing robot that guides you to enemy location. Make it less dog-like should get it easier to be countered.
---
R6 is futuristic-based so this should be no big deal to implement.
---
You dont have to take your fingers off wasd
---
Try it out if it works it works
---
Yeah, it seems like the best way to do it would be allow it natively in the game and force you to play against other MnK‚Äôs,  but you could still spoof it with an adapter /:
---
I just wanna say, this picture shows how much tachanka carries. And youre also the best person ever to do this with friends
---
R6: would you shoot this dog if it came at you
---
Veteran gamers who played Splinter Cell, Far Cry and other games with hostile dogs: look it's me or the dog....sorry Fido but I got counterrorism to worry about.  John Wick be with you
---
Wouldn't both attackers and defenders have an operator from this organisation? That would mean both the teams are vulnerable to killing a dog? It really wouldn't be funny to do so.
---
Yep. I joined in BO end, and up until Chimera, I could select what I didn't want to play. I can confirm that it was there until say, Chimera or para bellum, but definitely wasn't there after that.
---
yeah but for someone new to pc it won‚Äôt be easy to use ctrl like that cause you have to use your pinky and most people can‚Äôt flex there pinkies like that for either long times or whatever

Yeah they are challenging but when you start favela on defense you already lost because attacking is so damn easy and there‚Äôs one meh points the other are bad. I like okaying house and plane from time to time but I‚Äôm not missing them because most of them he time I‚Äôm not having fun. Well for newer players maybe they are scared of unrank or don‚Äôt want to have to play more rounds so the go in casual.

Honestly, most of the shotgun sights are pretty nice, I don‚Äôt really like how a normal sight looks on them anyway. But literally all the irons other than shotguns and the Mx4 and MP7 ones suck
---
Edit: P90 is also ok, actually. Don‚Äôt really use the P90 personally, but it‚Äôs the same as the M1014 and GIGN shotgun.

How can you say something so controversial and yet so brave

Another Counter could be that hes not able to rapple because of the dog, or if he does the animations are longer and/or he cant shoot while doing it.

They could also make, that hes not permanently with you and u call him as an ability

I was thinking more of Squad, where you just lose bullets if the mag isn‚Äôt empty, but given siege‚Äôs fast-at-time‚Äôs nature, the slow/quick reload would be pretty neat.

People who knowingly and willingly trained to kill other human beings, suited themselves up in tactical gear, and get paid to kill other humans.

That is a lot different from a dog who is snatched from their mother as early as possible, trained and conditioned to do certain things, never having a single choice in the matter and unable to quit or even be compensated for it.
---
Everyone loves dogs more than people because they're innocent. They are just energetic goofballs who do what they do out of dedication to their owners or because they think it is fun. Most K9 operators keep their dog as a pet and it goes home with them and lives with their family and even plays with their kids.
---
I'd murder fictional people all day long but i'd never kill a dog in a game. I don't even like to have to kill wolves. Dogs have too many positive memories and associations with them. Nearly all interactions with a dog are purely positive. Humans on the other hand, you meet asshole humans constantly so you feel much less sympathy for them, especially the ones carrying guns with intent to kill you. Fuck em.

I started playing siege in September and have played 100hours since and I'm sitting at 14 attackers and 12 defenders. Standard ops are 5*5000 renown plus 50k for attackers and 25k for defenders. So I will have to play a couple hundred hours more to get everybody
---
The nerfs to Blitz, Jackal and Echo was unwarranted. They took half a season of pick and ban rates (right after the modes release) to justify nerfing them.  
---
Surprise surprise they are still the most constantly banned operators. Not because they are strong but because they are annoying to play against.

Annoying isn't OP.

1v2 casual 'clutch' with t bags 
---
What has happened to humanity.
---
In this particular situation (victim is strafing the opposite way from the shooter), peeker's advantage is amplified to the absolute maximum. It will be a problem even if your ping is good, just because of how networking works. Essentially, a moving enemy is always slightly ahead of where you see them, and when you're moving your player model is always slightly behind where you see it. Thus, an enemy moving into view of you can and will see you first, and if you're backing away from them at the same speed you won't be able to see them at all at the same time. The "lagging behind where they actually are" effect is usually very minimal in a high performance game, but in this situation, two instances of it are stacking on top of eachother and amplifying to the point where it's very obvious.
---
Really, the only way out of a situation like this is to consciously realize it's about to happen, and then avoid it: Either turn and sprint away (You'll be moving faster than the peeker), or move the other way and fight them head on while trying to move unpredictably (Cancels out their peeker's advantage, hopefully making it at least a 50/50 fight).
---
People should save their drone instead of rushing in the bomb sites.
---
Once we know which site we have to attack, go to your spawn point and grab it once the round start.
---
That‚Äôs tough brother. Blackbeard is hard to deal with 1v1 especially when he has a good shot on you first.
---
That joint wasn't going to roll itself....
---
I cant agree with jackal tho. His pings last for what feels like half the round, he has one of the best guns in the game, secondary shotty for soft destruction, smokes and the footprints last for almost 2 minutes. His skill should be reworked completely imo.
---
Few of my friends yeah, no one plays on NEU so long que times

And thanks for making the pump actions cycle while sprinting! Another small change that had massive effects.

PS: Does the spread going more towards the center on average also apply to non-shotguns? Because I swear, hipfire feels way more reliable than it used to for every other gun as well.

Oh my god I literally did this, I went from console to a shitty Old pc that crashed every other game until I bought a new one üòÇüòÇ

Be careful on reddit don't put emojis on your post people will be mad

I would understand if you turned off the friendly outline, but that's just on you
---
What do you mean how? I literally just wrote that Ubisoft is making a completely new game specifically based upon the outbreak game mode. Like have you watched the trailer for the game? It literally has operators from Rainbow 6 Siege. Have you even been following the Rainbow 6 Lore?
---
you see, you're still wrong either way about what the Compensator attachment did, soooo....

Wot!? Someone actually bought this shit? Idk about you guys but that's rent money right there... üôÑ

lmao only poor people and minorities think an iphone is a luxury item
---
ooh watch out big spender coming through
---
im saying its dumb to buy new models constantly because theres barely any updates to the tech
---
Oh damn. Really? Thanks bb I would‚Äôve never thought.
---
the funnest way to play r6 is get placed plat, then just play unranked because queue times are gay aids
---
It‚Äôs the servers being overloaded when with a good chunk of 45 million people it‚Äôs bound to cause some problems for a few people like my friend Aiden could barely play for the first 5 days of the season

Thats pretty sick ngl

I kill a lot player like thisüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

dunno
---
Yes but it‚Äôs a completely different game then Siege, for starters that‚Äôs only PvE and only has 3 players

Good guy op makes one for every op so people don't copy his idea for the 50+ ops in the game for karma

Nah she to quick she won't even activate them

Hello getas17, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/de2z0a/r6_is_not_broken_dude_you_just_have_bad_aim/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
His ping is annoying beacuse a jackal will always try and get the kill and you will see him around a corner and you can easily kill him and his weapons are decent at best
---
In a sense they both track, but gameplay would be completely different
---
Recent changes to live gameplay made hostage immune to fire.
---
Fun fact though, in the TTS, the attribution of killing the hostage was given to whoever blew up the shield. This means that if Ash detonates a shield, and hostage dies from it, Ash was blamed. What's more. If Ash detonates a shield, and this causes other shields to detonate and the second or third shield killed hostage, Ash was blamed by the system.
---
i do every timeüòê
---
What she was absolutely broken back then lethal primary with jacked rof with a 50 round mag, little recoil, 4 grzmot mines, impacts what more could you ask for oh 3 speed as well and the first operator with a red dot pistol. 
---
Also what do you mean by aim with her
---
everybody gangsta till enemy gets on tachanka turret
---
I have a habit of forgetting what gun I use X'D it was through two walls and the engine
---
Well yes. I never said it was going to be like Rainbow 6 siege. All I said was it was based off the outbreak game mode which was only PvE and only 3 players. So I don‚Äôt understand why you keep trying to explain what I already have said.
---
The Six Collection launched the third series in May with Ela, Bandit, Twitch, Vigil and Caveira, if you pre ordered the set you get a gold caveira figure free. The six collection sets have a different style and colour to the less premium sets and each figure comes with an in game charm code printed on card within each box. They retail at ‚Ç¨/$ 19.99 each whilst the other versions are about 10-15.
---
Needs more detail
---
If you dm the icon I'll make one Tbh I'd did forget them sorry for sinning.
---
"unmanned drones"
---
Which meter do you mean? Gadget timer, or the lines on the screen when you activate the gadget
---
how did you know
---
It‚Äôs soo unfair but what can we do about it
---
Gotta watch out with the slugs I‚Äôve done that too
---
We are on year 4 of this game and NOW the servers want to be overloaded by "a large playerbase?" I dont buy it. Especially with the holiday titles coming out there would be slightly below your average numbers playing at once. 
---
This issue began after ember rise was launched. The issue has to stem from that.
---
Gadget timer. The meter on-screen would essentially disappear.
---
Rip house
---
Well it fall more into Sony and Microsoft hands to be able to detect those third party adapter and block them.
---
Well in that case, I think that could be a really nice idea.
---
thats crazy my eyes saw shattered glass for some reason.
---
It means that a knife is always reliable.
---
It doesn't jam, it doesn't run out of ammo and it can't be electronically disrupted.
---
Can‚Äôt they just do something to block keyboard and mouse from games in general Sony and Microsoft atleast for online games
---
What
---
Haha xd
---
It's cheating
---
When you click on one of the preset flairs there is a text box it puts it in, instead of just clicking one and being done you can type in there manually. The op icons are just their names between a set of :
---
Yes they can and they do but the people that use mnk have a third party adapter that basically trick the console that you are using a controller when in facts are using mnk.
---
Unfortunately it isn‚Äôt gonna be cheap. Laptops to game are fairly expensive
---
There literally no point in delaying the end of a ban if the game isn‚Äôt open. This changes nothing, and just ends up being an inconvenience than a punishment.
---
That's just a one lazy counter
---
Yep
---
It does that after hours of being afk on the homescreen or when the Xbox just cuts on
---
I neeeeeed itt
---
It‚Äôs soo scummy there should be a button exclusive to console called report for key board and mouse and they should look into it because it‚Äôs a serious issue for console why don‚Äôt they encourage key board on console because it‚Äôs not fair
---
Why is it that expensive? I think a laptop can‚Äôt customise much such as replacing gpu right,  Still, do you have any suggestion for that ? Thanks
---
You can partly destroy the floor too..
---
That's been done before but the ones before you even did the floors and ceilings. And also you should do that in a secure hostage thunt, that way you can restock ammo
---
In the end of the day people can play whatever mode they want. And it‚Äôs not up to you to decide who can or can‚Äôt play what.
---
It took me way to long to figure out what I was looking at.

What about a welcome mat? I mean just to be sure.
---
Is that those things from Mario 2?
---
It would get blown by the edd, a goyo shield would do tho
---
Mute
---
But..even tho it may be easier to hit random headshots, it is significantly more likely it you do have skill and can aim/ control recoil etc. All that matters is that skill gets you further, and that is very true in r6.
---
An ATX Mid-Tower is the case size, it's the standard size of a tower. A Full-Tower is the size of a Doge Ram, and is very have. ITX is very small, smaller then a Micro-ATX. With how small it is, there will be issues with getting the right part in it to play R6 with it.
---
well just make sure to kill them before their rng bullet pattern mows you down like grass, simple
---
*Tourettes Guy* "WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'A BIRD?!'"
---
Did not find right one:(
---
Shit, you right
---
that shit barely happens unless you‚Äôre in like gold or below on console. and this game is clearly not rng and lot of siege is outplaying your enemies.
---
Laughs in bosg*
---
just shoot first
---
They got changed in Ember Rise to be more consistent.
---
if only it were that easy, still i think high fire rate guns and rng aren‚Äôt a big problem because the majority of the time it doesn‚Äôt get them kills and if you are decent with good aim and recoil control you should not be killed often by people like them
---
Not bad
---
u right
---
Military shops might sell some of the stuff he has... not sure if you have those in the Uk

&gt;I have two or three times in 2 weeks had a 57% probability before I won, this would be statistically impossible
---
Unless it can literally never occur under any circumstances, it's not impossible, only improbable.

You could just be losing more than you're winning

This is neat. Would love to see a video of it in action.

Stopped reading when I saw all caps

That‚Äôs how you echo right there

How much is she right now?

Now you can't shoot peoples feets under doors, and they're free to smack away at them. Also annoying for echo
---
&gt; Cav
---
I said this in a previous post but the change to her damage dropoff was actually a buff.
---
Maximum damage (CQC) went from 99 down to 65, and while the minimum damage technically went down (from 19 to 13), it doesn't actually reach that minimum until 3.5x further away (35m instead of 10).
---
So yes ***technically*** it does less damage at extreme ranges, but it's doing ***more*** damage between 5 and 35 meters.
---
&gt;Ela
---
Personally I think she's almost ok where she is now, and impacts would be too much for her, considering how good she is in CQC already but thats just me
---
"is getting"?
---
Nope.  Best one ever is Arnold Schwarzenegger holding the rocket launcher.
---
Newly founded and known do not belong in the same sentence. You‚Äôre not known as anything if you‚Äôre newly founded and nobody has the slightest clue who Team Confirm is. 
---
Also, if you are good at the game, you should have plenty of friends and people you know that you could bring onto the team. Posting a recruiting thread on Reddit doesn‚Äôt look good for a team, and 9 times out of 10, will result in the team disbanding after 1 or 2 losses.

I dont have a great trigger finger sadly. I‚Äôll still keep him in mind tho, thanks!

The iPhone 11 pro is a bit ugly with it's 3 "eye" camera lens setup.

Spawn peeking to a next level
---
That would be cool if he had an animation like this before he decimated someone with his sledgehammer.
---
That highly depends on who you play regularly.
---
Personally I'd recommend the Mute and Thatcher elites simply because of their looks, and their elite MVP animations being some of the best, additionally due to them both fitting within your respectable preferred playstyles. 
---
Honestly, just buy the elite of the operator you play the most, or choose the elite you find the best looking. It's all personal preference, what one person likes might not be what you like.

Some people have disposable income.

Just keep on saving for more important things my dude.

When you main Caveira she‚Äôs banned anyways so I‚Äôm in the clear

You are not taking into account the cumulative effect of each successive win or loss.
---
Yeah, personally I had no problem with secure area being in ranked. It's the perfect balance between playing for objective while forcing you to be able to outgun your opponents.

Perhaps ask on a military or airsoft sub?

Easy if you‚Äôre on mobile. The sub‚Äôs home page, there‚Äôll be 3 dots in the top right corner. Click that. A drop down type list will come up, search it until you see the change user flair option (second to the bottom I think?). Click it, and click on your flair of choice. After you click your desired flair, you can click edit and type in whatever you want (thru the constraints of like, 50 characters). 
---
If you want a Chibi, type :MiraChibi: and bam! Chibi will be there! Also, I only used Mira as an example. Type in any op and it will show up!
---
What about tactical spiders instead?
---
New patch: introduces carrier pigeon, carrying frags.

Personally I think Mira is a good choice since alot of maps could use a Mira. Just beware people will have you stand still at the start of the round to look at Miras chest (this happened more times then I could think of lol)

Honestly, I‚Äôve strayed away from holo. It‚Äôs a little too bulky for me. I typically use reflex, except on (most) ACOG ops just because, well, ACOG. Only exceptions I can think of are Jackal, Ash, J√§ger, and Bandit... wait.

Are you sure? Pretty much all the times someone's run out pretty far, it's been a Vigil, and going to distances I thought you would get detected in. I know his ability counters Lion's scans, maybe that's partly why I thought that.. Maybe you can just run out further than I thought

Wait, Echo.. In ranked?

Plz explain

Only ever played pc.

I completely respect your decision and all that, but not everyone can just hop on board. Vegetables and fruits dont give all the necessary vitamins we need to survive, and I don't like the idea of taking supplements everyday just cause I don't want to eat meat. Now what is animal cruelty is the conditions the animals are kept in. We can at least try to make their lives comfortable, that i can agree with.

Make this a phone game lol

No, they made her ugly https://i.redd.it/9cd8hdfe9uz21.jpg
---
Then that's just a failure of time management on the retake or failure on preventing plant in the first place.
---
I'd work out how they were able to plant and work out why my/our retake took too long. Was I not aggressive enough? Was I too far away from site? Did I waste time on a rotate? Was I not coordinating with my team properly?
---
To get to the point of the defuse timing out there are multiple failures on part of myself and the team.

I'd only be mad at myself and work out how to improve.

Except, a knife isnt going to break with three or four uses. You can get a whole lot of use out of it but theres always a slight chance something might go wrong with your gun. It might actually break with the first shot. So if you pull a knife and the other dude pulls a gun, but when he shoots all that's heard is a click, who do you thinks gonna win that situation?

*IF* this is a "I got more kills so I'm better than my teammates" rant, than I've got new for you. You aren't. If you were it to compare to football, more goals than your teammates doesn't make you better than them. Another player can have less kills (or goals) but they could have been the deciding one.  
---
For example winning with 8 kills is nice, but if you keep choking the 2v1's and die while your teammates clutch those 1v1's you left them in, than that doesn't make them worse than you for having less kills.
---
Learn the maps. When you die pay attention to how other players move to the objective, how they hold angles, etc.
---
They only started banning on console and refunding elo recently.
---
But maybe I titled it wrong
---
I saw this post and right under it there is a post that says "Fuck jackle"
---
But at the end of the day we can‚Äôt shoot the game for it, right? Those people get banned and if it‚Äôs hostage killing then it‚Äôs just a casual right? Shooting the game and community as a whole is wrong, UBI is battling TK‚Äôing as much as they can, with every season i feel like this is getting better.
---
Edit: sorry for going off a bit in my other comment but i‚Äôm tired of all the hate ubi gets from everything... yes tk‚Äôing is annoying and yes i get it, warden sucks ass. But does that make ubi that bad? 4 seasons, 8 ops a year. We could‚Äôve had fucin activission as devs. If one op a year sucks i get it alright... they‚Äôll buff em a bit but we still get so much great stuff, we‚Äôre *spoiled* and people don‚Äôt see it. Yes being tk‚Äôed sucks ass but seing that sweet username get just a 30 minutebban or being ‚Äùbanned for toxcicity‚Äù is amazing.
---
Why is it so hard to just be happy with all that we have?
---
How do I delete someone else‚Äôs comment?
---
No, we don't.
---
Man you clearly are one of the people that stacks with teammates or you havent played enough siege to know what your talking about, undoubtedly this game is one of the most toxic. Its not as rare as you seem to think it is, in fact its rather common.
---
Maybe you've gotten lucky, and you've found the best random teammates every match but thats not feasible for the average siege player. To be clear, im not "attacking" you here but you need to understand that your situation is not the same as the guy next to you. You dont know for a fact that he has only ever found this one toxic stack of kids. Infact id wager that he's been in this situation many times before.
---
To OP,
---
My best advice is to find a stack of friends or "randoms" that you like to play with and they like playing with you. I know that is the advice that everyone gives but its because it works.
---
Apologies for typos, typing on my tablet is not as easy as my pc lol
---
Yeah I already have
---
'Adorkable' a word I've heard quite a few times, for people who are awkward but in a spunky and adorable manner. And 'remarquable' sounds like something that someone whose first language wasn't english would say.
---
What a nosey Fuze.
---
You are right about that but I would love to see the RFF getting carried over to the next game for the worst offenders like If you tk every game and just running the fun
---
Would you mind telling me the specs of your PC
---

Please tell me this isn‚Äôt fucking Ranked dude. It‚Äôs 3-0 and these dumbasses are running out when there‚Äôs one person left.

Im so happy with this feedback bro, to be honest this was my first illustrating project ive ever worked on so thats nice to hear. And jeah im working on multiple projects right now, do you have a elite/normal skin suggestions?
---
screw pro league, just go strait to world's and 1v5 everyone
---
Once with Zofia
---
Thanks for helping but I know where that is coming from he might be lucky or have a stack of friends but just take a look at the enemy team then you will see that ppl are toxic 9 out of 10 games I see with my friend there are players in the enemy team who are tk

I hope your joking

How is this vigil lol

The reality is that getting the plant down after time is the way it's always been. Attackers have 3 minutes to begin planting the defuser, and defenders have 33 seconds to defuse (I believe defuse timer is 40 seconds).

Just a lil bit more, but yes, around 3 months.

exactly, like a real man.

i figured, thanks for the info. do you know if it was any achievements in particular?

It feels like I‚Äôve gotten it way more this season and I‚Äôm not happy about it
---
I believe this is intended when you join at the last moment as you mentioned you did. 
---
This can also happen if the player does not have a whole lot of operators available, and all his available ops are selected by other members of the team.
---
u almost killed me man!
---
You missed the overall message of my comment though. You gotta just deal with it, it is part of the game, Ubi will keep trying to add stuff to prevent it, and they will find new ways to disperse their toxicity. 
---
I say find a team because when you have a group you enjoy playing with you'll be having fun regardless of if the other team TK'S. 
---
You can also find a good enough squad and get high ranked and then play exclusively ranked. At high ranks you have a lower ratio of toxic people but you're still going to encounter them from time to time at which point you have to use my previous advice, and just get over it
---
Great, now I can get to my right ranking now...
---
Lol everyone pointing out the drone shot while i'm here wondering what happened to lesion and his HP
---
We drank a lot of water it was great ! We got hydrated , this is a cool mini game
---
IQ: "RED ACTIVE. IF IT RUNS ON BATTERIES, I'LL MAKE IT SWISS CHEESE! ***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!***"
---
In the meantime give more console commands with cheats (only available to be toggled on custom matches as a setting, permanently off in online matchmaking). E.g. infinite gadgets/ammo/grenades, god, noclip toggle.
---
But we all know that K-9 ops are more important because doggos are so cute!!1!
---
CoD insentifies
---
Helm because he's German.
---
Not to be dramatic or anything but I would kill for her
---
I mean uh
---
Die for her. Right.
---
I know that some people get tilted playing games but this guy is definitely overdoing it...
---
Missed opportunity to use the killer jack mask
---
Thats my friend he got shot while someone was trying to hit a drone. Stimmed him after the gif ended
---
Edit grammar
---
Nahh, that‚Äôs just jeager‚Äôs acog
---
Which is why they can't be added. Do you want to shoot a doggy
---
But my good sir I ain't that good I'm am trash I can have my moments but playing against plat and diamonds is something different
---
fat chance I was one match off plat 2 today and proceed to go against dudes whove played the game since operation health and diamond + every season playing with a gold
---
Oh yeah
---
I know right. It‚Äôs so irritating whenever someone says I‚Äôm gonna be violent in future because of fake news such as Fox News spreading stupid info.
---
i think when the sniper scope is on, it should have some sort of small glare from the rifle when glaz is aiming, and reduced ads time as well. this way defenders can react to glaz aiming at them from a distance, but still give him a chance when it comes to closer quarters engagements
---
I doubt I'll get ban for a joke that doesn't effect both parties in anyway.
---
Just buff his damage.
---
We are reaching new level of toxicity never seen before
---
show me, i might make a second version like i did with smoke
---
Toxicity is my middle name
---
Ohhh I've played against that guy lol. Bloody high pingers
---
Japan is one HELL of a drug
---
I feel so good using mpx
---
There is an option for zoom-in depth of field...
---
Well then it seems all you have is my main point then. 
---
Just get over it.
---
It's part of this game because of the kind of people it attracts.
---
Maybe go play some Rust and feel the true Toxicity potential of gamers and come back to R6S and it won't seem as bad
---
Tryhar....
---
My twitch drone has been spawn peeked on old kanal before
---
Mp5 is better than mp5k
---
they never said they were going to fix smurfing. they were aiming to fix the copper-diamonds boosting.
---
and this is still within 1000 elo. it's fine.
---
It should be 500
---
30FPS
---
This is so sick bro. I cant wait for 20th. Please make it Zofia!!!
---
#DONT YOU MEAN SPAWN PEEK
---
thanks i hate it
---
Yeah. God, Mira is so fuckin' hot and French an' shit.
---
Well people with bad aim just need to get good accept it and shut the fuck up
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
I agree. and i think it should let lower ranks join but not count them if its not within the limit, so friends of any ranks can play
---
Wait since when Does an iPhone 11 exist
---
If these were wallpapers, they'd be even better! *wink wink*
---
German
---
It's good and your right but it will never change
---
Why did I think the iPhone was chard from being on fire
---
Kills dont matter if your a support op
---
almost dropped a drone ace, teammate stole the last kill had to tk him üò§üò§üò§
---
&gt; i never knew neckshots are not head shots
---
Im saying the opposite(not the original commenter here) 
---
neck shots should be headshots unless they changed it again.

Ubisoft will never listen to us, they don't care about the ranked or pro players- they ignore us in favour of the casuals.
---
Holy shit they‚Äôre bad. Are you in gold?
---
R u good they rework maps that are unfairly balanced and change it because it takes more time for them to make a new map then just rework one
---
Maybe you can control the dog like in cod ghosts
---
No you can't.
---
Like if you said this about cod then yea I could agree. But in a game where precision aiming is better than movement then no.
---
If it was equal pro Siege players on Xbox would cross over to PC for the free money. But they don't
---
What is MnK?
---
I like the kanal rework.
---
Hereford not so much but kanal I feel is just fine.
---
Console players think they can tell, and expect Ubisoft to code super AIs to detect them and ban them. Rainbow six console players are the most disconnected from reality people I've ever seen. They have no fucking clue what they are talking about with MnK and DDoS and yet they think themselves so much smarter than Ubisoft and Microsoft who have been in the business for decades.
---
I don‚Äôt think it will. The problem is not aming at the enemy it‚Äôs controlling the recoil to get a headshot. If you put a mnk vs a controller the mnk will get the headshot first because you can easily run a higher sens and have better recoil control.
---
U are an idiot. These ideas suck especially the vigil nerf. You are obviously low rank lol
---
Have you checked in with [Ubisoft Support](https://support.ubi.com/Cases/New) yet?

BREAKING NEWS VIDEOGAMES PROMOTE ALCOHOL TO KIDS!
---
Me: so does fake news
---
I waited thirty seconds to see someone pop up on that angle you had on the rotation hole before realizing the video was paused
---
K-Anal is cool now.
---
It's insanely defender sided to the point where attack will never win against competent players. I'm speaking from the view of a PC Plat player btw.
---
Hello ItalianWarEffort, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/deb81a/rainbow_six_siege_sound_glitch_xbox/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It would be perfect if you made the drone out of a real drone. Dont know if that would be hard either way good cosplay
---
In that case, I'd reach out to NVIDIA support for that error message.
---
Bro...

That‚Äôs awesome my dude.
---
I play in gold and have won attack on canal plenty of times. Lol
---
Found the incel
---
Its doc elite
---
Usually Maverick brings out his BIC lighter and fucken burns the downed one
---
Hm
---
I play pc as well. Not as high in the ranked latter sadly. I do suppose that would effect it.
---
Either way it‚Äôs still better than Hereford. Plus the 3 rounds and switch just isn‚Äôt good in general imo.
---
They need to rework the maps already in the ranked pool like Skyscraper and Chalet. The last time they reworked a dogshit casual map was Hereford and look how that turned out.
---
Yeah your right! The parts are backwards or whatever
---
Tbh the skill gap in this game mostly comes from map knowledge and strategy. While it could help them in gunfights it isn't the most necessary thing. I mean, a controller player basically owned shroud and his team during that creator comp thing. That's just the way I see it
---
Elaborate.
---
No that's definitely toxic
---
You're an asshole
---
Yes. Yes it has. I‚Äôve never been so triggered in all my life !!
---
Bruh don‚Äôt go adding pictures of people accusing you of using a mouse.
---
Done -&gt; Drone...English why you so confusing
---
My highest was 89
---
How do you attack the map to win?
