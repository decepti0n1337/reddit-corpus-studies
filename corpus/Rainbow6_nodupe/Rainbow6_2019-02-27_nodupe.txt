I typically play with 5 stacks on bomb (gold ranks) and I'm leaning towards maestro but I'm scared of the ash mains that will make all of my bulletproof shootys disappear, Valk can hide her cams.

why is this so accurate

The person who said that was probably trolling. Hostage is a toxic shitfest one should never attempt to play if trying to enjoy the game in a serious or competitive manner 
---
And the carbon pro leagues are nothing like the originals. You just foiled your own point. 
---
Many people consider it a gendered slur. What are you, some kind of nazi???
---
That checks out 
---
Well other than going jager, best bet is to hold longer angles and hold areas that cant have nades thrown at them, which is pretty rare. 
---
😂😂😂
---
I thought you were gonna teabag and I was getting pissed. ABout to say you had no right to do it after that
---
Yeah I am bit late, because I bought the game two days ago.
---
Oregon. Not my favorite map, but the most balanced and consistently enjoyable for me 
---
but, did you like it? or is it just a phase?
---
i get what you are saying. but a team with Doc makes Doc more valuable than before. the reset hurts attackers and defenders, but defenders have a Doc, and the attackers kind of dont. i dont count Finka, and even if i do i rather be a defender with Doc in my team than be an attacker with Finka in my team.

Depends on the map, and your knowledge of said map. Chalet and Yacht are two of my favorite maps for Kapkan - Oregon can be pretty alright too.

You don't usually want to put a kaptrap on obj - it's predictable and easily spotted.

A old R6 fan who played the game and sadly later died so his friend asked Epi if they could put his stats on a map. 
---
Well he's an idiot. Ubi: "we were going to do this in season 2, but this orange and black guy in Reddit wants it season 1, he asked nicely so let's do it!". Maybe if you email Microsoft and ask them if they can release the new Xbox tomorrow, they'll do that too!

you usually don't call someone random a slur... imo bitch isn't that big of a deal, it's the same as saying "fucker" or "asshole". I don't see much difference possibly because I only ever use those words in a kind of joking manner with my friends
---
Here’s my idea:
---
Tripwire - A female defending operator who has two Kapkan-like gadgets that they can deploy on wall. They emit a faint laser, noticeable, but not to the point that it would be seen from very far away. Once the tripwire is activated by an attacker running through, the gadget plays a loud buzzing noise. If another attacker runs through it after it has been activated, it will start inflicting damage to him/her. The gadget itself is relatively small and is hard to find by itself. Attackers can find it by following the laser to the wall and shooting at it.
---
Optics - A male attacking operator who has a secondary scope on the side of his gun, equivalent to a reflex,  red dot, or holographic sight. It reveals any enemy in sight within a 25 m. by placing a yellow marker on them.
---
Anyways, those were my thoughts that came to mind when I saw this post.
---
There was also a ton of screaming involved and a ton of back seat gaming

I managed to throw a grenade through a hatch and into a different room. Dropped down and got blown up by my grenade from 15 feet away. Grenades are fun

Sweet, thank you!

I feel like that would make it so everyone votes for the same map like house every time it shows up and would cause the same problem 
---
As you could tell from the clip there was no point in taking the game seriously at that point

I like this idea except it’s g to use a grenade, you can’t select the grenade uncooked like in CSGO.

Maybe two out of these three?

I’m still quite enjoying it. I’ve found I stopped having fun in MP games if I took them too seriously. So I made a conscious decision to play casually (when I made the switch to Seige from OW). yes I always try to win and improve, but I no longer beat myself up over having a bad night and not being at my best or caring what my rank is (I’ve been everywhere from silver 3 up to Plat 3, though I’d rate my actual skill around Gold 2- Gold 1). If I get too frustrated I just stop playing for the night and maybe not play for a few days till I get the itch again.
---
You’re probably just burnt out, like I became with Overwatch (which I only really play now during its events). I’d say try a co-op games with your friends like Borderlands or Warframe or Mass Effect 3 MP. Until you get the desire to come back.

I have had more than one instance of a three stack bullying my duo queue for absolutely no reason. Getting TKed for no reason every round by a different person each time. It was diamonds every time &amp; it’s disappointing. Some people play just to harass others &amp; it’s a problem definitely with the game’s current &amp; growing popularity.

I wouldnt like a map voting system cause the random maps keeps the game fresh and makes for some exciting games

Delta is made up of army special forces/rangers and is the army's tier 1 unit for jsoc.

 But Maverick was in intel before joining Delta, so yeah no operator with an army special forces background has been on the roster yet

That moment when you try to open up to your friends.

GO GO RECRUIT RANGERS
---
The g36c was never sh*t. That gun has consistently boasted lower times to kill than MOST attacker primaries. In comparison, the 556, 552, l85, para, are all trash compared to it and it even beats Jäger's 416, meaning there's only one gun ok Defense that can beat it, the alda, which beats the r4c as well. Everybody was so stuck on the DPS stat that nobody realised that dps matters for jack in siege and TTK is what matters. Dps matters in games like Apex where you have to break shields and higher the damage the better. Not siege, where you shoot flesh.
---
So, yeah, if you want an ACOG and angled grip, g36c is solid af. If you want to do a ballsy rush, r4c with 1x is your play, as it always has been.

I'm just imagining the Brazilians trying to play Mario - "damn right it's a bitch plant, get the fuck out that pipe you pussy"

That was the original plan for Capitao. Healing darts. They abandoned the concept because attackers are more spread out. They ended up playing with that idea again with Finka's boost, and to solve their problem a global gadget or an AOE heal are the only possible choices.

Porting it would likely still split the community (unless they enable some sort of cross play between generations) which is something Ubisoft really really really wants to avoid. And i doubt they want to spend money on porting it too.

Backwards compatibility is the likely answer.

Can’t you rappell off them and then just hold the grenade till it poofs?

Ugh i hate when that happens to me

Thatcher rework idea:
---
EMP won't destroy, only disables electronics.
---
To turn it back on, you have to walk to it, and hold E to turn it on. No, you cannot pick up disabled gadgets, and turning it back on takes 4 seconds.
---
Zapped Gadgets will emit a faint blue light and electrical effects. (rip lesion)
---
If an defender has electronic gadgets (Let's say, Bandit) got into the blast radius of the EMP, he will be given an effect that renders him unable to deploy his gadgets until the effect ends.

Reactivation animation:

Mute: Flicking the antenna off one by one, and Flicking them back on

Smoke: Picking it up, turns it off, turns it back on

Pulse: Percussive Maintenance (Hitting it repeatedly
---
Jäger: Flicking the "Head" with his finger, rotates the head with his hands and the light turns back on.
---
Bandit: Percussive Maintenance, but more violent than Pulse and uses the old defuse animation (don't worry, the thumping sound is inaudible)
---
Kapkan: Sticks his hand behind the EDD, fidgets around for 3 seconds and the laser will be back on
---
Valkyrie: Picks it up, shakes it violently until it's back on
---
Echo: presses a button on the Yokai, taps something on his Wristband, and it turns back on.
---
Lesion: Picks it up, pounds it to the floor a few times, tosses it to the ground again.

Ela: Puts the pin back in, the green light went back on, pulls out the pin to re-arm it.

Vigil: Sticks his hand to the back of his torso, fidget around for a moment and it's back on.

Is no one going to point out that this is not OC and has been posted here before?

That a character that has a big boom is usually not a viable option. Pick a simple character like sledge, rook, or bandit to start. Then move to more advanced like Jäger, Thermite, Thatcher, Doc, Caveria, and others

Yeah, the ADS/peeking stuff is a bit weird for me as I've come from games like CS:GO, Battlefield and CoD so there's less emphasis on trying to play as cautiously as in this game. 
---
It's understandable too, every game has a small minority that tries to ruin it for everybody else for a laugh. 
---
It’s honestly an unfixable problem. At the end of the day, the team with more skill will win the match. I know it sucks to get roasted by plat smurfs when you’re in gold, but it helps you learn more.

What the hell is "pg18" first off that would be a moving rating, not game. Second you know the "pg" stands for "Parental guidance" right? An 18 year old doesn't need parents to be with them because they're an adult already. Unless the "pegi 18" in european ratings gets shortened to pg I'm not sure what you're on.
---
No it’s the connotation of the structure of your words.  The same way that calling someone a bitch can be insulting or a joke.  Teaching someone “the hard way” implies you didn’t do it the easy way which would be simply explaining it to them, hence the confusion.

The best part is that while the game is pay 2 win to an extent since ops take so long to grind it's going to be amplified in that mode. If a new account has the most recent season pass and another mistake like lion or blackbeard get released, those players are going to have no chance and the likelihood someone on your team will also have the character will be way down.

This is actually one of the more toxic gaming communities lol.  There aren't enough repercussions in this game, and there's no way people aren't gonna smurf on this game when it's on sale.
---
it did because none of the ones you listed are 3 speeds. it’s much easier to get across the map and run from danger as a 3 speed. Jäger has one of the best guns on defense. And he’s a 3 speed. same with bandit. neither needs an acog to be good 
---
Jesus, you're right he's disgusting

As a Jager main. I can confirm this

Do you have any idea how queer people have been treated for the last hundred years? Language has power, weird choice is meaningful. Everytime you call someone gay for sucking at a game you're implying that gay people are inferior based on nothing more than who they prefer to have sex with.

---
I hope they rotate every round. Imagine you start a match on attack on a map where defenders are in favour. 0-3 and first people will leave unless you are already around gold/plat.
---
In 800h of ranked, the times I started on defense are rare. Maybe 10 times or sth.

So what I'm gathering here is that you don't care if someone insults the player, so long as it's unrelated to [insert facet of a player here]. Your statement insinuates that the *insulting* isn't the problem, it's the *method*.
---
Toxicity needs to be handled uniformly. It shouldn't matter whether someone says you're shit for any reason under the sun, it should be all tolerated or none of it. When you start cherry picking which things are NOT okay to say under the umbrella of "hate speech", you can get really nasty results if they're not careful.

The 21 kills was during placements but the other team was gold 3 through 1. The 2 18s were in high gold/platinum. The 2 17s were in platinum. And i've had a lot of 16 kill games across gold/platinum. And like maybe 30-40 ranked aces (u didn't ask but needed to throw in the flex lol).
---
Back off my girl 
---
I’m just going to end this conversation now, because I feel bad picking on the retarded kid. 
---
I really wish their was an additional questioning for each of the "who is your favorite _____" and "who is your least favorite _____", asking what the reasoning was.
---
It would be interesting to see why people choose a specific operator as their favorite.  Is it the gun, the gadget, the character, what is it.
---
NOT LEave mE PLEASE LOvE YOU BIG TIme
---
If I fail a clutch I just leave for fear of being TKed
---
I main Hibana on attack lmao
---
Maximum brightness. I don't know why people do it on this game because it looks awful.
---
She’s major anime uwu now lmao apparently there was so hate since she didn’t look enough Korean 
---
What bike is the bike based off?
---
She just realized how many tampons the owner has in the bathroom
---
shit, really? i thought u mained hibana on defence.
---

He already spawnpeeks with the shotgun and the automag. An acog on his aug wouldn't change much besides making the aug not bad.
---
They would get so much hate if they took it off lol 
---
I already bottom out my FOV and it's often not enough but 60hz is nowhere near enough for tracking at super close range especially since I have a really bad tremor.
---
In 440 hours in Siege, I have experience extremely little of any of those. Except teamkilling, but yes there's a lot of teamkilling in the one AAA competitive shooter that takes place in incredibly tight spaces and allows teamkilling.
---
What platform? ( add me plz ) 
---
Is this inspired by **this is your brain on bandit**
---
I mean I don't hate her now it just caught me off guard lmao. I was one of the people that didn't complain about her being ugly before.

I need a Mira in my life....I am really lonely!!!!

Hell yeah bro, hard breaching my own bomb site is my favorite hobby.
---
Depends on how much fps u normally get
---
when your buck sees it too tho
---
Exactly my goal bro. That and to bench 10 plates.
---
Why do you keep saying that?
---
She already is protected to hers tho
---
The reason I like defending/attacking 3 times in a row is because it allows you to retry stats or adapt to your enemies, I feel like people will leave when losing either way, but I think ubisoft should be more punishing on those who leave ranked matches early 
---
I think its because of the iran in it. So sorry about that.
---
lmao just nerf the smurf 
---
1- people can still spam qqe-eeq. Takes an hour or 2 longer, but it is still bullsh*t easy.
---
2- old method involved "animation cancel", which "supposedly" caused hitbox warping.
---
The new one solved the warpoing, but was more easily spammable. With the TTS one, there is a camera issue which they are fixing moving the camera position on the face again.
---
Yup, been there and done it myself. At first I felt confusion, then I felt dread. 
---
I'm at 971 personally, so maybe I'm just incredibly unlucky in this game and lucky in others, it's possible.
---
I'm honestly really looking forward to the team-damage reflection system they're bringing because I still hold by this game being too soft on toxicity and team-killing.
---
Those were on xbox, i recently switched to PC 2 months ago. Im only decent, i've had a 17 kills game on PC in silver 1/gold 4. My name is "urr_durr_ur_bad"

The Ash elite set is trash IMO, mostly the animation.

Good job on the MVP, though

The difference would hopefully be that this algorithm works. Unlike battleye.

You do know she was a Manlet before, don't you?
---
The cosmetics store page made her look like a man alongside echo.

This one is some serious anime stuff, and beefier. Me likey.

Funny but not really.

Did I mention low effort AF
---
Depending on the gun she carries 
---
Jager 😂😂
---
unfortunately no i dont know japanese, but i do get japanese lesson when im in highschool, too bad the teacher wasnt really good at teaching. :/ but one of my friends knows japanese very well, and sometimes just give this "random lecture" about japanese word everytime i watch anime, haha. but i do listen to him.
---
fookin amazing

That sounds like nightmare fuel....I want in

Yes it does

Just like they do it

It's okay Bruce, we know it's you.

Don’t really care what it makes me sound like. My accounts are sGuuch and CeefBurtain if you care to look them up. Both in silver. I couldn’t be a trybard if I wanted to. I’m not good enough.

play with randoms, or players closer to your own level. Why cater to the 1 diamond to the determent of the 5 guys hes playing against.

Tbh I don’t think we should choose maps, in games that let this happen the same map is played over and over again and there is little diversity creating a hierarchy and eventually a more bland game in my opinion

For once however the new ACOG that Gridlock has is also getting given to Capitao, so I can appreciate him getting added to the equation at least.

This post is wonderful

Oh god No

I’d love to make a digital copy of your final sketch if you just tag me/give me permission to do so :)

Damn these kids and their game sense, how dare they outsmart my spawn peek tactics, has to be hacking!
---
When update?
---
It would be a lot easier to rank up if I wasn't being queued up with plats.
---
Check the official Ubisoft stats page - if it says 0 there then we'll also have 0. If it doesn't say 0 I'll get it fixed! 
---
Length of magazine ain't a balance purpose 
---
I completely agree with you and, honestly, the hostility u/Xyphilis has shown in this thread has no place in our community. 
---
Word 'cunt' is getting censored as well, which is a disaster due to upcoming aussies release. How is it possible to play australian ops and not spam 'oi, ya cheeky cunt' in general chat?
---
What is this 'regular people'? In any case, it must be a joke I am too rich to understand.  
---
Any way its fun to at least get to play the new Ops a week before you get teamkilled for them
---
DBNO is how many times you have put someone into DBNO.
---
Weapon K/D is how many kills you have with a weapon vs how many times you have died to the weapon. Unfortunately Ubisoft don't provide data on how many times you have died wielding the weapon.
---
Also a mix of low ranks not knowing about Kapkan, and high ranks forgetting about Kapkan as he probably sees less play.
---
ela's scorpion.
---
kidding its ok. but borderline because its also horrifyingly inconsistent.
---
haha yeah those regular poor people that don't have the season pass march 12
---
Hey /u/cpt_sunstark, I really liked this art so I've crossposted it to /r/SiegeArt here: https://redd.it/avb1r6
---
The team killing is the thing I run into the most. I came from 800 hours on Xbox to PC and the first ranked match I played I got TKed because the Mira wanted to place a mirror with no barricade but didn't say anything to me.
---
psst..  you didn't post the thing... 
---
Her gun is amazing 
---
It still mitigates the issue of only one or two people being toxic. Its a good first step towards the issue not a half baked idea.
---
I mean but like also getting better in PC means getting a better monitor and better rig and better mouse and mousepad etc.
---
What's going on? I'm guessing you are making it sound like you are going away.

You know what's worse than that though? When people use that hack called recoil control. I've heard a lot of people use it, and I think it's sick. How dare they practice a gun to be able to use it well!

Oh lawd she comin

I hate that they even want to kick you for no reason

I problely have more tricked enemys then I have kills with her

Ohhhh ok

To me sharing it into a different sub is a crosspost and same-sub is a repost, but there's more than one way to define the terms. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
*pssst* *wait until march 5th for the new season so they're even cheaper*
---
Ah that makes sense. As good an idea as things like this are in theory, unfortunately they never seem to work the way they're intended because of limp-dicked assholes who blow their load every time they kill somebody 200 levels lower. 
---
I always queue solo because my friends just bought the game and are still level 30

In Portuguese (the Brazilian one) is kind of more offensive than bitch, can be a prostitute or more serious stuff like a girl that is interested in married mans, really sexualized stuff, but funny enough is also the name of the biting fish and a name of a city next to mine... things are weird around here i guess.
---
Shit, rule34 gonna kick in
---
Oh I didnt know that! Thanks. Who do you recommend me to buy when year 4 starts?
---
I think a lot of the time people are just being accused like yourself because they play with higher sensitivity and are pretty accurate at said sensitivity.
---
Albeit sometimes it is blatantly obvious that a M&amp;K is being used, I think we really just need to get on with it. It's a pain but by the sounds of it it's not going anywhere anytime soon.
---
I mean it wasn’t awful but I prefer the other one over the camrs

Looks like she ran into one of the new operators. https://i.imgur.com/O2CBDtC.jpg
---
I always say and keep saying that the best way to get rid of toxicity is harsh punishment such as permanent ban. End of the story. Win win situation for both ubisoft and legit players. Ubisoft earns extra money from toxic players that still want to play the game and hope they learnt their lesson to not be toxic anymore or else another permanent ban on his second account and players of course, no more dealing with toxicity. 
---
wait until the new season for the discount on ops, and i suggest you to buy mira because of her versatile gadget, strong guns, secondary shotgun. Then alibi, because she is easy to use, her guns has almost no recoil. Zofia is not bad, her guns are strong, can withstand when in dbno state (similar to ash but a bit worse). And kaid has a powerful ability, but i really dont like his guns (like bandit, but better). 
---
They are going to change the prices of ops in this year, but I’m not exactly sure, if it’s coming in this operation or the next one.
---
Ahh. My gf and I play pretty much daily. We’re both level 200+ 
---
Are you on PC? If so, whats your uplay?
---
R6Stats.com does not have an accuracy statistic for reasons detailed in earlier replies.
---
The accuracy you're talking about is shown on the official Rainbow 6 website.
---
I feel completely opressed because people forbid me to kill and steal!!!
---
You argue for freedom where it stands betweem the wellbeing of people. You aren't thinking.this through.
---
It is not fine and dandy and that is why people should not so it and why there is no problem forbidding it. Acting like it's fine and dandy is one of thrle reasons why many online games have such an extreme toxicity problem to begin with.
---
I’m on PS4 
---
But it's an aggregate system, so equal skill, on average, is guaranteed. If I'm at 5000 elo and play with a team at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 then our average elo is 2500, so we go against another team at that average MMR (approx. Gold 3?) 
---
That team could have the same setup (a diamond/plat/gold/silver/copper) or all be at gold 3. The overall ability in the game is, in theory, the same.
---
RIP lol it was worth a shot.

You leave my Doc's MP5 alone!

In theory. But it doesn't always work out like that. I'd love it if it did. I haven't been in a match like this for a long time, which is great, the system works most of the time. There *should* be restrictions on who you can queue with. A tier above and a tier below.
---
TBH I dont like votingsystems for maps. You will just play a few fan favourite maps and the rest gets ignored. Sure some maps are better than others, but I want to play every map (except for Yacht, I hate this one) and not just the "best" that everyone wants to play.

The trick is to write it cyrillic, because that's not censored.

But the smg is a primary too, so it wouldnt be unbalanced if it was stronger, since you cant use it with the dmr

Amen :)
---
the thing is, we have 5man stacks in siege so you just gonna vote next vote until you come to the one map the 5man have practiced. Very easily exploitable. 
---
I think they should just put all the maps up and as a team you get two ban 2 maps you dont wanna play and then then leave the rest to rng 
---
That's true but it's still full auto which, in a game where 1 shot headshots are a thing, is definitely a bonus (even tho the fire rate sucks ass as well so good luck aiming for heads) 
---
Spray n pray my dude.
---
The amount of players that don't read here is insane.. It says already it count many factors, not only KD. But people don't even bother to read anything.
---
It counts everything, revives, points per match, headshots, KD, MMR, wins, gadget deployments, reinforcing and many other factors!
---
Tuna sub

Its free weekend?

Center mass. Aim small miss small. Uhhhhh shoot where they’re going not where they are uhhhhhh headshots instakill ummm aim for crouch level so u can flick up or down easy

Happy cake day!

Correct me, if i’m wrong, but you’ve got 600 hours in siege?
---
Yes
---
Acog just adds more viewkick not actual recoil
---
There's only one guy in the group of friends (12-15 people) I play with who can and regularly play Ela.
---
Don't know how he does it.
---
Tbh supressor makes recoil a little bit better 
---
Operation health is basically a three month period of time in order to fixing and improving the game...
---
Make the boobies bigger lmao
---
It does not *really* increase it, you just get the feeling it does... you basically zoom in further and movement due to recoil increases
---
Yes, it’s just the zoom that makes you believe that.

theres a korean mangaka in japan, boichi, he drew the seinen / mahnwa "sun-ken rock". it contains some light sex scenes.

cant even see what those texts say cuz shit quality
---
What's ur sens? Like 1500dpi?
---
You must color it!
---
I WILL riot if it gets taken down 
---
ACOG "adds" recoil in the sense that with a zoomed scope, there is more view kick so he isn't exactly wrong. As for suppressor, on some guns it actually does help the recoil. It used to make the Alda have no recoil essentially but has been patched and that idea is wrong 
---
Really..😑😑
---
Right in the feels
---
I like your style 
---
its cool
---
Literally that. You summed it up quite well. They do that in casual, and will do in newcomer as well, where people supposed to learn the basics of PvP...
---
ACOG has higher perceived recoil, as in you feel the kick more since you're zoomed in, so I can see where he's coming from.
---
Suppressor is just wrong tho 
---
Mom says it's our turn on the Xbox.
---
Well done!!

Wtf! (What the fr*ck) I love these funny pictures of wacky video game characters getting into all sorts of trouble! It is not very epic of you to suggest that I think there in no comedic value whatsoever in these comic st*is... I thought you were a fellow gamer. Also please nerf fuze I keep getting blown up and there is no counter &gt;:((( My opinion about fuze is valid because I am a platinum player. ( I'm only silver right now but that's only because I solo queue I'm really good otherwise) 
---
Peace out gamers!
---
March 5th I think
---
Switch fuze and blitz
---
the video cut off quick once you were up there, but can you effectively see into that room next to objective?
---
Yeah, all of those ops seem useful on defense, especially in ranked. Thanks for the response👍
---
I love it..
---
finna sledge my meat
---
Nice bait, not taking it
---
To those saying personal preference,  I would stay away from this argument when it comes to comparing an acog with a 1 times.  All the scopes go hand in hand and there are many many advantages to an acog.  Versatility is the mark of a top tier player.  A really good player can put any scope on and frag. A really good player also succumbs less to having a main.  When I was in gold, my first season, I only ever played hibana and lesion.  Since meeting my current team (diamond) I have grown so much in order to satisfy different needs.  I can now play every meta attacker and defender and have a 1.5-2.8 KD with all of them. Sometimes my team plays vomit meta (g36c with red dot and silencer, p90 iron sights). It's not only funny but it helps you improve overall.  The less crutches you have the faster you will improve. 
---
I believe you are free to give them suggestions for things you think are useful. 
---
As far as I know their ranking system is only a few weeks old, so of course it can't be perfect yet. Maybe message OP here on reddit or discord and they might add your ideas.
---
Watched the vid and your reasons for quitting are understandable. Hope you find enjoyment elsewhere gaming or not.
---
I see you are getting a lot better at this. Keep up the good work. 
---
I'll be watching your career with great interest. 
---
It's amazing of how it is!

yeah you're right, I wouldn't do this strat either. x)

;p I'm shield main

 One shudders to imagine what inhuman thoughts lie beyond that mask. What dreams of chronic and sustained cruelty?

That's.. That's some dedication but i guess it was necessary

What's his height 
---
Yeah, I also love playing mute for the exact reason you stated. Thanks for responding👍
---
Is magnifies it, which in a way can be called "causing" more recoil.

No it’s a joke she looks at it like (comment)

Happy green triangle day!
---
Can you try reposting this for a third time?
---
I just tinkered around but about 30:30(x and y) and something for ads
---
I’m not sure, but I am sure that this is amazing!
---
To be honest I had this in mind, but I was thinking that certain other operators also do not work well in certain game modes and I was thinking that perhaps a creative player that would fancy this operator would probably find a way to use it in hostage game mode too, I mean I get you but unlinke fuze, this one at least does not kill the hostage.

Jager is able to counter almost every throwable item in the game. His pick rate is already high enough. This would just add another reason to pick him.
---
The knife animation starts from the left to right which i think is the problem and cause you to hit the shield instead and preventing any damage
---
Lesion, Ela, Echo
---
Just download some more ram. That should do the trick. 
---
He also got yacht t pose man removed 😥
---
I was under the impression he would stop the initial canister or whatever you want to call it in the air before it hit the ground and started deploying. Pretty crap that this isn't the case.
---
How can you tell me his ADS stops Ash's charge flying through the air but not this? smh.
---
The roni is considered worse because it has less ammo. In a game where you need one bullet to kill enemy bigger magazine multiplies your chances to kill. Of course if we exclude shitty hitreg which causes bullets to go straight through the head and do nothing.
---
But the chat detection is server sided. They could easily make different filters for different servers/regions.
---
So like people have different tastes right? Twitch and Hibana's faces make them look not so great in game. Twitch got a rework, it was only a matter of time Hibana would get one.
---
Half the point of this game is to sell cosmetics. The model they use is pretty important for that purpose so ensuring her face doesn't look mediocre is important.

So I can monitor my personal growth more closely. Maybe I like getting better at the game? Maybe having fresh stats has a better indication to me of how I have improved? Why doesn’t automatically have to be a bad thing because I have a new account?

But how can you say that when clash has a worse win rate then Tachanka and shes also more of a meme then him because her utility is basically useless as well other then being a monty on defense like big oof dude true they both need a rework but why cry ab Tachanka getting a skin when hes better then clash and shes getting a rework because shes worse and newer but shes still just as much of a meme at Tachanka because she’s just as trash but hey lets just rip on people for wanting a skin for an op 
---
[Jokes on you](https://imgur.com/a/7AYvfyK)

Honestly, that was a slighter issue that bothered me.  Thatcher throws a baseball into a room and it gets zapped.  Gridlock lobs a football into a room and the ADS has an existential crisis and can't figure it out.  Just the logic of it. 
---
Nah just good look. Prepare for not getting anything higher than a common for the next 5 months.

And that is why secure area is the worst game mode imo.

Yep, i would have really loved getting it too.

If you look up on youtube something like "all 753 alpha pack items" you can see the complete list of things you can find in the current alpha packs, and the older legendaries are not there anymore.

"I think a lot of that will come down to certain content creators. If it's seen as a funny video idea to go into newcomer playlist and troll new players and just destroy them for content, it could really harm the mode and game as a whole."
---
that already happens a lot on this sub, and judging by all the upvotes those videos get, people love it. I've seen quite a few top posts of obviously experienced players playing against new/very very bad players and trolling them 
---
Every op has a gun, no? Then every one of them is a counter, because neither can destroy it with his/her gadget... it needs one (ONE) bullet, to destroy all of the traps if you are lucky, or 2-3 to make an easy way through and potentially even bait the attacker who will peek the traps location where he heard the shots from
---
Only play on a few good maps without the need to compete for rank? Shit sigh me up. 
---
i remember the time i played with a bunch of lv 2's. it was on tower and half of them accidently stumbled their way to the bottom level and spent the next 2 minutes trying to find the staircase while the hostage was being stolen.
---
Oh. Ok.
---
Repost due to typo 
---
Which is why it’s not going to be available for all guns.  Its objectively better than every other non-zoom sight.  Same reason the scope is on the M249 and nothing else.  If those two could be used on all guns they’d be the only two sights used in the game.
---
It looks absolutely amazing and the style works well with glaz's face paint.

Everyone here needs to shut their mouths you're taking my easy kills. In all seriousness though, never stand still. Way to easy to line up a headshot

I'm Canadian too and the imperial system is hard because it uses arbitrary relationships between units. So while I use feet/inch/pounds in my daily life, what the hell is a fluid oz vs a gallon? Why is a yard equal to three feet? When you say pounds, are you using pound-mass or pound-force? The issue is that there is no consistency in the imperial system whereas the metric system is very clear on what you're using and their relationship with everything within that category.

And plus, she has a pocket DMR handgun, Jäger has a normal handgun and Vigil's got high recoil secondary SMGs.  The Keratos is without a doubt better than Jäger's handgun and both of Vigil's secondary SMGs.
---
&gt;I still stand on my point that while shields might work in some scenarios, the lethality of a c4 will always be better, barbed coming in second imo. Also the uselessness of a shield is most cases is also why the are reworking it
---
That's a good point, I can agree that C4 is useful, but it isn't *always* more useful.  Like, if I'm playing Valk, for example, and we have an Alibi on our team, I will *always* pick the shield over the C4 so that her Prismas will be more effective, because she now has 2 shields to put her Prismas behind instead of one, allowing her to more effectively block entrances and sightlines, as well as forcing the attackers to waste even more utility because now there's two prismas behind two separate shields instead of one prisma behind one shield. And if we have a Jäger on the team?  Put an ADS behind those shields, and that's it man.  Put both shields in the doorways in obj with a Prisma and ADS behind each one.  Good fuckin luck getting through that without getting scanned.  I've done that before and it is soooooo effective.  I've also played against it and it made me wanna throw my controller.  At that point, there isn't a single thing that can destroy it, because the third ADS will be somewhere in OBJ, so it'll snipe the grenade mid-air, even if you try and throw it in front of the shield.
---
However, if there *isn't* an Alibi, or someone else that benefits from a deployable(like, if we have a lot of roamers), then I'll go with the C4.
---
It's all about context.  What's your team like?  What does your team need?  Things like that.

Look at the pose – how it accentuates her breasts and arse, the ditsy way she's dressed –  how can you not see it?

Also the Ela drawing you did, the cleavage on show, she's meant to be part of an elite SWAT team, would a police officer wear that?

I'm Italian and here the imperial system is something that normal people don't even know that exist. And I know that it exist because of Reddit...I studied in a technical institute and we never ever eared this shit. Now I'm curious...how the fuck do you convert a nanometer in imperial? Is something like 1/2 pubic hairs? 
---
I want to start with thanks for being logical and not suggesting a heavy nerf right away.  I’m not an echo “main” but I really love using him because he’s such an active anchor. So the best couple pieces of advice I can give you are these. 
---
1. make sure at least one person is twitch, thatcher or IQ. Echo can be very intimidating with his drones but he can be countered he best by thatcher. Because his AOE is rather large for his EMP you don’t need to precisely know where his drone is. Twitch works well too but you have to see the Yokai drone to shoot it but you don’t need to worry about an ads. Lastly IQ for obvious reasons. Once you get more comfortable with him you will need less of those ops if any.
---
2. grenades are fantastic for somewhat tight angles from door ways or you can throw them behind echos shield to kill him/flush him out.
---
3.piggy backing off of 1, make sure that you push with someone because if you get hit you have someone to a. Shoot at someone rushing at you or echo rushing at you. And b. Have someone cover your flank from roamers. Again preferably one of the ops from point 1. 
---
4. If you don’t have anyone with you and aren’t twitch, thatcher or IQ, drone out the immediate area you’re going to push. So example would be Oregon basement lots of people put Yokai on that turn of stairs so you can’t see it. If you’re by garage drone out that immediate door to see if someone will hit you when you first enter then, the turn and then by washing machine. It’ll be hard to spot them first but you’ll get use to it. Look for discoloration And waves is the best thing I can suggest. Even knowing where the drone is can help position yourself so you can maybe hide from it and make it move so you can see it go to the ceiling and then shoot it. 
---
5. One thing lots of people forget is that most times he’s above a soft floor so you can shoot through it or use bucks skeleton key or other explosives to flush him out also. I’ve been killed a decent amount of time from that. An example of this is on skyscraper in tea room where most people hide in yellow. If you go downstairs by the upturned table near bathroom and shoot that hits under there. Make him feel as uncomfortable as his Yokai makes you. 
---
6. If you do get hit the more you move the more the effect has on you. A lot of time people will get hit and run but if you stay still people don’t expect it and your vision isn’t too messed up. Especially if your in a 1v2+. People get over confident when they get someone concussed.
---
6. My final point and the most important part is don’t wait too long to push him. Lots of times people wait way too long and then have to push get Yokaied and can’t see because the movement makes it worse. He has a pretty large recharge so if you can get them to waste his charges you can recover and then push without getting hit again. If you push earlier you won’t be as panicked and rush in the last 4 seconds of a round. 
---
Hope this helps and if you’re on ps I can show you common echo spots so you can learn to know where to look

Cause that Pro League set was released during Blood Orchid, and (atleast) since Velvet Shell, PL uniforms always had the flags of that season's country.
---
Looollll XDDD 😂😂😂
---
LWAY
---
yay im a butt
---
Wasn't it also supposed to do with something like team rainbow being under NATO command and it's a NATO standardization for weapons? which is why Spetsnaz have different sights? 
---
I don't mind the different sights that much but what does bother me is the absurdity of some of the sights they make available to specific weapons. Like you said the acog on revolvers, Acog for kaid's shotty etc.... all the while they haven't done anything about how horrible and bulky the original red dot sight is to use. 
---
No only because I don’t think Ubi would actually change anything about the ops in that short period of time. Nomad has been in pro league quarantine for like 3 months now and despite pretty much all of the pro league teams saying she needs a nerf they haven’t touched her since the TTS

So i cannot say female dog any more?

Well, thanks?

Honestly he could use a buff to. I think his damage for the laser is to low for being out in the open and easily counterable
---
Why did this just kill me lmfao.... DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOIL\*
---
Ranked is.
---
I'm pretty sure the stairs on that map move about like they do in Hogwarts...
---
No, that's the whiff animation. The hit animation is a much shorter jabbing motion.
---
When i get ran up on while i have smg or a shotgun im a sniper usually always wins. Especially in ww2 id rather come face to face with a shotgun than a kar98k. Ghosts came the closest to what a real sniper should be, not a quickscoping sniper running around outgunning an fully auto gun
---
 Can they give capitao a pirate elite
---
The missed animation would be just my knife slashing through the air, this animation was the game assuming I was hitting the shield.
---
wait, what is it?
---
I think Badger himself is ok. Most of the time his commentary is well written, timed, and delivered without much excess. It's really all of his hype dudes that make dumb jokes and then GUFFAW at each other non-stop. I particularly hate it when one of them makes a joke, and then someone else repeats it verbatim but with an angrier or louder voice. 
---
However, I do agree that old badger was best badger. I really enjoyed his BF3/4 stuff, back when he didn't have a full crew with him.
---
ah yeah i get the point, im just gonna be straight, i. love. drawing. women. and yeah sometimes it is over-sexualised. honestly i dont even know that this stupid drawing i made gonna get many attention,(seriously this is literally the first time i had comments in one of my artworks) and i never thought things like "hey police officer not gonna wear this right?" because i just want to draw what i want to draw. yes, maybe its illogical and im sorry for that. but srsly i respect any of your opinion :) so again, im sorry if my drawing, perhaps bothered you in any way. cheers, and have a good day!

Kinda coincidental that in the brazillian season (skull rain) there was [a seasonal skin called piranha](https://i.redd.it/nq5a1t0jf7yy.jpg).
---
Why not take the ACOG off the shotgun and the pistols for him and Nomad and just put an ACOG on his AUG? Could be a decent thing to test out in the TTS and see feedback on it.
---
&gt;When i get ran up on while i have smg or a shotgun im a sniper usually always wins. Especially in ww2 id rather come face to face with a shotgun than a kar98k.
---
Yes, because it's a *one shot.*
---
&gt;Ghosts came the closest to what a real sniper should be, not a quickscoping sniper running around outgunning an fully auto gun
---
But that's an issue with the perk Quickdraw, not the snipers itself.  So the snipers aren't an issue, it's the perks.  Siege doesn't have perks, therefore a CoD style sniper rifle would work in Siege.
---
Thicc af indeed

the best meme creator for siege is microwave gaming, he is the one who created the lord meme, and bird box glitch (the name), and many other
---
Was just thinking it would be a cool little change though 
---
But you knife immediately after pressing the melee button, so when you initially press the Right stick to lean, how does the game know whether you want to knife or lean? 
---
Yeah but then you cant kick a player thats being toxic or just plain shit, and what if youre getting tkd by someone who is with a squad then they cant be kicked
---
Because I can't draw for shit. I just like to brag
---
If you get the new Ops, good luck trying to play them with everyone else doing the same.

Why is everyone so concerned with absence of hip-leaning on Console?

And the thermite baits the throw, doesn't finish placing it, and thatcher destroys the electroclaw

The thing is, glaz was performing too wl in a ro'e he shouldn't perform all too well in.
---
Glaz should be used a long ranged, sneaky and static operator but he became one of if not the best late game pusher in the game. They had to rework him a bit and I think this is fine
---
yep, ghost recon and the division are the only ones i´ve found. But from what i understand they are in 3rd Person mostly?

It would be a massive difference in time 🤔 melee doesn’t take 1-2 seconds to do 
---
How can we see the results?
---
Underrated comment string. 
---
I don't want to agree with you because ADS already does **way** too much , but I gotta agree because the Trax is technically under the criteria for zapping.
---
Maybe they copy-pasted lesion's Gu and never changed it so the ADS recognizes it as an enemy gadget
---
DAMM BOI SHE THICC 
---
When people run out from under they will sweep that whole wall.
---
You maycgo unnoticed but that depends on opponents gamesense/map knowledge which varies by rank.
---
Mute... and that problem will occur with the way it is, my way, and reverse damage.
---
I've contacted support and they say it's a "known issue" and the development team is working on it.

This has only happened since the new store came around.

It wouldn't feel that smooth though

That is a very realistic answer I have to say.  That is very Ubi.

Keep playing thunt but try to onetap most enemies

Should have one regular drone and one mozzie controlled drone. Even though lion would probably win.
---
Casual in a nutshell
---
Exactly mate
---
Google "rainbow six the hammer and the nail" it'll probably come up.
---
Welp, alright. Try the solutions I have written above. Hope you get your problem fixed soon...cuz mine is hopeless. Unless ubisoft changes this 'Macro Fraudulent Activity Detector' or whatever this shit is called. Hope they remove my block so badly tho 😂👌
---
It’s for balance. If Zofia’s pistol sight was on all guns, there would be no reason to ever use the others. 
---
You are misunderstanding. Go into the game now and press the melee button, measure how long it takes for you to melee. It happens instantly. 
---
So when you press the right stick down, you will immediately knife and then will you lean
---
The only way this could possibly work is if a small delay was added to the knife, but considering knifing is a last ditch effort to kill someone on close quarters, adding a delay is about the worst possible thing that ubi could do

---
It doesn't even look remotely close to the concept art when choosing ops
---
This is fiction bruh come on
---
Meanwhile they either dont watch or completly ignore Rouge-9.
---
r/R6OperatorCreater
---
Cool idea!
---
Probably seeing if people are repelling on the far right side,since the mira wouldn't cover it
---
It already is...
---
Something like 21 rounds, right?
---
That’s not concept art, I believe that was the original menu for velvet shell.
---
Lmfao you're to stupid to insult. The second you doubled back on your own quote was the moment I knew you were just an idiot, and still, you apparently haven't realized haha

Meanwhile in wood 4 rank
---
&gt; which is exactly what they don’t wanna do
---
*cough*Ash*cough*Finka 
---
Oh sorry, I just had a little tickle in my throat
---
Yeah most players don't have what I would consider a full working knowledge of the game until at least 120+. Hell most people by then still aren't using the destructible terrain to it's fullest so it's all still a crap shoot.
---
There’s a reason they didn’t add jumping into the game
---
WHERE IS SHE!?!
---
&gt; Lmfao you're to stupid to insult
---
At least bother to spell the sentence correctly when you're trying to insult someone's intelligence.
---
&gt;The second you doubled back on your own quote
---
This should be funny. Show the rest of us where you think this happened?
---
*Laughs with a proning Maverick*
---
Well if you really knew the book which this game is a sequel to (kind of) the original teams have us navy seal, sniper (unknown nation) 2 sas ops, paratrooper from France (not gign but DGSE) GSG9, and 2 delta force operators. So I’m theory they didn’t have to add other nations but choose to. The US has the best military and counter terrorism forces in the world and we provide military support all ocer the world. It makes sense to have the most from our nation compared to others. Not saying others don’t contribute but that’s why we have more. I think Ubi is doing a good job representing other nations as well as being accurate to real counter terrorism operations
---
Heck you're right this was the main screen, I knew it was a little bit familiar...
---
asian potato woman.
---
But we still have ops like Finka, Jäger, Ash, and Blitz in game, so it doesn't matter.  It's still turning into CoD
---
What rank
---
Plat 3 on xbox 
---
It's not that it's hard. It's just fucking stupid and arbitrarily complex. What's easier, knowing that there's 12 inches in one foot and then 3 feet in one yard and so on, or just going off on increments of 10 and 100 and 1000? 
---
It's why scientifically and mathematically, everyone uses the metric system cause the imperial system is fucking stupid.
---
Yes it is fiction. That's why it really doesn't matter as to how is in the game. The CTU has no effect on the gadget of the operator. So why does it matter if they add another American CTU? Oh yeah
---
**it doesn't**
---
i will post it on this subreddit again ofc!
---
Brother give me two number 9’s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45’s, one with cheese and a large soda.
---
Finka was made around PvE, jager stops projectiles, ash is just a killing machine, and they’re fixing blitz, they realized their mistake and are working away from it
---
I literally quoted you hahahaha shit dawg, you're a riot
---
Trap that shoots out a shit ton of maple syrup and slows down attackers. Elite mounty riding in on a moose 
---
y u bully me
---
Well to be fair it's a sort of buff, on the flip side as an attacker getting hit once close range before taking her out won't be as punishing anymore. Easier to survive Gu mines and electrified walls when you have 40 HP instead of 1.
---
Don't be a bitch
---
I don’t understand, how’re you playing with the new characters thought they didn’t come out till March 
---
Show me where you think this happened...
---
1) Being toxic, why would you even jump out the window? What’s out there they need do? 
---
2) Why the fuck do people still do this shit? Haven’t people seen or heard enough of these stories? Every time someone tries shit like that on my team, in casual, with ransoms, everyone else yells at them to stop and just kill the dude. 
---
Apart from checking doors you can also listen. I don't know how many people know this but kapkan traps make a distinct noise, but it's not very loud.
---
Or a drone called the beaver that chews through walls eh
---
Instant karma
---
Thanks for the advice, I can probably get out of bronze with that
---
Story of my life:
---

---
No girls like short guys
---
Be loud, vulger, overly comedic and overly flirtatious

Now only data women taller than him
---
TTS on pc allows you to test the new season so that it can be balanced 
---
Attacker that shoots explosive hockey pucks at walls that destroy reinforced walls
---
Waaaaaiittt. 2 Twitch drones?
---
Ahhhh I see, very epic 
---
yeah, what a bunch of bitches
---
But they still *made* those mistakes.  Blitz is still a thing, Finka is still a thing, and Ash is still a thing.
---
Ash is pretty much every CoD player ever.  Just rush in and kill shit.  She even has flashbangs, just like the CoD rushers(not saying she's OP, just saying she's basically the embodiment of Call of Duty)
---
Jäger is just Ash on defense(although without the flashbangs.
---
Finka was designed around PvE, but she's still the embodiment of CoD(rush in right away and kill shit)
---
They're fixing Blitz, but as of right now he isn't fixed yet, so he's *still* a problem.
---
They're working to fix them, yes, but they're still there.  
---
1. Smaller hitbox is effectively bullshit, and unless the differences are significant enough (like Hibana's Type-89), assault rifles are never "far superior".
---
2. If you're finding the recoil on the M4 problematic, I don't know what to say to you.
---
3. All of those gadgets are very situational, destroying the barbed wire is effectively useless as it still does what the Defenders intended you to do, and Bulletproof Cameras are effectively useless, someone can easily walk up to them and melee or shoot them from the side, although true, Maestro's Evil Eyes are much more difficult, but that's INCREDIBLY situational.
---
4. 3 speed makes fuck all for difference.
---
5. Resorting to offensive language? Geez, aren't you polite?
---
6. Buck IS the best outside of specific circumstances, Sledge is better for newer players due to a more controllable weapon (and is also better at breaking open barricades and more reliable at hollowing floors), Zofia gets two Stun Grenades that are much better than normal Stuns, as well as the option of Breaching Charges or a Claymore.
---
I’m American, and I don’t think we don’t need our dicks sucked every year by giving us an American operator just because we’re their largest player base. They may be scared of complaints, who knows, but I’m betting if there were 8 German ops compared to 4 American you guys wouldn’t be quiet about that.
---
Lmao this is the best one

Stahp please ahahaha I can't laugh any harder, it's in quotes! I quoted it, in the quotation marks "it's entirely irrelevant" jeeeeeeze you're thick-skulled, don't know what quotation marks are? I was going to drop this, but now it's get entertaining 
---
Where are you from? We probably sustain your military efforts for the last 70 years 
---
This went from what I thought was going to be an honest remorse for uninstalling and regretting your actions, to a bumper filled shitpost that is cram packed with ranting. Why?
---
Jesus fuck...
---
And, in your mind, how did I double back on it?
---
Writing the korean letters like that doesn't make sense.
---
[This one](https://i.redd.it/80y4rv4thw521.jpg)
---
Only if I had friends. But some personalities can't just play for fun like me. As said, I would be fine if I lose 200mmr with constant 2wins out of 5games but that's not the case.
---
Didnt they remove the Haha gay jukebox though? 
---
Who is FuzeGang anyway, is he/she saying that did it?! 🤣
---
Ohh man..  why don't you take the time to read the entire article?  it's not just an nade, every second gadgets. and primary gadgets expect for ash and zofia (I have detected)  Why Ash and Zofia can do it while other operators can not.  
---
No it’s parked in a garage it’s definitely off lmao
---
she didn't arm it correctly 
---
A big problem is that many secure area players think the meta strat there is to wall off the whole thing and all anchor or all roam. Secure area becomes way more interesting when every spot is played like kid's bedroom on house, where everything is opened up to turn obj into a no man's land
---
A lot of people who exclusively play secure area just want to play TDM or just don’t have the game sense to play bomb/hostage
---
There is no secure in PL tho, sorry about your wish my dude
---
Communication; learn the maps and callouts. If you want to learn a specific map, go into a custom game with the timer set on 10 minutes and walk around the map and learn the room names.
---
You can rush but in Gold you will notice that it's not as effective as in silver and below, so be ready to play the game "properly" at some point.
---
Play in a team with people you can trust and communicate with.
---
"Here's looking at you kid"
---
I have all of them except for the safari bundle, the emerald one, and the orange one that no ones likes 
---
I used to care about my rank in year 1 and I would be an arsehole to my friends. Then I realized that my rank means nothing, especially with the game not doing any real matchmaking for parties vs solos, and allowing fake coppers with plats etc. When you accept ranked is a joke your blood pressure and rage will come down. 
---
&gt;The greatest race of all time!!!
---
***Not cool, bro. Not cool.***
---
blah blah has been removed from the match 
---
blah blah blah has left the game 
---
I want to be mad at this and also considerate to other players because I just got this game can somebody explain what's going on
---
They're not, you're just being bomb elitist and that's quite sad. 
---
It's one thing to play around with your opponent after a clutch. It's another entirely to have Kapkans this ass in your face multiple times while he does a Russian Jig on your corpse
---
It's great! I love em
---
What?
---
His friend was on the hatch not the defuser
---
It happens in bomb too.
---
Would also like to know how to do this. Friend has a Vega 11 and she is having this happening in game. 
---
There's a reason we have so many hours and don't play ranked lol, we like to have fun and screw around.
---
Had someone on the enemy flame me for putting down a claymore in a 2v1 (two on my team).
---
"What the fuck was the point of that claymore"
---
Did the same thing next round, last guy backed into it 1v1 against our bottom fragger with 5hp. Won the match. 
---
Here is what I could find about this proximity alarm: https://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-siege-teases-stealthy-danish-operator-and-proximity-alarm-gadget/
---
Haha, now that would be upsetting. Especially because I’ve been a part of the community longer than most of the mods. Not that it means anything, but still..
---
Either way this post isn’t to attack them, as they’re doing their job and attempting to keep the rules, I just believe the rules need some editing. 
---
how about all the fucking sights ??
---
Was not expecting some tasty UbiPasta in here, thanks man! First post on the sub!
---
 I Only play bomb in ranked
---
what about it? do you not know the definition of the word proximity? it'll be based on how close you are.
---
What a loop
---
Wtf is that recoil recoil control 
---
That looks really nice! Keep up the good work!
---
In bomb the player is busy with a 7 second defuse instead of just standing in the room though
---
You might want another stick of ram, and then overclock the ram. Also, you should have gotten a 2600 instead
---
thank you this is perfect size for desktop background.
---
What if we could use 100% of our brains?
---
The same can be said about secondary gadgets.  Flashbangs and smokes?  Same as regular grenades. The only ones that makes sense are deployable shields and barbed wire.  They can put theirs away because their gadgets are grenade launchers.  They can just put away their grenade launcher.
---
Rank means nothing. Siege for siege, not for status.
---
The game is punishing you for using a laser. Never ever use a laser for anything’s except shield pistols. 
---
Not a big Ying player, but I was proud of my glorious wtf moment lol
---
Yeah I understand what « proximity » means haha
---
It’s just that since it’s nit already in the game, I was wondering what it could be 
---
TBchoi and sunstark OC in one day. We've been blessed today. All we need now is Nasuskim.
---
I mean, did anyone really think they were gonna leave her face like that
---
I got it because it is on sale at micro center for $100
---
No they are just saving to the elite to sell more
---
I play with shottys on defense a lot (but not on attack).  I have seen some people run shottys on attack, and they seem to do well (mostly Thermite, Lion, and Finka).  Do you run a shotty a lot on attack, and regularly do well?  I was thinking of giving it a try.

Maybe he’s using the blindfold headgear and it’s glitching out 
---
Dont color it just take my money!
---
Here's a better idea: allow me to play god damn T-hunt offline! Perfect game for when I'm away from the internet, but NOOOOOO, people would be cheating somehow and make renown. I don't care about currency, just remove it completely during offline mode and let me play!
---
Totally right. To be fair, I even hesitated a looot before buying Echo (was looking for Maestro at first.)
---
The price was what made my final decision.
---
I think I’ll really consider buying Zofia since both her primary and secondary are awesome, her gadget is so good and her « passive » is really useful.
---
Mozzie looks really good as well.
---
Imagine downvoting me and then blatantly lying lul
---
I’m not sure but saying that ur screen goes bluish when u use ur ability it probably gets that blue tint while ur using the ability
---
His loadout looks really good, I look more into him.
---
Pulse for gridlock  doc for finka. Smoke for jackal.
---
You missed
---
Maestro looks really useful, harassing p’ayers with the laser and gathering all this intel is game changing. 
---
I know but it would look much nicer if he just had it in the customisations menu
---
You make a fair point and I’m inclined to agree, which I do fully. 
---
However, my main problem with this is that I feel she’s decently proportional to her character model. You’re absolutely right that it’s archaic and should be changed, the view towards this type of art. But I feel that calling out a picture for being overtly sexual because it has defined body parts plays on exactly what you’re arguing against. 
---
The revealing shirt and possibly the pose? Yes, overly sexual. But just capturing the model of a women? Ehhh, not so much. 
---
I really underestimated kapkan. Now he is my defense main
---
Plat 3 atm
---
But you have to buy all the y2&amp;3 ops. Not to mention everyone tries to pick the new ops.
---
You're welcome! I've been playing with a lot of new friends lately and this is a really common question I even made a YouTube video about it. 
---
I was kinda thinking capitao (not sure how to spell his name) as he can be a good area denial OP but I’m not too sure about it, what do you think?
---
go fuck yourself ubisoft i play ps4 and is a frustacion for players i can t pay for season pass and i wait for them and test server yes is very good job is a bullshit man 
---
I think that this is the cenario alarms not a new operator.
---
r/cursedvideos
---
The problem is, people don't read text. They watch videos. That post won't get any traction. The post I had gained lots of traction, but was removed. It's all good. 
---
For new players, it shouldn’t. Everything is intended.
---
Seen better shit. 6/10
---
If you have a good Jager to put ADS by the evil eyes it's a huge addition to prevent Ash and Zofia from tagging them. 
---
Aw I was expecting it to go through the wall
---
No it hit the steel 
---
That's a sick angle
---
No
---
For the TTS? 
---
End of wind bastion, when burnt horizon launches it's gonna be unavailable.
---
Which blocks it
---
Thanks, that was my first time ever using it lol
---
If anyone in your clan has R6 teams we are hosting a tournament on PC. Feel free to join our server and message a show host for details!
---
We would love to have as many of you come out as you like 👍
---
He shot the steel and his bullets hit me
---
Whelp. That was Ubisofts official response to it. 
---
But sure thing, random people on Reddit know more about the engines capabilities than the people working on the game. Sick.
---
Oh, didn't know that. In that case he is toxic :D
---
What about aspect ratio, fov sliders and better FPS 
---
Ash's breaching charges too. 
---
I used kills to simplify my comment as it's not the point. My point was, when teammates are useless, they drag you down with them 
---
My rank is not the point, but if you really want to know: yeah. I rarely play ranked and mostly with my gold friend and I do fine on his level. My problem is not lack of skill, but it's inconsistency. And as I stated, I recognize my mistresses and I don't complain on my team often. Again, not the point of discussion.
---
That us why i never ever do stuff like that. Just kill the guy and win the dam round dont try n act cfunny cause shit like this happens 
---
No I'm not wrong. You wrote a reply that was a wrong and I corrected it. If anything I'm negative wrong

For being left-handed, I would like to see this be an option for Siege.

Jager is autistic?

Same

Rounds have a time limit.
---
People started talking about how all the new, gun-specific sights wouldn't be balanced on every gun really quickly, but I don't see how that affects their ability to make new, balanced sights to be used on the pre-existing guns. I've wanted a better looking Acog alternative and a 1.5x sight for literal years now.
---
Don’t be a toxic idiot on any round. 
---
FIFY. 
---
Listen you ate butt hurt about it. I've said i wrote the reply wrong. Get over it 😚
---
Bring it back
---
From what I remember from the last Kapkan nerf/buff (however you want to interpret it) placing them at the bottom does reduced damage.
---
I was going to make a joke about being "bad like me" but....I'm not even that bad at siege. 
---
Lol yep, but I bet he's a feisty little piranha haha
---
If you worked at Ubisoft what would you do to fix it?
---
As long as they’re realistic I’m fine with it. I don’t want clips flinging in the air and then slams it in. This isn’t fortnite/cod
---
I'm willing to bet 50 schmeckles that there was never a corridor there and the art department just photoshopped an open door there for this cool menu image. That's all.
---
I think for purposes of it not looking goofy as hell I'd prefer the Nomad red-dot for the Sterling and Cav's gun. The FMG could definitely pull of the slim Holo look though.
---
If they're removing it what are they replacing it with, just upgrading all starter edition players to standard? 
---
I have also predicted it 
---
*You can stop worrying about social cues now*
---
You need to experiment with YOUR settings. The more practice you get, the more you will adjust it from day to day. 
---
Personally I’m at 
---
1800dpi with both at 13, ADS at 80
---
I started at 5/5 ADS 65 last year and have slowly bumped it up over time. But, your sens needs to work with how YOUR brain and hands want to move together, if you get what I’m saying. 
---
For me it seems suppressors make my recoil more circular if that makes sense? 
---
In real life, high stake operations (see bin laden raid) like this often take place under complete darkness.  I don't get kids' complaints about not being able to see. That's what makes it fun and sweaty.  Bring back night maps. I want even dark maps with night vision capability (but balanced) make it to where activating it gives you away, maybe faint glow.
---
Hack the matrix
---
why are you insulting reddit karma?
---
2 post above same post gg upvote whore
---
And the amount of comments you've ignored explaining the primary flaw in any system attempting to measure personal skill is equally insane:
---
* Many actions in a round are totally immeasurable - for example, the game will never be able to properly provide a score to a roamer for wasting a significant portion of the round but never landing a point of damage.  It won't be able to work from a callout.
---
* Many actions do not have a clear disposition as far as their outcome on the round - for example, placing a Mira window on a wall that attackers can get to from above/below may or may not be a net positive for the defenders. Even if the attackers pop it relatively early, the game won't know how much of a benefit it did provide to the defenders before (and possibly even after) it was compromised.
---
* Many positive actions you take may have been solely the result of a teammate's action - for example, should you receive more points for killing an enemy than the Fuze whose cluster charge forced the defender to expose himself?
---
\*Facepalm\*
---
Incorrect. in the eyes of Ubisoft a “spawnpeek” is when a defender has an angle directly into an attacker spawn and can shoot and kill them as soon as they are dropped into the game. This is not counter-able at all and is uncompetitive and toxic. They have been removing this from maps for years.  Just peaking out windows and killing and attacker can never be removed from a map unless they just remove all windows or doors which is also uncompetitive. Peeking out windows while frustrating can be countered by an attacker which makes it competitive. It’s also not difficult at all to peek from windows on outback there are plenty of windows and doors to do this from. 
---
Predictions:
---
Twitch would have won a fair game.
---
But Echo ddosed every other competitor 
---
Don't forget Pulse's heartbeat sensor!
---
And that’s why you use an lmg kids
---
Yeah, the whole 360 thing won’t really apply much to this game, you normally won’t survive long enough in a situation where you’ll be making that big of a direction change. You shouldn’t be in that bad of a position anyway 😅
---
One of my favourite maps in the game. Not every site is balanced, but they’re fun either way
---
I used to reach plat every season but I'm having much more fun not caring about my rank and not having to sweat my way to plat for the past two seasons. 
---
Well let's see:
---
He has brought more jobs back to the American people
---
Put Black unemployment at an all-time low.
---
Poverty is the lowest it's been in 50 years.
---
He has been apart of an investigation that has failed to conjure up anything since his election.
---
He's taken good care of the American people that want to work and contribute to society.
---
He's lowered taxes and raised the GDP by amounts thought impossible.
---
Approval rating just recently surpassed 56%, higher than Obama this late in his first term
---
Democrats have shown how desperate they are and given their hand by forcing fake controversy after controversy. 
---
Democrats have shown they do not want to meet half way on Immigration reform, abortion, taxes, and have gone all in on Socialism. 
---
Who is going to beat him Bruce? Breadline Bernie? He won't make it past primaries. Kamala Harris? She barely can stand her ground, especially since shes used to being on her knees for her positions. Elizabeth Warren? Shes so out of touch she has to make cringy facebook live videos to seem relatable. Beto? He's had a few run ins with the law, like that time he was involved in a hit and run.
---
You really are in over your head if you think that the whirlwind that is Trump is stopping anytime soon bud.
---
Flair checks out.
---
Nope.  It's SUPPOSED to be what you say but it's clearly MPH and MPH.  The graphics person just got lazy and spliced two MPH gauges to the cluster.
---
Its good
---
\*deep breath\*
---
REAL SHIT
---
Maybe they should be a different color though, what if a defender breaks one down without any knowledge that there is someone in the room? Possibly just a really subtle difference, like the screws on the yellow strips on the side could be like blue or red instead of gray.
---
Yep that's me, 11 years old. I flick the bean on the reg.
---
Where did you hear that? I think everything is just rumor ar this point, but I do recall reading that every operator will be discounted, which makes sense considering they're super expensive.
---
What’s your gamer tag 
---
Some guy did the same thing to me and I forgot I still had a heal ahot on medic and got up and killed him as he was setting up a something o  the wall.
---
Read the operator backstories. You’ll find that a lot of operators have really interesting stories. As for the community, It’s special to say the least.
---
Spetznas then
---
o Void3d 
---
Buck, because I thought his recoil was insane and gadget useless, now if anyone takes home in my game that I'm talking to, I shit u not I can guarantee a te if they dont get off
---
Am I the only one here who only teabags players if they're being toxic as shit first? 
---
I usually just kill a downed player and be done with it.  No extra shit like this Kapkan did.
---
It's obnoxious as shit. Piss off.
---
He isnt even picked once on SI
---
His ability is a nightmare for me. My shotgun wont do shut. 9 out of 10 times I already used my frags, and it always flips me a bird in the final seconds
---
\-Reeeees in German-
---
POWWWAAA
---
Not possible in Ranked
---
Whats a smurf? 
---
What happen to her not having a hitbox? This is clearly a fake clip.
---
A fellow Monty main. This is truly the way to stop a Monty from kicking your ass.
---
would love to hear the banter after this
---
He sounds more like an aspie. Am an aspie, can confirm.
---
Or just don't be a toxic player ever? Why not that? 
---
Or Ubi could offer up a solo queue and problem sorted. Lot's of other games have it, and it makes this games' ranked a bit embarrassing. 
---
Like when you shoot someone and you see the blood but when someone else kills them you don’t get the assist
---
!remindme 26 hours
---

Basically, everyone with a Vega 56, Vega 64, or Vega Frontier Edition graphics card gets really glitchy, flashing vertical lines coming off of every operator (and terrorists in t-hunt). I don't know if it's also an issue with integrated Vega graphics, but it's a recent issue that has already been reported to Ubisoft on several occasions, and hopefully one that they're working on.
