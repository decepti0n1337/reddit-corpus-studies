Hey man, you do you. I'm not here to convert or preach to anyone what I believe in. I just replied to someone, correcting them when they assumed what I believed in and got it wrong.

Something along the lines of,

---
"I love doing it to toxic people.
---
And people with anime profile pics"
---
With rook you're a team player but theres also that one person that doesnt take armor and runs off (usually heavy roamers from what i've encountered)
---
that's actually a useful angle
---
Also doesnt her VA support China over Hong Kong
---
Come on dude... I understand that people are upset about this and everything, and so am I as a WoW subscriber, but this is low effort Karma farming at it's best. Everyone who cares already knows what's going on, no need for these posts. They are all over the WoW forums, PC subreddits, etc, etc. I just want one forum that doesn't have stuff like this plastered all over it :/

I have his papillon shield skin but the more the merrier cx
---
It would cause people to quit on maps they do not like without penalty since the map is shown prior to ban phase. Also people would scope out the opposite team and leave if they were schooled by someone previously and want to avoid playing against them.
---
my nerf gun does that
---
our chalet doesn't even have a whirl pool...which terrorist would ever go there?

People are impatient as fuck lol. They were likely toxic teammates anyway.

No.  Le lion is le best O.P.   All le french ppl are.   HON HON HON HON. OUI OUI. BAGUETTE 🥖🥖🇫🇷🇫🇷

Nah, Mute i still solid for basically any team comp. I'm particularly fond of playing Castle/Mute and giving teams with traditional hard breachers a hard time because they can't use most of their stuff against the Castle walls, and then I can keep a spare jammer on me for if they start to Thermite/Hibana a wall or something.
---
Mute is kinda meh when you only use him for intel denial, instead of using him to prevent hard breaches. Once you start doing that he's one of the most annoying ops.
---
Why does iq have the fmg
---
I play both Console and PC. Xbox is my console preference not because it is better than PlayStation or because of the console wars BS. I love PlayStation Games. But will not consider it until it goes one full generation without being hacked. Unfortunately, it was last hacked this year. That is the 3rd time this gen.
---
PC, however, love the community but hate the M&amp;K. So, I play my prefered method. I use a controller. 
---
I don't care to fight with PC players over who is better or worse. But I can easily take on most PC players in a casual match using my controller. I am too low level on PC to play Ranked. But am over 130 on Xbox. So I know the maps. I know the game. And can take the enemy on and get MVP. I have poor recoil control on M&amp;K. But Console is burned into me. All I did was set my settings the exact same as Xbox and played. Used 60 FPS too. My PC is not amazing or anything. But Siege can run on 150ish FPS if I desired.
---
Red dot on maestro lmg oh no
---
you can help yourself counter it by being more unpredictable and selectively aggressive
---
Or do we? Maybe this is all part of OPs plan
---
Thats not toxic in any way

Big brother coming in for overwatch.    *Baguette noises*

No. Time his kick from the first death and it's about 1-2 seconds.

huch

R6 is worse than any other game ive played though when a game is supposed to be "competitive" it should have the least amount possible when in reality its gamebreaking that someone can see me for almost a full second before i even see their shoulder poke around a corner
---
Time the beginning of friendly fire and you’ve got 6

Take out glaz, add fuze. Imagine everyone pushing the objective while fuze turns it into a war zone.
---
That's fu**** hilarious.

How do you do this on xbox
---
He should get a rework, and/or we should get more options.
---
I'm not saying he's OP at all but I think he does too much for the team, making him almost a "must". 
---
Jams drones, denies Dokkaebi's calls, blocks Hibana's and Thermite's charges, jams normal breaching charges, negates Fuze charges, Lion's ability, Jackal's ability, etc.
---
What is this about?
---
China believes Hong Kong is rightful Chinese land. Since Hong Kong was released by the UK, it has acted as an autonomous democracy free of Chinese communist rule.
---
The Chinese are trying to force Hong Kong into submission, so widespread violence and protest in the city. 
---
China itself has multiple death camps for religious and ethnic groups, as well as political groups. They target mainly Muslims and spiritual groups, and a good amount of evidence of organ harvesting has come out.
---
But it’s more than just human rights violations and communism. It’s about the spread of Chinese influence. Many companies are owned by Chinese corporations, even us companies. And many large US corporations have been scared to step up to China, China basically being able to control these American companies into submission.
---
Most importantly the NBA has refused to stand against China after an NBA general manager retweeted a pro Hong Kong tweet. His own players turned their backs on him to prevent themselves from being criticized. China has cut pretty much all of its ties from the NBA. China is a big source of income from them, so they don’t have his back.
---
I got back into siege at the start of this new season and I've been playing just ranked and unranked. Idk my stats for it but I'd say I have a positive win ratio.
---
Im wondering if these ever got released i screen shot this in 2016 I think but ive only seen the bullet and the coffee
---
You were too late genius.
---
He's too dangerous to be kept alive
---
Careful, can’t criticize china on reddit anymore.
---
I support the Free Hong Kong movement, however I think we should keep the political content to a minimum on this sub.
---
 If we are doing this, we should also advocate for free Xinjiang, Palestine/Gaza as well.
---
Round starts 
---
Castle: has 2 meter long rug of pure baricade
---
Console is dirty
---
No as in I’m gonna get the mmr loss, it was only round 2
---
Make a a lesion one too :D
---
Are you using shadow play?
---
The mmr system works though.
---
If youre a 4.5k+ player you should be able to single handedly win the majority of your games up until 3800ish, at which point you should have functional teammates you can tentatively start relying on to help you
---
So I'm good in casual because no one gives a shit but bad in ranked because they do. 
---
I feel no different than before so it doesn't matter
---
Fucking hell let them play the game, what’s your psn sir 😂
---
I showed you my canister, answer me
---
He was in the between the middle and end of the stairs and the flash was more between the top and the middle of the stairs I think he would have been ok. Capitao didn’t even push him, so he wouldn’t have died.
---
That actually sounds like a good idea for a trap op, though I’m not a fan of trap meta
---
Most of the American people are with you even though our idiot President isn’t.
---
You can deny breach charge which IMO is more important.
---
I’m just going off what the devs say my man, I don’t know all the intricacies of the mmr system but there’s definitely casual mmr that’s separate to ranked mmr and new players are supposed to be matched with other new players
---

Shift f5 or r6 works for me
---
Oh yea I'm not doubting you, ik the devs say that but idk how it works either
---
Yeah dogs are cool in other larger map fps like cod or bf but in the CQC maps in r6s with the quick time to kill really doesnt allow stuff like K9 units without being broken(good or bad).
---
The "drone" like thing might be interesting depending on what it's counters and uses are. Like basically a larger twitch drone like robot that requires a impact to destroy?
---

They almost did
---
Isn't that most politicians? So don't trust politicians? Sound advice honestly.
---
That sounds neat, then his mvp animation could be him running to the screen pressing the detonator
---
Not even funny..
---
That could get a lot of laughs and it could cut out before the explosion or right as it goes off.
---
Cap was waiting for the second flash to go off, otherwise he would have flashed himself. 
---
That first flash was almost on the top of the stairs and pojo was 3-4 stairst down. If he was playing any other operator, he would need to play a lot more passive to not get stunned.
---
Personally i like reviving downed teamates.
---
She's the only "healer" for attacking.
---
Personal preference
---
Outbreak if it was it’s own game. BUT Ela and Vigil are in the game as well
---
I thought of making it where it has no cooldown and you can toggle it on or off, sorta how Glaz was before-nerf but that might be a tad too powerful
---
Congrats!
---
That’s  true but the second flash was well behind pojo so he wouldn’t have been flash by it. I’m just saying with an other op he could have done the same thing maybe not with the same confidence but still it would have work imo.

Impact to destroy might be to overpowered, I was thinking more like a knee-high dogbot with 50 hp
---
should wall reinforcements be triggering Goyo traps in the first place? sounds like a bug
---
Yeah I get that but he was asking the most needed. Imo a hard breach ( on most maps) needs to be pick before her.
---
I dont think it would work for this game but the trap idea this mans said.....yummy
---
“Keep posting for karma.”
---
Jesus Christ not everyone gives that much of a fuck about reddit
---
I'm gonna use it, It looks great
---
How did u make it
---
Should have his face revealed, other then that idk what they could do for his elite.
---
“Angles”
---
I think it’s because you got kicked instead of disconnected?
---
Happened to my friend. He got kicked for being afk with a bomb and couldn’t join back even though we were still in the game.
---
Fuck tiktok.
---
Ok just hear me out, if you have a clear view of an enemy, which action would be more likely to result in a kill?:
---
1) throw a knife at them (with travel speed, arc, etc)
---
2) shoot them in the head
---
This is why this isn’t a good idea for an op, because in this game #2 is always the answer and can happen instantly
---
They're probably just going to show his face. Kinda seems like that's all their doing for elites now.
---
Yeah I know people have known for a while, its really cool seeing posts about it :)
---
You’re wrong. Imagine that.
---
Maybe but when I restarted the game it prompted me to join back but when I clicked it it just gave the abandon sanction
---
At the home page of r/rainbow6, or any r/ with flairs, you can press the three little dots and it’ll say “change flair” you can put what you what and for emojis, you do for example :mute: for the operators icon, or :mutechibi: for the operators chibi, hope this helps :)
---
18?
---
in the video my friends and me say: What? Hahahaha and its stupid
---
Oh ok cool.  I thought u had to pay or something
---
Thank you for correcting me: I like to learn new things.
---
I think red crow ( echo and hibana) was the first really balanced season. Both ops were good, not op not very bad. Jackal at launch wasn’t the best that he was today they buff him 2-3 times over the years.
---
Maybe give him the uniform he wore during the time he gained his nickname after yelling and scaring away the enemies.
---
Perhaps just preference based really BUT if you wanna talk about the rarest skins I’d say the developer skin (black and golden) glacier, old season pro league skins like the one for SAS shotgun or the carbon and gold themed skins. Blue Nebula was for players who played back in velvet shell who played skull rain or red crow I believe. My fav skins are the diamond skin considering I paid so much for it, the red skin you buy from red crow, and all the other rarer skins
---
Yeah, I started to play smoke. Definitely better, Warden is terrible. They need to buff him or something
---
also, to make a custom one once you press “change flair” in the three little dots in the top right, in the top right again it should say “edit”
---
using alt + f5 or f6 works for me too
---
Maybe it doesn’t consider the reason you were kicked until you try and join? Not sure I’d have to do some testing.
---
Definitely seen problems before tho
---
Sure I'm in
---
This is why you shouldn't get a penalty for 1 or 2 kicks
---
because they adjusted the leaning animation specifically so the enemy wouldn’t actually gain an advantage by doing it
---
He sure is, he’s a three speed with a good assault rifle and has a gadget with zero counters except getting shot through it yourself. He’s very strong on club house being he can open a wall for free or mav trick against bandit, and he can open one electrified hatch.
---
F
---
Thank you for your condolences
---
Yea I don’t mind much anyway but if it was my plat game or something I woulda been mad
---
That’s interesting I never hear about Red Crow. Probably since it was so balanced. Do Hibana always only have 21 bullets in her AR or did they release her with 31 I can’t remember? 
---
Also how did they change Jackal from release to now?
---
his issue is he’s slow with a peashooter smg primary, good shotty, and just bad secondaries, all combined with a very situational gadget and you’ve got mediocre at best. there’s nothing they can really do with him aside from changing his kit, like maybe giving him a strong ar/dmr primary... *wink wink ubi*
---
Pues ahora que veo la foto, el set legendario que tiene Jackal en los Alpha Packs se parece un poco a eso (al menos en el color principal)
---
I know, i know, videos bad quality, we had to make do, but its all the evidence we need to get our sweet sweet vengence

Exactly. They’re literally HK police

Lmao this drawing is ass
---
I really like the Black Ops skin for the AK12. Just looks clean to me and the lime green is awesome. 
---
The Leder skins for the Gs9 ops is cool looking
---
Khokloma for the Spetz ops is a classy look, I like the Gold/Black combo
---
Instead of karma whoring, activate windows lmao

Yep, as long as matchmaking works it’s fun for any skill level

(Im not sure if everyone on this thread will get the notification or if its just one person) but we solved the case, we got video evidence, i just uploaded it yall wanna see

Grey universal and smoke elite weapon skins for me.
---
Yep. Those are the same guys that will TK you at the drop of a hat. Better off without them
---
Hold on, I got our holy lord and savior to persuade the other side of communism on speed dial..
---
The game is balanced and revolves around the one shot head shot mechanic. It will be super dumb to change it now.
---
It that word play? Or is Yong a character from another game?
---
Bro I thought she was a Hong Kong officer though
---
well you didnt hit his head/ the first shot missed and by that time his shot registered to the server first.

I wasn't trying to make fun of you, just stating the facts.

You never know. I’ve seen level 200’s that played like absolute bots, and I’ve seen level 28’s that we’re fragging out. Time played doesn’t always correlate with skill, especially not in a game like Siege where there’s no telling how things will play out.
---
Heh. Two Thermite mains answering half of a question each
---
Teamwork makes the dream work. Would have been funnier one thatcher and one thermite.
---
Alright sweet bro.
---
Oh wow a timed grenade kill. So much skill has been proven to us.
---
I've been having the same problem... I just don't think enough people are playing it since casual is a place to fuck around and unranked is just a few practice games before you hope into ranked so no one really consistently plays it
---

To me it looks like OP found a image and chose to name it as what ever operator it resembled the most.
---
Fuck
---
Just a word play haha
---
i think so
---
Good night
---
unranked doesn’t many players, and I know it sucks, but you can also learn to go without callouts by game sense. I haven’t seen ranked in a while so I do not know, but I know you can get dubs without teammates. Don’t blow them off completely tho.
---
Fucking recording vertically with the phone hurts me more
---
He would still be op
---
Because ubi think it's more balance to matchmake by a broken and unbalanced hidden MMR system instead of the actual ranked MMR (at least do that on unranked ubi ffs) or complete random.
---
Also, altough most of the time high level means good player, exceptions are and some high levels are trash (myself)
---
Not just you
---
Siege community can be toxic of course, and it's only human to misplace their anger. They probably support HK, but lumped you in with the chinese government's actions even though they don't know what your stance on it is. It's shameful of them but not uncommon. Maybe just keep your location to yourself while all this is going down
---
As much as you support Hong Kong or whatever it doesnt belong here. Please put in a more relevant place
---
I mean, it resembles echo more so than ying but you don’t need to call it terrible
---
Look, I’m all for new guns in the game, but just give them time. Complaining won’t get us anywhere.
---
Oh yeah me and Butter plan on it, I was his partner through this entire project
---
Never have I ever wanted Cav to interrogate me until now.
---
What the actual fuck. lmao
---
A K9 Operator is a hot steaming pile of shit idea
---
Lol I get the joke, but you gotta admit that background looks hella fresh
---
Do people really have an issue with a dog dying? I love dogs but its a video game.
---
Seems more like  payday
---
The voice actor for mei is apparently very pro-goverment, cant blame her since she is kinda famous and probably wants to keep her family safe.
---
What is the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
---
We had a chance back in the 50s. MacArthur was right
---
K( oThe bigger issue is that it adds AI into the multiplayer side of the game.
---
Either its going to be extremely pointless dog slowly running hitting people with paint and then immediately getting shot down. 
---
Or its going to be a dog that can wallhack and find people+ dmg them which is stupid in a competitive game.
---
Either way a K9 operator in r6s doesnt match what the game is currently, which is a competitive strategy fps.
---
Indeed. Favorite is when I’m reinforcing an outward facing wall after already making a rotation hole and get team clapped for it anyway. Sometimes it be like that I guess.
---
Yes but remember the older a footprint is the less pings you get from scanning
---
We know. Come up with new material
---
I love these sm
---
Oh get off the high horse bud, it's a low rank thing not a platform thing.
---
Trust me bud everyones aware at this point. Youre npt adding anything.
---
I feel that pain
---
I only play casual to level up that account so once it's leveled and ranked casual won't be a thing for me. I just think it's funny that the guy assumes I'm ruining the game for people because i killed him in casual and I'm not garbage
---
Wow I cringed hard at that.
---
I think the recovery one is a good idea, I just think he’s only strong because he can prevent any plants from going down and having access to a headshot weapon with an added acog, maybe if he didn’t stop plants so easily he would act more like a trap/intel gatherer op.
---
Hitting the nail on the head, perfectly.
---
That doesn’t change the fact that 
---
A. Your still hurting a dog
---
B. A dog shouldn’t be added because AI in multiplayer is a terrible idea

Nope, Ubisoft shouldn't waste resources on an operator substitute.

Maestro shit tier? What are you smoking because i want some.

Is ubi going to do this for console? I played a few games against a DDoSer and since they banned people I havent gained anything.
---
Fist things first are you 100% sure your headphones are on correctly
---
So you have no problem shooting people in the game but you draw a line at killing a dog?
---
At the end of each year I want a recruit/another option on recruit with the CTUs for that year

SHAME

I would say $550
---
As a player that has almost 2000 hours and taken part in semi professional play,  Blitz is fine where he is at now, before blitz was a solo player that did an enormous amount of damage to a team you can one shot people with melee and having that quick ads time makes a blitz player almost untouched unless the player makes a mistake.  In higher play with great communication you can manage to counter a blitz or stop his push with a cross fire but in ranked where you don’t always have that team work he really is too good.  If I had the choice I would keep blitz more underpowered than overpowered.
---
Smoke elite is my second favorite
---
ngl, I like bb's second one
---
Ok.
---
I was responding to point A which says nothing about AI.
---
No, like... it wont work
---
from what i remember from the rouge 9 vid, it doesn't matter for footsteps, because those settings mainly affect loud sounds like explosions and gunshots
---
Got it...I will definitely keep an eye out 👀👁️
---
I will only talk about two, Hi-Fi and Night mode because TV is just middle road. 
---
Night mode is what is commonly called Sound Equalization, what this means is if the sound is supposed to be played it will play it at the same volume as everything else. This means that footsteps you can hear across the map and right beside you (as long as you are in hearing distance) should sound the same. You gain the ability to hear things farther away better, but lose the ability to gauge distance with your hearing.
---
Hi-Fi is the opposite, it puts the stress on sound distancing. Is someone walking super far away? Probably won't hear it over your team-mates running around. However if they are somewhat close you can become accustomed to telling how far away they are which helps a lot for prefiring. I would say Hi-Fi is best paired with Equalizer tweaks to tone down the mid-range to make fringe noises easier to hear (similar to how CS:GO does it's setups).
---
Which is better? People will argue either side saying it's the only way to play.
---
Still prefer jackal's pdw-9 for this kind of gameplay, but I'll have to do some practice
---
Its just a title
---
Use Night Mode if you just want to be able to detect footsteps.
---
However, if you are using a headset and want to be able to tell with precision like a sonar the distance of opfor, then you need to use the other options as further will be softer and vice versa.
---
I'll post it in the r34 sub when I do c:
---
hahhahahahah everything I don’t like is overused maymay hahahahah
---
Maybe, maybe not, but most sites have at least one drone hole. If it’s muted, go Thatcher. If he’s banned, go Maverick. If they’re both banned, then why didn’t you ban Jackal?
---
I literally have nobody to play with and my unranked and casual queues are fine
---
21 savage
---
Yep.
---
With red bull
---
“Eh” lmao

I agree, the ads time is way to slow. Imo it was fine the way it was before
---
Season 2 Blitz main here. My baby was already ruined once, now he has been ruined twice. I want blood, a lot of blood.
---
Someone ask Ubisoft why you can't see your own character's shadow.
---
Quick drawing? Christ, for a quick draw that's great
---
Doesnt have to be a bullet sponge. And the K9 op will be sitting afk while controlling the dog making them weak against roamers. The dog doesnt even have to do damage. K9 dogs are trained to supress people by holding them down. The  dog could just hold the op in place until a teammate kills the dog or an enemy kills them.
---
F for my boy. I miss you blitz.
---
You can control a higher sensitivity on updated. So when you switch you need to bump up your sens. Obviously if you were 100/100 then it just comes down to feel.

Isnt yours the same as this username. Mine is.
---
Rainbow is a team that fights to stamp out evil. Wherever it hides.
---
Oh yeah I forgot to tell you.
---
My wife is nokk
---
Apart from the 2 on the end yeah
---
Dudes seriously mad that a dude put a nice shot on him. I’m all for complaining about ghost headshots but good lord just except that you get clapped sometimes even if it doesn’t look like it
---
Im actually in disbelief this showed up.
---
Thanks :) https://r6fix.ubi.com/test-server/TTS-19571-Radios_don_t_stop_playing_music/
---
ummmm ok
---
Good message but Jesus Christ this is not ying
---
Ty
---
I thought you implied something else, my bad
---
I'm booting up siege rn so I'll add you
---
I posted it hoping I might find some of you guys.
---
Oh yeah, that's hot.
---
Exactly.
---
Especially Finka boosted.
---
Red smonk, blue smonk,   
---
vapor so cold bitch I think I need a stim shot.  
---
1 smonk, 2 smonk, 3 smonk, 4 smonk,  
---
work for rainbow six, and I'm boutta make these melons pop.
---
Ever since it got the angled grip it’s been over
---
Indeed
---
I cant play siege rn but ill hit you up tomorrow
---
When you finished it we have to get on last person to reproduce it and then it's a "confirmed" issue and they have to look into it. That's how I understood it.
---
Ill add you with the ubi app on my phone
---
Buddy idk if you know or not, but during a rebellion or coup a good chunk of the police and military force is gonna switch sides
---
I added one guy from your team as well
---
The potatos have united
---
lol thats not Ying lmao. U ain't gettin my upvote.
---
Oh nice, what was their username
---
It was kkxch
---
if they simply reduced the lifetime of footprints down to a max of 20 seconds he wouldn't get banned nearly as much
---
It's spooktober they have to release it within this month.
---
You are the poor people who brainwashed by westernmedias in fact
---
Lion, therm, thatch, jager, nomad, smoke(I think), Blackbeard, maestro, glaz, kaid. I think that's all including the other mentioned above me.
---
KK
---
Imma look through the chat to find others
---
No problem. It will likely be on sale this winter or even more so like how wildlands significantly cut their price
---
Correct. Horror/stealth. Somebody back me up on TA's multigenre discussion forum.
---
Ironically, I lost elo on the last roleback. Don't ask me how. I play with a 5 man squad, and we're all fully legit players
---
They removed a lot of the common civilians and daily life and now it’s just way more enemies. A lot like Far Cry 5.
---
No
---
Actually you just proved his point
---
&gt; Plus, if you are better at the game than those that ban smart, then you should have a comfort ban because you can handle anything.
---
That’s exactly what he’s saying, people who comfort ban can handle anyone so they ban whoever they want and don’t have to rely on tactical banning.
---
Your first point can be boiled down to, people who comfort ban are so good it doesn’t matter if it’s a team full of recruits or not 
---
Not saying I agree with him or not, but your argument doesn’t stack up and he certainly didn’t contradict himself
---
100
---
same
---
I literally forgot this game was getting made. Haven't heard a single thing in months.
---
Sledge and glaze as well
---
The Hong Kong protests that are happening recently
---
Wish it was easy!
---
They also cancelled Rainbow Six Patriots which a lot of people were excited for and then announced Siege maybe a year later I think.
---
A lot of protests
---
But why? It's a just game bruh... I am pretty sure most of us don't live in East Asia. Why tf would you guys care so much about someone's political pursuits on the other side of earth? The whole internet is now filled with these kind of "support" and I can't even hide from the overwhelming stupidity in games smh
---
Grenade of god
---
It fits the story though. They are other issues with the game for sure but it's an isolated island under martial law so lack of daily life makes sense.
---
Not here. This is not a politics sub.
---
Repost from shuttyr6
---
R6 is not politically involved, stop being a karmawhore.
---
they make the mags in 20 rnds and 30.
---
Didn't play Farcry 5 either, just cause the series doesn't feel particularly interesting to me. I grabbed Wildlands and it was kinda a good game to fuck around in, but it already felt so desolate and just stupidly large. 90% of gameplay was literally just steal a chopper, fly to area, parachute down and assault, steal a chopper, rinse and repeat ad nauseum until the game was finished.
---
To be fair, though, civilians aren't really necessary to make the game feel populated - MGSV was a similar format and IIRC had no neutral civilians, but the map didn't feel so goddamn empty because there was actually shit to do.
---
And if I post every 1v5 than that would count as spam...
---
The woman I have locked in my basement is also pro-me.
---
goyo placed his shield right beside the wall once he saw that OP was reinforcing. once the wall was reinforced it broke the goyo shield because the reinforcement goes out a little past the wall, hence destroying the shield. goyo and his buddy then jumped into the fire, which killed them both and resulted in an instant ban on OP due to friendly fire.
---
Castles usually just block you in. If people don't play him right he's infuriating.
---
we need a successor for vegas 2...Can't find any game like that on the market atm.
---
nah it’s about the karma my dude
---
A lot of pros use Night Mode (including myself) it dampens gunshots and explosions and increases the sound of foot steps/enemy reloads.
---
If you know 100% you have an advantage then this is not applicable. This post is not a 100% rule in 100% cases. s

# [How to create horizontal animated banners](https://www.reddit.com/r/steamgrid/comments/d87oua/how_to_create_horizontal_animated_banners/)
---
I know, and nerfing operators according to low skilled players comfort bans is a bad idea. 
---
It wasnt that long ago that they buffed the range he was able to scan from because people didnt play him enough. 
---
The pick and ban system has changed the general opinion of Jackal that people think he is stronger than he is, dont get me wrong he is a powerful operator for roam hunting and i dont have anything against this rework. 
---
But he is one of the few anti-roamers attack has, which is why people comfort ban him. There are so many other attackers that make more sense banning in relation to the map and the sites youre playing.
---
Had those for pirate defence on a cargo ship. Neat little guns.
---
he is saying he has anger issues and that he would threaten peoples personal safety over a video game because he is salty
---
ffs
---
There are a few already in the pool, including Blood Orchid ones....
---
Yep
---
ooooh i like it,thank you for your info
---
I’ve always thought if they just added a short cooldown between scans then jackal would be perfectly fine. I admit I’m an aggressive roamer and very mobile during defense so that makes
---
Me biased, but I find it incredibly annoying getting scanned multiple times back to back.
---
omfg
---
Correct
---
I can be here forever
---
U got me. Just wanted to turn off my phone
---
You’d be surprised 
---
I’ll reply to this in about 5 years
---
Considering your on a internet forum insulting people for no reason, you must need a girlfriend or a loving parent.
---
Hah, noob, I've been saying ok in a Steam profile comments section for years now!
---
SPILL IT
---
Ok
---
&gt;realtek
---
garbage
---
anyway i just wish siege properly supported dolby atmos/windows sonic. borderlands 3 does and being able to clearly hear where people are is amazing but in siege i only get feint ideas where people are. ex: in borderlands 3 i can hear that the enemy is close to my back right, in siege he could be to my right, or above me, or on my left since this games audio is fucked.

Uhhh what rank are you
---
Nothing is more terrifying as a player than being downed and seeing sledge run towards you with his hammer. However as a sledge main this makes my day
---
I did not check their levels sadly. But I personally am at around 240 level but I was suprised that he thought I was hacking even though we were on the same team last match
---
The advantage is in your hands. Ping abuse isn’t a thing anymore.
---
Always easier with shotguns =\]
---
Beat me to it ya bastard
---
Quick peeking with high ping does absolutely nothing for the peeker. That's not how any of this works.
---
That hasn't really stopped trolls though, has it?
---
Because when you change regions you reset your MMR, so you get paired against average players. This has been covered too many times.
---
Another weapon I'd like to see in the game, we've already had ar15 chambered in 9mm in theg ame, but I can never have enough, and of course having the best scope in the game :weary:
---
Could even get an acog if it belonged to a 1 speed defender, but I doubt you'd get much use out of it, average firerate, average damage, low recoil
---
I would continue watching this but the music took me back in time to the early 2010’s and I’m fucking dying
---
I had a blast, some didn't enjoy it but that's just the way of things. The event did get a bit repetitive over time but hopefully in a standalone game they will flesh it out a lot more so there's more variety.
---
Then they really would have let Nomad have it over the mic
---
I thought I was the only one
---
It just feels so nice to pull that off, but the killed people were just bonkers to call you a cheater.
---
LMAO
---
They are since this season.

Looks like how I'd imagine her Tinder profile oic to be.

Tip for blitz
---
Run at the enemy, flash them, bash them. Works everytime
---
Why not some kind of ak smg, they exist you know
---
I gave an answer. Nothing else fam
---
No, you can't sell them.
---
Googling the stuff I see "Mk47" everywhere, and usually the Mk means Mark. But some people say MK.
---
But bitching because of it's name is dumb. It's a nice AR with an AK mag
---
No problem
---
Anything's a dildo if you're brave enough
---
Surprised they didn't use a grizmot mine
---
Pretty dope. I'd pay about $150 for it. Even tho I'd never use it xD
---
Level 270, got about 10 black ice
---
Well I didn't know that.
---
No you say nice
---
I feel you. I'm plat 1 on NA solo queuing and its cancer. But I am trying to get a stack together to push for diamond. I had to get it through my head that if I play with the team long enough I wont feel so awkward. Hope this helps. Best of luck.
---
If you can’t play as a team don’t expect people to be a team player
---
He recently got that noise nerf so it's much easier to hear him though.
---
Can you do the ak47?
---
You gave a pointless answer that solves nothing
---

---
Who said anything about Casual?
---
nice
---
As in you can’t lose that amazing level
---
I was only saying siege is a team game if you don’t like playing in a team what’s premade ofc you should expect to have bad callouts.
---
As in you can’t lose that amazing number
---
Ya ive had the same bug too and it is so annoying
---
r u salty
---
Hot
---
That is true. You should always move even if you are holding an angle since the opponent most likely is going to prefire
---
I’m not sure how to get them to make call outs but I just recommend getting a squad with friends or some type of r6 team making service. If you’re on ps4 there’s a community called R6 Team Finder I recommend using that.
---
Maybe they're using them right now, so we can't see them
---
I just want people to listen to callouts I make. I see people on mic and I’m met with zero response
---
xDDDd uWu
---
Lmao her gadget literally allows her to find it.
---
So what should I do?
---
these nerfs arent enough to make people stop banning Jackal. but if he were to be nerfed sufficiently, then people will start banning other operators. some want to cocoon inside the OBJ (ban Thatcher), some want to play Mira (ban Twitch), some want no shields (ban Montagne), some want to do runouts (ban Nomad), some dont want the walls getting opened up as long as they can Bandit trick (ban Maverick), etc.
---
Good one
---
Okay..as much as that gun sucks irl it would be great in game.Also....why is it so small?
---
What annoys me more is someone else should have planted while iq found the yokai
---
Its not that I feel awkward. I just turn to garbage and can barely play as i rely on sound
---
sir, i’d like to purchase thy account
---
I’m over powered
---
What if she gives the defuser to her teammates and she'll find the yokai instead lmao
---
Or halloween event?
---
For a second I thought it was meth addict Dokkaebi
---
Get better at playing as a team, duo or trio is best as you can form strats between eachother. Randoms are straight up asshats and very unreliable
---
small? how so
---
do you, by any chance, happen to work at Ubisoft hq?
---
That’s why i put a claymore on that corner.
---
Hoes mad
---
Naah   i think its easy to see if you are just looking fpr them    yokai against team that dont coordinate or call ypkais out    its powerfull weapon    but   teams that  do those   usually   not  that powerfull     but still     its fun to see that happen :)
---
Welp . No spawn peeks then 
---
Also the rules has been changed https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dbgqk9/welcoming_new_moderators_to_the_rrainbow6_team/

just ACOG removal
---
Yep. Won that game too.
---
Still applies

I can’t understand what you are saying completely.

However,he is still quite strong in a competitive setting.

DeathNote Dokkaebi

So a blitz main?

Look in the shop under uniforms

I hit 1 one tap a month. Give me a few years for my clips.

I always forget how god damn huge the M16 is with that 20inch barrel compared to an M4. Definitely not suited for CQC with the long barrel

He's literally always had this ability and no one had a problem with him till recently lol. He used to be considered really underpowered and was rarely picked before parabellum.

Low tier bait
---
I just downvoted your comment.
---
FAQ
---
What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
•    ⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, •    ⁠Spreading incorrect information, •    ⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.
---
Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
You dont get it, do you?
---
Not really. Genuinely never heard
---
... ya, that's what I just said
---
&gt; if that's all his primary gadget is then he'd be useless
---
Making the larger one scan enemies means that being able to swap sights isn't the only thing his gadget does.
---
I 100% get your joke.
---
i didn't say i put so much effort on it but i didn't make it in 10sec .i post it for people to using it!
---
if i had that image for reverse searching or know what to search at the first place! that would be great! and i didn't post it for nerds like you to criticize me. i delete my comment to make you comfortable.
---
(let's go and downvote this one too)
---
-2% &lt; -1% it is the opposite Amaru has a higher win delta than Nøkk
---
Then look him up instead of making false claims based on personal bias. He has 900k subs and made many wave in the esports and ranked scene.
---
I think playing as Buck and making a smol melee hole and nading ppl through is more satisfying.
---
I’m blue
---
Beat me to it god dammit
---
TK ban should not be loosened. I would keep it as it is or even make it more strict. 
---
The thing that needs to be changed is the gadgets that make these things possible. For example the goyo shield should not be exploded when a wall gets reinforced near it.
---
Well the way he activates his glasses during phantom sight main menu animation looks very different
---
Ubi have big brain
---
Broski
---
Bruh moment
---
My future is coming on
---
yea and in p.s i said "2h is not alot , my bad ". don't try to being dick
---
It was small and a little unbalanced due to the size, but I love small maps because the gunfights are so random
---
Bender
---
What im trying to say  is  if you have shitty team with no communication   ofcourse  its hard to counter   but  attackers have   twitch, iq  and  thatcher to counter echo  so   its not that hard
---
Some of my favourite memories on this game was old ranked, attacking and defending the secure area on Hereford basement the whole match. Good times before Ubi went full tard and thought we all wanted to be mlg.
---
Take your damn upvote
---
Meant to say god
---
clash needs a nerf tbh
---
Okay bro pretty anecdotal evidence though
---
This truly is
---
A brother moment

He needs that ADS nerf revoked

As a cav main i disapprove

I dont even agree with the nice tits guy that is kinda autistic but the whitenighting is worse lmao

Where's the Ta?

Tachanka?  
---
or did your buddy send you Chanka to make a meme out of carrying you? (are they still teaching you?)  
---
The reference for that is Chanka translates to carrying something over your shoulder, like a book bag or a rifle with a strap.

I just play ranked cause why not, im gold anyways, so it doesn't matter

---
its still in the game though, other maps i can understand if they've been deleted but og hereford can still be accessed through situations which means its in the games files just not used
---
That will get some disagreements i think
---
Really isn't terribly different. Definitely not enough to be "mazey".
---
HAHA HE DELETED HIS ACC
---
As a defender it was also very easy to get locked out of the top two floors.
---
I haven't played enough to know but I just don't like her, she's obnoxious in gameplay and character
---
what do you mean? Is it like a multi-player restriction
---
It's already in game, Jackal has one.
---
And why does the M16 suck irl? The AR-15 is a hugely successful rifle used all around the world and used by well over 80 countries either as standard infantry rifles or by specialist units like CTUs. It's an accurate and reliable platform. The downside is that you have to maintain the weapon which requires money, time, and training which is no problem for special forces. Also 5.56 does have a problem being fired from shorter barrels  it that isn't an issue in the type of situations a CTU would be in. We're not in the desert or the highlands of Afghanistan where 300m+ engagements would be common and thus in need of a 7.62 battle rifle.
---
Bullets disappear at like 44m in this game. It's why the extended barrel mod is dumb for everything but shotguns because it doesn't do what it actually would do for 5.56 weapons, increase velocity and thus accuracy (because flatter trajectory) and overall damage (more energy).
---
I draw ela alot...you cam check my profile i think there is one on it
---
Well, the real challenge would be knowing where to shoot. Plus, pretty much the only reason you'd start shooting it would be because you see someone. And that's 15 shots *not* hitting you, so I'd consider that a win.
---
Why twitch cant find them?    I find many many times    yokais arent that "invisible" 😅
---
I habe problema with holgraphic and reflex too
---
But holographic is a sphere so more or less i can guess it
---
And reflex is just like red dot but i can see it in lil more surfaces
---
its that they hear it and either decide to go a different way or use an explosive or get thatcher to destroy it
---
its kind of helpful having them be 1 explosive/emp down but not exactly what i'm aiming to do
---
I always hoped that they'll introduce an event where attackers and defenders switch sides
---
No of the shots would have hit anyway
---
Survey yes! They send one to 50.000 players every season. If you look at the right it shows what people probably were asked (top 3 most frustrating, top 3 most fair) to get the score
---
The AR-15, made by ArmaLite, was based off their AR-10 weapon which was 7.62 battle rifle for US Army trials. It won and was adopted as the M16. The M4 is based also off what we call the AR-15 platform, as is the HK 416.
---
The AR-15 came first, though ArmaLite sold it to Colt which is a big reason they went out of business, though I think they got revived.
---
you piece of shit loool
---
Yeah that’s true but is you see someone behind the shield you won’t start shouting the shield, you would wait to kill the attacker and then destroy the shield. Plus defense have a whole lot of explosive with nitro and impact.
---
Stop your scaring the children
---
Not the same gun,distant cousins
---
Except when tatchanka
---
Yeah. I don't even know why he posted this. This is basically saying "tHaT wAs A hEaDsHoT", but is aiming for the feet.
---
The face you make right as you are about to sneeze
---
Yeah but you at least get that "oh shit" moment chance to run away instead of getting wallbanged.
---
who needs pings wth
---
Won't change anything. Need harder nerf
---
You saw the made and accepted your fate
---
Yo, y'all got any more of that there...
---
Prefire?
---
Spookabi
---
Where are you guys from?
---
Can’t you shoot through that couch? I’m not 100% sure
---
I like how tachankas just “what”
---
Yeah especially cause Nomad was OPs friend. They would have never let him live it down.
---
since when did fuze have a groza?
---
This weapon i see as being exactly the same as Jaeger's weapon but with a faster ads and lower damage and probably even less recoil
---
If you can bait from behind the shield, you could gain the advantage if they waste enough ammo to reload shooting the shield (depending on what gun they're using)
---
Hmmm well I looked into it in a costum game and the radio wasn't playing for me in construction (it's between cash and bedroom or?)
---
still doesn't explain how I get shitty level 30s and the opposing gets 200+ No offense to you here I'm just annoyed. Ranked is something I tend to play in stacks only, solo queueing is ridiculous because nobody has a mic, don't wanna get stuck in an elo hole. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
he said ak12 then edited the comment, don't blame it on me :(
---
I never said they couldn't exist together, all I was doing was point out there already is one in game.
---
And you downvoted first.
---
ok apology accepted
---
lol fucked
---
Been a while since I last played, they didnt saw the killcam? Is there still one? 
---
Those guy were clueless hahaha
---
Yeah maybe, I still think it won’t be that good because it will be a death sentence to try and put down a shield next to obj.
---
...and being important...
---
Fuck no
---
I know you could see her in the wall
---
this look great
---
Haha nice

The defender is a jaeger substitute.

Their reply from September 20: 
---
&gt;I can see that you have been effected by cheaters using DDOS attacks in your game, I am very sorry you have experienced this and I can assure you we are working to fix this and would like to direct your attention to the following developer blog post, outlining exactly how we plan on improving this!

Seemed like a bot reply so I replied back with more info, they then replied back September 28 with this:
---
&gt; I would like to assure you we do not tolerate cheating and toxic behaviour in any way in our games. We do rely on our automated systems of cheating detecting software to mark players as suspicious so we can have a human eye to check on. We also rely very much on our player base to report such players. 
---
&gt;With that said I would like to inform you that I have already forwarded this case to the Siege team for further investigation. As per Ubisoft policy, we will inform the player affected by the report only, so you will not receive any information for the outcome of the following investigation. 
---
Maybe they just haven’t got around to taking action yet, or maybe they are gathering more info to build a bigger case on the player, who knows, but it’s very blatant that the player is breaking every rule in the book and making thousands of players’ experience misery.
---
Competition for jaeger on defense apparently
---
you should use the long barrel of the Jackal's Rifle, it look more suitable than the short barrel
---
Sounds good and with the rof on it it will just be more rewarding to peeps with accuracy
---
Who the fuck voted to surrender on round 8
---
if they're boosting/selling ddos it would make sense that they want to shut the whole thing down rather than just ban the guy for him to pop up again
---

they should add someone with a reflex/red dot/holo and acog sight [something like this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpalmettostatearmory.com%2Fmedia%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fcache%2F1%2Fimage%2F9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95%2F1%2F7%2F176634-Trijicon-ACOG-4x32-ECOS-Sight-FDE-TA31-D-100553_1.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpalmettostatearmory.com%2Ftrijicon-acog-4x32-ecos-sight-flat-dark-earth-ta31-d-100553.html&amp;docid=adKmksfc7NPlTM&amp;tbnid=z4w4VgBjXiSonM%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwj7vZeKz5TlAhXMvJ4KHYWdCT4QMwh5KAMwAw..i&amp;w=1200&amp;h=950&amp;safe=active&amp;bih=697&amp;biw=1366&amp;q=acog%20sight&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7vZeKz5TlAhXMvJ4KHYWdCT4QMwh5KAMwAw&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8)

#48 wasn’t a one tap
---
So much for chaos is my home
---
Oh, yeah I didn’t think that far. Most of the time the enemies come in one by one to get killed
---
How about u remake the gun and make it actually work and end them
---
Minecraft
---
No, but he did play Valk for like 5 games before I asked him where the cameras he should've placed are. 
---
After that he started placing cameras, but it took like a week before he stopped just throwing them in the corners of the bomb rooms.
---
Yep I said two weeks in that Warden is useless, he needs to be able to use his gadget full time. Simple as that. Full stop.  And Nokk is too slow and she also needs to be able to use her gadget full time.
---
I know...
---
It looks good but me being a perfectionist I see a few minor things I'd fix. But that's the beauty of it, always getting better.
---
Editing takes time.
---
There is a red X on every kill. Just points are not active.
---
Sledge mains are the best change my mind

after creating an [IQ one ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d453z7/made_the_iq_icon_out_of_clay_for_a_friend_i_know/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for my friend I made me one too
---
How can I get the white background
---
I knw and a lot of time peepl sey that i'm haker
---
To be specific, it's chambered in 7.63x39, not NATO. It actually is very unique and not "just a 7.62 AR."
---
I feel your being picky, just for the fact some of the cosmetics don't look like something someone in special forces would wear. Would be cool if they made them 100% legit, but it could possibly take away from the lore? Also, all OPs would kinda blend in together.
---
That’s pretty accurate. But what do the elite controllers truly add and help you with? Just better quality or do the extra functions help that much? I could imagine it makes leaning a hell of a lot easier.
---
It because cpu is at 100%, try to 144fps cap and check the usage then also try to lower graphics.
---
Got my upvote
---
You gotta talk to them
---
In a 1v1 scenario, what exactly is their counter? It's you attempting to shoot the incredibly small exposed portion of their shoulder versus their hip fire RNG or their pistol quickscope. Its dumb and shouldn't be in the game.
---
The only confirmed thing is "a competitor for Jager", the rest is just pure speculation / fake leaks.
---
Hmm...
---
I didn't really think about that part, but i think it would be dull if the Claymore Roomba comes in the objective and kamikazes the defenders.
---
Defenders could use it for area denial maybe? blocking certian hallways?
---
But then the Question is if it is controled or just roams around like other beta roombas do.
---
I’m not stalking it’s public access
---
we shall do it man, blizzard is a bitch and winny xingping an ascendant bitch
---
Yeah I thought the aiming looked a bit off.
---
Even though it's just a sketch it's really great

I didn't even notice that but I believe you are correct. Thank you, sir.

The original R6 invitational skin that started on ash then became a universal at the Paris invitational

thx man for being a good person

and you are welcome

It's a cat that's camouflaged just like that para bellum skins.
---
I guess I could give it a try
---
Roaming around would be funny,  sadly would not be e-sport approved if it has no fixed path.

It just looks ugly. Use it if you really enjoy it.

Lower graphics wont do much that's handled more by the gpu.

Link Ubisoft acc to twitch prime
---
What... what was dokkis plan there? Give you a hug?? Im so confused. Lol
---
Big braaaainnnn
---
I did
---
would using nvidia adaptive vsync help?
---
Link Ubisoft to steam, Xbox, or PlayStation
---
What cpu do you have
---
Well duh, we can't aim so we use shottys only
---
Oh. Then it is also a CZ. With a carbine system.
---
Just link all three
---
Lol yeah I was confused. I was like “unless they completely changed the weapons since last week, there’s def no glocks
---
Cool.
---
Thanks for the reply. The whole concept idea is based on better communication. When i play with my premades we give calls which operator killed us and their last location. It happend sometimes that another enemy get's killed but not the called out one so we didn't pay attention and died to them. But right now i got another idea that you can see maybe a fuze above earlier so you can warn your mates way before he drops the charges. Or see a Monty in the smoke screen and know they want to fast plant. You can see the operators and  predict their next moves.
---
The lord has blessed you
---
It’s because the match making is based off the average mmr of the team combined so one guy on that low level team is a god that ubi expects to carry the rest of them. It makes the Q time faster but yeah it looks stupid
---
Yes but he will get higher fps and then he set cap so then cpu will be used less.
---
I only have it on pc
---
I pulled one of these today on bank and almost shit myself. 2nd time after 1st time on fortress
---
Thx
---
wow really what maps
---
A clutch is winning the round as the last remaining player. How you do it is moot.
---
I do it ended with a clash + alibi spawn rush
---
You are making it seems like Ubisoft is going to be on the hitlist now.
---
Give tachanka wheels on his mg! Lord tachanka! Would be pretty funny
---
Ahhh headache
---
Yeah it did this earlier for me, tried to plant near a wall and it dropped the bomb instead. Cost us the game :/
---
Some of those are so disgusting.
---
I love it
---
Bitch I have a ps4 how do I screenshot
---
oh of course how could i forget

When you load up that Gmod save

This should be a skin

This is hilarious.

Neither one of you can actually spell “genius” properly but you’re both trying to put do each other.

I know how to spell genius I was making fun of him hence the quotation marks
---
i like the ump sure it could use a buff to rof but i don’t have any problems with maybe like 660 or 640 would be good enough
---
i just wanna know, what is the purpose or wide stretched resolution?
---
Yeah just discord and then invite. Good to go.
---
Yep same experience, Discovered this at the expense of losing the round
---
Thank you
---
u/TenBensons is indeed correct. Leaning with with a vanilla controller while trying to aim at the same time is the worst
---
Am I watching Marley? /s
---
This post is to shed more light onto the situation. Just because you dont care about it doesnt mean hardcore fans and people who try to continue playing arent frustrated with it. The fact that its been happening for this long doesnt need a magical fix it shouldve been something figured out while the game was still big. The fact that they only recently decided to do something about it is pathetic. Being silent about the situation is just as bad as being a person who is a part of the shitty people who are using these third party websites to hit the server they are in offline. Its a waste of time to play through most of a match in ranked and then the game abruptly ends because someone hits the server offline and all 10 people get nothing out of it bc one person didnt want to lose 30 points of ELO/MMR. The point is this should’ve been fixed long ago and is the original reason i quit the game nearly a year ago.
---
did not know that, I quit to the desktop as I joined an ongoing match
---
Y'all saying IQ is thicc but you are forgetting about the absolute unit of Rook and Maestro

Ash becomes a 5 speed capable of phasing through walls. She also gets gets a full auto 50 round rocket launcher that insta-kills at any range and it replaces her normal primary gadget. She also gets frag grenades
---
Didn't know it would show if i did that
---
Read the comments on your new post

What level are you? What is your ingame name?  
---
What ranks were you previous seasons?
---
The recoil is after the shot is fired
---
I've never been thrown into a game in 10 seconds before, thought I would have time
---
Profession glasses can’t look this bad!
---
xD
---
When you shot past that lesson I remember once I shot behind a frost at an ash, injured her and the first thought I tried to shoot at her, she knocked me, revived me than we both got killed by the ash after she got revived
---
Nah, ill just keep playing the game DDOS free like my previous 1000 hours. Thanks though

Hello chemagu, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dgkuct/animated_wallpaper_of_operation_ember_rise_make/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

well 1, try not having bad aim, 2, i’m talking about the second part
---
that actually would be a good idea :P
---
My tactic was to throw them just straight up in the underside of door frames.  I though it was being brilliant to see 2 rooms at once.  Pretty sure every single camera I threw got shot.
---
It just makes the reticle easier to see as far as I know
---
Omg thank you, this is the only actual explanation other than “trAsH aIM”

He could of easily ended that match

Have you ever turned around and just seen an Ash or a Cav? Scariest jump scare in gaming.
---
Small brain
---
Thanks and Ela is next!
---
Yeah it’s unusual for me also, sadly I have a messed up sleeping schedule and I was playing mid day when I had it happen to me, so that’s a factor why it’s unusual for me.
---
That's internet issues. Not only was your ping at 1300 but you didn't get disconnected from the match
---
also ur a silver 3, stop talking to me
---
Thats really fucking crazy, yet it might just work.
---
You're never gonna get better at ranked unless you play it, no one cares if you're a bronze rank right now, keep it at it
---
That’s because you can tell this from just watching the video, you missed. It doesn’t need anymore explaining
---
After going up 3-2 in the match we all got ddosed. Youre understanding of this issue is even less than i originally thought.
---
He's in my discord but I've had him mostly muted for a good week now, he's such a whiny bitch it ruins the game for everyone on the team.
---
He’s meant to disorient enemies not pull some BS from across the map
---
I've reported this to the reddit moderating team.
---
Real idea now. Tachanka can now carry his turret only it disables the shield and he can only hip fire with it. He can only walk with it out but he can plant it down at any time
---
I'm unranked?? So
---
Aight, but if you die you also die irl.
---
You know, to balance it out.
---
When you see the kill cam he turns from looking at the door
---
Sum of all Fears and The Hunt for Red October are my personal favorites. The Red October movie with Sean Connery is also phenomenal.
---
wardens ability becomes a passive ability and he can distribute it to 2 other teammates
---
So the characters are fatter and it’s easier to aim. Shits wack frfr
---
I don’t think cross platform would be a good idea but M&amp;K vs M&amp;K would be ideal sooo idk
---
Sweet thanks!
---
You should have shown that even then ddosing ping is usually at 15000+ for everyone on you team
---
i just looked up ur stats, either it’s now or last season, ur still a bot, btw “astrotitan7274” sounds like a bot name so just stop
---
And she gets wall hacks
---
The inability to lean without ADSing is a huge drawback for me, making pump shottys not as good on console. Spammable shottys like Ela’s and the Sausage are viable but not really the other ones
---
Usually myself or my 1 friend who plays siege. I try to make calls when soloing but a lot of the time I'm just shouting into the void for all the good it does.
---
So take away her *other* ACOG.
---
Also, who should get the G36C?
---
At max it should slow down the plant speed, it shouldn’t completely cancel it
---
lying with lions will get you killed
---
That's literally disorienting enemies; pretty sure Ubisoft wouldn't keep that feature of his Yokai being able to disrupt plants unless its one of the ways you can use him.
---
On console I was able to get them more often, since more people play without a headset(just use TV speaker or surround sound, etc). On PC, it’s been more difficult(in my experience) since it seems every single player wears headphone/earphones/earbuds.
---
It's not only ranked also casual i die every goddamn time, and if i don't they kill every one i don't wanna be carried. I'm just a level 96 trash player.
---
I dont really like that because people only shoot through if they are pulse or have callouts and if they dont they usually sledge or breach charge so it is useless in that way
---
&gt; and he can distribute it to 2 other teammates
---
And for this reason, I'm out.
---
Right, like it's a fucking talent to be able to use the scorpion yet people just run around with the shotgun
---
I think it’s for lesion
---
This only works for me when there’s 5 seconds left and they have no other choice except to enter through a certain door.
---
It should slow it down and make it harder for the operator to go through the plant animation, as if he’s struggling to find the right key because he’s disoriented. It shouldn’t completely reset a fuckin plant that makes absolutely no sense.
---
And if someone kills her, the game gets ddossed
---
Sometimes you just go through bad days bro, keep at it. Getting salty really hurts too, the other day I lost 250 elo in one day but you can recover from shit like that
---
The gun still had 60 bullets in it, too.
---
Lots of objectives have vertical play, with piano room there’s 2 flank routes for roamers to clear them out, and one of the spawn points where you spawn kill from piano room is bad but wherever else is decent, just learn them. For runouts a claymore or airjab means a free kill, like ones from balcony or piano room windows. It’s fairly balanced except for main entrance with the plant right at the front but you can defend vertically, or defend from spiral staircase, even run out from piano or visa waiting room. Both defenders and attackers have the ability to use vertical play to defend or attack
---
Take it up with Ubi then
---
you see,im tryna make it balanced so that everyone with flashes or smokes doesnt become obsolete and they need to activate it only wardens goggles are passive
---
No she gets respawned and teleports behind the person
---
personally I think it’s one of the best maps, me and my team can always do well, either attack or defense, and we are all plat1, diamond, or champion, idk if it’s a lower rank thing, like not having roamers to stop upstairs play, but i think it’s one of the better maps, opposed to say Villa
---
Reload addicted!
---
I was getting a 2 minute clip off of xbox which is all i could do in the time that i had i didnt know we were gonna end up winning the round. What they do is they lag the servers while they are on defense so we cant move to the obj, because while we were on defense there was 0 lag the entire time bc they were up 2-1. Once we won two rounds in a row the server disconnected. Thats not coincidence.
---
Mainly memes I think.
---
lmao i know. I literally never played bomb until it was forced to be the only mode in ranked and now realize it was the far superior mode all along :'(
---
This is just console in general not just ping tho
---
Rudsianbadger made this post
---
It's a nerf
---
Seems like one of those games that afterwards the entire enemy team decided now was the time to stop.
---
Kaid will be too strong in this case. He’s at a good stop right now. Him having the ability to electrify 6 walls and not be destroy by tatcher will be op on some points.
---
That's what I thought but it's been a really long time since I read it
---
It's not bad on pc, because people with normal guns can out kill a shotty. Take this from someone who plays both platforms, aiming on console is hot ass unless you are really good
---
Toxic players thirsty for that final kill. So many rounds get thrown in ranked because of it. People lose their minds the moment it’s a 5-4-3 v 1
---
1 month for 100 1 taps casual including that's a bruh moment
---
Somebody
---
Idk why it takes 3 guys to all rush in one direction 😂
---
One of the most crucial aspects of R6 that stops a lot of people from getting teamkilled is pushing separate angles. So many players in bronze, silver and even gold get tunnel vision and push the same angle as another teammate, which ends up in either a team kill or both of dying to the same peek.
---
Okay but I still think it's a cool concept

Nerfing a character that doesn't need it isn't cool

I don't think the nerf is cool i think it's how they did it
---
r/R6ProLeague come to the light those who are interested in real discussion
---
60 FOV isn’t really that bad to watch at all, chill out. If it’s above 720p and 60frames it meets the standard
---
Literally unplayable right know
---
Wow they bade r6 inro a book
---
No, but it's a strong indicator of how balanced an OP is. If they never win, they're not worth picking. Also, just because Ubi nerfed something, doesnt mean its OP. That would imply they're perfect at balancing.
---
Yup the solution to this bug is a melee

i was also very confused. It was a plat 3 - plat 1 game so /shrug

shooting through a wall where roaming defenders usually sit to pick off people shortly after spawn
---
Why did you do that to him
---
Why do I have to pick one? Is multiple offenses just saying I’ve been toxic multiple times and not that I have been banned multiple times? I was permabanned in the middle of a match and I did nothing wrong during the match.
---
I have the same one! I had EG sign it for me at the Raleigh Major.
---
Oh for sure, in bronze you have the largest skill gap between bottom and top of the leaderboard because usually the people who at the bottom are actually new players, and the people top fragging are actually Gold players who got bronze in placements and are just working there way out.
---
I don’t know why you can’t turn all the way around. It’s why I avoid repelling for the most part
---
Highest rank I ever got was Gold 1 but like 10 points away from Plat 3 and that was a while ago. This was my main game from launch up until 2 summers ago and I’ve been playing intermittently every since. I think I could easily make it to and complete in Platinum but I play solo so it’s nearly impossible. Most people on console are toddlers, at least in casual and lower ranks, so it’s easy to go 10-2, but my teammates are just as bad as the enemies and rarely go positive. So it’s a positive and a negative to play with toddlers in this game.
---
IQ
---
Or you know, the game could just let me turn another degree or two so I’d have a fair chance at killing the person, instead of completing restricting me from shooting at them. Attackers should have the advantage when gunfights occur outside.
---
You can't.
---
Not really. Echo is pretty balanced.
---
My biggest issue with this game is that I’ve been playing since the beta and don’t have a single black ice skin 😭
---
Why is this toxic? You’re just playing the game.
---
They fell like the power rangers when they got hit
---
The definition of being trolled
---
Same thing with Maverick, a lot of people don’t realize you can use his blow torch to destroy the camera lol
---
shooting thru a wall where a spawn point is, if he was waiting there and insta domed everyone on spawn then it would obviously be a hacker. and he was using a dlc operator, i doubt a hacker would spend money knowing his account would be banned
---
Have you checked in with [Ubisoft Support](https://support.ubi.com/Cases/New) on this?
---
I mean, even Ubisoft themselves confirmed that it doesn't give an advantage yet people still thinks it does.
---
Because you were obviously warned previously since it says multiple offenses. The current game has nothing to do with it. Your previous offenses added up and Ubi stopped the hammer
---
Honestly dont know why either
---
Have you tried requeuing when it gets fairly long?  
---
Are you only having this problem with Casual? Or the same happens with Ranked or Unranked? If so, what rank are you currently?
---
I think it could be the angle idk I don’t like it to high

..... Half? My man, its amazing already.

What’s to criticise about that? It’s really good
