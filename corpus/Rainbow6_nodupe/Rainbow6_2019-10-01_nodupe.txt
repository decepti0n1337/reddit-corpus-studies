Man looking like that girls will flash you to bad you won‚Äôt see it

COURT
---
You aren't alone, but I generally think that Ubisoft just makes bad skins - there are only a few that are actually awesome
---
Anytime
---
Mine was like 1.3 GB
---
I don‚Äôt believe you can change the sensitivity per sight
---
I think that type of customization is usually only available in a battlefield game, unfortunately. I remember seeing those settings in the options for BF4 XD
---
Bf- jager
---
Gf-twitch
---
I agree shouldn‚Äôt have been nerfed, even before I remember getting tons of kills blind firing into smokes. Now he has to stand still in the smoke? At least give him some more smokes or something for that nerf.
---
Are there privacy settings in game, on steam, or on your computer to adjust maybe? Also check your volume settings because you may have it turned down.
---
The ol' switcheroo
---
Yeah, the kid on our team would quick pick zof before I could grab her even though I was clearly carrying, so I did what I could with ash
---
F
---
It was yesterday.
---
Let‚Äôs be real. Pre fire wouldn‚Äôt have worked here. 
---

---
1- if he‚Äôs pre firing, clash probably just stays put 
---
2- there‚Äôs no way for twitch the gauge when clash is going to move. No way to know when to start pre firing to time clashes move right. 
---
Siege gonna siege
---
Ok I‚Äôm sorry but you shouldn‚Äôt have won that, that was horrible aim
---
It was their lack of droning and accuracy that lost the rounds, watching the bottom two play hurt
---
Basically an evolved Castle
---
Iq can with two of the more played defense vigil and pulse plus she is a 3 speed with the only good lmg in the game jackal has ten times less utility sure in a good team that talks to each other but most of the time a jackal waste pings plus iq can do it forever without pings from about 20-30 meters away which you have to be 9 meters max away and hope they have been there recently not with iq
---
Weeellll technically...
---
I wish there was a feature that would allow you to view the kill cam of your enemies at the end of a match.  Would have loved to have seen that.  Nice work Mate.
---
Lion be like
---
it happened to me yesterday, after I told myself that i'll give Monty one more chance after it happened once already, no more shields ever for me, i'd rather get a random 120 in 1 than get knifed through my shield, internet is good so im not lagging.
---
Idiotic fool ,150 to 250 is hell ,ive played my whole life with this shit ping ,it's the worst thing ever in gaming ,i peek ,someone that i have still not seen ,shoots me and i die ,plus the rubberband and shots taking time 150ms to register.
---
thanks! and yeah same. or like a theater mode thing. maybe shows the last 5 matches and you can watch from anyone‚Äôs perspective.
---
That one tap was beautiful
---
Spectating afterwards. Like after you finish the match and you can play it back.
---
So are we going to totally ignore how Lion is basically sitting on an invisible Bench?
---
Just fucking edit your shit and move on, lol.
---
It's honestly probably not because they're the top fragger. They've done something else to annoy the team, or they're last alive trying to clutch (the worst reason to ever kick someone).
---
** blinks **
---
** blinks again **
---
I would pay for N√∏kk to have to magnum
---
Not anymore üòÇ
---
So basically the AK's Great Grandchild.
---
Yep should be a crime
---
I love it
---
Thank you for doing this
---
wtf lion!  
---
he just vibin doe so i'll let him be....
---
r/PiperPerriMemes
---
too*
---
I love faster flicks too. Like the one Beaulo does. But for me technically that is very hard. I play on very low sensitivity for better precision. Exact settings would be 18 vertical 15  horizontal for mouse dpi 400 and sensitivity multiplier at 0.00223 . So for me to flick very fast I would need to put jets on my mouse(/s).
---
You're.. You're kidding right?
---
Ya your probably right my guy.
---
I'm sorry to inform you but it's happen to everyone, I have nothing more to say expect have a good day and good luck fixing it
---
XFactorAiming in your gamesettings.ini file
---
There are like 100000 of ‚Äúnew‚Äù operators ideas that‚Äôs basically a reworked Castle lol.
---
Nope, the ADS effects both and there is no way to separate ACOGs from 1x sights when it comes to sensitivity.
---
That‚Äôs the point, Sergeant.
---
Why is this toxic? Spawn peaking is great. It‚Äôs a fair fight for both sides. Just comes down to aim. Nice shots btw
---
Why do all these conceptual operators have access to the same helmet and visor?
---
Looks cool
---
That could be good but it would also not make sense and it would mess up roamers on ur team. If u blow something up, it usually blows up whatever is near, not what layer its on. And using ur logic u would have to use 2 impacts/2 nitros as a defender to get back to site. If that were the case it would only be useful on windows. It would be WAY too op to be on windows, and doors would be impractical. So i disagree but it is a pretty cool concept. Like if it worked differently(i.e. symmetras hard light but like teammates could pass thru but enemies cant but its not too realistic) also, i think if he just had a liquid thing that blocked vision through the door/window that could be good. It could either dissapear if u jumped thru it or it was blown up(second one doesnt really make sense) and obv both sides couldnt see thru, so it would essentially be a indestructible barricade that u can jump/shoot thru.
---
Glad you love it :D
---
I mean if you‚Äôre looking for help getting out of bronze. You might do better with other ops. Sticking with one op isn‚Äôt the best way to progress in siege. 
---
I‚Äôm just guessing your a newish player and basing what I said about trying other ops on that. Apologies if I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm not trying to offend
---
Dunno, just felt wrong
---
I definetly did not get this message and I was playing around that time (I decided to quit just as the update started).
---
NGL thought the drones had just finally had enough
---
Alright I did. Let's all calm down a little bit lol
---
You earned a subscribble i love your content lol
---
If I was that enemy I would storm downstairs for some food in anger only to come back upstairs with a half glass of water and feeling slightly fulfilled at getting rehydrated
---
I mean if it's *literally* another gun i wonder how that wouldn't work  
---
Even if their name is the same i'm pretty sure they shouldn't collide in the code, just give them different "entity names" and the same "display name"  
---
I don't know a single thing about coding but i highly doubt there's a technical limitation here, even if they're working with spaghetti code
---
People just notice it more in Siege because you hold angles a lot
---
Can we finally get a Glock in this game. Give her a suppressed G18
---
I think she should get silenced AK and revolver shotty xd  
---
+3spd pog
---
???
---
Bruh......that's not how it works. That's not how any of that works.
---
You judge the OPness by seeing the number of rounds the op is present and has won in comparison with the number of rounds he hasn't. Basically, win delta. Lion's win delta is still very high despite the nerf.
---
Castle needs tremendous skill but is underpicked and underpowered. However, he is sufficiently picked in PL. What's your take on this? He's weak?
---
How bout N√ò?

What? Noodle boy fell out of hatch and then killed Amaru‚Äôs teammate. I see no god here.
---
Given Amaru‚Äôs bio she‚Äôs definitely team grandma, she frikken made some food thing I can‚Äôt pronounce as a thanks for Mira improving her goin, gf op prolly gonna be Dokkaebae, she clearly is the most keen for meme, Ela got issues, iq is nuerotic, ash is too focused, twitch is already taken by mr Leslie, nomad isn‚Äôt ready to settle yet.
---
As for bro diddly, Mozzie, Pulse, Jaeger, and Tachanka are clearly having fun if you read the new bios, and castle is the glue apparently so he‚Äôs there to be dd, good guy
---
Team dad is shared between Doc, Thatcher, and Kaid
---
Amarillo is team grammy and Mira being rd director is definitely team momma, making sure all the gadgets work and what not
---
Hah, wrong. Try again

You online?

Hahahahaha I promise you I‚Äôm not hacking. I‚Äôm not even sure if wallhacks are even possible on console (or at least I‚Äôve never seen it). But I‚Äôm such a stickler on cheating I still call people who use mouse and keyboard on console cheating trashcans so if I hacked that‚Äôd make me the biggest hypocrite of 2019
---
I see nothing wrong here. Basically a normal match

I think it's way too early to use the commando 9, how about jager's AR?

You wanna play?

Enjoy the time it takes for your heartbeat to calm, with a massive smile on your face. This is what it feels like to be a god.
---
I didn't unfortunately, my anxiety wouldn't allow it, was far too nervous to do something like that, maybe next time though ahha. Something along the lines of "RED scanning, if it runs on batteries l'll see it" would have been gold
---
.... she... she does. She has a .50AE which basically a magnum pistol round.
---
Nah, I notice it all the time in Siege and CoD a lot, but never in Battlefield. Optimisation and proper coding play a bigger role than people realize.
---
i'm sorry but it's a dead meme
---
I'm talking about in-game. Real life stats are irrelevant to the conversation
---
Nice, I always jump on the car and pop a few shots. Haven't got anyone yet.
---
You should be used to it if you‚Äôre a bandit mainüòÇ
---
It‚Äôs really not an unpopular opinion

Can I request the images from your profile?... For research... The scientific kind

you cute üëÄ

Siege is a perfectly balanced game with exactly 0 bugs, glitches or exploits
---
My best flicks always hit a teammate in the head.
---
Actually like the best cosplay I‚Äôve seen
---
[deleted]
---
Oh ok lol
---
Good idea but change the name. It‚Äôs too much like castle.
---
If you‚Äôre under 16 then I have a feeling that the police would like a word with me

It‚Äôs siegeüòÇ happens all the time
---
Bamboozled
---
What a minute something isn‚Äôt right I just can‚Äôt put my nose on itü§îü§î
---
I don't use the Acog, but I would like to have more shots in that drone.
---
Something is wrong with the games netcode the game has 60hz servers and in battlefield 1 with 30hz servers i had much more consistent hit registration i rarely had shots clearly hit and do nothing
---
Ok thanks
---
My favorite part is the gun, so much detail put into it!
---
I just spent 5 minutes trying to figure out how you killed the montagne with that before realizing hes an attacking op
---
Very funny
---
but did you forgive him?
---
maybe soft booting
---
I love how the replies to this are downvoted to shit but OP totally accommodated the fixes. 
---
And yeah I don‚Äôt think OP-OP accounted for the UBI-windage.
---
OMG THIS IS TOP NOTCH!!
---
I actually agree heavily
---
Very true man
---
Bet Thatcher wishes that 6 inch blade would lose reception now....
---
Lmao one time I did basically the same thing but with Tachankas turret
---
Deadass she does lmao
---
Ddos maybe?
---
Simple. You missed.
---
He kinda looks creepy now.
---
or maybe they all were playing from one place.
---
Hmmm look a girl with a c√∏ck
---
Nomad for me
---
Lord TACHANKA in my opinion because it is fun when you kill a try hard with TACHANKA
---
How to you know they where ddosers beacuse if they where you wouldn‚Äôt have won the game
---
I got that like 2 days ago. I love it as she is one of my mains.
---
Sarcasm much
---
i literally stop playing siege because this was what felt like every death.  
---
and when i'd come to reddit about it, it was like   
---
"yeah yeah thats siege for ya haha" and completely blowing off and allowing this to continue to happen.
---
yessir. cant live without dark mode.
---
You're a knower
---
I need to consistently play because I didn‚Äôt play for like half a month I got back and lost my gold Iv not impressive I know but I lost it
---
The Desert Eagle exists, you know...
---
Yep, that and the fact that deaths matter much more in Siege.  You die in COD or Battlefield, you generally respawn right back into the action.
---

Is Winnie the Pooh still in power?
---
Why else would they be trying to invite the whole team to the party? They were both level 60's and in plat. I can't imagine they'd be anything else. We called them on it so maybe they decided not to blow the game up. I don't know.
---
Anyone gonna mention the Lion just chilling there?
---
Feels good to hit plat, you‚Äôll get even higher next season trust me
---
His codename could be Skeet...for obvious reasons.
---
I was a plat around level 70 and at least me and my friends invite people to a party just to have fun all the time and that makes me a total ddoser
---
I don‚Äôt like it...........
---
That‚Äôs my opinion 
---
Kill me if you want
---
Magnum all the way. 
---
Idk...I just like it and it‚Äôs a lot more satisfying
---
Imagine n√∏kk with a fucking magnum holy shit
---
Not dokkabei, she's constantly calling other guys
---
I'd rather have nothing than a false promise of a "Legendary" skin. Or, IDK, a BUYABLE set.
---
That‚Äôs a glitch right? Or am I insane?
---
If you sit in a dark corner and your opponents have their settings at default then using a gadget makes your character harder to see. Works wonders in casual
---
You can clearly see a 2nd eye from the side unless they changed it recently
---
It‚Äôs literally just lag
---
You shoudve
---
It happens sometimes, restarting your game fixes it, it's not ubi it's just a console bug I think
---
And this is why tournaments are all hosted over wired connections
---
Technically what you experienced is a server stressing, but yeah it's still a thing
---
When grandma R√ò√òK got the sweaters
---
Finka has the best bio however.
---
I'd rather not look for more friends. Unless it's my real life friends (and a select few online friends) I usually can't consistently keep playing with them after the first time.
---
She is
---
I see dead hostages
---
weird flex but ok
---
Why would I waste a dollar, if I had one?
---
Yeah because itd be weird if the bio said he lost his eye and have it not follow up lmao
---
Plot twist
---
N√∏kk, I feel like we have so much in [REDACTED].
---
It feels good to be loved ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I have 9 ping almost every game and this shit happens to me a good bit. Siege. That's all there is to it.
---
;)
---
Seems more like an MIB without the main cast. Good thing they didnt do that.
---
It's like Lion is just chilling knowing damn well that you were about to get cheesed
---
On that 'Must be your first day' type shit haha
---
I feel like I‚Äôm the only person that thinks the new face doesn‚Äôt look awful
---
They got tired of playing on the Plane map, so they switched it up.

you‚Äôre not supposed to aim for the head /s

Bitch this is better than the sketch I spent 2 weeks on
---
It‚Äôs all good, lol, still a good meme
---
The other guy was also a us player. We had the same latency. :/
---
That's fair, perhaps I'll try using him more. Sounds sorta cool.
---
Lol dude are you retarded ? My first comment was a joke, but yeah his character model has both eyes which is obviously an oversight from a dev team
---
Hes playing thermite, I feel like he did something to bandit so he doesn't bandit trick
---
Frost has a new ability were she freazes the attackers bullets
---
My only issue would be that I would have no privacy whatsoever
---
can you not?
---
Lmao crazy Korean gf will keep tabs on you 247
---
Your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù is using third party software.

That‚Äôs against Ubisofts policies.

Okay thanks

This has happened to me on pc before but I‚Äôve never seen it on console

yeah

False. A true ace is killing 5 enemies . your whole team . The hostage and yourself as Fuze

She strafed right just before you started firing... Aim was on point but she moved :)

Like I said "in my opinion", don't got to downvote just because you don't agree with my statement. Now if were being technical here yes BB has terrible recoil, but that's also why I said I shoot in short burst. Have a nice night buddy.
---
I have an op idea I want to make one of these for.  Does anybody have a format I can use?
---
I believe that a mp5 would fit her better
---
Still, to think he wasn't even brought down to half health
---
I like to drop them as far as possible from the spawn point :)
---
62 Horizontal? I was expecting at least 85. I play ~95 and I could have sworn that it wasn‚Äôt that drastic.
---
I did this same exact thing with my friend and he was like ‚Äúok then. Nice aim‚Äù
---
says the fucking lightmode user
---
So did Bin Laden
---
Because then you missed trying to adjust aim on her......slow down video to see. On point flick and aim though ;)
---
Thanks
---
It‚Äôs on console it‚Äôs quite impossible to control the smg 12 and hibanas secondary on console it‚Äôs pretty hard to manage side to side recoil in both directions even if your a very experienced player
---
I like unranked so i can play casually and not have everyone leave or get put in an ongoing match
---
Well I lost connection. I still was able to rejoin just as the match had ended, but I still got a penalty. What the fuck?
---
I wish they could make an out door map like the western one but in a dense jungle
---
Thanks, ill check it out
---
POLICE instead of POLIZEI, unacceptable.
---
Kidding, amazing job.
---
It would fit better yes but it is already the most used primary weapon in the game ... as in the number of ops that have it and probably up there with playtime as well
---
It‚Äôs missing the ACOG... oh wait...
---
what
---
Here suck my c√∏kk
---
I‚Äôd want to know why you sat flash hider are you talking console only ? Because I play on console and idk about that one
---
That lion.....
---
It's mozzie's gun with the cool reload
---
I‚Äôve done this one too many times
---
But maybe you can build a wall in windows and doors that the attacker don't come in this way(sry for my bad English:)
---
Is that a Walther gun?
---
I WANT THIS!
---
online siege is a joke. the servers make no sense at all.
---
maybe his ping was lower... but the no registration of your shot is bullshit.
---
so because I call my teammate who made a bad play bad he has all the right to team kill me cause vigilante justice???
---
No problem
---
Do you mean the lines Alibi herself sees on the holos while standing over them? Those are there to adjust yourself with the holo, the attackers cant see that.
---
Don't cheat at the game.
---
Yea, they have a right. Just accept the death pussy.
---
Because y'all peeked. I see it still in plat people will get kill thirsty almost every time and come after you. If you're on offense and they do it's literally the best possible scenario. Just stay back, anchor, hold an angle. Please lord guys do this.
---
Distance + bad sight for said distance + Recoil hop up = missed shots
---
that‚Äôs my question. do they consider it cheating or not?
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote I just gave my opinion as well
---
It's a cool idea but my version was less aggressive and more of just a unique hard breacher for more options than habina or thermite.
---
Oh hi mark
---
D√∏kkaebi
---
How about make youtube videos
---
Yeah obviously your in the wrong. You thought you could trust ubisoft hitreg? C'mon u should know better
---
Crazy coming back to this thread. I‚Äôm like level 110ish now and I know the game like the bumps on my dick. Crazy what practice does for you. Lmao
---
If you lose the game with the hacker on it, you'll get the mmr back later when the rollback system processes your match. 
---
You only lose mmr if you have a hacker on your team or if you win against a hacker.
---
OkAy but you could‚Äôve cosplayed an operator that‚Äôs actually good
---
Lets not forget about restarting the matchmaking at 3 minutes
---
do u use MnK on console?
---

---
I was happy the time I headshot the doc. Always nice to take him out first. No healing. They do peak a lot lol.
---
Battle Eye is a joke
---
Okay but why is Lion just patiently chilling next to you lmao must be tea time
---
/r/whatcouldgoright

Lmao
---
I don't see a problem

Is the new wall hard or soft?

Holy shit can I hang a poster of you up in my room?

siege doing siege things

Same

Most of the time when I play blitz, the enemy often doesn‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm on spot and clutch them all.
---
Have you tried turning on your monitor first?
---
It was always a thing. In Operation Chimera, we had an event called "Outbreak". Basically, one of the monsters in that event is stuck there.
---
Console baby
---
Also Ezio from AC
---
i seriously wanna a see a healing op on attack . a proper one.( not finaka)
---
Nobody ever sees you
---
I only pick him when I‚Äôm mad. He never fails to just make me more mad.

this skin is actually dope

I honestly thought this was about Lion just chillin' at the side

Have you played Operation Archangel in Ghost Recon Wildlands? It tells you a little more of cavs backstory.

---
I would say it‚Äôs because most of the time they want to do comfortable picks. When you are playing people you are comfortable with you tend to play better. That being said, I have gotten to the point where I am proficient with almost every operator in the game and am willing to put the time and effort into being better as another operator. It‚Äôs not a bad thing to do comfort picks but it is an issue if you have the other operators and don‚Äôt even try to use them.

I love this community

Why can't people crop ? Its not even hard

I feel like buck would be a fun outdoorsy person but at heart loves baking and movies, great husband
---
I feel like nokk would be the most interesting because we know nothing about her, interesting but not wife material, maybe would be a good gf
---
I have mixed feelings about lion because he got his gf pregnant and left for the army, but also went into special ops for childcare, he would be an interesting pick
---
Maverick would be the best because of all the cool story‚Äôs and he will * clears throat* MAKE MAC AND CHEESE, AND NOBODY CAN STOP HIM. But seriously it would be very interesting , he seems very loyal and caring at heart, and would always make your day
---
And never gets banned in competitive...
---
She got to prefire and you didn't. By the time you reacted, the server already had you dead. People don't quite realise the power of peeker's advantage in this game, this is the same thing that makes Mira so powerful, and makes these new deployable shields kinda insane.
---
Yes, you‚Äôre forgetting that this game was made by Ubisoft
---
dude, they should add a game mode where it's random ops with random loadouts, that'd be amazing!
---
The deagle is my main weapon when i play with nook xD
---
Oh ok, I thought so but wasn't 100%. Thanks.
---

I'm not sure why they haven't added anything to protect attackers yet. It is almost instant death if the doc has good aim.

CS:GO has nowhere near this many issues. I‚Äôd argue losing a teammate is even more devastating in that game than in R6.

Not the operator we deserve but the operator we need.

Attacking bf is sledge as he is stated in his bio as one of the operators that is very easy to get along with. 
---
Best Attacking I'd say would be Dokk because sass and outside the box thinking is what she does best and I love it.
---
 Defending bf is maestro because he is very team forward not self concerned as others.
---
Defending gf I would have to say frost because she I a meticulous planner and seems to have her shit together
---
Worst
---
Attacking bf i would say is Capitao mainly because of his fixation on innocent lives while it is a good thing fixation can often lead to completely ignoring other problems.
---
Attacking gf is Ash simply put she is very closed off.
---
Defending bf Echo because as his psych profile states very blunt and dismissive of feedback.
---
Defending gf Cav personal creed to never trust the girl with the combat knife.
---
(Sorry for the long ass comment)

If you didn't solo queue...

The guidelines of this subreddit include the rediquette, which in turn includes looking for the original source/creator of content.
---
It's not a written rule but a very advised one
---
Oh, there is no ‚Äúrule‚Äù per say, but it‚Äôs a thing called common fucking decency
---
I don't get it - can you explain? it's half a reinforcement?? why?
---
Yes, on the server. The client had not received the data yet, so he was able to fire a shot. But the shot didn‚Äôt register because the server received it after OP was dead.
---
This game has gone to shit and it's not getting better...
---
Worst part is those flicks only connect on teammate :(
---
His Peter Tingle
---
You hit the side of the doorway

I thinks that this is very dependent on ping and fps as well. OPs ping and fps are not particularly high.
---
My favorite MMO, back from the dead!?  ::Dashes into phone booth::

goofy shotgun though
---
well look at the new buff. they gave her the "no recoil gun"
---
You've no information about that, we don't see frost movements from this distance. This action just resume a lot of problem that Siege knows for so much time, and probably will never be fixed.
---
Lion just be vibin' tho

I thought of need of more reinforced wall electricutable ops. And i thought 'why not make it electricuted when placed?' And also one flaw of crouch mira placement is that you can get your legs shot. So i thought of op using a half sized reinforced wall that is electricuted when placed.
---
nice
---
*Now I face out, I hold out, I reach out to the truth of my life seeking to seize on the whole moment, yeah!*
---
take my upvote really cool
---
These ideas tbh are very bad. For instance, clash is considered the most balanced shield so doesn't need changes, Monty's problem is the the shield being unable to be moved when hit so he needs Clash's shield hit back effect, and that BB rework is straight up impossible (though I would love him to just be deleted).
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure jager is a pilot no?
---
you do have the equivalent of a wall hack on every single kill so...
---
Frost probably had a lower ping and a slightly faster shot. Bullets still need the slightest time to travel in game, being that this guy was the last alive in him team it ended the game before the trade. 
---
My guess
---
Queen bee
---
Corresponding attacker: snatch - 1 speed
---
Main weapons: C7E and LMG-E
---
Secondaries: Usp 40
---
Throwables: breach and smoke
---
Gadget: An updated version of the pest launcher. The Red Pest can be shot at any electronic device defenders possess except cameras (defaults, black eyes, evil eyes) but it can hack the IFF system of for example Grzmot, GU and booby traps, and most importantly transfer control over yokai drones. Their cloaking will be disabled then.

‚ÄúBullets‚Äù are hitscan, any delay is purely signal latency

Because they are correct. It's just a ping issue.

you're supposed to post there and avoid clogging the main sub with your shit art

Wish we had more comments like yours. The people here are wild, dudes out here cashing in on the hate train and basically calling you a "ubi dick sucker" for even daring to explain it then proceed to say how X game has way better hitreg because they anecdotally never experienced hitreg issues before.

Yes, a shield is able to shoot your head (yes it may be unlikely but it can still happen) without exposing their head. I don't see how it is balanced that every operator can be shot in the head without obstructions and shields are able to disobey that.
---
Tip your fedora I dare you
---
A lot of console players have come over from CoD, or so they tell me, and I notice that they can‚Äôt resist doing dumb shit.

2v1 and they think ‚ÄúI oughta run off obj as Doc and hunt this guy down without even telling my remaining teammate.‚Äù 
---
I swear, I watched a Fuze sprint towards a Bandit that ran out without ever adsing once and he just died 10 seconds in... said he wanted to play CoD after that lmao.
---
Don't bother looking at stats for a while and just play and get the hang of the game and where people come from
---
Haha I had polizei arm pouch, the German eagle thing ;), I couldn't find polizei patch in time

Well he had better ping so u were dead on server, what means that your shots are rejected.

IDF with a galil or whatever that israeli LMG would be pretty neat.

Shields can be shot in the head with them ADSing as well though it's not common and like I said generally requires you to be at a different angle then most other ops

Hi, I‚Äôm Amaru, this is Bandit, and welcome to Jackass.

I think the best example I think is Maverick. When you watch the Mythbusters videos on Maverick by corerooss. You can see that he is a wider range of use, than one might have in the beginning. This demands a good knowledge about certain gamemechanics. On the other hand opening hedges with his torch is possible, but it needs practice to do it in the most efficient way. whether you can do this or not results in the fact, that you can open one one or two reinforced hedges. That is something you have to practice and to look up. It is not easy to do. In conclusion: the difficulty comes down to three parameters: how difficult is the gadget to use (maverick and ying an since the nerf also the shield operators); how much knowledge do you need about maps to use it properly (Valkyrie, Caveira, Castle); how much knowledge do you need about game mechanics to use the operator properly (which includes the interaction with other operators; Amaru and Bandit). Players who get those things wrong, will not bring the operators to their full potential or even harm the own team. That way it is easy to why sledge has a difficulty of one and Maverick a difficulty of three. I hope that helps, though my answer comes very late.
---
I kinda want the Desert Tech MDR in the game. It looks pretty cool, and the last new dmr we got was Kaid‚Äôs shotgun, so it‚Äôs been a decent amount of time since the last was added. If they decide to come back to new guns, I just want a dmr or shotgun imo

Well if I had to tell you the amount times it happens that it does seem that way
---
I think that they need barbed wire. the way that I assume they would be playing it would be advantageous to have a louder sound notification when someone is approaching. Also, they would be most likely an anchor I wonder if it ould be able to put the gadget on the top half of a wall to cover some rotation hole from above.
---
 Shibu I'm your biggest fan and I want nothing more than to fuck your adorable little pussy! I want to see what you look like with cum all over your cute face!

Sword polished and loaded
---
she has lower ping, peelers advantage applies
---
What rank are you bud and what servers eu or us ?
---
&gt; Siege also checks server before confirming hits and/or kills. 
---
This is the main difference, in my opinion. Having server-side hitreg in BF would put tremendous stress on the servers with 64 players in a match - it's just not feasible so the server usually believes the client.
---
In Siege we trade client-side reliability for the accuracy of a server.
---
nope, action to reaction lag is a real thing in this game which is why you never wait for them to move, you must peek first always
---
A common occurrence wouldn't be good, obviously. But I mean like every like 50 matches or whatever it happens.
---
what's your in game name? what do you expect in gold?
---
So many things wrong in this clip. Pulse not downstairs. Didn't stop the plant from going down, was wasting his time in small tower like he's caveira or something. Kaid, who is supposedly an anchor, also didn't stop the plant with C4. The defenders let the site empty so the attackers even had the time to place a claymore. Embarrassing tbh

I'd say Ela because she actually has a character and a proper backstory that goes through trouble and conflict unlike a lot of the other ops who have bios going like they did this and that with no trouble and excel above everyone they've ever known. Kinda like Nomad. But for me I personally like Ela even more as I can somewhat relate tp her main problems in life, and share a few common interest that none of the other ops have. No it's not because she has an ass, she really doesn't compared to the newer ops if you've seen them.  That's not saying she's a waifu or whatever. Her character I just really like compared to everyone else's.
---
Reaction time and half of both of your ping was in consideration. His bullet would have registered in the server before yours due to reaction. Even though you fired a bullet it was after the enemy's bullet registered so your action was discounted. This isn't an issue as the latency time was half both your pings. Not a problem just bloody bad luck.
---
Your enemies can hear when you reload, switch to camera mode, and i‚Äôm not sure what else but as far as operators, someone like Zofia would be nice. That‚Äôs just my opinion though.
---
Damn that tachanka buff is looking sick
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt realize I was speaking to someone in the pro league
---
On which Maps? Or is it in the Main Menu
---
MP5SD would be fine and balanced I think.
---
Agreed. If you don't have latency issues, sieges netcode is pretty good.
---
I agree, sieges netcode shouldn't be compared to Battlefields, the setting is so different.
---
What's your ign? Do I need to be in PL to say that the lower end is lower skill?
---
Friend and I have had good fun pairing her with Buck, baiting caveira and other roamers. Together they have great destructive power, too. (The BuckN√∏kk double whammy).
---
Don't see the point tho, shotguns make high damage in close combat, if you're close enough to kill with a shotgun you're close enough to be heard. At this point better having a higher chance at killing someone with one shot (i.e. full damage) than having a chance at not being heard. The only sg's on which makes sense the suppressor are Nokk's (because she is a stealth op) and Kaid's and Goyo's (because it's more of a precision rifle than an actual sg). My opinion tho.
---
Yes, your expecting too much.
---
It‚Äôs a 1v4 not a 4v1
---
I'm annoyed that N√∏kk sounds more Norwegian than Danish
---
Hm, I agree most operators are fucking mega Chads just kinda getting what they want and not going into much detail. I've never really read her Bio yet but yeah.
---
But let's be real.
---
She thicccccccccccc
---
I remember my first 1v4, just wait for your first 1v5 it's a lot more satisfying.
---
I think enemies can hear the same as you do but a little more quite.

Frost has better ping than you do.

Just type "titanic flute" on YT and the  first video

Hello, new desktop background

That‚Äôs awesome! Don‚Äôt use Twitter, but I support you over reddit

You don't have to worry about grenades now
---
its fine, thank you!
---
How did you get the "rook main"  tag?
---
The kneelbarrow
---
Do you have all ops/do you normally grind enough renown for New ops? 
---
I would always make sure you have ops before cosmetics but I don't care that much for cosmetics (do have a few elites tho)
---
Maestro is clearly best boy, blackbeard also looks chill. I personally find Ela the best girl for my taste she seems energetic, rebellious, 'unique' and has daddy, what's not to like? Dokkaebi also seems nice and as I don't have anything to hide the hacking is irrelevant
---
Mav has incredibly low recoil. Buck is also super easy as long as you don't have acog on, and Blackbeard's is honestly shocking.
---
I have all of them, sledge is my only elite
---
This is so rightü§£
---
Nah we need a narutoxrainbow6siege crossover I would like to see him as Kakashi
---
They lowered the amount of games running per server to try to combat and track the ddos attacks. So less games available means longer wait time.
---
Wtf are you on about? Mk17 has utter AIDS recoil, unless you're using the vertical grip on it like an idiot that gun is a pain to control.
---
I would probably put something that you can shoot to turn off the shock wire(similar to opening a mira), just to give some counter play and not force everyone to pick thatcher.
---
Also with 3 half-reinforcements, you would probably be on hatch duty most of the time, so I'd say remove the ACOG but give some speed to 2-2, because there is not enough time in the prep phase for a 1 speed to do 3 reinforcements. Or keep it 1 speed with ACOG but faster reinforcing motion(like outbreak).
---
How is this still a problem nearly 4 years into the game?
---
I use vertical
---
omg yes haha kek lmao lol xDDD
---
and ash is on the phone,doc isn't healing anyone, ela is painting,therm hands are on fire like he is a super hero, pulse combs his hair,
---
When i think about it... Varna in my language actually means crow...
---
Why?
---
Give me back my ACOG or you'll have to start worrying about grenades.
---
What do you need renown for?

It could be me using her wrong because I mostly try her in Casual/Unranked because I'm playing more utility based operators in Ranked. Once I tried to get into the "sandwich" called area on Border's armory. I droned during prep phase and didn't see any kind of trap. Then I droned it at very start of the round and it was still clear, then Bandit shot my drone. Turned out their Frost wasn't spotted and I fell into a mat she placed seconds after my drone was shot.
---
Your bullets are too slow
---
Well, they had to buff her somehow.
---
It either looks like they‚Äôre fornicating, or Black Beard is taking a Twitch pic for later reference.
---
its true though, it doesnt matter since you know where sight is
---
Dokkaebi Without Glasses at 72p resolution...
---
Yes
---
Im pretty sure she had a c8sfw
---
I dont think any active changes were made. Probably just a small compression/optimization update
---
It has the dame stats tho
---
What happened here? I'm curious but too dumb to understand.
---
Yes m8! Riding a moose and tipping his hat towards us .. best mvp animation, and a smile ofc.
---
I had the exact same thing in the same placeüòÇ
---
Mate, If you already have all the operators, the renown is only useful to buy cosmetics, so i think you shoulda buy a elite skin.
---
im so fucking sick of these black ice posts
---
Could he have a huuuge cheesey grin, and as he tips his hat his teeth do that white shiney ping! :L
---
Oh lordy lord, i'd buy that hahah
---
Lion, Dokkaebi, Blitz, Twitch, and Ash. During prep phase have twitch use her drone to clear out any traps in Blue. Spawn warehouse, rush from the window into blue stairs. Pop Lion scan and Dokkaebi call, Ash open the wall into church which is usually at least partially soft. Flood into church behind Blitz and swarm the site, Blitz smokes the two entrances to church and plants. Then it's just holding site from there.
---
It's a complete trash strat that I think I've only done once, but if you're willing to sweat it out then it works very well, especially if you have not rushed before and the other team hasn't been playing trap ops
---
I can‚Äôt drive through my neighborhood cause everyone has garages and I just want to open them.

You know where we are right? A forum... about a videogame? A forum where people talk about a videogame. OP went out of his way to upload a clip of two players throwing a round. And that's fine, but making a comment reinforcing what OP thinks is wrong? Bruh moment
---
Yep because people have held back buying them every year so far with such minimal content.
---
Not adding more stuff to it doesn't decrease its value.
---
Ok
---
i was about to call this post out for calling the gun an AK, but i googled it first, only to find its a "berillium variant of the AK designed to fire 7.62 NATO ammo". +1 on the post for things ive learnt.
---
But it's silenced at the same stats. FMG loses damage if silenced. Plus Acog if they were to include it. Always is a nice option to have.
---
Oh yeah you forgot the whole part in your Mira. Just ask Maverick to fix it.
---
r_we_wana_fuck_twitch
---
1. yes people can hear you when you crouch walk but it will be really hard to hear. caviera can be silent when she uses her silent step + crouch walking.
---
4. different guns have different recoil patterns
---
5. it shows where the exact person is.
---
6 &amp; 7. valk is a good choice of a operator, but a tip for her is that don't scan enemies right away when you see them with her cams, theyll know there is a valk cam nearby.
---
8. for attack i would reccommend zofia, her gadget is really useful and her weapons are good. for defend, jager is a good choice to use because it stops frags flashes and stuns, and a lot of attack ops gadgets, and has a good guns.
---
The real question is: why holo on bandit's smg.
---
Why would he aim at the toxic smoke like someone was gonna be hiding in it?
---
Even though the k45 has an acog, it seems slightly underpowered compared to other mags like the mp5 or mp5sd, however the gadget and overall the operator idea is great!
---
Oh HELL yea
---
This and if the acog on Nokk is too much of a worry for them maybe even the mp5k would be a good choice.
---
Kind of... but im always shittin myself if they have a: grenade, sofia, ash, fuze, maverick,
---
I always call it oo-e-oo-aa
---
"aw man, I'm supposed to clap them cheeks but im busy watching fortnite outtakes and funnies #5"

They should change it to an Insta down not Insta kill so you can rub it in their face

I solo Queue every season and got plat for the first time last season. My biggest tip is to just keep at it, and care a little less about your rank. For all the seasons until Burnt Horizon I cared so much and gave up after losing games. This season I got placed Plat and have stayed about the same, you just have to keep at it and not care about losing too much
---
You are wrong.
---
Same I solo queue and hit plat recently

Imagine being a Jackal main :(

Damn man you a pro???

Same problem here everyone I play with auto locks 1 op and yell if anyone takes them. I usually just pick different characters depending on the situation, but its really hard to win games when your friends auto lock entry fraggers and three speed roamers

Watch the killcam he killed me a flor below that guy wasn't me

You sound so salty LOL I don't know what info to give. Computer specs don't matter as its not the issue. You're obviously incapable of diagnosing this issue. Just go back to building your Legos homie. You want my sound setting? Sure, it's max volume.

No both operators are garbage.
---
Then it's not a heartbeat sensor
---
NDIL CNDIKD
---
Why would there be any need to buff Pulse to be any more powerful than he already is?
---
Also it's a heartbeat detector...it detects hearts...
---
Zofia is definitely and entry Fragger. But either way just don't pick a main. Find who you feel comfortable with and just play them. Or just learn everyone. Having a flex player is super useful. For example I love to play, hibana, iq, Zofia, thermite, and Thatcher. I would say I main all of them. 
---
Never just play a single character
---
I think it would be cool if it wasnt a flash but just a toggle on flashlight that confuses enemies and makes it hard to see you. And it could work like Vigil and Cavs ability with the cooldown.
---
Well if you bought it before no you wouldn‚Äôt lose it
---
I cant tell if that was sarcasm or not but it was pretty difficult until the last guy. I only had 1 interrogation
---
sounds correct... maybe its just a thing of who has got the better reflexes + interenet connection and ping
---
Before you post think to yourself ‚Äúis what im posting really that funny and original‚Äù
---
The way Mute walked into my crosshair tho
---
I like that idea. We should be able to use it on floors and ceilings too. I've been wishing for that a long long time. It'd majorly change strats in higher ranks if attackers aren't able to open up floors that easy anymore.
---
I don't think that's what happened
---
Play lone wolf

The attacker defense act of 2019, I just made it up and on the internet nobody lies

I did it once without moving or aiming, i missclicked, they all called me cheater but it was funny haha

Good to know that amarus gadget is the most effective 2 minutes into the round as opposed to at the start like its supposed to

It‚Äôs good for your k/d though

No, Lion gets HIS gadget made to be more like how Pulse's gadget works.

Amaru is so useful to capitalize and punish defenders errors in the prep phase
---
Got it would be so cool if they did that. Think of all the possibilities you could do along with cool new ways to get into the map like helicopter in, ride on a side of a car. 
---
I loved the planning in the old game being able to say when to flash bang or breach a door. I‚Äôm so sad they didn‚Äôt keep up with that style.

One can hope

I guarantee you he knows this but half of this sub is brain dead and upvotes anything Tachanka related, regardless how pointless it is to exist.

Shouldn't the defender just get knocked down like from nomad's trap? The fact that her touching a defender just insta kills them seems pretty ridiculous

Didn‚Äôt even get a double kill, shame

Lol did u watch my video on YouTube?

I actually didnt know you can placa he candela on walls, you just teahed me something new! Thanks bro
---
THIS MAN GETS IT!
---
This guy is using Mnk and he admitted it himself
---
To be honest it's a game mechanic, not only Amaru is able to do that. If someone is laying under a window and you enter, you'll kick him and instakill him.
---
She was originally given a galil but beta testers said it was OP so...
---
Saying jk destroys that ngl, it was very clearly sarcastic and that 12vie move destroyed it.
---
No, that‚Äôs aquafresh
---
That‚Äôs what I was just about to ask lol
---
*EMP insentifies*
---
And thats your opinion on Nokk is good, you're like 20% of the community who likes her while the rest hate her and thinks she's useless and needs a gun change.
---
Oh I didn't know that. Guess it's to help balance entering the building
---
Bruv you hit her earrings men is all oke this gem work lol u bot bot bot bot mode yes yes reddit always right player bad

You play xbox besides this everything is fine

I ship it

Fuck skyscraper

How is there a subreddit for that!?

Interesting I‚Äôve noticed everything looks a bit more..colorful as well üòÇ
---
Dont use Goyo shields in OBJ. 99.9% Goyo players get you killed. Placed poorly. They arent shields people, they are TRAPS disguised as shields. Control space, don't deny OBJ with them only.
---
I must agree with i wanna fuck twitch here. Have you seen the incognito headgear???
---
I‚Äôve had a couple games where every round I‚Äôve played is a 1v5. I get your point, but even 5 bad players against one half decent player - sometimes the 5 will win out.
---
A good way to counter blitz which mostly works for me is to try and suprise knife him. For example, stand next to a doorway and wait for him to come in, then knife him.
---
Basically, her weapons are purposely not amazing, but her ability radically alters the game mechanics and basixally turns attackers into defenders and vice versa, so it makes sense. Anytime I pull off an interogation in a match, its followed by at least two more kills by my team.
---
That was uncalled for, and a leak is a leak. No one forced you to click the post
---
u mean make sure you bring shotty as 2ndary also
---
It's like that joke post where the guy is in house and the enemy has the iq of a single-cell organism
---
You‚Äôve just contradicted your own point. You talk about how being able to play as a team is what gets a good rank, yet you say that in bad because I keep losing while having to basically play by myself most rounds?
---
He is decent. From my experience as an entery fragger that his gun is pretty fun. The recoil feels weird at first it's because of the vertical recoil and almost no horizontal which is great cuz there is no rng when you control ur recoil. 
---
Now, when i look at him as a support player (which is my second role) his gadget is intersting. It completely denies bandit tricking, works great to make distactions. Just imagine being a defender, looked in a room because you know there are like 15 mav holes on the wall near you that you can die from. Other than directly countering most people don't use his gadget to it's fullest potential. I'd rank him as a B tier operator if the highest is S and the worst is D
---
Amaru and Goyo don't have new weapons, every single weapon this have is recycled, we haven't had a new weapon since Y4 S1
---
Literally the current top comment is saying he did the same thing but hit a teammate. Not too different.
---
I never said you‚Äôre bad, I‚Äôm saying that just because you have a good k/d doesn‚Äôt mean you deserve to be in gold
---
It‚Äôs okay.

---
Phrasing boom
---
K.D means nothing. Just cuz your K.D is 1.1 on low elo does not mean it will be on higher. If you keep losing you can do 2 things:
---
1. is improving mistakes because im 100% sure you make those and everyone does
---
2. get friends that are better than randoms to play with. Look in the siege community discord server
---
Yeah I made a post a few days ago and got the same reaction from people. I‚Äôve gone 14-2 etc on some games and still lost. Clutched 1v3s etc still lost. If that says im bad at the game then so be it. stats don‚Äôt lie!
---
Only way around this ranking system is to find a team.
---
The real gun is called the Chiappa Rhino, hence Rhino.
---
Disagree. Nomad would be the better pick.
---
You can shoot an airjab to watch your back if you play soloQ but its also really, really helpful if you play with friends.
---
I mean, yeah, that makes sense. But I still think it would be cool just to have cosmetically different optics for all CTUs.
---
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called in real life, the Chiappa Rhino
---
Yeah that happens sometime. Sorry that Ubisoft cares more about money than running a stable game. To fix that btw, you gotta restart your game.
---
It's a robot that roams around the map, spawn peaking random windows, dying, crying because he lost his acog, rage quits, loses elo, deranks to copper and trys again next season. 
---
It may or may not be me im not sure

You can't believe you pulled off two kills?

When holding an angle , don‚Äôt completely expose yourself .  Actually use cover and you will instantly win more gunfights.

Homie needs a buff

Yes obviously some people get bored

And leave

You never punched debris around the map? It poofs up in dust and such

You could shoot it and achieve the same effect

---
It's a trade off.  Improve her recoil much and she will become OP again.
---
The key is to put yourself in fights that play to her strengths--CQC and long range (imo)--and avoid taking them at intermediate range where her recoil is a major disadvantage.
---
The rest of the outfit looks so good, I'd be willing to donate my rather sizable mustache in order to help it along.
---
but this would be kinda unfair,cause the l85a2s acog has a chunky aiming piece but a very long range
---
Nah g8 with angled/smg 11 = rush god
---
I want an 4 speed or armor, this will be cool
---
You‚Äôre a tachanka main so it only makes sense to go as rainbow tachanka
---
Siegto-ber! Did anyone else read it like that at first?
---
Gotta fill in that first row.
---
I would go in this order: Bandit, Rook, Mute, Jagger, Smoke, Doc then whatever
---
no worries
---
No u
---
not really on xbox i only solo qued and hit high plat every season. on pc i hit plat every season while solo queing. i don‚Äôt understand how people can say it‚Äôs cause i only solo q in this rank

His ping was 9 actually, lowest in the lobby!
---
Get all the basic operators, much better to get all of those then 1 or 2 DLC ones
---
*He‚Äôs coming*
---
RUUUNNNN!
---
Why is this so true üíØü§£ü§£
---
I like you.
---
See the problem with that is it relies on things like the enemy not droning or understanding the gimmick.  Ali is better used to block vision with the holograms, block windows (or doors with shields in them) from being entered/shot through without giving away their location.
---
Nice. Just ordered the same case in red.
---
lol that thermite almost looks like one of the Sack people from the movie '9' with that lighting.
---
fam bb has been nerfed into the ground. you can hs him when he has his shield up. his shield can be one hit to break or 2. also his guns are kinda shitty. he‚Äôs completely fine in his current state.
---
I remember in a ranked match on Bank, we were in vault and Thermite and a couple of others, including Monty, tried to break through after rushing tunnel. I sat on my drone and shot the thermite charge. Monty even tried blocking the second and third, but failed.
---
Next round they brought a Sledge and instantly destroyed my cameras :(
---
Pretty sure the first few shots were above their head. 
---
The last two, though...
---
What? It definitely tags you.
---
Dont worry, youre playing R6 and youre supposed to play tactical and slow. This isn't COD. All games have different playstyles.
---
Why did i hear the shooting sound?
---
I got banned for a week for calling you a faggot once and I don't mind it happening a second time. Are you the fucking CEO of fun police or something?
---
We should play sometime :)
---
Kapkan's lowkey pay to win that shit is DARK
---
if youre not a child i hope youre getting help for whatever mental deficiency you have that makes you act like one
---
Elite controller flex!
---
i really like the weapon idea. but the gadget is completely useless if you need a gadget to amplify sounds then just turn up your volume and every movement in siege is really loud. (you can hear adsing pretty far, people turning their screen, crouch walking and alt walking.) also you can‚Äôt be 3 speed with 2 armor. you can only have 4 total points in speed and armor. so 3 speeds ‚Äúhave‚Äù to be 1 armor etc. and the tracking part of the gadget also isn‚Äôt a good idea because everyone complains about jackal when he isn‚Äôt op imho.
---
Thats true. Itsa tactical shooter so i dunno why people shit on "campers"
---
IQ needs either grenades or a little buff for her Ability.
---
I love to use IQ but i feel pretty useless since i cant even toss a grenade to destroy the gadgets inside. Id have to peek and prolly get killed in the process
---
Um it was a 1 v 4
---
N√∏kk is not a bad operator. Just having the ability to be invisible on cameras is crazy powerful, and I know I‚Äôm right cuz she has been seeing a ton of play in pro league and G2 (basically the best team) banned her. Also the FMG is so underrated. It has a high rof and has no recoil.
---
Pfff u know I go for angled, red doot, suppressor and lasuh saiht
---
He got the shot off first. yay latency.
---
I mean, the ban was well deserved. Just because someone doesn't like a meme you like doesn't call for homophobia, you ass. And no, I just know when a meme has run its course and personally it's so fucking annoying to see it anymore.
---
how many times is this glitch going to be reposted? we‚Äôve all seen it at least a hundred times
---
But a joke has to be funny. This isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs been done to death, and isn‚Äôt even slightly accurate
---
Exactly the point is to roam around or hold an angle without them knowing not hiding your identity
---
you're the one who needs mental support get the fuck off of my thread
---
THE JAGER....
---
And That's It
---
Either way, still a underrated gun
---
I clicked the link, and it was certainly a Reddit sub. Not really sure what else there is to say about it.
---
I don‚Äôt think that would be useful considering a large portion of people use discord and the console party chat to communicate.
---
speak english wtf are you saying.
---
As a hibana main, your job is to blow the wall/hatches/mira set up ASAP. If you die beforehand, it will really hurt your team and slow down their progression. You aren't a roamer hunter so just set up a solid perimeter. Also, if you're fighting for the breach then your teammates (should) help out and that will help coordinate the attack with randoms. My biggest pet peeve is people who pick hibana and just ride out her gun and dont blow anything. Make sure you aren't that hibana!
---
Reeeepost
---
Words that apparently are to hard for you to read
---
Well shucks, just tryna help people wherever I go y‚Äôknow? But thank you for the very kind compliment and no worries, however please do know that I‚Äôm always happy to lend an open ear anytime you need someone to talk to. Have a wonderful day yourself :)
---
Yeah, but what about just in game? It could just disable mic and text chat as so much of the majority of people use it. Good thinking tho.
---
I almost never see a cap player use smoke, in fact I haven‚Äôt seen it since he was released. His fire is definitely useful and can be amazing depending on the player. I do think that frost is probably the worst operator in the entirety of siege rn.
---
yANo I don‚Äôt think siege is meant to be a game to just casually play.
---
Both are great, but it's kinda meh that Dokk got her full uniform with the pattern unlike Vigil who got some black details in his "armorer" parts of the chest.
---
Okay but I've been getting this a lot since two years. Also people with less response time monitor + FPS tends to win every face to face gunfights. Also RAM frequency does more impact in FPS games rather just FPS boost. Seen lots of people claiming after upgrading RAM (or OCing it) they found accurate hit-reg &amp; first to peek &amp; shoot enemies.
---
I don't get vigil. Like how is this skill useful?! I'm a noob btw
---
On a 2016 cam...
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. 
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). 
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. 
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because IQ was already dead.
---
That was a close second actually!
---
Hehe nice one
---
Anything I should be aware of b4 I click it?
---
What are they for?
---
Imo definitly worth it. Hes one of my personal favorite cuz his shield will save you life in many situations. I also like his gun but thats just what I think.
---
I use the HyperX cloudstingers. Bought them for 50 bucks when my main pair broke as just a filler until I got enough money to but a better headset. Ended up loving them and for 50 bucks you really cant find a better deal. Had them for almost 2 years now and no complaints!

Seconded

It's safe for work, it's just.... Odd.

I agree completely, the should improve the matchmaking system for the rest of gamemodes.
---
If you that as in all over the place then yes I do Therefor i find wut you said understandable.
---
if you that as in all over the place makes no sense. therefor i find wut you said understandable. also makes no sense.
---
\&gt;  I started 3 weeks ago on pc. First time playing siege.  
---
This.
---
The game matches you with people that are similar to your elo/rank even in casual, so because you're recently starting the game it'll match you with people that are also recently starting to play.
---
Also Casual has a hidden elo in it, so if you lose you'll lose your casual elo which means you'll get matched with even worst teammates and so on, it's a slippery slop at that point.
---
Warden is the worst operator in the game no cap
---
Yay
---
Still better than tachunks.
---
not sure why but I got the bundle for free. It showed up in the scroll thing on the main menu and it said owned and when I equipped to all I had it on. Idk why and I know I didn't buy it.

Mind thy tongue, peasant! To speak blasphemy against the Lord is most notably condemnable. May He be inclined to mercy, lest thy rankings plummet.

No one is going to mention the wall is soft...

Yeah and your a ash main so therefor you don‚Äôt understand the immense power that is warden
---
And as a warden main, you would be wrong in every respect
---
It can make sense if you have enough sense to fix in your head, instead of seeming to struggle with reading like a kindergartner

Btw you are able to shoot out the floor and the metal beems keep it there and u can still hit it.

Ooooo bett

Operation health was my best ever ranked season so yes definitely, got to plat 2 in week 2 thought ‚Äúyep this is good enough for me I can die a happy man‚Äù never played it until next seasonüòÇ
---
Yeah but I thought we were talking about just shooting the hologram in the head? Ik with nokk it doesn‚Äôt
---
Happy Cake Day!!
---
How the hell are you actually gonna back that? And if someone accidentally says yes instead of no for the intentional team kill? Sorry but you are just gonna have to learn that you will die to teamkill in this game. There is less in ranked if you want to try that. This community is incredibly toxic, you aren‚Äôt gonna escape that.
---
Yeah I kill a lot of teammate truly on accident. They walk in front of me or decide to run into my gas.
---
They have a newcomer playlist now just for new players, so feel free to play Rainbow. You‚Äôll get better over time and all will be good
---
It's never too late
---
Another guy reminded me we were talking about nokk here. If we are talking about her then you‚Äôre right. I thought we were talking about in general.
---
I log in and got it free
---
there has to be tking in the game otherwise some shut i don‚Äôt have the time to explain will happen. and it‚Äôs casual and unranked it‚Äôs suppose to be for fun and just to hop on and play right away.
---
No definitely not. Watching YouTube videos, playing situations and watching tutorials can help you. It‚Äôll take you a while to definitely get ‚Äúgood‚Äù at the game and used to it but definitely not to late if your looking to get into to it.

Does anyone use vigil for his ability? I think he just had a solid gadgets and guns

can you shoot a emp grenade with evil eye?

I think you're overexaggerating what's happening to you. Siege matchmaking can be borked sometimes but it isn't out to get you. You're still new and you need to work on your game. GL.
---
If it remove the white bar at the bottom... Maybe but i dont know how big of a buff this would be. Maybe too strong or maybe not.
---
Then the camera clips through his shield and kills him... it happens.
---
Its more impressive that you were able to keep yourself collected in the frenzy.
---
Luckt
---
I understand - sometimes I wish it didnt happen nearly every game though like what is the deal?
---
Lmao the speed typing of Gg at the end
---
Why even try to play a game thats been around for 4 years. You're level 60 and complaining about things that are talked about every singoe day. Dont wanna be teamkilled in casual? Stop playing casual. If you're grinding n trying to get better then play in ranked. Get stuck in copper with all the other noobs and go from there.
---
Seems like you don‚Äôt have lots of friends in the game. Keep playing and making callouts, you‚Äôll eventually end up forming sort of your own community  and thats when this game gets fun.
---
I‚Äôm not ranked. I don‚Äôt try for ranks lol.

Is this good? https://imgur.com/a/o2y7UwK

Got you bro.

Normally when this happens its it because my am but because I panic tho.

no idea why you‚Äôre trying to say. but mira doesn‚Äôt need a sub op

Not a shooting range but another option that is solely dedicated to training. Yes thunt is a thing but it's not dedicated to it and it's not as useful as something like the community training maps on csgo.
---
Check out his post history, he's literally farming karma
---
You sound like a low-level console player.  Console is like 100x more toxic than PC, which is fairly toxic itself.  Best advice-find some friends to play with.  Even one that you play with regularly will help cut down the toxicity by quite a lot.
---
I like your style. I appreciate the feedback.
---
I'm not to sure whether or not you would have to. Goyo has an acog and is 2 2
---
Haha yeah I'm a senior in mechanical engineering. It's been a while since I saw mathematics without variables, so i assume with the art detail that OP is high school or up, and the problem complexity with also the time of school year it's probably a calc series problems. Because that's when limits and series start getting thrown around.
---
I only know that because i saw youtubers doing it when she first came out
---
i mean out of the store? out really out not IN the store
---
Funny that's my wallpaper for my phone
---
According to Google, Japanese and Spanish are the top two.
---
so let me explain it to you :
---
GIGN : Rook , Doc , Twitch , Montagne 
---
If you didn't buy any of them . Their prices will be at 500 renown . Buy ANY of these operators from the same CTU . Like by doc for example . the rest of the operators will have an increased price . So Rook . Twitch and Montagne will be priced 1000 . the price will increase if you buy more operators from the same CTU . You get the idea
---
Looked like 6 seconds actually :O
---
actually braindead, listen my man if you read OP post and his replies he clearly states 
---
&gt;  PS4 acc linked to uplay, uplay linked to steam, just give me the ops I have on ps4 and skins 
---
so you trying to push that he is stealing or what ever, also i didnt quote you i quoted the OP, you would know that if you actually read the post.
---
 you actually struggle with basic comprehension, now im guessing you are a foreigner since a native English speaker wouldnt be having these issues. so keep up the lessons my man. one day you will understand.
---
I mean, the fact that they have the most victories numerically doesn‚Äôt exactly mean they‚Äôre the most successful as a percentage of wins versus losses would be the better indicator for military success. That and the fact that France technically won WW1 and 2 despite being rolled over for most of the war shows that the stats may be somewhat skewed.
---
Why does he look like he had to do it to em
---
i don‚Äôt care my uplay name is prism._ i don‚Äôt play a lot but if you want to play me fine. i‚Äôm just telling you it‚Äôs easy to play solo q.
---
That gun is so hard to one tap with tho
---
I only play terrorist hunt on house because the size and don‚Äôt feel like walking around for 10 minutes to finish the mission. But I always enter through the garage and every time within like 30 seconds of breaching the doors like 3 or 4 terrorist walk up behind me. Now I expect it but I used to get caught off guard because of the enemies that go outside
---
Lmao this community is so toxic, I'm just trying to offer an explanation beyond "HURR DURRR THE GAME IS BROKEN" but why don't you keep being an ignorant asshole to strangers on the internet dude.
---
But Doc is French
---
Yeh but I got charged 1000 renoun for sledge who was the first sas I bought on this account

Then ubisoft might have changed things

Fuckin sick
---
Your a ducking retard you are refusing to read the top of his post and even my post the main part of his post is how he is mad that beacause I got a free trial for uplay+ and then canceled he his mad that they took away the ops and I said wow this guy is a idiot beacause he is mad that he canceled his uplay plus membership you are refusing to read the top of post and then my post beacuse you know your wrong
---
Likely
---
How was France rolled over in ww1? Are you sure you're getting your facts straight there? Also doing badly in world war 2 doesn't make the rest of your over 1000 year long history non existent does it.
---
Something here is out of place.

Don‚Äôt forget the glow stick

big facts

Hey, mate, your phantom sight menu animation glitched.

He likes to feel pretty
---
&gt;it doesnt show the enemy where they are getting shot from they tend to freak out a little bit.
---
Tbh it's terrible that it doesn't give off a tracer for the simple fact most people listen for sound not look for a tracer and if your shooting at someone unless it's though a wall they should be dead or they are looking at you and shooting back making it not matter. üòÇ

&gt;Plus most guns I use have high fire rate so they drop health quick
---
Yes, this is true but the trend for faster fire rate guns on R6 is lower damage and more recoil. This makes headshots easier at close range and significantly harder at long to medium range.
---
 This also makes the gun a joke vs other guns if you don't hit a headshots as most guns will outpower a fast firing peashooter.
---
y‚Äôall realize they‚Äôre are metal beams in the floor right? That‚Äôs not a glitch
---
A touch of color? A Shadow that isn't right?
---
All of it!
---
Not with me. Lol if you played on console I'd show you
---
So no actual help? Alright I gotcha
---
Need to gr8nd up to get those renowns. 
---
Although theyre pretty cheap compared to the new seasoned ops.
---
Base: 500R -they go up 500R everytime you buy one
---
DLC OPS: starts from 10K renowns to 25K renowns.
---
In all seriousness, it could do with some color.
---
What are pilot skins?
---
Well I'll keep it in mind thank you
---
god i hate brainlets. his post was that if they can give and take away ops based on things you have purchased tied to your account the why cant things be transferred from your console account to your PC account even if the purchases are tied to your steam account ( hence his comment on why  cant he transfer his PS4 stuff to PC) but you are too slow to understand so lets ask op. 
---
 [u/RobyX450](https://www.reddit.com/user/RobyX450/) is your post about transferring stuff from consoles to PC or is it about keeping your OPs from Uplay+
---
That's soo me, sorry guys! But you ain't getting in this objective!
---
Downvote cuz Hereford.
---
40% is still 40% but 40% of a constant is going to be not noticeable.
---
thanks
---
I thought it was a joke about them being white

Hello BopThaLiberal, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dc24xo/an_attacking_pulsemira_combo_would_be_amazing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You aren't gonna get shot just because your fake gun doesn't have an orange tip, I was actually running around in full airsoft gear and the police just stopped me to say that I looked cool wearing it.
---
And while the last part is probably debatable, the fact that you aren't going to get shot in most "western" countries that aren't the US isn't, civilians simply don't have access to that kind of weapon anyway.
---
It's almost like being the country nearest to the country you're fighting means that you'll see more devestation than a country on an entire other land mass. Who would've guessed? Also you've said that successfully was the wrong word but nothing else you said was right either. When was France conquered? Besides land they lost on their Eastern border the vast majority of the country remained under the control of the French Republic. Also just because a country wouldn't have won a war against a far more industrialised and populated country without the help of its allied doesn't deter from the fact they still won. Britain couldn't have won ww1 without France. Britain certainly couldn't have won the napoleonic wars without aid from Prussia, Russia and Austria.  America wouldn't have won ww2 without soviet help. I feel like you're saying so much stuff in the context of France and not realising how literally every other country goes through similar stuff. The soviet Union was far more heavily affected in ww2 than France was in ww1 and yet both remained independant and won the war and yet u don't mention Russias tendency to surrender? Even when Russia did actually lose ww1.
---
Lol. Everybody else. There are plenty of people here that think it‚Äôs funny. Mostly because it is. It‚Äôs kind of ironic too. Spend all that money on a gun only to paint it like a lego.
---
I meant the more nsfw subs, i'm sure someone has drawn something with a machine gun
---
You spelled acog wrong.
---
What did they say?
---
pro tip. aim and it looks more like an alibi
---
It's not a ping issue, dude was fully on the screen just really hard to see through the fire.  Y'all are completely missing the point of the post.
---
Frost with an ACOG lmao.
---
I am already thinking about how busted that would be.
---
Remember when Basketball was good, and you could actually defend, allowing players like Shaq to get really high up on the ladder. Nowadays you have overrated little 5'4 players like Curry who are able to run layups because agressive defense is a FOUL now. OH no please don't foul me, I'm steph curry and my body is frail. Basketball kinda sucks now.
---
The idea Frances war record would be skewed because of aid from the allies is such a dumb claim too. I don't know if you realised but every major war usually is heavily centered on alliances. Why is Britain or Russias military record not also skewed?
---
the post is literally about how he is fully visible behind the fire, yet most commenters speak about peeker's advantage.
---
for shame
---
Lol busted is an understatement.
---
Why not?
---
Same objectives, same day, two matches, two seasons ago.
---
Clean is a bit misleading.
---
People think it's funny because they are laughing at how someone is genuinely stupid enough to consider doing this. Read between the lines.
---
I wasn‚Äôt being mean I just point out that you were lagging
---
&gt; If I hear ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt buy it‚Äù one more time I‚Äôm gonna scream
---
LOL same
---
And only 2000. Saddening
---
So why are you here?
---
This is fucking stupid just delete this
---
This is a very normal kill. I want my time back
---
You cant get the full sets with the free packs and im unable to pay 60 bucks to get all of them...
---
I agree. House was too much fun, it's coming back soon though
---
I too anialate
---
I'll add you. But solo is not easy. You must have gotten lucky every time. Most of the time I solo queue, my team either doesn't talk, doesn't know how to play the game, or can't aim. And I mean that's fine, gotta play the game to get better, but still. Lose most of those games.
---
Doot doot
---
Never unsubscribed, probably gonna try it again in a month or two and inevitably stop again. Why do you care?
---
It‚Äôs a horrible argument. People use it for the event alpha packs and the battle pass and it‚Äôs so damn annoying.
---
It's 100% against the rules. It's against the terms of service to use any kind of third party service to give you an advantage. Using a mouse and keyboard on console REQUIRES A THIRD PARTY DEVICE.

---
You're wrong, it also doesn't specifically say that I can't use aimbot, does that mean I can? It falls under the blanket rule of using a third party service to give yourself an advantage.

Or the laser revealed your place cause he saw it
