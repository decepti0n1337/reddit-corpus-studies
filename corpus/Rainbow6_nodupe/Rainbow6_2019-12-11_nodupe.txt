Is it weird i say both?
---
Camera there wouldn’t be too useful anyway. Probably was considered in dev.
---
Oh what? That fucking preview video confused me. It’s really uncommon in my experience to find counters to bandit, kaid, mute using their stuff at times and positions you can do things to stop the gadget itself. Weird way to set that gadget as destructible in a manner it’s not going to be acted on much. At least it’s relatively easy to deal with
---
Casual has its own rank-system but you don't get to see it. At one point, some players start messing around in casual rather than playing seriously which means they lose and therefore their casual "rank" decreases. Then they end up going against newcomers even though they are more experienced.
---
What? I also main Nokk and the only reason she’s kind of meh is because her primary sucks
---
For a casual gamer, 60 hours is a long time
---
Aw, this made me smile, thank you :)

I know it wouldn't be useful, but it just makes me think
---
Yes...and I said why that matters still in the last few sentences of my post.... I actually call you out that youd say this exact thing lmao so thanks for that laugh. 
---
You say the graphic wasnt real enough.
---
You say its just a game when I pointed out it is a real graphic and there are good reasons it's used.
---
You don’t seem like an aggressive player then so I can see how you don’t take advantage of it

Your animations are so fluid , I loved

I think Twitch is pretty straightforward to use compared to Buck and Maverick. Those two have more depth, and require more hours to master. If you really like Hibana, I'll suggest you to use Twitch.
---
He looks like master chief.

If you're a halo fan, I get it. I personally didnt care for it.  And honestly I could've dealt with it if the mvp animation was cool.

r6 tracker shows the last rank you were I believe. and I don't think any site shows before operation health because ubisoft.

---
Of course you can but I think it would also be good for people who join ongoing games and get put in a lobby just before the new round starts. They are assigned a certain operator, maybe they don't like the current loadout but they have no chance to change it. Happened to me some times because I choose different loadouts for certain ops depending on the map.
---
where? he had a insanely low pick rate BEFORE the nerf [https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-352473-16/y4s23-designers-notes](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-352473-16/y4s23-designers-notes)
---
Yeah why don’t they show before operation health ?
---
As a Puerto Rican, can confirm.
---
One of his comics iq shot recruit's baby yoda doll thinking it's an enemy gadget and a comic before that i think since mozzie is the shortest op in the game sau siege made a baby yoda version of mozzie. So in this iq is apologizing for shooting recruit's doll so she gave him a baby yoda version of mozzie.

This is beautiful. Thank you
---
It’s always been a contender against the spas but no it feels great.
---
Why are you saying boohoo for he is complaining about it?OP is just asking a simple question about why his friend got the higher rank than him just because he was curious about it
---
This gun would be good if they shrunk the model like they did with all the other pistols.
---
Because i felt like it.
---
My first ever airsoft game i witnessed something similar. It was witer and snowballs were "deadly". So i sneak about on the field and out of the blue a snowball hits me right in the face, a dude jumps up from a bush wearing full white camo so i never saw him, he grabs some BBs from his pocket and flings it at the guy behind me, thats how i -half blind with my mask full of snow- learned that BBs kill no matter the method of propulsion
---
Good to hear, I may switch to it and test it out to see for myself. I just could never get kills with that gun ever since Cav came out.
---
You can save videos straight from the xbox app

---
The only real difference it’s it’s more/less likely to down dependant on range/armour. Obviously that’s not the main priority with that weapon but you get the point.
---
it's also on attack and it had the ACOG removed just for Wamai, Warden could be given the P90 without the ACOG.
---
List your platform for fucks sake.
---
Ah, nothing like the toxic siege community. Feels like home

Yep. Love it.

the best part for me is when you look at your feet to rappel down safely.

might be usefull since the general trend is to attack from top to bottom

What? Am I weird for calling him "Kaid"?
---
Most of the time the attackers have the advantage over the spawn peakers
---
Can we have rebrute an iq play with lightsabers and a baby yoda figure please
---
LMAO XD
---
Triggered people incoming “dude just shoot back bro” yeah no you are actually terrible at the game if you spawnpeak and while its not against the rules to do so however do not tell your friends “yeah im pretty good at siege” if you do fucking spawnpeaks
---
nøkk
---
If u get spawnpeeked all the time u just bad , it's fact
---
The whore that can see dildos in nightstands is the monster
---
It’s literally just a single nitro kill

I like spawnpeekers for the easy kills

---
no I hack halls
---
Lmao definitely carried with a 0.8 wtf
---
One reason I main her
---
What was the criteria to get it? I don’t remember doing anything at all. I don’t even know what year it came out
---
Me and my squad have been playing siege since launch, so I was looking for ways to spice things up a bit.
---
For those of you too young for Bingo, let me give you the low-down. Everyone in your squad gets a different board when they click the link, but they share the same objectives. When one person knocks something off the list, everyone can mark off that item. First person to get 5 in a row in any direction wins! For extra spice, get a pool of money together (like $1 each) and agree to send it to the winner. Illegal gambling - hooray!
---
Actually, you're still good if you have to fight for it. People fight back a lot (I don't spawnpeek) and it makes it difficult. So if you make it out with like 2 kills and a lot of health left, you're pretty good
---
Ok so now players just alt-f4 to quit the match, now what?
---
I say it nøkk but it can also be said nøkk
---
I’m not crying you are
---
Why does Baby Yoda sound Australian all of a sudden
---
i literally hate when people make it look like that it annoys me so much
---
the only way this would've been better would be if it was a sniper op who killed kapkan.
---
Type in rainbow six siege into google play and it's the first one
---
Hmmm, you must play a lot of custom or just maybe an hour at a time idk. I started in velvet shell and I'm level 269.
---
Yeah he’s definitely stream sniping you...

thats his overall abandon not seasonal....

Weird. Does it work in any other programs? Or is this a strictly siege issue?

yup works fine on discord. its just siege

Reset in game audio settings to defaults and or re-do the config file and give it a shot?
---
Idk about that, it says for this season you have a 0.8 which doesn't display your claimed "positive kd" although if your overall kd is somehow worse then maybe it will go up. GL
---
The .8 kd represents the current season
---
Oh don't go buy kill cams. Because the crouch and lean spam delay is in effect but doesn't show accurately on kill cams.
---
That just doesn't feel right to me, but alright
---
Plus if u get knocked as doc u can revive urself. Only revive if they don’t finish u off after the nock. Headshots will still kill obviously

Lmao

&gt;You may now laugh.

I don't.
---
I hate myself for getting spawnpeeked, because spawnpeek should have been an easy kill for me but I missed.
---
Getting spawnpeeked is the victim's fault for not droning/pre-aiming for a free kill, because the defender just capitalised on the attacker's dumbness/bullheadedness.
---
[removed]

Hibana audio has been a bit weird for me too since patch. Sometimes I don't hear them heating up, sometimes I don't hear the blast. I'm sure they are probably aware of it by now, but you aren't crazy if that's what you were wondering lol.

---
&gt; spawn takes very little skill and, if you have half a brain, risks very little
---
The attackers have time to remotely drone out all the windows near their spawn which they pick to spawn in. They have faster RoF guns, with more dmg and more acogs.
---
The attackers can also leave the spawn from multiple different angles while the defenders need to stay near the windows. 
---
Spawn peeking is a high risk, high reward chance that the defenders take.

"Via libre, puedo seguir el rastro" "Free way/entry/route, I can follow the track"

Not the size and shape, because that will make things unbalanced.

Definitely diamond-campion only because most of plats have syndrome called "I'm the best you are bad" and it's damaging the game

Noottt looking to mentor, but I okay PS4 and I'm level 76. Never played ranked, but I'm looking for a squad to play with or just random games if ur up for it
---
There live now, and lemme tell u, they feel SOOO good.
---
Yes, but there will be less obstructions so it will have less cons. Making it unbalanced.
---
It's basically better to play meta opers instead of useless cav , hoping someone wouldn't drone ur hiding corner and get interrogation
---
Because it's WRONG! It's like you drive a Honda Civic and you swap the Honda logo for a Ford.
---
And it's not a conspiracy. Ubi uses Azure servers, which are owned by Microsoft. Ir was easier for them to launch onto ps4 the xbox.
---
Mine was drone holes :/
---
True. I would put her as an op you play once throughout the match when they are east expecting it.
---
I had that happen, used the verify file integrity or whatever its called or just tried to relaunch it and it scanned and worked fine.
---
Thanks, and wow, what are the odds of my cake day and anniversary of being with my current employer would be on the same day.  Crazy.

Kaid trick is fine, but Bandit tricking has more thrill

Hi would just like to ask once the servers for pc are up and running will there be placements for the South African region or will we have to carry on with our EU ranks for this season and if so will it change in year 5?
---
I have spoken.
---
Guess so. We'll see at the end of the season how she performs  I guess.
---
Once you unlock all the base game operators it’s best to try and experiment playing each one. Once you find your fit, move into the year operators and next thing you know, you have a main that fits your play style near perfectly

Like I guess some of that sounds rude, but you're really cherry picking here. You're assuming that these basically singular points of interest on the maps are literally game-breakers. Like you really have to assume the defense is getting molly wopped and the attackers can just do whatever they want to get here lol. What happens when diffuser gets dropped in the middle of the building? 
---
Is she gonna go in there and get it? Where are those mighty powerful angles now... right? It's okay for operators to excel and be useful in one strong spot but less useful in others. There is nothing wrong with her being able to hold long angles well. Anymore than glaz or anyone else with a DMR. Except black beard. Fuck black beard lol.
---
Nah, I'd rather not expose myself to any more cancer than is required of me. No acog is best acog

Я тебе зкажу, я закончил вершину моего класса в ВДВ, и я принимал участие в многочисленных секретных рейдов на Аль-Каидой, и у меня есть более 300 подтвержденных убийств. Я тренировался в парижском войны, и я сверху снайпер в целых российских вооруженных сил. Вы ничто для меня, но только другая цель. Я протрите тебе нахрен с точностью, подобных которым никогда не видели раньше на этой Земле, запомните мои чертовы слова. Вы думаете, что вы можете уйти с того, что дерьмо для меня через Интернет? Подумайте еще раз, ублюдок. Как мы говорим Я контактирую мой секретный сеть шпионов по всей России, и ваш IP-трассируется прямо сейчас, так что вам лучше подготовиться к шторму, козу. Шторм, который стирает жалкий небольшое вещь ты называеш твоя жизнь. Ты находишься чертовски мертвых, малыш. Я могу быть где угодно, в любое время, и я могу убить тебя в более семисот способами, и это только голыми руками. Я не только обучен приемам рукопашного боя, но у меня есть доступ ко всей арсенале Воздушно-десантные войска, и я буду использовать его в полной мере, чтобы вытереть задницу жалкий с лица континента, небольшое дерьма. Если бы только ты мог знать, что нечестивый возмездие ваш маленький "умный" комментарий был готов обрушить тебе, может быть, ты бы провели свой гребаный язык. Но ты не мог, ты не сделал, и теперь ты платишь цену, ты идиот проклятый. Я дерьмо ярость все над тобойи ты тонуть в нем. Ты находишься чертовски мертв, детка.

---
I mean I may disagree on most things with you but I do agree with one point. Fuck Blackbeard.
---
The start of the season is based of the rank you had previous season. If you get matched up with these guys that means they aren't all that great players either, even tho better than you
---
That first part sounds like your headphones are backwards.
---
Been playing since red crow. lvl 165 with 1600+ hours. i'm still shit.
---
Stealing memes from r/shittyrainbowsix to post on the main sub... even though SRB was made because the main sub doesn’t allow memes (unless the mods find them funny because the mods don’t follow their own rules).
---
She looks like if Audrey from the Atlantis movies dressed up as Mira, but it still looks amazing. Good job OP!
---
they reduced the vault range
---
i never see him banned
---
Before the season was started I had a .58kd with her 😂 it's a weird glitch, my friend had a 1.6kd with her before season had started, think it's unfair I wanted a 1.6kd with her, seem like a good start!
---
That was ranked tho xd
---
Yes, consoles should be able to do that. And if you could use same account on all platforms it would help players who switch from console to pc etc.
---
Playing on PC and still taking bad quality Pics with a smartphone, 200 IQ
---
Lmao, this is why everyone bans echo. Someone that really knows how to use echo completely fucks with the whole team haha
---
I don't think they will, I'm pretty sure one of the developers have said they have no plans on reworking house
---
Uh... no? All they have to do is ban some ops and maps from the game’s pool of each.. not download a whole other game.
---
im kinda out of the loop on this one- whats so special about this?
---
As far as i know plat 3 can play with players up to diamond, ignoring the 1000 MMR Lock.
---
Some maps got reworked over the years or just had minor changes, operatirs stats changed too, grafucs where different, engine, breaching and a whole lot more, ubisoft can't just twitch some numbers for stats or anything because otherwise they would have changed op ops in the past within no time
---
hopefully soon
---
He never said original design tho. Just maps and ops
---
Or you could've just made this story up and add a funny killcam pic
---
&gt; I was curious because unranked mode is ranked without the losing of mmr and rank
---
So not ranked then, unranked in fact some may say.
---
I have been too much siege that I forgot the real name of "Frost trap"...
---
ngl, recoil control is fucking lit
---
I can only imagine. Getting spawn peaked by a Smoke with a suppressed Acog SMG-11
---
It was just a question, a simple no would have sufficed. Even just leaving it after i said okay, i was just curious seeing as unranked mode was very newly added to the game
---
Exactly.
---
I volunteer my gf for this role
---
No
---
I also play jager but its like no one uses granades
---
Okay, was just curious
---
Bartlett is literally the worst map in R6. Ubi told the community it was bad and it shouldn't be added but the community complained about it so they added it. Community sees the map is awful. Ubi removes it from multiplayer. Community now "We haven't learned our lesson give us back the worst map. Ubi why you do this." It's the only map out of roation for very good reason.
---

---
It will only down, not kill in 3 hits. On longer ranges, not even that. And with the fire rate that slow, you will be at a disadvantage in most fights. 
---
They would have to nerf Pulse in other ways then, but there needs to be something done about Castle, his win and pick rates are terrible.
---
&gt; It was just a question, a simple no would have sufficed.
---
As would two seconds worth of thought.
---
The map is horrid. It's now made for PvP at all.
---
im plat
---
It's not.
---
Same
---
Hottest mix tap of 2019 boutta drop for these guys
---
Well this weapon was meant to be used on long ranges, where you won't be going for interrogates. At close ranges her pistol will always be the best anyway.
---
Yeah thats probably why. People are moving out of the comfort ban zone in that range I'd assume.
---
 i was just asking a question okay. Unranked was very added in so i was curious. Did i think it would work? Not really but i wanted to ask. I really dont care since even if i do complete the challenge it wont do anything for me in the end
---
Thanks for the laugh, my dude
---
When you play Milsim but just want to go home
---
alot of thatcher bans over here haha
---
&gt; i was just asking a question okay.
---
One you knew the answer to
---
Nokk should be higher than Vigil at least. I'd put Blitz on that list. Mastering Blitz is a hard and daunting task honestly. As someone who put more than 2 days into him on Xbox I can tell you that's a fact
---
Quarantine has been taken by ubi already. So they can't be working on the same title.
---
Now names can't be registered, only logos can. Ubi has registered the "6" logo but not R6, so this could be something completely different but with a similar short form.
---
The first one would be OP and impossible to do. You can’t have 2 live feeds at the same time.
---
The second one seems ok but 10 seconds is too long, and the thingy to listen to defenders com need to be taken out. It would be useless against squad because most of them use external coms and useless in solo queue if they don’t communicate or op if they do.
---
Maybe nice shot? Lol. 
---
Btw nice shot!
---
Can you post an uncropped version?
---
True. The worst mistake you can make a solo qer is do placement matches early. Matchmaking is especially garbage when everyone has no rank
---
Those metal stairs cost me a Warden ace that would’ve been like 10 seconds long max. Caught everyone going down the stairs all at once... those bars saved Amaru’s head and she got a lucky peek
---
Do you believe you can do this with other ops too? I'm intrigued, but my aim is not that good to have Kali as my wallpaper hahahaha
---
No, it's a fun casual map. It's not supposed to be balanced
---
Thank you for your service
---
yes i agree we should revert hipfire to what it was before so this wouldnt happen
---
So your first shot registered, hence the blood splatter but 2nd, 3rd and 4th are CLEARLY on his bagpack. Bagpacks aren't part of the hitbox.
---
If only. I remember back in console days I got vote kicked for picking twitch.
---
you're not alone friendo.
---
no
---
Press f for fallen soldier
---
You think that the "new season showcase" would have ended yesterday and tbh i wish i could see my clash with out having to go though the menu
---
F
---
I like it when they take out bad maps: tower house plane favela but I don’t like it when they take out good maps like Oregon.
---
Why would a company name a game identical to an already established? There are a lot of 2 letter/number combos
---
God I thought this was a real car and I was like "damn, you must like Nøkk **a lot** to spend (at least) 700€ on a custom decal"
---
yep, it replaced the doge charm on my fake black ice F2
---
exactly my thoughts. hopefully this is the last day of this
---
I personally really like what they did this year.
---
Outback is fantastic (my opinion).
---
Kafe was subtle, but still made me love the map even more.
---
Kanal was a HUGE overhaul, and it felt completely new, but also felt familiar. Really comfortable to play because I already know most of it, but it got improved greatly and got a face-lift.
---
I still am getting lost on the 'other side' of Themepark. The Drug lab, daycare area is perfectly fine and untouched, but I need to get familiar with the other side of the map. I personally right now am not really a huge fan, but I haven't memorised the reworked map, and I haven;t played enough.
---
Yeah but ya never know it being ubisoft
---
Pretty sure that’s mad old
---
Why is capitao so hard to play ??
---
Damn! Thought I struck gold haha it looks so fucking cool tho!
---
This was like 7 shots, whenever the scope shakes, thats a shot. At least 3 was on his body by that time.
---
I had mozzie too with the pro league skin and elite sledge. It was cool at first but not anymore
---
Well, if it's early in the season, you should play for the win. Your teammates may actually care about rank. But if it's second or third month of the season I just play for fun
---
Plat 3 is the shittiest rank of them all.  I would rather be in literally any other. Going down u can play thunt but in ranked. Going up u can enjoy serious strats and serious play overall. Coming from hard stuck 3500/3700mmr player ufff. But Good for u buddy I guess.
---
Trust no one... not even yourself
---
How is it their fault? Your teammates where toxic, you "TK" twice so you got kicked.
---
I'm too poor to buy the pro league sets xd
---
this has been a thing for a while
---
with the vaulting animation kinda fucking up hitboxes they move around allot when people jump through shit the same happens when people repel and go upsidedown and shit
---
Maybe they wanted to keep it secret for some reason OR this is not a rainbow six game
---
Positive Feedback only
---
What but why about hugh
---
Who is this Matt that everybody is greeting?
---
Mat is a lad.
---
Dont forget about dragin
---
Get rid of it then add the ability to put two acogs on the bosg
---
lmao
---
the hipfire literally shot upwards
---
His name is Myatt, thank you very much.
---
why you hate?
---
Exactly, and it would be really hard to satisfy everyone so thats probably why they're not changing it i guess
---
Not for pros
---
They're definitely on my list as well.
---
Skyscraper, Chalet, Bartlett, Yacht, Favela, Fortress, Hereford.
---
Maybe 5 HP per second or 2 seconds because other wise it would take 24-40 seconds for just 40 HP would be too much. Another fix would be an initial amount of HP  and then constant HP gained per couple of second after that. This will also make stims be wasted more as it encourages the use of multiple stims to get a ×2 multiplier, 5 hp per 2 second become 10 hp per 2 second for the duration of the first stim (16 seconds to 10 for the same 40 hp (accounting reload)  plus extra 40 hp at normal 5hp per 2 seconds range). Very complicated but basically same thing as you said but when you stim ×2 at the same time it increases the rate of hp for the duration of the first stim.
---
Tl;dr: 5hp per two seconds is better and stims overlap for faster heal.
---
I'm pretty sure LGBTQ (or at least LGB) people have always existed, the ancient Romans were gay as fuck lmao. Also just adding a LGBTQ character isn't bandwagoning as long as it makes sense.
---
&gt;I’m not against LGBTQ, but there is no real advantage to creating such a character in this specific game, that’s all.
---
There's also no disadvantage, every character already has lore so making a character gay wouldn't really change anything. And the fact that people have a character which they can identify themselves with could be seen as an advantage.
---
*SMACK!*

I can only watch this and imagine Darude sandstorm at the same time otherwise my brain will fry
---
LGBT didn't exist in "old times"???
---
Counterexample: A mate got voted the other day but the guy didn't recognize that we were a stack of 4 - so we vote kicked him in response and won the game :\]
---
Ubisoft said that they have no plans to rework it because then it wouldnt be a house anymore, and its their lovely little broken map
---
might not place my god damn ads, idk
---
While moving
---
If you want to play SoloQ, go ahead. Just keep in mind that you are possibly going to matchmaker with 4 other assholes and your teammates may not be as good as their ranks.
---
Uhh, dont die
---
*Sigh Who’s uri Candice suga ligmadragin and Jenna?
---
I played 2 solo his games. First one I went 11-4 and the second one I went 13-5. I lost both games. Yes it’s that bad
---
If you mastered recruit, Tachanka is a very good replacement.
---
That would be sick for a final killcam
---
Also for DBNO revives doc revives himself with the initial instant 20hp you regularly get for a normal revive plus the 40hp at the 5hp per 2 seconds I stated before.
---
Siege has a weird system were the pings are tied to the ingame mic e.g. when you mute someone ingame it mutes their pings too. That explains the pings. For why the voice is fucked, my best guess is a big in sieges core which comes up every now and then but doesn't affect too many players.
---
New skin confirmed?
---
That's fine. You now have managed to keep your son away from the computer for 30 minutes successfully! Good on you!
---
This isn’t a buff
---
Yea didn't make sense to showcase the ops if we already have the season pass. Please Ubi. Do the thing we ask of you.
---
Thanks! It does help. I'm on PS4 and I've never really messed around with any of the sensitivity stuff, maybe it's time to take a look. Thanks again for the pep talk!
---
That 90 degree grip.
---
It’s a request for ubi
---
HA
---
Christ, dude.
---
Nice! :)
---
He was joking.
---
As for Kali, so far, fun, but niche, and VERY unforgiving if you miss your shot in CQB.
---
Gadget is good but still not as useful as Thatcher to assist in breaching.
---
Damn it took you less than a day to model and render this?
---
A Friend is playing like you at 30fps he managed to hit platine 3 you just need a lot of skill and gamesense to compensate
---
Ela lookin fine af
---
That one has been a while, I usually get sound glitch after that one where all sound come through 1 ear and have to restart game.
---
Hopefully they realised it was a shit idea and stopped making it.
---
Which is unreasonably unbalanced and unrealistic. A clear LOS should reward the person who shoots first, and no flimsy metal bar is going to be stopping 9mm NATO.
---
I’d take low damage and speed reduction over higher chip damage
---
Swear I thought this said virgin keychain.
---
idk
---
Isn’t there a chain for pretty much every op?
---
Perhaps make it so they only have their marker when he has direct line of sight? That will keep him from accidentally trapping the same spot twice, while making him have to rely purely on audio cues in other rooms.

I had 5000 once
---
Ok that is one example, but if you made a graph, with different pings, would the guy with lower ping have the advantage in all situations? So for example 200 ping vs 40 ping? Same reaction times?
---
You should switch from AOL dial up to Juno. It's much faster.
---
WRONG WARMUP
---
Holy shit that team is intel personified what the actual fuck
---
Fuze what is a hostage?
---
Ye
---
But it doesn't fucking need it.
---
Speed reduction is a massive debuff to just toss out. With an *entire team* of 3 speeds, Lesion with this buff, and it is, objectively, a buff, could lower the entire team by at least 1 speed stat, and put 2 of them at 1. So instead of a heavy rush, they plod in at Fuze speed and get fucking destroyed because their gadgets are weaker to compensate for their speed.
---
This is the stupid shit that gets an op a 100% ban rate.

---
Oooh nice black ice
---
&gt;Are you saying Castle's gadget is op? 
---
No I didn't say castle's was op. I said it was influential, but has a high skill cap.
---
&gt;All it takes is one attacker's secondary gadget (3 breech charges), to make Castle's gadget pretty much useless.
---
Congratulations. You just made that attacker waste that utility in blowing up a beefed up barricade. That's one less utility, and less time for attack. Sounds like castle did his job just fine, and that was just one of his 3 'cades. And attackers expose their legs when placing charges, so they have to waste ranged utility or nades in doing that. Imagine if an op doesn't have any of those? Has to manually walk up and waste some 10-12 seconds breaking it by punching it 11 times. Glaz wastes 12 bullets. So much wastage.  
---
&gt;He's so situational and only works on certain spots.
---
There's minimum of 1 site per map where you can make use of his gadget very well if you coordinate with your team. Just watch Pl. He's a genuine monster in the hands of a coordinated team.
---
Watch the Astro stairs hold on villa by castle in PL. Barricade the astro-bathroom door, open the closet wall, and now you have an uncontested angle into whoever vaults into closet. One gu mine below or a barbed wire at the base and castle can't be challenged at all. In fact, you can even have a doc or rook or anybody else watch that and castle can anchor in site. A passive gadget that forces rerouting or wastage of utility, like here where you HAVE to waste launcher charges or breach charges or nades to open it. That's utility and time wasted. A job well done.
---
Castle is often considered Mira's best friend, like consulate top floor connector windows. There's also clubhouse gym site where he's amazing. You'll find at least one site per map where he's influential. That's good enough in my books. Just that he needs a team.
---
&gt;I somewhat agree witoh your statemet about Pulse, but that means he needs different kind of approach to balancing.
---
Doesn't mean he's in need of a buff. If it ain't broke, don't fix. Pulse is balanced. And be happy a wall hack op is balanced. You don't get that often.
---
Well, welcome.

I know my luck the dude would hip fire once and it would be a headshot

I just want to leans with out having to ads on xbox

Yeah, no. Not buying that story. They found evidence of third party software being used. They won't just bam you out of no where. Otherwise I would be permanently banned on most consoles with how often I've been reported/accused of hacking.

Then stop playing with hackers. As someone that commented on my comment, you must be associated with a hacker/cheater. And being in one or 2 lobbies randomly won't get you banned. You would have to literally be joining them constantly.

If your gonna play ranked at all, dont focus on your rank, just playing and getting better. As you get better, your rank will follow

what does it do exactly?

No Ela?

Rainbow 6 siege discord server is a good place to get started. Other player finding apps like Moot work well. Also just try to find teammate in the wild. Me and my friends add prior teammates to our squad and play another rank with them, if there good we keep em. (I suggest that if you have a 4 or 5 stack). Always have at least 3 guys that are usually on and reliable. Don't team up with players if they are terribly worse than you and you have to carry. Also try to stay away from toxic ppl even if they are good. Only play rank if you have atleast 3 ppl in ur squad. That's all i got, my friend is the one who usually finds the ppl who we play with so im not to knowledgeable on how to find ppl.
---
Yea god forbid I have another account I wanna be ranked on
---
LOL
---
So Kapkan fucked Frost, huh?
---
those of you that are salty about me having a smurf can fuck off, I want to be ranked on two different accounts that's not a bad thing, fuck yall bitch ass niggas.
---
Thank you! I think Warden was best in this situation, as I was able to catch the Recruit before he could rush out of the door. If I hadn't gotten the Recruit then I'm sure he would've killed me while I was defusing.
---
They don’t do that here email Ubisoft
---
Idk where this is coming from, but it seems like Mira is getting played on a shit ton of sites since since Shifting Tides dropped, and she absolutely is NOT a must on most of them. In fact, Mira is a terrible op to choose in quite a few sites.
---
For the love of God, do not play Mira if you don't know when she should be picked or where to place her gadget, I have been getting absolutely fucked by teammates putting miras in places they shouldn't have put them, and then having the enemy use them once they've claimed a room near a site. It's so goddamn frustrating and it just started happening out of nowhere the last week or so.
---
I did they won’t really say anything other than “ban will not be lifted and no refund.” I’m flabbergasted because I have never been racist or anything in games.

What’s so funny

Gosh!

---
You were toxic, you got banned. Simple.
---
I know right? I was surprised when I first glanced at it
---
Neat!
---
I wasn’t though. Do they normally ban permanently for first offence?

Its interesting how much shit we find just by jumping around like idiots. Cool find, though. :)
---
By the lord
---
Looks like every other legendary
---
Cool
---
Zero
---
He was not. He said his friends sabotaged him.
---
That said, ubisoft has no way to prove that to undo your ban. Unless all of your friends come forward and admit and ubisoft tracked down all the reports to just those usernames.
---
Read the full comment. It's a manual ban triggered by enough reports or enough automatically flagged messages.
---
Uummmm...ok
---
Start with an ads of 83 to give you basically 1:1 hipfire and ads and then do terrorist hunts and raise or lower your hipfire sens till you are comfortable. You can then raise or lower your ads after you have dialed in your hipfire sens.
---
A child.

**No.**

Remove Outback, too, and make it 4.
---
Enough reports, exactly. That’s all my friends
---
What about that Ela elite though? The trailer was leaked yesterday.
---
Yah it’s really awful
---
Its manual. They only ban with enough evidence. You clearly did or said something bad enough to be banned.
---
It is kinda of funny how 90% of content creators content is them just fucking around doing dumb shit then the next day they complain about how solo queue sucks because they get stuck with people who fuck around and do dumb shit.
---
C'est la vie.
---
Yall really trolling my boy Mozzie like this? Smh... 😂
---
They never provided me with any evidence of anything.
---
haha gridlock fat haha upvotes to the left
---
Dunno. Yesterday, official Ubi NA channel dropped the Ela Elite trailer and then removed it 5 mins later. I was searching for the Ela Elite Trailer on YouTube and found this clip so i shared the link here. That video also got removed yesterday.
---
Theres a wall you can breach
---
This is too sweet.
---
They dont need to. It would be against data protection laws, and it would make ban circumventing easier, as people would know what triggered the review.
---
Yes
---
Imagine his friends sabotaged and spam the report button, and the account got banned.
---
That’s got to be some sort of breach; not knowing what you did and just getting banned. That’s so fucked; they could have just banned me for the sake of it
---
That took a long time on a post that is so old
---
Just a quick fyi, its "peeker" , and "peek" instead of "peak" :)
---
BB will help with the peeking, but if you get used to him, you'll make some bad habits as I said, and will perform worse on operators without the shield.
---
My advice is you gotta work on peeking with normal ops, and then bb will be even more effective.
---
What do you expect? It’s copper.
---
Did you read what i said, there's a chance you can banned for repeatedly insulting people not just homophobia or racism. Just being generally toxic in chat is probably a good way to get banned even without slurs.
---
Solo que into gold 1, it’s not too bad
---
How do you create a custom game with an ammo box and unlimited time? I don’t see these options.
---
Excuse me, what is that question??
---
You have to set it to bomb or hostage and kill all the terrorists without doing their objective ie: taking the hostage, planting defused
---
10 minutes and still no causal game !
---
\&gt; Complains that the servers are down during the "exact hour and a half of free time"
---
\&gt; Argues with a stranger during precious free time even though the servers are up
---
Oh shit. Thanks man
---
Restart the queue after 2 min. If there just arent enough players on, then nothing can be done except switching servers.
---
Nah I still get plenty of eu servers on bf1. It’s just a matter of tinkering with the settings.
---
They're removing the discovery playlist
---
I've been gold the last few seasons but this was one of my placement matches.
---
I, Giorno Giovanna, have a ketamine addiction
---
Why tf is the game still deranking me when im litterally deleting everyone
---
looks like the crouchwalk animation is overextending your hitbox without your perspective actually seeing it, the rest is just her having an acog
---
Ok?
---
Because you lose games. Kd doesn’t make you go up, W/L does.
---
I ain't from up north.
---
Then I’m confused how you got matched up with that thatcher
---
I was wondering when I would see an organic clip of a lineup killshot like this
---
Shame.
---
Next year it seems. :(
---
It's not really your 5th day playing siege if you've played on console before though is it? No one who's been actually playing for literally 5 days would even think to look at that window from there. Title is just a little misleading.
---
Placements. Probably with another person in their placements who wasn't a high a rank as I've been.
---
On top of everything else i have said. Ubisoft will have the right to ban anyone from the game as they see fit.
---
Oh I thought she hit you with the last bullet. Lucky as hell yeah, but you'd probably have died anyway.
---
Its most commonly seen as a vine, but it first came from a Youtuber Brandon Rogers. Its from his very short lived show Neighborhood Patrol.
---
Do you have one for valk or mute
---
Vigil requires some map knowledge. If you have it, then I would consider him, but Mira is one of those round saving ops in my opinion unlike Vigil.
---
#I'M FUMING

Lion rework looks sick
---
Casual Clip + Spray 100 bullets at a kid not moving = best console player
---
If you think that's bad Oregon has a piece of 2mm sheetmetal at the top of the tower that works better than Rook's armor plates.
---
Dang, this is amazing!
---
What, why isn't Homer Lesion? He has dad shorts.
---
They just accidentally released her trailer though, was really hoping it’d be soon if they already have that done.
---
I loose alot of gun fights on stairways I should have eon because of bars
---
Then he needs a serious rework cause I tk jackals
---
Nearly always cheaper to build. I bought a prebuilt because I found a deal on refurbished but honestly I wouldn’t do it again
---
Nah maestro is fine as he his. Hes one of the strongest anchors in the game
---
MP7 Acog and she will easily be one of the top picked attackers in the game
---
And all I said is that I aspire to be the best, not that I am the best. You literally just started talking down and being negative for absolutely no reason.
---
Yeah the flash hider doesn't do that nor has it ever done that
---
I agree with you but he's alright
---
My problem is that he encourages holding a single situational angle a lot that only works in casual. I used to play like that and it would never win me matches so I had to unlearn it. Would be cool if he actually showed it working multiple times and not as a clutch strat. Yeah, my "nitro cell through floorboards with deagle" trick is pretty cool but I would never recommend sitting below all the time
---
K/D doesn't equal rank.  You can be a great fragger without being able to play obj, or be a team player.
---
Got ya. Will be sure to just stare them down instead of trying to win the match. Check.
---
You are literal trash, even if you are decent at the game. Be proactive not a toxic piece of shit. Stop commenting please, this is going no where.
---
Just my opinion tho
---
Nah
---
Marley would quick scope him. You had to aim.
---
Practice aiming. A headshot almost always kills except for some crazy scenarios (or one particular Operator), so getting good at aiming and knowing where to place the crosshair is important.
---
Mobility is your best defense, because of the above. If you're stationary and your position is known, you're likely to get prefired. 
---
Intel is important, so on Attack at least, look after your drone. Get used to using it to guide yourself or a teammate in. 
---
Play the Objective. Defense wins on time if the clock runs out, unless Attack plants or is securing the site. There are times to try and wipe the enemy team (not enough time to plant, for instance), but general rule of thumb is force the enemy team to have to win.
---
Don't reinforce Kids Bedroom. Or to be more general with this; Be wary of how you reinforce and set up site on Defense. Attack can traverse the map better than Defense, and they have access to ways that let them punch through reinforcements. 
---
Ash and Sledge are simple Attackers, so your main responsibility is to just get kills or at most destroy an important Defender gadget. They both do what's called soft destruction, so anything not reinforced they can breach. For Defense, Rook'll let you get used to being an Anchor (Defender that looks after the objective, the last line of defense basically), just plop the Armour he has down and go about your business. Jager'll let you get used to Roaming (Defender that takes the fight to Attackers. They're just looking to kill time, and may Attackers). His gadget's a bit more complicated than Rook, but it's just place your Magpies in places you want to protect from grenades. If you're just after one for either side, go Sledge and Rook. 
---
I have a whole list of more tips, but no need to give you a massive wall of text.

Sorry bout that fella

Secret R6 relationship?

Uhhhh according to you, what is the animal spirit of each agent?

It's the gas and maintenance that is a dealbreaker

Oke.

Nice

That's no bueno My guy. Thats why were talking about good reworks. So many would complain and call Ubi lazy if they were to just throw him away.
---
Recruit
---
Haha watch some YouTube tutorials, I haven’t built one either but it’s literally like 8 pieces that snap together
---
Or a Darkest Dungeon comic.
---
Oh niiice. Might have to get one in the future, thanks my guy
---
Good point thats what I do. Everybody hates jackal but he has a negative win rate. I guess everyone forgets.
---
Fair enough
---
it’s not unique. I’ve seen this plenty of times before
---
Great flick, but man is that defender an absolute idiot for sprinting out into the open like that
---
Yo this is Pog tho
---
I love playing against jackal because when i am roaming it makes it easier for me to hunt people down
---
On bomb not sure on that tho
---
Still cheating in casual &amp; still ruins the game for others in casual. No excuses.
---
IQ is balanced though
---
needs moar jpeg
---
If the game lets you, you should put  'Nøkk' in a nice gold on a windshield strip
---
Dokk
---
I hope you deploy a server in **Southern** or **Eastern Europe**.. We wish you success ! :)
---
Tbh I love playing jackal for the kit and to see if anybody has been near me.
---
Only 33 rounds in my drum mag, better reload
---
I only have 1 legendary and 1 black ice after playing from grim sky to now :(
---
Those are all around my school it’s hard to act normal with the instincts of a rainbow player
---
Are you on console or pc? Im on console. Only reason i can control buck pretty well is cause he has been my main for over a year.
---
Cleanprincegaming, is the biggest fo intalectual dick head, on gaming youtube. I would never want to be considered anything like him. That tells me a bit about you if you thinks hes smart. Sigie recently hasnt been giving me great joy as of recent and has actually made me regret putting as much time into the game as it has became clearer the the only real fun content sigie is getting is cosmetics. All the new oparators past the Australian ones have been incredibly boring and dry. Kafe rework is just as boring as old kafe. Its the same dry shit again this update. I couldnt care if you liked the game or not., I just dont like people defending greed.
---
This game sucks but I can’t stop playing it please help.
---
If there’s like one way(like doorway) they can get back in time, smoke that instead but smoking urself isn’t too bad an idea.
---
Mute is a brainiac and smoke is playing what’s in the canister

FMG buff or just different weapon? Are you thinking another smg or an assault rifle?

I would imagine next week since they are sting it’s the last chance to get the current ones.

Another proof that this game is broken
---
Hard drugs
---
pussy moderators
---
That is so weird because I get the scan bug too where it scans someone but doesn't reveal who they are
---
Yeah this is what i think is the only explanation. I saw a video on yt where something like that was showed, like a very little movement animation while standing completely still.
---
i counted 4
---
And I was so good at it that it got me a promotion
---
The way you draw men could turn me gay, jesus

Garbage comment, could you have a less important comment? Downvoted (it’s the standard angle with a 90 FOV your phone or whatever you’re watching on is probably just fucked up)
---
True
---
You know that you could have recorded that on x box and not on the phone right?
---
How’s the weather down here it’s still warm
---
How many of ya guys are out there ? You started to become an horror to me
---
You actually look like her, like this is easily the best cosplay from siege
---
The new map is significantly better then the original. It’s not as dark, the map flows better and I feel once people get used to it attackers will have a better chance at winning then in the previous map.
---
That’s why I said “5th day playing siege on PC”
---
Maybe it's just me, but in my opinion Smoke would've been a better Bart because their "story" is kinda similar
---
Hmm you can hide the claymore behind a Monte and bait some enemy to go up the stairs and the monte moves over at the appropriate moment.
---
Yeah, it worked now.
---
The feature glat out didn't work lol, that was it.

I am sad that the Rook didn't put the armour on a table instead of the filthy, bug infested ground.

I think I like to roam in defence, but not a defined style on attack
---
Anything higher than 900 fire rate benefits greatly from the compensator. F2, Mp7, Mx4, Skorp, etc.
---
Ok buddy
---
A repost
---
when you kill more teammates than actual enemies.
---
I think what they mean is that the LGBT community it strongly over represented. There also is apparently a difference in those relationships according to colleagues and stuff ifyou can fill out that your gay on a college application and have a higher change of getting in because of diversity score
---
Bro your having a argument with a dumb ass 15 year old over a meme
---
&gt; You literally seem to be making the argument as if I exclusively play Cav
---
The way you talk about Mira screams Cav main that is far off site that doesn't rotate back. If you are actually doing a roamers job of wasting time, holding on to map control, and rotating back when needed they are very rarely ever a detriment. If a team has that much site control that they can play the Mira windows then there was a massive fuckup and you weren't going to win regardless of those windows being there. 
---
&gt; she has zero utility is objectively wrong. She is the most powerful Intel op in the game, that's not even possible to argue
---
If any of this was remotely true her pick rate in PL wouldn't be similar to Tachanka's. You don't even need to look at that either as the most recent Ember Rise Win Delta chart shows her right next to him in the underpowered/too weak category among Plat's and Diamonds. She loses majority of her value once you make it around mid-gold. She is incredibly easy to just trade off even if she gets the down.
---
The most powerful intel op in the game is Mira lol. I'd also much rather have an Echo, Maestro, Pulse, Valk, or Lesion when it comes to intel gathering than Cav. 
---
&gt;  But she is also very not useful in a lot of sites
---
I could seriously walk you through every damn ranked site in the game if you need me to and reiterate why this is wrong
---
&gt; because it's literally a different game than anyone in this sub plays
---
Far from it. At its most basic level the same stuff matters. Your average player obviously isn't going to come near it strategy wise, but the essential principles apply if you want to be successful in game. What areas of the map are important, what areas need to be cleared, which flanks to hold, which walls/hatches/vertical lines of sight need to be opened, etc. For example just because the team someone is playing in Silver on Border doesn't know they need to clear upstairs before attack Vents/Workshop doesn't mean you shouldn't play up there. When I first moved to PC my usual group got by on a lot of that sort of thing while our gun skill and movement wasn't nearly as good as most teams we were playing.

r/shittyrainbow6
---
In what Store?
---
Was this from the show or edited?
---
obviously it does. recoil diamond doesn't refer to hipfire. it's the way siege calculates recoil, which is semi-random.
---
each shot has predetermined recoil and a random aspect. that randomness is the diamond. it's called that because the total amount of random recoil is fixed, so more horizontal equals less vertical and vice versa, giving the possible outcomes an upside down diamond shape.
---
Just a side note your flair doesn’t work I only see cav, clash, recruit, doc, and buck
