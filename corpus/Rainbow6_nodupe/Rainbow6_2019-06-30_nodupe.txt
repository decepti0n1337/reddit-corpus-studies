What was the name of the old seasonal skin with a tiger on it? 
---

---
That is my favourite
---
---
---
You spelt J√§ger wrong ;-;
---
Here on PC ive seen 2 suspected hackers that were maybe just good and 1 ddos. this shit really isnt that bad tbh, people are over exaggerating, Yes it FUCKING SUCKS to have a hacker in your game. but its just 1 game. and i would highly doubt it you play against a hacker every game. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Second of all. clash can fuck right off. that operator is frustrating to play against. I do miss deployable shields tho. 
---
and ubisoft is fixing the game right now, hence why they took out deployable shields and clash. you want to play against gamebreaking exploits? Oh no you dont, but you would complain about it regardless. The only thing i dont like about this season is that it doesnt have much. You got ugly seasonal skins. warden sucks ass, nokk is ok. no new weapons. No new map, although i admit the kafe rework is pretty good.
---
I‚Äôve done the same man, shits great.

This is so salty it made me thirsty

Please feel free to leave a review about the Plat 3 Doc Spawnpeek room online. If it wasn‚Äôt satisfactory try the Sweaty Ash Main room, where everything is speed up 50 times and you dont have a hitbox.
---
Or maybe the map is just ass from a designer standpoint. The defense clearly has the advantage.
---
Ash is there for you to serve all your thirsty needs .

Yeah its a ddos. you also have people giving you 0 fps and 100000000000 ping. Just dont think anything of it, send a ticket of their name. and youll get your shit back.
---
It would seem I'm being torn to shreds for an unpopular opinion, just miss the good ol days of tower x
---
Lol that was funny
---
Were you not referencing why echo doesn't get called?
---
And room doc kaid and gridlock
---
Not just ranked tho, has also happened to me on cas
---
Could not believe it, took me a second to realize what was going on.
---
Not nearly as effective since machine pistol super recoil nerf üò≠üòµüò™üòìüòøüòñüòñüôÉ
---
`whats in the canister`
---
Shhh it‚Äôs a secret.
---
While that is completely understandable, it reached the amount necessary to be in the Top of All Time 4th position with the amount of support it got. Just say it broke a rule or something and that's why you hid it, it makes me feel so much more embarrassed for you that you have to lie and say it just "vanished" from the hot page.
---
Marley, I didn‚Äôt know you used reddit
---
I was today years old when I learned of this
---
Are the charms the highest rank or current rank?
---
spilled wine on the wall too
---
Yeah I saw everyone posting their one taps and remembered this one
---
Welcome to wood IV
---
When it freezes do you have to restart to fix it? cause i had this problem about a year ago where i had a wireless headset and when ever i connected or dissconected my cable or any usb while playing i would have a freeze then i would have to close it through the task manager so maybe you got like a lax cable that connects and disconnects and causes the same issue for you.
---
Well glaz‚Äôs rifle i believe can do collaterals
---
That is definitely not a bottleneck. The i9 goes great with that GPU.
---
Am I the only only one who actually digs the skin?
---
Most people are saying legion so I guess I'm a legman main noe
---
El Goblino
---
Because if you do your obj becomes a death trap to your team. It becomes an enclosure.
---
For me the scary parts are when I'm on defense, and I hunker down in a corner, and just listen to the footsteps, especially with good headphones. Hearing stomping on the other side of the wall can be quite unnerving.
---
As someone who has pretty bad anxiety, I do so much worse when my teammates do that. It's counterproductive. If you want me to clutch the round, there's a much better chance I can pull it off if you shut the hell up and let me focus.
---
Well that‚Äôs a fucken lie
---
Just came here to let you know you are stupid
---
It‚Äôs the same on Xbox :(
---
the skins ok but i already have the guerrilla one which is imo better
---
Sad thing is it‚Äôs so true, not just on playstation but on Xbox too
---
That‚Äôs a DMR
---
He ate iq too
---
oh but do you also have a 420 in there?
---
I need to start infusing nutty YEETS into my one taps.
---
Once i was defending tea room on skyscraper, and i went in kitchen (to watch the window from below) and my team mate floor bang headshotted me whilst killing a drone
---
you're not welcome
---
'LavdaLassan' in hindi means garlic on your dick.
---
You also had a plat queued with a silver 4, almost the same
---
Holy shit, someone captured how I feel bandit plays like in the game, irl
---
Yeah know that's just because they're "mad cause bad" I just figured I'd give some insight as to other reasons as well
---
Wait what I thought PC got shields or was that on the TTS and I'm just totally incapable of seeing the massive watermark
---
No, stop, don‚Äôt
---
Too true
---
Hmmm
---
Would rather take a 15-30 minute penalty than play out a 45 minute game where I sit on the cameras bc I‚Äôm dead
---
Are you sayin Jim Halpert is the original 6
---
Echo elite
---
Thanks üòò
---
Talk about a hard rush, geez
---
Holy. Shit.
---
It‚Äôs called watching videos on your phone or doing something else
---
No he was the president that gave the go ahead to John to start team rainbow
---
If I have a friend can I do it with them? Or does it have to be 5 for maximum renown
---
So when you shot a character enough times with a gun. It eventually kills them. If that‚Äôs the last player on the team you lose üëçüèΩhope this helps
---
didn't u got ban?
---
*chuckles* I'm in danger
---
Yes lol the funny thing is this was casual. I just got on and was doing a warm up game and he got a bit chapped.
---
Small brains tend to hurt more when thoughts are produced so...
---
5 for max but instead of around 32 solo you may get 100 for 2
---
Oh na I play pc
---
Wait.... I don't get it
---
The psycho in the mask has it.
---
Then do the same thing during your penalty period. Still, there‚Äôs no sense in bringing down the whole team
---
Yeah I forgot to add that in there the plat was queued up with the silver it goes both ways it‚Äôs a joke they shouldn‚Äôt be able to queue together!
---
So quick math says that if u were playing on Mars ping would be 187000. Sounds playable to me
---
I got spawn peeked when I open the book...
---
agreed
---
So, go to where you select your flair ( mobile: 3 dots) (PC:sidebar) then click your flair and after that click on edit. Then it will bring up another screen to change what it is. So you can change it like the other dude to words or change it to more than one op. If more explaining pls comment
---
Thank you. Do you happen to know what maps are the best and how much it gives you for 5 people
---
In all honesty, I‚Äôve come across a lot more toxicity from casual than in ranked. I‚Äôve had way more nicer people in ranked; at least from my experience so far.
---
The penalty period would be wasted elo time
---
ela looks scary 
---
no offensive
---
If you haven‚Äôt done all the situations, you can get 600 from each
---
Shame on blue
---
Look for me and my squad this game is all about fun and not the competitive gameplay. Of course we love to try hard on some cheaters or boosters .
---
This is fucking sick. I love it
---
im not 100% sure but i think all maps give the same. House is probably the best becausr its so small and can be done quickly buy Kafe is good even though it is big it doesnt have any bombers
---
Wait so like delete the parentheses after typing it?
---
So is sitting in a 45 minute ranked game.. either way you look at it, he‚Äôs still sitting there for a long time and not getting anything, so why do the same for your teammates?
---
Nah the guy seemed pretty chill about it, after the round he called me lucky af
---
You only need 5 bullets per round...
---
But isnt that completely counterproductive?
---
If I pull my stick completely I want to make fast turns, if I move it slightly I want small adjustments. 
---
I play with 75/75 (didnt play since mid last season) and I dont want to move at full speed if I just want to move a few millimeters.
---
Maybe I understood it wrong but thats how your description sounds to me.
---
Everyone play game to win even in casual and some people think they are not good enough for rank yet so they try hard casual . Its not their wrong doing , its your mindset .
---
Haha funny Tachanka lord! Lol!
---
Oh boy its that Tachanka funny again! Original!!!
---
get beaned lol
---
Thanks! Been looking around for ages.
---
I have three stars on each except for the iq situation. That one's a pain in the ass
---
Lmao bad
---
Bro you‚Äôre dumb he‚Äôs getting a loss which he wants? The thing is you‚Äôre just mad that you don‚Äôt get it at all üòÇ when I throw it‚Äôs me doing the most damage or getting my teammates to kill me to get them kicked so I can de rank... whenever they kill me I laugh and I‚Äôm usually watching something on Netflix on my other monitor
---
Like a reverse airjab frost mat?
---
Alright. Thank you :)
---
Damn Number 1 huh? Im only like number 18 in the US.
---
Insta Reported Inappropriate content without the neeeded NSWF flair. Please be careful while showing us Lords pictures. Thank you.
---
Maybe take away 50 health instead of all of it?
---
Well they could add official m&amp;k support and try to get a deal with ubi for crossplay.
---
me and the boys not dying as a meme, ever.  
---
it will be the new drake meme format
---
No problem. Kinda fitting thatcher helped thermite lol
---
He punched a hole in it

I use valk just so I can watch in a corner while other people do my biding

Thanks

What?

You missed

In theory i could see that working but it automatically puts attackers at a disadvantage everytime

If it's spawn peeks you're worried about, spawn air con and take control of vine/geisha balcony? 
---
Also having friends with great eyes and better communication skills helps. 
---
But, tbh, if you're complaining about peeks and run outs, allow me to present my good friend Fortress^just don't bring up his ex-wife
---
Ha
---
Not only is this 2 months old but you completely misread everything in the comments thread...
---
dont ask me bud
---
Don't use the scorpion, it's the worst gun in game statistically. And yes I main Ela.
---
i hate myself for both upvoting this comment and laughing at it.
---
I noticed the commando was a melt machine. I just recently actually got MOZZIE (was on a six month internetless hiatus). I tried using the Peashooter and I wasn‚Äôt impressed by it. 
---
I believe it‚Äôs the same RPM/DPS of the Russian defense SMG which is great because that means the lord has a useable weapon.
---
This is so true, I fuck around in casual from time to time and if I go 0-4 cuz I was crawling around the map like a snake, the other team usually sends me a message ‚Äútrash diamond‚Äù ‚Äúcarried diamond‚Äù. God forbid a diamond just wants to fuck around for a bit üòÇ
---
If you'd seen what doc has seen you'd drink too much too!
---
finka
---
people make mistakes???
---
[removed]
---
Yeah. Roni is good for 5k ace headshot trains. Commando is more versatile. Both are good suppressed
---
can someone confirm or bust this?
---
Either missed or server lag but missing seems the most reasonable
---
Something similar was happening to me. I was finka and every bullet in her primary gun missed, even at point blank.
---
This x1000
---
Casual is way more toxic than ranked 
---
I know
---
It‚Äôs crazy to believe as a new player but just trust us on this. It ain‚Äôt like over watch where everyone and their mother is playing dirty.
---
This made my day üòÇüòÇ
---
*tries hiding my flair* ..... In my Defense....
---
In the case, I feel like the Gold on their team should receive the lower MMR that the Plats would get if that team won. Either that, or Ubi sets up a system a la mode de Overwatch where there's a hard SR range lock for ranked queuing
---
Didn't notice this. It's beautiful.
---
Feel free to add me, my buddy is bout to get plat 2 and I‚Äôm diamond. Currently trying to get diamond on my alt. DyslexicPanda13
---
Peekin's a good job mate
---
It's challengin' work, in-doors
---
I guarantee you won't go hungry
---
Cuz at the end of the day, long as there's two people left on the planet
---
Someone's gunna get spawnpeeked
---
Only a hard breach?
---
Yeah that recruit looks expensive as hell
---
I disagree
---
If you reinforce kids room you‚Äôll always win 100% of the time 0% of the time.
---
Very jealous about that Black Ice on my boy Thatchers L8
---
this is a 1 in 100 play i promise
---
Yeah sprinkler and not really woosh because there‚Äôs sprinklers in siege too
---
link a mod or something theyll probably know
---
Play ranked
---
thats why it was a warm up game.
---
I always wondered what that little closet space was for. (Other than an entrance and *outrance*)
---
1) I don‚Äôt play smoke that often
---
2) I‚Äôm not good with him at all
---
3) I‚Äôm not interested in buying any of the other elite skins in the game
---
BUT! I would buy this skin in a heartbeat it is that good.
---
Sniff sniff smells like stolen content
---
assassin's creed id the other ubisoft game
---
Found the bronze
---
Did not know that site existed! I'm rank 676 in the US for Xbox but I don't play on Xbox anymore but that's amazing!
---
What the F U C K
---
I always wondered why that room existed
---
And i suppose in the diamond rank you are you dont get annoyed at spawnpeeking
---
Any of the weapons skins from the Elite Skins that give that wooden furniture look to the weapons. That's the Call of Duty Big Red One in me showing.
---
Thank you! No one is perfect!
---
Are you commenting to yourself or forgot to make a thread to another comment
---
My friend moved his Windows installation and files from the SSD and his issues with crashes went away. Can't say that's the cause, but in his case, separating them worked
---
Thats a pretty nice first ranked ace tho!
---
Almost heaven, west Virginia
---
idk
---
What region?
---
Savage
---
It would be a stagnant hologram that you can see through walls and only appears as a copy of whatever you scan once per scan. If you tag someone: a holo appears: and they move it wont track them unless you update it by tagging the environment again
---
People who understand tactics wgats the benefit of going through that wall over going in the win do across from it
---
It? His name is Dave. 
---
He went to Yale!
---
No. No. Simple minds do not understand. What we need is a tachanka  turret with an acog  in front of an acog for 4x zoom and add 200 extra 50 cal. Rounds to insure the bullies go though gridlock nah never mind we would need a tank  or a ballistic missile for that
---
Or maybe you're too jaded to admit that good content can come from Ifunny. This vague sense of superiority is a bad look my guy.
---
Damn, shouldn‚Äôt of told anyone, i would go to the other side of the wall, punch a hole in it, and watch stairs from there, always worked cause no one knows about that spot
---
Echo buff incoming
---
Can roll around in a chair whilst on drones
---
You gotta sonic blast your friends whenever they visit and have them spawn peek.
---
Children and Man Children.
---
What does the drone view look like?
---
I hope this sauce smells and tastes like Valkyrie's feet ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Git gud
---
**It‚Äôll sting a lot**
---
As cav I will sometimes hide around there and when people come through the stairwell I shotty them.
---
The *only* defense is camping in their with Semi shotty's/AA-12's
---
That doesn't make any sense. If you're at the correct rank, you should be playing against players of relatively equal skill. If you're getting your ass kicked in ranked, your elo will decrease, and you'll play against worse opponents.
---
I mean it‚Äôs just from my view they are stupid or pretending to be when I look at their gameplay and don‚Äôt turn around when their is an enemy
---
To flex on attackers
---
AA-12 can take a seat 
---
It‚Äôs garbage 
---
Even at making giant holes.
---
Waiting for Clash
---
It's fun to meme with tho.
---
Might not do a whole lot of damage but it's still 32 rounds of "get the fuck out of my way."
---
And in ranked that won't happen. Casual ignores ranked MMR, why do you expect that there won't be diamonds and coppers in the same casual game?
---
Bro I‚Äôm on iFunny too you mongrel, CyanideAndHappinessJunkie 
---
Already got a feature 
---
Literally nothing good is on iFunny it‚Äôs all reposted content 
---
This image originally came from Reddit about two months ago
---
Console players:....‚Äùmy pain never ends‚Äù
---
Theres nothing wrong with skyscraper, git gud
---
99% of the effort is the hair lol. The rest was probably just found in a bin somewhere. $10 maximum.
---
32 rounds of hey look at me being a psychopath so my teammate can get an angle on you.
---
Idk, being able to deny a smoke plant is very powerful. One of the reasons Maestro is so good as well, Warden's just functions differently. He doesn't need to be good in every situation to be a good operator.
---
are you talking to me?
---
Don‚Äôt barricade your teammates inside objective, it gets annoying. 
---
Siege is a game completely based around patience and using everything around you to your advantage. It‚Äôs not like cod where you just go around and try to kill anyone you see. Sometimes you have to wait. You may see some people totally pro it out in casual and run around like they know everything. Don‚Äôt do that. 
---
Just take your time to learn everything because it‚Äôs a lot to take in. Definitely hard to learn, but incredibly fun once you get the hang of it. 
---
I would also recommend queuing with friends, people on siege are pretty toxic and don‚Äôt take lightly to new players. Their logic is that you‚Äôre new; therefore you‚Äôre bad, and you‚Äôll bring down the team. Even in the newcomer playlist.
---
I found this out two weeks ago and was absolutely dumbfounded. I showed my whole squad and lost the ranked match because of it probably.
---
If you have 1000 hours and still garbage there‚Äôs no fixing that, you‚Äôre just garbage and need to uninstall
---
[It's a secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwZISypgA9M)
---
I remember using that wall to spook some people while I was playing as Valkyrie, killing 2 people in the process as they were right in front of it. Never have I ever received such angry messages before haha. This is genuinely why I love siege so much. There‚Äôs so many random, whack places that are just so viable and fun to use lol
---
Top right
---
The tip I took to heart it t-hunt, single fire, headshots only. On house, clear it under 5 minutes
---
But following your idea they too would lose less when losing due to their throwing and gain more when being carried. It would not solve the problem at all, just bring it more into higher ranks.
---
Nice play dude!
---
Yeah but literally no one talked about him at all until this season. People used to think I was weird playing him all the time before this season rolled around now everyone joined the bandwagon
---
I saw a YouTube do it but could never find it lol
---
170 hours in,thanks for the info
---
Easy to play operators like ash thermite sledge thatcher
---
Coconut brahs taught me this
---
Wow what a real cock waffle you are!
---
no the "platinum" players on the other team.
---
omg so true I agree
---
Thanks! Its my round one strat for border. Hang out near that window till the last minute then finka blast your way in
---
they were also walling if it makes it better.
---
Most of them are virgins. They live in their moms basement or their life is sad so they try to take it out on others. I like to communicate with my team, but it‚Äôs hard when they act like that. Muting is your best bet or just leaving and queuing again. Trying to fight back literally makes it so much worse.

Not gonna lie. The slightly uneveness of the jammer makes me want to die
---
Unless you face another 4-5 stack there would be a chance for defence but other than that it would put a 5 stack on offense. But it's not the case and it's just bad luck, hopefully you get more luck in the future. And hopefully ubi deals with all the freakin hackers
---
When I first started, Rook on defense and Sledge on attack were my main operators. I see them as balanced, easy-to-use gadgets and have very manageable recoil. Have fun playing!
---
Kaid or the M590 if slug shotguns don‚Äôt count
---
∆í
---
its 1500 if you count menu time lol
---
Coms bans for a console platform thing. That's up to xbox and Sony and has nothing to do with r6s.
---
I could say crouch shooting can be cheating too cause that‚Äôs not how the devs intended people to play
---
Some really big fucking eyes coming right up
---
I‚Äôve never laughed so hard in my life at something this mondaine
---
Hoteleth?
---
Trivago.
---
Thicc
---
Just make it matchmaker with the highest rank. So if a diamond queues with a copper, they get diamonds.
---
really didnt come off as a haha joke, sorry
---
No one commenting about how the only thing he‚Äôd be seeing in the scope is the wooden boards, really close up?
---
Aim for the head
---
Shoot them in the face homie
---
The bug here is the melees that‚Äôs it
---
I cant relate I dont have friends
---
you saying it‚Äôs their fault doesn‚Äôt make it their fault. Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt have their own servers and DDOSing is already against the law. so how is it their fault?
---
That's more of a stg 44 and mp5 hydrid.
---
Big oof
---
That is a different situation. If you read my first comment, I specified external. Abusing the mechanics of your PC outside of the game. Mouse and Keyboard is something externally added to the game. Crouch spamming is in the game.
---
I‚Äôve had the same issue. For some reason my teammates don‚Äôt have a brain and the other team is sweating there balls off and I lost my plat 3 because of it and now I‚Äôm stuck at gold 3
---
Idk sometimes i do it to shut down certain hallways or doors if I'm going to go for a plant or need to give full attention to a different door cause I know someone is coming from it, so overall not the best use but has its place as a sort of high energy claymore.
---
This community can definitely be aggrivating at times. Everyone has choked a 1v1 in their time

The dropshoting bug was fixed weeks ago. Op had to re ads after dropping

Was it because of Marleys video ?

Teammates r missing brain cells but I found a team and I‚Äôm gold 1 üòÇüòÇ

Who‚Äôs to say my

Dog

Didn‚Äôt trip over my Ethernet and caused me to disconnect. Or I sneezed and accidentally pressed alt f4 . U can‚Äôt prove anything , in just saying people get salty for something so minor
---
Aim for the head, their back thing, or if you‚Äôre feeling lucky you can shoot the remote in his hand and he won‚Äôt be able to blow up
---
App is free, so that's what you could do kkkk
---
Ubisoft uses Microsoft and Sony servers buddy.
---
I also reached gold for the first time, making it my first ever ranking. Even though it‚Äôs just gold IV, I‚Äôm not risking going down ranks because I want the charm.
---
Cool flick and all but like could you trim the clip a little geez.. and maybe fix it being horizontal
---
Definitely, I was on like 15 hp to, so that didn‚Äôt really help me out :/
---
Yea my bad still a lil new
---
Horny teenagers play video games and just want to annoy the shit out of women, don‚Äôt pay mind to it.
---
I knew it was there didn‚Äôt know it was behind the painting tho! That‚Äôs cool
---
Man idk people are just dicks. Most girls just play in a tight circle of friends. I actually did I kinda social experiment and put my sister on the mic. Outta like 10 games we got kicked out of 2 and kinda harassed in 2 more. I'm not mad, just disappointed
---
So true also give recruit elite skins
---
I'm not disagreeing but I've seen people vote to kick for lesser things like not pushing when they want or trying to rotate. Etc etc. Did they say why their kicking you or are you assuming it's because your a girl? Either way, good job on trying to clutch. Got more than they did so claim that.
---
Bro this is one of the oldest tricks in the book
---
And once again you didn‚Äôt read my comment. Just because it‚Äôs unidentifiable doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt cheating. They get salty because it‚Äôs not part of the game, and rightfully so. Also, an interrogation is not minor. It can be a round-tipping factor.
---
So them losing a player is an unfair advantage?
---
Because this is the only game I‚Äôve ever played that suffers from this problem, every other online game I‚Äôve played doesn‚Äôt have this problem 
---
Also please link me them saying something about servers being booted because I honestly wanna see it
---
Not the most sportsmanship thing I've heard. Weird flex, but okay
---
Flair checks out
---
Wrong!
---
They didn't kick you for being female they kicked you because they're assholes who think losing a 1v1 is grounds for kicking no pussy pass
---
Pretty balanced assuming the diamond didnt do all that great anyway
---
Yes. The player is already down and soon to be interrogated. The teammate was lost in that situation already.
---
Currently experiencing this now
---
I mean maybe an edgy joke about women are funny once but if its this or bullying throughout a match, its just plain stupid, people think its funny to ruin others day
---
I've fallen (literally) for one of the classic blunders
---
Had one teammate complain that we werent calling out in a casual match, so i told him he should start calling out now too. Legit first call out he made is HES OVER THERE DID NO ONE SEE HIM. Wow, there...
---
The question posed was how he is still unbalanced and unbroken, so I just said the obvious. Bloody hell.
---
You‚Äôre right. If I can‚Äôt clutch the 1v3 I‚Äôm always left with, those kills I get really mean nothing.
---

Tbf this is Ubisoft you can‚Äôt really trust the reveal trailer
---
That is, by definition, smurfing.
---
Let know what's you in comments below
---
But nothing about this clip really strikes me as blitz problem
---
So you think these people that leave the game when Cavs gonna interrogate should be banned or something?
---
I think his was one of the better icons...
---
Look at Medusa's eyes = petrified
---
Look at Blitz's shield = blinded
---
for the seconds time, that doesn‚Äôt make it Ubisofts fault. Ubisoft uses Microsoft and Sony servers. in case you can‚Äôt figure it out, that means Microsoft and Sony have to fix it 
---
you‚Äôre more than capable of using google and looking for yourself buddy.

If you play on console turn off aim assist on t-hunt

---
Ok so
---
Let‚Äôs say u don‚Äôt pressed alt f4 but instead I pressed quit game and brings me
---
Back to the main menu . Same result , and it‚Äôs part of the game
---
Because I never left the game I just pressed menu and left . Now your saying pressing menu and quiting isn‚Äôt part of the game either hahah?
---
Atleast acknowledging the problem would mean atleast something, I haven‚Äôt seen anything
---
Diamond rank on console is servers being booted every few games so majority of the community doesn‚Äôt understand
---
Just keep playing, lvl 46 is jack shit compared to what you‚Äôll learn by 100
---
Nah anytime I've randomly kicked someone in casual it was because my group was bored or the person was especially bad at the game, I never found I had any sexual attraction to these people.
---
I'm going to out forth the excuse everyone says when called out for being bad "I'm / he's just having a bad game" but yeah he went 1-1-5 but usually when I get diamonds on the enemy team they preform how you'd expect, especially with my subpar teammates
---
They read the first sentence, downvote, and move on.
---
Than maybe they should use other severs or something, and if that isn‚Äôt possible then why don‚Äôt other games suffer from this problem?
---
üòÇüòÇthat‚Äôs a fact buddy
---
This ain‚Äôt it ..
---
#ROOK IS SEXY
---
For the attacking team, it's okay. The defending team is not very balanced with the diamond. That probably makes it harder on the attacking team.
---
The difference is that that causes a penalty. Alt-f4 won‚Äôt because that counts as a disconnect while quitting to the menu counts as actually leaving a game.
---
Wow. So if I were to use something like a mouse with extra buttons so it's easier to crouch spam or prone, you think I should be penalized? It's an unfair advantage.
---
Lebel
---
It‚Äôs not that bad I think I‚Äôve done it like 5 times successfully . Other times I left and the interrogation already started caused I waited too long . It‚Äôs not too bad there‚Äôs worse things to be worried about
---
I remember when shields didn't stop nitro cells, and the scariest thing was when you heard that beeping noise get louder.
---
I‚Äôve been paired with teammates that hide on attack until the tram dies, gets 2 kills in the resulting 1v4 and dies. they end up with like 10 frags in a 4-1 loss and say ‚Äòi carried the team‚Äô
---
Yea, it‚Äôs just sucks because we just want to play the game like any other person, but we harassed about it :/
---
I have made a punch hole in that wall and killed so many attackers. They almost never see it coming.
---

Yep. Really digging into the stereotype as well. Let me go next, I bet you like to cry when you get killed because you walk into your teammates like of fire. I bet you cry when the game ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt let you lean‚Äù or ‚Äúyou hit him in the head‚Äù, I‚Äôm probably wrong here, but the point is that stereotypes that old aren‚Äôt representative to the game anymore, j√§ger is nowhere near as powerful as he was when he had his acog, when the stereotype was made. Same with ash.

It is an exploit. You ragequitting has nothing to do with being tactical. You are literally and actively circumventing the games rules. Like a "No" button which would prevent any operator from simply using their ability for no reason.

---
1. Smurfs play in newcomer because they think because they hit gold 4 on their mains they are basically gods and play newcomer to make themselves seem like the next beaulo. 
---
2. On attack you can peak most of the time and on defense you can‚Äôt peak as much
---
Are you okay?
---
They showed that during the map showcase..
---
That wall have become handy many a times for me.
---
Nothing if you have no proof bud. Chances are, he‚Äôs not hacking if he‚Äôs not banned.

It's all a matter of preference; most people seems to love the black ice skins or other flashy stuff, I tend to like either the very plain ones(like Kaplan or sledge elite weapon skins) or ones that look beat to shit like this skin.

---
It is. The S10 was the standard issue gas mask for the British military until a few years ago when it was replaced by the (far inferior) GSR.
---
First off and I can‚Äôt stress this enough but on defence if an attacker is holding a peak never attack them only peak when you don‚Äôt think anyone is there.
---
Second play casual instead of newcomer but make sure to turn off everything but bomb if you are looking to be better at the game and play ranked. 
---
And for peaks you can look them up on YouTube plenty of peaks showed there.
---
I always tell people "Clutch or Kick" and then never kick them. I usually do it joking, but I'm a filthy casual, so. :p
---
My favorite is when people message me saying 1v1 on Xbox. It's stupid. Im sorry you we're hit wuth some Toxic players. Just remember, harassment is when they continue after the game is over.
---
That shotgun is huuuge.
---
I have had zofias ability bounce of several walls and objects just to come back through the door and hit teammates in the face.
---
People play newcomers because it‚Äôs an easy way for smurfs to level up to level 20 for ranked quickly. 
---
As for angles, hold ones that are by major entryways and/or you hear enemies coming from. Find a nice piece of cover that can hide most of your body when you lean and hold it generally at crouched head level or head level, but I wouldn‚Äôt put it past someone in that low of a rank to crawl through a doorway either. I always recommend not peeking angles which you feel uncomfortable at. If you‚Äôve been getting suppressed at one angle and haven‚Äôt hit many shots, it‚Äôs best not to try and peek again. Also, don‚Äôt peek into a stream of bullets or without leaning most of the time. 
---
One last thing you should know is that this season is shit. Lots of hackers and bugs going around, the game needs an operation health 2 (the first operation health was a few years ago when they spent 3 months debugging the game instead of releasing more content.)
---
Nope. That's for casual.

Ok so I guess you didn't understood the title, first time I tried this in casual and I failed, then I tried it in rank and it worked, I didn't wrote that in the title too because I thought it's obvious

Shoulda said

Cavira‚Äôs playstyle is disruptive enough, but right now it‚Äôs like she has two abilities; sneak and interrogate. It could almost be it‚Äôs own operator. Picking off strays it was she does, but the fact that she‚Äôs banned 90% of ranked speaks volumes.

Were they being genuinely sexist when they kicked you or did you assume it was your gender? Everyone gets kicked for not clutching, that‚Äôs just assholes being assholes on the internet. If they were treating you badly solely because you are female than I recommend finding a squad of 5 you can play with.
---
It happens man, my friends and I were going for plat this season. Two got there, me and another got to 3 wins away. We then lost every game for like 3 days.
---
It‚Äôs the competitive game mode though. The whole point is to have balanced matchups. If we let a legit high rank queue with legitimate low ranks and put them in the game with all high ranks on the other team chances are they get a free win, which isn‚Äôt any more fair. 
---
If you want to play with less skilled friends, play casual. Ranks only matter if they were earned and giving people easier games ruins that.

People using XIM or the Hori Tac Pro won't be banned simply because it is not forbidden to do so. Heck: Ubisoft even added a sensitivity option without acceleration which makes it easier to use said input devices.

Thank you üôèüèª

Sometimes your friends get unlucky in placements, or you've just queued more than them and are far ahead. Best off not restricting it but just fixing the system so they'll be queuing in the right elo range if they're searching with you.

If you know the player is good then there is no reason to give callouts. But if a player is bad or seems to never adjust their approach when you hear enemies coming then they may need the help. The sound in this game is already buggy but I hate it when I know an enemies location and my teammate looks the opposite direction in clutch moments. They may say I dont need the help their actions says otherwise.

Making a clip in a custom game? Could have played a soft breacher or anyone with a breach charge.

Always communicate everything that could contribute to a win even after your death, one easy ways to do this is to learn call outs on every map, I would recommend going into custom games with an experienced player and having them teach you all of the call outs for every mapüëçüèº

I have looked up RAM and basically with a lower RAM your going to get less frames because the PC is working harder making it much harder to process which maybe the problem with fbs so most likely the problem

I think with mid-season reinforcements coming they will revert some changes. They might stick with the timer for his scope but lower the time it takes for thermal to kick in.
---
Sorry, but he really doesn't. His ability involves a pretty major amount of risk, and only provides pressure and suggestion, not hard Intel. He has a good weapon suite, but that makes it easier to perform his role. 
---
If you're marked and off site, you can be fairly sure he'll be coming for you, so you have a reasonably good chance of predicting his approach and anticipating the firefight. 
---
His ability doesn't persist after death, and is cleansed if it was active when he died.
---
I don't honestly see the issue with him, he's not too strong and he's not too weak.

It's a soft wall. Idk why they decided to illustrate it with thermite. Just makes confusion for players that didn't know.

I know it's very annoying but there's really not too much ubisoft can do about it. The solution you suggested would not work to well (probably). If someone in the group accidentally kill a team member, everyone will now have a warning which wouldn't be too fair. Could work though, who knows.
---
Any game where there is a reward for winning, in this case a rank and a charm, people will try to abuse it in anyway possible. They want the easiest way of getting something without actually working for it. Crota not dying on destiny? Cheese it. Can‚Äôt do the raid on the division? Cheese it. The world is full of cunts and that unfortunately means that some of these cunts play siege. As long as the developers get paid they seem to care little about stopping these types of things that ruin the game for everyone else trying to play the game and enjoy it. The people who cheat if you think about it probably have quite pathetic lives as they are not given rewards for free in the real world so learn how to ddos lol.

I don‚Äôt think you fully grasp the effect weed has on some people playing drunk is one thing, but I can honestly say I play games better high. It helps me make better in game decisions it helps with the processing of information and how to use said information. Also it helps to deal with the people who can‚Äôt check their anger and get toxic when they get killed by ‚Äúcheese‚Äù .When your high and locked in for me at least my reaction time doesn‚Äôt change no better or worse then being sober. It‚Äôs low key like adderall for me but I do smoke exclusively Sativa and it makes a difference.
---
Its been a painfull two seasons.

Having to deal with this at least once every day if you play about 10 matches is extremely bad.

At that point, hypothetically, people could just spam an empty chat block.

For example: hitting T to chat to all, hitting space, and sending it.
---
Casual is not a designated memeing game mode. It is there as a break for you to not try too hard but still try. People are not trying hard enough imo. I cant solo queue in casual without being arbitrarily teamkilled while simultaneously having to carry to get the renown i need because my teammates dont try at all. So i just dont play casual anymore unless i have 2 or 3 friends.
---
That does explain why I can no longer send people hearts
---
You should record or something to see if you can prove this factual because that would be interesting. Thank you for the not toxic reply also.

---
Okay, listen. I get that it's annoying when you can't rank up because of your teammates (I've been there). But at the end of the day, it's a game that most people play for fun and not necessarily the competition and if that's how they like to play you shouldn't get angry at them because of that. I recommend getting a squad to play with so you don't have to worry about your teammates.

This is now the 100th post about this shit. Kinda repetitive and useless, just like her AR mags

When I come back to siege i usually pick operators that are easy to use, like rook, mute, alibi, etc.

I am working on that I just wish I could find player that are like duplicates of me if you know what I mean not trying to sound cocky.
---
i guess. console sometimes fucking sucks when it comes to elo
---
Link to .png version, please.
---
It‚Äôs not the console, your just trash.
---
Imo the new hereford base is great. It's really not that complicated tbh if you play it enough.
---
And yes, i do hate coastline. In fact it might be my second least favourite map in the game. Just my opinion though.
---
That's why you never jump there, some times people can camp there with C4s,
---
Then i do you effectively attack/defend office and gargoyle?
---
Yeah, that was my reaction when I got the kill lol
---
I'm going to uni but I honestly don't think that is a massive issue. I study games design so the whole course is pretty much just hands on work, no massive reports or writing. I am hoping so anyway lol
---
Console is so fucking bullshit sometimes honestly
---
He shot at the crossing connector into projector but his reaction time was frankly awful. OP had the bad luck to sit behind the softwall where his bullets would land
---
YOU POTATOED!!!
---
It spawns that devil bomber
---
that is something I don‚Äôt have the answer to lol
---
Overpowered
---
Not sure what your hours have to do with a map that's only 2 seasons old.
---
It is pretty upsetting how it shows Blitz in the stunned animation but still kills you. I‚Äôve had this happen to me on many occasions so I just got used to it.
---
I can play some later
---
Yea of course no need to get toxic over an opinion, but siege is the only game I haven‚Äôt decided high. I‚Äôve recorded a lot of fighting games and I can see a vast improvement in my spacing and map control as well as combos. I have been thinking about recording siege just as a way to get better that‚Äôs what I did with halo 5 and made it to from silver to onyx pretty quickly. I get what you‚Äôre saying though people who get couch lock when they smoke aren‚Äôt much help gaming üòÇ
---
Lmao this team would be too OP
---
Bandit on defense sledge on attac
---
Op, having a psuedo mira that you can place anywhere on the map is just insane, sure the windows can be seen from both sides but the defender still had the advantage because they can uncrouch and prefire the attacker at any moment
---
I don't think the kafe rework is considered small the first floor was completely changed and the third almost everything. If the they are going to change almost everything from rail platform to cash room on first and second floor. They are changing like 60% of the map i don't believe it can be considered small rework.
---
Why do uou think they are adding that kind of zombies this winter?
---
Does the report toxic behaviour button on console even do anything?
---
I had a 3 solo vs. 5 stack in ranked last night. Lost Elo. This should not happen. The leavers should lose the combined ELO of the team and the remaining players shouldn't lose anything. The winning players can keep their ELO because it isn't their fault.
---
200 IQ post.
---
But why would you. Theres a window to outside right opposite to it and the other way round is useless and equally risky.
---
sure, just add me whenever
---
They hate you because they ain't you.
---
help us
---
This will be very helpful
---
Flared as 'esports'.
---
I respect your opinion, what plateform you play on and what‚Äôs your rank?
---
&gt; Its not always possible to know if the enemy is spawn peeking till after they start shooting.
---
Yes it is
---
Only top tier plays here
---
I used that spot a few times to get kills.
---
#HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS IS SO FUCKING FUNNY I AM LITERALLY CONVOLSING ON MY COFFEE TABLE IN FRONT OF MY WIFE AND KIDS I HAVE LOST NERVE FUNCTION BELOW MY NECK PURELY BECAUSE IVE STARVED MY BODY OF OXYGEN FROM LAUGHING SO FUCKING HARD SERIOUSLY WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW FUCKING FUNNY THIS IS I AM RUNNING OUT OF BLOOD BECAUSE I AM CRYING SO HARD IM BLEEDING OUT OF MY TEAR DUCTS AND PORES I AM EUPHORIC OVER THIS ORIGINAL AND WELL CONSTRUCTED JOKE!!
---
He's definitely still great. I use glaz all the time on attacking and get a decent amount of kills. Hes a sniper, snipers aren't meant to just rush. If you do hsve to rush at any point just take the scope off and the guns great.
---
Even on PC it's probably one of the worst, especially at lower elos.
---
stares into you soul from the corner of obj\*
---
OP.
---
Overpowered. The same way you cannot approach a mira window, you won't be able to do the same with the shield. If they are going to add this to the game, they need to treat them like frag grenades and severely limit who gets them.
---
Shallow roamer, the lack of any soft destruction if you‚Äôre running the carbine means he‚Äôs less easy to flank with than Vigil/Alibi/Cav
---
This doesnt tho its literally just a more zoomed out version of what we have rn
---
the pest looks a lot like the mesmer from subnautica
---
Man that looks weird.
---
I wish people would actually pay attention to the map they're playing rather than just banning ops they don't like. You'd be better off banning monty on most maps over blitz to prevent those bullshit plants where he stands on the defuse.
---
Like think about what map you're on instead of just banning the op you don't like. I get cav and Jackal more because they're strong on every map but blitz it's dumb.
---
This survey was approved by the moderation team
---
Well yeah it's getting a fairly large rework, more than clubhouse, but it's nit completely changing like hereford base did as far as i know.
---
Honestly in my opinion, if Ubi reworked Tachanka I feel like him being able to turn his turret a full 360 would be nice. Or you could just mount it to a deployable shield and make it have less recoil but can‚Äôt turn as much.
---
From my understanding there‚Äôs not much ubi can do on the console side because they don‚Äôt directly own the system. Microsoft and Sony do. They are the ones that make those decisions because they are the owners.
---
Frost is actually man down tier in anything outside of casual.
---
yeah. I took the hint that day and decided to put down the controller and go back to sleep
---
Inhuman Reactions!
---
You're calling peoples comments dumb? I'll tell you whats dumb:
---
Making a post on reddit expecting a single fucking person to change the way they spend their game time because some stranger on the internet gets really angry.
---
Now that's fucking dumb.
---
Rip hay fever sufferers.
---
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

False, was diamond on PS4 and Xbox almost every season up until op health and quit playing as much plat 1 last season on PC. Was even diamond when the game first came out and diamond was nearly impossible to achieve
---
I want to apply.
---
Sorry for what you have to go through. I‚Äôm also a female on Xbox, but I haven‚Äôt been treated this bad before. I hope things get better for you.
---
This has nothing to genuinely do with JUST verbal harassment. This is about a gaming company regulating it's community and dishing out much needed punishment to children who's parents need to beat them.
---
Wait, That's illegal
---
Ill give buck a go when im next on i hadnt thougut of that!
---
here's a tip. when using the hack let go of the gadget button after the text saying "hold rb to call defender phones" goes away and you hack the phones and can do stuff sooner. Not that usefull but in a gunfight the time could help
---
When ive got enough renown ill unlock nomad and give it a shot
---
He will be map dependant for sure, but maps like Bank, Kafe, Consulate and Club House I see him getting a fair bit of play on
---
Try using a slower or higher sensitivity
---
Are you connected to the internet? Has it installed *completely*?
---
No because bomb is the best mode. Why would I not wanna play that lol
---
I prefer secure the area
---
Do it console is absolute cancer Ubisoft needs to do something about it before siege goes the same way overwatch did.
---
That ONE red laser on the right side is actually pissing me off
---
100%, reason ill never play ranked in R6. You should be able to queue with anyone below low plat or high gold as a diamond. Other games restricted this shit years ago, ubisoft is just too shit.
---
Valkrye  probably
---
He looks a bit like a minecraft villager
---
That‚Äôs cool
---
Huawei phone?
---
Ypu play exactly like me
---
Well it really depends on the user and attachments. I myself don't really have that much issue with the 11 but 12 i never really used so i dont know the recoil pattern
---
Well if EVERYTHING is scaling it would have just the same recoil, no? I might be retarded though ao if im wrong tell me
---
*It is known, Khaleesi*
---
I hate this. I tell them BEFORE the match starts, and then when it's a 1v5, and I lose, they try to votekick. That's why I no longer solo queue
---
Mozzie will be though. Trust me, he‚Äôs scary good. In a few seasons, he‚Äôll be a top tier pick
---
Gold 3 previous season, nothing to brag about really, you're still bad
---
All personal preference I guess
---
^
---
What is the risk of playing jackal?
---
Hey look at the bright side, he came back to say hi :)
---
Well I got that 1.5 WL and a 1.3 KD so I mean I guess I can‚Äôt be that bad. I‚Äôm certainly not putting thermite charges on plain walls bad.
---
I remember on the tts for para bellum i eould just play pulse shotgun on the other side of that
---
When and why? I am limboing between gold 1 and plat 3 for weeks and i saw him getting played 2 time or sth.  Smoke and mira is the pick for bank and maybe echo or maestro plus those. I think he is completely uselles.
---
I didn‚Äôt say anything about recoil, that was the other guy
---
You say this with a team kill warning lol.
---
I understand it could be a friend or a complete accident but you must see a little irony here lol.
---
Omg I had no clue
---
Is that a dildo?
---
Flashbacks.... damn dude i remember that shit was fucking amazing
---
acog
---
Sometimes your thumbs just don't want to work with your brain. It's common on console to either over or under aim a target when you're not focusing on it or are just straight up tired.
---
Damn your girlfriend is looking like a snack in that ski mask
---
This happens when you haven‚Äôt fully installed your update (fully copied onto ps4) or if you have disconnected from the internet.
---
If this still keeps up, my advice is just to restart the application, or maybe reset modem.
---
Same happened to me.
---
Idk how he manages it üòÇ tbh he doesn't he's been playing pretty terribly since he changed it
---
Why is there an add at the end of the video?

Ill understand if mozzie was released this season. But mozzie is out for like 4 months. Pro players sure tried him when he wasnt in pro leauge. But i dont think they found mozzie that special and that meta changing so they didnt pick him neither gridlock.
---
you killed him.
---
He we on such low health that the impact of my flash charge killed them.
---
What you‚Äôre forgetting is that mozzie doubles as an intel op and an intel denial operator. He‚Äôs extremely useful in high levels of play. In addition, doc isn‚Äôt considered to be amazing in high levels, due to the game being about headshots. You can‚Äôt stim yourself if you‚Äôve been headshotted.
---
New metro or old train line
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 but why is lesion unplayable?
---
Old :(
---
You don‚Äôt have to put them in the hallway. Crouch mirrors aren‚Äôt super common. 
---
For instance, Penthouse/Theater on coastline, on the soft walls between the two sites there‚Äôs usually at least one crouch mirror. You can place a safe ADS being the halfwalls in front of each wall to protect your mirrors pretty easily. 
---
Same with top floor of Border, where a crouch mirror looking into the site on white stairs is pretty common, there‚Äôs places where you can put an ADS that‚Äôll be safe from attackers.
---
KD definitely does prove some skill and ability. To say it doesn‚Äôt is kind of foolish. But I absolutely agree with it being normalized by playing against equal competition
---
She can.... kinda. Finka is 2 armor, so a nitro cell that lands within two metres will hurt her for 144 damage. Even taking overheal and the DBNO health pool in account, it will kill her. However, if it's a little further away the boost heal can save her from instant death. If it's a little further than that she won't even be downed. I'm a little too lazy to look up the exact damage drop-off right now though
---
*What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land*
---

---
In all honesty it might be easier to spend like $40 on a 240GB SSD and install R6 on that, you‚Äôll load in pretty fast assuming your internet is decent
---
Is it only Sydney that has those stock train seats
---
How did I not notice these?
---
I'm no sure
---
Att Zofia because she has a solid gun and her ability is real helpful having 2 impacts to breach walls as well as stuns, and her withstand ability is amazing if you get picked but they can‚Äôt complete the kill. It keeps you‚Äôre team out of danger while you get up. As far as defense I like Vigil again he has solid guns and his ability makes roaming a little bit more safe by keeping you off drones and cams if someone is playing Doka. I‚Äôve recently been thinking about giving Valk a try knowledge is power and her cams give you a lot of info on the enemy if used well.

I want my lady clash back so I can only play shields

He gets banned every go, this is XB1 80% of the games, no Blitz, no Jackel, no Lesion, no Echo, and sometimes a no Monty or a no Cav thrown in instead
---
They‚Äôre doing okay. My only issue is really that they are trying to dictate the Meta by playing with operators gadgets and attachments. They also don‚Äôt understand their game very well. Half of the things that people found (like Bandit tricking) were never intended. They want you to bring only utility ops and then barricade yourself in site with reinforced walls and hatches with breach denial on them.
---

Hi new, I‚Äôm dad!

R6 is giving out claymores again?
---
There's really nothing to learn. With the exception of a few outliers, all the weapon types feel the same. Every DMR is basically the same to shoot, every AR feels the same, every SMG, etc. Theyre basically just reskins with slightly different stats.
---
Out of those, Nomad and then Zofia. Personally I find Nomad‚Äôs gadget to be stupidly overpowered as it takes the defender out of the game even if it‚Äôs only for a couple seconds.
---
Have you got a link to that? I was looking through the available skins when it came out but I couldn't figure out which ones are new
---
In a team finka in solo nomad her ak is just a killer
---
I play this game drunk fairly often, tbh.

But I do so because I purchased the game with my own money, and I play the game the myself, so that I have fun. I don't play it so you have fun. Fuck you

---
Thanks btw I'll try it .
---
I love when the flashbang comes in you move your head thinking you'll be safe lmao
---
No worries :D
---
No in this game speed changes the game if you are a 3 armour you cant peak as fast so you will have to hold harder angles and so thats when thr armour comes into place so you can tank more bullets if you are 3 speed when you are holding an angle you will get eaten because they are attackers and compared to your 30 damage 700 fire rate they have 40 damage 800 fire rate weapons
---
This computer is good and can run siege. However I wouldn't expect anything crazy like being able to play at ultra graphics with 100 fps also the computer does have thermal issues so if you were to play games on it for more than an hour the performance would decrease. Another laptop I would recommend is the Acer vx15. (there is a youtuber called Dave Lee that did reviews on both of these computers, I would suggest checking them out.)
---
You're a lifesaver it worked :)
---
Thanks again .
---
Yes
---
They don't ban the most useful they ban the most annoying
---
Well on reddit you have to because once people see 0 or -1, they hivemind and start downvoting without reading
---
The fm9 is a good gun maybe you just don't know how to use it.
---
Thank you sm
---
That can be said about any of these.
---
None of these make any sense at all.
---
Yeah usually if you restart it gives it to you but I‚Äôve had it just not give me a pack and still bring my percentage down to 2%
---
Can u teach me the ways of Siege
---
I am really enjoying Mozzie on Defense despite my drones being shot by teammates ALL THE TIME. Guess that's part of being a console player.
---
Seeing as the enemy had no issue shooting you. Let's say  that you need to get a new isp.
---
This. I don't get when people say these are better. Like, they make no sense at all and are just ugly.

Where did you find this? Is there more of this?

It‚Äôs always been like this or at least for the last year

I think it was just an excuse as to why they didn't add new guns for the new OPs. "oh, we Uhh tested it but it was uh too op"

You cannot transfer items and operators between platforms, no.

I guess its because medusa turns people to stone if they look at her and blitz has the flash on his shield which blinds people who look at it. Its a bit of a flimsy connection. Most of the beta icons were a bit crap, probably why they were changed.
---
Run and keep running don't stop, besides that maybe leave game or ddos the server. You might have to toggle your hacks
---
Looke like a STG44

im honored, take mye black ice

Nomad,twitch,buck, and thermite. Nomad gadget helps. Twitch has amazing gadget and amazing guns. Buck has the shotgun rifle combo. Thermite helps the team.
---
I think nokk was meant to be a hard counter to echo and valk
---
I am blitz main and even I ban blitz if we are defenders. In my previous match enemies forgot to ban him and I first thing I did was kill 4 of them.
---
It means do you feel as if your game is a cycle
---
Jackal or Zofia
---
Whatever
---
I play pc so I can‚Äôt relate.
---
I knew what you meant, I was just giving you crap
---
No jackal get banned a lot in ranked
---
maybe i should try it, but did you slowly bump up the sens or did you go straight to max?
---
It's from a mine on the opposite side, more than just that one do it
---
Fair enough
---
This has been around since like the release of the game lol
---
It feels like kanal was designed with tachanka spawn peeks in mind
---
Cause people are fuckin gay and wanna ban the same shit everygame. Cause Ubisoft doesn't want people using those ops.
---
And watch sometime soon they're gonna be like yeah these ops pick rates are low let's nerf some other ops to bring up the rates.
---
copper two my dude
---
I have never gotten a message accusing me of it, but I'm sure someone has privately as I do have really good aim with a controller and high sensitivity and can control almost every gun perfectly expect the obvious two machine pistols and scorpian.
---
Ranked is a waste of time at this point lol
---
Have you made any othe cards?
---
Praise the defuser!!
---
The colour is red. Unless they‚Äôve changed the colour of bronze, I‚Äôve yet to find out what rank this is.
---
I'd just like a normal card deck of rainbow for poker
---
i think it's kinda stupid to ban people for e.g. saying 'niger' or 'retard'. if you go to other games like CS:GO the creator of that game Valve won't care SHIT about saying 'offensive bad words'
---
He is our lord and savior
---
Siege is confirmed broken
---
if you have friends in a game you can't be votekicked lol
---
Ah ok. Idk that‚Äôs so weird. Maybe it was such a weird, rare coincidence? Like his phone went off and he messed with you?
---
holy shit thats like all you have said for the past like 9001 comments.
---
Yup, I made it on ela, Thatcher, fuze, IQ and Echo but dokka is the most achieved one
---
It happens when you least expect it, like when you‚Äôre not even really going for it. 
---
Got my third ace ever today simply because I wanted to know if Twitch‚Äôs 417 was any good. Tore the enemy team a new one. The verdict is still out on the 417 tho. It‚Äôs good, and I‚Äôm not sure I would‚Äôve aced with the F2, I‚Äôm just not sure it suits my playstyle.
---
I was protecting the defuser from above while some kid was screaming "DESTROY THE HATCH DESTROY THE HATCH" so I yelled "SHUT UP".

Yes that‚Äôs what I want to do first, after I will probably turn to a personnalised card game

I'm always flattered when I get accused. But if you play on PC and then PS4 it's usually ez to spot. Lots of times they do a perfect little circles after they kill me.

Thats so MnK lol. Controllers have shit recoil compensation even after years of playing

This is why i didnt buy the season pass this year. I wont give ubi anymore money until theres a proper ranked for solo queue. They also gotta work on their anticheat cus its ass and maybe not having 10 sales a year so cheaters can just buy new accounts for cheap.

Valkyrie has a good gun and her gadget is useful. On attack I main IQ or Thatcher.
---
Yea, this rook without acog and runing supressor is bad.

They took draws out with last update. In a situation like this defenders get the win because obj wasn't secured.

Having the Jager elite on a free weekend ?

That, and Consulate. I never spawn Police Line on Consulate for that exact reason: Tachanka is nigh unbeatable at that spawn. I even tried it myself, even though I don‚Äôt like spawnpeeking, just to see how easy it was.

A replay can be downloaded after the match is complete, so no, it wouldn't destroy your FPS like an active recording would. A system like Overwatch's or CSGO's is good to go by. Certainly better than absolutely nothing.

This problem actually made us go back to Warface, which we gave up on after we started playing Siege last year. We got our friends to quit as well for the same reason. I'm just gonna watch this game lose its' low rank players due to Ubi's incompetence.

Yeah after losing about 8 games destroyed the amount of elo I get I can win every fucking game this season needs a reset it‚Äôs bullshit not even that far in the season and I‚Äôm getting 30 elo and I‚Äôm gold 3 I‚Äôm normally high plat 2 when I‚Äôm getting low elo
---
i mean you can look at it that way, or you can look at it as good training. There‚Äôs a reason you guys are bronze/copper and I‚Äôm not rank shaming but maybe the practice with gold could help you with reaction times and also good angles and you‚Äôll even learn strats that high rank people use. I was stuck in gold for almost a year and finally hit plat 2 times this year. It also might help to play with a 5 stack
---
Yeah I float around high silver. It‚Äôs frustrating because when I have a decent team, I could place high gold. I have to take my chances on randoms tho.
---
Why does everyone get this wrong great and all powerful lord tachanka goes in the SS+ tier alone
---
Toxicity is on every platform, there is no more or less in any region/server.   
---
and every time Ubi is trying to fix this issue they're mostly breaking it that's why I believe they're taking a slow process. In my opinion, Toxicity can't be fixed.
---
Blackbeard is way too low.
---
Lion also needs a boost.
---
Oh my god ,That looks amazing
---
Toxicity is on every platform, there is no more or less in any region/server.
---
They really need to make bring back showing ranks in ranked games. Also make a system to match these people with others that are doing the same thing cause this is pretty widespread.
---
This happens to me when I play Lesion. But when im against him. Im always stepping on one of those damn things!
---
His question mark was when I knew it had to go on Reddit
---
Happens in high gold/low plat too. Basically whenever you are not queuing as a 5 stack it‚Äôs 50/50 whether you finish the match as 5v5
---
No it can‚Äôt be real no cat can ever get caught in a frost mat
---
I‚Äôll keep that one in the hip pocket

Hello deluxem4n, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c7ha73/when_you_miss_your_c4/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It was 5v5 and it's casual. Also I didn't see it was 2:0 and as I joined mid game and was piss drunk.
---
Because it's casual? Casual isn't mean for tryhards complaining about tower. Go play ranked
---
This happens to me sometimes as well. As you go further down from what your normal rank is (as someone already said) your morale drops because you so desperately want a win and it‚Äôs abnormal to have such a long losing streak. The solution? Stop playing for a while and wait for the motivation to play later.
---
Ok I think I‚Äôll get zofia
---
I would like the *Details*
---
I agree, but I was genuinely excited when it came through. I feel like I‚Äôm part of the community now
---
Good point, but why's it have to be gold and above? Why not limit the matchmaking range to only 1 tier above or below your own? I wouldn't mind playing against higher ranks if it was reasonable (in my case against silvers would still be reasonable) you can't train shit when you get headshotted the exact moment you come around the corner
---
Isn't this skin only for the IQ's AUG ?
---
# D E T A I L S INTENSIFY
---
Lion is still not good enough for a boost because of his ok ability but mediocre guns. Nerfbeard does his purpose terribly and personally I don‚Äôt like what his ability does
---
at first I thought it's Buck's C8-SFW
---
Ok so basically there‚Äôs this thing called health. If your health is low, that can kill you. If you didn‚Äôt know.
---
Vigil is way too low
---
How the hell. Can you slow that down
---
Wadu hek
---
Could I see them?
---
Maybe this game a jaded me up that K/D with the win rate and jump from plat 3 to diamond seems suspicious
---
the majority of people on console use a controller, i think most people (on console) would say that controller is more comfortable and overall perhaps it's easier to be good with mnk but when our console potato aim goes agains sweaty mnk tryhard it's kinda boring
---
r/subredditsifellfor
---
But it says that Arctis 7 is only compatible with PS4, not Xbox...or maybe I misread? I‚Äôm thinking about the Arctis 3 because it‚Äôs a decent price and it‚Äôs compatible with Xbox.

But time is irrelevant. It could be the 15th second or there could be 15 seconds left and you would still plant if you have control of the site.

His ability doesn‚Äôt help the team at all and his ability in general isn‚Äôt good for what it‚Äôs intended purpose is supposed to do. But, he does have good guns so next list I make I might move him to a B or maybe an A

Unfortunately

I have one of those floor mats

Tower might not be the best map but the problem with bartlet was that everyone was spawnpeeking. But I wouldn't mind having it in casual

This is for real list not a meme list

I‚Äôm sorry man that sucks

Ohhh u mean like get toxic. Ok
---
You too üòÅ

Hey man don‚Äôt worry about it, I‚Äôm glad you got through the grind that I couldn‚Äôt break through
---
what cpu you can reccomend?
---
Nice
---
Exactly in the right situation tachanka is op
---
I knew about it from the other side. Never notice it when I‚Äôm on those stairs
---
I know I know it‚Äôs not good but know it is I‚Äôm rocking a beast computer (to my standards)
---
oh and i forgot, They get a reallyyyy high rank friend and a low rank friend and the high ranks just ram through people. boosting technically just without hacking. So the reason you‚Äôre getting golds is because they probably have a 5 stack and have a single copper friend
---
What mobo do you have?
---
what type of card game will it be? will it be like gwent and hearthstone? or something like yu-gi-oh and pokemon?

Yo be fair if Ubisoft banned mnk on console we wouldn't have this problem

The fact the attackers have to consider "we better not smoke because warden might be watching" is huge.  
---
its more about denying them the potential to smoke/flash.   
---
Warden is useful every round.
---
That sucks man. How are you getting placed against them?
---
Hurry! Finish him before he gets revived!
---
I posted the clip just to let people and ubisoft know about who exploits/cheats in the game. Yes the reporting system may work but i do this more to show people who to avoid ingame if they casually stumble upon these players. I hate cheaters and toxic players because they ruin the game and kinda ruin the growth of the game.
---
i keep hovering between bronze 3 and copper 1
---
It‚Äôs definitely possible. Some people just have absolute breakout seasons.
---
Want to play ranked with me?
---
Yofia

im selling some awesome new oils that will remove your malware and cure your glitches/bugs

I play both, Zofia for the LMG capacity, Ying for the flashes/LMG accuracy.

Did you know he is the voice of the guy in the new CoD trailer?

Last night we were 3-0 ranked so I said sorry to our random doc, he asked what for and I just said I‚Äôm sorry. 
---
Round starts and I down my friend (forgot what he said in discord but it prompted me to down him)
---
I then asked my doc to heal him and instead he killed my friend and came to heal me lmfao. 
---
Our teammate won the round 1v4 in the end.
---
I would totally if I wasn‚Äôt at work
---
THANK YOU!!!
---
Think ubisoft is gonna make a autochess with the r6 operators, they have shown up in other games. And phone game tie ins with popular pc games are on the rise(dota, Diablo, league, etc.)
---
Anyone else notice what tachanka was doing
---
Give us more!

Yeah this season has been filled with leavers. I did my placements and at least half of them had a guy on either team leaving.

Hello AlmightyGyro, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c7ib0p/when_youre_defending_the_bomb_and_you_hear_fuze/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Ahh man your linework is so pleasant! I really love the shade of blue as well
---
Personally I think such a system would be fairly stupid. For me it boils down to a few points:
---
- if they are toxic enough for a system mute why not just ban them for a period of time instead of a half measure
---
- why punish others by allowing system muted players to be part of their team
---
- this system would likely just push those toxic players to do even worse, toxic player can't yell at a person that the toxic player thinks did something wrong then the toxic player will TK that other person.
---
I think a better and easier solution would that the system would just remember players you muted so if you got into another game with them they would automatically be muted right away until you unmuted them. This would remove the annoyance for you without telling the player their muted and potentially punishing others later on.
---
What rank r u

Yup, Ive been playing since launch and I still do that. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Is that 106 over there?

Do you think it's possible to sell one weapon of every operator as pack of custom coasters ? The layout fits great and I would buy it immediately. Really good job, I need this at home !
---
Obviously. You were starting a sarcasm chain.
---
Okay I suppose that works but then we couldn‚Äôt play ranked with the friends who are copper bronze because they would hate always having to match with high gold and plat

I know that isnt why, it has to be the game doing it. It don't happen for any other game. My stuff is broke because it wears out itself. I know ubisoft ghosts don't come break my stuff while I'm sleeping

Lol
---
Too bad, tell them to find a 5 stack with their rank, like everyone keeps telling me to find a 5 stack for ranked even tho I suffer from anxiety when I have to get to know new people. Or implement that change for ranked only and let them play together in casual with the current matching system

Frost is.... complicated. It takes experience to know where to put the frost mats, and her guns are meh imo. But if you learn and know how to use her, she is a force to be reckoned with in the right hands. Which are not my hands.
---
Bronze 2 because I went on a losing streak (I solo queue because none of my friends have siege)
---
Minor bug he just clipped through the shield honestly
---
Awww , I think I should paste it in another subreddit then
---
r/restofthefuckingowl
---
yeah I guess but a small buff would help console players out because, from experience, on console the recoil is very hard to control especially ela's smg
---
Yeah it should the only way to avoid it is muscle memory
---
Frost is most useful for windows (2nd floor skyscraper is a MUST PICK for Frost)
---
Yeah, this is a good point, I have been in gunfights that were decided by both going for headshots, and even a couple situations where a Blackbeard completely screwed me over.
---
Yeah. I main him sometimes, and it helps my k/d to flank the team who thinks they are safe, so I think another good adjustment would be to make him a 2 speed so he can be heard better when walking and sprinting, and maybe nerf his cooldown speed.
---
WHEN was he born

That‚Äòs a big oof.

I didn't know about it and apparently it was created today. It must've been this cult that drove me to do this exactly today

Well depending on how long it would take you to make the art(idk if you're drawing any of them or just piecing them together), you could just continue with your project and as the new seasons come out just make them as they go. It should only take 2 more seasons since we have 48 currently and usually each season releases 2 ops.

Nice :)

I don't think it'll take a seasons worth of playing to get used to it. I'd say a week.

All of the bombsites are viable. Vertical play can be used to make lines of sight even on the other objectives, like destroying Mira windows from below or throwing c4 from below too onto bedroom. There are lots of ways that it can be used.

Yes I agree with you. Ela is in a horrible state right now. The only people who disagree don‚Äôt use her or lie about being able to completely control. Take in part that her Evo only does like 15-18dmg to 3 armors. To top it off, her evo has no use when compared to the shotgun as the shotgun is highly effective. This in turn goes back to how she can‚Äôt hold a mid-long range fight and has to constantly reposition but guess what....No damn impacts either. They need to stop making changes based on how things are on PC only.
---
thanks man!

Another operation like Operation Health would be nice, but I disagree with the FMG9 being a bad gun.

You need to rewrite this with grammar. It's nearly painful to read.

Did you drone it out?

Yeah it was all over when the map came out.

I play on console and none of what you‚Äôre describing has ever happened to me. Might just be bad luck man

Good Point, What About Other Defenders As Attacker And Vice Versa
---
Lel was thinking the same thing

I tried but the drone got destroyed

The 'not being able to afford' argument is dumb, ok, save up the money for a PC, there's no excuse for cheating.
---
Again, if you want the TRUE experience, save up for a PC.
---
When did I get mad at Ubisoft? 
---
Don't make things up to further your narrative.
---
I'm not getting mad at the companies either, I straight up told you that it's shouldn't be a thing because it's cheating.
---
That's great if you favor MnK over controller, you can go play on PC then, the platform that offers it. 
---
Overall, you're trying to justify being a cheater cheater pumpkin eater and it's kind of sad.
---
While I understand that you can do that as well it doesn't hurt to add such a mechanic. Think of it more as a quality of life change.

Yeah, everybody know

I don't just expect children not to be racist fucks, I expect it of adults as well.

Watch out for common peaks and you are able to take them out before they can do anything. If you get spawnpeeked it‚Äôs 99% of the time your own fault cause you forgot to check first
---
Ok well i didnt
---
I disagree, R6 is significantly easier than CS:GO, or even rocket league.
---
Would be cool, but I don't really miss anything on attack that I do have on defense and vice versa
---
Do u play console?

Sadly yeah

Why the shotgun?

Restart your game, it should give it back

Dog shot

10/10 would buy

I won't disagree nor agree, but simply point out "significantly" is a strong word.

Thx for the help m8

I think that one was pretty obvious. :V
---
Yeah. Funny thing is I was in casual. A guy from a different game also said his game froze too, so that‚Äôs the weird part

I love 16:10
---
It was already known
---
Restart your game, it's a glitch
---
Nokk is pretty good, she can be very effective if the enemy team is relying heavily on cams but her weak guns make her a bit of a niche pick.
---
Warden is fairly underwhelming. His gadget is incredibly situational and not always even that effective when you do get the right situation for it. Plus he has quite possibly the weakest loadout of any defender. It's hard to ever justify picking warden, weak guns and a gadget that you often wont get any use from make him pretty unappealing.

You'd be getting tons of innocent kiwis shot everyday...

Only game in history to have sbmm in their casual mode. Leads to people deranking in ranked.

Nice you must come from csgo
---
We are in a dire need of thatcher mains........
---
I always recommend trying thermite, thatcher, and sledge on attack, or rook, Kapkan, or Mute on defence. However I would always recommend to try all the operators you can to get a feel for what you like.

I‚Äôm sure this sounded funnier in your head.

Shit this checks out tbh.

The fact that u tried to shoot the unbreakable wall... interesting

You put cav (who has one of the lowest win rates) above very good and versatile ops like Mira smoke capitao lion like STFU and delete your post

So is this like an operator gadget or an everyone gadget

Oh i play on console cause I'm poor so i don't know if any of my tips would help. I would say if you don't already just try to use him every match if you can. If i stop playing buck for even a match or two it throws off my gameplay next time i play him. If you use the assault rifle i would use the compensator over any other attachment. I did not notice the amount of people not using it when using a spray weapon. Probably won't be useful to you but i hope it helped.üòÅ
---
It has sbmm in casual?
---
I didnt say that
---
My understanding is that it removes the acceleration that is generally used with controllers to have faster reactions. On PC acceleration is regarded as a really bad thing as it makes mouse swipes inconsistent as it essentially increases your sensitivity during a quick swipe. Muscle memory is hugely important with MnK.  
---
  
---
If it does what I think, then it could be really good for console players once they find, and get used to a new sens.
---
You on pc?
---
I‚Äôm an avid thatcher player always looking to join ppl

Lion is garbage now jackal should be use caviera is what lion wants to be mira is only versitile on one game mode and smoke is only useful on the last 30 seconds

Hey im kinda new to this game (started 1 month ago). What does busting the server mean? Ive seen this happen on ps4. People getting 13000 ping. Wth is actually happening?
---
It's good to have favourite characters but don't get too comfortable, you need to have knowledge about every operator in the game, some of that knowledge comes from experience. In my circle of friends the worst player is strictly buck/hibana and frost/lesion main. When it comes to other operators, the best way I can describe this, is a total disaster, he just doesn't know anything. But that is not the problem, the problem is that once his attempt at other ops fails, he returns to his mains.
---
