How do you make a map, I didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing

Kaid asserting his dominance.

It is also unlikely you don‚Äôt have this headgear and not even use hibana and you‚Äôre just here in this subreddit to whine

The new face in general looks bad.

I completed all of them. Pretty sure i didnt skip any this last time.

You only get 1 daily, the 3 slots are just to let them stack up.

Get better internet
---
I kinda hate auto correct at some points 
---
NaM ?
---
Lol yeah
---
It tends to show up late.
---
If something like that happens I like to go and cook something nice, sit down with a nice hot drink, watch some Youtube and relax. By the time you're done a couple hours have passed and you'll have relaxed
---
Yes it's a really niche item for sure
---
Yep, i have been raging about this ever since the TTS was launched. 
---
Ubisoft shouldnt change things that arent broken. 
---
Fuck now i need to start shipping operators. Ok ok.... lion and cav. Make it happen ubi!
---
It's 30ish gb so a while depending on you Wi-Fi. 
---
i buy the all year passes and only ever bought elite skins, pro league skins or seasonal/event skins (halloween) so i never had much use of renown
---
This game can be very rarted sometimes 
---
Absolute midget
---
My update was 82 GB and my install is now 88 GB total. No HD textures. Fantastic.
---
This looks like it could be the cover for a Cav standalone comic 
---
Ahhhh okay. Thats what i wasnt getting. And the r6 site didnt explain it that well either. Thank you!
---
Nice
---
Nah it‚Äôs staying up so maybe you can learn how to play 
---
Why do they need to change the faces I don't understand
---
GG wanker

---
I‚Äôve played sledge shotgun in Thunt before Burnt Horizon. It is the pose OP posted. Sledge pose isnt new
---
It's y4
---
Thank you for trying to get this tiny adjustment fixed even though I don‚Äôt own the headgear
---
Probably mid season or start of next season 
---
The 3 slots are your buffer, you get one daily mission every day
---
cool opinion bro.
---
Anyone know if and when they will release the year 3 operator bundle? 
---
Was tha badjer? Or maybe Tux? Wait, no, it was jameski.
---
Uh no, both
---
Yeah, i had that turned on, was presented with a 83GB download, probably because of that.
---
Indeed
---
Still need to clear 54GB to download it. As someone who lives somewhere with slow internet speed, re-downloading all the shit I had to delete to clear space for this is gonna suck :/
---
I hope you‚Äôre being sarcastic if you‚Äôre not then you need to chill. There is no need to be so negative just don‚Äôt play her. I hate clash with a passion but you don‚Äôt see me cursing her out
---
No
---
This looks like a comparison for PS1 and PS5
---
In his bio he did break all the sad speed records 
---
How'd you get multiple flairs
---
So I subbed an hour ago, my account is linked and still no charm...hmmmmm.
---
You have to download the season pass
---
Its just purchasable alone for like 16k or you can get it in a bundle with one of the seasonal skins, Crocodillius I think.
---
When you lose a 1v1 on match point.
---
Like is said it was the first time playing this map. Unlike you I guess who played the TTS so much that you know every inch of the map. Sorry that I have a life and can't master the new map a few hours after it was released. Sincerely copper scum (My highest rank last season was plat 3 btw)
---
It recognizes the shield desync in the patch notes. Read them before you complain. Thx bb
---
Man i would love to have a chance to scoop that skin up
---
LEAVE HIBANA ALONE!!!
---
Ain't that the truth
---
I like both but I think the black matches almost all skins better
---
Won't be corrected this season? What? I'm sorry, it's probably because I don't understand, but how can it take that long to fix this?
---
Its an old clip and it didn‚Äôt happen yesterday, you karma whore.
---
That's on you, not Ubisoft.
---
Its cuz he‚Äôs on console lol
---
She‚Äôs only half muscle, I‚Äôm sorry but she‚Äôs unhealthy levels of fat. Source, am unhealthy levels of fat

Don‚Äôt say Nibba. It‚Äôs pretty fuckin simple. It isn‚Äôt their policies that are the issue it‚Äôs the fact that you‚Äôre a dumbass.
---
*visits 4chan once*
---
I have these cameras at school so yeah
---
They perma banned you for one offense? That doesn‚Äôt sound right. I think you‚Äôre hiding what you really said.

Am I meant to laugh?

I think they said in the first half of year 4 (meaning season 2, it's their way of saying that it's delayed).

thats annoying .

No I just needed to put an image

Did they give you a warning or something, or did they just do it?

The game is 85ish gb now. I had to change drives for update so I uninstalled and installed the whole thing again and it was 85
---
You need the Year Four pass OR wait one week because that's when they are released to non Y4 pass holders
---
Burnt
---
Xmas noob here. How long do we have to wait to buy an operator if we don't have a season pass? Thanks.
---
Ben this this I like
---
1 armors get zero damage resist, 2 armors only take 90% of damage (so they block 10% of damage) and 3 armors only take 80%.  This resistance does not apply to twitch drone zaps and lesion mines, but it does affect kapkan explosions and all bullets.
---
No cause people shock others just to get higher scores and an assist

(JOKE) The world would be a much better place if everyone preceded their humor with a JOKE warning.
---
ew
---
Yeah I know ! I‚Äôm curious to know how as well
---
Seeing how many on the sub are complaining an easy "no" is in order.
---
I however am on the side that actually likes the change, so fite me.
---
I feel like u see a Monty scouting out an area with his extended shield or blocking/shielding a door and u think he‚Äôs doing nothing. He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs playing Monty right.
---
Did castle get a buff?
---
I have two brand new controllers happened to both of them .
---
You have to be in sneaky mode to throw the punch to down. In regular loud footsteps mode you stab the dude.
---
So 1 bad day and you‚Äôre out? Lmaooo 
---
Just close all other programs and set your fans really low or off when you go to sleep. Most PCs can run almost idle without the fans spinning much at all.
---
Steam has the best file compression out of all game launchers

See? I pulled a sneaky on ya

you literally go to the front page of this subreddit and click the main top post

If your playing casual you shouldn't care

I doubt itüò≠

He was making a joke about their user flair 
---
I get fucked like this every goddamn season and I‚Äôm fucking tired of it not to mention I have suicidal thoughts everyday and this shit doesn‚Äôt help
---
I ended up deleting the BE file so that the game couldn‚Äôt boot itself back up and then I was free to uninstall it. Thanks for the help
---
Wow you really dug deep to find a wwe comment lol kinda weird
---
Need of  a wifi update
---
just melee 4head
---
this isn't miniscule. miniscule would be that bug where castle is barricading a door and if someone is running at him at the right time, that person floats up into the wall above the door. miniscule would be vaulting over the desk in tower restaurant reception when there's a shield and a person in the corner and you go into the desk. that's miniscule and difficult to spot. hell, i could never recreate that castle bug. sometimes they came through after it was barricaded, sometimes they went up a bit, but nothing game-breaking. 
---
this is a cosmetic that is *very* easily visible. they didn't even have to update her character model. she looks so weird now. her head is thinner and her skin is paler in the end of game screen. what did that accomplish? 
---
just the fact that they did it and didn't check her cosmetics is what bothers me. i couldn't give less than a shit about cosmetic itself. it's the fact that they changed something and didn't look at how that thing could affect other things. this wasn't a difficult mistake to spot. 
---
The people making headgear have absolutely nothing to do with those fixing bugs, tweaking maps, etc.  I seriously do not get how so many people do not understand this.  It's pure ignorance and it's in every game community, everyone expects bugs and shit to take priority over cosmetics and smaller things when they're completely unrelated.  Your points are totally invalid.
---
This poorly? This is a super minor little graphical hiccup from a major visual change. It's not like her face is blank or the masking of the headgear isn't there at all. Making changes to an older code and one with as many little things as Siege can lead to bugs, and all things the same this is a tiny one. 
---
r/woosh
---
Wtf is that thing on the right
---
Well apparently I'm an illiterate, thank you lol
---
While I agree that shields should not even be in the game, clash is the most balanced shield in the game atm
---
The clip or the sound?
---
Big Ronda looks op
---
Did i not say that it slows down?? Oh wait i did
---
Really? I‚Äôd kill for chalet but I‚Äôm okay without Kafe
---
Stop with this stupid argument. The team that works on cosmetics is not the same team that works on bugs. Somebody just needs to touch up something already out. Apparently instead they will be working on new cosmetics. Pure greed.
---
I‚Äôve done that but I just get teamkilled
---
It‚Äôs a video game. Stop taking it so seriously. 
---
I think so, to stir hype
---
I scout and clear out the obj 
---
I think if you get kills no matter who ya playing your plan
---
Yin them right
---
You should of instantly got it when you bought it. 
---
Better than EA still
---
Same bro same
---
Their guns are perfect
---
Yes.....
---
Are you  on ps4?if so add me. I'm not toxic. I'm a high plat player but I wouldn't  mind playing couple casuals with ya ?
---
I rely on this game to keep me happy through my depression and when shit like this hits it makes me want to kill myself *literally*
---
#SCOTLAND FOREVER!
---
Why did they have to change her face? It was fine the way it was.
---
Well in the original post u talk about how u just rush in and chase kills, which is the wrong way to play Monty.
---
Btw are you typing with a potato or something? 
---
Yeah... I would expect that... especially with a name as godlike as big Ronda 
---
Oh shit lol 
---
Most people dont have internet speeds that could download faster than what their PCs can decompress. If you are playing r6s then theres a good chance you have a solid cpu and maybe even ssd.
---
Now I'll finally have something to spend them on
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox sadly
---
This sums up siege so well. They cant do anything without fucking it up...
---
Hence why I said "Siege has done this before". You agree with this whale being added to the game? I forgot obese operators are common in real life.
---
Thank you for explaining, I was about complaining just for nothing and well done for ubisoft's devs.
---
If they have a weekend with extra renown, will they boost / add on to that bonus?
---
This is a minor change, but did they make ye reticles for Acog brighter ??
---
I got gold and it looks like copper
---
Since when?
---
https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Faqs/000024743/How-Does-Rank-Work-in-R6-Siege
---
Is r6 a mobile game now lol?
---
at that point you should have a pretty beefy PC that can decompress fast.
---
You could always get a single joystick for movement and use mouse for aiming.
---
Exactly, same with Kaid, Jackals 51! This is a video game OP
---
One week
---
It‚Äôs still annoying as fuck. Despite it being casual, I do care. 
---
I use casual as a warmup before ranked and if dumb shit like this keeps happening, what‚Äôs to stop it from happening in ranked? 
---
You should be happy, it lowered the total GB after the install 
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Yeah I actually own the same backpack I used on my wildlands character. 5.11 rush 72 
---
Cant unsee
---
Thanks 
---
It's a scroll poster UwU
---
That pack will come out in year 4
---
There's also a photo on new Hereford of hibanna, pulse and another operator I cant remember with pulse and hibanna looking more than friendly.
---
-_-
---
 I never played MW2 so I assumed it was the same as MW3
---
After 35gb, another 53gb appears WTF!!!
---
No? Be faster.

Nah in class bro typing quick, the thing is I play monty, I clear out a path for my team mates I get picks and kill at least a few defenders soo doesn‚Äôt that mean I‚Äôm doing my part, I wouldn‚Äôt play him if I just sat as a door and let my team mates get all the kills and have all the fun.

Gold 3 I think I know its gold something tho
---
 Yes

Isn't year 4 already started tho
---
It‚Äôs so fucking easy to kill clash
---
One week? How come some players can play as them? 
---
Ah okay bud. Well  good luck on not running into toxic players ‚úå
---
It‚Äôs a different playing style 
---
Monty isn‚Äôt a fragging operator buddy. His job isn‚Äôt to get kills.
---
Wow.
---
Thx
---
That‚Äôs makes a lot of sense tho 
---
I get it that you're about "body acceptance" and just trying to find a character you can feel attached to, but this fat bitch shouldn't be in the game.

I wana be mozzie I‚Äôm already mozzie, *gunshots*

Same with the new version of Hereford base, but I actually like the Idea of bombers. Though they are way to tanky. Like good god tanky.

Uninstalling the game in steam doesn't actually remove the files... Re downloaded the whole game a 3rd time and nothing. I'm just going to delete it and not play.

IKR?? Why can't they just use the model in the damn portrait???
---
Did you not read there tweets on why the update was big
---
Just want to give people a heads up. I don't expect action, it's more of a PSA for these kinds of people in a way
---
Prob ting as well
---
Is issue/bug flair only for moderator here? I made a post about issue and the only flair suit for me is Feedback.
---
Bruh I would answer your question but it‚Äôs literally taking rainbow AN HOUR to update rn fml
---
Thanks! It worked
---
Today
---
i got UHD textures and its only 49 (on Steam tho)
---
Just toxic community
---
You're accusing someone publicly with no proof.  There's a rule against inciting witch hunts or accusing other players for a reason.
---
Even if the guy is toxic, it's not like we can force the matchmaking to avoid him.
---
Is this Balsa Wood Tier? XD 
---
There are at least 2 stores filled with Philips advertisements in Splinter Cell Conviction. And they are the only one with advertisements like this in the game. So you‚Äôll walk through a street with empty stores and one giant Philips advertisement. 
---
She fat, she may be strong but that doesn't mean she isnt physically lacking in endurance and stamina. Being a tier 1 operator means you are to your utmost physical being that being lean, fit, and strong. All of the other women in siege are but why not Gridlock? Im pretty sure its feminist bs that had a hand in her creation and it comes at the cost of her hitbox so now shes an easier target as well as being 1 mobility (the irony on that one), and she also cant fit where pretty much all the operators can. Sucks because the gadget is cool af but im not putting myself at a disadvantage because being fat is what feminists think is what most women look like.

Why did they try to kick you
---
That‚Äôs fair.
---
I‚Äôll play with ya
---
Nah she thicc asf
---
Can confirm. Everytime someone reports the issue it seems to be on a 2 Core Intel Pentium Gold CPU. Hope they fix it soon...
---
What ADS? :S
---
few hours? 17gb are easily 8+h :s
---
Lol
---
How do you get these?
---
Clearly there is a demand for using kb&amp;m. Maybe they should just allow native support so everyone is able to play however they want. I don't think people should be forced to use a controller if they don't want to.
---
Jackal and Mira are 15k each (13.5k with season pass), the other Y2 ops are all 20k each (18k/op with season pass).
---
Dumbest comment I've seen today lmao
---
Literally farmer clothes
---
I just removed the files from the steam folder, used the control panel to uninstall Uplay and R6, and reinstalled but its finally working
---
This is totally a kick in the balls because just yesterday my friend got to 19 and we were really hyped to have him start ranked in a day or two lmao
---
Siege is running on the Assasins Creed engine lol
---
Poor baby :(
---
With no clips or footage I think u just lost a match and he top fragged on the other team so you got titled and are trying to slander him. 
---
Same here I've been waiting hours.
---
It matched pretty well with "Plinky¬¥s arcade" skin tho. they could atleast make it optional. not saying that they would have to make 150colors but perhaps light / dark grey, sand, black as a option atleast
---
Right, my point still stands, why do you do a headstand over this, but the cav pistol makes sence to you gun-wise, im very well aware of the balancing of the operators, im just currious why its such a big deal
---
Cause you hit a wall?
---
Get some glasses dude...
---
That would be new with this season. The Gold skin (which was exclusive to Y1 Seasonpass) still works now. Y2 Obsidian worked for Y3 Operators. 
---
It worked. Thanks!
---
I would say she has more of a heavy build, I wouldnt say that is fat
---
Seems like he‚Äôs just salty he didn‚Äôt get a charm lmao. They‚Äôve said that they‚Äôre going to keep doing it with the goal of getting more and more streamers involved. This kinda invalidates most of his points and makes it seem like he‚Äôs just impatient.
---
There's a program call joytokey that allow you to ser joystick mappings to keyboard or mouse presses.
---
It works in Wildlands so its really just laziness that they arent adding it here
---
Lol wtf
---
That‚Äôs one sexy Texan, he went to college where I plan on going. Texas A&amp;M

---

---
I dont play this game but the one on the left looks waaaay better.
---
After this patch the size goes down to 60 gb ish on pc so after this patch future updates should be much smaller
---
i had it on TTS and and after the patch today for me is still out there.I noticed my cpu usage getting higher too and maybe that is the reason?? I cant tell 
---
Nani!?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs siege.  I got the same card two days ago lol.  You can use some old drivers to fix it, that was working for me earlier today.
---
Looks more Asian here then before she look terrible 
---
LMAO
---
thank you so so much
---
I'll give that a go tonight, thanks. 
---
That list doesnt even have SEAU on it however...
---
Pc casuals are still toxic too 
---
Valk is more of an asset to the team, but Frost is good too. Both operators are worth it but I would probably get Valk first.
---
Or a now missing command set. 
---
Crop top counts as farmer clothes? I guess in pornos they do...
---
Yeah its 1 point per $ spent i think
---
Great job man, you're a hero!
---
But I want play as solo, you saying like if you want counter Caveira use drone or make team. And you are right. But I want. Any other recommendation if you don‚Äôt mind? Never mind I just gives up on this game and not playing this for awhile 
---
Really want a nuclear event, Burnt Horizon and you see Mozzie and Gridlock seeing a nuke going off in the horizon at the main menu.
---
i don't know why but i guess for now i'm gonna have to play on windowed borderless
---
i tab out very frequently to check stats or refer to map callouts and having to wait those five seconds literally means life and death in this game
---
That certainly made ME choke.
---
This also works on the season pass btw. So its 24$ instead of 30!
---
Its in game why?
---
Ubisoft is becoming blizzard so fucking sensitive
---
I've never had it effect me for that long though
---
You had to buy the pass before a certain date to get the operators and you might have missed it but I'm not sure. 
---
It's gone with the new update, they redesigned the tab
---
Much appreciated. 
---
There‚Äôs a new movement system? Do you know if this is on PC as well because I haven‚Äôt noticed a thing
---
If anything I thought I noticed my sledge felt like a 3 speed 
---
Should you be mid vault while the screen switches from game to mvp animation? Does your placement matter? Does this work only with sledge?

Thanks in advance

---
I prefer the M4 for the way it feels. Slap a holo, vfg, and a suppressor on it and it feels great
---
You could try those old drivers if it won‚Äôt affect other games you play.
---
Oof
---
I dont even code. In fact I had to drop out of a coding class (long story who cares etc.) Regardless, I saw how that shit works and i have full respect to any game dev. It reminds me of building a house, in the sense that the devs are the electricians and the house itself is the game. The devs are literally making sure every wire works. And its always  underrated and overlooked as "God why cant the developers just fix this glitch already!" Until you see how complex it gets, you'll never know.
---
Oof 
---
You should never do ranks on the first week of a new season, rookie mistake
---
Have you got UHD texture pack 
---
OMEGALUL
---
I'm not running an old version or anything like that... I was playing last night. I see everyone else's is 53... mine is almost 83, is there a reason?
---
Yes, but are there invisible drones that make you drunk IRL? What about drones that magically and instantly relay your position in real time through walls if you move? Or blowtorches that instantly incinerate metal without making very much sound? Or giant beartraps?

It's not a matter of whether these things are actually used in real life scenarios, because face it, most *aren't*. It's a matter of whether or not they are balanced in a game like Siege. Personally, I don't think that shields belong in Siege. At least not in their current state. If you have no Lesion on your team, or if Blitz rushes before he can get his mines out, you lose. If Monty plants the defuser and sits on it in a corner, you lose most of the time. In a 1v1 against Clash, you most likely lose unless she's totally braindead.
---
Anyone who vaults can move during the MVP screen
---
doesnt even stop the biggest issue which is people shooting you to 5hp. Should just reflect automatically. 
---
[removed]
---
The fok did you just do
---
I‚Äôll take that into account. I appreciate it 
---
Wait. So what if for Lent shes giving up her acog? So after lent is over itll be fine and her acog will come back
---
So I checked and I can actually use my spare google play credits to sub to him right now not bits or anything for 9.99/month. You reckon I should just do that? 
---
She looks like Raven the Acid Bath Princess of the Darkness. 
---
Elite skins don‚Äôt make someone better than someone using a recruit lol

It kinda makes me mad that your high school had coding offered. I would have loved that in high school. I‚Äôm just learning it now and It probably would‚Äôve changed my life. The only computer classes available in my school were to learn Microsoft Office. I only graduated in 2012. 
---
Oh.. yeah that could be it I guess
---
I just realized, the operator reflection is not on the fridge, THEY ARE ALL VAMPIRES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
If you‚Äôre worried about spawn peeking, than just pick an attacker with an acog. Oh wait, they all have one
---
Because its casual..
---
Works with any operator. As soon as the round ends count to about 5 seconds and vault.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs in the rewards section.
---
Thanks
---
I have gigabit, its 2 minutes now.
---
Simplified doesn't cut it. I mean, if you're a new player, are you gonna know what that orb even is? The hammer is a simple concept, but the others aren't.
---
The same reason Sledge isnt a 1 speed despite being the second tallest and heaviest
---
So if I were to use any other operator, it would be a knife animation right?
---
Are you running the Ultra HD texture pack ? I dont think it would be likely that it would be the extra 30 gb but it would definiately contribute to it
---
Reinstall the pass
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Probably. Some things don't show up but most gadgets and grenades do.
---
or OR maybe we could hold Ubisoft accountable for some toxic behavior. 
---
thanks for clearing it up. i was really wondering why wind bastion version was so bloated all of a sudden when siege is supposed to be around 50 - 60 gigs.
---
F
---
Yeah I do. That seems like a really big difference you're right but i can't explain it any other way.
---
See you in year 5
---
You dont say? I had no idea. I'm just implying throw everyone on those matches cause rank at the start of a season is worthless, also not implying rank has any value whatsoever
---
I doubt QA had the time to check every single cosmetic in the game. 
---
Okay
---
Cankles
---
season 1, year 4
---
Yeah i just tried to do this and wow looks like i wont be playing tonight...

Ya that would be sick too

If you say so. If you‚Äôre to call someone out on being bad, at least show your stats lol

They just send you a new notification but its the same one you got when purchasing season pass

Yes I know but have the guns always dropped off a dead body like that? With the skins?
---
the only correct answer.

lol, i‚Äôve seen this exact same shit before 
---
if you want to play this game, you get lost

Thanks so much!

People care way too much about kills in this game.

Glad I'm not alone... Oh well didn't spend all this money on my rig for potato graphics, it'll be worth it.

Buy a r6 credit code from amazon, redeem it on uplay and you‚Äôll have access to store. 
---
The crouching animation is slower. It just feels unnatural.
---
Another season of patching spaghetti code and fighting the same bugs that keep resurfacing/evolving, the fact something this glaring wasn't picked up in quality control is a shame. 
---
Honestly at this point just Make a Siege 2 from the ground up and offer owners of this a discount and leave it to die, honestly can't cause more trouble than repeating this same headache every season.
---
Also in light of the Dev response about the headgear why on earth will it take another season to fix it? 
---
Peak and ban in rank?:(
---
yeah we will miss toxic behavior
---
Oh thank you!
---
Just remember all of the awful glitches they had before and even after OP health that are now gone? Idk about you, but realistically speaking you're upset about a headgear that will get changed in the near future. A cosmetic item. That you can change out until it's fixed. If its gamebreaking that's one thing. I'm just happy people aren't running around invisible  because of a coding error.
---
Go to your library/games and apps and click on Manage Game/Add-ons and then go to the ready to install tab, they should be there.
---
they have never come with the pass
---
I believe this is an intentional design. It allows you to practice in more situation and events. It will help you further improve your skill and knowledge of the map. Imagining just hole up in 1 point all the time, playing the same strat and scenario over and over again, you wont get any better with situation awarness. You will get better at defending that point of course, but I called that an illusion to deceive yourself that you are getting better.
---
When someone steals your mvp with a 10 point lead
---
Of course the fuze mains ask this.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs something they implemented to help against crouch spamming
---
The lord holds no boundaries 
---
Lol you got someone all booty tickled üëç
---
Its an old notification from buying the season pass, you get it upon purchase not when the season start. Its a bug you aint getting any more
---
Yo!! Ultimate troll
---
There‚Äôs a couple heists where you have to drive, the one where you steal nukes and the goat one, there‚Äôs a couple where you can drive forklifts too. 
---
I really don't get why they're waiting. They were able to do the new comers playlist so why not pick and ban? They clearly have it available for implementation 
---
there should be a year 3 bundle fairly shortly
---
Idk why a mature rated game has chat filter lmao People can say tons of worse stuff over voice coms anyway, such a dumbass company lmao
---
Store could be down?

uninstall and reinstall

Okay thanks.

It is to combat crouch spamming.

So i tried this and its still connecting me to seau this makes me think its broken

Some dude was bad mouthing Aussie stuff and he said Tim-tams are bad so I told him to shut his whore mouth. Apparently you can't say whore either. 
---
I don‚Äôt see a problem here
---
Having same issue with my squad too, everyone has tried hosting it and we always end up with 150+ ping and getting matched with Chinese and NZ players. SEAU broken, again.
---
Wish I had people to throw placements with. 
---
It's preference but most people would say yes it is better, because the bigger it is the more you'll be able to see on screen. It's kind of like peripheral vision where the lowest FoV id say to be the equivalent of having no peripheral vision and the higher you go the more you have. 
---
I personally play at 90 because I like it, if you have yours higher you can see stuff on the side that people with lower fov wouldn't 
---
The legend to this goes way back to when we taught wars with bows and arrows and swords. When the British archers got captured they‚Äôre middle and index fingers would be cut off and sent back to the king. If you don‚Äôt understand this it‚Äôs because those are the two fingers you pull the string of the bow back with.
---
Gridlock is ok. She ain't OP, but she provided unhindered sound Intel in the form of traps being destroyed, which is very very powerful in a coordinated team. She's a nomad who provides more sound, but takes away less control from the enemy as nomad , so at least counter play exists. But she's extra powerful in a team, so I'd wish they either take away a Trax, or reduce it to 6 per claw to reduce the sound Intel. Even at 6, she's definitely playable. Right now, with 19, she takes away half the post plant retake duration from defenders, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is a problem.
---
Mozzie needs to lose one pest asap. He has too much Intel right now.
---
"Ranks at the start of a season is worthless" it's worthless because of the spike in returning players that just want to fuck around with the new ops and won't be sticking around. If you want to have a good time you should wait a couple weeks, if you've experienced any start of season, you know you'll get kicked or TKed for new ops. It is what it is
---
Because they can't police every match.
---
Also, team-killing will always be part of the game, it's just something you'll have to deal with. 
---

Yo, what's blowing my mind is the fact that there's an animation of her falling over when she gets hit towards the fuckin camera. This is too perfect and I'm skeptical lol.
---
The download size for me is 35.7 GB on PC with steam. Is 54 gigs with or without steam?
---
Who?
---
I had this problem occasionally before the current update (haven't encountered one post-updatr), not sure what's causing it either.
---
Kinda wish they had the black version separate so you could chose which one you wanted. 
---
Private Pyle?
---
They are reworking the code for the game, it is essentially a game download because of it
---
i am download new patch 60GB
---
Outback is riddled spawn peeks. Going to be a nightmare to play against Doc and Rook mains. 
---
That must be a horrible time, Gridlock must be crazy. Now I realize the other ops wearing gloves are pretty smart.
---
For Honor did this a while back, really nice what they are doing.
---
damn i feel for you, about 90 minutes here. 
---
Well House is small and u're encountering terrorists on every corner, so imo its the best map to practice aim because u have to be like Sonic hedgehog with some decent aim :D

how come seasons are always toxic at the start of the season? legit question
---
I ended up redownloading the whole game. 
---
its 35gb from Steam and 56gb from uplay
---
Aye I have another problem I boughr the season pass and I cant play mozzie or gridlock and my friend that has never bought a season pass can play mozzie for some reason

Me: *Vietnam flashbacks*

are you in fullscreen instead of borderless windowed?

*looks at Lion*

You might be getting queued into Brazilian servers. It's been happening since the update. Not a single one of my games haven't had 4 people in it that are latam.

Sure. Unsportsmanlike sweaty moves aren't cheap whatsoever

now i need a clean pair of underwear. thanks

I'm speculating the mid-season event will pertain to Australia rather than a summer or Halloween event since the Austral universal weapon skin is not available yet. I feel like this is a good indication of another PvE event like Outbreak.

This is the Austral skin: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ay711t/what\_happened\_to\_the\_austral\_skin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ay711t/what_happened_to_the_austral_skin/)

‚ÄúIssue‚Äù

It's happening both ways as well.

Yes, but I'm asking because we can only see 3 defenders in the screen. Either it was a 3v? or 2 of the defenders are running around as well. I'm not blind.
---
Well I'm on ps4 and I've been checking profiles of ppl with good ping and they've been us
---
But y is there no fov on xb1 or ps4
---
I ask because we can see only 3 defenders. 2 defenders could be running around. It's an honest question.
---
Why?
---
u/jinxi please upload with sound!
---
Interesting. 
---
This is for the April event. Look up some leaks. Everyone has  a .. *colouful skin*
---
It was announced for year 4 season 2 sooo next season
---
It‚Äôs coming in Season 2 along with the rank changes 
---
Yeah is should of been more specific, but anyone who's followed this games development should catch on. 
---
Heck. Thanks for that.
---
yes too big patch 53GB
---
[https://i.imgur.com/BWDhQor.png](https://i.imgur.com/BWDhQor.png)

That ranked is coming out of beta was revealed in the Year 4 Panel, NOT the Burnt Horizon panel.  
---
So any changes to ranked and also the glaz and Capitao rework will come probably in S2, maybe later
---
oh well was worth a try atleast
---
Is macie in this season too? Or do you mean last years charms thing?
---
It's also UHD texture packs. My Steam update was a two-part update that totaled 117gigs. 
---
Yep. I used to have the game and stopped playing. I bought it again.  dont know if they were free but I have to pay for them. 
---
Agreed, ping is normally 32 on SEAU servers, currently sitting at 126 on fibre internet. Broke siege ubi, plus i didn't get my R6 credits
---
I thought it was going to be a pixel 3 meme
---
I have pc and my update was 37gb 
---
Read this sticky post on this thread 
---
Will do Ty
---
He should have been part of last years first round of content creators getting charms. Macies is coming back again for a second time this year. 
---
I've been waiting 20 minutes for MrBones_cursed everyone is starting to get really toxic cause we are winning 3-1 during our placement matches so no one wants to leave.  
---
Negro is Spanish for the color black. Kinda hard to regulate a word that's offensive in one language, but is a color in another. Spanish players would be banned left and right.
---
Real or fake?
---
Yeah but it's not as useful as Jackal or Dokkaebi anymore at least imo. I liked the outline and countdown. The time given was enough for quick intel. My mind works slow so the fact that the timer is much faster and the outline is gone, I cant process where the enemy is as fast 
---
I am getting the same issue. The screen is just black for a couple seconds and then it loads in. pls ficks
---
M rated games taking this route is actually infuriating me. I'm not a snowflake. I don't give a fuck what people say to me. I have played multiplayer games for a decade and have never been offended by something someone has said. I couldn't care less. Censoring stuff in an 18+ game and not letting users choose if they want it or not is absurd. Battlefield 5 also sensors everything and there is no option to turn it off.
---
I mean it's a game where people are dying and getting blown up and I can't type shit in chat. Lmfao. I used to laugh at the people who called others snowflakes but I'm starting to get it now. I can't believe other people being little bitches is forcing this PG crap onto me.
---
It might have to do with size of audience though too. Matimio is by far a bigger YouTuber than streamer. He averages like 300 viewers while the others ones I names average 3000+ (shroud like 20k but any dev team will give shroud anything he wants)

I've done it with exact same points before.

If the server is ddos‚Äôd, you don‚Äôt lose anything and they don‚Äôt gain anything. It‚Äôs essentially like the match never happened.

35.7 i cant even read numbers

Wow I‚Äôm saving this. Absolutely amazing.

I do main Dokkaebi mainly for the gun and hacking feature. Her gadget is somewhat decent only if the enemy is close for you to hear the vibration

Facts! I was thinking of getting Alibi because she's my last defender before I get Mozzie. But it would be nice to have a wide variety of attackers 
---
You can find the post somewhere in this subreddit but basically the burnt horizon update is a smaller size than the wind bastion one on Xbox wind bastion was 79gb and burnt horizon was a 38gb download I believe but now rainbow only takes up like 46gb on my storage so it's a good change
---
20k? try 40-60k
---
It could be that some of the update was already pushed and you just closed steam without realizing that some of it had downloaded (assuming you didn‚Äôt play beforehand and auto-updates are on)
---
I know that mine was orig. 75GBs with the ultra res pack but 53GB without.
---
The new map looks gorgeous. Thank you to the r6 team for an amazing work. 
---
It‚Äôs the new season. 
---
I don't understand why so many people don't like Nomad. She can be very useful to make sure no roamer is getting behind you and she can also be used to defend the defuser or the objective. And it's satisfying to kill airjabed enemies (especially in casual when they never look for the Airjabs).
---
Nah, fuck chat filters.
---
The .- behind peoples names actually mean that they are looking for a team/org! For example  pengu's name is pengu.G2 The team name is after the dot. The stripe just means they dont have a team/org  but they are highly interrested to join one!
---
Chuck an Ela mine at the crotch to get tranny shark doodoodoodooodoooodooo.

this might have something to do with the season pass because i think if you have the year pass it‚Äôs a larger file 
---
just a guess tho
---
Good ol' Bartlett
---
throw the next game and gey 100%
---
look at the stickied post on the sub
---
We‚Äôre talking about her face and not her elite right?
---
The patch is already downloaded on OP's PC, it is the installation process that's taking time, the main reason why i uninstalled the game and downloading already patched version from steam rather than downloading patch and waiting an hour for installation, this only happens when the games have big patches.
---
This makes sense. Thank you. 
---
Never had stuttering before but have them now and had to stop playing. Hopefully a fix will come out soon? CPU usage has went down for me.
---
Why, now I won't get mozzie because I used this and now I physically won't be able to load so fast reeeeeeeee
---
It‚Äôs muscle not fat. Clearly a shitpost. 
---
Her head seems too round now
---
I just left mine, stayed on 1 year for about a minute then went back to normal 
---
Fake 
---
Starting Y4 ranked will be coming out of beta but NOPE. Ubi fucking backed off of course. Also why the FUCK is the new map in the ranked pool before anyone has time to evenbplay on it? Lost 4 ranked games in a ROW because it was only rotating outback for some reason. My entire squad has stopped playing rainbow less then 1 day into a new season.
---
F12

wHow

Usually a higher fov is better, u can see more things but in a game like siege where u can get killed by 1 headshot if u can see the head more clearly, u'll be at an advantage.

PS: I play at the max fov

I know what you mean, hopefully they tweak him a little more when they see how it plays now

Can someone send me this or how do we save this...
---
I hate the censoring stuff but I actually found the ggez thing amusing. Everyone knows what you're saying and I found it fun to spam at the end of a game when people were talking shit the entire time. The phrases were great.
---
If they did it for every "bad" word it would be pretty shitty because then you wouldn't know what the person actually said but that's just my opinion on it.
---
It's an honor to have that watermark
---
Are you talking about Kaid (the old guy one the screen)? 
---
I agree Mat is on the lower side of the view counts on twitch but arguably his view would go up driving people to his channel for the charm. Not to mention he has one of the more recognizable siege weekly videos on YouTube ‚ÄúSunday Mailbox‚Äù keeping the community engaged throughout the tedious seasons. All I‚Äôm saying is in my eyes it‚Äôs a bit disrespectful to not acknowledge his commitment to the game by immortalizing next to his peers among the siege community. 
---
you don‚Äôt need mains you need to be able to play every op when it‚Äôs needed, playing the same attacker and defender every round is usually not beneficial. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre referring to ‚Äúmains‚Äù as your go-to ops while you still play what‚Äôs needed
---
You're wrong, one of the devs in a video to hype of the season was like "We're finally going to be able to remove that BETA tag" some shit like that. They lied
---
If you're not lying I'm going to commit suicide and blame Ubisoft in the note. Sensitive people turning 18+ games into club penguin needs to be stopped.
---
finally the holo is tacti-cool
---
Umm ok.
---
Tell him it isn't really social media in the way he thinks. Believe me, I'm the same way as him. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. don't really appeal to me so I don't use them, I use reddit as a source of news, discussion, or really anything else for the stuff that I'm interested in.
---
first half of year 4 so possibly mid season but most likely season 2
---
Yeah I don't know why no one really seems to like Nomad.
---
My friend and I played a lot and he never got TKed but he did get voted to kick once 
---
I've always said Hibana looks like a man. 
---
What you love so much about her?
---
Why does everyone get mad when they add an op that just has more muscle than usual lmao
---
Not the model,but the fidelity my dude lol
---
Now they should do the same for IQ's SIG SG 552 and Twitch's H&amp;K 417
---
Delete the game already kid
---
What about Cav? She is stealth and most of the time not face to face, at least in my experience 
---
Suck a wiener
---
So M249 = M249 SAW?
---
Well, all's well that ends well.
---
Glhf, mate.
---
I'm sorry but group bullying is not okay. I'm all for freedom of speech but mob mentality is dangerous and needs to be culled. The fact that 2-4 people can enjoy ruining my experience when they are supposed to be improving it and not see any form of punishment is a major problem. I haven't need to team kill since white noise because I normally only play with a stack and most players aren't that toxic on PC when they are on your team.
---
M249 SAW. Squad Automatic Weapon. I‚Äôve fired one. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. Along with the bigger cousin the M240B and the Daddy the Ma Deuce the .50 cal
---
Idk the why one has it and one doesn't but it stands for Squad Automatic Weapon
---
Right....
---
Ok, time to read.
---
This is the only game I'm having this issue with, and it started just this season. If you're having it with every game, make sure the game resolution and refresh rate match the system settings. 
---
not everyone is as rich as you
---
Some skins became available a week or so after the season start, so give it a bit.
---
It took me all of one game to shout ‚Äúshoot the fat bitch‚Äù
---
Well I haven't been able to come online myself, so I can't comment.
---
Maybe I'll try it this weekend and see whether it is stiff or not.
---
Then why don‚Äôt you just wait until you know the map?
---
It not even about the winning.. i sure the fuy just want to survived the match and try to get a kill without OP being a dick.
---
The likely hood of that happening 15 times is very low
---
my friend cries in 50
---
i know your pain. i really want a ps4 with 1 TB but when i bought mine those didn't excist yet
---
Then just f ing wait until you know the map
---
DDos is unfortunately a thing for some time now, but hard to tell if it was the case here.
---
It was only 35.7 GB on Steam
---
Probably a side effect of a change they wanted to make, and they don't care to fix it because they think 99% of their playerbase won't care enough to hurt their bottom line.  
---
In a game where you can spend minutes on end watching other people play, in between random wait times for matches thanks to using matchmaking and the ridiculous number of loading screens &amp; laggy interface, this is a big deal.  
---
And she is a 2 speed.... 
---
What is this, a post for ants?
---
Wow you really put a lot of effort and thought into this post
---
I thought this was already patched tho?

It doesn‚Äôt deserve to touch Hibana.

Happened to me as well, I restarted steam and had to download the uncompressed version. Those were the two hours where all my friend went to bed :(
---
I tried to reinstall the game and install again but it didnt work, tried again today but cant check if it works, did you find any solution ?
---
I downloaded it on Australian internet, then it hung, didn't install, I exited steam and now it wants to make me download all the files again (55 gig) wtf
---
Out of the classic roster, Smoke for defense and Sledge for attack. Smoke‚Äôs special are Zyklon-B gas canisters which you throw at enemies, so there you can apply your yeet physics. Sledge breaks shit with his hammer and he has grenades. If you don‚Äôt want to aim, pick shotgun on both Ops, SAS shotgun is pretty good.

yea, I couldn't tell. I posted here to ask because I've never not been able to reconnect

Wait I have the volcanic skin though.....do you have to buy the pass to get it? Because if so I may have already boughten the pass and am just stupidüòÖ

Heres the error that i found, its the only one that says error on the disc
---
And a reconnect button, because to my surprise half of leaving is caused by bad connection in which the user has no way to reconnect back. Honestly, this is just weird.
---
Get a Mute jammer IRL boi
---
Nope, matchmaking right now, which platform are you playing on? 
---
Ubi do not patch this!!!!
---
It's not a problem, look at the bright side you have TWO new operators and a lots of useless skins XD.
---
deploying 1 yokai is basically too much for a nerf....
---
I look at your flair and I think I know which one is next.
---
Its pegi 18 in my country 
---
She looked asian before... jesus some people here have a narrow view of what asian people look like. 
---
Which one
---
The new map is great, and fairly easy to learn compared to past maps. I‚Äôm curious what starts people will come up with for Gridlock because I haven‚Äôt seen her utilized. Mozzie on the other hand, is a huge help for his team. I can see them reducing his gadget to 2 tho in the future. 
---
first learn how to spell there's then you can complain
---
I meant reworks in general
---
just dont push sjws in this community...wait theyre already here....

I agree, season 1-2 charms are my favorite

cav only downs people with her knife when she's in stealth mode
---
Don‚Äôt over sip it that it becomes yucky mush, quick one second sip and down the hatch 
---
sec trying it out
---
PLEASE don't let ubi patch this. It's way too good
---
You don‚Äôt see the strat, having ying by herself is already powerful enough, imagine a whole team rushing with stuns and having no effect by those stuns

bruh in China I've had a steady pace of 2 bytes per second.

These have no style

üî•üî•üî•

Nah, in America you gotta use your middle finger for each eye individually.
---
It's one of the worst rifles stat wise ingame. 
---
Legit my circle of online gaming friends are all huge fans of The Punisher including me and when we had all watched season 2 we logged on and played in honor that Frank is back. 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I‚Äôm a Aussie myself, haven‚Äôt even played him yet but just know I‚Äôm gonna be a Mozzie Main! üòÅ
---
Also, I‚Äôve already made Mozzie, gonna go backwards with Clash &amp; Mav Next üòÅ
---
Stat wise, but imo stats in rainbow are bullshit, it depends on personal feel imo
---
In primary school we would play Gang-up (Tag but anyone tagged joins the tagger), so people would run around, and if they saw someone they knew, they would hold up the peace sign (knuckles facing the person).
---
Needless to say our British friend was a little confused when someone was looking at him, telling him to fuck off in the middle of a game.
---
We come from a land of bad internet
---
probably only on normal classic th arnt there special thingies 
---
I got that message dated today as well but no 600 credit pack.
---
Good to see usual Ubi QC at work.
---
Well its not that anyone has to look like an actress but real world ctus require their forces to be propperly trained. Gridlock would never be accepted. The last sliver of realism really got thrown out with this season. I just feel she is that way for the sake of being different. I would be completely fine with a strong woman but gridlock is just obese
---
On PC, yeah makes you more accurate. 
---
On console? Ehhhh, you‚Äôre better with higher. The inability to shift targets with low sense makes it hell
---
Are you having same issues as me? Or are you sweet?
---
Awe man then I‚Äôm sad. I didn‚Äôt get them either.
---
The fact we did not see her naked, go through a physical test or even get a medical file about her means that all this "she ain't fit" banter more speculative than factual
---
PLEAS LEARN TO SCREENSHOT ! 
---
Lol no shit it‚Äôs for newcomersüòÇ or just make a smurf. Or there‚Äôs this thing called custom matches.
---
Obviously just allowing veteran players into the newbie queue is not an option but it would be good if it queued you into the normal pool but only limited to those maps when you have a party member who is new.
---
Yeah i am. Currently on phone with Ubisoft.
---
Because having high level teammates would ruin the experience for new players and elongate the process.
---
I guess the point is for them to try putting batteries on castle barricades for a couple months without any toxicity from teammates or quickly getting rolled over by level 300s and learning nothing.
---
When I first started it wasn't very competitive for me, I rarely had an even or positive K/D below level 30/40, especially as I was new to mouse and keyboard. Would have been nice to have somewhere more accessible until I could catch up with the skill level.
---
No it wasn't. 
---
No memes allowed 
---
I started in black ice and just bumbled around in casual for that season üò´ didn‚Äôt even get a charm 
---
Thanks for that, do you happen to know who to contact with problems like this?
---
Yacht is the worst ma0 in the game, right after new Hereford 
---
That‚Äôs depressing
---
Bro I feel like Ubisoft is sponsored by UnderArmor with all the accessories they have.
---
No opinions aloud sorry only mine
---
Odd, I'm not on Steam tho, pure Ubi launcher... I was like "Uhm... I thought I was download a R6 patch and not the Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC" ;)
---
I disagree, being able to play with friends means you have people to give you advice while you play rather than forming the kinds of bad habits you mentioned.
---
They have provided ingame sources for both her height and weight. That coupled with just looking at her model screams nothing more but blatand pandering to modern ideas of ¬´variety¬ª
---
I will be the first one to defend the Hibana and Cav model update, but it seems like some of the skins did get kinda tweaked in maybe a not so great way. This one, obviously, and Hibana's PL skin also looks a bit off and greasy haired. I can't comment on Cav's PL since I don't own it. Additionally, I don't know if anyone else noticed but Capitao's hair is kinda weird around the ears, and both Hibana and Cav look a bit too passive in their expression. [/opinion]

My god, this is like the ugliest thing in existence.
---
they changed what's default, you can change it back
---
Let us know how you go
---
Lol gotta get some friends on your team
---
It took a couple of hours or so for me to get my Bikini one, if you've already got it linked then it's probably just a waiting game now lol
---
I have it too, it's annoying as shit. The worst part is it gives you wallhacks (through floors especially.)
---
Height is fine, can't read too much into that, I'll give you that
---
But weight and looks still mean nothing in this discussion, she's (a) wearing clothes and gear and (b) we do not have a medical or physical test here so it's just your speculation
---
I hate liberal bullshit myself but I know not to get down to their level and start looking for stuff where they don't exist 
---
I agree that this and a couple other skins haven't been translated over in a great way, but as noted they're going to be working on it.
---

Nah, its not complaining about EA or circlejerking over the witcher 3 or old NES games.

Please confirm the bug here: https://r6fix.ubi.com/live-server/LIVE-8977-game_freezes_on_joining_to_session/

Ohh so this is why i felt weird .. hmm
---
There should be an option to link accounts so that a new account can be linked to your main account as a sub account or something and it balances out the MMR.
---
Level 247 and you‚Äôre in Copper? 
---
I said that to them. My friend and I watched the match live and I  am a SSG fan for two years(friends make fun of me). I was so happy to play with them learned a new echo strategy.
---
dont solo queue, ever
---
Oh, now it turned in to 77.7GB download.
---
It seems like her hitbox travels before her model does. I've died so many times to gridlock yesterday, where I couldn't even see a pixel, yet in the replay she's been eyeing me for a good second. All of the times she was leaning.
---
Rampy and Chala play for Space Station Gaming
---
Who gives a fuck? They got the win anyway 
---
Casual MMR resets each season. Just play some more.
---
You¬¥re doing a great Job! We want MORE!  :)
---
Some people are just like that pal, they also don‚Äôt know how to use sarcasm lmao.
---
This bug has been in the game since grim sky? Hoping ubi would fix the game someday. Truly the best fps, but plagued by game breaking bugs since launch. And it seems that it's never going to get fixed.
---
gday mate
---
My sound sounds like I am on an aircraft and need to pop my ears. Really compressed.

Same here. And then kickec because connection is too slow. Yea. Maybe with servers on Azeroth.

Ayyyyyy, cheers! üòÅ
---
Hiding the words isn't really the point though, the point is to combat toxicity.
---
Is it an end-all fix to toxicity? No of course not, and if you know one then I'd love to hear it. But it at least makes people think two or three times about what they're saying.
---
I don't care that the sentence "your mother is a **** **** and you should **** yourself" doesn't have "bad words" in it, I just don't want to see that type of talk in a freaking video game.
---
No need to fix. Its already perfect
---
She‚Äôs feeling Japanese, I really think so
---
Why did you not use the proper screenshot fuction? thats the real question

Tbh I have respect for Pengu though because he understands shit

Its always bugged me how little Monty weighs in comparison to his size (90KG)

Almost as good as shark nipples

Start of every season

Let me guess. Youre one of those trashcans with 1 assist after the game that gets carried every match. 
---
Don't forget the whole subreddit had a meltdown and was getting people not to play the game at all because they were removing environmental skulls and blood. 
---
People care way too much about cosmetics.
---
Welcome to knowing about 99% of the people who play Siege are dumbass nine year old cunts that even when you've done nothing wrong and they got themselves killed they'll kick you.  Also the only good kick is for afkers if thats how you say it.
---
Fucking got me there

If your thinking there was a delay in me replying to this commet, it was actually just how long it took to reach your part of the world.

Ping

Already happened to me 2 times last season
---
I got a gold charm... just to see that the copper is so much better...
---
Just. Use. Mira. Or. Smoke. For. Rotations. Don't. Equip. Fucking. Pistols.
---
That must be the third time I said it already, if you have a team you make the rotations with the operators that can equip shotguns AND SMGs/MPs/ARs/Whatevers and you use you OHK headshot weapon. 
---
May I ask how did you manage to find a two month old post comment on it,
---
you do. it's in the config file, but it still exists. alternatively you can just turn Vsync on and it'll do that for you. 
---
That‚Äôs so annoyinggg
---
They won't revert the face because the elite is a lot valueable than a skin that isn't even on sale now
---
Never experienced it like this, last season I began from day 1 reached plat 3 after placement matches with ease, now i'm silver 3 because everyone is leaving or tk'ing
---
I think this is why people generally use the term TK
---
I had a glitch as Blitz where when I went into camera view, the gun was sticking to the phone.
---
I mean maybe dude, but I think we have to look at what's more likely here. Is it more likely that Ubisoft modeled her after an obscure aboriginal group of people, and then didn't mention it in any official promos or character notes (that we can find)? Or that the siege modeling team just doesn't know how to design a japanese character, and happened upon this look coincidentally.   
---
Downloading the update used all of their shitty NBN plans.

Blyat = bitch right? You are allowed to say bitch, but you aren‚Äôt allowed to say cyka for some reason.

Oh god i hate that challenge. I miss playing rounds as the birthday op
---
If you feel like toxic online interactions are a good indicator of what life is like then I feel sorry for your life.
---
I've never had a stranger walk up to me and tell me to kill myself. Ever. That only happens online and it only happens because toxic people like to hide their own identity and anothers humanity behind the wall of a computer screen.
---
The majority of people online simply is not at a level of maturity that they can handle unsupervised anonymous interaction. You're basically a bunch of small children trying to argue with their parents about how the cookie jar should be on the bottom shelf when you've spent years showing them that you're not responsible enough for unrestricted access.

They do but you can't buy them with renown which is a bummer

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros

Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.

Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

How about ability to oupt out from filter?

You **** the "bad words" and give a setting to remove filter for people that don't mind them. Snowflakes don't get triggered and mates can still bollocking each other.

You must be an angel that has fallen to help me

Do you really want to buy the uniforms for all operators though?
---
What about the hostage
---
To fuckin' shoot them
---
How many times is this going to get posted?
---
Who needs gloves when you got manly coarse hands from lifting weights and beers all day!
---
seems western europe is big on plagues 
---
Under Armour shoes have been an important part of Japanese culture for generations.
---
I know, I said in game chat that if someone wants the new operators to just tell me and I would let them use them instead of having to deal with childish team kills and kicks.
---
It happened to me. I'm from SA and played with 140 ping with people from NA.
---
Right now I've been waiting over 5 minutes to join a match
---
yes, seasonal skins are universal
---
Zofia with red dot? ü§¢
---
They said they were doing events every season and there were some uniforms and skins leaked that people think will be in packs but hopefully not 
---
Soon? It's already in the challenges!
---
I really can't think of a single instance in which profanity would detract from my gaming experience. 
---
when he tracks them he starts pinging his location to both teams lol
---
Yes all seasonal skins are universal

Thanks it‚Äôs my new favorite skin

Too many people with feelings hurt over words around the place to allow that it seems.

Thankyou

Hell yeah I'm taller than half the rainbow crew and both of my mains
---
I think the main stairs should have some kind of cover so you don't get shot in the head as soon as you crouch walk your ass up them
---
I hope kids like The\_EdgeOG will get banned from this community. 
---
Same it actually took me a second to find it
---
It's really not as bad as you are making it out to be. It's a pretty viable spot for both teams. Holding or taking control of tractor is huge
---
Why does she look like shes from the movie 9
---
Check your actual display frequency (should be something like 60.052 or 59.97, it‚Äôs never just 60) and cap your fps with RTSS by a number 0.01 lower than your frequency. Then turn 1 frame vsync ingame. The input lag will be very low, almost unnoticeable, compared to just vsync without fps cap. It‚Äôs a commonly known method courtesy of blurbusters.com
---
Honestly thought that was the point of the post at first lol.
---
__He's married with a pregnant wife so he must be doing something right.__
---
I definelty know that because the siege community isn‚Äôt not dumb but every community has one part of it xD
---
Yea that was annoying, first ranked match of the season on a map where I am constantly lost :/
---
Omfg that‚Äôs garbage üòÇ I was in casual, even won one of the rounds for us 1 against 3. Was in the middle of killing Kapkan when he voted to kick me. He then immediately team killed me while we were defending the next round, and his buddy killed my friend I was playing with. 
---
Jokes on him though, my buddy was blitz and I was fuze with his ballistic shield the round after. As soon as we got in we lit both of them the fuck up and then left. 
---
G36C has never been a bad Gun it's just that the R4C is picked 90% of the time so they removed her acog so they would have a more even pickrate
---
Maybe not all, but if they were to add them all maybe like a playlist for the maps . because I can't see them adding in all classic maps into regular playlists.
---
The download actually finished in a reasonable time, I think there is something with the installation speed that made my timer wig out. 
---
You said 
---
&gt;Clash is useless they would be useless too
---
Stating monty and blitz would be useless without their pistols. This is just objectively wrong. Monty and Blitz are often played without use of their pistols. This would just give a new dynamic to their gameplay.
---
Who are going to play now that Ash doesn‚Äôt have acog anymore?
---
Jackals helmet, finka‚Äôs adrenaline. blakcbeards shield twitch drone, bucks skeleton, must be added.
---
The first storm trooper to hit his target
---
Understandable
---
Oof that‚Äôs rough. Been there 
---
I'm always a bit peeved at the start of seasons because I have the season pass. I don't mind when people beat me to choosing the new Ops, but some people lose their minds. They'll leave games, TK you, destroy whatever utility you deploy, etc. 
---
It's like playing with a bunch of 8 year olds lmao
---
the funny thing is that it used to be like that but this sub raged about it until they put them in instantly :') 
---
That head though 
---
the second thing i've been having also, i thought it was just me for some reason!   
---
Also, i'm not sure about where on outback it is, but my drone fell through the map as we spawned yesterday.
---
Thanks. That's above our monthly internet limit but i guess i can split it into 2 months

I‚Äôm kind of puzzled with seasonal skins, especially with the Lava skin. They said it‚Äôs only for guns that are there when you get it but I‚Äôm able to put it on Mozzie‚Äôs and Gridlock‚Äôs guns as well.
---
I love this banter. Two British citizens cannot even agree on the level of offensiveness when using the middle finger or two fingers and the whole country is smaller than the state of Michigan. Well then again I can't even agree with my neighbor about where we stick our snow piles in the streets of Boston.  My snow pile argument also probably causes more fist fights than the finger argument. &lt;3
---
Yes, give a stationary operator a speed advantage

It's on Frost's beanie too

All I‚Äôm saying is I prefer more grounded in reality stuff. And that just because it‚Äôs using less of the color palette doesn‚Äôt mean it is a dead end.

absolutely
---
People spend money on lots of things. Doesn't mean they can or are fixed immediately

And Ash‚Äôs hit box.

the problem with the g8 is that it has a super slow swap speed, which is like the exact opposite of what you want with iq.

I feel that, I was team killed after winning a 1 v 4

thats even bet... hold on. Not the lord. Come on guys

You can shoot at the top of a shields head if they are crouching

Ubi says he won‚Äôt stay a stationary operator or else he will just be completely useless

---
How so? They wouldn't be able to use the smg while the shield was out it would be primarily for information gathering, or rushing with Blitz. The SMG would just allow for them to frag regulary if they place they shield on their back, like clash. Clash isn't OP.
---
Happened to me last season and that‚Äôs how the whole season went. You can‚Äôt carry four teammates. 
---
I would personally rate the seasons as follows 1. Parabellum 2. Chimera (outbreak was just fun for me) 3. Grim sky 4. Windbastion and the reason WB is last is because appart from nomad kaid and the new map it prrtty much felt like grim sky agian
---
As a 145lb 5'6" dude I think he's my spirit animal
---
Yeh it‚Äôs definelty annoying but I guess from a logic POV he doesn‚Äôt have the pockets for them and from a game POV that would give him to much power because he can reposition them 
---
Not a huge fan of the style, but thats my personal taste so...
---
UPVOTED!
---
Yeah, and it‚Äôs only year 4 and you still can‚Äôt use your brain. They said during invitationals it wouldn‚Äôt be til later this year. 
---
She looked like Asian Noomi Rapace* 
---
Okay I was gonna apologize if it was because it would have been me and three friends that wanted to use it for Cav roams
---
Did that, still kinda noticeable. I've got other games where the in-game FPS cap doesn't produce tearing though. It would be nice if Siege could have it built-in too.
---
You get sad over my words
---
This is greatest!üòÇ
---
Dammit i buyed 200 renown cuz they are going to replace ubisoft coins
---
Yea she went from an edgy adult to an innocent 12 years old in her operator art
---
Par for the course. Last night playing casual was full of sweaty try hards yelling at their teammates if you didnt pick a certain operator or did anything they thought was "wrong"..its casual man, stop yelling and play the game. 
---
Same thing happens when it‚Äôs Room next to Vigil

I was playing as gridlock and was immune to Kapkan traps, I was walking past them and they weren't even going off.

Nope

i have the car in the garage a pp as Ela hehehe
---
IS THIS A MOTHERFUCKING JOJO REFRENCE
---
Okay was gonna say cause me and my three friends were rude and did that last night so we could drone for roomers all night.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect to like this because most things from new are usually dumb but this is actually an amazing idea. But I think 15 is a bit much. Maybe like 7
---
Fitting that Jager is an engineer huh...
---
*Propaganda starts to play*
---
Checked it myself, the 'original' one is correct, but they just copied it to the one you saw and thought no one would notice, but you sure as hell did.
---
That fucking icon looks insanely good!
---
No. I never said they'd be useless without their pistols. I said, they'd be useless if they had to take a good 2 secs to switch to a shiddy ass "machine pistol" (not an smg) while there's a defender holding an angle and aiming at them. This would never work. Thank god you aren't a dev or we'd have something worst than a fucking wallhack. God knows what
---
Why is everyone so damn short in this game?

Hello Chinfu1189, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aydgp3/blitz_nerfedbug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Shields are already inconsistent enough, I don't think they need a nerf
---
I think that was from the twitch prime drops
---
Each Gemstone Weapon Camo is 2.99 US but in the bundle you also get the Platinum Camo
---
And those shitty out of place under armor golf gloves. Give her an archers arm brace ffs
---
Colorblind here, I think I have a small disadvantage, made larger on maps with greens, reds, and browns such as outback or Kafe.
---
The trick is too not ping the roamers but track their footprint direction
---
Oh, thanks ;)
---
I was playing the discovery playlist (Outback only)... and I'm from SBR (south america) and somehow I was playing with some guys from New York... After some games I was put in a match full of brazilians with my normal ping
---
What can i get for 1200 credits without pitching in extra
---
Howdy sarge
---
I used to get 140-165 FPS prior to this update. Turning down shading quality brought me back up to 130-150 from 110-140, but it still feels way more stuttery than before.
---
With BB, Clash, Castle and the French, I have to agree. As we say, ‚Äúeven a stick might shoot once a year.‚Äù
---
J√§ger has a freaking pilot helmet on his head. Rainbow are not first-responders, so the germans have no justification to wear tracksuits and hoodies. Thermite wears wielder googles and no protective handwear apart from some arm wraps.
---
Ever looked at the Russians? Capitao being allowed in combat? Ela? Ying and Lesion have the same issue as GSG-9. 
---
Many operators lack any type of face concealment headwear (Ash, Pulse, Buck, Valkyrie, Capitao, Hibana, SDU, GROM, Dokkaebi etc), while Kaid doesn‚Äôt have protective gear (vest under the jacket, maybe?).
---
‚ÄúUnrealistic and cartoony‚Äù is definitely an exaggeration from I said. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that you shouldn‚Äôt worry when the game steps back from being realistic, as those deviations happened before and are a part of design philosophy. 
---
It makes me happy to see somebody creating great content for one of my favorite communities, let alone being so active and responding to every comment. You deserve every bit of love that comes your way!
---
I swear yesterday I was getting some weird shit. Normally netcode and server delay is manageable, but yesterday I was getting shot a good 2 seconds after I had already went around the corner. 
---
Bleh...I'm still bothered by Gridlock being a heifer.
---
I was hoping for "Oh god, my fucking knee! That's my kneee! Aaaaagh" Wilhelm is also an excellent choice, too. 
---
I like the Y3 charms, I‚Äôd use them for their op unless I had a better op-related charm (elite or normal chibi, event pack etc.). I like the idea of a skin better but honestly this one, which I assume all others will look like with a different color and own op logo, looks kinda ugly. Still gonna get it tho. 
---
Yeah, I used the term soccer whore to describe caviera once and it got baleeted
---
Hell no.
---
Does using three fingers make it more offensive?
---
Clearance level above 30? I thought it was 20
---
So no wonder they had a larger angle on you than you did on them.
---
Exactly, that as well, like they see me before I see them. I‚Äôm dead the second I look at them 
---
Almost as good as deer eyes on Villa
---
Is it good that I get this reference
---
@ubi_Noty
---
It will. There is literally no reason it wouldn‚Äôt. 
---
To be honest, I don't. I want more realistic skins, I don't like the goofy ones. I hate the clown skins and the Halloween skins 
---
I think he is fine rn... Between the DMR shotgun and his ability to run impacts or barbed wire, he is in a good spot. 
---
Only the greatest r6 meme ever

I don't care so much about the genders. I just care about her looking like a fat tranny.
---
Snowflake
---
Instead of having people who anchor as cav, u should replace it with people who anchor as rook
---
I‚Äôm all about the commando reload animation. I find myself walking around during prep phase just one tapping random breakables just to watch myself reload. That‚Äôs why I try not to pick Mozzie too much. Let everyone else have their turn lol

It really does.

Well that's a lie.

Because then only one player could progress the challenge in a match, and the other will tk or kick you.
---
I just think his aug needs acog. Then ill be happy with him
---
You can actually feel it... it's horrible
---
Thanks for the quick response guys. Really shows that you guys do listen.
---
Yep, to 'stop' the leaning abuse they moved the position of the camera, but didn't adjust the animation any, so all they did was fuck up your perspective so how half your head is around cover yet you can't see around that corner yet.
---
GG Ubi as usual.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand how that should affect my vision on his head. Just like irl, if he sees my head, I should be able to see is. Anything other than that is unbalanced. 
---
correct, for me i never use it, prefer reflex and acog
---
Cannot forget the silent step.
---
Kaid is fine as is.
---
The ACOG severely throws me off if I have to aim down sights suddenly, it takes me a second to realize where I'm aiming now. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you had to buy the season pass before March 4 to get the lava skin
---
Halo 2 or 3 had it.  There is no technical or feasibility reason why a game can't have it today.
---
Cool any possibility of Mozzie &amp; Gridlock getting the damascus steel and obsidian skins? Its strange how they don't have them.
---
This was funnier in Snedgers video
---
Frost has an underarmour hat
---
So tough he doesn't need a magazine in his gun. If he just points it in your general direction you die from a head shot out of sheer fear.
---
NBA Street/R6 Siege Crossover?!?
---
Spooky, just like the headgear
---
But seriously, thanks for resolving this quickly and for having great communication with us
---
Insert joke about moxie being short
---
Check Frost‚Äôs hat and hibana‚Äôs glove. They are all under Armour
---
I do not envy your responsibility of having to answer to the countless cries of entitled children who berate your entire team over the slightest imperfection.
---
I have the same issue stuttering and frame drops lags i dont know what is happen, before the update  i get 100 - 120 fps when playing and now i get frame drops to 65- 77... when i do alt - tab take like 10 seconds to switch also-__- !!! 
---
So kapkan and fuze had a gay love child?
---
&gt;I still don‚Äôt understand how that should affect my vision on his head.
---
You see in cones. His cone is wider, sees more of you. Your cone is cut off by your proximity to the doorway, you see less.
---
&gt; Just like irl, if he sees my head, I should be able to see his.
---
Doesn't always work like that.
---
&gt;Anything other than that is unbalanced.
---
No.
---
That isn‚Äôt a problem? Are you retarded? And see you jealous of my season 4 pass or something? The camp is actually dope and the OPs are dope also lmao. Not to mention I get 6 more ops for free
---
First time I used her. Started laughing. Oh this is not going to last.
---
They will either reduce the area of the trap or limit it to one instead of the now three.
---
But then again, why? It would both be unnecessaey and unrealistic for someone to carry an smg and a shield but you're the fucking expert lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
just have a tachanka turret mounted to an indestructible shield ball that rolls around; ggez
---
Yeah I get what you mean although I personally quite like some of the Halloween skins, more specifically Buck and Thermites because they had the darker colour schemes
---
Same here
---
He's still as good as he ever was. The damage changes do basically nothing to him.
---
I‚Äôm a new soul I came to this strange world 
---
I‚Äôll see my way out now
---
Wait thats illegal
---
I love that this thread is filled with people complaining about the chat being "kid friendly" while also complaining that they can't act like edgy kids.

I haven't experienced that recently

Ubi went for a more ‚ÄúSteve Irwin‚Äù approach to the Australian language

1 toxic people not just on ps4

Capit√£o looks like he put a bunch of baby powder on his face

---
black ice
---
ADS. My gun was wrapped is the barbed wire
---
obviously you dont play anything on xbl
---
It literally cost me two games because of it
---
No, it's not that problem
---
Even i can't use Steam Overlay too
---
He should be used for intel not to kill then enemies with his gadget 
---
I used to think that but I recently switched to the holo and It‚Äôs now my new favorite non-acog 
---
I don't know that guy
---
I believe Season Pass weapon skins are only intended to be for the Operators for that release year and prior, so they don't extend to new weapons released after that year is complete.
---
Not having any troubles so far. My brother and I share this game he was having some problems related to installation progress but that‚Äôs it. 
---
I've played solo for most of my 400 hours and I encounter shit like this all the time.  I've also spent matches getting continually TK'd because I sound like a woman.  This is the reality of Siege's community, not a fluke.
---
I've got 48gb on Steam without textures.
---
I like the terminator eye, good touch
---
the ‚Äúmy leg‚Äù guy from Spongebob will also do great imo
---
Damascus Steel was the Year 3 skin, so that's why Year 4 operators don't have them.
---
They‚Äôve made quite a few changes to the stances of ops with different guns
---
u/hyperRL 
---
üòÖ
---
Damascus Steel isn't supposed to be available for ops after year 3.
---
He's 2cm smaller than me xD
---
Midget!!!!
---
Okay I'll try
---
Big Chungus
---
Do you play in borderless or windowed?
---
I‚Äôm thinking Doc and Fuze should have one too. Pistol that can be used to shoot your teammates and yourself with fuze grenades. 
---
I know but I still think that the time increase to take damage was unnecessary
---
Haxer! he wasn't even looking at you!
---
I cannot verbally describe how confused i am right now
---
It means you have a really high iq
---
Big Chungus Kaid!
---
I think I even remember them changing the ad's out on the maps every once and a while.
---
Tf did he say?
---
Voiced by estaban from Zack and Cody and his only line is...
---
"THEES EES.... DISATAAAA" 
---
Lol goobi, Ima have to use that one 
---
Why this matters is because it's not consistent, say I specifically place my claymore on a red background because I have it set to red. Someone without color blindness has it turned to blue and now easily slots it. 
---
Even for a normal vision person, a lot of the surfaces are brown ish wooden floors. Red is always less visible on those than blue would be. 
---
i did not use copy stamp at all.
---
no, it's not. But its how it is for now.
---
bro it was so freaking epic.. the fat joke....
---
taba pensando isso mesmo cara, o ping e do server US 
---
Big Ronda
---
So how‚Äôd that guy get 2 kills back to back and not get kicked?
---
Ill be Down
---
Flair this "misleading title"
---
Son of a gun. You‚Äôre a genius. It worked and now I can use the new ops. Thanks a ton
---
Another post with an necessary suggestion for UBI to waste their time on.
---
Me too. Sadly i regret it now.
---
Worse damage
---
i tried it and i get the same fps but with input delay..:/
---
Alright, one guy explained the scheme for me.  
---
  
---
1. People are actively deranking their second accounts to copper 4.  
---
2. After which they play 4 second accounts with 1 uncalibrated main account.  
---
3. For some reason the guy calibrates at diamond.  
---
4. Repeat for everyone in a group.  
---
This issue needs to be dealt ASAP. It's the most likely reason for me to drop the game completely, sadly after spending money on it.
---
Flamingo
---
I'm okay. 3-0 so far. 
---
but thanks man im just gonna live with that
---
Man I have been getting into matches with constant diamonds and plats. Listen to this man the first week sucks for ranked

What's up with it?
---
Huge screen profile (covers a lot of the screen and your peripheral vision) for little gain.
---
Both Holo and Reflex are 1x zooms with far less visual obstruction.
---
Some weapons feel inexplicably better with on though I will admit. 
---
4 stacks really shouldn't have this much power (of course, it COULD be that they aren't a 4 stack, but sure does look like it)
---
Honestly, if you are 3 or 4, you shouldn't be able to even initiate a kick, so the solo players have to if one of them are toxic.

You can, it‚Äôs on the main menu

Give us the Charm and the Skin, and make it 30 drones.

Save up to 180k and buy 50 packs. They are cheaper per pack that way. I usually get 3-4 black ice and 1-3 legendaries.

---
Cav "main"..I say this quite a lot, but for different reasons..I just want my interrogation :(
---
This one?
---
What‚Äôs it mean?
---
True, especially considering that there are different divisions working on different things (ie a level design sector working on a new map while the model design team makes new operators). Well within their capability to have changed this, especially 4 years into the game
---
who‚Äôs idea was it to bring out this challenge literally a day after releasing mozzie 
---
Chat filters that reject messages for certain words are extremely pointless. If someone really wants to say a filtered word, they'll find a way to say it. Chat filters are not hard to bypass at all. The only thing it does is limit what the normal users can say because some normal words or usernames sometimes happen to have characters aligned in a way that triggers the filter. Just make certain words reportable if they *really* don't want them said (like the n word), or make a soft filter that ****'s them out and can be turned off, but hard filtering chat doesn't stop the bad 1%, it only inhibits and annoys the good 99%.
---
You only get 50 packs for 180? 
---
let's be honest half the weights are arbitrary as shit anyways. Except for gridlock's her weight seems intentional.
---
Legally yes but you can also pirate the software. Also you didn't hear this from me 
---
They do the same damage unless they changed it since release. Lesion's version is a straight upgrade over Ying's.
---
Yes. I noticed the same behavior. It seems almost like the "jiggle" that the shields encounter when they're shot seems to be causing a clipping situation. I had a couple of games where I'm staring right at Lesion, ironically, and he's just dumping bullets into my shield. I'm moving in a straight line toward him and then I'm dead.
---
Word
---
They're just both Asian lmao
---
I‚Äòm sorry for you :-( but np, i help where i can
---
I don‚Äôt know what it was, but when I got on steam it said it was 35GBs. I downloaded it and at the end of the install phase it crashed. Then restarted the download, but it was 54GBs instead of the original 35. It‚Äôs so weird 
---
Looks like a weight
---
I have the same problem. My mouse is a deathadder chrome. I have no problems in other games though so I don't think that's my mouse fault. I'm going to switch to za 13 in about a month anyway so I'll try to update my situation here.
---
You should be able to mount a tachanka current on the back of clash and ride her around like an unstoppable horse.
---
Honestly should votekick even be a thing anymore???
---
I see it get abused way more than I see it being used in a helpful way (afk teammate, 1 toxic teammate that teamkills at start of the round)

Does this community even deserve to have this feature?

NOT MY HIBANA CHANGE HER BACK
---
I think this is rascist but it‚Äôs funny
---
You can't just be realising that now. R6 has one of the most ridiculously childish playerbases in gaming. I see a TK nearly every other match....
---
Paris Eiffel Tower map confirmed? 
---
It's really too bad this is such garbage. I might have actually paid for Hibana elite if it was any good. Guess I'll start maining someone else
---
They do the same damage

I just thought it was funny that she‚Äôs Korean with the same glasses as Dokkaebi and after showing her she agreed
---
OP even reversed the image for easier viewing, what a guy. 
---
Nope.
---
He needs an Aug buff. Not utility buff.
---
Should I buy mozzie, I need a good 2,2 defense main with a nitro, good guns and a good gadget, I don't get money too often so I need to know if it is werf
---
blitz, buck,  sledge, hibana also of the top of my head. pretty sure there were more tho 
---
Why Korean Batman gotta be so short 
---
He‚Äôs standing far away to look tall lol
---
Ah ok. I haven't checked, but I didn't realize it was labeled AR in game
---
Not OP at all. She‚Äôs good, but I‚Äôve yet to see anything that makes her seem too strong.
---
Missed the post, did ya?
---
It's coming season 2.
---
I think Xbox needs to try and see if they can disable converters or something because it's outta hand
---
True, but if everyone can enable it then players with regular vision can also set it to blue and see it easier on a red background and vice versa
---
No, in real life it doesn‚Äôt work that way, and imagine a smg 11 shield

his actual height is 5"4

I use the red dot on everything I don't use an ACOG on.  If I could have a single red dot as the ACOG reticle I'd use that, too.  I don't need the uncertainty of the reflex, or the clutter of the holo, I only need a single dot to see where I'm aiming.  I don't care what everyone else thinks, it works for me and that's all I care about.

Have to try it. Just 2 more days!

Red dot reticle is better than the reflex reticle though. It's a trade-off.

Or 25 for 100 k

But it would be abused, because then everyone would play in it, and not the normal colors if it changed lasers, drone light colors, etc.

"Press R to Reload"
---
Yeah, I heard about that from a Forgotten Weapons video.
---
I prefer the sound of that, haha, thank you. 
---
I'm so confused....
---
Their loss, lol. I see no reason to get salty over getting kicked. You're just going to degrade yourself getting stressed out over it.
---
what‚Äôs it mean tho. 
---
Played all day. Surprisingly nobody TK'd. Luck of the draw.  Some other people were commenting on how they're shocked nobody's TK'ing.  There was toxic trashtalkers though just cursing at me unprovoked.  muted him.  
---
Normally though, every time i start a casual match, and then begin to prep a wall, it's pins and needles. just waiting to get shot in the back.  it's stressful.
---
Serious question, as I am not colorblind, what changes would you like to see?
---
Would just changing the HUD or reticle colors help, or would the whole game need new textures?
---
Not sure if this is meant to be a joke but echo is Japanese 
---
that's fair, but on xbox it happens pretty often, at least from my experience. xbox is notoriously toxic, however.
---
im on pc now, thank god

Mozzie: "calm down mate, it ain't worth it"

NOT MY HIBANA CHANGE HER BACK 
---
ok ty
---
And, as I say that. The game has me in a ranked game but won't let me join it. Great. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôll take some time, especially since the drone is highlighted the learning curve from ‚Äúthere it is‚Äù to ‚Äúok that ones cool to leave alive‚Äù will take a week or so probably. 
---
I just wish the little spider was still visible or when it hacks the drone it just falls off having used all its battery for the drone takeover. Or at least they could explain what happens to it, but it‚Äôs not needed 
---
I think it‚Äôs really nice tbh. not much of a hibana player though myself so it‚Äôs a pass

Ah ok

I guess my point is that it's not abuse if everyone can change it and use it. 
---
Lets say that I broke my wrist and can't write. If I have an essay assigned, with the option to type or handwrite it, if I choose to type it due to my broken wrist then I'm not abusing that option since everyone has that option and it's their perogative on whether or not to use it

There is "blyat" (–±–ª—è—Ç—å) and "blyad" (–±–ª—è–¥—å). Blyad' is a whore. Blyat is just curse word. Like, when you hit you finger with a hammer, you go "Blyat!", its like english "Fuck!".

That isn't the way I do it, I do it by ADS, Crouch, and then time the ctrl - which makes you dropshot.
---
It seemed like I was going out of my ads in the video, but it is because of the original patch that blocked dropshots completely -- if you time it well, you will not go out of your ads and do the old dropshot.

I‚Äôve had this same idea months ago as well, but the sad reality is if they removed it then what are you gonna do in those situations where you can actually use it as intended and kick a toxic person out of the game? The reality is it‚Äôs a double edged sword. 
---
Also at least this game allows you to kick somebody for being toxic. Other game like Overwatch and such don‚Äôt have such a feature and the people who play it are forced to endure the toxicity. If you really want to avoid being kicked by a toxic 4 stack, just play with at least one friend. If they are with you then majority can‚Äôt vote to kick you or your buddy out.  
---
When? Year 4 is already out.

Perfect and he can hack lions drone when lion dies but the drone turns into the pre nerf lion drone 
---
New textures aren't needed, simply changing the colors so that someone with colorblindness would be able to distinguish different colors on different items better would be great.
---
On the other hand: I have 700 hours of ONLY casual and can count on one hand the number of times I‚Äôve seen this occur.
---
The best part of casual? I can leave and find a new game in 30 seconds.
---
PC of course. I hear horror stories about console.

This isn‚Äôt feedback. This is pointless bitching. If you‚Äôre having issues with the update, post what they are. I for one got DC‚Äôd and was kicked straight to my dashboard. I‚Äôm not sure that ever happened before, maybe once, But other than that this patch has been great for me.

oh yeah haha that‚Äôs pretty obvious. The 0‚Äôs around the R6 confused me

Hello GAMERMORTAL_PS4, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ayfaks/ps4_r6_microphone_error/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Xbox?
---
I agred with some of it 
---
looks like the Skull Rain face paint texture is loder. The eyes black is more like a black eye.
---
 
---
XD No problem bud

that‚Äôs sick, thought the siege ones were made up

Leak for a future map? Maybe
---
I got ranked silver 2 because the last game I met 2 griefers who teamkilled and shot us every round.

they would brake him he is the lightest character with 57 kg lulz
---
Xbox banned my comms for a week because some chick was shit talking me in messages and when she revealed she was a girl I just said ‚Äúsorry I don‚Äôt speak whale‚Äù...in fucking Grand Theft Auto V, a game filled to the brim with offensive language and imagery. She didn‚Äôt say a word after I said that, so must‚Äôve been pretty spot on with that comment. And I made that whale statement with 0 basis on what she actually looks like because how tf would I know that. And I know a few girls irl who are thin as hell and game almost every day, who also found what I said hilarious. Fuckin pansies, her and Xbox

I would downvote you but your just the messenger so I can‚Äôt!!

Good things can come in slow or fast ways

Ahah ikr

So they planned it from the beginning that it will come y4s2? Thanks, i probably just misread it

who cares

I think the answer is yes?

Ya welcome my friend.

I mean... if you play casual, people don't mind, that doesn't happen in ranked unless it's copper..

No idea why some people are downvoting you. He pulls in an easy 25-30k in siege on average.

Decided that once I adjust to the new map, I'm only going to play ranked this season. Casual is not only bad as a mode but the people who play it are something else. 
---
Recommend others to do the same tbh. 
---
Idk man. Personally, I think the new face and new portrait are pretty significant downgrades. At least we don‚Äôt have to see it when we‚Äôre playing Hibana though.
---
Yeah she looks swollen or something. Doesn‚Äôt look good.

Lol, this patch is good, ops are fun and is great, fixes a lot of shit also.

mate it's an utter travesty of a map
---
Year 4 was already released
---
Some colorblindness correction applies to all graphics in games, so that claymore example would be just as difficult if that were the case. If they just color-corrected lasers, for example, you would be correct. But I don't think anyone does that for online games. You'd need to do a little digging yourself, but essentially the main 2 methods I see for correction are (at least for red-green, the most common which I have): enhanced HUDs in games that left the rest of the map normal (Ghost Recon Wildlands IIRC) so red enemies were just as hard to spot in the forest but just I could see their dot on the radar much easier, OR the entire color scheme is modified so that ALL red is modified to be pink (Anthem).
---
Still no ACOG though
---
 By teammate pings you mean yellow pings? With your type of color blindness I could see that being an issue, but you're the opposite of me, I can't see the red but I can see the yellow.  If it helps yellow pings are indicated on the minimap and their lack of transparency on the environment means you should be able to see them in a lot of instances during gameplay.  I think the same fix for you would work for me, which is adding a solid drop shadow/border around the ping (black or white depending on the surface of the ping).
---
Operators is the biggest problem.  A lot of the solutions that allow you and I to play at the same visibility level as everyone else, could and probably would give normal sighted players an advantage.  
---
I wouldn't think with your type of color blindness the reflex sight would cause much of an issue, it's red which is a color you can see.  I only have issues with it against a red or red tinted background since there's no transparency to it.  But I don't have your version of colorblindness so I don't really know.
---
Did you really make this account to bitch about this patch?
---
That‚Äôs pretty dope I wanna try to dnbo my entire team and we can be the anti interrogation squad
---
Apex is a battle royale, not even in the same category lol. 
---
I personally prefer Oregon, but Coastline is a close second.
---
Wow. So you‚Äôre like a new breed of dumb, aren‚Äôt you?
---
I would leave every time I got that map
---
Haha, no.
---
Bartlett U. was the worst map in the game, by far. 
---
I can't find the footage, but it's just two blackeyes on the shark in Outback
---
I feel like Macie is right on this one, just shoot a line of like 4 and you're good on the traps, and there are other gadgets that will make you make sound better than her. Probably the only appeal of the traps is that they cover sound well.
---
Same here 
---
I'm not talking about pc, I'm talking about console. M+k is a problem on console. PC u can use a fuckin powerglove and all that other shit. There is no way to counter that on PC because there is always some dipshit who makes some type of software. Xbox on the other hand needs to fix this. It needs to disable converters because this is getting out of hand.
---
But its not entirely fictional is it? It names real life SF units. If it was entirely fictional it wouldn't.
---
Its also based on Rainbow 6, which is a fictional book that is still authentic. I admit there are stretches of the game in the realism department but it can be unrealistic and still feel semi authentic.
---
This latest content is just a bit ridiculous. If i was Australian SF i would be pissed.
---
Don't you realinze you fighting over someones weight in a video game? 
---
LOL
---
The Point of the Beginner Rotation is for new players to learn a few of the maps that are also in ranked.
---
I totally agree on casual tho. I'd love to see Bartlett back
---
Kids are playing with you.

Seems so. Clearly people who cannot see past any issue that involves women or overweight people without being triggered.

---
Just don't see how it remotely has any effect on you, the game or your enjoyment of the game.
---
Both weps are good. You should switch them.
---
Peperoni is super great in short range . If you are going to lurk or even roam , use p-10 . Very good rpm and control also good holo.
---
However , 20 round magazine will slow you down , damage is meh .
---
Commando 9 is a better option if you are going to intel/anchor . Range and control is good , dont forget the AR damage and the cool-ass reload . You have a better firepower with it , but slow ads and rpm could be a problem in short range .
---
Pistol is great . Only use shotgun if you want to make peek-holes , shotgun is useless for hunting down attackers .
---
Haha! Was wheezing from start to finish!
---
My dad played it last night (he‚Äôs new) and said it was considerably different than Casual. He didn‚Äôt hit a smurf the entire night. Fingers crossed they have a way to detect smurfs and sort them out 
---
I'm not fighting, LOL. 
---
You are the one swearing and sounding all angry over someone commenting on a fat special forces woman in a video game.
---
I think it looks better this way and when I shoot the pellets in dark areas Its harder to see the pellets before you activate them

That‚Äôs just the default setting now. You are able to go into options and change it back to automatically if you wish.

Mouse and keyboard will also have a better aim over joysticks, they have a lot more control over the movements that you just don't get with joysticks. 
---
Did you think it was worth it last year?

Do you think you‚Äôre gonna keep playing the game?

It all depends on those questions pal

Commiting war crimes or being fat? Which is worse? You decide.

It‚Äôs pretty obvious you‚Äôre triggered by the presence of Gridlock or you wouldn‚Äôt have taken the time to post about it. Where everyone else seems to be whatever about it.

I smurf a lot but I don't know if its considered actual smurfing as my main is plat 1 and my smurf is gold1 to plat 3 every season. I do it so my friends (who are all high gold) and I can get a balanced average match rather than high plats or diamonds coming in our games.  I personally feel that doesn't ruin anyone's day as I never face low level players (low gold and below) and my kdr is not even high enough for me to be considered good and ruining other's experiences.
---
I kinda get that and have no problem with it - if you got banned for a reason, I understand it is frustrating if you got banned because you couldnt reconnect to a match but otherwise played "nicely", but I dont understand why they wouldnt let you play a single player mode offline
---
Please tell me you didn‚Äôt install reddit to post this piece of garbage

Hey Ubi,

Why does it have to have an "effect"? What i have to get sick for something to annoy me or something?
---
You want more and more ridiculous characters? I played the game since the beginning. When it was still somewhat authentic. It gets more ridiculous each year.

This DLC is particularly strange. If i was Australian i would be annoyed.

B...but maybe I look at her in-game and not anime fan-art

Colourblind mode can be tricky to implement properly because it might give a visibility advantage even for non-colourblind players, effectively forcing everyone to use the mode if they want to be competitive. E.g. the [PUBG blue blood saga](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXDprbXWAAERS5R.jpg).

On the adverse, Ive been vote kicked/tk‚Äôed by 4stacks for not picking recruit when they all did. I‚Äôm sure most of us have encountered  this too. I‚Äôm just saying we are 4 years in. Give the recruit a promotion and give him a 2nd reinforcement 
---
As someone who has played through every single DLC, having to live through OG Blackbeard and 2 week constant server crashes during Velvet Shell. I also have to say Chimera, shortly followed by White Noise. Chimera had broken ops that ruined the majority of the seasons enjoyment. While white noise has honestly the worse map to exist. People complained of spawn peeking. So let's make it all inside then so attackers will never know when they flank unless there's complete team communication. Wind bastion wasn't great either but I don't think it was because it was bad, just meh.

---
Ubisoft: Efficiency is just clever lazyness.
---
I have this challenge as well. 
---
Fair point.  But what I meant is if you go to the docter and say "it hurts" and don't say what, or where, or any context at all, the best doctor in the world can't fix you.
---
You don't need to tell the developers how to fix it, but if no one tells the developers I have problems seeing the yellow ping and Jackal's tracking and just says there needs to be a colorblind version.  No one will know what needs fixed, let alone how to fix it.
---
All I'm trying to  say is, if someone is colorblind, and says there are things I have difficulty with in game, but I expect the experts to not only know what those things are but how to fix them.  It's a bit of a big ask.
---
The pass is downloaded, cause I figured that was the issue too but everything is downloaded.
---

PC is so nice once you get your settings dialed in...
---
For three years, I played with about an 18" per 360 sensitivity (400dpi and 11% in Battlefield 1/4). Did okay-ish, 1.5-2.5kd games and a solid score per minute.
---
Then I discovered mouse acceleration. After a few months of tweaking, I've now hit a sweet spot where I can go nuts. Night before last I went 51-14 on Battlefield 3, and a few days before that was rocking 49-7 on Battlefield One. Concerning Battlefield games, I now average a 3kd+ as infantry. On the test server for R6, I'm usually first or second on the board. It's soooooooooooo noiiiiiice.
---
Guess I'm a rare breed. Mouse accel actually making someone better. Who'da thunk?
---
Israel is a controversial country in the political world. Ubisoft made Gridlock appear obese which can be political because it gives the false image that its normal and fine to be obese. Obesity kills more people in America than anything. I‚Äôm sure in Denmark it‚Äôs not as much of a problem but in America it is. Btw I want danish operators too :)

---
I wish Nomad wasn't in the game at all.
---
I thought it was just me!
---
Shit, you're right I got the reflex mixed up with the Holo.  I never use the reflex because I line it up wrong (not a vision problem, just and I'm not that bright problem) and aim with the center of the triangle.
---
Most of the time I see crouch spammers, they're overconfident and easy kills. I play on ps4, so it's probably different than on pc. 
---
By destroying drones you are preventing Mozzie from using his ability. His own team acts as his counter.
---
At least Logan isn‚Äôt a fat lard....
---
I think Apex has some if you wanna try it. It's not crazy in depth from what I glanced by but it exists.
---
New Zealand sunk into the ocean obviously.
---
Please tell me someone who cares in casual. People are usually there to dick around. I never warm up and I‚Äôm a steady plat 1. If you really feel like you need to warm up start a t-hunt hard. Macie Jay does it and he is one of the best players out there 
---
I struggle with whether to practice in semi mode, when I‚Äôm warming up my aim in T Hunt. I‚Äôve seen a lot of places suggest it, presumably to emphasize headshot accuracy, but conventional wisdom is to practice like you play. Experiencing and managing full auto recoil is a big part of the game.
---
Lately I‚Äôve been using a lot of handgun and shotgun in T Hunt. Just to get more comfortable with those weapons, and spice up the difficulty. 
---
that's gridlock
---
I feel like a weeb when I use her
---
You get an actual bug every time you see it?
---
Just throw them down after you plant and then throw smoke grenades, she‚Äôs all about chaos 
---
no u 
---
Aw fuck
---
I think its bullshit that we pay 30 dollars to use the operators early and get vote to kicked by a bronze that doesn‚Äôt even have the operator
---
Nor me. Think they‚Äôll fix it soon. Like early season bugs 
---
"That's why no one wants to play casual o high copper silver solo queue ranked, theres a lot of fucking "funny kids" (always a similar voice 14-18 black gangbanger) that are racist af against whites, toxic, or sexist, i got killed twice yesterday and lose two almost win match, now i understand why a lot of people call this the more toxic community of almost evento game, they have to do something.."

I have way more challenging rounds in casual than I do in Plat ranked. I really do think the extra time has a large factor because the attackers drone everything thoroughly.

---
I like this Idea however, the 1 shot headshot mechanic is what seperates Siege from othr FPSs. It gives a sense of intensity that makes you feel vulnerable. Thus, making the players think twice before making an aggressive move. Compare that to Apex Legends where you can just jump and rush to kill the enemy or CSGO where you just rush with a P90 and a Kev+Helm, the 1 dhot head shot mechanic is there to give you a feeling of suspense when going against fights. And that, in my opinion, is why I don't want 2 shots. Though I get where you're coming from.

It's your buy, don't worry about it ;D /s
---
My favorite bug in R6
---
Sold!
---
I'm glad clash can shock you through your shield 
---
Well its my keyboard too. Do you think it will fix both? And what does raw input even do?
---
Boy why are you bringing me into this? Maybe get a non retarted idea and don‚Äôt whine as much. 
---
I can't grind anymore :(
---
I think this shouldn't be up yet. My friend doesn't see the challenge at all
---
What do you mean, "maybe"? You legit expose everything but your torso when you ads with a shield
---
Yep
---
When do operator themed dildos and fleshlights come out?
---
Yeah but you get them for free with the year four pass
---
This opens so much possibilities: do the Blitz animation with ‚ÄòMY EYES‚Äô from Spongebob. Thatcher animation with Minecraft villager sound. Thermite with Disco Inferno playing. 
---
I was gold 2 and got a gold 4 charm. 
---
On CONSOLE LOL! 
---
LMAO 
---
üé∂üé∂MOVE BITCH, GET OUT THE WAY
---
So u got the wrong charm as well ubi please 
---
And cant type negro that stands for black in Spanish
---
I‚Äôll make a pre-order when they announce them lol
---
How expensive/hard to find compared to that c1? 
---
Dirty cav main
---
it was found on TTS , so you're late . i guess 
---
but what's the deal with ubisoft and this cake ?
---
I mean, the American psychology association literally says it isn't a mental disorder but okay. 
---
Meh better late than never 
---
That is more realistic.

My teammates: Getting spawnpeeked 5s after prep phase.

Me: Clutching untill 1v1

My teammates: Die fast

Also my teammates: *Start kick vote

That's Gridlock.

People will stop maiming twitch, and attackers will shoot friendly drones when they see them

Efu won't be happy about this.

Upvote if you think he‚Äôll get nerfed

Haven't played her yet this season 
---
All your heads are bloody twelve feet tall.
---
what gun do you use?
---
csol yikes
---
Sure did. 
---
Ugliest $100 i can imagine spending 
---
I know this is the case for seasonal skins but had no clue this went for the old season pass skins aswell 
---
he just HAD to ask bandit for a bump

I guess it might be all muscle.

Blitz shield is yellow and thermites weapon is orange 
---
R6
---
I played the original n64 one, and i am happy at how far it has come and how long this game will last(10 years!). We need a remaster of either the original or vegas.
---
She has two SMGs
---
She is going to blast to the fookin' moon with that recoil
---
Wait isn't that ying?
---
Nope it's been like this since Velvet Shell. You can put on the Universal Colored Skins, Universal Camo Skins, and the Season Pass skins but nothing from before The Start of Burnt Horizon
---
bet id beat you on both, whats ur pc and gt?? drop it.
---
Plenty of other people have called you out on how stupid your idea is but then you just randomly select me to blame for your failings....
---
if you bought it through steam you may have linked it to a Ubisoft account that was not the one you usually play on. On launch the game should ask if you want to link year 4 pass to "Account Name" If you did this I think the only way to get it back is to contact Ubi support.
---
Why do you think she's in the air haha
---
No I‚Äôm on Xbox 
---
so dumb that the skin hides the traps under razor wire better
---
Well I have the year 2 pass on a lot of year 3 operators
---
definitely not there‚Äôs spots in maps where it‚Äôs not hard at all to see his drone like kafe for example. if you go to the bar up top you can literally see his drone right above the skylight from inside and it‚Äôs not hard to get outside to see it
---
Well I have the year 2 skin on a lot of year 3 operators
---
I don't play on xbox so I don't really know but I would wait 24 hours and if it has not fixed then contact Ubi support
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just annoying that it‚Äôs there

Solid outcome, sportsmanship be praised.
---
Something something glorifying mental illness.
---
Seems to be the same on PC. 
---
Does it only work if you lose?
---
I was searching for something to be upside down.. 
---
hereby I grant you your very own C-Word pass,carry it with honor ya Cunt
---
Can't stop making this mistake...
---
:V r6s Drone racing! 
---
Really how do?
---
Pretty much yes, many of these accounts get manually reviewed and then added to a ban list, said list will then go into effect en masse.
---
fair enough, I‚Äôve had hibana unlocked for 841 days according to google and never in that time have I really mained her. 
---
No I don't think so. But maybe they updated BattleEye and it's detecting more accounts that got through before. Last time this happened that I could remember was when they first activated it. Tbh this is great to see this again.
---
Looks like he‚Äôs trying to play face raiders on his ds 
---
inb4 someone replies "this but unironically"
---
Yes, it says it is temporary, but I believe an innocent man should not have to go through this. Who is to say something else I didn't do gets me banned permanently because of this "first strike,". I literally feel like the Steven Avery of Siege right now.
---
Thanks ya cunt.
---
I'm on console and I get 1 kill almost every round spawn peaking fuel pumps.
---
i know that, but thunt classic is the only good one. the defender one is long and drawn out
---
Is it one of the gun specific skins? I checked the other day and didn't see them available in the loadout screen.
---
What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
Right back atcha‚Äò Cunt.
---
bro listen to yourself....drink some water or something
---
Starcraft 2, Rocket League
---
The white claymore laser thing is a suggestion specific to this issue in this game. 
---
Ah. That's understandable.
---
Many people have this problem since the new update, me too
---
thay valk wasnt having it
---
Mario Kart DS with leaning for them curves intensifies 
---
I looked at the past notifications to when I purchased the season pass and I received the 600 for that, but this notification was separate. The amount never changed after the update. 
---
I hate when that happens 
---
That's called suicide 
---
...
---
Atleast it was in the bathrrom
---
i think she kinda looks like a CGI anime character
---
A historic day indeed. 
---
*BUSTS THE FATTEST NUT IN EONS*
---
Did you know you can destroy some interior camera with Sledge‚Äôs hammer?
---
Yeah cause I didn‚Äôt know that
---
Odd, been playing since yesterday even with friends in NA (From EU) and having regular ping.
---
Must be localised servers in set locations.
---
Yeah, this skin is only for the P10, which is unfortunate because it looks really good!
---
Quantum science forbids this
---
your meme is going bye bye because they don't allow memes
---
not sure bringing an animal in the game is a good idea
---
Yeah. Had to be... How frustrating would it be to solo queue and figure out that 3 out of 5 on your team cheated or got boosted.   
---
Especially in the early phase of every seasonal ranking where you fight coppers and diamonds. No fun for new players. 
---
Make sure you have the right numbers and the . In my name 
---
??
---
Does it have more reach then a normal melee? would make sense but never tested that actually. 
---
Wow really? So we got 1200 R6 Credits after the update? Does he just buy the season pass recently ? Support never got back to me but that is wild. 
---
Did you get 1200 back then? You get 600 for Season pass y4 and additional 600 if you owned y3 season pass which this message is for.
---
Yes it does.
---
It'd be great if you could. This would add a layer of pressure for Lion and make it less of a viable operator, effectively balancing it in my opinion. 
---
As the defender, you are risking your position to get out and destroy the Lion drone, and as Lion you are in a certain pressure of using the ability as quick into the round as possible. This would also prevent the last second rushes from fruition. What do you think?
---
I mean, on that note, I've had pulse unlocked since I bought the game and he hasn't gotten much action this whole time lol
---
\*play russian anthem\*
---
It has let me into one game so far üòµ
---
:(
---
It's a Spanish server region 
---
Why aren‚Äòt consoleplayers able to spawnpeek on gasstation?
---
I‚Äôm getting the same thing, this is the first time this has happened to me, has it happened to anyone else during other seasons?
---
Sledge the camera killer.
---
I used to have a lot of ping issues on Siege before but this year/update it seems to have fixed itself.
---
Everyone is different and sens means nothing. 
---
yeah
---
Did they implement that into the Burnt Horizon update? Or is it yet to come?
---
well will it be killable? if yes that's pretty wack i dont wanna shoot a dog.
---
This community is sooooo toxic sometimes
---
And shields visor protects against flash Grenade blinds. 
---
You mean year 3 right? You could try to buy the season pass for y3 but I don't know what will happen
---
I can't see red, claymore's, kapkan traps, ect have been the death of me!
---
22/28/45 but you might be better off asking this in /r/SiegeAcademy 
---
What game is that off again?
---
I thought I was good with frost 
---
In theory this should work
---
50/70/72
---
Yes please.
---
3299 
---
He bought the season pass the same day I did, back in January. So we were solidly confused. I'm a little upset tbh, but they gave me a 24hr renown booster for my "troubles".
---
27vert 35Hor 48ADS
---
The same happens to me on XB1
---
The only operator who gains points for killing the hostage
---
End of last year you got free packs if you had twitch prime. If you're going to use your free trial, why use it now when the charm will still be available the next time they do a limited promo.
---
We meet a go bigger!!!;
---
 Hax American!!!!
---
where
---
Did you even read what I said? Or are you gassed off of 1 upvote?
---
Crye is the ultimate flex though
---
Yeah. I just CANNOT get into a game. It keeps saying "Matchmaking Error"?
---
What? Are you having a stroke?
---
I tried but it doesnt actually givce me the option to buy the season pass
---
Mouse and keyboard
---
No it will get injured like but it lets off a weak wimpir when injured but can be revived 
---
Same for me and my friend
---
No, I only received 600 R6 credits when I bought Season Pass Y4. I had bought Y3 Pass as well but I never got the additional 600 from the  Burnt Horizon message. 
---
Same for me :/
---
Yup, just had two matches that had 155+ ping. Most everyone in my lobby including myself are from US Central or East. I'm not sure what's causing the issues. 
---
Try some code websites like Instant gaming
---
I restarted my game because I was getting this on PC and it fixed it 
---
I mean you can downvote me IDC in the slightest but this is like on par with something my 6 year old cousin would draw in like 10-15 mins.    
---
How this took you...more than that is mind boggling.  
---
Dont quit your day job for something in art thats all Im saying
---
Who do you main?
---
Send a video for Ubi.

Yea mine worked right after I said same
---
IQTIE PATOOTIE
---
She still ugly af not an opinion, my hibana has looked the same for 4 years idk who dis new op is.
---
Still think this is kind of a stupid proposal, and personally it's not insanely hard to do away with shield ops; it's just risky and annoying as hell. I think maybe a reduction in MELEE speed would be welcome, and allow for attackers to counter it much easier, but there are better ways to deal with this than "let's get these hunks of metal to fuck right off"
---
Ah, well, apologies, just fired off a quick comment without looking at the whole thread.
---
Is this how console is all the time?
---
yeah thats what i bought the first time. a little outdated but still, it would take weeks to afford it, considering I have bills and get little to no hours, but I'm trying to get another job atm. I wish I knew someone who could help me with my current PC \*wink wink\*
---
Maybe: used to show that something is possible or that something might be true
---
I dont know, thats why I said maybe. Its first time happened to me and did not happen later. So yeah best thing I can say is maybe. 
---
Uhmm yeah that's what I'm saying 
---
Yes you have to keep going the trophy is sorta glitched due to the situations counting towards it when it‚Äôs not suppose to. I got it after around 120.. 
---
Only two options: The boot or the TK. Had to be done 
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little Mozzie, short and stout...‚Äù
---
Holy shit didn't know they ran that expensive. Why couldn't she just carry the stock version?
---
Jackal is 51 now so figure that one out
---
I can't see pulse being tall. Unless he's lanky af.
---
I would think he'd be like 120 lbs.
---
You‚Äôre in trouble, mister.
---
Honestly I run holo instead of acog anyways. So It wouldn't bother me lol. But I'm also a trash console player so
---
lol. you actually realy did!
---
They‚Äôre still in and the P90 one is cheap as hell. 1k renowned without the season pass.
---
Thank you so much. Wasn‚Äôt sure anywhere else to get the answer.
---
Cheers mate. 
---
I care and so does OP. Ubi cares enough to implement it and cater to identity politics. You care enough to defend it.
---
I can also play a game and appreciate some parts of it and dislike and criticise other parts of it. Because I'm not that one-dimensional.
---
I'd pay triple for this year's season pass if that were the case
---
Shame on me
---
Shame I'm from the UK, maybe someone in the states you could try?
---
I never planned to, and I draw because I like to. If you think you cousin can do better then by all means like your cousins drawings better. I was also working on it within the like 2 mins of free time I had at the end of my classes. My point was if you dont like it just downvote and go you dont need to comment on it because it wont change anything 
---
they are still in 
---
Already have, but thanks. The vent also actually hits a secure area as well, the "Office" objective/bombsite is what it lands on. If you're a defender just look right above the desk in the room and you'll see the vent.
---
Why do I always get vote-kicked as soon as I enter a game, like Jesus Christ it‚Äôs fucking casual 
---
Yeah, it would suck to be bodyslammed by a shield boy, but it is far from lethal.
---
Anyways. Yes please. Especially monty, his melee is broken as shit. Needs a 1-2 second delay from when you're in mountain mode.
---
Other than that, they need a slow as shit ADS and to be slow.
---
(And for fucks sake change blitz's ability, it's fucking broken as shit on principle.)
---
They already can‚Äôt figure it out how to release ranked gamemode for 3 years. Some fancy physics/scripts for looping there will kill already unstable game for sure. 
---
dokkaebo fanart i **cant** fap to? this angers me
---
Sometimes but rarely a game will become corrupted during download. In this case steam will reinstall the whole game. This is the only thing I can think of. Sorry man, looks like your in it for the long haul...
---
This. Exactly this, I have two accounts because it gives me two attempts at a rank but also if I‚Äôm having a bad day then I can swap to my lesser account without having to worry about MMR. Having a smurf doesn‚Äôt make me toxic it just makes the game less pressured 
---
They‚Äôll never give you paid currency for free.
---
She ain‚Äôt fat... she thicc
---
[But what about raptor legs...](https://youtu.be/u9-GrUNELP0) 
---
its amazing! I love it
---
its a joke you dumb twat
---
Youd think the third player would reconsider
---
I wonder if that person can even consistently shoot the final trap, or if he'd just end up teamkilling because theyre in the way
---
How did you fit 10 ranked games in little over 24 hours
---
I deadass dont get their logic behind renown, its a soup of messy overpricing, jeez
---
You can knife on favela
---
It‚Äôs cause it‚Äôs a birthday event for the operators. And because we‚Äôve had dog tags we now get the weapon skins
---
I‚Äôm waiting 
---
This seems so cayde-ish,shame he's gone
---
This happened t ok ne too
---
I'm having the same problem so thank you
---
I just think the actual swing needs to be slower, but a delay before meleeing after an ability would be welcome as well. I think blitz should definitely have a delay in melee after it's [he/she?] ability is used, and the ability itself needs to not be super effective
---
It‚Äôs funny how hacking drones with mozzie doesn‚Äôt count as destroying them. Someone check what happens if defender destroys hacked mozzie‚Äôs drone, will it count for challenge?
---
youre the one fantasizing about some stupid character in a game. try different jokes, it‚Äôs not funny anymore. Maybe a different approach loser
---
Yall are degenerates, she ugly as hell now wtf how can anyone prefer that over old hibana, elite looks fine but she looks like they barely tried in picture and in game 
---
I just finished Stardust crusaders for the first time recently, fucking loved it
---
Super cinematic tho
---
They crippled that gun 
---
Exactly my point, i predicted the movement of the enemy wrong which caused me to die but that is my mistake. I was just confused how did i die while he wasn't looking at me
---
Were you not around when you couldnt go under the cabinet on Kafe?
---
Lol, mine at one point hit 1,141 days. That was on Uplay... On Steam, for those that have never seen it, at that point just says:
---
"More than a year.."
---
Yeah but most of our food, gas and other common items are measured in metric. Height and weight is the only exception, and on government ID and stuff even those measurements are in metric. 
---
I got tk'd for no reason other than using the new ops, we lost the match because of it, too
