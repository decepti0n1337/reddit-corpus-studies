You didn‚Äôt give us any information, how are we supposed to know?

Literally all you have to do to stop a rush is hold an angle on the entrance to site.

What did you use to print

Why would you choose any other location though? it would spawn you the closest and you could never get spawn peaked

What are they doing exactly? Popularizing his name with successful games? I'm pretty sure he'd love to see it.

Why do the coppers always do this?

I miss Acog SMG11. My friend who only played Smoke stopped playing about a month before the Acog got removed. For that month I fell in love with the pocket sniper.

I only know how to do it on mobile

No i already get some from that,  at the end when it totals up my renown, there is a part that says Bonus Event. When I win I get around 140-150 extra from it.

I don't know if they patched it yet, but if you play the "No Intel" situation (Thermite @ Kafe), he still has grenades.
---
I mean I would have during obviously
---
But u saw him go trough the hole as the guy was still creating said hole, den look at the guy and den reinforce that specific wallpart first. It's obv trolling

I have nearly the same setup as you, same issue. I don't understand why it would out of nowhere just start stuttering.

Sorry to disappoint man, i got busy with my last semester project (mini-thesis? Not sure how to call it in english lol) so yeah...hehe

If you don't rush the building and actually use your drone like intended rumours become easy kills for attackers.

You don't lose as much mmr if the enemy average is much higher than yours. You also get a shit ton of mmr if the enemy is significantly higher. Like 60 instead of 30

---
Maverick.
---
Before he put his helmet on I asked if he missed his ACOG
---
He just gave me sad eyes
---
This is really good, do you make these with a program or something?
---
When me and my freinds play, we turn our brightness down to around 5 for those hiding and 10 for the seaker. This makes it more fun bc everyone has trouble seeing and jump scares are around every corner. If you want to you one farther you can invert colors and burn your eyes.
---
oh shit you're right. Lemme just put my drone on every window and door on the map and I can make sure I won't get killed from run outs at the start of each round. How silly of me
---
That would mess up the game they would be better adding a healing attacker
---
In game res

You can if your holding equipment

Kill cams aren't accurate they are a client side recreation of what happened.

PC isn't as bad compared to console. Still happens though..
---
Nice plays!
---
I'm sorry I'm not here to play rainbow like a pro, basing how you adjust the game off of the 1% of people that do isn't a smart thing. Congrats on being a meaningless rank! Pat yourself on the back bud, I'm proud
---
See this right here is so painful to read. The goal should 100% be to still have your drones after prep having driven them outside or left near a common spawn peek/runout. On every map teams will typically start on 1 of 2 sites that you can figure out from sound alone. You don‚Äôt need to go drive your drone in looking for points and to ping the other team. Who they are running doesn‚Äôt really matter.
---
It's (m)870p
---
Ight
---
The fact that it wasn‚Äôt called ‚ÄúAir Force Fun‚Äù angers me.
---
What motherboard do you have? I'd recommend a Ryzen 1600 or 1500. I don't think the CPU matters too much it's more about the GPU, I think yours can just about get 144fps. I know a 1070 can get it easily so yours should too.
---
Plat 90% of the time, touched diamond twice before switching to PC. People are good. There is an insane skill wall at diamond of players who are just better then you on a whole different skill level. They are not using a mouse, hell a majority of them from what I have heard, have told me they tried using keyboard and mouse and did not like it. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
As for other things helping them? Modified controllers are typical up there. I know a guy in real life who has a 190$ controller. Are you going to rip on him? Have you even seen how unstable m+kb is in siege? Probably not.
---
Lion is not overpicked on console

Signed!

It literally has nothing to do with playing like a pro, just being halfway competent. This game is great because it constantly keeps you on your toes and it is constantly teaching you things. Runouts/peeks where you can die before ever taking a step after spawn shouldn‚Äôt exist, but to take away peeks and runouts completely would be such a hilariously bad move.
---
I would have voted to kick me too
---
i rarely play oregon, it's the best map imo and it never comes to me
---
This gun with today's shitty exploits in the game...
---
It is partly because I haven't been keeping up with the game but nowadays it seems as if the only way to win is to know all the dirty little spawn camps, hiding spots and so on.
---
it's not that hard to read after some time but you're going to be fucked mentally again if you try to read normal comics
---
The xim adapters are actually really decent, I used to have an acquaintance that used it and he is gold 1 on pc but hits diamond every season easily, it‚Äôs easy to tell the difference on the stutters
---
Lesion has a shotgun? /s
---
Exactly why I quit this game. At the start of Burnt Horizon, I was constantly tked because people wanted to abuse the system one more time, and the game got so stale and boring to play. Ubi had a good game but got fucked by the community.

You‚Äôll be pleased to learn that there *will* in fact be PvP implemented into RoN. It‚Äôs old school with only a server browser, but you‚Äôll be able to compete against others. Dunno if you saw, but a new trailer dropped recently.

Well you could get a new group of friends who play rainbow seriously and play on a main account. Then when you play with your irl friends use a second account. Although if you‚Äôre on pc you‚Äôll have to pay for a second.

Uh no, cause this isnt a made up story this literally just happened and I'm so fucking tired of it I'm on the verge of unistalling this game. I have over 1000 hours across all platforms.  This game is great, but every other attribute it has is pretty fucking shit
---
So what are you trying to say exactly?
---
Easy fix: don‚Äôt use his turret

We didn‚Äôt have The Lord at mine.

I don't play it, I got tired of it after the first two matches.

Ya, and I am wondering why it's still in the game. Ubi knows there is a problem with it. Just remove it entirely. Don't make small changes
---
You got 16-6 then you're probably smurfing or matched against low skill players so your teammates were low skill too. They didn't throw.
---
I‚Äôm just talking about the loading screen, not the game mode. I do agree though, it did get old very fast.

How is that different than any other map?

You go up in larger increments in your earlier ranked matches. After a while your elo will begin to decline. Also you lose more when you lose compared to when you gain and win

Ah man, when I first started playing Siege, I used this on smoke all the time. I was completely oblivious to the balance of the game at the time, and received a lot of compliments on how well I did at the time. Now that I've returned, I've realized how broken that shit was, because all I did back then was play Smoke with Acog. Now I realize I'm just a bad who used an OP weapon way too much.
---
Sweet man, thank you so much! Been looking in the community for over an hour now but it seems like nobody wanted to spare a min of their life to help someone beside you. My psn is same as my reddit
---
I‚Äôm currently exclusively using SAS pistol and Spetsnaz pistol.

I had to go back up to look at wtf you were talking about
---
Hehehehehehehehehe
---
Nope but would that matter? Still seems incredibly childish to me. 
---
I mean as much I appreciate friendly fire in a competitive game this is generally why I don't usaully want it. Because no matter your intentions as a dev 9 times out of 10 it will only come up whith shitty pkayers that find it fun to fuck over others. Unless of corse you strically enforce it which I find tends to make the games environment a lot more stressful at times especially when 1 to 2 bullets will drop just about anyone.

Me: mains smoke and sees an acog on smg 11

Like if that's the case than fuck putting up a wall it aint worth it knowing that some child minded teammate will just kill me for it.
---
It's reminiscent if the "Lord Forgive Me" Bugs Bunny meme
---
So is that the one I should start with? (Within the r6 type book)
---
Agreed. But at leat those rounds are quicker and don't lead to having watch for 3 minutes because someone was salty. The answer to someone being miffed in a ranked match shouldn't be oh I'll just team kill because nothing will happen to me. I'm just glad theyre having operation friendly fire.

Go to the the place you launch R6 from in Steam, then right click on it and it should say verify integrity of game files.

---
the guy with the high ping does not have an inherent advantage over you, especially if he has more than 150 ping since some of his shots will not register. If anything its way easier for you to play if you have low ping.
---
sledge's positioning is kind of lacking, but that's just kind of how his picture is. otherwise quite nice.
---
Ah noice. Good editing software! I use vegas movie studio, a bit more straight forward for me. You should try making a video to a song, with like syncing shots and beats and shit. Thats my favorite thing to do
---
&gt;Dude we get it you wiki firearm shit all the time and im sure at the range you're that annoying prick that knows every detail everyone else is too polite to tell fck off to
---
You're using the fact that I'm right as a point against me?
---
&gt;A p90 with a supressor you cant take off doesn't exist and neither does a vector chambered for battle rifle rounds
---
Implementing the Vector Super-V mitigation system onto a battle rifle is a logical step, whereas an integrally suppressed P90 has absolutely no purpose.
---
&gt;the fact you're just now getting upset at something unrealistic/inauthentic/dOeSN't eXiSt in this game is hilarious.
---
You misspelled "illogical" and "pointless". Syringe firing air pistols, air pressure based propellant bombs, computer capturing drones and self-dissolving medical nano-machines don't exist, but they're all designed with logical purpose. There's no logic to permanently compromising the barrel length of a gun in order for it to operate in a role its cartridge was specifically not designed for.
---
eh, this chart is terrible. It's better to look at high level gameplay to get a better understanding of the nerf. There Maestro is banned more than half the time. 
---
He has has the best gun on defence by miles, one of the best gadgets, a shotgun and barbed wire. He was just too strong.

I prefer ela, throw her gadget at the enemy when you see one to get an easy kill.

I believe Ubi is cooking a new def op to deal woth grenades. That should be interesting to see.
---
Yea fun is key lol. I‚Äôm honestly worried I‚Äôve been dying to buy the game because it feels so tactical but I watch these videos and some people are going COD and shit with tackanka and all that. Don‚Äôt know if that is still the meta lol but yea
---
Wouldn‚Äôt doubt it but that‚Äôs Siege for you and it will never change as its year 4. I gave up.
---
You just need to keep playing to dig yourself out of the lower ranks where that stuff happens more often. It will never not happen in X rank, but once you get into high silver/low gold that kind of thing happens very infrequently, in my experience.
---
I got tked for having lava skin equipped once
---
It‚Äôs shitty everywhere.  
---
In my experience PC just has more of everything compared to XB1. 
---
Just today just about every other match had some dipshit killing everyone for shits and giggles somewhere in the match. Whereas the same thing happens every 5-6 matches on XB1. Also, text chat is a cesspool.  
---
On the other hand, I actually find more people willing to communicate and have some fun. So there‚Äôs that.
---
Read dokkaebis dmr description my dude

... all of these suggestions are making Ubisoft's "Air Cute One" seem really, really shitty.
---
But imma also give you a reason why peeps run shotgun smg lets take mure he doesnt have impact but to waste a nitro to open a wall is kind of an waste so having a shotgun to open the wall that quickly switching to the smg is how peeps do it
---
Because it's incredibly risky and gives you only a short period of time to act on it before your position is revealed, meaning unless you got really good intel and aim, you're going to get picked off?
---
it's bullshit
---
then just fucking play her.
---
Oh yeah, super risky, also god forbid they see my position after I kill 3 of them. A 1 for 3 trade is never a good deal! /s

It's gAy
---
Why there‚Äôs no penalty for leaving a casual match? It happened a lot to me: a teammate dies in the first round and just leaves the match, and not always will someone join the match and you‚Äôre stuck 4v5 or even 3v5 if someone else decides to leave also. That‚Äôs just unfair
---
That's dark

If you were around during chimera then there a frost bundke where you could by a black ice

it was probably lag or a glitch with the wall

I feel like the recoil on her smg isn't as bad as it used to be. Her shotgun is really good, and not having impacts isn't ruining her kit. You could try the pistol for longer ranges, but I honestly can't tell if its in a good position or not.

---
If that happened to me, I wouldn't be able to stop myself from killing him
---
Some people work better under that kind of pressure. Most just charge at the objective and get bodied immediately.
---
This is only true if you‚Äôre behind/around someone else whos triggered a trap. If you trigger the trap the values are the same no matter the distance nor the height.
---
Are you saying throwers don‚Äôt exists. I‚Äôve had games where people use a macro to afk the whole game to get free renown. Or people will type in all chat your position or destiny gadgets. People will sabotage the team to deranged without Tking or abandoning matches.
---
fix what?
---
So im going to start by saying that you where the first person in this conversation who took things personal, secondly if your here to suggest that because of sheer numbers in the military and diversity of units, that more operators should be introduced then i must say that once again your facts dont add up if wee look at Russia compared to america then we will see you are correct with Russia having 1,027,000 and America having 1.4 million people. as you can see in the Russia its one operator for every 205400 service members or 20% of the military, in America its one operator for every 175000 service members or 12.5% of the military. thats obviously a significant difference which shows a pretty clear difference. your second point also shows very apparent falsehood as well in terms of number and diversity of specialised units between all the different services each country comes out about equal, if you dont believe me you can check Wikipedia or any other military listings website for yourself. with this information in mind please could you explain to me why Americans are still getting an unfair advantage in size of service to no of ops over other countries
---
anything with a 1050ti. i'd prefer to get one with a 1060 though
---
Alright thanks!
---
Try the find a team section of the R6 discord
---
It will be abused and lead to people only playing a few maps. Your rank is there to show how well you can deal with multiple scenarios, not much time you have on 3 maps.
---
OP likely how the ranks are matched up, the top player on the other team is someone who threw to get copper 2.
---
This team's ranks aren't actually that far from OP's but the copper could potentially be a higher plat or even diamond before throwing.
---
Dope
---
Do you mean like peaking over the top through the little wooden cutout type things? 
---
Pretty sure you can just vault onto it.
---
If you mean the LMG then it's the LMG. 
---
If you mean the shotgun, then the 308 as the shotgun is garbage. The shotgun can be fun to use as a joke but it has way too much recoil and it's hipfire widens fairly fast making it super easy to miss all of your shots.
---
Here. Maybe r/shittyrainbowsix.
---
No
---
R6 is trash
---
Reinforced da wall!
---
Its trash bruh, the bugs ruin the game and make it unplayable in some cases.
---
I got a legendary shot skin for aa12 shotgun... It's like the worst skin ever
---
I know there is a tagged post on the subreddit with all the changes. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will tag it haha
---
If you want to play a good game go buy the new battlefield
---
New ops are a big hand full. Reinforcements aren't safe cause of Maverick and his blow torch. We got a shield on defense now, there is a girl with volumetric desplay hologram decoys that track you. And most importantly, rainbow 6 is going through a toy phase rn.
---
you dont have recoil when you use adrenaline boost tho :c
---
I personally have had this happen before, sorry mate
---
Who what gun
---
Was you the one who made one like this before with Alibi and Lion? Good job either way
---
This sub: reposter
---
Title was not related to the character.
---
Just rappell &amp; it sorts it out.

*Han Solo pew pew noises*
---
So you aren't spider man?
---
Jaeger run outs happened all the time on ps4 when he had an acog.
---
I fuckin hope this becomes a thing
---
i was just saying
---
I like how this would work, although I think it‚Äôs too much of a hard counter against monty
---
Nice drone bait. I got one the other day on Coastline. Saw the guy in the corner with one drone and decided to chuck my other in the window. Second later he jumps out and I domed him. Felt very good as it was my first time doing that in Ranked.
---
Fookin lazeh saights - Thatcher.
---
Kaid actually has range on his guns where ela is almost useless atm, the scorpion has so much recoil that you cant predict its useless at range so you run shotgun, but the shotgun is obviously also bad at range. Kaid on the other hand has good utility and good weapons
---
I have never thought about that, but you make a great point. I have a relatively cheap pair of headphones I got for like $40 that have surround sound and easily adjustable volume. Being able to just sit in one spot with the volume up for a second can make hearing those rotates so much easier.
---
I always go towards clash, too many people go backwards, or run away, don't. Go close, en melee, then spray the feet.
---
Maybe client side destruction is stupid in a game where everything can be blown up
---
I'm playing the shit out of Air Cute One, but left Outbreak untouched...anyone else? Or the other way around???

that was something
---
Yea but there a legit defence strat. Otherwise entry to the map would be far too easy, plus Blackbeard‚Äôs playing on windows wouldn‚Äôt be punished as much. Also it‚Äôs not like there a difficult thing to counter, to spawnpeak you have to of broken a barricade and to run out you run the risk of hitting a claymore

ye sure thanks bud  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj2NxgGvjgw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj2NxgGvjgw)
---
Haha honestly all you really need is some trap ops best counter for him solo rusher won‚Äôt be able to shoot all gu mines Kapkans if the blitz isn‚Äôt paying attention and shoot underrated echo is a huge counter it makes blitz not be able to see and renders him useless and easy to counterrush but yeah he isn‚Äôt fun in a 1-1 verse just need to aim where his head would be when he ads his ads got nerfed a couple of updates ago really changing how op blitz is.
---
Haha a 3 speed blitz holy crap I honestly wanna see that now
---
it kind of depends because ying is pretty much a solo op but capitao is like a support and a team player. I think he needs to be coordinated with his team when you play. To me ying is just yeeting candelas in to OBJ and rushing. Have to say though, ying is so much more fun, especially when you get 2+ kills when you candela OBJ.
---
Cool buff!
---
you can't do anything else other than r u n
---
actually, just don't fall for the turnaround trick, hide and eventually catch her off guard, that's the best I can come up with
---
It's my birthday today

It is there it is just hard to find...

What about "LET ME IIIIIN"?

Fun fact, unlike the Seals,  GROM actually do use DEagle IRL

Cap main here I love everything bout his kit
---
BB is broken OP. Cap is high skill cap and his buff makes him a wee bit more powerful while raising the cap.
---
HOWEVER, gridlock is "for some reason" widely considered a weak attacker, and she's even getting a Nerf next season. You should consider mastering her, however I consider her almost as powerful in a coordinated team as nomad.
---
I know my dude...
---
Vigil and mozzie are the best now, Cav comes second.
---
Cool. I play with one other person so it's time to play her
---
FBI OP- *Explosion*
---
Says the jew hater
---
ikr but still to some people even if they have c4 they are scared of blitz
---
Worth it.
---
Why does it not just rotate the maps in order instead of auto it?
---
Surely there is a good reason for this but just wondering....
---
This is beyond science
---
Yeah I don't like cav ethier buy I find blitz worse than her
---
I think modded controllers are ok (like a Scuf controller). and I have no problem with them because you are still aiming with thumb sticks and there is no aim advantage, which is all I care about. 
---
Personally I couldn‚Äôt care if someone has remapped a button so they can vault easier or reload easier (only issue is crouch on a paddle for example, but crouch spamming fix with help the issue). I can work around that and it really isn‚Äôt an advantage. That‚Äôs just me though. I don‚Äôt use a modded controller but I don‚Äôt care if someone does (like a Scuf). 
---
K&amp;M is the issue as it‚Äôs an aim advantage and that‚Äôs the line at which I have an issue. Just me though
---
‚ÄúWe‚Äù?

Exactly 365 days ;)
---
I asked one of my friends if they had ever played New Vegas. 
---
"Nope, just the first one...Fallout 3".
---
You can say that again
---
They might have made that but its a company made for profits, and they also invest heavily into esports. That's a hugeee chunk of that money gone already, tjem there's the cost of keep on the servers running, also again there's services like battleye. Just because they made 400 mil doesn't mean that a certain ammount of that money goes back into the game, people need to be payed first.

 I couldnt sleep one day after a 1v5 clutch
---
Welcome to the Squad Gentlemen
---
How widespread is it though? I feel like everyone is using it on PS4. Aiming on PC vs. PS4 has gotten eerily similar on my kill cams. It's making me not want to go back to PS4. If I am going to play against M&amp;K, I don't want to be using a controller.
---
Hey that‚Äôs my birthday!!
---
Hmu with that link
---
It is currently 11:30pm where im at rn
---
i got my 3rd black ice for bandit's SMG yesterday , after i've counted how much alpha packs i've opened after i got glaz's black ice . it was like a total of 242 commons . 46 rares , 22 epics and 5 legendaries
---
Damn. That one looks pretty sick.
---
We knew this, its also toxic as fuck
---
silver
---
That's maverick
---
ye bro :D
---
I use one from hyperx and it's good
---
Wow my first balck ice after 200 plus packs
---
And make Tachanka say BOW DOWN TO ME
---
What‚Äôs the damage multiplier on headshots? Does it vary from gun to gun?
---
The link works for me
---
Yea i get that i will use it if i dont have the map memorized or on small maps i will use the f2
---
I will use it sometimes
---
so you were probably solo queuing i'll assume, people will just do it to do it unfortunately; if it means they get more points for a reinforcement, so be it i guess.
---
a couple months ago i was solo queuing with the intent to pick up a couple of people and play with them, i remember getting teamkilled because of a mira placement, another fun little experience i had once in ranked was someone stealing my kills mid-interrogation with caveira for the sake of being toxic.
---
my best advice here is to just play with a couple buddies of yours, give your call outs, but just stick with them if you think shit might go wrong.
---
:/
---
NEU is a dead server so here's how to fix it:
---
1. Create a custom game playlist (don't bother changing anything just make a playlist)
---
2. Enter the custom game menu and select online, then select your playlist and change the server to whatever server you wish to connect to.
---
3. Click edit playlist, *don't* change anything and click save playlist.
---
(You will need to repeat this process after every match btw)
---
You should now be on whichever server you chose. If you're not it's probably because I'm shit at explaining stuff. The simplest way is to use a vpn.
---
Stop, drop, open up shop
---
I needed a background that would look good or every background so I jump changed the color to blue and I got rid of the ‚Äúskull rain‚Äù
---
I see a 1v8 :P
---
Thats tough, i wish i could help you out more but im in canada with bad internet lol. I wish you the best of luck
---
I didn't have any issues when first importing the clips, but I did have issues with the sound going haywire if I tried to move clips around in my sequence timeline; it only happened every so often though.
---
Well I play majority in gold, and he is rarely played. Plus, only around ~5% of the player base is Plat 1 or Diamond
---
That was just me being a idiot and not finishing
---
Allow it to be deployed without removing the wooden barricade, this saves a lot of time and give defender a cushion if there are enemies approaching nearby when attacker melee'd the barricade.
---
You are just salty. Blackbeard is not so game breaking as you said. There are many ways to counter him, even in solo queue 
---
Rotate to flank him, don‚Äôt peek, make him push without cover, impact, nitro, kapkan, etc 
---
He can only do good if he has a corner to press up against and shoot. You can easily hit his large hit box when he is exposed
---
Today‚Äôs my birthday.
---
Maybe they can have something to sell to people whit no tickets search in internet you can find someting cheers!
---
Ngl pump shotties are kinda shit rn. They're only good at setting up site.
---
His clip trying to shoot through the wall is so amazing and goofy
---
Surely Lion has a pump action compact shotgun
---
They did use a Gu and not a twitch (im the one filming)
---
SAS elitist, like myself.  I respect that.
---
417 is kinda trash. It needs more ammo to be viable imo.
---
Thank you for the suggestion! I definitely used "apply default transitions" as a copout haha
---
tbf it forces them into a vault, and they do it bc they think its safe, little did they know there was gonna be 3 frost mats on the other side \*BUT WHERE WAS THE FROST???\*
---
adobe premiere pro!
---
Ubi must have known it was my birthday

now if only they'd give smoke an elite skin, the Universe would be at ease

Probably a maxim machine gun

Well yea so are the other one shot rifles

Thanks buddy! I will try it out, I‚Äôve thought about editing a long time!
---
What?
---
oh,my bad. i really did not see that. I apologize.
---
ALABAMA 100
---
i like glaz and j√§gers elites.
---
It‚Äôs literally one of the best shotguns in game
---
Is that portal

They  could link the rank to the account and not the server?

This^
---
Kaplan bottom tier. I think the fuck not.
---
üëè
---
Bandit (I cannot wait anymore)
---
I always thought that Kaid was balanced completely around the Han Solo blaster, but it's not extremely useful anymore in its present state. The AUG should have an ACOG too.
---
Twitch good
---
Repost
---
no prob

Yeah I agree. Break down bulletproof barricade with melee is nonsense, and it is first reason why castle is weak.

Oh ma dads bday

Its actually my birthday today, saw that calender a few months ago and i was like wait a minute

No. You are the first person that I‚Äôve heard complain

Yep and then you just keep avoiding bad players until you only get good players to carry you.

Do you know this is unfunny and unoriginal?

I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being sarcastic. I haven‚Äôt seen it posted here but in game I always hear people complaining.
---
Did you know that you are a huge dick?
---
Yup. Just stating the obvious, that‚Äôs all
---
Ok maybe keep your opinions to yourself its just a meme dude.

Okay, now this is epic

Happy birthday ED day to you sir

We literally just had this 10 minutes posted ago.

This is beautiful

I just wish they would put a little more effort into the cosmetics to make those moments when you do get a legendary more special. Thats all.

yur stupud and bad at game
---
and you seem like you just troll in casual and ranked. now get lost
---
Just saw the vid this morning XD
---
fuze
---
Top game isn‚Äôt siege lmao
---
You need to work on using your gadgets
---
That‚Äôs sounds better than my idea actually
---
There's the toxic fan base, I thought we lost you.
---
At this point I don't know what the hell is going on with this. It's been at least a month by now and the skins are still gone. Can they get their shit together and figure out why they're missing? I want my skin back too.
---
quit with the trash memes. read the sub rules
---
If Recruit gets removing I'm deleting Siege lol
---
oof
---
There was a time where I wasn't toxic. But after getting team killed around 200 times for no reason. I gave up.
---

You're an asshole if you're teamkilling at all.
---
Ok, i understand where you are coming from. She is not a fagging operator, i will agree. But, no operator should rely on their team at all times. I am saying, maybe buff the damage on her shield again **OR** decrease the switch speed to 1.25 seconds. This means that she can take care of the 1v1's but not be able to take on a whole team.
---
What kind of sorcelery did I just witness ?
---
Have you seen her win delta, it is worse than tachanka...
---
The sponsor skin was 12,5k renown...its expensive on its own but i maybe played 2 games with it and that was at the beginning of march..
---
I honestly completely forgot that the level restriction was a thing, sorry, in that case though if you want to persevere with the game play casual until you can play ranked. It shouldn't take too long and the game does get better when you do
---
Breaking news: a guy found dead after hanging himself with the mouse cable

Hey that's my line

I already have the game

nah it was my bad

Lmao this guys going around posting the most salty whiney stuff today üòÇ

Wow thats my birthday

Next update, you‚Äôll be able to rappel

If you like playing for the team, I would recommend Mozzie, if you‚Äôre more into just dragging out and roaming and not really helping in the form of a gadget, get Vigil.

u/UbiNoty plz, pass this suggestion to devs(reduction of Scorpion's mag to 31, but making recoil much more manageable). I want devs to see that community is a bit unhappy with current Ela's state......
---
what are HD-Assets
---
I like it
---
Does it work on console or only on PC?
---
That sounds like me alright!!!
---
You know you can turn some maps off in matchmaking options right?
---
Terrible! I could do better! *shows a picture of a single line* I call it the stick!
---
And is it really a coincidence that i lag 2 times when facing tbe same guy? I had no other lag in the other 2 rounds i played only when i faced this guy. My teammates experienced the same
---
Low ranks in console at its finest. People leaving, enemies bringing shields but don't know how to use them and enemies not knowing how to aim.
---
He's talking pl. The win delta charts are only diamond/ plat ranked
---
How
---
"that war thing"
---
I do recall it started going down hill after I downed the last defender from afar and called the kill as I was on my way to knife him but my teammate downed me and took the kill. I TKd that clown for sure.........not sure what else I did???
---
Fuck it, I still have my Smurf account

Idk j√§ger acog seems worse ( I never used or played against either of them so idk)
---
what help do you need
---
No. This is not rimjob_steve. Rimjob_steve is when a user with such a username says something profound or wholesome. It is not when someone has a weird username.
---
What operator do you think is the worst for defense
---
ive tried this for like 10 minutes before and i couldnt get it to work ;-; guess im just bad.
---
Brillant. Thank you!
---
Maverick, buck and then probably about half the attacking ops have some sort of m4/ ar15 variant
---
Both are amazing roamers do you want to drone out a room and make big dick plays or sit near obj and hide your Korean Batman ass
---
ah yes. the, all aim, no brain. those exists
---
lolllll you‚Äôre an angry little fella aren‚Äôt ya
---
1 recruit by himself is unmenacing and a joke, but 5 of them together can bring about the apocalypse
---
Is it really tho
---
Honestly recruit shouldn't even be in the game at this point.
---
Clash
---
Sieges hit reg is fine though. It hasn't had issues for a while.
---
Investigate 311!
---
Not being dumb? Run in her face and melee her. Her taser effect barely lasts four seconds before hitting a long recharge. Melee and hip fire.
---
Weird way to spell overpriced TF2 but okay
---
Same
---
Well if your citing a kill cam as evidence you clearly aren't aware of the fact that kill cams are complete garbage and don't show what actually happened
---
Should have been ela
---
If you accidentally kill someone two times, you need to be taken out of the matchmaking. I‚Äôm closing in on 2000 hours and I‚Äôve never team killed twice on accident.
---
Nigga it's 30mins. Just go take a shit
---
Holy shit you're a cunt.
---
I love it when you spend an hour researching and making a post then some asshole comes along, yells repost and fucks it all up.
---
Yeah I had a feeling that was the case. I mostly wanted to know because I wanted to see if there was a way to get the older operators without grinding, but it looks like I have no choice. Gonna think long and hard about getting the pass for this season. Thanks fir the help üòÑ
---
I don't know why exactly, but I'm getting some Ricardo Milos vibe lmao
---
I think he's always going to be a suprise pick at best that they won't have planned to counter. I guess he is maybe viable for a team that just keeps recruit rushing in?
---
His guns arent bad either, but then you'd just pick kapkan.
---
yeah that's good too. I hope they implement it. I bought a booster and it's all down the drain.
---
Castle. Because well.. he‚Äôs castle.
---
for the jackle one it was a kill cam this is not what i am doing for kaid i am citing the actual clip part of my screen and what i saw in game. i have gone onto softwares that slow down videos and you can quiet clearly see me shoot her in the mouth.
---
How dare you
---
I put it there becaus we had a maestro and I wanted to tell him when the enemies were at the window
---
The godliest and noobiest!
---
24 hours.
---
I won't say all of it, but it starts with De
---
Sometimes, yeah, recruit can work cause people can be dumb. But at the same time, I‚Äôve faced some good recruits. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs shit perse, just less liked cause he‚Äôs gadget-less
---
You can only put a Black Mirror on the side that is showing metal, not the side that's got the anchors.
---
You won't get banned for tea bagging in Siege or CS so go crazy.
---
I‚Äôve had this problem a few times but usually chalked it up to poor internet at Uni. Maybe that wasn‚Äôt the issue after all ü§î Have you tried restarting your console and quitting the game? Not the best fix, but it sometimes worked for me

I roll with that Sasg for close and rely on how well I picked my angle with the turret for long range. I'm doing pretty well right now but by round 4 the other team will try to adjust with frags or buck
---
Yeah, ive tried a couple times and I waited until there was 20 mins on the queue and decided to play something else

I got the game on lunar sale and haven't had a problem till now. I only got the ban recently and consecutively.

I know its not Siege or simulated like Siege but its good to practice your reaction time.

For recoil control i'd recommend setting up custom game in Hereford shooting range and try to fire from various distance.

No, either it‚Äôs purchased in the digital store or some physical stores have cards for Xbox or PlayStation with a code to obtain the Year Pass.

I sated to my friend that stands for happy ela day
---
There's no way in hell you'd get his turret setup... You need an entire football field to even have a chance of an acceptable placement
---
dont bother,its fixed
---
this was just patched.
---
Ela is pretty balanced rn according to win delta amd pick rate tho, her gadget is strong enough to compensate for her poor weaponry imo.
---
Hmmm, weird. Could it be your internet maybe? Try another multiplayer game and see if the same issues persist. It could also be NAT issues. I had that a few times

unfortunately, this will be patched soon, so....
---
Probably low. They're getting about what I get with mostly low settings on a GTX 1070. Most people playing competitively would probably recommend frames over high settings.
---
Too bad. All decisions from Ubisoft are final. Their system is perfect
---
Shit guys, it's Havoc!
---
&gt; cant seem to decide on a defender main
---
good. you shouldn't have a "main". you should have a handful of operators you're good with
---
you can WHAT
---
It could be your hitting the point where you need to start finding a squad
---
Or you could have gotten into your own head and just need a week or two off to recharge
---
Indeed. It was quite secret until people wanted to get views and made it public
---
It's kinda ignorant to think that only young siege players don't know about it. I'm from Europe and I've never heard about this incident nor has anyone in my family
---
Mains are dumb and for inflexible players that are too lazy to learn the game
---
Also a fantastic drone spot up there
---
i still cant believe they nerfed lion noted that i dont even have the operator it's still a shame
---
Amongst friends we always referred to this as Operation: Elephant Dick
---
Thats why i said main in quotation marks my guy bc its really just a go to when all roles are filled on the team
---
Yeah I still dont know how to do it. Had a random do it during casuals. Spooked me pretty hard
---
Facebook and Instagram are what she uses, lazy_chaoz üôÇ
---
This is what I thought of the first time I played on this map.
---
Just play any op and sit under a window tbh
---
I used to main her her mpx is such a pea shooter though
---
What‚Äôs the gridlock nerf?
---
As much of a problem as people gaming the system with huge rank discrepancies is today, I actually think the scenario I described under the new system would be much more prevalent. It seems we'll likely just have to agree to disagree at this point.
---
Agree! They should rework this map, do some tweaks to improve the flow as they're doing with kafe :D
---
Why? :(
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised he didn‚Äôt
---
Do you want new eyes sir?
---
Jager or lesion. They help your team on just about any site.
---
Agressive but not like a roamer agressive usually i stay in rooms near obj or choke points to obj but never really flank ops and roam a lot unless that role needs to be filled on the team which is very rarely since everyone is kill hungry and wants to get a roaming ace
---
This should have way more upvotes for sure
---
I hope you‚Äôre not placing your plates at the other side of the map
---
Maybe next year :)
---
It‚Äôs my E.D B Day!!
---
It‚Äôs a good start, some dummy goes to look in the  one on top and you blast his legs
---
Esports ready
---
Yea ive thought about lesion too just cant seem to get a playstyle down for him
---
fuck off faggot
---
If you can't carry, it's entirely luck and there's nothing you can do about it. I go into solo queue with the mindset that I need to be prepared for a 1v5. And ideally if myself and my random teammates are each ready to carry, then we should be able to win most rounds even without mics/much teamwork. Sometimes it works, sometimes your mates/you are just trash and you gotta hold the L. But my friends that I play this game with are borderline worse than randoms anyway so I don't care lol.
---
I agree, 2 seconds is far too long for clash, but I wouldn't to have to face clash, and suddenly die for her because she shocked me and then used her smg to shot me. Maybe if they decrease to 1.40 or around that value would be better then 2 secs.
---
Also you have Tatcher and Zofia that can counter Clash, but you have to have a good timing to kill her.
---
TIME FOR SOME SERIOUS PROTECTION
---
If you attempt to crawl to the other bed from that top bunk it'll report you outside and show your location while atop the beds
---
I odnt get why people hate shields so much, sure blitz is oppresive but monte and clash are pretty easy to deal with. 1 v 1 no one should be losing against a shield if you know what youre doing. 
---
If the shield is working with a team mate and you're on your own its your fault anyway since taking a 2 v 1 is almost always a bad idea if you have a choice. If you have team mates then you just focus primarily on the shields mate without ignoring either.
---
It seems like a solid spot for pulse
---
Plot twist: they're all waiting their turn for the tip of her LMG-EEEEEEEEE
---
It's been done like 3 months ago
---
This isn't really new. I saw a video a while ago where you could get up there easier by using the mira trick. Buti guess it goes to show you don't need the mira trick if you're not a 1 speed.
---
The helmet is the same one thermite/castle is using. the visior is selfmade from bent plexiglass mounted with screws and that black thingie is 3d printed!
---
Stairwell Intel/denial... Or if you like to roam, you can close roam and use the needles as your flank Intel.

Understandable

Sadly the players being toxic isn't easy to fix, most mp games have problems with toxicity

And now this will be patched out in the next patch.

This is why mom doesnt ******* love you

The next update is removing this
---
what do you play on? if you want to i can pick you up and play for a little bit whenever i get the time, hopefully the forgiveness option will work out for the game, i've been concerned about the teamkilling thing for a long time, mainly because it seems like whenever i play hostage people intentionally fucking kill the hostage lol
---
you saw how he was moving

It‚Äôs preference

And let's have the Mp7 and 416 carbine have iron sights

You can actually go watch the original release footage at e3 on YT time stamp is 5:50 or so.

I wish castles gun could be better without buffing pulse aswell but i dont think thats possible. Maybe give him access to a different gun, but that would probably be too much effort.

With the new TK system of Season 2 which will come in ~1 month it'll be useless so yeah

I don‚Äôt see the problem

Can you still contest the area or plant (if there is a bomb there I forget)
---
Aye ya beat me to it.
---
Uses the laser as a guide where the muzzle is pointed. Over time gives you quicker reflexes and less mouse drag to flick to someonea head.
---
Hes pretty useful on some sites if you know what youre doing. I dont think every op needs to be viable on every site
---
It‚Äôs actually super effective, the recoil pushes up to the head, and kills em! That‚Äôs why I try not to control my recoil as much as others do, because it works to my advantage, same reason I use buck
---
Not a bomb room. No idea about secure

The miniseries Waco is also excellent. Very well done, and very accurate.

Yes

Only time ive ever killed someone for reindorcing is when i play mira and they wont listen when i tell them not to ruin the mira placement.
---
How?
---
Just, now it's done with Mira's portable AC-130- I mean, smg
---
m a v e r i c k
---
Does that not work on all bins? If not then why not?
---
Don‚Äôt rush out of spawn. And also I just shoot windows carefully when I spawn until they break and I verify no one is behind them.
---
Don‚Äôt take the moral high ground; this troglodyte above me is defending smurfing against new players. Recruit rush is not a start, it‚Äôs bad manners.
---
Woah
---
If you can get an interrogation off cav is great for the team, that depends on how good you are with her though
---
Mozzie is Australian though
---
? Do you mean only iron sights?
---
Allegedly they had illegal firearms that were fully automatic and unregistered, which is what caused the ATF to investigate and initiate the raid. They had zero concrete evidence from an undercover agent and unlawfully and unconstitionally raided the compound. I'm not saying the Branch were innocent or guilty, as I've seen no evidence. If there was any, it was burned in the fire. Another case of an overreaching government and people trying to defend their rights. They wanted to be left alone. Personally, I think Koresh was nuts, but he wasn't hurting anything or anybody.
---
What mouse are you using? I had a similar problem on a Corsair mouse a few days ago but it went away after updating the software

Thanks
---
Be careful with these kind of things. Positive reinforcement is the easiest way to build bad habits. Getting kills does not necessarily mean that you did the right thing, maybe the enemy did something wrong, was not paying attention, etc. If you create a lot of bad habits you will end up having trouble to rank up, as the opposing team will stop making these mistakes and you will end up having to "relearn" the game.
---
So does this happen the same time every year?
---
Cuz it's my birthday...
---
Prefire every window that has a hole in it
---
Tbh i just think c4 is amazing to begin with such strong gadget when used properly and her gun is a beemer
---
I mean you've been the one bitching thus far. I'm just showing all the benefits of PCs. I guess the only positive you've listed is that the ease of console setup is great if you're that mentally simple.
---
What's less noticeable is that the guy's aim is worse than a mobile player despite playing on PC.
---
And this is why clash should have never been added to the game
---
y
---
This is like asking for a medicine to fix all diseases.
---
Maybe look from the side of the devs? What can they do? Like teamkilling, how to differentiate between an accident and on purpose. Also how will people abuse a new system is also unthinkable.
---
q
---
There‚Äôs already a similar Fuze skin

How are there server rooms not on fire at this point?!?!

Ewww a super sweaty "I only play ranked" asshole. You're probably the kind of person that goes to spawn peak and gets shot in the head then leaves.
---
"yOu cLuTcHeD iN cAsUaL" so what? are the only people that play casual have only 1 hand? No they are normal people
---
Lmaooo they have 12,359 Elo, obviously not legit but that‚Äôs got to be a record.

Hammer time....

---
Clash seems like a good op, i have it, gave it a try but just couldn't get it work. Well i must admit I'm not good with neither monty nor blitz but clash being on defense is a nightmare if the player knows what he's doing
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/SSRCXeL
---
Turns out you can plant up there
---
But Clash is very situational. If they had communicated at all there is no way I would have won that.
---
Fookin laser sights
---
Small but little thing, make it so that it's fully covered and drones or anything can roll in. Simple yet effective
---
Seems like the vault glitches never work on console. One less thing to worry about I guess
---
Fairs my dude.
---
Would be cool if you actually made some skins yourself and showed them. You do realize it‚Äôs quite hard to make good realistic skins and models?
---
I think since the new change is a huge nerf maybe he could be the only attacker withmp5 maybe :)
---
Sure does! Happy birthday :)
---
I got really lucky with the alpha packs and got a twitch F2 black ice and Tachanka SMG black ice before level 40, don‚Äôt remember the specifics though
---
I've given out this answer before so I'll be brief:
---
At the beginning of Burnt Horizon, about 60 GB of data was trimmed off the game in general. 
---
I believe that the deleted 60 GB was unused and old game assets used at the beginning of the game. So bringing back Classic Siege would require the Developers to bring back those deleted assets. 
---
Thing is that if Ubisoft planned for an official Classic Siege event to happen within a year or so, they wouldn't have deleted those assets in the first place.
---
INB4 someone mentions the situations:
---
Those are different maps in their own right. For example, the first situation map is its own file, separate from the old Hereford. Those concrete barriers, fences, and bookshelves ***are*** part of the map, rather than a prop or modification to an existing map.
---
I would like a Classic Siege event to be a thing, but also put less strain on the development team overall. 
---
I have an idea that if people want to play Classic Siege, they would have to download all of those deleted assets once more, host the server themselves, and then those people could play Classic Siege, bugs and all.
---
I was about to say that,
---
Who the fuck runs rook with a reflex and then hold med-long angles.
---
While I think this would fit her character, I don't think she needs the buff.
---
The fact that she can do that spin move at all is the dumbest thing
---
A good attacker which I hardly see being played is capit√£o especially with his buff being released soon he will turn into a good strategist. Three speed, weapons are strong and have the same stats other than ammo, reload speed, and ads time, and ability takes skill and time to master but will be worth it.
---
epic
---
We said that after it was done üòÇ but she likes J√§ger more so he was in before we all realised bandit would have been far better
---
You mean nades?
---
Real question is do you trust your teammates
---
Thata it. I'm placing a frost mat there.
---
Ha
---
Go go power rangers
---
Happy cake day btw
---
Dunno why, honestly. Her guns are alright, she's got frags, and her ability helps the team out. Wish I had more opportunities to play her.
---
lol actually i use casual like most players and warm up my aim for ranked. you‚Äôre probably one of the people that died to a spawn peek then quits and whines about it. get lost little kid
---
Why thank you my friend üôÇ
---
Thats clearly ACOG pills and Doc just lied to J√§ger about not knowing what they were
---
I always wanted to go up there
---
Oh. My bad. I didn't believe they had the warrants.
---
Happens a ton to me on PS4, I assume it is just people that don't want you to get the kill
---
Twitch I feel her ACOG is leaving
---
That laugh tho üòÇ it was contagious
---
I don't believe though they actually demanded to be let in to search. My impression was they showed up and basically started shooting
---
No, nice shot
---
what could a thumbnail for this video look like?

Idk why but when I am in a four man my friends feel the need to vote to kick anybody joining even though they could help us.

Whenever I read "What are they?" somewhere I always gotta think of [Battlefield 2 Mine Subtitles](https://youtu.be/SIo3q-tcmk4?t=200)

I heard they were going to add something to stop crouch spam like a cooldown or something but crouch shooting would still be a big thing.
---
Tbh I would take it
---
i dont think so, its hard as fuck to do it
---
most people will probably give up
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
They did their part.
---
That's a common spot that's reifirced with bandit or kaid, this destroys 3 walls at the same time and opens up a huge hole

Absolutely beautiful üòÇ

Damn I was gonna post it again today but I'll just wait until tomorrow I guess

Rook should marry Maverick so he could be like

The constant crouch walking and wiggling for no reason definitely hurt to watch but good shit my dude this is sick!!
---
Mobile? It's on this comment chain lol. Main page or r/Rainbow6, 3 dots on upper right corner, set flair.
---
Maybe just maybe
---
You can do the same thing to reinforced walls if you go on the top and then bottom of it. It will remove the reinforcement and make the wall soft.
---
No problem. Also if you wanna do a prebuilt look into the NZXT BLD service. It will let you pick out the parts and all of that and only charge you a $100 dollar build fee.
---
macron?
---
Sorry to tell you, but a large part of the community is pretty toxic. Some guy tried to vote kick me in t-hunt because I got the op her wanted. He proceeded to harass me the entire game.
---
Custom flair gang
---
Did they directly mean to do this? No it‚Äôs a fucking bug.
---
Sweet. Ill look into that.
---
Now go ahead and pass those plates around. Customers are coming!
---
Shut
---
I could be totally wrong but I remember Havoc being the name of the player and not any specific operator because I think Ubisoft thought rivalries would start to form between teams playing siege
---
I‚Äôm not sure you understand what a bug is
---
first of all it was a joke dummy, second of all i uploaded it straight from xbox, and third what did i spell wrong? youre such a faggot you had to reply and act like a dick; get a life
---
I honestly wish they kept with defenders being terrorists, it would be interesting to see how those character would be written as, but I can see why they ditched it, you don‚Äôt really want to be a video game that advertises terror groups to its audience
---
Mines gotta be blitz in T-hunt its a convo btw
---
Blitz:Anyone bringthe spare ammo?
---
Other op:No 
---
Blitz:Well then

Imagine a ugandan person saying thatü§î

Thicc skulled my friend

I honestly don't remember, if I had to guess I'd probably say yes because this was the first day the map was out and I had no clue where anything was.
---
Why post it??? Just to ruin people‚Äôs games for the ass hats that choose to do it?
---
The lag is gone lmfao
---
Cav
---
I don't think it's that simple though.  Government agents had information that there was a cult which was abusing children and stockpiling weapons.  They did their legal due diligence to secure the appropriate paperwork beforehand, when they were attacked by the cult.  They can't just back down and leave them alone after that, because it would embolden other cults to just shoot at government agents whenever they want to harm kids.  So, like any determined agency, the ATF fought back with the help of the FBI, and right as they were about to secure the compound, the Branch Davidians started three fires and hijacked the narrative to be one of government overreach rather than cults literally doing what cults always do: maintaining control over their members to the point of death.  These weren't a group of innocent people minding their own business and legally purchasing firearms.  This was Jonestown part 2: Texas Boogaloo, starring David Koresh, the monster who'd rather burn children alive than get arrested and fight his case in court.
---
Sledge and hibana are also in my pc. üòÇ
---
How much connection is there between the real world and siege? Lmao
---
Get echo or Capitao, others can wait, but those two have too much utility

It just promotes a toxic environment and almost always just leads to more tking and ends in a wipe in my experience.
---
Can literally only use her shotty.

Nice acce but sry no respec for using p90

Why are you asking us? You either like it or you don't..

Siege was released before that even happened.

Most of the time it's dumb luck and practice. a lot of the spots I'll struggle with for 10 mins in a custom game and then be able to do it 100% of the time

The best is when assholes shot you just to do just enough damage but not kill you.

---
Oh yeah, it did. Well don't I look foolish. I wonder why they picked Oregon. I guess it really was just them throwing a dart at a map.
---
In my experience, mostly at Gold 1, an interrogation can cost the defending team just as much if not more than it helps a lot of the time. There's been dozens of times my team has had an interrogation and then everyone was to go chase kills and I end up like 1v3 out of nowhere or something.

Because of this, I'm required to say Alibi.

Luision doesn‚Äôt kill. It‚Äôs whole point is to down players so you can interrogate them
---
It's nothing but smurf accounts. I have checked it out. My buddy that bought the game on sale tried to play it but it's purely nothing but assholes. Your seriously better off playing casual as a new player.
---
It's why as much as friendly fire adds to the tension in a game like this I'm usaully against. It just lends itself to shitty toxic behavior. And why a big part of me just wants ubi to remove it from ranked. And just leave the ability to accidentally destroy Friendly devices and the hostage. Because while it adds to the game without a major punishment for it a lot of people will just abuse it because they're a fucking dick with the temper of a 3 year old.
