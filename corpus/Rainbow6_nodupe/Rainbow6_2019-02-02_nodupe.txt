You know there's more to maestro than his gadget, right? And Echo's two counters are the least picked attackers that both have to get pretty close and lucky to defeat his drones.

---
Its pointless to crouch this fast, you will spam into a headshot
---
The recoil of the smg 12 and the rate of fire of the dmr
---
Don't be a toxic douche and you won't have to worry about it.
---
Its acc lucky af
---
I remember that, I miss it!
---
I'm confuze
---
a good gun doesn't mean he's overpowered.
---
Enable steam overlay in the settings. 
---
Oot
---
Also debrises shouldn't be client sided. I see people running through a barricade or shooting through a full barricade.
---
 Vertical and Flash, if you want the best choice in terms of a recoil
---
How
---
Silently correcting your grammar 
---
my uncle looks like pulse too 
---
If you get revenge then get banned. If it's ranked let them kill you so they get banned or leave the game. It's pretty fucking ez 2 not git banned
---
And my day is ruined
---
Yo that's so cool wtf 
---
This is the same problem I have. The thing you need to understand is that as far as gameplay is concerned, Casual and Ranked are in different video games.
---

---
The amount of team cohesion and communication required to be consistent in Ranked is unthinkable in Casual. Also Casual is a shooting range, but gunskills are secondary in ranked
---
Try working on operator synergy with your team and communication with either strangers or the people you play with.
---
This got me good
---
C28A1 mounted and loaded.
---
I had the same issue with this and the Divison discord. I got better teammates that actually communicated from solo queuing more often.
---
What‚Äôs with the red balloon in the top right hand corner
---
Join during pick phase
---
whats wrong with all these backgrounds lmao.
---
I know its not a huge deal but wtf :D
---
Nah id rather get banned than not play becuase of team killers, im just asking how long it'll take until i get ban cooldowned
---
Your father looks like 'Johnny Sins'.
---
It‚Äôs not thousands, only hundreds 
---
Tom and Jerry
---
Firing rate shouldn't be an issue with the DMR - try to stop spamming it and really be careful about your shots.
---
The SMG-12 is a shotgun unless you're bursting heavily. Try to only use it in close quarters. You're probably better off with the CZ in either case. The SMG-12 has been pretty unpredictable since the nerf
---
Although women are funny 
---
But at the same time it makes it less special since everyone will be using it
---
well i suggest not to use the other secondary and just pull down on your mouse and hope for the best. the dmr is better than the shotgun, the rate of fire of it is slow, but there is hardly any recoil. it‚Äôs pretty satisfying to get kills with.

Weird, i normally use twitch/thatcher, i got all 15 in one match as twitch (some really awesome enemies, placed all gadgets down for me)
---
Thats also true
---
I joined mid pick and it automatically gave me recruit even though you wouldn‚Äôt be able to pick him normally in the SI mode
---
It's already enabled, but it still won't open with shift tab. It never has opened for me before.  I think uplay would just open it in it's own browser and thats how I was able to buy stuff before.
---
Lmao

Big Tachungus don‚Äôt @me

Thanks üëç

Im level 51, im bronze (i think) becuase i havent played ranked in a while and i mostly play on xbox

Valkyrie is a support player. Her utility and gadgets (if used properly) are HUGE for a team with good cohesion. Ela's gun is very very good in close quarters and her gadget great for op hunting.
---
Think of Valk as discount Echo, and Ela as high-recoil jager
---
¬†&lt;3

Aye this games physics are weird siege does what siege wants ü§£
---
Ok get perma banned and never play again. And it doesn't go back down for months. It think it's like 6 months with no bans for it to go from 7 days to 3 day bans. Honestly it's not hard to not get banned in the game and I play everyday. If you're at a 7 day ban then you're probably doing some toxic shit and need to not play the game anyway.
---
The G36C is a headshot MACHINE change my mind
---
looks like my 7th grade social teacher(ur dad)
---
For every weekend of the event there's a different one. The last two are yet to officially show up in the game. 
---
Are u serious is there any way to link my Steam account with a diff ubisoft?
---
I do my best with callouts. I still need to learn the names of the rooms.
---
"YAY wel dun Alibi you shute very gooood"
---
Some of them have blue lights on front some of them have red lights.....
---
Just kidding:
---
Twitch‚Äôs Shock Drone no longer displays any light.
---
Atk drone:
---
Red light: Someone is actively viewing it you will only be identified of a scan if you have been scanned and that goes for all observation devices.
---
No light: No one is currently viewing it.
---
White light: Vigil is in the area and his ERC-7 is deceiving the drone.
---
Def cams:
---
Red light: someone is actively viewing them.
---
Blue light: It is one of Valkyrie‚Äôs Black Eyes and it has either just been placed or someone is viewing it.
---
White light: Dokkaebi has control of defenders‚Äô cameras and an attacker is viewing the camera. Will also happen to Valkyire‚Äôs Black Eyes.
---
Lul. Perfect game
---
It would be nice if CTUs could share weapons, M9 could be usable by the Italians, Americans and Brazilians. Deagle would be usable by Seals and GROM. As cool as it would be, it's a balancing issue.
---
My favorite is when Thermite breaches right next to and I dont know until the wall behind me is gone and I either die from the blast or die from the confusion of losing almost all my health and then dying to someone who was waiting for the charge to go off. 
---
The drones get a blue/white light when their being affected by Vigil's  ECR-7 video jammer on his back.
---
This is actually really cool.
---
Ah thanks 
---
But you were the ash correct? You couldn‚Äôt fill Hibana/Thermite?
---
Russian badger is good but he‚Äôs not the most consistent 
---
Thanks man!
---
Lol no 
---
You about to get rule nined bro
---
Then give him like 4-6 auto-spotters. Like a trapper, but only provides intel
---
How so you get to play this game mode I'm really confused
---
You know, it's been almost 20 years already since early 2000's
---
He's too much of a force to be reckoned with 
---
Hats discounting and gives me the creeps but cool
---
I'm pretty sure pengu is a consistent streamer. Same with narcolepticnugget.
---
She‚Äôs looking at some Amitriptyline. 
---
My friend got recruit because he loaded in late after everyone had picked. 
---
Nice
---
Macie jay, pengu, King George, beaulo are prob the best 
---
Yea plus people report for suspicous kills too.
---
Isn‚Äôt the Blitz elite based on 1940‚Äôs German Panzer tanks? At least that‚Äôs what it seems to me...or is it a later model tank?

My only problem with it so far is that I haven‚Äôt been able to get into a fresh game while solo-queuing, 
---
I know that‚Äôs my issue but still! 9 matches in a row so far, coming in for round 2...
---
When is the next patch? 
---
Kinda looks like the Tachanka turret
---
I see what you did hereü§£ now I wanna watch Tom and jerryüôåü§£
---
Because road to SI is right now and has monetary value, while three months ago this mode didn‚Äôt exist. 
---
FBI open up!
---
It does to some people. It's really dumb to care about it though especially when this is a game where Intel is powerful and a lot of people dedicate themselves to gathering intel, playing objective and helping their team rather than focusing on kills
---
Lmao we were on top so we did it üòÇ my team was copper
---
Oo maybe this is a ~lion~ rework and he puts them down and then when he activates them it does an absolute fuck load of spots for 5 seconds, kinda like an anti flank sorta thing 
---
My guess would be it‚Äôs all electronic gadgets, as Kapkan‚Äôs traps and J√§ger‚Äôs ads count towards it 
---
Yeah but lion hit him with 3 flashes when he was DBNO and he ate all 3 of them

The zoom was glitched, but the sight actually looks good. You can see around you
---
he means how the sight is backed up from the user camera, allows for more peripheral vision around the sight 
---
Why does it look like Finka is trying to imitate the PogChamp emote?
---
Like the killcams, vital in a game like siege
---
I haven't been able to tune into one of his streams recently.. Please tell me he's memeing and hasn't actually became a crouch spammer.. Please?
---
Please make this the norm in ranked. Current ranked is in beta. This is polished, solid, and can be molded to further better the game.
---
Lmao this guys so triggered 
---
Buck get off your damn phone it‚Äôs time for pictures
---
Get your finger off the trigger m8!

Nice though

Nah, but Finka does love that Tachanka meat though

Funny when you're listening to "sour girl"

Alcohol.
---
Take away ten rounds and give her back her impacts y tf she have a shield
---
Flashes only deal 5 damage on hit. Downed operators take 20 damage to kill.
---
I got my first legendary a few days ago, it was an ugly Lesion shotgun skin... it was annoying since I dont even have lesion unlocked as well. Big oof, would of rather wanted credits to unlock a new op
---
I have the same one
---
There is only one rule to solo queue ranked and that is this: you absolutely must not give a single fuck about your rank.  Just play for the joy of the game and the 3 minute round timer.  Even in teams of 5 people using their mics in plat, nearly every game just comes down to fragging out with no strategy whatsoever, so you're free to just pick whatever you want and have fun.
---
If you aren't playing in a 5 stack, you and everyone else in the game are just playing Casual.  The frustration and lack of enjoyment comes primarily from being over invested in the game in a situation where you never had a chance to play competitively to begin with.  
---
*bass boosted all star plays*
---
Ubisoft will NEVER put pick and ban in ranked, because then what's the point of operator if it isn't picked in rank, ubisoft wants us to pick and play all operators in both casual and ranked
---
BUT, they should give this as another game mode
---
You could‚Äôve done that with any op tho
---
I did. Getting married to her in April. 
---
Cav echo lion mira 
---
U/kjgjk
---
No
---
u/kjgjk
---
Yeah that'd be pretty cool. I always thought he never got something like that because they didn't want to just give a defender an LMG but them Maestro happened so idk what the thought process was when making Tachanka. 
---
A perfect example of why not to use the dmr
---
They even got the shields hit box correct
---
Those are fighting words
---
Agreed. Total shitpost. The other side actually shows the card faces and it looks awesome. 
---
Looks like Quiet
---
K
---
Someone who‚Äôs player since alpha, I love OG hereford 
---
Hey you know which op it‚Äôs for? I have check my ops but nothing
---
Odd flex but okay
---
CPU intensive games such as rs6 which output high fps don‚Äôt run too well on a 4c 4t processor. You‚Äôll most definitely get 100% cpu usage unless you cap your fps. I had the same problem with my i5 6600k.
---
I think it was in the 70s when it first came out but they nerfed it. My guess is too many people were relying on it over Kaid's AUG. 
---
No no, fuck no. Why the fuck do people have such a orgasmic infatuation with this? Oh it's something new, replace it with the old one.
---
Obviously Tachanka 
---
I just remembered the whole scene... But guessing who is replaced Jerry's uncle place!!..
---
what the actual fuck
---
Same I bought starter too and only have 6 more ops total to get
---
See guys, Cav isn‚Äôt ALWAYS terrorizing people.
---
It‚Äôs the face paint isn‚Äôt it?
---
They still shouldn't be playing mk
---
 Yeah I know that, but I‚Äôm only a couple months into the game and most of the people were higher level and rank than me so I think it‚Äôs pretty cool.

text chat is super autistic

It's  bankable offense until your good sit down

Nice.

Nothing to worry about just restart.

All I'm saying is not everyone enjoys bomb..

I wish this was the new ranked, but I ALSO wish Secure area was included.

I got this charm like a year ago and I use it on everything,  but that‚Äôs the back it the charm

Someone edited this clip in windows default app?

Like how to first response is fortnite like that‚Äôs just sad
---
Jokes aside, I haven't played this game in a while, but I mainly solo queue. I can find it enjoyable but there are those days where every team I meet are just disgusting people who I swear only live to bring the salt out of you, or you just never find good players.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The highest rank I've ever gotten while solo queuing is Gold 1.
---
this gave me a good laugh
---
He ain‚Äôt seen nothin, they spawnpeek and runout every single round and I don‚Äôt think anyone in China can afford mics
---
A month later and still triggered.
---
Quiet mode can be active at the same time as performance, and caps your FPS so your PC Is quiet
---
Ouch
---
Maybe try uninstalling then reinstalling your graphics card drivers. I remember one time my card just yeeted itself into the abyss and i was only able to get 20 frames at lowest settings and res. After i uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers it just fixed itself.
---
I am a fuze main and I approve this ace.
---
Kanal is okay imo, I think the defenders need more than just the bridge to get between the main buidings

How dare you suggest that I pick No Ban
---
Totally

Yo this happened to me in small tower of Oregon the other day! Just bunched up into one little spot and I shot from a distance too. Some of my team saw it as well and we all just went "WTF" lol.

.........Finished each others sentances. Oh we arnt doing the thing okay :(

Dude I don't understand the hate here. Jeez. I'm just saying that the communication from my experience is the same in marvel movies. Like, the communication is cool because it works. It's not a negative post at all. Or sarcastic.

Alright thanks.

I haven't played Siege so much recently (have been playing some new games I got around Christmas time) but it's really fun to play with a pre-made group or a full party with mics. This game was designed around teamwork and communication and that's really where the gameplay shines.
---
But hyper threading is useful for some games.
---
What all do you plan on making?
---
How rare is the black ice skin? 
---
Well that didn't make any sense...try again white knights
---
That was epic
---
As a Finka main, I agree with this on a spiritual level xD
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Literally.
---
Epic,  but well respected and well looking
---
Yeah quite mode is off
---
I think it was coreross who did it but I know the video was still missing items from the list
---
Has been happening for few months now. My record ping is something +2500.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how acid works
---
See! You get it! Isnt it so cool when your buds are watching a camera for you and make a great callout that wins the game?? Or even in the heat of a rush everyone is just communicating so well you just win it. 
---
I really like the new map. I quit enjoy very large and maze-like maps. Makes the games more tense IMO.
---
You must destroy them in the events playlist for it to work

yes i get what those guy want with balance and competitive map but i just wish we could choose simply which map i want to play without having to exclude 2/3 of the map because i want more serious game (ranked game) other than the troll fest that casual can be where i can play all the fun map this game have to offer (Plane, House, BU, old Hereford,...)

Sam here man

Everyone 9 ping and destroys you

Yeh but imagine how I felt opening my S.I. pack to get a purple and it just be Pulse with some new glasses and an ear piece tho...

Thatcher is overused this weekend. He's the meta.

---
I dont understand the hate for Echo, he's not that hard to counter, especially since most of the people I see put their drones in not the best of places. Then again I only play casual so maybe he's some kind of demi god in ranked, idk
---
Maybe a PMC ? 
---
Maybe a fictional Company like the Corporation from Clive cussler‚Äôs Oregon file‚Äôs would be a cool idea 
---
Hi Sam.
---
neat
---
Garage was such a clusterfuck. I loved it.

It's only 3 rounds if you're shit at whatever you're doing first.
---
Hey

congrats... ;(
---
Ahhh so many good memories,my first ever ace...good old times
---
some poor bastard browsing the subreddit probably related to this a bit too well.
---
isn't Road to S.I like competitive though? You can pick your locations in there, right?
---
Not anymore.
---
Ya I exclusively play casual 
---
I find I just don't enjoy myself when playing ranked
---
OR we can **not** fragment the community.
---
Casual and Ranked are enough.
---
i was more excited when i got this than when i got a black ice for the m870 because i don't player jager or bandit 
---
I was in that game
---
Thanks!
---
Take out both. Both of them are shit. Original one had better floors however the staircase made it cancer for roamers. New one has two stairs so roamers aren't stuck/bound to one floor and a lot more versatility however the floors are fucking garbage, for example the top floor, huge fucking spaces with no real reason to reinforce and no cover for gun fights. These maps are ruined by one thing or another, worst reworks I've seen so far. 
---
How is it not better? Your op gets banned Mr. Ash Main?
---
y
---
I honestly dont know why they couldnt have kept the old one and had the new one. They were/are both good and fun maps in their own ways.
---
‚ÄúoH nO iTs ThE rOnG sIdE‚Äù
---
He probably just thought it was going to be a black ice opened it up and found 4 aces and was *disappointed* as it says in the title. He probably just took the picture right after he opened it. There was no strategic plan to get as much karma as possible by flipping it around, and it says nothing about not being able to see the fronts of the cards anyways. He just doesn‚Äôt like the charm that‚Äôs it. 
---
I'm honestly surprised Kanal didn't get a rework first since imo it's a much worse map. I almost hate it more than Favela tbh.
---
Maritime police ect
---
It doesn‚Äôt count the placements. 
---
Step one: he plays 10placements 
---
Step two: he plays 7 more matches
---
Step three: he wins 6 loses one; 6.0 w/l
---
Yes my friend it does count the placements
---
Wasn't sure if glitch or they didn't know about the U key
---
So odd.. and my penalty just ended and it just said I was still in a ranked match? I‚Äôm so confused 
---
Why does she look like a kid named Garret?
---
U key? is that the default binding? Who would ever use that? :o
---
"You got games on your phone?"
---
Listen to the audio of the round. I'm not complaining about dying. 
---
Well...it never happened to me so, thank you and may Our Lord watch you from above haha
---
Unpopular opinion time!
---
In addition to the discussion questions below, I'm going to point out something too... I don't want to play on the map playlist. However, I do want to get the stupid cosmetic items. What this results in, and I am not alone here, is joining the playlist, and hunting drones(last week) or gadgets(this week), just to get it over and done with so I can stop playing the playlist and go back to playing Siege normally.
---
**Is the new mode fun?**
---
In short? No. It's basically a simplified, scaled down version of Siege, and I'm of the opinion that people here are simply excited to play with a new toy, rather than analyzing any merit to it. Or they're obsessive over pro-league.
---
**What is your experience with the ban phase? Which operators get banned the most?**
---
Completely arbitrary. If there's any trend, it's been the banning of operators that get meme-hated. Blitz and Lion primarily. Defenders are a bit more random, but in the end, it's often either meme-screwing-around(Got Tachanka banned earlier tonight.), or nonsensical banning of operators that are poorly suited to the map that's being played anyway.
---
I'm glad that picking "no ban" is starting to catch on, been seeing that a bit this weekend so far.
---
**Do you enjoy the attack/defense rotation? Is one side favored?**
---
No. I'd rather it alternated like in other map playlists. Variety is good.
---
**Does the limited map pool fit the playlist?**
---
Sure, why not? It's pro-leage-wannabe-mode anyway. Might as well cripple the game further.
---
**What is your opinion on the mode being Bomb-only? Do you enjoy the increased planting/defusing duration?**
---
See above. tbh, I haven't really noticed the planting duration changing. Most teams around gold/platinum and below are more interested in running and gunning, fuck the objective, get the K:D.
---
**Should this mode be implemented for Ranked play?
---
No.
---
**Should this mode be implemented for Casual play?**
---
**Should this mode find a permanent place in a separate playlist from Ranked or Casual?**
---
I don't see why not. It's popular enough, and Siege's playerbase has grown beyond the early objections to doing such making map queue times unreasonably long.
---
No moochers.
---
That looks to have been the second one. Wag is going to miss it, narrow shot onto Nesk but Nesk won't miss his and on full HP he's going to have full control of projector and, because of that, able to take down Julio. Psycho whips out the SMG pistol but the 'nade from Sexy will shut him down. Kamikaze'll be the last defender but he can't make it happen. What a round from Nesk and what a round from Liquid to take it.
---
It doesn‚Äôt, but why do you even care about this guys w/l lmao. Best case it doesn‚Äôt count the placements and it‚Äôs like I said, worst case the tracking site or siege or whatever is glitched or something, who cares
---
All good.
---
Thats the default binding and you're right, it's stupid, no one would ubi. 
---
Out of the game*
---
I don't get it, what is this
---
Try the reflex and flash hider on it, never spray unless they‚Äôre like shotgun range, always aim for upper chest or head and you‚Äôll shred people. 
---
I don't want Ghandi nuking me every turn
---
I think they're in the works, and since they already have models to go off of, it should be easier than making a brand new map.
---
*Although*..., to make them competitively viable, both R4NK3D (B374) and Pro League, is probably another story.
---
*cries in tea*
---
No. He just shows the backside for whatever reason. It actually shows the four ace cards from the front. 
---
Please don't
---
You just get stuck walking in a single direction and can't stop?
---

---
I have 400+ Alpha packs and no idea what to do with them because I don't care for cosmetics. Would like to gift them to people but Ubi says nope. :(
---
It's cheating, plain and simple.
---
Ubisoft can't do anything because the offenders use 3rd party devices that makes it read as a controller, so that's how they slip by. 
---
The lord Tachanka? Yes praise him, he is the true divine xD
---
This, while the end of round plays by default have an option to click to watch your killcam, I often find I skip killcams because they take too long to show and that's time I could be helping my team on cams and whatnot.
---
I swear finka looks high. 
---
who tf doesn't like house?
---
There‚Äôs always that one asshole that has to shit on something even though mostly everyone likes it.
---
Mmm. Gimme them feet
---
That's Thatcher with his Invitational skin though...
---
Yeah, this is actually a great idea, being able to download this maps and play them in custom, terrorist hunt or casual!
---
Iq also really good
---
Yea u got the wrong folder /press windows key+r then type %localappdata%, look for siege
---
Theres that cosplayer on IG @not\_pulse who legit looks like Pulse and is an IRL FBI agent or something. I forgot what he does exactly.
---
Thats where the game settings are 
---
This was the better version
---
No, dont give people random buffs based on their model or lore. Its already stupid enough that grzmot mines affect zofia less than other operators
---
I can agree with how the rounds work. A ranked game would feel really off/unfair-ish going 3 rounds attacker/defender in a row. If they changed that, added kill cams, and added the normal ranked maps, I would be fine with this.
---
I heard the whole conversation yet no words were spoken. beautiful.
---
But you still have the old Hereford textures and assets because you can still play on it in the first situation. I dont think they did it to save some storage space.
---
I swear finka is actually under a curse which changed her from a pug to a Russian
---
I love winning against trashtalkers
---
Wait no fuck its not there
---
Thabks dude, I dknt hate the new hereford because it opens up a lot of verticle play for slege but i agree, its hard to defend
---
Me. 
---
The one on the r6 main screen
---
Thats is ubi
---
make one on doc please and how much?
---
Cant they just do serverside maps? Sure there'll be a load time but it's not like we aren't already waiting for the last guy and his hamster to finish. Also I'm not sure thunt even works offline but I guess you'd have to pre download any you plan on running.
---
You can enter from any of the outward facing windows, and the upper balconies, as well as the elevator shaft. The map has tons of possible entrance points. Entering the map isn‚Äôt its issue.
---
Thatcher all day. Operation nimrod! 
---
That's how ranked works too. You said it's better than ranked and then that it still needs to be improved before it becomes ranked. That's silly. Why not add it now, and then polish it more later? If they have palpable improvements there's zero reason to wait to implement them
---
Any frogman unit would work great. SEAL's have already been put into the game, but many other countries have their own special units.
---
His primary is a shotgun
---
yes in his invitational uniform
---
I liked the old one much more than the new one . Also it was the firat map i really know and became good on i just want it back .
---
There are people who control it with acog at a distance but not on console 
---
Who the actual fuck says tower is good? Lol. Bank, Consulate, Oregon, Border, Coastline are all really great maps.
---
Note: This is just an idea, don't need to post mean comments
---
yeah man it's so good to shut them down when u got the upper hand
---
Yeah, great, good for you, but when people do that all the time I can only wonder if people are retards to actually consciously enter matchmaking, get put into a game, and then decide to leave and fuck over everyone that's trying to play. 
---
If you don't want to play a match, just do everyone a favour and simply don't enter matchmaking.
---
low end gpu 720p
---
it only sets off my Trypophobia.
---
Agreed we need classic Hereford back
---
That's terrorist hunt, protect hostage is super annoying 
---
Yeah I'm a little more Aggressive.
---
Ash about to hit a nasty whip..... I‚Äôll see myself out 
---
I liked it and it was fun. But the new one is so much better
---
They finally added doors to this game.
---
Next map confirmed to be a house in Budapest
---
I get the purpose, I just think some people are stupid for getting into matchmaking for a game they never really wanted to play, or just play to ruin it for others [teamkilling, gadget wiping, etc].
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well
---
You want to motivate people to grind for lootboxes? Smh
---
FORMOZA or a scandinavian one would fit.
---
I want Club out of ranked. Worst map by far
---
Get a mic and ignore the assholes. I'd also suggest you look for other newbies online to play with, even if it's just one or two other persons. This game was not made to be played solo. You will simply not have a lot of fun playing this game solo in the long run. 
---
Actually I could use it even in ranked
---
It‚Äôs about how Six (John Clark, played by Liev Schrieber in the film Sum of all Fears) sets up Team Rainbow alongside the soldier Domingo Chavez (protagonist-ish in most of the previously R6 games). Throughout the book they fight a environmental extremist group that wants to do a snappening. It all takes place in the same universe as the Jack Ryan books (Ryan universe) and it‚Äôs only the first book where Rainbow  plays a part. Later in the series, they are kinda fighting in a war for USA.
---
Nah, she's good. Playing her with a compensator and an angled grip and the first ten or so bullets are easily managed
---
She could get her impacts back. But tbh i like the gun 
---
I hate the new one as I love R6 itself !
---
Nah. 
---
Shield belongs to this game (because anti riot teams are here e.g: SWAT, GSUTR, 707) but yeah chief, DMR is one of the hardest sell in this game, like atleast in glaz case, he has a chad russian sight families and a good thermal scope, but in many case DMRs are just memes. LMGs are a much harder thing to consider, because some fits the character (like fuze &amp; zofia being a crowd oppressor/chaos maker) but some just dont make sense, at all (on clapitao memetao, doping russian girl)
---
Me too
---
And didn‚Äôt Ash‚Äôs Elite come out before Outbreak? She just got a recolor as a promotional item when Outbreak was live.
---
Ofc its the guy with ela flair that says this.
---
Hello NobylWarrior, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/amd5fy/simple_tachanka_rework/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah see that stuff is toxic bullshit. Leaving a game of casual just isn't toxic. They're literally allowed to leave is they please... That's why it's casual.
---
People can leave to go deal with their kids, or to go make food, or to go watch YouTube or literally anything else. There's a plethora of reasons to leave a casual. 
---
Fuck, I leave casual if I get slapped into Favela or Tower. Am I hell playing those trash maps.
---
If you killed the hostage, I'd probably kick you too.
---
Yes please. 
---
Casual should have _ALL_ maps and variations available.
---
That means Bartlett and Old Hereford (tbh i had way more fun in old hereford than in the new one) and it means having both day and night maps. 
---
If you dont like a specific map, just leave the match. 
---
 Also; pick and ban in ranked and chosing starting locations in casual.  
---
miss this hereford a lot, new one is very boring and not fun to play 
---
Fortress isnt that bad. New hereford is just boring tho. 
---
Yeah, i really dislike the new version.
---
The first version was clean, easy to understand, balanced and looked good, not like this monstrosity we have now.
---
Sam, go home
---
It's still in the game, so there really isn't any reason not to do this.
---
Except for the name being the same as the new one. Could just name it "Classic Hereford" or something.
---
Agreed. My enjoyment of the game dropped so much when they removed the first 8 maps. 
---
PLANT GANG 
---
I disagree.  Nothing kills a game faster than being stale. Playing the same few maps over and over  make it stale. I miss the old maps 
---
It's one of those things where hes god tier in pro play, and even in high elo, but in low elo, nobody can play him well enough for him to be that good. But "it's what the pros do" so you know that not only are they going to play him, they're going to ban him.
---
So you can queue for ongoing matches but you get more renown for winning or losing?
---
I agree. The game has been going downhill since the new ranked map rotation. 
---
R6 will bever be CSGO and they need to stop trying to be. 
---
I can confirm, each extra pack gives you 300 credits
---
I‚Äôm sorry you have nothing to flex with like she can
---
Doka is fine imo, she has shit weapons and i tend to use the ring tone to my advantage at times to draw the opponents in a trap. Lion really freezes you in place and as an anchor main, that's terrible when you know they are breaching and you're basically stuck
---
LMAO "I can't learn proper map rotations" starter pack
---
Well then Casual exists for you, it has nearly every map.
---
Ranked should be for balanced settings and maps as to best reflect player ability in the outcome of a match. 
---
If you join ongoing match and lose, increase alpha pack chance percentage by 3%. If you win and get an alpha pack roll (but dont win a alpha pack) give 100 extra renown.
---
Well, you would be free to fire more bullets if you knew you could resupply them to be fair.
---
Oh god I forgot about that shitty PR Friendly excuse.... " data limits" lol
---
And they brought back Favela to Casual, SMH
---
did they kill your dog?
---
Just bring in doc
---
*insert But why gif*
---
Yeah.
---
I cant either. Test on your phone cause i could do it there but not on my pc.
---
That actually a really good idea
---
At least, it's a date
---
I m surprised thatcher is picked so much at the moment... usually people do not like him too much üòÇ
---
Special Boat Service.
---
Ubisoft games are also notoriously large, and R6S is a prime example of that. It has no right to be upwards of 60-70GB in space, considering there isn't that much content in the game (in terms of models and textures, etc.)
---
Ghost Recon Wildlands, which is a huge open world game, occupies a similar size as R6S. It's insane how bloated Siege is.
---
Tachanka reworks are memes son, ain‚Äôt nothing gonna happen to the lord.
---
And you realize that you heart pounding the moment after you kill em and reloading
---
I really wanna get back old hereford base. The new one is terrible. Who did it and I don't really know how I can be changed it 
---
What weapon is that? I know it‚Äôs a seasonal pack and can be equipped on every gun but damn that gun looks stunning with the skin on!
---
It makes perfect sense for what he's supposed to be.  Akin to a German soldier in ww2 holding down a beach with a mounted gun in a bunker. 
---
I asked my enemies to do the same later in the round but they said fvck u and that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair.
---
Hahaha no.
---
Yes noted after 2 or 3 match :D thanks anyway
---
Although in casual this is still a decent thing to accomplish, not any player could get a 10.0 kd regardless of how dumb or not the enemies may be
---
There was one staircase. The only floor with a corridor was top floor, and once the balcony wall was open, you couldn't use it anymore. There wasn't a single rotation on the map, and if you did try to rotate, you had to hope and pray you didn't find yourself in a crossfire.
---
Old Hereford was and is a terrible map. With only 1 somewhat viable site (basement,) the map is quite literally just as bad, if not worse than Yacht.
---
Prefer not to answer
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more 
---
F
---
If on mobile there are three dots in the top right
---
LULW
---
Operators I do not have
---
Attack: Blackbeard, capit√£o, dokkabei*, lion, finka 
---
Defend: maestro, alibi, clash, kaid
---
Stolen from r/dankmemes btw
---
Nice!
---
I mean, if i had such lan party, i would do that(sadly i don't have enough room for that, or friends that have ":D")
---
Just rush as clash pepega
---
Kaid or maestro
---
Ummmm how about no
---
Will consider it 
---
We know where the head is on console too, bruh 
---
Casual player reads all of this: 
---
Ignore all of the above‚úîÔ∏è
---
Can confirm
---
It's D-Day all over again ! 
---
How about yes
---
ü¶Ä
---
I play aggressive: Blitz, vigil etc. If that helps 
---
I would say Maestro for cams and guns or Lion for guns and how you can play him any way possible.
---
Go on the subreddit and click change user flair
---
Went from thermite main to finka main monka
---
I wholeheartedly agree
---
Oh god, this, a friend came over and opened a black ice skin while I was out of my room and he's too new to remember what gun it was for. I have less than half the roster, and it could be one of dozens. 
---
TELL ME WHO TO UNLOCK NEXT UBI PLEASE ;-;
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Wait, two setups and no one is playing? I larg confuz
---
No i think they dont.
---
Went for a snack break and I took the opportunity
---
Haha calling Tachanka the Lord is still funny, right? Right guys? 
---
From nostalgia, I like the map. But looking at it objectively, new Hereford Base is magnitudes better. It's really grown on me the last couple months and I appreciate it a lot more. 
---
I love how it just zooms in over him lmao
---
Or thicc boy rook
---
That's kind of sad and expected at the same time. Cannot fault Ubi for incompetence after all.
---
Better than house, plane, and favela? Yes, absolutely. Better than Bartlett or tower though? No, it isn't.
---
Lol
---
Budapest map confirmed 
---
No one likes her xD
---
Is that an instagram steal
---
This is where the fun begins
---
On console you have to burst fire just to get a semi predictable spray of bullets and as long as your enemy has more than two brain cells they‚Äôll know where you are and you get outgunned instantly. She certainly needs some kind of recoil rework. She is fine without impacts, barbed wire is always useful and her concussion mines are powerful. Recoil would balance her perfectly.
---
Top 10 cursed images
---
I had tons of fun on Bartlett. When you're winning that map was hilariously fun. But god forbid it sees the light of day again. That map is terrible.
---
It's trap 
---
No, you keep it after the season ends.
---
I thought default cams do count?
---
it should be in ranked too
---
This.
---
Im dissapointed
---
So like the old matchmaking preferences before they removed it for casual/ranked?
---
Tbh for me house was that map. Just a big family house. Easy to memorize and simple aestetics. Im a casual so this opinion probably wont mean much to most people in this sub but house is peak rainbow for me. 
---
Never ban Tachunks
---
No, you just can‚Äôt apply it to any operators that come out after Wind Bastion.
---
Hello Clank_16, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ame4jg/r6_si_week_2_challenges/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
im surprised you werent kicked
---
Capitao/ hibana and vigil/lesion. Was popping off with hibana and vigil in ranked earlier. Got myself to gold 2 through my placement matches. I run holo, compenster, and foregrip on caps AR and foregrip, suppressor, and reflex on vigil with impacts an the cz pistol rather than smg 12 (since it was nerfed to death)
---
I feel your pain, but the most pain i felt was getting a black ice for Buck‚Äôs ar and his pistol.
---
True, so many ops and it just takes so long to get the renown 
---
op there is a charm that you can buy for 1 renown
---
What am I supposed to be seeing here?

---
At least you have nice things to get duplicates of, my last pack gave me a duplicate skull rain
---
2 days ago I spent 180,000 renown on 50 packs and I‚Äôm already back to 20,000. No boosters just doing challenges and playing. Depending on what edition you got you should get all original operators and some DLC, you‚Äôre doing something wrong
---
I love that emotionless "wow lion go kill yourself" from the dude that mains Frost-Blitz.
---
Tachanka can lift 5 rooks at once and even then he is using just 0.0001% of his power.
---
We made this with my friends but when we were attacker deffenders blew up themselves and didnt place gadget. It hurts me still.
---
I play on PS4 and you can bully as much as you want because the Button does on console literally nothing it is just for as and our feeling
---
They are just bans an PC for toxicity but on console
---
Personally in my 950 hours of experience I never saw on play got banned in the top right corner what is just dumb in my opinion 
---
I personally didn't experience any toxic behavior like that when I was playing yesterday, and it took me less then 2 hours of normal gameplay on the S.I. playlist to complete the Challenge. There is no need for anyone to behave like that.
---
nice
---
r/screenshotsarehard
---
This is going down in history
---
not just 1 its 3
---
You'd say so? You underestimate Valk's power!
---
I've never seen any action taken from it, unfortunately, as well as I think people can abuse  their teammates in parties becuase there is no real backlash for it.  
---
I feel like the map design has strayed so far from creative maps to just making a big building with 40 rooms. Earlier on this game had very distinct maps: Plane, Yacht, Favela, House, Etc. Now you have Hereford and Fortress which are just two buildings with the colour scale changed 
---
Fuck yeah, bring back the truest of OG maps.
---
1. What?
---
2. Road to S.I. does not have leaver penalties, so you/your friend probably got banned for other offenses. 
---
3. What do you expect this subreddit to do about this? Open a ticket with ubi or a live chat or something. 
---
Why does she have a FUCKING BULGE WTF

No other operators gadgets work on teammates except for rook and doc, you don‚Äôt run into EDD‚Äôs and die or caught in welcome mats. Lions EE1D doesn‚Äôt work on teammates either (a completely broken op btw) and pulse is nothing like he was in the beginning of the game, he is one of the more underrated ops and I enjoy playing him. He is fine the way he is
---
 I can't buy credit, too.  On uplay buy credit is normally, but steam is not, they are locked :(
---
Just put it off in preferences 
---
Yeah, this happened on PS4, obviously, I feel like Ubisoft should care more about console players
---
You get 2500+ points for wining a game.
---
Boy you thirsty as shit.
---
And here I am getting TKd for picking twitch and having some kid just REEEEEE at me while we loaded in for not letting him have twitch then shooting me when round started

SEALs are trained for oil rig ops as well, but since we already have BB and Valk, Norwegian operators would be a good choice

Interesting. Do you consider Australia the West?

So 50% means you are still trying to win. Right?          
---
Do you think the people who play the playlist play for real? Or play the right operator for the right bomb sites?          
---
I have played about 30 games and not only 1 of them my teammates played for real!

Guys Tachanka carries a fucking mounted LMG on him at all times. Rook and doc got nothin' on him

Finka looks like a boy.

It's not about making sense realistically, it's about making sense from a balancing perspective. That's just like saying Maestro should be able to heal himself because he has medical supplies in his giant rug-sack, yeah it would make sense realistically but it would be absurd from a balancing perspective. 
---
Yes.

@BSO FUCKING LUTELY

Yeah

You gotta watch with repel spawns though we saw what happened on tower, and if your repelling up the defenders now also have a height advantage

Teams only ban Cav when they're not 5 stacked

Texas rangers
---
Now you see me
---
Where was this info from
---
I could be wrong, just worked well for the format lol
---
For the exact reason that it's not that easy to remember. It takes a lot of the fast paced tactical feeling out of the game when your running around a map that feels like it would be a better fit in a Call Of Duty game

The ALDA is the best, but it's less easy to use and less useful in some situations than the MP7, 416 or K1A, which are probably better all around. If you're playing long ranges and holding angles it's the best by miles though.
---
For a more active role, I'd go with the K1-A. It's good enough to stand along some attacker weapons, has good recoil and has pretty much no negative attributes.
---
I doubt it
---
Just found it thks though
---

---
Bandit mp7
---
What I mean is that of he has that shitty of a connection he is probably experiencing packet loss as well and there would be discrepancies between the client and server. 
---
Fair, I just felt the need to discuss my view and opinion as there are still other people out there who truly believe in mnk or do not have a full understanding of what it can do! :)
---
but definitely, allowing native kbm support and pairing with pc players would be hell cool and one hell of a time
---
I guess you‚Äôve never been stuck in copper hell, have you? They‚Äôd have to give you the same Elo every match otherwise there‚Äôd be a point where you needed to literally win hundreds and hundreds of matches to move up at all.

I am Canadian and I agree, we have room for more American operators! Lets not forget just how influential and powerful American CTUs are. They are the gold standard and all these other countries CTU‚Äôs are based off American principles and most likely trained by an American or an American was at least consulted for the program. They simply dominate this theater of war

No, please, no. Vaulting is already buggy through impacts/shotgun holes, preset cover mechanics I just hate.

You know, I recall people asking for a John Wick operator in another thread.  
---
But the more I think about it, John Wick would never last in Siege with all the lean and crouch spamming.
---
As some who likes maps NOT inspired by the labyrinth of Minos, I would enjoy it as well. In fact I would love a casual rotation consisting of just the 10 base maps, as God intended.
---
The sad part was it was the middle of when we were grinding gadgets and life fighting. Btw is uplay completely off for you?
---
You know the barrier glitch it‚Äôs that but with Mira so some people can see the Mira and others can‚Äôt
---
Yeah i've been reading alot of post of high ranking console players being frustrated when they face against mnk users, it saddens me when you spend alot of legit effort to obtain the rank and everything gets screwed over. Best of luck for your friend and you! :)

Have you tried restarting the game? That's normally required when redeeming a special pack.

I can count the frame rate of that on one hand lol

is this after the latest nerf?

It cost renown for the regular alpha packs. OP is talking about a menu to see rewards for regular alpha packs.  ü§î

I know, but there is no way anyone could be 100% sure of that. But if youve already got an account to borrow then have fun wih your friend

Yeah that lol

Thank robo

I personally don‚Äôt like IQ‚Äôs elite. Twitch and blackbeard‚Äôs are my favorite but I don‚Äôt own either of them because I don‚Äôt play those ops. I would personally get blackbeards but that‚Äôs only because I find the Vietnam war very interesting.

I feel you, I've 2 charms and doc headgear. There is still hope on something good, 2 chances
---
:}
---
Restart the game
---
Yes. While some people abuse it (And are rightly punished), it promotes trigger discipline. If you simply stopped shooting if an ally walked in front of you, you wouldn't need to call out that you're shooting down a hall, or busting a camera near spawn.
---
That would be pretty cool! 
---
And no one ever plays her anyway for me lesion is a much better ban
---
funny enough, i want that headgear. i own the doc outbreak uniform, goes well together.
---
Sometimes, the smoke effect keeps going in the replay instead of replaying the state it was when you were killed. So there you are seeing the current real-time state while you are watching the replay. Never trust a replay. 
---
The MK14 is pretty good if you get used to it, I even prefer spamming it over an AR.
---
Hiw about no? I play ela a lot (have since she came out, but I use shotgun) and even I think she is too strong with impacts, shes in a pretty good spot now. 
---
So pay them a fee, win win, we get the cool dead head logo and Ubisoft gets to help out a couple old pathetic men with mommy issues.
---
I think it would be dope to have an operator that if you are close enough you can execute them kinda like knifing someone but it‚Äôd be a cool animation.
---
5v5? You mean 5 man squad vs 5 solos = ez win for you = stupid ass ranked system (year 4 btw) triple A company btw
---
haven't played one but ok
---
came from CS with that casual demolition mode
---
that would fit in siege
---
Really if they out this into ranked people aren't going to ban randomly if they want to win and if bans are "meta" what's wrong with that anyway?
---
RIP Bikini
---
they ran in front of me it wasn‚Äôt my fault
---
After the first teammate died you probably should of stopped shooting 
---
Alibi? More like AliBRAWN! Look at those arms, or should I say guns!
---
My suggesting \*is\* a global flag on the client/player side.
---
Check it if you want all skins in-game to use default skins, leave it unchecked otherwise.
---
Simple, no?
---
Ya I personally am fine with whatever maps they make but there is always gonna be someone critiquing them
---
When I see BB with a tophat I automatically get triggered. Doesn't matter if that bastard is on my team or not!

Maybe dont shoot when team mates are running and control your bursts

Ubi map design team that worked months on the rework *am I a joke to you?*
---
The "engine" being the issue is bullshit, the amount of maps has nothing to do with how stable the game engine itself is. Otherwise my Gmod would be unstable due to the amount of maps I have loaded onto it. It just doesn't make sense, the engine isn't keeping every map loaded at the same time. 
---
It was late in the match and no one was running but they just got up and ran in front of me

It's not a nerf, it's a buff. Her pistol will still 2 shot at close range, but the range that it does 2 shot will be a lot larger.

You think people should just get renown without earning it?

The way that the club ubisoft challenges are implemented is realy poor and hurts the point of the playlist. So many people leave a game emediately if they get put on the side that doesn't allow the challenge to be completed. The challenges need to be devender and attacker independent.

Throw in Monties shield to make a real work out

You can also go up there from the table with the orange and blue tank, if you‚Äôre good enough you also don‚Äôt need to waste an impact on top of the arcade machine 
---
what are you on about? dont forget the dlc ops are 2x their amount.
---
350 renown a win
---
30mins a game
---
12500/350 = 35.7 GAMES
---
35.7x30 = 1070 MINUTES or 17.85/18 hours.
---
this math means that, in conclusion, it takes me 18 (about an extra 15 even from the 2k area) hours to earn one base OP, and 18 extra hours per DLC op for 36 hours per dlc character total. Mind you this gap is still there when they release new ops which continues to plague me for buying the starter edition. In ADDITION, it's called the STARTER addition I should be able to start on it and upgrade if i want without losing all of my progress.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be mean about it bro, I just noticed it chill. I thought it was cool so I put it up there‚Äôs no need to be a jerk

Ahhh that's a bummer 
---
Just yesterday it was me and my friend and a squad of 3 of chalet. Not a single team won a defend the whole game. Everytime we lost it was because all 3 of them roamed and died. One of them was cav and didnt get a single kill on a defend round.
---
He already has a biker bundle so they probably won‚Äôt do another one :( , but I really want Bandit elite.
---
It's most likely never coming back unless they rename it or something but I will miss being smoke on the 3rd floor and gassing anyone that dares coming up the stairs. Or playing bomb with a thermite &amp; thatcher with that one bomb location that has a wall right on the ground level and getting the Bomb placed right at where we breached so we could defend it from outside
---
In that case you have the dlc operators to unlock which are 25k each since the beginning of siege, nothing wrong there, 8 of them are even on sale for 15k, honestly 40 hours should be way more then needed for that
---
The lord isn‚Äôt really a funny meme anymore. I‚Äôm aware this title is on purpose and that‚Äôs fine.

Can we just admit that Ubisoft should get his rework going so he‚Äôs actually viable to play as?
---
Don't mind the amount of times i shot the dead bodies, had to be absolutely sure they weren't getting back up...
---
I always downvote them twice just to be sure.
---
I also like  M870 that
---
Ubi agrees that removing the ability for defenders to move for even that long is broken. For Dokka, its a lot trickier to pinpoint sound than a moving image across your screen.
---
I too enjoy when I meet his dad
---
This was nice
---
His shotgun is actually awesome once you get the hang of it. Basically a DMR on defense
---
Oh, okay. Anything to smoothen the texture?
---
I got a 1v4 at 1hp two dsys ago but it aint a 1v4
---
They can never get his proportions right. His op pic hand is creepily long, and in the invitational his arms are too big for his head in my opinion.
---
If you want to run and gun and ash gets banned they‚Äôre just gonna pick twitch or IQ and it‚Äôs the same thing
---
All of the operators can melee
---
They sort of have the blacklist function you're describing. In matchmaking preferences you can turn off maps you don't like and it decreases your likelihood of encountering them in a queue. Thr same goes for gamemodes.
---
I enjoy bomb when I have a full team to play with, but that's not always possible

Personally (as it's all up to personal preference) I run the holo on literally everything except things I can have an acog on (not including Bucl's C8 rifle which I have a reflex on). I'm just able to leave headshots way more often on reflex.

10 seconds tops, it's brutally long.

Im not 100% sure, but if it's like other multiple- editioned games, it should see that you upgraded editions and fix the unlock requirements.

Read the post for what the different arrows are and what they do. I like bows and I think it would be unique. I think that Ubi did a good job with how the bows work in FC5 but you couldn't just drag that functionality over without some balancing for R6. 
---
Interesting theory, could certainly be the case. You would think Ubi would make it so a banned op can‚Äôt be autopicked, but I guess they didn‚Äôt account for that 
---
I think you have to be on pc.
---
I mean I would use the P226 on Sledge because the L85 has plenty of bullets and a decent ROF. If you plan on using the M590, then I would run with holo because it's harder to be precise with the reflex.

It's an m9 not a 1911 I can understand the confusion in the new screen tho with only a part showing..
---
Haze would be op at bomb and useless in any other scenario because there is a counter for smoke maestro and the default bulletproof cam so he would negate this completely.
---
Hunter could be nice but he has to much utility just the gas and the normal or something would be enough for sure.
---
The bow problem is seen in bf even when it one shots u it needs a mass of skill and is easy counterable that's why capitao has no normal bolt it would be to op or useless 
---
Depends if you want a roamer or anchor
---
‚ÄúKnife fight??‚Äù
---
At least some agrees
---
actually, I wasn't aware of the huge gap between the standard and starter...
---
The retard comment isn't necessary mate

Donkey!
---
make it quicker? this was over a year ago. I'm just trying shed some light on the terrible experience I was given by customer support
---
for runouts and flanks
---
I played with a guy last night that had a leaning macro for his razer mouse so he would only run Fuze with the shield or Blitz because even if his shield was knocked away there was like a 90% chance he couldn't be melee'd if he activated it.
---
Tbh the gamemode is very good and people seem to be nitpicking it.
---
Why you telling every1
---
Are u stupid
---
They‚Äôve addressed this they couldn‚Äôt find away to do this without changing smokes colour to the stock standard Grey, Idk why I‚Äôm not a dev that‚Äôs just what has been said.

---
 nicely done 
---
Not once XD
---
Yeah like I get that but how often is it that those happen like that‚Äôs not a necessary part of the game but a defender got out the on OBJ or common entry points which are necessary 
---
Oh dude, cav did the same thing for me the other day, how sweet 
---
Your team didn‚Äôt get the point because you died first 
---
Oh thanks
---
Its all going to be ash spam and support ops like monty and capitao wont be as viable
---
I'm a level 53 and in the same boat. I'm not amazing at the game anyways, but some days I go like 5-2 and am at the top of my team, other days I'm on the bottom of the scoreboard and getting carried.
---
 Ummm
---
And that's what happens when you haphazardly buy shit without knowing what you're getting. Good job.
---
They did, his name was Kapkan
---
But it became a necessity once Ubi realized running out was a "strategy"
---
I need to see the lips
---
Its recoil is unaffected, so its still very good.
---
The Lord confirmed OP
---
Attacker use them as a way to cover run outs or put them so a roaming defender triggers it.
---
For the defence, there are already quite a few trap operators and not only that, a team could put a claymore in all corners  that prevent the attacker from any entry into the point.
---
Bro but cmon
---
No he‚Äôs not it makes perfect sense just take a second to think about it it would be more useful on defense to put at choke points where you think somebody is coming in and if they trigger it you know someone is there or was there 
---
All operators know each other. They're all part of the same unit R6
---
Almost 4hours every weekend cause thats all I can stand at this point, and 2h during the week. And the smurf was when I queued by myself
---
Pretty much one of the best if not the best shottie in the game right now.
---
What do you mean by removed?
---
I've died so many times because of this bs so now when Smonk pops his shit in front of me I just run away. This client side mess really makes you angry and paranoid.

General kenobi

I would want to play with the radius of the gas cloud to balance the poison arrow. I like the EMP arrow idea since thatcher has to pick up a lot of slack as is.

Masculinity is something every man has to define for himself. My definition has been influenced a lot by shounen anime and Jojos bizarre adventure, so I find it humiliating to be shown up by anyone really. If a bunch of bros are arm wrestling and a hot chick shows up and beats all of them it can be really humiliating. It‚Äôs not her fault and her being strong isn‚Äôt a problem. I actually find it extremely attractive, but it certainly wouldn‚Äôt make me feel good if she just showed up and beat me in front of my bros. Did I explain that well?
---
The challenges really do ruin it
---
You on PC? I can maybe give you some tips on where you go wrong.
---
I never see him played 
---
One big thing is getting a group. The siege community can be toxic at times, but I've met some great people. This will make ranked experience so much better. Both in how fun games will be and how consistent the experience.
---
Beyond that, to improve your game play you gotta practice. Not to stereotype silvers, but most likely your aim isn't consistent. Play classic t-hunt on house as Ash and spawn construction everytime. Rush main and play for kills not to win. With a little time it does wonders. I have friends in silver, and it dramatically increased their likely hood of winning fights. 
---
Next in ranked don't be afraid to record your game play and review it. Look at where and when you die in games. Next pay attention what each character has to do to influence the likelyhood of winning the round. It's a slippery slope, but watching streamers and proleague to learn things like how they get in site or aim can also help. Remember that it's a different environment, so learn from things. Don't just copy.
---
Lastly start simple don't aim for diamond start simple something like gold 4 then 3 and so on.
---
Definitely not as developed as Siege it is at the beginning of Year 2 whereas Siege is at the beginning of Year 4 so think of the game like Siege was during Velvet Shell for development.
---
The game relies on 3 class types, support, marksman, and assault.
---
 Marksman have snipers (or in Enforcers case an LMG with an ACOG), long range scopes, and can mark enemies locations from afar, and cover them helping out the team.
---
Support have flying drones to find enemy locations as well as having special abilities like Toxics (inspired by smoke) which floods an area with toxic gas to flush out campers, or Medic which can revive teammates with their drone. Support have weaker weapons and are best used with the support of assault.
---
Assault have great weapons, stamina and health buffs, and great Frontline abilities like Pointman who has 4 flash grenades and 2 frags, and is immune to flash grenades and suppression. Vanguard has sensor grenades that when thrown scan the outline of nearby enemies temporary to help the team clear out areas.
---
Overall Ghost War is fantastic but nobody knows about it or what it was, heck I didn't even know it existed for about 2 years as everyone knows the game for the Campaign. Oh and you can be downed unlimited times and picked up in a round, and the maps are a lot bigger.
---
What don't you think wouldn't work? The " aforementioned sarcasm " didn't elaborate on that.
---
Sounds like your biased against Blitz, he's fine right now. 
---
Bruuuhhh i meant to time love
---
Being able to click a button to say that TK was on purpose and kick the teamkiller would make the game ten times better. I would take the risk of getting kicked because of accidently killing somebody instead of dying three times in a row to a troop
---
Keep playing TH. As far as I remember they are not accurate with the site
---
Why's a smoke grenade  there?
---
Sometimes I could play 7 games in a row and sometimes I get bored after 2. It depends 
---
But even if you play 3-4 games a day, 7 maps become repetitive eventually and you want variety. It's not that bad here because the mode is only available on the weekends, but if this were ranked, it would get boring eventually and I will have to take breaks or play casual a lot.
---
There are maps I dislike too (like Hereford), but having those maps once in a while doesn't hurt. 
---
Hey any ps4 players, is anyone else having trouble connecting to the internet despite it being perfectly fine on other devices?
---
Is that dead boi clutching his ammunition pouch?
---
Yes, I have that on, that is why I get the emails with a security code to log on to another pc
---
I feel like they've been trying harder to make rooms more visually distinct every season. Every room in Fortress has almost a completely different theme, compared to some earlier maps which tend to be more naturally blended together. 
---
Thing is though, there's *too much* distinction and it makes it barely possible to quickly get everything into your mind and remember it when it matters. As well as having so many themes that the simple ones like bedroom and bathroom turn into more (to the average player) random ones like sewing and loom, or fermentation and brewery. 
---
What made many of the vanilla maps so memorable to me was they instead made rooms distinct almost purely with layouts, with almost no two close-by rooms with even a similar shape. A garage and a main hall would *feel* different, and not just a box with a different art style applied.
---
WALL CAN WITHSTAND ASSAULT 
---
Ban Roulette? New strategy?
---
Can you explain how he's not overpowered? Because  in high ranks he's pretty overpowered. 
---
Best of RNG

Does he evacuees her airtight yoga pants on?

Pefect use of the testing environment 
---
Unironically using the term triggered. Thats a good start. 
---
Username was created when this was supposed to be a purely professional account, which it now isn't.
---
A map with balance issues is AN UNBALANCED MAP.  I don't just pretend my designs are good if there is balance issue, it would lead to me being a shitty designer. 
---
Your preference for variety over quality isn't an excuse to act like a condescending cunt with an unironic "lul git gud attitude". Oh and BTW thats why have been downvoted.
---
Siege is a competitive FPS, some players get enjoyment from winning and they like to win and lose based on who played better, not who got lucky with the defence and attacking rounds. 
---
You call me triggered but your the one having an angry rant because the majority of people who like ranked want to play on less maps that are properly balanced as opposed to playing on demonstrably unbalanced maps labelling them whiners purely for having a differing opinion from you.
---
Call it a challenge? One team having a distinct advantage in a supposed competitive game is blatantly poor balancing and anyone with sense and a lack of angry bias can see that. The entire problem is that two teams who could both be playing excellently, playing to the best of their ability, wont have their skill be the deciding factor of the match, but by pure 50/50 RNG of who got play what rounds. Thats bad game design.
---
Almost every game I'm in he gets played multiple rounds. Today I played in casual against two different 5stack squads that had dokk, lion, blitz and finka. The 5th wasn't consistent. Like I understand he may not be that good at higher level but playing against a team composition like that is not fun. Not the way the game is supposed to be. Again, this is my opinion. 
---
I'm sick of how often lion gets banned on every map even when the opposing team are a bunch of level 50 unranked players only because it's the unwritten rule of PL. 
---
I guess i need to practice against him. Hes just annoying to deal with. 
---
Keep him 3 speed just change the look of the uniform. Mira and echo are both 3 armored and look much smaller. I was only talking of cosmetics 
---
I‚Äôm level 97 so big oof
---
*q ueer*
---
The registration fucked up. It‚Äôs fine now.
---
Yeah definitely, my favorite way to deal with Blitz is to face him, and run directly at him and knife, your melee is faster than his, also his legs and shoulder are great targets to shoot at
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not advocating why you should ban her. I was answering the question of why someone would *want to ban* her.  Don‚Äôt downvote me for answering someone question.
---
This is one of a reason for not playing R6. I feel like I am not in the game or something.
