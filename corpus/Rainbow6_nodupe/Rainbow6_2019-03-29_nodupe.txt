If they are boosted by a cheater and are caught they are stripped of rank. And the elo is given back.

It used to be so much damn fun! Now i truly just don't enjoy it. It's gotten painfully obvious how much more frustrating this game has become than what it used to be. Oh well!

If they are boosted by good players thats not too big of a problem. Until they put in a rank lock that prevents high levels boosting low levels then you just have to deal with it. If thats what you are talking about.

I'll take that as a compliment, thank you!

lol rip finka and Zofia  and of coarse that would happen
---
I feel like despite all the nerfs Ela has been through, she's in a very good spot now. She doesn't feel outrageously powerful or weak anymore.
---
Honestly, its iffy. Do you know most callouts on most maps? Do you have friends to play with? Are you willing to deal with teammates judging your skill? I ask the last one bc some people take ranked a bit too seriously and can get pretty toxic if you have a bad game

she was at 1 hp

I want a trade option so I can get rid of my twitch chibi/F2 black ice.

I know some twitch mains that would be very happy to have that.

Ranked is best with a team..2 man at least...that be said it‚Äôs more competitive and less forgiving when you mess up so be ready for hate mail even if you did nothing wrong. But the feeling of a tank up with your buds and a good game overall is far better also add randoms who talk you‚Äôll make teammates fast
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been doing it it‚Äôs great when droning out upstairs lockers and want to hide your drone. This is so that way if the defender tries to rotate through the window and they didn‚Äôt break it we can hear them.

This spot has been around forever, I've watched it for about a year or two now, my friend does too, he's only seen one or two people there in this time - but now it got posted to reddit and it's this huge thing now.

Yo mods wtf bro I post my renown and it gets taken down but this is ight?

? Legit hover over the 2 grips, the Angled doesn't tighten it at all, it just changes it slightly like a Suppressor, where Vertical lowers the vertical recoil
---
I didn‚Äôt say that. What I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm only 500 hours you can become a pretty good player. So if you really work hard you can go to E league. Soooooo????

Yes I did drop to Copper from Gold IV. If you wanna check my MMR my username is PhantomHunter79, check stat tracker.

Well I don't think this is something to fuss over but if you saw the dude go into the room and just shot the wall hoping to get him and did it's obvious you used your brain and are not hacking if you pull a smooth flick on em it might be "?" worthy but that's about it

okay so you reposted to censor name without censoring his name?

Oooo good idea

Seems to me u might be banned

Barbed wire.  Legion.  Jager.  Ela. Mute. Frost.   Theres loads of counter.  Just make sure you call out the rush and spread the slow out enought to waste ash charges

Yeah that‚Äôs cool and all but getting 0 points tho

why MP5 and MP5 SD should lose ACOGS. they are too low recoil which makes headshots easy

Jackal is very very good, you'll find you turned gay for him soon enough.

Sneak around hunting pesky roamers and getting EZ peaks on anchors. Work your team buddies to locate Caviar and Virgin
---
Best use: in hatches or through windows. 
---
Good examples
---
Basement objective, look at the top floor and second floor for common roaming locations, scan and BEGONE. 
---
Chase that roamer, getting close. Pop that smoke grenade in a doorway, scan and eliminate them. 
---
No seriously, jackal is good. Don't use the pistol, the shotgun can yeet hatches and doors, even walls and floors. The pistol... Switch now. The rifle is great and the SMG is great, the shotgun is a dank meme but not very useful unless dual shotgun.

Rook and Doc are great defenders in my opinion, simple abilities, decent gun (though the p90 can be hard to control so I would start with the mp5), and they help the team a lot! For attackers I would say people like Thatcher or Sledge, once again they have decent guns and simple gadgets! They‚Äôre easy to learn and you can always use a soft breacher or someone to get rid of those annoying Bandit/Kaid gadgets!
---
Cater to realism as I inject my nanobots onto my female navy seal with an invincible shield made of glass as a 9mm pistol does more damage than a 5.56 assault rifle, don't forget you can't put an acog on half the guns in the game because realistically they just wouldn't fit!

Is it your fastest ace or the fastest ace

Oh. R6 has a steam store? I thought it was through Ubisoft

No clue what you are saying? Like mad max style? This isnt the game for that.

Real question is why were you in newcomer tho

Finka is a level 1 crook zofia is a level 100 boss that's how mafia works right?

Maverick he‚Äôs more quiet and leaves a smaller less noticeable hole

I'm just saying you didn't need to spend over $60 on the game. Anything over that is one you and only you. It's not just me, there is millions or people playing this game and yet only a few thousand report issues. I'm not getting pissy your just bashing an entire game based on just your experience which you were saying is toxicity, which is easily avoidable.

anything specific in mind? i could just post an image of my entire specs
---
Sure this logic might work if you assume OP is playing in Casual, but what is OP supposed to do if this is happening in ranked? He should leave the lobby and take the penalty? Can't kick him because it is ranked, there is nothing OP can do about it...
---
But there's no kill in the killfeed?..
---
Theoretically, if you were going to sell it, how much would you want for it?
---
One time I was in club house garage on ground level when a monty came through the window on the little upper catwalk and he was just standing there extended. I knew he was trying to bait my attention so someone else could come through the window, so I just held my angle with him in my peripheral. The instant he dropped his shield I make the most accurate headshot flick with perfect recoil control of my life (my aims kinda shit). It looked so sus that the guy thought I was aimbotting on the killcam. Just fucking satisfying.

Yo. Who else heard YO HE FUCKIN DEAD when bandit died?

If youre already good at the game yes of course this isnt going to affect much but the ones that got to Plat bc they abused this are about to get smacked back down

Create a customized match, you can have 10 minutes alone in every map you choose, that's the way I learnt the more popular maps. And choose Sledge, I'm sure you know why

Yep. I went to T-hunt with outback. The map seems cool enough. Thanks

Once your ping gets above a certain level the game is almost unplayable. The window where your ping is high enough to get an advantage but low enough not to effect your game must be so small.

---
Yep, I was standing outside near the window droning. The guy tried to shoot the jumping drone, but he headshoted me instead -_-
---
I‚Äôm not sure if this is just an issue on console, or both console and PC, but as a console player this has happened to me a handful of times this season
---
lol what
---
Okay so I'd say I play kinda similar (I play mostly middle ground but tend to fill various roles) so I'll give you my 2 cents and you do that with what you want, and as context I'm plat 3-2 and on console. 
---
So okay, 
---
For attack:
---
Maverick- I think maverick is a great operator, hes kind of unique in how his ability works and his playstyle. I think he has a great weapon set but I have found that he becomes kinda of like, a risk choice. Like picking him is not bad but it sometimes is like "should I have just played hibana or thermite" or like its easy to think that as you go for an objective you didnt get that much use out of his ability. Hes sneaky and to use him well requires outsmarting opponents which is fun but can really waste time. 
---
Nomad: 
---
I like nomad, shes interesting, I think she is borderline OP in the right hands, but feel she doesnt always fit my style. Like shes good at pushing and holding a taken site but not for quick attacks or sneaking. Her guns are decent but I find that her pistol can end up costing you your life when in close quarters and so I stray away from her sometimes. Shes good at getting long distance picks and for trying to stop flanks, but I'd say shes more offensive orientated. 
---
Gridlock:
---
I actually have really enjoyed Gridlock, I know she is in a weird spot of maybe being OP maybe being too weak, but I think shes very useful. Shes good at making the enemy have to waste time or resources to deal with her. She is the kinda op that if you can stay alive and partly or fully take a site she is very very strong, I guess same with nomad but I feel nomads are much more tempting to use for flanks than for forcing people out of an area. Her guns are okay, but she comes with a lot of utility with the breaching charges or shotty and her pistol is great, biggest down side is she is a 1 speed. Shes more support style than nomad. 
---
Finka: 
---
Probably one of my favorite ops as she is a good middle ground op as she can play all three roles very well. She can push hard if needed, play middle if needed, or play support. Her kit is pretty great aside from the AR but its usable. I run shotty and play her all three ways. She is strong at coordinating pushes and helping your squad to regroup from a failed one. Her grenades are a huge plus and shes really dangerous the close she gets to obj and the lower the time gets. 
---
I'd personally pick Finka first for her versatility, but if sneaky is what you are really liking I'd go with maverick, just be warned that you may find yourself not picking him a lot. 
---
Defense:
---
Clash:
---
I'm not a shield player, I dont have the patience of a shield player, my friend plays clash and I work well with them but I cant use her very effectively. As someone who tries to half roam i find her need of team effort let's me down because the squads I play with tend to not care about my callouts unless I die, so yeah.
---
Maestro:
---
Probably one of the most sell rounded ops in the whole game, has cams, that can hurt, has shotgun secondary, great lmg, wall clearing shotgun, sniper revolver, and hes a thicc boi. Hes a really fun op but requires some greater map knowledge to use correctly. I use him to roam some and put cameras in places I can fall back to and kill when distracted, I've strayed recently though as my more anchoring mates play him so I cant. 
---
Mozzie:
---
Hes become one of my favorite on defense because he is sneaky and it's fun to get drones. His kit is good and I really like playing him but sometime hes ability just doesnt help enough so I find myself asking if I should have picked someone else that could be more useful like mute. So it depends on the map and the rest of your team. He is sorta similar to how I described maverick, so I'd you get him, expect to possibly not play him all the time as you may easily conclude you should just go mute. 
---
Kaid:
---
Ability is super useful, but he will constantly feel "underpowered" until you have a bandit and manage to trick a Thatcher then he feels strong. SMG kinda sucks and the dmr shotgun is awesome. Draw back like nomad is up close fight is really lacking. Not great at roaming, good for anchors. I've roamed with I'm and it works but it's hard to retake a site with him. 
---
I'd honestly say you should pick Lesion if you dont have him or do and dont play him. If it's the latter then unlock mozzie cause hes the most fun. The reason I say lesion is because he has some of the trap and roam feels of kapkan while having an Intel component. His traps can kill but probably wont, but become super strong the further in the match you are. His shotgun is really good imo, SMG is good, pistol great and he has impacts. Hes a perfect middle ground on defense and has a lot of versatility. 
---
Hope this is useful, sorry it's long, just trying to give you info on everyone.

It‚Äôs going to ruin that as well. I understand that Drop Shotting, Lean Spamming and Crouch Spamming were annoying to deal with, but other aspects of the game are being affected from these changes as well.

How the fuck is anyone supposed to "get better" when they're trying to do just that by playing Ranked, but being forced to play with dickheads who TK you because you're not as good as them?  Like, I think we could all agree that if you want to "git gud" then you should be playing more Ranked, and if you have the attitude and want to learn, you'll gradually get better.  
---
It's kind of impossible when you're being berated on the mic by higher levels, and TK'd for not being as good as someone who has hundreds and hundreds of hours of the game compared to you.

I don't understand people that complain about the game because they lose. gold level play isn't "Aids" you and most of the other people who are in it cant compete, kills or otherwise and proceed to say that the game is broken or bad in a certain way. the lion-doki-ash-blitz combo isn't hard to counter, you just need a smoke, mute and some skill. Now i say this because I am plat 2 and i went through what you're going through. But instead of complaining about the game being bad and or broken; I just asked "what can I do/learn to get better and beat these people/strats. it is possible to beat the "aids of gold ranked" you just have to put some effort into it. Also on that note, crouch spam; is it a problem? or is it a bunch of golds being mad about something that has been in the game for 3 years because they don't want to admit that they cant aim. Find out this Saturday at 11pm. No but for real I don't crouch spam because i cant be bothered to learn to counter the way it messes with your aim, and i don't really think its that valuable of a skill past silver, but its not a problem because i have beat people doing it and when i lose, its because i missed my shots. But you may rebut with "But it makes their head harder to hit therefore its broken" and to you my dear silver, I say so is walking so why not get rid of that while we are at it? or just remove bullets from your enemy because that makes it harder for you to win also right? i mean if you lose its not cause you're bad, its cause the game is broken. Because no one can be better than you right? &lt;3

Every previous set of Pro League skins has usually had white or gold on the gloves, but all of them this season just have their default skin's glove textures

Yes!

Nope. BOSG does 125 damage. 3 armour (without rook armour) has 0.64 damage multiplier. 0.64 * 125 = 80. Not enough to injure.

Eli5 the first comment, after you shoot, the center of your screen will move, and the max distance it will move draw a diamond, so what it affects to is the maximum and average recoil it will have, both horizontal and vertical.

TL:DR Twitch's gun is gud. Base operators are gud. Fuze doesn't like the hostage. You don't need DLC operators. Rainbow is not P2W.
---
But any disadvantage that newcomers MAY have is negligible at most. Even comparing weapons, Twitch's F2 is number 1 in TTK, Seconded by Ash's R4-c And then Hibana's Type 89. Even then, Hibana's Type-89 is still only tied with Fuze's Ak-12. If you're looking for a very specific ability, IE intel gadgets like Valk, Echo, or Maestro, obviously you're going to need to get them outside of the standard edition, however, ubi does allow you to buy them with renown. If you are solely basing P2W on "If I buy these operators then I don't have to work for them" Then yes, Rainbow Six IS pay to win. However if you want to bring in stats, as well as unique abilities, having just base operators is perfectly fine. Being able to use all play styles, 1 speed up to 3 speed operators, Shields or LMGs, Bombing a hostage from the other side of a wall, making really big fucking holes, then you're set with the base operators. Want really fast firing, high damage weapons? Base ops. Want the ability to never get touched by a bullet? Base Ops. Need to make everyone in the game mad because you don't have a hitbox? Base ops. The base ops work with any play style and are very powerful. IMHO Rainbow six is NOT p2w.

Sorry fairly new to the game. So everyone just goes in same place &amp; nomad throws an airjab &amp; then knife fight?
---
Is it that simple? 
---
I have been playing the game since the start as well, and Ubisoft has definitely changed the way it works. Previously it used to be much worse because Ubisoft's ping compensation was much worse than it is now. It doesn't give you an advantage, but it gives you a disadvantage instead. For example, if you were to peek and angle and see someone, that person would have seen you before you could see him. You would also have a higher chance of dying if you were to quick peek an angle and un-peek as there is the delay between you and the servers.
---
Think about as there's actually two of you, one is the operator you are controlling and a ghost that is following you. In cases where you have low ping, that ghost would be pretty much in the exact same position as you are every time you do something, but if you have high ping, that ghost is a second or two behind because it's the one that's the one that the other players see, while the operator you are controlling is ahead.
---
This a good explanation, that I did not write myself.
---
I play on a constant 9 ping and can definitely say I have the advantage over 150+ ping players.

"Kurwa"
---
I do just when theres a random horizontal recoil pattern itbisnt a very good weapon. The way they can nake the gun viable is to get rid of the random pattern and make it more predictable.
---
I agree, somewhat. If you lose a placement match, no matter what, you should not be considered a higher rank than before that game, it‚Äôs just maybe you only go down 1/2 a rank if you do really good, but the teammate that didn‚Äôt do too good should lose a whole rank.
---
This could also work for carrying someone. If you win going 15 and 1. You should gain more rank than the guy you backpacked. This would stop smurfing and sandbags that don‚Äôt have the carrier anymore.

Im pretty sure thats the point, to show their backstory and culture, to show that a group of individuals from different ways of life come together to fight terrorism.

No he needs a bag to clean up himself who is made out of dogshit. It's truly sad people are impressed by this.

But likes it‚Äôs there game, I mean I don‚Äôt know how that works at all so maybe they can‚Äôt and you‚Äôre right. But I‚Äôve gotten banned for playing call of duty before (boosting in MW3, oops) so if other games can ban people why can‚Äôt they?

Cold lil spaghetti boi. I love it. 
---
That gun is one if the most op guns in the game however there is a skill gap to using it, like I'm used to the l86 LSW so i just spray corners  however i can't do that with a dmr 
---
&gt;but its not ok at all that you are forced to play this mission 8 out of 10 times
---
You're pulling a figure out of thin air. Show me some statistics that prove this is actually the case and sure i'll believe you, but it really just sounds like you're exaggerating.
---
Alternatively, play lone wolf if it is really that much of an issue.

Don't forget the broken shield and hit reg

Sir I think you left your aim-lock on, please turn it off before returning to Tom Clancy‚Äôs Rainbow 6 Siege 
---
you didn‚Äôt read the rules then. i‚Äôll even help you out. it‚Äôs rule 9 
---
In short, no.
---
Thanks!
---
That‚Äôs just sad.
---
Because you will get a temp ban for leaving in ranked, why else? 
---
I had a issue like that as well. I was messing around with settings and it went away. Might not be like in your case since I'm using borderless window mode. Anyway, I changed fov to 80, and in graphic settings I changed at the very bottom to TAA and sharpness to 100. I have no idea how or what but never happened again after that. 
---
Co thanks

There‚Äôs nothing overpowered about that dmr. I never said it‚Äôs trash but this is clearly the skill level of someone who would choose it 9 times out of ten.

People still care about Black Ice in 2019 lul
---
i dont think people get what i meant. Im saying that on pc moments like these dont happen to me because a mouse is a lot more precise and faster than a controller. So in close quarter situations like these it doesnt turn into an akward knife fight.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
AE is merciless. 
---
Oh really prove it to me 
---
I recommend checking out varsity gaming, he used to do a lot of rainbow six tutorials, how to attack, how to defend, how to use different operators, that kind of stuff 
---
I think you meant overhaul
---
Only use tachanka
---
Yes, it‚Äôs rare and looks fucking awesome
---
Haha EMP was too strong I guess 
---
Oh ok 
---
Best part had to be Jagers acog 
---
Uaually in the context of throwing something. But i the screen didn't twitch.... Idk its wooshing over my head
---
They're supposed to be the same but I've never seen any for the G8A1 or any DLC operator weapons
---
plenty of these games also reduce the recoil on consoles, making the mnk converters even more OP
---
This is the first I'm hearing of these articles. What are they and how do you do them?
---
Does 720 while screaming reeeeee and meleeing wildly
---
Problem is that it happens in all games. Warframe, R6, BF1 and you name em. After a while of playing game locks at 60 FPS and I have to legit Tab Out for it to get fixed for a brief time
---
Oh DLC operators don‚Äôt have black ice and me neither for the G8A1
---
I couldn't count how many rounds we lost or won because someone random ran away with the defuser just to get kills or because we got/didn't got callouts. Also by saying this you are just saying that having gamesense isn't a skill you need to get higher ranks. A support player who has a negative k/d can have just as much if not more influence on a round than the top fragger.
---
Weird flex, but okay

---
You‚Äôre misusing the term ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô because they were just getting greedy and impatient. Toxic is a term, which should be reserved for hackers, trollers, team killers, etc.
---
I approve. Well played. 
---
Lol the chances of you getting domed by any rifle and surviving is extremely low especially when the operators hardly ever wear helmets in game
---
while obviously you can't measure call-outs and droning there are a few few to measure your influence on the round for example if you're familiar with pro league there is the SiegeGG rating and the KOST. The SiegeGG rating takes into account  Kills per Round, Teamkills per Round, Multikills, Opening Kills/Deaths, Clutches, KOST, Survival Rate, Trade Differential, Objectives Achieved(i can't explain everything becasue it would be too long but everything is explained in this  [article](https://siege.gg/news/946-player-rating-rebalance)) . Or they could use KOST(or  (K)ill, (O)bjective, (S)urvived, (T)raded)  getting a kill, planting/defusing, surviving, or having your death traded will all make a round count towards this metric  and it's great to measure you're impact on the game.
---
That‚Äôs sick. Good luck man 
---
I‚Äôm going to assume you meant optimal which makes me laugh, because preference is much more important than what ‚Äúis better‚Äù. I prefer any sight over an ACOG because I do not like the magnification on it
---
It is a 120hz ASUS monitor 
---

Actual duration of Zophia's withstand ability 
---
thanks!
---
I'd love to see them do this or something like the trust system of CS. Only issue is that queue times are kinda long already so splitting the player base even more might suck. 
---
Yeah man, that‚Äôs a really cool idea! 
---
I‚Äôm like 120 with no black ice. Unlucky
---
Sorry but the chances of anyone surviving a Direct Hit to the head from a 5.56 or a 7.62 is extremely low. The 1 shot headshots are what make this game so fun and challenging.
---
You hit the nail on the head, that makes more sense than what I was saying. Like a lot more

Bro, that Blitz would be scary AF!

So people who want to play with their friends should be restricted to shitty casual? No thanks

Agree with you there

Yeah i‚Äôm sure you Americans do that a lot. Sad.

I didnt know 2014 lol but columbus was 2016??

Like that its not all one shade of blue, original in own way cool stuff.
---
1. Absolutely not 
---
2. No, Jesus Christ no. It would turn the game into fortnite jumping up and down to avoid bulltets.
---
3. Meh besides prep phase, pinging is usually not a good idea any way 
---
4. Range in the effect, or how far they can be shot, or how close you have to be to activate it? 
---
5. No.
---
Wow my life

Thank you Lord! I am blessed to have your praise

It's been reverted for me lol.

if you don't mind using Fn key combos for media keys, coolermaster makes a decent tenkeyless with media keys.

That deadass looks too real to be drawn

What
---
HeartSparkles lol same as here
---
yeah, end of round I have time to hunt down 54 little tracks while also trying not to get killed, if I can even see anything because she has smokes as well. super balanced, 10/10
---
Its not. Check my other reply for what it is.
---
You could vault onto the railing(From the close corner that's barely out of frame) and walk along it to a proper ledge and fall from it. 
---
yeah, but it's not just stealth, you can't just run through them, and that's valuable utility you won't have in that situation. 
---
You are missing the point... Forget it
---
git gud should be a bannable comment.
---
because usually u get to play with players similar to ur rank
---
but when a plat player squad up with copper or silver then they will face a lower rank
---
Shh don't tell them our secrets
---
well, since you can't fucking move, it's pretty fucking hard to win a gunfight.
---
"Just stand still"
---
weak
---
Quickly go to the doctor to get your ass put back on!
---
Yes, players like me Who only like bomb on th are forced to this shit, its Just wrong. 
---
yes, because you always have time to stop and shoot 54 little metal circles throughout a round.
---
lol i face them too, plat 2 that plays like gold
---
He's not a dick, if you get spawn peeked then it's your fault for not being careful.
---
What killed him? 
---
congratulations Cav, you just played yourself
---
Can relate
---
I watched Varsity Gaming and Get_Flanked (both on YouTube) when I first got into R6. They have good introductory guides.
---
yeah dude :/ ,tell me about it 
---
Lol what if they‚Äôre just playing with friends that are lower elo 
---
Nice. needs less pixels though. it just kinda looks like a bad low res image.
---

Inb4 every starts making these for every operator.

almost I had to rush

And people out there still saying castle is useless. It all depends on who the castle is and whether they know how to use him or not
---
Should it?
---
You don‚Äôt need to hit anymore than three or four to make a path through them, or save an impact grenade just in case. Hell I‚Äôd even say if it gets to the point where she is in the objective, no one else is, she lays down all of her traps, and you don‚Äôt have enough time to let the smoke clear, then you‚Äôve been out played. If that scenario is so much of a hassle, don‚Äôt let her get that sort of power over you. 
---
The person who made this video (SpooksR6) has worked on Rainbow Six Siege. Here's his twitter: https://twitter.com/SpooksR6
---
Don't start an engagement unless you know you will win or unless you have to.  Drone a room before you go into it on attack. Varsity gaming had some beginner tutorials.   And play lots of t hunt to learn maps. The compass at the bottom of your screen will tell you the name of the room your in so that helps with callouts as a beginner and also when learning maps. Glhf if your on PC and want to add me Iodestar.te
---
Didn't realize ubi was adding ray tracing to r6...
---
That recruit though
---
Yeah I know, and I honestly think it's better for the game this way because while I get it could happen and its a "strat" it just seems to take away from the game. (Oh yeah I know outback is really bad for spawn peeks. I dont understand what they were thinking for some of it.) 
---
YOU WERE THAT GUY! D:
---
If you watch the whole thing, you'll see that there's more than 1 reason. One of the reason that I mention, as a joke, is FNI. I was making a joke about the fact that we all have our moments when our aim is at his worst and is often the cause of "Hitreg issues" XD. 
---
Restart the game
---
Have you actually played with me?
---
You have to leave the squad and then you can rejoin 
---
Been happening for the last month
---
I think so.
---
Continent server?
---
Reinstall the game
---
Well, that probably contributed to my team losing, but I feel like being down by one player also played a big (if not bigger) part. The title kind of makes it sound like we would've definitely won if we had one  more player, which isn't what I was trying to say, when I posted this I couldn't be bothered to come up with a better way of saying that.
---
Thats because the color of the holo is determined by the base color of the weapon. The para has a tan color, hence the holo is tan too.
---
How do you get the lion main thing for your account?
---
Of course its easy to disarm the bomb and then keep flashing the bomber
---
Wow. No Mira. That ban is pretty unanimous huh?
---
Okay, it sounded TOTALLY different first time around... hahaha
---
Nah
---
It kinda sucks I can do better.
---
No i use the revolver
---
I feel like absolute shit now that I‚Äôm in the same rank. I‚Äôm not even *that* bad but damn I can‚Äôt get out of it when my teammates look like this, and I have no squad  to play with
---
Ok, i will do that over night
---
Reeeeeeeeposttttt
---
Yeah, I definitely do not like it when people use Pro Play as an example. Same thing happens with For Honour. 
---
It does in fact not
---
I disagree with that. If they wanted to switch, they should have absolutely went to controller. No one forced them to switch to console. And it‚Äôs ironic that they left PC because cheaters, then become the cheaters themselves on console. 
---
If a console player goes to PC, they have to be shite at using a MnK for awhile too. It‚Äôs part of it. They shouldn‚Äôt try to use cheats on PC just because they‚Äôre new and suck at it. 
---
And MnK being contained at only the highest levels on console shows what kind of advantage it gives. (Btw they also play casual for warmups/trolling and derank for the lulz) It keeps a lot of controller users from breaking that barrier, how is that not an issue? Yes you can make it there with a controller, but you‚Äôre battling it out against MnK users, often teams of them, so honestly you deserve your own rank of Diamond Plus or some shit. 
---
I'm fukin ODing
---
The ones on the ubisoft store are better if you didn‚Äôt know about them
---
Woah nice one, Junkrat.
---
pls no

I discovered today that if you hold a gridlock trap it will do the same thing 
---
it just be like that sometimes 
---
‚ÄòAdvanced jump to start a jump animation.‚Äô The same person who said vaulting :/
---
Smart!
---
Old plat when the cap was lvl30, totally agree with you.
---
Buddy who hurt u 
---
Is it thicc tho?
---
Yeah until they decide to shoot you instead still a nice feature 
---
you just said the same shit as last time, but ok. You‚Äôre also still guessing my rank, which I‚Äôve already told you is plat, but again, ok. 
---
the game isn‚Äôt competitive because there‚Äôs too many factors outside of skill now. how many times have you lost because of an unbalanced map where you lose because you have to defend more times than them? how can you say you‚Äôre a competitive player if you‚Äôre using meta operators against uncoordinated players. Yes, these have always been problems but every season these are amplified by, as you say, players getting better in general. That means the game needs to get better to compensate and keep it competitive. Idk if I‚Äôve explained this well, but I can‚Äôt really be arsed and don‚Äôt care enough to carry on.  
---
Weak. I've hit over 300,000 ping on discord without being disconnected.

https://youtu.be/Q-_wlz6jYSw?t=102
---
Because I just feel that the way its designed right now completely whites out an aspect of the game making it serve no purpose other than just being ‚Äúcanon fodder‚Äù which doesnt encourage experimenting with different approaches to loadouts but rather just a go-to rule of thumb. Kinda like how the recruit is to other operators usually. 
---
An oldie but it checks out.
---
How about don‚Äôt use an acog and use the superior GIGN Shotgun
---
I would recommrnd getting a smaller filter and painting it black, but the GP5 is a great gasmask. Be sure to get a filter that is asbestos-free.
---
The best thing to do is ignore them. Block the comms and messaging from them. They are looking for a reason to irritate you and make you upset. Probably because they are sad, nothing better to do and have a tiny penis.
---
Continue to make calls and set up cross fires. The best thing to do is to simply play better than them. Use that as your "fuck you" to them. If they all say you suck/can't aim, but you end up alive and top leader board, does it matter? Also, it is much better to win and be on the bottom vs. Top score and a lose the game.
---
Sorry what? Thunt pros? You mean people dedicate time to playing terrorist hunt, fucking lol

Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it on clean and on topic, please.
---
As someone who plays on pc and PS4. No..everyone is prone to hubris and potato aim. You were dealt a bad hand and made gold from it. You got my respect 
---
Pretty sure when they think of spawn peeks, they think of peeks where you can literally see an attacker's spawn point from inside/slightly outside the building, not peeks that can hit you as you're approaching the building from afar.  
---
The only spawn peek (going by what I think Ubi defines them as) that I know of on Outback is the garage runout towards fuel pumps, which forces the one running out to run so far out that they'll be detected just before they can see the attackers.
---
(That said I'd be happy if they somehow got rid of these cheap opening kills where they peek you as you approach the building at the beginning of the round. They just feel like an annoyance to check every single round and I don't feel like they pulled off some great shot or tactic whenever I get killed by one.)
---
When this happens to me I have this general conversation with my teammates.
---
Me: I just got killed but I am not visible on the kill cam!?
---
Somewhat Nice Teammate: Welcome to the new Siege season!
---
Somewhat not that nice teammate: Git Gut
---
And then we continue the game.
---
That's what mute chat is for ;)

Imo, Mute is so much better utility wise when compared to Ela. Sure, Ela gadget disorientates and slows pushes, but Lesion does it better considering his Gu resupplies over time.

But this graphic is only considering R6's EU counterpart
---
He shot you in the foot. What is the fix you need? You aimed, that move the shield away...
---
MW2 flashbacks
---
Imagine writing a small essay type post and 0% of what you say is right
---
Ubi listened to the community with Bartlett and look how that turned out, so lets let them listen to people that know what they are doing, R6Siege was always billed as an only online multiplayer shooter so if youre mad you got literally what you paid for then thats on you, no one forces you to buy the season pass and every operator is 100% free with renown that is earned simply by playing the game
---
Unless you had a blitz/thatcher that's amazing. 
---
To be clear, I understand they‚Äôre not cheaters or racists, they did however send my team many hateful messages, so they are toxic! Stop getting so fucking upset over a word
---
You madman!
---
Thank you so much, i have a lot of insecurities and their words hurt me. Maybe i should just play other games when My friends are not around. Will watch videos and learn from mistakes. I also enjoy The Pro league. Thank you &lt;3
---
Well some sort of solution has to come or at least a temporary solution to fix with this team-killing because like the next genuine player, I'm done dealing with degenerate players who purposely teamkill.
---
I wish I could rent an ACOG for Tachanka ffs
---
First you say R6 is overpriced for only being a multiplayer game and now compare a $60 games playerbase to a free to play game? Just stop talking please

I mean you can still play siege like lone wolf terrorist hunt and situations. You can still play sieg. And np

Looks like a full send to me
---
You can try to vore me but I'm dumby thicc and you won't get past my ass cheeks
---
I had someone scream at my GF and I that he was going to find and rape us, trust me, toxicity will always be present in this game, your potato moments will always happen, pro players and streamers all have potato moments, take your time, learn the maps, aiming comes with time, find a sensitivity that works with your setup, find game settings that give you a good stable FPS, play the game hard, and when someone is being toxic, mute them, they can get fucked for all you care. 
---
Make sure when you play the game you have the proper mindset.
---
You want to get better, and thats awesome, you are among a lot of others, who are trying but cant always succeed because of toxic teammates, if you find someone who is also trying to succeed, add them, play with them, and enjoy your time in game.
---
I have 2 friends in NZ that I play with regularly (I'm in AUS) and I couldn't imagine not playing wth them now, our team synergy is too good, and we all help eachother improve without being assholes.
---
But most of all, I believe in you to get better despite the toxic assholes you meet, believe in yourself too, just dot get cocky, or you will get cocked over in game.

More like since the release of the game. It's why I quit playing, that shit isnt fun

Fucking plot twist 
---
If you were corn I would eat you

Yes but the reticle is a bit obstructive making the timing of the shot more difficult. 
---
Oh true
---
Don't get frustrated if you die a lot in the beginning. This game took me months to learn when I first started, but quickly became my most played game when I started to get the hang of it. Some people who will be jerks to new players, but that's a small minority from my experience. There are plenty of people who will show you how to properly set up site if you ask, and as many others have commented, Get_Flanked and Varsity Gaming are great YouTube channels to help you learn the game faster. Good luck and have fun!

Yup, the food
