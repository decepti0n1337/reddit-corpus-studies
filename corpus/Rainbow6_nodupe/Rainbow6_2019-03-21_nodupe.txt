Use drones for that

Why is that bandit gadget jut cropped in there it looks so weird 
---
That didn‚Äôt hit the head

Yup. All unique burnt horizon skins have disappeared as of yesterday's maintenance patch. I am missing all 5 I have purchased. I have contacted support and they said they are looking into it.
---
The most annoying part is that they made us wait a damn year for this incredibly simple change. Like they barely did anything to him. 
---
Just curious, why is black ice a big deal? (I‚Äôm a relatively new player)
---
WiFi? Do you have family members running things in the background or are you using a lot of WiFi yourself, did your WiFi get downgraded?
---
Some people have suggested it so definitely will do
---
yea i wrote them as well and didn‚Äòt get an answer. they could at least refund me for it so i can buy the diamond skin if they won‚Äòt give the skins back.lol
---
1) They are getting a hugely better product than on release, with more depth, maps, and polished mechanics.
---

---
2) Operators get discounted I think you forgot about that part.
---
3) A year 8 Siege with 100 operators is not worth 60$; its probably not even worth 100$. 
---
These are awesome
---
[Mozzie](https://imgur.com/gallery/mSW6RsK) and [Gridlock](https://imgur.com/gallery/9yqZTtX)
---
Create a custom game and go on spectator mode
---
HMU on discord whenever and I‚Äôll get back to you as soon as I can. I‚Äôm free atm. 
---
Also it‚Äôs literally a brand new server so theres nothing 
---
I know, i‚Äôm confused about my death. Gridlocks reticule never comes close to me. If you look where the reticule is, it goes under the window, and to the right but never at the hole i‚Äôm looking through.
---
Alright, thanks
---
You shot people, nice. 
---
Remove every operator except ash!
---
yes please
---
"It hurt itself in confusion!!!!!"
---
All projectiles are shot from the sight not the acctual barell in this case bolt, everything is shot from the center of players vision, thus meaning we basically spit bullets
---
F
---
Context: Someone talking about sexual fantasies with Gridlock.
---
People would type /V to say the n word
---
that was fixed last patch.
---
Clearly the word fetish
---
That‚Äôs why I fuse first
---
Vigils gadget erases his image off of camera drones, lions drone uses vibrations, it's basically sonar 
---
Where do yall get this stuff lmao
---
The kill cams are a tab bugged this season. 
---
See people shoot ait and kill people on the kilcam but the player that got killed said they were not behind cover and it was a normal kill.
---
The defenders can‚Äôt defend the hostage if there is no hostage
---
Ryzen Gang üëç
---
Maybe for God's do the turret and the bullets blue, then white on top and red on bottom. For Jackal make the eye yellow and the background red, then for Mira just make the reflections yellow.
---
Cool idea on the attacker, but that's not realistic all
---
THANK YOU!!!!!!! I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE ITS BULLSHIT THAT YOU HIT HIM AND NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
These look really cool
---
You might be very good at being mad at the player that just smoked you, but you aren't able to tell what input they are using. 
---
Perhaps just two ARs that you can switch to?
---
True, but again, if they're advanced in the medical field and have elite SF training, then it's most probable that they will be apart of a military task force. 
---
i think interrogations are cool, but it seems like it's trying to push for TK's more with the body shield mechanic. That's just me tho. 
---
Armor isn‚Äôt hitbox 
---
definetly worth it. im playing since the end of parabellum and grinded like hell to get all ops. and you also can have more dayli missons for renown as well as the 10% in the in game store. don‚Äòt to mention the 0.3 percent per spin . i would buy it every year from know on

yes if they shoot me again. I don't want to get shot again. 
---
This was amazing to watch. Thank you for this clip
---
Atleast raise the damage if they are going to keep the slow fire rate.... Let us equip an extended barrel on it.
---
I think i have seen like, max 10 people use the ACS12 since Para Bellum. Its shit, even for the meme status. 
---
Thank you!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b3gy84/apparently_a_lot_of_you_wanted_to_have_this/
---
I appreciate you
---
blood is client sided, so it does not mean you hit him
---
wow
---
Yeah, that looks miles better. Thank you, and good job on them.
---
nobody's gonna mention doc
---
Its not really a bug, its just how things work now. 
---
What used to be a bug on the tts was that you used to have the old pov with the new lean system so people could really abusing the pov to shoot from areas that you cant even see the other player. 
---
You can no longer get the volcano skin but I still think it's worth it. You get early access to the new ops and a discount in the shop, plus 600 credits and the lava 6 charm.
---
What country/server region do you play on ?
---
1. Ping abuse is non-existant since blood orchid
---
2. I dont agree with the camera perspective on lean as well
---
3. Better fix for lean spam would be to simply make it slower to hop left and right
---
Ouch.
---
Wholesome moments 
---
Yes, Ela and Zofia please!
---
If this was implemented, it would be nice if it was season 2 and on because since everyone has standard edition, most people have all Y1 operators.
---
Oh and you got the maestro fixed too! I was gonna do that but lovely to see that youve got it covered! If I do a megapost with all of them I'll have to remember to mention you
---
When i played back in blood orchid, my first rank ive recieved was gold 1
---
Disagree. I play with no outlines, no names, but keep the icons. I've had better luck shooting at people because I didn't have a huge white overlay covering the person I was shooting at.
---
Omg thank you so much 
---
This is my internet in a nutshell. Just trying to play siege on a weekday night and BAM! 20,000 PING!
---
people need to quit asking for handouts like this. if you want an elite skin then buy it like everyone else. 
---
I really like the attached idea actually, simple, doesn‚Äôt sound special but it helps. Defender I don‚Äôt think is good, anything to do with shields need to stay away from siege in my opinion.
---
Congrats man!
---
This is truly epic
---
Wish I had it on the revolver, looks really cool on that gun
---
At least you keep the icons. This guy had nothing on at all
---
I knew she was Spanish the second I heard "CABRONES" lol
---
Thanks
---
New Sledge buff shown? SledgeK-47
---
I think it should be every 100/150 levels
---
Little do the defenders know that the attackers are just nuking the whole map.
---
Fun fact, reflex ads faster then holo. At was past few seasons, don‚Äôt know what has changed now. 
---
Looks like shit.
---
id agree a few months ago but vigil is very much playable with the smg12, just needs more practice. and no more full-auto but i dont think thats a bad thing. youve got the k1a for that anyways
---
Good job! It‚Äôs always a great feeling.
---
Nice! I don‚Äôt have any black ices yet lol
---
You definitely should do more! Don't want to be picky but you should've probably removed the symbol in the center of the Spanish flag to make it look more clean. Keep up the good work man!
---
He‚Äôs been putting a wee bit more rubber than gunpowder into them recently
---
He has icons turned on. At the start you can see Cav's icon while he is pulling out the scanner.
---
Elite skins are awful. Just rework the alpha pack system to give people one every hour or so. No one cares about them anymore because it's too grindy, both the % and to buy with renown, then you get crap in them. 
---
Oh dont get me wrong, i have as many hours on GSG 9 recruit as i have on bandit, i know the definition of recruit dream
---
Maybe 2 armor 2 speed to make it a little less broken?
---
Defeats the purpose of the grind 
---
those defending ubisoft's hitboxes clearly didn't watch the full video..
---
It looks more like he added a particle accelerator than anything. 
---
Very slippery indeed. 
---
Or use the CZ
---
This would be my new ash charm
---
It all looked so good until the bandit gadget! Good job on the rest though!
---
I think that if you lined the red up with the Yokai, Echo's would be perfect
---
It‚Äôs on amazon fyi
---
Glitched shields are simply a visual bug in third person, shields are actually normaly behaving, clientside debris is common within online multiplayer games as server-side debris would create unnecesary ammounts of lag.
---
About the barricade yes that is a bug that needs fixing
---
naah. id rather not have the slider stab my eyes at ~1000rpm thankyou. 
---
Are you doxxing the server? Or the enemy team?
---
Maybe it would work if the ERC was burned faster if Vigil is moving during Lion's call.
---
Yes, Do more!
---
I've actually bought several (IQ, Blackbeard, Pulse, and Rook). It would just be preferable to have an alternative way of unlocking them, in my opinion. 
---
[Echo is somewhere there i think](https://imgur.com/gallery/cSusMcK)
---
I tried aligning the yokai with the circle but looked a bit weird. instead i left it like that
---
***NO LAG***

Congrats!

No the Enemy team
---
In my experience with the shields on both console and PC it has resulted in deaths from the front in both clash and Monty 
---
So basically, Siege is turning completely into paladins?
---
i hate clash. glad to see SOMEONE can kill him 
---
Imagine accidentally killing the hostage and half of the team
---
fuck that map
---
I don't think many people play hostage on ranked...
---
That'd be cool. Agreed.
---
Yes
---
It‚Äôs one of the better skins in the game, it can only be gotten in Alpha Packs (was once a seasonal skin), and only one gun at a time. 
---
Seige doesn‚Äôt have a good track record of labeling their weapon skins the rarity most in the community would think they should be, as such Black Ice is often better than the much rarer ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù skins. Ironically most of the purple loot is regarded as better than most of the legendaries.
---
People who have all the operators in the game. Is this some kind of peasant suggestion I spend too much time on the game to understand. 
---
Cool so im just bad. 
---
ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT?!
---
Or just save renown and buy them all
---
It's one of the holy grail skins of Siege but I think the value of them has gone down since they were brought into packs.. they're still pretty rare though. I have 31 and I'm pretty happy about it. 
---
u/Razor7950 i am so proud of this community 
---
Should've stuck with the smg. Higher fire rate = more bullets = lower chance of missing 
---
Red dot.  Doesn't take up as much screen on P90 as other guns
---
Can‚Äôt unsee it now
---
Then this can be a lesson.
---
Nice
---
IT'S AMAZING !!!
---
You're absolutely right I'm just still salty from the nerf.
---
Too big and maze like. 4 floors with different layouts is still tough to get my head around. 
---
Thanks üòä

Iq and Pulse

You'll get one soon buddy I believe in you

Thank you üòäüòä

Jesus, how long has this been online? Can we still repost this?
---
Ight I gotchu chief 
---
I like them except jackal. His looks strange. I can't really pinpoint why
---
I'll get them Juan Magnum Taps üòÇ
---
I may have trash download speed but at least I can play siege without any problems somehow lol 
---
Xbox 
---
Vigil's device hacks into drones and runs software that erases himself from the video feed instantly, while the software would have to be different why couldn't his device also hack Lion's drone? Instead of changing the video feed it could have the drone ignore the sonar/changes in heat that he creates or maybe just not send that data to the attacking team. Doesn't seem that far fetched given the already insane ability to instantly hack any number of drones and run software on them.
---
just go on the discord 4Head
---
That's not the lord flag. Shame on you
---
Nah she coo 
---
Visited Spain a while back. While I was disappointed there were no McPaellas, there are McPollos
---
Ohh (sadness noise) its fine 
---
You lucky man! My first Black Ice was on the 417, of all guns.
---
If you're on Xbox, hit me up and we can queue up. SoloQ is a surefire way to an early grave.
---
It really do be like that tho but the other way around for me :(
---
i just find her terrible to fight (i think zofia is the better breather anyway)
---
Pulse is the operator icon for the NSA
---
Eh no not really.  And it really depends on the scenario.  If your on d and you have a lesion and they have 10 health you should literally just play super defensive.  Or if your on attack and the last guy is glaz for example it‚Äôs easier to clip him with the pistol.  Just a couple things. 
---
That‚Äôs the only thing I have it on too.
---
Sorry, you seem like such a nice person tho! üò¢
---
This has been known for 5 years and in 5 years it has yet to be addressed 
---
echo doesnt have a phone to call. his wrist mounted screen is just that, a screen. not a whole ass phone that rings like every other defender. its not just "lore" 
---
Sorry. Got it fixed in this other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b3gy84/apparently_a_lot_of_you_wanted_to_have_this/)
---
Zofia does have nice breath now that you mention it. 
---
That tachanka one is bugging with my eyes to make it look 3D
---
Only sometimes, but it‚Äôs really bad when it happens
---
Dude i fucking love these! Please make some more.

OIII mate

i made that

I'm on PC mate

bro i meant breacher but ofc apple‚Äôs auto correct decides to act upüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I feel ya man. Sure I wouldn't mind. Also dang the 417? At least you got on a primary, sorry it had to be on a bad one. But hey! You'll get one soon I promise

Epic gamer moment üòé

Best character
---
I'm going to try doing my own once I get home from work. I'll see what I can do :)
---
thats ok, i cry a little every night for taking iqs nades away. i know ot was the right thing but it still stings. even rn. 
---
youll get used to it :) 
---
Good job buddy &lt;3
---
You hate ash because she is such a fast runner with high rpm and low recoil, if you do not know how to use her tho, she can be terrible in certain situations (comming from an ash main trust me).
---
Echo needs to be immune otherwise his main utility of denying plants could be easily countered by Dokkeabi pressing a button and knocking you off cams as someone plants. 
---
Yeah, I'm not the luckiest man alive
---
Yeah she is powerful in the right hands. I feel that any 3 speed used in a similar manner is comparable though. If it wasn‚Äôt for the small magazines then Hibana would just as good at run-and-gun. 
---
I thought sledge was about to swing a gun on a stick
---
i think she is just a good operator, and her ability is amazing, but she is just way too used and powerful. she has barely a headshot hitbox, and she‚Äôs just wayyyyyyy too op
---
After months of playing with no luck yet, I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm not beyond thrilled, but congrats nonetheless. You lucky bastard.
---
Where do I download them?
---
Thank you :)
---
another one gets the drip haha
---
Just because an ash killed you, doesn't mean she's op
---
I‚Äôve never felt so much joy watching a video 
---
Thx
---
Nice.
---
I blame that headgear. It‚Äôs clearly the problem.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Damn... I suppose I'll keep with the portuguese then. Alright, thank you.
---
The revolver was also my first black ice
---
That was luck lol
---
would you really though
---
there is test server and custom game
---
I realise Doc is invincible during the revive animation, still didn‚Äôt stop me from raging a little bit ha.
---
You did unexpectedly good?
---
It‚Äôs not really Ubisoft‚Äôs fault when someone on the other team DDoS‚Äô you. If you meant DDoS as in the servers shit themselves then that‚Äôs a different story.
---
Honestly, why don't they look like this
---
I‚Äôm an Xbox gamer and I‚Äôve never really played pc except for Minecraft when I was little. How do you move slower on pc?
---
It's ok we all been there before 
---
what about a shotgun attached to the hammer, so that walls can be opened up from afar?
---
It‚Äôs only Terrorist Hunt.
---
I got this too but I still can't use the p90 for shit, the MP5 is so much better imo
---
Maestro‚Äòs looks like a pizza restaurant logo
---
 Damn, that looks great!
---
Then I stand corrected and I agree with you. 
---
Wow, ur a fucking loser
---
What skyrim mod is this?
---
You hold the alt key
---
How is green aussie?
---
Deadass gave her a Nailgun
---
He is not invincible during the animation my guy. He has all his health back is why he takes so much damage
---
I can‚Äôt watch it rn bc I‚Äôm in my car without earbuds but I watched about 2 minutes and it seems pretty good actually 
---
Lmao, perfect clip of fixes that needs a fixin'.
---
Yes you are absolutely the only one. He is a stupidly OP operator by design. Blocks up to 3 head shots in a game that revolves around headshots.
---
Ohhh ok thanks.
---
Yes, probs less ticks 
---
Q: "Should I do more?"
---
A: YES
---
I'd love to have options for my operator emblem. Cool stuff!
---
A lot of people want a new Tachanka, but there are still people who don‚Äôt really care too much about the game, and changing the way he looks would result in more negative feedback to the game, and some people would probably not play it as much, thinking that Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt care about what the community has to say about certain changes.
---
Oh ok I was always so confused 
---
Would you mind making one for Maverick 
---
That... is the worst legendary skin ever created
---
M A U I
---
I'm scared 
---
r/woosh
---
What
---
Not with every country though (Not because im trying to discriminate). For example the Frost and Maestro ones look really cool but the Tachanka, Jackal, and Mira ones don't look too good. The Jager one looks alright.
---
It‚Äôs not always just the killcam dude. Sometimes that shit happens to me while I‚Äôm alive.
---
I  M A D E  D I S 
---
No, Jackal does not need a nerf, he is currently balanced.
---
/r/vexology
---
A plan... in Rainbow Six? *Weeze*
---
Happens to every game eventually. Just a shame that the multiplayer market is so terrible right now that we have to play games we don't really like. 
---
now hold up- i didn't think there was anything even close to being as wide as gridlock...
---
Proud of you dude! 
---
Try reloading the game, normally that‚Äôs what adds the credits for me when they don‚Äôt show up at first.
---
Can't extract information from hostage if hostage is dead
---
i probably have 4-500 hours on this game and tbh i have no idea wtf the devs are working on... this is a great idea. (or you could just go through all 46 (i think) operators and check the skins you have for each of their 3-5 guns.. that would only take you like 2-3 hours.... after you screenshot them all and catalogue them in a folder (another 2 hours) you could have the same thing...
---
this man be playin from next year
---
yeet
---
Other than the fire rate, yeah
---
add me on xbox too if ya wanna play! OGSu5hi
---
is this joke or does it work?
---
Interesting fact though. I didn't realize it until now.
---
People don‚Äôt seem to be talking about the fact that people would just leave the game when this happens in game 
---
dude I just wanna get that legendary for doc's mp5 with the gold roses, black, and ivory 
---
Meanwhile I get shot in the shoulders and hand as blitz frequently, according to my killcams. Even if the kill cam is off, I'm still getting shot by people I'm head-on against while crouched. 
---
And I'm *really* far from a blitz main so it's not like I'm trying to protect my favorite broken character.
---
Point being, the whole thing is fucked. Needs to be a development priority to get this fixed, or maybe invincible mobile riot shields shouldn't be a thing if they can't get it done.
---
Who needs friends when you can play R6 Siege with a bunch of randoms.
---
Okay so if you forgive &amp; he kills again, doesn't have to be same player he killed before, he'll get kicked &amp; banned, yes? 
---
And if you don't forgive does he get kicked/banned or does he now get RFF? 
---
If you now have RFF after not being forgiven &amp; you try to kill someone you will kill yourself, yes? If so does this mean you just die &amp; game continues or you die &amp; then get kicked? 
---
*When you're trying too hard to gain karma...*
---
You should make a wallpaper with the mozzie one because that is sick
---
Yeah, they put other things in the TTS but not this.
---
Explain...
---
Why?
---
Nice gomitz
---
I feel like Vigel being immune just breaks lions gadget. The whole point of it is that you reliably know if someone moves. I mean mute jammers stop it, but only in a small radius. With the changes it might not be that bad though since it basically only tells you what area they are around if they move.
---
‚ÄúImagine when pros get a hold of this‚Äù 
---
are you seriously that dense. you honestly think the pros will see this strat and think that it‚Äôs a good Idea? i dont think copper 4s would think that‚Äôs a good idea. if they even put the reflective team damage in pro league i can assure you that no pro is dumb enough to do this 
---
 The one shot mechanic is still more realistic than taking 'damage' with tactical bullet proof armour.. 
---
It's still more realistic than a hand or arm blocking a bullet straight to the face. 
---
Still more realistic than surviving quite happily a bullet straight to the throat.
---
There has to be a point where it become impractical to add these things reliably into a game.. 
---
They can't even get shields to be reliable lol. 
---
TaChunky‚Äôs looks pretty dope
---
Like a phone wallpaper with just moxies icon
---
Again, watch the full video, for the longest time everyone could hit the shoulders of shield operators. Not shoot right through them [even when they line their crosshair up right next to edge of the shield](http://prntscr.com/n0siy9). (0:49) 
---
This isn't about the "fixed" hitboxes, we know Ubisoft changed the whole headshotting headphones shenanigans but this shit is completely different. Take a look again starting from 0:58, doc shoots through blitz's index finger, with the second shot finally hitting on the exact same spot, he then proceeds to fire again and to no surprise, it goes straight through blitz's thumb twice.
---
or all shield operators might just be.. idk, deformed, having child sized arms as grown ass adults while wearing extremely oversized shoulder plates.
---
This is so sick
---
it's because its body armour not his physical body this was part of a hit box change back in like Operation:Health when most of the larger ops where total shit
---
That's how it should be. Good job Ubisoft please dont mess it up.
---
For the revolver, nice! 
---
I have it for the mp5 AND the revolver 
---
Well thats dumb because what if one of my friends gets plat before me and um one game out at gold 1
---
well let her know the people here think she did an amazing job! 
---
Nice my first and only Black Ice is for the G36. 
---
I like this much better! 
---
I've done that with iq, don't have the clip though
---
Gang gang
---
perfwct
---
Dunno about Xbox gifting, but you could probably get on her account easily enough and buy them that way.
---
Maybe you're so dense you think they won't. Why so harsh? When I said that I meant they can make up way better strats than me thinking of Fuze &amp; Ash. Capit√£o's Asphyxiating bolts or Smoke's toxic babes can work too. 
---
Always down to play, add me ObeliskAvarice
---
Alright I‚Äôll see what I can do...
---
I will be your friend what‚Äôs your ign
---
But you could test with a friend, not you but someone who has a friend.
---
Either fluff or gameplay but you might as well delete this post because they‚Äôre not cheating
---
Yeah i know, just can't afford it.
---
My ping is still extremely consistent tho
---
Nice that was my first black ice too congrats sadly I don't own rainbow on PC yet but  I play it on PS4 if you looking for a sqaUDM8
---
Kid brain imo.
---
happens to me 24/7 when i play mav

What is the other Bandit flag?

A Attacker Interrogating A Defender, The Tables Have Turned :O
---
Sometimes it's hard to get 4 friends who are free at the same time :|
---
They are two different versions of the German flag. I wasn't too convinced of which one I preferred
---
Thermite is amazing
---
anything is better than solo queue even if its just one
---
Arnt the icons the same colour as the rest of the team they're from?
---
I know, but I was saying the ops prior to that were always that price. 
---
If you score a goal with it someone yells from a building.
---
Actually even in diamond league hes pick / win rates aren't anything extraordinary, according to the designer's notes.
---
well statistics wise yes but still...
---
Yeah, us players even recommended it when we thought about different ways to balance him back when he released. But no, the player's ideas never matter! We're developers we're always right!

Yo, I‚Äôm on east IS servers on Xbox.  My gg is DrSPYNE add me if u want and I can help u learn the game. (I‚Äôm assuming ur somewhat new since it‚Äôs ur first black ice)  is be down to play with anyone tho

and once again i agree but that is not the major part of the comunnity, is it? is that so hard to understand?
---
Glad that you like it!
---
Welcome to the club! I got mine for glaz' rifle and am pretty happy with it.
---
No 
---
games always start with 5v5 stacks or not so i dont see the relation.
---
Thanks!
---
Wanna play sometime??xbox??
---
ask UBI for them
---
yes they are i'm just changing them
---
The first shots when doc aimed at blitz near his fingers were high hitting the wall, that's why the second time he shot at his fingers he aimed a little lower third shooting him in the finger. You might need to get the video, slow it down and zoom in to see where doc aimed exactly. And yes we've known mele range for shield Oporators are inconsistent which does been to be fixed.
---
With a Riot Shield as Primary and the M9 with tactical knife as secondary 
---
There is no feeling quite like your first black ice
---
Pulse‚Äôs icon is just the icon for the entirety of the FBI.
---
No, because I usually take him
---
The current system is the mean of everyone.
---
Higher elo should weight more as simple as that.
---
Had this happen a few times.
---
How rare are black ice skins. I played this game on and off over like 2 years and im only level 37 i think? And i have like 3-4 of them. They look great but i assumed it was like getting a covert item in counterstrike. 
---
Spicey my dude. 
---
Would you object to me using one of these for my Uplay display pic?
---
Bandit pleaseeeeeee
---
So civilized
---
Probably because they favour shock drones over normal drones, i shoot normal drones before and after I  have found a twitch if I have all drones that is
---
explain to me how
---
My first one was on the smg-11
---
You know, despite how toxic this community can be this post really shows why you can't just judge a games fan base by the negative stuff that gets spread all across the internet about them. Congrats on the black ice btw:)
---
How rude.  I‚Äôd like to see you contribute something meaningful to the sub. 
---
Also, as I was editing more and more of them I realized I could do more stuff so I started trying to get different variations. I hope it is not very confusing to watch, but I believe that what I did allows both the logos and flags to eb appreciated
---
And if you look at my ping, it‚Äôs 95. It‚Äôs almost as good as any other person in my region since the closest servers are in Singapore. 
---
So i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs attributable to my connection. 
---
You'll have to pick between lion and Dok. Lion is going to be frikking powerful despite the nerf, and Dok is as always, good.
---
Personally, I took lion since I love the concept of an echolocator, but that's just me though.
---
Thankfully for you, TTS is live, so you can try out both and take a call.
---
Aah yes, somebody downloading waluigi hardcore porn can often f**k up your net.
---
Happens. Faced it multiple times.

Hope you didn't burn that salt.

I'm so sorry lol

*The Flash phasing intensifies*
---
I know the roni (or atleast similer weapons) are used by securities as a cheap weapon instead of a  standard rifle which costs more and much heavier
---
Is it possible to set the time to a random number to never ever achive a pattern? Like C 50-120 ?
---
Seconded.
---
Even Minecraft is a better game.
---
Supreme Horsecock porn also does it.
---
nice! i got mine a day before you, for ashes g36c
---
Looks like a match made in charm heaven with my Dokkaebi Computer chip
---
As a Montagne main, i can confirm that this black ice is truly magnificent.
---
Every other challenge over the past three weeks except this one could be completed by solo queue guys. So there‚Äôs that.
---
Oh Lord.
---
Don't give me ideas to mess up my night! I'm travelling!
---
Ah, okay. I was just curious if there was something I wasn't getting. They're neat, I'm especially fond of the GIGN ones.

Ikr. I don‚Äôt even use bandit.

I‚Äôm 124 and I still don‚Äôt have one
---
finally? you got are lvl 48 and got the best black ice on defense
---
Congratulations! üéä‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Yeah looked at it. He is a tool
---
when i was lvl 100 there were no alpha packs
---
Because no one will take as it's considered BM. Also, there's a fear that if you choose lion first, you're basically allowing the other team to pick him, and nobody wants to go against lion
---
Ubi released the ops and ash first then twitch 
---
personally, tachanka genuinely looks sick
---
Hey man I'll be your friend, always looking for new buds to play with, if you're on PS4 add me, my reddit is my PSN, just add a message saying you're from reddit tho 
---
*AUTISTIC SCREECHING IN THE DISTANCE*
---
that's a fucking meme my dude
---
I can't wait to actually get to play him, it's always been far too dishonourable since he was released
---
I dont think this will stop the intentional TKs at all. you already got kicked after 2 so trolls worked around that. Only way to prevent it fully is to remove Friendly Fire all together honestly.
---
Bandit 
---
Maybe unpopular opinion but does it piss anyone else off when people share cool stuff on reddit and they say something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that good‚Äù. If you didn‚Äôt think it was good you wouldn‚Äôt be sharing it, absolutely drives me insane.

It's more who you are best with, in my opinion.

I've been plat 1 last season and 2 before that and that was just playing with my main and having a good team to play with. 
---
Friends are for pussies 
---
Can it not be a projectile idk I just had the idea it‚Äôs up to the developers to be creative 
---
I'm currently lvl 305 and kept every pack I've got along the way. I swear if I don't get a black ice imma delete the game 
---
No, I don't believe they can track mouse movement. However there is a massive difference between a mouse macro and a keyboard macro.
---
For your keyboard macro you don't need the game to be open. You can just code one in any given software and it'll work.
---
For a recoil macro you'll need to inject code into the game. So while BattleEye can't detect the mouse movement it can and will eventually detect that code is injected into the game

The forgive system is for accidental tk not intentional. Disabling friendly fire would be catastrophic because you can do ridiculous strats. For exaple, you can fuze a room and rush in at the same time. No one can do anything if there are explosives going off everywhere and 3 to 4 people rushing in at the same time. One more example I can come up with is holding the same angle with your teammate. If you don't need to worry about accidentally landing a headshot on your teammate, the one person trying to push the angle will have no chance whatsoever. Friendly fire is necessary in r6.
---
Exactly, but given how lion is still going to get powerful, and picked a lot, it would make vigil a near 100% pick.
---
Also my pipi
---
I have a friend who has played 500+ hours combined for Xbox and PlayStation and he hasn‚Äôt got it yet (and he really wants it) but his brother got it in his first alpha pack. Guy was raging.
---
Did you even see the 3 handshots? Exact same location 2 phased through while 1 hit.
---
And I genuinely hope they do. Both for lion and vigil.
---
Why are people downvoting you? You‚Äôre giving correct information 
---
Is the 417 bad?
---
Could of just fuze the second wall with pucks and then blow it up. And yes fuze is Russian comrade all the way lol
---
Boooooooo
---
Looks interesting, but I won't ever use it over my Spartan Authority legendary. 
---
Got black ice on buck's gun, fuze lmg, this one too, spetnaz's hand gun.... But can't get that charm... Why ubishit whyyyyy
---
I've never seen that breach before! I'll have to try it out
---
I‚Äôd say Kapkan and J√§ger are definitely honourable mentions as well
---
Btw how do i set this main operator?
---
&gt; Acog is supposed to help with long range and aim, not supposed to help you see things that other people cant see. 
---
Do u realize how contradictory that sounds?
---
i know its a form of art, don wory just dont hurt timmy the tree next time 
---
I tried tho
---
I get my aim was pretty bad around here but it was my first game back on for like two days and I just wanted to hop into some casual and mess around with a few synergies I found with characters 
---
Kindly delete yourself
---
This looks awesome. You are really talented!
---
Yeah I know, but the second spray was right on her and at least one of those should‚Äôve been a head
---
Ohhh i like it alot! Nicely done!!! 
---
fuze wants to talk to you
---
The background compliments the cosplay too! And the gun looks just like the real thing! ^^

‚ÄúEsports ready‚Äù
---
True!
---
I have to assume the tree is a big thicc block and hibana borrowed ashes hitbox for a little. Nevertheless I just thought it was funny. I started laughing my ass off after the game ended and had to send the clip to my buddy 
---
Do you play on PS4 op?
---
I remember getting black ice i thought it was just a skin when my friend saw it he was trippping
---
You should see my trying to control hibanas rifle. It‚Äôs the worst gun for me. I don‚Äôt know why but controlling that specific gun is impossible for me
---
your should be shooting a few bullets at a time and not just spraying your full mag out it realy helps 
---
Maestro is incredible, I really like Cav's too!
---
Go through his comment history there‚Äôs a reason he doesn‚Äôt have many friends lmao
---
I can count the pixels in this image
---
I'll show it to my friend so he'll get angry, thank you (he's  level 90 something and hasn't gotten one yet, got my first around level 30 and my second the first pack of the test server :) we make fun of him)
---
Yeah, I tend to forget about burst a single tap modes too, I recently remembered while playing as ela and I used it recently with hibana and it‚Äôs definitely helped me control her gun a bit more. For some reason though it‚Äôs mainly just her I have a lot of trouble with. Most other guns I can fire like a laser even in fully auto. Like even in fully auto I can be really accuracy with the scorpion but I still throw on burst for longer ranges.
---
considering it was op with hibana, i miss the the bearing with echo it gives him a shotty role like smoke does
---
Bandit and IQ are my mains for serious play. I switch it up for certain maps but that's mostly what it is
---
Huh
---
No they disable 
---
you dont need to switch modes it much beter to stay in full auto and do it your self cuz if your in full auto you can still panic spray
---
Nice man what platform are you on we can play 
---
I love my arctis 7 good range comfortable and everything but they easily slip off your head but u get used to it pretty fast I have never tested that hyperx but if it's leather u are probably going to sweat much more
---
Gridlock is the hottest operator. Change my mind.
---
Sucks dick, gives disease. 
---
Well then I'm not the lucky one YOU ARE
---
You need to crouch spam while leaning than its a real cosplay. (Nice cosplay tho well done)
---
What's up with everyone wanting black ice though? I much rather have an exclusive weapon skin on all my guns instead of half of them being black ice. I have six black ices now and i only use one because it's my only skin on that gun. 
---
She‚Äôs a lefty?
---
Chemistry ? Lmao there is zero communication during the game i flame them after we lose
---
If you're just starting out you need to be able to make more than 50k every 3 month's to be able to eventually get all the ops.  Even with Ubisoft reducing the price of older operators once a year, there's still quite a large gap to overcome.
---
I want it to stay. I don‚Äôt really have much reasoning as to why, I just would prefer to have it.
---
I like certain aspects of tower like lurking in elevator with cav no one expects it but yeah it is ass 
---
I think Black Ice is probably one of the best looking skins for a gun, other than the pro league skin. Some legendaries are wack man 
---
So many people do it that everyone expects it now
---
I agree. They should do a rework of it tbh. They should also bring back old Hereford base an name it Test Site or something like that
---
Is it out?
---
r/suicidebywords
---
They should just remove tower all together
---
Okay thank you 
---
Got it for the best weapon in the game aswell, I'm jealous af
---
What s happening? Do they want to change it? Hitreg already broken as it is.
---
It's coming my son. 
---
Hi! Awesome piece of work! But can you put up high res ones seperately? Please
---
I almost had an ace with Frost the other day and this Glaz killed me when I had 4 kills. 
---
So close. (I had 3 health)
---
weird flex but ok
---
[removed]
---
Hey I just joined the Black Ice club few days ago with a GSG9 pistol
---
Top kek on the end
---
Pengu from G2 and the Godly Noob posted on Twitter saying they want to change 1 shot Headshot to either caliber based, so DMR's woulf still kill in 1 shot to the head but guns like Ela's Skorpion would take 2 or more. They are saying it would raise the skill ceiling. 
---
I would like to keep it because i love Siege's mechanics rn
---
The one shot headshot is what makes rainbow a unique and competitive game. Taking out would eliminate that sudden death mentality that makes the game so competitive
---
If you started unlocking operators from y1 and forward, you should be able to unlock a lot more than if you unlock the newer ones. 
---
Also playing more during holidays and weekends will net you about 70k a season, enough for a handful of old dlc operators as time goes on.
---
This has happened to me before. Everything works fine except for the hitreg. I can move, see others move, install barricades, reinforce wall, put down gadgets and shield, literally everything else works fine EXCEPT for the hit. I knew this when I was on defense and couldn't destroy drones even tho I was fucking pumping shotgun shells into them. 
---
I like it. It rewards weapon choice and accuracy. While I may not like how spraying out rounds like a water hose (maestro lmg looking at you), I do think that one shot headshots when people kill me are either the first shot, or they control their recoil well enough that I can still respect the headshot.
---
Well, welcome to the club lad!
---
I mean he did die later. Idek lmao
---
I also have it on pulse and doc both on their smgd
---
but they lost this one
---
I agree
---
damn this game really is busted 
---
oh damn
---
That's the point, everything works fine except for the hitreg. I can move, see others move, install barricades, reinforce wall, put down gadgets and shield, literally everything else works fine except shooting. I knew this when I was on defense and couldn't destroy drones even tho I was fucking pumping shotgun shells into them.

I feel the same

He died this round and we won so idk
---
Learn different play styles. 
---
1. Play Objective ( Don‚Äôt roam ) 
---
2. Roam Only ( Learn Maps ) 
---
3. 50/50 Obj Roam
---
4. Speed (kills or obj) 
---
I feel like once you get the hang of this everything will flow like clockwork. Also communicate with your team as to what they plan to do for the match.

ooF

Thank you for clarifying. I totally agree with you and as i mentioned above the hit reg is already iffy, by changing the 1 shot/hs mechanic i only expect an even worse performance from the game.
---
Huh, the way he was acting seemed like he was toying with you and knew he couldn't die. How he kept running out into the hallway without shooting at you and just ducking back.
---
Agreed
---
Also buff ela

That's fair. I believe there's a new mode for players who have never played before. I'm not entirely sure what it is since only players under a certain level can play. Hopefully if Rainbow promotes that mode correctly it could help the problem of toxicity towards people who are learning 
---
Have a nice ban.

Yep, that's what I was wondering. how tf am I able to do everything else without getting lagged the fucc out of.

I'm not complaining about realism in siege, it's nonexistent at this point, and I'm okay with it. I'm not okay with this interaction between these two specific operators.

You get paired with plat 3 and 2 because ranked is not suppose to be that you always stay a the same skill level. When you get high gold rank you start getting better opponents because that is the only way to get to higher ranks. This is something a lot of people don't seem to understand
---
Enjoy blinding the team
---
I hear you, I agree, every operator should have a counter. All I'm saying Vigil shouldn't counter Lion, because their abilities work completely different. I'm not saying Lion shouldn't have a counter.
---
Who don‚Äôt you have?

No wonder he doesn't have any friends.

I mean it can legitimately be hard for other people to make friends. There are people who are too awkward, and don't know how to start conversation and stuff. And the only way for them to be able to talk is if someone talks to them first. Not having friends because you are an asshole is a different story though.

I get that but its rebounded in a great way

Dude was born in Boston

Damn got him
---
Still a terrible idea there are plenty of tools to learn i had the same system and i learned eventually its about the time you put into the game. The system proposed is suited to a more casual gaming crowd not people that put time in

Why do I feel like every time Ubisoft fixes something something else breaks lol
---
Not sure exactly why, but make sure you have the year 4 pass installed as it‚Äôs separate to the game

It‚Äôs only rare if you want it for a specific operator, because you never get it.

Try to activate the always on ping display in the game options. If you are then able to get a recording of a red latency symbol with a true ping under 100 then, and only then, there is a problem.
---
I'm pretty certain that the Lion "rework" will kill him. A bit ober the top if you ask me.
---
But let's see how it will turn out.
---
True, if I was to re-design her icon I would put a target in her eye.
---
Because that‚Äôs a point I‚Äôve already discussed and moved on from.
---
you know that theres already a pro player named mint? If you search anything related to r6 + mint, nothing of yours will come up.
---
Every operator needs a counter of some sorts, even though it‚Äôs not directly in line with how the ability works, vigil and mute should counter lion.

We all know the Bearing 9 and SMG11 were in a good spot before the SMG12 was brought in. It's strange how 1 gun ruined 3. Hibana is strong regardless of what secondary she has. Echo with 2 Yoki is now a must have on a coordinated team. Vigil has a top tier primary and Dokki has a universal ability. Smoke is strong with site denial and Sledge is a fragging machine regardless of secondary. I hate that the SMG secondaries have become so hard to use, but I can appreciate the high skill ceiling and balancing to already strong operators.
---
They release it usually in the middle to the near end of the next years first season
---
Scottish variation for Sledge but why no English variation for the other boys? Sledge is just as equally British as the rest of them 
---
I like it! Maybe add a way to see most and least used ops for the squad

---
the planks are no 2/4 so I doubt the fragments would be slowed down enough to not be very harmful and the blast is quite strong anyways so imo AT LEAST the player should go DBNO from that
---
*Ka-kraww*
---
Yeah gj on your account but damn that team was bad
---
I'm trying to stay hydrated !!
---
Mute pls
---
Yeah I agree it just hilarious going to shoot someone and I damn near hit the ceiling trying to buy shot someone.
---
Thanks, Ill remember that when I edit my next one!
---
Every week sounds a bit too much especially since people who have literally all week to play can just play the op and get all the use out of him and then get bored. Maybe a couple days would be better.
---

---
This isn't a hitreg issue, this is a network issue, on your end; most probably upload got tanked...
---
You could see the other clients updating, but they had a hard time seeing you. The Bandit, when proned in Janitors, is shooting at your previous position, indicating that you're lagging behind, indicating that you're not sending packets to the server fast enough = upload speed is f\*cked.
---
Disable all windows features that hog network resources by setting your connection to "Metered connection" or disabling them manually through "services.msc", then be sure that you're down running any 3rd party services that do uploads in the background.
---
No it means they prob lost some eloü§î Also matchmaking also mixes people of different ranks but not like copper vs plat 2. Of course you have to face better player than you at some point.
---
No. Like I said he's one speed plus he would have lackluster weapons
---
Good to hear fam, it never ceases to amaze how stupid the little things matter and how easy it is to overlook them
---
Easily Kapkan. Best mvp anim by far.
---
I honestly have nothing to gain by lying about the ping. I genuinely want to know what kind of a network issue would would result in this situation where I can do everything properly but shoot. Atleast then I won't be like wtf. 
---
Dang downvoted that quickly? Lion dokke main? Was looking for discussion. 
---
Next question: how many conventions is it prohibited by?
---
Dude toasters are probably better lmao
---
I'd like to get the Fuze icon in full scale pls :) Thats profile picture material there!

Btw: Could you maybe try to do a Kapkan one? c:
---
I just don't understand 1 thing people crying about bugs ang glitches, ubi trying to fix them and then everyone is crying
---
I know the updates are to big but don't cry this mutch 
---
&gt;Vigil being immune is the dumbest thing introduced to the game
---
If we want to dig into the pseudo-realistic explanation of how ERC-1 works, we can assume it could work like this
---
-Lion sends an input to the aerial drone
---
-Aerial drone scan the area
---
-The information on the position comes back to the aerial drone
---
-The aerial drone output is intercepted by the ERC-1
---
-ERC-1 rebroadcast the output while erasing Vigil
---
-Lion receive the aerial drone output without Vigil
---
Personally I'm not a fan of the nation flag logos but I can see why people like them.
---
Yep

This sounds AWESOME!!!

Ironically, it would appear *you* read incorrectly. He said there's no way OP has a girlfriend *because* OP's feet (pictured) look like that.
---

Oh look a more fun game.

Kalos is like i say oh well then  : ) but have a nice day !!anyway
---
When your holding the black mirror they cannot see you? What does it look like from their view?
---
Shoot them pussy
---
Nice job man
---
If u use a drone on plane to detect vigil from all the way across the map it'll still hope his image range doesn't mean amything
---
It was lol
---
Yeah I like that, but it doesnt compensate for the nerfs
---
Varsity Gaming has Siege School Series up on his channel. Start from the beginning. 
---
Or no? She seems very balanced and is a 1 speed which is pretty rough on attack. You can destroy her trax by simply shooting them or if you‚Äôve got good reflexes you can shoot the very first one and destroy them all. 
---
Why is this a thing? Fun is entirely subjective and if your idea of having fun is playing comfortably or casually and expecting to just slay, you shouldn't join Ranked, simple.
---
Wtf I've faced that issue too, but usually that happened when I was definitely lagging. As in everyone was rubber banding for me. Then knifing was the only thing that worked 
---
If you are unsure which weapon you should play, watch the videos from Rogue-9. He produces videos about the guns, some maps and settings which you should change
---
It's not blocking the movement part, it's just interfering with the output signal from the aerial drone to Lion
---
Back in the day when the whole operator model was part of the hitbox (Ammo pouches, armour pads, earmuffs) it felt so broken that there was quite a bit community outcry to get it fixed.
---
I was one of the players who completely stopped playing until they fixed the hitboxes back in Operation Health and I would probably stop playing again if the whole operator model would be part of hitbox.
---
I really think that only the human part of the model should count as a hitbox. I wish there was some visual representation when you hit armour that's not part of the hitbox though, like little spark or puff of dust.
---
I disagree. Especially with the secondary comment the headshot makes guns like the smg-11 viable and allows more varied gameplay, despite being a secondary why should it not be able to compete against a primary? In most situation a primary would be better but if u play carefully control ammo and recoil the smg rewards you with a headshot so I would say having the headshot mechanic creates more variety and balance (in terms of secondary weapons) Removing the one tap on secondary‚Äôs would also make operators like monty less viable.

My intention was not to be arrogant.

Ahahahah if I remember right, I was playing on a bed, wasn't enough space for an arm player. My sense is 10 10 80 and 400dpi so playing in that cramped space was hard üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You put a marker on it like you wanted someone to take him out for you lol

Same good job

The problem is there is no way to know where the armor ends and the shoulder begins. It‚Äôs pretty clear he was shooting where his shoulder SHOULD be, and where his hand SHOULD be, but nothing happens 
---

It sounds like a really good idea because then everyone know that you look superior before they see you
---
And the point we're making is that's bullshit and glaz is holding that angle in the correct way. Crouch or prone if you don't wanna be shot
---
Not really. I have made tons of Operators, and i posted this one cause i think it would fit in the game very well. And change that Recruit Main. Its not funny.

This needs to come to the main game before next season, badly. Lion is still a massive problem, capitao just needs the buff in my opinion, I like where his kit is going and I think the bolt trajectory change could add a tremendous amount of skill to him.
---
Your wrong I'm wasting my time you are the issue not the game vertical play is a basic idea go above any site see if you can play it vertical simple no small map pool needed team comps you need a team in the first place maps dont matter as much for team comps super basic set ups super easy to learn if you have team mates who have played more angles slow down your play you will find angles there are too many to learn anyways. you are wrong and just need to put more time and thought into your play and who you play with work on yourself instead of coming up with ideas on how the game would work better for you or the few
---
then why we don't have this issue as NVIDIA users ?
---
Don't forget the "is this legendary new?" Posts every week when there are tons already posted

No ETA

If I need to pass by someone ADS I crouch or crawl. Sometimes I crawl under windows anyway while passing them to avoid the chance of being shot.

But the game is not compiled for a specific CPU but AMD64 ISA which is handled by both AMD and Intel CPUs. I did not checked the amount of RAM the game uses on my machine but does the game crash because of your free RAM depleated? How do you notice that there is a memory leak?
---
Not if I initiate the vote first for running into my sights!

I got a PC and R6 for it 2 months ago, haven‚Äôt played that much there but finished gold 4 last season, I believe I‚Äôm level 45. One can still dream

No that won‚Äôt change, they need to change the reverse friendly fire to team damage not kills. So if I do 100 damage tot he team it institutes.

Your not hiding sound. You can't hide light that drones receive. You are hacking the drone so that it doesn't display the visual feed on the attackers screen.

I guess you have no idea how different components work. Lol.

Vigil is still one of the best roamers in the game, amazing at stalling, it‚Äôs a nice buff but in the end it won‚Äôt be a massive change for him.

Her gadget takes skill mate sorry. Shoot them. Or shoot gridlock she‚Äôs a bad op. 
---
Not really over powered if you only give him 1 or two. It could stop a lion scan or dokke call but bmaybe disable a twitch or not affect thermite/ hibana. There are a lot of ways to make it a balanced op. not an unbreakable mute jammer. It would only last for the time it is deployed, like 1-2 secs, not until you destroy it like mute. Maybe it can have a piece of hardware that is setup on the site and can be destroyed? I think a way to stop and counter the global abilities is needed as they are in the game and not going anywhere. by limiting the number of deployments to 1 or 2 you could never counter all gadgets on the map.

Exactly. Kaid can

It was probably a 5 stack though.

Fabian and a couple other pros have confirmed that there is a bug with the sound this season, I'm sure ubi knows about it and is working on a fix because they usually listen to the pros. It's not just the new map being made wrong, it's on every map. People on the left sound like they are on the right or you hear people upstairs and through a door at the same time- it's not broken 100% of the time but it's still really important they fix this.

Don't hold an angle please, please, do it for your own sake :)

One of my friends had that happen to him once, I could still see him and TKed him, the next round he was fine, but it was very strange, he was spawned into the game normally for everyone else, but his view was stuck some random place just like yours, and he couldn't move.

As a chemical weapon, it is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. Pursuant to UN Resolution 687 its production and stockpiling was outlawed globally by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) of 1993, although Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan have not ratified the CWC (thus not outlawing their own stockpiling of chemical weapons).

Cyclosarin or GF (cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate) is an extremely toxic substance used as a chemical weapon. It is a member of the G-series family of nerve agents, a group of chemical weapons discovered and synthesized by a German team led by Dr. Gerhard Schrader. The major nerve gases are the G agents, sarin (GB), soman (GD), tabun (GA), and the V agents such as VX. The original agent, tabun, was discovered in Germany in 1936 in the process of work on organophosphorus insecticides.

Headshots are one-hit, there were two shots fired. Sometimes people get lucky with the first or second shot. I‚Äôm not saying the game isn‚Äôt fucked up at times, but there‚Äôs definitely a bullet trail here to follow.

Maybe, but impossible to tell. I mean just from the fact of how the guy shot just a burst of 2 bullets makes me think he saw my head and just tapped it. If he just saw my hands I bet he would have kept shooting while coming down.

I know I fail to see what removing the acog did for her. She is known as the rusher tbh and removing her acog just forces players to use a reflex or holo witch also makes her stronger in close proximity. Encoriging her to get closer lol. Just how I see it though.

28 HP. He shot your hand. You died. No hitbox issue to report here.

Casual: Nope, he's being a dick and deserved it also you gave him a warning.
---
Ranked: Yes, sometimes you just have to deal with asshole teammates, I had some guy yesterday TK me in a 4-4 ranked match (he was going 0-2-8 I was 8-2-3) and we then lost the game. Not because I died but we didn't have a full squad. Just got to deal with shitty people sometimes. 
---
Twitch main here. Yes I hate that exact spot.  I found a work around by using that rock as a ramp.  You have to gain some momentum and keep reversing and going forward. 3 out of 10 times it makes it over.  A pain.

---
true but the recoil and the damage just kill it for me and when in a game like siege not to sound like some tryhard but headshots are everything, but ammo capacity is king in the role that gridlock plays most of the time
---
Good strat. 
---
I thought she was doing drugs at first glance
---
Ubisoft don‚Äôt take any action when players manipulate the matchmaking to boost players 
---
It's not that big of a nerf. It's basically everyone that moves is pinged like they shot an alibi or can't move for 2 seconds. And the timer being shorter means it's harder to avoid detection. It's less of a entry breacher or fraggers support role and more of an intel gathering one, which is fine.

Yeah, that doesn't look like a connection issue. Either your position desynced from the server (still shitty), killcam bugged (still shitty), or the new lean fucked some stuff up (very shitty).
---
Maverick is kind of bad. People always seem to hear him burning through the walls and just shoot him through it 
---
Plus hibana‚Äôs guns are miles ahead of his 
---
Comprei o pack com aquelas skins que parecem couro e tem o 6 em dourado e ainda est√£o equipadas nos chars por√©m no menu a imagem delas aparecem como fossem as outras que n√£o est√£o mais dispon√≠veis. 
---
Maverick is decent, but you've got to be super sneaky with him. 
---
If you read the book the terrorists use a modified virus that the try to spray though air conditioning units that shut down the body than kills the host then becomes neutral extremely fast.I always thought that maybe the disease from the book could play into the game in some way.
---
Like i said, the main problem is not me being kicked, is me being banned FROM CASUAL.  
---
Let's go through the list of problems:  
---
1.- Hit detection - I shot the guy straight up in the head within less of 3 meters, and he was not moving. Wth? Even my friends when they saw the camera were confused, because the game ended because I killed the hostage.  
---
2.- We were a full squad - Like, how can I troll my full squad? And if i troll them they could kick me out or just not invite me to play. If i kill a friend is either an Accident or we're just playing jokes because we were a full squad  
---
3.- This is coming FINALLY but THAT FORGIVE BUTTON HAS BEEN LOOOONG OVERDUE. This would've saved the night.  
---
4.- Banned from Casual? Like... that's why we play casual, none of us take the game seriously, and I hate the "Be competitive" mindset, is just a videogame. That being said, it is perfect for people to want be competitive, so I agree separate them Casual - Ranked. I've played ranked a few times and it is not for me, people get waaay too upset and get frustrated rather quicly, in casual I can not give a f about the thing. Of course, I am never a Dick and I'm never team killing, this is my very first time being banned since Dustline, my first season.  
---
I agree getting banned when you do it for Ranked, but casual, with a full squad, on an accident? It is ridiculous, that it just destroyed our night. And worst thing is that it ended up with the team forfeiting, because again, is Casual, we just want to play together and because of the ban, i decided to go to Bed, wasn't going to wait 30 minutes.
---
Vertical sound is broken. 
---
We need that forgive button ASAP.
---
maverick is very good but has a different purpose to hibana. if you don‚Äôt have any defenders i would recommend either vigil or lesion
---
‚ÄúUnnessacary‚Äù I didn‚Äôt insult you, you‚Äôre so thin skinned and weak you took it that way. Chill out snowflake. Chin up. Calm down. Learn to grow up and stop being so hyper aggressive.

If you can hit those rocks right you can get over

I'm not offended by him because everyone has the right to say whatever they want, but you're just going that extra mile. I can take hate as you see. I didn't answer to his comment and let him be. You're making yourself victim right now bro. That's sad bro. Couldn't be me lol 
---
North america/chicago

Use whatever you want to use. 
---
Yeah, how did this take an entire year to come up with? These are such nonoffensive changes. Imagine working on something for 365 days and this is all you had to show for it. I thought this was gonna be a complete departure from his old design. All they did was make him less oppressive. Dev team continues to disappoint :)
---
Yes, it is 
---
Where is my sweet Dokkaebi Flag Icons :(
---
Oh no it doesn't stop me, I just choose to be a bit more selective about what I read (I know, that sounds like snobby reading but, hey, it's the truth)

---
Ah im in eu
---
To be fair it is an insult
---
Use whatever works best for you. That being said, using mouse buttons to lean is probably preventing you from using mouse buttons for gadgets, which is not ideal.
---
I hear TC is very descriptive. Is that true?
---
&gt;Make a game that has friendly fire as one of its most punishing features  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;No one plays the game like gun safety matters in the least
---
Why even fucking bother putting it in any more, honestly.
---
I wasn't arguing with anyone at all. Apparently you have no idea what arguing is. We were having a simple conversation. And what the hell do you call "learn how to read" is? A compliment??
---
I love team games where no one has a mic. Team games are so fun.

---
I feel so patriotic, and I'm not even American. 
---
Make me a third if you get it goin :)
---
One problem, the enemies can walk in range and barely be in range and this would let them escape easily.
---
That's what always confused me, twitch is supposed to be one of the smartest r6s ops, and built a lot of other ops gadgets, but compare her to Echo, echos drone can hover, jump high and turn itself invisible, and unleash 2 sonic bursts that recharge, what can twitch do? Send out 2 shock drones that just has a taser in it, it doesn't move faster, it doesn't jump like normal drones, it doesn't hover, it doesn't climb up walls, and the taser dosnt recharge. Seems kind of great value in comparison to others like Echo, or Maestro. Also, if people say "it's because she's a old op" lore wise, she should be able to upgrade her gadget.
---
With a big LMG you always win
---
And make the other opperators' asses spit fire so they can have a speed boost
---
Ok good job ignoring the fact that I pointed out stupid you are. You thought I went out of my way to click on your post and dislike it because you're toxic lol. That explains it all. 
---
It‚Äôs a good thing this is a team game.
---
What rank
---
Am I the only one that can even control the Bearing-9 atm?
---
Now they gonna TK you the next round even though it‚Äôs their fault
---
Smoke's gas could be hydrogen cyanide, it's a gas and requires a closed gas mask and external tank but not a full suit so not entirely sure. Also it's over anakin, I have the high ground! (toxic gas rises he dies). 
---
Nice. I'll pick it up
---
Kind of sad how these recolors of OP icons get thousands of upvotes, while a masterpiece like this barely gets any, and while the recolor of the OP icons may take some effort, not close to 3 months
---
was there anyone asking for that or any need? why did they do that? it is so random and i think it is worse now.
---
No gadget in the entire game is that complicated bro, that's terrible
---
Even worse..
---
Thay wasn't my point at all but sure thing man. Must be sad to not have a life like that that you have to point people out. It's okay man, not everyone can have a life

I checked the Twitter of rainbow six where I usually find the patch notes and I checked the most popular posts on here and a bit of the most recent ones but I didn't find anything so I decided to ask instead of scrolling for minutes till I find it. Thank you tho 
---
You get punishment for bad internet connection, no lag compensation anymore, if it works like intended ofc.
---
Look at the symbols right above.
---
Honestly it should let you spawn as a the operator the other player had picked as long as the other player never died or did anything like take damage, fire their gun, use their gadget, etc... 
---
Exact same fps and hardware with me. 
---
Oh hell no! But I find the recoil a bit more manageable when you just hipfire 
---
The activation range could be smaller than the effect range
---
&gt;There is no doorway to the rifght in that room.
---
Shows what I know! Still, it's objectively far safer to hold an angle with a little distance between you and the opening, especially as Glaz. If your rifle is sticking through the the doorway, it's not hard to figure out exactly where you are for a prefire, plus with the way perspective works, by standing closer to the window you run the risk of having your shoulder sticking out around the corner while you can't even see your enemy.
---
ok

---
So do I bro just lower your sens it's way too high if you have to spray like that when he's that close. 
---
Well are you gonna join Yeet Meister or what?
---
And get a full stack of plat2?
---
I dont know how the match making works, but it looks like the average.
---
Locking out higher ranks means friends cant play with friends if their ranks are off by a few notches 
---
Casual still has those trash maps in them. Also, thats not a fix for the issue, we should be able to ban 2-3 maps and have operator bans as well.
---
It‚Äôs not gonna be a major rework like Hereford was (which I personally liked), but it‚Äôll be more balanced with one of the major things being changed being the Bakery/Kitchen site being moved away from the Bakery entrance, making the top floor bigger and adding a 4th site.

not really... I'm just still thinking about it....

im just not sure.... 
---
I cant even draw a stick figure even if I had the whole day. As long as you can tell what something is you've done better job than I could. 
---
Maestro is the best operator they've introduced to the game since Mira. Excellent gun, excellent gadget.
---
Lol currently gold 1 and playing with silver and platinum like wtf
---
Like ads sense? I can‚Äôt play on low sense especially with extended aim stick, I always play on high sense. I play H:70 V:25 and ADS:23
---
Yeah wtf is this sub? I‚Äôm not subscribed to Microsoft paint.

They won‚Äôt release a Y3 bundle cuz of price reduction so get a renown booster and unlock em all

I noticed a bit of the right leg sticks when shield ops are crouching. Can you still hit these as well? 
---
You better not leave him hanging
---
yes
---
It doesn't. It actually used to be slower but they made it faster a long time ago to make it the same speed as normal drones. 
---
Try shorter aim stick and lower sense and try snapping on people's head, not that hard just takes practice in terrorist hunt. 
---
Toss it like yings grenade and it sticks to the ceiling 
---
I wish I could trade my black ices for jaegers gun. I have UMP 45, Fbi Pistol, G36C, and gign pistol
---
That would work.
---
Meaning stats with an individual operator.

Like zofia-678 kill ,307death etc

the general concept is as great as it is simple
---
 Vote to kick 3/4, not enough players voted to kick.
---
Ha! I could do better! Look at this drawing

*shows a drawing of a single line*
---
I call it: the stick!

I‚Äôll try lower sense, going back to shorter stick I‚Äôd be a huge potato as I‚Äôve been using them since cod bo2 lol and what dead zones you play?
---
Just did that, or something simmilar. I simply spend credits. Thanks for the reply anyway :-)
---
I suggest the app moot

Imma be honest with you chief. You rite. I tried to make them look good and jeez some are awful to make look decent

Which one should I go for?
---
Also,  the YouTube build...the guy says he should have bought a bigger case,  but doesn't clarify how big it should have been. So I don't know what to  do about a case. How do I know what cases will fit all of the  components?
---
I don't deal with peoples bullshit. I do have anger issues but I don't go starting shit with other people.
---
And an extra ACOG because accuracy matters
---
Oh man these were a couple weeks ago so I'm not sure if I can find them.  
---
Basically went like this:  
---
\-Stoned.Turtle joined server asking to play  
---
\-Admin said something like "wtf is this format nobody will play with you if you post like this, etc"  
---
\-Stoned.Turtle said no need to be toxic
---
\-Admin hit him with "LOL" and had no remorse for making him leave  
---
Goes against everything we are as a siege community. May not be overly toxic but we have higher standards for our admins, especially when it comes to the treatment of others in the server.  
---
No, I mean when you go into the operators tab and look at the very far right of the table, you see something called ‚Äòstat‚Äô
---
You need more recognition
---
Now it sounds like it's dragging on the carpet.
---
don't change screen mode with ALT+Enter
---
Definitely, as is tradition.
---
Not all of them but most of them
---
Do you know who they have?
---
So if his shoulder pads were removed there would be nothing sticking out from the sides of his shield. Even shooting his shooting hand seems to have little effect.
---
What should be done is make his actual hitbox equal to that of ALL other shield ops and then add the shoulder pads even further out than that.
---
downvoted watermark 
---
I was making a joke, sorry I'm English, sarcam is my default mode! But thank you, I appreciate the recognition!

Yea, but what rank is this. Someone leaving after second round. Enemies obviously not calling out. Not one person get a refrag. What rank is this
---
This looks substantially cooler than the originals

Lol I'm actually from hong Kong. I'm not disagreeing it would be hard, im just saying it's not a justification for it to just look more like the china flag out of respect. Again, many flags have stars, so saying it's okay for yings flag to look like the china one just because both flags have stars is illogical. I'm sure it's hard, but I don't think we shouldn't not try

Toxic players ruin games like this entirely.
---
What happened to you, is the same that happens to many people I'd imagine.
---
First casual match since I've been gone for a year. My team dies and i take my time to rush the last enemy as he had an angle on where everyone died, but time runs out as we start shooting each other. My team yells at me and tks me start of next round. Uninstalled immediately. Good bye R6: Siege. You were fun until you weren't.
---
What I did what I was starting out was that I'd watch pro play and see what we're the commonly picked operators, and I would get the ones I thought seemed fun
---
I think that most people run infront so that they can steal the kill instead. Some people are like that
---
Oh I thought they said 50
---
I‚Äôd like to see this.
---
I get those icons playing seige normally too but it's never that pronounced. Nobody seems to accept that so I just stopped trying lel. 
---
You sound like a achoring/Intel gathering playstyle. If like sitting either on the OBJ or in a spot on the map on your cams, finding the enemies, then flanking them or giving their positions away to your team, echo, alibi, maestro, and Mozzie are very good at Intel gathering. For attack, I recommend jackal, lion, and Maverick, as they are good at catching enemies off guard and easier for not only yourself, but your team as well, to track and kill. Like I said, this is just my understanding of your playstyle, so take everything I just said with a grain of salt and if I'm wrong and you hate all of the ops I just listed, I tried. Good luck to you.
---
You obviously missed all your shots , stop blaming hitreg
---
I love you 
---
Will do. Appreciate it.
---
No, I went through this clip frame by frame, with the recoil of gridlocks weapon the reticule still doesn‚Äôt come up to my head 
---
But but but 
---
Easily the best rendition of this trend 
---
I think you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs supposed to have tighter turns. I thought they reworked the speed, but according to the wiki it‚Äôs only ‚Äúsmoother to control.‚Äù
---
My least favorite part is how it says Round 19
---
quit complaining about the competitiveness of a competitive FPS. if you want a less competitive game then go play call of duty 
---
I‚Äôve been looking at Alibi and Maverick, worth? Those two seem like the would best fit me.
---
Ah, the ankle-high step. The age-old nemesis of the shock drone.

Hereford; that map is haunting me and my friends pretty much daily. We even came up with a quote "hereford a day keeps good rank away" we say it every time a match on Hereford starts.
---
It‚Äôs Tachanka saluting

I thought you will turn away and he‚Äôll land headshot on you instantly. 
---
Because I feel like if this does come to the live build it could drop the overall player count of the game and has potential to not make siege what we love it for

There‚Äôs a competitive mode though. Its called casual for a reason. Clues in the name bro

Yeah, what is he, illiterate? Smh my head.

That's true, but it could still have been a driver bug and the game update was just the thing that triggered it.

Is this a special ops team or a daycare?

I thought it was pretty common knowledge that you should run in front of someone who's aiming, but nevermind, apparently it isn't.

Well, the effective range of that gun is far shorter than that ACOG would even be worth trying to control. Unless you get a lucky headshot it would be unruly lol

They gave Gridlock a new sight to make her special same with Capitao and his LMG,the ACOG that was on the LMG for Capitao before was chunky and looked really weird, I highly doubt they'll go in and change the ACOG for the DMR's.
