maestro takes skill and teamwork

---
---
So, Lesion or maestro
---
yea maybe so

If youre playing as Lion on Bomb, save 2 of your scans for after the defuser is placed (if at all) and protect site. Dont be afraid to push first. Most of the time when i play i forget Lion even exists if unscanned, then they hit you with scans later on and i get panicky. Go 100 hours with Lion, even if stats are crap. It takes time to get to know an operator
---
Using MK on cobsole should be punishable by death
---
I agree. Even with a top end computer, it still takes me probably 75-90 seconds to get in. An average computer is going to take a couple minutes. This guy is just an angry little south pole elf.
---
Rook's icon is a castle...
---
I also used to get 200 FPS
---
Thank mate!
---
Only question I have then is how did I check angles incorrectly? Listen with sound and it sounds like she directly to my left.
---
bruh
---
The way I see Beaulo do it is press q + a at the same time and then e + d at the same time.
---
Nah, I don't have ocd
---
Maestro; the Alda is insane.

Heres another photo of the menu:

You cant spend money on alpha packs. They're renown only for purchase and you cant buy renown with money.
---
Download either AimLabs or Kovaaks. They have good tasks for practicing raw fundamentals of aim including reaction time. As for sens, shoot a hole in the wall, move around and track it. Play around with it and find a comfortable sens. Then set it and never touch it again.
---
Which one is better for roaming and detecting?
---
I prefer lesion for his speed, ability and loadout
---
Can we get a high level copper gang going?
---
cmon man you're making console users look bad
---
I don‚Äôt know how well maestro held up against updates and game changes. He was one of my favorites but Lesion is more fun in my mind. You can be terrifyingly good with lesion if you have good map knowledge and memories of each goo mine you threw.
---
Bruh moment
---
I don‚Äôt really see why you would have two semi auto pistols as secondaries but other than that the ideas aren‚Äôt that bad
---
you just get people who really want someone to blame for their own shortcomings, there is only one clear instance where i was right to blame the game after watching the kill cam, i've had a lot of debate-able deaths, however what annoys me the most is how much of an inconsistent player i am (it's an issue i need to sort i know) , lets say our first game i go 6 and 3 in ranked , fine that's a good score , my K/D is 2.00 for that game, next game in 4-4 and match point and i'm going 2-6 and yet , despite them only playing with me twice, once where i played well and once where i played bad , i get called crap and get kicked from the group, it's annoying, but at high gold it is understandable to some degree
---
As soon as they fix the exploits.
---
This way veterans don't get 200 packs lol
---
Better question: why do you have 3 FPS counters?
---
10fps
---
Yes
---
I have a 2080ti
---
thank you i will try
---
my god can you guys stop using this dead joke please
---
Not lag switches but a stress on your server. That's why it affects all your team.
---
Ok, batteries.
---
Also a teammate can just nitro the window and blow em allllll away
---
Then it's worth it
---
The truth is I turned my sensitivity up far too much and this was the result.
---
Ya...üò™
---
It should have a helmet too
---
My bad, that was poorly worded by me. What I mean is that you should've pre-aimed that door rather than peeking while you're still looking at the wall as it would've given you more time to react.
---
I see where you're coming from, but it's completely possible that not all of those people are m+k users. There are those people, but others like myself may just be playing on 100 horizontal sens, where it could seem like a mouse flick.

---
They're fixing glitches associated with them you over reacting 2 y/o. Ubi is trying to full out fix them instead of reintroducing them and have them be broken yet again. Also, frankly you're an idiot if you think tournaments make anywhere near as much as the ingame store.
---
drop shotting clash?
---
I mean I don't disagree, but a nerf is a nerf.. No matter how small, it's still a step in the right direction..
---
This last patch sucks for me, i main lesion and jacakal, winrate went up though somehow
---
&gt;At least one is gonna appear in a match by the way the probability
---
No, they wont actually. That is not how probability works.
---
The odds of *one of them* showing up are higher than the odds of a specific one showing up but they are in no way likely to show up in any given round. There are 8-10 operators on each side who are vastly more likely to show up.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 2 years and this season is just so disappointing. The new ops are just recycled content and the kafe rework is not what I hoped for. And I constantly get into ranked games and I get ddosed.  This season is just terrible especially when they seem to not know how to fix things
---
Mav's M4 has the closest feel to Ash's R4C in my opinion. You also have the benefit of both operators being 3 speeds. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The G36 is kind of unique in it's feel since recoil is almost nonexistent and the ROF isn't super low either. So it's pretty difficult to compare it to the other weapons but I guess it would be closer to Jackal's C7E than any of the other ones.
---
Maybe someone else will have a different or better opinion but as far as feel for the weapons those seem to be the most similar to me.
---
I like it for the most part, especially given you can vote on whether a kill was intentional or not, so accidents don't cause the debuff.
---
You could argue it should kick in after 50 points of damage, but then you'd loose the ability to vote on it being intentional, and tat would be detrimental to accidents
---
What was your process to make this?  
---
Nice job!!
---
If you‚Äôre willing to fuck up your mental health, yes
---
My disappointment is immersible and my day is ruined.
---
Woah... that's actually sounds awesome
---
Preach! New Hereford suck big dick
---
I agree with you. There's been plenty of people I've seen using controller that look just like they're using mouse and keyboard. Some people are just got tier on controller
---
Oh thank god I hated the ‚Äúcamper‚Äù achievement
---
Top end computer from 2008? lmao what the fuck are you chatting shit about
---
everyone loads instant and if your pc takes 75 seconds to load then it aint top end kid
---
He looks older than I thought
---
Absolutely fucking perfect lmao
---
Firstly, you panned your camera so fast that your reticle passed over her before you fired a shot. Secondly, even if she was directly to your left, why on Earth would you full body peek that? Third, due to over compensating on the first part resulted in her getting shots in you before your reticle was even on her. Nothing about this clip justifies a nerf
---
I'm down for this
---
They've acknowledged it as cheating, and one would assume they'd treat it like any other cheater, but I'm not sure how they can ban people on console for it.  
---
Like do they have to go through MS/Sony for permission to restrict access of a MS/Sony customer from accessing their game?  Is it harder to ban?  I legit dont know these questions, but I assume it cant be as easy to ban console players, otherwise we'd have battle eye and whatever.  I've also never heard of a console player being banned for rainbow for any reason.  
---
On a personal note, I've gotten over M&amp;K.  I've hit diamond twice now against these assholes just using a basic bitch controller.  I like to think my diamond charms are worth more than theirs!!!!
---
Exactly, I will however, say that the attempt for simple ops makes me feel a little better, considering the fact that they introduced a tnt cannon from Minecraft during wind bastion
---
i didn't had any ddosed game since the start of the season
---
Holy fuck. Do crouch only next
---
Oh sure, let's make Frost's elite gadget spiky, clunky, and obvious as hell when it's supposed to be a hidden in plain sight  mat, but Lesion's gadget that literally goes invisible has to be as nondescript as possible.
---
Dude it‚Äôs nothing to do with specs it‚Äôs ssd vs hhd and internet speed

2. My god I can only dream of clutches so dam juicy
---
Casual will be casual. Since Chimera a lot has changed so I'm not sure what you want to know specifically.
---
Yeah I get something about that on the menu too. Maybe ur mother board is bottlenecking because you get less FPS in action because it can‚Äôt process as much stuff as the gpu. What motherboard or cpu do u have?
---
I found out that a lot of pro players do this. I tried and ur reactions are better, u just need a little bit of practice. Don't worry
---
If ur wondering how to do it go on ps4 settings and go to accessibility
---
Lmfao I‚Äôm fuckin dead
---
I feel like maybe, with Echo, after shooting his first shot with a Yokai it could lose its invisibility for a while?
---
Companies would make so much money if they did this. 
---
For example every time I think of getting the Xbox version of COD (or any game for that matter) so I can play with my Xbox friends as well as my PS4 games, I don't do it because I can't transfer my stuff over. These are easy double-dip sales they could have for free if they let us do it.
---
Majority of the money came from packs dedicated to the tournament where players brought the packs in order to increase the prize pool. Similar to Dota and csgo.
---
Clash bug is not a money issue, its just a bug. It was fixed and people found ANOTHER NEW WAY to cause the same issue, its not the same bug.
---
Dropshoting is back due to them merging another fix into the game from a version that didnt have the DS fix. Stupid but not a money issue. 
---
Rank map pool again is a community issue, Cant reduce it without the casual community complaining, Cant increase it without the rank community complaining about it. 
---
If you cant understand the difference between marketing funds + development funds, you need to learn how companies run, especially game dev companies.
---
They should at least be able to tell which team its coming from and hand them the loss. That way they dont make it to high level by ddos. Sucks if you are on that team, but at least my 5 stack wont get ddos 5 games in a row, very sweaty OT games that end with no exp boost.

Same. I was there for Scott Weiland's final performance at the Welmont in NJ. He was with his band The Wildabouts and they played Do It For The Kids from Velvet Revolver for what had to be fifteen full minutes. EPIC. Died a week later along with the most recognizable voice in grunge. Ironically, a few months before that I saw Stone Temple Pilots with Chester Bennington and got to hold his hand as he joined the audience for Plush. GoPro'd it :D ... :*(
---
It puts you as recruit, it‚Äôs been on here a couple times.

There‚Äôs more than likely some sort of exploit for people to crash the server with an error. If a server were to run into an error that it couldn‚Äôt handle it would crash like that. It would try its damnedest to try and maintain the connection, hence why not automatic
---
Yea, because interfering with the online matches isn't against the TOS for xbox?

Level 111 here playing like bronze..
---
This is a general Rainbow six sub so discussing older and newer rainbow6 games is fair game. the new game will probably have another sub dedicated to it similar to how Battlefield has a general sub while having other battlefield 3/4/V subs so they can have specific discussions on the game.
---
How did u make it it looks really good
---
Oh wait I'm on joshes account so this is the OP, leme switch
---
Don‚Äôt play siege on a laptop
---
I dont understand why people say they are confused by the new Hereford, of course I still have fond memories of the old one but if you played a lot of the old one then the new one isn't that confusing. 
---
The overall layout is the same, but I wish they kept the old hereford in casual or something since I have really nice memories back in 2015 when I was new and learning Siege :3.
---
Quarantine is a rainbow 6 game. 
---
This sub isnt rainbow6 siege its rainbow6.
---
Discussion about other rainbow6 games are allowed.
---
Duck duck goose
---
If your laptop can run it and you have a mouse, I'd say go for it.
---
FPS games are always better on a computer, the mouse allows for much more accurate aiming.
---
It‚Äôs not possible for it to have been a 2 shot on a hypothetical 0 armor op the r4c can only do 39 damage.

Pretty noice flick there mate

Ranked too? Oof

Username checks out
---
I just read a report where they did say they were being DDOSed but I don‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs something else and they‚Äôre saying the easiest explanation. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt make sense for a single server to be DDOSed, it‚Äôd be a waste of resources. More importantly, it‚Äôs absolutely not a single person, not in your game at least.
---
Caveira's SMG is some of the worst gun in the game, her shotgun isn't better. Her main ability, the interrogation, is what push player off.
---
Probably a bot

Depends on their laptop, dude the newer gaming laptops are pretty good at keeping 100+ fps on 1080p med/high.

Jackal can pinpoint you for about half the match if he decides to use all three scans in you.

Just because the laws of physics allow my to fly my hypothetical airplane, doesn‚Äôt mean I can and should whenever I want and however I want. Sure I can, but there will be consequences . Whether it is from an authoritative body or from the community. 
---
Deluded, maybe. But I am not the one who is damaging the integrity of the siege console community so I can have an advantage over people with a different controlling system. You appeal to Sony‚Äôs authority where as I would rather appeal to what the vast majority of the siege on console community has deemed as acceptable. K&amp;M on console is found to be cheating by Ubisoft AND the vast majority of siege users on console. Period.
---
The game was designed for attackers to have a firepower advantage since defenders have a large information and mad control advantage in both clips you posted you get ash low but since attackers are designed to have better weapons the game is function as designed and thus this doesn‚Äôt warrant a nerf infuriating as it might be.
---
you joined siege in the worst season for a long time

That was the funniest clip I've seen in a while.  Damn.

You don‚Äôt need hundreds of devices to stress a server. You just need to download a client that does that for you. You obviously haven‚Äôt experienced a ddoss attack before

---
There are different budgets for different departments for different teams for different objectives. 
---
More than a million dollars where made by the SI packs before players wanted to increase the prize pool. 
---
The increase of prize pool brings in more viewers to the International game which brings in more players which brings in more money. The prize pool was controlled by the marketing and esports departments not the development team. 
---
Hiring people doesn't magically fix issues, hell irl experience hiring large amount of new people causes more issues and bugs, especially on a project like gaming development on a older engine thats been running for 4+ years.

Also 2M for game like R6 is chump change, they made that purely off packs.[ Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, Ubisoft made$440 million in the year 2018 alone,](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-16-fortnite-tops-2018-superdata-chart-with-usd2-4b-digital-revenue) This is not a money issue.

Every other gun is meme worthy recoil that you could train a chimp to control.

On the thought of that how do you get multiple ops instead of just one or is that even possible?

Some cons with Nomad is both her guns have some pretty wonky recoil. Other than that, she's super good for laying out a path if a teammate has the hostage, perfect for bomb if the defuser is planted, and good if the area is clear and you can just line the doors with traps when your securing.

Mozzie is pretty useful and his gadget isn‚Äôt too bad if you know where to hid drones as an attacker. Just remember to get your pests out ASAP and reposition captured drones ASAP to keep them from being taken out as easily. IMO if you can capture and position 2 drones you can provide round-changing information

I switched to PC, during white noise. (Played on Xbox up to that point.) Best decision I've ever made. The PC community is more friendly, yet more competitive and the game is played at a higher skill level compared to console. It re sparked my interest into the game again and have been playing it religiously as my main MP game ever since. Not to mentions the bonuses of playing on a superior platform - FPS, FOV and M&amp;KB.

Thats exactly what I think no way you shod be able to get tracked twice in a row its annoying

"In a life threatening situation, the average gorilla's heartbeat can be upwards of 176 beats per minute. A jacked Gorilla is able to stay cool, keep calm, their heart rates can be 70 to a 100 beats per minute. But by the time I'm done; that number goes down to zero."

I literally gave you the definition but ok. Ddossing is just a fancy word for server stressing

This game started to suck around the end of Blood Orchid-Para Bellum days. I started playing at the beginning of Velvet Shell, and I just slowly dwindled halfway through Para Bellum. Casual wasn't the same fun dicking around that it was, or it at least wasn't as serious, but as the game continued and the influx of cod players began, it got a lot more toxic (that's not the only reason and it might not even be true, although it was around the time the cod streamers/youtubers began playing siege) it didn't help the game started getting a little finicky

Wow they painted it lmao so cool piece of shit they could of done better I still bought it though lol

I literally just finished building my PC today and on my second match I fail a clutch because I can barely fucking move so the guy in last place really starts laying into me. I say in the chat in accidental all caps LITERALLY FIRST TIME PLAYING KEYBOARD and everyone besides him lays off.
---
By the end he‚Äôs still in last place, I failed 3 clutches but I‚Äôm in second place, and the enemy team is saying GGs and saying how the feel bad this dude is on our team.
---
If that was on console he would have spawned with a C4 the second round and wiped us.
---
This is impossible because everyone would be op in damage however no one would take damage. So its just an endless loop of each other stabbing players with pencils.
---
Can be, are you doing things like shooting friendly drones or destroying friendly equipment?
---
I mean sometimes it‚Äôs random, sometimes it‚Äôs not.
---
I burst at long and it's pretty easy with high sens at short
---
Awesome dude. Literally awesome. But how often did you get wrecked trying this? More than you doing the wrecking?
---
No clash was disabled because she can shoot while her shield is up
---
Buck‚Äôs DMR
---
Sooo gggooooooodddd
---
The worst thing about the internet and modern society in general is people get away with damn near anything and no one does anything about it. And when you fight back, as an example, against bullies, you end up suspended while the people bullying you get away scot free.
---
For another example I mean Spawntaneous says shit and gets shit on, but how many people get harrassed and just laugh it off or dont even speak?
---
Yes. Every ranked mode does it like that
---
Depends. What defenders do you currently have?
---
Whats your sens and dpi?
---
I burst at long and it's pretty easy at short
---
Why can‚Äôt you just let sau upload it themselves they have a reddit account
---
Less common in ranked, though you do get plenty of scummy low lifes in casual, I'd suggest trying to get some friends on so you can play as a stack, at least then even if you haven't got a 5 stack you hold majority and can deal with toxic randoms
---
Ela, Alibi, Mira, Mozzie, Warden, all of the year 1 opa
---
Yeah, but this game is so much more punishing when you lose compared to others
---
I will join. Currently bronze but dropping.
---
Had a Similar experience in rank. Down 0-2, it was 3v5. We won the game 5-3. Just have to outsmart their carrier players and the rest of the team just collapses
---
Strong incentive not to loose then
---
Bandit
---
SIX12 SD or ITA12S would suck too
---
Secure area is favored for defenders so nah
---
nah i wanna lose, straight to copper! Yessir!

Your first instinct here is to INSTANTLY insult me. And you want to tell me something about growing up?
---
I feel like you could remove the entire first floor of new Hereford and the map would still feel the same... it‚Äôs too big. All they really needed to do was add another interior staircase to the map but they gave it a complete overhaul.
---
What are the best hipfire guns? fmg9, p90, ak74? suppresser or no suppressor?
---
It's an LMG. Run it up and its ez pz
---
Its like when people steal amazon packages and when they get glitter bombed they get pissed. Hackers dont want rank, they want other people to be angry. So when they lose they whine and moan like pathetic losers.
---
That looks more like road work...

LOL I thought I was the only one! Level 285 with 740 hours total (683 pve &amp; 57hours pvp). I had someone tell me ingame that they had 1000+ hours and were under lvl 200. The lack of downtime between TH rounds seems to be the reason as mentioned.

Nah, just don't like people that overweight. Gender and skin color dont matter. I dont play fat Male ops either lmao

Will stop happening as much once you gain some experience. A lot of people are anti new players for some reason and others are just pure toxic.

That happens cause they dont have a lobby lock kinda thing like in Overwatch. In OW im pretty sure you cant queue with anyone if they are out of 1000 SR. It happens a lot at like P3-D1, plats and etc queueing with bronze accounts and etc to power the group ‚Äúmmr.‚Äù

That's why you gotta meme on the mic immediately in the lobby. Just say something stupid like "Does anyone else here really enjoy stiff cock?" and they'll accept you as a fellow meme lord.

---
Copper. Copper is now redder.
---
They offer zero tactical advantage because hip fire first shot never hits anywhere near the damn dot... who sights them in before a sortie? Fucking Ray Charles??
---
Lion paring is commonly Dokki, Jackal and other fragging operators like ash. 
---
Dokki: Lion makes people not move without getting tagged, Dokki gives away location of the players. Combined you get roamers that have a ringing phone and cant even get away to turn it off. 
---
Jakcal: Similar thing, Ping gives away location and lion keeps them there.
---
Or if your roam hunting, corner your roaming into a room, drone and lion so they cant run away while your fragger is peeking in for the kill
---
That will do it. Cause the fire doesnt just take the photo it clicks then you have to stay still for a few seconds  before moving.

Deadass thought this was Sergio with a beard for a sec

I feel like Ubi are moving on to Y2 ops to get their Elites. They had 4 in Y1 (Blackbeard,Hibana,Frost and Valkyrie) being 2 attacking ops and 2 defending ops. So if i can do basic math, Lesion being the first Y2 defending op there should be one more along side 2 attacking ops. My guess for the next elites maybe Ela/Vigil and Ying or Zofia maybe? Just a thought
---
Thing is, you can't really strategize against Cav when you can't trust. People are unwilling to rely on randoms. They don't want randoms to ruin their game, and it makes sense why.

I wish they would add buttons on the bottom of the Xbox or PS4 controllers near where your middle/ring fingers sit (depending if you hold it claw or regular). It would be perfect for FPS games that let your lean plus it would be a fairly comfortable place for the buttons to be and still let you use your other fingers like u usually do

Well that‚Äôs what I get for cropping a post from insta

Except they have set a president for 4 YEARS of DLC ops having new weapons.

And of the original ops, that's true but they mostly had at least 1 unique weapon to them.

Yeah, I currently have it for the p9, the FMG-9, the CAMRS, and the F2 but I really want it for the mp7, mp5, and IQ's AUG right now.

Is this determined off my highest rank that season or the rank it ended on?

get this dipshit out of my r6

So many people have good recoil control I keep dying to people or see people get kills with no recoil but I get a recoil but I can control it ok

Lol did the vigil rage quit?

its a common understang... i feel it too, why would we want to decrease the damage,, personally, it just for more stealthiness tbh... theres just something wrong flanking with nokk with loud gunfire...

Because it's c a s u a l ?
---
why? because they want to be copper.
---
just find a squad of players that are decent and you'll get out of copper
---
I don't understand. So is it a service these idiots pay for or is it magically becoming mainstream? It's happening all the time now
---
I would be super disappointed because I've never played Glaz very well and he recently got a fat nerf.
---
Cool, but when used they turn invisible anyway, so what's the point?
---
I agree with you üíØ the paint effect goes well and if choose the silencer it really looks sweet. (Don‚Äôt recommend the silencer) for obvious reasons
---
Yeah I‚Äôve played Glaz only a couple times, got final kill once but not much more, but I‚Äôd have to be somewhat happy since it‚Äôd be my first black ice
---
My question is how do people have time for this regardless this looks amazing good job. How long did it take?
---
I have the same problem but I‚Äôm NEU
---
I mean sure, they also had a precedent of releasing a new map every season, until they didn't.
---
Ultimately you don't have to play the new operators, personally, having bought last year's, I see no value in it, just save the renown. I only play like 1-2 nights a week to do all the weekly challenges, gets me plenty of renown to buy new ops as they are released
---
The Most Ambitious Crossover Event In History
---
The fact that it turns invisible gave them creative liberties to make it literally any colour without fear of the player base losing their minds about balancing issues.
---
So they just decided to dip it in some nesquik milkshake powder and call it a day.
---
Yeah man I‚Äôve been playing for 2 years and starting new in year 4 is harder then starting in year 2 like I did. What platform do you play on maybe we can play and I can try to help make it better.

I truly don‚Äôt understand ddosing to win in rainbow. MnK I guess makes you feel like hot shit when you play, but it‚Äôs still cheating.

---
aight bro
---
No one is just do your best and show them up I believe in you
---
His question is that you needed to get to lvl20 or lvl30now to unlock rank. You not only did this but also played 10 rank games within 3hs of ingame time which is next to impossible
---
And it will be that's why siege gave us the magical mute button to make them more silent that a mute main that just got countered by a twitch

Lord chanka I pray to you in request of a acogs on all ops and acogs on top of those thank you and amen
---
Nice one man. Here's a tip for a new player though. The longer barrel isn't very useful in siege as most fights take place in close to mid range. I recommend switching it out for a flash hider because it'll reduce the recoil or even a suppressor if you want to be sneaky
---
Well I hate how so many people think IQ is in a good place despite only being good at taking out Echo‚Äôs drones and then becoming completely useless after that and making you think you should have just brought Thatcher or twitch instead.  (Give IQ smokes).
---
Also saying you had bad teammates is not really an argument considering nearly any operator needs to be exceptional with team play, the ones that don‚Äôt are usually called to powerful and later nerfed, Ash,Lion,Lesion and Dokkeabi was one of them before all of her significant nerfs.
---
A leak of a grapple hook op for next season was released if that's of any use
---
Ive also tried it makes it worse.
---
yeah early game seige people used to invite someone from the other team into a party and get the IP off that, common advise was to not accept party invites mid game.
---
Since couple of seasons ago, they started just taking down the servers rather than wasting time sending party invites.
---
Yep we teamkilled the fifth so he left

Dont forget Blitz, Jackal and Cav

But the thing is, my loss of mmr never changed.

He has a shield. It just looks like he doesn't. He's the new elite skin üòâüòâ
---
I didnt say bad team mates I said ones that dont listen because we have all come across those  and there are tones of ops that need to be buffed and nerfed it's just my opinion that dokki isnt in the best place while her gadget is good her guns could use work she needs another option is what I'm saying
---
Thank u. I have more art too. Not sure if I should post or not
---
Indeed
---
Thank chanka for all of the talented people in the world that can replicate the beauty of all the ops that we care for so much amen
---
Best 7 minutes and 3 seconds spent

Rlly? That would be hella cool if some one used it as pfp. Also thnx
---
I can‚Äôt remember, but I believe it would be your current rank at the end of the season.

Never had this problem myself, but I agree. Ubi really needs to do something about the toxicity in their games.

Ight gotcha

Man that sucks

addendum is linked in there
---
All sites are personal preference. Same as barrels but only amongst flash, muzzle and compensater. Heavy barrel and suppressor are literally pointless
---
Again contextual. If he legitimately dying because he thinks his TM has an angle only for that TM to wander off for a kill is it his fault?
---
Sometimes people have bad games because their TMs let then down while the silver gets a lucky break.

Hi, hope I can help. I pretty much exclusively main roamers on defense because I‚Äôm trash at defending objective. I just play to my strengths and it usually works. Here‚Äôs some tips I hope can help you with roaming. 
---
-I try to lurk around common points of entry. Attackers are more comfortable entering in ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù places, so they‚Äôre less likely to come through a random window or barricade. You can lurk around those areas and try to catch them entering, which leads me to my next point.
---
-Don‚Äôt feel the need to contest them immediately. Attackers often run in groups, and so you want to wait a bit to see if they‚Äôve got a buddy. If you just jump out the second they enter their backup may get you. Wait a bit, make them think it‚Äôs safe, and then take them out. They‚Äôre expecting an attack from every room when the enter, not 30 seconds after they‚Äôve breached and they‚Äôre on their way to the objective. 
---
-Pick faster ops. It‚Äôs for a few reasons. Faster ops can peek angles quicker, and generally have weapons better suited to hunting lone ops or pairs: fast fire rate SMGs. Someone like Maestro may not be the best roamer, because while his LMG is powerful and has lots of ammo, the slower fire rate and his slow speed are not suited for roaming as much. Furthermore, heavily armored ops maps more noise. They just do. To be as silent as a one speed you‚Äôll have to move much slower, and that can cost you a lot as a lurker, which brings me to the most major point I can make. 
---
-Know when and how to rotate in/around the objective. As a roamer, it‚Äôs your job to take care of business inside the building. It‚Äôs your job to hunt down very specific operators on the enemy team, like Fuze, who will try to gain access to the floor above. The ultimate prize in my opinion is flanking shield operators, who can give your team a lot of trouble. But you have to know how to get places fast. If your team pings someone in Gargoyle on Theme Park, and you‚Äôre in Train Room, you need to know the fastest, safest ways to get there. Get familiar with the map, know how to use hatches to close distance fast, and always leave yourself a way to escape. Getting trapped in a room without safe exits will kill you as a roamer. Remember, putting a few bullets worth of damage on an enemy and getting away with it is worth more than trying to go for a hard kill and losing the fight. Trust me, 90% of the time they won‚Äôt chase you. 
---
-If your team is getting demolished, *get back to objective.* You might not be the best defense, but you *are* a defense, and you can‚Äôt leave Rook defending against 3 attackers while you play peekaboo with Maverick. Forget him, and go support your team if you start losing the advantage. This is a rule for defense in general but remember this: you win if they can‚Äôt complete the mission objective. You don‚Äôt need go headhunt them, let them come to you. So get in there. 
---
Here‚Äôs just an assortment of other random tidbits I can think of: 
---
-Roamers are suited for ‚Äúlate round run outs.‚Äù You‚Äôre not gonna run out with Alibi right when the round starts, but halfway through the round, especially on maps like Skyscraper, a cheeky balcony runout is a roamer‚Äôs best friend. 
---
-The best ops I‚Äôve found for roaming are Lesion (oh my gosh, yes Lesion is the best), Jager, Kapkan, Pulse, Caveira, Vigil, Frost, Bandit, and Ela, if it‚Äôs worth anything. Like I mentioned, Lesion is ridiculous, and is probably the strongest overall operator *in the game* in my opinion, just because of his versatility. His gadget is near invisible, deals damage, and gives away enemy positions. Not to mention his laser SMG, which deals insane damage for its rate of fire and stability. My strat with him is this: don‚Äôt worry about getting every doorway. You don‚Äôt need to spread your Gu mines out that much. Instead, aim for awkward high traffic areas. Aim for hallways, especially the convergence of lots of rooms (i.e someplace where anyone walking in a hallway or one or more rooms would have to step to advance.). That ensures you‚Äôll not only likely get them with it, but it‚Äôll be the worst possible spot. They will probably check doorways and whatnot. They never, ever check the spots dead center of a hallway where the nearest room is 4 steps behind them and there‚Äôs long sightlines to either side. That‚Äôs the spot you want you Gu because it puts a ton of pressure on the enemy to either engage with a disadvantage or flee and lose both the element of surprise and time. 
---
-If you think you can engage close enough a shotgun is, in my opinion, always the better option for roaming. With someone like Bandit, if I come across a pair of enemies I know I can shoot twice and then I‚Äôm good. You don‚Äôt have to kill them first shot if you know nobody is coming to save them. An injure is as good as a death for that pair if their friends can‚Äôt defend them. Then finish them off.  Also don‚Äôt sleep on Pulse‚Äôs shotgun. That thing absolutely rips. 
---
-I mentioned Kapkan, Pulse and Bandit before. Having a C4 as a roamer is a godly advantage. If you aren‚Äôt sure how many there are and they‚Äôre putting a little pressure on you, that C4 will take care of all your worries. 
---
-With Frost I have had far more success placing my welcome mats down in unexpected places. I try to not set any down until I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not seen, then roam out into the map and put them where they won‚Äôt be suspected, ever. I‚Äôve caught many more people that way. And don‚Äôt feel the need to rush to the downed person either. If you suspect you can‚Äôt make it to the mat in time before they get the revive, don‚Äôt go. You‚Äôve already landed a huge victory. Without any effort you massively disadvantaged the enemy team in 3 ways: one op has much less health. They had to waste time reviving someone, especially if they needed to rotate around to save them. And now they will push much slower to the objective, checking tedious spots so they won‚Äôt get caught. 
---
-If you roam with Alibi or Ela, save a gadget just in case. If you get caught in a bad spot, you can run and use your gadget to cover your back. With Alibi, your disadvantage becomes easy counterintelligence. With Ela, you will stop an enemy advance, and if you‚Äôre lucky you can launch an immediate counterattack on them. 
---
-There are certain ops that will make your life hell, or at least very hard. Jackal will get you killed very easily. Your best bet is to run to near objective and just rotate around the room. It‚Äôs best if you can get a buddy to come and cover the room with you. It‚Äôll suck, but if you‚Äôre lucky he will keep tracking you. Every one he wastes on you is one he can‚Äôt spend tracking anyone else. Certain operators are ridiculously quiet, like weirdly so. I‚Äôve noticed Maverick, Hibana, Twitch, and IQ are stupid quiet, even compared to other comparable ops like Ash. It‚Äôs weird. And especially with the new update watch out for N√∏kk. She will eat your lunch if you‚Äôre not careful. Had a match today where I was lurking in a really strange spot, absolutely positive I wasn‚Äôt seen and making no noise at all, just holding an angle. Sp√∏√∏ky comes around the corner, prefiring my exact angle. Luckily the computer monitor to my left took the bullets for me and I got her, but I had no clue she was coming. She is dead silent and she can mess you up if you think you counted right. She‚Äôs a wildcard that makes it dangerous now. 
---
That‚Äôs about all I have for you. It‚Äôs not much, and I‚Äôd never say I‚Äôm an expert, but I do like to think I‚Äôm good at roaming and lurking, and I have been very successful with it overall. Good luck!
---
Cool. And instead of spending your life living to the fullest you would rather spend it being angry and spiteful to others.

Photoshop. I make reinforce and mirror in game then find good Angel and record video and switch my weapon. In video I screen shot empty hand between switch and remove middle. Put photo in back and then rewrite text

But running with shield up tho
---
I love not having to deal with Blitz and Monty shenanigans, but I wanna play Echo outside casual
---
on your r6tracker page it says you maintained the same kd as your previous season.... how is that possible
---
Just headshot
---
hm that would be annoying, that would mean if I want to have an easier time getting to my rank i now need to have a 2nd account, so I can play with some of my friends
---
And when it does, it hits a teammate.

Why IQ icon is not the same as that in operators menu?
---
As a n√∏kk main I reccomend doing whatever the F you want because both of her weapons are amazing. 
---
But if you're not using a suppressor on her weapons get out. ^/s
---

No

But there is no IQ, that‚Äôs N√∏kk and Zofia! /s

It really sucks especially since it instantly kills you (withstand leaves you with 5 hp which instantly goes away with literally any type of weapon or gadget)

---

---
I know, I'm just referencing how I died, but him peaking should be better than any other operator because he has the shield but it isnt
---
This is by far the best thing I saw/experienced this week fr
---
That's not the only thing he needs sorted out
---
Your shield gets seen first, so it gets shot first, so by the time you can shoot back it's broken. Peeking*

Agreed. This is because of how intertwined the operators in siege are. The ‚Äúoperators‚Äù in BO4 are fairly basic and offer no way to change the map in any truly significant and permanent way. As well as every person in cod being able to use any weapon they please on any player. The weapons in siege are given to different operators for specific reasons

They test out or you could say warm up their booter on casual matches to make sure its still working first in casual matches. It's the worst its ever been this season. Im eu xbox and its literally unplayable
---
Mystery crest! OooOoOooOoo
---
I guess I more or less expect them in ranked, since that‚Äôs where you go to learn from stuff like that. Casual however, it is the most tryhard thing to do in an environment where most people go to play some relaxing matches
---
In the past everybody had 2500 elo after rank reset. Now it's average between 2500 and your max elo from last season. Minimum elo you can get is 1500 and maximum is 3500.
---
MPX is a peashooter, noone uses shotguns, face it. The deagel is good i grand you that

how do i use it

I wouldn't be so sure if he did actually, but after he tried to rush in and kill me, I killed him instead, at that time, I'm positive he burnt his house too.
---
Did you feel the bloodrush in your head? Lol

I solo queued in casual with a 4 stack and they did the same exact thing. They invited me to a party and starting screaming at me "WHY ARE YOU SO BAD KID" and kicked me from the game and party. Xbox is a sad, toxic place.

Do people actually ban according to if they‚Äôre attacking or defending first? I usually see teams that are defending first banning echo which I don‚Äôt see the point in
---
One of us! One of us!
---
I think it might just be on your end, I can view it fine even on mobile
---
Remain the same.
---
Thats even worse in some cases
---
It's surprising that Castle's icon was not a castle, but I find it more odd that his icon was a valknut, or "Odin knot". Sledge's excuse for the Thor's hammer is that he has a hammer, but Castle has no reason to use a Wotan's knot.
---
Plus people are banning him because of the ability to make attackers drunk in a safe location
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Why don‚Äôt you start banning strategically then? It doesn‚Äôt take that much game knowledge
---
It is more satisfying when you bought all of them with renown
---
Every single shooter game should have a firing range. Be it Call of Duty, Halo or whatever. I just wanna shoot some wooden targets in peace. Is it too much to ask?
---
OT but it‚Äôs just echo extending it indefinitely
---
It will work üíØ guaranteed!

I'm surprised the sledge let you do that.

---
Spotted the 9 ping tryhard.
---
Means she cant just spam her gadget and rush without putting her self at risk. The current change puts her at risk when she uses her gadget (if she wants them to detonate quickly).
---
Sometimes if u really do need to plant the echo effect can get rinsed off by just trying to plant twice
---
However the three seconds adds more time for the defenders to kill the planter
---
Yes the 3 seconds is strong yet not in all scenarios

Exactly my same need. Sometimes I don‚Äôt want to play the game with the stress of suicide bombers just to test my weapons! A firing range and model ‚Äòkilling house like‚Äô building like Hereford base would be great to mess about in and test things out.
---
Click on my profile, and view my comment about Dokkaebi
---
Ash rush and the drop shot on alibi , absolutely disgusting. This ain‚Äôt it chief
---
Sounds like a great idea!
---
They should remain as they are now, the whole point of the change was to reduce the ability to quickly spam a room with flashbangs.
---
In the right circumstances the ability to fully blind a room at the press of a button was deemed way too powerful, and made Ying still an exceedingly powerful operator on bomb, as you could flash-plant pretty effectively still.
---
Current system allows you to still be effective but with some more thought and preparation, also letting defenders counter it somewhat by either pushing when the cooking happens or simply shooting the rolling Candela.
---
Kinda hard for ME to explain, but from main page it‚Äôs 3 dots in the top right. And Flair I think

It‚Äôs already suggested but I‚Äôd say Jackal would be a good pair up.

Luckily I recorded it but where do I find the ubi support

Yes, i have people just being idiots and yelling in the mic. Switching to casual.
---
Oh I do agree with you but even a low info call, like ‚ÄúI hear 2 rappelling north‚Äù or ‚Äúon my body‚Äù is better than nothing at all. That could make or break a fellow roamers game/positions.
---
They post more than gameplay. This is 95% gameplay.
---
e.e
---
i bought the starter edition of siege a long time ago and never upgrades so unlocking ops has been a grind for me
---
also when i did put money into the game, i bought 4 elites and only regretted it after realising i could have bought the year 4 pass
---
This is actually really fucking neat and I am going to steal this
---
Yea, kinda hard since most my friends aren't into the game and i have sh@tty work hours.
---
gridlock
---
People should communicate more in that case, or even just put a little bit of thought into the map and strats used on it. For example if you‚Äôre attacking first on Oregon, ban Mira for the laundry room strat. If people started banning according to situations then I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd like it a lot more.
---
Shotguns??? Or would that ruin it

noicr indeed

Yeah copper is just filled with dickheads. The majority of them know how to shoot and aim but that‚Äôs it. They know 0 strategies and when they chat shit it makes me wanna hit my head of my table.

Scary woman
---
Duly noted.
---
If they do this, they should remove the chance to get alpha pack when winning, because it is redundant. And expect people to AFK spinning on casuals. They'll just do those shit to get exp and get alpha pack
---
I feel like I‚Äôm aiming too high with the reflex, I like to have that circle and dot reticle. The housing of the sight instant really a problem since I should be holding my sights in the right spot initially.  I adjust my positioning when possible to avoid being exposed to angles I can‚Äôt see.

If your on say Gym Window on Clubhouse and your TM is on Construction/CCTV and he ignores an enemy aubibly running to CCTV who is window peaking and kills you then it's Con/CCTVs fualt for not calling it out/covering the window he should be able to hear.
---
Top fragger doesn't mean they are playing well either, just means they are getting kills.
---
That's the trade off though. Get an angle on a window in exchange for being vulnerable. This would make it to safe.
---
You can, although it is increadably rare you will find somone "hacking" on console it is possible.
---
No problem I just appreciate you replied at all. 
---
As someone who only plays in a two stack, I'm sometimes able to get a unique ban, but even if my team doesn't ban Echo, the other will. It feels like 9/10 games ban him. I'm a high gold low plat player.
---
I think a lot of the player base suffers from this because most play with randoms. Obviously you guys have the data so you know more than our personal experiences, but I think a lot of us would appreciate it if we got an update in a dev blog in a few weeks what the data says (Personally I love infographics).
---
You can see by the replies to this comment how many people feel what could be changed, some of the more popular ideas being Jackal getting a nerf regarding how long the footsteps stay on the ground, or personally I would like the other two game modes back as to allow a varied ban phase. A favorite change of mine was to change blitz melee to a sort of knockdown like Nomads gadget, encouraging you to ADS and uncover yourself to secure a kill.
---
Anyway thanks for responding, and I hope the discussion that spawned from this post gives you guys an idea on how the community is reacting yo the change, and you are able to work with the feedback and data gathered to make the system a more enjoyable experience for everyone.
---
*******N O*******
---
Ok I have to say this so you can understand. I(myself) used an outbreak skin (not the rusty trigger) but am skin just for thermite and did the glitch to transfer it onto the shotgun. The thermite skin is not the rusty trigger but is the skin with blood on the gun‚Äôs barrel. Then when I did this it game me this skin on the shotgun. This skin is not able to access unless you do this glitch and I have the rusty trigger, it isn‚Äôt this skin
---
Either she was lagging, you were lagging or you were still technically on hipfire and got lucky
---
lol so many of my friends feel the same way about it haha. i love it because i could care less about the line, gotta admit though that hpa does have superior performance though. i do love myself a gbb gun though, i want a gbb saw that i could hook up to an hpa line and get awesome recoil.

One of the unique skins for the gun.

Well the change was to have a quick way to know who was controlling the feed, yellow for attackers, blue for defenders and white for deception (Vigil/Nokk).
---
But as to why it went from red to yellow instead, well I don't really know either, maybe because red was deemed too visible in contrast to blue, or for colorblind reasons.
---
She was OP so they nerfed her. Even if she does have a peashooter. 41 bullets will sure as shit kill someone. Recoil can also help get headshots if you're bad like me
---
why do i even bother aiming XD
---
Makes sense. Thank you young man.
---
Yes, why

Same here

^(put it back on)

Only problem with hpa gbb is transitioning lines.

But if I go on the gun customization I can't find it. I can't buy it and I don't have it

If you buy a eight controller you can bind any button and then the paddles in the back it‚Äôs worth the money in my opinion

Yeah that looks a lil bit sus
---
I have no idea, this is one of the most pointless changes they've made, if they were trying to simplify the colours they fucked up and made it more complicated because defenders are orange and attackers are blue yet they swap the colours around (except use yellow instead of orange)
---
PC - Yes
---
That's adding nothing to the conversation
---
Because of Mozzie I think. If Mozzie catch an atacker drone, drone light turns to a color like blue, I do not remember.
---
Neither can I... just be down
---
Yes- Xbox1
---
PC? Yes
---
We need this skin too
---
same here on pc
---
You are not the only one
---
yeah that is an issue that i hate. I would imagine though that a gbb lmg would use some kind of internal tank like shotguns do and i could direct line into the gas cylinder or tap the tank. or you could just use propane lol
---
thanks
---
Yeah
---
yeah pc  riperuni
---
Thanks so much! :)

I can‚Äôt connect either. Anyone know why or how long?

Yea same dam bro

Servers down on PC in Ireland with the error cod:  3-0X0001000B

If you don't get the joke, then you're probably a noob..

But that's alright üëå

How long does it usually take for them to reset or what ever there doing lol
---
Nah, down on PS4 and Xbox One
---
I just got kicked out.
---
Well I sorted by new to see if anyone else is having issues and the first 3 posts are about servers so they're definitely down
---
That's so dumb, I would feel sorry for you, but cav gets banned every single time.

Hello CharlemagnesJoy, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c2wr7d/servers_down_on_pc_in_ireland_with_the_error_code/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Figures, they stopped working right after my first match. I only have a few hours till work
---
Sorry but I was looking at the new post and didn't see any saying something about it so I thought it was a glitch or just my internet cause I stopped playing rainbow for a while cause it kept saying server unreachable for a couple weeks and realized I had to buy it on download to fix it
---
I think all ubi servers are down because ghost recon wildlands is Down also

If only I could ever play him...

And Mavericks is a horse because that‚Äôs his nickname, the horse also has flames coming off it which symbolises his gadget, Alibis is an octopus which I‚Äôm assuming is because an octopus has a wide reach which many arms like alibis traps can be spread over a distance to catch her prey

For people not knowing what's going on:
---
This time ubisoft releases birthday skins for operators instead of charms.
---
Sounds good,right? But the issue is that those skins are either for 1) guns no one uses or 2) guns that end up as copy and paste.
---
Sledge also had a birthday challenge for a B-Day gun skin for the EXCACT same weapon as Thatcher right now: The shotgun.
---
This honestly makes us wonder now if they will do the same with mute and smoke too. Adding the same gun skin but with a different icon on the excact same gun.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Yep, i‚Äôam stupid
---
Don‚Äôt get the black ice fever  in the community but cheers on your exams, man!
---
r/Blackmagicfuckery
---
oh yeah,totally forgot that one.
---
Hopefully mutes will be the mp one and not also shotgun.
---
Shame they didn't go for thatcher with his ar.
---
Down here and copper it‚Äôs usually jackal, cav, and lesion
---
Those people exist but there are only a few who will still play their way up to diamond eventually
---
I actually checked and hes correct its not the same video
---
\*\*DRUGS\*\*
---
Yeah I agree tbh although I don‚Äôt use those skins I have black ice on those guns
---
Hes not lying different vid
---
Yea i am very confused by this post
---
Mh... *LET'S MAKE A 200HP DAMAGE FIST!*
---
The smg12 goes up then right then hard left if you go into t hunt and just say and watch the gun while spraying just pull down not left or right and watch for a pattern and while playing try to peek with players to the right of the sight I play lots of Warden and dokk
---
You're cruel buddy! :(
---
I think they should add native support.
---
Old glitch....used to only happen with one, so they fixed it, now it happens with 4. Good job ubisoft.
---
I use the sledge shotgun skin,I'd use thatcher skin on thatchers shotgun but considering thatcher has no smg 11,the shotgun will barely or never be touched.
---
Idk I don‚Äôt think it works that way but I‚Äôll make mine primary because I‚Äôve done some share playing over the years
---
Thanks!
---
These were so bad xD
---
But isn't Kaid from Africa tho?
---
That‚Äôs the point.  Bruh have you heard of an analogy before? üòÇüòÇüòÇ has our education system failed again?
---
I get that but it‚Äôs the fact that like I could enjoy the game with out having to worry about making up $60 or monthly fees to keep playing a game a greatly enjoy
---
First of all, thank you so much for your response! I‚Äôd have to agree with you on almost all your points, but instead of lurking around common entry points, i usually try to lurk more around places that are strong areas for the attackers to get ahold of (such as penthouse if my team is defending hookah on coastline)
---
I don‚Äôt touch shotguns on attack really I normally get hecked because of it
---
Ash is already fast, but imagine tachanka, fucking zooming around at Mach 4 and punching the shit out of people.

I just want to have a good time.

Shoutout to the idiot on the enemy team who killed us IMMEDIATELY. You have no sense of humor and you‚Äôre also probably 12.

Can I copy your homework ?

Restart siege and the pack should appear

I had this issue, all you have to do is restart the game for the alpha pack to show up.

Ty, i'll try that

Just year 4
---
I‚Äôm trying to figure out what kind of plate carrier she‚Äôs wearing in the game. Looks like a Crye JPC but can carry soft armor inserts as well
---
You will only get the year 4 ops. 
---
N√∏kk, Warden, Gridlock, Mossie so far. I belive you need to unlock the rest
---
Nice costume
---
whats the appeal for 4:3? Is it a gameplay thing or a visual thing
---
Yeah why doesn‚Äôt Thatcher get the skin for his AR?
---
Ok so her health and speed is why she us a good roamer she can avoid getting shot so she sustains more health and she got damage nerfed because of the fire rate of her weapon she is so easy to hit headshots with regardless of recoil and yes it is random when you hip fire when you ads it is so easy to just predict and with a 40 round mag you dont need to aim for the head then blam dead in 2 seconds and you dont have to place the gadget immediately place down 2 then save 1 for the final push use it where they are coming from then you'll concus an entire group for multiple easy kills it's that simple she is over all an amazing and I'd say very good anchor and roamershe has the speed to roam and the gear to anchor it's that simple her guns can multi task any situation you are in with a pistol that is easy to aim with a high fire rate SMG with and extended mad and a shotty that is better than any other she is an amazing anchor I have shown more than enough evidence to prove as well
---
You will only get the ops from year 4 so mozzie gridlock warden and nook + the next ops that come out during year 4
---
Ayyyyy finally
---
What platform you on?
---
Go to the area where you buy a separate content pack, back out, and it should be unlocked.
---
Oh, I‚Äôve seen a guide that said you could do it in both modes, guess that wasn‚Äôt updated yet.
---
I have the game since launch and I like trophies but I never even hesitated on trying to get them
---
TH isn‚Äôt THAT good
---
Yes, in his operator bio it says he was born in Morocco
---
It may not work for you, but it did for me
---
My ears are bleeding
---
ye but he white
---
Kaid is Moroccan.
---
Blitz, jackal, echo and caveira get banned most of the time in the new ranked pick and ban
---
Thats on Sony, not on Ubisoft.
---
What do you mean over night? It was the same way when they introduced pick and ban for that event

I started playing siege about 4 days ago and I've had this happen to me the first time today

At the end of u can see it

TACHANKA BEST BOI
---
No one ever banned him in road of si no one ever complained about him for months on it phantom sight rolls around and over night everyone starts hating him and you know I can‚Äôt remember the last time when a jackal actually got me killed it doesn‚Äôt even happen that often. And even then the event no one banned jackal nearly as much as ranked right now
---
Puerto Rico would be a cool one to see
---
Lesion Elite has me emotional.
---
If they were to change it to 2 round rotation their isn‚Äôt an opportunity for both teams to play the same amount of defense and attack, so if you‚Äôre on a defensive sided map the team that plays defense more would most likely win.
---
Well yeah, and you do see that on teams that play with strategies in mind, Pro League tends to have that 2-3 at most ratio.
---
However unless you plan to make it like frags which are currently only on 3 ops, you will always have the option to have a 5 claymore attack team, and to be honest I'd rather it remained a choice instead of a limitation.

Big fucking hole coming right up.
---
Who doesn't have a subconscious crush on Thermite?
---
I too like sharing my passwords and lock combinations with the general public.
---
That's why I think they need to add another gadget. The dev's put clamores and breaching charges on ops that they don't want to have frags or smokes and it means to many clamores
---
does this mean thermite has a subconcious crush on himself?
---
‚ô™bruh sound effect 5‚ô™
---
But here‚Äôs the thing. Those guys can move and shoot. This new op, just like Groovatron99 said so wisely, can stand so incredibly still it becomes invisible to the naked eye
---
caveira is banned along with jackal for the same reason, ' they are annoying to play against ' :) . 
---
i usually vote to ban these two for the reason that i play in soloQ so i do not want my game ruined because someone enter the building without droning and get downed and interrogate by caveira.
---
Why would paper show up in glaz's scope

Ah for some reason I had a memory that they first made it 4 and changed to 3 after.

I didnt even know this guy tho, and started screaming in SpanishüòÇ

Ahh that makes sense. we call the starting characters base game characters, and Y1 is Buck, Frost, BB, Valk, Capito, Cav, Hibana, and Echo

Fully on board with a new attack gadget, hopefully we do see something in the near future.

Lol right? He better hope nobody recognizes this

Hell no.

Whats that song? Can‚Äôt see it due to low res phone.
---
it would be nice but certain defenders should have them. i mean anchoring would be a lot harder without acog to hold los. i main echo and i can‚Äôt imagine me using him without acog. it‚Äôs an advantage we can hold against a rushing defender to pick off their heads, but i‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd adjust. and sorry for english im russian.

I mean, this is simply incorrect. Communism is viewed as a philosophical, social, political, and economic ideology. Communism, specifically in China, is a political party as well.
---
Ok then
---
I'm not anymore, never bothered changing it
---
You can change any kkeybinfd in the game.
---
2-2-1-1 for the first 6 rounds, then 1-1-1 in OT like it is now. Then you guarantee each team attacks/defends twice, instead of potentially only once. 
---
IMO, momentum/morale is absolutely a huge factor in this game. If you defend first on a defensive map and go up 3-0 because of it, you‚Äôre likely to have an easier time stealing one attack round then the opposing team counter 3-0‚Äôing you.
---
Those were games that were out before 2013 when they stopped allowing  it
---
Squad and WWZ did it and both are less than 2 years old
---
Of course it is. I kind of wish that sharing how to do the glitch would end with a permaban
---
Wow congrats
---
Yeah in options just bind it to one of your side buttons on the mouse
---
so china developed the superstitions that siege is censoring because of communism? i highly doubt that.

Probably just a 12 year old "troll" who thinks he's bein funny.
---
&gt; I'm not saying to change the ranking system... I'm saying to stop using rank to matchmake people
---
Sorry for the confusion.
---
&gt; And by performance I mean k/d, points, and gadget contribution to the team.
---
This doesn't in any way take into account how good a player is at using utility, it doesn't take into account how good a player is at communicating or how to work with teammates. So much of the skillset in Siege is unquantifiable by stats alone. It's not going to in any way, shape or form make a more accurate matchmaking than the one we have now.
---
Take it from someone who plays a whole lot of Siege solo and with friends, the matchmaking system isn't an issue. Shithead teammates are not the reason why people are low in ranks. It's just convenient to blame others. They can wreck matches and they make the playing experience lousy, but on average they don't effect your rank as a solo player. Playing with friends is fun and rewarding in terms of building chemistry (and a non-toxic environment), but if you are not completely dead weight to your team then you really won't get that much higher of a rank. And if you are dead weight I can assure you that you're not going to have much fun.
---
I agree but also I‚Äôve had games where we kinda get cocky bc it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre up 3-0 and we‚Äôre more risky, but our morale is higher for sure
---
Yeah I'll try clip it when it happens
---
I like how clash is on the attacking side
---
well i was a female recruit, i think it was a form of house, but then once inside through a window the place was quite desolate, i saw thermite and idk what exactly happened but ik we did it and then i want into a room down the hallway from the first room i was in, thermite wrote on the door smthn like "me (thermite) and [my name] concieved but dont tell her because she will get really mad" and everyone began to ask if me and thermite did *it* and i was very embarrassed and ofc upset that thermite did that. but after that the dream became very disorienting and the house transformed into a form of a desert with big hills and debris and i was very confused. after trying (and failing) to take a shower in where the first room i entered was supposed to be, i woke up

üåöüåöüåöüåöüåöüåöüåö
---
Basic observation is his counter, Mavericks who only use him to make kill holes give Maverick a bad name, any decent anchor will just shoot him in the face, I do it constantly and rarely die to him, and I‚Äôm decent at best, it‚Äôs hilarious, I just facepalm every time. He‚Äôs great for stopping bandit tricking and such, but used purely as a fragger (as I see him used 9/10 times) he‚Äôs below average and only good against bad players. I get people screaming OP in the first week he was out, but now he‚Äôs basically a free kill.
---
Yes and I am ashamed

I still love her... just gotta squint my eyes a little... that‚Äôs all

What‚Äôs next, drones get removed

Because it's too real, man. It also doubles as meta-commentary on SAU, as well.
---
I never said that. Developed those superstitions because of Communism? No, like I already stated, that is deep within their history/culture. Never said that was specifically due to communism.   
---
The continued mass censorship? Yes, THAT can be attributed to their political and philosophical ideology, AKA communism.   
---
Keep digging my friend.

WHAT TUYOU FUCK DID YOU BRING UPPON THIS CURSID LAND
---
You've shown only your own opinions and not stats or facts. Adsing with the scorpion still results in the random horizontal recoil no matter what. She has anchor gadgets yes, and a roamets gun. Since the scorpion is shit at anything past 2m. But those togetherdon't mix well. Until you actually provide actual stats and evidence that isn't just your opinion your argument has nothing to go off of.
---
I thought the sub rules said no witch hunts...
---
you have a 0.88 k/d in ranked this season so your idea of being top fragger and still losing doesn't check out
---
on defending you seem to play a lot of ops that are supposed to get top kills but yet you have poor k/d on them meaning you are taking the roll of a fragger and then failing at it. I suggest just anchoring and playing slower until you up your gun play and skill. Though your win rate is ok it's not that significant for a typical defender as defending is easier.
---
Seems on offense u play a lot of blitz and blackbeard. might be bad time for you to be maining those two haha. however your win rate seems to spike on hard breachers and heavy utility like thatcher.
---
Overall by your stats it seems you really try to focus on heavy fraggers but unfortunately your stats show you dont ahve the skill or playstyle to pull this off and that's why you're losing very often. Might need to play to your strengths and tone back your play a lot. play more ultility and supportive characters, anchor more too. seems you have better stats in those roles
---
But thats only cause she isnt very offensive but her electroahock needs to have less range, realistically it should be like a taser gun instead of an electronic laser sci-fi bs and should shoot a line into the enemy to shock them
---
The horse's mane has flames on it, which relates to him having a blow torch.

I played the game for a year. It died

Doesn't mean it's not pay to win
---
like never, makes me sad
---
They took what was a fairly attractive lady into someone that looks like she smokes 30 packs a day. Just my opinion. Look at the launch player card/model.
---
Is this a witch hunt tho? My man is invisible sledging people hahahahaha
---
No its Valkyries shotgun. The SPAS-12
---
I bought that the day it came out, my favourite elite by far, thanks for the suggestion though

At the basis it's a reward for playing their games and it just doesn't hold up to the other uses of your coins.

Games use little to none of the GPU while tabbed out, unless it's in windowed/borderless.
---
What about something to do with that Wild West event when and if it comes out (It‚Äôs only know through a leak but that leak did show us lesion elite which we did get).
---
Are you sure? It looks like the shotgun to me.
---
Oh. The skin through me off
---
When they got you trapped alone in objective and  they got a Fuze, it‚Äôs all over
---
No bcos they hold the X-KAIROS by a grip sticking out the side, not by the bottom of the gun.
---
That‚Äôs your internet mate I just finished on playing on the same servers
---
is there a link to a comparison
---
Oh I posted that after you replied. Sorry.
---
You only need to try every lock that looks like that one.

Hello exliger, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c30bay/ranked_is_becoming_unplayable/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

That was an insane flick, bad luck it was your teammate tho.

Laughs with season pass and black ices
---
That Vigil is sick nice job dude
---
Thanks for the suggestions everyone im gonna buy lesion
---
Ahem may I contradict you there about Ela. I'm a main of her and in no way is she good everywhere. Barely even in one place she is. Her scorpion is the 2nd lowest damaging gun in game. At 23 max damage it's already pretty bad. But at its small fall off range of 18m it's even more pathetic at only 15 damage. Which is like I said pathetic. But her recoil is also pretty shit. vertically it's fine but horizontally it's random which in a game that still wants to call itself competitive it's pretty bullshit how one mag the recoil goes one way, then the next it goes to the sky in the opposite direction.
---
Her pistol is pretty mediocre at best since it's the least damaging in game. The sight on it is really just a niche so don't say it's the greatest since it has a tiny little dot on a pane of glass.
---
Her secondary gadgets are pretty much useless to her as she's a roamer given an anchors tools. Barbed wire and a shield won't bring you anywhere on your team or even for yourself unless you have a decent Frost on your team that you can help. Gadgets like the camera, impacts, or even the damn censor gadget that's been in game for ages would be very well suited for her.
---
Her mines are only lackluster to say the most. They're good in the end of a match when there's only a couple of enemies at most. They can be very struggling to deal with in that situation but when they usually go off it's the beginning of the round where every attacker has a buddy behind him. It doesn't help either that they're not lethal, effects just wear out, they're easy to spot, and aren't plentiful. And unlike just about every defending gadget aren't given markers above them to say when and where they went off. And unlike Lesion's mines which are better in almost every way asides getting rid of your sound they require you to remove them manually. This requires time to find cover and get to it while also being slowed. And if not removed will kill you. Ela's mines though just last a measly 5 seconds or 10 if you waste 2 on someone.
---
Ela's not good at roaming. Not good at anchoring. Not good at gathering intel when compared to everyone else. Not good at holding angles, not good at rotating, and not good at killing. Unless you use the best shotgun in game that can outrange and out damage some attacking guns even at ranges around 20m. With her shotgun there's no reason to use the scorpion as it out guns that weapon and out ranges it with damage as well. But shotguns have limited distance until their pellets disappear so they're not going to win a gunfight past 20m. Or even around 10-15m if the attacker has any kind of cover which they usually will.

your art is unironically shit

They used to call that drophacking in LoL

Well that's a new strat I haven't seen before

Pulse is watching his watching:/

Yes this can happen.

Engine limitation.

Plus, people shoot them regardless, the game plays fast and people will shoot at anything if you place them well.
---
Sound exciting. If you hear any more detail. Share it immediately.
---
Thanks dude!

Because as soon as me and my friend are about to hi plat 2 we face a 4-stack of diamonds.
---
me abd my friends in da 1st ranked round
---
Technical limitations apparently.
---
I'm not saying it's a repost lmao.
---
I said it's nothing new and is *way* too similar to your previous.
---
In game chat everyone is talking about this problem and how they had it in their past game
---
Yeah no, the PDW9 is already strong enough with its non existent recoil and huge mag, there's no need for a damage boost.
---
Glaz went through enough trouble already.
---
I see, and that does make sense, I just wish I could buy uniforms for Alibi and use a scope without having to worry about hurting the usefulness of her gadget.
---
Yea alot of people 4 and 5 stack in diamond and plat it‚Äôs ridiculous, especially if you are a solo q player
---
Huh. Odd. 
---
Just finished a couple games on east servers, smooth as silk for me.
---
Not a macro i just click really fast üëç

You just have to practice your aim. People play way more aggressive on PC because the one shot headshot mechanic plays a bigger role in the game.
---
In need 4 more

No one:

Lesion elite:Boner

Remind yourselves that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer

Idiot. Theres no signs in R6

I like it. She looks like a 40 years old mom.

No.

4 wheeled works but 2 wheeled seems tricky and maybe impossible?
---
On it.

Its not that - its the *other* hand and the way it moves that makes the animation look weird as hell.
---
actually i don‚Äôt like that animation, it‚Äôs feeling like he‚Äôs running slow

I'm happy you enjoy the game man, I wish this community was a bit more positive, remember one thing even if people trash talk don't worry about them, keep playing for the people who have fun with you on their team
---
YES PLEASE
---
MR. Homeless
---
Oh I have no intention of doing so, I mistyped and meant that having a macro fuck up everyones game is way too easy. No I actually value the game and my elo too much haha
---
ping difference
---
Yeah it's unlikely you could do it with conventional IRL wheels, however we can assume that the in game drones may have motor control on the sideways rotating parts, which overall would allow movement sideways still.
---
But yeah, would be quite the tech, albeit DC motors can be made quite small nowadays, and you can work in a gear system in the wheels perhaps.
---
Thanks I met them people but I just mute them and have fun this game just gives me so much joy it‚Äôs insane
---
Agreed.
---
Yup that was my reaction
---
Then stop tracking my Pulse
---
I hate you for that
---
It‚Äôll get better trust me. Once you get out of the bronze, silver range where smurfs like to chill you‚Äôll play people more your speed. It also helps to have a few friends so that you don‚Äôt get left with some smurfs ranking down on your team. Last night I had 14 kills in 4 rounds and my teammates starting killing me and stealing the defused so I couldn‚Äôt win. Trust me this game is frustrating but when you get the hang of it there‚Äôs no other game like it.
---
Ehh... people run a certain way... and it‚Äôs a video game, I don‚Äôt know what you expected, but realism isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôd expect.
---
Oh thanks mate, ill try it out
---
If a system like this is going to happen, this is a decent way to do it.
---
But I would rather stick with random map selection. I've yet to see a game where player-influenced map selection actually improved things, rather than just narrowing a game's content even further.
---
We don't need any more "Fox only, Final Destination" in this game. Pick and ban already is doing enough of the first half of that.
---
Hate to be that guy...
---
Unless that paper is on fire it‚Äôs not going to emit infrared signatures

It‚Äôs stupid by ubi

Gotta hand it to your team right there, great calls and your shots were on point. Good shit
---
yeah i have a pretty great team haha
---
Community options (on the right if you're on computer) then the pen icon
---
I like Nokk's running animation
---
Without going into detail, you mess around with a Claymore and it makes it so that IQ "runs" at the speed of a drone while her visual model is pretty much lay down (I think her hitbox stays the same though)

**Don't destroy armor.**
---
A defender that has been downed once can pick up that armor later to replace the one they lost.
---
If an attacker has site control so well that he can stop and pick up armor, you've already fucking lost that round.
---
When iq had nades
---
Stupiiiiidddd

Good idea

Oof

I second this statement

How does it jump?

Did you see the connection problem icons on the top right. Who the fuck you blaming here? Its not the game‚Äôs fault

Cheer up glaz, you can at least see beauty in yellow, the best color :)
---
All while getting hit by echo, good job man
---
you‚Äôre an idiot mate, the guys comment originally said he was suing mouse and keyboard and then he edited it because he realised how much of a pure retard he looked like, so next time maybe try and think instead of spewing pure idiocy.
---
No problem! Don't look at it as if you were being negative though. You made the same point I've been making for years, a lot of players just don't realize it though.
---
Damn.
---
You can solve the problem by uninstalling fort√±≈´t
---
nah it should be a yellow head and bring teammates
---
It would have cost you $0 not to say that
---
Head's up enemy RC-XD spotted!
---
Not as hard a time as Warden
---
It's a pretty bad operator ability because(at least on PC) most guns have minimal recoil. But I'd take the addition of a shit op over an annoying/overpowered op anyday
---
 I've been wanting this change for literally 2 years, as dedicated players I think we deserve at least a little bit in terms of fan service. It's ridiculous that they can charge 30 bucks for the season pass and still not give us a simple fix. Literally F2P games have this feature and a fucking massive game like this can't even be bothered to help their players with something so simple. I want Ela's massive titties to jiggle when I headshot her, I want cav's ass to clap. Please, ubi, any endearing developer would make this change.
---
Just try sledge for attackers, simple and nothing too complicated, his weapon is decent and his gadget is not useless. On the other side, as a defender i think pulse it's pretty easy to play, but of course you may try doc or rook, both supporting the team. Let's not forget bandit's SMG (godlike)  but he is a less armored  operator. Hope I could help you, reply for suggestions. I didn't include other operators than the ones from the standard edition.
---
Lmfao it may be rated M but if they wont even allow some bad words you bet your ass they aren't about to apply those great physics we all want. They legit almost removed slot machines, a goddam aesthetic.
---
lol you can play at a high level on pc with 60hz...higher hz is not a necessity
---
Rook = extremely easy
---
well if it makes you feel any better, I have an irrational fear of furries. I know no one asked, but I have no care in the world.
---
im sure they changed the face too, since it looks alot different than caveria even with the muck headgear (which gets rid of facepaint)
---
Those might be good guns for beginners but in terms of their special abilities those are not very good suggestions for beginners.
---
Operators like Rook and Sledge would be more suitable.
---

Hello luk3ass! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
Can you get banned for buying accounts
---
Kap-ban
---
GG.
---
Sledge.
---
Honestly, operators with simple guns and gadgets that help you with the fundamentals of siege 
---
Attack: Sledge (destruction), IQ (intel), thermite (hard breaching)
---
Defense:  mute (counter intel/counter hard breach) and kapkan (traps) and then rook (anchoring)
---
Ubi has a stick so far up their ass with marketing, bug fixes, making the game nicer for the fucking language police, that they can't even fucking give us some simple shit.
---
The mags are huge :) my mistake because i followed the wrong picure sizing lol. Rest assured im going to craft a new one that fits my frame better :)
---
Or you know actually start your own account
---
Well I don‚Äôt play as him because he is so underpowered so it‚Äôs not a problem for me
---
The joke is unoriginal but the way you executed it flawlessly
---
Kinda reminds of the guy from Cyberpunk 2077
---
Ggwp
---
I know a lot of people (me included) just play lone wolf to get our warmups in.
---
sign me the fuck up
---
Ehhhh no thanks
---
You get banned for trying to sell and for using a sold acc (especially accs which probably unlocked stuff with hack software)
---
you would have to wait 12-24 hours after services are done. bans happen whenan account goes from one ip to another to fast.
---
It honestly a top tier requirement that we all want
---
That skill actually would be pretty cool. Imagine a grenade that works like a scattershot maverick. Takes half a second to burn through so it's not overpowered. Wouldn't be able to crawl through it or control how the pattern hits. Different enough from maverick to have it's own use cases without being OP.
---
Check your keybind to open it.
---
Shit happened to me yesterday
---
Yeah something needs to be done with him, next  season after the hype around him has died down I honestly see being in the top 5 least played ops.
---
Hearing "INTERROGATION" on Defense :D

Hearing "INTERROGATION" on Attack D:

some will be brand new accounts not even logged into siege yet.

Is it because of the skull that is usually on Cav's face?
---
Ah, nothing like good ol' grandpa and grandson time. I'm so jealous.
---
You too, I‚Äôve got a video I‚Äôm trying to post but it‚Äôs taking an arm and a leg to do so. BAN IQ EVERYTIME
---
Guess I have to say it here now too.  I'm not sure that this would work out. Even if he's bad at aiming, he'd still be reported for aimbotting.
---
Imagine if you could actually shoot through his stomach.
---
You should be able to attach your cameras to drones change my mind.
---
You'll never stop me from wishing these things :(
---
Odds are you'll get it next time you launch the game.
---
Yeah we started banning IQ after that even though we knew that glitch was available but we didn‚Äôt think players would take advantage of it and be toxic
---
Hopefully haha
---
Zof's AR is pretty solid, I typically run a suppressor on it and it still 3 shots, and has pretty manageable recoil. (Personally I'd say it's about on par with IQs AUG or Twitch's F2)
---
I dont use her LMG near as much, but it's an LMG so it's suppression with 150 mag size is a big plus. Does more damage than her AR at the expense of RPM but you can run an ACOG on it too.
---
Her utility is pretty average, her impacts on her gadget are always hit or miss for me, I mostly use them for soft breaching or destroying gadgets, but if you can manage to land her concussions they're potent. 
---
She also has the advantage(?) of being able to get up from DBNO (like Doc) but with only 5 health by holding X/Square/whatever PC uses
---
There should be some sort of mechanic where people with mics are matched together more often.
---
I don‚Äôt normally complain and I am normally able to hold my own with a positive K/D. But this one experience made me piping hot.
---
Ive found more clips and it looks like you somehow take the height of the drone and move around as if you some how were able to phantom through the floor whike traveling on your drone but still being an operstor.
---
They wont get banned for glitching, ou wont get your mmr back since its not cheating (external assist) but using a glitch in game and the exploit wont get fixed untill its replicated multiple times/reported so best case next mid season release. 
---
Report it to [ubi support](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Cases/new?template=R6CheatReportPC) 
---
If you know how to reproduce it report it with steps on the[ bug tracker site for r6](https://r6fix.ubi.com/)s (its a official site not 3rd party) 
---
And if you just have videos with the bug twitter it to the rainbow6 pages and famous streamers.
---
Doesn't make it worse that I have black ice for all the original ops at 231
---
Maybe a little to distracting seeing those colours flash up on your screen. If they actually implement it they should add a setting for the transparency of the icon.
---
I'm kinda salty and im just gonna resort to doing it myself. If ubisoft won't fix things even after ive tried to get it fixed and provide them with proof, im gonna get my elo back my own way.
---
Best i can hope for is this goes crazy big and ubi finally pays attention to it.
