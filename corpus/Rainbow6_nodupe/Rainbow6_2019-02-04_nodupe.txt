At this point I'm already tilted when I see a ping abusing stack in the enemy team. It's made me age 10 years in a span of months.

It is actually impossible to remove  peekers advantage. It's never going to happen unless everyone is playing on LAN.

The last legendary thing I got a was a weapon skin for lesion shotgun. Yours is better

Fair enough

Dude this Fox is just stole my Girlfriend 
---
Yea I joined 5 months before they made attachments free. So I was purchasing all of the ops and attachments too
---
I can't open your reply to my comment, so I'll rephrase.
---
This game is fine other than the rampant crouch and lean spam, which is going to be fixed. You really just need to play the game more. Get used to people's playstyles, recognize trends, learn to counter them. Use peekers advantage. Learn the height of people's heads, standing, crouched, or prone. Begin to listen and recognize when to begin prefiring so you kill them when they round corners, use the element of surprise. Start to learn your playstyle, and play operators that suit you well and synergize with the other ops on your team. These mechanics in the game are for increasing skill cap. Considering the way you feel right now, I'm going to guess you're new (because 99% of people level 70 and above are fine with the mechanics). Just play the game more and you'll learn, cosciously or subconsciously, your brain will begin making connections. The mechanics really are fine other than crouch and lean spam.
---
This again is just a really really long way of saying get good. That's all I can say.
---
Lol, you die in 3 seconds if someone is repelling. That's the funniest way to get killed I've seen this week :d
---
Why is it sometimes I load into maps and it has the obnoxious gray film over everything and other times there is no film?
---
Probably because you are using ash
---
Because PL bans Blitz every round, you're right. /s
---
No, people ban Lion and Blitz because they're both obnoxious to play against. They may not even be overpowered but damn they're annoying.

This is my opinion (and I'll embrace all the downvotes I get) - so longas the person is playing CASUAL, I do not see a problem with using a Xim. Main reason is - not all of my friends play PC, and I'd much rather use my mouse and keyboard than my controllers on PS4 or X1 unless I'm playing a racing game. In an ideal world, we should be able to choose what peripherals we want to use on console, and not have to use a third party adapter. I do not own Siege on console, however if I did, my opinion would likely be the same.
---
I don't know about you, but I get a lot of "A player that you reported recently has been banned" messages in CS:GO.
---
Siege's report button is just a "feel good" button.
---
At least the trigger discipline is pretty consistent.

Never thought I‚Äôd say it... cav needs a nerf. Or it‚Äôs just a bug that‚Äôs existed for who knows how long. 
---
Ah yes ridiculously long matches for less rewards I'll pass
---
Dyke ela
---
So what does turtle mode mean because my first thought was that she will go prone and kill them.
---
F
---
Yeah, when I use to play BF4 and BF1 (which I put many hours in) I kept knifing people once instead of twice or thrice, and melee animations are a big reason why my K/D is lower than I'd like.
---
If they just implement this into ranked how would it be any less rewarding? 
---
Not really. But yeah maybe everyone is gonna peek this 
---
I don't wanna be that guy, but... she's cute. Really well done drawing
---
If you think that tongue clash looked more like girl over Alibi... then I dont know what to say.
---
Finka and Clash are the most manly looking female operators. And Clashes bald head doesnt help her looks.
---
F for her thumb lmao 
---
Show the killcam
---
is a doc, what u expected?
---
you can tk two people but you cant tk the same person twice
---
Imma be that guy and say no
---
If there are enemies in the line of sight you do not get penalized. Basically if your shooting in the direction of am enemy and you tk you wont catch that ban.
---
You serious or just being that guy
---
&gt;:(
---
Yep
---
To not use an entire mag to kill sum thicc French boi
---
This is not true I don‚Äôt think.
---
Lol I‚Äôm just being that guy.    Recruits with dlc weapons would be fun. But it would also be extremely op
---
Other than shotguns I like to run it with Buck's primarys and some machine pistols
---
Customizing Reticle shapes might break the balancing of the Sights, Color customization would be a nice addition though.   
---
Personally I would just like to see more sight options available. I'd like to see the sights the Russian operators have available for everyone and vise versa. As well as the addition of a mid-range scope with less zoom then the Acog but more then the reflex, red dot, or holo sights.
---
NA
---
This is a good idea, might need a few adjustments but nevertheless it's a good idea.
---
I watched video and so on lol not gonna stare at a matchmaking timer
---
1. Quit matchmaking
---
2. Do it again
---
3. Or just let it be and soak on the sweet sweet karma
---
Oh boy, 3am!
---
In casual there is no real matchmaking. I get match with plat elo most of the time but sometimes bronzes or genuine coppers. In ranked you start at a gold elo for the first 10 matches and depending on Win vs. Loss stats you get a rank. Currently all wins get you plat 3, each loss draining one rank from it. When you lose all of them you‚Äôll be copper.  (So im told, I got silver three this season with 6 losses, that‚Äôs what you get when ranking alone on day 1)
---
You have to contribute something to get rewarded.

Sounds to me like you actually know very little about IT in general. You claim to program stuff, which requires IT knowledge. Yet you make such a basic mistake that you actually claim that wireless connection can be the source of issues when one uses wired connection.

That's like me saying "Yeah, the engine in my car runs on petrol so it must certainly be suffering from issues with the diesel I can't even use."

The Bandit doesn't need his nitro cell either for real though most use his barbed wire.

I got a Jager Carbine skin, A Mira Vector Skin, and the Angel Charm across two accounts... The Jager one is pretty nice, but the Mira one is kinda plain and you wouldn't even notice there's a skin on her gun unless you really focused.

Leavers make this game mode unplayable. I can't remember actually getting to start one of these games. Normally just join in progress

As long as they start punishing leavers I'm keen

Make it an operation. Make Knight and Bishop cameo ops. Remake 3 kings casino.

can make the map only available to every1 else
---
The paddles don‚Äôt change the game that much. A mouse and keyboard is significantly better, given that you get direct input with the mouse instead of having to guide your aim with a joystick. Varying power levels only change resolution for most games or better graphical fidelity, which doesn‚Äôt have a noticeable impact on performance. Frames and input lag have impact on performance, which isn‚Äôt changed by the choice of console for competitive games.
---
Do you have that 1? I was wondering if it has separate chat and game audio control wheels because that is the worst part about the g933 
---
I use Corsair Void Pros that i thoroughly enjoy. Great sound quality, and a comfortable fit. THE Corsair Utility Engine that comes with it lets you customize your sound EQ to make certain things louder (i.e footsteps)

You not going pro doesn't change the fact that he is, inherently, and fundamentally, broken, and all you need is a coordinated Cancer stacks to ruin your entire week with an unfair loss.

yeah i‚Äôve got that one, but there‚Äôs no separate chat and game control unfortunately

I miss that game so much, the customization and all, so many memories

Gold 1 , it fucking sucks in here

I get your point. Casual randos like everything, even stupid things like recruit.

But favela is trash. Universally accepted. It's legit paper mache.

Leavers ruin this game mode, period.

I don‚Äôt think a few operators are gonna make you lose a round... lion is fine as he is with all the other operators, It‚Äôs sounds like you scan those ops and then just sit there because you already know you‚Äôll lose.

Anything to do with complaining about the matchmaking, peeker's advantage or hitreg (to be fair, a lot of the hitreg posts *are* misses, just not all of them) gets bombed while bad excuses for Ubisoft get upvoted and the post never gets to anyone.

I could see this sub getting big

&gt;If a pro player does it for that exact reason it tells you how useful she actually is

This mentallity really really really needs to fucking die in Siege.

"Just cuz a pro in PL did it, it means its right!"
---
No. No. No.
---
Not in Siege. LoL. Dota. CS. Any e-sport. There is so many variables, strats, and well, 99.9% of players aren't pros.
---
Eh.  I just don't like how he's supposedly this "sniper" when he's really just used to rush in as fast as possible.  
---
I like where he is rn, too, but I think he'd be better off as a legit sniper imo.
---
Bummer? I'm not really blaming you or anything man. Just saying that Cav's a comfortable solo-q ban. 
---
this is one of the funniest responses to anything I‚Äôve ever seen for some reason. thank you 
---
Hahaha, theres no way you got banned for only 1 tk. Hell, i tk all the time and i havnt got banned yet.
---
I really like this idea.  I feel like this would be a good change, because it allows him to fulfill his role as a sniper, just not to the extend he did in the pre-thermal scope era, where he could one shot pretty much anyone no matter what.  
---
Great idea!
---
Personally the only thing I'd change is; I'd make him a 3 speed 1 armor allowing him to move to different positions outside the OA quicker.

Give me millions of dollars multiple programmers coders and other developers and such and also give me the ability to do the coding and we will see.

Ok but why are you using red dot on that gun.
---
Good call on that man. 
---
Anybody can play in a go4 
---
You can crouch spam using a controller, especially scuf controllers or elite controllers. K&amp;M doesnt give magical peek without ads features. 
---
Yeah that I agree with
---
Your first point is complete bullshit. It doesnt make any sense to delay the bans just because lion gets banned all the time. There's a reason he gets banned. Give the players an option to ban him rather than forcing them to play against it until hes fixed.
---
Your second point is understandable, but having non competitive maps in the map pool is one of the reasons why people dont have accurate ranks, which makes ranked unenjoyable. If you want map diversity cool, but if u want ranks to display skill level, then the maps need to be competitive.
---
What‚Äôs a macro?

You also get 100 experience points Kappa

im just wondering if its possible for people to find out because I cant find anything about their backup roster

He's not a fragger and shields are buggy as hell atm, but my main tip is patience. And map awereness. 
---
Know where you can stand in a corner or doorway, and wait for when they turn their attention elsewhere. Then fast shield down and shoot shield up. If you don't get the kill, wait. Don't keep shooting, Cus then they will turn on you.
---
Monty is hard if you are alone but it is durable. Specially on console where people don't have the best aim.
---
And clutching with Monty man, that feels awesome, aaand a little dirty to be honest. 
---
Based off what he‚Äôs told you, I think he‚Äôs talking out his ass. Many teams don‚Äôt have a backup and their coach plays if needed. If his name isn‚Äôt on a regular roster, he‚Äôs probably not part of the org.
---
I don't believe it on Realistic difficulty. Video or it didn't happen.
---
Nobody that good would switch to ps4 
---
Seeing through smoke isn't unfair lmao that's like one of the main points of his special ability.
---
okay thanks for the help!
---
Killcams are not competitive, they give away too much intel, I shouldn‚Äôt know that there are 4 ppl pushing a room because I got killed across the map by 1 of em, they should honestly just add a theatre mode into the game and keep killcams out of ranked
---
My team managed to ban castle and capitao, the enemies were so confused
---
I personally think they should def add more rounds, change it to 10 overall rounds with 6 rounds required to win, the same overtime settings
---
While speed shooting with a revolver would be impressive, it would be a very short competition
---
SI stands for sexual intercourse, change my mind
---
I agree, when someone in my team gets knifed, i always look around me or ask where did he get knifed
---
Oh yes I really thought I should record this in case one day I mention it on reddit and someone says video or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
Yes they are ubisoft 
---
But they aren't EA
---
Can't relate
---
Also I agree with the killcam part, but disagree with needing a higher level to play ranked. I dont understand why you bring placement matches into this, since every one regardless of their skill level starts from the same amount of ranked points. A higher level requirement to play ranked won't fix this. It is a problem tho that a new player who plays ranked for the first time is playing against golds and high silvers. That's just telling that the ranked system needs to be improved. The new playlist is an improvement and is unrelated to this matter. There is 0 reason to not implement this new playlist until the ranked system is completely reworked.
---
When I got to multiplayer it started working so it must just of been situations problem. I had the same problem with IQ. It made them harder but I still succeeded
---
This makes me respect the dude I played last night, his name was Blitzmain1233 kr something like that, we banned blitz and he stayed for the whole match.
---
Why would she use a revolver or shotgun for speed shooting? (Which is what she is doing, and has a past of (her bio), hence the stopwatch in Finka's hand)
---
What a great addition to the rainbow six siege reddit, maybe you should post a video of you vaulting over a desk because its just a interesting.
---
I can't even try to shield myself from these terrible puns
---
What in the world
---
and then he died by a claymore 
---
Doesn't mean you can't do it again and record it. I  really doubt your rushed, solo as Ash, and beat it in one minute on Realistic.
---
Basically a macro is a script that does a set of instructions with one press of a button . So from the kill cams it looks like he had it programmed so that whenever he presses the L2 button to aim down sights it would trigger the crouch button to spam over and over again without him actually pressing circle to crouch , allowing him to keep his thumb on the right stick to keep his aim on point . It‚Äôs basically cheating .
---
In some (and probably most) situations a fast reaction time with good aim will benefit you a lot but it‚Äôs not necessarily required. I lack both but I‚Äôm able to pull my own weight. 3 speed roaming/rushing ops might not be for you, but there are many operators to choose from so I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find a fitting main to your play style. Communication is key so if you do end up getting it I‚Äôll be more than happy to show you the ropes.
---
Exactly the problem
---
Operation Full House
---
With mnk you can‚Äôt do it either. 
---
Why would that lead to more team killing?
---
I had the same thought.  Go for foot high, mira cant trick or fire back, you can use stairs to black her way out. You now have a pet mira in a box.
---
You're one to be calling people dumb
---
That‚Äôs how people do that so fast in ranked, I now know. Thanks 
---
its free renown, why are you complaining? personally i just ignore the t hunt ones because you can still get 1k plus from the weekly challenges anyway. i just dont bother
---
Not me
---
Rather than spam the crouch button/key/trigger, they use a macro/script that will automatically do it for them.
---
You can aim much better if your not constantly spamming crouch, so this puts the user at an advantage.
---
Sorry if this is a shit explanation.
---
Yeah teamkillers are the lowest of the low.
---
One minute was an exaggeration lmao, by rush I mean breach the garage and rush it, then shit myself after almost running into a bomber and go a bit slower
---
I hope you screenshot it.
---
What just what
---
those are some thicc hands
---
Yeah the values seem completely randomly assigned. 
---
that throw tho 
---
Well he dose have 2 more assists than you 
---
You've gotta get those assists haha scores are broken so bad in this game
---
Lol you forgot to crouch
---
Stonemountain6r uploaded this im pretty sure. Maybe you sent it to him? Idk still cool tho.
---
Okay but I would *love* to see a Vegas-themed Season, with a casino map and operators based on LVMPD SWAT.
---
Although, as I type it, maybe the idea of setting a season in a casino in a city that had a really high-profile mass shooting might be a bit too controversial for Ubi to risk.
---
More like what was that fine thinking
---
Eh I heard that shit from a YouTuber already 
---
Obvious flick spot. Not a one tap. Perfectly legit.
---
Clash is just a bad pick lol 
---
*abusing a clearly broken mechanic.
---
At the highest levels on console siege, it‚Äôs deadass every player. At this point I feel like an outlier for using a controller. 
---
Console? 
---
Well I do think there should be a training mode. I don't think it should replace t-hunt. I wish they would do more with the white masks since they are the reason team rainbow was re-activated in the first place. And I like how the white masks look. I think the training should have the terrorist models from the first few situations. Y'know, the ones that don't have "white masks"
---
I don't think you know what the definition of broken is.
---
Me irl
---
When i first started r6...lying down for a round and aimin
---
 
---
* Is the new mode fun?
---
Yes. 100% meme value and 100% tryhard value aswell
---
* What is your experience with the ban phase? Which operators get banned the most?
---
Cav feels necessity in few maps, many players just go for lion + blitz ban which isnt really essential tbh. A hibana/thermite/thatcher ban is more effective than lion/blitz/dokkaebi. Hopefully this will be fixed with lion rework.
---
* Do you enjoy the attack/defense rotation? Is one side favored?
---
Attacks/defense gets one side favoured because of mentality more than the map. I have dominated attack side on same map while in next match i am getting dominated on attack on SAME MAP. Losing attack and playing it again feels un-confident but that's just me. You do learn your mistakes faster
---
* Does the limited map pool fit the playlist?
---
Yeah.... But i do like the current rank map pool aswell. I dont hate any maps in this game TBH except YACHT that map is a mistake
---
* What is your opinion on the mode being Bomb-only? Do you enjoy the increased planting/defusing duration?
---
I think secure area might be good aswell.
---
* Should this mode be implemented for Ranked play?
---
YUS
---
* Should this mode be implemented for Casual play?
---
YUS. 
---
* Should this mode find a permanent place in a separate playlist from Ranked or Casual?
---
Maybe.... not. Ranked fits better

Found the cav main
---
Fully agree. Especially on 3. I‚Äôve had a few matches now where it becomes like a cat and mouse game where you learn where the attackers like to push and how, then adapt to that and they learn what you like to do on defence. It‚Äôs great.

Honestly, what‚Äôs with the ranked matchmaking? Does it just think ‚Äúoh so you‚Äôre in plat? Diamonds. Diamonds and diamonds only.‚Äù

Yeah I had a feeling that it could be client side only. Thanks for showing me the video, that is super fast. Hopefully someone with friends runs some sound tests.

I just read your post and i totally agree with you on the points you stated. I was shocked to find out that there was no Elo compensation for matches where a cheater was present. This just shows why ranked is still in beta.

The map of article 5?

Cept for probably half those kills are from people with mouse and keyboard if you play ranked.

This is the last I'm gonna to worry about this post. 
---
The way you picture it to me is to just add code that prevents diamonds from playing with anyone lower than plat 3. That won't work though. The matchmaking system calculates your MMR across past season to calculate who you will go against. Due to this system if you were to just straight up prevent anyone lower than plat 3 from vsing diamonds those high golds who may have been diamond several seasons before hand will be stuck vsing actual golds and absolutely dominating. That will ruin the grind and experience for those actual gold players and they won't be able to improve or get any further. The only thing that would be an easy fix to help boosting is to reduce smurfing.
---
I hope that makes sense.

Tell me more about Siege's FREE DLC

im the opposite. im a big dum but boy i can click on heads good

Thats intentional you dummy
---
Main a Machine Pistol operator, you'll need to have good aim otherwise you'll die everytime.
---
Same goes for P90 or other low damage SMGs, if you don't hit the head you'll probably lose. It gives you the incentive to aim better...
---
*mains a sci-fi bullshit character*
---
Hmm
---
Have to disagree on the map pool.
---
The meta is stale on some of the maps but it would definitely change with the pick and ban phase. Imagine playing Skyscraper without Thatcher (forget entering from geisha) or Thermite (it will make defending kitchen viable without resorting to runouts.
---
I'd say limiting the map pool would end up in a repetitive gameplay. 
---
I understand the lion, dokkabie and jackal hate. But not shields

Free Maps
---
Free operators  
---
Free cosmetic bundles
---
Free cosmetic packs during events
---
Free charms through challenges 
---
All of the above are **FREE** and are added on a regular cycle. 
---
New challenges each week to garner renown and charms, at least one cosmetic bundle to obtain with renown. A new free map every 3 months, 2 free operators. The only additional content that costs actual cash each season is elite sets. 
---
Again, i will stress my point as made in a prior comment - renown is a free in game currency. Play = renown. 
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
2 more weeks of packs, yes
---
School shooters are feds anyway so just play Ash or Thermite for enhanced realism

Time consuming and rage inducing are the two parameters they use to create challenges it seems.

This is him explaining how playing Lion is just a "sprint, press 4 and kill people" operator. Well Blitz is exactly the same. 
---
If you use Blitz, Finka, Lion, Dokkaebi and Ash. You essentially are an unstoppable force if you do it right with no real counters.
---
Not if they go ahead with their plan to bring the game to China
---
No one likes being charged at, flashed, and blinded.

He‚Äôs much like Mei in Overwatch. Freeze you in place and watch yourself get domed with no way to do anything about it....that‚Äôs why.

We're doing gods work, I'm no Blitz main but every time the enemy team isn't banning blitz I pick Blitz so next match they will remember to always ban blitz.

Nice one. Damn thats some blind players

I‚Äôm about to say the N-word

I used to praise Siege for its fairly mature community compared to other MP games I've been through, but lately this is changing. I don't mind casual shenanigans, but it has gotten way worse in ranked. Getting teamkilled because someone thinks you're bad (despite them being lower in both score and kills), and then being brought to 20 hp every start of the round without being able to do something about it. And I doubt some reporting will do anything about it. At least allow us to submit clips of very toxic behaviour and provide us feedback that something was done with it
---
Odds are it got removed before you saw it.
---
He counted as a DLC OP? Cause he was 15k when I got him
---
IQs 552 model uses a 20 round magazine but holds 30. The 417 also has 10 rounds in a mag but the model uses a 20 rounder.
---
Buck, Frost, BB, Valkyrie, Caveira, Capitao, Hibana and Echo are Year 1 DLC Operators.
---
They are on 40% discount currently tho
---
R6 but everyone is pulse
---
Then why this is has Bern up for 20 minutes? 
---
Oh aight, from those Y1 ops I have Buck, and Hibana as an attack
---
What for though? I am sitting on ~200k renown and have nothing to spend it on, as most skins look like shit and cosmetics are for children anyway. 
---
are we the baddies?
---
Well, thermite would melt a bit of bricks on both sides, but far from enough to cut through. And c4 or whatever is used might nullify itself so bricks intern would be crashed but stay in place. Those breaching charges are made for wooden or very thin walls. Termite's charge is only different because it has thermite on edges to cut through metal plate. It's not ultimate tool of destruction
---
I just got the banana to scale charm...
---
It think legally you cant

Thats why you dont use red dot
---
DLC stands for downloadable content. 
---
When they package a seasonal DLC they need to push an update to the game. Titled in tbe formula of Y4S1 (4.1) 
---
They are still branched as DLC. Add on content has to be downloaded to access. As so seasonal updates.  
---
Two ends of the stick. Go do some game development research and come back to me. 
---
I can understand her. 
---
If you want a full-on average, it‚Äôs 1.0
---
Realistically, this number shouldn‚Äôt concern you too much to begin with.
---
the matchmaking is horrible. I'm a low gold, majority of my friends are silver. I havent seen that much platinums and even diamonds as in the SI playlist being paired against.
---
Mods are asleep 
---
Number one
---
Nice
---
nah noone cares about that
---
He has hibana, read the post lol
---
Okay, your talking scientifically.
---
Thermite as a person, has yet to be studied by science(he is my brother in law, and if you try to make him a test subject you will be eliminated)
---
Trust me when I say, he is the ultimate weapon of destruction. Not tool.
---
People ban them because they are either annoying to play against and make the game not fun, or they need rebalancing. Not because they‚Äôre scared. 
---
"Go do some game development research and come back to me. "
---
So you're telling me that necessary game updates are DLC? Umm what?
---
Average is 1.0 but kd doesn't matter in this game. You can be a support player. Usually the fraggers are the ones with the highest kd but it depends on the rank
---
Oh.. I thought he was listing the ones he doesn‚Äôt have... kinda makes it a chore to think of all the ones he doesn‚Äôt have to make sure we don‚Äôt miss any.

Best way to determine is the eyes. Fake ones don‚Äôt have em

Hello M_Computer, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/an0sdh/freeze_and_crash_since_last_week/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You shouldn't worry about silly stats, they don't show a single thing about what really matters about you as a player, for example, your ability to work as a team or your overall game sense, so don't be hard on yourself if it's below average
---
I think it‚Äôs ok to have a ‚Äúmain‚Äù operator as long as you are willing to switch to something else when it‚Äôs not the right time to play it. 
---
That's a very wrong position dokki
---
Indeed
---
Ah you're just a kid after all, that explains a lot. 
---
I don‚Äôt really see the issue with lion and jackal though, they‚Äôre easy to counter 
---
Im fine with that. I play the most time as supporting the team with drones and cams. 
---
Probably won't happen because of operation censorship.
---
I think that they will censor every future content because of China 
---
It‚Äôs cool and all, but I hate it when a team of 10 randoms bans Blitz and Lion. For the love of God, none of you is going to pick either of them, and even if you do, you will 99% mess it up, go ban operators that people actually pick **outside** pro games!
---
If you're planning on buying year 2 ops if they come on sale, then yeah, wait for Y4S1 to drop as its only just around the corner
---
Been playing for a year done it twice... JS
---
Hey what labtop, that looks like mine
---
It's crazy how defensive people are about this topic lol
---
Higher chance of getting an ACE!
---
The operators were based off someone helping doc do his job and someone who can disable attacker gadgets on the move.
---
Cav and Clash aren't that bad to deal with imo. Cav is easy to deal with if you spread out and do a systematic take of the building, and clash exists to slow things down, but a breaching round or lifeline takes care of her pretty easy. 
---
I‚Äôm sure some, if not most people are trolling, but there‚Äôs some people that legitimately think that the playlist promotes racism. My head hurts honestly 
---
The problem is not with the game but the people itself who play it. The bigger the audience, the bigger is the type of people who will play the game and try to break it.
---
Back in the day, Siege was regularly praised for it's mature and welcoming community. As the game got popular over the seasons, more idiots were attracted to it who just liked to ruin the fun for others. Also factor in the point of online anonymity with no real consequences.
---
It's a shame to see such a unique and fun game being destroyed by a bunch of trolls who just think that all is fun and if we do get punished, we'll get a new account and continue doing it.
---
I think it's fine - mute main
---
Who's that
---
I agree with they aren‚Äôt hard to kill just annoying to do so

That's his name and that also looks like him, so i would think so.

Am I the only one who thought that they were on some of Bandit's "candy" while watching this video?
---
gonna have to remember that

Insta-deinstall. No Point in playing anymore. I would have been so mad

true true cause its on the wood, im wondering if i can still hit all 4 walls if it touches the metal part of the catwalk
---
That's not the juggernaut... 
---
Right, Mute also has an awesome smg primary.
---
Thank you
---
People might be leaving when it switches to defending since they cant do their challenge when defending. 
---
The title was mostly a joke. When I say "how Siege was meant to be played" I'm just referring to pl settings and the pick and ban system in general 
---
I like it the way it is
---
As beav said, you have to shoot next to it or it will not explode by it. It will ricochet and explode on he ground.
---
Figured it would be a better title than "Recruit hitting the dab".
---
~~also I'm not old yet dammit~~
---
Feel free to use it in all your siege reaction memes :V
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee

A mAn LoSt HiS lIfE, DeLeTe tHiS

pretty sure you just gotta buy the standard edition
---
Back, way back, you started with no one but recruit
---
lifehack you can start a lonewolf as fbi and kill yourself, and still get the challenge. 
---
I understand that it was a joke but then saw the possibility for the joke an that all the more commonly banned operators were chosen to be banned and didn‚Äôt wanna miss out in the opportunity 
---
 I WAS WATCHING HIS WHILE PLAYING SIEGE AND IT HAPPENED
---
Nah, all good.
---
However, she has (at least until tomorrow's patch) a MASSIVE drop off in damage so any Luison bullet shot from a larger distance makes pretty much no damage even if registered correctly. Take thar into account when playing Cav. 
---
I'm not surprised, it's the same thing with a lot of fps games like CS GO where certain pro's have cheated before and haven't been caught for months if at all. I watched some R6 streams like 2-3 days ago and some of the streamers(diamond/pro league level) were matched against blatant wallhackers...
---
It doesn't work? Personally I've never had any problems with it. Not saying there aren't any problems but yeah. 
---
lmao what the fuck is that LOL
---
Umm no I disagree. The weapons fine it's the platform you play on which you have trouble with. Just switch to PC man problem solved
---
Good! We could use with a change. 
---
Ban out Echo or Lesion, then pick thatcher every round, they plannin something 
---
*nno*
---
Don't ban Lesion ):

Save it for 50 packs. Diamond skin looks like garbage, and the pack price is better for 50.

It was intended, that's why you can teabag in every FPS game. Nobody has complained about crouch spamming until the past few months after Ubi nerfed dropshotting.

Personally, I main Lesion and I play a lot of Montagne when I 5 stack 
---
what about that nitro cell
---
I have been trying to get him too. I play montange but he is determined to try and keep shield bros alive. 
---
I would have been mad for a second until i would figure out what just happened, then i would just be in awe. 
---
Come on man, you don't have to take this game so seriously, you're supposed to have fun.
---
Honestly, I haven't played siege for a while. That is not considered quitting siege. That is called taking a break from it. I think Battlefield v is way more fun than siege. Maybe you should try it.

---
Oof
---
I own diamond...Personally really never use it.
---
Recently also bought 25 packs too...Ended up getting 6 legendary things so..probably just good RNG though
---
Cav doesn't have good guns like other roamers in the game, we all know her ability is hard countered by a drone.
---
Monty is a bad choice. Because I think not much likes monty that's why you should choose a non-shield operator. Monty might get banned in matches too.
---
i just run and hide, you know, because caveira is good at that. 
---
* when someone tells you that youre getting swatted *
---
No it hasn't been proven that crouch spam breaks the hitbox. Rogue-9 already made a video on this.
---
Steamers rage when they die because they simply missed their shots when they aimed for the head. Crouch spamming is unbalanced because you can do it to move your hitbox very fast which makes you harder to hit, it doesn't break your hitbox though.
---
&gt;It is about having fun, not about abusing the shit out of everything and then bragging about the 3 kills you get.
---
Getting kills is fun. Anything that's part of the game and is not an exploit or glitch is going to be used by players to get an advantage. Lion was very unbalanced when Ubi released him, that didn't stop teams from using him to his full potential.
---
Crouch and lean spamming have always been part of the game and there have been no plans to nerf any of them until now because of recent outcries in the last few months. As long as they are part of the game, people are going to utilize them.
---
It's not abuse just because you're a cry baby that can't deal with it. Abuse is only for glitches and exploits. Spamming a key on your keyboard isn't an exploit, it's literally a function that's part of the game.
---
Been there since the map released and was never removed
---
Well that would be nice but what about the super toxic crowd that will keep their little xim adapters and continue playing with the controller players? If Ubi adds m&amp;k native support, it won't detect the xim, just a m&amp;k plugged directly to the console. They probably don't want to throw away an ‚Ç¨80+ device and I sure as fuck dont want to buy m&amp;k. If I did I'd build a PC.
---
It might ease the problem we have now, but it wouldn't fix it. MS needs to find a way to ruin these adapters through software changes and let them eat shit.
---
I like this idea.  Since the report button does absolutely nothing, we need a way to get these players banned.  It's about time something happens to them.
---
Great idea! Please do it as soon as possible!
---
That's a bad idea, because many people start turning themselves to be more toxic. If you are making a list of it, I feel like you're basically banning everyone.
---
Got you covered ;)

Get a headset, talk, listen for callouts, and watch the kill feed, not that hard
---
Yea I compiled all the evidence I had such as the messages and the game bugging out with 5 seconds left on the bomb, 1v3 and the round being our last one. I also sent the messages to Ubisoft but if it‚Äôs as difficult as you say I probably won‚Äôt bother next time. Thanks for your reply though, really interesting :) 
---
There‚Äôs a video on YouTube by PriesT where this happens to him 2 games in a row against the same team in the same situation, worth a watch.
---
UMMMMMMMMMMMMM
---
The problem was I joined an ongoing and never loaded in 
---
I think mine is installed but last time I tried it, there was a pretty severe audio bug on pc that I ran into. Might have to play some 360 for the nostalgia!
---
Same they ban clash and its like ok nobody was going to pick her anyway but cav I aslo dont see why you would ban her because she is helpful if you do the interrogation but 9/10 cav users dont interagate the only part of her that helps the team
---
Ik, but without it the game would be broken.
---
Like, people would Adrenal surge and rush in haphazardly with LMGs and Fuze because there would be no penalty for it.
---
It's a tough situation 
---
I mean, these guys didn‚Äôt even turn, they completely ignored his presence, I‚Äôm gonna take a guess they aren‚Äôt on comms hence why all of them got their asses destroyed.
---
Holo is the best alternative to Acog? Same zoom x1 as reflex?
---
Thx!
---
Lion can be really annoying at the right times. A lot of people will bring a Dokkaebi along and coodinate the use of their gadgets to get the defenders to sit still for a bit. I've also seen Jackal thrown into this mix as well as blitz.
---
In my personal opinion, blitz is just scary. Any good blitz main can ruin your day.
---
Miras mirrors are great, especially on bomb. They give a lot of intel.
---
Echo can prevent a plant, even in clutch situations. His drones are one of the most powerful gadgets in defense. 
---
Hahahahahaha that guy must be smashOng everything lol
---
If you listen to the people on here all high plat‚Äôs/Diamonds are using mouse and keyboard, from what I remember when I played with/against you on PS4 you‚Äôre diamond too right and use controller. 
---
I guess people love to have something to blame other than themselves. 
---
A whole new system, or 6^4 = 1296 individual charms to cover every possible combination. It's a cool idea, it's also very time consuming to implement.
---
Elite controllers and scuffs aren‚Äôt cheating though. They‚Äôre still controller users. M/k is cheating and most likely those that use them are ass with a controller. To beat a crouch spammer isn‚Äôt hard really as all you need to do is pre fire at their head and eventually they‚Äôll crouch up into a bullet and die. 
---
I guess. He played blitz way before the meta t hog and I don't think he played him the meta way. Rushing in and blitzing him. 
---
Can‚Äôt she only see them on their phones when they get a dokkaebi call?
---

I think two things. 
---
1. Had you been ADSing you would have got the Kill. (But wow you got unlucky with that hip fire) 
---
2. 95% chance no matter what ash had your number. (but a sick flick would've been cool) 
---
That sledge was coming in for the death swing
---
It feels like cheating though, and I know for a fact I‚Äôve seen a load of MnK users. I can beat crouch spammers if I know they‚Äôre doing it, but most of the time they just come round a corner in a blur and have already popped me. 
---
Clearly hacking /s
---
Idk man she seems pretty balanced to me, I dont see people pick her often and when they do it's often kids who think shes "op". 
---
Shes mostly used as a rusher but can be used to breach the bottom of an objective and shoot up. Rushing is countered by traps &amp; bottom breaching is countered by roamers.
---
Sure her hitbox has always been a problem but with cheeky moves like quick peeking being nerfed that's almost become unnoticeable.
---
Great ending the lord himself.
---
Kaid has his DMR/Shotgun that got an Acog
---
I haven't really seen it. Ash mains on the other hand. But I can't complain I went rook and I may have.. Spawn peeked
---
* dies of chimera virus *
---
Year Pass total value rounds at about 45-50 dollars, which fully compensates whatever you pay for it.
---
You‚Äôre telling me. Call had no nitro, Kaid had no impacts and didn‚Äôt have shotgun, bandit had no nitro, and lesion had no impacts? Wtf
---
Would get it if it was less money.  I've never paid for something on a game before and I'm having a hard time justifying it.
---
Wait , that‚Äôs illegal
---
Well crouch spamming and lean spamming with a controller isn‚Äôt cheating, it‚Äôs just taking advantage of broken game mechanics. To say that everyone you‚Äôve encountered doing it is using m/k is probably not 100% true as there are some really good plats with scuff controllers. However, from my experience most Diamond players are carried or use m/k on console at least.
---
I was just thinking " shoot the gun" the whole time, but yeah I was worse when I started so congrats!
---
only thing i would like to see is an increase to the extra percentage for alpha packs, its basicly non existent

But that's still pretty good for recruit, like, smoke grenades and frag grenades is kinda op

Such a wholesome police force. It kinda makes you forget that they are killing terrorists day in, day out. And one of them is a maniac with pockets full of bear traps.

I'm not trying to say that console players are dumbasses. I think that the input method for shooters on consoles is generally really clunky and unresponsive.
---
I think it would have been funny if the stim shot missed, then Jager yelled "CYKA BLYAT!" in a loud young russian voice and then DC'ed. 
---
Which is in Quebec...
---
Ash exaggerates the skill of her user. She is considered a fragger, and killing an opponent without much effort is currently one of the most powerful things in the game. 
---
Also, her pickrate is a problem on its own. 
---
Maybe in year 5 they will make a Monaco operation with a casino map. Except China won‚Äôt be allowed to have the map at all but who fuckin cares
---
Yep not sure why people think native m/k support will somehow fix the m/k adapter users.

I don‚Äôt play casual as often but I know this has been around before Wind bastion, maybe it looked different but you could always see where you spawn in casual when drones are gone

It isn't anything against the players personally but when their connects are worse than Dixie Cups and string, I don't want to play online with them.

I don't remember if it was BF or Warhawk on the PS3, the devs were working with people directly on connection issues. They asked players to provide speed tests and they were getting screen shots of Brazillian players that were literally showing dial up speeds! The Devs response was, you are required to have broadband to play, Brazilians responded saying that was broadband!  
---
I‚Äôm commenting just because I‚Äôd also like to know 
---
At first you like, ‚Äúwtf hacks bro!‚Äù Then you watch the replay and you‚Äôre like, ‚Äúhuh.‚Äù Then you just be kinda salty that never happens when you shoot drones!
---
Depends on a few things.. 
---
Are you running the game with a G-Sync/Freesync monitor? On what resolution are you planning to play? Are there games besides Siege you are planning to play and do you care more about high quality or high performance? 
---
I played the beta and bought the game day one, from what I recall you were given enough money for two operators at the start. Or at least after you completed training or something.
---

You were lucky it wasn't a double-soft wall, because in that case it wouldn't work with the planks in between 
---
Think or know?
---
Alright, I'm no expert and this may be wrong but from what I understand, Server response time is the time it takes for the server to register something, such as Hits, you hitting a barricade, a nade exploding. Your monitor, however, is the time it takes for the image your PC is displaying to transfer to your monitor. So no, it does not stack since the server time is pretty much how quick something registers in game, ie: A 200ms connection will take longer for a 5ms connection to register a headshot on someone.

The fact he has a very low pick rate in pro league just invalidates your post by default

It shouldn‚Äôt be sarcasm. Really, don‚Äôt get spawnpeeked. It‚Äôs extremely obvious to see who is roaming and who is going to potentially spawnpeek. And certain spawn points are safer than others and certain spawn points have very limited ways to spawnpeek. As for OP getting run out on, probably droning way too much because he thinks he is protected by a claymore.

What kind of discrimination against Internetians is this?

Why did you take the battlefield 1 trailer audio, instead of just the actual song?

There are the GO4R6 Tournaments, idk if they still do that, and there are game battles.

so you can advertise patreons here now?

Sounds more like an old person who still uses facebook and impact font.
---
Then there should be team ranks that stay with your team but there isn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt work because you could play with different teams each time so if there are gonna have a rank that represents YOU then they should make it actually show how you play and now just how many games you win.

It‚Äôs an old r6 meme of confusing buck and frost

Just amazing

same dude
---
Spy:what the hell is that!
---
Ok so I might have spoken out of context. I meant to say, the hammer does not go back far enough.. not the slide (which apparently seems to be the issue).  
---
Source: I've got a 92FS Inox, PT92 and a pair of Hi-Powers (Inglis 1951 and Mauser DA90 1991). At least in my case (and I consider myself having large hands), when I apply that motion, the hammer does not go far enough to bite with either 92... but the 91 Hi-Power actually catches on my skin. The Inglis does not do that because it has a chamfered hammer.
---
r/unexpectedsabaton? 
---
It's to give context on me as a player and supporter of siege. It's been my primary game since skull rain, and I have loved it greatly up until chimera. 
---
Yeah, this pretty much sums it up.
---
I‚Äôve got no problem forking over cash to straight buy an item, I‚Äôve spent easily over 150 on r6 (not counting the initial buy cost) my only issue is buying something with a *chance* to get what I want. 
---
I still support straight up purchases, but I will never buy ubi‚Äôs payed packs 
---
Well then. Color me stupid, I've never heard of that meme.
---
These prices are so hard to justify buying, honestly. Something that can be infinitely replicated, that holds no real monetary value and is priced so unreasonably high without ever getting discounted continues to confuse the shit out of me. It‚Äôs like Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt care really sees the siege community as whales. 
---
He‚Äôs using a macro I think lol 
---
Maestro tho
---
This is a 5 man just btw. But I tk'd because my friend was blocking me, then our friend, the Maestro, returned the favor then ended up getting an ace.
---
‚Äûnossa senora‚Äú but you only pronounced the first two letters?
---
A decent one that may help echo or maestro sometimes is bandit/kaid so you can hear him scream if he bumps into it. You just gotta pay attention
---
Oh and to finish this thought. My experience specifically I was at the point defending it from 4 attackers. I even won the round. They kept trying to kick me every round((the one I clutched and all following it )). Though some people have answered this question and I‚Äôm greatful to them. 
---
Oh wow you made your group of friends change there names then decided to take a blurry ass photo of it 
---
So many of these clips from console... does nobody use a headset?
---
For a moment there I went back to the picture to check.
---
Saw Buck's gadget. Thought pretty low of myself.
---
Just spawn in better locations, and peak slowly, one window at a time. Minimize your risk, don‚Äôt run, and prefiere every single window you see.
---
You‚Äôll have to buy it again
---
Good job üëç
---
ssa senhora
---
Thoes were not my friends they were some random players that were cheating...
---
Irrelevant, I know what OP wrote is kinda messy and hard to understand but his friend never said he cheats for that.
---
I'm not trying to kick people, just make them move 
---
I‚Äôm fine with that but how do I go about that ? If I already own the game 
---
As others said it‚Äôs only available on weekends, but hopefully they will announce it being the new ranked mode starting in year 4 at the invitationals.
---
When you almost get that ace
---
Cheating on what platform?
---
Theoretically it should be everyone but, it does set you to your skill limit a slight bit. I.e if your ranked, or by level I think.
---
Got a kill by shooting randomly into somewhere you cant see clearly?  lol, happens quite frequently for me :P
---
For me I seen a grenade and knew that was a dead giveaway. Lol

I don‚Äôt think you understand how keyboard and mouse on console works, at least on Xbox.

---
Well there‚Äôs plenty of people using MNK on console and it doesn‚Äôt seem bad for them
---
Not it‚Äôs actually pretty damn good. It‚Äôs not pc, but it‚Äôs easy af to use.
---
All I'm saying is OP trying to blame "bad" players for Cav's nonexistent nerf is wrong. Yeah she can down people from further away but you also need to know handle some extra recoil. Seems like a relatively fair trade off. This I think was to make her less effective at closer ranges. 
---
Nice, and I didn‚Äôt think anything good could pair with that headgear at all
---
Did you just get enough renown to buy a new op? That might be it.
---
I have really enjoyed holding that room and taking out people in the garage. Never got a kill that easy tho
---
Just wait. Do something else whilst waiting
---
Still, probably VERY similar.

im just gonna play devils advocate and hope you are just baiting

Unless they changed it I'm pretty sure you have exactly enough time to kill them before they finish the plant. They could have changed it but I remember watching a Rogue 9 video when maestro came out showing it. You need to start shooting the second they trying to plant. It's definitely harder and less effective than an echo stun but it's possible (unless they nerfed the rate of fire at some point since) 
---
Wtf fov is that
---
Theyre probably gonna do what CSGO uses. It‚Äôs basically crouch fatigue. You stay in aim but its harder to aim and you are less accurate while transitioning between standing and crouching. Also transitioning between crouching becomes slower the longer you do it in quick succession, until you no longer can crouch for a couple seconds.
---
Yeah a bit

As a controller player were not allowed to have a dialogue with you mnk'ers on this sub reddit because threads get deliberately derailed/ flooded with totally incorrect information
---
The fact is ubisoft have never ever ever ever ever ever said mnk on console is cheating u/IzYzY3 its people on this sub reddit that spread lies , i asked ubisoft they gave me no answer, ppl on here who i suspect are financialy incentivised to tell lies about this subject for 3 years and countingg they gett away with spreadingg a false narrative of mnk on console
---
They cant find a single piece of evidence that ubisoft have ever said its ''cheating'' not 1 shred off evidence for 3 years!!!!!
---
If most people avoid ranked then this surely wouldn't matter if it became the ranked ruleset? That's quite the flawed logic there. 
---
&gt;‚ÄúBut it is a problem‚Äù 
---
Its not, youre not finding people with KbM thats extremely rare. You keep saying ‚ÄúI can tell by their aim‚Äù when thats not the tell. You can achieve that same accuracy and speed with 100 hor and vert sens and 15 ads sens. Its how they actually move that gives them away. Wasd doesn‚Äôt cleanly translate onto a analog stick. Giving them no slow walk. 
---

That reply is the dumbest reply I've seen in a while. Please don't use reddit.
---
 the mute button on yourself is useless. Why not use that.
---
Exactly. The morons in here defending it is ridiculous. And that one dude asking how it‚Äôs a problem baffles me it‚Äôs a big time advantage and some people are so damn good with it that they can fight out of any situation.
---
I wish the Rogue 9 video had tested this properly so people would stop saying this. Merely spamming the regular default "toggle" version of crouch is not particularly glitchy, but spamming the "hold" version seems to cause some fuckery when latency is involved. The real problems happen when you have a player rapidly changing their crouch state faster than the amount of time it takes for their input to reach the server and be replicated to the other players. Due to how network prediction tends to work in multiplayer games this can lead to the client seeing that the player is crouching or uncrouching and predicting a resulting position for the hitboxes that doesn't align with the actual game state. This is why you will sometimes see people saying that the crouch spam causes the hit registration to fail and shots to "warp" through opponents, etc. It's because the client predicted that the player would end up in either the crouched or standing state, the prediction was wrong, and the shots don't land because the other player isn't actually where they appeared to be.
---
I am a game engine programmer and have written networking code myself. It's a difficult problem to solve and the easiest way to fix it without screwing up the rest of the game is probably going to be to rate limit crouching like CS:GO does.
---
Wrong sub. It should be r/forhonor

As much as it is funny it violates the rule.
---
So there is no purchasing operators? I just want to take advantage of any sales if there is that option. I dont mind the grind otherwise
---
The gold edition comes with all the ops unlocked and seasons pass if you don‚Äôt want the grind for the operators yourself. Other than premium outfits/camos the only other things to buy are the operators and seasons pass(s). Everything else like new maps and content is all free. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that all the DLC ops you can buy are all purchasable using in game renown (the currency) and can you can just grind them out.
---
So the answer is no, unless you want all these things handed to you the second you open the game instead of you working for them 
---
I would however go for the seasons pass if you end up liking the game and don‚Äôt buy the gold edition. You get early access to the new operators and you get renown bonus + sales in the store with it
---
You're being destroyed with cold facts, and it upsets you 
---
The current ranked map pool has pushed enough people to the edge, but not over it. Take away more maps and modes and it will drive more people to casual...
---
I would rather deal with the doc glitch with infinite stims. Lol
---
I don‚Äôt play iq much but I‚Äôd say unless it‚Äôs a denial device like bandit batteries or mute jammers just use her gadget as a info gather for where other ops gadgets are. Their is the times where you can catch a pulse or vigil and get them through a wall but that not going to happen much.

---
When I play IQ I almost always go to a different floor. She‚Äôs used best when she isn‚Äôt running around in dangerous areas like around the objective while looking for gadgets. I like to go above objective (or below) and use my scanner to see them through the floor and I shoot them out with a silenced pistol. Then when it‚Äôs time for my team to push the objective, they don‚Äôt have to worry about all these traps or gadgets because I‚Äôve destroyed them. 
---
I use the silencer so they don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm shooting up through the floor (no tracers or indicators) and it helps me stay hidden longer while I shoot out the gadgets.
---
If you don‚Äôt use a silencer it‚Äôll be much easier to take you out or have enemies know you are there
---
Alright let me rephrase it then when I mean by aim. Their sensitivity is WAY TOO FAST for a controller. The reason I mention aim is because MNK is much more precise than a controller with thumbsticks. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have an advantage sometimes because they can zip to a players head pretty damn easily. The keyboard isn‚Äôt really that big of an issue, I‚Äôve watched PC siege players rush on in and handle their movement pretty easily because they‚Äôve had practice. So are these players who use MNK on console.
---
I think it‚Äôd be OP

Tbh i was always a huge rainbow six fan played the hell out of vegas 1 and 2 so siege when it was annnounced was a must have, i bought it when it came out and i didnt know what i got myself into i played maybe 3 matches then i gave up on it played terrorist hunt a bit but with no story to it and multiplayer being something i wasnt used too i gave up on it. Fast forward a couple yrs its the beginning of yr 3 and all my friends have been obsessed with the game for a while now they have been grinding buying operators and all that ,
---
So i decide ill give it a second shot and just like i remembered im absolute garbage i gotta get carried i got to hold my own with the original operators while everyone elsr gots the cool operators, but my friends love the game so i stick with it. I was mainly using kapkhan i thought if i wasnt good enough at gunfights at least ill take some out with traps, and thats where it started.

Now im 10 operators in and still grinding i manage to get mvp here and there, my friends who used to carry now became my backpack and whats best is now i got my little brother the main one i used to play vegas with and try out all the glitches and cheats. He just starting so hes basically going through hell like i was but i see hes starting to enjoy it just last week he got his first ace and i can tell he was proud of that.
---
The best part is that Ubisoft can't actually do anything about it. 
---
I don't play iq but i mained pulse. For birth charterers, you need immense amount of map knowledge. Iq should be used with mic to let your team know what kind of gadgets are in the next room. You should always switch out of your gadgets when you are not with your team. If you are alone, scan nearby with your device then switch to primary. Make sure you are hidden while scanning and use primary when moving.
---
For destroying enemy devices, know which areas you need to be in order to destroy enemy devices from above and below. Make sure to ask for backup while doing so or you are a very easy target. All in all, iq is a very team oriented so you should be using it with a team.
---
I mean I don‚Äôt think it has the best fire rate, right? Elaborate.
---
Yep and it‚Äôs actually been a problem since 2017. It‚Äôs gotten worse overtime
---
There are, the mute yourself button that you can't use.

*bandito burritos thermito*

You can get up close and personal, do the little shield rotation and then slap them with a shotgun
---
The more you play IQ the more thicc she gets
---
Didn't say anything about stats, it's obvious more people play casual and more prefer content. Forget about this sub where most people would prefer to play bomb on 2 maps and never get any more operators or maps. Here's a good video about what the real playerbase wants, not the reddit super tryhard 1%.

how do you get the black crosshair

Is this an actual concept or satire cause I cant tell

Good idea, banned in china
---
Probably so.

Do you have a youtube channel or something? Looking forward to more quality content.

Banned i dunno, but ddos? Most likely

This game is so fucking broken thanks to this. Otherwise a great game. 
---
Well with the longer plant times in SI its a little easier to down someone with maestro. 
---
My mic doesn‚Äôt have a mute button.

My crosshair is not black it just looks weird because of the quality of the video and the contrasting colours behind it

Well I couldn't see the macro in use so I wasn't able to decide on my own. I've never seen someone use macros in game before but I know what you mean

You can buy operators with money if you want to speed things up, but you can unlock every single character, gun, and attachment without shelling out a single buck. It‚Äôll take a while but be very rewarding.

 I truelly don't know why they nerfed them i haven't heard a single complaint about those guns in the 3years that i play this game, that being said, The nerf does not matter tbh.. you allways go for headshots with that mp5 and acog. It's still a very good gun.

How do i get a sweet tag next to my name, showing the operators emoji and my main?

while we're at it for console improvements, lets see an improvement in reporting players. some message or some reassurance that report player for toxic behavior button works.  Maybe provide a unique message ID in the form of a receipt showing the message has been submitted to the ubisoft support team (if in fact that's what's happening)

Go to the Ubisoft store. Major discount on it compared to Steam till the 11th I think?

 Try 20 Armor,  headshot no longer one shot him.

Sure, but now she's finally, finally tamed the sun.

That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. By your own definition, nobody should be able to prone, crouch, or lean because it moves where you have to shoot for a headshot.

Well at least its only a cas

Wouldn't removing the "hold" option and only allowing to toggle also fix this?

Sorry.... but now you can gnome your friends.

1) I hate saying it buuuut... it‚Äôs casual. Ya, it sucks but at least it‚Äôs not the biggest investment. 
---
2) So you were part of the initial TK conspiracy or the Cav thought you were?
---
3) Probably an unpopular opinion but I think TKing is dealt with just fine. Hell, if you‚Äôve got some dickish teammates you can usually just bait them into TKing multiple times and get kicked and banned. Which, for me, is a better feeling than winning.

Cav is the worst with this. When she activates her silent step, she slav squats, but her perspective doesn‚Äôt change. Get flanked made a video about it.
---
Sorry if my explanation was convoluted, but yeah I stated that there would only be 5 uses of the ammo bag, and then I offered two potential methods of how the AP rounds could work. Either as a buff that lasts for an entire round or just for the equivalent of two magazines if the prior option is too strong. I don't know about the bag refilling equipment as well, but that is a potential option.

Nah not stamina just a delay

Happens with some frequency. And the opposite as well (choked defeat). Go figure :)

Nice, though that Sledge should have got you if he knew where you were.

I really hope they fix it, only if they gave it with other fixes some priority or at least a sign that they ARE working on fixes

How it surely kills you more as they can judge where you are aiming

No because, starter edition is fine.

No more bandit tricking...due to the fact that he can‚Äôt bend over.

It‚Äôs obviously Pulse not blitz

The Last Stand is used in a lot of crusade memes despite the fact that the song has nothing to do with the crusades.

Bro, i know the story of the Swiss Guard, the brave army of the Pope and the attack to Rome.

The song tells about how the Swiss guard didn't gave a second thought on protecting what mattered to them. That's exactly what the Crusaders used to do, protect what mattered to them no matter the costs.
---
Sorry but why dont they just say no none of dis and put a input block on?

I never said I use it I just have one lmao people mad.

It's pretty new mouse and this is the only game that does that.

Those settings are toggled off in Pro League. So they turn them off outside of PL to have consistency.

---
One of the reasons behind my idea to make the LMG his primary is to give him mobility. The turret is why he's such an underwhelming operator. He has to remain stationary to use his ability, which is a detriment in a fast paced game like Siege, and I really don't think any modifications to his turret would fix him. His equipment can still be deployable shield or barb wire, and he could use those to fullfil the same role he has now, but with the LMG as his primary he has the freedom to change position granting him better odds. Then the ammo bag comes in to give his ammo count a boost.

Good advice, next time lead with that because it looked like you were hateing just to be hateing.
---
As iv stated, until now i had no way of editing my videos. Just now figured out a process to make my videos actual videos and not what looks like "livestream after broadcasts". Im still technically new to this and as far as a first fully edited video goes (not counting spiderman because it does not have an intro or outro) im pretty proud of this video. I did change the tital to "compilation" because i feel like its closer to that than a montage.
---
nice gaming airpods ü§î
---
Rule 9
---
Could be a counter to blitz. Halberd beats running shield guy
---
I don't see what you're complaining about. You're a good player stuck in low gold for the rest of the season, I'd pay to have that luxury (not really, but it'd be nice).
---
Kaid and Bandit aren‚Äôt counters in any way.
---
Sorry about the quality it was the best pics I could find with the prices included! 
---
He isn‚Äôt really op, his torch can easily be heard if you have good headphones with your volume turned up if you‚Äôre anchoring. Also, he does need counters, currently doesn‚Äôt have any hard counters.
---
Is this really a console only issue? I've been playing on it since Velvet Shell and only noticed just how bad these sound issues were after Grim Sky. I had assumed they were a problem on PC as well, but if they aren't that's another super good reason to switch to PC.
---
No logic on my end but I think R6S should have a free starter edition / demo similar to the Division
---
I think when he meant soft counter he meant like when mav leans on the wall it will damage him

üòÇ Thanks!

It'd cut into profits.
---
I was expecting to see more echo mains 
---
I knew someone would say it!
---
For the emperor?
---
Well, I never hear the sound issues in any videos from PC players. Nobody from PC ever complains about it. Reasonable to assume it's a console only problem. 
---
I know. I got it twice. 
---
Trying not to :( It‚Äôs hard when I know what‚Äôs inside the cake.
---
We ended up winning but boy was I sad.
---
Kinda scummy in my opinion that they took this option away just for profit but at the end of the day they are a business and it makes sense 
---
I'm not sure the audio would be processed the same way through YouTube, but I suppose you are right that I've never really seemed to notice any of those issues in videos. 
---
the only acknowledged it because enough people complained. i personally think it‚Äôs not really an issue, people are just looking for an excuse on why they died. it could never be because they were better than you or you made a mistake right?
---
I once had both of my offensive mains banned. Needless to say, I did not stick around.
---
Overall I find your idea absolutely great except for one thing. I really don't think they should add AP ammo as armor is already a big disadvantage on attack. Ubi has been trying to balance this for years. Ever wonder why 3 speeds are always to top of the pick- and winrate lists while for example Fuze is in the bottom even with his insanely powerful kit of AK12, PMM, smokes etc.)? - Yeah, armor is still very problematic on attack and I really doubt they'd nerf it even more. I also don't think they really want to mess with weapon damages too much as this could totally break the balance in some instances. 
---
So maybe like FMJ ammo would work better? It could have a very slightly higher damage against all armor classes, but also significantly higher destructive- and penetration capabilities (no more need for shotguns to break walls as you could destroy walls, even hatches by emptying a fmj loaded rifle/smg mag into it). Or something along these lines. This could really bring change to how we play the game!
---
But other than this, I like your idea a lot! If done correctly this would really be a rather simple concept/rework to make Tachanka finally viable and have a place in R6 roster. So i'm very much down for this! 
---
It absolutely would take whatever audio is being played and record it. Recording software just captures what  does happen, it doesn't take what *should* be happening. 
---
Bandit thicc
---
2 defenders?
---
See I find crouch spamming takes no skill and it's stupid how people need that to win
---
I mean, that really isn‚Äôt a counter, by that logic Bandit and Kaid are counters to every op, due to anyone touching their electrified wall taking damage.
---
r/chonkers
---
Song?
---
She wanted the money shot
---
Fucking drove you didn‚Äôt see anything 
---
If you electrify a reinforced wall.
---
Yeah happened to me yesterday and is still there today. If Ubisoft is aware of it they'll look into it. Maybe hit them up on Twitter?
