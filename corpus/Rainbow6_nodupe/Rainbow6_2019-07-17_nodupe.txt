It‚Äôs not something I plan on doing ever, put too much time into collecting seasonal skins to throw it all away. Like I still have the Rudolph skin haha.
---

---
It just makes me sad that legitimate players decide to cheat and risk throwing all that away. Those are the types of cheaters that bite off more than they can chew, thinking they‚Äôll be fine. Right after battleye hits them with a ban and they lose their Year 1 skins to the abyss. 
---
If for whatever reason you decide to cheat, don‚Äôt. Siege is a game that IMO allows so much opportunity for cheat inspired behavior like using drones to setup wallbangs, that it‚Äôs infinitely more satisfying to setup you‚Äôre own blind wallhacks just using your intel gathering alone. I used to joke on or around launch day that everyone had wallhacks because you can just find out where someone was without them knowing by just using the intern tools.
---
If I might add, another way to reduce hacking might to be offer an arcade feature to reduce the likelyhood a percentage of players will turn to hacks when they‚Äôre stressed out, not having fun, loosing game and game, and generally not doing well. If they have a breather and something to remind them how to have fun, they might toss the hacks altogether.
---
Yes.
---
Same here, contemplated grinding to Diamond, but this season was stressful enough getting into Plat'; one of the rockiest I've played yet.
---
That should have been fixed with this patch as well.
---
Google.  Google has a picture of the FMG-9 black ice...
---
[removed]
---
Only top floor isn‚Äôt. Easy fix
---
Yes that would be lovely.
---
Third floor is pretty much unattackable. Everything relies either on stairs or very tight windows/doors where pixel angels can be held easily.
---
so you dont think vault is as close to a free win for defenders that you can get?
---
Like I said already I dont use slurs for the most part but I dont get offended when people say them to me
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Really, grow up
---
Here, here.
---
yikes
---
Yay :)
---
I guess Ubi saw what their designers had made and realised they looked really good so more people would buy them.
---
TLDR giving more packs means those buying the whole set would see less value was what Ubi's marketing thought.
---
Whatever happened to those cosmetics from previous events anyway? I hardly see other players equip them.
---
"I wont hold that angle, someone else probably will"
---
Tachanka
---
I'm sorry if that is what you thought and that wasn't my intention.
---
When I said I don't care about your opinion of the skin, I meant "I don't care about your opinion on the appearance of the skin"
---
Fortress
---
Always leave on in the mag, for lmgs then lol
---
It is now
---
Oooh and your on console looks like that cheater gets off free
---
Bottom tier map
---
thats great, thx
---
Until it's your turn to play Maverick, then it's a ball.
---
At least your teammate did something. Too often these situations have one player on 20 kills and another on 2.
---
Maestro is great for zapping people.
---
I mean, you can take twitch drones with Mozzie so yeah.
---
I really hate these comparisons why would anyone buy ALL of the cosmetics at once? Do you have that little self-control? They're priced high yes....but they're not priced so that any sane person would buy them ALL. I can pick up one mcdouble even though McDonald's is willing to sell me a hundred. It would be nice if you could buy specific items though I agree with that but they really don't make too many really nice skins. You would have everyone running around with black ice and they would make 1/20th the money they're making now.
---
Geniunely curious, you don't like rolling your Ranked charms on your primaries? 
---
I generally do and a themed one for the secondary if allotted or certain characters I have a theme going on for their primary, but mainly I always put my most recent Rank on at the beginning of a Season.
---
Really? They look like they are chilling out at their vacation when their super secret Rainbow transponders were activated so they came from the Swiss alps. Just like IQ rushed over from her Yoga class.
---

rip good hereford, i will forever miss you!!
---
Maestro for the zapping people.
---
Mozzie and Echo for droning.
---
Villa is my favorite map. I can understand not liking it but to say Bartlett is better is just... no.
---
when i feel nosalgic, i go to the first situation
---
I apologise for the initial downvote. I instinctively tried to as soon as I read his message.
---
Honestly it was worse in games like runescape where to report someone you had to type their name in at least with siege you can report from the scoreboard
---
Damnüëå
---
WAFFLE CONE.
---
I think a GRU ctu would be awesome, maybe that could have a vss?
---
He gets banned quite often. But most tines it is Echo and Caviera.
---
Did we get the skin anyway? I don't have any operators with that gun
---
Thank you! I haven't really been playing at all because its been ruining my experience TREMENDOUSLY.
---
It's pretty rediculose. You can place into diamond amd only be facing gold 3-4's lol. Like one of my buddy's recently started playing and hit level 30 last night. Got boosted up to plat 1. His placement match was against a team of silvets and he got 0 kills lol. Going to be a diamond after 3 more easy games. Literally a brand new player boosted by a plat 4 stack of coppers. It's broken... But it was fun seeing just how broken.
---
/Unexpected
---
Honestly instead of automatically selling your duplicates, Ubi should do something similar to Cs:Go. If they don't want that then why not a trading system between skins instead of money like CS?
---
No one noticed the mirror

Its literally in the image in the bottom left

And a Mavericks wet one
---
Sorry to hear man; high Ranked matches have gotten so botched this season between carries, glitches, DDOS, etc. that I just gave up once I hit Plat' and taking my break until next Season.
---
Ah, but it is good
---
i hate you. unless you like the old one. if you do, PREACH. if not, i will hunt you down
---
Realism. The M1911, in real life, also hold only seven bullets.
---
Alright. Basically what I‚Äôm trying to say is I think the challenge is unreasonable and maybe should be brought down another million and they should‚Äôve released it with the mode and I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. I never use the BOSG anyway. It would be worth it if it was a universal weapon skin.
---
It used to be hype, but now it's quit on spot
---
Never
---
Haha indeed, I still quite like it though
---
who gilded this?
---
Ok. YOU don't get offended. You aren't everyone in the siege community. People don't want to be insulted every game they play. The siege community was asking for chat filters for a long time and they did it. You're so stuck in your childish selfish thinking that you can't see past your own emotions. Seems you really need to grow up if you ask me.
---
Why your last?
---
what‚Äôs the skin for the MPX?
---
Well I got insta permabanned back in 2018 for my first ban sooo (apparently I said some bad shit in chat which is plausible)
---
what unholy heresy is this
---
They should add knives like in csgo

That's amazing bro!

---
Thx Ubi, add the unbeatable challenge when a dope skins on the line
---
I know this is supposed to be a joke but it's not funny
---
You sound mad that people are better than you. How about you learn from your mistakes against them? Im in that "little rank" and hear about this from lower ranks all the time. We're allowed to play casuals all we want, if were solo queing or trying out new strats, why would we go play ranked and potentially lose our rank instead of practicing? Go play ranked if thats the case. And while we're talking about ranked, stop blaming others for your own failures and deaths.
---
Coastline too many lines of sight for the offensive teams
---
The Monty sucks and was playing way too passive to be in a 1v1 with a clash
---
Idk maybe get gud skrub?
---
...lol jk that sucks
---
Ur just a bad player
---
I completely understand! I hate the roamers who spawn in and immediately run off without reinforcing, grabbing Rook armour, placing gadgets, etc. Don't get me wrong, I love roamers, but the least they can do is reinforce...
---
Thatcher vs sledge sparing match
---
Did I just watch*
---
Monty too many weaknesses? 
---
What?
---
Bro I‚Äôm in copper 4 (don‚Äôt ask why) and people play better than that
---
Ok, good idea, I'm gonna see what other people say?
---
&gt; If you‚Äôre getting tracked you know someone is pushing you vert aggressively, 
---
No they are not, unless this is one casual sliver strat where you see a ping and start sprinting towards it. 
---
&gt;make your anchors get hatches and he wastes his ability at least once
---
The hatches arent the main issue, its the roamers not being able to roam without getting their location given out without them being able to counter it. 
---
&gt;Its not worse than Twitch taking away all of your team‚Äôs utilites/black mirror
---
You can counter twitch electric barb(kaid) or a well placed mozzie or a mute. Also you can physically see and shoot the twitch drone. 
---
Jackal can take out a bit of the floor and track you, or track you from a window or a the floor above you. He can also get the relative location of a defender without even using the tracking ability. 
---
&gt; Or Montange leading a team orientated push.
---
Again, has multiple counters like smoke, lesion, c4 and impacts. unlike jackal that doesnt have viable counters outside of cav.
---
XD did that with panoramic?
---
I also remember the time they implemented a system whereas if you wanted one specific cosmetic, you were forced to gamble for it.
---
"ThEy'Re JuSt CoSmEtIcS, nO oNe Is FoRcInG yOu To BuY tHeM!!!"
---
...which is why they create an event to market them, plaster the home menu with them, give you one free (which is probably to suck you in to buy more, c'mon people, this is the kinda shit casinos do.), create artificial scarcity to induce a sense of urgency and make them appear more rare than they actually are, and constantly remind you that they exist and won't be here for long in the notification center.
---
Yeah, they may not be "forcing" you, but they are definitely nudging you...ever so gently, towards buying them every. Single. Time. You log on.
---
The whole system is predatory (and works), and unfortunately there's no precedent for it since it is relatively new.

Oh but when I posted this 2 weeks ago it dies in new

I love the map. Why? idk
---
Ok big brain
---
*most people on any platform play casual the most* "dude why are all these clips casual. Go 20-0 on ranked and then I'll be impressed. All these casuals. GAWWWWDDDD"
---
Only point I'll argue is the unrealistic on the premise that we would run out of ideas and options real fast. Full onboard with the defuser though
---
I have seen other players get their mmr back if other team is using booster or smurfs on this subreddit.
---
FINALLY players that are brave enough to ban Tachanka
---
Pulse is dope too
---
He does but mostly for uncoordinated teams
---
I just want my shield boys to work consistently. Been a monty main since the start and it hurts me when the game just decides he shouldn't work as intended.
---
Hereford is Ubi‚Äôs big stinker, the Prior Clubhouse and Consulate Reworks were good and this new Kafe is A+
---
8th of November not 8th November
---
&gt; It‚Äôs more level based than anything.
---
Levels are not part of any matchmaking in r6s. its there just to limit new players from playing rank.
---
*posh voice* Owh! The horror!
---
Hott
---
I‚Äôm sorry how is warden SLIGHTLY underpowered
---
It's casuals not ranked, what do you expect?
---
Absolutely on point
---
Map is good, except 3rd floor. Fck 3rd floor.
---
Who said anything about going 20-0? Seems like someone got hurt... and how is that statistic taken lmao? Does it count how many people play ranked and how many people play casual lmao... if thats the case everyone that plays ranked plays casual as a warmup, so very dumb statistic if true
---

---
They should honestly make guu mines more visable
---
i wish they didnt change the styling and just changed how the map played (like they did with kafe)
---
I don't see why you think Aussies are getting discriminated against, the pricing was about the same for everyone.
---
Why are these events only out for 2 weeks at a time? I fucking love 3v3. 3v3 elimination OW was my shit but I havent played OW in months. I was too busy to play Showdown as much as I would have liked to, and now it's gone. Like what the fuck. I had so much fun in showdown.
---
Mp7 for damage or MP5SD for range. 
---
Nokk is the only Attacker who has no range AND damage benefit over Defenders other than the shield OP‚Äôs.
---
Some casual fun, not hard mode.
---
Any loss or gain goes away. It's not that you "lost" MMR. Those game(s) just don't count. It doesn't matter who's team the cheater was on.

As vigil I walked into 4 players sitting on the bottom of the main staircase in Chalet. I got 2 and knocked one (They were surprised) before dying, and my teammates who were on obj (garage) didn‚Äôt even go finish them.
---
Nice. I‚Äôve gotten plat the last three seasons in a row after only ever being gold for 2 years. Feels good
---
I feel like this should just be a whole other game
---
I think you need to lower your resolution a bit, I can almost make out what's going on.
---
*sigh* it was sarcastic. And the most played game mode is obviously casual, be it for warmup or otherwise. It's an obvious statistic. Competitive play is always the minority game mode within any game with a ranked mode. I didn't think you were this dense but I was wrong, evidently
---

You‚Äôre not worthy.

I found this clip from 2 years ago sorry for the quality
---
The neutral tier is made for operators both slightly op and up. Warden actually has a few more strengths than weaknesses in my opinion. A great shotgun that feels great to use, great and unique kit, and a decent secondary.
---
Lamest comment I've ever seen plz don't comment again
---
4 US ops...doesn‚Äôt sound lacking at all.
---
If you lose...you lose a rank. If you win...you get 2 points.
---
Now I really want to say whoosh but hate people who do it so...
---
Happened to me. Have only had the game for awhile and it confused the hell out of me.
---
RE RE RE REPOSTU
---
So it's not just me?
---
Thanks bro ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Well I mean you used finka shotgun. Did you expect anything other than a hose of death?
---
i mean it‚Äôs pretty close.. it‚Äôs got the stabilizer behind it and everything
---
Came up against soooooooo many guys who stress the servers this season (a lot were the game for my plat 1) and i have contacted support so fucking much with no roll back. Completely put me off the game.
---
At least I have some insight into the people of Quebec now
---
That one random
---
&gt; a Twitch can put a big hole in a team's defense.
---
Thats like saying bandit is useless cause attackers can have a thatcher. Mira can easily not place the mira's at prep, combo with a mute, mozzie or a barbwire/shield combo with electricity to deal with twitch drones. 
---
&gt;One too many times I find myself falling back cause his LMG or AR isnt getting the job done.
---
Cause thats how you balance operators. Really good equipment operators like cap, valk, Hibana, Dokk gets sub par weapons in either low RPM, low mag size or high Recoil in order to compensate for the good utility they being to the match. 
---
Fuze and Vigil has some of the best weapons on attack and defense. Its their kits/equipment thats lacking compared to other operators. A vigil vs a mira or fuze vs cap, you are better off with the cap and mira for their utility. 
---
&gt;neutral tier.
---
Then why is thermite, Rook, Jager, sledge, twitch in that list.
---
Nah he saw the dude and aimed at him
---
R u guys smurfing because that‚Äôs pathetic, and it seems your try Harding too by the 3-0 scoreline
---
Sorry if your not just by looking at the players name I assume that your smurfing,
---
If it sells it‚Äôs not ridiculous. If it were cheaper an more available, then it would be common and not as desirable or special. So it could be a little cheaper, but from a financial standpoint it sells fairly well so they have no reason to change it.
---
inb4 hostage cosplay
---
Lol the music
---
I agree with you 100%, unfortunately I have left the game completely. It broke my heart, I‚Äôve always loved R6 and loved Siege, however the game isn‚Äôt tactical at all and is definitely an arcade shooter. RIP.
---
TKing is a completely different level of toxicity than just talking shit and being an annoying fuck. Unless they‚Äôre actively grinding you in the game and not just with their voice or chat TKing tends to just make everything worse.
---
They're outfits. They don't benefit you in anyway. Are you really that pissed that you can play dress up?
---
True, in rankeds there's also the fifth guy in the chain.
---
Relatively certain that isn‚Äôt a prefire spot, or the thatcher just doesn‚Äôt know the lineup because the doc was just randomly in the open, plus people shoot multiple bullets at a prefire spot not just one
---
How about no sights at all, not even irons.
---
You ever watch that movie Juno?   
---
Theres a scene in that movie that pretty well describes how I feel,  This old ladys talking about god or something and just says "God loves everyone, Except the mexicans"  
---
Thats me, But replace the mexicans with French Canadians,  I litterally mean it when I say that if you came to me with the option "Youll die but every Quebecois will cease to exist"  There would be 0 hesitation, Id be doing everyone a favor IMO.

I'm pretty sure that's just really lucky/unlucky. I'm pretty sure it's just random chance for which team gets attack or defend.

S4E10 (S5 is the last one), "The Cold War" \^\^
---
it‚Äôs sad it left it‚Äôs roots as a tactical shooter and just became an FPS with abilities. but that could be forgiven because it‚Äôs still kinda fun to play. but it‚Äôs not fun to play. it‚Äôs broken, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. the report button does nothing and the toxicity remains. but now there‚Äôs no way to defend yourself against it. you just have to take it. and god forbid you try and do anything about it because then ubisoft comes down on you for being toxic
---
So some related questions:
---
How would a better anti-cheat work?
---
Does an actually better anti-cheat exist?
---
Does combining two different anti-cheats solve anything?
---
Original Hereford good, new Hereford bad

Yea my match was thrown after the whole debacle of him killing my friend and me killing him as soon as it happened and then being followed by his friend. I've encountered so much toxicity since I started ranked last month and it's not exclusively from the other team either.
---
The random person is gonna kill your friend
---
Classic Ubisoft
---
Lmao his cheek guard is on backwards
---
Thats an ouchie
---
The SMG has really low recoil which is good for a player starting to get into r6s/have trouble with recoil but the issue is the really low rpm compared to other SMGs the defenders can use like T-5, 9x19, mp5 series etc.
---
The old one was a shitshow, but it was fun.
---
I hate the newer direction they have taken with maps.
---
Do you have a computer or no? If not then on ps4 there is an app for editing videos called ShareFactory, you can cut up footage, mix it all around, add intros, text, music, voiceover, transitions, everything pretty much
---
I don‚Äôt play the games most known for toxicity... I did play a lot of DOTA 2 though. I would say R6 siege was definitely very toxic in a few games.
---
I have: Doc,Rook,Smoke,Bandit and IQ,Ash,Glaz and fuze. And I don‚Äôt care that much only that they aren‚Äôt that expensive
---
How do you get this to happen? Normally I am the friend that gets shot for the sins of others. For once it would be nice for someone else to take the beating.
---
I have a laptop, and im on xbox
---
True but i think if you learn to tapfire, you can increase the RPM with no penalty to recoil.
---
its mostly a utility shotty similar to the Bailff, not really made for any range killing. 
---
Unless you are like 3ms from the defender, stick to the AR.
---
Or you can Trim the clip but you can only pick start/end points so you cant start it, cut out the middle, then add the end back to it. Not without other software anyways. Other than Sharefactory you'll want a capture card and a pc
---
I'm 50/50 on this. There are games where glitches are absolutely required and have actually been incorporated to the gameplay.
---
I do agree with the general sentiment that the player should not be held responsible for what the game rules allows them to do, since it is after all a game. It's a completely different matter of course if you require external tools for it.
---
Then again, in a game like siege, this very likely is not intentional. Still, I don't think players should be responsible for what the game allows them to do.
---
Ooo
---
Ah ok thank you
---
What. A castle in a baseball outfit? That's nothing to do with combat or their jobs like all the Elite Skin themes
---
All I wanted out of a Hereford rework was another internal staircase somewhere.
---
Hereford basement was one of my favorite sites in the entire game and I'm so sad it's completely different now.
---
On all platforms would be nice
---
I pretty sure even joking about that is considered a warcrime in the Geneva Convention.
---
It‚Äôs got the recoil pattern almost as bad as the Smg-12. After second shot it can go literally anywhere.
---
Saving this comment
---
On p.c it's a bit easier to control recoil, you just have to get used to it.
---
Whats your idea of good? 
---
The player that just rush in to get a kill every round without any teamplay? 
---
The players that only play operators that give you the most points like twitch, vigil or lesion ? 
---
How will the game know about people that play support operators like echo, valk, thermite and make call outs everyround but doesnt "do" much in getting kills.
---
I used to gut it out and play the match. About a year now if some memelord starts saying stupid shit immediately into the mic as soon as the match begins I just reque for my sanity.
---
My friend TK'd me once as doc because he's and idiot and can't tell the difference between his pistol and his stim pistol.
---
I‚Äôd recommend Jager or sledge. They were my first two ops that I unlocked and I still use them frequently. They both have strong weapons and useful gadgets.
---
Now I wouldn‚Äôt bitch if I didn‚Äôt have a solution. Either 
---
A. Make her gun a 2 round burst like Mira‚Äôs vector so people can actually utilize its non random 2nd shot recoil pattern,
---
OR 
---
B. Make it so that the third shot less horizontal recoil so that 3 round burst/ burst firing is feasable
---
I didn't want to spawn at that skylight on kafe, iirc blackbeard wasn't banned and we got smoked at the same spot previously and I said no lets do 2nd floor here, the round started and the jager/bandit, don't remember gunned down my friend with his pistol, like emptied the mag into him. My friend was like what the fuck dude I didn't even speak and he was just silent and I shot him, then his friend followed me around to run in front of my shots.

One time, person #1 teamkilled person #2 with no context. The next round, they #2 got their revenge on #1. #3 then killed #2 for team killing. Since #3 sided with the original instigator, I killed #3. Turns out they were memeing and they were on a discord call together. They tried to kick me but #5 had my back.
---
Then your 3rd friend who teamkills the toxic person next round, since none of you can do it because of Reverse TK
---
Pablito por que
---
Actually a skin like that dude would look pretty cool, byt hed have to be a 3 speed op and definitely not the armorer op
---
I think because, while these are annoying. Other bans would be SO much more useful.
---
you dont just queue casual by yourself man wtf. its dangerous out there
---
r/unexpectedLeagueOfLegends
---
I miss recruit... Sometimes it's nice to have barbwire and C4.
---
The vertical recoil is easy to control, and if you can control that the horizontal barely matters because the dps of the weapon is so high.
---
Ok, this is a lot more descriptive. You ninja edited, didn't ya?
---
See, the easiest solution to toxicity is to get a squad of friends. If I, an introvert, can do it, so can you.
---
As for being turned into a BR, one of the reasons BRs don't have FF is because people will have to cross fires to take on countless enemies. That's not the case in siege. Siege's format needs FF to make sure everything is controlled, else rushes will go out of control. And a dceent fuze with 1 IQ will launch all his pucks into the room when everybody runs in if you turn ff off to make it so that he guarantees you the win. If you turn ff off, then attack would have a 100% win rate because you take away the only thing stopping attacking from being victorious all the time.
---
Casual is a place for you to chill and make friends. So, make some. Believe me, 600 hours in, I've been TKd more than you have, but I've gotten past the bullsh*t to understand why we can't ever have FF off in siege.
---
Oh so you‚Äôre just a pedantic asshole. Got it.
---
I like blitz not, I feel like his ability is useless but his main ability of running while being covered is amazing but not impossible to deal with.
---
I play blitz alot and have never used the flash, I never see a chance for it to actually do anything when I could just melee them.
---
Nice
---
Playing since the dawn of Siege
---
Nah I used the red markers to guide me
---
They need to add the predictable recoil and I‚Äôll be happy. Because you‚Äôre right, her recoil doesn‚Äôt have a pattern really except how sporadic it is. And that‚Äôs annoying even though I don‚Äôt play her.
---
What‚Äôs the point of this? This is staged...
---
WTF till next year to fix a critical bug? But nah lets keep pumping out loot boxes
---
I play on PC, and the few times I do play her, I use angled and I can pull down just fine.

I don't know what weapons the IRA used but definitely not ak47s (or maybe so???)
---
and we do need an irish op that would be epic, but I don't know if we have any special military stuff.
---
Best show no cap
---
The IRA is seen as a terrorist organization to many agencies so this may not be an option.
---
Buck is solid, frost is ok-ish. I wouldn't comment since I don't play her much.
---
Not expect, just looking for excuses to blame others.
---
Huzzah a man of culture!
---
Less clutter, especially when you don't need it.
---
Lmao I don't play overwatch much anymore, but you're kidding yourself if you think that R6 is less toxic than overwatch. I played both with a couple of friends, one of which was a girl. One of the games I had to relay everything she said through discord to avoid it becoming an edgelord toxic shitshow. It definitely wasn't overwatch.
---
R6 players have been way more toxic in my experience, especially after the sportsmanship bonus thing happened in OW.

Damn he young!

I play with a friend who uses controller on pc so its a bit hard to rank up :3.

Wrong map, then.
---
Tower was designed with 0 vertical play, which is why the devs admitted their mess up and took it out of ranked.

Bad cosplay -- you don't have a potato face like valk

I legit thought this was from the game because every detail is so perfectly picturesque: the cosplay, image quality, the environment - I feel you've captured the essence of Fuze.

Am I the only one that can see there is a guard on both sides of the helmet?
---
I don't know why Ubisoft hasn't done that yet, but they probably never will.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. I was one shotting enemies from across rooms, both T-hunt and multiplayer
---
How do you expect to be believed when you have zero proof
---
Bees
---
Not with nokks shotgun you weren‚Äôt, the thing does potato dmg, especially at range
---
I had 2 blatant cheaters today. Obviously walling and it was just ridiculous. One guy killed the whole team just prefiring in like 15 seconds. The end round killcam was him just staring at a wall and then tap firing a smg11 once to get the final kill. They even admitted they were walling and to report them. Guy was diamond in every region and still hasn't been banned. Hope Ubi has another ban wave soon.
---
I have a UAG phone case, and I love it. Can recommend! :)
---
Maybe, and hang in there with me, maybe you‚Äôre just bad
---
It was definitely nokk. She is now my favorite op to run in T-hunt
---
Because people always ban the same operators. I know I sound like those snobby people that main cAveiRa and jAcKaL but like it just gets annoying when they are CONSTANTLY being banned. May as well just take out the operators in ranked. 
---
But that‚Äôs just my opinion :3
---
Have you tried moving your highlighted square elsewhere? i.e. don't leave it at the matchmaking square.
---
TLDR: next time you play, press R1 to move to operator tab after your game. Your X button may be broken and clicking by itself when left on the matchmaking tab.
---
Using PS4 parlance because that's where I play Siege, not sure what you call them in PC terms.
---
I have no idea how you were one tapping enemies from across the room then, this thing does zero dmg if you‚Äôre farther than a kiss distance away
---
And down into oblivion you go!
---
That scared the sh\*\* out of me when that happened. The day before I had spent like an hour to customize every weapon for every operator because I had clicked "equip all" to a universal skin... I thought I had to redo all of the skins AND the attachments... Luckily a restart of the game fixed it... I almost cried. xD
---
Not even close.
---
Did you put a laser on the shotgun?
---
I tried it with both laser and no laser
---
Idea: Make it so certain ranks can play people only one rank above, for example a copper 4 can play with up to a bronze 1 and gold 4 can play up to a plat 1.
---
Thank you! (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
---
I never felt any consistency with the gun, it felt more like it was luck rather than skill. Some people sniped me with it and sometimes I'd shoot confetti out of it from like 3ft away.
---
0.00223 is meant for people who play arm, the sens you just suggested are wrist
---
Jaeger. This is just me, but I don‚Äôt like how the doc skin kinda looks like shroud. Skeevs me out for some reason.
---
Thank you, my mouse wasnt on the new match square. My mouse isnt broken, it doesnt click by its self
---
Well recruit says otherwise
---
I‚Äôm currently testing her on t-hunt right now and from far away it takes half a clip (3 shots) to reliably kill a 1 armor, 2 shots up close
---
Does Bangalore and Thermite work? Both make big boom.
---
Gee willikers, you‚Äôre probably right!!
---
The sledgehammer provides very viable soft destruction. This allows for a quick and relatively quiet way (compared to breaching charges) into or near a lot of sites.  
---
The shotgun is very useful, imo, for rushing. Accuracy can be slightly ignored compared to the rifle, and the damage is really high. This makes injures or kills likely. The shotty also has a fair amount of attachments to improve it's usefulness, like RDS and vert grip.  
---
Further, when playing Sledge as intended, the shotty servers as good vertical damage, allow for quick destruction of the floor or killing enemies from above with fewer shots than the rifle in many cases. Additionally, given the metal bars that support floors, a shotgun will almost guarantee at least damage onto a target, whereas the rifle's bullet may simply hit the beams. This makes noise and can scare off defenders before you get a hit in. A pistol can be used to kill enemies at a greater distance when doing this. It can also be used to protect allies against defenders should the defenders try and push upstairs to combat vertical attacks.  
---
It's not perfect, but it does do a lot of good for Sledge. Plus, the SAS shotty is arguably the second-best of the base CTU shotties (GIGN is first, imo).
---
EDIT: yurr it was the 40-60 kill thing IIRC
---
B is so true. It has the same issue as Tower which is everything looks the same. Not an issue with older maps because they tried to be realistic, so a bathroom is next to the bedroom and the staircase is next to the living room etc. Fortress is an alien place - doesn't feel like a real place.
---
Also if you played Siege in the past, you have things like red stairs, white stairs, red corridor, white corridor. Ever since Villa, Ubi has taken the Jony Ive design philosophy of everything looks the same to heart so everything looks the same.
---
TLDR: never got lost in the Australian map? It's memorable! Has a bull room, a room with Lightning McQueen, a room with an aquarium, a room with a flying shark etc.
---
when i apply for college how will you make sense
---
What you just said literally did not make any sense and you didn't say anything involving the topic of this post.
---
Hes on the blue team
---
The fact this one was replied to and the one above ignored is a joke.   
---
DDOS  has just the same impact on the game as your terrible matchmaking.  It creates advantages to those who exploit it and renders the game completely pointless and unfun for everyone on the otherside.   
---
Made worse by the fact this concern has been ignore for so long.  Done with your game. Why should I log in and play a a couple of games in my free time when I know as a silver ranked player I am going to be facing copper/bronze who are all plat/diamond in reality playing with their diamond ranked friend.   
---
IT IS NO FUN AND ITS NOT A FAIR EXPERIENCE.  Friend circle found another game to play this weekend instead so we are gonna try that out. Done with siege.  If a Balanced, Fair and fun game is not the priority for Ubisoft im not interested.

Niiiiice this is one of my favorite nitro spots

As usual it gets ignored and if you make a post about it you get downvoted and told to get good.

I just want siege on the unreal engine tbh that would be amazing.

This happens game in and game out. Someone lags the server while they‚Äôre on defense then turn it off while they attack. Something NEEDS to be done about this!

Yes!!!! Like f-f-fort you know what
---
If you're nothing without those ops, then you shouldn't have them.
---
That doesn‚Äôt change anything.
---
What difference does that make if they can't enforce it?
---
they made they blatantly clear when they rolled out the chat filter update. they said specifically that some may be caught off guard by Perma-bans. if you dont take 45 seconds to read their terms and conditions or just simply use your brain, its entirely your fault. I've said quite alot of dumb shit that deserved atleast a couple day ban but going from no ban to permaban must take a lot so obviously you must've really been quite toxic to deserve that.
---
That says more about your bar than it says about Canadians
---
You need to but R6 Credits from your console store, if on PC I'm sorry I dont know how That works but us console use Xbox Store and PS Store at the moment, I personally dont know how long everything is out you might have to submit a form to Ubisoft

Are you going to furball a school with it?

Anchor with Monty lmao. I can actually see this as being very fun tho.

Prob a 4 man stack who used there power. Sometimes when people get given power (aka a 4 man that can kick everyone) they will just abuse it for fun
---
&gt;its entirely your fault
---
... I never said I didn't deserve my ban.
---
I was just saying that it's possible to be banned for more than the "default" amount of time, at least in extreme circumstances (which my case certainly was).

I am on PC, i did submit a form to ubisoft a month ago, got in touch with the a staff, but their response simply was "we are aware of this,It will be resolved soon. Thank you for reporting"

I am just tired of waiting for two seasons. I want to know when this "soon" comes.
---
#__*the hostage has been killed*__
---
Dedicated observers can focus completely on observing the match. Casting and observing at the same time can be confusing after a while and you can lose focus. If you want to have quality production, you want to have people dedicated to a certain job instead of people multitasking
---
&gt; tryharding doesn't exist
---
Then what do you call a player, who spends 2+ hours a day training his aim or doing something similar? 
---
But I agree, that votekicking doesn't mean being tryhards.
---
Oh boio, you destroyed them :) gj

Hey if you are looking to play in Asia and still speak English, do you want to join my English speaking community on discord? We are very inclusive and we have people from Taiwan, China, Philippines, Cambodia and even France. We play regularly, it is only recently when I've been working when I've only been able to spend around 3-4 hours after work on the discord playing siege, but other than that the server is active. If you or anybody else looking for English speakers wants to play (We play ranked and casual 50-50), then I would love for you to join our server. But first can you or anybody else who is interested add me on uplay and discord? My uplay is Acylite and my discord is Acylite#2554.

Believe it was a couple of years back. Like the recent post about what they are focusing on.
---
They mentioned matchmaking.   Turns out they didn't do anything.
---
Calm down mate

It does, but it fluctuates wildly, and mostly it‚Äôs closet hacking. Everything can be an excuse.

There was a marker 5 seconds ago near there

I had a callout

Lol random shot dude‚Äô
---
Catch the drift?
---
you should've told me that earlier
---
The most frustrating thing is you send this to ubi  and they do nothing, the only way to get any message across is this whole sub should stop playing it, especially the PS4 users so it would push them to fix all these problems that a multi million dollar company shouldn‚Äôt have
---
Yea, definitly something more often to mix things up. R6 gets boring with esentially only 3 very similar gamemodes.
---
No, you can die and still stick the defuse, I think that‚Äôs likely what happened.
---
"felt cute. might kill hostage later, idk".
---
yup, lol

Same here, 11 kills 4 deaths, 3v5, somehow managed to won because of the FO12 extended barrel.

Ho can you be diamond on PS4 with only 65% win rate? Im only Gold with 60%
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure you know what pay to win means.
---
It's great with a 3stack or more because we have actual strategies and it's important to get some ops out. But it's fucking annoying with a 2stack or less cus then it's just fucking caveira and blitz again

I am suprised that after 4 years we still dont have a snake icon

At this rate we gonna need to take phantom sight out back and put it down.

Yes here is the point if you play with controller you would have seen the "share" button left of the touchpad on it little fella ;-)
---
Well the block of flats is basically you all start outside the block and can rappell onto whichever level you want, there‚Äôs multiple doors open to multiple flats which helps with having different level play, there would also be a flight of stairs to get you to each level and windows to each flat (castle would be useful)

If your whole argument was swiped off some youtube video i dont know what you hope of accomplishing here. I'm just raising the question about a possible failing esports campaign. One that may not even be failing. So i dont know who you are arguing with but good luck. Im going back to my theoreticals.
---
I see what you mean, that's also a way to approach this.
---
Do you read? In a bunch of other replies I say how I love to play ops like Cap and Monty. My isseus with them is relating either to their kits or weapon selections.
---
This is really good! Some interesting tech as well.
---
Agreed, I played 10 matches all in all and just because my friends insisted. I had enough after the first 2.
---
Showdown is in my opinion the worst season event so far.

No reinforceing hatches are a waste, most of the time. Just dont stand on hatches.
---
You could not be more wrong in terms of the view that Pro League is what is causing Siege to become more of a 'twitch' shooter.
---
If you understand Siege at a high level, then you'd know that Pro League is by far and away the most tactical and strategic version of Siege you'll see. If you play/watch Ranked gameplay, it's precisely what you describe - people running and gunning, a twitch shooter with very few comms and callouts. 
---
Pro League, and comp play is totally the opposite of that. 
---
Strange logic you've come up with there, seemingly based on very little experience watching Pro League if that's what you got from it.
---
Early siege allowed you to farm exp from thunt. some people are 900+
---
Which ela?

Hostage KIA

What's the issue?

Probability of them being ordered numerically up or down is 2/5 * 1/4 * 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/60

---
Btw i think what you are describing is a symptom and a cause. People played slower not because they didnt know what they were doing. They just played more carefully. Every room was drasticly lit different you werw at a disadvantage for running around. Plus a five minute round timer allowed players to take their time to formulate an approach.
---
Dont you talk to me or my hostage ever again
---
This is the worst possible advice.
---
He wants an actual good, viable operator that will help him learn. Not a smurf noob stomper that is only good for crushing low elo teams in casual.
---
How does the money only packs wall of content or stop you from enjoying the game? 95% of all cosmetics you can earn free in game, if the 4 or 5 loot pack events a year prevents you from enjoying the game thats on you not Ubi
---
Jackal, Cav and Echo are not OP they are just not fun to play against. Although they are fun to play I would rather ban them just to not suffer with being tracked for half the round or stunned for forever.
---
So if have a 1.25 K/D and 0.75 W/L and I can't get out of silver because of bad teammates and uneven matches, it doesn't matter.
---
Thanks.  I hate it.
---
This is a dream for me
---
If you enjoy Nomad you should consider Gridlock next.
---
This is a Common bug?
---
I play on xbox I was going to ask if you wanted to play cause sometimes playing with the same people in ranked makes it easier to move up and tolerate teammates.
---
IRL I was shot for trying to blow an airport........
---
sorry, you guys kept talking about this spec ops thing and I had to do it.
---
Yeah but you're still playing the worst attacker in the game, purely because he's a 3 armour.
---
These are awesome
---
We divide our forums into two types, game specific and general hacking.
---
The developers of these anti cheats do infact fix the issues by as you say, just sitting there and reading. 
---
I‚Äôve always wrestled with the motive that we want them to find out so we keep things fresh. But it‚Äôs more like this: 
---
We get enjoyment from sharing things with other people, and then seeing them make something of our information and then returning the information back into the system. It‚Äôs the cost of free movement of information, the opposing team are able to watch as well.
---
But we know this simple axiom: there will always be more methods to hack then they can fix. 
---
So yes, they do look at these forums and they do patch them. The most recent memory from my time making them was the whole load library meme. It‚Äôs a core function of the windows library that allows you to just attach your code to the process without any bells and whistle.... and battleye didn‚Äôt even care or raise an eyebrow. But by abusing it to such a degree, we forced them to make a fix.
---
Public cheating is for the common good. We have our fun while it‚Äôs fixed, and then we find more fun.
---
Private cheating is the danger to anti cheats. Most of the methods (for which my contacts disclosed to me for r6 even though I don‚Äôt actively cheat) are just laughable. Battleye is basically security theater for the masses, but if your keeping your head down, then you‚Äôre not going to get caught, period.
---
Congratulations it was bronze I found iut because I ranked up after the match I just played
---
I agree that button does absolutely nothing. That‚Äôs why I am always recording and if I find myself in a game with cheaters I just upload the video on yt and submit a ticket via ubisoft site.
---
Couldn‚Äôt they like.. give the skin to everyone who contributed anyway? I mean, it‚Äôs clear that there was a miscalculation by Ubisoft so it‚Äôs not our mistake...
---
I don't really think, that Anchors and Attackers with ACOGs are the real problem. Other maps come with similar things, but they don't feel that annoying on those maps. And tower is not even that Anchor friendly, but people also dislike that map.  
---
Like I said, I see those Maps as to Roamer friendly, especially "lone wolf roamers", aka the guys who never communicate or play with their teams and never help in any way.
---
From my view, what people see as a problem is when a Map is just to friendly und rewarding for playing this "lone wolf" style.
---
But a group of players tries to brute force this style into the game, because they hoped into Siege because of popularity.  
---
Those are the people who hate Jackal, Lion, Blitz, Doka, Cav, etc. so much. Those are Operators who counter and punish being a lone wolf sprinting all around the map.  
---
My wild guess: Twitch  
---
Many viewers want to see non stop action in those streams and a lot of streamers deliver it with force in the game to get viewers watching it on their channel.  
---
I see this in Apex a lot. 90% of the people with a \[Twitch\] Tag in their Name run around with 100% tunnel vision. They forget their team so often. When there is a fight between two groups and one teammate got hit by a sniper is down, and could easily be revived...nope, they rush into a fight of 3v3, just to end in the middle of 6 players and get moved down.   
---
They rather rush into this super disadvantage instead of reviving, waiting a moment and then overrun the remaining players of that gunfight.  
---
Because their viewers will freak out if they deliver this 2v6 maybe once in a month...or maybe just once per Season.  
---
Many people picked up Siege, because of high Viewer Numbers around the Proleague Matches, but rather watch some of those "entertainment" streamers.   
---
Overwatch is the perfect example, people rather watch another Hanzo one Trick, who gets 80% of his kills with his Ult, than a really good Ana player...except those people who really appreciate a well played Ana.  
---
And many long time players of Siege dislike those Lone Wolfs and Maps that even support this trend.  
---
They appreciate seeing a good Mira or a Bandit who does the whole Bandit-Trick perfect for 3 Rounds as a defender. They know, that a perfect Bandit Trick in Bank top floor ir harder, than just rushing outside the back entrance and throwing a C4 for the effect even if they maybe get one kill while doing it.  
---
They see Siege as a Teamgame, instead of another "aimbro shooter" and they want to see this game represented and played in this way.  
---
They don't hate roamers, but they hate roamers, who always risk everything to get a kill and mostly get sorrounded and shot be the Attackers.
---
The turtles back reminds me of shoguki's face from for Honor

Cunt it doesn't matter how many kills you get if you don't play objective. I'm LITERALLY an Ash main, and even I like to switch to monty when we need actual strats.
---
It's typical of newer to think that all that matters are kills, while completely failing to play the game properly. You need to have actual team set ups and strats to win.
---
I have seen full teams of diamond beaulo clones lose to a team of full plats, simply because the plats used proper strats and team comp while the diamonds tried to frag every round.
---
not gonna lie at first i thought to myself is this the start of special melee animations :o bought the bundle and was disappointed. that said i'd rather not have them touch the melee system it's already wank don't want them to break it and introduce drop shot and raptor legs again
---
Just the other day I got kicked for someone jumping in my line of fire.
---
I would literally just hop on my smurf and boost it to diamond in a few hours flat.
---
I used the double upvote technique cuz this is so awesome hope you do commissions
---
They don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave to investigate‚Äù and most likely won‚Äôt. The problem with cyber crime is establishing jurisdiction. On top of that, there needs to be a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù not just some ad saying ‚Äústressing servers for $‚Äù.
---
V308, acog, flashhider, vert grip. Claymore.
---
Push the objective with your team if you hear your team mates in a gunfight hit your gadget. If you are about to push site, drone and find the enemy (don't ping) hit the gadget and push. If they move you can see the ping if no ping then you know they are still there so pre fire.
---
Cover flanks. If your team are pushing Claymore stairs or whatever flank you choose. Hear footsteps hit the gadget or if someone shoots your Claymore then hit it.
---
I hadn't used him since the nerf until last night and I managed to top frag with him a few matches. I really like his gun, loads of rounds, reasonable rate of fire and reasonable damage, low recoil.
---
The coletrain plows mate
---
I am sad to reveal such a spot, but judging by the upboats...people appreciate it.
---
I look forward to seeing/hearing of frost mats in that spot in coming weeks lol.
---
100% 16:10, UNLESS you are a die hard acog user.
---
16:10 is nice since you can still use ACOGs with it as well as holos, while 16:9 is only really good for ACOGs.
---
Right!?!? One of the OG ops and he ain't getting no love...Fucking Lesion got an elite before Castle
---
Hey look! Clash was hit with the ban hammer! ...again.
---
I wonder how he made the octopus one /s
---
I'm gonna say it!  P90&gt;MP5    its true
---
Unfortunately this is how the game works. If you want to get gold 1 you have to be able to beat plat 3's. If you want plat 3 you need to be able to beat plat 2's, and so on.
---
I spent countless seasons grinding through each rank, so I know about this one.
---
i got finished by many operator gadgets / flashes / barbed wire + bandit | kaid battery but out of all of them sledge is the only one that makes me shit my pants ... that shit just too brutal
---
In the lower ranks strat doesn't matter. Team mates don't even ban in silver. No one plays any strays and you get team killed for looking at someone badly. Despite all this manage to play objective but I can't always win 5 v 1s can I. 
---
You're answer is literally an expanded form of git gud which doesn't help at all.
---
A personal theory is its a lower cost to buy in.
---
PC's cost more money than consoles. Not only that, but consoles give you multiple accounts for free, where as additional accounts on pc cost money. Getting banned means much more expense on PC than console for that reason. This is true with most games as far as I'm aware. 
---
PC gaming is on the rise, but console gaming is still more popular. More people in the pool = more toxic dickheads. Combine that with a higher likelihood for kids on console, and you end up with a toxic cesspool. 
---
Pretty much all online games have toxic communities. It's been that way since I can remember (started playing online games back in the Ultima Online days, so about 22 years ago). I think it has a lot to do with anonymity, people don't see other players as people. You see the same thing with driving even, people drive like maniacs with no regard for waiting in line or other people's safety, because they see machines instead of other people. Those same people will be courteous and polite and let you ahead in line because you only have two items in the grocery store line and you're behind them with a full cart.
---
People behave completely differently when they think someone is watching, you see those true colors come out in anonymous forums such as online games.
---
Caveira is not very strong, especially since most of my friends can hear her even through silent step. So that is an useless ban, when we NEED to get something like Kaid for example out on some objective for our strat. Blitz is also usually not a threat if you know what you are doing. We usuallu ban Hibana instead, but sometimes we need someone spesific out. That is what's wrong with banning two weak operators when we need someone else out for our strat.
---
IRL Wikipedia thinks I'm special forces and I'm offended that ubisoft hasn't added me in as a new operator yet
---
That‚Äôs one angry birbo
---
Only if you are not get killed too fast.
---
Sometimes I feel bad for public relation teams of companies. They take all the flak from angry and dissatisfied customers over things that were not in their control.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, sometimes these companies deserve it, but the pr team is the ones that need to face the public.
---
US part two: 6 against 1

Arent you a petty one? Real life of the party
---
I don‚Äôt usually leave from matches unless the people who kill me send me messages
---
Ubi akimbo bosg when
---
I mean, it IS funny to kill people with ash charges or flashbangs.
---
that happened to me yesterday too!
---
So it kinda makes sense as in theory those silver/low golds should make short work of the bronze and copper players which gives you more resources to allocate to the lone plat one right?
---
ye but, pew pew nice sound?
---
Replace the grenade with a party popper and yeah
---
She aged horribly, wow
---
Imagine playing a game and having zeroes kills and 6 assist because your teammates thirst your downed opposing ops
---
True
---
it‚Äôs still possible to get MVP from that if you play a gadget-heavy operator. I‚Äôve never really cared about kills
---
It's fine.
---
Felt cute might delete this later though
---
f
---
can you define "real world" ?
---
so how do you also know a drone drove into a random ass jammer or that you blocked a breaching charge halfway across the map? thats just one thing but you undoubtedly lose information without the points. that's the whole reason they're not allowed in pro play. if you don't think it matters, that's alright, but saying there's nothing lost is just plain wrong.
---
My friend who was new to the game was given the same advice his responce was to scream i dont see any heads before getting killed by a rushing sledge with a shotgun
---
Kind of looks deformed, but cool idea. Should have made this an elite skin and reskinned his nades with the charm though. Wasted potential.

---
Appreciate the detailed response! Seems that you actually do have a lot of knowledge about hack developers and cheaters themselves. A bit surprised about private hack costs, but it does make sense.
---
This never-ending challenge of working around security measures sound like a hell of an interesting work so I can understand why people are doing this. Obviously a great deal lower level, I remember how captivating was writing a simple automation bot for a crappy browser game I did years ago - didn't even plan to play it much, just the process itself was far more engaging that this game could ever be. Can't blame the talented developers for wanting to get some money off their hobby too.  
---
I believe it might be nigh impossible to identify hackers who write chears themselves and are smart about HWID/MAC/IP etc. but at the same time I don't believe them to be a large problem compared to the "script kiddies" buying hacks.
---
An interesting point you've brought about not dealing with linked accounts to avoid false positive bans. Probably having too many of false positives might be worse for PR image than leaving some hackers unpunished. 
---
As a follow-up question, what measures would you recommend to Ubisoft that could drastically reduce amount of cheaters/hackers? Are there any obvious low hanging fruits like "limit 1 account per 1 phone number to play ranked" (what Valve does) or it's much more complicated? 
---
Also you might want to remove the website time from the 5th paragraph (if it's an actual name, I didn't check) to not upset mods.
---
True yeah, but I‚Äôm looking to raise my kd. The assist unfortunately don‚Äôt help me there

nice

More like pc diamond
---
It's often 3 or 4 coppers then 1 or 2 unranked accounts. They use it as a way to get the unranked account to win all of its placement matches and achieve a higher rank than they deserve.

Actually no, I made this on my phone too. When you pick you flair, there‚Äôs an edit button in the corner and you can add whatever words/emblems you want within a certain character limit.
---
I trust my teammates.
---
Did almost the sane thing on club house yesterday. I didn't kill them all, one was left but felt like I was good for the first time ever.
---
People who do this are assholes like just because you don‚Äôt get the one character you like doesn‚Äôt mean you get to put the team at a disadvantage by playing recruit
---
#***uno reverse card***
---
You could also write to the Ubisoft Support or look into the game FAQ. Maybe you find something there.
---
Could we get a tour?
---
Do you have decorated inside
---
I‚Äôm thinking of making an R6 map in Minecraft hehe
---
Please tell me it has interior if so show more images
---
Well the game mode made headshots useless. The main shot gun was a one hit kill rifle that made getting headshots hard and completely unnecessary. 
---
The revolver was good enough to rapid fire 2-3 in the body to get a kill. Which was all incentevized by not having any sights on the guns.
---
Feet
---
Not a lot of people click the link and would rather hate on ubi. I just don‚Äôt want to misinform people
---
That's because server will never be perfect mate
---
c'mon now, don't be a beach about it
---
Forget the gadget, why would that operator use a pistol that has been out of service since 1961?
---
a.) It doesn‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre boosting as the silver went 2-7 lmao. Also, it‚Äôs probably one of their friends that they don‚Äôt play with a lot.
---
b.) Don‚Äôt spawn helipad bro
---
Yea but it doesn't have any impact at all whether the game is esports or not.
---
It's still an issue devs can't magicly resolve immediately.
---
Daddies credit card? You dont even know me so lets just settle down because I dont think youre entitled to shit just because you bought the game, so did I and every season pass and some elites and other packs, with my own money(not that its any concern of yours)
---
My spirit animal is a turtle..
---
If you've never played it before, prepare to get curbstomped a lot as you learn it. The game has an extremely steep learning curve that can be daunting to newcomers, but the payoff once you start to understand it is well worth it.
---
Oh of course man. Its just frustrating when it does happen
---
Wow
---
What's an extended socket?
---
(am not the op)
---
It‚Äôs a game I had a full team with and we would play pretty consistently so yeah. 6 weeks is a while for me to not have touched the game at least a couple of times.
---
a) They confirmed the boosting in the chat ''Boosting is not forbidden, go ahead, report us''
---
b:) I didn't, friend of mine did in the first round, that's all.
---
they're so incredibly obvious that they're really only useful against rushers, last minutes pushes, or braindead players, which makes the traps quite situational.
---
Games that value competition in general should be competitive. You'd think it would be a priority. What platform do you play on and has it happened to you?
---
Could you make Oregon? Atleast the house with furniture. ^^
---
The mad lad made the background buildings as well
---
Oh damn well if they confirmed it then fuck them lol
---
I've been put in 0-2 games that are already on the 3rd round and I load in to watch my team die and get a loss.
---
You are looking way too deep. There's a growing esports scene with this game and an actual realistic tactical shooter wouldn't make it far in this generation.
---
Felt cute. Might blow up some hostages later
---
It would be a shame if a creeper were to....breach charge.  jk haha. Unless
---
It happened to me in ***fucking casual*** yesterday
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind, thanks
---
Yeah I will thanks
---
I am a bot. Feedback appreciated.
---
And it wouldn't even be hard that if theres one Platinum-1 player that the whole lobbby is Platinum-1. Easy
---
Omg, that's amazing. Did you make the subway?
---
You mean Red House
---
even if you use m+k on ps4/xbox you can‚Äôt lean without aiming bc there aren‚Äôt the binds in the system
---
People rook main I think because his plates are dope for the whole team and then you become a three armor *with* an armor boost who can hold offsite spots to repel incoming pushes well with his acog mp5/p90, and if you get dusted doing so your utility is still being applied at 100% efficiency, whereas if you get popped as doc with stim darts still in your inventory you wasted potential utility.
---
At least, that's what I tell myself. He's not my main by a huge margin or anything, but I pick him quite a bit in ranked. I'm not great and it's a comfort to know that if I potato the fuck out as I do from time to time, those vests are still applying aid to the team while I sit at home cursing my poor aim and decision making lol.
---
Yeah. Please explain this further. I have never heard this before.
---
Only time I use rook is when I can‚Äôt be bothered to use an operator where you have to keep using their ability, for me it‚Äôs a lot less stressful than echo for example as you have to keep switching between drones so you don‚Äôt miss an enemy walk straight through a choke point undetected
---
MaKe Me OnE oR pErIsH
---
xbox and PS4 have the same recoil system lol
---
Just scream "slow and steady wins the race" really obnoxiously for a few rounds and every time someone dies and they should get thw hang of it
---
i‚Äôve gotten ddosed 2 times ina row now on ps4 and i have suspected a couple people of m+k it might be the rank or sum but i‚Äôm only plat3
---
looks like Morgz mum
---
What kind of logic is that lol
---
Exactly, I‚Äôve been curb stomped by a team of recruits before.
---
Totally agree, but most people don‚Äôt know how to play him well unfortunately. Lol. Castle is a roamers worst nightmare sometimes.
---
I‚Äôm having a hard time getting past the fact the chin guard on the helmet is the wrong way but I suppose that only matters in the picture.  In game he doesn‚Äôt hold a bat.  Just annoyance things.
---
Is there a reason to NOT open fire immediately upon visual confirmation?
---
SMG 11 is one of the best secondaries
---
I wish I could take the plates off of Rook's corpse :D
---
I do mute people yah. It‚Äôs this weird concept though that people think they have a right to say those words in a video game and get upset when no such right exists, and then they bitch about it. 
---
They are using a service provided by a company that has every right to censor them if they want to, it‚Äôs not the United States government, it‚Äôs a Ubisoft server and if they want to use those words they don‚Äôt have to play. It‚Äôs not the Internet. It‚Äôs a game server. It is different. 
---
So they can stop bitching about being censored, and I will be happy when they are censored and the tech to censor them keeps getting smarter and better at it. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it extends to voice chat one day.
---
So funny...   
---
Child molestation and rape...   
---
So edgy, so subversive..   
---
When I'll tell my buddies at school they'll laugh their asses off...  
---
Shit World.
---
there prob ddosing the server don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything you can do about it sorry
---
They shortened the inactive time
---
Just because it happens at wood tier doesnt make it true for higher levels. Recruit is objectively a bad operator due to forced iron sights alone.
---
No they don't lol.  Most sights are zero'd at 50 or 100m.  If you're firing at any distance other than the zero the bullet will deviate from the red dot.  And at 100m bullets are quite susceptible to wind, meaning even at the zero'd distance they'll still likely deviate
---
Ela really looks depressed after all of the nerfs
---
That‚Äôs true, at least I could understand people who want to reach certain ranks because of r6 credits or renown prizes at the end of the season, but there aren‚Äôt any lol. I cared to much about the rank last season too, I wanted to reach plat so bad that a friend boosted me, even tho I didn‚Äôt liked that I reached plat3 and I was happy, then I understood that idgaf about the rank anymore lol
---
Sadly true... those boosters...
---
I didn't know airjabs could soft breach
---
?? It's always been like that tf u been amoking
---
The Dev Blog mentions it, but really really casually with only the following quote: "The system will not grant you MMR beyond your max MMR for the current Season."
---
But as I said the official reddit thread has comments from the devs where they have to explain it multiple times: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aoiohl/dev_blog_mmr_roll_back/
---
Including this comment: "We have to look at it from a much bigger perspective then 3 games.
---
Let's take 10 for example, with the following pattern : Win win loss win win loss win win loss win
---
With these, the players rank would stay relatively the same even though they only lost to cheaters. That means they are winning these matches at Gold. Once the MMR is rolled back, they would potentially be pushed into the Diamond MMR range, even though they only won Gold matches to get there."
---
Which kind of irks me.  First, what's the harm if I get rubberbanded into Diamond and don't deserve it?  If I suck when I get there I'll just lose all my matches all the way down.  Or is it meant to be Ubi doesn't want me to have a charm I don't deserve?  But they'll let me get copper boosted to Diamond to get that charm no problem.
---
They need to get rid of the max MMR nonsense IMHO.  If the goal is to nullify the match, then nullify the match.  If I only lost 3 out of 10 games to cheaters then it's safe to assume I would have won those 3 games if it wasn't against cheaters so rubberband me up.  (Not me, I mean, I suck, as I've mentioned I'm probably a high silver/ very low gold and best.)
---
I reached one time about 10k, then the game crashed :(
---
Mozzie gang
---
aw
---
I mean not necessarily.  I play with my all of my friends half the time and they aren‚Äôt the greatest which has probably limited my rank in reality.  I just don‚Äôt have anyone in the higher ranks to play with except a few of them that I carried to Plat 3.  I play on Xbox so would you recommend the Looking for Group feature or R6 Discord?
---
I guess colibri is a stoner or a street fighter?

This may be retarded but did you do anything with the uplay ingame overlay, like turned it off ? Cuz that caused siege to crash for me. Judging by your specs siege should be running without any problems so its most probably something silly like that

Inside?
---
Such is life
---
Yay
---
&gt;Edit: just remeber if you are ever playing casual and a plat or diamond player is playing poorly be sure to call them out for being boosted.
---
Perfect example of shitty behavior we don't need in siege.
---
The middle column icons are sick, nice job!
---
This isn‚Äôt prof at all
---
By boosting do you mean one of them is a cheater that is carrying somebody else?
---
Are the insides decorated
---
Hey, that‚Äôs awesome! I‚Äôm doing a similar thing with Chalet.
---
That‚Äôs the life us R6 players live....
---
I sure will make a post when I get my first video out. The map walkthroughs is a great idea! I could walk through and name the callout locations, valk cams, default cams, and obj locations!
---
I‚Äôm talking about removing it from casual and maybe only on Xbox.  The pc community seems more likely to actually play 
---
I agree that there is more they can do like just track how many games you murder someone in prep phase
---
They are playing with worse ranks to get worse enemies
---
Nah dude. Really it just looks cool, no actual purpose. Same as aiming and leaning
---
I don‚Äôt think I agree. I get 9 ping, but I get an even amount of starting as attacker or defender. Sometimes, it feels like I get 60% starting on defense. Still, that seems rough.
---
Oh ok
---
Not enough buttons on a controller unless you have paddles.
---
When the stars align...
---
Ah ok
---
Also, I like his operator profiles, but they are a bit long and in-depth for what I think new players want. I want a video you could easily watch in a few minutes.
---
*Right on!*
---
It looks really cool dude!
---
Ever since they removed recruit from ranked I haven't touched it. Fuck Ubi.
---
I think there is a mobility advantage because you aren‚Äôt aiming
---
No better feeling than that
---
Not a single icon is even lined up straight, how much stupider could this get??

Yea but they could have one button for two uses like knife and aim down lean

Believe me, you aren't missing any information.

I just switched to pc 4 months ago. No mobility increase, or no hip fire help.

How old are you?

he is so lanky, I like it!

Nonono, you can go fuck yourself if your even thinking about using MNK on Xbox. You being bad is just an excuse, learn to play like everyone else
---
Try restarting your router perhaps, could be your internet glitching out
---
(Reuploaded for better quality) It really is just a compilation of 2 years in R6 sharing C4.

It's an excuse to listen classical music and relax =).

Well respekt your parents, but it does help you hand eye cordination and fast thinking skills. Also it is the most complex FPS and helps you think
---
Natively no, but you could find an input adapter. There‚Äôs one for ps4 and I think Xbox prolly made by the same company. Good luck m8
---
There's aim assist on PC?
---
And what do you do if smurfs surrender a match, you win 6 elo then you get matched again and they destroy you 4 and 0 and you lose 80 elo
---
Source ?
---
You are asking the R6 sub, what do you expect us to say?
---
Seriously though, buy R6.   Understand that the learning curve is steep and that it's fairly different from anything else.  You will get frustrated--with how much more other players know, with toxic and stupid teammates, with the game itself at times.  Everyone does.  But we keep coming back because it's worth it.  A good, well-played ranked match is so much fun.  It's worth spending 45 minutes just to lose.  Messing around on casual can also be fun (although the good matches are less common).  And, probably because of the steep learning curve, the progression as you get better feels very worthwhile and earned.
---
He is better than Bnans who got carried to diamond and had kd of 0.6
---
Because of a lucky hipfire?
---
I dont normally call it out but this felt really fishy. We would do fine on attack but when we were deffending he would always play monty and have insane hip fire accuracy. What do you think?
---
Also if im braking any sub rules please remove the post.
---
I would hold onto those for next gen. On PS5 apparently they are really gunning for higher sound quality presentation and more accurate sound. There will be a dedicated "3D Audio Chip" inside the PS5 that will make sounds much more accurate and make surround sound much more useful.
---
I wouldn't waste your money on an Arctis headset as the only one that's worth looking at is very overpriced (Arctis Pro Wireless $329). Your headset is fine, audio quality on gaming headsets suck anyways so as long as 7.1 works for you that's all that matters.

Essentially yes. Everything is the exact same as console, just the fact you can do the animation without aiming down sights
---
Great, another reason to not use Alibi.
---
You underestimate his power!
---
So basically mastercrafts from COD? Also happy cake day
---
It's an unfair advantage and not how the game is intended to be played. Why would you say it should be encouraged? If you wanna play with a keyboard, play on PC. It's not fair, and people do it because it is an advantage. Period.
---
Lowpixel
---
Along those lines, if either of your parents is a gamer have them try R6.  As they see how much more this game is about tactics, communication and teamwork than other FPS games, it might change their mind.

Watching Pro League might do the same.

Hello dafhatton, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cef2ho/clash_bug_is_still_in_console_siege/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

I'll be alright thanks
---
That‚Äôs disrespectful
---
Fired two shots, the first hit so they stopped. I don't see what's so dodgy.
---
So... There is something called challenges in this game... Wait there are more buttons than play ranked and options in the main menu too?
---
Why did they only give us like 5 days? I played the event for a decent amount of time but it was just more fun to run around knifing people with recruit instead of tryharding.
---
Thats illegal
---
Okay and idk either
---
My man lost that game so hard , Ubisoft made him do his placements again
---
That's fucking awesome lol
---
when you finish it can you post the save?

Some people just don‚Äôt care enough, I had this problem with my regular group.  Mind you, they would love to play competitively... but they don‚Äôt care enough to learn how to play at a high level.
---
If you don‚Äôt care about possibly making a few new enemies I highly suggest looking for a new group whether it‚Äôs on reddit or discord
---
Yea it is but it does look like a water gun
---
I love all the detail up to the poster of the guy
---
His name is also Sipps banned? maybe his first account was banned for doing something like this, he was in a 4 stack and his friends were all huddled behind him taking advantage of the shield then knifing my team mates
---
I‚Äôd recommend but it is expensive
---
What's more I got the game like 2 months ago
---
1 lucky hipfire doesn't mean hacks. If this happens repeatedly at long distances like this then I would start to question it.
---
If you're not really feeling it I'd just purchase enough credits to at least unlock Mozzie

He should be an attacker

You would be absolutely stunned how stupid some people are. I have a video saved somewhere of a round where I killed three people peeking from the same window... with Glaz. First guy tried to spawnpeek, got headshotted. Any smart player would know ‚Äúhey, Glaz is out there. Bad idea.‚Äù Not these guys. Proceeded to kill the other two who literally ran up to the window where their dead buddy died. Easy 3 piece, all one taps.
---
No. A support roamer. The hero of the shadows. His main objectives: Sweep First, Shoot Second. Dustin is the man who follows his careless companions as they drag in mud and junk all over the place, cleaning up after them to leave no trace behind. All the other operators scoff at poor Dustin, believing his decorated years of janitorial service a joke. He doesn‚Äôt need their praise. He already knows that when he sweeps the floors... his team will sweep the enemy. Job well done.
---
Never go against a J√§ger-lusted Mozzie
---
Yeah but like if Bandit or valk keep holding their gadget
---
If this was a standalone incident then it would be very possible he pulled of the hipfire but if he constantly got kills like that it would be a little too fishy.
---
Wolf from Princess Mononoke?
---
Get_Flanked just put out a video as well that made me start using the red dot again. Honestly I really like the feedback on the red dot. Obviously I run ACOG when applicable, but I‚Äôve switched most other sights to red dot and have been playing way better. I‚Äôm not a great player by any means but I did realize I was using holographic because the internet was yelling at me to.

You could legitimately make a minigame out of this. Of course much of the rules would rely on the honor system, but you could do a lot of the technical stuff with enchantments and tipped arrows.

Get a controller like everyone else mate . it's cheaper than mouse and keyboard

BTW this is breaking Rule 2.

I use red do to line up center mass easy on shotguns

yes and thanks, or at least i think so, explain them to me, i havn't played cod in a while
---
Alright now make Favela
---
What..? Every button has a function when you're not ADS. When you actually ADS you're not able to knife (so your analogs have no use at this time), which allows them to be assigned to lean. So there aren't enough buttons on a controller without paddles for this to be possible.
---
Why encourage it?

For the question. Headshot or no? I was pretty sad about this.

This looks like a rainbow 6 map
---
Ok, let's take an example.  
---
Let's say you designed a machine to produce widgets. It's supposed to produce orange and blue widgets in a roughly 50/50 split. After building 3 of the machines and feeding in raw material for 50 widgets, one produces a 38/12 split, one produces a 30/20 split, and the last produces a  47/3 split. Would you continue feeding in raw material or would you find it worthwhile to investigate whether there may be a flaw in your design?
---
Tbh I‚Äôm not really going to miss Old Kafe. It was the most meh map in the pool other than Chalet.
---
thats a lot of cringe

I'm on HD598 SR myself paired with a yeti. Can't beat a USB mic/Sennheiser combo. Best price/performance out there.

---
I'd have to let them run enough to have statistically significant information.
---
Well, I mean yeah.  I guess what I meant is nobody plays knowing they're going to lose.  Ideally you want to win more games than you lose and constantly be moving forward.  I think if someone has like a .4 W/L in ranked they should probably stick to casual for a while until they get it figured out.
---
I would think though the majority of the players who play ranked end at a higher MMR than they started and the released stats back that up.
---
How does tracking footsteps beyond line of sight to the pinpoint location of the person who left them make sense.
---
What kind of jacket and pants did u used?
---
Don‚Äôt worry they have a copper 4 it‚Äôs all balanced

Not sure about spectating but silent running is supposed to be client based not server based. Theoretically speaking, the enemy should hear you perfectly fine if you are silent running

Ayy high 5!!

Oh how can I miss that so sorry
---
They killed ur german mate and u got revenge.
---
His team will rise from the grave just to tell him it‚Äôs his fault that he lost
---
Oh yeah that disconnect glitch is pretty common, next time if you disconnect just quit the game and restart it. Then you should get the reconnect to game prompt to rejoin the game you left.
---
fuck
---
You musta had a lot of free time
---
It‚Äôs not really a glitch I think it‚Äôs something like the guy leaves before he loses the match and it won‚Äôt count as a loss or something like that. I remember seeing a screen shot of a guy with 0.01 kd and 100+ win loss.
---
i mean the copper went 0-7

I didnt know his seasons before sry you just posted 3

You ever just be so bored that you create a god tier project

Shit i nearly killed the dude on the phone, oops
---
Been used in pro league a few times iirc, would be great with cap.
---
They should fix it but not that way. That's basically the case in Rocket League and there you can't play with friends who aren't quite as good as you if you wanna keep your rank. A better solution imo would be to have a max rank difference between top and bottom player like in csgo.
---
It did, but I am playing at low gold level(still getting my rank). I slapped them, but I didnt have to tryhard if ubi fixed boosting
---
Crisp
---
They should just get rid of ranked K/D.

Jackel is receiving a small nerf to his pings. 4 instead of 5. It‚Äôs small but I feel like that won‚Äôt be enough for a lot of players and it‚Äôll most likely go to 3

As far as practical advice, it would be helpful to know more.  What is your routine?  Are there patterns to how you die?  What are your strengths and weaknesses?  In general, auditing your deaths is help.  Ask yourself why you died and what you could have done differently.  Over time, the lessons you learn from that will help you improve.

They‚Äôre making it so damage done over multiple rounds can stack and turn on RFF. Also they‚Äôre making it so if you down someone it auto turns on RFF and depending if you bleed out or get revived the people who downed you might die or not.

This applies to stickers/shirts/mugs/posters/etc...
---
This t-shirt spam is becoming an issue on Reddit. Often the accounts posting the shirt, those asking for a link and those offering the link are all involved. Usually newer accounts, often all three are the same age and have very low karma.
---
There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post‚Äôs photo, onto garment preview images.
---
The broken English nonsense descriptions are also a red flag (even though it‚Äôs inadvertently hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a bad quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print.

Be careful, friends!

If you like to Anchor, I‚Äôd choose Lesion. If you have good game awareness then it should be easy for you to know if their is an enemy nearby when your trap goes off. Not to mention, Lesions SMG has a good fire rate.
---
If you like to roam/camp outside of objective I‚Äôd go with Ela, depending on if it‚Äôs a bigger or smaller map you could go with either her shotgun or Scorpion. She is Also a three speed so all you have to do is reinforce and set down her Grzmots. 
---
Now this is My opinion, so others may have a different opinion, but this is just what I‚Äôd do myself if I were in your position.

Jesus not sure what this guy is smoking. Buying a monitor isn't rocket science. Just get a 27 inch monitor which is perfect size, it's the same size the proleague uses, and get within 1-2 ms delay and you're good. You should be able to find a decent one for $150 - $200, unless you're buying a BenQ which are extremely expensive. Xbox is locked on at 60 fps so don't worry about that when buying.

Capitao is 100% under rated but saying that I would never consider him one of the ‚Äústrongest attackers‚Äù Cap is strictly a situational operator and is ass anytime else!

Hibana is probably the most balance character we have in the game and is good for nearly every situation!
---
Jackal on the other hand... I‚Äôm a huge fan of the operator but can see the negatives of him!
---
Basically its a situation where i will win no matter what side comes
---
That‚Äôs what op is saying. Player level.
---
Well honestly... Yes? PC players tend to be closer to the monitor than console players and sometimes play in higher resolution and frame rates.
---
Also you rise to the challenge of your competition so console players won't improve much past a certain point. They are also more casual gamers. No one on pc would let a Prisma give away their position and it would have been very quickly destroyed as they entered.

Exactly

Less space for you to travel to shoot the enemy, meaning you'll have to adjust the aim less after coming out of cover

Wow it's like the games been out for 4 fucking years. Of course a new player would have to grind to get 4 years of contents worth. Or they can buy the pretty cheap gold / ultimate editions on sale and grind a bit less. You can definitely get to diamond with only the vanilla ops, they are good ops and lion is absolute shit so I don't know why you used him. Those events don't really matter since they're just for fun and you can play even if you don't have the ops. You are getting free maps, events, and operators that you have to put time into if you want to unlock. It's pretty easy to unlock the ops through simple fucking playtime, I only have 200 hours and have all but 10 ops which I think is very fair. The estimated 250 hours a year you have to put into the game to unlock all the dlc ops is also a very fair amount. You're telling me you can't play 40 minutes a day on average to unlock free dlc operators? You don't have to play 40 fucking hours in one week, spread it out it's not like you have a major disadvantage for not having one of the dlc ops. Also, how is it a bad thing that newer players don't have to unlock the vanilla ops? It literally means less playtime for vanilla ops which hm... isn't that what you're complaining about? You already had the advantage of having had the game, playing it, enjoying it, and all the vanilla ops were already super easy to unlock as they were cheap but no you just have to complain that others don't have to go through that because they're new.
---
TLDR: stop bitching about free stuff that's very easy to get.

Yeah man, the ranked system is fucked. My little brother is in low gold, and he plays against plats, He however wins a good amount of his games, he gains 30 points for winning, and I (a Plat) gain 90 points for winning against higher ranks. Then when he loses, he loses like 70-80 points, setting him back to where he was like 3 games ago. I really do feel bad for him and I hope that Ubi finds a way to fix with this. Like maybe there is a maximum point difference between people who queue, if it was 1000 points, coppers, bronzes silvers, and golds wouldn‚Äôt have plays on their teams and the system would be a little bit better, but then there is still the smurfs.
---
I respectfully disagree
---
She is a good operator because she forces team play, something you don't see too much of in solo games. If you don't understand team play then you're just unarguably not too good at the game. As clash, your team is your survival. When they're dead, the enemy gains confidence, as it's just a clash. But when they're alive and around, seeing clash is horrifying, as she does damage, and her friendlies go looking for who she's engaging. Clash players can't be toxic. As a clash player myself, if I get a down, I'm calling it out to our cav if we have one. Easy interro, easy kills. My friend group lets me finish if it was my kill. We all get around the same amount of points. That's why you'll see someone going 0/6/3 at the top of the game. Clash slows and disorients the enemy, and her friends clean up. Clash. Is. A. Good. Operator.

 Musca for Twitch is absolutely weirder

Lmao... Dude...

how old is this video ?

Katakana is a type of Japanese symbols for writing a katana is a type of sword.
---
Ah I see, thanks üôèüèª
---
Never was
---
Was he ‚Äúin a rush‚Äù?
---
Just get an xbox then play r6
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I have just bought the game and I am waiting for it to download!

We need "chronic quitters" to get tagged and thrown into their own matchmaking. Let them all play together and not suffer unequal matches. Hell, most of em probably don't even care if it is 5v5. Absolute cancer.
---
Well yeah if there's too many glitches then they should probably visit something like revisiting her core code, or probably just another code optimization like they did during I think para bellum
---
I don't get people either. I like the black holo.
---
 But I think Bartlett is good :( looks like I'm on my own tho
---
But the point is they see an actual Alibi and assume it‚Äôs the decoy here because he is standing still isn‚Äôt it? How would a PC player not make that mistake because they are on PC I don‚Äôt understand? Higher resolution and frame rates don‚Äôt make the decoy look any less real or fake that an actual Alibi standing still do they or am I missing something?
---
I just got two duplicate black ices in a row.
---
I mean it‚Äôs cheap so it‚Äôs kinda worth it
---
Alright, that‚Äôs very true, Jesus
---
Start tracking players who quit constantly. Tag them as a "chronic quitter" and place all "chronic quitters" into their own matchmaking system.
---
Reminds me of Toy Story.
---
Except if I wanted to nut in Toy Story.
---
Not even toxic mate, that was absolutly incredible.
---
Alright I didn‚Äôt know it was bannable. That‚Äôs the whole reason I asked if ubi permitted it. But if I have to do anything extensive to work or it‚Äôs bannable then no thanks I‚Äôm not doing it
---
Huh? I spawnpeek with alibi‚Äôs iron sights. Easier than trying to use mp5 at long range imo
---
The sound of your spray and the red X's lighting all at once made it only more sastisfying.
---
Actually not that badü§î
---
Sorry my guy, I read all the comments and then replied so I had a few other things on my mind when replying to yours. My Bad
---
one of the roamers (cav?) should be slightly resistant to his footprint thing.
---
make cav's footprints last less time or something so she's harder to track when in her silent walk mode.
---
What is his other ‚Äúability‚Äù?
---
I read that with Tachankas voice
---
Name: pedro Gutierrez

Bio: joined rainbow after seeing an ad for a janitor. Recieved the job after the team was shocked at how he was able to clean blood from all the team's clothing with a toothbrush and gasoline. After getting in an altercation with Cavaleira and jager over the world cup he proved his worth to the team  by making all the broken glass and tablets disappear before six arrived. Got on Bandit's good side after revealing his regular "unmarked" packages were low quality and showed him where to find better ones. He is the first in reconnaissance with an uncanny ability to enter gather intel and walk out undetected, or ignored, by repeating "I no espeaka Inglesh." Also allowing hine to not be interrogated due to language barrier and inability to look like an agent.

On the dead homie cuh free the homie blitz cuh
---
Hands down the best creation I‚Äôve seen
---
He would never have to enter the building.
---
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SIEGE EVENT
---
I liked showdown, kinda gutted it's gone.
---
Thank you! Lol
---
I have 3.6 for Maverick
---
Depends how do you pronounce montange
---
2.07 with Nomad
---
Russian national anthem plays
---
I know right? Had to change my pants after
---
There is a counter. Her name is Cav and she uses her silent step. Can‚Äôt be traced that way
---
having any kind of overlay causes this
---
Bruh just give a few operators a deployable roomba.
---
not a fan of their remakes of maps. each time its dissapointing...
---
I think it should only be between consoles
---
This makes me happy
---
Prob should say what system buddy.
---
Most likely some copper kids getting the idea you were hakcxing lul
---
I‚Äôm not disappointed with the result, I‚Äôm just disappointed with you for making this
---
wut??? how did he not see u
---
I didn‚Äôt know I needed this until I saw it.
---
lmao
---
If I played PC, then maybe, but I play PS4
---
I'm Canadian, I know a little bit of french
---
I mean, it ain't Twitch but it's still pretty sick.
---
It should only be between consoles. It would be a shit show if pc was in the mix.
---
Dayum

Team Rainbow was dispatched to Bank to defend it from an onslaught of White Masks only to find Dustin had single handedly defeated the attackers. Team Rainbow laughed at his ‚Äújust doing my job‚Äù remark. Dustin didn‚Äôt understand what was so funny or why there was blood all over the hall he could have sworn he just mopped.
---
Yeah, Casual is where I run into the most dickheads, and teams with one god-like player with 4 shitheads that have never played before. One of which is on a random part of the map miles away from OBJ and gets a free kill. 
---
Ranked is 1,000x more fun for me because (USUALLY) everyone is trying to win and not be a shithead.
---
Can you get this any time or just this season?
---
# t Hi s
---
How long did it tak to
---
Make this
---
I find it funny you're doing this with gridlock of all people lmao
---
Ah man. Just wait till Warden sees this.
---
Ah, those were the days. We miss you serenity!!
---
I just wish ranked wasn‚Äôt all bomb. I hate bomb so much. üòï
---
I understood this reference
---
Do air jabs send people through walls or is this very lucky timing of someone breaching the wall
---
The game in the picture is called "Quiplash." It's a fun game I recommend everyone plays! One person needs the game, then that person streams it for everyone else, and they go on their phones and answer questions like a Kahoot, then you vote who has the best answer.
---
The hero we need, not the hero we deserve...
---
They should go back to the fast pings instead of the 5 second wait but only do 3 of them
---
He is getting a Nerf on the TTS.
---
So was your sister
---
Is this a seasonal bundle or permanent bundle
---
I like the color composition.
---
Very abusable for boosters it can be a 5v1 everyone else leaves and the one clutches gains double MMR
---
Why is this a totally possible concept I'd be down with?
---
Yeah but you have to have good aim with her and you have to know how to sheild spin
---
There's no benefit to using it over the other guns other than to flex and to enemies
---
I mean, if he's telling the truth and actually only said 'Clash ruins the game'.. then 'harassed' is a pretty big stretch.
---
Salty for sure though
---
Since the aim is to go either ascending _or_ descending, the probability for the first step is 2/5 as either the lowest or the highest can be top/bottom. Then the probability for the next to be in correct order is 1/4, then 1/3 then 1/2
---
Just like you did to his sister?
---
Yeas but the thing is is that thats easier said than done and people usually panis win you turtle ive killed multiple good people with that trick because they dont expect it
---
This is some legit artistry going on
---
I think someone posted this not to Long ago
---
This along with the fact that it was a week late after everyone got bored of it. The mode got super repetitive after an hour or so.
---
How's it not fair? They were busted / broken before
---
No
---
If not an ACOG, then his turret should be able to shoot through shields ü§î
---
Is that the red lantern corps I see?
---
thats the joke
---
Hippity hoppity, get off my property
---
Can someone explain to me what just happened? I just started playing this game, I have less than 50 hours
---
This one was entirely on them. It was a terrible challenge that was a week late and didn't serve the gameplay for Showdown
---
You‚Äôre awesome!
---
Hello Armanem, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cekf3w/small_map_bug_on_chalet_made_me_laugh_every_time/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Overloading your internet with random fluff to the point of it shutting down
---
This has nothing do to with him being echo lol he coulda been anyone behind that shield.
---
Soo cav on silent step? Cause that doesn't leave footprints or get scanned while active
---
She takes a lot of skill. Even if we ignore this 360 stuff that I haven‚Äôt the patience to get down. Playing a shield operator in itself takes skill in knowing how to position yourself to your teammates advantage, being accommodating for your team and allowing them to get frags, but also being an annoyance for you enemies. Clash in herself is designed, along with conventional shield play, to stall the attackers advance and to passively defend the sites. As a clash you need to know how to manipulate the enemy team by positioning yourself properly and working harmoniously with your team to give them space to stop attackers. If you don‚Äôt think that takes skill then you don‚Äôt deserve to play with a Clash or any other shield operator for that matter.
---
But not everyone is on. I'm sure people stopped playing because of the glitches and gadget removals.
---
Me diz aonde voc√™ vai, que eu vou varrendo...vou varrendo vou varrendo vou varrendo vou varrendo...
---
People who still complain about Jackal need to just get better at the game üòÇ
---
I'm just saying if you're standing in a mute jammer he should not be able to scan you. This happened to me the other day and I was extremely surprised.
---
Because the map was straight garbo
---
R/woooooosh
---
Bet
---
I don't notice a difference with mnk guys and I play in plat and have a friend who uses mnk and he's below me in rank
---
After reading this comment I went back to read it in Elmo‚Äôs voice despite already reading it bloodhound‚Äôs voice twice
---
What platform?
---
I figured it had something to do with quarantine since that's going to have 3 player squads.
---
How about some one that doesn't leave prints. Their gadget will then let them leave prints for a short time. Maybe something a like more general tacked on. More or less as situational as Warden.
---
I just unlocked a bipod for my shield
---
Oh wait
---
lul. Could maybe be a spinoff CBRN (lion and finka)? I dunno but this seems like a very cool op OC.
---
F- for grading this amazing picture
---
The map is a square of death and anti fun experiences.
---
This works in so many ways its actually transcendent
---
Lol Idk what went wrong there
---
We need someone with robot feet
---
Spaghetti code
---
Because people think it's unbalanced and not fun, even though it's a beautiful map and, quite frankly, my favorite.
---
Yo that look's cool I bet if he get's to the game he will be romenia lmao
---
Makes a siege game mode in Minecraft

Hello Fuze_Is_Dad, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cekgv3/100_cpu_usage_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What console are you playing on?
---
But can you spawnpeek with a bow?
---
A majority of maps were removed a while ago due to them not being competitively viable for the ranked rotation. You can see the current ranked pool by looking at the in game ranked guide and heading to the maps section.
---
Not anymore
---
You should try j√§gers 416 Carbine!
---
and your mother
---
Bwiiiiiiiiiiiii^iiiiiiii
---
Yeah lol. Trust me Xbox is wheat cut from PS4‚Äôs chaff. Nothing but young kids yelling ‚ÄúHKACXKS IM REPORTNG U R TRSH KID‚Äù that I‚Äôm pretty sure haven‚Äôt even hit puberty yet
---
Happy Cake Day! üç∞
---
How do you put who you main on your name?
---
Because then it'd have to be a Cricket skin.
---
Fun fact: Bartlett is currently the ONLY map in the game not in rotation at all.
---
Ps4
---
I haven't seen art this fine since Pam Beasley.
---
True, as well as Dokk's and Vigil's, but I was more referring to standard buck-shot shotguns
---
Personally, I think that he's look even better in the Mariners green alternate.
---
This man is a master artist
---
The only significant change would be to actually reduce his tracking time. 20 seconds is just too much. And he has 3 charges. Which means you can track people for a total of 1 minute.
