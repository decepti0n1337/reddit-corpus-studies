What do you guys think? he is making a really big sledge kill compilation, I thought it was pretty funny!: [https://www.twitch.tv/mrpriceo0](https://www.twitch.tv/mrpriceo0)

---
this workload is nothing. BF4 was a disaster and DICE LA worked their ass off for 2 years and fixed most issues. Siege has less problems and it takes forever for Ubisoft to fix anything, and even then it seems big problems are only ever addressed when esports start crying about it.
---
Ok
---
But every player I encountered few past weeks? That sounds a bit stretched...
---
Not anymore. 
---
Fuze is one of the weakest operators out there, his gadget is easy to avoid, he’s slow and clunky too. Only thing he has really going for him is a extremely good assault rifle it’s insane how good it is but as it’s on a 3 armour it’s not that good.
---
That’s exactly what my match was like, last two were Cav and clash
---
The one with the theme park, it's when I bough r6
---
I didn't know we were getting one each weekend. That sounds like a decent deal, especially since you can get more through challenges
---
Yes, jem.
---
Nice 
---
But almost every player in my games for the past few weeks? Why is everyone using party chat all of a sudden?

too much brain cells 4 these enemiez 
---
Happened at Halloween too 
---
Because she's infuriating to play against
---
It unlocked on its own. Check your feed in the bottom left to see what you unlocked.
---
Ela is Thicccc Ash is thic at best 
---
I cannot buy R6 credit for some reason :(( anyone having the same problem?
---
That's why I almost TK'd him and didn't go through with it.
---
I'm literally having this problem too i don't care about the game anymore i just want some drones
---
some sjw cuck
---
Dokkaebi Asian&gt;White
---
Still looks cool though
---
M870.... on the test server.
---
They changed them ages ago 
---
I’ve had the same voice com trouble, where can I find the extended services in settings?
---
Did they add pick/ban to ranked?
---
New mode? Sorry must have missed the update.
---
So if I’m using a button in my mouse for gadgets I can get banned? 
---
It says 0 
---
There’s nothing there 
---
this, is the largest of oofs
---
Yep, Fuze is underwhelming. His speed, deploy time, and loud deploy sound make him really bad. He's only usfuel against people without any awareness. 
---
Idk I use all his weapons. I just think his gadget needs to be nerfed. It's not fair to encounter, even with a Jager
---
I like the playlist but the lack of killcams is driving me insane.
---
My brother and I play on ps4 and yesterday he banned The Mighty Chanka, maybe you were in the same match.
---
They dont show up in the feed for some reason. Go through and check each character
---
Man hands
---
Shouldve Messaged Him To Leave 🤔
---
literally everyone i play ranked with have bomb as the only mode enabled and queue times aren't long for me (gold 2)
---
I also don't understand how this would reduce the number of ranked players.
---
Did that 
---
If you’re talking about speaking then I feel you but I’m talking about how no one can hear you.
---
Yeah when I was getting my 300BLK pistol cerakoted white, I opted for a slight distressed look since a perfectly white finish is gonna last all of 1 range trip. Has held up pretty well. 
---
Yes.
---
Rip the new players
---
Dear god there’s so much wrong with this.
---
Yes. The people above me have really good points. He’s slow and his ability is pretty fucking loud, 
---
I haven't played in a long time. Is this guy basically just a wireless bandit or is this a bug? Why would anyone play Bandit with this guy in the game?
---
Clearly they picked it 
---
Restart game. Should do it. 
---
Holly fock
---
the only people who complain about ash mains are bad players
---
hence why "lion is a waste"
---
Not when his pellets ricochet across the map 
---
I haven't touched the shop tab for a while, but the new 2019 packs gave me a reason to. But now I cannot buy anymore :( Anyone having the same problems?
---
Shit to play and shit to play against
---
Yeah, that's deserving. If my team has a Cav, any downed enemy is offered to her for interrogation, regardless of how downed them. But if she just shoots them instead, the match then becomes 4v6.
---
He only gets 2
---
because the new playlist is still like casual right now, hes not even gone from ranked lol
---
I personally think that switching each round is the most fair, but then again I am not a PL player
---
We joined mid game and were given the operators as random picks, I have a video of joining the lobby that I could gif or something. Not sure if Recruit is even available to pick in the new mode, could be wrong.
---
I have duplicated the aug black ice 3 times :(
---
So from my experience, Blitz tends to be a big problem for two groups of players. 
---
Silvers/Bronzes who dont really know how to deal with him, and Diamonds. Diamonds issue is that everyone is in a 5 stack, that Blitz is never alone, and probably knows all the tricks in the book not to have stupid things happen. 
---
Speaking personally as a Diamond, the issue with Blitz is i cant have a genuine gunfight with him and end up losing alot of engagements on the sole basis that they had a Blitz. People always assume you just double team the Blitz, without realising the way many top teams play him is to double team each individual player one by one. Its actually a well known military strategy for how to win with small armys, and the issue is you have to focus on the Blitz to kill him - which is not something you can do when being double teamed. 
---
Blitz is part of what id describe as the standard 5 stack in toxic Diamond teams. Blitz, Jackel, Dokkabi, Lion, and usually an Ash or Finka. Many of these teams dont even bother with a Thermite, and you'll be surprised how often you play them when in your own squad of Diamonds. 
---
Yea Blitz has a negative win delta in PC plat/diamond, maybe he's harder to counter on console ?
---
r/woooosh
---
I've honestly had no issues taking a couple shocks just to break them.
---
Huh actually you're probably right about it not being available 
---
Oh, so it works just like that Halloween Event we had last year?
---
I see you have managed to tame the Legendary P90
---
Its cause I havent been on recently, when I get back into it youll see me playing kaid again.
---
Cuz under prize there’s a picture of a pack and I don’t bother reading things
---
It’s a very small bit of the radius that sticks out, so it’s difficult to get them far apart. Usually when I do this, I just use 1
---
You can still get outbreak packs?
---
I think there should be an option to include the other current rank maps if you want to. I know they arent popular among a lot of people, but I love those maps and I would be pretty annoyed if I couldnt play them in ranked
---
so fucking dont then. They dont deserve it. Spend your money on an actual game instead of this trash. Maybe buy an actual game not just some cosmetic garbage. 
---
Dont care if it’s the meta. It’s blasphemy. Casual or not, I would’ve teamkilled. 
---
The problem is that they are on ranked do lock them to it you give them what they want 
---
To bad  xbox now has their own official mouse and keyboard for the xbox. Whoops
---
How would you detect bring toxic though?
---
Alright, I'll have to check it out. Thanks!
---
No. It was made for pro league and it should stay that way. It's fun to play this mode but ranked should stay as it is now, so I'd say they should implement this new mode as a third one (like captain's mode in Dota 2). 
---
Anywhere below mid gold people will ban completely random operators because of lack of skill and game knowledge, while anywhere above that people will ban certain five or six operators with plat and higher banning the exact four operators all the time rendering them completely irrelevant and breaking the whole p/b point.
---
Moreover, the toxic community will start fighting each other and teamkilling over someone's ban choice or opinion, or even leave the game because they only like to play Ash and she got banned. 
---
So, this should be a third permanent mode with no ranks, and the only thing the current ranked needs is more vanilla maps. 
---
Pairing to PC players is the only solution 
---
They should let us play casual with what ever day setting we want. Either, night, day dusk, Dawn, and lobby specific. So that players can have the random night and day settings with lobby specific which is consistent with everyone else or have it on a specific setting of their choice.
---
It's a seperate gamemode with some of the features from pro league
---
Honestly Id rather see the 1 headshot kill mechanic go before shields. It's fundamentally pretty flawed and takes so much out of the game. 
---
More mechanics != more skillful play.
---
A twitch popped my Mira earlier today, I was not happy.
---
Yeah but people me included don’t get that involved in game chat when their new to the game in most tips and tricks video your told to stack up anyway
---
My god we absolutely need it. Every single Road to SI game is a Plat 1 Ash rush every single round.
---
No, because that's a button on its own being mouse 4 and 5. I'm talking about macros that control recoil for you and other things like that.

I thought the aspect ratio looked really wide on my phone, then I realized you were playing as Amy fat boi Rook and fully understood why.
---
Blitz rushes you. You try to run, he shoots you in the back. You stand your ground, he charges you and blinds you then shoots/melees you. Most people don't have the aim to hit his shoulders or legs constantly and hes fast AF.

This isn’t really related to the post, but is it possible to look behind a teammate pulse’s shoulder and read his heartbeat detector?
---
You think House is balanced?
---
Faulty macro
---
Tysm that helps a lot! 
---
Imagine being copper
---
I think you mean Kaid trick.
---
And it's not at all nigh impossible to Kaid trick. Just like with Bandit tricking, you have to be actively listening for the Thermite to be placed, and you absolutely have enough time.
---
One thing Bandit has over Kaid, though, is that a Kaid trick can be prevented with a Thatcher EMP, whereas you can't stop a Bandit trick aside from outright killing him.
---
Do people do that IRL? I don't think so, it looks completely retarded and ridiculous. She already looks like a walking brown turd, no need to make her worse.
---
yeah
---
Pretty sure
---
Real Tachanka mains set the turret up on the roof.
---
it's a special playlist for the invitational event. the other gamemodes are as normal
---
Well with the proposed changes to ranked, who knows?
---
Regular Gold 
---
Wait pick and ban can change an entire game for instance if both hibana and thermite is banned you don’t have a hard breacher that can open up large holes and if echo and valk are banned it’s a whole lot harder to get info as a defender
---
she also has a lower pick rate than Tachanka. 
---
Of course

Really tho how
---
Those are just made to look simplistic on purpose 
---
Your welcome :)
---
Really do you want to play only 7 maps, it's ridiculous how people like you and everybody in this forum loves that Ubisoft remove maps, what a shame.
---
I can neither confirm or deny your question.
---
Gourd?
---
Hah, it actually is a weird aspect ratio. I play in 4:3 lately.
---
Am I irrationally too scared of electrifying barbed wire on hostage, cuz they could drop it in it and win?
---
So I can sell my rig on ebay?
---
Further proves my point that console players fucking suck lol
---
I mean, look at ranked and how people rarely leave, and then take casual's ability to fill in those empty spots in those rare 4v5s!
---
... jokes aside, you're ignoring the other half of the picture. Punishing people for leaving heavily reduces the frequency in which they leave. And the beautiful thing about casual is you can punish those players for leaving and still allow backfill. Rainbow6 does neither of these things and has one of the worst casual environments i've ever played in as a result (in terms of a huge number of games you join being backfills, and in the sense that games are often not balanced as nobody backfills in time; not general toxicity).
---
2 very different kind of games placed under the umbrella term of “tactical FPS”
---
Ive been in a game where both Thermite and Hibby were banned and It was not fun in the slightest. Sure Maverick is there, but without a reliable hard breacher no one could win the attack rounds so it just became who got lucky and was on defense for 4-4 overtime. 
---
Is the kaid electric current supposed to be able to go through a solid non metal wall and still be able to interact with barb wire I mean I’m confused af
---
Where’s ur Acog ?
---
But it isn’t an opinion. Castle barricades aren’t used to waste time, especially at higher levels. You’re talking about giving up utility like maestro turrets or yokais to stop 3 attackers for 12 seconds. I’ve been playing competitively for about a year now and that just isn’t something that people do. I’m listening to what you’re saying, but it’s just wrong, even if it is your opinion. Encouraging people to pick castle to block off entrances into site and to waste time is not something you should be doing. Castle is used to block off common angles and crossfire. That’s what he is used for at pro league. You’re instilling bad habits on to players so ofc I’m going to say something
---
I lul’d at the jocker poster
---
thanks.
---
I know that FPS feel 😥
---
awesome.
---
lmao , yeah it does look bad .
---
Is it just me or is a electric claw still nearly impossible to find even when it’s near the actual barb wire when your on attack 
---
Rook an fuze are fun 
---
And what are you, a diamond? How special.
---
i love you
---
I’ve used fuse a bit as well as rook. Not a huge fan of shields 
---
But if you shotgun the floor near the wall you can watch white stairs as mira and that would basically lock them out of the stairs
---
No I said it’s fun but the comment states that fun=balanced though so...
---
Nomad jäger and sometimes doc only when my team needs it (and when I'm solo queuing
---
But the. People would find the most Camoed skin is *whiny voice* and then it would be unbalanced *whiny voice*
---
Well at least they are honest with themselves. -shrug-
---
Forgot ash 
---
I dont know why but i have still boost when you claim normal community chalenges. I always told my self that I will use it when i have free time, whinter break has been finnished and I still have it in main menu.
---
I don't understand how in the hell ranked is still in beta... it's been years ubi, ffs
---
Just because you have an excuse for it I’m game doesn’t mean that it won’t be a problem because bad matchmaking is clearly not the issue in pro league
---
I got put into 4 ongoing games on villa in a row last night.
---
The One eye pirate god.
---
I love Jäger. I’ve used doc a little bit but I’m not a huge fan. I haven’t got the chance to use nomad yet 
---
New cosmetics incoming after the SI. Handskins for credits will be available so everyone can spend more money to polish their new skins.
---
Guessing SAS ops
---
Capitao or something?
---
Lol yes.
---
Legit made me laugh out loud
---
but dude it's \*skill\*
---
no, you have to find people who are selling them, and even then it's sketchy and pricy
---
Nope
---
Yeah it’s a waste of a ban, I hardly run into her in normal games
---
No, not at this time.
---
But when all of the pro-leagues are finished, Ubi *might* release older ones.
---
Is that a psycho mask from bl2 i see?
---
Lel all matches I got in were 1-3 matches
---
Have they ever done that before?
---
He only plays under my supervision.
---
A lot of people are leaving mid match because they're getting shit on because of the matchmaking, leaving lots of open space.
---
Yah it is
---
As a mute main, I cry in joy when a twitch drone drives into my jammer.
---
See, I hear this all the time, yet I find myself constantly matched with coppers and bronze, and ranked against gold/plat/diamond. I rarely get higher than a gold 3 on my team, and it's so irritating. For reference, my last few seasons have been a combination of Gold 1/2 and Plat 3 (I stayed in gold because I basically did my placements, then couldn't be arsed doing any more to get my rank up).
---
It's really about finding someone who fits your playstyle, some operators gadgets are better geared toward certain roles on the team and finding what role you like and using a gadget that supports that playstyle will help your game.
---
That's unfortunate 
---
And the discovery playlist is super unstable. I've had more crashes in the past day than I have since WB started
---
Oh it was a 4-0. They couldnt infiltrate anything and didnt even blow any hatches. It was a clusterfuck
---
Well im probably going to get a lot of hate for this but Im a crouch spammer :^) Looks like I have to learn to play now
---
Pfft that's unlucky man. I mean don't get me wrong, my usual casual experience has no communication really. But on the SI playlist in particular it feels fairly balanced and fairly competitive. It's a nice balance between sweaty and casual for me personally.
---
Yeah I'm the ash.
---
bruh bruhhh
---
 https://i.imgur.com/9UgSU3I.jpg 
---
I’m going to send him the link to this lmao 
---
Huh. I think there’s some kind of connection with the Elite skin. Imma assume you had that equipped?
---
Fatigue system incoming? The more you spam the slower it gets?
---
I love that ubi refuse to even acknowledge that client side debris and bodies are massive problem in a competitive game.
---
Trying to be hip and rad with the new kids
---
Nope. I had the default skin equipped.
---
my team and the enemy team will always ban blitz, lion, cav, clash/echo
---
1.2 is shit bro
---
Oof when he turns around and it hits the shield
---
But I’m Canadien
---
*Maniacally rubs palms and waits*
---
Right but with the invitational skin
---
Scoliosis 
---
What in tarnation... I head you can now have elite animations with the SI skins on, perhaps they did an oopsie &amp; now the skins are linked. This is super weird.
---
I don't know why they changed it. It looks like shit now. 
---
Wait what.
---
You guys probably just call it a manicure lol
---
Thanks for leaving this subreddit and going to r/mylittlepony !
---
Greased up dead guy, you mean
---
Yeah I was super confused. When I saw it, I was like, what is that skin?!?!?
---
As a twitch main I make myself mad by also being a bandit main
---
Fuck yeah
---
I mean I don’t play Ash, like, **ever** but I’d be real happy. It’s a good fuckup by Ubisoft!
---
I believe you automatically wear the SI uniforms in the limited mode.
---
I had a bomber follow me up there once (Pre-Nomad days) and it scared the shit outta me.
---
tag doesnt check out
---
I'll try,last question btw mate,who's the modt underrated one on thiccness besides clash?
---
It’s expiring. 
---
If you throw it *Right* when he deploys it , you'll destroy it
---
The thiccening 
---
Just do what CS:GO does, put a cooldown on the lean and crouch by making it slower the more often you use it within a certain amount of time to the point where it won't even let you lean/crouch.
---
I want to test this.
---
Get in loser, we're going spawnpeeking.
---
yeah i get that, which is one of the reasons I want a post game replay system. 
---
I suppose Ying ain’t too **t h i c c** if you look at her ingame model.
---
yeah, its one of those cases where, it doesn't have a huge affect, its just super fucking annoying.
---
The attacking team would like to know your location
---
Hm,what about ash/iq?
---
Legit if they just halved the price for these they'd make wayyyy more profit.
---
The plot thiccens 
---
I wish there was a way to get really sweaty without having to deal with broken and obnoxious ops. I enjoy tryharding but I wish there was a way to do it without having to run into shit like Lion
---
first time?
---
?
---
Owie zowie

Macros and spamming are two different things
---
[removed]
---
[Laughs in Cav]
---
this happens alot in this game, get used to it
---
Lookin like she boutta suck a dick😂
---
I don't usually care at all about my K/D ratio because I suck at gunplay and work better in a team where I can play utility or intel like Valk or Thermite, but I actually ran into this the other day.
---
Some smurf in casual was ridiculing my K/D ratio for the match. It wasn't phenomenal (it never is), but literally half of my assists were downs I got that someone else finished off. I didn't mind, though, because I know I suck and I managed to pull off a Frost/Bandit wombo combo at the top of some steps that game, so that was satisfying.
---
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 Hahaha 
---
I used to roll with Blackbeard, he’s good at point and angles and can pack some heat. He’s good for support and perfect for someone who’s learning the ropes but I’d say you should get good with him then move on to someone more advanced. 
---
Because not everyone enjoys only playing one game mode on only 7 maps out of almost 20. 
---
You guys simply do not want to see the Photoshop of this screen I've done. 
---
What a nutcase face she's pulling haha
---
This is a meme that I don't quite get. I feel like I don't see him very often/ he doesn't seem overpowered
---
low blow
---
Well not anymore it isn't
---
I love the AR33! Using the 2 round burst with an acog sight is dead on and awesome!
---
Haha *chugs a beer*
---
I agree to this. If they are going to keep it, it needs to be the third game mode available.  
---
  
---
I too want more variety in matches. Wouldn't even mind if they brought plane/house/favela back in ranked. Also playing secure and even hostage is refreshing.
---
Auto correct... thanks for pointing it out
---
I never said the jammers were just on the same floor me, I know how those things work.
---
Lmao np
---
I never said the jammers were just on the same floor me, this isn't my first match.
---
Uuuhhhh, ok. You do you.
---
90's cup skin

Wow nice thanks

Awesome spot! Ill be using this when i can now :)

You know that buying it on a new steam account won't change anything.
---
It has to be a new Ubisoft account
---
LORD never die 
---
Toxic
---
But
---
Whats wrong with me guys...i thought i was balanced....
---
Siege has hitscan ballistics and often inconsistent patterns, plus the balance isn't great. PUBG beats it in every way except animation.
---
Most of the times I'm being flanked and I fail easy shots. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI53oYonJAw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI53oYonJAw) at the end u Will see some footage of me playing t Hunt 1 month ago. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz8P\_IuQY9k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz8P_IuQY9k) here u can see some footage of me playing with high ping
---
I'm using the same characters and when I'm 1vs4 or 1vs5 I did it easily but I can't get a single kill in all the match
---
Wait Blitz wasn't banned despite the fact he's not even that good
---
Anything’s possible, it might explain why she wanted to join the military 
---
In my opinion it will be Lesion.
---
1)One of the best cameras in the games, just remember where you place the gu and find it out when you hear their screams.  
---
2)Easy secure kill for frost traps.  
---
3)8 deployments, that can be fast thrown at distance.  
---
4)They are "invisible".  
---
5)Slows down enemies.  
---
6)Deal 10 damage and Drain health over time if not taken out, while taking it out exposes you to the enemy.  
---
7)While you can't rely that match on the ping from Prisma, because it could be closer o higher, just behind that soft wall or behind that unbreakable wall, you allways can hold an angle at this soft wall and you're sure that person is just right there where you placed the Gu, so you can aim right there, which is not possible with Prisma, unless someone walks into it.  
---
8)For sure you will have enough Gu's to cover all the entrances to the point/points.  
---
9)More cooperation possibilities than Alibi.  
---
\-You can have a Valkyrie so you can sit on cameras and place Gu near you teammates and just inform them as an anchor while they will rush the enemy while they enter Gu  
---
\-Echo stopping people from taking out Gu  
---
\-Frost traps(I play with impacts, but the Lesion can be useful with Frost in two ways. Securing the kill with Gu When enemy fall into the trap and placing a shield in the doors so Frost can put the trap behind)  
---
\-Kapkan for more damage at once, but you must place Gu correctly to not get it destroyed  
---
While I find Alibi mostly useful with C4 users, which can kill a pinged person even from below. But it is still something you can do on enemies that steped into a Gu, you just do not have a visible indicator like ping from Alibi, so you must rely on info that Lesion gives and eventually on what you can hear.
---
TL;DR Lesion is better, especially if you use microphone.
---
Objectively Buck is better at destruction but Sledge is better at getting in quietly. But it's honestly personal preference.
---
You have been permanently banned for toxic behavior
---
Dang it but I hope it does :)

I like it... but why would Ubi make skins for older seasons?

This on console or pc, in practice pc is generally less toxic, as for how to find less toxicity, I try to make friends with everyone/be pleasant. Otherwise I queue with a friend and we beat down the toxics together. 
---
What if I’m a twitch-Mira main?
---
Gross, plz no
---
You wot 
---
He didn't mention Ash's hitbox so at least they listened
---
Oh damn, I've always wanted to do this, but I was pretty sure I would get killed immediately. Welp, thanks for providing my instinct correct, haha.
---
I've seen a few. They aren't common, but they're there.
---
in theory the 3d charms would look really good but where siege was with graphics they didn't execute properly, DEFINITELY if they maybe triee to do the 3d charms now it might be a hit, but i also have hated the charms since chimera
---
Are you playing on Xbox? If so I can help tomorrow
---
Why the fuck is everyone banning Cav? What is going on she's never been top tier 
---
Kick...
---
I hope not. I'd rather not have the game I enjoy advertise them.
---
Dude trust me I just got done trying to explain why he is broken to someone in game and some people just don't get it.
---
Can't kick someone in ranked, see my problem??
---
You hit top left, top left and then the recoil bouced from neck to above head feels bad man
---
If it was server side the server would literally explode
---
Clash all the way 
---
It's late, and I understand your high. 
---
Happens every other game on OCE servers 
---
I guess all that I’m thinking is, I know the difference between you’re and your:)
---
Here's another. Sitting at 36H 9M (354 enemies blinded). He was always my favorite. Then shields broke to an even worse state for quite some time.
---
That's bullying.
---
You get more than one?
---
restart game
---
Yes, by completing the weekend challenge.
---
Same brother same...
---
1000h on the game (Xbox and PC)
---
30h on ranked
---
The nomad ass was worth it 
---
I think his point is that this playlist doesn't take into account factors that other playlists seem to.
---
i’ve been 1 win off plat 2 5 different times and everyone i get paired against absolute prodigy’s. i once got a pro player
---
OMG xD
---
BuT bLitZ iSnT eVeN Op
---
Its rNgesus... dont cry pls
---
Bro the music plus Ash I'm sorry but not my thing
---
Finally they talked about it..
---
Picking spawn would help noobs learn the game quicker, I've got friends with 200 hrs who don't know names of the rooms because they only play casual, and only like once or twice a week.
---
This is Gold elo for anyone wondering
---
Why do i need to go through 100 useless posts to see such a useful post? Thanks..
---
Cries "I was just following the feet 🤤"
---
Probably got it when you missed too much so you impacted it.
---
Im new and ive had a very positive experience for my first 100+ hrs. I unno what people are talking about. Maybe like 1 out of 20 games i have someone being an ass. I can just mute toxic people so its ok. Overall very good experience compared so what im used to
---
Looks at him through wall. Controller disconnects. Jumps through window then snaps straight onto his head. That would’ve been a report if i died. 
---
you get 3 more tries, good luck.
---
I don't use Ash often but I did in this case and look what I did. And the music, well everyone has his own taste.
---
Not quite sure, because I didn't buy all parts at the same time. I would estimate that it is somewhere around 1.6-1.8k
---
Same.
---
At least the challenge worked for you lol. Played three days in a row and it hasn't updated from 5 drones yet
---
Yep. Most people are playing y1 ops rn, probably because of the discount on them?
---
Fair. Good clip tho 👍
---
None of the graphics settings are CPU dependant so there's not much you can do. Since you have an RX 560, which isn't exactly a mega cheap card, why not pick up an i7 2600 or something like that to go with it? Wouldn't need to change any of the other components. 
---
Great!
---
F
---
I didn't see the stream. What happened?
---
Its also easy to tell who the ash mains are cinsidering they leave as soon as she gets banned 
---
Yeah it looked sketchy for sure, he sent me a message saying "uhhhh?" And I replied back to him telling him that I've reported myself.
---
I didn't know him, the stuff looks really interesting tho
---
\*laughs in explosives
---
Not sure what you mean, care to explain?
---
Should of tk’d
---
Have us chose starting locations in casual and pick and ban in ranked. 
---
Lol it’s just funny they’re really be Blackbeard mains out there
---
The true anti hack system does exist it's called "Consoles." On PC however it will likely always remain a constant arms race between hackers and the anti cheat system. For every exploit the devs patch 2 more crop up for hackers to abuse.
---
You definitely have not played ranked, there are people who scream like hell because they care about MMR so much. Teamkilling is extremely rare even in Gold.
---
No. Because incapacitated operator still can hide behind the cover and work as a bait, so killing them may pose a certain degree of risk and threat to the one, who intends to go for an "easy" kill. 
---
One shouldn't get a full reward for an unfinished job, IMO.

---
I would definitely do that if they weren't a shield. Just prefire the mirror before it breaks. On a shield it's pretty hard. Also, I swear the mirror popping sound got quieter.
---
If you crouch spam while jumping you will glitch through the floor and have an immediate angle on the spiral stairs door
---
You should have rotated it so Clash's face is in the bottom left corner. It just makes more logical sense
---
Now if only they could fix the RNG spread for the shotguns it would be great. 
---
Shotgun rework when?
---
I looked at this picture looking for him longer then I would like to admit.
---
Do you have the link to the footage where they abuse the heck out of it? Really want to see that.
---
Yeah i cant play BF anymore because there isnt a lean button. It just seems so stale and unrealistic. 
---
Locked due to spammers.
---
Same here haha
---
Check my profile I have a post explaining the way to limit it, you are welcome 
---
Famous last words.
---
Don't be hard on them.
---
It was their first kill ever in the game.
---
Two times reddit outrage has been justified so far. 
---
The aestetic changes and the dropshotting. Crouch spamming needs to be fixed too, so make it three times. 
---
Mom said it was my turn on the Xbox.
---
so you're telling me you didn't ask him to sign your boobs
---
Why do you need an excuse to tk then surely the team understands.
---
Fuze says stand still when he revive someone
---
HEY GAMERBRAHS 
---
If I have boobs then probably but since I don’t then no😂😂
---
10/10
---
I think it is possible, depending on where exactly you put it.
---
Gotta add ash too yeknow
---
thanks
---
Yeah I realize that and how he got 2000 blows my mind even after the Nerf but I'm just saying that if he is trying for hours now than I have around 700 
---
Mute jammers stop his flashes from working.
---
but pretty much for getting all the charms :D
---
Or at least only count in game time towards the booster clock. Come on UBI they're fake energy drinks how the fuck am I meant to stay up 24 hours without a real one lol.
---
I had the same thought lol
---
That ass tho
---
Never happened to me with thermite, only happens that an open wall can’t be walked through
---
Outstanding move
---
Nerf blitz so I can play him again
---
Next season... Ranked. Real shit?
---
Wow it should be kept in as a separate mode. Ranked as it is, is in a good spot with the exception of the skill based matchmaking. O well
---
Holy shit I didn't know Cris Kyle owned a sledgehammer 
---
I could tell you, but then I’ll have to kill you
---
I love doing that to people I get a kick out of it all the time when they waste 2 Mags on my drone
---
Gsync ;)
---
You will NOT lose progress. Simply uninstall starter reinstall standard then login to ubi. I have done this multiple times before guaranteed. 
---
Yea, it gets old fast. There should be a huge change made to the way Club challenges work imo. Make it so we can actually earn Alpha packs by doing challenges instead of having to rely entirely on RNG to get them. Also make the challenges actually challenging, not just "Shoot 50,000 drones because fuck thinking of new ideas." The one challenge where you have to get a certain amount of score in a match is the only real challenge that I know of. The rest are just boring little things that pay out the exact same amount of renown every time.
---
They’re leavers cuz they don’t get banned and there’s no ranking system. 
---
Cav was a buff for mid to low skill players though
---
Also I'm xbox
---
 If you have only mute, you need destroy all walls around hatch.  
---
If you have Kaid you can reinforce that wall but you still need destroy walls around it.  
---
If you don't have Kaid and mute reinforce it anyway because it takes much more utility from attackers.  
---
P.S. Kaid can do same trick as bandit here, because when tacher throw his emp u can see light from below, and take Rtila back at that moment.  
---
P.S.s. as tacher u can just throw emp nearby at hatch. 
---
Yeah I people seem to be braindead and ban op's like thermite/bandit/echo. People seem to believe like bans only hurt the opposite team.
---
The lengths they went to for one drone... 
---
The whole idea of switching sides after 3 rounds is basically shit. Especially after you get drawn into attacking team 3 times a row.
---
?? You have 3 seconds to move before lion scans you, add a drone to that and it basically eliminates those 3 seconds too.
---
some casual players are just....
---
Uh..... why would you ever want to limit it? Unless you get really low super stuttery framerate?
---
Because well, there’s this pistol she has, that if you end up being in CQ with her, gives you no time to react because you’re on the floor and now being interrogated.
---
ThIs gAmE iS eZ jUSt AiM bEtTeR IM pLAt I
---
Why especially on coastline? Bcuz of the long angles?
---
Yeah some players are just like play 3 rounds on defence and then leave
---
Oh my Lord that is amazing i love you 
---
It shouldn't, but sadly it is.
---
Unfortunately there isnt really any sort of "clone" of siege and nothing really is quite like siege, so us fans of siege sort of have to suck it up as there's really no other substitute for siege. 
---
Also no one thinks about from solo players prespective ,someone hasnt even read the pist but downvotted
---
Thank God.
---
Can easily be changed to hold the left or right on the dpad.
---
Yes it should have been normal like 1 round attack 1 round defence that would make people play full game and not leave after 3 defence rounds
---
Yes, there are people all over the spectrum with all different sens.
---
I got the Thatcher charm, which is the worst one, every other charm is pretty good, but no, had to get a medallion with an anchor engraving.
---
BTW, anyone figured out what the coordinates on the Mira charm point to?
---
If they gave us tactical realism combined with this in a ranked playlist, the game'd be perfect.
---
The same thing happened to me 
---
Yknow, i have the exact same problem and if i didnt id be like "slow internet" but my internet is usually pretty good, seige runs awful
---
You always get morons that abandon after their w+m1 Ash rush fails in the first 15 seconds.
---
I personally love the new game mode and hope they leave it in permanently. 
---
Breaking that wall makes it much harder for thermite or hibana to get the wall. Most of the time you can completely stop them from breaking that hatch with either a mute or kaid.
---
Taking out and holding the heartbeat sensor has finally paid off
---
[deleted]
---
Dude, Pros hate shield ops in their current implementation. 
---
If you don't get them you still gotta pay 59 bucks.
---
I want all anyways since I'm more of a collector. Imma spend 50 bucks rn on credits and first collect all free ones and then buy the rest. And possibly an elite skin too
---
They don't leave as much as in this game mode
---
I partly agree but there are maps where you know that there's an 90% chance of seeing these ops, origon I know I'm most likely to see a mira and jager on defence and habbana (started being replaced by thermite due to kiad at times) thather, Witch gives you a starting point to think on. There's also the times you read why they want a certain op banned and counter that with another ban. Say we're playing on chalet and they ban a jager there's a few options they could be thinking about, glaz - to get smokes down with no worrys, nomad - air jab around corners to give time to push into an area without worry or ying - flash and clear with no worrys. Although I do see where your coming from and I got bored of all the lion and blitz banned games. 
---
Or just use one Rtila
---
A tank is thanking your tank for thanking h's tank as he thanked your tank for thanking his tank
---
Its an anti-aim
---
But most teams will just bring a thatcher, rendering Laid and Mute pretty much useless, I know my team always does. If the wall is reinforced they have to use note utility to open it to get sightlines through to the common laundry rotation, whereas if its already opened all the have to do is open the hatch and voilà.
---
Thanks
---
You can’t vote to kick in rank, so your story isn’t adding up.
---
Robert Kotick’s plot is truly magnificent 
---
coming from someone with 3,000+ hours, I’ve never been tk’d for instinctively nailing a downed enemy. If I see movement and there is no friendly outline, dead. Period. This must be a copper-bronze thing, because I don’t know what the fuck you all are talking about
---
Really like that middle one.
---
Probly why it has no cheaters? The ban system is doing its job
---
completely remove lean and crouch spam.
---
Maybe try contacting customer support?
---
He doesn’t need a nerf, he isn’t really hard to deal with just annoying, he shines in close quarters, Is absolutely destroyed in medium rang and he can’t do anything in long range.
---
If he were nerfed he wouldn’t be worth playing, he almost isn’t, and just because he’s banned often, ash and lion are banned often, they don’t need nerf, just because he’s annoying doesn’t

From what I’ve been seeing so far everyone bans the most useless ops that no one even plays. I.e. lion and blitz. When you can get rid of bandit, mute, thermite, and hibana and change the whole meta and how the game is played. But no everyone bans lion and blitz. 
---
When it was released back in 2015 I guess. I have all Season Passes, fire skin from beta, etc. Back in the day it had a lot of problems with spawnpeeking and stuff, people played it like regular arcade shooter, not really much changed in terms of playstyle. People main Ash, crouch and lean spam to kill other people. Tactics is SWAT3, original RS, RS3, but its definitely not Siege.

I tried, they’re not even being sold by third party sellers
---
I feel like ash and lion are very bad examples here.
---
Damn...
---
pretty sure r/gamingcirclejerk would love to have you. 
---
It is, its used to melee
---
He is easy to kill, all you have to do is be accurate or pack a shotgun, In case your wondering I do play on console and have never had a problem with him, why do pc player just complain when an operator is annoying instead of learning hw to kill them.
---
Mity is a pro, I felt so out of place haha
---
&gt; but it's only cosmetics 
---
It's not just that. The main problem people would be having with paid Alpha Packs(and the problem we have with these time limited, paid only bullshit packs) is gambling. Paid lootboxes pray on people who have/had any form of gambling addiction.
---
You, people on this sub, and most people outside of this sub have absolutely no problem with paying real money to DIRECTLY purchase XY skin that you like, but when they ask money for a CHANCE to get that one skin you like, now that's not okay. 
---
But the real question is: does Hibana feel the same for Pulse?
---
They’re actually amazing.
---
Blitz has been bye bye every match for me. Echo and Hibana get axed a lot also. 
---
ikr
---
This keeps me up at night. Thanks for this post. 
---
I’ve never experienced this and I’ve been playing the mode since launch. 
---
At least she should stop running.... /s
---
&gt; Retroactively giving the veterans missing alpha packs will be a hassle
---
Not really, it would be fairly easy to do so, but Ubi knows that many players would get "too much" Alpha Packs, which could possibly reduce MTX Sales of the game.
---
I said rook but my post just vanished
---
That makes sense i’ve been trying to switch so say i’m going left then i have my ring finger hit A and middle finger on Q and pointer on E. Then if i’m going right i have my pointer on D, middle on E, and Ring finger on Q it’s just hard trying to not to mix them up and coordinating fingers to press down different buttons all at the same time. Definitely gonna take some hours to get used to it.
---
Well they’re probably banned the same amount if not more on the case of lion, even then ubi knows about blitz, they also understand that he doesn’t need a nerf, If he were nerfed he would be up there with the worst operator.
---
Don’t want to seem picky or anything but can we also fix client side debris and/or bodies?
---
RIP friend 
---
Same, maybe it was because i started out on console. But to me the game did feel to have some aspect of tactics and strategy to it. I made the whole point in another comment above. Again, maybe that was just my experience. 
---
I see the same thing in PS4. I always just assumed it meant they were using mnk but that’s probably wrong lol. 
---
Eh, banning Jackal instead of Lion or Blitz, and banning Caveira instead of Lesion or Mira sounds like a wasted ban.
---
What's up with blitz being banned every time? I don't understand he isn't that hard to counter
---
She is just annoying to play against. 
---
Yeah this looks so foreign compared to pc
---
Game didnt really had such big emphasis on tactics. Yes, you can outplay your opponents with tactical approach, but it doesnt mean that game is not arcade shooter in its core. Its just shows now that you can play it like a Call of Duty (no offense to COD) and win games. It can be easier and more rewarding than tactical approach. If you someone wants tactics then 3 speed ops needs to go away first in my opinion. Still I dont think that people will agree in remaking the game to more tactical style with all that arcade things going away. I dont think game is bad, but its definitely not tactical and pretty much never will be, especially with developers plans.
---
I go add you my name is: rodrigorodas123
---
Did you end up winning the match?
---
Have a good cake day my dood 
---
These arent the official ones, just saying
---
good pint, some may dont have done this.
---
but its the challeneg where the cummonity need sto get 4kk drones, and were on 8kk already now(pc). i finished the 30drones already and got my pack from it, but not my pack from the 4kk drones kills, even if it says now its collected
---
When’s the last time you bought credits?
---
I have, I generally run with 1-2 mates but I have solo queued a lot as well on both PS4 and PC. 
---
It's quite decent. People tend to talk more on PC as you can use a private chat and still hear and talk in game chat. On console if people bunch up in a party they won't hear your chat so you never know if your calls are being heard. 
---
There will be annoying moments but I never struggled to reach a rank that I felt was appropriate for me (usually plat 1 - diamond). 
---
r/nocontext
---
yeah because you need a very good Bandit,Mute, Thermite or Hibana to win the game for their team but all it takes is a half decent Blitz or Lion to completely give the game for the attackers.
---
Umm not sure then soz man 😔
---
Well, they didn't ban Lion, Blitz, Doki, Glaz and Ying. It's real free estate bois
---
I 100% agree with you, while crouch/lean spam is cancerous, it isn't going to be enough to get you plat/diamond(-shroud) if you don't have any game sense. It'll definitely help you compensate for less game sense, but it can't completely make up for it. I know multiple diamonds with mediocre gun skills, but stupid amounts of game sense. On the flip side, I run into tons of insane aim in gold/plat games but just dumb players.
---
Thing is I’m terrible with most of them, i main the ones I usually get 4-5 kills per game with
---
Honestly, I don't mind lean spam nearly as much as the combo of crouch/lean spam.
---
reward is 1500 renown not a pack...
---
My FPS dropped by just looking at this picture
---
I think is the other way around.
---
sure its annoying to see, but not hard to get around once you are used to it.  not to mention mostly every clip i seen the issue wasnt the crouching, just terrible aim. Yesterday someone posted how its abused, and when you zoom in the guy was hitting a pillar in front of the spammer, and as he moved right the shooter just kept shooting the pillar, didnt even move.  we cant blame bad aim on things. and that is my point here. sure its annoying and most the time its from macros, which is supposed to be not allowed, that you see. but the clips i seen are usually just people wanting to blame something besides their aim. 
---
Translate, didint know that exists
---
I don't think on leaning I would like the accuracy debuff, but on crouch they could just copy what they did for proning if they wanted to.
---
Why is the text saying "no government"? Anarchy?
---
What more are you playing if it’s road to s i you can unfortunately
---
They are currently  aware of this issue.
---
This. I think the crouching is the real problem in the game rn. Leaning is annoying, but it has a counter called shooting the body and it's not nearly as hard to play against.
---
Oh okay then 😂 Oof.
---
Ehm, once the attacking team took control of Piano assuming they have Buck, Sledge it's real free estate my dude. Pipe and Vans could be forced to pull back then push yellow stairs with either Monty or Glaz. 
---
U cant buy 4 dlc ops for just 1200 r6 credits. lol whats the problem again?
---
That's impressive, especially for a Tachanka main XD 
---
Thanks!
---
it’s only available during the weekends, so the playlist might not be available right now
---
They didn't even fully fix shield problems.
---
What if you could disable 2-3 of your most hated maps but no more? Or maybe max 1 from the ranked pool and an extra 1-2 that's exclusive to the casual pool.
---
Shameful display.
---
Every body has.
---
George is the epitome of toxicity.
---
Love on the battlefield where they are destined to kill each other since hes defender and shes attacker 😭
---
This shit is what makes me rage. I don't mind dying in a fair fight, but when someone rappels on a window and is able to just silently able to break a barricade I go from 0 to 60 fast.
---
Drone doesn't force you to stand still. First you drone out the defenders, then activate lion, and you can advance while the defenders can basically do nothing about it without being a free kill for the attackers. Its especially powerful when going for the plant. And lion affects every single defender, unlike droning.
---
It is a variant on the Nike logo, from the Nike anarchy series I believe: https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.vinted.net%2Fthumbs%2Ff800%2F00a1e_9Cnrj3WvUqK9tzm5Ukjh76kc.jpeg%3F1510392502%2446c679a4f3a0709f8e4f6cfb2dbae565263a13d3&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vinted.cz%2Fmuzi%2Flehke-svetry-a-mikiny-s-kapuci%2F18858529-nike-anarchy-hoodie&amp;docid=GySHmhDPAY-M_M&amp;tbnid=y7-4UEE9e9ZIBM%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=600&amp;h=800&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim

Commenting in hopes than an answer comes

Post an in game recording of the noise 
---
Yeah well if they nerf him before fixing all his bugs i'll throw up.
---
Click him.
---
Just wondering, is that their reaction cause he said what they said earlier in the stream or cause he's mocking what they said to be funny?
---
i don't care i just want crouch spamming to dissaper since it's ruining the fun of the game
---
I see both sides of it. When you play ranked you expect that kind of thing and those of us who play ranked go to casual to just relax. Sure we care to win but it's just a drag to drown every room like you do in ranked or have to be just as cautious. Sometimes you want to play loose.
---
That being said. I think people forget what casual is used for by some players and that is try our different strats and use it for a bit of discovery. And that gets lost by some people.
---
In other words, yea, you are supposed to play how you want actually and nothing I just said should change how you play. At the end of the day they're probably annoyed for reasons I listed above but fuck it. Who cares?
---
Yeah clash looks so retarded .
---
When you get in a bad casual game you can just leave or boot the offending players. Playing the Discovery playlist last night I had to leave (or got booted for no reason) in 4/5 games. One of them was loaded with toxic players on both sides. But they all eventually left or got booted and it turned into a great 9 round match. When that happens in ranked you end up in a 4 v 1 and then drop to an even more miserable rank. 
---
People will riot .
---
Forgot how people reacted to chimera packs ?
---
Early Years Pro-League camo
---
Lion so weak they he always get banned in pro league
---
&gt; I'm fully aware of how it sounds, but think about it logically - do people prefer the casual ruleset or do they just not know about the ranked ruleset? If I saw someone suggest casual be removed when I was new I'd certainly be against it - where else am I supposed to learn? But now it makes sense to me, I was learning a different game. I didn't prefer casual, I just didn't know any better. Overall, that hurt my experience. I thought I disliked the game - no, I just disliked casual. 
---
Which is why I think player agency is important. Let players decide for themselves once they've tried out both rule sets. That will be easier if they add another rule set that is ranked sans the rank. Hell, Ubisoft could add rewards for new players to try out each play list X number of times to encourage them to play both. Then they can pick which they like better.

Damn, I had to restart my ps4. Feel so stupid. Pretty sure it's because I never close out of the game and just let my ps4 go to sleep. Thanks again
---
Thankyou
---
Yes brother
---
Well pro leauge is stupid so any thing they say I instantly ignore

Smoke: *REAL SHIT?!*

Her name is Yumiko

Monty used to only extend down, then ubi added all the plates on the sides and top early on.
---
You use to be able to c4 a shield even in front of them really easily. Now it just tickles them if anything.
---
More of a fix than a buff, but blitz used to die to a headshot if he was hit in the earmuffs.
---
Clash is getting a full auto SMG, her taser has had buffed damage and recharge rates, though they also tweaked other things to keep her in check.
---
well that’s on attack 
---
Actually Patriots was cancelled in its entireity. Siege was never the multiplayer for Patriots and was always its own game.
---
Cause they're filthy anti-semantic goyim! c|:\^(
---
My name is qbert my tag is 1572
---
It’s because you’re a scummy blitz main 
---
Instead of "BOOST INCOMING"
---
We get "WALL INCOMING"
---
Its very nice, but can you edit so that clash doesnt put her tounge out. 
---
Lendizi has countless times killed georgie through walls when George was standing still without s drone btw people kill him all the time and he doesn’t care like merc and kg never accuse someone without seihng there name in viewer list
---
That’s for the explanation. I knew it was a joke, but it seemed it ran a little deeper than that
---
this game mode needs to stay and they need to implement pick ban into ranked.
---
currently i cant even take this game seriously since there is no way to ban out potentially overbuffed/overpowered operators. League of legends does this so too does R6. 
---
I would bet Blitz and yea
---
Nah. Lion instead of Finka. 
---
Theyd probably just be a lot shorter then. 24h realtime or 2h ingame only
---
Glacier
---
Pick ban system?
---
That's kinda the point, you can't solely depend on sound 
---
Because it never climbed stairs for me, 
---
omg
---
Pulse turned into weeb
---
I feel like people do that already based on looks and country etc. 
---
What! Pulse looks more like Jason Statham imo....

Hello cheesynator, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/akd4ow/why_is_this_illegal/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yeah the reason is people are stupid and impatient he isn't unbalanced because I
---
his stats where never as high as finka and she needs a Nerf she has had a 90% win rate for 2 out of the last 3 seasons
---
Majority have wanted wanted this to be ranked for years. Now they tease it. They'd be stupid not to change it 
---
It's not really racist if it's largely true lol- this is an accurate description of how a lot of east Asians age in my experience.
---
Having a LGBT character won't hurt anything, it's not "forced inclusion" when there are plenty of LGBT+ in real life, are they forcefully included in the real world too? lol
---
If anything, not having an LGBT+ character in the game would seem off, just like having all white males would seem off. It's not forced diversity if it's a representation of reality.
---
Buck and Frost are great ops to use first. Easy play style with good weapons. 
---
I dont want to live on this planet anymore
---
In PUBG you can hip-fire lean on console.
---
You have to press and hold the RT stick to hip-fire lean and quickly press to ADS. The only problem I can think of is pressing the button for too long and hip-firing instead of ADSing but to rapidly press the RT button is something we could get used to.
---
Well it's pro league the game mode and since he isn't in pro league...
---
Pro teams ban operators for 3 reasons:
---
1. Target Bans: The enemy team has a great player on a certain operator, like Psycho on Glaz, Kantoraketti on Ash, Goga on Echo etc.
---
2. Map based. Banning operators who are a nuisance on certain maps, like Blackbeard on Consulate, Maverick on Clubhouse etc.
---
3. Preference bans. Banning operators because the team just don't wanna deal with that style of play. G2 banning Lion before he was quarantined. Teams banning Shields etc.
---
Hello Typical_Brummie, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/akd5ur/weird_broken_bug_thing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
*Ash rushes in and 360 no scope headshots you while crouch/lean spams you*
---
You think it’s balanced that they make no fucking sound?
---
He should be! 
---
No
---
You've scared me
---
Does it really matter?
---
Haha I got scared, myself
---
Your Amazon delivery has arrived 
---
But they haven't. I played a lot of games yesterday and the most consistent ban was Maverick, because a guy on my team really doesn't like playing against Maverick. Lion was rarely banned, or used for that matter. Blitz only sometimes, Cav because she's been overplayed anyways since her nerf announcement. All of us had our "mains" banned at some point, but never for more than a game or two
---
Everyone makes enough sound to be heard
---
I got tkd twice for stealing a drone. I got the drone first shot. 
---
Ban operators not because of tactical or other need but to make someone angry and salty. Take typical Ash main and imagine their saltiness when their teammate intentionally bans Ash. 
---
And this will be all over the game given the current toxicity of this community which can throw the game if you pick their favorite operator. 
---
That's not a balance issue, that's a bug. A fix is needed, not a rework.
---
Yeah otherwise Characters like Cav and Vigil would be useless, flanking is dependent on sound and crouching is a very slow way to flank without making sound. That's the way Ubi intended.
---
Pfffff
---
No 3 speeds are silent when they crouch walk
---
What they mean is that if Ubisoft just come out and say that Pulse is gay for no reason then it’s forced inclusion 
---
"Setting Trace's thermo touch" i think as well.
---
Omg! Feels bad
---
Weird to see doc ban. Unless your team really hate spawnpeekers. 
---
Nice I guess you love Ash just crouch walking into site and killing your whole team
---
no he shouldn’t. hopefully this means recruit is being removed when ranked becomes like the new playlist 
---
I disagree 
---
Ah okay I agree with that completely. People just need to break down the reasoning like you just did beyond “I don’t like it”
---
Who do you have left to get?
---
Alpha packs are diluted with crap and you wont get a legendary anyway.
---
Oof
---
lol mad cuz bad 
---
Boosters should really count the in-game time. Also, they could be cheaper than they are now. I guess they could make more profit out of it.
---
Eh, statistically speaking the odds of at least 1 in 44 being LGBT is quite high.
---
I disagree with getting buck because he has a good amount of recoil, especially for someone who doesn’t have lots of experience. 
---
lol you just stole the video from a guy that got like 12k upvotes, nice try
---
But pros say it’s broken too I guess G2 is bad
---
As long as it stays it’s own seperate thing, not replacing casual or ranked or people will crack the shits.
---
I personally didn’t mind it, was a nice change, but the guys I play with couldn’t even stick it out long enough to finish the challenge. I imagine they aren’t the only ones.
---

Elo is all relative, don’t sweat it

Reminds of the time a long ago when a guy in WC3 typed out "g2g my dog is on fire" and quit out.
---
I *do* save my GIs and, luckily, I started early in 2011. While Patriots showcased a few optimizations that we can observe in Siege, they are nothing alike. It seems more like parts of Patriots were used in Wildlands, the Division and Siege such as the setting for the Division, the squad command abilities for Wildlands and reworked rappelling and vaulting for Siege.
---
From what the GI article describes though, the two games couldn't be more different.
---
f
---
It’s harder to destroy thirty drones than to win a match in the road to S. I.  More people would be willing to spend money on R6 credits to get all the packs than to destroy thirty drones to get one pack.
---
I don’t spam crouch tho!!! :(( 
---
Did you know you can see its electrified and can not drove into it?
---
that’s why i took the part about recruits deserving a TK out of my original comment. and it’s not because I THINK they SHOULDNT be recruit. it’s about them being detrimental to their team by going recruit. recruit is never viable over an actual operator. literally never. 
---
But he can certainly play one!
---
It's a stupid challenge because everyone including me was not reinforcing and just hunting them.
---
New update : Hibana gets a necklace with pulse's name.
---
Nah this is PC. I couldn't imagine how bad my console aim would be nowadays, PS4 is where I started but I'd probably be potato! :D

Yeet

Gotchu homie
---
That would be to much work for Ubisoft, don’t be silly.
---
For most guns I'd say vertical grip is the better choice as the bulk of gunfights take place when you're already aiming down sights, but there are some exceptions for guns that have easy recoil and/or are played more aggressively. 
---
Low enough recoil guns off the top of my head: UMP, K1A, Mx4, MPX, M14
---
Guns that can be played more aggressively: T95, 556xi, C7E, M762, PARA308

He did open up... His heart

Homie I’m still on ps4 and it’s killing me
---
Ever wondered why they're called POWER tools.
---
She wont get the lion ban hammer, but she is very potent and brings a poop ton of utility. I can tell you right now her best map will be Consulate, especially attacking 2F bomb site.  She is really strong and will be banned quite often, I believe around the same amount as Maverick
---
Still seems a bit picky and reactionary to immediately say he obviously looks like man. Don't be a little bitchy cunt. Not everyone can be super perceptive at first glance. Bitch made fool.
---
I mean I don’t know what else you could do, lmao remove him???
---
Not cyberpunk
---
Sibling Rivalry +10
---
But cool af
---
People still do it anyways, 2 or 3 times a round
---
Can’t quite argue with that, possibly the greatest duo.
---
Blitz is not overpowered by any means he just feels that way because when he does kill you it feels oppressive and like you can’t do anything, but in reality he has to Catch you alone and at close range which is a difficult task without good cooperation with a team and if an operator is good with a team in specific situations then I am ok with it and I feel that we all should be
---
Should be Finka not Fuze, she's at least Russian while fuze isn't.
---
Long live thermcher!!! 
---
Rainbow6: Vegas 2's plotline centered on a R6 initiate going rogue with the intention of outsmarting and subsequently killing his former squad leader.

It's R6vR6 adjacent.

I don’t see a Lion Dokki Jackel Blitz and Finka what meta?

Yup yup yup

There’s 7 maps? I only got Villa yesterday after playing 5 games smh
---
Pulse's hometown, Goldsboro, had 2 nukes dropped on it, Japan had 2 nukes dropped on it, it's like poetry...
---
Do you have the standard edition or the starter edition?
---
i buy 90 day boosters every 90 days because i’m a stupid lunatic
---
Which version do you have? 
---
Why you hatin on the red dot?
---
A) Ash actually is a problem due to both her hitbox and low recoil weapons. B) Siege is not toxic, I'm so tired of people calling Siege toxic. Go play any MOBA, you'll learn what toxic is.
---
No skill floor is how good a bad player can be for example lion has a high floor because you just click a button, or ash has a high floor,or our favorite rook who a bad player can be very good with him, a low skill floor but high ceiling would be thatcher
---
Knock knock 
---
Winning more than losing is still winning more than losing. 
---
My fav map is tower and it should go back to ranked imo but most people don't like it ;-;
---
Ironic...
---
They obviously care because most of the people still using controller care. Anything that grants an unfair advantage is against the terms of use, the only reason they can’t do anything about it is because of licensed products and adapters that can’t be detected.
---
I bet you're rolling in renown though.
---
I thought it was

---
My favorites are Border and Oregon

New ones that came December

I don't know what goes on as I never played WD2 but oops :D

Offense: Sledge or Buck
---
Defense: Kapkan or Rook or Frost
---
The skin looks best on the G36
---
Why the Six Invintational packs cost so much?(
---
He's slow, not exactly good at killing people, and can't fight back when fully extended; but he can provide cover to the defuser planter, provide intel, and be a distraction during a fight that can kill you if you're not careful.
---
Dokkeabi, because you are able to rush and are able to stay back when needed, your gadget is ultra useful and helps teammates in hard situations, plus her MK 14 is the best DMR in the game and her sidearms are okay. Just try and stick to the DMR and wait till you have better aim to use the BOS-G because it fires slugs not shells.
---
It wouldn’t decrease voice chat from party on console or discord on pc, so you could be deafened by a loud teammate.
---
Hibana is my main so I’m a little biased towards her, she’s a very good hard breacher and her guns are great. Her Type 89 is a fast firing weapon with very manageable recoil and the bearing 9 takes a little bit more to get used to with the new recoil but it’s still one of the better automatic sidearms plus she’s a 3 speed. 
---
Buck is a great operator too, he’s versatile and is always viable on most maps. His gun recoil takes a little bit of time to get used to and once you learn spots to take out floors buck can be deadly especially with his nades.
---
I restarted 2 times and it didnt work
---
Dock or rook. The game is team based and those ops help the whole team. Jus make sure you heal/drop the armor. 
---
Zofia has good low recoil guns and a good gadget and stays useful in higher levels of play. Jackal is very good for beginners, but becomes less useful later on.
---
Lesion.
---
I love her Pro League skin
---
Probably
---
I always down if they kill my int.
---
I was very disappointed when I didn't get it from the challenge pack, the challenge was annoying af and all I got was a pair of glasses for pulse.
---
Haha funny Tachanka meme that definitely didn’t get old two years ago 
---
Because the only hints at him being gay were in comics. An outside source that a majority of the player base don’t read. That’s the point. In the actual game, there’s nothing mentioning it. 
---
Favela should get added to ranked. 
---
Her guns are too unforgiving for a new player trying to learn the game.  I think someone with a lower recoil smg/ar first as they learn maps the move towards the DMR.
---
It's a good site but I'm looking for something that records the kills thanks anyway tho
---
I think they should indeed make sure the fraggers and utility ops should stay balanced. I think fast paced ops are definitely important as they can add to strategy, however there shouldn't be too many.
---
In terms of roasting etc, I have stopped solo-queueing altogether as I like working together and feel like you are too dependent on the quality of random teammates otherwise. 
---
I think ranked is so much better in terms of gameplay than casual and Road to SI especially when you reach plat / high gold 
---
i unironically think that people that sweat in casual for any reason other than warming up for ranked are nerds, you can't change my mind
---
Yeah but finka is overpowered with everybody so yeah finka is still more broken also if you're standing on a mute jammer that counters two out of the three things there you mentioned there is no real counter to finka other than hopefully you kill her
---
Someone being LGBTQ+ shouldn't be a big deal. It should be treated the same as if we found out S:76 had a brother, because their status as LGBTQ+ doesn't and shouldn't define them. It's also not as if the comic was the "S:76 is Gay(!)" comic, it just a small moment in another story.
---
Killcam - sure, no doubts.
---
I expected it to be 3 rounds before swap, to be the same as Ranked’s *best of 7* format, so you need to play a minimum of 4 rounds to win. 6 round games can be a bit too long. 
---
6^th Pick is a no-no with the current level of toxicity and absence of coordination.  
---
I play PC. 
---
But I did use MnK on console for a while. 
---
Yea it’s strange that most people didn’t realize this but  because of this I was able to finish it in one day

---
2nd vote for Lesion.
---
He means in ranked. Challenge only works in discovery playlist
---
Probably did the challenge specifically for the event so people played the event, just in case no one decided to keep playing the event. 
---
Hit or Miss?
---
You should look at the hot my man before posting.
---
You didn't make this, this has been shared around here a few times already, r/quityourbullshit
---
That's why I like the original Rainbow Six operators, they had a background story about their career. They also had the book for those who felt inclined to read it. It's a good read and goes by fast. Word round the campfire is they are making the movie based off the book.
---
Buck is an all around operator good for entry fragging or vertical gameplay he is a good op to get
---
Your quotes are very impressive. You must be very proud.
---
It didn't explode so America wasn't nuked. 
---
I wish the colors were more spread out tho 
---
He aimed for the bushes.
---
Kaid has impacts not C4 and bandit does have both but can only have 1 at a time. The point was a recruit although he may have "disadvantages" without a "gadget" or sight can still be a viable OP with barbed wire and a C4 in the same round. Are their better setups with actual OPs yes does that mean recruit is completely useless no
---
The first game we played of this mode we banned echo and mira, however they proceeded to spawn camp every round, all acogs and 3 armors, run outside, second floor windows, balconies. 
---
I can see why this is banned in the pro league but God damn, I wanted to relax after work and chill with buddies, not be in UT in 1966 hoping I can get yo class without getting sniped. 
---
isn't that hard to check spawnpeaks though

That's my twitter account, im fairly sure i made this.
---
What does strats mean? Sorry very new to this game
---
Question: the current round count is the same as in ranked so why reduce it?
---
4-0 is victory in both ranked and si, 3-3 is overtime. 9 rounds maximum
---
Just let them play their own game and explore on their own, telling people what to do is never a good thing in FPS or even in anything in real life because they will never be able to understand why things need to be done in a certain way but blindly follow.
---
And most people below gold are just playing this game for fun, they don't take this game seriously and they shouldn't, plus the stress from real life after school, work, etc. They are just on Siege to chill, kill time and relax, they don't have intention to get good in this game, but if they starts TKing and being toxic, there is nothing you can do but report, find a new lobby and move on.
---
Noted. 
---
I usually just leave a drone by the door or just go hard left as soon as I spawn.
---
I've seen Tachanka banned more often, but that was for *the memes*.
---
My team was having fun with the band yesterday. Doc and Tachanka were the top of our defender list. It was fun seeing the enemy team WTF in chat over it
---
I personally would say 10%, 25% is very drastic making throwable gadgets a lot more powerful.
---
Why the echo ban? He gets banned in almost every match I play in the playlist and I just don't understand why. His ability can be easily countered.
---
He said confused sirens, not confused owen wilson.
---
That would just make it a universal, like the Volcano skin, or the Damascus Steel skin.
---
Frosty christmas
---
I meant maverick
---
That’s funny, mine doesn’t look that good 
---
he can deny plants
---
Their is helping and there is being an ass while helping. Your response falls in the latter. 
---
I legit pointed this out the other day on a post. 
---
/u/loltyler
---
Its evolving. 
---
That’s why he’s vigil. It’s how I did it. 
---
Thermite, for her homewreckin his relationship with Thatcher for a good couple of seasons
---
you can still used the smaller wall beside it, you would need to use 3 wall reinforcements there for kaid to be viable.
---
I think Im gonna get maverick, because people been recommending him. Cheers
---
You said you play Xbox so I can't speak for that given the worse aiming of controllers / recoil differences. 
---
It's indisputable that Lion is the most unbalanced operator in competitive play on PC. Regardless how you feel about pro players they know the game better than you do.
---
And a mute is not a necessary operator by any means. 3 seconds is enough time to hold an angle, not to set up a jammer or do anything that meaningful (especially with a phone/drone/ping on you).
---
And nothing's changed. It's still cringy and unneeded.
---
Besides, it may be plausible that 2 characters may have had a relationship, but not 6. There was also an implication that Cav and Twitch were in a relationship. It really seems like Ubi is trying to ship characters to appease to cancerous fandoms. So much for professional spec ops.
---
Then again, the lore was never any good to begin with.
---
You are going to heaven or you are still under 14. 
---
Lmao I throw impacts at them so my teammate doesn’t get it
---
Damn bro can we just go back to the original team rainbow I never heard of caveira and twitch being together but I hope to god it ain’t true
---
Check his profile, his one and  only post states so
---
No wimminz...
---
Idc about the story or lore of siege. It's a multiplayer competitive shooter. I enjoy it as one.
---
Nothing will transfer you’ll have to grind all the operators again or buy them. 
---
There is a Pulse/Stealing Heart Pun here but I can't find it
---
Twitch's description is why she's bae.
---
When i first saw her pic thats what i thought it would do 
---
Nah that was Echo
---
At least have like 2 different modes
---
I mean you can't remove them but the best you could do is drive them or throw them out of the map perimeters and get them destroyed . It's not the most convenient way but it's the only way I know of
---
I think you can just download Ubisoft then sign into your account and download it from there
---
The smaller wall beside it?
---
Yeah I can’t play seige solo anymore because of how people love to vote to kick when ever they can.
---
You know what I meant 😒
---
Which again I'm not understanding how it's the exact same operator on both consoles yet he's bad on console and according to y'all he's some kind of God even though he's statistics and higher-level play show the complete opposite you all have this claim of him being good get it is backed up by nothing other than someone says he is
---
Again I have no problem setting up in 3 seconds how you can't is beyond me. It has to come down to the fact that you your skill is lacking it's the only logical conclusion.
---
Easily countered my ass.
---
He's bloody obnoxious operator who can sit back and be safe while effectively neutralizing a players from fighting back for a huge amount of time. Stupid bloody operator.
---
Great work 
---
They said I could not make it smaller and more accurate 
---
oh that's it, i though you got a pack and the 1500, yeah no big deal. The 30 drones are not counting either , maybe just a visual bug .
---
yo he's in villa like in closet with 50000 kg of flour and 27374 cans of beans 
---
FOR THE MOTHERLAND
---
I'm very certain that its Chinese, not Japanese. I can tell because of a lack of Hiragana or Katagana
---
Then you don't know how to use impacts. They are incredibly valuable and would compliment the shotty perfectly
---
Does anyone know how to add the operator main on the side of your username 
---
As someone who always plays Thermite on Oregon, the only time I don't get that hatch is if all walls around the hatch are gone ***and*** it's successfully muted or electroclawed, or there is a roamer preventing me from planting on one of the walls. You have to shoot out any wall within 3 feet or so of the hatch for it not to get destroyed. In fact, if you reinforce that wall, you actually help thermite plant, because of the hard cover he is safe from anyone playing stairs... upper or lower, and meeting door, and only have to worry about anyone in kitchen/ z hall.
---
I noticed it would randomly update. 
---
Some game it would update right after. Other games it wouldnt update until I restarted the game. Bit wonky but hope it helps... just make sure your doing the invitational and not casual lol
---
Obligatory orange fan sad.
---
I mean he is but the joke fell flat.
---
I like your pet mute 
---
Which game files?
---
You can edit the "GameSettings.ini" file in your Documents but outside of that no. You will probably get banned for trying to alter anything else.

I mean there’s still sweaties but I agree with the last part

That’s only for supported games. And siege isn’t one. PS4 has had M&amp;K support for ages and you can’t use them on siege. It’s up to the devs to allow it.

Honestly after ten seconds of not succeeding at killing a drone, challenge be damned its become personal.
---
I mean cmon a bald white with those shades? Pulse is straight otaku
---
Yes I guess, because I’m on pc and and if your a good pc player you can usually have better reaction speed that can also be more precise.
---
Yes
---
Jackal is by far the best first attack op imo, great guns, anti roaming capability, and the pocket shotgun opens so many fun angles, plus you have smokes. Maverick isn't a bad choice at all but I'd go with jackal
---
I know, i play her frequently. I think her guns are still good, the shield idk really care for but 
---
Siege on your Ubisoft account is linked to your PS4 account. They're go together. So you can't use a different PS4 account for your Ubisoft one. It's sad you can't transfer your data and account but that's the case with all the studios and companies as well
---
Thats my 2 cents
---
Yes ubi does count is as a form of cheating
---
People panic when they see a blitz rushing towards towards them and mostly shoot shield :p
---
That makes no sense but ok
---
Funny before I even read this I put it on hibana
---
Nonononono
---
I think the recoil should be reduced slightly but not too much we don’t need a repeat of blood orchid 
---
Aww.
---
No it’s not. They did for a couple of days and then Xim got around it. Not only that but it was falsely identifying controller users too. So they dropped it within a week.
---
Honestly i was thinking about some of the stuff people were saying maybe not having extra gadgets like mira and not having extra gadget do you think just giving extra ammo for the team would make it balanced
---
Rip I got it in the first free pack
---
I've lately fallen in love with Jackal, pdw, red dot. You can try it out.

 vigil seems like an autismus operatus , dokk is more like a thicc teenager and hibana seems like a man with facepaint. colors are like wannabe vivid but its more of a non-sense randomly chosen. 
---
tl;dr 
---
could be better imo.
---
edit. i appreciate the work but as i said above it could be better so think twice when replying like a whiteknight.
---
Tf are gaming socks
---
that's not a macro definately.
---
Ayyyyy!!!!!
---
Do you like my new Clock 9mm handgun?
---
r6maps.com has up until villa, otherwise it's just the rainbow 6 tactical board
---
She likes a Monkey, well goddamn!
---
True, but this is just insane
---
A need is not needed. You can’t just go onto her and get free kills you’ve got to have some level of skill to play her. And the only reason she is picked often is because she has a strong primary is a 3 speed and has a ok gadget 
---
Also the Glock would probably have it's actual fire rate of 1200rpm
---
I’m talking about the very beginning of the game. And I would rather people drop shot than crouch + lean spam. Way easier to counter, it’s not technically breaking the game, and if you were to set up a macro to dropshot it wouldn’t give you an innate advantage. With this bs meta, you can just setup a macro like seen here and shit on everyone who didn’t

1440p 144hz. Went from console to this. My mind was completely blown. I cant ever play xbox again. 
---
My monitor is 27 inch but I’m fine with 1080p if I upgrade I’m getting 4K so I can downscale back to 1080 if I need to. 
---
Me when it's a 1 vs 5 and I'm last one standing.
---
Jokes aside colours are really nice, and your choice of colours blends and adds enough contrast with Rook giving off interesting vibes.
---
Ubi officially recognized it as against their rules and if you send clips of people doing stuff like that they'll ban their accounts but it's real hard to confirm it.
---
Oh big time. You need to be in handjob distance to be effective 
---
She commited sudokku
---
6^th Pick can be used by only 1 player at a time which may lead to people teamkilling due to being jealous about a feature getting stolen from them. At least with P&amp;B everyone can participate in some way by voting.
---
Cheating. If you want to play m+k play on PC
---
Do people still have trouble making Mav holes? Its not that hard to make a crawl hole with just a single canister.
---
Oregon, club house and plane are my favorites. They're very fun to play and have a good atmosphere
---
It’s dumb  how her holograms don’t even have the same scope as whatever your running ,you can’t scan holograms with drones ,glaz can see which is alibi with his scope, and her outfit doesn’t change.Buff Alibaby
---
Aye ya cheating basterd 
---
I thought custom games allow 4 per team
---
Theres a good chance I'm remembering this wrong
---
Беларусские, не Русский.
---
What's in the canister? Probably your soul
---
It is seen as cheating but try ad remember the fact that playstation licenses a mouse and keyboard for their console and xbox are starting mouse and keyboard support on games but only if the developer chooses to allow it. So if ubi allow it then it wont be seen as cheating
---
Ubisoft considers it cheating, but they have no way to enforces those rules.   
---
So it’s basically just a douche move more than anything.  Unless you have a legitimate disability!
---
Aye
---
starter pack owners didn't get the base OPs
---
so it is possible
---
It was ying and echo who had a thing not dokk, his phone doesn't right because he uses his wrist mounted display instead of a phone
---
Well at least it isn’t as annoying as the other shields 
---
*PULLS OUT MEAT SCEPTER!
---
We could advertise on the sub
---
How long has he been in the closet? 
---
Yeah, I'm breaching from inside classroom everytime, the small wall is just an option if you can't get the big wall/hatch. Having hatch is the most important, then having big wall.
---
They probably all play in copper and don’t realize people with brains don’t driver their drones into shocked wire. 
---
And you could get friends to play if you have any
---
I had the starter edition when theme park was the season, and came back in parabellum with 4 ops
---
You know people put it at the top of stairs and shit right? Just so you won’t notice until you jump over the stairs?
---
Finka is Russian, she's not an immigrant. She was born on Russian soil.
---
Yea ya may have to buy if ya don't get it in the free packs  
---
luckily I still have 6,7k credits that I have bought from some website for cheap xd
---
What you mean by sub
---
You didn't have the starter pack then because noone else got the base 20 OPs except you of those who had starter...
---
That could of course be amazing and something we could have even with killcams still in the game! Yet still I doubt that Ubi will put resources onto this kind of system because... It's Ubisoft we're talking about here after all lol
---
It would be quite challenging to create and would also require quite a bit of resources and time. 
---
They were pretty clear on how many packs we can get during the event, so I wouldn't bet on being able to convert them to any kind of currency.
---
*"Each weekend of this event will feature a new Club Challenges that will reward players with a 2019 Collection Pack, up to four in total for the entire event."*
---
I bought the starter pack and got the ops. I guess I'm lucky, I only spent 15 dollars on the game.
---
Play a game and once you are finished it should show up
---
I'm talking about the new thing where you place it in a door way and someone has to prone to get through. 
---
Jager fits perfectly
---
Together we can do it !

Almost positive Gsync stops this, so either you don't actually have gsync, or there's a settings issue. It will match the refresh rate with the game frame rate, and at the ceiling it'll act a little like vysnc holding onto frames a little.
---
 Firstly v-sync should be 100% switched OFF with a gsync setup.
---
 Also need to make sure you've got gsync setup to work on windowed and full screen modes through the NVIDIA control panel. Make sure you're using a display port cable.
---
We have removed your post for the use of the word 'nig'
---
Unless they derank on purpose
---
It's Chinese and you can change your console language. 
---
@**Moderator** fix morning pls
---
Can't we just have the kill cam in casual?
---
What problems haven't I acknowledged? My point isn't that Echo isn't annoying. I'm just saying that he isn't OP and in the grand sceme of things, 2 Yokais aren't much to worry about if you have gadget deniers like Thatcher or IQ.

Plot twist: Pulse is actually a bald version of Hibana.
---
Now with twice the annoyance 
---
No, it's annoying. I don't like losing 3 rounds on def and then be on attack. 1 per round is a lot better. + the bans can be simply annoying. Like Caveira should be perma banned but some idiots ban vigil or Ying... fucking ying.
---
 I fucking hate this game. I mean...I love it. It's my favorite PVP ever.  (it's honestly the only MP game I've played with any regularity for 3+ years). 
---
But fuck this game. Seriously. I've given myself a month ban to get some of the sand out of my front butt, but I can't even watch videos of people being pieces of shit. THIS POST NEEDS A TRIGGER WARNING!!! 8)
---
But that would be... too realistic.
---
It says on the wiki that they worked together, and thus, he was familiar with her logic bomb. Which is probably the reason he uses a wrist screen, and why his drones are not effected by the logic bomb despite being able to be used as cameras.
---
Big drops cause micro stuttering. Okay? I'm aware of my situation. Thank you.
---
My issue with it is that it’s like castle. It works great in games with lots of communication but when you get those “Blitz, Lion, Cav” always being banned because they just don’t feel like dealing with one it can be useless. I think it’s a great mode but tbh I feel like it makes little difference in copper-gold 4
---
Mira
---
Says someone who hasn’t played hostage ranked
---
Yeah they worked together but it doesn't say they were a thing
---
It will last until march when the new year start, btw you already have everything unlocked so you dont loss nothing.
---
That's exactly how I feel about OxyContin.
---
Where's that video of a defender popping open his phone in kid's bedroom on House with it coming up as a video of Kanna and then all the attackers just breach at once.
---
Oh ok thx
---
I’ve played bandit since this challenge started and there have been times where I get 7 drones in one round cause they just drive into electrowire 
---
holy...look at lion 😂
---
I loose all the time. It’s important to stay loose, it helps you win. 
---
Awesome! Thanks.
---
Don’t use intel based off a quick drone in
---
So each situation takes *~5 min*
---
And each  situation gives you *600* renown
---
So it's *30* renown per minute
---
So to reach *25000* renown it would take **~208 minutes** or **3h 28m**
---
It's far more efficient than the 6 hours it takes to get that in cas or ranked
---
This isn't your normal, everyday drone hunting.  This is advanced drone hunting.
---
Wait this actually works??
---
Love it
