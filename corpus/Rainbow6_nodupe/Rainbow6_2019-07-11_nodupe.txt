PC can be very volatile. Could be a number of things.

---
Updating all BIOS and GPU drivers is usually my first step when I have issues, but it looks like you have done this already.
---
Try googling your specific issue along with your GPU and CPU to see if there is a connection.
---
Lol at low level any accomplishments Nokk make can be done by other fraggers and with better results.
---
Can somebody explain what happened?
---
Lol I saw this one

They banned according to the amount of usage.  Some got perma-banned, the lightest offense was 2 day ban, with a few variations in-between.  How long was your ban?
---
People can say the nword with a 1 on the end and be fine
---
After seeing the sens and dpi of professionals mine looked off since they all have way lower sens then i have but have the same dpi yet mine feels slow (dont know where to really post this).

They did that intentionally.

The blip knocked out half of all bums of Rainbow Six Siege, love for the world to see. (2019, colorized)

I like everything except getting rid of the seasonal charms because they're just getting better. If Ubi had kept the old charms for year 4, I would back this idea 100%, but because of the new charms I feel more like 90%. Great idea though!
---
Probably end up having alot of bugs in it

‚ÄúHmm, I wonder what that defusing noise is.‚Äù
---
It was a Glaz too so I was quite surprised I got that

In a fair fight I consider it part of the game but when you‚Äôre cheating it‚Äôs pretty toxic. It‚Äôs like beating someone in a wheelchair in basketball and gloating

Gridlock

Is it only back on console tho
---
or perhaps you got banned for spamming chat?
---
It‚Äôs the showdown mode
---
what is claymore
---
ela has no ass. legitimately anyone who thinks she has more ass than IQ has never actually seen ass. I'm pretty sure Alibi actually has the fattest in game rn, if not it's cav
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just a bug
---
Yes retsart your game its cuz of showdown
---
I agree. Maybe we could also use guns from dlc CTU‚Äôs if we have the dlc.
---
Worse than plane? Lol
---
I‚Äôm guessing the copper was being boosted by his friends? If that‚Äôs the case that‚Äôs just dumb
---
They've been bamboozled
---
F
---
Oh....
---
Good art
---
this was a rollercoaster of emotions
---
I like the idea a lot, sound really seems to be an untouched part of gameplay that Ubi could do a lot with.
---
We've at least got https://www.reddit.com/r/VAC_Porn/ if you like watching this stuff go down and seeing the salt from people getting banned.

üòÇüòÇ

The copper is a smurf of a plat, and he is the one boosting the others.
---
I should have just said who do you all think is the thiccest
---
Even more impressive, good shooting
---
fun wise? holding 3rd floor wasnt fun
---
He was however the only on his team to stay I'll give him that. Most of his team left twice that game.
---
We played all of that content repeatedly at launch, why again now? Nostalgia I guess, maybe they should add a game mode like that just for a limited time, instead of adding it permanently.
---
Aye congratulations it‚Äôs a celebration
---
Well . how long are you banned ?
---
Yeah they just do it for memes every now and then, it‚Äôs statistically worse but if you really like them then you do you, I didn‚Äôt mean to come off as rude on first comment
---
Idk, I liked it.
---
YES. There are also times that people look at my kid and vote kick me before round 1 has started. I am level 14 so I‚Äôm not that great.
---
Vigil
---
I'll have to give it a try as well, I usually use her AR which is really good
---
your memory is failing you, try to think a bit about 3rd floor
---
At lead begin rolling out some. Maybe don‚Äôt put all of them in, but maybe year 1-2 operators. Also give them the new gadgets like cameras, impacts, and claymores
---
Suppressor on Sledge so you can down people and finish them with that sweet sweet hammer kill.

Alrighty

I'm so sorry you have the issue and that's what I'm talking about! On PS4 that's so common. It's a great game once you get better but that climb to get to that better point is such a struggle because of the community
---
Are you sure you're honest with us ? or you got banned for spamming something in chat ?
---
Ah, ok. Thanks for explaining
---
Quick question, why was i banned for 15 days? I did use the symbol, but i never used it to completely crash or sway a game. i only used it as a joke to troll my friends while they were aiming or before a match. i Never abused it in such a way to sway a game. ive even lost matches due to this??? and got 15 days?? Nice one. maybe ban the clash abusers or deployable shield abusers or IQ abusers get a ban. Smooth developing.

DDoS stands for distributed denial of service. The ELI5 is somebody's service gets flooded with so much traffic that it takes too long to respond to anything.
---
A reddit hug of death is an accidental DDoS
---
Some games' multiplayer services expose the IP addresses of other players in a match.  If you have somebody's IP address you can send traffic to them. If you send them a lot of traffic you can clog up their entire bandwidth with that traffic until the game thinks they have disconnected, and drops them from the game. Until the DDoS stops the target's internet service is effectively dead.

The ban waves started today. The exploit has been going on for maybe almost a week.

Nah just don't call people newfag bitch.

No . the old proleague bundles never comeback

It's weird honestly. Just a touch and I'm better, but beyond that my skill suffers bad. The parabola goes up though, and when I'm absolutely inverted I become prophetic. I'll run guns on semi and almost double my kdr on a per game basis with one taps. Literally map knowledge goes out the window but I hit one tap wallbangs. I've been accused of hacking because during prep I'll wander around lost and accidentally impact myself but per match I'll fire like 12 rounds and get 9 kills. For honor is the same way. I think it's because I get confused but I turn into a feint/parry/mixup god.

His aim doesnt even reach top 100 on this sub. I've seen people do panic 360s while spraying a shotgun at the ceiling. At least he was close to hitting doc.

For me its usually lose a lot in ranked, go to casual, still lose a lot, go play showdown, and lose some more, Go nap off the rage.

That is quite the oof, my friend

Ok, it's crazy I was playing showdown - and there was a wave of people leaving the game - like non stop - I wander if those guys got banned - eh - fuck 'em!

Plus Ubi routinely breaks the game in new ways with updates. 
---
Just about every update brings new 2 new problems for every 1 it fixes.
---
Good idea I‚Äôll look into doing that soon

Idk then homie that's all I got

This is good, the one person I saw a while back is definitely banned

Do it. You are not forced to play the game. Vote with your wallet and don't buy Ubisoft games anymore if they truly burned you....that's what I did with EA and Bethesda

I mean, who cares if it's an accident? It won't affect you unless you plan on killing them again in the future lol. In the case of an accident happening AGAIN, it's just a different person being lost. Unless you're carrying, that really doesn't matter

Cunts like OP are the reason no one can have fun on this game, running around as a plat or some shit and fucking up new players.

Stay on ranked and piss off with the smurf accounts.

Nah, but seriously, try getting a team together so it‚Äôs easier to climb.

Most people just fuck about. Imo the game is toxic to everyone so hey, true equality for all!
---
There‚Äôs a huge ban wave of people being banned for toxic behavior for using a chat exploit by spamming &lt;&lt;&lt; and &amp;&amp;&amp; that causes the server to lag and if done right and correctly will cause the game to crash. As you can imagine people were abusing this in ranked . Hence why a ban wave went out for the ashats who used it
---
I pick to play games that allow for shit talk and don't crash when you use zalgo.
---
Have fun with the lag and watch what you say. Next time you say GG they'll ban you for harassment.
---
You literally just posted an old YouTube video that's not even yours.

I just proceed to play to more and lose 2 more then get off
---
Thats the worst situation of them all.
---
just fuckin skip it
---
Honestly it just looks like an untextured skin or bugged out skin. Not an unreleased skin.
---
Limit the rate, that overflow is from poor coding. 
---
How can countless games work while this one outlier crashes when someone uses zalgo?
---
Btw, I wouldn't quote companies, I would try to find the person who did the coding. They almost always get new devs/buy premade engines/systems to do there shit..
---
That‚Äôs also the other thing, I have no friends and have social anxiety
---
Ubisoft just flipped a switch (flippem flippem)
---
Fair enough
---
Hard. Rank. Cap. In. Matchmaking. 
---
Diamonds aren't legitimately playing with copper friends in Ranked.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt trigger that kick vote, but I‚Äôd get behind it if someone else did. I don‚Äôt want to hear your pep talk, like you‚Äôve just arrived from the heavens to rescue me. I was enjoying my game just fine before you got here. It‚Äôs casual, what do I care if it‚Äôs a 4 v 5. Speak up if you‚Äôve got a good callout, but spare me your gung-ho team spirit.

My nigga went jason voorhees on his ass

Look at a map layout of old Hereford as you run through an empty New Hereford. You'll notice that most of the change was in making some rooms larger and adding different connections so defense can rotate better.
---
https://www.r6maps.com/
---
Ex. The Dining and Kitchen site was a disaster before. While it's not great now, it at least has an extra rotation for site and that rotation isn't shut down from main entrance.
---
My big problem with the new Hereford map is every room feels the exact same. The whole place is devoid of ANY color differentiation.
---
You deranked to get here. How about you don't be an asshole and ruin the online experience for everyone?

Yea, it‚Äôs just called ‚Äúgrep‚Äù. Passing through these logs for specific criteria would be a piece of cake. If you have me the logs I could have every time it was done in a text file by itself in a matter of 10 mins. 
---
Also, to whoever said it‚Äôs a large amount of data, doubtful. Text logs are typically not very large. Even done at a huge scale with human typing, it wouldn‚Äôt be that large comparatively. Now when it comes to processes keeping logs, those can get pretty damn big pretty damn fast, but it‚Äôs constant and writing multiple lines at a time, not 3-10 words slowly like humans do.

The old Hereford with the new operators that Ubisoft brings in would make Favela look appealing to play...

No problemo man.

Nah American but I always sleep until the afternoon

Spelled wrong bro, sry but it is nokk

This happened to me today, 3 matches in a row against plats who easily can stomp me (one of the matches against a full team of high plat)
---
The casual matchmaking of this game is a hot mess.
---
you just admitted that you did do it, so of course you would not need to prove it or not, as you already have admitted to using exploits. And now you are mad, because you're going to be banhammered hardcore for this, as you deserve. I hope they ban you using hardware ID so you can never play siege again, you are scum.
---
lol as beautiful as it looks I'd rather not have a seizure every time I aim
---
+1. Its great that all these people are getting banned but every time it pops up my eyes just snap to it its so distracting.
---
DR DANYAL
---
DON'T SWEAR, YOU WILL GET BANNED!
---
Are you serious? How long has that been going on? I wonder why it‚Äôs not a problem in all platforms. 
---
I transitioned from PS4 to PC because of all the ridiculous M&amp;KB cheaters on PS4. I do not understand why Ubisoft won‚Äôt separate players into lobbies based on their input device. Gold I and above are wrought with M&amp;KB.
---
Rook is really good for ranked. Always helps the team with the bags of T-shirt‚Äôs. Tips I can give is don‚Äôt be afraid of firing try new things. Took helps the team even if you are dead.
---
I doubt new players would know the difference between the Atk and Def ops... especially since Sledge looks exactly like Mute/Smoke to newcomers... especially since they are running around between the Def ops without firing, you'd assume it's a friendly.
---
I like how you can hear a scream when he hits the detonator
---
This is probably why i get DESTROYED randomly, ill feel like im doing good and ill get smoked so fast and precisely i just want to turn my game off.

Damn that sound like a me problem

My friend got banned while it started be abuse he accidnelty teamkilled our friend and the guy didnt realize saying 'yes it was on purpose' was gonna do anything lol

They should add it as a limited time mode for new players who weren't there to experience siege in year 1
---
Not ur fault, weird name anyway
---
Tell me about it, the reload bug is back as well.
---
For a top level eSports title this game and its devs are a fucking joke.

Ya they did that strat the first round and I assumed they would do it again so I found the opportune moment and done it

If you count the amount of times I'm at the receiving end of a headshot you could say that I've made a great contribution so far

Okay that makes complete sense. It happened to me two times yesterday, and both of those time I was playing again a clan of 5 (different clans.) In both instances, me and my girl friend were playing with three randoms and we were kicking the clans ass. Next thing you know, match point, we get to a point where the game just can‚Äôt go on any more. And you are forced to quit or get booted and then try and rejoin and it just says sorry you are banned.

I‚Äôm literally on the verge of quitting this game because of Xbox toxicity. I‚Äôve had so many matches where I get tk‚Äôd for nothing.

Yeah it was 6mil last night

its been at 6 million the entire time for me
---
I got this too, went to play fallout 76 instead, those servers are also down, might be an Xbox problem
---
I'm aware that it tricks it into looking like a controller, im saying that it couldn't hurt to add this option since some mnk players would get rid of their adapters and go into pc lobbies.

- Being a laptop, your CPU and GPU will throttle off the charger. You'll have to deal.

- Use TAA filtering and lower your render scale, if you haven't already.

That's about it.

Glock is really anal and stingy about their licensing.
---
They did fix it, it's not longer exploitable, but they are banning the people who overly exploited it. This is a step in the right direction, when you exploit you are technically breaking the code of conduct and you get banned for it, it's not permeant either so.
---
I remember going some 11-5 when a ranked game ended (4-5 loss) and this one guy just HAD to message me telling me ‚Äútrash get dropped‚Äù and I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the one guy I constantly killed every round. That was a fun game.
---
would it hurt to add this? No because i truly believe that if this happened we would see a decrease in the amount of mnk in controller lobbies. Fortnite did this and most people using xim just went into pc lobbies.

Incredibly fun op, Half decent load and just picking him sees the attackers rethink their strategy of just smoke and plant.

I don't play siege as much as rocket league, but if I don't rage quit off of rocket, the only other way I get off is by getting bored after winning 2/3 matches in a row. doesn't make any sense why I'd want to get off when I'm doing so well, since I could easily rank up a lot, but that's me

That's pretty epic bro, now you gotta get to 420

I agree with this, but I also see it as necessary. It's not like the black ice skin posts, I see them over and over and I still dont care.
---
 *diamond smurf enters*

Stop caring. When you take competitive games too seriously, every little thing annoys you and ruins your fun. But know there is nothing wrong with wanting to get better, rank up and getting frustrated when you lose. It's human nature. But if you're like me who has been playing Siege for a long time now, you eventually burn out and just playing the game isn't fun. Once you stop taking yourself and the game too seriously you realise Siege is just that, a game. So goof around, do stupid shit and laugh when you try to rush and get instantly executed. Me and my mates jump on ranked and do strat roulette and it is so funny. Other players will definitely say you suck and insult you for messing around but who cares what they think. If you're going to get in a bad mood for losing a game of Siege, you seriously to need to reevaluate why you play video games in the first place.
---
TL;DR: Stop caring. Goof around. Have fun, at the end of the day it's just a video game.
---
Wait, what?

My issue is just getting one tapped by people who are prone while I run out to kill them

We don't do that. We are competitive but calling each other trash won't win the game constructive criticism will help but just "why didn't you do that or this" won't help you or your teammates. We have level of trust in ur squad if somebody tell me do jump out of tower I will even if defuser is planted and I am last one alive.

Bruh we found  elite twitch irl.

The problem is it‚Äôs not even hard if someone does their research they can learn how to do it in about an hour

There are a ton of 400+ players atm.

The precedent of large companies legally bullying and censoring anybody whose voice they don't like.

Ban players who break the terms of service, as they've already been doing. That is the only course of action they can *[legally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_v._ElcomSoft_Sklyarov)* take.

they totaly deserv it \^\^'
---
That mechanic in itself is not used properly. 90% of the time where I have seen or even committed an accidental team kill, people will say it's intentional. People on this game are too unforgiving and really it just goes to show that everyone is toxic, even if it's just by saying an accidental team kill was intentional.

Aim labs, free, and allows you to mirror your siege sens settings - although I will say the best training is t hunts

after 1:30 you can relauch the matchmaking

That shit happens way to often. Does anyone know if cases like that are even considered in the mmr loss?

Like if play 3v5 and lose, I should at least lose less mmr. Or is it calculated with the initial team setup?

Honestly you can‚Äôt stop it, all you can do is file a report to MS via the built in report system. If enough people do that, then MS will take action, like one or even ten people might be lying or just frustrated, but 30, 50, 100?

rather tell us why you think so before we try to change your mind

Naw. I don't even notice that part of the screen anymore; It's mentally blocked out.

this happened to me. only way to fix it is to manually change your datacenter - theres a ubisoft support article on how to do that. also, in the main menu it may glitch after manually changing it (showing 991828382919182 etc ping) - don‚Äôt worry about it. if it shows a high amount but an actually realistic amount (4000+) you may have changed to the wrong datacenter.
---
PS. some datacenter‚Äôs names have been changed and not updated either in settings or in the article. for example, EAS is now SEAS.
---
Maybe add Bartlett too?

yeah if for example maverick makes a hole he can much better locate the positions based off the sound.                     it goes both ways basically
---
Ya got me there guy
---
With the help of a counteracting good team and proper coordination, interrogations are possible. But I must agree with you on this one point about rarely getting interrogations as you are usually in a better position to finish off the downed operator rather than interrogating them.  It'll push back the other members of the team and possibly ruin our coordination and knowledge of the other teams whereabouts. Great point my friend.

it does 65 damage max

Which is negligible. Both weapons will take same amount of bullets to dropdown a player. Damage can be reduced to compensate for clear sight aswell in case

Go to r/rainbow6 find the 3 dots and click them, you should then see an option to ‚Äúchange user flair‚Äù click that and you can choose from preset flairs that have X operator and main with either their icon or a chibi. You can also make custom ones like I and a lot of others do.

I activated it and it gave me a notification that I had something new in Home. But it wasnt there so I restarted the game and then the Xbox. I keep checking back everyday and I still have a blue dot by Home despite no notifications or anything else. So I've just accepted the fact that I grinded Showdown for nothing.
---
It's based around a strategy, like how if they put a Mira on a wall they may blow out several walls infront of it to give Mira a sight further ahead. This way Mira can oversee more, making her more effective and good. Sometimes it could just be a rotation hole, and sometimes it's for sights. But usually they base it around a strategy.

It starting 4v5 means someone already left as it was starting.

Usually someone else would connect if its casusl but not at match point (to prevent someone from joining and not getting to play at all).

2 people dc'ing, be it from them choosing to quit, having bad connections or server hopping still have nothing to do with the game balance at all.

Another question, what is the headshot threashold
---
When someone says Cav needs nerfing
---
Only does 99 of your close enough to melee its drop off is huge especially after the change in which its worse off at closer ranges it's why her only decent role was as an anchor til the change now she's just a worse vigil/jaeger
---
Reading back on my notifications
---
I just watched a video today and there was yet again..another clash glitch I‚Äôm tired

If after a YEAR of the map being out, you are getting lost, then maybe the problem is you and not the map.

Either ping abusers, bad internet, or they possibly don't want hackers. Either way, why??

While she's indeed immune to Jackal while having the ability on, she isn't immune to lion.

Only vigil is immune, and standing on a Jammer also counters it.

Echo and Mute counter Dokka already.

That said sure, remove phones as an option. But also take the ability to check cameras/drones and see team pointers for spottings.

If she sneaks up behind me I‚Äôm still caving in her skull
---
Another thing: if I turn on the game infos (ping and fps) it shows 0 ping and 0 fps.
---
So cool!
---
What gets me is how nitro cell sticks to ceilings and stuff but cant stick to a ballistic shield
---
"I fucked up".
---
Just because you are bad, it doesn't mean it is wrong.
---
Yeah i did
---
It was originally basic facepaint, but it didn't look enough like Caveira, so I had to add some detail to it
---
Being in the elevators when it collapses is the worst thing
---
Lol we are making a lot of assumptions about this scene in order to call these guys stupid, I don't see any problems here, looks like they are moving a VIP while shielding him with their bodies and Warden is providing counter fire while moving/drawing their fire. VIP could have taken a bullet or needs help walking, if anything, the enemies are pulling off a successful attack...
---
Why do you care about these skins? Most of the time they aren't even the best looking ones for their weapons, people just want them because they're rare and think it makes them special in any way.
---
It's  3- piece not ace
---
Maybe more people will actually try to do the challenge then

*Well you see Tars, to move forward we have to push forward, it‚Äôs Newton‚Äôs third law.*

I haven‚Äôt seen boosting yet, I would just try your best to get to gold and it might slow down.

Nope

Yeah and jumping meanwhile if falling is epic but mostly of times a pilar hits you

I‚Äôm plat
---
You melted him!
---
Why not both
---
You only like it because it's rare? Does it make you feel better? Do you need to compensate for something?
---
Houdini strikes again
---
Had over 40 games in a row starting Defence.
---
Suddenly we started attack and all my squad mates couldn't believe it.
---
Alibi is fun to play.
---
plus it looks horrible compared to 90% of the other skins in the game. Hell I will uses Plasma pink before i use any of this years B-day skins and I only want to run it on P-chan (P-90 from SAO alternative)
---
Alibi
---
I bet you‚Äôre shit
---
Melee should always be the rifle butt animation and it should have a stun/knock back effect instead of an instant kill
---
Goddamn magicians
---
Nope Ubisoft fixed this a while ago and higher ping gives you a disadvantage when it comes to peeking and generally play . Lower ping the better. You can even search it up
---
Profiles are all Japanese. All placed in Asian from gold 2 to plat 1
---
Master magician
---
Why?
---
Actually same
---
Why is this man getting downvoted for saying don‚Äôt play casual
---
Ok thanks
---
This never happens to me, are you new?
---
Well you get the N-word **pass**
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
Because of their kit.
---
It's balancing, to not make you a one man army, it really makes sense.
---
If you have the same capacity as Ash with Maverick, you can make loads of small holes and you won't care when you miss shots.
---
Okay, cookie for you! üòÇ
---
PS4/They places in Asia/Accounts are Japanese. 
---
Ping advantage, peak advantage. 
---
Just stay on your servers. There‚Äôs no reason for a five stack from Asia to jump to NA servers.
---
Nice
---
Hmmm i've played blackbeard J√§ger Lion and Lesion (because they ban echo all the time) only on my smurf acc and didnt get banned..... HMMM
---
Good Job man I did this by accident when I started the game
---
Actually it isn't, looks nice nonetheless
---
'hey so i guess we'll give them 2 packs, 1 per week as usual?'
---
'maybe if we only give them a skin for week 2, they will be more tempted to buy packs!'
---
ubisoft logic
---
New broken ops? Which ops are broken? Non of them are even overpowered, you just cant adapt.
---
F90 is like another AUG, with little to no recoil at all. Decent fire rate as well. Only downside is using a 1 speed operator. Same with Fuze and the AK-12.
---
I just played against these guys. They we shooting on their screens before we could see them. They had about 1 second advantage on us
---
Fucking lag or my aim is shit
---
I love how Ubi basically said F- America with no 4th of july charm. Sure they got a western themed event but no Charm for our southern cousins.
---
I got plat 1 this season but I dropped cuz I was bored :/
---
He‚Äôs always viable
---
I usually expand that to "well i fucked that all up"
---
Most of them get finished on the weekend when more people have time to play
---
they arent actually adidas but they have the resemblance.
---
Lol r6 is a bit toxic nyways do ya play i need teammates
---
Well new clubhous has Cash and CCTW which manages to make that work, second strongest site on the map.
---
That makes sense.  Maybe it could be something locked onto certain roamers?  For example, Echo doesn't get called at all, and there's another operator that doesn't get called the first time around, can't remember if it's Lesion or Frost, but on of the trap ops.  Either way, I can see how op this would be and kinda nullify Dokka.
---
When attacking Consulate Garage, you can rappel upside down on Piano window and get any Bandit batteries or Mute jammers through the floor without exposing yourself.
---
Thnx
---
It's not even that bad imo. I used to only play LoL much worse. Siege is very tolerable.

Lookie at the chat

Oh he took a screenshot alright. Just the took a picture of that screenshot and uploaded it here.
---
ubisoft after some complaints we have decided to remove ranked altogether to help fix and balance the game
---
Hadn‚Äôt got a chance to start it. Someone else did though.
---
Funneee funneeeee.  In all seriousness though this was just a thought, not a completed rework with no tweaking at all whatsoever.
---
God, that fuckin heli.
---
I managed to take one of those guys out once and I got flamed with messages calling me trash and that I should kms
---
Dont do the glitch
---
Make sure to play vertically if the point has a soft floor
---
You can see defenders on their phones, echo on his yokai and vigil using his ability
---
This is what I've picked up from playing iq every so often
---
We've all had this type of burnout....a break will usually do the trick
---
Whenever I play shanghai I just want to relax on a roof somewhere and have a fight with enemy snipers. I barely even look at the tower. Then I hear it falling and I brace myself. It‚Äôs hell on earth man.
---
shield player can go die in a hole
---
She should‚Äôve done.
---
Awesome! Hopefully, I can help ya one day!
---
Well if you pay attention to the detail of the image, you'd see that they just started taking fire that side. Barely any bullet holes and look at the bottom of Wardens suit, it's flared out in the sense that he just quickly turned around to shoot at the incoming fire.
---
Yeah, I can see where you're coming from, and I don't disagree entirely, but seeing as Echo can already avoid all phone calls, I'd want to get something similar for roamers, even if that doesn't mean every operator specifically or just removing phones.
---
They did it because it's objectively more balanced than other modes, and because Ranked is supposed to reflect the skill of players, it needs modes and maps specifically balanced for that.
---
Casual is supposed to be mindless fun, Ranked is for people who have fun getting sweaty.
---
I'd do that, but he's one chunky boi, so they'd be able to hear the clap of my ass cheeks all the way down the hallway.

It's unbalanced as hell though.

Oof.

Holy shiit chill out I'm just saying

"Hur durrr old Hereford good new bad" that's what this thread is. Seriously nostalgia bias is blinding people. Old Hereford was God awful to  defend.

Nomad.
---
Sadly this would help a lot
---
I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm thinking since it‚Äôs only possible for you to get you can only get a maximum of 13 headshots per game if the enemy team has an absolute god and two trash players and the god player clutched twice, and if your two other teammates do absolutely nothing all game.
---
Jokes on you, I'm Gold III.  In all honesty I got carried almost every game by strangers (I solo queued), so I'm more of a Bronze II.  Which means once again, jokes on you, you just moved me up to Silver, seeing as you considered me to be that.
---
I'd say holding it is fine, attacking it is awful.
---
We should start a GoFundMe to help ubi pay for glock licensing lol
---
I don't use her cause she look like she would have a bigger hitbox
---
At first I was expecting an interrogation ace. Then I expected horrible awful lag. Then I get _this_.
---
Ahh yess... One of the most intense battlefield map
---
Vertical play is key.    Example: if you‚Äôre attacking lockers on border clear out the bottom floor and you can get 90% of the defenders gadgets by shooting them through the ceiling
---
I agree I came back to the game recently and was so lost in Hereford haha
---
It pains me how many people think there are hacks (walls, aimbot ect) available on next gen consoles.
---
Absolutely riveting commentary.  Thank you for your valuable input.
---
Fair enough lol
---
Nah you're mistaking orcas for blue whales
---
I'm guessing you aren't playing much ranked nowadays
---
Given as they're cheating...
---
Yeah but orcas are like the best ocean apex predator and she kills people and like BW don‚Äôt kill stuff they just swallow
---
but he never said "this is an over-reaction?

The shit you see before death.

Most likely.

Can confirm. Killed a guy last night and was like ‚Äúhe should have killed me, he must have been reloading‚Äù
---
Omg dude the god pilots in their little birds that outmaneuver and outplay fighter jets holy hell.
---
Very sensible opinion.  Thanks for your addition to the conversation.
---
Also if the enemy has a pulse you can hunt him pretty easily since iqs gadget has a longer range than pulses scanner you can see him before he can see you
---
Eh maybe, however I‚Äôm a believer that if you get killed with body shots you deserve to die (in the game).

Constantly getting bad maps?

Consoles don't have to worry

I mean is this tower? I think you mean skyscraper... there are Japanese letters on the buildings

Play the fun maps that aren't in ranked. What else is in casual other than casual superstars, toxicity and people constantly leaving/joining?
---
Happens to me to when I see those types of cameras

Bad bot!
---
Its a gamemode not perminate
---
Make sure you set your pc to 144 in your windows settings first
---
Is their a way to preventing them from getting your IPs?

You should get buck. Just a more versatile sledge

But imagine if that guy was where he shot! 
---
Dead!
---
Next time on Siege side effects...
---
This still happens?

Good job Ubitards.
---
yeh cuz of no accusations rule :C
---
When you rush do hard you get a bug stuck in your eye
---
This looks so staged
---
I'll be sure to check that when I get back to my PC :)
---
There are some moments when I understand it's an accident, but the person is so clumsy with the way they shoot that I just turn on reverse friendly fire for mine and my teammates saftey
---
yeah, no, i hate it
---
Yeah man a little too late.
---
Just imagine this next time , she kills you
---
Pulls out ak12 and starts firing while setting up a charge on top of a billiards room
---
Well I was just saying to revert her because it's obvious the claymore ain't working.
---
Their ping is not one second. But even if it was, that‚Äôs just not how it works. 
---
Peeker‚Äôs advantage *is* a thing, but the peeker having a higher ping doesn‚Äôt make it a bigger advantage.
---
Let‚Äôs say 2 people each have 50ms ping. The instant one of them peeks around a corner, they will see where the other player was sitting 50ms ago - if that person is stationary, that‚Äôs just as good as seeing into the future. Meanwhile the other player needs to wait for the server to be told the peeker has rounded the corner (25ms) and to relay that information to them (+25ms). It‚Äôs a 50ms head start for the peaker, even with no ping abuse. 
---
Now let‚Äôs say the peeker‚Äôs ping is 300. They will ‚Äúsee into the future‚Äù where you are as they round a corner. Meanwhile, their position will take 150ms to register with the server, and then another 25ms to get to you. So, they see you 175ms before you see them. 
---
But here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs not a bigger advantage: even if they shoot the instant they round the corner, that shot needs to register with the server before it can kill you. And it takes 150ms for their shot to transmit to the server. Meanwhile, it only takes your shots 25ms to transmit to the server. If your shot registers before their shot, then their shot will be invalid, because they are dead. This negates 125ms of the peeker‚Äôs advantage (150 - 25). 
---
So then what‚Äôs the peeker‚Äôs advantage? It‚Äôs 175 - 125 = 50ms. The *exact same*. The peeker‚Äôs advantage is determined by YOUR ping, not the ping of the peeker. If you round the corner against someone with high ping, that is YOUR bigger advantage.
---
Cyanide and Happiness should never touch R6 content.  This is proof of why.
---
I‚Äôve used that discord for over year and have never ran into anyone even slightly toxic. And I‚Äôve played with all ranks from copper to low plat
---
now look up spawn rush and spawn kill then look at **spawn** peek again
---
The highest rank i've ever been was gold one but that was my first season and i know I've gotten better since then but rainbow was like, "Hey, Fuck you for no reason" and i've been silver ever since.
---
That looks pretty nice but I wish they changed the mag color to match it. It looks so out of place
---
Hostage KIA. You have been banned for teamkill.
---
agreed, it's the same on all mp5 skins, so ugly on black ice
---
When I try to roast someone in class and stutter
---
I'm pretty sure doing that is a banable offense
---
Just toss your EMP grenade. ;)
---
Smokes would be even worse, adding to her utility in general is not something that needs done
---
The best way to play Montagne is to balance between passive and aggressive imo. If they're a passive Monty, you can almost just ignore them when they sit in a corner and look for their teammates instead. But if that same Monty has shown to be aggressive with him, it makes them a *much* bigger distraction when you don't know when or if they're going to drop their shields and gun you down or run up to you to smack your shit in
---
Lol
---
Just start taking turns headshotting each other boys
---
Looks like the halo reach mission before the glassing
---
Stay away from engaging multiple enemies at once. Her guns are terrible so she sucks against two or more people but if you manage to hide and can surprise a single enemy without coverage it's usually a very easy interrogation, which can single-handedly change the outcome of a round
---
I don‚Äôt really have any reason to stage this... It wouldn‚Äôt really be worth it either, but I don‚Äôt know how to prove it to you :/
---
Dont worry guys, ranked is fix, trust me. 
---
 Love, ubi ‚ù§
---
My first reaction is "how" and then a 1ms later I am going "well, I knew it was stupid, but I tried to anyway".
---
Usually happens when I try to runout, while knowing I missed the opportunity anyway.
---
I mean everyone is just standing still
---
Vigil, objectively.
---
I believe they removed it once Phantom Sight was released and the whole pick-and-ban system was intergrated along with the bomb only gamemode.
---
When life gets good with you and give you a depressed girlfriend exactly like you:
---
Imagine if we had different variants for every gadget
---
Yeah ik right
---
Who else is on the boat of people that don't think we'll be able to reach the goal by the end?
---
Just checked with the Wikia page and I was wrong about vigil
---
Remove counterplay how exactly? It‚Äôs not like monty can protect all 4 of his team mates, plenty of ways nowadays to beat smoke+plant behind monty.  He‚Äôs also not even that safe in a 1v1 if the defender knows how to duel against him. However, it is insanely easy to 1v1 people who don‚Äôt know what to do against a shield 1v1 and let you keep them in your optimal range (about 5m, hipfire will hit, but too far for them to melee you).
---
I made a pick-up line for her... It's pretty similar to that, 'i'd love to interrogate you all night.'
---
You're welcome!
---
Sounds like you have a hard time dealing with her. May I remind you we‚Äôve had to deal with Montagne since the beginning and look at him now, still the impenetrable op he is. Clash at least has many ways to counter her like Capit√£o, Nomad, Grenades, hell just simply pushing her if she is by herself and Mekong the shield to expose her to gunfire. She isn‚Äôt getting removed bud, just get better.

You don't fuze hostage dont ya

People who complain about ‚Äúrecoil‚Äù just arent accustomed to the gun. Ive had multiple aces with elas scorpion so just because it kicks a little too much for your personal taste doesnt make the gun bad..learn to aim head level or quit crying about guns being ‚Äúbad‚Äù
---
U are the bane
---
Nice. I‚Äôve been stating to use her more with my Squad and she is a boss. The only thing I have to worry about is if they have a Capit√£o/Nomad and if they kill the majority of my team like they did in your clip.

Did you buy cheap Credits?

I actually jumped

The alda is the best gun in the game

You gotta be Drax dude

Nah, we ok. I just forgot to update my flair, I'm a mozzie main now.

No hate or anything but how many people either don‚Äôt have or don‚Äôt know about Print Screen?

Dang mine is only 2
---
I never see people using it tho so dunno how well known it is
---
Depends. Do you want to be a licensed contractor or a CTU operator?
---
But they're banning people who use them. So that's something.
---
No every primary in game more has a generalized recoil pattern. It's "random" but it's a set pattern in the it can only go within a specific area making it generalized. The scorpion is the only primary though that's not given a generalized pattern and is primarily random. By itself making it the worst gun in game.

Prediction, ubi expecting a spike in players and progress over the weekend. Gets to Monday and they realise they seriously underestimated and it's sitting at under 2 million still. Challenge target is revised to 2 million so their skin efforts aren't wasted.
---
Yes because moments like that affect the numbers. Tons of people genuinely saying they will quit if they start making it china friendly. And it was new noise. The siege community has been complaining about cheaters, bugs, sound issues, unbalanced operators forever.
---
Monty straight up doesn't lose any 1v1s if he's half way decent, what the fuck are you talking about? I'm not even going to bother with this, glhf
---
Quit using the excuse of the glitches to make a call of action to give IQ grenades. She was too good with them and as for giving Clash a bulletproof cam that wouldn‚Äôt make any sense to her kit in general. Give them time, it‚Äôs been tough to iron out these problems considering they have probably been in the game for longer then we think.
---
That would be marvellous!

Just drone it out lmao

you gotta go outside and hang out with people long enough to miss video games, then you can get back to them

I think the servers are down on xbox
---
If you play ranked with your friends there should be no reason your mmr values are so far apart.   There's always casual to play with your friends.
---
That is very much true for all things to be fair.
---
When you are having an overall good experience you tend to just enjoy it, keep at it and not really think about it too much.
---
If you have a bad experience it marks you, it makes you uncomfortable and leads you to do other things, such as go on the internet and make a rant post or something.
---
While it's very much fair and normal that some things will lead to critical feedback, it is also to note that for every ranting player there are another thousand or so having a laugh with mates as they play if not many more.
---
So kudos for wanting to be the other side of the medal.
---
It‚Äôs called a user flair.
---
This is the little gremlin that is spawned by the demon in the corner of your room, which then tries to stab you when you have sleep paralysis
---
I think it's actually a pretty good representation of reality. If someone's in the next room you'll still mainly hear them through the open door to the side.
---
Also irl I find myself often confused about where a sound is coming from, especially where verticality is involved.
---
The system's not perfect, but it beats getting shot through walls all the time.
---
No I mean I get TKd.. I just thought it was somehow related to the fancy headshot you made. Sorry my fault. Their is quite a lot of immature tkers on console.
---
Did you get nervous toward the end?
---
most people who hate on it say the dot is too big to be accurate at range, and it is true that the dot on it is larger than the middle dot on the holo sight

Ned Flanders avenging his wife's death, colorized

Extended barrel reduces the drop off of damage over distance
---
1. Damage doesn‚Äôt start to drop off until 15 - 25 meters depending of the weapon class
---
2. Most engagements in siege are within less than 10m

Damn this is some next level analysis

He was just trying to outline where the other guys body was for reference later.
---
I mean it was obvious he was at the window, I swear some players just have no game sense and call hacks for the dumbest things
---
Dude, read your own post, you‚Äôre literally not making any sense. Why would u/ADMIN_R6 tell his group he was walking? Because he didn‚Äôt dumbass, he meant the person he killed messaged his group and told them that ADMIN was walking. JFC dude calm down.
---
OMG yes, it pisses me off because I'll try to switch it and accidentally bring the shotty instead of p90
---
I don‚Äôt get it. You wallbanged a guy. So?
---
Its called alt f4
---
no. Both chat exploiters and glitchers. They both are dubbed as "exploiters" so it gets a bit confusing.

If the dot was smaller and the case was thinner it would be my favorite
---
Slimeball shield
---
If you are referring to the main entrance spawn point on the east side of the map... then yes I do know where it is. Just to be clear, if a defender say broke the main door and peeked outside or peeked from the south stairs window by theatre in the first few seconds of a round and killed an attacker, would you classify that as a spawnpeek? If so then how come mine isn‚Äôt when I‚Äôm doing pretty much the same thing at the same point of a round and killing them in a location only a few metres away from the others?

Haven‚Äôt played in a long time, I thought they were all given out for free?
---
I think next year it should be a birthday hat head gear for the op so you could have a birthday charm with a birthday weapon skin with a birthday headgear
---
&gt; Most of the good skins are in alpha packs
---
My biggest issue with alpha packs is being able to get duplicates.
---
I'd really love for that to go away, or at least duplicate commons.
---
UwU notices your claymore
---
Its so they only make one skin for both hibana and echo
---
If enough people report maybe.
---
I think it should have something like mira's gas canister. That way you can counter it from above/below or sneak a twitch drone in to take it out, aka it needs a counter
---
They removed that feature for new accounts for whatever reason
---
Completely understandable but this is just a friendly joke with no intention to offend anybody and I only meant to make people smile

This is way too much ADHD for me, but props on your work anyway homie.
---
Just got an 8 kill mvp game moth frost. Thank you so much! No ace tho :/
---
She has a swelter skelter inspired uniform already but, this I like
---
I got deranked for inactivity even though I haven't left my computer for 2 hours. Nice
---
Thank you üôèüèª
---
Btw, did you ace?

Hello,   
---
One of our main goals is complete fraud protection for our partners and for you, there players. We know that verifying you're card may be a minor inconvenience, but we believe that keeping you're info that much more secure is worth an extra minute or two, and we hope you agree.
---
Agreed. Same reason I prefer PC now to console for my Siege.
---
It won't let him even search for a match
---
Mine is stuck at 3/8 and I know 100% its not going up as I just tested it. I won a round with Glaz and finished the game and when I opened club again after I was back at the main menu it was still at 3/8.
---
Neither. They will play low golds/high silvers most likely
---
No it‚Äôs only in showdown
---
Maybe his internet garbo
---
restart game before posting here
---
This recently happened to me when I was playing as doc. I also tried to use my stim pistol and shot it into myself, but it gave me no health.
---
Restart ur game.
---
so basically in between of both of their ranks
---
Cyanide and Interrogation
---
doesn't matter who's party leader, it takes everyones mmr and puts it together
---
Yea it takes the mmr average
---
Yes, but showdown has a lower percent boost and also applies if you get a pack, winning is +0.7 I believe
---
Any channel like that can go fuck itself as far as I'm concerned. I never give them credence.
---
I'm gold and have not met a single hacker
---
Ree I thought I did but thanks anyways
---
Really only happens if your whole team is trying to help you get it. There are plenty of rounds where you have the opportunity to get all 5 kills be you're better or whatever, but chances are, your team gets at least one kill.
---
Thats when you hit em with "what more could I do"
---
Wrong. It's a computer science issue. Detection of emulation hardware is hard.
---
*bonk*
---
She‚Äôs still really great.  You‚Äôll get used to her with some more time put in.
---
He is a leaker, he always put a lot of watermarks becauase people always steal his leaks without giving credit.
---
Last thing he leaked where Lesion &amp; Smoke elites and the proleague sets (the ones that are actually on store and IQ &amp; Tachanka new ones)
---
It‚Äôs pretty cool though
---
oh okay makes sense now. i wasn't for sure
---
I do agree that it can be good with echo's play style, but when one of the only reasons it can be good is that you can use another gun, somethings wrong
---
What?

Near the end of season maybe, at least if I remember right that was when Bandit one got released.

Dang. People got pretty triggered over a joke lol

‚ÄúNothing personal kid heh‚Äù

Stop caring so much.
---
Not really... game still looks like it could be released today

I rock the all black uniform with the Fleur De Lis face paint. Best I can do. ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Surprise motherfucker
---
Where is this located?
---
I mean I have been solo queuing so...
---
It doesnt have to be just females I asked who you all think is the thiccest doesnt gotta be females
---
True dat
---
It could have leaked 6 months in advance dude. When something is leaked has nothing to do with how close it is to release.
---
It would of been better if you were playing cav lmao

---
It may be the biggest number stored in a number of games, but it really is dependent on the game developers.
---
Here is the reason:
---
A bit is a single 0 or 1.
---
A byte is eight 0s or 1s.
---
A developer has to decide how many bytes they want to use for a variable that can store an integer number.
---
1 byte = 0 to 255
---
2 bytes = 0 to 65535
---
3 bytes = 0 to 16777215
---
4 bytes = 0 to 4294967295
---
So it looks like the number may be stored in a variable that is 4 bytes. However you will notice that the digit could be 395 larger and still just fit in 4 bytes.
---
Question... Spoopy Nokk maybe???

nah mate sorry. *Blam

"Kotz" or "kotzen" is german and means "puke".

Yeah this shit is embarrassing.

It really was

Yeah this used to happen and it was playing chicken where whoever didn‚Äôt leave won

Gridlock be like "Didn't you hear my dummy thicc ass? TO BAD"

In the Infirmary.
---
Why do they always use the bad gun?
---
Try plugging the cord from the monitor to the computer into the graphics card if that is not what you have right now.
---
u/I_wana_fuck_Twitch is gonna do what they call a pro gamer move
---
Nice.
---
This was a solo que btw
---
how old am I then?
---
Which makes it a Microsoft/Sony issue since they would have to find a way to detect it. *Rolls eyes*
---
What stats are y'all looking for, plus what servers do you guys play on?
---
You missed the first three shots....
---
i would‚Äôve screamed
---
Happens from time to time on challenges. Sometimes if you hop on the next day it‚Äôs all there.. sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt count them. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This should tell us that there needs to be another projectile denial op.
---
report ppl who do this, they'll sooner or later get bans for boosting.
---
Which ones?
---
Thats what restart means lol
---
Had someone on the opposing do that in ranked after i already pushed up to it. Needless to say he was an easy kill. I think he tried to block a LOS through the trains into bunks
---
yikes
---
jw is that the emerald camp or the cobalt/cyan
---
15 mate
---
I believe its in reference to an Australian outlaw named [Ned Kelly](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Kelly)
---
yeah its a joke mr general of the us army
---
Yeah but could you imagine Ela running down a hallway near you while hearing the terrifying flutter of the wings knowing you were about to get ghosted at point blank range by a semi auto hand held howitzer?
---
For a second I thought it was a third mozzie  main
---
Well done man. Still trying to do that myself.
---
Thanks! It‚Äôs my first one
---
Aetuif is a professional R6 player. I think they made an easter egg of something he said, not sure though
---
I agree but I‚Äôm also upset with how you get ranked and stuff cuz I have a 1.4 kd this season
---
Lmao, wasn't sure cuz this is the second time this has happened in 2 days.
---
I'm sure 30 minutes of your life at worst is completely inconsequential.
---
Cyan I believe I don‚Äôt remember of the top of my head when I confirm I will tell you
---
I‚Äôm having the same issues. I‚Äôm usually a high silver low gold player, but ranked this season isn‚Äôt doing it for me. No matter how well I do, my team falls short. I‚Äôll have teammates that don‚Äôt have any sort of awareness and don‚Äôt play the objective. I‚Äôm sitting in silver 4 right now, and I don‚Äôt want to even play ranked to boost it because I know I won‚Äôt get good teammates. And even when I play with friends like maybe 1 or 2 of them are actually decent and know what to do and don‚Äôt potato aim. It‚Äôs just annoying to have teammates who aren‚Äôt competent and look at the person planting defuser and don‚Äôt even try to shoot them. Maybe I should ‚Äúget good‚Äù, but who knows
---
Ok thank you!
---
At least you have a shield too.
---
Bro fixing this problem (like turning on RFF permanently) would just ruin the tactical feel of the game. Without FF there‚Äôs no realism. Just suck it up and I hope you get better teammates. 
---
It‚Äôs just a horrible community, but you got into that once you bought the game
---
Well it would kick you if you TK‚Äôd twice, at least now you‚Äôre limited to one before it reflects the damage back. But there‚Äôs no way to stop a squad if they wanna take turns
---
honestly a lot of the year 3 are good and do their own things nicely just depends on your playstyle/what you want
---
I also enjoy mozzie/gridlock, not so much warden/nokk
---
if you don't know what they do, I highly suggest doing some quick searches
---
You mean, a 30 minute ban? I am okay with that. I don't want to lose renown, because I am trying to save up for a new operator.
---
Everything seems to be in order. Git gud
---
Spin the wheel
---
Mozzies weapons make him a clutch machine
---
The bullet goes to the top of the triangle with the reflex scope and you can clearly see that you shot everywhere but his head.
---
its 15 min ban. and then like 15 more min of a -50% renown reduction if you gain any during that time
---
Draws have been removed in Burnt Horizon I believe. You used to have double OT, but it was really rare and hard to get. 
---
Now tho, it‚Äôs impossible
---
Drone should be able to knock someone out with that velocity
---
MP5 is way better in my opinion.
---
Thats true, her elite is great
---
that's because they're not banned yet..
---
You might lose some ELO as well for not joining back but im not sure
---
Depends on how you like playing, but overall I'd argue that all ops after Lion and Finka are solid, maybe Clash and Warden are less on the flat out strong side if you plan to pick up and solo play, but they both can be exceptional if used well in the right scenario.
---
Notable ops I'd recommend: Alibi, Maestro, Maverick, Nomad and Mozzie.
---
I know. That is why I am out of luck.
---
What does it have to do with Keanu Reeves.
---
This would only be benificial with low recpil guns tho, and the only one i can think about is Frosts 9MM smg
---
Nice lag
---
I know, that's the problem, i think the tking system needs to focus more on protecting the victim than punishing the perpetrator
---
The problem is, I cannot join back the game. It just tries to matchmake me into another ranked game.
---
Nonm
---
Eh ddosing is such a common occurrence generally nothing comes of it and let's face it. A vpn will do fuck all if the government want you done
---
There isn‚Äôt a certain thing you do, just play normal and you will get it eventually. There are times in a casual though where you have 4 and are running around frantically looking for the final guy to get the ace haha
---
5 enemy kills, one round.  That's it.
---
Although I will give you bonus points if you mix in a team kill for a 6-pack.
---
This is what too many spawnpeeks does to the human brain
---
So if I play in the 15 minutes of the ban, all the renown that I earn will be -50%; not the amount of renown that I have now?
---
If you look at the stats its better too!
---
He kills himself if his HP is low so he won't lose his KD
---
U/i_wana_fuck_twitch
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
I‚Äôve had that happen before and I lost ELO, but that was a long time ago. I‚Äôve had one instance where I matchmaked on accident and I backed out before I joined a lobby and it said I was in a game and I tried to connect to it, but I didn‚Äôt lose anything from it so you might not lose any
---
Keep calm buddy
---
That's why I really wanted her cowboy hat from the showdown event, I didn't get it sadly.
---
You just missed
---
Restart your game. That fixes it
---
Luck based was the wrong term used, I was trying to convey that those exploits/glitches make it harder for other players to have a fair fight against you when you can block a doorway with a shield and force attackers in a certain way or swap to your weapon so fast as pulse that the opposing player can't react and try to sneak up on you.
---
Nah, N√∏kk is. That‚Äôs how i generally gwtkills with her just flank.

Hello Lil__rice, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cc2pgj/i_broke_siege_sorry_for_the_bad_quality_of_the/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

No

Coughs up blood give him a third one
---
I mean considering they presumably changed their name to avoid the ban on the correct spelling, I think it's reasonable to ban for evading the rules alone
---
Moot
---
Did you kill the smoke?
---
teach him the importance of visibility. I remember when I was beginning, and event still some times now because of the camera change, that I thought I was *barely* sticking out and then I'd die to the angle I was peeking and I'd rewatch the killcam just to find out that half of my body was sticking out lol. you learn to hold angles from farther back so your body doesn't stick out past the corner, and hold them as tightly as you can instead of like at the middle of the door/window or whatever
---
I noticed it happens whenever I go from showdown to ranked. A fix is to just reset your game that's usually does it for me everytime.
---
I‚Äôd say 3rd best Defense weapon.
---
Can‚Äôt lose if you dos every match your about to lose lol

Throw his hammer ? *Thor intensifies*

yes

Not really a fix, more of a work around, but do you have a problem with full screen windowed?

Give it some time to update, maybe 30-60 minutes
---
I'm glad to see everyone agrees so far
---
Don‚Äôt worry no one will be accusing you of it.
---
Yeah it gets like that, when unable to callout the name of the room a good ping always does the job and just describing wht they are doing is usually enough to satisfy my friends. And yeah i agree its just behind sledge-hammering someone for most satisfying ways to kill people.

at least we could probs buy it this year with renown like we could the last year's skins

Yeah we just get ddosers.

**siege turns into a game where the highest level players throw hammers at each other**

Its clear irony.
---
A sneaky Sledge can be as scary as Caviera and N√∏kk, change my mind
---
Probably cause no one will use them on the good ones cause there‚Äôs already better skins
---
I posted something like this when Hibanas elite came out,but people apparently didn‚Äôt notice the priceü§£
---
It could be like an ash charge but better
---
Fuck you that's why
---
Because they r banning for a thing that had to be typed in game chat console doesn‚Äôt have a game text chat
---
For Honor has the same thing, but you don't get anything for doing it and it's a simple stat system at the end of match scoreboard... Easy to implement into r6
---
God that would be so cool to have it back. But it did block more of the screen
---
It worked thank you.

The only difference between gridlock and caveira is that gridlock is 5x easier to hear

Lol sure you would. Are you The Mountain?

Because Kix is a guzzler for this game and his job is basically to say everything's good. Ask KingGeorge, you know the no.1 streamer, about facing people with high ping. It's well known because when anyone faces a pinger it's always a bad time, ask someone with normal ping. Why does everyone with high ping pick a 3 speed and sprint everywhere? Why are they always peeking? They know exactly what they're doing.

Nuclear flavored.

Windowed resets my aspect ratio so yes.

He just leaves the game if he‚Äôs gonna lose, it doesn‚Äôt affect stats then.
