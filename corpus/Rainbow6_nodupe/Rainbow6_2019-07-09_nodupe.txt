Yes, me and my friend were talking about this today since my one on my friends just got the game

For memes Russian badger tuxbird Ap1 yumi smi77ty

I could agree with 10k too 15k that's reasonable, honestly from a business aspect Ubisoft would be shooting themselves in the foot if they gave players enough for an op in one go.
---
Try fallencurse_x haha thats my ubisoft name

Just do it how Rocket League does it with like a 10 games in that rank and it’s locked in. But this is still a terrible idea, it’s just a skill approximation in the first place it shouldn’t even give out rewards for your rank in the first place.
---
There is a discord community. Check games you play on the discord app, it might show you the link.
---
That would just make hacking/exploiting and boosting way more tempting than it already is.
---
Right our holding an angle and lay on the trigger and like half of your hundred round mag is gone and some idiot runs in front of you trying to take the kill.
---
Hanging on to dear life.
---
You are on a completely different track from what the OP is proposing because we already get rank charms that are "unique and actually make a limited appearance and shows prestige more than you getting currency to buy skins\[charms\] a copper 4 can get." 
---
You do realize the rank reward system (Siege, Rocket League, LoL) you are talking about exists literally counter to your argument regarding "\[y\]ou can’t discourage rewards because it ‘promotes’ boosting. There's a reason why every game only gives you seasonal rank cosmetics! You are arguing with yourself lol
---
You’re right there lol, people usually just call her a fatass and be done with it. Not that it really matters though, given that it’s a video game and whatnot
---
pc
---
It's like you think just because of YouTuber said it's a one tap that means the one tap you do realize idiots can post videos on YouTube as well right? Using online videos isn't a valid argument
---
thats the point, i don't play with usually. That game is fun because I dn't really need friends to play with in casual.
---
Someone did this in a g4 game. I shot a door at an angle where there could be no ads on a wall and well.... I destroyed an ads
---
whoops
---
No I’m not I’m arguing with you but it’s clearly over your head.
---
 i game I chatted i really wanted an ace when there was one opponent so they said sure so I proceeded to shoot every single one of them then clutch the round
---
Needs an acoq.
---
Was about to ask if this was console lol
---
Right now, its just,

---
Because I’m hateful. Also, as part of the community I didn’t ask for this back.
---
Lol got to plat one by abusing the shitty system, I matchmade 5 stack but 2 of my friends were bronze and 2 of them were gold/silver, *ez clap 10 win streak*
---
At that point just play ranked, also I agree with your idea
---
Nothing would change.
---
For a second i thought this is real
---
I want this! RIGHT NOW!
---
Xbox LFG already riidled with people looking for bronze placement players, this would make it way worse with that high value renknown.
---
Unlimited timer would be nice too. Maybe only for local games so we can’t stress ubi’s servers infinitely
---
people hate him cause he is strong against anyone who's alone, usually roamers, unless you get the jump on a blitz you have little chance by yourself
---
So once you get to diamond, there are no more rewards? If you place in gold, you instantly get all rewards for previous levels?
---
No ragrets.

welcome to r/rainbow6, where fan art has to be lewd to get upvotes
---
That is some real bronze game play lol
---
Go plug your controller into a computer a find out my real rank.
---
Ranked isn't intended to  be a reward system.   
---
MATCH MAKER RATING.....meant for players to be matched against people of the same skill level for more fair games. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
The friendly fire system has helped me once or twice, in casual. It discourages the continuous TK. Of course, if you are in the same team with 3 trolls, you might end dying every round. Mitigation doesn't mean trolling behaviors being erradicated. Personally, I think it was a step in the good direction. I play with friends and obviously I forgive them when mistakes are made, and TKs are going to still be done on the game and that's fair and realistic. So in that point I beg to differ. HOWEVER, the censoring of words is something that I agree with you 110%. Specially because you can still use VOIP and call them nig...s and whatever you want! Most of the hate and toxic behaviors happen against team mates and not enemies! 
---
Give them the option to mute either voice, chat, or both. That's all you need. Someone is being toxic? Mute them.
---
Someone says NI##A? Ok, censor the word! Make it appear as \*\*\*\*\* and that's all! Really, there's no need to ban people because like you say, mistakes could be made and being banned due to saying "paki" or words in other language that you have no idea what they mean is extremely infuriating...
---
haha DAE female operator? LOL, NUT!!!!
---
Season pass and diamond skin would lose all their value. Plus they would make much less money off cosmetics in general. Doubt they will do this.
---
I sent them the video though. I suppose it wasn’t convincing enough.
---
Why not?
---
Updoot this post for visibility
---
This is a good solution. Upon placement you get alpha packs equal to the number of medals you are in the ranking. For instance, if you place gold you'll get 3 right out of the gate then an additional one for each medal up.
---
Concept is great but maybe half the renown and 1-6 alpha packs sounds more realistic
---
What account??? On the one I'm currently using I got no more than 5 minutes of bb
---
I never said anything about “not”.
---
You're so hurt that theres not more people agreeing with you, to the point that you're keeping track of where this goes. You realize i only mention it because many youtubers who have a lot of attention from playing this game post the same thing. I get this is the only interaction you probably get so i wont judge you too harshly for being so upset over a video game buddy.
---
It is extremely hard to detect though, the adapter translates mnk inputs to controller so it's tricked into thinking it's a controller. Also I notice that many people just instantly call mnk when someone hits a good shot(I get a mnk message like every week and I play on 23 27 sens), I play on both and think I've only seen 2 mnk users that I can confidently identify, yes it's definitely a problem but I think people use it as a crutch excuse as to why they're losing gun fights. (Plat 1 on PC, plat 2 on Xbox)
---
That would be fair.
---
You read what I wrote right? There's a reason games don't give you 50k renown for reaching Gold, or 20 Apex Legend Packs for being an Apex Predator, or 10 Overwatch Loot Boxes for hitting Platinum. You're missing both the proposal and the context of the discussion. Because: boosting.
---
It is a good idea, it makes it as though you never played with the cheater
---
The one with the exact same name as your account
---
Ur on crack if u think I Ubi are giving free r6 credits
---
Ubi wouldn't do that, would mean a lot more people farming them and a lot less buying the whole set at every event.
---
Looks good to me

Roamer Hibana  High firerate low damage. Sorry for not seeing Earlier!

Holy shit I thought this was just slightly over your head and I just lost you in the last post or two, but it seems you were never even in the same room as me.  Jesus Christ my dude I can’t waste my time talking to someone like you anymore.  Peace out
---
What did you see in it?
---
The very few games I won last season more or less all had a random cheater on our team FML.

May the schwartz be with you!!!

Bring back red screen warning!

Yea lets drop this and see how much worst the ddosing problem gets on console. Rank dont mean anything this season with all the bugs and ddosing. I say fix the game first before its too late.
---
I think he’s awesome
---
I get voted to kick near every game i play just glad i play with a friend or two to keep me around
---
Ah man a pathological liar too? Whens awhile ago? With your mentality and terrible speech/punctuation i doubt you're no more than an intern at some firm who gets off on arguing over the internet while you fetch coffee like a good little dog you are.

ROOK IS BETTER THAN DOC
---
You’re right it doesn’t, huh I remember it’s showing that, it might have been a teaser or something, maybe a dev stream
---
I like it just decrease how much you get
---
Smoke is a far better pick than Cav or Vigil.
---
Toxicity and stupidity tend to go hand in hand
---
This game is a bazillion years old. What beta?
---
Penthouse
---
Interesting!
---
Drop pulse, vigil. Raise smoke, kap, and rook
---
Whats even more pathetic is if i was actually a kid like you wanted to jab at me and you were a mechanical engineer like you claim you'd be some fool of an adult arguing with some kid over a video game. And ofc i have extra time to be on my phone i stop working at 2:30. Lot better than your intern gig goin 9-5
---
I mean.... Everyone else has okay ping...
---
Are you telling me you'd never lost 3 in a row before in the old system? It happens, particularly when the other team is simply better. 
---
But if you think the map is defender sided, guess what? Now you get to defend 3 rounds in a row. Most maps only have 2 really viable sites. I don't think 3-0s are really happening more often than they were before. I'd be really interested in seeing the statistics from the devs after this first season. Just based on my previous seasons of ranked, my w/l rates haven't changed at all.
---
Thx
---
I think rook should be higher.
---
How long have you been playing this game?
---
Also clearly show for the hacker
---
Move kapkan up to “works well on most maps” I’m not saying that cus im a kapkan main, but the only maps he doesn’t work on are on yacht, that damn hereford base, and fortress. Due to long corridors, the amount of floors and few doorways, and breachable walls respectively
---
Jelly. I'll trade you
---
Yes
---
I play maestro or mozzie on defense usually and I'll be using my cameras and drones and then all of the sudden I'll get kicked. Fuckin ridiculous, especially since one match I got an ace and then 3 kills the next round, god damn.
---
I feel bad for you
---
During my research most everyone said doc is better and through use online i see his gadget as more useful
---
Just as clarification I was just tapping the door for no real reason I guess, I talked to the guy in chat after it happened, he said he was just running by from kitchen when I killed him. The round ended before I could actually go see where he was when I shot him.
---
I don’t agree it should be as high as it shows but it shouldn’t be too low either
---
Kinda seem salty OP
---
The fact that says nice work
---
It’s very annoying people try to do that. It’s a game rather have more teammates that can help over being down to 2 v 5 and screwed

Why do people all way say; It's not a good business on every concept that includes in game content for free. It's not like they're going to implement any of the suggestions and even if they did they decide if it's good for their business or not, not the people on Reddit or wherever.

I started off only playing ranked with another friend and now I just got my first 5 man together today.

You are out of line.... I am a siege fan and a lore fanatic.... there is lore stating they are lovers which is why I brought it up.... and Twitch was the one who said the thing about Caviera definitely not having a boyfriend... meaning Nomad suggested the guy in the pic with Cav was her BF and Twitch definitely knows it isn't... implying they are in a relationship together... I'm not conjuring things up... I'm stating facts... and how I interpret those facts to form MY OPINION.... I'm trying to have a conversation with you but you are blinded by your opinions and arent even attempting to see... just attacking me for NO REASON.... you shit on snowflakes and SJWs so much... I wonder if you realize you are more one of them than most of the people you argue with........

This game has been out since December 1st 2015. That is a standard level for people that have been playing since year one. I hate when people say this dude has no life and stuff when in actuality this game has been out for a long time.
---
The other team
---
About like that
---
This would be a really good idea the new Mortal Kombat has a ranked mode that actually gives you the in game currency that you pay for for free just for getting a high rank and playing ranked matches
---
Nobody need nerfed but Warden could use a substantial buff.
---
Haha
---
I'd be surprised of you could get 20fps on Intel HD graphics lol
---
What is Reylo?
---
because you're playing at the same level they are
---
Wait a minute...
---
How do you do that flair with multiple op symbols
---
You know what people who don’t have an app do? they download it. Pretty neat huh?
---
Ehh on a low setting without AA you might get close

when you play aganst pla mains on level 20 smurfs you dont stand a chance od rather lern 20 maps then get shit on 3\4 games

Rewards are wayyyyyyy to high but I’m down for something like this.
---
Set up and executed for views. First, no way the other team doesn’t see you at the top of the stairs. Second, I’ve been playing this game for three years. Four players in the room outside office not getting fired upon by five defenders facing the ONLY direction they can to defend that spot. Never seen five players group up and move in the same direction slowly, not firing, just outside an OBJ. And there are no defensive traps ... no boarded up doorways, no barbed wire no Kaplan on one of the only three doors into OBJ. Sorry. Obvious fake.
---
why u hate on console i play console and i do his like everyhour stfu
---
This is a great idea
---
Whats your playstyle
---
Gold 2 with a .8 isnt that much better than those low tier players youre mad about
---
rewards are waaaay too high. Give nothing at bronze, 10k silver, 25k gold ( just enough for an operator) 50k plat and 100k Diamond :)
---
R
---
E
---
Forgot they lowered the damage of breach charges on that side while increasing it on the other side for this season.
---
Lmao no he doesnt. Especially after that speed buff he got
---
Congrats !!!
---
No it happens to me as well it just happens sometimes i feel like the grenade sticks to your hit box but only the explosion
---
I try it head on as backstabbing is to easy
---
&gt;you can block a player from being teamed with you
---
That sounds like a bad idea, what if I just block everyone who's worse than me?
---
Ubisoft's games doesnt encourage anything but toxicit, laziness and greed so anything other than that should be a step up
---
That thunk of the Frost mat was incredibly satisfying
---
My first black ice wasn't even on an op I could play
---
I mean you missed your first 2 shots so... maybe he landed his.
---
&gt;Useful
---
No u should have uses them and he only gets 8 ever so u can't really spam ur just bad against lesion change my mind
---
like when it first happened maybe... but its been every season
---
Level 40 copper 3s with a .2 kd? I know I’m not the best but I’m better that that.

Lmao are you really trying to flex a terro hunt clip? What has this sub come to

I’m not.

Sieges system is fine. Most of the good skins are in alpha packs. I had every operator with renown by like level 100 or something. I just spend my renown on alpha packs these days. Ubisoft is apparently evil because people are too impatient to wait and earn things.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Meanwhile you have level 50s with every OP that they have no clue how to use because they just bought them all at once, and just play ash every round anyway. Instead of going "oh shit I saved up x renown, which op do I want?" And then actually playing that op because they invested effort into getting it.

Yea I got Hibana, felt it was overdo because of how useful she is
---
Great concept, though I would put R6 Credits out of it and the Renown should be only from 5k to 50k top.
---
Hunter x Hunter is not non-weeb friendly and neither is Angel Beats.... One is in the Top 5 rated animes on the largest anime site while the other isn't mainstream at all. The rest are non-weeb friendly.

r/im14andthisiswoooosh
---
its for really the littlest things. didnt play recruit for all recruit rush? thats a team kill. you have 0 kills thru 4 rounds? thats a team kill.
---
This is amazing
---
Unironically you just described yourself....
---
Joining an ongoing match may be annoying, but unless it's the last round, you're playing casual to relax, not competitively. Play it round to round, and not each game.
---
Thats R6 tracker which is showing the links to their profiles and is showing their EU ranks.
---
That's copper at least on pc
---
Then your pc is trash because I’m getting 2.76 download and .65 upload and no screen tearing at all just a lot of stop motion... shit even sometimes I don’t even lag at all
---
Please do.
---
EXACTLY
---
I luv this
---
I know the quality is poor, but I wanted to pump this out as fast as possible. (Also I am on xbox). Sorry.
---
I would say toake out the r6 credits as it ruins the idea behind a premium currency. Other than that it just needs some rebalancing with the amounts because renown grind is a big part of the game. Great concept though.
---
I'm just helping people who are actually stuck from it
---
Bring me pictures of ~~spider-man~~ hostage!
---
So many bullets in her damn mag for an OP based on blinding you’d think she’d have a smaller mag maybe I’m alone in this thought....
---
hmm, you ace suspiciously like a fuze, who requires 6 kills for an ace
---
Angel Beats was the first anime I watched. It’s super non-weeb friendly. 
---
I haven’t watched much of Hunter X Hunter but there isn’t any Japanese sexual humor or tropes that would make it not non-weeb friendly either
---
Gesture Warfare?
---
Razonable
---
redundant, i know, but i just wanted to put emphasis on the reality that women are human beings too because i don't think you view them that way
---
😂😂
---
And let's give cap impacts.
---
This is just more incentive to kick cheaters from games
---
1- Lesion
---
2- Doc
---
3- Hibana
---
Lol
---
I don't encounter players that are "boosting" too often so I don't know how big of a problem it is.
---
So?
---
That man has a day job AND does YouTube. Cut him some slack. He releases videos as and when he pleases and still apolgises, and still gets 2 million views per video.
---
He isn't obligated to release anything at a particular time.
---
As a valk main this touches my heart
---
Are you on pc or console. And also they most ppl that use that boostin crap are plat 2s 1s and diamonds on console
---
Even when you are unranked you have mmr points under your account. Rank and Casual MMR is counted differently so you can be a diamond rank high mmr player but a low mmr casual player since you fuck around in casual. 
---
Being unranked and levels doesnt mean anything in this game when it comes to matchmaking.
---
Apparently quite a few don't know that badger has a day job.
---
She must have borrowed an ADS from Jager.
---
Seeing players fly through walls will never get old, love her ability.
---
Do you need to read the other jack ryan books first?
---
I play on PC. I'm currently mid Plat III. I've heard from friends that a lot of the people that are in diamond on console or boost on console generally use Keyboard and mouse
---
remove R6 credits and only award the rest if at least 100 ranked matches were played in the season, matches where you played with much higher/lower ranked players will not count
---
Ok, first of all, this game currently is not nearly as bad as it was when operation heath came out. Second, operation heath was a great success. So many fixes came out including fixes to the netcode, load times, finding matches and general fixes. During this time they fixed the voice chat and made it actually good. Before it was practically useless bc of how low the quality was and how low the player voices were.
---
You uh *cough* need to update the rank colours
---
No worries. I'm working 9-5 most M-F so I've just got evenings and weekend for the most part.  What's your uplay name? I can send you a friend request tomorrow
---
What?
---
XD my guy.
---
WE WANT THIS UBI
---
And again Ubi will be completely silent and act like their farts smell like roses.
---
i doubt we'll get any new map next year with only getting 2 this year it's because of data limits.
---
While I do believe this is a great idea, the quantities of rewards would need to be tweaked to deter boosting. But other than that and a few other things then I love it! It seems like it would encourage players to do their best I ranked too.
---
Explain?
---
She can probably stop a single push from a single person but any good op should be able to do that easily. That is why you should always be pushing with a buddy. Also, even if she does stop a push, chances are she wont kill you so you can always find a different entry point and try again. And almost every attacker either has frags or flash grenades which can be used to kill her. Shes not that good of an op
---
The data limits thing is a scam. Siege isn't even near 100gb on ps4, yet there's plenty of games well over 100.
---
Why the fuck would you give copper a reward?
---
I love democracy
---
Trash is maiming shield ops
---
I'm going to assume she got kicked after that
---
Why the fuck would you give the worst rank in the game a reward?
---
I already did then I checked reddit to see if someone else had this issue. Don't join a game because it won't load you in. I'll let you know if I fix it.
---
I like the idea
---
The sauid in kids room (house) is missing. Someone tweeted at Ubisoft and this was their reply
---
I’m fine with a controller, I’m just stating that fact that they have an advantage, why would I want to use mnk? You may as well get a pc if your going to use mnk
---
They fix this but don’t fix the game lol
---
I don’t think it’s based of ww2
---
yeah
---
If this idea were to actually happen the rewards for copper would probably be the diamond rewards.
---
glad you found your nitro button 😂
---
Yes just ignore the Tiger 1.
---
Then why won't they add new guns or change Alibi's holograms to match what she's wearing?
---
+1 nicely thought out
---
Use MnK in console is cheating. You can’t just plug it in.
---
Love it.

"bUt rAnK iS nOt A rEwArD"
---
Sincerely Ubisoft :p
---
Yeah no definitely, but I have just always felt they try their best and the game has way less groundbreaking glitches or flaws than destiny and apex and others
---
Ooh ok thanks for reminding me ;(
---
gesture warfare was great and r6 definitely needs an adaptation of it
---
Operation health was done right, just people expected improvements day 1
---
For the love of god take her barbed wire away
---
Yes you are REWARDED for your participation in the season what part of that is going over your head? A majority of casual players don't even bother to grind out 10 ranked matches. 
---
I agree the rewards are a little absurd but the post is about the idea of recieving rewards. The value of what to recieve is a totally separate argument.
---
the ping went down after a bit and the game played out smoothly through?

No

Last week, decided fuck it 1 game from plat let’s fucking get it. Big mistake. 3 plat ones, 2 copper 4’s while the second highest rank on my team was gold 2. Totally fair
---
What I'm saying is the skill level difference between high gold and plat 3 is very minimal where the gap between plat 2 and low plat 3 is actually a bit. Don't get me wrong there are some good players in plat 3 but golds shouldn't be as scared of them as they are.
---
Ace is killing the whole other team no matter the players.
---
but everyone has high ping in the match
---

Yea don’t forget to mention the over 10k ddosers on console

Hello xMexicanWalrusx, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cax4av/new_iq_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It's the Chibi Operator models on the breakfast table set up as a Cereal Box Oregon.
---
If you put it that way then where pretty well off
---
I think it was some glitch where it removed every attachment from your stuff
---
Lol what’s happening
---
I have no clue about the console community so I can’t help you there
---
cat daddy
---
YEEHAW
---
You can't
---
Yee
---
And I cannot stress this enough 
---
HAW
---
"i'm blowing this window mid air and come in destroying asses" lol
---
I would really want to know as well
---
ok.... you can easily see in the picture that the hull of the tank looks exactly like Panzerkampfwagen 6/VI hull and if you look even closer to the pic you can see the same turret as Panzer 6. Plus dont even mind the german flag cuz ubi cant use the ww2 flag what german used. And i've seen Panzerkampfwagen 6/VI in person in a tank museum in england. As you can see in these pictures they are nothing alike. Panzer I  [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/SdKfz101.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/SdKfz101.jpg) . And Panzer VI  [http://tank-photographs.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bovington-tiger-tank-131.jpg](http://tank-photographs.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bovington-tiger-tank-131.jpg)
---
I haven’t experienced a glitch like that so I can’t confirm or deny that
---
Which one?
---
On xbox and i think ps4 you can make accounts for free as long as you purchased the game once  instead of $20 per account.
---
Console pleb 😬😂
---
You've yeed your last haw, pardner...
---
Warden first please
---
Iirc I've seen a photo of someone selling a R18 crossover between Siege and Girls Frontline.
---
So yeah... Rule whatever-the-number-is
---
Nah you have yews your last haw, pardner
---
affirmative brodie
---
You don't read titles. This Warden's footage isn't his, but he gave a credit to OP.
---
I just wanted to chase the people... why did he leave??? Why dr Phil why?
---
Great concept
---
I have a team that would participate in this
---
Not really, dont really care much about the game
---
Seen tons of posts of people having MMR added because of cheaters. I've only had MMR removed because of cheaters twice haha
---
Then you should’ve been playing with them to begin with and you can’t complain that your copper 3 if you left a ranked game. Could’ve least stayed and tried to win lmao
---
As far as I’m aware it’s a bug. If I’m correct it stresses the server because they spam it about 50 times in under a minute
---
I don't live in Chicago. I just use Chicago servers
---
ride like I can’t no more
---
Lesion is always a good pick, and so are zofia and maestro like the other guy said
---
Baby shark doo doo doo doo
---
Nope
---
This is needed
---
I dont think that with overwatch, but its okey.
---
And yes, my new idea was based on matches, not win or lose, just play.
---
I no clue what you mean are you saying I'm bad or is it praise?
---
Like it or not those were the best days for siege for a lot of people including myself and my entire fucking friend group, console and pc. Everyone can agree that cracking open a window and mowing people down with jager acog was the best feeling.
---
I wasnt complaining about being in copper my guy, beating the toxic gold and beyond players is alot more fun in your rank is shit
---
Definitely lesion for defense
---
It's normal for high and mid plat to verse diamonds. You lose a little and gain alot, its balanced.
---
Isn’t*;
---
Still sounds edgy as it sounds a lot like Rule 1 of R6 Sub.
---
Search up "Battlefield 5 finger gun Easter Egg" and you'll find something just like this 
---
I'd love to see this in Siege too!
---
I’m calling you good them bad
---
A map...?
---
ok i lied there's bets
---
Skyscraper
---
The wifi went “🗑”
---
Well I guess I’m a toxic gold player then LMAO
---
Got ddosed 3 times today and I got fortress outback and Hereford only too wonderful game
---
Well he doesn’t cheat but if he was ddosing his way to diamond or to that elo, he would’ve got the attention of the community. I’m not sure if u know GWild but this kid ddosed his way to around 12,000k elo and every body reported him until he got banned. Now I’m not 100% sure if the same thing is going on with this person, but if he is actually ddosing then he will get banned because will people eventually start complaining.
---
Only month 1 thats it. More of a prize than bet
---
I mean... you are an ash main 
---
I kinda saw it coming homie
---
Oh thanks twitches aim did only hit me once or twice
---
Hey uh check this reddit would actually answer your question because of people who ask plus those smart enough to do research before hand
---
5 pictures taken moments before the disaster
---
To be fair, with the Vector it takes about a half second to be out of ammo in the mag anyway
---
The other 10000 posts says otherwise
---
Is there going to be a second siege tho? I’m pretty sure I heard somewhere where ubi said they want atleast 100 ops or a certain amount that a while, I feel like it’d be better to update this game instead of making a new one
---
Yeah it is. If you're plat you should be able to beat or at least verse diamonds
---
People normally call me trash so I thought you were doing the same
---
ah
---
That wasTales From The Borderlands, mate
---
Yea they're not planning to make another seige, but like you said they want to make 100 operators.
---
That recoil control is insane!
---
Why would you leave a game, deliberately, and then post it on reddit. This has to be the dumbest thing I've seen posted on this sub. Delete your post, nobody likes people who leave games
---
If so, that'd be amazing.
---
A multiplayer cowboy shooter with decent shooting sounds so good.
---
cowboy weapons as in all new weapons?
---
also what pps are you limited to
---
well i can say that i never have problems with that 
---
its harder for me with every other weapon
---
its weird
---
I mean it sorta worked. It is pretty fun.
---
How long is it on for? I havnt played it yet
---
It worked for a week though...
---
Hey bro, currently gold 4... Solo queue is doing my head in. Finised plat 3 last season.. Usually around gold 1 plat 3 but only really play solo queue. Fancy a game gimme a shout.
---
Literally have played 31 ranked games. I have attacked first every time. I’m not exaggerating
---
They said that during year one or two, but that was before Siege started introducing a lot of unfavorable ops, not counting Blackbeard.
---
They know its a issue. 
---
They even released an chat update to weaken/stop the orginal glitch for the issue. 
---
They just didnt know the scope of the issue and the fact that any symbol can affect the game and not only the original  .,.,.,.,.,.,. bug.
---
Hi fuck off this probably took it least a week to make and if y can't make anything better yourself then don't comment shit like this because this is one of the best things I have seen
---
It’s funny because it is probably lacking evidence that a gamertag can mean anything, but that marker is actually a strong one, imo.
---
Yeah, I kinda get the feeling that they want to go the CS route where all the balancing is done on the first game, then just let it keep going with bugfixes until they stuff the engine to it's limits, then *maybe* release some slightly upgraded version a year later.
---
Was in on the spectator mode or on your pov while playing it personally? Cause the spector mode has a bug where everything goes old school black and white for a few mins.
---
A release schedule isn't just a schedule for us, it is a deadline. A corporate deadline to complete a project. Every release ends a project and maintenance starts on old ones and finalisation starts on future ones.
---
3 months is their deadline, and if you don't have a deadline, you'll never release them on time.
---
I call dibs to repost this tomorrow
---
Toxic as fuuhhh. Better off uninstalling lmao 🤷‍♂️
---
"You're mine, palhaço!"
---
*Caveira proceeds to hit the operator with a pool noodle*
---
Not sure, maybe contact ubi support? The game is held together with binairy tape so it could just be that it doesnt support that
---
Trash is complaining about game mechanics that  are perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
i think i see sledge
---
This guy said his friends was in G! but got demoted to silver thats why it seemed to far fetched but I dont know
---
System like this would be terrible.
---
Currently we only have shitty charms and people are already abusing system like crazy. (Exploiters, copper smurfs, cheaters, ...). By uprading rewards this behavior would be promoted even more.
---
That being said. Ranked system should not be competition. The most important goal of ranked system is crating fair and balanced matches. So everyone should be playing in its own skill rank in order to achieve that. If you put high rewards for ranked, you promote unhealthy behavior for people to try to be way above their skill level by any means.
---
If you want more rewards in ranked, it should be based on amount of games played, because that is what is achieving the goal of ranked. The more people play, the more accurate system is, the more balanced games can be created. And if in the end rank is just some number, and everyone is rewarded in similar way, people dont need to abuse the system to get boosted and so on (some will still do that ofc to boost their ego, but majority wont.)
---
Not a 1 tap but okey
---
God has abandoned us
---
No he doesn't, read it again gold 1 to gold 4
---
At the location but can't find it. Is it already planted?
---
Was this screenshot taken yesterday?
---
No I done this in a ranked. In gold match none the less. They lost because of that started tk they had 3-0 before lost one round all got super angry at each other.
---
Today
---
Oh ok, never mind
---
No. People will just get even more toxic and tryhard if theres more "reward" for getting a higher rank. MMR schould be a mean of giving you equally skilled opponents, nothing more.
---
You should've chosen alibi for the upvote...
---
so easy since the new update, without the useless thunt missions... :D
---
Depends on your cpu, but the lower the better I would say if you just want fps and dont care about quality
---
This is epic
---
Oh I didn't know I'm not in this sub
---
I like to stick around clash players that leave the objective. They could always use a helping bullet!
---
You know exactly what number it is.
---
I have a i7 7700
---
I had that aswell once, 2 guys names where n***aDachs and a small variation of it and both of them where hacking. one if them got banned the next day though, other one idk.
---
If you want realism without toxic shot go play arma 3 I don't deal with shit from others and they tend to be helpful actually.
---
I would go with medium, test it in t hunt, and lower individual settings until you get what you want. That's how I would do it
---
Bruh
---
Would be really nice
---
Ok thanks
---
That seems more realistic. I also agree it's a bit of a paradox, siege might be dead today if they weren't introducing new ops constantly. I'm not entirely sure having more time would ensure better operators. I mean, Glaz is a vanilla operator and he got a thermal scope out of nowhere like 2 years after release that turned him into a god until his rifle got nerfed.
---
This 5% number is a huge understatement and angers me, as one person playing with a friend that’s clearly less skilled than me, as well as a person who knows that the lower you go, the less chances there are of getting out of bronze and below as a solo player. You cannot fix boosting because that’s broken player mentality, not broken game mechanic.
---
Finally, your “couldn’t care less about others” mentality is the same as these boosters have.
---
Oh yeah him too.
---
I like it, would definitely buy! (If the price is reasonable)
---
it's not as fair as possible lol ... wtf is a diamond doing in a plat 3 lobby ? why are gold 2 able to Q with a diamond and plat 3 ????
---
Denny Devito
---
*To be continued*
---
Ranked in siege is a fucking mess. I love the game, I’ve got north of 3000 hours in it, but ranked needs tidying up so badly.
---
Cheaters, throwers, AFK-ers, they’re way too prominent and the ban penalty, if it even gets dished, is far too lenient imo
---
I just started playing in newcomer mode, and people shoot drones with shotguns and misses them and then accidently kills teammates.
---
Dude I cant get a pack with 52% chance
---
Would probably get hit with a cease abd desist or worse a straight up lawsuit.
---
Oh my god, why are you such a complainer? I bet in game you do nothing but complain. That's why you lost, bad attitude dude. I bet you wouldn't complain if it was a team of bronze and coppers.
---
I imagine you flicked in her head Tbh nut that would be scarier if you had walked for a bit then turned around to see her sprintimg at you.
---
Look the other things you listed are so much different, go play Rocket League or any other ranked game for that matter, when you're Plat you come up against Diamonds, when you're Diamond you come up against Champs. You literally have one diamond against you, you should be aiming to learn from playing against him to take you there, not complaining at the fact he's there. If you were in a team of Golds I would understand your point, but you're not.
---
I'm by no means saying the matchmaking system is great, but I am saying this lobby specifically is fuck all to complain about...
---
I started playing ranked last week for the first time and every time i vote jackal there's always someone that asks why and i'm like  B R U H
---
This is an accurate description of r6siege right now
---
It’s a fucking mess and it needs sorting so badly
---
Because it's way to powerful, you need no aim or game sense to use it, just run around and spam the trigger until you get a kill, basically how it works.
---
I'll wait for this
---
Fair point, would obviously contact Ubi first to get the all clear, they are community assets so don't see the problem too much, would you still be up for them if ubi gave the thumbs up?
---
Yea smurfs are better than their gold friend they got to diamond
---
Yeah it was more like a calculated spray
---
No, that is not how it works lol
---
Not me personally but yea you still should cover your butt. Especially with a videogame company.
---
"Calculated" but i was cav and snuck around behind the enemy team the entire game it was amazing. At least until they went for the plant lol
---
Their chat filter doesn't even work. There are so many ways to bypass their filter to say slurs and whatnot.
---
I get that you don't want it nerfed lad, because you are that one guy in the lobby who mains Ela on every site and autolocks her straight away, then sits in a dark corner with the shotgun in your hands waiting for a poor Ash to run past you. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Just nerf it and it won't be an issue and gun skill will actually be a thing.
---
He was gonna retire at 53. But Rainbow Team invited him. And he aint going on operation frequently because he has his grandson to watch(...)
---
If you nut on it, Maestro comes out to take it back and clean it. Problem solved
---
well, you have defenders advantage. I hope you used echo
---
Yeah the battlefield easter egg is really fun, i’d like this addition in r6 also
---
“I know a 6inch blade woont lose connection”
---
Words of a Yorkshire man with experience at a modern bar fight.
---
Yeah chimera was weird too
---
Play with friends or a find some people on teamspeak,discord etc.
---
Every multiplayer game has the same issue, there is a high chance at least one of the "randoms" will be toxic. Real life as it is.
---
Yeah true but still
---
Nice
---
Hahaha true
---
Here we see a Copper in his natural environment. He loves being watched by Default Cameras. During the Mating season, he tries to show the hostage his masculinity by hotbreaching into windows.
---
She yote that C4 right at you, unlucky bro
---
That's too much. Make it 1/3 the amount and it would be perfect!
---
What happened to grim sky? And congrats! I started in late wind bastion and finally got gold 3. Keep up the good work and aim for diamond
---
I think its too broken to much renown smaller rewards and ubi might think about it lol
---
3 seasons and youll already have everything you wanted so there would be no reason for you to still play ubi is exploiting that
---
Meh, ubi told me to see if it's updated (and it is) run it as administrator (and it does) do stuff with firewall that idk how to deal with.
---
After that i told them twice that it was still happening but stopped replying
---
That's normal? The gap between the window and frost mat is big enough
---
As you can observe...
---
Man you’re out here scaming people for a design that would take less than 5 seconds to do in gimp or photoshop, sad.
---
Yeah and I'm pretty sure that it's illegal so ddosing will bite them in the ass eventually
---
Lol nope
---
Ye
---
Probably swapped accounts with a diamond friend.
---
Yeswe need kb&amp;m users to jump from 70 to 95%on console higher ranks
---
How would they know if a player is just naturally good and/or luck. Just let matchmaking be based on the highest ranked player then it'll be fine.
---
Nope ranked in this game is broken as fuck I’ve run into this too many times this season
---
Well let's be honest here, those 2 boosted diamonds probably aren't diamonds to begin with so they **probably** play the same as you OP
---
Not even a scam if ubi won't let me do it, the custom typography takes time, yes £5 per poster may be a stretch but that is probably more than I would charge...
---
AHHHHH NOT THE SINK
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
I am prettty sure the copper is a smurf account because going up from copper to diamond is a 3000 elo gap
---
First of all, you're comparing your console experience to my PC experience and I can for sure tell you that the two are completely different, console is MUCH easier than PC. So don't jump around saying how you know anything at all. Why are you even bringing up KD? It makes absolutely no sense, this isn't CoD.
---
Second, pure statistics show that shotguns are much worse than any automatic weapon- this isn't mine or anyone's opinion, this is a fact. Just because Ela's shotgun can be a viable choice compared to her other weapon choices doesn't mean it should be nerfed- in fact, it means that all other shotguns should be buffed to be competitively viable.
---
Third, even if I was basing my arguments on the words of content creators and professional players, it would mean that what I say is much more true than 'nerf ela hurr durr'. I'm still waiting for you to give me one reason that this shotgun should be nerfed apart from 'but I'm better than you so your word must be invalid'.
---
I always want to get these but I hate paying as much as the game itself for them
---
Smh, all these posts saying 1000 IQ plays and they're not even playing IQ.
---
I wanna see 1000 IQ's!
---
What does it want now?
---
Do fuze with a hostage
---
That's not true, I've seen a diamond with 4 coppers playing against my low/high gold team.
---
Source: my own experiences
---
Lol, you got urself a upvote on this one
---
And its not my pc, its ubi's side
---
He's probably a higher level player who threw loads of games on a smurf to help boost his friends to diamond.
---
Why isn't he in yours?
---
They have slowed down on adding new guns because the game now has close to 90 different guns overall and getting licencing for new ones to use in game is getting more and more expensive.
---
They have stated that as such they won't flat out cut new guns from happening but they will definitely consider reusing existing ones, and when they do they said they will likely add new attachment options to them, like we saw with the M249, FMG-9 and the D-50.
---
Alibi's gadget isn't a player model therefore it would require making a separate entity that is a mix of player model and gadget that can access the wardrobe, it's probably possible but resource intensive and as it stands Alibi is still very effective without it.
---
Warden's guns may have not required any particular attention in terms of stats, but they got custom reload animations for Warden specifically, so it wasn't just copy pasted over.
---
Staff itself has confirmed that no one got drafted away to other major projects en masse, however throwing more devs at a problem won't fix it faster (1 programmer does it in 10 days so 10 programmers do it in 1 fallacy).
---
And in regards to "no new skins for guns", all the guns of this season, reused as they may be, got new skins based on the operators, including the new "Confidential" bundle, therefore that point falls to the floor.
---
The frame she first appeared on my screen to her being dead is in the same second, unavoidable at that point.
---
I’m not thinking about ranked anytime soon but that is something to consider. How is maverick?
---
I've kinda stopped playing, I might come back when the issue is fixed.
---
True tuat... true that
---
The map feels so backwards, attackers are at a disadvantage when they are outside because of all the runouts and defenders are at a disadvantage inside the building because of all the angles they can be taken out from, if any map needs to be removed from ranked it's skyscraper
---
Wait, just wait. Keep playing Casual until you’re familiar with EVERY map, you’re comfortable with playing any operator, recoil patterns, peeks, etc. I went into ranked as soon as I was up to level and regret it because it affects my elo to this day.
---
And I have seen finka been played and looks pretty cool so I’ll consider her too but I do want to have a decent amount of the new operators before I even queue for rank
---
Probably whoever made it has a complex about something.....
---
Finally someone understands what rank systems should be about. This whole copper to diamond thing that exists in most competitive pc games is whats giving people a bad understanding of what ranks are about, that its from some reason a competition
---
Well then you'd get event packs easier than alpha packs. These are meant to be lucrative to cover expenses to justify making events in the first place.
---
This is just a visual bug, she can’t actually shoot through the shield anymore. I assume she tried to do the glitch and failed, hence why she’s holding barbed wire. Same goes for that floating IQ, if you fail the glitch you’ll be stuck in a crouched position and you won’t have any movement animation. The downside to this is that you won’t know when she actually has her shield down, so you have to keep shooting her.
---
just the funny in general
---
The suit should be orange though
---
Theres goes class again ffs
---
Would be amazing but I doubt it.
---
Console or pc?
---
No one cares about you bye ... but you’re blaming siege when it’s your own shit
---
I see, hammer time, days, operator, r6 and int? And David? Edit:spelling
---
Pc
---
What’s 3 and 4?
---
This could be a poor DDoS attempt by someone in the game.
---
Want to add me ? I can show you the ropes
---
Maverick is pretty good but he is used more like thatcher to take out bandits and mutes than to actually breach through. He is very useful on some maps such as club House but you can't really go wrong with him but at the same time there's other operators that might be worth picking over him depending on the map and what your opponents are doing.
---
[deleted]
---
I thought high mmr players couldn't play with low mmr players as teammates
---
Don't worry about him he doesn't like other people having fun.
---
Actually verbally laughed at this. Nice
---
Bots won't let me. Just have Yung Jamie pull it up.
---
I am a dev but I know that developers can’t ban people. There is a separate division for battle-eye so I can put in a word but you can’t expect anything to happen.
---
A rapper raps about comitting crime and gets shit when it turns out they're not lying lmao
---
Well, we can up the amount of required shotgun shells...this is just a suggestion
---
Yeah game gets better with more ops 100%. Shame you aren't on pc could get the ultimate edition with all operators for £40 from £100.
---
Logan Paul in the japay Forrest 2018 colorized*
---
Those are way too much
---
Id be a whole lot less upset if it happened only once a day. More like every few matches up at high plat. And dont get me started about Mouse and Key.
---
I’m down been looking to play with someone. I do know the basics I’m not a complete bot. I can drop 4-5 kills on average per game. SckOnMaNut is my user. I have no clue how ubi friends list shit works so if u can add me that would be great lmao
---
Ohhhhh roasted
---
How about they give us alpha packs for each level up? Leveling up is just meaningless
---
Absolute ballers, that's who

I am on pc but I got the game when it was on steam sale. And got the deluxe edition for 11 bucks. I like not having the operators unlocked cuz it gives me something to grind for and look forward to

Impose harsher bans for leaving ranked is the answer but noone on this sub wants that.
---
this is just a normal match for me
---
No it is supposed to get destroyed other times it has and it's very inconsistent and glitchy.
---
It's just na East you'll have like 30 ping I assume which is fine
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon

Like I said, once stuff starts breaking. I just nuke my OS and start from scratch so everything installs properly and all the fuckery i've done beforehand gets removed.
---
Ah ok. Cool
---
My point. If you KNOW there is no enemy then fine. Otherwise bad idea to be in an unknown situation
---
Happened to me as well. 
---
Every time they release new content we don’t need they somehow manage to create more problems.
---
Oh I just whizzed through and saw ps4. Yeah that is one way of looking at it I guess but I've seen reddit posts where people have unlocked all the operators with in game currency and they are lil level 200+ so it's a grind just a heads up.
---

Okay now that's stupid. Casual is just the ranked alternative when you don't want your MMR on the line. Whether you play brain dead or actually want to practise for ranked is up to you. Just because you think you don't need to drone and play properly doesn't mean everyone needs to drop down to your level
---
Hell they don't even rock good. Ya want good rock look for Jay-Z when he went on tour with Linkin Park.
---
Shield operator when?! Oh wait.
---
I have hit plat twice (once back in chimera and then now I'm plat II). These were literally the only two seasons I've ever solo q'ed. I guess my friends are all trash :D

Well it happened

Or consider playing IQ or Thatcher. Think about it. Play one of them and now you can ban someone else.

I'm going to have to disagree with you there. Othereise the mode wouldn't be called Casual.

And everyone else has known this for a out 6 months

Cardi B on top of the Paul brothers...

Your boys ain't male?

If you think that you'll have more time during university to enjoy life... I got some bad news for you. Juggling chores, job/s, learning, trying to get some business-connections and maybe just maybe finding a couple hours sleep is not much of an improvment. At least in my experience. I wish I had as much time to enjoy life as I had in school.
---
Dude nobody ever fucking said that. Stop trying to be a contrarian when you aren’t on the contrary of popular opinion.
---
Ubi Really didn't put enough effort into ranked.
---
Best bundle for Jager, I prefer this over the Elite one. Good work!
---
To be honest, I’m just happy that you’re playing thermite because I think that he is kind of underrated, I love his gun and the fact that he is a hard breather just improves on everything in my opinion.
---
 But wouldn’t the round be instantly over cause no one can save IQ from the trap so that it wouldn’t come down to who can bleed out slower.
---
Pretty sure I read patch notes saying Kapkan traps no longer get destroyed by breach charge.  It was a while ago.
---
Entirely subjective...
---
Next years april fools event maybe?
---
It’s a custom game, personally I wouldn’t be serious because custom and casual is for goofing around 
---
While ranked is for being serious
---
1) Smart business decision-cheaper game means more people playing, and ops can be unlocked through the in-game currency (renown) so they're essentially free, and it was better policy than the very questionable "starter edition."
---
2) Everyone gets one free one, and can earn at least one more by playing the game, and you don't have to spend any money if you don't want to.
---
3) Ubi isn't DDOSing you, and they can't actually do anything about it.  They don't own the servers. 
---
4) It actually works pretty well, all things considered. 
---
5) The hitboxes are actually very, very good.  Do I complain when I shoot someone's backpack and don't get a hit?  Sure.  But realistically, I shouldn't get a hit for shooting someone's backpack, and I know it.
---
6) They haven't released a truly broken op in a while, and removing glitched operators is a step in the right direction.  I'd much rather have an op removed than have to deal with a whole season of invincible Clash.
---
I can't warrant banning him. I played as him yesterday and had the exact scenerio for his gadget home up. I could still barely see through the smoke with his gadget active.
---
Played at launch through black ice a lot. Took a break, came back at health, took another break, and actually starting taking the game seriously once Chimera started.
---
Honestly I say resolve it like League of Legends does. If you're queueing for ranked you can't queue up if you're two divisions or more above anyone in your party. Maybe tweak it so that its only a one division difference so Diamonds with Plats, Plats with Golds, golds with Silvers, Silvers with Bronzes, Bronzes with Coppers.
---
Because then Ubi can't make money selling the full set of packs to idiots. Duhh!!
---
Literally nobody : 
---
OP : 
---
&gt;The glitch where you can't spot the bomb with you drone continues... It can be incredibly frustrating, right? Well, there is a solution. If you're on your drone and you can clearly see the bomb but the game is not registering it, just press Q or E to spectate someone else's drone, then quickly switch back to yours. Voila, instant fix. (I didn't find this fix, I just wanted to spread the tip for new players)
---
Everyone has known this forever . For as long as the bug has existed

Camo and design: Sledge

Elite animation: thermite

It might be

When you install r6 on pc it asks you what languages you want for the dialogues and this can't be changed unless you reinstall the game, so you could try reinstalling but I'm not sure if it will work
---
Downvote because I can literally see your console in the phone recording. Why not record on console for better quality 🤔
---
Same with echo, mozzie and maestro. This is a great idea.
---
Lmao

he won't learn more than casual in Copper/bronze ranked...
---
Hahahh so original
---
Give the ability to turn off allies pinging.
---
Yeah, so I posted this hoping to help NEW players, who might not know this trick
---
Agreed 👍
---
Sledge imo.
---
Also still the best gadget rework in ages
---
People who're on this sub aren't new players trust me .
---
&gt;Dostovesky
---
An attempt was made.
---
Just play on a smurf account or play casual, if your friend is a copper he needs to learn the game instead of you playing ranked with him for easier games
---
This makes me want to read all the Witcher books in Polish. Too bad I can't understand a single word... Saga o wiedźminie jest najlepsze? I give up.
---
Sledge

who cares
---
This is actually an image of the physical manifestation of this sub.

I like this post though OP, you ... you're alright.
---
you can tell reddit is ran by the white male majority

UK police will do nothing.

Zofia withstanding would be her going NuhUh! You didn't hit me!

Yeah thats the funniest part it’s always the copper carrying the diamond who goes 2-5 or something like that

Real talk that song is way too fucking hard on Guitar Hero.

Somehow I didn't even realise BB was there at first :D

Still offensive. But only to suction cup dildos. Which are big old dicks anyways, so no one really cares.

She's a woman and the white/nerd part of Reddit hates them.

Hitler murdered millions of people X made music. Wonderful comparison lmao
---
That’s some fucked up liveleaks shit right there. 
---
R.I.P
---
Depends on gun that  you use
---
The comparison in making is you said “don’t talk trash about a dead guy” 
---
X is dead, so is Hitler. Therefore saying I shouldn’t trash talk Hitler.
---
Thats a feature on purpose
---
So English is not your first language? And your also trying to speak down to me in a language you don’t understand?

Hello reconnect_mb, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cb1maf/quality_of_life_feature/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

It was drugging and robbery, there was no rape. There's a subsect of reddit that would love people to think she was Cosbying men, so you have to sadly spell out the distinction.

Wait. IT TAKES 4 HOURS.

I can hear this gif

Firstly context matters, secondly i don't like him beating his wife, i meant beating up a guy.

If you break a window and plan to peek with anything but the pistol you aint playing the Germans right

Best 25 second clip I’ve seen on this Reddit
---
I almost had a Tachanka ace on Tower the other day.  I set up outside media in the hallway, opposite the elevator. Four people all dropped and got mowed down, one after the other as they tried to peek their way out.  Last was inside the elevator about inching a peek when my teammate nitro celled him. 
---
I was so sad.
---
Ok leafyishere
---
With it gone how is he supposed to inflate the life best on his neck, they only got rid of it due to a home screen.
---
Do you know what else could be a great quality of life improvement? To be able to loop through your weapons and secondary gadget on the character selection screen. But I doubt if this get noticed. 😕
---
I obviously would know, but I doubt operator balance changes are a huge workload and from afar seems to be changing some figures etc. 
---
Plus these should be constantly tested and ideas should be put into practice internally so when there is a test server patch like this (which is fairly big), they should be testing as much as possible. 
---
There are still plenty of ops that could do with some changes, such as Echo, maestro, maverick, nomad, Mira, Tachanka, Monty etc. 
---
I don’t see any excuse for not having both bug fixes and operator balance in one patch just like this
---
It doesn’t matter if someone wants to find it they will
---
Seriously, this is a meme, which is explicitly against the rules.
---
T-hunt bots look different

Nice KWA mp7. I have the same one.

I came here to *argument*, ever heard of it?

Ah, guess I've been misinformed on that one then! I'll fix that.

That shit is child's play compared to what some [mad lads attempt nowadays](https://youtu.be/u0jHCiY86f0?t=545).

So I guess me saying cardi b isn’t trash is gonna get me downvoted
---
If this gets added i'll never stop rappelling.
---
I usually watch live streams from zig.liquid and sometimes the guy has 0/0/0 still wons because he does all the drone stuff and call outs. K/d means nothing but how good you play with your team.

Well done

Nice one guy

Thanks for the clarification. Does make sense and it’s nice to hear operator balance changes are in the works and will be tested soon. Thanks
---
Aw yeah, good ol’ brown man.
---
Depends, If you say about her music, it's ok, if you say about her as a person it's not ok
---
Thermal sight only works when stationary now, and takes a good second to recharge after moving. This includes just turning 90+ degrees.  
---
In my opinion this makes Glaz near useless as any good player knows not to peek if there's a Glaz around, and before when Glaz could push slowly competently, he now can not, in fact I'd say he's the worst attacker now.  
---
A start would be to make him able to walk (With Alt.) and keep the thermal and see how that plays out.  
---
There's literally no point in playing him any more except for emotional attachment. Sure, you'll still pick up a few kills from bad players peeking or catching some off-guard but he just doesn't feel useful to the team anymore when there's so many other choices.
---
Admit your being a dick just to be a dick and I’ll teach you how

I think you mean Klapcan

Then that's a valid reason to votekick them, but I'm fairly certain that the likelihood of getting 2 random trolls in a row in the same match is lower than the likelihood of a 4-stack abusing the feature.

Why not enforce a double ban, one pernament for the account the other temporary for the hardware.
---
In other words, a cheater gets banned, his account is perma'd.
---
His hardware id is now temporarily banned for say 3-6 months.

Is another kick in the gut to the cheaters, doesn't impact second hand buyers that much.

Haha sounds like I'm right. Well good it seems like you probably deserve it.

Want me to apologize?

Chris browns music is still good tho.
---
Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F. as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robyn F. picked up Brown's cellular phone and observed a three-page text message from a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.
---
A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.
---
Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle.
---
Brown looked at Robyn F. and stated, 'I'm going to beat the sh-- out of you when we get home! You wait and see!'
---
The detective said "Robyn F." then used her cell phone to call her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales, who did not answer.
---
Robyn F. pretended to talk to her and stated, 'I'm on my way home. Make sure the police are there when I get there.'
---
After Robyn F. faked the call, Brown looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I'm really going to kill you!'
---
Brown resumed punching Robyn F. and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist, placing her elbows and face near her lap in [an] attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied upon her by Brown.
---
Brown continued to punch Robyn F. on her left arm and hand, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps (sic) that was approximately two inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand.
---
Robyn F. then attempted to send a text message to her other personal assistant, Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window onto an unknown street.
---
Brown continued driving and Robyn F. observed his cellular telephone sitting in his lap. She picked up the cellular telephone with her left hand and before she could make a call he placed her in a head lock with his right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.
---
Brown pulled Robyn F. close to him and bit her on her left ear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of 333 North June Street and Robyn F. turned off the car, removed the key from the ignition and sat on it.
---
Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. He then placed her in a head lock positioning the front of her throat between his bicep and forearm. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F.'s left and right carotid arteries, causing her to be unable to breathe and she began to lose consciousness.
---
She reached up with her left hand and began attempting to gouge his eyes in an attempt to free herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and then released her. While Brown continued to punch her, she turned around and placed her back against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest, placed her feet against Brown's body and began pushing him away. Brown continued to punch her on the legs and feet, causing several contusions.
---
Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.

No mention of fixing the tap spring to run silently bug.

Wtf i literally never saw anyone playing him back before he was nerfed so what made them decide he was so powerful?
---
Average toxic console player iq lol.
---
OR or... she’s just shit.
---
Yeah agreed
---
I thought they buffed them by making the hit box smaller but left the health alone? They were like too easy to shoot when vaulting a window so they made it smaller to make it a bit harder to hit therefore making it riskier to jump through windows with a mat under it
---
Take a quick glance at my profile
---
Ah, the good old days when Ela had 51 bullets, 4 grzmot mines and 0 recoil.... ;(
---
How about the drone still being able to see the barricaded objective from the air vent in the bottom bank vault?
---
It’s a little ironic how someone literally named nirvana paper cuts is saying shit like this and talking shit about a genre he doesn’t like. It’s really better off to respect other ppls taste in music. Besides, how would you like it if someone was making fun of Kurt Cobain as much as you have been making fun of x. I’m sure it wouldn’t make you happy. So why can’t we just calm down and all respect other ppls taste in music. Besides cardi b ofc cardi b raped men and got away with it, on the contrary x got accused of hitting his gf but then later charges were dropped as the gf said it was fake
---
Nice fucking shot mate. But I am sure they reported you while raging away xD
---
I'm working out of town, no access to play for a while, the video was a suggested on FB, just haven't been able to find any other videos similar. Just seeing who might know, or be willing to test it
---
Well, you can't say the same thing about x, cuz he dead
---
Old one I believe was 3 mins.

LMAO fuck no. Rather have Cardi B than the dead wife beater.

it is a ring lol
---
Nøkk over here with a fishing net over her head

I would be 100 percent okay with someone making fun of Cobain. I do it all the time and he was a selfish prick anyway.

Mine used to be FatSweatyCock and nothing happened

why is an admin here btw lol

Literally has nothing to do with his music tho

lmfao it’s funny asf tho

This would be an absolutely disgusting spot for Vigil mains (or anyone feeling cheeky enough to peek into the lobby there)

Holy shit bro I was in your game

Better clip of you would of muted yourself

with all due respect, we need ACOG charm on Jager and Bandit' birthday

Holy fucking shit, this gets upvoted? DAE MODERN MUSIC SUCKS?!

This "friends" bullshit is always brought up with both boosting and ping abusing. 
---
No, fuck that bullshit! Normal people shouldn't suffer due to 95% abusing shit and 5% just playing with friends. 
---
If you want to play Ranked with friends, play it with friends who have similar Ranks, if not possible, then it sucks, we shouldn't suffer because of that.

I just alt tab real quick and it fixes it

Ah yes, acting like we haven't told them million times in the past 4 YEARS(!!!!!) since release.

You know that was a while ago right and he changed since then? He literally was changing for the better and did a charity event thing right before he died.

Hmmmmm I dont get your joke
---
It does when people won't play with you because your kd is bad. I mean teamkills would really only matter at the start of a season in this case but still.
---
Hi. I have a right to think things are bad. I don't mind anything here except the choice of song. Sure, it's funny with the weeb joke once in a while, but using it for this? Fuck that. Any other song I would've been happy with, but no, these two decided to waste these potentially great videos.
---
Sieht echt gut aus
---
The mechanics of this game are not *that* complex and they are already starting to repeat abilities somewhat. There might be another hard breacher but it would be very difficult to meaningfully distinguish them from the three we have.
---
so is this post
---
To be honest... Clash is banned all the Time on ranked games

Also a good point, they are handling this in such a roundabout way.

Haha, soooo OP 😂

Hey how about before we go and make rapelling above windows even easier we need upside down rappel, seriously that camera needs to come a little closer to mid head
---
There is no way Ubi would do this. Optional microtrasactions and basically the only way they are making money from this game now.
---
Well to be fair, they probably threw it and spammed to detonate to get the earliest explosion.  And sometimes it looks so intentional, but really you're just not paying enough attention.  It probably didn't go as far as they wanted.  I know I've done this.

Fits the bill for Belle Delphine though

Maybe it was a one time thing but has anyone else seen Mira able to carry her window and shoot? The other day I played someone who was holding the window in garage while strafing back and forth shooting me. It was being used as a shield. I wish I would've screen shot it.

I have seen zero games in the history of competitive cooperative gaming that has ever completely stopped or even made a dent into the booster system.

Booster plays on a 2nd account the same rank as the person they are boosting.

Tell me if you think you are some god like human a way to combat this method of boosting without affecting the average player base?

-Yes
---
I personally have not seen it but I a guy mentioned it on r/SiegeAcademy today. Basically (according to that guy) Clash has a shield on her back and also one in front of her which is invisible and can slow/damage people while holding barbed wire.

Well they arent bots, they play like bots. Thats a difference.

Why do you care about it any more than any other of the numerous I finitely worse crimes going on?

How about you note the return of the IQ glitch?

reeeeeeeeeeeeeee

only the current season pass has the perks

Yup, the way I see it, it all comes down to preference. I use holo on a ton guns on attack. The one thing I will say though is, the easier a gun is to use (R4-C) the better the Acog is IMO.

Also I looked it up and it sound like they don’t take unsolicited ideas.

Of course there is a guy on Twitter called @aWildWatermelon and he is says he’s Ubi’s com rep. If you really want to spread this this idea then I changed my mind and I’m giving you permission. But please tell them u/Timmytriangles did it.
---
Botting is when you play like a bad ai. You walk around instead of running, you take forever to aim at your target, and your aim is awful.
---
It's basically saying "You're bad at this game". It's really to incite salt.
---
Who ever even mentioned you?

If you don't, I'm not talking about you.

Idk, typically referring to someone directly as 'you' means they're mentioning you. You responded directly to my comment, saying, 'Why do you care'.

Must be a problem on Ubi’s end then

A death is a death and a (enemy) kill is a kill so...

It’s a whole new game, and I’m not a huge fan of pve

Unluckily I can't help you, but look up for a team mate, one with you means no kick.
---
"That's American ass."
---
You can already get two free OP by just playing between the seasons. And most skins are also purchasable with renown. This is just a bonus renown, on top of the other renown earned, of 2 free ops or 2 free top tier seasonal skins. 
---
So yes such a bug boost to renown would be a terrible idea.

Hobby lobby won't know what hit em

but not always you can find a team mate

Alright sorry it’s hard on mobile

Your hacking

Exactly. Who cares about your kd. If you play well or bad in a match, that’s what people will care about.

Stop, I can only get so erect

When he first started firing, Jäger was briefly in view at the corner of the ACOG. Second game, the game just broke.

It’s is when your using a phone form 6yo and you thumbs are fucking huge

An I the only one that wants to be able to cut the ropes on defense if you see the rope in the window? I’ve wanted that since release
---
I think it’s just the danish flag made out of the approved camo-ish colors for her uniform
---
Why pistol? Just curious.
---
You can mute people if they're toxic but everyone should have to use mics in ranked cause if 1 team uses them and the other has 1 person giving calls then ofc there is a huge advantage to the 1st team
---
Well if they have to pay then shouldn't they be putting our money to use? I don't buy a season pass for them to skimp out.

Honestly you're right on point with this comment. Controllers are so gddamn difficult to aim on, like. How can you be precise in an adequate enough time by using joysticks? I'll never know :)

Well I play without points now because they’re distracting and I could care less if I get an assist or not as long as we win, but I swear I would get an assist even when a doc would heal him back to full
---
Please
---
As long as it's not spelled with a 1 you're good.
---
Yeah I don't know joke
---
"I go invisible now"
---
I know that I've had situations where I hit someone (damage is showing in the killshot (Or whatever you call that killcam screenshot) , blood spurts and I see that I've hit them in the killcam. Plus other indicators that I've hit them... But then, later in the round when they get killed, I didn't get the assist. And that's definitely true.
---
Is that a bug then?
---
A constant problem, especially noticable on lower refresh rates. It probably is impossible to find a all fits solution, but this should be solved. Please Ubi, my K/D.
---
But.... but.... but.. isn't Finka essentially Doc for atk?
---
Fookin Laysah Soights

Isnt this game full of hackers or something?
---
 No point in reworking her if she’s gonna get banned every ranked game lulw.
---
I'm right there with ya on that train of thought hahah
---
Maybe it's a bug or something but it definitely happens. I don't know if it happened to me in the most recent patch or even season yet but I think it did... I'll keep an eye open and I'll post video evidence when it happens again. Shall I reply to this comment when that day comes so you can see for yourself?
---
The best dude right here yall.

Please stop trying to show me ass, I actually feel like just looking at the cosplay other then just looking at a female butt, so please don’t do that.

Well, MZN just released a video on how to do the glitch you're speaking of.
---
Yes.
---
how and why? she punishes teams that don't coordinate and is punished heavily by teams that do.

It's a skin for a shit weapon that basically noone ever uses when they are not just fucking around. Fuck that skin, no matter how good it looks.

It happens with every big R6 update. Always has. As far as I know it always will too...
---
Oh no, Golden Experience Requiem is affecting Rook with his ability.
---
That wouldn’t let Ubisoft get all the money, so they’d never do that
---
Sometimes the blood splatter renders on your side, when on the server side it doesn’t register you hit. If it happens once I would say a bug, more than once it’s client side debris with a twist of user error. 
---
It’s a fast game with a lot going on, easy to miss little things. But if you cause any amount of damage at all to a baddie, you should/will get the assist when a team mate takes them down.
---
Hey, is the R6 credits and store unlocked for all now or are there still regional restrictions? It's been like 6 months of no updates regarding this.
---
Restart your game

Care to remind me the situation of DICE?
---
You won’t be forgiven for that.
---
Before playing seige at all, maybe like 2 months before i got the game, i started watching tons of pro leauge and learn the maps, operators, so when i actual got the game the only thing i had to figure out was aiming, and just got more game knowledge from there on

Haha. I'm gonna try that.

Another Redditor confirmed she's invincible from both angles. This is new.
---
Hey, it took 3 years and a half for ranked to come out of beta.
---
I am sure they will add it in year 7 at the very least.
---
I completely understand, I come from 2300 hours of cs. I know what weight devotion and dedication holds. I've been to the hospital for excessive wrist use and had to stay away from use my wrist for a while.
---
What I'm saying here is, after newcomer, the players are suddenly thrusted with a shit ton of maps, each being extremely intricate and different from the other and they are forced to play any map at random. Imagine this. Some new guy practiced say 5 maps super duper hard, looking at pro games, running customs, watching tutorials, and when he goes into casual or ranked, those maps show up rarely. He doesn't even get to apply what he's practiced so hard for. There's so many maps, and there is no option to choose what you can or cannot play. It's terrible game design. No wonder the learning curve for this game is hard, because the players are forced to learn all the maps by playing each map little by little and gain knowledge.
---
When you study for a test, and there are 20 chapters, do you read the first paragraph of every chapter first and then do it again for the next paragraph, or do you focus on 1 or more chapters at a single point of time? 
---
That's exactly what is going on with siege and it's absolutely dumb. I want to be able to choose the maps I want to play in ranked and casual, and when I'm satisfied with a map to a bare minimum extent, then I move on to a different one. That's how you learn the game, not by jumping into a shitshow and trying to figure things out randomly.
---
Even if I learned a map by playing it a lot in casual, I suck at it after a while because due to RNG it didn't show up for the next 15 games. This is absolutely horrible as a new player.
---
Now do you get what I'm saying!
---
I’ve been bouncing between plat 3 and plat 2 and I still see them banned mostly. Unless it’s a important ban like a thermite or something.
---
Go to Group's page and click on the 3 dots at the top right corner and there's an option to change user flair and select your operator.

by the design, its either base, or was released during grim sky or burnt horizion
---
Play the game. You won't have to spend any additional real money.
---
I agree but I’m just curious what siege will do to these operators since they keep getting banned. The pick and ban is just a statistical value of how often people would rather ban these operators and I’m afraid they’re gonna nerf them all. But I also doubt they will
---
Best part was there was a kapkan trap on that doorway, it blew up, and Zofia didn't even lose any health for that either.

I'm bewildered as to what happened. My ping was in the low 20's and this was the only time I "lagged" all game.

Cool hax bro?

Everyone and their mom when playing the 2f bomb site preps those windows to jump out in plat+, it happens a lot and it's a pretty safe jump out since the sewer is right there bc normally people arent sitting where they can punish... as long as it isnt 30 seconds into the round.
---
But that's just my plat pc experience... there's a reason it's an incredibly risky rappel.

I did get it in burnt horizon I think...

I’m on Xbox. It has happened once

ATK: FBI Shield Recruit with the m45 and frag grenade - Hits like a truck, good hipfire and a frag
---
DEF: FBI Gunslinger, m1014 for shield denial or cqc and  m45 for long range. + nitro.
---
Or for those who want the same guns/playstyle on both ATK and DEF:
---
SAS Recruit with m590a1 and p226/smg-11. Extremely versatile (especially with p226 cuz long range accuracy) for rushing like a crackhead or slow powerful strikes at the objective, both styles work!
---
Sure, but it would be easier to just learn that a zofia will allways use withstand and focus game development resources on other useful stuff

Yeah it’s really simple these nice reddit lads helped me just go on the rainbow 6 subreddit and on mobile press the 3 dots and hit user flair

You're splitting hairs. HOW those rewards are distributed each season isn't really relevant to the discussion. One grants them as you progress depending on how far you make It each season, the other one grants them to you at the end of the season depending on how far you progress through the ranks. Many of those other games mentioned don't have a ranking system so seasonal progression is the only way to offer rewards. The only reason to differentiate here would be to further your own argument but it's all semantics as far as I'm concerned.

---
Yeah, this was a perspective problem with your eyes because you can see him briefly when you get shot the first time, and when you lie down your legs are sticking out and since your eyes aren’t on the bottom of your feet you couldn’t see him but he could see your legs
---
Just restart your game after you exit the mode
---
I experienced it every other game in high plat 2 but now I’m at high plat 3 and don’t really come across it. I think most people who ddos are at diamond already. So the amount of people we experience ddosing should be lower unless your plat 1/diamond

She actually should have been dead. I put an entire magazine into her on the way down (hence the attempted reloading and why when the lag cleared for a second she fell off the rappel)

It happens whenever you play the showdown mode, it doesn’t happen every time you play, but it still happens a little bit, if you don’t want it to happen just don’t play the showdown mode, and all you have to do is close the game and restart it

Use an lmg and prefire it a lot and just spray enough so that when they peek the hit ur bullets, or just practice

are you playing on console? specifically ps4?

---
No I’m a pc gamer.
---
Because you're a sadist.
---
You're just not gay enough
---
No I dont think so imo. This is just the meta right now.  I bet 4 operators down the road, different operators will be ban because the newer operators will have different abilities that would change how ppl play and how to counter it.
---
thats weird. im surprised
---
Does this include drone phase for attackers too? Or only for defenders idling?
---
Yes a big part of the current meta until they change it into a new meta with different operators that bring alot more to the table and are opish to where they push those 2 operators out of the ban list.  Obi is aiming for 50 to 100 operators in the future. The meta will change and so will the ban list.  Maybe not today or next week but it will in the future.  Also keep in mind they will buff and nerf every character in the future to balance all the operators when they add more and more operators.
---
That's gay as fuck.
---
perspective, and prefire
---
That's the thing it isn't a strong solution most likely it will do very little to actually stop boosting.
---
Enjoy your placebo. It’s a heck of a lot cheaper than a 240hz monitor.

---
&gt; But giving rewards for ranks defeats the purpose of matchmaking.
---
Actually it doesn't, because the entire ranked system of every game is designed to keep you playing and actively trying to get a higher rank. For one, you should be learning by playing, and progressively getting better at the game over time. And two, the systems are never designed to just put you in your rank and then leave you there. If it was, there would be no actual rank displayed, or there'd be no real progressing through ranks. It would just take your MMR, and put you in matches, adjusting accordingly secretly. There'd be no divisions, because divisions are just meant to mark progress, there's no point in knowing if you're bronze 1 or bronze 4 if you're just bronze and staying there. It's also why games *usually starts by placing you lower than your actual skill*, and games always have their seasons keep track of last seasons rank, instead of just starting anew.
---
So yeah, that's completely flawed thinking, you're ignoring the two key points that the game is designed for you to progress through ranks to achieve more playtime, and that players will naturally get better at the game over time.
---
Shut I still do lol, but that’s because of TM’s and scrims/go4s/ladders/league matches. On my main on PC I have 1000 hours and I’m only like level 140, whereas on Xbox I have like 1200 and I’m over 200 lol

---
*sips tea faster*
---
Yup any bad word and even sometimes just an insult will get you come banned, MS must have really been scarred by the 360 days
---
The time to be kicked should've been increased not decreased. I'm playing with my friends, go to take a piss and grab a drink and I was removed for being afk. It's actually stupid. Also, AFKs shouldn't be kicked when it's match point. Now my team is down a member, because I went AFK for 45 seconds.
---
Lmao I walk past it on my lunch break everyday so that would be hilarious
---
But my only question is why a 5x sight? Lol
---
We used to regularly get week bans from all online for messages.

I don't know why people can't understand that there are different people in a dev team for different things, one coder can be programming the new gadgets while another two fix exploits. Im sure the player counts dropped during health because there wasnt any new or shiney things like the cowboy event or the sparkles one
---
Yea maybe it's that... ;)
---
Lame. Ubisoft just absolutely could not bare giving us another pack.
---
People would lose their shit if they made it that way.  
---
There were weekly threads about it on the pubg sub because people lost kills from their bullets hitting the windowsill in front of them because the bullets came out of the barrel of the gun. And that game had it in from the beginning. The way the gunfights in this game plays would change drastically.
---
did u shoot it with ur pistol, but actually miss cuz ur mate shot it first

Do you prefer MP5K or M590A1 on Mute?

Interesting, what servers do you play on? we play diamond stacks a lot and even they ban jackal, maybe we just luck out lol
---
There's only a gap at the top of his head because the shield is misaligned-the top of his shield in this video is roughly at forehead level, but his shield attaches to the top of his rifle and goes up from there.  When you are ADSed your scope should be at eye level, meaning that Blackbeard's shield must be about 6 inches tall for you to be able to get hit in the top of your head.  It's not 6 inches tall.  The problem is that Blackbeard's hands in this video are way too low for him being ADSed, they are almost more in the position of being ADSed with his pistol.
---
Yea I see what happens but, I’m always paranoid soo I preform windows.
---
My username, CheetoSnorter69, is much better.

Out of curiosity, how many Operations have you been around to partake in?

Definitely an... interesting opinion you have.

Holy glasses wtf

Rook mp5 with acog is very good
---
Blitz is a shield with a good pistol
---
Yeah but for me that was really good
---
Or why we can’t just take it out as its own slot in the inventory like csgo
---
Literally none of this shit even matters, it's all just a made up community about a game where people kill people.

Elephant skin makes it 10x saltier! 😂

---
Lol, so now instead of another surprise mechanics pack we get a lame skin for a gun that nobody uses. Right on Ubi. You always manage to hit a new low. 
---
You should have made challenges to actually earn these packs, like every 100th headshot would grant you a pack. But no, that doesn't make money.

I don't know how much smoke is used in Pro Play, but I somehow feel like it still doesn't get enough use to make Warden that good. I mean, he has to stand still to see through the smoke and smoke can make plenty of things go wrong for all parties involved.

and/or the challenge a bit earlier , at this point people are already tired of playing this.
---
What's worse .
---
They had a clan of 3 , we're all solo , their missing people joined yet we're still 4 .
---
What's even worse the 3 stack was a MnK clan .
---
Fucking love unfair matches !
---
Nice. Any tips? I'm gold 2 rn and also trying to get to plat
---
Can they add the option of not falling off like an idiot when I get too close to a ledge that is high enough to kill me?
---
Yes and you have my respect and thank you. I've seen some phenomenal Jackal mains in the past. But for every good Jackal main I've seen there are always three more horrible ones to follow. When I play casual and the end up with a jackal on my team, the first thought that runs through my mind is he's going to get interrogated, which I'm usually right though occasionally and I do mean occasionally they turn out good.
---
That might make him broken. If you can shoot out, but the enemy cannot shoot back, it is not really fair. 
---
They should buff is turret though. If the AP rounds are good shield counters, I'd be fine with that.
---

A tutorial on how to do it was posted literally two days ago.
---
I understand the trigger happy companions will take this as a team kill challenge, however I feel this will also publicly allow documentation of the bs.

Maybe ubi Can use this as a means of banning completely toxic community members and allow for some damn reign in the game.

Plus his profile pic makes him look like he just got away with a quiet fart.
---
They were limited time as far as I am aware
---
That’s true, I just want justice for the Lord though and I don’t really know if any other way to buff him either than making his shield stronger
---
And shutting up does nothing either about it , here at least community managers carry words over , this shit has been here since long ago , it's fucking frustrating .
---
If you have a creative mind yes
---
That's not luck, that's just a headass Mira.
---
 You just want to show off your Legendary Elephant gun skin.
---
Buck has very manageable recoil, once you get over the initial jump.
---
They need to fix his the placement of his turret. As of right now, it is hard to set up the turret There really isn't an indicator of where the game will allow you to anchor the gun. Giving a ghost image would help. 
---
I also hate how the removed the semi zoom the old turret had.
---
It's honestly not that much of a stretch to ask that.. I know I've seen one before where a news station legitimately used a picture of Blackbeard
---
No. I'm trying to give some advice for kaid. Also it's not legendary. You can get it for 40 ubisoft club coins.

I'm not. It is great aim practice. 20-30 min of this and then Ranked

Not saying I don’t believe you but also I didn’t think it could happen on Xbox, we just need to delete clash

I really hope they can fix this quick. I don’t want then to take IQ out of the game again.

Until you realised call of duty done the same thing and wanted some karma*

Well cooked greande.

IQ if you're feeling clever.

and of course: **Nomad**.

Clash requires the support of her team to realize her full power, and has plenty of counters to work with as soon as you drone her out.
---
More like too much work for a mediocre skin
---
See? look at the fact that she moves faster when you're being tased, plus she has a full body sheild, PLUS it does damage, this is why people find her annoying to play against. She's not OP, just annoying as fuck.

Advanced drone placement?

That's not true, alpha packs and countless other cosmetics are availible each season other than seasonal skins.
---
this has happened to me numerous amounts of time. Very good idea.

Maroon 5 was never catchy to begin with tbh

LEAVE BRITAN...I mean...TACHANKA ALONE!!!

Better memorise that recoil

you BETTER stop worrying about grenades now

Rewards like this, atleast from what I experienced (thanks to a friendslist of which a third was filled with boosted players in Overwatch who I thought were legit), would truly encourage boosting in some sick way, as people would rather even pay more for the boosting service than pay money for loot boxes (or the likes) because not only do you get the bonus of a rank going up, you also get the end-season reward. Yes, there are people like this... plenty of them.  
---
Now, put in actual currency you have to get for paying as end-season rewards... oh, boy... you bet that Ubi might end up having less financial reason to invest more in to Siege. It will make less money (they might even lose money) and less money = less reasons to even attempt to fix things that are still in the game... sure, their bug fixing is a bit of a meme, but do you really want it to get worse from there?
---
Yeah, been using it for a couple rounds and it’s definitely harder to control than most
---
My hatred for macie jay has more attack points than you’re love for yourself which means that after all the cancelisation, we are still left with some of my hatred for macie jay, checkmate

Here you go dude, hope this helps you.
---
But the question is
---
Did you sticky it?
---
I started the season silver 1 and I just hit plat 3 like last game and I usually get like 19 per win because it’s so late in the season but I got 30 that game

The text chat is fixed for sure ? 'Cause last time they said it was fixed but it wasn't. What about the DDoSing ? Is there any progress ? I'm sick of "losing" matches because the server crashes...
---

Does my ignorance of having never heard of them imbalance the equation at all?
