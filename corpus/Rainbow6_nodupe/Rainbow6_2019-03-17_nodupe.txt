This is a official Dream Hack match. I love Brazil üáßüá∑üíö
---
---
---
this is one of the oldest 
---
I think it look pretty good with the color and 3D and also interior 
---
That sounds very concerning. I would recommend using Google Authenticator instead of your email, that way literally only the person with access to your phone can get the code, your email however, can be compromised.
---
thanks, I hate ot
---
Yeah it would look like it was trying to be hacked but I‚Äôm sure someone would give up once they realise there was 2FA, plus after changing your password it‚Äôs still doing it, I dunno maybe there‚Äôs a bug somewhere. Perhaps you could contact Ubisoft support directly and see if they know anything 
---
Got 380 hours on the game and got Black Oce for two of IQs rifles, the german pistol, Frosts smg and FBI shotgun, Epic skin for Echo smg, Epic skin for german pistol and lots more, like got atleast one epic/legendary for half the guns in the game and 41 charms... that much? 
---
Can you send the splash art? I am very intrigued now.
---
Try 3 alpha packs in a row, without the Year booster. Two 2% alpha packs and a 5% after two losses. I got black ice for the SG-CQB on one of them, bought black ice for Frost's shotty (when you could, it was a bug) and got black ice for the R4-C recently. Very happy as I'm almost level 150.
---
I don't like that one either. I wish they were all more like thatchers where it's lore accurate and modern and militaristic.
---
Nice. I got one on 4% the other day. 
---
New one still looks fine, elite one just looks better.
---
I disagree,  because every so often you get coastline
---
I half expected it to be iq‚Äôs butt
---
That looks amazing,these updated alpha packs are turning out to be very good!
---
Maybe she is testing the strength of the wrench?
---
Tiny Cav and Tiny Mira.... 
---

---
And that face on tiny Dokkebi
---
It's tactical af. I love it
---
I like how intensely smoke is doing it 
---
Less realistic? I feel like in the previous one she looked anorexic and now she looks more normal.
---
What? 
---
Doesn't look that bad, i'd take it
---
i'm jealous, i like it so much.... 
---
I'm a nobody, but the sub was very dismissive towards anyone who said that Siege has a fundamental problem. Specifically if you said to slow down on new content. Glad a pro final said it.
---
&gt;	r/glazlads
---
I really feel like there should a QOL change for the drones though, sure I can spot them as friendly no problem but the sound being identical to enemy drones makes me way too paranoid when I don't know where it is. I always assume I'm being droned out. 
---
There needs to be an icon similar to Echo drones, that was a great QOL change so I know where the drones are stunning opponents. 
---
i also had some crashes. It didnt brought me back to the game. I had to use task manager to get out of the freeze :(
---
My boi without recoil by playing on console thats not too great
---
First shot missed and two shots that weren‚Äôt headshots connected, don‚Äôt see the problem 
---
Not counting the outbreak packs and the summer whatever packs I got black ice for kaplan's SMG, p90 and mutes SMG.  I have a legendary grand inquisitor for docs and rooks mp5. And I have the plasma pink legendary. Have a few epics for the French shotgun. Aaaaand that's it. Been playing since launch. Idk how many hours o have tho. 
---
My guess is a knife battle to see who starts and attacker‚Äôs or defenders is my guess
---
Jackal. Both of his guns are really good, has a secondary shotgun, smokes. He can fit a lot of roles, entry, support, roam clear. 
---
He thinks he discovered something that hasn‚Äôt been posted on here for years but to some it up, ash + Jewish = concentration camps 
---
Id up your horizontal to about 45-50, your vertical  20 and you ads at 30 but when it comes down to everything sensitivity is subjective and can change from person to person 
---
I love it when ranked games end up like a casual match 
---
Hah!, id love to see a tiny Gridlock
---
The thing about dpi is, the higher your dpi and the faster your mouse movement, the harder it is to do smaller adjustements, pro's don't have this issue because they've sunk hundreds to thousands of hours into perfecting their aim with a sensitivity they felt comfortable with. 
---
I suggest going on T hunt and lowering your dpi bit by bit, until it's between what you feel comfortable with, and what most commonly is in use, and see if that's something you can roll with. For example: you could set it to ~1200dpi, and play through about ten Thunt games, see how it feels, if it doesn't feel too intrusive, go for a couple casual games. If something bothers you, like your shots are off, change it  bit by bit, until you're set.
---
Personally I settled to use 800dpi, I've found it a great in-between.
---
old
---
Hopefully everyones favorite doorblocking thiccboi Monty gets one soon ive been waiting for a long while.
---
Ik but blitz still broken
---
just noticed
---
could be bc shotguns have no headshot multiplier 
---
the second hit the head and third hit the neck which according to Ubi is counted as a headshot

Yeah, they have modified their controllers

Monty should have a Roman Centurion outfit with his animation extended his shield and charging toward the camera
---
Smoke should have a Plague Doctor outfit where the animation ends with the screen getting covered in smoke
---
Tachanka should have a classic Slav outfit: Topless, Addidas Tracksuit, and shoes along with warpaint of the Russian flag on his face with his animation have him spin his turret as the camera comes close, the camera hits the turret and falls to the floor and Chanka Squats and looks into the camera.

For the new ones?

Check my long comment I replied to another user, it explains the process pretty well.

Really awesome.Could you do a coastline map(it‚Äôs my favorite map) and preferably do the penthouse objective
---
Oh you mean new packs
---
Tought you mean when they dropped first 
---
Ya
---
Sorry myyelf is dumb af
---
No ACOG needed
---
Now have thermite but it's so its gliched and he can't get through
---
That sucks ass, was hoping to r4-c the shit outta kids damn
---
That's dumb. If you're gold 4 you should be playing against gold 4 and then whoever wins earns the elo and gets to move up to gold 3 and so on. It's not fair if you're gold 4 and you immediately play plat 3 players because there is no chance for you to move up in eli and challenge people at your level and slowly move up. You just lose. 
---
Happy cake day!
---
Thank
---
If you still lose the MMR like you say and get a ban for leaving then I think it is a good idea for sure

Last night I got knifed in the back by a fucking recruit. Never heard his steps...

You evil evil bastard... y tho

If you watch all the tutorials you get 800 renown, enough to buy ash

Jagers rifle does like 40... just let that sink in

Thnakz, didnt she lose acog though?
---
Hey bro black ice is black ice
---
Very nice, hope to see more
---
This was a seeding match for Dreamhack Rio. Both teams had already qualified so they just decided to have some fun.

Bro I don‚Äôt wanna eat ass, da fuq üëÄ only the pum tang üòé You wouldnt have got diamond without me bro üôÉüòè

if she had ela shotgun the a-cog would be useless
---
yo his head recoiled back
---
Op, no way to counter this
---
Why?
---
That's the point. You get in a gunfight and you win but get downed, you get rewarded by living and getting another chance to kill someone. 
---
Holo&gt;ACOG but ACOG has zoom.  
---
Surprising for me that the map is smaller than I thought
---
You are all bad people
---
Facts
---
Not bad points, although it still seems the drawbacks outweigh the benefits for me, but that's more of a me thing, I'd rather have 3 well-placed Black Eyes and a Mute on the team, who is also great at blocking wall breaches.
---
What has been seen can‚Äôt be unseen.
---
U posted this on my birthday
---
What do you make that with?
---
Just your friendly neighborhood cop
---
Brazil has its own region just like Europe, and North America. They aren‚Äôt just in competitive they are some of the best gunners in the game, and have BR6 and Proleague 
---
i wish they skinned the mags too... always look so ugly 
---
He‚Äôs on duty. 
---
Congrats
---
It doesnt work cause either too much spread or the shots dissapear
---
I‚Äôve been in one and had the game since season 1
---
I took a break from Siege, came back recently and I‚Äôm having fun again. Even when it goes tits up. Maybe you just need time away?
---
Uhh
---
Dude why‚Äôd u but them with r6 creds... Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt just scam u outta a season pass if u buy one legit
---
1500 hrs in game and had this once, very rare.
---
I did that a couple months ago, I‚Äôm probably going to do it again I don‚Äôt really like this operation
---
Yeah wrong subreddit. Try r/rainbow6rule34
---
I‚Äôve got a few episodes left. I think the first 3 were really good then they started getting eh. Lucky 13, Shapeshifters, and Good Hunting we‚Äôre also pretty good.
---
Being voted out by 4 man squads is something that happens to me all to often. 
---
So I am that girl, and as my friend so eloquently saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nervous‚Äù really isn‚Äôt true I‚Äôm not nervous but I just don‚Äôt feel a need to play anything other than casual it sucks but girls honestly have gotten used to it or if not they will 
---
oh ok
---
?
---
I wish I could
---
Go and watch get_flankeds video on mozzie and he will tell you

Gg

So since the Ubisoft service phone number is open only on weekdays, I couldn‚Äôt call them. If I don‚Äôt get the season 2 ops, I‚Äôll call. I had already had enough r6 credits
---
I really like these
---
No, this was the first round of a qualifier, they had both already qualified though
---
What about that is confusing?

This happens to me all too often when I solo queue. I joined a game at a point I couldn‚Äôt be kicked earlier so I got tk‚Äôd for good measure. üòÇ

This. Had a match where I got two drones right away on Oregon. Went to lurk in Small Tower, decided to bring one of my drones with me for extra intel. Had a Castle start chasing it and trying to shoot it. All the while I'm saying in voice: "That drone is mine, stop." Gone.

Ok, but if it‚Äôs a twitch drone that‚Äôs been sitting there hacked for more than 15 seconds I reserve the right to shoot up obj

u should post this on the siege facebook page

I'm pretty sure they do the same thing even if you don't know the commercial.

I know, i was joking

Feel like a dumbass now. Thx

It is for pugs, there‚Äôs a knife round and the winner can decide T or CT

---
It's meant to tell people that there are explosive components in or around the area of the triangle because of the canopy jettison mechanism, or the ejection seat itself.
---
How's the playerbase on Titanfall 2 now I haven't played it since launch bcs of the long queue times. Also what server has the most no. Of active players. 
---
uplay and ofc admins from R6 are watching over reddit. Thats why I posted 
---
People and their hyperbole... clearly the game is not "rotten to its core".  His poor arguments make it really hard to agree with him, and that's too bad since what he's asking for (operation health 2) is reasonable.  
---
Every pro, streamer or player in every game ever blames hitreg more than hitreg actually deserves the blame.  People think they should be able to find enemies via echolocation for some reason.  When they can't, they blame Siege sound design instead of the limitations of binaural hearing and headphones.  
---
League and Dota have good champion balance in part because there are so many (~100).  Overwatch has comparatively limited hero viability at the top end, and has struggled with balance.  Some pros think this is because there are so few heroes (just broke 30) and have called for a much faster release rate. 
---
Pengu, especially, is a bit insane on his balancing / rework ideas.  Anyone have a link to his tweet about increasing Siege's TTK to be more like Apex?
---
No question. HORRIBLE headshot hit reg so far. Driving me bonkers 
---
if you think thats sad watch this [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b2087z/not\_like\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b2087z/not_like_this/)

How can you find your kills per gun?
---
Takes the edge off rainbow to see that the pros can fuck around and have fun once and a while 
---
I'm uninstalling
---
With glaz it is
---
For example I want gridlocks magnified optic on a DMR 
---
the montagne kill was SMOOTH
---
his rework wont have a turret so they'll prob release the elite 6 months after the rework
---
I could say the same when everyone in the enemy team has 9 ping and i with no servers in my region having 80 ping.
---
High ping doesn't affect siege anymore, stop complaining.
---
I would love this
---
I know right, they should add more 1x optics for variety
---
Well, then you have two characters instead of one. And yes, both Mute and Valkyrie both can do things that Mozzie can not, but Mozzie can also do things that either of these can not.  
---
He's great at gaining intel, imo the best to gain intel for roamers while anchoring himself. He cannot gain (much) intel from outside, unlike Valk, and he obviously lacks the plant denial of an Echo or a Maestro, but he has a huge edge on any of these in adapting to different attacker strategies and switching up his cam spots.  
---
In my opinion he is not at all comparable to Mute. If you use Mute only for drone denial you are barely using his potential anyway. And while both of then definitely can deny drones from entering into the site, Mute is full-on denial while Mozzie is pretty much a full on intel op.
---
they said they are looking for a vintage style gadget so no turret for big boy
---
Proud of you. Now go fuck off and get a life like the rest of the plats failed to do. 
---
What ever server you last played on
---
My friend. I would search for casual through the normal section. You can see the discovery casual up the top which means it's only looking for outback maps. By doing it the normal way, through standard casual, you'll atleast find a game and get the outback maps after a few games
---
Mint Oreo is dairy queen‚Äôs blizzard of the month and it‚Äôs heavenly 
---
Or just make the several other veriation of the sights to ALL weapons allowing players to choose any optic
---
Only Brazilians do this kind of shit, I'm proud 
---
I think the problem is the P90 tbh, don‚Äôt use a such a high recoil gun if ur again isn‚Äôt the best

She looks like she's bent over and run into a wall as hard as she could, how does that look fine? Old one was much better, looked more natural.
---
If your being serious and not trolling, ping abusing is where u purposely have a high ping and makes it to were the game takes longer to register what the player is doing so when that player peeks a corner on their screen its at normal speed, but on the other players screen who inst pinging sees that player fly around the corner way faster then it should be. so in general it makes you peek faster in a way
---
Me and my friends were playing 5 man squad and all 4 if them diconected 2 all at the same time and 2 separate rounds, also we play on console and been getting horrible pings (our internet is rlly good average 20 ping past season) but it feels like weve been playin in other continents wven tho console you cant choose that
---
Dummy thick
---
lol, I got voted out last week just for picking mozzie. Guy says this guy has the audacity to pick my op. Mind you it was the first round of defense and no one picked gridlock on attack. 
---
I completely agree

From 0:04-0:07 did anyone here one of his teammates say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a guy up my ass‚Äù ?? ;)

Ok thanks, I was just deciding witch operators to invest in lol
---
Unfortunately it does matter, if you play alone and want to find a team to play with on PS4 communities app than people there ask two questions your rank and K/d, And if your k/d Is lower than 1.0, noone will invite you to play.
---
lol
---
This post exactly explains what they have already don since year 1

I use to like watching Pengu, but honestly he has done nothing but whine literally all day since the new season started. He hates 1 hit headshots, he hates crouch walking, etc. He wants Siege to be CSGO, but doesn't want to play that game instead.

You could say this is a high IQ play here
---
Tie each game purchased or account to a certain device. For example, if you buy on xbox it ties whatever account you bought it or installed it with to the xbox serial number. So if you'd want to play on a smurf, you'd need to purchase the game again, lowering the amount of people that would buy it. I'm sure there are other creative ways out there, not saying mine is perfect but it's an idea. 
---
Oooh the pixel
---
But I bet you could get the hang of it after reloading thousands of times -_-
---
Any social media I can follow you on?
---
Agreed. 
---
Never understand how someone gets to plat that quickly.
---
 I've been getting gold since red crow (silver in dust line, skull rain, and wind bastion tho).
---
Itz not only siege. Every competitive game has smurf. Cs go, lol, dota, overwatch. They all have smurf. There won't be anything done to them because the company is happy about it. Why? Coz they sold an extra copy of the game. There are tons of smurf now coz the game is on a HUGE discount. I used to get really frustrated as well. But understanding that there is nothing the companies will do I change my mentality. I hope you dnt get annoyed when I say these but instead of hating on them I start learning from them. How they roam, peak angles, or even simple movements like how to q, e peak. Once u learn wat they do to u, u can use this in ur future game. You will realise over time you stop caring about smurf. I started as a silver in operation chimera . I manage to push to plat last season. I'm not trying to brag and I know I still have alot to learn. I play about an hr or two a day and watch tips and tricks from YouTube and also some skilled but funny YouTube clips. So I guess I do invest a bit of time in it but I think the change of mentality help me get better. I know it sounds cliche and dumb. But give it a try
---
Okay that is clean as fuck

This exact thing happened to me with hung before the breach buff and I killed myself.  I was crying laughing at my stupidity. 
---
Yes 
---
I‚Äôm fine with everything except Chalet and Kafe but at least Kafe will get fixed next season.
---
"Hey everyone look at my ass! I also put on a vest and helmet, but that's not important look at my ass and give me upvotes."
---
Think about it this way, the best creative ideas may sometimes not be the most balanced ones.
---
The game is already hard to balance as is with some operators being straight up BS and some maps being hard to design. For example, even in Outbreak there were no hatches (as far as i recall), and I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy the new map for a couple of weeks, tops, before pulling some weird strats that make the map unplayable or borderline dislikable.  
---
Take Favela, Yacht, and Bartlett for example, these ideas were unique and fresh to the game, but were ultimately bad from a balancing standpoint. A different example would be House and Chalet, these maps were balanced and not too bad to play in when the game first released, but over time, the addition of operator abilities made these maps increasingly difficult to play in, especially for defenders. This was also mentioned by Pengu in a recent stream.
---
Not trying to piss in your cereal or anything, I would love to see a hospital map, but at the same time I don't wanna get spawnpeeked like in Bartlett or take 10 years to clear roamers like in Tower.
---
The bamboozle strat comes with practice and relies heavily on timing and positioning. Macie does it the best out of anybody and it works and I've actually been trying it myself using his tactics and it actually works. 
---
This looks great! I'd love to see ya make the elite!

Thanks for agreeing

Yesterday after three wins I got three packs in a row
---
Ah bruh she Retarded thiq
---
Inb4 "IQ thicc" comments
---
tbh I have no idea why its not. Out of any gun in the game, that scope should be on a DMR
---
okay, who puts an eotech that far up the rail?
---
Uninstall and reinstall the game if you dont have space. The reason for the update size is because they optimised almost all those files so they all need to be downloaded again. The game is 10/15gb smaller adter the update
---
Its impossible to say, the mmr you win or lose depends on the avg mmr of both teams, you get more if you win against a team with higher mmr and lose more if you lose against a team that has less.
---
NO RUNNING IN TEH HALLZ
---
Very Nice! love the vest.
---
For March!?!?! 
---
Understood. Thanks for clarifying
---
All those points have not been accurate in my case. I've joined plenty of 1-1 and even 1-0 (for us) matches. Plus those arent reasons to let people play entire matches with missing teamates
---
Still thicc as ever!
---
When I won 8/10 in Grim Sky I got Gold I. 
---
You‚Äôll get gold 2 if you go 8-2
---
Nice! My chances seem thin though because no proper squad
---
lmao at the people downvoting. This is why ubi should never listen to reddit 
---
Lets see if i win those 4
---
How about the load times
---
I'd love it. Russian reflex is amazing, I love the acog on gridlock, and mozzies holo is perfect
---
I personally never leave even under these conditions. Just wish I did not have so many of them in such a short time span. Generally I see more of what said here and it is probably due to people leaving due to the said reasons.
---
Masta.
---
You did a mistake asking it in this reddit lul. hype. 
---
I think your name should relate to your team characteristics. Let's say you guys like tigers, and your team is full of people that like memes, then your name can be something like "LaughingTigers". LT. It's a terrible example but it's just so you can get the idea. Go with that you like tho
---
I made him rage quit üòÇ
---
Still not as bad as the 3 times in 6 games I was TKed and kicked at the start of a match by toxic groups yesterday.
---
If it's ranked, i'll play a tryhard 3 armor and try to clutch rounds. If it's casual i just cry or take clips from terrible players :3
---
Actually yes. i have. 
---
I know but when was a last time you won with recruit rush
---
Hell yeah! Going to target tomorrow. 
---
Because when they roll over onto the bike it‚Äôs so cold that it wakes them up, it‚Äôs a hard life!

lvl 100 and bronze 2 lol

I love these

Is Rainbow Sex the new name for the LGBT group?
---
This is in The Division 2 mission where you have to find some Missile components. It‚Äôs located in the Air and Space Museum.

You forgot the comment, it has his gametag.
---
Give me one picture of an operator with mostly fat than muscle that you have worked with
---
Sounds glitch restart your game 
---
The fact the guy is dressed as a Recruit is the cherry on top of all this.

I think it has to do with low FPS actually. I could never do it at any FOV on my laptop till I got 144hz on my new PC...

How do you make these?

It happens all the time
---
yes thank you! i forgot the name. I think this is kind of wink towards it! :)
---
That is an edited name ;) note the different, bold text
---
This isn't exactly how probabilities work. It's not correct to add up probabilities from different rolls, you have to multiply them to get a figure for how likely it is for you to obtain an alpha pack before your percentage reaches X%. For example, to calculate the probability of getting one alpha pack before the counter reaches 6%, I would do Pr(S) + Pr(XS) + Pr(XXS). X represents a failed roll and S represents a successful roll.
---
Honestly it depends on the gun. Some guns I like the reflex some guns I like holo and some I like acog. It‚Äôs all personal preference and while I would use less of the aforementioned scopes if I could use the p10s  holo on more guns it wouldn‚Äôt stop me from still using them all. 
---
Why does this remind me of some bathroom floor
---
For what?
---
So you can see the rewadrds you've gotten in the packs before?
---
If so, why? 
---
When you want limb penetration really bad
---
Yeah the sound glitch happens all the time lol 
---
(average plat 2-1 solo player) I just did my promos the other day. And speaking through experience these matches are like a coin flip. You can drop a 20 kill game and still lose a ranked matched. Just gotta accept the loss and queue for another one. Only way to solve this really is to play with a team. Siege is a team based game for a reason. 
---
Let me bring NATO optics on Russian guns and Russian optics on NATO guns. And allow some of the unique optics (Swedish pistol, 44 mag, p10, SAW, AK reflex) on other guns (even if only within same class or something)
---
100% use the same tactic typically. Pick up that Doc/Ash and just go to town.

Get kicked for clutching a round anyway. Winning an Xv1 means you‚Äôre cheating.

what program do you use for this
---
and it is really awsome
---
I'm gonna answer them one by one with my honest opinion:
---
State was terrible
---
Goals: fix the game or at least make it a \*lot\* better
---
During: worse
---
It didn't reach the goals
---
Honestly, just go to youtube and watch operation health montages. Nothing was better after that. It felt terrible, bullets being eaten all over the place. It's like the smaller updates made it better... or i just sucked at that time but still.
---
I was like "Huh? Bank looks weird..."
---
Its way to early for me ... need a coffee to compute.

Thanks for the answers guys, appreciate it!

you win right

You forgot the Echo behind a deployable shield in the back corner

Fookin Laser Soights ofc

14 kills good f\*\*\*ing job

wouldnt this be called voxel art
---
Maybe she has maybe she has better :p
---
Yeah except some people disconnect and then rejoin a round later not on purpose so that would take that function out and I think that‚Äôs more useful to be able to reconnect with your squad instead of making ranked more like casual
---
You're the last one left complete the mission.
---
feels bad man  
---
its really hard to get decent teammates
---
Sorry for the air squats. Never skip leg day.
---
NO! it sucks because sometimes it doesn't reload for some reason, then suddenly someone peaks me because i'm in an offensive position. I should kill em but it didn't reload, so i thought i had bullets. TURNS OUT I DIDN'T. It's annoying, if you like it then maybe an option in the settings would be nice
---
Love how Sledge got a hammer kill.

Idiots. (that applies to everyone who cheat too)

Thanks

wait, what? do you really cant get the thermites hot chopper?

love the attention to detail like the smoke clouds coming from the objective bio hazard container
---
Good Stuff 
---
I agree. I did start to play Ela more, i just position in close range and if i can't spray i burst. It sucks but the recoil is sometimes lucky enough for random headshots :p
---
I think Ash is still good, and ACOG isn't a must, i just used it cause it looked good. But i loved ACOG and now i ruined my settings only to actually have the ability to see from long range with holo. (4:3 aspect ratio btw)
---
I even sent feedback to support and they told me to talk about it in the forums, i wanted them to actually do something better and nerf the recoil of the r4-c instead of removing the acog. People are still using r4-c btw, even better then before XD. No one responded and i told em that, so i've been told that they will discuss it with the balancing team. I doubt it that they will actually do that, but i have hope, it's little but it's there
---
Gsg9 shotgun, mp7, r4-c
---
I completely disagree. 
---
First off, Ela isn‚Äôt what she used to be, and is so much less effective, and rightly so. She‚Äôs in a good place though, whereby she can be strong but has to work hard to get her kills. The only change I‚Äôd make to Ela is giving her impacts back (swap with vigil, as vigil can then get a gadget buff). 
---
Ash without ACOG May feel odd but makes sense, eventhough I can‚Äôt see it achieving much in terms of lowering pick rate for example. 
---
As for Lion and Glaz, we‚Äôve only seen a couple of clips of their rework so it‚Äôs hard to judge. Lion will be worse than now, for obvious reasons and this isn‚Äôt a bad thing. I do feel he may be a little too weak though but we‚Äôll see. I‚Äôd just give him a passive whereby his drone tags runouts instantly with a full body outline (like currently). This passive is strong but defenders have full control of its usage. He‚Äôd still have his actual scans to use in game as well. 
---
Glaz is a hard one. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he got a damage increase again, now that he doesn‚Äôt have the banana vision. Maybe buff it to 85dmg from 71. 
---
I do not know. Thank s
---
Matchmaking was extremely bad (yes even worse than it is now) and you were locked in the matchmaking screen when you were queuing, so no changing loadouts or cosmetics.
---
M870
---
Not trying to be a cock, but is that at lower ranks? It‚Äôs almost impossible to get a normal game because of de ranking and this is  the usual sign of it.. 
---
And 416-C
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i posted this yesterday reeeee
---
Oh sorry never mind the rear sight is a bit obstructive 
---
I see you, smurfing in Newcomer's playlist ;)
---
300% coconut brah will steal it
---
Are you solo queuing? If so, you are basically screwed. Nothing you can do except try and clutch every single round because teammates are just extremely bad in low gold/silver. I frequently play matches in which at least one and most of the time two of my teammates go something like 1-7 or 0-6. 
---
Most people reload even after firing one bullet, I don‚Äôt think this‚Äôll make a huge impact.
---
However, if you wanted it to be more realistic, they should make it so that when you reload with ammo left in your mag, you lose that ammo, like in real life/games like swat 4, instead of ammo being added on top of the ones you had left. This‚Äôll make people think twice about reloading with ammo left in the mag

Must of?

You meant "Must have"

Same as "should have" and "would have".
---
"Must've" has "ve" at the ending, it can't be "of".
---
I would honestly strangle anyone using M&amp;K on console. Sit on stomach with my hands around their throat and just squeeze...and squeeze....and squeeze...and finally squeeze some more til they lose consciousness.

That was a strong was of showing my dislike. I obviously wouldn‚Äôt do this, but the temptation is there.

Bandit and jager looks undressed for some reason

I'm I the only one who's sick of the same skyrim joke?

I probably am.
---
This is what ranked is in lower gold and it's indeed extremely frustrating. I hope Ubi fixes this problem one way or another.
---
Haha totally not overdone am I right guys?

The r4c is probably best imo but there‚Äôs also the L85. Shotguns are always easy with no attachments too.

what if someone tk's you while u have 2 reinforcements 
---
1yr old repost xdd
---
You know, they're going for lore and I hear he's a middleweight boxer, I wouldn't mind seeing that personally but Plague Doctor is nice.
---
Yep. If you and a friend and can all 10 reinforcements out, you have a much better chance. Then you don‚Äôt have to rely on the roamers who run off immediately to then come back and reinforce. It would be so nice indeed
---
I‚Äôm not always braindead
---
I totally understand your point, Maestro and Echo are quite similar with respect to their gadgets and utility. Mira is also fun and can be quite useful, especially in House garage, where they can hardly reach and shoot your mirror. So I'm not trying to talk you out of choosing her, I'm just saying that sometimes teammates will completely fck your strat up. I had games where I couldn't put my mirror down, because no place made any sense. Other times however she is a beast, especially with the nitro and the Vector gun. Like in House garage, I love that place, and I love to annoy poor attackers who try to come that way. :)
---
I watch Bikini too :D, and yes, you can definitely troll around with Clash. But those players just took my spirit away. Not that they cannot find a reason to start their toxic bullsht, but I'd rather not give them a green light on purpose.

This is just me on alt account, not fucking joking. Glad to meet you again sir

LMAOOO
---
Velvet shell should always play...problem solved. 
---
You need at least 3 boxes to effectively reinforce on Favela though...
---
Somebody plays war thunder
---
Comedy gold.
---
Same. That‚Äôs why I added a couple of countermeasures to try and reduce the impact of this. They need to really punish players who do this as well, and no leniency. If you take reinforcements and die, that‚Äôs you losing vital utility whether it‚Äôs on purpose or not. They need to be punished
---
That‚Äôs sheriff teddy doing his best to protect the town can I get some good job Teddy for our boy in blue

Also I dont really know what karma is or does. Ive only been on reddit for 20 days and this is my first post. I just use reddit to see the r6 memes and clips and whatnot. I just found the snowmobile funny so I posted it. Obviously in my 20 days of being in this r6 sub reddit I wasnt there when they posted those so I really am not trying to basically steal content for karma, whatever it is.

Hello krogan_69, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b259a1/this_glitch_makes_me_sad_cuz_i_dont_own_it/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Give me my money back!
---
You can get there without a shield
---
Simpler option would be to allow 10 walls for the team, no limit per player, no crate or any resupply system. People interested in reinforcing the wall will rush to put then in place, roamers will continue to roam.
---
Therefor it‚Äôs a shield glitch, and people wonder why newcomers hardly ever stick about
---
Well I am not saying that it's right or a good alternative, but I am sure that many use it even though they know it's wrong. 
---
And thats how to ruin the game for more than half of the enemy team
---
Well, guess all the MnK console players know how to nowüôÉ
---
No.......
---
I love it

Wasn't this posted like 4 months ago when wind bastion was coming?

Somehow I really like this elite, guess everyone have a different sense if beauty.

So many problems atm. Such a shame.

Its actually kinda fun, me and My frriend were playing ranked and we Got split up into different matches.

The same Thing happenned for him, every team blow itself up. 
---
Smoke really looks like a guy who could do a good punch, make his MVP him punching a punching bag off or something.
---
can we get 5 likes

No i dont
---
Never knew you could even get up there. Thanks for the tip
---
To be fair, IQ‚Äôs is worse
---
This gives me flash backs to when I very first started siege when Lion and Finka were new, and right after my placements for ranked I was put into gold 3. Well after that I was paired with the same team of 4 that kept taking their turn TKing me so they didn't get kicked... Then forfeit after 3 rounds. You have no idea the fear of having to try and escape your teammates. I even tried to delay my que but I still ended up getting on their team 4 games in a row. 
---
Bahahahhaha that‚Äôs gotta suck
---
Stolen
---
I'd prefer if you got X amount of reinforcements depending of you're armour rating 
---
Some1 posted a video awhile back with every step. Need a shield for sure
---
Shield ops are bullshit
---
Well not really because they don't get the extra settings in-game.
---
It looks like they use a controller so they get the normal settings
---
‚ÄúReality is often disappointing‚Äù
---
my only issue is continuously joining games already in progress, but otherwise its much better
---
It's a shame elite frost mats are so much easier to see than classic mats.
---
If somebody could do these for a bunch of maps and label the callo-outs, that would be pretty cool as well. Nice work!
---
Actually most don't know that its wrong from the start, but when they get corrected they get mad and continue doing it. So its a 50-50.
---
To my defense and all fairness, I had a legit question, but I guess someone took the opportunity to clown on me. Guess I can't clap back without being labeled as a bad guy huh? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Can somebody make a 16:9 version of this?
---
hell does exist
---
Ahh, didnt know that. Well that's good I guess
---
Honestly really good job
---
That looks like quite the bunch lmao
---
It‚Äôs not a shield glitch.
---
The fuck is a hype beast
---
i think block'n'load has a perfect example of what to do, 
---
1st of all, you can choose if you want to be placed in an ongoing game
---
2nd of all, if you finish a match you joined the match does not count as a win or loss 
---
3rd of all you the amount of money you get is as if you won the match even if you lost, encouraging people to remain in the match
---
and finally the last one is that if you quit too many matches you will get a temporary ban 
---
I was gonna write something to but hey reddit app says f you and crashes so here we are. And another thing i saw this new...
---
They did a massive restock of the Zebras so now everyone and their grandma's have a pair. Also yeezys have become much easier to cop, they release a much much larger quantity for every release. 
---
Nope
---
Wizard Thermite is also pretty stupid.
---
I‚Äôll post how I did it later
---
The bandit one was leaked and looks sick
---
Like i said app crashed and i didnt able to write anything
---
I've found the afternoons to be the worse time to go solo. Team kills and failed spawn peeks galore. 
---
First depressed, then less, and now emo.
---
I watched the video. Used a shield to get on something outside by climbing over it.
---
We can all agree Blackbeard‚Äôs is the worst 
---
I prefer to meet people boosting every so often then when I play with my friends have to say against better people than me every game
---
Yeah but they cancelled the plans as it wasn't mentioned at the invitational, Glaz, Ying, Lion and another operator are getting reworks and Frost isn't one of them, they'll have realized reworking her would just make her too strong.
---
Google it
---
How did you loose 3 rounds against no one?
---
Have any carried reinforcements return to the box 
---
Once you get high teir good it‚Äôs mouse and keyboard heaven on Xbox. Can‚Äôt ever get passed feels bad man 
---
Git gud
---
Remember to use the orange headgear for maximum salt
---
Have you never played any games or sport before?
---
Dude. I did this yesterday. And everyone went recruit. And. We all had gsg9 with the M870. 
---
you weren't here in 2016 were you? Blackbeard used to have that shield at 800HP which made it indestructable, they then nerfed it down to 150 HP and gave him 2 rifle shields which still made him strong, they gave him another nerf for the rifle shield down to 60 and then a final nerf down to 50HP and buffed his speed a little.
---
Yes? 
---
It'd be cool if along with telling you the item and its rarity, it'll also start to make a graph of your chances as well, so you can keep track of what % of packs you get legendaries in etc.
---
Saves having to do it myself, recording all ~250 packs or so I've opened!
---
So you are confidently saying me and my friends only play together because some of us are cheating? As someone who spent the entire last season in copper, smurfing happens but not enough to say screw all the low rank peope
---
He can survive a headshot tho thats pretty strong 
---
Nope.
---
Just leave it like it is. Battle pass is a horrible idea 
---
Yeah so much has changed!
---
Casual is much better. I still think there could be a few improvements. Switch to 3 minute rounds and allow attackers to pick up the defuser before the game. One thing I don't like is that attackers can't predict what the site will be and therefore can't make intelligent operator choices, but I don't see a solution to that bar letting defenders chose the site or letting both sides know the site in advance.
---
Are you referring to that meme
---
I still wanna see that Frost going through that barricaded door.
---
They should add that in game 
---
Yes please
---
I... Agree with that.
---
I thought it was an autistic pulse tbh
---
Why does this look like an image you‚Äôd see with a creepypasta
---
so its just a pile of useless parts now, pretty sure the gun helps it fly
---
Nope... why do you think they did? Honestly curious.
---
This is gonna sound like the dumbest shit ever but the ‚Äú :) do u like it ‚Äú just looks so wrong to me. 
---
I was staring at this photo for a whole minute expecting it to be a video and didn't even realise what it was showing. Fml
---
I hated this game in the very beginning, cause it was a full online game.
---
I started playing from Velvet Shell, and i was in a non stop for a while.
---
And now i love this game so so much
---
The scorpion is the only gun I used burst on.
---
For that price $10 more gets you a 1660 which performs better then the 590, and 580s go on sale for $180 pretty much always if u just keep an eye out. 
---
Even if its free?
---
Unmanned Drones,GPS Satellites, Foooooookin Laser sights...The more crutches you have the more it hurts when they‚Äôre kicked out from under you...All I know is that a six inch blade never looses reception.
---
I also approve 
---
Just use the FO-12. It‚Äôs probaly one of the best shotguns in the game.
---
*Lemme smash
---
The guy you replied to is also referencing Metal Gear Solid 3.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the wings and engines help it fly more than it‚Äôs gun. 
---
He probs wont get one but id like castle or monty 
---
This picture is fucking with me
---
Mine was an angel keyring
---
Ok so I got ash rushed last night and for some reason (map was border) I didn‚Äôt hear ash rappel jump in and shoot 
---
As a Ela main I do agree her Scorpion is very random. It has pretty okay vertical recoil now due to the recoil change that happened all around but it's horizontal kick is way to high. It does less damage than the pistol and even the shotgun is more practical at anything it ever does. Her shotgun's the only good part of her kit and her mines only last a short time when you get hit by one which is really bad most of the time. Her secondary gadgets are nothing special especially since they are more focussed on 2 or 3 speed defenders since Ela's don't really need a shield since it makes it more obvious when hiding or whatever and barbed wire is mainly useful only for objectives which she isn't really on all the time. Her pistol is decent for the most part but the only good thing about Ela is her shotgun and her character. As she's the only one in the game I believe to have any. And now a days I still play her every round I play, I want play Mozzie but I don't love him as much as I do Ela when I play him. It's very frustrating to play Ela  but I'm fine with it especially when I get to blast away at people with two 12 gauge shells and see them ragdoll across the room. But recently the only time I see Ela is when I did really good with her last round and the new defending player picked her to try her out, which is really sad. And it doesn't seem like Ubisoft even cares for her anymore.

nope, not everyone can do this. lot of players tried this and its not working for everyone. The excuse is always "its not a glitch". Like above drum on skyscraper or the glitch window on outback.

Because IQ is an operator everytime I see "200 IQ Plays" all I can think about is an attacking team of 200 IQ mains storming the building.

Thank you. I've stopped playing him because of this. Also the fact that people will shoot drones I'm going for every time
---
A huge problem with TK (it‚Äôs always been this way) is accidental TK. Shooting a camera and a teammate walks infront if you. Spraying an area teammate walks infront if you. 
---
One way they could fix it I guess (the penalty at least) would give players an option after watching the kill cam to select if it was accidental or on purpose and obviously if it‚Äôs accidental it doesn‚Äôt enable mirror damage. This of course is easily abused. 
---
I‚Äôve always thought that MAYBE at some point there will be a way that the game is smart enough to realize what happened and if it was an accident or not. 
---
DeAngelo was the fucking worst
---
Tell me how this is a glitch.

That looks sick
---
No. *Cocks gun* This isn't Fortnite. Don't poison a game with rather few micros to incentivise them. You're idea will make this game worse. I'm sure everyone will agree.
---
Its a team game, everyone needs to contribute. You cant just pick

up the slack for your teammates

like that. If someone decides

to not reinforce then it should impact your team. Communication is key, this isnt COD that you can do

everything yourself.

The geneva convention in particular was only for 'equal' wars. By definition, terrorists are not fighting 'equal' wars and thus are not covered by this convention. Of course, there are other things that they do violate, but Geneva is not one of them
---
Dang it I thought I would be first
---
Furthermore this could be a great option to vary the number of available reinforcement for different sites. E.g.: i always feel that haunted/gargoyle on Theme Park lacks some reinforcement, what do you think? Great Idea btw.

Dunno that always fixes mine. Occasionally takes a few tries

What if it‚Äôs a map that you don‚Äôt need all 10, you expect them to run to a different floor and find two random walls? Or do you want them to cover up a rotation because ‚Äúidgaf about your rotation, I don‚Äôt wanna lose points‚Äù 
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea of making reinforcements mandatory, some sites it works to turtle up, other sites you have to open up and play offsite from adjacent rooms.
---
What if someone gets gets held up in the prep phase then gets killed by a rushing attacker on the way to reinforce some hatches? They get penalised for dying before using their reinforcements?.
---
One idea might be to forget about the penalties etc, and add the ability for a defender to drop his reinforcements for another to pick up that way if you know you have shit to set up on another floor for your roam or rotation you can go do that without being held up trying to find a wall that isn‚Äôt reinforced. The main issue I see with this is it would probably be PC only because I don‚Äôt think console would have enough buttons for an extra ability. Plus again, it encourages players to turtle. They see that icon on the HUD showing 2 reinforcements laying on the floor and ‚ÄúTHEY MUST PICK UP, THEY MUST USE, THEY MUST APPEASE THE GAME‚Äù
---
They gassed a bunch of innocent college kids. 
---
Yep. 
---
Honestly not a bad idea if you want to take the game seriously but don‚Äôt want to worry about your rank. If you‚Äôre someone who gets stressed out by losing MMR, then playing seriously non multiple non-main accounts could probably alleviate that a bit, until they all level out. 
---
I've been playing since the open beta, I'm only level 176 or somewhere around there.

They are probably Bots, just pieces of coding script.

Congrats, you got plat in the year where the game was most unbalanced, most bugged, and the least competitive

U are a bold one
---
After hearing they might be taking a look at her shotgun, I decided to see if there was a way to make her Skorpion viable, and my solution has been flash hider, vert grip and 3 round burst. I swear, with this set up, you will have the tightest and fastest burst of any gun in the game, and if you can line up a headshot, the recoil won't take it away from you. It's brought new life to the character for me.
---
I mean like the original ops

Or scandinavian/nordic

Seasonal skins don‚Äôt apply to new ops

Best map since Villa
---
Gives a new way for trolls as now they can make not only 2 but 10 silly reinforcements that could help the enemy team even more. 
---
There is also always one level 40 dude who starts barricading and reinforcing everything he sees brainlessly. 
---
Making it a physical box doesnt make sense either, you might as well just have a pool of 10 reinforcements as originally planned.

I love jackal because his ability is the perfect balance of selfish and team. Also his guns are awesome, shotty is helpful on windows and stuff and yeah. 
---
The initial test versions of the A-10 didn‚Äôt have the GAU-8 installed. The gun is heavy, but the plane itself is heavy in its own right. 
---
Not sure if Ubi is brave enough to throw in the throat cutting gesture, but it would look cool.
---
It sounds good but factoring in the time it would take to collect the reinforcements we may end in a worse overall position. Say there‚Äôs a crate and it takes 1s to collect a reinforcement. That‚Äôs a total of 10s holding the interaction key in a prep phase that‚Äôs what? 45s? I‚Äôm not quite sure how long it is. That gives defenders a total of 35s to set up effectively. 
---
Another factor would be the placement of the box. How long would it take slow ops like Mira and Echo to run over to the box? I‚Äôd guess 1-3s depending on what spawn within the room they get and how big the room is.
---
And then this encourage roomers not to worry about reinforcing entirely. So the slower ops may have run upstairs to reinforced vulnerable hatches. Further cutting down time. And we haven‚Äôt even factored in the time it would take for ops to set up their specials or shooting out drones.
---
I feel this would inadvertently cut down the prep phase time for defenders by a minimum of ~20%. And that‚Äôs just managing to collect the reinforcements. 
---
Thats hot
---
Noooo... no no no no \*giggle\*
---
Maybe the laws don't apply to them, Rainbow is the elite of the elite and are called in only when "regular" special forces can't get the job done. Rainbow gets the job done and they are an exception?
---
Sad
---
Since when? Because as of 3 weeks ago, the pricing of the game changed, all the base ops were returned to the original purchase model and all owners of the starter edition were upgraded to the full game.
---

What about that faggot that picks up all the reinforcements and puts none of them down?
---
Those "one minute remaining" reinforcements are game changing my friend. Never get a bigger rush
---
Certainly. It's not out of the realm of plausibility, though. And it does make sense for a small, self-contained unit like six to employ a jack-of-all-trades pilot, especially when that mission profile does tend to blur. Notable examples include outbreak and 75% of the wildlands r6 mission.
---
Third floor isn‚Äôt s a garenteed win for defenders
---
really speaking, unless you don't care about ranked, you should wait till your atleast lvl 60ish minimum to start ranked. By that point you know general layout of maps and ect. I didn't start ranked until lvl 100ish
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
The attachments and sights depend on your recoil control with many guns. So I suggest you play on attack with holo and supressor but if you like "sniping" acog and compensator or muzzle brake if the gun doesn't the compensator. Oh and check the recoil in the operators menu. Defense for anchoring best Doc or Rook with mp5. For roaming Bandit or J√§ger wuth reflex and muzzle. Also mp5 with acog nad muzzle. Hope this helped.
---
Ball\_Busters
---
Set your sensitivity to 35. I have that and it helps with my aim a lot. Warm up with a t-hunt and try to play with different sight lines. Don‚Äôt skip killcams. Watch cameras on Defence or Attack for your team. 
---
Then we would need an exponentially longer prep phase, which could be just annoying to the attacking team if all of their drones are gone, ooh maybe a top down map of the entire map that they are currently playing on to mark up and plan their attack. 
---
This same screenshot multiple times. Literally your entire squad all posted this...

Sledge rushes with the shotgun are satisfying as hell when you pull them off, the main objective is basically to get as much kills as possible before dying, pretty much.

I think it was a bug if I recall correctly. Very weird indeed.

Thatchers gadget has been nerfed to shit, nowhere near as powerful as when the game first came out. It lost it's range, it's ability to destroy cameras, no one even uses thatcher let alone thermite or hibana, two of the most useful attackers.

OP just don't understand that for example rushing with ash and dying is a waste of drone. Just like doc who spawnpeek and die from attackers weaken his team. The game is balanced in this term of 2 drones/2 reinforcements per operator and everything you do affect your team. Why people not making post like ' if you gonna rush objective and die, at least throw the drone somewhere to help us gather intel and win'? So guys start thinking and stop yelling about something that is done perfectly.
---
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself.
---
Admittedly it is kind of unusual that they haven't justified another Op with "she flies too".  Especially given the existence of several women in divisions which straight up don't accept them.
---
I agree it's not cool come around a corner and just see doc's forehead. So I guess its shoulder peek only now. I need to remember that. 
---
Yes you need it. Don't worry tho. The total game size will be much smaller after it's finished. 60 ish gigs with out the UHD texture pack.

---
Vigil is really fun and super simple. Just drop your reinforcements and go roam (or reinforce any hatches). He helped me gain a lot of map knowledge and made me a better roamer. Not to mention his gun is amazing 
---
even in low gold high silver its the site you use when ur down a point or are at match point
---
The biggest issue I currently have with the beginning of seasons, is high plats pairing with 2-3 bronze/coppers and roflstomping our gold team.

But I believe that is more to do with the matchmaking system and MMR in general then unranked comp.

It‚Äôs fun

the floor above was untouched, which means it didn't shouldn't of went through

How do you get on the shark on outback?

Go play casual then if you don't care about rank.

How do you get a tag showing your main?

It creates more of an opportunity for defenders to retake a site.

What elo is that

Ugh, not every operator has to look like a model. The 3rd one is ugh

They have at least one more order these that I found. Didn't know about these two!

Mp5 acog is cancer

Irl there isn't really a reason to put an ACOG on an MP7 because the rangefinder is meant for 5.56 guns. So all it is is a 4x scope which there are plenty of less expensive 4x scopes than the acog.

Yeah, I play Mozzie a lot AND Twitch on attack and I am paranoid. I cought Twitch drone few times already though but usually you need to hunt it.

It‚Äôs not unlikely, they have a few ops from siege in woodlands with missions and everything

That rule is garbage then and only helps people who want to troll. Makes zero sense.  And we muted him after the second round

Dont worry. Its only a mater of time before we get Chelsea Manning in the game.

Doc and rook are heavy thicc boys with great abilities, but they are on defense which means the can hold an angle that is one Œºm big and kill three people.

Imo doc and rook acog is unbalanced but im the only one who thinks that even though i use them to spawn peak every round getting two-three people per defense.

Can it still be done without a shield? Last time I tried, I couldn't find the exact spot to vault. 
---
Lol, I debated wether to put a reinforcement on it or not. I‚Äôm not too creative so I couldn‚Äôt get it to look right.
---
Im lvl250 consistant low plat, im also finding this season frustrating, tbh it always is like that in the start of the season , so dont worry too much
---
this does not apply in gold and above.
---
Im plat 2

Very old.

Hello realTimShadyy, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b29k8w/ash_still_broken/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Shittiest idea I have yet seen on this sub... You are telling me I have to reinforce 2 hatches like this yeah no. 
---
 Extra  explanation... My ping was in the 20s and Ash's in the 40s. I'm aware  that the last two shots probably didnt render server-side. This isn't  about whether or not she should be dead, but that she should not still  have full HP.
---
Just some hopefully  useful feedback on the current state of hit-detection, hit-boxes, and possibly still Ash herself. Just ignore me getting distracted by Kapkan trap explosion. And apologies for poor mic-quality.
---
Both are amazing
---
and get 2-3 spawnpeek kills every defence? i highly doubt it
---
Yes
---
I do the dumbest peaks though ._. 
---
Feels bad man, have an updoot to feel better.
---
Yo thanks! You did you job well as always!
---
Wait so someone can just troll and waste ton of reinforcements? 
---
Is it that you disconnect at the end of a match and get a connection error?
---
well sometimes its either force or fail soooo...
---
First time?
---
How about you can carry one in inventory and carry one in your hands then? 
---
First Hibana looked like a girl to me. You just have unrealistic standards for women.
---
Yeah but someone could troll and put then more than 2 reinforcements other side of the map
---
Can't agree more on that one
---
But : imagine toi tk one of your mate, for fun purpose, it's the Big fun Time and all, and then, later that game you take a Line, start shooting and a random passes un front of you, that one was 100% accidental right? And you not gonna get banned because you haven't teamkilled the same guy twice 
---
I'd say KA-BOOM with them! 
---
Old gear, not from this season
---
Are you agreeing with your own post? 
---
Trolls can do alot of things now. You have to think wider than the solo queue casual experience.  
---
Nazi mods are the reason we can‚Äôt have fun... at least Dissenter exists. Anyway, very cute cosplay. Have fun ye white knights... it‚Äôs not like the chick is going to suck yo dick.
---
I dont think it'll be his elite. If anything a halloween costume.
---
She‚Äôs the next ninja, except better
---
I like this one more... 
---
Butthurts and shitty mate everywhere, I feel you, that's why when something like this happens, I just, mute him, no shutup, no Fuck you, just mute him, he doesn't deserve your Time, attention, or concentration 
---
Why do points matter, you‚Äôll get like 80 extra points. 
---
I 100% did not think that the orange bars were some kind of performance representation and i was 100% not confused as fuck on the logic behind it unill untill i realized the orange bars were only to cover the names.
---
Lol wat
---
How am I going to keep some big mean mother hubbard from tearing me a structurally upperflorus new behind?
---
This idea wouldn‚Äôt change people being stupid with reinforcements, communicate it to them and hope they listen 
---
That gun does 30 and she‚Äôs a three armor, so you have to hit her in the chest five times to take her down
---
Of course I know it isn't directly related.
---
Directly being the key word here.
---
I didn't even mean that she'd have to walk the distance, but instead the fact it's a timed run and I really don't think you could get even near the required time if you are obese like Gridlock is. Even if she was *just* overweight and not obese, there's still no way an overweight female no matter how trained could make it. At least not or any of the special forces I've read about.
---
I'm not sure what the issue with the Navy Seal test is for women, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's the running. Women are physiologically worse than men are at running. I'm not 100% sure what all tests they run for the candidates before accepting any of them in though so I can't know if there's another even worse test for women that none can pass.
---
Jesus Christ over sensitive much? You're apart of the corrupt mod problem, and also your face is just really smooth, and to me you do look like a hyper realistic doll because of the filter
---
A reason to buy the Division 2!
---
I mean is anyone truly a medic excluding doc? They just pat you a few times, you nod your head and then they pull you up and you're good to go.
---
If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, it won‚Äôt disappoint. 
---
I love borderlands 2
---
Yeah even tho I'm lvl 116 I get gold 1 but it's more fun being in copper
---
She doesn‚Äôt even look Asian with that face either 
---
bruh, you need to stop whatever you're doing and buy it now then. It's the answer to 'what if we fixed most of the shitty parts of rpg looter shooters'.
---
Setting up as defender already takes plenty of time. Especially as Maestro as who I'm almost always late with everything.
---
If reinforcement box was added it would have to be quick and reinforcing time would need to be made shorter too.
---
And then when reinforcing walls would get buff, reinforcing midround would be less of a risk and some nasty tactics. I'm not sure if it'd be a good thing or not.
---
No idea
---
I dont know what was worse between Sledge dolphin diving due to a nade behind his neck or the complessive Frost and Hibana situational awarness. Fairly sure you could've literally walked behind her and defused without her noticing.
---
nope, mozzie has a sick ass reload on the commando 9
---
And is this on mobile &gt;!I think it isn‚Äôt!&lt;
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the grip of an mp7 can‚Äôt lock in an angled position
---
Only if the attackers can grab them too because I want to rush into the site and steal their reinforcements
---
Drone just wants to go boing
---
God I‚Äôve never been more erect. Has Ubisoft done what has never been done and made a decent Loot shooter?
---
Yeah headshots aren‚Äôt one shot kills anymore and it takes like 7 rounds to the body. Like wtf I feel like I‚Äôm playing destiny lol
---
Hello oorbitall, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b2af6a/ranked_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Good spot
---
That's an "Archer" meme what i wrote... Thought its obvious. 
---
And by the way, when it comes to a profession, yes, i don't like myself compared to a sex doll :)))
---
Ps.: Jesus has nothing to do with it.
---
Did you gain any Elo?
---
Grenades, that's it. She's a good fragger with her lmg
---
Yes. 3 whole elo.
---
I'll give it a try anyway, thanks
---
kapkan's trap, which actually damages you and is  not much harder to spot, frost, lesion which is near impossible to spot and can fuck you over in some situations, etc. 
---
Not worth the time theyre renders so theyd need to make renders for every srt of armor and camo in the game, not only that but that would increase game size a considerable amount. And more when the newer gear comes out. 
---
She is legit a transgender dude ur calling a man thicc
---
I've really been grinding it as I enjoyed the first one, but the end game at release really put me off. I can safely tell you that this isn't the case for number two, I'm almost at the max gear level you can currently reach and I still have a checklist of stuff to do every day when I get on. 
---
There is a few issues, as any game has, but the devs seem to be on it with patching anything that could be regarded as a really bad bug or glitch. For example, the first day or two of release, players (mostly PC) were getting game freezes, it was fixed within a few days.
---
the end game grind is quite big and challenging, there is so much more to come so its only looking up from here at the moment. Gear sets, new strongholds coming very soon and then the 8 man raid is also in the works to release in the near future.
---
If you like a challenge, and a game where you can grind to fully optimise your characters build, then I'd definitely recommend giving it a go. 
---
That's muscle though. Gridlock is literally straight lard
---
Ranking system sucks, and players can do what ever they like. I personally like shooting team mates in the spin. 
---
So the next map better have a ramp. 
---
Do you have to break something on top of the blue thingy, because I tried for a good while last time and just couldn't get the prompt?
---
No way dude. This 9 year old on my team kept getting headshots but the stupid game wasn't counting them. Ubi plz fix
---
That‚Äôs a bad idea what is someone takes all 10 and doesn‚Äôt reinforce? 
---
I found a app it‚Äôs called goxel 3d voxel editor
---
Bro literally just noticed that they ripped the GAU-8 off that A-10 and used it as AA in the Capitol Building Stronghold. M I N D B L O W N
---
I know.... But Mozzie is not related to the "meme" Gridlock is...
---
I don‚Äôt break anything when I do it
---
You need to twitch drone the other twitch drone now, establish dominance
---
You leave my carburetors alone you bigot
---
*Licks IQ*
---
Wow dark M8.... I like it! 
---
Nice one
---
by 'him' he means tachanka.
---
How is this game OP? I'm on the fence
---
You and him are great examples of the toxicity in this community. 
---
Exactly my thoughts!
---
Definitely not lol you mean buffed. 
---
Trial by fire. Keep playing and know what to listen out for
---
Both teams had throwers. This was one of them, standing here spinning around every now and then
---
I know. I was trolling in first place. You don't need yo explain it again. But thanks I guess 
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal. 
---
(How).
---
u/Cole_Dude this is what she used to look like..
---
Enlighten me where I said it was hard to counter...?
---
That‚Äôs not a very good argument. 
---
I‚Äôd rather my team die by my hand then to fall to cav 
---
And this is why Rainbow is not fun, but it was even worse when the C4 would act like actual nades
---
Came out during Grim Sky, have it myself looks great. 
---
A big part of military is also marching, anyone can march but then march with 60lbs of gear, built like tank
---
THROW ALL THE FLASHBANGS
---
Two Drones during prep phase
---
Restart your game 
---
This was after I restarted it, this was the 3rd try the other 2 got up to 10 mins.
---
\*Visible Confusion\*
---
As a platinum player I pretty much never play solo. I only play with at least 1 or 2 friends and now this season we are only playing with a 4 stack. Get that random 5th thats a mouse to go against the enemy mice lol.
---
Oh wow. Isn‚Äôt the point of the game to utilize the map to the maximum advantage? I‚Äôm just surprised cuz I‚Äôve seen pro players vault in border twice to get on top of that one locker in armory 2nd floor. Never heard of this before
---
my favourite clips are watching cav get obliterated 
---
Try restarting your pc and doing it. It bugs out for me some times and fixes it self on restart
---
At least it isn‚Äôt a Alpha pack charm, which was my first legendary 
---
I can't say for certain that *isn't* why. However yes, I am talking out my ass.
---
IIRC there was a small buff this season as her traps are/were essentially useless at high level play.
---
Totally agree wait till i upload the other video from this round..
---
It's not that Ubisoft doesn't care about console players, it's that they are truly powerless to stop players from using keyboard and mouse. Native keyboard and mouse don't work on console. To get around that restriction, players use an adapter that converts keyboard and mouse input to controller input. As far as the game is concerned, those players are using a controller the same as anyone else.
---
Pmm cuz it is the best, the gsh is wack and weak 
---
this has been happening since two days ago i have restarted my game, and reset my pc multiple times since then.
---
Hello TimTheChef, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b2baax/r6_siege_outback_roof_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
PMM. Does around 55 damage and it feels great to use.
---
I'm just gonna say it...THICCCCCCC
---
It‚Äôs tough trying to control recoil on console. But playing enough you almost get used to it. 
---
Makes sense, he was the helicopter pilot in operation outbreak 
---
The primary measure of how well you played is whether you won, which in and of itself is not a crazy thought. Does it really matter how many kills you achieved if it wasn't enough to win you the match? There's also a concern that adding personal performance based ELO modifiers would encourage players to make selfish plays to light up the scoreboard rather than making the tactically correct play.
---
I know this will be unpopular for many, and I do intend to further clarify why individual stats are not reliable for determining rank, but I think a lot of players who advocate for individual performance to influence rank are missing the forest for the trees. In bomb without any rounds going to a draw, it's possible for one player to have 45 kills and 0 deaths yet lose the match 5 - 4. You could talk me into one of those round losses in which you secured an ace being just bad luck on the timing, but not five rounds in that way. If you were to have that stat line in a 5 - 4 loss, it's because you actively did not play the objective despite the opponents having planted the defuser.
---
To get into further details without the dramatics, there is no way an automated system can ever accurately pinpoint how well a player individually is performing in Siege. There are so many decision points players have to make that will never be registered as an activity by a system but which contributed to the success or failure of the team.
---
For instance, let's say you are watching a teammate's camera (be it a Valkyrie Black Eye, Maestro Evil Eye, Echo Yokai Drone, or a bulletproof camera) and a Zofia comes into frame about to flank one of your roamers. For the sake of simplicity, you have three choices (and you can potentially combine 2 and 3):
---
1. Do and say nothing.
---
2. Call out on Zofia's position.
---
3. Scan Zofia.
---
The only activity that could be measured by the automated system is number 3; it's also probably the most likely scenario to ensure that camera gets found and destroyed and likely not the ideal option. The game can't possibly distinguish between 1 and 2 so it has to treat both the same. Since the game doesn't know what you decided to do and more importantly won't know the impact of your decision, it can't attribute the outcome of that event to you in a positive or negative light. You can say nothing and your teammate logs the kill or you could've given the most pristine callout and your teammate ignored you or missed the shot.
---
Team performance beyond wins/losses could add an interesting flavor if they can figure out a way to balance the ELO out as a result and ensure teams aren't given an incentive to go for a stupid play to increase their potential ELO to their detriment. For instance, giving the entire team the same bonus to ELO for winning an attacking round via objective might add some spice to the ranked recipe for some teams, but I'd worry there would be teams which end costing themselves round wins trying to get that bonus when the most strategically correct play is to go for the frags.
---
How about remapping the key?
---
Was this ranked or casual? If it was casual then they most likely don‚Äôt know what to call it. Maybe they don‚Äôt know the maps well so they can‚Äôt describe it perfectly. 
---
yes but tachanka is useless at high level play, so is cav kind of. they shouldn‚Äôt model the ops based on pros. it ruins casual play where most players are at. i don‚Äôt hate frost i think she‚Äôs the worst operator but i can‚Äôt stand cav. they are both over picked
---
Ok I tell this to everyone just restart the que if it passes 2 minutes 
---
Hahahahaha
---
well aware...xD but still
---
imagine caring about a chubby female being added because it "ruins immersion." If they wanted to be realistic every character would look like the first 4 ops. It's not forced, your just a panzi edgelord
---
You're the one who's moaning about it.
---
Seems to be just that time of the year which people get siege on a discount and go troll. 
---
That‚Äôs happen to me but it was gridlock 
---
That's not what a few of my more I.T. savvy friends have said. They have said it would possible to create code to detect 3rd party adapter input or even track movement.
---
So, ya  Ubi doesn't care about us console players.
---
Very good, the joke is a nice addition. I‚Äôd rather they made her smg a bit more accurate 
---
Not sure how im an edgelord or a pansey because i dont like fatchicks, green haired 30 year olds, or furries in a realistic game.
---
But hey. To each there own.
---
You should cosplay nomad, you look exactly like her
---
Holy fuck my immirsion is ruined! They added a phat ass white girl. *equips IQ elite*
