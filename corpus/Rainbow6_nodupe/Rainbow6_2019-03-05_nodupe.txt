This is a clip for Stonemountain64

It was ranked so that can‚Äôt happen.

‚ÄúThere is too much cholesterol in your firearms Badger‚Äù
---
I highly doubt the patch will exceed 22GB in size, my guess would be about 7 or 8GB 
---
You‚Äôve got to love em
---
What an original response. Were you here when it came out? The sub was flooded with hate for it
---
Honestly same. The enemy team instantly gets replacements. Meanwhile my 3 man team is getting crushed
---
Idk it says network failures but not for casual 
---
is there a specific platform?
---
This shit makes me puke. Everytime I see some fucking fan art it just reminds me of the amount of horny socially awkward kids on here. I hope you guys read your "dokk is bae" comments in the future so you can see just how cringy you are.
---
Thing is, I went over to a friends house the other day to finally update it... and it was 50gbs.
---

---
I couldn't do that even if I tried with my data.
---
I pray its not more than 7 lol, I could do 7 easily. 
---
kitchen?

:)
---
"role" implies he is in a fix/premade team
---
his problem is most likely with randoms, in which case, you have no fix role, feel free to switch
---
The SMG11 would pop Thatchers elbow brace off..
---
You ever seen Thatcher dance before? Nah me neither. Ever thought about why that is?
---
Uhm, where to buy.
---
Well, I noticed that you did not understand the part of my country, so I'll explain in a way that until you understand, if you're reading, that was an assumption. Bye.
---
You are my hero ‚ô• 
---
One thing I‚Äôve noticed with Mira is that the 2-round burst gives the Vector pistol-like recoil and helps save ammo in clutch situations.
---
just a tip for those who are struggling to learn her.
---
!RemindMe 2 days
---
This is a unrecognized ***nerf*** to Rook... 
---
The whole purpose of armor is to increase the probability of a DBNO state..
---
You do realize I'm talking about her horizontal recoil? The gun jumps to the right and to the left in unpredictable ways and you cannot know where it will go. Her horizontal recoil was not a thing in Para Bellum. And then in grim sky it got even worse than it was after nerf. I know how to control recoil because all of the guns have a specific recoil to them. Ela's SMG shoots up and then either to the right or left. And because of her high fire rate, it changes direction with every 5-10 bullets. It's fine in the cqb. But when you try to kill someone from a +10m distance, you can't use full auto at it will most likely not hit a target. It doesn't happen on any other operator as much as on ela. All we want is to revert her recoil pattern back to Para Bellum. That's it. 
---
Lol that has been there for so long I don't even notice it anymore. 
---
I 100% agree, although you should create a separate post, you‚Äôve already got my upvote üëåüèº
---
I guess that explains your name
---
Data limits. 
---
For some reason the first thing that came to my mind seeing this was a K/DA siege version.
---
It‚Äôs for people who play the game and have thought these before. There doesn‚Äôt need to be a punchline. We all know Thatcher is the only SAS without the SMG11, so he‚Äôs making a joke, and giving a reaction to something that‚Äôs never been acknowledged in game.
---
It‚Äôs very funny. There doesn‚Äôt need to be 4 panels with an icebreaker, peak and half assed punchline.
---
Why write a joke when you can just illustrate something humorous instead?
---
Not quite.  "Actual" Clancy is the Jack Ryan series until The Bear and the Dragon. Teeth of the Tiger and beyond is speculated to be written by ghost writers and it shows. Rainbow Six is one of the original books written by him, focusing on John Clark. 
---
The books based on the games are written by authors under pseudonyms. Original Clancy is usually a lot more wordy and when it comes to military stuff, a lot more technical. The difference is noticeable in the books. I personally never bothered with the game books. 
---
Cool now I can be sneaky
---
*shoots somebody*
---
HIIIIIIT I'M HIIIT
---
Even though it doesn‚Äôt get any updates it is still fun in its current state, plus this is a source game so mods are made all the time. There have been two major community updates for MvM (PvE) recently and custom maps and weapons are made all the time
---
Aaaw thank you!!!
---
Oh, it‚Äôs cause Cuphead is a run n gun
---

---
Why the fuck would you put furry in your flair? This is a Rainbow 6 subreddit.
---
Furries are the only demographic of people that will advertise their fucking fetishes in inappropriate environments and then complain when they're mocked because of it. I'd give someone shit if their flair said "cumshots" and that pales in comparison to the shit you're into.
---
No custom bindings.
---
I know it‚Äôs weird
---
Yeah I was literally an inch away, we were on skyscraper and I knew one of them was peaking on the window so I popped him quickly then the next dude did the same thing. It was risky but I had like 10 seconds.
---
DevilBigD_SYM is dragging down their squad rank points, what a little bitch. I hate those types of people, they should make ranked balanced with the amount of what players have what ranks and use them to match it with other players. Based on overall team composition instead of the classic smurf carry 
---
Sounds about right!
---
Burnt horizon?
---
I was gonna quit when they said they were taking agoc off the r4c then i realized i had black ice for g36c
---
Asah thank you so much Gordy!! I am happy with the result üòä but I like that it got this reception üò±‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I've seen the background picture before it's Glaz  with a fuze charge blowing teammates and enemy's up.
---
Lol thaaaanks!!!
---
100% agree! Can't believe it's year 4 and this shit still happens
---
*Oof*
---
Nicely done
---
True but fingers crossed if it is combined with stronger tools to target those abusive players and  the additional carrots the developers are talking about adding to the game for positive behaviour, the kind of abuse of the system you are (correctly) guessing will occur will be in the extreme minority and will benefit the vast majority of players
---
On Favela, I did every time I saw a black persons eye, I put the cams on the eye 
---
The 2 step verification is completely broke took my friend over a month for it to work... hope you find the answer u need tho
---
that KD and WL should tell you to pick someone else 
---
Indian Operators?
---
Bob - got into Six with the reputation of the 'bob and vegene man', a certified level 20 Windows technician that invented the internet and removes viruses and plagues with a snap of his fingers.
---
Turns out Six was scammed. It's just a scammer.
---
Weapons:
---
Syskey - hard-counters thatcher who isn't the best with technology and locks him out of his home PC.
---
Mobile phone - Dokkaebi's ability basically but hard-counters female ops by stealing their nudes.
---
Ability:
---
Team Viewer, installed on all drones, so Bob can get control (albiet a bit laggy) of the drones.
---
Yea but the most sketchy part was where I was, I was behind a solid wall
---
I prefer normal cause all GSG9 operators wear same outfit also Jager is lovely. im bit missing about same outfit operators
---
It happened to me to when I was in gold I even played against a 4 stack of diamonds and the last one being plat 1
---
Be proud, it's pretty decent.
---
Never open alpha packs on the test server. Now you know.
---
Technically it should be available before the Y4S1 update
---
You can tell what days are weekends just by looking at this go up and down
---
Honestly it‚Äôs every day
---
I'm pretty sure they addressed that at the invitationals hence the new running animation since lean and crouch spam are being nerfed
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but the green destructible doors are in place of the second floor balcony wall and not upstairs.
---
The honest answer? Don‚Äôt play casual. They say that they‚Äôve fixed matchmaking but it‚Äôs still more of a fill-as-needed matchmaker. 
---
Currently in a game with 4 toxic diamonds on fortress who keep tking their 5th man
---
Meming on the old meta. Good to see this since the environment gets so toxic now
---
At least it's original. Wasn't expecting Halo, nice touch.
---
correct, parabellum came out early June last year 
---
I blew a dudes brains out with Mira's shotgun yesterday trying to make a hole and he decided to reinforce the wall. 
---
Yeah you are right, I'm from Parabellum but also fan of Siege, this music made goosebumps feel the hype of old days. plus i got on my arms.
---
Cash money 
---
It was just a little idea I got for an intro. I appreciate it! 
---
Well I didn‚Äôt take all these things in consideration.  I guess she dosent need a buff and maybe I need more practice with her 
---
This Wednesday
---
You don‚Äôt throw with recruit. You use someone else so you aren‚Äôt detected.
---
He was born in Ceuta, which is Spain, but in mainland Africa
---
Ok thanks guys.
---
nope it‚Äôs the worst skin you could possibly get
---
Looks bad in my opinion
---
Oh
---
It‚Äôs decent, but there are better skins out there.
---
Real niggas sledge ppl w/o fbangs, fbangs for pussie
---
Trust me.
---
They killed a dog, barbecued it and put it on display. PETA are monsters.
---
that doesn't even make logical sense...
---
Bacon good
---
Not this season but the next 
---
Beeflord Maestro or lesion
---
Dw kid you won't egg Ben
---
Sound sound sound. Always listen out for audio cues. Such as an enemy breaking a barricade or just sprinting around. And pre fire, if you know somebody is around the corner, or just ahead in the objective. Also intel is key if you‚Äôre attacking always drone ahead and never go through an entrance unless you‚Äôre sure nothing is inside it such as a trap or enemy.
---
im not playing pc lol cant screen shot it
---
Thanks but PS4 
---
Lesion is a really solid defender. He's pretty versatile, so you could roam with him if you wanted to
---
I wish they just gave him a bucket helmet or whatever those half helmets are called. 
---
hes actually in the middle of the indian ocean
---
Keep your crosshair at head level, don‚Äôt aim towards the ground, don‚Äôt be in a spot where if someone drones you‚Äôre fucked.
---
Lion have a FUKING BOOM BOX THAT GIVE YOUR TIME HALL HAKS and This dont make Sense but glaz vison dont afect alies and see troug smokes.
---
pixel peeking &gt; wide peeking
---
Maestro and Lesion are probably the best 2 defenders.
---
Lesion is the god of assists and can stop sudden attacker rushes.
---
Maestro is great for intel gathering and hurting attackers.
---
I dunno, people sleep on that c-75. I always hear "oh it takes up too much screen space" but honestly with a silencer on it as an aggressive solo pusher she is amazing
---
yes. 
---
It's alright id have loved it if he had a plain t-shirt underneath and a bucket helmet (Sons of Anarchy style) thought.
---
If only that was logical nowadays 
---
I always went with the "When the weekly missions expire" system, worked for me, but now that its at 6th and missions end 5th my brain big confuse
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even consider this a nerf this is making her global ability balanced it‚Äôs not that drastic 
---
Her gadget?
---
Dude, you take reddit way to seriously
---
I think that he might actually be from Indonesia. In his bio it mentions river crossings and jungle, and North Korea is made up primarily of forest near the DMZ. I suspect he and his family might be refugees from the West Papua Crisis. The timeline would fit and the terrain would match. The only limitation of this theory is how they crossed the ocean if they did at all.
---
Is this ranked of so what rank is this in?
---
Thanks guys! This community is awesome!
---
Hopefully they don't screw up Kafe the way Ubi did to Hereford.
---
He is fundamentally broken. He is a shield operator intended to be a rushing frag op that lessens the effect of roamers, as you said. But it's the way he does that that's fundamentally broken. He's literally a fragging shield op that can sprint with his shield out, flash you, then quickdraw on you or one hit melee you. My point is that Blitz doesn't belong in a strategic tactical shooter like Siege, you don't need to be smarter or a better player to get kills with Blitz, it's insanely easy to outplay people with him. It almost feels like he should be a specialist in CoD, rather than an operator in Siege.
---
This was Gold IV and Silver I
---
:(
---
That‚Äôs exactly how it works. It only blinds you if you‚Äôre looking at it OR if it lands right next to you. 
---
Elite bandit didn't have time to change after leaving the gay fetish bar before getting ready to operate 
---
I'd be curious to see how Fortnite came into play
---
Loud as hell, slow reload, not instant detonation, only got 2 charges, has a blast radius of Japan, and vacation everything else that's solved by Zofia.
---
My online name is suny or s.u.n.y on ubisoft 
---
Look, leather jacket (zipped up), black t shirt, and then a black beanie. Boom, you got a cool ass biker dude without looking like a total jackass. 
---
Yes she is holding a weaponized fidget spinner, this has been around for a while now and not just for her elite set.
---
But just think about how if you wanna check if anyone's home, whether casually or in a break in situation, you can just do this from your bed and gain all the intel you need. 
---
It's time to train so that we can become Rainbow Operatives.

Holy shit. Thats amazing. Can we  Do team empire.
---
Frost is way too far from the west coast. She‚Äôs from Vancouver.
---
It‚Äôs realistic I‚Äôll tell you that.
---
in reality they shaved his head
---
i never said Lion made sense either, but we're talking about Glaz
---
No.
---
;(
---
You will have to go through it like everyone did. We now have 3 hard breachers as attackers. And with 2 brand new operators coming out, the game changes every season
---
There better be an operator from Minnesota this year üò§
---
He could save others from rage quitting, but not himself. 
---
They need to be mounted to his shoulders.
---
Looks like Monty finally traded the shield for a real gun
---
Quality OC!üëèüèº
---
Unfortunately, not everyone can get over things like a mature adult. And if my sister acted like a little shit, I would treat her like a child too lol
---
If the hostage doesn‚Äôt want it, they can move.
---
yeah that's fair. But lord like, its kind of the battle royale of every other form of media nowadays. Bloody everywhere. 
---
Lmao wut? How did they do this and how could I try???
---
With Burnt Horizon they are implementing a new team damage/kill system. After one team kill, damage will be reflected back onto them if they are intentionally trying to hurt you (IE, shooting you in spawn, shooting you when nobody is near, etc. I am hopeful for a good algorithm). Ubisoft still cares about the game to an extent, but they don‚Äôt do enough to demonstrate this care. 
---
How about no
---
what... the fucking 
---
boooooooooo
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They reverted it back so that you have to unlock the default operators with Renown, which was how it used to be on launch. It was up until Season 3 I believe all default ops were unlocked as soon as you got the game. (I got R6 around the first season for Year 3, and thats how I got it.)
---
My younger brother is just getting into Siege and it saddens me that he'll never truly know old hereford
---
They missed turkey :(
---
this has been in use(not very commonly) since 2012-2013
---
the second one look much better

Well I bought it like back in January, I‚Äôm just now playing it since I didn‚Äôt have a pc before now
---
Since Blackbeard is so close (I assume Seattle) I think it was just so they weren‚Äôt right on top of each other. Still, you are right.
---
That's how it is suppose to be now, since they going back to the old model, where you have to unlock all the main ops, they are also removing the started edition of siege from store (i think they already did) 
---
January of this year?
---
Recruit is not supposed to an attractive choice. He's supposed to be kinda shit. He's a last resort for when all the operators you own are taken. 
---
Fuck this massive movement of players that think recruit is a valid choice. For recruit rush, yes, anything else, noll. There is no reason you should ever pick recruit.
---
No the purpose of recruit original was to test weapons and use him before getting base game ops the problem is now that there all free recruit has no purpose and should maybe be removed like they did in the pro league playlist
---
Look. I only live to hear to hear Ela and Zofia violently shout Kurwa and Mierda (I might be using the wrong word) at each other. 
---
It is absolute sibling rivalry brought down to the battle of the memes. 
---
No wait I think it was December, of last year the last time they had the 70% off sale or something, that‚Äôs when I bought the complete edition
---
Ela totally acts like a little shit lol.  Like, Ela spent her life crying over passed away family members and her sister being better than her.
---
Like, if she was real and you were a terrorist, you could literally just say ‚ÄúHey Ela how‚Äôs your father doing?‚Äù And she‚Äôd break down and start crying her eyes out, whereas Zofia would rip your fucking arms off and beat the shit out of you with them.  
---
Then she‚Äôd pick up her crying sister and take her home.
---
Rip operation chimera 
---
i bought it today and got it lol
---
I didn‚Äôt know Ash wasn‚Äôt born in the US
---
**HOW'S YER MUM**
---
Oh, Ela wins the meme war by a landslide, but in a real fight, Zofia would kick her ass with all 4 limbs tied to the floor with her eyes closed 
---
Have you tried relaunching uPlay and the game? I've had premium items disappear for short duration's because of some brief disconnects before.
---
Yes and people are desperate 
---
**HEY NICK HOW'S YER MUM**

Lvl 128 at this point and only get the p90 from doc/rook. Tbh i need to opennat least 35 alpha packs so maaaybe can get one there

Oh ok, I thought the default ops were already unlocked when you bought the complete edition
---
Hits me right in the feels man
---
But u missed
---
Oh you mean the leaning? 
---
Fuze spawnpeeks
---
I agree but it doesn't even exist in ranked
---
i take it u cud hav taken him out ez pz :P
---
long que times in high elo, eh?
---
You killed it... how could you?
---
Theres operators born everywhere in europe but not scandinavia...
---
Have we heard anything about the size of the download? I have shit internet and slow download speeds so I‚Äôm curious how long this one will take me. 
---
Oh true true, I usually play full stack so it‚Äôs never really been an issue for me
---
Haha this is my nightmare!
---
Man hit you with the Michael Jackson

I either solo que or have a trio so it tends to be an issue from time to time

Oh, for some reason in my mind it didn‚Äôt click that the season was starting soon. Guess I know how I‚Äôm spending this weekend! 
---
well he could have a backstory saying he is a reformed terrorist after seeing the pain the white masks caused at bertlett and made him realize that that is not what he wanted so he joined team rainbow as an informant to make amends for the damage he caused  
---
Maybe, he just out played you really. I am looking forward to the lean spam fix coz I understand your frustration 
---
yes
---
I play on ps4 and I would like to play ranked, not because I want to become the next pro but because casual is very inconsistent to me (player leaving and joining, tk ...). I am very comfortable with english and german
---
Because of that soft peaking thingy we don't have?
---
More people than on PC
---
Any time I see that metal roo I always think about how much it looks like it just skips every arm day.
---
Bruhhh why the fuck did mute peek so much he was last and there was 15 seconds 
---
Dang that sucks, my group and I are super stingy when it comes to our rank and we‚Äôre only in gold 2 and 3 lol 
---
It‚Äôs possible, but I don‚Äôt think Team Rainbow would want to work Kamikaze into their tactics lmao
---
But. Keyboard and mouse has an advantage over controller? 
---
That is it, I've tested it
---
No leaving games effects your win loss i have an acc in copper 4 aswell
---
Right? I couldn't get over that either. But hey, I'll take it.
---
When you're level 257, you get nothing but duplicates. Literally. Nothing. But. Duplicates.
---
I don't care if it's a legendary or a common, I just want something NEW, NOT A DUPLICATE.
---
Yeah that was still a really good ace
---
As I said, it has lower recoil on console. 
---
Oh and what rank are you maybe we could play some time
---
If you all die and the random is the only one left, you gotta review every move like they would have
---
Sooo no wider deployable shields yet??
---
It‚Äôs hinted he‚Äôs from North Korea or China but we don‚Äôt have it confirmed.
---
I‚Äôm looking back over the clip and my ping was about 114 but I was right next to main entrance, and out of sight... so he would have had to shoot through a pillar and a wall/atm to get a headshot
---
20hp is good. I don‚Äôt think resetting was ever a strategy intended by Ubisoft to be used. The capitau buff was broken too because you could shoot it over a barrier at the ceiling and it would push ppl out too effectively 
---
I love it. Needs more TKing though... somehow 
---
There has been no announcement of changes being made to the ESL map pool what the fuck are you on about?!
---
This would help reduce tbe toxicity. Im all for it
---
The steady rise of Siege is sexy as hell, especially since there's more playing directly through UPlay.
---
They didn't give an official date but in the reveal said the rank changes would be during the "first half of the year" in terms of year 4 so barring a delay it should be season 2.
---
XP
---
The problem is the people using XIMs would still be able to use MnK against people that are using controllers. Adapters like XIMs make it appear as if all input is coming from a controller, so everyone using an adapter would be sorted in ti console (controller) lobbies. This sucks but unfortunately only microsoft and sony can really fix this issue.
---
Nice! Hopefully G2 &amp; Nora gets put in the game soon
---
Balance.
---
Very true. I assume every operator will be nerfed this year, some for no apparent good reason. 
---
Was that not a Zofia you downed with the shotgun? Why didn't she withstand. 
---
Maps dont work like Tachanka
---
pp roni
---
I'd trade ya if I could, I'm not much of a Jager person. I mean if we need to deny throwable stuff then I'll play him but I like some the GSG9 skins on the rifle personally.
---
No Greenland ops because the sea border closed
---
Something like this would go a long way to curb the lowest level of toxicity while rewarding the good players.
---
I do think something like this should go hand in hand with a much harsher hand when dealing with the toxic players though.
---
Reset rework may allow Ubi to introduce damage-based anti-troll measures. Whaddya think?
---
Oh. Shield desync fix.. love it! 
---
Wait are they actually cancelling capitaos buff?
---
Thank you
---
There were never a country called Israel in the first place.
---
Israel is an illegitimate state.
---
imo main twitch target is to take out jager ads abd miras
---
no u
---
OH LORD
---
Where can I confirm that shields are getting attended to?
---
Only 90's kids remember this
---
Way better than usual sawsiege shit posted here. Nice work
---
i don't think contacting ubi will change anything. i have the standard version installed on my xbox since mid parabelum and i got all the base ops for free. but last week i made a second account on my xbox and even though i had it installed since parabelum the new acc didn't have any ops on it
---
killing whole eneny team by yourself is an ace
---
Navi?
---
Not hard to do with Q and E on default keybinds but still a bit finicky. 
---
I am not sure about this but is he using m&amp;k? 
---
The defender we need
---
huh
---
Idk
---
But switching the keys allow you to lean one direction while moving in that direction allowing for quicker peeks
---
I need my damned Great Lakes ops, their power, building sand dunes to impede the enemy

Nvidia accepts freesync now buddy.

I can't relate. The last terrorist is almost always the one I die to, because the last one needs to be killed some cool way like with 360 hipfire one tap.

Hello LambOfGord, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/axj4px/what_games_are_like_rainbow_6_siege_on_then_es/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust
---
Hey, I'm primarily a retro gamer as I hate modern games, however, I am halfway interested in rainbow 6 siege but I don't want to play a modern game becauese chances are, rainbow 6 siege is probably really easy and I'll like beat it in a day because its a modern game, what are some ways I can enjoy a rainbow six like experience on the nes? It also needs to be nostalgic

Damn that must‚Äôve been super satisfying

Pew pew pew!

There is the r/r6steams subreddit which has a discord where you can find teams with players of all skill levels. Dm me if you want more information because I know a couple servers and could help you out.

We all know it was a bad map, people just miss it since it was one of the OG maps and people have a lot of great memories messing around on that map

This is my first post I am open to suggestions

The rope probably looked different on his screen. 
---
It doesn't make then wrong. 
---
Like the team reflect damage. Sure, its nice they are doing something.
---
But because damage reflect will require you to TK someone before it actives, players still have a free TK which is the problem right now. Players have a free TK before getting kicked. Squads of TK trolls can still abuse the free TK multiple times.
---
They can still shoot you without killing you too to troll you.

So it hasn't resolved anything. I

I think there should be a karma system. you get 2 updoots and 2 downdoots per game.
---
Depending on your own karma, your doots are worth a certain amount of points. so someone with very low karma has low impact on other peoples karma, while someone with high karma has a higher effect.
---
Dooting the same player has diminishing returns and dooting someone in your squad has reduced or no effect. (this may not be necessary due to the diminishing returns)
---
Why would that guy stand there?!

They said it could not be done

True but it‚Äôs just so annoyinggggg

Im just talking about the maestro crouch spamming and missing every bullet as well as the nomad just running right into him

That‚Äôs so clean I thought this was a real leak at first. Try some other teams your quite talented !

I like how everyone has the dot after Mr but Brick doesn't hahaha.

Thinking back to the Grand Final of the Invitationals when Joystick downed 2 from G2 and lit another one up and they were all back to 50 hp and I believe G2 won that round.

Big oof

Yeah I was confused as well but then read on the website that it starts the 6th and ends in April sometime so all I can hope is that I did everything correctly

Or....just shoot them in the head

could be that your cpu can't keep up.

Beautiful video brings us oldies to tears.

Rip Hereford Base, you will be remembered

Sorry it wasn't ePiC enough

Seriously it is! It took me 30-45 minutes or so (well actually about 4 hours because i always procrastinating looking at memes). Which is why the lineworks really absurd.
---
I like these ideas but before another smoke operator comes, i hope Ubi switches then to serve side because client side smokes are literally rediculous .
---
I've got an i7 6700k. I don't think that would be problem (thank you for the check though.)

I hate the HP update :/

Fake news. She will no longer have an ACOG. This is a biased video. She is fixed.

I remember going into a loading screen for 10 minutes and my friend got kicked for inactivity in the middle of it 
---
Ohh that sounds nice, thanks.
---
While I absolutely adore the idea for the offense op, your defense op is just a different look for Jaeger. Your right, he does have a few balance issues on his gadget, but that needs to be fixed by buffs or nerds rather than a similar-purpose operator.
---
I don‚Äôt find them to that bad anymore since they made them completely opaque, however Smoke‚Äôs (operator) canisters are really annoying for this, sometimes you just get unlucky where you can‚Äôt see a thing but you get killed by someone who sees you clear as day  
---
I think wind bastion is shit. Shit map, OP operators in release etc, etc...
---
Say what you will but there will always be a big fun memory of defending underground in year 1 season 1 ranked.

uBISOFT PLEASE RENAME THE NEW HEREFORD MAP TO SOMETHING ELSE AND GIVE ME MY OLD MAP BACC

Depends on how big of a explosion

Way back when I made an idea for Finnish Ops. Attacker operator with Molotov cocktails. Defender with a iron sight sniper. When an enemy player dies their other team members screen turn white. And something else.

Thank you! Im surpriced i didnt get down voted to hell.

Probably because siege is so toxic now
---
Footballs are client side
---
Yeah you can turn off almost everything on the hud 
---
No difference, click bait is click bait, you can't justify it. 
---
Was watching this with out audio. Many confused
---
ikr i hope they don't nerf them!
---
Oh hell yeah and it does apex!
---
I started in operation health a great first impression
---
i think she's decent, just not OP. 
---
Yh Ik that is what annoys me you can clearly see the difference between MK and high sensitivity.
---
I like to go solo too, but with friends it's just so much better. We just screw around, chat and ~~team kill~~
---
The only thing brutal here is your set up. 2 (possible 3) shields + BB + Glaz? Toxic much
---
To my knowledge, the OG 20 Ops (SAS, FBI SWAT, GIGN, GSG9, Spetsnaz) will all unlock immediately once you get the game these days, as opposed to buying them all like you had to in the past. Then, depending on what edition you bought, you'll have access to the DLC Ops.
---
Yes pls
---
But they dead
---
I do agree on the ping part but the language part is just not a good argument. Everyone can speak the language they want. If you are in US servers and you get a french canadian he cant speak english. I am EU and i get french italians , arabs a lot of things. However the ping issue is there , especially if they quickpeek

Yea for some reason I only got year one (which is the edition I got) andnits making me get the og ops

This is the best one

What cheats on console? Sony/Microsoft would ban you to oblivion and probably sue you for hacking one of their consoles. It just doesn't happen.
---
If you mean Mouse and Keyboard / XIM4 then I'm all with you.
---
I like Bandit's elite 
---
Well actually that's one thing I probably should've mentioned. I have never found Siege to be an overly toxic playerbase. Obviously I've been exposed to teamkillers, trashtalkers and general toxic people, but I've never actually experienced toxicity as bad as people say there is. 
---
I've never played in Diamond, and haven't been Plat for a long while, but I'm usually always in Gold, and people say it's the higher tiers that you find toxic people.
---
Disagree with this, the map design in my opinion was good especially in the basement and I played only a few matches but I got attached and was very happy when I got Hereford since this is where I get my 3 OG Operators kills since of Map Design and tbh I like maps with a Day and Night setting not rain rain rain and rain settings, plus Hereford is just one big abandoned house redesigned for army training. Yes thats realistic but its doesnt capture the Original feeling of being Hereford.
---
I dont care if this gets -12 downvotes or 7 upvotes its just my opinion and my love for a map that I had short amount of time with and Being my 3rd (hell it can be even the first) favorite map of all time.
---
The issue is she‚Äôs decent at low rank as realistically she takes little skill, which means OP at a higher rank. Thermite is an example of someone who takes skill, so does Valk, Mira and castle. At lower rank they may not win you the round as the player might not have the skill to use them right. But at a higher round they could win you the round. Dok only needs you to press a button. You don‚Äôt even have to think about when you press it and I will impact everyone with no downside for your team therefore OP
---
Who would win Neo or Asch?
---
Which, in my opinion, is unfortunate. I always preferred the older demographic of siege. 
---
this isn‚Äôt yours
---
Alright im at school so I gotta go. It was nice talking to ya
---
Jesus Glaz is way out there
---
Thanks all!
---
That's a bit odd. They're not that expensive though and most of the year 1 ops are quite good anyways. Maybe get in touch with Ubisoft about it because that doesn't sound right.
---
Good talk mate!
---
Sounds boring
---
No. 
---
Ubisoft doesn't have servers in many regions, nobody likes playing with 100+ ping either! 
---
  
---
My first thought was Alibi but I could just be dumb
---
It's been changed back again half way through wind bastion. You need to buy the OG ops for the increasing 500-2000 cost again if buy the game now, bit confusing
---
&gt; The issue is she‚Äôs decent at low rank as realistically she takes little skill, which means OP at a higher rank.
---
at low rank, she's not that good, as you need to be able to co-ordinate well to make her work, at least in my experience. as for 'you don't need to have skill/think about when you press it', that's just wrong, you can totally waste both logic bombs and die going for the hack.

Very good job *applause*

LOL this is not taking content it's from a police force..
---
HAHAHAHA. Needed that this morning. Thanks!
---
Yup. That's spot on to the Monty experience. If not that, then a melee through your shield. 
---
The hack is the only thing that you have to think about. So long as your not using it straight away the phone calls can be OP as it literally takes up so much time to either turn it off or bait people. You can totally waste anyone‚Äôs gadgets but Dok is one of the hardest to waste. She had no real counter now she does and that‚Äôs all that matters 
---
I'll try but i'm not hoping muchüòÇ

Where's Tits McGee? On vacation again?

Why cant we get a r/rainbow6_meme? get all of this to that.

Boy I got news for you, Rainbow, Ghost Recon &amp; Splinter Cell have all been sharing the same universe for over a decade, there are multiple direction references in the older games to each other.
---
Well that is true, but if your playing in an english server most people have a basic understanding of it to an extent otherwise why would you play on a server with 200 ping and just ignore every callout and request like you are deaf?
---
We're a little lite this week
---
So true
---
Except people don't pick lion in plat/diamond because it's like breaking the auto ice in csgo.
---
Welp this guy did had him in 3 games in a row, honestly with the ping, language barrier, and his low k/d felt like we were 4 manning.
---
Just waiting for a Puerto Rican operator
---
&gt;You can totally waste anyone‚Äôs gadgets but Dok is one of the hardest to waste.
---
people manage it all the time in my games, but i accept anecdotes are not pure data.
---
&gt;  She had no real counter now she does and that‚Äôs all that matters 
---
that's your opinion, certainly. that doesn't make it objective truth though. i don't agree, and think the community is too keen to follow what pros say, and label things OP rather than just play around them. i feel like we've both said what we need to, so have a great day.

Lesion is a really powerful operator due to his gadget so it wouldn‚Äôt be a big surprise for his nerf

vigil is the better roamer so I would say pick him

I prefer Ela cos her guns and gadgets are better IMO, however if you can‚Äôt handle recoil go for vigil.
---
I totally understand that all of those drawing posts annoy you and giving them a different sub sounds like a good idea, but this is the central R6 sub. It's meant for the community to interact via reddit and not seperate them by Splitting it up in 50 different subs.
---
It's also not a sub that's strictly meant for tutorials and how to get better posts, however I do enjoy reading/writing those. If you want a Sub just for Content related to getting better I'd recommend  r/SiegeAcademy
---
It's a pretty cool sub where you can write but also request guides. You can also ask game related questions which usually get answered in a fairly civil manner.

It was borderline OP so its has been put on ice for now. Its so funny how out of touch Ubi can be sometimes.

It so stupid that it works 
---
Now I am not calling for a buff for shields, especially blitz, but even playing as blitz can be really frustrating when you get shot through your shield completely inconsistently 
---
Well...yeah...I guess, but the barfight in the cinematic was insane.

Ela is great at roaming and has a way better gadget.

Given you saying it wasn't me, first post was later etc, no not really irrelevant in that context.

No, expecting people with an inkling of intelligence to be able to find answers to things themselves. Especially when it's in multiple places for all to see. Guess that's just too much.

Yeah I totally agree with that man. You said you left straight away though as soon as you saw it, which is just something I wouldn't do. I always prefer to look at something fully and then make my evaluations rather than judging a book by it's cover... Might just be me though :)

Wait a sec....That's not an mp7!

It is annoying, but I've been caught enough times with an enemy in the next room, and me having to hold the dang angle with my phone going off because if I try to hang up they're gonna be going through that door and I'm done. So it wouldn't be very often, but I definitely would have used the 18 second hangup once or twice.

ash or iq

Just send in Bobe, it will be fine.

I could‚Äôve easily found the answer on google, I just as easily could‚Äôve found it here so shit the fuck up and cry somewhere else üòÇ

Well I mean... she is a bit too much, she has dmr when in the right hands sprays like an assault rifle, A shotty that has the super 90 range from year 1, 2 amazing secondary‚Äôs, an ability that let‚Äôs your whole team run corners blindly, and of course the best utility in the game smoke grenades, I don‚Äôt think 6 seconds are going to be the make or break of this OP
---
Praise the o Lord
---
I wouldn‚Äôt want that, I often use debris on the ground for intel. They just need to make it server side instead of client side so everyone sees the same.

I understand your point. Is there another place for r6 memes?

Ash has the same hit box as every other female 3 speed op. So yes, or no depending on if you think they‚Äôre all broken.

Did I download reddit? Really?

You haven‚Äôt posted for a year, why you even on this appüòÇ
---
Rewarding players for "not teamkilling" is a horrible idea.
---
Sometimes, a TK is unavoidable, such as a dumbass running directly between you and an enemy during a firefight. One of you is going to kill that idiot, and it becomes 50/50 that it isn't you.
---
Perhaps ironically, it also provides another avenue for people to be toxic to their teammates.
---
If someone is stupid/naive enough to say to their team "I haven't gotten a TK in 99 games, one more and I can finally get a reward! I can't wait to see what I get!" then I will guarantee some dickbag will make sure they get TK'd.
---
"Help!" 
---
Who doesn‚Äôt do this spawn peek 
---
I get what your saying, but at the end of the day both teams can (not should) play any op, so at the end of the day it is balanced. Sure it might not be fun to do it and some may say it ruins the game, but that is just matter of opinion really. Surely a good player will be able to adapt to anything thrown at them instead of moaning about it and saying it's broken and unfair?
---
By the way I'm not accusing anyone of doing that and I believe Lion is not a fun op to have in the game right now. Just saying it from a different point of view :) 
---
Good mindset
---
And i agree! 
---
I was gonna leave it alone but these were some toxic bastards. They were sending shit talking messages before the game even started and running out constantly. I wanted him to know he just got shit on.. lol. I failed...

While console to console would be amazing I at least want console to pc. I hate solo ranked

Hibana is Ghost Recon confirmed?
---
Pengu started posting some of his year 1 competition videos. Can clearly see that it was a much slower game then.
---
Everygame I am in now is hyper fast like that G2 vs APAC team kind of pace where it is just team death match to wipe out opfor in the first minute. Also they all have ungodly aim. I almost never see the shot indicator but just the replay screen. 
---
can you control recoil? Ela
---
If not then Vigil
---
it‚Äôs literally pinned to the front page and you still got it wrong 
---
Either way, Halo is always welcome.
---
In ranked you can almost always guess what site they're on, and you can confirm it by seeing what walls they're reinforcing, so no need to go in site. So your options then is to find a good drone spot where it can act like a static cam for your team, have it at an entry point to drone yourself or someone else in, or bring it back to your spawn point so you can pick it up for later use.
---
If you do encounter someone while droning go still unless you can get it somewhere safe quickly. Noise and movement attract more attention that a drone sitting in plain view a lot of the time.
---
How is demand for more casual content equal younger demographic? This type of shit has been a reddit thing for years. It's poor moderation, ignorance of or lack of availability of the filter (sometimes it just doesn't work tbh) and just seen as more interesting than the Esports/ranked/actual gameplay related stuff.
---
I only stop by here every few weeks, Siege Academy is where you'll find the more serious stuff. But stop blaming younger people for typical behavior, it's a poorly moderated sub.
---
Right now I main buck and switch between kapkan and echo
---
Wow. I thought it was only recruits that used the SASG. Why use that over the 9x19? Im actually suprised since in all of my casual matches, its always the 9x19, 6p41, or the spear.
---
They are both Attackers :)
---
No, its an 870 MCS. The Super Shorty is a specific gun made by Serbu. 
---
The 870 MCS is a special version of the 870 designed for breaching operations for the US Army. It comes as a kit where you can use it in different length configurations, which the one in the game representing the 10‚Äù breacher configuration IRL. 
---
Source: Im one of the few that own an 870 MCS
---
Thank you for explaining that. I feel like a lot of the low skill players do not understand this.
---
The arrow is actually orangered 
---
What is your opinion in joining a match that has already started after someone has left. I sole alot on console and it is extremely annoying because in the match makings current form I get put in way more match that have already started then new games. Why dont they just make it where if you leave a match early next time you que you get put in a match that has already started and someone has left. If I remember Get\_Flanked talked on one of the pod casts with Interro about adding a renown penalty after leaving 5 and if we combine the two it could really help with this mid match quitting. I currently play in console so i have no idea how bad this is on PC. I do feel like console is ten times as toxic as PC. I know Ubi cant control console like they can PC but could a system be installed where a toxic payer could be punished through their Uplay account instead of their PSN account so they are more likely to get punished. This could give Ubi the added control it needs to be able to take care of the console casual toxicity. I love this game and think Ubi has done a great job.
---
IQ is more useful than Ash. Don't @ me. 
---
Yeah, Ela would ban her from her from the Kingdom of Poland for life.  Then she'd relocate all the dingos to the Kingdom of Poland so Gridlock can't punch them anymroe
---
Sorry for the noob question, but what Rook could have done? 
---
Nahh it's just armor penetrating ammo. 
---
Idk man, but where do you redeem that code?
---
My thoughts exactly. I can imagine chanka running out, bipodding on a half wall outside, and being unkillable  in the spawn peek lol
---
Thank heavens. This might be enough to take ranked out of beta.
---
Anything shreds that rifle shield lol
---
RIP 
---
Her shotty still wrecks though
---
The vast majority have no idea, they assume ubisoft is pandering to the best players at their expense and don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs actually beneficial to the games life cycle as a whole 
---
Pre nerf ela
---
 iffy uh blicky got the stiffy uh
---
True
---
She could be ;)
---
Doesn't make her from America though
---
Imbnot a big fan of her secondary weapons but I think her primary are decent
---
And the utility Nerf won't change much outside of the Lion Blitz Dok comp tactic
---
Then strats would be mostly pointless. This game relies on game and map knowledge.
---
You scored more point then the other guy.
---
Yh but it's so rare to happen somebody reinforce for a reason 
---
&gt; Agreed, ops shouldve have some impact on the team comp tho
---
How does she not?
---
This looks so legit. What typography did you use for the title and text?
---
One extra bullet in a game like siege is a big disadvantage
---
Is currently* ;)
---
4x?
---
Fucking pass. Like everyone would be Glaz. 
---
Rip comp
---
Think about it. How long does a casual take? About 20 min. 20 min for 3k exp. How long does a thunt take? About 5 min. We'll say 1.6k exp per thunt. So in 20 min of thunt, you could get 6.4k exp. 
---
Basically you get more than double the exp from thunt for the same time commitment. 
---
Sledge because the video was cool and rook cz I thought his armor plates were op.
---
And ironically the only vanilla op I never played before chimaera was tachanka. 
---
He had double my kills.
---
Gridlock is too easy going to commit to this fight 
---
Check that acog on there
---
In my opinion one of the key features siege has lost is the tactical ness of the game itself, there‚Äôs way to much running around and playing over aggressive. The game is full of whatever team had the better roomers who can get picks, which is still fun if you can roam well or deal with roomers well I just miss the 5 defenders on site in an all out brawl against the 5 attackers trying to find their way on site with weird angles and different defending strats. I liked those days the most and sometimes I wish we could go back.
---
Any tips for someone who feels stuck at a rank/skill level? 
---
You can remove the map in matchmaking settings
---
i have clips of me head shotting the doo doo out of people without getting the kill.. Some days the servers are better than others
---
The one posted before didn't seem like it was posted by the artist though, it had credits to OP
---
You still had more points 
---
Now as much as this would be cool because in theory you never play the same map twice, they can't even detect if mouse and keyboard is being used on console, never mind make a whole algorithm that creates a balanced map. 
---
Wow this is so unrealistic, that is Mavericks gun on Ash.
---
What rank are you?

I like clash because you have to be creative to actually get kills

If they do have the holes in Bathroom, Monty can smoke the holes and drop with his shield extended :) It definitely isn't going to work against top teams, but the majority of players on siege don't play for top teams... We have had a 65/70% win rate when trying it in ranked against plats/diamonds, which I don't think is bad at all for a pocket strat :)
---
But i could see mozzie trying to fight everyone taller than him even if he didnt make it up the bracket
---
&gt; She's just not copetetive enough anymore
---
Pro league teams disagree...
---
Ill work on it
---
Damn is this real game play 
---
It would be EASIER but then that would take the strategy and tactical play of her wouldn‚Äôt it?
---
Like at that point you could just rush in, look up spot Yokai kill it, look down and then kill someone coming through the door.

For your off topic question, I have no clue but I‚Äôll take the 552 any day ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

---
You're behind bro
---
I'm guessing it's because you used the operator art for a referenece
---
There are plenty of thing that give you points that aren't kills. Looks like that guy spent the whole match playing team deathmatch and didn't play the objective as much as you did.

People do sometimes shoot each other at distances exceeding 20 meters, yes.

Around Silver 2-3. I just got back into the game around a month ago after years of not playing.

Blackbeards shield is a pretty huge reward imo. He can still take it off and put it on etc. It doesn't really hinder him.

Gridlock: I wanna fight you and take the throne

---
Ela: You shall bring-eth me all of thou Steak and Lobster, and you shall never return to this Kingdom as long as thou heart beat-eth.
---
Gridlock: You're crossing the line, now.  I challenge you to a duel at sundown in the Town Square
---
Ela: Challenge accepted.  Now run along, my Darling, I must prepare for our bout.
---
*noon in the Town Square*

Ref: May the best dame win

Gridlock: You're fucked now, Miss Bosak

Gridlock: NOOOOO, please, I surrender, just let me go home.  I have two kids!  PLEASE DON'T HURT ME, I'M SORRY YOUR MAJESTY.  HERE, TAKE MY STEAK AND LOBSTER.  I'm sorry, please don't execute me.

That's asking for a bullet

That riot logo is straight up stolen

no Idea, I never played overwatch. But karmasystems aren't really a new concept.
---
This would be a good bit different than that. Also I think the fact that you can bust down walls and hatches would make this lend better to R6 than CSGO.
---
Or you ping a wall and ask people to move away so you can blow a hole and they start reinforcing
---
Hang on, the twitter account says its the overall game size, not the patch size?
---
Either that or because it's her final form.

after using the fbi Shotgun you knida deserve it

Yeah but like end of a match you get say 3 rewards you can pick players and if you gey alot of commisions you get rewards like an xp or renown booster just in your next match or something like that.

Elite Bandit is already leaked so... Bandit
---
that's bad ass.  moves slower than a siege drone though and apparently cant jump.  camera is blurry too.  i think the drones in r6 should be nerfed camera wise. you get perfect in-game quality like as if you're really there. when in reality a drone wouldn't be so perfect.

You know, as much as Id love that, I got that dad skin from summer packs, so I'd probably keep that on.

I love that thing, man, for some unknown reason

In what way is it broken? There are characters with smaller hitboxes than her but they're just fine.

You're missing his entire point, losing an ACOG isn't a positive change, it's a negative one. Hence why he's saying it's ironic

Everyone is right, but the best way to say it is:

they changed the camera placement, thus forcing the character model to expose more of the hitbox when leaning around a corner.

Where can you find this trailer? Couldnt find it anywhere.

U only reinforce rooms you plan to defend from inside, which is clearly not the case here, your walls will protect attackers

h1z1 feedback was

---
- no!, changes on the map
---
- of course, here you got new crates

- ffs
---
- buy the new ffs skin for only 25‚Ç¨!
---
You said never used, but thats not true :D. 
---
Didn't they say a while back that we did something and patches will be a lot smaller in size?
---
This is like downloading the entirety of GTAV! 
---
I like when shooting feels fast and twitch, and don‚Äôt want to not hit someone because the barrel of my gun barely hit a counter im standing behind. It makes for much more akward fights. I think you are confused, just because something is ‚Äútactical‚Äù doesnt mean its more ‚Äúskillful‚Äù or fun to play.
---
ACOG is 2.5x
---
ACOGs in real life are typically 4x though.
---
Yeah I just play with my two brothers on pc. No one else is as encouraging when I‚Äôm clutching or forgiving when I fuck up, plus we all get psyched when one of us does something cool 
---
Seriously?
---
I agree that echo has misconceptions he doesn't need a nerf, and if Devs where to they would probably give him a set amount of sonics at 2-3 which would ruin his playstyle
---
To get people to buy it early

I just look it up on the wiki. It‚Äôs definitely 4x

Nope. Y4S2

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm getting so messed up. I‚Äôm thinking logically in a game with a .50 cal AR 15 DMR

It seems everybody love Dokkaebi since Six Invitational, can't argue that, I like her more now too.

Do you know if kontrol freaks will fit the controller

Yep! We ended up winning anyways and left it at that. They were an extremely toxic team to play against and I threw away a round trying to let them know they weren‚Äôt hot shit like they though. After that we regrouped and broke their spirits the old fashion way. I can‚Äôt stand toxicity and I didn‚Äôt really think this was too bad. More celebration than anything. Lol. Like I‚Äôve said several times at least I tried to do it right away rather than running around. Putting on room armor. Using my drone for a selfie... putting a claymore by him. Teabagging him. Just wanted to kill it with fire. 
---
Minor oof. :)

Crouch with Spacebar.   Grenades on right click , Ads on thumb mouse button.   If that is weird?

On pc, it should be on the sidebar under where you would click to make new post. I believe it's under community feature and it's called flair

It‚Äôs only cause of bb shield. It would be shot if he didn‚Äôt have a face shield

Castle is garbage and only hinders your team unless you have the entire team utilizing a solid strat (which means high plat to pro level scrims). He's situational as hell.
---
Comment of the year lmao
---
As someone who isn‚Äôt religious... wtf is Ash Wednesday

If Montagne is not very good, you could try to run around him and shoot/melee him to back. Not gonna happen against good players, though.

nice game

But we don‚Äôt know for sure how many times I hit his head because it was behind the wall. 
---
*wink-wonk*

I just run a basic controller with a low-profile grip on the right stick.  Never run into a problem,  so that's my basis. I get my bias from cod

The EXACT same thing happened to me two seasons ago. Has 3299 and lost, went back to 3998 and lost again. It really is an F.

Imagine hunting vigil and pulse with the 552 commando with a tracker

I played a lot of Bandit and Jager right before they lost the acog, but I exclusively used the M870 instead of the other primaries
---
LmaoüòÇ
---
Plus so many people use mouse and keyboard on console now might as well get an edge too
---
Yes and it‚Äôs a good one. Resets are a waste of time and boring. If you were genuinely downed and a teammate was able to revive you, then you‚Äôre basically getting a second life. You don‚Äôt also need 50hp. Also the designers have a far bette understanding if the game then any of us on this sub. When they make changes there‚Äôs a lot more process put into it than the average reddit idea. 
---
All 5 teammates casteled inside the objective waiting for the enemies
---
This Is Awesome GOOD JUB!!!!!!

Haha you can know the game and play Blackbeard. It‚Äôs no different than playing with ash‚Äôs broken ass hit box. LeArN tHe GaMe

You can shoot the trap mid-vault.

Yes, but when customizing the controller you need to order regular ps4 sticks.

Where‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favorite undersea news caster, Perch Perkins?

ez
---
I think you should be one shot unpin getting revived. You‚Äôve already taken over 100 damage. Why should you get anymore than that. It should be revived players job to play smarter knowing you can‚Äôt just take every fight. 
---
Lmao that's what I was thinking
---
r/substhatdontexist
---
The shooting can still feel fast and twitch with bullet coming out of the barrel, you just couldn't shoot someone around the corner while you only exposed your cap on the head.
---
I didn't say tactical = skill, tactics are just one aspect of the game.
---
To me, pixel peeking is like lean/crouch spam, both are abusing the gameplay mechanics and both can be fixed (the latter is fixed).

I think I might start on S2 then. Thanks man!

How many times do you have to tmk to get this long
---
Just waiting for it

6
---
Neither

It was just commonly interpreted that way for some reason, but the way they revealed it was that you know ahead of time so you can pick appropriate defenders for the site. 
---
agreed
---
damn, looks like i'll be playing the game after a few days it releases then
---
Nah.  it should take away half of someone‚Äôs health for reinforcing kids bedroom. 
---
Retake strats are almost always way too risky. Especially retakes on Oregon are nearly impossible because there aren't many ways to get to the site.  
---
Lol why does she have an acog?
---
Oh no! Her chest and shoulder are showing! 
---
That's a real man right there. 
---
wow this is really realistic, I actually thought it was a legit leak
---
Well plat and diamond players would disagree with you once again. Her pickrate for Y3S4 was under 20% and her win delta was ~+0.25%.
---
So even without a ban phase, meaning even if echo (21% pick rate), Valk (32% pick rate), and lesion (47% pick rate) are going to make it through all the time, she shows up in less than 1 out of every 5 matches.  This compared to Ashe who has an over 70% pick rate in Y3S4 and a win delta of around 1% (which is 4 times better than IQ's)
---
[Source](https://i.redd.it/7gafchmywbc21.jpg)
---
It's fine to have an opinion that you like playing her. But "I like playing her" is not a valid, factual argument.
---
This is probably a very stupid question, but why do people not reinforce kids bedroom? I don‚Äôt play much, so I‚Äôm expecting to get tons of downvoted, but oh well.
---
i do it for the meme
---
This‚Äôll probably get taken down 
---
I like this babies frist animation 
---
For the record they are trying to reduce the game size on all the platforms. Down to around 40 GB on consoles I believe 
---
Yep. The fact OP's post received this many upvotes is further proof this sub is mostly occupied by the worst players to get feedback from. Every good player recognizes when things are broken or frustrating but all the shitty copper copper donut droppers hate seeing a crutch ability/operator nerfed or are actually so low skilled it flies over their heads entirely

I think you're missing the fact that after the patch the overall game size will decrease by 24% (79 &gt; down to 60).

this has been posted hundreds of times before. you didn‚Äôt make this

Talking shit about lack of skill but mains Montagne? Riiight...
---
someone asks this question everytime this is posted, and I wonder why people don't start making these graphs correctly. The reason you're seeing "skewed" data is because the rank doesn't matter, it's just a show for your MMR which is what actually matters. The data is supposedly skewed because some of these ranks have a larger range of MMR. These graphs should be showing the range of MMR, but are instead misleading.

Once when i was learning to play the game a teammate started screaming at me to put down my

On Xbox I was platinum 2, on PS4 I was a platinum 3 and on Pc I‚Äôm a gold one. I don‚Äôt play cod cause I don‚Äôt like cod l, I‚Äôve been playing siege since launch and own it on all three platforms. When the new team kill mechanics come out you‚Äôre going to have lots of fun. You probably team kill people too when they use your Mira‚Äôs and probably team kill people if they use your drone or black eye cameras. If you want to play a game that doesn‚Äôt require teamwork and it‚Äôs all about getting kills, you go play cod.

THIS IS SO PRETTY.
---
I bought it during a steam sale when it was cheaper there than on uplay
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean shit in casual lol 
---
Finally, a strong Genetically enhanced woman! (Looks great, can't wait to see the rest!)
---
front page
---
It really is awful. There has to be some kind of punishment for it besides the 30 minute ban if you do it too much. I know that TTK doesn't change if you're shooting a teammate or an enemy but I've only been accidentally TK'd or accidentally TK'd like three times in my time playing this game. It seems so normal to play a game or two a day that is either a free win or loss because people just shotgun each other in the face on spawn. 
---
There should also be a punishment for leaving a casual game. Tons of people only want to play casual and having a 3v5 for 2 rounds sucks.
---
Once again I‚Äôm not copper, just had a bad game lol
---
Why did this get down voted so much?
---
Perfect 
---
Send this to Ubisoft I think this could be a really good season
---
Lol exactly 
---
Yeah I noticed there weren't any finka cosplayers  and I like a challenge so Finka is my babe and Gridlock is next.
---
Maybe he got downed?
---
The only cake day comment that was somewhat interesting and it got downvoted. Oh the irony.
---
Oh... 
---
I still have a beta account with only ash,rook and lion
---
Nice!  Thanks!
---
LOL!  You're probably right!
---
hey man, thanks for the reply but it's not that. I know rubber banding and the differnce and my latency is tiny. Its 250mb/s. It's just annoying at this point. I love my xbox for every game but this version of rainbow is so far, between the sound bugs and the the glitching is way inferior to that of the PS. Feels like a different game.
---
I regret not playing this game before Wind Bastion because now it's like impossible to get that skin and it's one of the few I really want in the game.
---
I'm on console, not much i can do about it lmao
---
what I don't get about the scavenger op is what could possibly be the ability that makes it so he can pick up another gun? like why can this dude bend over and pick up something off the ground but no other op can? 
---
maybe they could add a little story like every op's weapon is locked to them via biometric authorization and this guy can somehow bypass it? 
---
also I think it'd be better if he was a defender who could take attacker weapons only. that way there's no TK'ing plus he gets a better overall weapon most of the time
---
Accidental teamkills happen, maybe change it to something like less than X-amount of teamkills in Y-amount of games
---
Or reinforcing next to a Mira
---
That‚Äôs certainly some weird binds XD
---
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
---
i‚Äôve wanted to try this out but i never play hostage or get the chanceüòÇ 
---
Thanks a lot for your help! Guess I need to upgrade it then
---
Yep. It‚Äôs not complicated. Actually, it apparently is for some &lt;3
---
You are my 'BRUH" BILLYBOOB8 this is the internet i call you how i see you! And I have Aced, and I can watch windows. 
---
   
---
[exhibit A)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL-sEN8xd50&amp;feature=youtu.be) Ace on why Kanal.  I do this to warm up for ranked and get my twitch reaction down. Literally getting the call on where they are from clash from spawn peeking another angle and all 5 still outside coming from spawn...  
---
Yeah every game has flaws, but having these maps back in Ranked would be the biggest flaw. 
---
Can I guess your favorite map is Barlett Uni. 
---
First, yes it is petty to have a sniper on attack that can shoot through airplane windows when no one on defense can have any opportunity to fight back. that is petty crap. Just like lean spam and crouch spam. when there is no way to defend yourself I call that petty. 
---
Second, i don't care if it is one side. the replay value of the other maps are ten time greater than casual maps. regardless of Hereford or Fortress being ASS. I still find value into playing those maps over than playing House for the billionth time. It is so stale of gameplay that is it a meme at this point. And the devs have already said they wont rework it.  
---
third, and yes they can be fixed. and they are if you paid attention Kanal, Oregon and Meme park are getting reworked this year. Lmao, "BROMIGO" if you wanted the casual maps to be in ranked you should have played at the beginning of the game and figured out that they were ass then and are ass now.  Go play CoD or casual Man. No one is forcing you to play ranked. and you get pissed off to the small map pool. Ill say it again after reading all your other post everyone in this thread wants the ROAD TO SI map pool. 
---
 Im sorry you dont watch pro-league, but the strats everyone watches (arent from their fav twitch streamers) it is actually people trying to better their game and play the game how it is suppose to be played and learning from the best in the game. Plus, if you even paid attention to the Six Invitational you would have learned something new from Valk cam placement to Maestro cams. to where hide drones to catch people off guard. There is a lot more to the game then you wanting to play House every map.  But good day to you sir. and have fun being a casual try hard.
---
In short, yes. The total size will vary slightly depending on your platform, but they will all be much smaller. 
---
I'm Brazilian, and I'm still learning English :P
---
I remember that tachanka was the first defender I bought thinking that A powerful LMG with a shield would be very good.
---
Hello BorkoY, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/axpp2p/ryzen_2600_gtx_1080_freeze_and_crash_with_no/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

*Yaaaassss!* can't wait to see the finished product.
---
Not exactly. Having higher ping gives you the advantage when you're peaking angles.
---
plus he‚Äôs got a C H U N K Y body hitbox 
---
Gameplay wise they‚Äôre the same height. Canonically, they‚Äôre their bio‚Äôs height.
---
it's not
---
they're all good but Lion is my personal fave, and i'd pick him
---
Verify files if you're on PC. Reinstall if you're on Console.
---
This is absolutely fucking amazing
---
Talking doesn't necessarily mean you're using strats. 
---
If he's not a terrible operator, why is his win Delta in plat+ consistently so low?
---
Unless you're specifically funneling attackers towards certain points in the map, you're much more likely to be cutting your defense into pieces which is an abysmal effect to have on a team. He's a liability in the vast majority of the matches in which he's played and his stats reflect that.
---
No amount of downvotes are gonna change that fact.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs almost impossible to kill them unless you headshot them or them miss their shots and you hit them.
---
That's true for any Op though. And I think only overhealing to 120 wouldn't be good enough, because then the overheal would only be useable if you're at 80 or below and that's not really what the overheal is meant to be used for.
---
So much jitter.
---
Looked more like 6 feet on that Rook.
---
Thanks!
---
Mid gold. 1.2 KD. I solo queue and don't really consider myself a fragger, more support. 
---
This happened to me too! I just started the game and already had a Defender challenge completed lol
---
Rogue9 is very detailed in damage per weapon and tactics.
---
you still boosting, doesn't matter, your stats support this claim by the fact that you been silver 3, gold 2, gold 2, then hit plat 3, a plat game (at least what i consider to be a plat game) is a game with the range of plat 3s to diamonds, when you have a gold 4, is just called a gold game, since you are plat 3 and the lowest is gold 4, or just a boost game in your case since that's what **^(y o u)** are doing
---
this is true, it is amazing
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
basically saying the room's name where the enemy was spotted 
---
it's called the tryhard resolution (4:3) 
---
Ah I see
---
Oh I would‚Äôve been so mad
---
Sounds like a win! Looks like I‚Äôm going to learn how to control that recoil
---
Nope, powerline adaptor.

Hello fmorris245, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/axqmk8/who_is_the_best_operator_for_a_beginner_player/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I was thinking about getting him, but he's getting nerfed soon.
---
Not to mention that they completely ignore the state of casual despite acknowledging that it's a terrible way to both play and learn the game. The funny part is that they acknowledges that it's a terrible way to learn the game, then a month later put Favela back in casual's map pool. So not only do they ignore it despite knowing its flaws, they make it worse even though they're aware of its flaws. 
---
That explains it, you're probably not going against very good players in mid gold. (not saying all mid gold players are bad)
---
(:
---
Villa is incredibly balanced. This post just reeks the salty tears of someone who went 0-4 in Ranked.
---
Rank distribution looks very staggered, making it look like there is necessity for change. From what I recall, ELO distribution is what they focus on and that follows a normal distribution.
---
Thanks sounds good man! 
---
Everytime they try people here get upset because they "accidentally" get punished for team killing. 
---
According to the wiki he's 162 (5'4")
---
u/vreddit_bot
---
It's actually good tho...
---
they are playing ash...soooooo
---
Definitely worth a shot. It's very hard at first, but now I can even manage it very well on console. Also, I'm not discrediting the shotgun either. That thing kicks ass too
---
but it was a mistake :(
---
no honestly I didn't expect he'd die üòÖ
---
I can confirm this. On PS4 
---
All Frost needs is impact grenades instead of her bulletproof camera they also need their color changed and to be made to look like a bear trap like her elite uniform has the teeth on them.
---
When we attack we Pick shields
---
Best on the game is all players is random 
---
Her LMG is fucking scary though
---
Austrian operators would be leeeegendary. There are so many excellent special forces in austria like the cobra, jagdkommando or WEGA

It does it some scenarios, but most of the time its casual; so who cares
---
It was super funny to watch, that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever seen anything like that happen lol
---
Is it fine that I rarely use my mic? 
---
I say we give her Blitz's old helmet 
---
Local man angry opponents are better than him
---
Kaid is fine right now. 
---
* The scope on his .44 Mag makes him (and Nomad) unique. It's fair and balanced ever since the damage and recoil got nerfed.
---
* Bad idea, we already had Kaid and Nomad with high-damage, and it was awful.
---
* Why? Barbed wire works better with his kit.
---
It doesn't matter, their bios just say their real height, so there's a wide range in the game.
---
Yeah she is. She's seldom used and not very effective because if your team just uses drones correctly then shes useless
---
What kind of question is this? 
---
I'm just tryna post some funny clips üò•
---
Wow its looks awsome just one thing, add zibal as iraninan ops for e.g you can add him in nohed 65th Airborne Special Forces Brigade and for the guns you can add kh2002

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-2002?wprov=sfla1
---
Or fateh as assult rifle
---
http://www.military-today.com/firearms/fateh.htm

And you can add a h&amp;k mp5 to the weapons list .

Keep up the good work üòÅ

Is it a mistake or what?

#ROUND 1 DRAW
---
Lol I am 12 and 5'6
---
Because there is a good half the subreddit that wants her to sit on their face
---
IQ's Aug, and you get it for beating the Bartlett U mission.
---
I don't even know where that is
---
Hey man can you blame them 
---
First Op is good, Zibal is a big no no, but the map rework idea, operator buffs and general aesthetic is fucken top notch.
---
Well shit. I want to platinum the game and I need a breach charge kill. I'd better get on it
---
I'm also curious
---
I've played against plenty of plats/diamonds in casual. I never once thought 'oh he only won that gunfight because of his mouse and keyboard'
---
Hmmm maybe if you read comments better then you‚Äôd understand that he claimed it was the ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù trailer not a free weekend trailer lmao. In the video where‚Äôs dokkaebi and vigil?

That‚Äôs not entirely true. Bungie said that lions rework, not necessarily a nerf, is coming out first half of year 4. So it could be anytime between tomorrow and season 3. It‚Äôs probably a good bet on getting lion.

I love the Alibi rework here

Don‚Äôt get dokkebi 
---
Cool beans
---
No comment: I'm one of those bitches :(
---
Same xD
---
I don't think they can implement it to a point where it works smoothly. 
---
yeah, and then get one teammate to run out on all the attackers at the windows. Ace strat.
---
A little yes
---
Underrated comment 
---
Thats not the reason why you reinforce that wall, you reinforce wall because if they gain control of consul windows they can cut off rotation by blowing that wall.
---
google branch davidian
---
Very, Ubisoft is inspired by cults a lot, for example; far cry 5
---
On attack: fast, aggressive, always shoot through hatches.
---
On defense: I only anchor because I'm too scared to roam.
---
The first round I played I got 3 kills on defend and won it. Then proceeded to get the shit kicked out me every round after that. We won though so that was cool.
---
Just a tad late, but it's still really cool to know. That fact alone makes Oregon one of my favorite maps.
---
Oh okay, thanks, I'll hope for the best
---
Fuck that guy who said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you get for being Monty and not full extending‚Äù
---
Condescending asshole.
---
Anyone who willingly picks Monty shouldn‚Äôt be expected to clutch and then ridiculed for dying. Y‚Äôall Monty mains deserve praise.
---
How tall is he?
---
Oh? I was just thinking of her because I want to be useful to my team comp in ranked and my friends say she has the best dmr in the game
---
I totally get what you mean about the restrictive feeling, it just doesn't feel like you can walk anywhere. Not to mention getting to the top floor is suicide from any of the three staircases because all 3 can be watched without you have an equal opportunity to fire back. I feel like yellow stairs on consulate is an example of stairs feeling fair to go up or watch, the skighlight is a little annoying but otherwise it is a good staircase.
---
TL;DR A fanatical cult and their "charismatic" leader were doing all sorts of weird and illegal shit, the FBI came to raid, and they weren't having it, so the FBI burned the place down with women and children inside.
---
&gt; I do this to warm up for ranked and get my twitch reaction down.
---
lol could you tryhard more please?
---
Variety makes the game more fun. I don't want to play the same stale maps over and over especially when half of them are DLC garbage.
---
&gt;Plus, if you even paid attention to the Six Invitational you would have learned something new from Valk cam placement to Maestro cams. to where hide drones to catch people off guard. There is a lot more to the game then you wanting to play House every map. But good day to you sir. and have fun being a casual try hard.
---
lol is this modern state of gaming? Im going to guess you are either a teenager or fresh into college. Literally who watches pro league? You are just further proving my point that you watch pro league and copy their pro strats. You aren't pro and you never will be so get that shit out of ranked. 
---
But I wanted to be a squash.
---
In this case, consider Buck. If you have decent recoil control, Buck is amazing with a Holo.
---
Do I have to aim lower to get a headshot?
---
Always good to win!
---
Probably not 
---
It doesn't matter, its a just a joke
---
Defender w/ a monty shield? Heck no
---
Also, really don't think Alibi needs a nerf. 3 speed, good gun, impacts, and a baller pistol are good enough
---
Actually middle East isn't very good place Ubisoft want choose operater.
---
Oklahoman operator that wears a boonie hat/bucket hat and shades. 
---
Name: Twister. 
---
Gadget/Ability: a "bouncing betty"-esque mine that flies up and spins (hence the "Twister" name), sending out sharp needles that can spot enemies and reveal their location (perhaps until needle is removed?) . 
---
Weapons: AR-SMG (Think AR-15 chambered in 9mm), 12g. Hunting shotgun. 
---
Secondary: Colt 1911. 
---
Elite Skin: Storm Chaser (Idk, have some storm clouds roll in on the endgame screen and lightning strike when the camera zooms in on his face, kinda like how it zooms for Ash.). The guy can dress in some random ass civvie clothes.... "Hawaiian Tourist" flower shorts with a khaki shirt or something. Just have him sitting there smirking. Bonus points for including a twig in his mouth.
---
Name could be something like Chase Smith. Background? Came from a small town, joined the 75th Rangers, excelled in training, approached by both Delta and Rainbow, went with Rainbow to "get off the farm" and see the world. Personality? Mozzie-like quirkiness at times, but ice-cold demeanor at other times.
---
Notes: Despite outward sociability, Twister seems to prefer keeping to himself, not wanting to inconvenience anyone. Being a younger member of the team, he seems to have expressed feelings of being "outclassed" to fellow operators Kaid, Glaz, and (of all people!) Caveira (Oddly enough, Cav seems to enjoy the guy, and treats him like a little brother. Meanwhile Kaid seems to have taken a "grandfather" role for the kid.). While an excellent operator in his own right, Glaz has informed Six that Twister holds deep self-confidence issues. When pressed for answers, Glaz simply said it's a long story, and best not to bring it up around the new addition to the team.
---
It's the typical crowd of people that think overinterpreting a joke makes them smart.
---
she looks depressed
---
&gt;There should also be a punishment for leaving a casual game.
---
I dont agree with that. I only play casual, and part of that is because I can leave when I get those toxic teammates that TK and dont want to play seriously. In a ranked game I can be stuck playing up to 9 rounds with toxic teammates.
---
But I just explained how it isn't ok.
---
All the toxicity issues from team killing are caused by the free team kill. 
---
Which is partially resolved if everyone has the option to kick somebody if they TK them.
---
If I were to run a red light, even by accident, I should still be punished. 
---
Similarly, even an accidental team kill should still be punished BUT it should be up to the victim to determine if you deserve said punishment.
---
btw i have a 21:9 aspect ratio running in 4:3.....you guys just dont have wide screen monitors so it probably looks super weird ALSO he cant go DBNO when he is the last guy alive. its not zofia.
---
c i yell at my team
---
Attached to the FBI. The ATF still had agents on sight when the FBI HRT was involved. The FBI just took lead when things escalated. And escalated they did. 
---
Butthurt
---
The issue is that her 18 second call was about the same as infinite.  No one is going to wait a full 18 seconds without doing anything, they're either going to turn it off or be fighting, meaning that the nerf wouldn't have any of the impact they intended.  12 seconds is a good balance between the risk of having the phone on and the risk of turning it off.
---
Her "mindgames" was her being rewarded with the audio equivalent of wallhacks for no effort or risk whatsoever.
---
Claymore on glaz=best loadout
---
Check my previous comment. Made up a farm kid.
---
How do you draw the reflection on her glasses so well?
---
And your opponent was playing on a track pad
---
TK should be turned off at the start of seasons 
---
No
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll grind some more tonight üòÖ
---
Whats with the x, x
---
As a small warning, I listened to whole thing live, and is good stuff, but if you want a definitive answer or a tease on any topic, you will be disappointed.
---
I will never feel sad for an accidental latch drop again..
---
Lmao I‚Äôm still in the fetus and already 8‚Äô3
---
I played it on N64 because I found a copy of it, though not sure I'd recommend that as the preferred console to play it on. 
---
I feel personally attacked. 
---
Hell yeah
---
Sorry bud. The shanannigans is at an all time high. 
---
You have to choose if you use vertical or horizontal.
---
What an existential question
---
Yep. This one was very inconvenient lol. 
---
I have an SSD, but alt-tab a lot so I still hold up games :/
---
People complaining about like 20 seconds of waiting are really annoying though
---
Since the multiplayer exists in a virtual reality simulation, as a training program, as I believe was mentioned in the book, it‚Äôs my headcanon that Mozzie hacked the simulation to make his avatar the same size as the rest because he‚Äôs totally insecure about his height
---
Whats ur gamertag?
---
Thats why only the owner they bought it can play it. This way no smurfing to be a jerk.  I was in games 2 days ago where the enemy team was bad on tk. If banned 2 times 2 week ban on start of the new season. Lets see how this works for now. Hope it stops some.
---
Plausible.
---
Isn‚Äôt he a 2 speed rn?
---
Yupp. Blizzard launcher downloads most of the files and hangs on to them until patch day.
---
It‚Äôs mostly a British thing. It just means a kiss 
---
Zibal is a attacker, not a defender
---
Alibi is getting a buff not a nerf
---
Yeah but couldn't they just stalk you around prep phase and still tk you? 
---
Good luck 
---
It's all good I guess 
---
The more you know
---
Someone give this man gold hahaha
---
Everyone thinks it was the Germans who sank the Lusitania.... Dimwitted fucks never expected the Mermans though.
---
You can be banned for just playing in matches with hackers can't you?
---
I have a better idea, make him 1 speed again.
---
You have to be queued with em, repeatedly
---
I mean it makes sense. Those who play regularly have no issue with getting those numbers. Year i almost have 2000 hours and always have enough. Just havent felt like the season pass is worth it. Now if I was new id be pissed and buy the pack that unlocks all. 
---
Haha well, you are hilarious and my salary think so too. you are to cute. enjoy your tuesday man hope you dont get diabetes sitting in front of your monitor eating cupcakes, bitching and complaining.. Lol, nah man in my eyes you are just a scrub. I am glad they down voted you because you are stupidest person i have meet and have no idea what you are talking about any more. You are the type that wanted barlett u to be a map.   
---
I will assume what ever I want BillyBruhBoobHead. Cause your asinine comments make me assume.  Hope to catch you on kanal in ranked one day HAHAHA. 
---
Isn't that zironic
---
Listen, I know *you* might be into safe spaces, but making what is obviously a joke and then immediately after saying "OH PLZNO OFFEND!" just kills it.
---
Shout out Sean ranklin
---
In Siege they ruin the entire game for you. In Overwatch they send you messages. Woooow. 
---
There is currently a buffer in place to account for accidental TKs, you can TK 1 time in a match and not face a penalty. Accidents happen.
---
With the change, you'll now enter a special sanctioned status after that 1st TK, so now you won't even be able to damage your teammates, let alone TK another person. So there will still be a buffer for accidents, but now that 1st TK is not completely "free".
---
It's not a perfect, fix-all solution for toxicity but it is the next step that the team is implementing in the process. 
---
I imagine a Russian FSB officer or Spetsnaz Commander in the early 2000's going over the game plan for Moscow Theater or Beslan School and saying, "Let me show you few tricks I learned from the Americans."
---
I run in to a gamer girl every 15 matches or so and everyone in my games talk so they seem rare to me. Also they probably consider female mobile gamers ‚Äúgamer girls‚Äù
