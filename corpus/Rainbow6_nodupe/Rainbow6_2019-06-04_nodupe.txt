Nokk's interesting, but I'm not sure she's useful outside of being Spooky Bitch 2.0 or fucking over the enemy Maestro, or when you're like me and an FMG-9 + D'Eagle is your dream loadout in R6S, and Warden is too situational, even if he is a really neat idea.
---
---
---
How
---
Just don‚Äôt miss them 1 taps alright? :D
---
comment before you piss me the fuck off I'm warning ya'll
---
Greed I love that skin
---
Cavi with auto pistol? No definitely not :)
---
Thanks, first round into the CASUAL game I was put into the other team went Doki, lion and Jackal, so that was fun
---
I def recommend mozzie. I'm an intel slut and like to know where everyone is at what time. wallbangs make me so happy. His drone steal ability might not seem like much at first, but it is a HUGE help later. Its echo but with three cams, no blur and sneaky tech. Not to mention he has The commando which has a large mag, little recoil and angled grip, sidearm shotgun for close quarters combat (I call it the shotfun) and last but not least a nitro cell which is a definite must have when using drones.
---
It‚Äôs *CASUAL*, never expect anything from non ranked modes..

That Reflex on BUCKS rifle is better than ACOG &amp; HOLOGRAPHIC.

We won the game actually lol But do to me being so hyped I forgot to record the last bit of the matchü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I've had a handful of times I've been so sick I couldnt even sit in my chair for more than 30 minutes to play, now if I'm sick and I play anything its presumed im not all that sick lol
---
Your profile is full of asking for upvotes...
---
[removed]
---
I know but I‚Äôm just trying to get Mozzie
---
Pulse is more fitting for the role, but J√§ger can do the job too. 
---
Bandit for me is important when it comes to the ‚Äúbandit trick‚Äù therefore he might stay in objective often. I usually move a little away from the objective but not enough for a *roamer*.
---
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! IT‚ÄôS UNFAIR!
---
im ashamed to say but i completely agree
---
still, this is a cooperative game I should have teammates no matter what.
---
Grind it like a true siege player

Should you still have any unanswered question, [let the moderation team know](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRainbow6 "Click here to compose a modmail message") so they can improve the guide for future buyers.
---
you should buy it again, but probably on a discounted price since you owned it already. Maybe like a 50% off
---
What are you looking for exactly? Like a logo or operators..?
---
Yes sir
---
Holographic on Yings gun. Too much kick with acog the holo provides perfect flicking/close quarters fighting
---
A logo pretty much
---
Flexin‚Äô my MP7 black ice on Bandit ^_^
---
I know no one asked but I like this discussion so forgive me for also adding my opinions. 
---
I like Sledge's and Bandit's for how they look. I love Thatcher normally but I don't like how his Elite looks, but that's just me. Valkyrie is cool, but Mute's is definitely my fav animation with Jaeger's at second.
---
Literally send me a PNG of a bullet flying past you in siege. The white line is the smoke trail, you cant see physical bullets in Siege lmao
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, bullets do not make a noise flying past you with a suppressor, feel free to hop in a custom match with a friend and have him shoot near you from a range with a suppressed weapon.
---
I‚Äôm new at siege and i didn‚Äôt know you could buy operators with gold
---
Competitive games are always full of toxicity, look at Overwatch and CSGO. People leave mid-game and even teamkill you..
---
It looks freaking awesome but when equipped and playing with it it looks like a pretty typical white skin tbh. Still this it's cool tho
---
I dont get it? 2 Kills in Casual? Am i missing anything
---
Just curious, why?
---
I agree on this, holo and reflex works 200x better
---
yeah true.. I just wish I had friends who play casually. Every Friend of mine is toxic unfortunately.
---
The map is also hideous.
---
Pictures taken seconds before disaster
---
Are you on console or PC? If console, I totally understand because comms were always horrible because everyone was in their own parties. But if you‚Äôre on PC, randoms generally have mics and will communicate enough to make it playable. I‚Äôm in the upper gold/low plat range on PC, and every game I have at least one person with a mic and often times full teams with mics. I solo queue 90% of the time and I have a great time with the game still.
---
Personally for me Jaeger is the best roamer good gun. Has a passive ability and good secondary if you run out of ammo in your primary
---
Pulse is getting a good buff where the time between dropping your sensor to your gun is reduced so it makes a viable choice for roaming. 
---
Bandit to me is a great lurker you can bandit trick and then when your successful/unsuccessful you can lurk around obj and pick people off. But he‚Äôs also solid on roam
---
lol
---
Not a bad idea, but I think the easiest fix is if Caviera downs someone, which isn‚Äôt hard to detect, if they DC while down it automatically triggers the interrogation.
---
Finally, someone who does not use holo sight on shotgun
---
Played against the Thot 3 stack before and as expected they play recruit. 
---
I'm wondering what the hell poor kapkan did to deserve losing a toe.
---
Spawnpeeking is literally part of the game. But funny clip
---
It would be "lil' friend" like Scarface M4. He will use this gadget and say " SAY GOODBYE UR HOSTAGE"
---
doesnt everyones?
---
Because somebody wanted to
---
I like playing the game, but I‚Äôm not good at it :p
---
Yeah suuuuuure buddy. That‚Äôs the whole story.
---
I ran into a guy with the name ‚ÄúCircumsizedEmu‚Äù
---
Yes, I know, just a bit of fun. Was too tempting to pass up knowing he was screwed on the balcony üòÇ
---
I have it for fuzes LMG as well as the MP5... got a duplicate black ice for the LMG last night. I swore pretty loud at that!
---
Am I The only one that barely has this happen to him, and when it does it‚Äôs whatever, because I just break the window
---
People underestimate the 'Chanka.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen 2-3 people  rush the tunnel on Oregon and run right into a chanka who was waiting with a cheeky murder hole turret.
---
What do you mean everyone's ping was up to 2000 and i couldnt reconect to my ranked match an i just lost 40 elo
---
That reaction time at stairwell though....
---
Too bad you can't upload to onedrive and theirs no website for it on ps4 :/
---
Thanks
---
I'm already like you
---
It‚Äôs balanced though. It‚Äôd be a lot harder to balance a lot of scopes
---
Yea I believe I have a few clips of it happening in one it showed the grenade get tossed on my screen, in another I released the button but the grenade wouldn‚Äôt leave my hand no matter what button I pressed and it blew up killing me and a teammate
---
now hold on, those recruits are GSG9 D:
---
More*
---
I wasnt making fun of you. This post just sounded like you didn't know that. Sorry.
---
Nice!
---
There‚Äôs twitch
---
How much
---
Yes it is
---
Wait im confused how to do it
---
Me and my friend duo queued a ranked match he was gold three probably bronze if I didn‚Äôt carry him I was plat two we had two diamonds and a copper 4 on or team and there team was all gold
---
I know
---
This only happens in console XD
---
Off fishing
---
Why can't both these companies just say
---
Fuck it pc is better anyways
---
And just make all game cross platform
---
what in tarnation
---
"That's the cutest thing I've ever seen"
---
*Thermite blows up*
---
*whimper*
---
No it‚Äôs a cover it‚Äôs a little gaming room
---
Lol everyone who posts clips on this sub is complete garbage
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind
---
Jesus squad
---
Yep we didn‚Äôt have a elite for it
---
This isn't csgo. No trading skins.
---
I figured out Monty works really well for beating T-Hunt realistic mode solo.
---
Just place two of them and then stay still for the whole match lol
---
Off with tachanka
---
Twitch and sledge should cover most sites just fine. Grenades from below, shoot from above or a drive-by.
---
Sliver 3? You think I‚Äôd insult you about that but the truth is....
---
i‚Äôm bronze please help me
---
Unfortunately I am like you. It‚Äôs become a sort of requirement to me to get the elites when they come out.
---
Thx I will check it!
---
It is
---
Playing as a team helps you get better personally. The game was designed for people to work together rather than go solo. I get your point and even your frustration as I‚Äôve always kind of had to carry when I solo queued (having to play support and frag bc of braindead teammates). But, as you play and if you don‚Äôt have friends to play with, play in game chat. You‚Äôre going to be bound to meet a couple people and eventually you‚Äôll start playing with them regularly. That‚Äôs what happened to me and I‚Äôve been playing with roughly the same squad since about Para Bellum. To conclude this jumbled comment, the game was designed around team play and the best way to play the game how it was intended is to meet new people. Hope this helped.
---
Lower heart rate, calmer nerves,  no pressure - win/win/win!
---
How much does an elite skin cost?  I've never even looked to buy one.
---
Looks cool to me
---
idk bruh it's still a flex
---
6 actually
---
Yeah, with this we had no one for the whole match
---
I mean idk I just know that lesion and kaid can make it hella hard getting into obj with their impact trick
---
Sorry, was busy trying to find an ACOG
---
Very well done. Great job man!
---
Mom said it's my turn to repost this
---
I never said they should balance it based on the plebs.  They shouldn't only focus on the pro players either, IQ wasn't overpowered, but because pro players won too much with her they nerfed her.
---
That is the hottest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
---
S H O C K
---
No u
---
I had the same reaction.
---
Pretty crazy that in some states you'd get gunned down for going out like this.
---
Other states people would just think "Oh, guess there is a convention in town"
---
And other states where dressing like this is just Tuesday.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the spiked hair!
---
Yep, they tend not to realize how important drone play is in ranked
---
I know I guess because they act so unpredictable and do the dumbest things it throws me off
---
Hell no. The shotgun might as well be considered a DMR and the ACOG is necessary
---
They haven‚Äôt opened it yet.
---
Do you know why I did it?
---
Pls dont let this diein new
---
But she gets literally zero assistance finding the devices. IQ can also destroy all defender gadgets, while twitch could get ten. Twitch has a better weapon (which isn‚Äôt even the point of comparison) but IQ has much more utility.
---
He's 50 yo are you sure.
---
Have you tried using the looking for group feature of xbox live?
---
Better luck than me.   The only legendary I got was from the free one last year üò¢
---
Use your drone more and you should be out of copper in no time :3 practice makes perfect, ya know?
---
Backbeard 2.0
---
Meh, imma keep using that hijab/scarf headgear with the chemical warfare uniform, that is a nasty combk
---
This is basically black beard if his shield couldn‚Äôt be destroyed. You couldn‚Äôt counter this. It would be incredibly over powered
---
&gt; IQ wasn't overpowered
---
&gt; pro players won too much with her
---
Alright buddy
---
When she sticks her pinky in your ass for the first time and you like it but are confused on whether or not your gay. All in the span of 1 second.
---
Which one was that?
---
Funny. I just died to a spawnpeeking Doc because of this. I see a window that looked like it was closed. But in the kill cam he opened a hole big enough for his gun and his mama's gun
---
I‚Äôll try that next. Thank you
---
Ick
---
-.- this guy
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Isn't Ash Jewish?
---
And while he‚Äôs there he can get us our claymores back
---
That's how they most commonly gauge the strength of an operator. At least that's what they tell us in their graphs they publish with large updates.
---
Thanks for sharing this! May I also ask how do you put the text at the end of your flair? ("I bad")
---
Oh my god all the yes! The entire reason I never go to vault is those stupid metal bars.

Thanks!
---
You realize he lost a match where it was a 2v5 right? Like there isnt any reasonable chance of winning that and it really shouldnt lose you eli for being in that situation.
---
I appreciate it!
---
i like your name.
---
Different operators? No, the starter edition of the game makes the base operators cost more.
---
Are you really saying that there should have been some expectation of winning a 2v5?
---
No problem friend
---
I could see this being one of those things were it isn't OP but it is INCREDIBLY frustrating to fight against. If he is stationary, then he would be vulnerable to roamers
---
What are they even replacing his wire with?
---
Its console though, do you expect beaulo level of clip?
---
I wish I had the clip of my first ace. I was fuze and I got one with the first charge then four with the next.
---
üòësmh
---
I‚Äôve already posted there
---
To all the people who don‚Äôt understand: Claymores, Deployable shields, and Clash were all temporarily removed from the game because they were all used for exploits. The claymores produced the invisible IQ glitch, which made IQ invisible (duh) the deployable shield was used to bring back Jaegerbeard, aka the shield head glitch, and clash had a glitch where she could shoot with her shield up.
---
I only use one stim for spawnpeeking and I‚Äôll go back to obj once I‚Äôm done is if you‚Äôre still there you may be lucky to get one :)
---
Didn‚Äôt they say that kill cams were crappy if the guy who killed you was leaning
---
üòÇ
---
I've done all of those and still nothing, I don't know what's wrong
---
No it wasn't open to begin with, just won't open when I click on it
---
Casual plats/diamonds being assblasted that no one wants them in their games.
---
There was a claymore glitch with IQ I believe that made her invisible.
---
I don‚Äôt have that one
---
I played that week but not what you needed to get it. I‚Äôm still salty.
---
dang well I tried, sorry
---
‚Äú*rAnK dOEsNT MeAN AnYTHing*‚Äù
---
Its hideous
---
The lord and his peasants.
---
All I have is a ability idea. R6s relies on sound heavilt, so why isn't there an operator ability to work with that. 
---
For a defender one thats like Kapkan, but uses sound tripwires would be cool. So that when a enemy walks through it it sets off an alarm to notify all defenders (these could maybe be cloaked? Like Yokais and Gus)
---
For an attacker I thought of an ability to have a sticky mine that let's off a huge bang, making the opponent lose sound for a period of time. I know this is quite similar to Zofia and nomad combined but I think it could be great to retreat or to flank an enemy, as without sound they would not be certain of your current whereabouts.
---
use Nomad's airjabs for it
---
works perfectly for me
---
Country: Israel
---
Role: Defender
---
Primary Weapons: IWI Tavor X95 and TS12
---
Secondar Weapons: Jericho 941
---
Gadgets: EMP dart gun with 3 EMPs
---
Explanation: a mix between Mozzie and Thatcher. Perfect for canceling hard breaches as the EMP cancels any/all devices in the blast. Shorter radius than Thatcher‚Äôs EMPS due to the smaller size. 3 meter radius instead of Thatcher‚Äôs 5.
---
System?
---
Pc
---
What the fuck?
---
P10-Roni with reflex and angled grip, and flash hider. Shotgun on the side and the c4
---
Lesion. Very solid defender, viable on every map.
---
Miria
---
Maestro. He‚Äôs a big Italian with a big machine gun and laser turrets. What else do you need.
---
Lesion is by far one of the easiest and best operators to use
---
para bellum had the best one
---
It‚Äôs a little better in the TTS at least
---
It's all the rave in Gold/Plat &amp; Casual. Had at least 3 games Saturday with run-outs and jump outs.
---
Nice.
---
Found the fat guy lol.  Did it take you so long to reply because of all the typos from your chubby fingers?  Someone with something actually going on in their life wouldn't have gone to the effort of writing that word barf.  Lol.   I pity you, boy
---
Yeah, I'm a dumb dumb. I was looking at it on my phone and the bumper symbols underneath were too small to make out.
---
How much are you willing to pay?
---
Temporarily due to some glitches with them
---
Too true, it's even more fun when I play hostage on my Fuze account. (Reddit Username and xbox account are the same)
---
You right, you right. But can't call you a man of culture just to get that out there
---
go with Lesion he is definitely your best bet
---
It depends on how good it is and if I like what you made
---
I have lots, my FBI spetsnaz jtf2 gign and gsg9 ops have black ice.. and smg 11 as well. But I am swapping to PC and all this is on console, rip 27 items of black ice üò≠
---
I did it once with Tachanka once in consulate. Wasn't too badm
---
Oh god me eyes 
---
Nice
---
sure one of the hottest camos
---
Was just about to post this, can‚Äôt seem to login either right now.
---
Yup they are degraded or something
---
HOW???
---
Y‚Äôall need Jesus
---
This really should have been in the game from the beginning
---
Relative to all other attacker guns?
---
Yeah. 670 rpm is pretty damn bad, and it can't even equip an angled grip.
---
Same here in Texas.
---
People say this but then complain when it takes too long, then they stop playing, then queues take longer. And no, people don't leave because this games unbalanced, because for the most part it's not.
---
Well the price for them won‚Äôt go down for them due to operation health but the price will go down the operation after
---
It doesn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre think of the early M16 variants such as the A1. The M16A4 is a military service rifle capable semi auto as well as burst fire. It doesn‚Äôt have full auto capability.
---
realistic bombers&gt; casual players
---
Why? They don‚Äôt even work half the time lmao
---
Ah it‚Äôs a fresh a day. I‚Äôm ready for some memes. I think I‚Äôll open reddit! What is this a rainbow vid? It looks interesting. I click it. The flash of light. The slow fade in. Oh god. Oh fuck. It‚Äôs happening. Not again.
---
Haha, right? Me too
---
Just use nomad lol
---
Yes first thing I did was restart several times, still nothing
---
You‚Äôre scaring me
---
This has been posted a long time ago
---
Ooohhh.
---
Haha shitty ps4
---
I‚Äôm planning to much into this aren‚Äôt I?
---
Back in the early days of League of Legends, I referred to Malzahar's E as space aids because you'd apply the DoT to someone and when they died it would spread to others nearby.
---
Hello this-diego! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**

I use the HyperX and love the cloth ear pads. I wear them 8 hours at work then come home and wear them 3-4 hours a night.

I love Sennheiser.

I feel sorry for that Monty. He's like a scared, lost puppy and you blew him tae fuck
---
This isn't from first week of release, Thermite's original logo was a red devil... Funny nonetheless though.
---
It doesn't really matter though. Regardless of level egotists gotta ego.

I cant tell whether or not this is a troll post. "Stuck in copper 4 for a while" "pretty good at the game"
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

hs
---
miss em
---
Maybe now she‚Äôll finally see the attackers üòÇ
---
You're probably right. Like I said I don't know for sure so I'm not the person to ask on that XD
---
Yeah can‚Äôt play either. Sucks
---
I don‚Äôt think you would notice 99 times out of 100. While we‚Äôre at it do the same for the white frame on some windows, those can block visibility too.
---
Honestly the new system is good. If someone teamkills an innocent person, the rest of the team can get revenge. The rest can shoot the teamkiller's foot and the teamkiller can do nothing about it. It's funny seeing salty people get more mad after they can't teamkill another person.
---
Defender could down the hostage somehow and win the round because it'd register the attackers as the ones downing him or something
---
monty

Hate it when people say stuff like your hacking it‚Äôs not even possible

I know you want to be in Australia. But you can't do it if you are halfway there.

Clown

why lord tachanka why
---
It‚Äôs not a troll, I was gold 1 but dropped dramatically now I‚Äôm trying to get back up
---
Damn. Me too
---
Just take skyscraper out (especially while we have no claymores) and I‚Äôll be happy.
---
They are back up
---
To be honest, it very well may help. Not gonna say it's all in the controller, but it does help. I got one specifically for Siege and I feel like I do better. Mapping reload and crouch to the triggers and having the higher thumb stick seem to help me. But it is a lot of money. Do you play it enough to justify this purchase? Would you use it for anything else? I'm happy I got mine, but I do regret it at times.
---
I hate people like you, just sayin
---
Not this again
---
Up üëÜüèª
---
Wtf I am 11 don't post this.
---
What is deadzone?
---
Tachanka's helmet is like a smiling face.
---
he‚Äôs like those nightmarish girls crawling out of a tv screen
---
Just console things you mean
---
I have HyperX Cloud Alpha and can't imagine having a better set of headphones.
---
So you‚Äôre saying that at range, you would have no idea where you‚Äôre being shot at from, if someone is spawnpeeking with Echo(Or any suppressed gun)?
---
I'm dangerously close to this fate.
---
I used to main Valk on Xbox and place cameras around doors to the objective then go hide in the least likely place to rush the attackers but I always got kicked because "I wouldn't pull my weight" even if I aced rounds doing that.
---
Doesn't really solve this, especially when the copper/bronzes are smurfs. There needs to be queue restrictions.
---
Jokes aside, it's glue. The sensor doesn't come with the claymore by default.
---
Playing high is honestly some of the best times i have
---
Report him for vulgar language, he‚Äôll get what he deserves
---
kill it
---
Yes removing player models the moment they disconnect from an active match is the players fault not Ubi my bad sorry guys.
---
Free stuff pisses me off too
---
What tachanka skin is that
---
I have Coolermaster MH752 and they are the glory. 150, very comfortable and great sound.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a problem ubi is trying to fix. It‚Äôs happened for a lot of people and they just need to readjust the aiming mechanics is all cause it fucks with your view as well as the opponents depending on yours or their position

No

1. Never mentioned anything about the game autobanning. I know it has to be observed by a human.  Ubisoft are incredibly soft handed. So soft infact they allow people to deliberately and unfairly fuck with the MMR for ranked gameplay.
---
2. Yes it takes time, its not  afast process but the moment people realize its happening the amount of exploiters drop.  Overtime the number gets lower and lower as word spreads.
---
3. COmpletely different mind set to people who "cheat/Hack" and people who "abuse gaming mechanics"  Cheaters understand its wrong but find it fun and dont mind having to pay again. people abusing mechanics often fall under, "well its a grey area and its not agianst the rules"
---
4. It wont get them to stop using it but it will reduce the numbers, I am by no means suggesting they leave it in. Handing out heavy punishments whilst the issue is resolved will 100% reduce the occurence of the issues. Yes some people will still do it. For the record its proven around the globe that a sign requesting people to not do stuff reduces the number of people  doing it but you still get outliers
---
5. I didnt say leave the exploit up and just warn people against it.
---
What ubisoft are doing is a terrible way to resolve the issue.  This time its 1 operator and 2 equipment items completely removed.   Claymores are completely insane to just "disable" It has rendered some maps almost unwinnable as an attacker if the defenders are compotent.  Anchor playstyle has been changed massively. (remember its not just diamond players, Many use the deployable barrier).
---
What if next time  There is an issue that is caused by an ACOG. The only way to disable it is to remove everyones ACOG. What if theres  abug that allows way more Gadget uses then intended across the board...
---
You cant just apply a "fuck it, disable the bugged stuff with no eta of a fix".  Especially when you STILL allow people to buy said items that are completely disabled.

I really don't think this is a problem. The game balancing algorithm will take all the ranks into consideration. Coppers and bronzes with a single diamond will have the combined skill of about a team of golds. And so the game found a team of about golds to face up against them. And by the looks of it, it actually was rather fair. You even won!
---
Smurfing is a real problem tho, because that will throw off the multiplayer teamfinders and will result in a lopsided game.
---
I used to be plat, then I stopped playing for like a year and just hopped back on the game, on a new account cause I had been using my brothers before,  so I hopped into the newcomers playlist thinking I might be trash, but then instantly got called out for being a smurf plat lol
---
They brought her pickrate all the way up and all the way down, there's a kind of balance to that.

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone

Terrible... least favorite map for that reason

You must not. I rarely play sas ops (i am now coz i just bought sledges and mutes elites) and albeit at first it hard to control (smg 11) but even after tge short period ive been using it i understand why it is still consider good. It does take some time to control it but its not long and anda imo a skill ceiling to the thing. It has the dps (a blistering rpm and solid damage) so aslong as you can control it you you will be rewarded. (Im on ps4 btw)

This one does have the soundwaves its jus really blended in with her hair in this photo

Dude, my second ever pack opened was Glaz gunfire legendary, ITS LITERALY WOOD

But i feel like they should donit in a full party though so others arent harmed by it

Does it get better as you go up the ranks? or is it always like this

did you get this lobby in an alpha pack?

poor kid. i remember getting asked to do a custom match to "test our skills" and then getting trash talked because i was winning to just be abandoned when i was up 9-4. Nice to see some good stuff.

I have 6 operators on my defending side and 5 on attacking. Ps its my 2nd acc but i dont care i always play with that.

---
They said they can't remove her due to the fact that she's a base op
---
Glaz is that kid that finds a big stick and thinks it‚Äôs an epic sword
---
I don't think rank mixing is a problem. A diamond with lower ranks doesn't mean its an unfair match. I've won against many wide spread teams b4. The matchmaking algorithm is designed to take these types of matches into consideration, and look, it didn't place you into an unfair match.
---
Smurfing meanwhile, is an entirely different issue. One that i will agree should be stopped if possible.
---
eh~

Truth is this sub is just too big for its own good. This is something that legit happens to any community, reddit or otherwise. Any decent content is just going to be drowned out in a sea of 50 posts saying 'LOOK AT MY CONFLAGRATION AR15' or 'HEY IQ THICC AMIRITE' or God forbid 'LORD CHANKA XD'

You've made dozens and dozens of negative comments on here but when someone directs one at you (for being a condescending douche, as you've clearly done many times in the past), that makes them a "kid"? Interesting logic....buddy.
---
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.
---
Toxic community man. Recommend just trying to find people here or in game and slowly build a couple of teams to play with. You Xbox?
---
Rank mixing isn't a problem, the matchmaking algorithm will do its best to find a fair match, and from the years i've been playing this game, it usually does a pretty good job.
---
Smurfing is an entirely different issue as that is essentially falsifying the numbers the algorithm uses to make fair matches.

---
I think the only reason they wouldn't go with CSGOs ranked system is they don't have nearly as large a player base as CSGO. But I do agree with it leaning toward the higher mmr side should be standard with every team if the person is plat 1 the lowest they should play is plat 3 never peak into Gold.
---
English might not be his first language or it was a simple mistake. It happens.

It's casual if you don't clutch too bad get out of my lobby

Well you move your cursor over to either one of those people, then either click or press A and boom you‚Äôre playing Mute or Glaz!

When you are relaxed, the solution and innovative ideas flow into your mind naturally.
---
1 I‚Äôm on PS4 
---
2 how do I play them effectively
---
Fighting fire with fire is the best solution.
---
&gt;Ubisoft are incredibly soft handed.  So soft infact they allow people to deliberately and unfairly fuck wit the MMR for ranked gameplay.  
---
They need evidence that the player was intentionally trying to exploit a glitch for an advantage.  A 1 time occurrence could be the player accidentally stumbling on it rather than intentionally trying to abuse it.  Hence why it takes time and why they won't ban unless they have concrete proof, they don't want to ban a player who made a mistake over a player who intentionally tries to abuse a glitch.  
---
The MMR is a different issue.  They are banning players who use cheaters to boost but queuing with players is a vastly different issue.  Limiting who they can or can queue with isn't exactly easy because there is going to be a range of ranks, not one specific ranks.  The problem comes down to finding that right range, and as a result they won't release that range too early as if it is too strict queue times will be come much longer as people would be unable to play ranked with friends just because of their ranks or just won't play ranked in general because they know they can't.  
---
&gt;but the moment people realize its happening the amount of exploiters drop.  Overtime the number gets lower and lower as word spreads.  
---
No it fucking won't.  You have an extremely naive view of the people who are abusing cheats.  If you think the threat of a ban is going to stop people from exploiting a cheat then you are fucking dreaming or smoking something very strong.  Again, actual fucking cheats and hacks still exist and are always given the threat of a ban and are attempted to kept in check with anti-cheat software.  If people are still willing to go out of their way get a script that gives them an unfair advantage despite the risk of a ban for that account, abusing a glitch in the game is guaranteed to still occur.  
---
&gt;COmpletely different mind set to people who "cheat/Hack" and people who "abuse gaming mechanics" Cheaters understand its wrong but find it fun and dont mind having to pay again. people abusing mechanics often fall under, "well its a grey area and its not agianst the rules"
---
No it's fucking not.  It's the same mind set of "I want an unfair advantage at any cost and I don't care if people are impacted".  In practically every multiplayer game, abusing an exploit is also considered cheating and as a result is known to get you banned.  It's NOT A GREY AREA.    
---
&gt;...  I am by no means suggesting they leave it in.  
---
&gt;I didn't say leave the exploit up   
---
Hmmm.  
---
&gt;You let people still play the game as intended with operators and equipment and dont fuck with the game mechanics.  ...   and stop ruining the game for everyone else.  
---
Moving on.  
---
&gt;It wont get them to stop using it but it will reduce the numbers, ... Handing out heavy punishments whilst the issue is resolved will 100% reduce the occurrence of the issue.  Yes some people will still do it.  For the record its proven around the glove that a sign request people not to do stuff reduces the number of people doing it but you still get outliers.  
---
Again, not if you leave it up.  You leave it up and put the threat of a ban, it will still get used.  You'd reduce it by at most 10%, and even that is a stretch.  You want to stop usage 100%?  Seal it off.   Having outliers is not good enough.  With this, it needs to do be done properly and instead of just a threat, you seal that shit off, preventing people from abusing it while you work to fix it.   
---
 
---
&gt;What ubisoft are doing is a terrible way to resolve the issue.  
---
No it's not.  If something is being abused as a result and you want to limit it's abuse while you solve the problem, you don't leave it up for people to continue to abuse.  Especially when in the past people have complained about Ubi taking too long before doing anything to address it, which was really just fixing it outright.  Even more so when it would be impacting Ranked matches.  With exploits such as this, you cut the problem out while you solve it.  Players can adapt around not having these things, like claymores, deployable shields, or Clash (and lets be real here, Clash being locked out isn't really an issue here.  She was a pain to go against and did very little to help out the team, few people will miss her).  A few players inconvenienced by a lack of items/Ops is better than numerous players being impacted by exploits in all modes.  
---
&gt;What if next time There is an issue that is caused by an ACOG.  The only way to disable it is to remove everyones ACOG.  
---
Firstly nothing is actually being removed, just locked out.  You can still use these things in Custom Matches or T-Hunt.  
---
Secondly, optics/attachments are a different issue and won't cause a game breaking exploit like the Clash, Deployable Shield, or Claymore invisibility ones.  If, and that's a very strong if, there were to be a bug like that, then yes, they should go ahead a disable ACOGs for the time being.  You don't NEED an ACOG in the game, a good player can work around not having one, hell some don't even use them to begin with.  
---
&gt;What if theres abug that allows way more Gadget uses then intended across the board...  
---
Again, different issue.  Something like that would be the result of an interactive with something on a map or in a mode, which is easier to disable or prevent.
---
Mute can be played in multiple ways, he's a very good operator and you can bring him every round and know that he'll be useful. Mute can either be used to block droning, or to deny breaching like Kaid and Bandit, or both. During the prep phase you can put mute jammers in front of walls that commonly get breached or put your jammers **near** doorways and drone holes, but don't put them right in front of doorways and drone holes because they can easily be destroyed. Running his shotgun, the SMG-11, and a nitro cell is a good load out that will work in just about any situation.
---
Glaz is a sniper, so you should try to keep distance between you and your opponents when possible. You can cover defender rotations when playing him, or you can shoot holes in the objective walls and snipe the anchors.
---
I'm not as much of a Glaz player as I am a mute.
---
I'm too lazy to count, but is there a map you were consistently doing better/worse than others?
---
I see this shit all the time on xbox. Every looking for group post is usually some diamond or plat trying to get into diamond looking for bronze or coppers.

*FOOKIN LASA SIGHTS*
---
Lmao
---
You wanna use Glaz as a sniper like he is intended and hold long angles. Usually the best use for him is to cover a teammate while they are planting in smoke or watch over the defuser with the smoke. 
---
As for Mute, put his jammers in spots where you know there is high drone traffic. You can put them  off to the side at the entrances of the doors on the objective but once you get those covered you can also use them on a reinforced wall in the event you don‚Äôt have a Bandit or Kaid electrifying the wall. The radius of the mute jammer is important too as in isn‚Äôt just a flat circle it goes vertical as well. On some objectives, like Oregon basement for example, you can put them one on the table of laundry to jam the hatch and another off to the side and potentially jam the staircase from below and preventing any drones going down them. Consider using his gadget more for blocking out drones then jamming walls.

I had this problem 3 months ago and I was scared af, I can actually tell you it's not your fault, but Uplay. I read recently that it can stay like this for an hour or even for a month. I had this problem and wasn't able to play for 3 days, the 4th it automatically logged in. Wait and pray.
---
Wish you a good luck with this horrible issue.
---
Idk this post seems pointless and baity to me
---
Excuse me wtf
---
The reason the current meta exists is because anchoring near objective just made it incredibly easy for attackers to win. Roamers became a thing because having 5 players near point was just a bad idea, spawn peaks exist because running to the building shouldn't be a free walk.

lol learning the game in ranked

U gotta b quicker than that

I honestly wasnt expecting that, respect!!!
---
Who said it was supposed to be slow?

Start shooting before you ads but ads asap. The laser is only helpful in that split second between starting to shoot and adsing fully, hence why most pros use it because they are playing at such a high level that every millisecond counts. For the rest of us, not so much

Anytime, comrade :)

Or you played more matches than him and you probbly lost 81 already so you are not at - points.

That‚Äôs true. Clicking the patch notes from the main menu in game gets you to that page.

Hello there
---
I don't have this problem myself, but I'd guess it's because it's easy to hold an extremely tight angle as a defender, which many people would find challenging to peak without an ACOG when on attack.

You do realize that it's a simple matter of changing the meshes right? That's how characters are chosen in game, actually. Simple mesh swap for the looks, function is also just as simple to swap.

Were you playing as, the Hamburglar?
---
Segregating the player-base is always a bad idea. There's a much easier way to stop boosting and it's already proven to work in games like Rocket League.
---
Simply, you change nothing about the current matchmaking system so for example coppers can still play with diamonds however, for every win the diamond will get 1-2 mmr and for any loss the diamond will lose much more than they normally would. The copper will gain/lose a normal amount of mmr.
---
This makes boosting the way its currently done impossible to do and players will have to resort to much more risky and expensive methods i.e. Giving your account to someone good and paying them to play for you.
---
Fair vengeance for getting downed by a cav? Thats just being toxic. It would be 'fair' if you managed to kill the cav instead of bug abusing...

PC player here, siege on a controller is way slower paced and played way differently. Less pixel peaking, less snapping to enemies, less headshots. The fast paced high damage gameplay is a staple of the game to me so when I see clips on console where every kill is 3x slower it looks as if the people playing are shit. I get that it's because of the controller but that's just what it looks like

I was in this game, you can see me die at the start, sadly the dude was afk in a corner.
---
Most of the cost comes from a good headset, which is at least 200$. Ik there are cheaper options, but if you want an actually good headset for competitive play you want something with a high range of frequencies, good comfort, and good mic. 
---
Mouses are about 100$, like the g502 which comes in at 80$. 
---
Keyboard is around 200$, but it is arguably unnecessary to get an rgb mechanical keyboard, nonetheless, even cheaper models come in at about 100$.
---
The mat is ultimately really cheap unless you want to go with something expensive, nonetheless, it adds up to the cost.
---
In the end, even with the cheaper options we get a total cost circa 400$. 
---
Besides, if you spent thousands of dollars on your rig to make it look pretty, sticking with cheap equipment is gonna ruin the whole look.
---
Also, don't forget the chair, which, even at cheap prices is easily 100$. 
---
PC is expensive as hell, unless you want to play on a shitty rig. 
---
Console on the other hand, requires a couch and a TV, both of which you already have at  home.
---
Same boat here pretty much. Only played him for the first time this month and I've been playing over a year.
---
Your really really bad
---
I know that feeling
---
Thank you that‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve ever heard
---
I cannot stand that shit
---
Black ice flex, I see you ;)
---

---
i definitely get that, but some people think it‚Äôs the exact same game, it‚Äôs not. there‚Äôs a reason why consoles are screaming that their games are ruined by mouse and keyboard. it‚Äôs because XIM users are literally playing an entirely different level then controllers and it‚Äôs unfair to:
---
A. Compare the two
---
B. Put them in the same play field
---
We know you had to do it to em
---
might be situational lose (defuser planted + last trade = attackers win)
---
Well you only have half a story because you failed to include it. So the only logical conclusion here is you are trying to start a witch hunt of a player by providing half baked evidence.
---
no I just don't like sitting dead. I'm like ADHD to the max I need to constantly be playing
---
why ironic?
---
I‚Äôve never seen this camo!
---
That‚Äôs dope! I love how there‚Äôs certain things you can only get in packs!
---
Is that the "I'm about to ruin this man's whole career" gif with God of War characters?
---
I don't talk during games
---
I mean, all of that is something that ubisoft already tracks, kills with Smoke's gas, walls breached with Ash's ability, having them not used at all its a wasted opportunity imo
---
maybe little too hard on that fella
---
Sounds like you need a new brother
---
What game mode and what side were you on
---
I failed to include it?
---

---
This comment is under appreciated

NO

All hail the magic conch!

No, the game is only growing right now

Did you even watch the video?

I can‚Äôt wait to see this nifty new skin on these invisible mines
---
Killcams are misaligned.

How do people still not know this

Stats yeah, those would be good.
---
Rewards for levelling etc are just nonsense
---
I started the other month
---
Almost always solo queing &amp; have learnt so much.
---
But, I also wish I ubi didn't listen to pros.
---
Maybe he shouldn't get advice from a recruit main
---
bomb defense and no one planted. I was camping the defuser
---
You could have cooked it longer but I usually cook the grenades to long
---
True, It‚Äôs just frustrating, I shouldn‚Äôt get butt hurt about it
---
He‚Äôs a hard counter to flashes, soft counter to smoke. The fact that if he even leans a little he can‚Äôt see through the smoke is kinda ridiculous. Plus, his gadget has a long cool down that can‚Äôt be reactivated like N√∏kk‚Äôs while it‚Äôs recharging

Hello mohaamd_7, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bwoy6f/this_reminds_me_of_the_time_i_tried_to/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros

Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.

Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

Because ur probably not good with map knowledge and you don‚Äôt know the angles to predict..attackers shouldn‚Äôt have acogs along with some exception.

Haha mozzie short lmao xb
---
Sometime last week I created a board of the rainbow six siege operators and I‚Äôm grateful everyone loved it! However, out of the 380 comments, an overwhelming majority pointed out a fact I clearly missed ‚Äì Nokk and Warden‚Äôs reversed positions. So, when I went back to fix it I also added a bit of framing and spacing!
---
Thank you all again for the support. My entire journey about learning laser cutting began by making Tachanka as a coaster on a whim when my friend showed me our university‚Äôs laser machine and since then I‚Äôve made so many great things. If you‚Äôd like, you can find me on FB/Twitter/Insta @ArcanicArtistry. But most importantly, have a great day.
---
It‚Äôs free weekend? I guess that‚Äôd explain all the gadgets on door barricades I‚Äôve seen recently...
---
Might as we get a new family and move to a different planet whilst he's at it.
---
So true i was a blitz main till now...
---
Then you're a bad person
---
By the time you'd go through all that cav would've got to you
---
But recruit is the best operator in the game?
---
Kapkan mains are gay
---
There is no killcam so we don't see from the other player perspective of how they killed the person complaining. There is also the arugment that the person was leaning left so left their body wide open. This 9 second video only provides 1 viewpoint.
---
Vote to kick Ubisoft has initiated
---
1/4
---
It wasn't my suggestion, just done other dudes. Overall I'm just in favour of making it harder to leave a match (e.g their body stays downed for the rest of the match or something, or for 30 seconds or whatever).
---
And thanks, I didn't even know it was my cake day :)
---
I mean, rewards for challenges is something we already have, many games already do that and the userbase is used to it, it's not anymore Quake times where people play just for playing their favorite game, nowdays people play for what they can earn from the game itself, the game market is HUGE nowdays, this my suggestion I think would people keep playing the game even more, I see it as a win/win for both ubi and us,  you may not like it but I'm pretty sure it's not something that can hurt you playstyle
---
Maybe, but I don't think it would be very smart for us to balance around low rank players, think about how broken smoke would be if he was balanced to the point that he was played at the lower ranks. Let's wait and see how he plays at the top and see how he needs to be adjusted.
---
Free weekend coming up. But be warned it is extremely addicting and you won‚Äôt want to play anything else after having your first heart attack
---
Why not?
---
&gt; nowdays people play for what they can earn from the game itself
---
Which is a pathetic outlook which shouldn't be rewarded.

It creates a new incentive to play the game more.

If that makes ya feel better...
---

---
All these runouts is making me not play the game until claymores are back.
---
Considering the shield is mostly transparent, it wouldn't be a sage choice.
---
Finally Warden and nuck are correctly fixed
---
This game teaches a valuable life lesson. People are cock gobbling dickheads. You can either interact with them giving them a reaction they so desperately need to validate themselves in life or you don't interact with them either making them try harder at getting your attention or to drop it and move on. I've not had many matches where ignoring them actually escalated the situation but when it does it's rather comical seeing how pathetic and desperate some people will become to validate the non-existent life. If I cared i'd feel sorry for them but that takes up energy so I don't bother.
---
I play video games to be competitive with people without the anxiety of real life interaction like in sports
---
That would completely devalue black ice
---
&gt;intent
---
Here, you missed this.
---
Also how do I seem offended? Do you even understand the meaning of the word?
---
When is the free weekend?
---
Is she getting a price drop when the next ops drop? I want to unlock her, but not for 20k...
---
But, I wish I ubi nerfed cav
---
No you can't  . only year 4 for now . Also the operators got a price reduction lately
---
why the hell is this considered quality content for you to show to the Internet
---
Kill cams are out of sync. It‚Äôs a bug
---
No you can get placed at any rank right from the getgo.
---
if you're playing together then play as a team I'm not saying ignore your friends, just dont give unsolicited advice. There is a difference between shot calling, strats, etc. And giving unsolicited "advice". Like for example asking your buddy to reinforce a specific wall is probably fine, but if they say "oh I was gonna use it for x" then let them. They're learning and they're experimenting. If you're dead, only make callouts for them from cams. If you can only spectate their POV, then it's better to just let them do their thing.
---
no, what I'm saying is that console players and even lower ranked PC players may not enjoy changes made to the game based off of only plats and diamonds on PC and not including at least gold-diamond on console and PC, it would make a better games that keeps more players and gains more because it listens to it's playerbase and pros equally.
---
It‚Äôs to bad Warden is so situational, I don‚Äôt want to see any warden mains every single game. Maybe every once and a while but not often
---
If you play on Xbox I can help you out and teach you the basics
---
There's always that one dumb fuck that can't appreciate humor. Looks like today that dumb fuck is you.
---
Best thing I think I'll ever see on the website.
---
See? u/Mercpool87 gets it! Why doesn‚Äôt Ubi?
---
Don‚Äôt listen to him. Recruit is versatile.
---
It‚Äôs okay. 
---
My favorite part about the ranked changes are the 3 round rotations more than pick and ban. I‚Äôve played a lot of these so far, I rarely see the same operators banned in every game.
---
How can someone be only a plat? Wtf?
---
How is that somehow a complete disregard for my thoughts?
---
This is ridiculous. 
---
Sorry I think people should be better to each other, but whatever, revel in toxicity.
---
Seems fair.
---
/S
---
Touch√©
---
You are right, what would be your idea?
---
It‚Äôs not the case. She doesn‚Äôt get banned that often. In my experiences it‚Äôs been Lesion and Echo that gets banned the most
---
I can‚Äôt wait to get TKed on casual when I pick Warden and N√∏kk because the 8 year old on my team thinks he‚Äôs entitled to get a turn with them because he bought the season pass.
---
If they wanted to go for "different" guns, they should've given Warden Jackal's smg (acog-able) and Nokk the MPX.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt see the picture
---
Yes
---
That's a great idea, the one with the bulletproof glass. Should it be like a Blackbeard? Or more like the Tachanka's LMG Windows?
---
It‚Äôs great, people like that guy are just unbearably annoying. Anyone who uses ‚Äòbot‚Äô unironically is scum and makes me want to gag. They‚Äôre so arrogant too that all it takes to get them tilted is a ‚Äòno u‚Äô type comment. Just better that it comes from Ubi themselves.
---
I  advise you to play the shotgun with a laser.(having a laser it shortens the spread of the shot allows you to do more dmg at slightly longer distances).
---
optional: u can also play with a sight but thats personal preference, having a sight does not impact the spread at all but when u ads with any shotgun with any sight (including iron sights) it will tight the spread just a tiny bit more so u can deal even more of a bit of dmg and be able to engage on longer distances.
---
I've played smoke for maybe 70+ hrs if not more and his shotgun has been always reliable at killing/making rotations. My other advice is to use the shotgun to kill till 9 meters max. At that distance if u have both laser and are ads'ing it will  1 shot most of the time. (It can be incosistent since its a shotgun and the spread is never the same)
---
Yeah I do really like the 3 round rotations. It helps for people like me who have a one track mind and can‚Äôt switch from offense to defense every round lol
---
&gt; ultimate loadout 
---
Contains item that is not useable
---
I would have loved if they also gave him ITAL12 primary shotgun instead of the m590. I really wanted to use new weapons instead of old ones but whatever
---
 *"Your stats are below average"* 
---
**OOF**
---
What? You could also choose to play casual instead of ranked as someone who doesn't want to play against these teams.... Casual and ranked are so different. You can't really compare them.
---
Yikes.
---
If ur ping golfing then u guys easily win. Lower the ping the better throughout the team. Ez claps
---
Awesome thanks!!!
---
That's fair
---
Why the heck were all five in one corner? Why can‚Äôt I get lucky like that? Lol
---
I‚Äôd still shoot it.

**TRAPS ARE GAI**
---
A bug that's been in the game already
---
He's equivalent to somewhere between a one and 2 speed. Don't exxagerate.
---
My first legendary was the Waxwing headgear for j√§ger
---
Truth be told I think even the challenges we have can lead to poor decisions (and I do agree that the OP's suggestion would be even worse).  I've had a ranked match where we had Pulse, Castle, and two recruits on the board to accomplish the "win 8 rounds as FBI SWAT" where Castle would've been a waste for pro teams much less my little ragtag group and the two recruits were clearly a hindrance.
---
I think the best fix is implementing both. Or if you leave the game downed your body stays.
---
No, you should still be able to.
---
That they don't need improving. What do you think the current problem is?
---
Also that yeah
---
With the glitches the game still has I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised
---
Nope . Because ubi has one weakness . That weakness is 77 111 110 101 121 32 36 36 36

That's how he can afford all those armour plates...

3.5 ranked kd? 22 games won per game lost? Seems legit.
---
How can you play so well with such high sensitivity?
---
You notice how much more you see of these when you play siege?
---
Please tell me if I am saying something wrong, but if Epic Games can do it why can't Ubi do it?
---
I know, I wanted to incorporate that but I couldn't find the percentages for season pass anywhere (probably just looked in the wrong place) . if anyone can tell me what those are I will make a second graph and post it here
---
I dont know if you ever seen Valk elite, but if you did you‚Äôd change your mind
---
Send me a PM!
---
Either mira or valk. Hard to decide.
---
How you place the oldest and thiccest operator at the bottom?

Well, at least you've got a skin for wardens secondary then.

Lmfao

None of the ACOG bois at the top smh
---
Of course, how could I forget! I have that one too.

They might be the lifeblood of the game but the pro scene is what will ultimately keeps a game like this alive because new people see those streams and they bring in money

Why God of War though and not R6 characters?

Is it me or is everyone i‚Äôm playing against always rushing into the objective?

June 6-9. Hasn't even happened yet.

found it on ubi's support page . The percentage is +0,3%

I don‚Äôt that the fights are becoming less dependent on aim , I just think that with every season the meta is becoming just slightly more annoying

Put the armor down and prepare to spawnpeek before cowering back to anchor. congratulations, you‚Äôve done your job as Rook. Actually just step 1 makes me happy.
---
OMG, YOU‚ÄôRE A DOUBLE **DOUBLE** AGENT!

Whatever the reason, it's annoying as fuck, why not play a game with respawns then instead of potentially fucking over your team.
---
Next Operator: "TSM-Comp"
---
Ability: Insults people on kill/"Rees" upon Death
---
Weapons: M870/L86A2/LFP 
---
Bio: Just a competitive player that was invited to rival Clash in toxicity.
---
Nokk is basically a ghost, so no thiccness to be found there. By contrast, just Wardens mustache is so THICC he does not want to grace this pathetic list with his presence.
---
I used to play like 18 18 then slowly like maybe every week I bumped it up 2 then I stopped when I was satisfied
---
https://i.redd.it/hp53safpmus11.png
---
Then sadly, this isn't the game for you. There are arena shooters where you respawn. There are BRs to quickly jump into another match after dying. 
---
What you are doing is ruining the rest of the match for everyone else and that is incredibly selfish.
---
I think it's coming this weekend along with the free weekend
---
That was my first elite
---
Rook the destroyer of the buffets . Is at TH tier ? HE SHOULD BE ABOVE THAT !!!
---
\*claps slowly\*
---
Dad?
---
Unfortunately Nokk and Warden weren't available on the list but if the were Nokk would be a T and Warden an INSTANT SMASH.
---
I wished the party was recorded cause I just started screaming when I saw 3 then when I exited I got even more hyped seeing the last 2
---
Then play a different game because siege isnt for you
---
Glaz as well
---
True. But wouldn't that give them more 77 111 110 101 121 32 36 36 36 ?
---
Cav was rarely used in a pro leagues game, maybe twice cause of Joonas; but she still got nerfed
---
Honestly it sounds like nails on a chalkboard.
---
I thought of another:
---
We‚Äôve been deceived, backstabbed and quite possibly bamboozled
---
so 1.5 and 2 are now 1.8 and 2.3? ranked will come soon as well
---
Nope just high sens controller
---
just make it so those guys can't join back. (if user downed and leaves (either by clicking the buttons in game or if the game received a termination signal) plus lose mmr and banned for X amount of time. i hate these people with passion
---
Flair checks out

110 111 32 46 32 66 101 99 97 117 115 101 32 116 104 105 115 32 119 105 108 108 32 99 111 115 116 32 116 104 101 109 32 109 111 110 101 121

Yeah cause I'd hate to be able to talk to my team or hear them talk.  Chat bug has been around forever and it's likely not getting fixed this patch either.  So reconnecting is something that needs to stay.

This should be an instant ban if you ask me
---
like i said (only for people who leave not those who lose connection to ubis servers) 
---
use the quit to desktoop / alt+f4 / kill task u get banned and your mmr gone ...
---
They keep doing it for the guns that no one uses very often
---
At least isn't a bacon slice...
---
People of PC games cling to qaulity games that dont get silly updates or intense amounts of powercreep.   
---
CS:GO added that new pistol and failed to balance it and it almost killed the game thankfully they quickly change it.   
---
So long as Ubisoft dont let powercreep take too much of a leap its good.
---
Rip
---
What? Was that suppose to be a joke?
---
Then they should have it turned on in plat a diamond
---
no it doesn‚Äôt
---
So when I do this to Cav mains, I just have to unplug my connection, then quit. gotcha
---
And I though blitz flash was trash now
---
Leave a game, if your team loses, you'll lose MMR

Can we see that recruit on the back? (Iirc OP said there‚Äôs a big recruit on the back) Also, OP, you should get a 3D printer makes these and sell them online for probably 15-30 $ each, seems fair(?)
---
there is a way to detect that as well ;) point is to make it as hard for assholes to be assholes.
---
plus you can always report them and ubi adds some rule against this kind of dickhead behavior. 
---
instead of acting like a smartass try and come up with better suggestions instead of criticism for the sake of criticism
---
Fizzie is right, the game isn‚Äôt about the operators, it‚Äôs how you use them on each map, I grinded and grinded to unlock all the operators and then I realized I have the most fun playing as Sledge and Smoke, the first two ops in the game. So the operators are less important, what‚Äôs more important is your patience and map knowledge. 
---
That being said, I would just like to say that by and large, the maps have similar layouts or strategies that can be used. Obviously there are exceptions (Favela, prez plane) but i wouldn‚Äôt really tunnel vision on learning one map. Learn how the map designers like to do things, and get used to peeking corners fast with your sights at head or chest level, and use your Godamn drones !
---
Not going to lie I only caught the subreddit after. 
---
I think it applies well to the majority of ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù players who are chasing rank simply to say they have X or Y rank.

And to parade it around when they stack with their friends smurf account.

PC has a different flavor of toxicity compared to console; it's really mostly a pick your poison situation.
---
PC has text chat which can be sent to both your team and the opponents.  Text chat has all sorts of toxicity as you might expect from the internet, but you can mute individuals as well as disable text chat entirely.  Since text chat doesn't exist on console, this obviously isn't a factor at all for console.
---
Console toxicity mostly comes down to trolling teammates using in-game mechanics.  Team killing, device killing, hostage killing, and other in-game things designed to frustrate teammates is much more the norm as far as console toxicity goes.  This level of trolling you get on console far outnumbers what you get on PC, even on the worst of days.
---
The net result for me, since I can mute or disable text chat (or just ignore it), is that PC has a MUCH more welcoming community than console.   There are oftentimes friendly people who will help you when you're new to learn the ropes (in casual; in ranked they're probably less accommodating).  If you are more sensitive to the text based toxicity, console may be better.
---
As a background on me, I played on Xbox up until clearance level 120ish before switching to PC where I'm just shy of 168.  Outside of the steep learning curve of going from controller to keyboard/mouse on PC, I am so much happier on PC than console whenever I'm not in a full squad.

Hello PsiEcstasy, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bwroxl/good_lookin_bug_that_fov_is_actually_pretty_decent/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Someone is tracking you down
---
"no u"
---
:)
---
Hahahaha yup i forgot how sensitive people are nowadays
---
5/4 üôÑ
---
at least im not console peasant.
---
He's just standing there
---
Menacingly
---
Issa ghost run
---
And then i press V
---
the point of this its just a joke and a meme jeez..
---
Dude you're so fucking cool
---
Is this a glitch because I swear I‚Äôve done it once before?
---
r/woooosh
---
lol he played 3 games in OP:PB and then just dipped.
---
Merely a joke. French word for red also used to reference makeup, wine and is the name of a River in Michigan.
---
Me, though.
---
I mean, it is a skin, after all, and it does depend on both quality and personal preference.
---
Lucky, I always start to tear up when I run into those.
---
Click on search bar.  Type "phantom sight release date".
---
Exactly.
---
I‚Äôd submit a ticket to Ubisoft because there is no way you can de rank that far that fast.
---
Ok just making sure, you never know these days haha
---
Also new.
---
Personally, don't find it great.
---
That's just me though.
---
I actually really like the p-10. I mean I like both of her guns but yea I have no issue with her getting the skin for the p-10.
---
Some people say it'll go live on the 11th
---
OP was implying we shouldn't call people retards.
---
Yo dumb nuta, the f2 rlly exists.
---
There's more than one way of going about it. Different ranking systems have been successful, but what we can agree on is that siege needs to change as it has failed.
---
*initiate nightmare
---
That was meant to be playful I didn't really mean to tell you how to play with your brother. If you're on PC and NA and want an extra person to goof around with send me a DM
---
Braindead idiots who got insulted over a joke
---
Not anymore
---
seriously some maps are unplayable and there's no way to punish run outs reliably if you don't play nomad. anchors also loose a ton of spots to hide because of the lack of shields. Game feels like in such a broken state right now. and apparently it won't even be fixed with the launch of the new season.
---
Do people just "miss" all announcements and news even after repeated posts?
---
3 weeks TTS. Add that to the TTS start date, and you have your answer?
---
Wait what
---
r/wooosh
---
Yeah, fairly common before a new season drops.  Trying to draw in new players.
---
I need you to calm down sir
---
Got game in Wind Bastion but wasn't high enough level for ranked until BH. My highest was Gold 4 and i'm currently Silver 1
---
ya but in most casual or lower level ranks at least people don't really check for claymores and you don't have to be constantly looking over you back for runs outs.
---
The Warden icon is shifted to the left.
---
I KNEW IT! I knew I wasn't the only one!
---
Everything works fine except for that sh*thole of a map. Useless map.
---
I spent 5 minutes laughing at this.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so bad 
---
I don‚Äôt have y controller plugged in
---
It might just be a THunt thing
---
I love democracy
---
Totally true!
---
But he can still use them...
---
 when your connection is shit yeah
---
N√∏kk, definitely.
---
It‚Äôs not laziness, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt care enough to look up His account. That said, getting no kills in 3 games doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a bad player getting carried, he could of just had a few bad games to start, or plays support, like droning and got flanked. Now if this were 20+ games in, we‚Äôd have a valid post.
---
Only recruit boys
---
Yeah they'll probably patch that soon.
---
Sadly.
---
Some of the pros have been hinting at next Tuesday (the 11th).
---
I mean, it‚Äôs just a video game so no
---
"search"?
---
You'll get your answers.
---
If you are used to playing FPS games then not long at all. I rarely ever played shooting games before siege and it only took me a few weeks. I still lack a little when it comes to aim (being on console doesnt help) but in terms of Strats and thinking process it didn't take long.
---
^uno ^reverse ^card
---
look at the upper right hand corner, I'm surprised you could even move with your connection at that moment
---
Yeah I believe it, but that doesn't change the fact that a truly competitive game can't have different rules depending on your rank... 
---
Having tk turned off in high levels only would make every plat into a diamond (because you would literally be making it easier on players that are already good at the game)
---
Then, having it turned on in lower levels would trap lower level players in those ranks forever. Because they wouldn't be able to use the same risk free strategies as higher level players...
---
The other way around, having tk turned on in higher levels, but off in lower levels, would damage the competitive aspect just as much.. Because then everyone would be a plat, because you could use those risk free strategies in lower levels, making it wayyyy easier to rank up and win.....
---
Looks cool. Probably custom emblem though
---
Well done for posting some original content
---
it's just a video game
---
You're not you when you're hungry
---
Saw this posted two days ago
---
:(
---
What's life like on the International Space Station?
---
Fat ass fuze was trying to Assassin's creed you.
---
Stealth failed
---
They talked about if both teams draw and attack doesn‚Äôt get the defuser down then the defense wins because the bomb has no way of being defused. Don‚Äôt know if/when it will be added tho
---
No1plugin
---
Wtf else do you expect though? Besides, I think its cool that people show what legendaries you can get in alpha packs.
---
Man? Ash has changed gender?
---
If you remain in this area you will be detected by hostile, fall back.
---
I too am excited for the next episode of Dororo
---
i thought all this time it was thermite. damnit
---
*continues to use cluster charge on criminal*
---
Touch touch touch
---
How do you get multiple flairs I‚Äôm so confused
---
What's your settings @? I looked up.on YT a siege benchmark for a 1080 GPU (which is what I have) on 1440p with high/medium settings and he was only getting 90-110 frames
---
You can edit the flair you select
---
In like 99% of gun fights in rainbow if you don't kill the other guy you will die. I dont get it
---
We all make mistakes like the post
---
Just turn your sensitivity up and practice on one of the targets in Hereford base
---
üòë
---
Oh shit word
---
You can say ass on the internet bro lol
---
That was a nice nitro cell though
---
It doesn't necessarily make you a better player like it's some kind of magic but it can help you to improve.
---
Good joke ubi lol I have a lot of respect for a self aware dev in all seriousness
---
Hmm might just have to do that. Using a mouse could help as well. As I'm new to the game, I'm currently using a controller, as that's what I'm more accustomed to.
---
How did you get that?
---
It'd be a strat.
---
Just like the prep phase Dokkaebi check strat.
---
Mamma mia, spaghetti!
---
I would just start sprinting towards my xbox to unplug it
---
Warden and his Ned Flanders lookin ass
---
I was mostly joking, I don‚Äôt mind Mira and while I hate Echo, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs cancer. I get banning Blitz, but I wouldn‚Äôt waste a ban on Clash, 99% of people who play Clash are terrible and easy to kill. I‚Äôd rather ban a Lesion or Jager any day over her.
---
But he still has the glasses, and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable if he‚Äôs still resistant against flashes. I want his lifeless body to feel every burst of light. Ubi pls.
---
me too bud...
---
Booters
---
The test servers are lasting three weeks this year, so it should land around about June 11th, which is next Tuesday. That‚Äôd be my guess anyway
---
*cries in clash*
---
That was some god awful aim even for console
---
If you have an issue, message me, don't bad mouth me in the comments
---
Test
---
You we had to gu it to 'em.
---
Ok
---
Feels bad
---
We are gonna ignore how you placed the ying before the breach charge
---
Not yet
---
same bro.
---
Yeah it's stolen
---
If I recall correctly, last one standing was killed right after by an airship pilot. It was long time ago, correct me if I'm wrong
---
Makes sense thanks
---
Fuck clash, no one likes her. Shes just an Inti-fun mechanic in a generally fun game and she actually pisses me off.
---
Is his true calling as an anchor, roamer or no one cares just play the game?
---
I can sadly. I've pretty much heard it all over the years at this point
---
Figured
---
When it's your birthday but you get banned
---
Skyscraper, fortress, border, fortress, yacht, repeat for me. I'd love to get Oregon or hell even Favela more than once each year
---
Glad you did it
---
Pretty much everyone is
---
Roaming or not depends on playstyle
---
Report that lad so he is more pissed off
---
üôÇ thanks
---
What is legendary at this?
---
Acog and a powerful gun sounds like a pretty damn good roamer
---
Doesn't mean we can't compare stats :) Feel free to pop me your email in a PM and I can send you an invite if you fancy it.
---
Repost from yesterday
---
Gnomad
---
lol the scope is the best sight in the game
---
I can't be the only one who has noticed this. I mean, it looks like a black circle. The ACOGs have some form when aiming. You can see the other sights by scrolling down here:  [http://www.hxchector.com/rainbow-six-siege-guide/17/](http://www.hxchector.com/rainbow-six-siege-guide/17/)
---
That cup ain't big enough
---
Didnt know, sorry
---
Aren't you forgetting something, it's either no claymores or invisible IQ's.
---
Just have patience till next patch comes.
---
I can‚Äôt even count how many times spamming the knife button has worked when blitz rushed
---
Jager
---
I'm so scared that everyone's gonna runout on me constantly, my life is hell please kill me
---
This is my favorite scope in the game lmao
---
Me and my friends play a lot less Siege when they removed a few maps, and will probably cut down more now that we can only play bomb. Less content and variety would be a huge problem imo.
---
Actually, if you have discord lmk what ur account is and we can talk from there
---
Easily the best sight in the game
---
I feel so satisfied being the 666'th who upvoted
---
No one comments about the light changing :(
---
I swear im gonna kill some1 and hack their phone
---
It literally goes invisible
---
I got the HyperX Cloud II and I think they‚Äôre great for siege I would just recommend not using the 7.1 feature as the game isn‚Äôt mad for it and can cause you to not hear sounds in the direction they should be
---
Thanks man appreciate
---
Hope this is satire
---
Tf is that black mark.
---
Fuck you guys, you should respect all players no matter the fucking platform
---
I can't upvote this as its in 666 but thank you glaz very cool
---
Just because not every attacking player will use smokes or flashes doesnt mean it that warden should get any of those.
---
He is very situational and added for cases like Ying in Hostage or full smoked rooms in bomb. Even if no attacker uses smokes or flashes,you can still be helpful to your team by playing the objective
---
Heve you even played casual?
---
And yet I don't see you telling us of this
---
Uhhh cool, bud
---
44 and 46/47 kill all armor types in the same number of shots
---
Get a pc
---
Like honestly man, IQ sees relatively low play in ranked as she is only viable in the higher ranks with a functioning team. Imo they should have removed iq from matchmaking. They could also just remove iqs claymore temporarily and if that‚Äôs a bit hard too implement temporarily substitute her claymore with another charger like  stuns or smoke or smth. Claymores are a big part of siege and are integral for attackers for claiming the map and shiz. Completely denying attackers that capability is harsh.
---
I pay for the game I deserve to play it that's that. play ranked if you don't wanna play w people like me
---
bold of you to assume gods can die
---
At least it doesn‚Äôt block half your screen like the acog does
---
Best sight in the game
---
Oh yeah forgot about them. Zofia came in season 3 and ela in season 4 iirc so they're gonna get cheaper in those seasons. 
---
Basically every new op is 25k at the start and 5k cheaper (but not cheaper than 10k I think) after every year and the price is reduced at the start of the same season that they were released. So at the start of season 2 every op from y1-3 s2 are gonna get cheaper. You can see that season 1 ops are already cheaper so buck and frost are 10k instead of 15k like other y1 ops etc.
---
censoring the guy‚Äôs profile picture
---
lol, he deleted his account
---
These aren't comparable since the latter is easier.
---
This is the best sight
---
I personally hate that blitz players even have the desire to blind me in order to gain an advantage in the fight. just fite me straight up! My jimmies get rustled every time I see I a blitz.  Yes I am salt.  Fuck blitz
---
Horee shit!
---
Unless ur with a 5 man squad those setups don‚Äôt mean shit cuz in those pro strays every player has a very important role
---
oh okay thanks i‚Äôm new to shooters so sorry i didn‚Äôt know üòÇ
---
Echo is even a better roamer. He can drone to scope rooms, blast enemies and sneak attack them.
---
Acog, an even better gun and intel+cc
---
He's not too far from the mira window itself so he probably would get prefired and die, if he went prone it might have worked
---
My point is it‚Äôs a bit hard to implement
---
You poor innocent soul.
---
Let me break both sides of the arguement down without the simple "lol this is the best sight"
---
For:For older players who have adjusted to the ACOG the scope is new and is not ideal for then but this is a somewhat weak arguement but the arguement against your opinion is strong.
---
Against:The scope has a very thin casing around the sight allowing for your vision around the sight to be good and less so obstructing anything just to the side of your scope i.e. with ACOG you cannot see something that is even just out of your sights focus when you ADS(aim down sights) but with the scope you can.
---
Also it's nice to have a new unique thing in the game allowing variety and making it more interesting.
---
To be honest both sides are somewhat reasonable but in my opinion whatever suits you.
---
Sledge and thermite where season 2
---
Season 1: tachanka, iq, ash, smoke, monty
---
Season 2: sledge, thermite, hibana, Calk, jager
---
Season 3: ela, cav, bandit, vigil, twitch
---
It has already been done before. Unfortunatly I dont have a specific video link. But a cool german youtuber does a series called Rainbow Six Mythbusters:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSCIGPFpJEY&amp;list=PLFBt7GPgi101tNCkqo4pVmnj3fmTr19WX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSCIGPFpJEY&amp;list=PLFBt7GPgi101tNCkqo4pVmnj3fmTr19WX) 
---
And the Glaz trick was inside one of it. Even if you don't speak german, maybe try to watch a episode with subtitles... They are really entertaining
---
Irrelevent, from a game design perspective, this sight is an issue. You benefit from the x4 Zoom of an ACOG without the downside of the blind spot. And as OP is saying, it looks really cheap too but this one is more about  personal preferences.
---

Alt+f4 isnt a master kill tho. Alt+f4 just sends the application a request to close itself but the application can ignore it. Ctrl+alt+f4 and various others do force kill it tho without asking the application
---
That‚Äôs messed up
---
Okay, lets do this.
---
You are playing casual, and your opponents were unlucky enough to get a terrible site.
---
Your Lion activates his ability at the beginning of the round for no reason.
---
You rush through bottom floor without droning.
---
I'm a PC player so I'm not sure on this one, but your aim seems really really bad.
---
The first guy you kill has no headset and somehow doesn't hear you coming, after you rush in without droning. You only land a headshot because of pure luck- while you randomly pull your gun down to ankle height.
---
You push up stairs without checking any angles, aiming at the cam. If someone were holding your left you would have died.
---
The *smoke* (one of the most important anchors in the game, an operator who NEEDS to survive until the last second) randomly feeds for no fucking reason. He doesn't even try to shoot at you, even though he already knows where you are. Of course you wildly body shot him to death.
---
The Doc is a complete fucking bot and somehow manages to lose the fight- even though he quick peeks you, and you are only capable of aiming at the body. While he is playing doc. An operator that is near immune to body shots...
---
You of course have an unused drone, because droning isn't important at all! 
---
You re-peek the SAME angle that you have gotten two kills from, leaning the wrong way and exposing your body while doing so. If there was a player holding that angle you would have died.
---
You don't properly check any of your angles for roamers, meaning you should have died.
---
You have a *comically* bad gunfight with an Alibi, who seems to be somehow worse than you are. She's literally sitting in a random corner with her pistol out, only managing to lose because her aim is copper 5 tier.
---
This is the point where I realise you're playing SECURE AREA, which is immediately -100 IQ points.
---
You don't bother to check your angles, but I guess you somehow knew the last retard was in bottom tower for no reason?
---
You wildly prefire the echo at body height... who decides not to shoot back for some reason?
---
That might happen in down in Bronze, but people are usually respectful up in Platinum and so on.
---
you cant do that; say the timer runs out while you have the hostage, you can only use your pistol to shoot the windows, which won't work, and if you drop the hostage, you lose because the hostage isn't secured
---
can i get one too mans
---
Maybe next year when operation half ass is over they will fix the bugs and give us back claymores, deployable shields, and clash.
---
I play in gold, so can‚Äôt say
---
Wow, all of the comments are a pretty pathetic. Why can't you appreviate the fact that I won, and also the fact that I have more money than you and that I can afford these nice skins. You guys are all pathetic jelaous crybabies. It is MY VICTORY, suck it or cry about it. maybe when you git gud, you too will realize how it is.
---
Austral. Oceans teeth is good but austral fits on so many weapons so well.
---
Bro recruit is God tier.
---
I accidentally bought the advanced version on g2a for pc and I got the outbreak packs. Idk about redeeming it on xbox though
---
So you are one of those players who blame everyone else but yourself when you die and when you do the guy is instantly a hacker and there is not a possibility that they could have heard you coming etc. If you really get headshotted across the map they just might, I mean juuustt might played this game so much that they can hit those kinda shots with a 1x scope or an iron sight.
---
They do
---
/r/Beetlejuicing af
---
Yeah that what I was talking about, no need for clarification. "Caviera" is also very close to "Caveira", yet still unforgivable.
---
Find out in the next episode of Dragon Ball Z
---
Then do it only if the cav downed the person. Its not hard. If someone else than cav downed them then dont give auto interrogation.
---
It's a letter, bruh. Some keyboards have them.
---
yes that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm telling you. how many times do i have to tell you
---
Then you should watch Pro League, you might learn a thing or two.
---
I, for one, am super excited for the recent future.
---
Yes, and it was changed to 3 weeks for every season after Burn Horizon (Burn horizon was 2, Phantom Sight and every new season will be 3 weeks of testing). Announced during the year 4 panel at the Six Invitational 2019
---
You sound just like every kid on Xbox.
---
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre getting carried.‚Äù This is not a bad matchmaking queue. Somebody had a good game, that‚Äôs it. I bet you‚Äôre only happy when everybody in the lobby is the same rank. You can claim people are getting carried when there are silvers and below in your matchmaking with plats/golds.
---
Literally nothing was normal on this video lol
---
I‚Äôve played matches with my low bronze friends and finished below them, people have bad games, shit happens.
---
why do a challenge that's time consuming and offers no real value instead of playing a casual match that will probably end quicker and has more value?
---
I didn't say matchmaking was bad. I'm saying that the plats are boosted.
---
thxxxx :)
---
Literally hated the AK-12 for Fuze for some reason before I got Black Ice (My first Black Ice squee!) a week or so ago (I'm new, as well, lol) 
---
But now I'm prob never gonna change unless I really need to, used his LMG before and loved it. Literally he's my highest KDR and most played OP, I think still.
---
Needs more vodka tho
---
this is gross and part of the reason the game is dying
---
RiP clamors
---
Please give me
---
Ahh I see, thanks for sorting that confusion out
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have told you if i knew it was Gridlock. Jk
---
Brazil is still Latin America
---
Is this good? Still a kind of new player here
---
I just don‚Äôt understand what blitz was doing during hour of blindness where did he run off to
---
what software do you use to record?

---
My luck would be just the common pistol skins
---
Interesting. I haven't played in awhile but they used to hotfix glitches pretty much immediately. I find it hard to believe they've gotten that bad. I wouldn't be surprised if they removed D.va while fixing it but I'd need a source showing it took them a couple weeks.
---
League of legends also disabled stuff all the time when I played but it rarely lasted longer than a day.
---
Right! I main claymores a lot on attack and haven't been able to defend myself against run outs. Like sometimes I'll see them coming and other times, don't get so lucky.
---
Yeah, that would work, thanks for that addition.
---
And here I was thinking she‚Äôd find a gadget to shoot or something
---
The fact that I got runouts or spawn peaks in 9/10 of my last games shows that not only glitches are a problem of this game and now without claymores they don't even have to fear that they might die when doing it. And for that one last game I had no runouts, I then instead had idiot enemies that were writing stupid Nazi shit the entire time
---
They're not replying to you, they're replying to someone else within your comment thread
---
Cause fun = no no for Ubi.   weas the same shit when they had the "bug" that let you place a mira half on reinforced / soft walls.  was nice, was not game breaking, only had a few spots that it really was helpful in, but yaknow...fun detected.
---
Someone should take his own advice, huh?
---
I mean, you're right and you're wrong. It is Ubi's fault that these glitches are in the game, but glitches like this aren't exactly easy to fix. They come from a really convoluted exploitation of the game engine, and even figuring out how a glitch works code wise can take an extremely long time. Taking them out until they can be properly fixed, while really annoying, is the best way to handle the situation without it straight up ruining the game.
---
wow
---
My friend says if you continue to press forwards you will eventually break out but it might take awhile.
---
Zofia and Ela were released during the same time dude
---
IQ had a glitch where you could use the claymore to turn invisible.
---
Three minutes and all of your ammo
---
Or becomes a t hunt attacker with no team kill penalty.
---
The claymore one allowed the operator to turn invisible, which was done by forcing their model to stay in spawn. Only IQ could do it I think, but they just removed claymores altogether just to be safe
---
I guess so. People ban blitz quite a bit though
---
Test server boiiiiiii
---
Llooool put me in le screem shot wit el random thing on my name HaHaaaahahahahahahhaa lololololoooloo such epic much random

Does this work for console?

Better then a guy aimbotting after you crush his team the first round

Does anyone know why ping can't go lower than 9?

Hello VaykorMiP, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bwvjov/killsynch_montage_with_vigil/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Glad you were honest with us. Almost thought you were talking out of your ass...
---
Just trying to be helpful
---
It's really nice not being electrocuted by Clash all the time
---
? WDYM ?
---
Well accelerate just accelerated into first w this one
---
I think we should get all of the base operator elites first
---
Tell your friend to control his emotions
---
You recorded this so awfully i cant tell whats happening
---
Happened to me when I first started playing R6. There was a level 200+ Gold player on the enemy team completely destroying us going on a flawless win. Near the end when the rounds were tied I waited as Cav near one of the entrances and after I downed the player and realized it was that enemy, they left the game before I could interrogate them. It was a casual match lol
---
Yes doing a good job is hard work, and apparently Ubisoft does not like hard work.
---
Ubi plz gib back barricade
---
I miss it
---
I was ready to downvote if it was a skyrim meme
---
This is awesome!!
---
Did you not read it if they say where I‚Äôm at obviously I‚Äôm not pro league like you and I can‚Äôt kill 5 people with one mag
---
That‚Äôs literally 10 seconds of ping
---
You‚Äôre right how silly of me. Maybe I should have looked at the website or their Twitter and Instagram. I could just have browsed deep into a sub reddit filled with fan art, clips, complaints, glitches, tips, etc. Why didn‚Äôt I think of this before?
---
It‚Äôs not a stupid question it‚Äôs an honest and simple question. A question that could have just been simply answer by just saying ‚ÄúJune 11th‚Äù. Which may or may not be the correct date because I haven‚Äôt seen an OFFICIAL announcement. Which they hardly ever do because anything could happen between now and June 11th
---
I am disgusted that I miss dropshots.

I know glitches aren't easy to fix. Believe me, however if it can be done on all the other competitive games it can be done on this one too. They aren't an indie company. [Do you even know how much Ubisoft makes?](https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/comsite_common/en-US/images/06ddr%20final%20version_tcm99-330429_tcm99-196733-32.pdf) If they're selling yearly passes, skins, and loot boxes, they can fix glitches faster instead of removing key equipment from the game for a month.
