What

Let me try

---
Crutch.

Looks like I got it right 
---
Well if your fed up, might as well be fed up with corn
---
Do you enjoy corn?
---
__I think you meant to say "my friends cousin drew this and thinks shes bad at drawing and will commit suicide if her drawing dont get 3 million upvotes"__
---
So what’s your initial thoughts and reaction towards corn?

corn?

No but I like corn
---
Do you like corn?
---
Corn is pretty good
---
Treat yourself to some corn
---
Sure, what are your thoughts on corn tho?
---
Then do it
---
It sucks, congratulations.
---
With a little butter fresh corn pretty good but honestly canned sweet corn is really nice
---
Sounds great, thanks dude
---
mira has the L
---
Sometimes you gotta send it. Well done lad!
---
Um it’s cool, not my favourite food but it’s ok, I don’t like how my poop looks like after tho
---
Great job winning
---
What do you think of corn though?
---
More like since the release of the game. It's why I quit playing, that shit isnt fun 
---
Fucking plot twist 
---
If you were corn I would eat you
---
Yes but the reticle is a bit obstructive making the timing of the shot more difficult. 
---
Oh true
---
Don't get frustrated if you die a lot in the beginning. This game took me months to learn when I first started, but quickly became my most played game when I started to get the hang of it. Some people who will be jerks to new players, but that's a small minority from my experience. There are plenty of people who will show you how to properly set up site if you ask, and as many others have commented, Get_Flanked and Varsity Gaming are great YouTube channels to help you learn the game faster. Good luck and have fun! 
---
Yup, the food
---
Why
---
Thatcher's emp disables articles, so that helped a bit I would guess. Hlshot was already lined up, as soon as the light is obstructed, you open fire
---
&gt;What do you think of corn though?
---
Corn is great
---
awesome same here did it ever fix itself?
---
Jabaited
---
This would look cooler without the kids
---
I approve of this wholesome way to deny an interrogation.
---
Illusion 100
---
Thank you, Blitz is definetly annoying to fight but. Well. There aren't many things to say in the other regard.
---
 Was there an EMP involved tho?
---
Why use Jackal's pdw? His other primary is much better statistically.
---
And then if I want to play ranked with my friend to help him get better? You improve by playing with and against better people and also people want to play with their friends regardless of their rank.
---
That was pretty awesome. Great work!
---
Play with him on a smurf
---
What about people who don’t have smurfs, also if I as a plat played on a smurf against silvers, wouldn’t that be the same thing that you were complaining about?
---
This personally insults me.
---
yeah, we had strats into beating realistic using exploits the whiners complained about (ie; shield in the middle of windows)
---
there's also spawn trapping the terrorists with claymores, c4, elecrified wires, and gu mines.
---

Who is playing the sax!
---
Might be a visual bug, pretty sure they wouldn’t take that out 
---
You are right, play casual 
---
Ever seen copper 4 on console?
---
fuck dude...
---
I gotta say, yall just sent my ego through the roof. 
---
Holy shit you got me so good

You can’t improve casual, also I haven’t played casual in 5 months

Haha

One of my friends (WELLMANMATTOON) he takes request too.

Good speech there, I’m still going to spawn peek with while the hell I wanna be

I do this to downed players in casual

Okay, I am sick of your shenanigans.

Title. Is uh?

Woah! Staring to change up the facts a little bit! I can understand, don’t want to give away that much more brilliance! But it looks like the student now becomes the master! You are starting to take my advice, not giving away these juicy tips &amp; tricks! I hope one day I can aspire to be like you with those crazy Army skills! I sure wasted my time and money going to a University and getting my degree! Who knew a GED and the Army is all I needed I guess to live the ultimate life! Must be so nice just playing Paintball and R6 all day! Not a care in the world, except the next time you are going to be deployed! Ahhh such a great life that must be! I am truly envious! Like I said we can be a team! Get this money and get to Diamond together!

Sad I wanted a nip flare
---
&gt; lol shut up retard
---
“work” too, I have thick fingwrs 
---
This honestly isn't funny.
---
The  C1  it has low recoil and decent damage. Its just my favorite gun to use 
---
Will you be there tomorrow? A friend who goes by Lazy Chaos was dressed up as another Jäger and she says she saw you but couldn't catch you
---
I have so many questions for the other team lol
---
But he literally painted it though...
---
F
---
Literally this is 50% of kills in burnt horizon 
---
Agreed. But I gave myself a goal to earn enough specifically for it. It made it fun. 
---
Lmao you probably think Jager and Bandit need ACOGS again
---
Yes
---
I was talking about the carbine, and yes I wish elas scorpion was a lot better, I don’t even want the impacts back anymore, Please Ubi!
---
Did y'all meet my goofy friend dressed as Jäger with the missing ACOG sign? &lt;3
---
She just doesn't use Reddit much
---
I usually just play Insurgency or something when no friends are available for Siege. If you are playing Casual, dont bother making callouts. Most of the times people dont listen. Yes, it feels great to get callouts, but certain people are total toxic assholes especially in Asia
---
The MK46 is a variant, not a designation, it's used by the Airborne Division and I picked it for that reason. The M9 once again is an Airborne Divisions standard sidearm, and the PRB92 is a relic anyways and stopped being produced in 82 or somewhere around there, don't remember. It's not my fault that Ubisoft is bad at picking weapons for their CTUs. The irritant I get yeah, it's very comparable to the fire bolts, but I'm once again not happy with them and want them replaced. What is don't understand is how a cover destroying grenade similar to soft breaching device when I specifically said it can't bust walls.
---
She a legit fat tranny.
---
Did a games was 8/1/1 so i guess im going to use it now 
---
Kinda like how echo and twitch fight except all you can do is jump straight up
---
i know you probably hear this a lot but,
---
queue with a 5 man ?
---
like go on maybe the siege official discord or websites.
---
doesn’t happen as much on pc but that’s probably because I’m a rank
---
are you by any chance maybe around copper?
---
because I’ve heard about a lot of people throwing in low ranks 
---
A general rule of thumb would be NATO 1 speeds 
---
That's pure fat from pants size.....The strongest people in the world would fail military weight and height standards....She would be a lot bigger if she was a strongman....she looks like a washed bar maid with a lot of cellulite under her arms....
---
I don’t know how to, but on the frame the second shot is fired it’s on his head
---
How did Ying get knifed so fast ?
---
She was afk at the start of the video.
---
Clapped, but u ADS'd on the first guy so idk
---
Lol please tell me you saw zirtun’s aim. Lmao the kid looks like he uses a Nintendo 64 controller. 
---
People who leave early gets a lose, loses ELO and is banned from ranked for some time, as well as having a renown gain reduction
---
Ahaha same I solo queue all the time my uplay name is literally i.-soloqueue
---
I do agree with you though
---
Good for you
---
good job for doing it in a cas
---
Bam boom my guy coming up with ingenious ideas 
---
some time? lol its 15 minutes dude, thats less than the duration of one match. Doesnt scale up either, which is why people do it so often. 
---
So do yoy have this problem too?
---
Nah we are high gold. We had a three stack, but it is a shame that 2 people can join and ruin an entire match. 
---
Thought that was doc, whoops
---
Ok. 
---
*PRONE SPAM INTENSIFIES*
---
Map pool doesn’t work unless running lone wolf.  Found that out the hard way working on getting the defender achievement. 
---
Where's mousesports?
---
I like the way you think 
---
Lol
---
Congrats!
---
which means, he should make it more prominent. 
---
great photo!
---
Na na na na na only for a split second xx
---
Didn't get top12 last Six Invitationals 
---
Wait, who can?
---
it doesn't scale up? wow no wonder ranked is still beta
---
too bad most would be like "muh wait times tho". Look, maybe its because I played back when 15 minute waits were considered fast but once again, If I could actually for fucking once get a 10 man match I would gladly wait 5 minutes for a match. 
---
Sooooo many console players just try copy some youtubers sens that is way too high for them to handle. One of my friends basically doubled his k/d after we told him his sens was too high. 
---
nope not on higher ranks - griefing I had a lot of in like bronze - silver 
---
Copper and bronze 4s in a nutshell.
---
The mk46/m249 and prb92/m9 would be functionally and visually almost identical in-game, that's why I'm making the comparison. Don't blame ubi, they're both commonly used weapons. 
---
If the cover destroying device can't destroy soft walls then why should it be picked over zofia or ash's gadgets? If you're trying to flush out anchors from behind 'soft' cover then why not just shoot through it?
---
yeah good luck my man 
---
im sorry about it you know siege community is one of the most toxic 
---
*Surrendering wont save you this time.*
---
My favorite part is how a mans name is meganut 
---
lower you go, the more detrimental is is to actually have comms on. The closest thing you get to a callout is " oh they have a n** on their team" (castle)
---
r/undeservedblackice
---
Just be gooder😉duh. Rook mine btw.
---
game’s not even realistic at all
---
It is more so than other fps
---
Also is Maverick really that bad
---
Who else noticed Jäger has an ACOG?
---
It was so bad I just switched to Xbox; didn’t realize it was the game that fucked my system; thought Sony just sucked sack lol
---
Spamming that wall when its unreinforced isnt unheard of and i often shoot small bursts into softwalls if i think its possible somebody is there
---
Just got my preschool shot up. Big time nostalgia 😂
---
He means playing ranked strats, crouch spamming, uncontestable angles, etc.
---
People need to chill out
---
Pick 1v1 one gun fights more often
---
I was behind the chair, not the wall. 
---
Again. Trying to win? Or should they just tk, leave, or let the enemy kill them
---
Just chiming in a little late here- I’ve had 2 recent examples where I was farther from a door/opening than the opponent, but opponent saw half my body including head, I saw a sliver or less of their arm. It’s not normal perspective, and it’s an issue currently this season that I haven’t seen prior. 
---
I think ubi forgot the fact that the attackers are supposed to have better weapons
---
Pizza time stops
---
If I flip the pizzas Mrs. Alibi will flip out
---
Good edit but...
---
If it's a baked pizza, why is he putting it in the oven?
---
Or
---
If it just finished baking, why is he pulling it out with bare hands?
---
Yep. Twice this week for me. 
---
Ya Ubisoft aint got no time for that. Not that i don't agree, but I highly doubt they'll ever do anything about it tbh.
---
Gridlock not even OP lol
---
the 2 headahot thing comprimise the thing where siege is best at which is realism.
---

Nice an 11 second ace 
---
Meh, even long time ash mains such as myself would agree she needed a nerf, the pick rate was simply too high. I just dont think removing the acog was the right was to go about it. Seems like ubisoft thought, " oh well removing one line of code is easy and will make her picked less". But ash is still fundamentally broken as an r6 operating. High gold or above really arent affected by this change. Imo of course 
---
Dude, thank you so much!
---
You forgot to add the part where 2 people start screaming in chat at the people still alive to just run into the objective, and then they groan loudly when they get killed. 
---
No problem, i would ask though, what system do you play on?
---
Seeing pizza and siege in one place instantly makes me think of AnthonyPit1
---
No. I played solo t-hunt until my mates finished their match.
---
It's not photo shopped, nice try tho :)
---
This has got to be the dumbest post of the season, and it's been just a month.
---
PC and PS4 
---
Sounds like you're playing Ela wrong.
---
I personally think it's blasphemy to depict the lord in that manner.
---
But I appreciate the sentiment
---
Hes using a shovel to get it out, you can see the Pizza is in another, smaller pan and not the one hes holding
---
Probably thought Cav was trying to interrogate him.
---

You're late, I'm not paying for those.
---
*Caveira*....
---
Wut
---
Yeah, you barely are born into a world of pain. Get a three digit level and you shouldnt be tkd and kicked anymore in casual.
---
Ah, thanks for clarifying! :D 
---
If they would release a year 3 operator bundle I could use my renown on fun things too.
---
No I just started to get back into the game a couple days ago hadn't played in like a month since then
---
There is a local pizza place here called Maestro pizza which I find ironic
---
Idk maybe a 3 speed with a smaller shield that can ram through barricades and soft walls.
---
Yeah thanks genius bar
---
Shooting through walls is a thing, you know that, right?
---
It's the way this quote was "meant" to be said. 
---
Just report him, seriously. He won't stop on his own, it's what kids of his age usually do.
---
Sorry new to the game, how do you get diamond and black ice? Packs or do you have to do something?
---
Nice😂
---
I feel like I'm that IQ 90% of the time
---
I see people use pulse quite often tbh
---
I think he's too difficult to play right for the casual player
---
on the right side of the picture , unless you're gonna r/wooosh me 
---
makes sense, if i ever spawnpeak ill probably use rook now 
---
I'm on console and never see anyone use him
---
I am as well. Depends on gamemode too, I’d imagine secure players don’t use pulse too much.  I don’t use him much because I don’t like the fire rate on his gun honestly.
---
He was my first op, kicked ass since I got him too. 
---
just smh
---
How does it have anything to do with Siege?
---
Paper, Ink and Plastics :D
---
Not really sure about that....
---
I think Frost is the best choice though cause it looks correct regardless of the position of your arm. 
---
All this says is that humans are garbage. It's nothing new, inspirational or even remotely intelligent.
---
low key, one of you sounds like mordecai from regular show
---
It's way easier on console...
---
Same happened to me with IQ as character but alibi’s weapons. 
---
aLsO SaMe uNiVerSe
---
you do know bodies can lay up against a wall?
---
Lion is real good and so is mozzie but I’m just saying that cause I main them, I did use Maverick for a bit but found that when you come up against good players as soon as you peek your hole you get one tapped. His 3 speed is still pretty good tho. I don’t know about the others as I don’t have them
---
I can only imagine 
---
/u/vredditdownloader
---
Man why so toxic
---
Lion is getting a big nerf not worth i guess

[x] Doubt
---
Ah oh well, tbh tho it’s more about how you play not which characters are deemed good you just need to look at the characters and match it to your style of play
---
Because they don’t want to kill Doc and Rook
---
Dont make a singular hole. Do lines like bandit 
---
better idea...
---
Don't be an idiot, don't peek and get good enough at the game where you can kill the enemy in an actual fair gun fight.
---
But bandit does drugs not holes
---
But it will balance them a little. They are now more dangerous then glaz!
---
Bandit does lines.....of coke......
---
Yeh but once they notice it, it’s kinda pointless 
---
Team Equipment -10
---
then you understand.🙃
---
You cant peek 10 holes at once. Maverick is literally wack-a-mole.
---
Phahaha I guess your right, I’m just playing with him wrong then 
---
Yeah i have a squad but they havent been on since were busy with school &amp; work. The community on ps4 sucks cus no one responds or send an invite after asking for one
---
It has returned, be careful because can kill you... 
---
Because r6 is CPU based game and you have better GPU but worse CPU. Try raising your graphics(seems stupid, but it seems to help me) 
---
That might be the most contradicting comment ever. Console is harder because it's slower paced. :thinkingface:
---
Yes this is definitely fair
---
You plugged your hdmicable on your graphics card and not on your motherboard?
---
I can confirm 
---
The lights should be RGB instead of normal white lights. This can give other viewers computer blindness. 
---
They’re missions in wildlands where you work with rainbow more specifically twitch, valk and Caveira, it gives more lore to Cav and it’s pretty cool to see them actually having conversations rather than just deployment voice lines. There’s also a splinter cell crossover where Michael ironside reprises his role as Sam Fisher’s voice actor and a ghost recon future soldier prequel kinda crossover thing. There’s even a predator crossover where you get to fight one in the jungle.
---
5 damage per 0.5 would be better I think
---
'Tis God's way
---
It is, wasn't there like some dlc or some event (I dont play wildlands&amp;division) where there were a few r6s operators in that game? Maybe I am wrong, only play r6s
---
Interesting concept. Anyways though, I'd rather have the pistol to be the TEC-9, which is a Swedish pistol. Semi-auto or automatic are both acceptable though imo.
---
That would mean having a productive update.
---
They are tho. Why do you think they’re all in the Tom Clancy name? GR: Wildlands in a sense confirmed they share the same universe. The Predator dlc was just for fun, but the other crossovers are more than crossovers. Through out the games there are still references linking to the other TC games. Like that building for example is one of many I’ve seen. Just think outside the box and be a lil optimistic :)
---
You have to wait for the timer anyway though? 
---
next time use a white font
---
wait until May, the game will go on sale for 70% off. You can pick up the advanced edition for $14-16 CAD I believe
---
Technically no, this map was created as a "Non spawnpeekable" map, but there's more than 2 ways to spawnpeek.
---
The timer cuts down to 2 seconds if everyone in the lobby has selected an op.
---
That’s some nice download speed you got there
---
I can see why you would think that but not being able to move or turn fast if your an attacker trying to rush does make it harder. Whereas on pc you can see a big difference in the pace compared to console...
---
Sorry, there is no “Standard Edition” on consoles. Not anymore.  
---
Good
---
Report toxic behaviour each time you get killed in the obj 
---
Wasn't even download speed based, the update had downloaded at that point 
---
You hear Fuze's grenades just thunk thunk thunk closer to you 
---
Just go into terrorist Hunt?
---
Pkay The game with The Guns... Yisses
---
Omg i love this,his eyes are so gentle❤❤❤
---
I like the figure so much I want it early. But I cant do that so I drew it instead to a semi okay degree.
---
Well I mean, they're both Tom Clancy games so it's not that hard to believe that they would be in the same universe. And it depends of you believe that every ubisoft game is connected.
---
A single grenade says different
---
Hello aslmate, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b7bahh/drone_disappearing_bug_followed_by_an_ace/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Fuck you that shit pisses me off
---
Also there's the fact that Villa, a rainbow six map, has the assassin's Creed logo on one of its fountain. Supposedly the villa was owned by an ancient Italian crime family
---
zofia
---
We just have to take his word for it
---
Thank you so much!
---
The division isn’t in the same universe
---
I never had tc1 on pc and it seemed to run fine on Xbox, but it was capped at 30fps so maybe that’s why, forza 6 on Xbox ran at 60fps with way better graphics though so 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
So, Yokai and Gu camouflage are Predator Tech?
---
Far cry 3 had an Easter egg revolving around an old abstergo facility where they were looking for a piece of eden on the island
---
Say that again, I dare you. I double dare you. 
---
It's not nice but the only way you can get that skin is grinding soo I guess that gives you somewhat bragging rights that other skins can't give you
---
That does mean the company’s Washington
---
If they do a sequel I want it in West Africa 
---
Doc gets picked more than Rook for spawn peeking *due to* his gadget. If he fails the peek but survives, he just stimms himself and it's effectively as if nothing happened. He's wasted utility, but it's hard to use utility in Siege because of the fast TTK.
---
Do agree, just freaking pick Rook if you're gonna try it. That way you were still somewhat useful by increasing overall odds of surviving a gunfight for your entire team that took your plates. I'm just explaining the logic behind why Doc.
---
Echo/Maestro I have *no idea*. Too valuable alive than dead to be worth taking a risk that's not hard for Attackers to counter.
---
Yeah i guess
---
ReCoIl BuFf
---
laughs in your face for not being able to recoil control
---
Tbf, forza is very closed track too, there's a lot more needed in an open world engine the size of the crew. I went from 60fps 1080 on my 7850 and phenom to 720p 40-20fps on it after the wild run dropped. Upgraded processor got my resolution up but the frames still dropped.
---
I am the pulse in the picture, thank you to everyone who joined our little R6 convoy and walked around with us at Pax, we had so much fun! 
---
Why?
---
Iq sucks
---
man, what kind of fucking retarded analysis or reading comprehension do you people have here.
---
I said it comes out NORMAL and has no glitch on HIS SIDE
---
“... and all people.”
---
Came here looking for this. High five.
---
Or hitting surrender after losing the first round. 
---
game breaking
---
I don't spam it like how toxic people spam
---
I went off of the in game model, which does have hair. Kind of a cop out, but I didn't want to be full bald
---
How do you get that main thing 
---
If you main Castle then you don’t do this
---
That was the same for the deployable shield before Ubi fixed it. If you didnt have grenades or breach rounds, you weren't getting into that window which also forced you to use a gadget itself 
---
If you Teamkill a Teamkiller then you are only adding to the toxicity.

I once pulled this off in house living room with a kapkan trap, scared the shit outta the cav lol (who plays cav on house anyways?)
---
*shoots the head*
---
LOREEEEEEEE
---
You can change how the assists handle apparently, which was why the demo seemed like garbage in terms of control, because the assists are buried in menus.
---
Fine by me
---
He just broke the shield and still couldnt get in. Did you watch the video? 
---
good job you can use inspect element

On the cob is where its at. Makes you really have to work for it

there is a headgear and a matching weapon skin, all legendary as well!

U actually shot my alibi and now i shoot u
---
That’s going to affect her hItBoX lmao
---
Also stopped buying the Season Pass once I realized that I only needed like 1 (of the 2 ops) normally. 
---
got proven wrong? Huhhhh where? No one just realized what the fucking problem is and has 0 to reading comprehension and doesn't care because who the fuck likes shield anyway, besides shield mains?  
---
And yes, fucking people in Reddit barely seem to care about problems but rather just think it's another meme or shit. I see Matimio talking about the camera angle problem, I see other cases too. welp, you know credibility and trusting professional words.

Exactly.

No, no it isn’t
---
Im going for it too, just hit 88k, is it worth it?
---
seems about right
---
Im liking the idea of having an attacking cav almost as a direct counter to cav but i think mixing cav and vigil into 1 pile of shit is stupidly broken
---
It still doesn’t compare to forza though
---
His later videos kinda sucked tbh. I started to miss his "story time" videos. I'm pretty sure those videos were what made him so popular, originally, anyway.

I think all Tom Clancy games are in the same universe if I’m not mistaken

So Team Rainbow got hold of alien tech, decided to apply them to a Roomba and needles with Mountain Dew. I see where the priorities are at.

Oh well played my favorite defender is prob lesion or mozzi and fav attacker is prob gridlock

How does this make siege a battle royale?

It all makes sense now.
---
You shouldn't of used a black font its pretty hard to read.
---
This is like an unofficial thing, Ubisoft loosely tying all its games together as if they are part of the same universe. I think I remember watching a game theory episode on it at one point. It's just a neat way of disguising the fact they are borrowing assets from other titles. 
---
To say that you care about a frost logo of ubisoft game with out a story or smth you seem like 16yo if you arent than dont act like anyway ur body ur memories do what ever the fck you want have a nice day
---
terrible idea.
---
Well you have to consider the fact that Tom Clancy is it's own IP. Think of other games that included mentions/references of other games. Master Chief in Fable, entirely non-canon and was killed, was merely just an easter egg. If they had attempted to suddenly say "Oh hey this is canon now" despite them not owning that IP, but being affiliated under the same company (Microsoft), there could certainly be problems with the parent company (Bungie and other). That said, not all inclusions of characters in other games are canon. Do you think that Final Fantasy easter egg in AC Origins is canon? If it is, that'd open a huge mess storyline wise for the entire Ubiverse.

The crew may have a bigger map but it feels really empty to me, and again the car roster just isn’t great, most of the cars are the same thing just a different variation for a different kind of racing. It would be cool if forza had motorcycles and dirt bikes though. 
---
Doxxing?

That gem skin, Turquoise or somet?
---
How is it NOT Ubisoft's fault? This is a SILVER player, playing against a DIAMOND. Ubi needs to put players of similar rank in matches with each other, especially in a ranked game.
---
Actually in the video game industry it always certain if a company are in two game own by the same company means it is connected in someway

No it couldn’t have he is an Italian touching a pizza 🍕 I

Ok thanks it's a cool skin though(not as good as black ice of course)

like ive always said, this game is flawless. ⬆exhibit a⬆
---
their matchmaking is "equal out the ranks and it'll be fair"
---
how is it not their fault if their mm is completely flawed? maybe if they did what overwatch do and stop people in diamond playing with anyone below plat?

At least he tried.

same here

And ninja turtles, raving rabbits, and King Kong,

i get that, but i cant enjoy the game with MY friends in MY legit rank a lot of the time because this stuff is consistently happening and just ruins the whole game for me. The people doing it arent doing this to play with friends, they're doing it to ruin everyone elses games

Yeap, R6 right now.

They’ll never notice

A lot of games have healing mechanics, not just battle royale games

You've got the 100% cpu bug im sure of it, and thats because you got a quadcore (4 threads) i5. You need more cores, also yours is going pretty low speed 3,10ghz.

I've got the i7 4790k at 4,6ghz and i've got the bug (4 cores 8 threads).

**TLDR: Its your cpu, game needs a pretty beefy cpu**

Yeah it’s pretty damn cool
---
Unrealistic game play is different... They slapped an Aussie flag on the shoulder of a fat operator after caving to demands from journalists who don't even play the game to be more inclusive. It's just like when EA's BfV went full SJW depicting ww2 as some inclusive shit show.
---
A character is 25k, maybe it should be more like 50 or 75k
---
don't hav enough 🅱️one to rebuttal 
---
I mean, it worked...😂
---
Of course the toxic one has to be around silvers below lmao
---
There's a weapon skin that costs 90 000 renown so an elite would cost like 150 000 renown.
---
*cousin
---
Someone else pointed out Wildlands got a recent update that makes radios talk about the Division 2 events. Ubi is trying to make the more recent ones be in the same universe.
---
The division 1 is based on new york and bank is based on...?
---
agree with you on that one so people either grind or pay real money for that one cosmetic
---
then maybe those 3 plat 1's don't deserve that rank
---
LOL, yeah. Him and Ash were sharing that Italian ice that he's holding.
---
how about it depends on how old the skin is like if it came out when red crow was released it should be 50k
---
Wut?
---
This clip is almost a year old. I used to be terrible at aiming with a controller so I started with a low sensitivity and slowly raised it. Tbh I'm still really bad with controllers 😂.
---
I think the issue lies in two places:
---
1. Noobs that are too stubborn to recognize their own flaws
---
2. Players that want the ego boost that comes from being on top, no matter the difficulty of getting there
---
It's when those two clash that we get stuff like OP. Granted, they're the extremes, but they're the ones making the noise.
---
Exactly
---
and newer ones should be 100k
---
Never have I lost because of a gu mine because I’m a good player and am able to get hit by one but wait until he pushes thinking I’m taking it out ... just get gud
---
I don't think spawnkilling should be out of the question in every fps since it depends on the disadvantage you're at when caught by surprise. In siege at least it seems to create an unintended gameplay dichotomy. Like ok we're supposed to get inside and accomplish XYZ, but sometimes the bad guys come out and shoot us too. And it's realistic and reasonable but also disruptive to what I would assume is the original flow of gameplay, and in a way negatively impacts map design inside the obj building. But technically spawnpeeking is bad strategically anyway since you're in a predictable spot yet it's still enabled because noobs fall for it. Nobody is willing to admit that memorizing spots to prefire when you spawn is a stupid part of gameplay and doesn't make learning the game interesting.
---
IQ. Drone. Just look around. Meh, why any gamer think op is problem just coz he cannot win it?
---
Hear*
---
This happened to me once but I was jackal and got team killed. I had hop in and tell those idiots it's not even an option for him..
---
Juan Deag 
---
and how is this not a major problem that needs to be addressed
---
You can also see Gu mines as an attacker whilst droning.
---
Damn that sucks, I also played on a shitty pc with ping that skyrocketed to the thousands, I also get that playing against higher people spamming shit is annoying, I guess the only way to make both parties happy is to make it so you can select if you wanna play against your own rank or against people that together equal your rank.
---
I have all the ops so it would still be easy to get free skins at 100k+ renown and they cost like 20$ and it doesn't change the gameplay so I don't know.
---
Yeah I have a headset so that probably helps
---
He just got a nerf
---
No. The elites aren't changing gameplay in any way. They're entirely cosmetic options. I see no reason why they should be free with renown. Ubi already let's you do that with new operators. They should be able to make some extra money off something in game. 
---
kinda does with the mvp animation and you gotta think that famous ytbers dont always grind on siege so should at least be 50k renown
---
Urban dictionary does seem to say it's an insult https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=-%2F%2F%2F- (see definition #2) 
---
I don't see how that's ubi's problem. This game is already a blessing in the sense you don't need to use real money for new operators. 
---
FUCK THE DIVISION-every terrorist ever
---
e division

Dont know German, would a translation be available

2 seconds of latency, damn

fair points but i wouldnt spend that amount of money for a cosmetic and on console it is very rare to see people with elites

There are a few Clancy books not in the jack ryan / john clark universe like Red Storm Rising 
---
He keeps being nerfed, and he isn't op. Against a good lesion, he can seem op. But against a bad lesion, he's just a bit annoying
---
Smaller hit box
---
Get wrekt kid
---
Geez man not my boy lesion. Having spent a lot if time playing him, I dont thing hes broken or op. Firstly he gets 8 not 7 mines. He starts with 1 and gains 1 every 30 up to 8 total mines. To get his full amount of mines he has to survive till the near end of the round. He has to venture out to throw his mines, making placing them dangerous at times. They are visible if you look for the shimmer just like echo drones. He may seem godly at times, but can you name many operators who haven't totally crushed you and your team? His mines greatest potential (in my opinion) are more as proximity alarms. He can see where his mines are and when they go off he knows someone is there. My team and I have gotten more kills from my callouts about triggered mines than the mines themselves. I play lesion almost every round that I defend and my friends usually play roamers. He's very useful I'll give you that but not overpowered by any means.
---
This reddit is one of the friendliest I subscribe to. Sure there are the minority of toxic people, but you can almost always have constructive conversations with just about anyone. Siege is complicated and getting more complicated every season, making the line between op and weak subjective. Yeah lions op... but even he has counters or at least will soon. So this is my cordial invitation for you to learn from the excellent community that makes up the majority of siege rather than blame your failures on the game. Sometimes, you're just outplayed. Theres always someone better than you out there, so learn from them. 
---
Happy gaming my dude.

You can always see them a bit, in the drone it is just easier because they are closer

On some surfaces you can still see the bluring of the floor caused by the Gu-Mine.

Lol I figured you would pull that one, the amount of  free v bucks you get in a season to r6 wouldn't get you shit till a couple seasons in and you still probably wouldn't have enough for that elite , also for buying the pass you get some r6 bonus if you wanted it for "free" should saved all the free r6 through all the saesons
---
I know I thought it would be complicated if I put Echo and Maestro twice on the list 
---
Ubi obviously knows how popular black ice is (that's why it's not universal anymore) so why dont they release black ice skins for new guns?

it's called overtime

His ability is not a direct roamer ability

After getting to level 220 I think this game is honestly shit
---
The community is full of shitheads, the servers are trash, and there are so many things broken.

Unless you play with friends, it's the worst fucking game in existence. So my advice is get some buddies online and meme in casual
---
More like at least 250k renown. I get 25k renown like every week. And you can buy ALL BUT LIKE 10 COSMETICS WITH RENOWN. Not counting legendary items, black ice. Elites are supposed to reward the people who support the game by giving them 15 bucks. Not to mention they change nothing in your gameplay
---
Details

Their abilities are not direct roamer abilities. Of course, anyone can roam

But that would confuse new players

The free v-bucks from fortnite doesn't really have any worth since you'll have to play for months to get 1k in that sense if R6 did something similar for premium you would probably be able to get that elite skin for free in about 2 years, also I feel like you will complain about something like this cause your not getting what you want for free 
---
Serious? I missed the update, need to check, thanks for letting me know about it.

We know that the AC universe is in the R6 universe. And if the R6 and FH universes could never be the same, then neither could the AC and FH universes. AC takes place on Earth with real events such as the crusades. FH is a completely fictional world.

Stay away. Matchmaking has never been worse, new lean system has you getting killed without even seeing the other player. Audio bugs like no voice chat every time you play. Ranked still in beta btw. Year 4, everybody. Mainly though, matchmaking is the worst it has ever been. I've hit plat consistently the past few seasons and have been in gold 1 once for two games so far. No exaggeration when I say we play high plat/diamond teams 7 out of 10 games, and we have two G2s as our higher ranks. Its ridiculous how awful it has gotten. 
---
The key is to find the balance between taking it seriously and enjoying the ridiculous nature of if all. I mean, do try to play seriously, do try to win, and do try to user brain. But don't forget that you're here to have fun, and it's okay to have a chuckle over the bullshitery that'll inevitably happen. 
---
Someone on your team aced? Wow, they got wrecked. Someone on their team aced? GG, GJ, WP, we're gonna get even now.

Cough* “boys report for toxic behaviour and team kill him each round because he didn’t choose black ice”
---
 I think Maestro is my new main becouseof this picture.
---
Exactly why I stopped playing the game months ago.

Why can't they be?

Could it not be a game made by Abstergo?

Or perhaps the events of For Honor did happen in the ubisoft universe version of earth.

u/i-shoud-be-recalled

Also, just take out "Roamer" as a group, because literally any operator can be a roamer, Vigil and Cav should be in info gathering, and Alibi is basically a trap operator, thats what i would do anyway, i feel Roamer is too vague of a title, like, literally any operator can roam, and the only operator that i would says SOLE PURPOSE is roaming, is Vigil, but only having one op in a group wouldnt make sense
---
UNLESS, you add more 3 speeds to the roaming category, so, put Ela in the Roamer category, then put Alibi in the trap caregory (as in, have her in Roaming AND traps, same with Ela)
---
because i saw you out Maestro and Echo twice so i was confused to see ither operators not be used the same way

Ubisoft Earth is the same earth as real earth, FH is completely different continents, though FH being an abstergo project could be true...
---
In what category (the first thing not the planting part)
---
Ok thank you
---
Your assumption is correct my dude
---
I hate outback. Villa is just okay. Both just our opinions
---
Where does that drone hole even lead to? I've played this game since operation velvet shell and I don't think I've ever noticed that drone hole
---
Isn't the backstory in FH about a cataclysm that caused the continents to come closer together or something like that? 
---
You don’t have to be mean about it :’(
---
That would increase queue times though. 
---
Probably in June 
---
This is actually a pretty good idea
---
1-10 how good was it?
---
Even better use echo or even maestro, but place your cams first. Even if you die you've given your team extra intel with your cams as long as you set then up first. 
---
Must still be in newcomer playlist. Bless him

Kind of, the world also had food scarcity issues, causing the century long wars

But now it’s literally everyone using them, so every rank is messed up with chalet

Report button in game does absolutely nothing, isn't even tied to toxic behavior bans. A lot of people seem to get confused about Reddit being the place to report stuff, but at least he is putting the word out there that this exists. This is insanely annoying, especially in ranked where it will put your team at a disadvantage. 
---
Could always move to Gridlocke. Because you're Sledge also swaps out to Jackal or Thermite, you'll mostly be missing out on an anti-roam or soft breach, which is where Grid comes in. Anti roam potential + soft breach with the shotgun.
---
Did it not explode? Don’t have audio rn, assumed he ran right past it.
---
Does teamkilling him first make you any better tho?
---
Calm down johnny
---
Someone just report him to Ubisoft or I will
---
I am relatively newer, but it makes sense to decrease crouch walking audio loudness so roamers aren’t as easily counterable.

How do you get 0 recoil on guns??? Is that even legitimate??? 
---
Yeah cool concept definitely, I love all the concepts on this sub, just like to offer an alternate viewpoint.
---
That depends. Do you have other dlc ops that you play in attack/defend or are they your first ones? If you have a dlc op in attack for example you should get frost because you already have an attacker and vice versa
---
Wildlands is also connected to Watch Dogs 2 through a vehicle brand present in both games. 
---
Not a bad idea but... What about attackers? They don't spawn until after the prep phase and what would stop the person wanting to TK after 40 seconds of waiting?

This was the very last one I got before platinum it took forever, I got it by using a drone to lure someone to the wall lmao 
---
Get Hibana, she is a hard breacher and she is more important to the team. Frost is great for aggressive attackers that don't check the floor. Other than that she isn't great. With Hibana, you can get hatches and walls. The Type-89 is one of the best guns on the game and the bearing-9 sidearm is amazing (if you can control the recoil). I personally don't have Frost so this is purely speculation.
---
This literally just inspires people to smurf or tank their rank to do this to others. 
---
And this is the same sub that tells ubi to fix matchmaking after posting a pic of plats matching up against bronze and silvers.

Thank you

Why bb so chubby
---
ohhh ok, makes sense.. im dumb and tought there was more to it.  
---
do you have like a todo list of planned features?
---
Your 2nd gadget/utility pictures (nade,breaching charge, impact nade, c4, etc) are very confusing even to year 1 player like me. I guess leaving it out is the better way. But your operators  classification is quite spot on for most part
---
What? You got two legendaries and two black ices, yet don’t have all the ops? I’m lvl 108 and still only got one black ice (smoke shotty). Legendaries are easier to get (I almost have full legendaries for Jager so yay)
---
Yeah true
---
I have Ela maverick and the base operators 
---
You’d be surprised, a lot of newer players don’t, and some players are too afraid to talk (squeakers and girl gamers mostly). I’d say most casual/low ranked players have no mics.
---
\-Adds replay &gt; Server crash &gt; Fix server &gt; Rank reset &gt; Breaks maps &gt; Fix maps &gt; Removes replay

Seems about right lol  
---
But on a serious note i would love a replay feature like most other games have.
---
There was a first batch that had Thermite and a few others in it, these are the second batch pre-orders.

Yeah, R6 hates microphones for some reason. Maybe try updating your audio drivers?
---
You can turn it off on PC if it's too hard for you to ignore people
---
Yea, i plan on getting a pc soon, so why buy all the ops on console if im just going to switch anyway
---
Haha no sorry
---
Hello keemstaraids, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b7fls4/_/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Suggest you actually try using wired internet if you planing to play any online game.
---
Wifi is a shitshow for any given game multiplayer.
---
I’ll remember that if I ever get siege on PC.
---
It is in game since Grim Sky
---
Ex diamond and plat 2 rn, can confirm elites are common
---
The devs said they don't want it out of the game and that it's a part of it I think
---
But it's even more humilating for the enemy to get killed by doc BECAUSE OF THAT... So yeah
---
In far cry new dawn you find the plane from splinter cell and a note that mentions the division as well. Seems like all ubisoft games are linked.
---
Really? I find Maverick's M4 pretty hard to control.
---
No it exploded but he took zero damage 
---
A key characteristic of roamer is his/her ability to rotate quick. Doc or Rook only go deep out on a section of map and do not roam. Jager does his job of planting the ADS and then he is off for roaming. Well if you find a jager in site then that guy basically is new to the game. Jager has a Loadout good enough to contest most of the attackers which makes him a great roamer. Ela can lay down mines at entry points into the building , can flank people easily, and rotate quick to escape from attackers attempting to refrag.
---
No, it's my welcome &gt;:(
---
For future reference, it's "you're welcome" and not "your welcome" :)
---
I imagine the downed person method is a little harder now (unless they help you out) since breach charges do less damage and have a smaller blast radius towards the planter than before. But it is quicker to plant so less time for the person to squirm away.
---
Sadly, this is casual in a nutshell
---
He was upset about that when maestro was first released, and I didn't understand why. I was pretty happy we actually had a viable "tachanka" option, and still have tachanka for the memes. 
---
Sounds like you get spawnpeeked a lot 
---
Don’t join the games pls ur weird
---
Shotgun for soft breach
---
I understand being annoyed by them smack talking the other team, but at some point you have to realize jumping in and adding to it ALWAYS makes it worse. To the other players you were just as bad as them, if not worse. You not only sent more messages, but provoked them to go a step further. I am not excusing their behavior, but you have to be able to see that your response doesn't help anyone.  
---
Aaah dang it. No issues. Carry on.
---
Killcams are broken
---
Most people on PC actually play at a lower sens on PC, we just move more than our thumbs. Console also looks slow because most people on PC play at high FOV, we also tend to play more aggressively and hit more shots
---
Spray and pray works for me sometimes. I don't know of a setting to help fix that issue.
---
Sorry😅
---
Use Muzzle Break or Flash Hider
---
Sledge is a good op and is l85 has almost no recoil at all. Thermites is pretty good too
---
you can use a flash hider, pretty much the only option
---
Good stream man!
---
I'm sorry, it's a bit complicated for a beginners guide, but you can do the "impact trick" in some walls and hatches. Basically some reinforces have still soft wall above them so you break that and throw the impact on the ceiling, it destroys thermite charges and hibana pallets (except the bottom ones). Similar with hatches on soft ceilings, if there's an object near the hatch you can throw it and destroy thermite charges and hibana pallets 
---
I won a match because I panic sprayed an LMG 
---
Oh that makes sense
---
So which games are in each universe? Rabids can go anywhere, Watch_Dogs is with Assassins creed. Then R6S, Division, Splinter cell, and Wildlands are the same universe. Maybe they're all in 1?
---
Do you not see that connection icon? 
---
anything is possible :), EXCEPT REMOVING THE ONE HEADSHOT MECHANIC &gt;:(
---
He's a 3 armor with no acog. So basically the worst 3 armor. Add on the fact that there's at least 5 ops that have a better gun and are probably faster, and bring a real gadget to the match. It's not about people not using him the right way, it's that every other op is better than him in 99.9% of the time. Also spawnpeeking with him isn't good because most places you can destroy the shield without exposing yourself and then you're just a stationary target with no acog or even any sight.
---
I would put Montagne under planters aswell. Thr guy's got smoke and can cover spray fire with his shield, also can stand on corner bombs for a funny denial
---
try overwatch 
---
I'm not saying actually change it - I'd just like to try it out sometime
---
That Barricade cosplay is Awesome!
---
I dont know if I agree with the 3 speed slide because that is just implementing dripshotting again but also make it to where he moves while doing it
---
Why the hell does this matter in the slightest 
---
Please delete this, before more people see it and start abusing this mechanic
---
Lesion is also an intel gathering op.
---
Alright, and what about after that 15 seconds... Nothing stops no one from tk'ing (same goes for the defending side but after the end of the prep phase)
---
Lol my favorite YouTube made 
---
Me do it . Look like he had fun so I’m gonna do it to lol
---
Lol I know I should have. Sorry for the disrespect Montagne Main 
---
I legit got only commons since the start of the season
---
I Xbox I have only ever been team killed by some friends I had since we were getting bored of just playing and decided to mess around. I think that may be because I am on Xbox, I don't do things to get people to target me, and I only play the base operators.
---
Every trap operator, and every sound is
---
Upvote 
---
There is a theory that all ubisoft's games are in the same universe, so that's probably true
---
At least you tried man
---
Uncommons? You lucky all I've been getting are commons 
---
Who’s arguing for this???
---
I am pretty sure all the Tom Clancy games are in the same universe
---
All good ;)
---
Shout out to LevelCap in 2015 who said the 1 shot headshot mechanic is not skillful and should be removed otherwise the P90 would be over powered x) 
---
I feel it’s too much like leison for this to be a good op idea
---
Oh look, they must be someone who sees the barricades as brown.  
---
I see them as green, personally, as do many others.  
---
They really did nail the shade to make this split so divisive.
---
But what if someone gets lag kicked and can't rejoin?
---
Thought of that but I thought it might be confusing since gadgets are considered smokes, flashes ect and I listed the roles of operators + some gadgets. 
---
Lesion more so because his gu's are more difficult to spot and he can see where they detonated.
---
 Last time it wasn't available it all
---
You need to go outside once and awhile 
---
I actually thought it was coming out pretty good:(
---
I'll critique it for you instead of him. This op is just glorified lesion. I mean the blood trail is neat but 5 damage is too much. Sliding is also too much. Maybe a different kind of gadget would make him a better night stalker. Maybe like jackal with the footprints but he can't track them only follow.
---
They don't block you, can be destroyed easily enough, and don't even face the windows, not much to abuse here other than for a few WTF's in chat 
---
Except unlike lesion you don't have to rip it out or anything and it doesn't slow you down
---
Upvoted for the barricade and Thiccbeard.
---
Yeah, it was 
---

Evan braddock wants to know your location
---
Not really 90% of players on severs are level 140 with 1k+ hours, always 3-5 people camping attack jets/attack heli.
---
Also most servers are either running siege of shanghai/metro/lockers. 
---
And the only game mode being played is conquest you’re lucky if you find rush.
---
Welcome to Shit-6
---
More like the castle barrier just wasnt there for frost. There wouldnt have been a hole in the castle barricade when the cluster charge was shot bc it hadnt been activated yet
---
But did you have black ice? No? See you in the next round friendo
---
For honor is post-apocalypse btw
---
Flash hider dumbass
---
Yeah...., well effort
---
His point still applies heavily to any competive shooter currently on the market, and most likely every competive shooter to be released for at least the next decade. no comp shooter has ever gotten a ranked mode that can properly stop players from smurfing. aside from China because they use real world identification. 
---
it's just not possible
---
I got teamkilled once because I told someone the wrong answer to "what's you favourite anime?"
---
Ela doesn't really have a set role, her Grzmots are fairly useful at doing a lot of things, you can just leave them at doors and windows to the site to aid your team, or they can make useful tools in active combat.
---
Please just link, I don't want Reddit to shift into a Facebook meme sharing dump.
---
Ok, your defo missing Fuze in the hostage killer category  
---
Are you 5 dude? This stinks bad dude. 
---
While that sounds amazing and the meme potential would be insane. But it doesn’t sound like it would work 
---
Wait, why is Maverick always a hard breacher? Isn't he the one with the torch? That would seem like a soft breaching thing. Especially since it is near perfectly quite and often isn't noticed immediately. Can someone please explain to me the difference between a hard breacher and a soft breacher?
---
I think it should be like a bandit charge as in you equip something to a wall. But it should only counter maverick since there’s none for him, and thermite and hibana already have multiple
---
What is this
---
Self promoting also works
---
Protocol 3 -Protect the p̶i̶l̶o̶t̶  blitz
---
Just a cashgrab ac-themed event instead of winter one, nothing really interesting
---
She doesn’t even have to be a roamer. She can be just as effective with some well placed prismas and just anchoring. I guess most people don’t play her like that but she’s definitely not a required roamer. 
---
They should restart their game to reconnect
---
Was kinda thinking that barricade guy should have been Alibi prisma behind that, but still a brilliant and unique cosplay! You can color me impressed!
---
Bro do you play in your closet
---
literally whatever you want. it's preference.
---
? 
---
If you get shot in the head irl, you’re most likely gonna die. Why would someone think it’s a good idea to remove that, especially since most shooters follow the same formula of dying in one shot to a headshot.
---
Well I mean recruit is the best op in the game 
---
oopsie
---
Yeah, I have some good friends that I usually play with when they're online, and my experience is usually fine. And I'm like the most inconsistent player ever, I'll drop 8 kills one game, then go 0-5 next game. 
---
Ash is a fragger. Fuze is almost useless, very situational
---
Your right
---
I can take a negative comment you comment is just pointless and takes away from the discussion.
---
The scorpion sounds and shoots like an a-10 warthog (look it up it sorta does)
---
If he had a Jager/Doc helmet the cosplay would be 110% the most accurate cosplay made.
---
It has become clear to me that you have absolutely no understanding of how this game is supposed to be played, and minimal understanding of the purpose of different operators 
---
?
---
If you spawnpeek too much ubisoft calls you home 
---
what that danish leek say?
---
A gun with bleed and blood trails would be incredibly overpowered
---
That's what I typically do but I never load into a game 
---
Zofia for pure utility, maverick for being a sneaky asshole, vigil for guns and clutch. Depending on which playstyle you use I’d go for
---
zofia for run and gun
---
Vigil for roaming and/or anchor with good guns
---
Maverick for slowly getting near objective and picking off kills
---
I heard the fo 12 is really good though
---
Same here, when I die, especially because of my trash aim, it tilts me really badly. Just laugh it off sometimes, it helps.
---
Dmrs will never be on defense because you have people come to you, exact reason why acog was removed. Smg doesn’t belong on attack because it’s long range pick offs with ars. Yeah yeah jackal has an smg but no one uses it realistically. Anything else you want me to point out that isn’t viable?
---
Well it's more of a suggestion just to kinda give and idea that the gun would be special rather then what it would actually do I'd love to hear if you got any possible idea for something it can do.
---
take a deep look at screenshot 
---
Does it have to do with the fps?
---
Oh lol nvm I figured it out 😂
---
lol "strat"
---
Where is Jäger? And i love how Capatioa is the only planter nice
---
It is I'm just saying the scorpion does act like a-10 otherwise the fo 12 is good tho
---
damn. sorry man
---
From experience, there isn't. Though, I bought the game on PC when they made it so you had all base operators available for you from the start, so when I recently was able to play it I wouldn't need to grind as much.
---
Yea ik that's what it's supposed to be
---
Just practice, plus there is a lot more to it then just kills. If you go 0-5 but you were drowning everyone out then you are definitely the best player on your team. I know this may get downvoted a lot, but if you really need to play an operator like Blackbeard until you are super consistent. That way you always have an advantage and eventually you won’t need it anymore.
---
You on xbox?
---
No I'm on pc rip
---
Damn, I'm silver 2 rn but I'm pretty good I would've helped
---
Who your mains?
---
Yeah that’s not a bad idea. To be honest I’m only gonna be buying a couple operators cause after 900 hours on PS4, there’s some I just never use. Thanks for the idea though 
---
Cool guess I should try throwing an impact at Maverick's blowtorch!
---
I said dbz :(
---
Wow.
---
Usually Hibana and Bandit but in ranked I go support.
---
i've had something similar happen to me. i saw a black-mirrior and a mira peaking through a hole next to it so i shot her. in the head
---
first shot: misses 
---
second shot: misses 
---
 i start spraying an every shot goes through the head. she then 1tapped me(i was pretty mad.)
---
“DOOR SECURED”
---
Just started!? This looks like you're very experienced

Console has a lot of people who use mouse and keyboard who obviously dominate the majority of players who use controller. It’s not necessarily harder than pc, but at least pc is an equal playing field. 
---
Well what’s the error code?
