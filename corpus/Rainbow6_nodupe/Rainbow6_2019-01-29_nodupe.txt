The packs that they only have 3 times a year? Meanwhile the other 95% of the time all items can be earned or bought with ingame money or directly with real money

I think it depends if it uses any kind of remote detonator or if it just has a timer before being let off than mute jammer shouldn't be a problem.

its shotgun, which pallets hit the head so it counts it as headshot, but as we all know, shotguns don;t have the one-headshot capability

Too real

Very nsfw glad its tagged....

It worked on my laptop thankyou

And slows them down so they have more time to react and see it. Can still work in the dark, but there are very few places where it's dark enough to do that. Only one like Theme Park and Tower really.

Aye, and to be honest I used to play as Echo in either Secure Area or Hostage only (didn't play Bomb that time), so his effectiveness was a little okay. Then S.I. showed me how scary good he can be, especially with his two drones.
---
Sure, Maestro can zap the defusing enemy, but he has to be quick to down him/her before it's finally planted, but Echo can fully deny it in an instant.
---
post it to r/mildlyinfuriating, lul
---
Yep 
---
Love it. Expecially for a first cosplay. That's pretty good. Now you gotta find the hardest operator and make a cosplay. Keep me in the loop 😉

Yes, everybody can physically buy and plug in a mouse and a keyboard, but not everyone can use them. If you buy a console, you're getting a more arcadey, casual and couch style platform. If you use M&amp;K on console you may as well get a PC. Most console users, like me, bought a console to play on their TV from their couch or bed, giving the users who can use a M&amp;K because they use their console on their desk where they also have a PC an unfair advantage.

That happened to me today and i died coz it 
---
Just keep grinding. Make sure you drone rooms you’re moving into, to stop any embarrassing deaths. Also, increasing your map knowledge is pretty important; breaking floors above choke points can get easy kills. Also also, think about increasing your sensitivity. I’m on PS4 too and I increased mine almost immediately, and once your used to it being able to get the turn on opponents can be valuable. 
---
Finally, don’t worry about your rank. I’ve been playing since Y1S2 on and off, level 140 and I’m sat in silver II right now. However, just play for fun and don’t get tilted cause that can easily cause you to lose games. Chill out and have fun
---
And if they don't admit it? And who's to say it's the fifth? It could be anyone on the squad. Ultimately allowing people to play with m+KB and actively adding a handicap would be exponentially better. 
---
You want to play with m+KB? No headshots. Then it gives a pro and a con to using it.
---
Pros: Your aim is generally better and your movement is more natural
---
Cons: You are unable to headshot, you have a cooldown on leans and crouches.
---
Ultimately this would probably make it feel like there's an actual downside to using it, but also a reason to use it.
---
The problem with welcome mats is the fact that you can shot them while ur vaulting, it’s stupid as shit.
---
My friend is a diehard Echo main. Any game mode. Definitely a viable operators. Just bonus uses on bomb worthy of a ban.
---
Just like the original
---
What I mean is the lower ranks meta is wrong
---
If your teammates lie or don’t tell you, it’s time to find different teammates.
---
that looks really good {-}7
---
My appetite was insatiable 
---
Feel free to react to the rest
---
delete your post nibba 
---
Not on ps4 so my 2 cents would be, Drone effectively and efficiently. In casual you have a lot more time to waste checking every corner, but in ranked you gotta balance between droning a lot and actually pushing up to the objective. So what I usually do is drone areas where you get wider views more and LISTEN to stuff around it, saves a lot of time if you hear somebody in a part of the map you know. So point 2, just know every map, watch how you die memorize common areas where they come from, and keep it in mind as you drone and push. 
---
.....dude that's not why she's even picked. I have 1500 hours in this game and I'm telling you for sure that's not why lol. It's great gun, three speed, tiny head. They take her r6 and leave the g36 she woul still be a heavily used op and much more balanced. That being said i couldn't care less. She's not that OP. My point was your "adding recoil won't change anything" argument is just insane
---
Changing how the game works would be as hard or harder than implementing some form of cross play 
---
Just ignore the noise.. I recently rotated my main ops to castle and blitz and almost every game somebody mirrors my picks after a round or two.
---
incoming wave of lord tachanka meme comments
---
Execute repost 66
---
Yes
---
They do it 3 times a year while the other 99% of the time all cosmetics can be bought with renown or directly with in game money
---
Ah, I see. Thanks for explaining!
---
I would like to see the stats to back that argument up. Everyone I know that has a PS4 plays at a desk with a monitor. If you want a causal game lifestyle go play Spider-Man. You can’t play a competitive game and then complain about it being competitive. And you’re argument about MnK, could be said about controllers. Some people can’t use controllers so should they not be allowed to? 
---
Blitz used to be more OP but he was nerfed. Players are still good with him tho and has left many traumatized myself included. As far as the rest tho like lion, i dont consider op or toxic.
---
Aye, same here! If I came back to Siege feeling rusty, I'd go as Echo, since I can watch key areas with them. The thing is back then I feel exposed if I don't play as him.
---
But S. I. has showed me to be good with the other ops, so that's good by me! 
---
Is it just me or does all the charms seem very deep and meaningful?
---
i never really likes using iron sights, but i gotta agree wit what u/Mr_hushbrown said about it being personal preference
---
It's because they're considered annoying
---
Because those ops are either OP or just not fun to play against. So some people have made an unwritten to not play these ops for a more fair and fun match. When someone picks these ops it becomes not enjoyable to play, hence being tk’d or people leave. You’re more than welcome to play whatever op you want, but it may come with toxicity towards you. 
---
Confirmed? 
---
1: nothing here 
---
2: okay, imagine these few situations. Doc, rook, ela, valkyrie/kaid, jager, and lesion are all given this attachment. Doc and rook are the best player helpers on defense and have high win deltas which would boost both that and pick delta, ela is already on thin ice and would break with something like this, valkyrie/kaid have love fire rate and damage because of they're extremely useful gadgets, we all know why jager is a bad idea, lesion is one of if not the most versatile operator on defence and has got his smg nerfed as a result. Giving these operators and attachment that changes the game extremely is bad. Stuff like comp, and vertical grip doesn't change much but make a gun easier to control but it's Suttle. Adding damage reduces the shots required to kill and since it's not a barrel means you can have both more damage and easier control.
---
3: I know your not just talking about windows. But your only adding that, with the rest of his placements which only is viable for spawn peeks.
---
4: nothing here
---
Could make a good ctu for recruits
---
big fucking hole in the heart
---
I shot someone in the head with a shotgun and it said injure so i think it might just be the range and if you might have shot at a distance through something 
---
Rule 9
---
Wow wtf I had no clue but that makes sense
---
Low, not love. Fucking auto correct 
---
Yeah I see your points.  Without mute then
---
Not a streamer by any means but I personally prefer it over optics. They don't add any zoom so all depends on what you wanna shoot with I guess
---
Habana 
---
Hey, thanks for taking your time to help me improve, really means a lot dude!
---
No worries my man. Good luck 
---
Honestly, I feel the exact opposite
---
It's not a meme 
---
Lion and blitz are looked down upon because they both can be really strong in the right hands/ scenario.   
---
Jackal isn’t considered toxic, but in coop with lion he can be a toxic combo sometimes.   
---
Blackbeard is considered fundamentally broken by a ton of people.
---
Same with you, thanks for the tips, hopefully, ill improve!
---
Yes officer, this post right here. 
---
There are already settings that would prevent damage
---
ok, fair points tbf, but ubisoft obviously know a lot more about this stuff than anyone here really, so its up to them whether or not these changes actually get implemented really
---
Or folks playing just the defense part and then quitting and looking for a new lobby where they can play defense. Won dozens of games because the other team quitted after swapping sides
---
And all that renown you grinded is valuable for 99% of cosmetics, they do paid only packs 3 times a year you make it sound like its the only way to get cosmetics ever
---
Lmao 😂 
---
I had already known about this, didn't post cause I thought it was game breaking 
---
Many foundations for fixing the game were put into place and the overall health of the game increased?
---
Yeah who would want that.
---
Alright, my bad, but I think they're just seeing how the community reacts and I do agree it should be added permanently. 
---
April 9th is a Tuesday after all. My birthday is the 12th so I might be going for a shitload of R6 credits if it's an event
---
hey man, rook is the best roamer. I've gotten aces roaming with him, his shotgun is a monster.
---
P.s this happened in R.S.S
---
Yea tbh
---
Lmao but seriously every time I see another frost it’s in front of the doorway 
---
We don't know that though.  What if Pulse is just a nice guy obsessing over a girl who doesn't see the same in him.
---
He even has the Travis Bickle costume.
---
My friend is and I have proof... [The worst siege player ever.](https://youtu.be/-ZsfKkdIqZ4)

Like such a waste smh, now i get why doc players keep their stims
---
Ok so this is the 4th re post ive seen about this.
---
ASH ISN'T THICC. SHE IS NOT BAE. 
---
SHE IS ONE OF THE FLATEST OPS IN THE GAME.
---
And to conclude Twitch is bae

I’d forgive it if you were actually trying to learn something about what you’re preaching but you just want to play the pity and ignorance card so go ahead
---
Ikr I wish I was around while glacier was available 
---
I haven't played for a while, did they change Echo or something? I never saw him in games, maybe 1/20, is he worth a ban over a stronger / more popular operator?
---
Well then
---
Siege does use a player to player ranking system
---
Update still taking forever been since the 17th and nothing has been done been with multiple agents that can't help all I want to do is play the game again.
---
Console community is so toxic it makes me want to uninstall but then i run in to the few people who are actually cool 
---
Year 5 season 3 it will return after they patch the latest feature, invisible clash
---
Could be worse, I have it for the AR and the spetnaz grach lmao 
---
Mad lad Vlad
---
Was it the rook plate that saved him/her or do headshots negate the plate altogether?
---
Lol they weren't being a cunt, sit down and shut up; cunt
---
nah man, your clearly smarter and more skilled with your ability to lean spam and glitch to time and space that no known special forces on this planet can do. you are clearly above my league.
---
Alright, December then. 70k from 57k in November. Probably just a bunch of returning players... 
---
Lmao
---
I always vote to ban Ash because there’s an 80% chance I just target-banned someone on the other team...
---
I did this one time 1v5 on the same map, except coming up the stairs facing the wall no idea if there were an enemy behind it, other than there being a barricade next to it and single tapped to the tune of a song and on the final 'note' i.e. bullet, it ended up hitting the enemy and headshotting them lmao.
---
Did the same tune later in the same round to bait an enemy into peeking a corner and right as I was about to end the tune (again) so the guys head pop out and went auto mode killing him xd
---
How does one expect to kill God, Lord and Saviour? 
---
headshots negate rook armor and the other team was on offense
---
I get a payday 2 vibe from this idk why
---
What if you shoot the mat itself?
---
You sound fun
---
I been using this method for awhile now. Litteraly its so fun
---
Hopefully one day... 
---
Hahaha this is awesome 
---
I was playing with a friend on Thunt this weekend 
---
He was afk for second, so I went to grab the bomber and ran it back to him, all you could hear in the mic.. 
---
"Hey, no no no hey I'm coming back don't let..." 
---
He killed us both 
---
That’s so dirty
---
Lmao this is the same guy who tried to say that withstand should be default for all ops because he wants a chance to rectify his mistakes. Glad to see you haven't changed OP!
---
&gt; one more comment will result in a block
---
lmao watch out guys!
---
He now has two drones. And he is able to stop a plant with his drones
---
U know im right
---
Did you have to cover them with a coating so it would not hurt the fish?
---
Yep. Always a good one lol. Fun to watch them squirm
---
What scenarios are there (except cav)
---
Yeah I mean I didn't say you weren't right
---
If you're planning on playing the game a lot just go for standard, the grind isn't all that bad. If not, get gold or whatever it is now.
---
I did not see your comment and said the same exact thing.
---
Expect April May June July and October averaged 60 to 65 k November with 57 and December averaged just over 70K. 
---
Is there a standard operators version of this? If so can someone link me it
---
I'm assuming the abbreviation you're unsure about is ootl, if so, it's for "Out Of The Loop".
---
I will say; I honestly don't feel like Clash should get any buffs that make her more common until she either gets reworked or adjusted so that the Attackers have more hard counters for her, especially in 1v1 situations.
---
Even as bad as she is now she is *incredibly* frustrating for the Attackers to deal with, with no fun or interesting interactions and only one actual counter (Nomad) as the Clash would have to be pretty dumb to die to her other "counters" or be alone and/or outnumbered. 
---
Tbh I say give more of an incentive to not leaving a match, so we'd have less join in progress games overall. Or punish people more for leaving.
---
when ur running windows 7
---
same thing just happened to me... four months later... and a buddy of mine  a few days ago...
---
Repost
---
It just be like that...
---
it was supposed to be a humorous comment, but clearly was taken the wrong way. i apologize for being a cunt, *this deserves to be in a museum*
---
Maestro would literally break clashes arm
---
Blitz and Lion just shouldn't exist in their current state, anyways.
---
They're completely counteractive to how Ubi designed the game.
---
i agree, i would say maybe another meter where you need completed matches to fill and maybe you can get some more renown. but thank you!:)
---
This is the game that we play...
---
Right, keyword returning players. You act like there are a bunch of new players which there aren’t which is my first statement.  Ubisoft shouldn’t carter to the 5% of new players at the expense of the loyal players who have been supporting the game for 3 plus years 
---
Oh my bad, nvm then have a good day
---
Are you kidding? Monty is such cancer, at least in ranked. He just sits there with his shield extended and in the split second you look away from him at the ash running at you, he unextends and shoots you immediately. 
---
I think I have read those 4 words on a porn title
---
I wonder who got spawnpeeked...
---
I’ll post one right now
---
Spawn peeking is high risk, high reward. I can see you maybe saying buff a map to make it that you automatically do it but this isn’t a exploit, it’s literally just catching the enemy off guard 
---
that's kinda  BS, though maybe I'm opinionated because I also got banned for 'boosting' like FFS. I can't help not knowing  if someone is cheating, not everyone is a blatant hackers
---
This looks old. Source??
---
Fuse elite bois! 
---
THE GREATER GOOD
---
none.  ubi will just repeat the same 'well the system said' line over and over
---
It most definitely is one of the best defender weapons 
---
I like the idea the only problem is that you cant predict when you will join a match in progress and an alpha pack is a pretty strong reward. I fear that people would be mad over the fact that they cant specifically look for matches in progress in order to get their alpha pack. 
---
Maybe, just maybe, they were a bunch of friends trying to have fun in a video game?
---
Compensator and stay at medium range
---
Her gun is pretty much pre nerf smg11
---

Fuck bug fixes ubi get on this now!
---
Nah, it's part of the game
---
Stop. It’s easy to go on google image and just paste the logo on a black ice wallpaper. Nothing creative here. 
---
Thats not normal try uninstall reinstalling
---
I shoot cluster charges before they go off more than I’d like to admit. 
---
It’s unfair!
---

---
Feels bad man
---
Lol first thing i thought too
---
Can we get an F in the chat for the Mira/Echo mains
---
Not new but good trick anyway
---
Have you ever been impact grenade spawn peekd
---
I hope the mods hightlight this schedule at the front page of this reddit so that no one ask when is the Y4 roadmap reveal again.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Seriously, everyone have been asking for this like hundred times alr.
---
...yes dumbass the point is to make it harder to shoot not make it invincible
---
Uhh ok lol 
---
Will thatcher's EMP disable bomber?
---
On the one hand, they gotta fix that, but on the other hand, you deserve it for using Blitz.
---
That's a nice charm ;-;
---
Thanks. This should be interesting

---
It really be like that sometimes

---
Whats ADS? And I appreciate it
---
It really do
---
dont get me started. head shot doc. kill cam shows dock lose blood from head. not even an injure
---
That was an awesome ace, tho that Monty was a douchebag
---
Yeah, this happens a lot. Would definitely recommend getting some friends to play with, it drastically decreases the chances of this happening and makes the game a lot more fun to play 
---
If your ps4 is activated as your primary ps4 then your digital copy can be played on any other account on the ps4 so just make a smurf but for a disk it’s pretty obvious
---
I love how frost and caps are basically right and blackbeards should be something an op can do. Works like a regular shield in most ways though. Your head is exposed when you ads you cant use you actual primary and you are beyond slow when moving. You also drop the body/person when you go to reload. Also living ops you do this on can escape from you by doing 3 timed button prompts in a row. If you manage to get a living op (extremely rare) they get longer promps but if you get a downed op they have to be quick because each is only a half a second long but it revives them and gives them the chance to shoot you
---
I’d report that to Xbox, a suspension will stop him from doing it again
---
So so many people have the gold Chanka chibi? Idk if it’s rare enough for me to rock over my Trex charm or not
---
He’S oN aLpHa. I wouldve muted right then
---
Idk but your definitely allowed to
---
Maybe you flaired it wrong
---
Castle beehive strat but there's already a Raid trap at the mouth of the hive
---
the synced up death and animation. niccee
---
I lowkey never liked black ice that much. Personally, I think the Spartan one looks much better
---
These jokes still aren't funny
---
I'd say a lot of these ops would be better than the originals
---
AAA game right? i deal with this daily. 20 ping while also being told there is connection issue in the corner as i get shot from around corners by guns with no body.
---
Keep your verticle lower than your horizontal and use the ADS setting to your advantage, here are my settings when I played console, h50 v20 ads25
---
damn thats unusual lmao 
---
I've honestly never seen something like that. Like sure maybe get tk'd for one game or 2 during a session but it's kinda crazy this time
---
And on this day the lord saideth "You shall now feel the rather of just .0003% of my power"
---
Hahaha
---
Agreed 
---
Pretty sure they already dropped the fix on PC TTS notes like a week ago...
---
Kinda old actually ive been using it for a while 
---
I mean, it’s not that it looks bad, I like it, but it’s overrated (IMO). For example, I have a couple black ices, but I like the new invitational skin more, so I don’t really use black ice.
---
Why u playing on a Mac tho
---
I often run into people that use every buff for themselves. Even in 2vs3/4 situations it’s annoying as hell
---
Thanks I’ll know for next time now 👌
---
Clearly he just had a better gaming chair
---
Why do people show mouse? It’s literally the most boring thing to look at.
---
more than welcome, as for the terrible summary take it up with ubi kk good 
---
"Seemed like a good idea at the time"
---
Thank you 🙏
---
What’s our Vector, Victor?
---
Haha nah it’s an Asus. I’m away from home rn but I thought it’d be nice to try ranked again
---
blyat 
---
Yeah black ice is meh, I like the plain colors and  gridlock with my operation outbreak charm 
---
Fake 
---
Where can I find it?
---
they're keeping u alive longer 
---
I’m dadhatz from the video. This is me and my buddies just Memeing in the SI playlist. We did this every defense. 
---
ADS? I never said ADS. Also, like the other guy said, always keep your vertical lower than your horizontal, I once tried to switch it up, it’s weird as shit.
---
yeah i guess ur kinda right about the skin being overated but in my opinion the invitational skin looks a bit plane this year. Just my opinion
---
Agreed thanks for the help
---
Dang bruh I forgot 
---
Probably just for promo reasons.
---
That clickbait is gold
---
Hello R1vaLry_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/akwh9v/border_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yes, the graph shows that **AFTER 8.3 METERS,** the luison now does more damage then before. It's just that with the luison, you almost exclusively shoot within those first 8 meters. That's just the way caveira plays for almost everyone. You trick with caveira, or hold a position. You have incredible speed, but very little armor. You try and sneek up on people, with your ability, and then silently take them out. If they are alone, then interrogate them. So, because that is how caveira plays, you are almost always going to use the Luison within those first 8 meters from the target.
---
With the old caveira (the way she is now), you aren't helpless at all in the 8-20 meter range. Caveira is not for spawn peeking at all, but if you do get into a medium range fight, you could always use your M12 for that. I always found it pretty easy to make a quick headshot with the M12. You should use the M12 together with the Flash Hider, which greatly reduces short burst horizontal recoil, and only slightly reduces vertical recoil. It also hides the muzzle flash. Start shooting (very) slightly below the head, and do a short burst. It's almost a guaranteed headshot. The recoil goes in the upwards direction, there's not much recoil in the horizontal direction. The M12 always felt really solid to me when used this way.
---
Now, the caveira nerf is very clearly a nerf. I think everyone here should understand that. There's no doubt at all whether this is a nerf, and it's very obviously a quite strong nerf. Max damage is reduced from 99 to 65. I don't have to explain to the people here that the game is based on hitpoints... If you approach a group of three enemies, silently, then very quickly get one shot at each enemy, all three enemies are going to be very low on hitpoints. Let's say one enemy kills you after you get your three shots out. Your team is down one player, but the enemy team has lost almost a full 300 hitpoints. They have all players alive, but this is a really bad situation for them. There's bullet penetration in this game, and caveira communicates that three players are low. In a good team, those three players who are low, will be dead in about 3 to 10 seconds time, depending on the distance the defenders have to cover and their speed rating.
---
Sure, you did not down any of the three enemies. But that's not as strong a strategy. Let's say you could down one or two enemies, and the third kills you. Depending on how close the other defenders are, it could be quite easy to revive one of them. Then you have him at 50 HP, and the other one can be revived too. Two are at 50 HP, one at full HP. That's three enemies, at a combined HP of (100+50+50)=200. In the other example I gave above, the combined hitpoints of all three are below 10. So, downing an enemy is not really the strongest strategy for approaching a group of enemies. It is a very solid strategy for approaching a loner, but I don't see how that becomes harder after the nerf, which some claim is a "buff". You almost always approach within 8 meters anyways.
---
Furthermore, the magazine size of the Luison is reduced from 15 to 12. There is increased recoil for the Luison. And the hipfire spread is increased. Lowering the magazine size makes Caveira far less useful against groups of enemies. Where she can really BITE by tremendously lowering their hitpoints. The increased hipfire spread also nerfs her ability to be extremely useful against groups of enemies. And the increased recoil for the Luison is just another nerf, and that nerf was made so you would keep switching to the M12 for distant engagements. As I explained above, use the M12 with the Flash Hider, and you can easily get quick headshots.
---
So, concludingly, this is very obviously a nerf for caveira. And a pretty big nerf... That should be very easy to understand for everyone who has put some hours into the game.
---
Just keep joking around everywhere that this pretty big nerf is a "buff", something which no serious person could take seriously. This pretty big nerf should bring Caveira's win delta down a bit.

VECTOR MOVING WIN MAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION. OHH YEA

I had a thermite try and hot breach with his charge and I just shot him through the wall
---
One of the few times I appreciate the Reddit trend of finishing each others' sentences. 
---
about the 40th time this has been reposted on the subreddit
---
I'm surprised they didn't nerf Ela secretly behind everyone's backs. Because that's all she seems to get is a nice nerf when she doesn't need one. At least she was spared this patch.
---
That's all well and good until you start enforcing your brand of fun onto everyone else. 
---
"Everybody go recruit!"
---
But I didn't hop into casual to play recruit.
---
And the first time I've ever seen it, thanks OP!
---
What time of defender are you?
---
Sad react
---
I don't like it.
---
Lol it’s ok I’m a pc player so I can say it
---
Nope. We choose a room that had no hatches and we made sure of that.
---
We ended up losing 2-4 :&lt;
---
Last week I nudged my ethernet cable with my foot between rounds. I'd selected my operator already. Disconnected, managed to reconnect during the round loading in, so actually didn't miss any playtime at all. The only noticeable effect was my Echo having standard setup (shotgun) instead of my usual equipped stuff, and a very long loading screen.
---
Finished the game. Got hit with a 15 minute ban. For missing less than a minute of the game and not even missing a round
---
Mira

You know you can call out operator names right now?

Thanks guys ! I chose a few people already ! I might do more codes in the near future ! Please comment here if you redeemed your item.
---
By the nine
---
as a ranked only player, even though I usually play a 5 stack, there are games we go in with 4 and have to deal with a random fifth, trust me all that matters is you try. I rarely get upset, because I know I fuck up all the time, it's only normal for people to do so. what absolutely grinds my gears is that fifth man that picks vigil with the bosg and anchors with caveira. so long as you're not throwing like that, I'm sure people won't get upset at all.
---
Omg that font, i cant ready anything in this picture
---
So that's why her win rate is so high
---
Wasn't that 12 rounds? As you both get a point if you tie?
---
Well, same thing happens for us when our internet is too bad
---
this is the most disgusting set of clips I've seen. 
---
(By 'clips' I mean the previous ones you've posted.)
---
I feel like they should make it 1 stim per person. It would make it so he has to be an actual medic and not just be a fragger. It also makes sense, since realistically the stim pistol would increase your adrenaline since it wouldn't actually heal bullet holes, and getting too many adrenaline shots would kill you. 
---
Yeah, but it’s a bunch of trolling team mates. The exact toxicity that ruins the game.
---
Yeah, did you see how well that went over when Fortnite tried that? Within ONE day the adapters put out a patch that fixed it completely and the adapters weren't detectable at all anymore. 
---
People keep bringing up this one very old tweet but it means nothing. 
---
Tom Brady would be a good Thatcher. 
---
Now I feel like an idiot for missing out on the Widlands/Future Soldier crossover event, cuz that is some lore I did not know before
---
Lmao you really took the time to comment something toxic for no reason? Lmao, people like you are fuckin sad 🤣
---

Great work!

So is cav really strong below plat 1 as people may not know how to deal with her? i.e. droning, grouping, shortest distance to obj.
---
Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler from WWF days. GOAT
---
This is... free KD!
---
imo, the ACOG should be part of the selling point for an op, not something that's on a lot of them.
---
IRS a drone what will bite your toes. Similar to a mobile frost trap. 
---
This dude asked Xbox of ps4
---
What a pleb
---
People chosen already !!!

I'll do the giveaway for you ;)
---
But honestly tho, when you saw the meme did it genuinely bring a smile to your face
---
It's not that I play bad. I play decent. I'm talking about round one, picking operators and I get vote kicked. I fuck up a lot, dont get me wrong. 
---
One of the worst feelings coming from a former console player. I transferred to PC because of it.
---
Can we get a finka main to confirm I assume you all are best friends with this bot. Wait what if Sam is the nano bots 🤔

*Queue Michael Scott "NO! GOD NO!"*
---
ok this is epic
---
As explained in the other comment, they castled themselves into the small room. So 5 people were literally standing on one hatch. The hatch got blown with a claymore right under it so they all died to one claymore. 
---
No problem.👍
---
Nerfing damage does nothing.
---
Nerfing recoil does.
---
But that's a terrorist kill not a pvp kill u fake
---
Haha Halloween face skin
---
What the hell is that castle buff. 
---
IMO that wouldn't bring much utility because if you just don't die then the operator is useless
---
Its because you weren’t using your OP GFuelfaming socks
---
Idk the internet holds many unspeakable horrors
---
18 maps runs up the space rather quickly. 
---
The game's really detailed and varied, many skins=many textures etc.
---
Details...
---
You can say that again. So many ppl TK at the start of rounds and do stupid shit. Makes me wonder sometimes. 
---
Nah mate. 
---
You fuckin muppet!!!
---
Huh, hadn't even noticed it's my cake day. Goodnight to you as well!
---
Shaggy's ability would be releasing his powers. The longer you kept the ability-button pressed, the more powerful the releasing of the powers would be.
---
This would be challenging to execute tho, as by pressing the button more than 0.00014 seconds he would release 0.00028% of his power. Due to the immeasurable amount of power he has, this would already result in everyone in the lobby having their PC:s enter a quantum realm which would teleport them into a timeless dimension-anomaly of pure power. 
---
its not even gaming one, i think its **Sony** **MDR**\-ZX310
---
A double bell
---
ADS speed would be a reasonable nerf. It's ADS speed is pretty fast for how powerful it is. I'd say add an extra 100ms to it to make it just faster than Jager's and slower than most assault rifles
---
Places tiny traps that slam shut on drones only.
---
I hope this won't be a repeat of Tom Clancy's EndWar. I don't want the Operators killing each other because their stupid governments demanded it. :(
---
its nat a headshot, he was like 5 hp
---
The more you can shoot thru the shield the better
---
yup , but there are two
---
How is that better, if that's better, then what's the point of the shield???
---
Altering her pistol doesn't change much, Ubi will never remove her wallhacks so she will always be rightfully hated. 
---
That was what me and my friends assumed because I’ve had this console since late 2015 (or early 2016, can’t remember lol). But it’s weird cause my loading is fine in any other multiplayer including other ubi games. 
---
It’s a real feels bad bruh.
---
That castle rework turns him into a god lol
---
Son this is aint fortnite and also freezing thing does not week them 
---
its better then all the other suggestions Ive seen on this sub
---
That's awfull, blitz's shield is already bugged and terrible
---
I know I’m just saying that bombs are objectives too 
---
I think you mean bomb vs secure?
---
Ah looked like a Mac under the lighting
---
So you're able to fire 3 direct shots which will hit the mat directly, and not the cameras, while vaulting over a window and hipfiring? 
---
I don't know if I'll get hate for that or no but I feel like I should share my opinion... 
---
While getting Blitz to 1 speed is good for other 1 speed ops, it would be ridiculous against 3 speed while they would just vanish the moment they saw you and you wouldn't be able to do anything about it  (imo Blitz is a bit of anti-roamer, idk really that's how I use him) 
---
That being said he and all the other shields could be nerfed to stop leaning. Makes sense and stops shields from crouch-lean spamming. 
---
One last thing (Here goes nothing...) 
---
Poorly coding the third person model is not balancing the operator (refering to that bs "bug" that all shields have) 
---
If you truly want to add a flaw to Blitz make a proper one that makes the Blitz feel it's his own fault for dying and not the game's 
---
P.S. I don't main Blitz, I play only casual so I play all operators and not just my mains (which are Sledge and Jackal if anyone asks). That being said know that I say all this out of pure logic and not cause I want my "main" to be OP.

Because it's blitz

All.

I think you should get one that sound most fun for you, for me it Valkyrie. You can check out jackal good gun and annoy gadget.

That’s a lot of damage.

M8 where u got dat from? Any sources?

Don’t remember asking

I better keep my mouth shut for a long time. Still, you can turn this into a griefing tool am I wrong?

If you aren't doing well just get Clash. She has thr lowest pick rate so none of your better teammates will be deprived.

There's this [handy timeline](https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostRecon/comments/a9nmye/story_what_is_canon/eckyncq/) I created by combining entries from multiple fan wikis. Unfortunately that timeline only contains major narrative events and not technological innovations in the game.
---
It's also a bit tricky to track them, since many *Ghost Recon* gadgets are game-specific and some never returned in subsequent games.
---
* **2007:** *Splinter Cell's* iconic trifocal goggles are introduced in *Chaos Theory*, possessing 3 vision modes of night-vision, infrared, and EMF. Gadgets similar to EMF vision will later appear in IQ's Spectre and *Future Soldier's* magnetic view.
---
* **2010:** Sonar vision is introduced in *Conviction*, used by Sam Fisher while on the run. Similar technologies will later be used by the Echelon class of *Ghost War* in 2019.
---
* **2013-2014:** CrossCom 2.0 is fielded by Ghost Recon during the Mexican Civil War and Rebellion. Other appearing technologies include the [Cypher](https://ghostrecon.fandom.com/wiki/UAV_Drone/Ghost_Recon:_Advanced_Warfighter), [M.U.L.E. UGV](https://ghostrecon.fandom.com/wiki/M.U.L.E.), [Crye Associates MR-C](https://ghostrecon.fandom.com/wiki/Modular_Rifle-Caseless), and XM8 assault rifle (appearing as the M8).
---
 - Despite use by Scott Mitchell, almost none of these technologies (except CrossCom) return in future games.
---
* **~2016-17:** First appearance of small-scale cloaking technology used on the Yokai drone and Lesion's Gu mines.
---
 - Portable EMP devices are in use by SAS operative Thatcher.
---
 - IQ's RED Mk III Spectre provides similar functionality to Third Echelon's EMF vision.
---
 - Twitch's RSD Model 1 is a custom designed drone using parts from [Skell Tech](https://skelltech.com/). Use the username `epichon` and password `15034` to access one of her order forms.
---
 - HB-5 Cardiac Sensor allows Pulse to detect heartbeats through multiple surfaces.
---
 - EE-One-D drone allows Lion to monitor movement.
---
 - ERC-7 intercepts video feeds and removes Vigil from its view.
---
 - Alibi's Prismas allow her to project a life-size image of herself to take in and mark incoming enemy fire.
---
* **2019:** Kozak field tests a prototype [Skell Tech](https://skelltech.com/) optical camouflage suit while posing as a Russian agent working with Unidad in Bolivia.
---
 - ***Fallen Ghosts:*** Covert Ops units fielded by *Los Extranjeros* mercenary unit field prototype optical camo suits paired with a silent and deadly crossbow. These units can only be marked in thermal vision.
---
 - ***Ghost War PvP mode:*** Sonar vision returns in use by the Echelon class. Magnetic sensor grenades are fielded by the Vanguard class.
---
* **2024:** Optical camouflage has been adopted by Ghost Recon. Magnetic sensor grenades and magnetic vision are first introduced in *Future Soldier*.
---
Shoot her or something! 
---
It's just a prediction. But as far as I know the Australian ops are almost confirmed. And as far as I can recall, back in the Beta - First season days they at some point said that they might add danish ops. - I have no source for this tho
---
Glaz and mute

Smoke

that would be awesome if you could !
---
Scooby Snack
---
NA West but good with anything NA. sorry forgot to include that 
---
...
---
that's what I'm saying. I don't even know how what OP did was more fun that actually playing the game, just go play vrchat if you wanna do this? it's worse when someone is like "pistol only/knife only/ recruit only" and tk you if you don't comply
---
His first hole is completely silent. You can only hear if he does more than 1 tap on the wall.
---
Time to conquer Danmark!! 
---
Griefing tool.. I don't know man. All I know is that it's a long ass grind.   
---
Me personally had everything on pc - sold the pc - and startet playing from scratch on ps4. I couldn't wait the grind, so I bought the advanced edition on sale. I would never recommend the starter edition to anyone, unless you like grinding. :) 
---
I think I know a thing or two about siege, considering in my past two years of playing the game considering I've amassed over 600 hours.
---
Some of this stuff I'll agree are issues, others I think are just you nitpicking, but I still dont agree that these issues need an entire dedicated season to fix, I believe ubisoft if they put in the effort can easily solve these issues while still putting out 4 maps and 8 operators a year.
---
Blitz and vigil or doc
---
The thing about mavericks torch is that sometimes you can hear that thing across two rooms, sometimes you sit in front of him but don't hear anything. Its just soooo inconsistent
---
 But somehow I manage 90% of the time not to be noticed in any way. Then its just a free round win if the defenders are in Packaging Room on Favela
---
Hey guys, my game keeps crashing upon starting up. I know im supposed to submit a ticket, and I did. But im temp banned for an hour so I thought I was post it here
---
No fuck right off mate
---
More than x25 at least 
---
&gt; I don't get the Mira ban either. Lobbies I get in almost never have people that ban her. I vote to ban Cav and Blitz every time.
---
And people can say the same about your Cav choice.
---
Rip in peace 
---
Iq with a shotgun lol
---
I really hope it's never brought back, would lose all it's value
---
No it isn't. That's a badly thought through part of the idea for the nerf which isn't going to be implemented.
---
as a shieldy boyo main #2, yes

Can confirm, I'd be salty as fuck

only able to down 2-5 attackers at once bc 1) moving silently and 2) broken pistol
---

---
As in, "I know you were in my Team when I played Rogue Spear, but you're the enemy now, so I have to fire a High Energy Laser and vaporize you in your command vehicle while I slaughter the rest of the guys you personally trained. Sorry."
---
For the mere fact that its not a tournment all the time. While i think maybe having the core baseline of the round timer, defuse and plant times for the bomb, etc my only two things are with Pick and Ban and the three rounds in a row before switch
---
The majority of Ranked players are if I remeber correct (and please correct me if wrong/outdated) laying in Mid to low Gold and Silver
---
Not all 35 million players want or care for PL and how they play. I think making a big change like pick and ban and the round switching could have the adverse effect of turning alot of people off ranked and possibly rainbow as a whole. I feel if you want to add more competitive aspects thats fine. But Matchmade Rainbow should be more relaxed than Tournament play. Even ranked while its absolutely more competitive with more on the line. Its still a videogame and the first rule is it needs to be fun before its "competitive" banning ops in my mind isnt the answer to these Ops arent fun to play against when played this way- well now youre denying people who like that op for other reasons from having the chance to show maybe they arent cancer etc, instead UBi should look at whose being banned here and put them at the front and center of rebalance. Ranked while competitive is still not tournament play, its matchmaking, its inherently more "casual" than tournaments are and thats ok it should be since its a Videogame. It needs to be inherently fun for anyone playing and pick and ban takes that away, as someone who loves playing fuze for attack and he gets banned cosntantly for some reason it just isnt as fun.
---
He’d get banned in the process, since he’d instantly kill all four of his teammates as well.
---
Because shields need nerfs, right. First fix them, then you can nerf them. 
---
Wait, why are we nerfing shields?
---
Well usually you peek quickly so that you can notice small details like that, and if you see a hole like that, you just shoot it. If I'm sticking my face into a hole and you shoot it, I'm dead. Otherwise yeah either don't go that way or die
---
Hello Ajmahlon1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/akyjgo/how_are_people_crashing_the_servers/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Easy answer, either which comes from Ubi themselves, or if they both do, which is more recent?
---
Or you can have a special animation of whatever shield OP taking the C4 out of the shield and throwing it away.
---
Well they both came from Ubi
---
And impact grenades to make them to hold the shield sideways like when they got melee.
---
I specifically said which to pick if both came from Ubi. 
---
Also when you shoot a jumping drone the landing sound plays little after it even tho the drone is dead. Often making me double check if theres a second drone
---
I love how useless mira is.
---
As useless as snail mail.
---
I’d like to know what happened after the pic was taken? 
---
Shaggy is gonna use power 0.4% and Ubisoft eont nerf him they won't even touch him
---
Fuckin level 120 and the only one I’ve got is docs revolver 
---
&gt;  I feel that without getting a truly unanimous agreement on adding it they shouldn't
---
That's never going to happen. There are always people who don't agree. Like you who disagrees for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the game. Remember when the ranked time per round changed from 4 to 3 minutes? Loads of people were against that but it improved the game dramatically. So no, we don't need an unanimous agreement at all.
---
&gt;the idea that it makes it more varied is discredited if they same few ops are always banned
---
But otherwise those ops are always played so it does make the game so much more varied if a lot of the time people can't play those ops. 
---
&gt; As for point notifications thats just your UI settings my dude.
---
That won't change an enemy spraying through a wall, getting a lucky few shots and knowing I'm down because it shows +50 injure on his screen. If you have ever played in a match with no point notifiers (competitive settings) you would know it would change the game completely. You need to actually gather intel yourself rather than just get it handed to you. Ranked at launch had no point notifications, time to return to that. 
---
It's gonna be Halo all over again, as soon as you put a plasma grenade on an enemy, then sprint at you.
---
I had 40°26'04 and 3°43'45
---
Droning? I hardly ever push an area without having it droned out by me or a teammates. Then if he has such a setup it's always great to get that easy kill. 
---
Yeah that’s a fair point. But there’s not that much detail on the Roadmaps usually, just confirmation of new operators and new map/rework each season. That definitely doesn’t take an hour (especially as the roadmap format is something the player base is familiar with).
---
My guess is that there’s something on there that they want to spend some time talking through, which I think is Operation Health 2.0... I could be wrong though and it could be tonnes of things... ranked coming out of beta... they might be putting operator rework on the roadmap... they might be changing how they structure seasons completely! Who knows!!!!
---
its casual lol
---
every gun except for the OTs(dunno about the slug shotguns) can only penetrate 1 wall, and a wall only decrease the damage by 50%. So looking at op's image in the comments this is most likely a bug.
---
Frost's is another example
---
how can you possibly be this sweaty, come on bro
---
*laughs in blitz main*
---
&gt;Casual - SI Playlist without bans.
---
And all the players who actually like casual just lose that way to play for some purpose which is...? I know it may be hard for people on this subreddit to believe, but more players are in casual than ranked today and many of those players might actually like the casual rule set. Additionally, many of those players have no desire to go into ranked so it wouldn't even serve the purpose of preparing them for the next rule set.
---
&gt;Ranked - Competitive rules... Just straight up ~~Pro League~~ Competitive rules. It's a competitive game mode, it should mirror competitive play. Maybe best of 10 rather than the current best of 14 rounds.
---
It can already be a challenge to balance if I have enough time to play one more ranked game or if I have to quit for the time being due to another commitment. But now I have to play at least 6 rounds for the match to win if it's a complete whitewashing? I'm all for updating the ranked ruleset to be closer to competitive play, but it's hard enough to get players to stay through an entire ranked match and doubling that time is unlikely to have a positive impact on that problem.
---
Sucks that I'm a Blitz main
---
Exacty my point not sure why i got down voted for it, and also Xbox is releasing the razor keyboard, by the looks like it next gen we will have keyboard and mouse as a native feature and controller gameplay become a more casual affair

The character on her jacket means "Tiger", and Doki's CTU is called the "White Tiger".
---
What do you mean? **Both guns are amazing!** And the AK is very easy to control, all the problems you have with it probably stem more from you than the weapon.
---
That's probably the reason
---
Yeah, the only viable shield is blitz, and that’s because of his speed plus keeping his shield up while sprinting plus his gadget. Recruit with shield is basically a joke as you can easily pick him off as he is slow and his shoulders are exposed.
---
If blitz didn’t have his speed, he’d be unable to rush points and thus be exposed at range. If blitz didn’t keep shield up while sprinting, that’s the same result. If blitz didn’t have his flash, he’d just be a faster shield recruit, and be gunned down a good percentage of the time. It’s the combination of the three that’s the problem.
---
Ireland, Australia, Mexico, India, South Africa, New Zealand just to name a few.
---
Is this skin universal?
---
I’d make all his shots go through shields. With how utterly immobile it is a shield operator could outmanoeuvre that fairly easily. Add in a significant damage reduction if it goes through the shield first as well and it might be fairly balanced. 
---
Because shields are badly designed
---
Perhaps
---
I have to leave for work so I think Ill end on what I hope is an Idea we can agree on
---
Seige needs a more balanced competitive expireince for players to have as an option
---
You feel adapting ranked with a new ruleset is the answer as it would promote an idividual competitive expirience
---
I feel a new playlist with a squad focus in mind is better
---
But we agree seige needs work.
---
I feel over this convo and another ive had im a bit more sold on having Pick and ban be an option
---
Perhaps like gametypes it can be a setting turned on or off and the whole squad needs it on to be implented that might be the nice middle ground here
---
We agree on pretty much everuthing except Pick and Ban (the three rounds thing I.just get bored doing it over and over but that might just be me)
---
I feel if Pick and Ban was optional like that it would help as people who want ot can play it bit those who dont arent forced to 
---
Lesion is good, u right
---
because aiming for the head is less rewarding than aiming for the chest, which is bad gameplay wise
---
Same with Semtex in MW2 
---
I'd keep searching, joining and playing matches. Unless the game was only just starting. Then I'd leave. 
---
The only changes I would like to see is allowing spwan / obj pick in casual, and Pick-Ban phase in ranked. Everything else should stay as is.
---
What you do in the privacy of your own home is all you. Even if I have no idea how one roller fucks themselves, you do you.
---
Ash's G36, not the most popular of the two but I'm proud to downgrade a bit to flex on nem hoes
---
Wait so I have a lore theory: clash is chankas wife??????
---
Meat slab?
---
I have seen similar things. I have solo queued and played with one or two friends. My opinion on these "toxic" bans is that those are irrelevant and not really a detriment to the system. If people feel like on this map we don't really have an op we feel is too strong against us or something similar and they ban "a random op" that doesn't really negatively affect anyone. 
---
Banning Lion and Blitz because you don't agree with the design of those ops is a fairly valid ban IMO. Say you want a match where you don't want to play against operators who you consider to low in depth such as mister "I pressed a button"(Lion). 
---
I think my point here is it that it doesn't really matter what people's idea behind a ban are. If they waste a ban, doesn't really matter. If they ban an op because of personal preference or ideas, doesn't really matter. You give players control over a match to a larger degree and add a fun new layer of depth that would be only very very slightly detrimental to maybe some people (Maybe people who personally don't like the idea of being told what they can't pick, but that's not really an ingame reason, more a personal one). 
---
I guess we will first get to experience another 3 weeks with this anyways. With the improved matchmaking of the following weeks I think it will be a lot better. 
---
Yikes
---
Bandit's mp7
---
maestro, kaid, montagne, fuse it would be better. 
---
If i kill them I do, if they kill me I dont, same with every operator
---
I can still feel the pain..
---
He becomes an offensive cav
---
Yes, love the game but shield ops are cancer 
---
Can't wait to test it tonight tbh, I feel it won't change much with the way I play her.
---
And to be fair I think you're the creepy one peeking through a peephole! 
---
Tryhard forever
---
Yes, of course, you CHOOSE to spend the first preparation phase preparing instead of shooting people right? It’s so obvious you can shoot people while they’re fucking droning amirite? Why have you never gotten any kills in the first 30 seconds of prep phase? Stop choosing to do that and get kills dude
---
Ugh .. I hate these people 
---
I personally feel like shields are way too dependant on luck at the moment to consider any change in functionality, as Ubi would probably screw them up more. Shield desync makes playing as a shield main, except for a rushing blitz of course, a question of "is my shield actually where I think it is" so I highly doubt that c4 would ever actually stick to it. 
---
It's because they don't really belong and fit in the Game in their current Status.
---
Something both too weak and too strong usually needs a rework 
---
Rddskiuobj
---
Thanks dude.
---
I mean you didn’t do rook dirty he uses mp5 therefore he is allowed to be dicked on
---
Ubisfoft is saving new updates for the invitational. Not gonna happen soon but I do want it too.
---
Not what I mean but okay. LUL
---
Depends on where you catch the shield guy. In an open-ish area, sure it's not hard to toss a C4 behind him assuming nobody's there to smash you from behind him. Catch him in a room where there's not much space and you'll 9/10 not catch it right, toss screwed up, and he survives.
---
I don't know, it an universal skin
---
I'm just trying to get these out there. This is probably the best someone told me to help me if you can
---
They can still get shot where their head would be and RNG headshot you with their pistol. Blackbeard can't survive a headshot either, his rifle shield can.
---
Please make this game-mode a standard option like casual, i want to try strats (picking site) and you cant do that in casual. I also really enjoy banning ops like Cav and Valkyrie :)
---
Wrong solution for this problem, you still need to be able to crouch and aim. It's the speed/jank that's the problem.
---
They promise servers and then do nothing. We'll never get servers in this region. I gave up.
---
Seriously, people in this part of the world pay full price and get nothing.
---
By your own logic arma is a fast paced shooter because you can die by a single bullet.
---
I only get maverick for maestro and echo most of the time 
---
I honestly play Thatcher and IQ more , but I love the horse so ..
---
Also every time I attempt to peek a whole in a corridor magically my teammates disappear and I meet a Caveira ..
---
For your nerf I feel like it'll be more challenging your pistol will feel like any other pistol , you'll have to rely on your M12 for long ranges unless you can slowly tap fire your pistol accurately on long ranges (which is harder on consoles) at least they changed the damage drop off to suite medium - long range better so it'll be better in that situation
---
Thatcher would have his hand through his masks 
---
Hmm... it’s a death sentence to the Montagne then.
---
Uh? Won't any shield (except deployed Montagne) die from a C4 literally at their feet (even when crouched) ? 
---
I'm not so certain now ^^
---
Yeah I agree. Doing the same with crouch wouldn’t do what you think it would
---
I have only one reaction:
---
*Aaawww*
---
Happy cake day 
---
With no interrogation 
---
Terrible idea. They don't need a nerf
---
I don’t want a full team of 3-speeds rushing with angled 552
---
Rework will definitely make him worse than he is now. So buy him if you want to try him out in his current state and also after rework.  But I have no doubt he will be very situational after the change.
---
I never thought shields were OP (console player btw).
---
I've noticed recently that a lot of problems with this game usually boil down to the one shot headshot.
---
Take shields out?
---
All western europe console players hate middle eastern high pingers that are mostly using mnk and crouch spamming. This Server issue foocks everyone up middle eastern people and europeans
---
Eh I think anyone killed by a peeking Monty with a revolver would disagree, not sure your angle here 
---
And of course rushing obviously isn’t a tactic because you say so, I guess.
---
Shields are fucking garbage.
---
We've been shown time and time again that elites work with other cosmetics and vice versa, why can't they just make slots for the ability skins and victory poses?
---
I think that the best solution would be a speed cap, basically what they did to dmr's a while back when people were using macros.
---
Capitao is a counter with his asphyxiation dart
---
Yeah don't think they will ever make any. Would prefer pops over chibis though.
---
get the upvotes to 69 nice
---
Crotchspam...
---
Another high quality post from a literate, upstanding member of the /r/rainbow6 community. 
---
What? Noooooooo please not that would make the worst ops in the game that much worse
---
I mean if the buffed the recoil on the Pro90 then we’d not be having this discussion. The Mp5 should not be the only viable gun. If people had used both guns the same amount there wouldn’t be a need for a nerf. Use the P90 and get used to the recoil and it’s better than the Mp5.
---
Just have every fifth bullet be AP.
---
Why change it when there was never really a problem with it?
---
Good point. Yeah that’s probably a better idea
---
WE LISTEN TO THE MONTY MAIN, THE MONTY MAIN AGREES.
---
U saw the win delta and pick rate? Rook is the best op with win rate and doc has a high win and pick rate so it is a decent but necessary nerf pls deal with it they have a acog no recoil and good abilitys with nearly no chance of failure.
---
"Ehu ehu shield op" 
---
Kapkan
---
Frost
---
Lesion
---
..*and other trap defenders* : "Laughes in distance*
---
Just buy the advanced edition when it goes on sale. You might have to make a separate ubi account but you don’t have to then go buy alll the base ops you will have them
---
Not surprising shoot an explosive with a pistol 
---
&gt;I do aim for heads?
---
"I rely on body hits for those smaller ops"
---
&gt;My KD is pretty positive
---
Your name?
---
blitz goes from a 2 speed 2 armor to a 12 speed 1/2 armor. ultimate bliz buff 
---
Monty becomes an x tyrant like from resident evil and becomes a 1 speed 35 armor with just his fists doing 35 damage a hit. 
---
I have faith in you. I dont spawn peek except when the other team is. I might be salty cause my main is getting nerfed. I love him too much :'(
---
you can just crouch and throw a nade at tachanka. 
---
Like the other one said they still get killed to easy and a shield won't take much damage till moving away but it's theoretical a decent idea 
---
So am i, rook is my homie too:(
---
Why? Because it's a good defense strategy that gets in the way of your precious Final 30 Second Rush?
---
Yeah very true everyone has some opinions. I don't like Cav for any other reason than she outplays me all the time. I'm rank 51 and still learn from every match.
---
From a distance yeah. But when a 3 speed is running up on my ass and i cant hope to beam a perfect head shot, unloading my clip into the chest is a saving grace.
---
True but he thought of this as being an alternative without changing his character too much. 
---
Bonus points for it being an Ela about to run out. 
---
What's the life span of a moth, so I can translate it into crows?
---
Which, for the reason above, is not a good idea.
---
Blitz currently suffers from terrible desync at the moment between your pov and the 3rd person pov. If you use him, you're better off playing more aggressively than that
---
Gives more people access to a glitch you hack?
---
How is he supposed to thank a kind stranger now?
---
I'm a hack because I think this is a good strategy, glitch or not?
---
Vsync is off. I get 80 frames at max graphics and 2k resolution. 
---
My biggest issues is sheilds.
---
like what
---
It's a rework considering one of his abilities is nerfved but it's compensated for heavily by others.
---
The problem with that is you cut the player base in two meaning even longer que times.
---
And yes, I tried bumping down my resolution and that did not help. I went down as far as 720 and it still kept me capped :/
---
Outplayed and outgunned 
---
i just didn't want to bog down the viewer with a bunch of unnecessary stuff. thanks for the critique :) i'll try and add more depth in the next vid
---
They definitely have to figure something out about banning the same operators if this is going to be implemented into ranked.
---
lol ikr like HES ACTUALLY A FUCKING ROCK!!!
---
Even in close range it’s pretty doable. You can also use the holo sight, which makes close quarters way easier.
---
Or the p90
---
Why do sheild even need to be nerfed they are fine. Blitz is a little strong right now but he is not broken.
---
Lmao bringing Lion to a 3v5, how scummy can you get?
---
eh not the shields themselves but maybe the glass
---
Pick and ban is a great mechanic and should definitely be in ranked. 
---
Audio glitches, shield inconsistencies , melee inconsistencies, lion, etc.
---
No can do, don't have the time during the week. If nobody has confirmed this until the weekend, maybe.
---
Clash can't sprint with the shield on and nitro cells can be shot. Only Blitz would be a problem with this setup, since he has the For Honor/Action RPG Shield Charge
---
Blackbeard when they nerf him again by taking his primary weapons
---
Happy cake day! Also i agree
---
I got my first ace via Fuze and 3 of the 5 kills were from a charge, doing well with Fuze is extremely satisfying despite those charges basically being near pure luck.
---
I think the solution is much more simple. The issue with shields is that it's a one shot kill game when it comes to headshots. So, remove their ability to hipfire. Make shields have to ADS in order to shoot back, ergo balancing the playing field. It also encourages team play, because you become moreso a big, bullet blocking drone.
---
As a proud blitz main, if they did this id just spend every attack round baiting them to throw the c4 on me.
---
Uhm.. Run?
---
We must stand strong in these trying times brother
---
Now to save up enough renown 
---
And after that i got the last kill. 
---
Im looking for people's opinions on blitz's shield
---
One time I was in a one v one situation as clash and I did the turtle back technique and got shot through my shield on the replay. Lol
---
Yeah that’s true 
---
And an ADS on a barricade.
---
Thank you, this was a fulfilling experience after all :)
---
For me its always the too weak one. 
---
Obviously Clash is excluded her pick rate would jump from -10% to +30% 😂
---
My last 9 of the last 10 have been all white mostly dupes. The one purple I opened is a skin I bought back in year 1.
---
I would advise waiting for it to go back on sale. It usually goes for about 15$ on summer or winter sales. I know that’s far :/ 
---
Is Bartlett U in the game anymore or did they just remove it for a while like favela?
---
No one draws clash or hibanna or pre surgery valk. Ela and dokki get all the love. Make ugly ops artist again! 
---
Even worse, they just walk straight into to the building instead of actually breaching where it's needed
---
i’ll downvote because this has been posted here 50000 times already

Oop, I misread. Then I'd say Blitz and Lion. But I also see Monty and Maverick on occasion.

Then they should fix the bug instead of adding this feature

How to turn down graphics from the lowest settings? ;)
---
Thanks!
---
I dont have a problem with the SMG 12 at all. It's high recoil but your supposed to burst fire to help control that anyway.
---
Rng recoil
---
It's so she can make interrogations
---
If your close enough to the C4 blast to just take damage but not get fragged you should get knocked over like the air jab
---
Yeah, claymores through a drone-hole isn't a new thing...but tagging somebody in the toe to make them run into it...that's legit
---
When using shield, block doing ‘q e’. The best nerf
---
I stand corrected- did not realize you could take a mat out while vaulting. Good to know!
---
Alexa this is so sad play what’s up pussycat. 
---
Bro i don’t care if you downvote or how often this has been posted before
---
Im just trying to make it happen 
---
Thats all i want
---
1. You’ll still two shot people at the same ranges
---
2. Yes recoil exists, you should learn how to deal with that
---
3. Attacker with ACOG at a great distance vs. Caveira, if a Caveira decides to take a fight where she’s at an obvious disadvantage then she deserves to die
---
It's not that big of a deal with Montagne, but they should indeed do something about Blitz.
---
Yup, on a random bus I hopped on one day. Big beard and welding goggles. My driver looked like he came from a Steampunk universe.
---
DETAILS
---
check your whisper mode settings in your GeForce. 
---
if you don’t requeue after 2 minutes then you’re just wasting your own time 
---
Attacking shield ops don't need to be nerfed, their low armaments are bad enough without making c4 a direct counter. Clash on the other hand...
---
Id like clash with some Brazilian weave and gold name plate. Hibana chewing gum with a cocky grin and pre surgery valk with a football helmet. Can this be done?

---
I like your Maestro idea, but for Alibi I would prefer one where we could see her face
---
This is why you should not wait for a game within 33 minutes.
---
How about just getting knocked backwards, but not to the ground? Similar to how clash's shield gets knocked away when meled.
---
Thats is a lot my man and im just an art student but ill try to photoshop a mockup in the next couple of days and we'll see if it hits your mark
---
The event was great because I didn’t have to play against a Blitz the whole time. I’d be happy with no rewards for that incentive alone. 
---
The Time Travel Bus! Sounds like fun.
---
Thx dude

&gt;"Ace With One Claymore" clip

me too
---
I'm assuming that part of the head's hitbox was peeking through the shield. That, or the bulletproof glass is now plastic.

Is this the new meta? Crouching and leaning side to side like an utter maniac? If so... thinking I'll stay away till somethings done about it, looks infuriating.

---
Wow this is epic
---
This is why I hate Reddit. Nothing is ever good enough. The purpose of the game is slow and methodical and to position yourself to not get headshot in the first place yet it's all the game's fault because you decided to blinded rush OBJ with no plan like it's Call of Duty. I've been playing since launch and have seen this game devolve into a shell of it's former self. Where instead of strats the community has resulted to "who can win a 1v1 gun fight in the middle of a cramped room?"
---
Nope, it's all the game's fault, Ubi sucks major corporate penis, 1 hit kill headshot sucks, shields suck and I want a 3 speed - 3 armor operator that has an underbarrel, shootable exothermic charge. Oh and cosmetics should be 100% free.
---
ok sorry but every op does need a counter, but a simple buff would be only necessary, not a whole rework
---
It's not just you I have a 970 and 16 GB of ram and it still happens occasionally. A lot more in the past month from what I've noticed. But it also USUALLY sorts itself out in the next match. 
---
Naaah it would make the game too static
---
We don’t need this all shields are balanced
---
At beginner levels, you can just run&amp;gun and not care about his ability too much. 
---
If you want to know how his SMG feels, I suggest playing Kapkan for some time.
---
Alexa, play Despacito
---
It's across all platforms to be honest
---
One idea I thought of for Tachanka was his turret is made to be remote controlled so he can use his operator ability to ping an area and his turret would lay covering fire on that area. Tachanka would have to get on the turret and reload it to use it again but other than that it wouldn't have too many charges since he only has 2 or 3 spare magazines.
---
100fps trashcan btw 
---
Why he is useless because he can't move so how should a buff rly help? 
---
Thanks for the trick, I might try that when I'm doing them solo. With my buddies, we just run around, run out, just dick around the whole time and it takes away some of the tedium 
---
I think the operator and the unique ability are made semi separately. For example, i believe they rushed up a hard breaching operator ability (X-Kairo Pellets), and attached it to a model they had already been making, Hibana.
---
The model will just have to be voiced to say everything, just in case
---
A single c4 should not be the only defense against a shield wtf how is this balanced. Miss a c4 in a 1v1 and that’s it? Use it for a wall? Sorry no defenses against shields
---
Yep, I searched it up and it was on google images.

Most characters have potential to do great given experience and practice but vigil isn't part of the meta rn. I totally agree that he's a cool character and recommend that you pick up characters you like as a beginner. However, he's not a favorite among the higher ranks. By all means, use him, he's fun as hell but keep in mind that you'll get some dirty looks from your team once you get to plat or higher gold ranks.

Just making conversation I suppose. I dont like to play ranked, I prefer to just chill and play for fun, sometimes I do good, other times not so much, but I just get annoyed when Im trying to have a chill time and theres some sweat treating casual like its a pro league game and he's got 1.8 million on him winning the game, and I just want to see if anyone else has experienced it or if its just me and my little group of friends that play siege. 
---
Why am I not surprised? Lol
---
I'm a bit confused how you didn't see him moving around at all.
---
because theyre pussys
---
it's a 190% with 5 boosters. their is an additional 40% for a full group so instead of 150 its 190
---
Vigil is a very selfish operator who only brings two impact grenades for team utility. He is 100% a fragger and time waster. It's ok to use Vigil as a newer player if you have above average aim for your skill level and you are comfortable with the idea that roamers should waste as much time as possible for the attackers, which means staying alive and being a thorn in the attacking team's side is often more important than getting an early frag and then getting traded out.
---
Generally, it's recommended for newer players to use ops that bring good utility so you are helping your team even if you die. Jager is a great defensive op to start with because his utility is always useful (he had three active defense systems that can each catch two throwables like flashes or grenades, like a BO4 trophy system). You put them down at the beginning of the round and then you can go frag, and Jager also has one of the best guns on defense, if not the best. Jager is also a good pick on every site in the game.
---
He is my main, and I love him.
---
Find a hiding spot in high traffic areas and partner him with a trap operator and you’re set, I tend to turn my game volume right up and when I hear a drone approaching I’ll activate his ability to avoid being droned out.
---
If you want to be a  mega annoyance his ability is great for running to the other side of the map at the end of prep phase and trying to get those cheeky spawn kills. Just make sure you have a rotation back to site planned out or you might find yourself in some trouble.
---
Considering that shields are meant to block the blast, no they shouldnt die.
---
Then again, how would c4 clipping through shields not be an issue? 
---
so basic but so funny thats reddit for ya

beav125 ive seen you before stop being mean, man wants a stegosaurus charm
---
But what if Blackbeard just "switches" to his second shield.......
---
Welcome to Reddit's gaming community
---
but his turret is really good and has a shield. plus if a monty blocks the doorway he has to move, so a shield-breaching turret is another counter to his few.
---
Use him for buying time! Open a spawn peak window, activate his ability and your already won 15-30 sec. Always fall back after a gun fight, you don't need to frag just buy some time! 
---
My biggest takeaway from this is that you drop defuse if you get hit with the air jab while planting 
---
Mira lacks the speed, flashbangs and damage per bullet.
---
I was born a gamer
---
y u downvote. "sstarts playing mad world
---
I had an the same issue with villa. I just uninstalled and installed and that seemed to fix the problem 
---
People really think shields should be nerfed or this guy just had a very unlucky match?
---
Most of these people complaining about shields probably didn't play when c4 would kill through shields making them useless. 
---
Ever wanted to become a surgeon in childhood?
---
r/ididsomethingright
---
Oh ok awesome I’ll do that then thanks you. 
---
I was playing in yr 1 season 1
---
Or after he puts up how barricade the wood ones stay up so the enemy doesn’t know there up until they break the wood could by the defenders crucial seconds or alert roamers to a flank opportunity 
---
No, that was a horrible map
---
It’s equally as bad as favela. 
---
No, nothing transfers.
---
I have also transferred from PS4 to PC. Have all season passes and elite skins for PS4. Still worth it tho.
---
You might wait till the 16th of February as I expect a sale during the invitational
---
I agree completely. Ranked is so toxic because half the players don't want to be playing ranked, but just want to play a mode that isn't garbage. 
---
They already said they're fixing crouch spam. Glitches and exploits will always be a part of live games, get over it 
---
Last I checked, downed players have 20 health, and Twitch zaps only deal 10. So you can get 2 and 1/2 at most. Although that might have changed. I'm not sure.
---
Ok. I was talking about the "y" pronunciation,  but sure.
---
So throw c4 on shield, shield rushes you, if you don’t blow it, you die, if you do you die. Shield survives
---
How exactly is this a nerf
---
Agreed!!
---
In all seriousness though, I do think an extra welcome mat or two wouldnt be a bad idea. Theyre pretty easy to spot and avoid so it would give her one or two more wouldnt be that op. 
---
How can someone be such a high level and have the worst rank? I'm level 86 and plat 3
---
Outnumbered, outplanned
---
Smh
---
you shot above that man
---
its supposed to be the competitive mode so hostage will probably never come 
---
Damn, wish there was one for bandit.
---
any recommendations?
---
Good suggestion! My problem however is clash..
---
I enjoy the settings, but I also don't see much point in playing without it affecting my elo and people constantly dropping out, it's also a bit frustrating for everyone else in a lobby with me and myself that I am dia and matched with dead average players, because I only ever play ranked  
---
I want this in ranked, whether 6th pick is a good idea is debatable, though
---
For me probably more like 5 years ago lol
---
If you have c4, you've countered a shield. 
---
Out claymored
---
That was the second bullet
---
Awful. Instant kill for Monty when he's fully extended. Blitz and recruits can at least try to shoot you before you can set it off but Monty goes from standing up with no pistol to flat on his ass with his shield on his back.
---
Yea im going w muzzle now thank you!
---
Nomads great for perimeter watch
---
i will have to try that. i usually double tap windows and doorways as kapkan so attackers can enter quickly and not have the patience to find traps
---
Are they the only ones you need to buy?
---
Nomad is 100% better than Lion. Are they the only two you don’t have?
---
That wasn’t very nice :(
---
Hibana
---
What about console who can only lean when adsing
---
hit him in the clavicle 
---
Yeah the second one for sure but it slightly looks like you can see the debris from the first bullet hit the wall behind him
---
I mean, it makes sense that he didn't know. You can still be mad at him for not trying to credit but you don't have to claim he knew all along and didn't credit out of spite.
---
You have an extraordinarily low bar for the quality of ideas, then. Especially for a guy with Monty as his icon. C+P'ed my comment from above: "Awful. Instant kill for Monty when he's fully extended. Blitz and recruits can at least try to shoot you before you can set it off but Monty goes from standing up with no pistol to flat on his ass with his shield on his back."
---
I feel like they should just match up M&amp;K players Vs M&amp;K Players Ubi Should Work with Sony and Microsoft to find a way to detect M&amp;K so they know who to match up 
---
I think ***:/***
---
Uuuooooffff
---
I have more locked attacking operators but so far i really only have considered these two
---
This is the content I’m on reddit for
---
Hmm.. i always thought thermite was enough 
---
This is a really usefull tip but it’s been widely used and common knowledge for a while hasn’t it? 
---
Thank you !
---
looks like he's been sippin on his own poison
---
Nope, just what i considered so far
---
Yea your aim is pretty hilarious
---
Multiverse 
---
Everyone peek it's a glaz !
---
- The enemy team probably 
---
Yep. Once you learn that you can orient it. Sometimes the spot was right but the charge was 90 degrees off. 
---
You can get in the radius of activation and sprinting out of it immediatly after, it will detonate but you wont die :) 
---
I love the 3 that are most commonly banned 
---
Blitz 
---
lion
---
And my main
---
So Ana from overwatch, but somehow *more* annoying?
---
When it's 4/5 bans and the whole lobby had to wait the entire countdown.
---
... .. ..... . .. .... ...
---
Being capped? Secure? Maestro on Secure? There's your problem right there.
---
How do the air jabs work?
---
Watch macie jay, get flanked and few other good streamers. 
---
Surely directing you to the correct sub is the exact definition of being helpful. 
---
Also you can ban Maverick and Caveira cause fuck those ops.
---
No reload necessary. I feel like that gun is underrated 
---
I droned out first but the throw was lucky
---
Sure if things like comms between teammates, or basic deductive reasoning on where the enemy was wasn't a thing.
---
You don't want your drone spotted?
---
Tf is a weeaboo? 
---
The red dot sucks, but I can live with it. The real question is why OP has DOF on (I can only assume that's the cause of the unholy blur on the stock of his gun).
---
Oh shit, from the thumbnail I'd assumed the left one is actually a gal at first... shame on me
---
I'm still in the camp of thinking Clash is good, she just isn't used well in matchmaking. But shields in general will always be OP.
---
Have you even played this game? None of these people have social skills.
---
Sometimes backing out after 5 mins and re searching seems to help find a game quicker. You can press the text chat button to check if other players have loaded in.
---
Are you new to the internet?
---
This pic is as old as mute himself
---
Oh my God it's Morse code but sorry I don't really know Morse code I can't decipher that
---
pretty sure Rook armor has no effect on damage. it just puts you in DBNO from anything but a headshot 
---
Even then its annoying to shoot her legs.
---
Wait a minute
---
HA burst fire, no you get into their face and unleash a volly of death into them.
---
well old seasonal weapon skins is what I was looking for or the ones they give out at events
---
r/asdfmovie
---
No rook armor gives you a base damage reduction for shots to the chest
---

Why repost something that was posted yesterday?
---
I been having the problem where I'm in the east coast and for no reason I just get randomly place in central servers 😔
---
I had to make sure that wasn't my username because I did the exact same thing, in the exact same location against the exact same operator before.
---
In my opinion the 3/3 split allows your team to better strategize and learn from the previous round.
---
Whenever they play that site I always rush the first hatch in visa, they never expect it and I just drop directly into site in 15 seconds
---
Who Knows (TM)?
---
Not tge way I expected, but I guess it works...
---
Kapcans TRAPS
---
I think they should just make this the new casual just remove pick and ban or just make it random
---
Yeah, people have been doing this for over a year now, but I can appreciate OP’s effort.
---
I Get That But I Think Its Too Long 2/2 I Would Work With.
---
At this point they are being banned more as a meme...if you don't know how to properly counter them you're probably a copper
---
Depends on map and objective. She can range from completely useless to down right immortal. Good gadget symmetry with team helps too
---
No she was born in Japan you can’t be a weaboo if you’re Japanese in origin. Weaboos are foreigners who think they are Japanese because they watch anime or similar stuff 
---
And some bone breaking sounds.
---
Oh, i wasn't defending Clash. Fuck Clash. I was just saying a slight counter.
---
Honestly the only things I want in casual are spawn and site pick, otherwise casual is fine imo.
---
That map was pure cancer but I loved the look of the outside and the interior. It was the entry points and sheer number of windows that were the main issue. I don't see how its all that hard to reduce the number of windows. Although I remember them hyping that it had over 100 windows or some shit in the trailer for it lmao.
---
Facts
---
Doing it 1 or 2 times isn’t spamming...you need to sort your terminology. 
---
Ive had this happen a few times. 
---
data caps
---
Exactly what every run out deserves 
---
Pic shows the superposition of the game mode :D
---
I feel you, I just went from a gold 4 to a bronze 3
---
C4 is loud, but the noise doesn’t travel far; you won’t know it’s there until it’s too late. And even if you do, think of the ways it can be hidden using cover. Seriously, just plop a C4 on a Clash and have her hide around a corner or in a doorway... that shit will be exploited so hard, so why even introduce it into the game?
---
Yep
---
In Pro League it's even 6 rounds
---
I feel like I'm missing a joke here 
---
One word; Blitzkrieg. 
---
I ban Thermite or Hibanna. Whoever is more powerful on the map we are playing
---
And echo. Fuck echo
---
So I think I figured out the frames issue. Back when I first installed R6S on this computer (the 2700X build), I had to set CPU affinity to only use 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14. For some reason that was the only way to get the game to not crash. Well after changing litterally every other setting one at a time, I figured, "hey, the only thing I haven't touched is CPU affinity. Let's reset it to default." Boom. No more frame drops, and only the "normal" ping issues we've come to expect from anything ubisoft. Check your CPU affinity and if it's changed from default for whatever reason, try resetting that and see if that helps.
---
Does it record stats? As it is, it's weird you have ranked stats showing when playing casual.
---
had to check the username on ELA cause this happened to me 2 days ago on the same door
---
r/tworedditorsonecup?
---
Alright, so if you're going to start now, I won't be able to make it in time, but if you are going to start later, then I'll show up with him.
---
If not possible, then we can arrange another game some other day. 
---
Old Season skins did not come from the pass. Everyone had access. You can't obtain them anymore, outside of black ice from alpha packs. Ditto for events.
---
One event only gave 1500 renown, the other one was a pack.
---
No clue brotha
---
Heard it was a bug related to battleye. A pro player I was watching a little bit back mentioned this exact scenario happening to a friend. 
---
this would make Cav basically useless. no thanks. 
---
One challenge gave you a pack, the other gave 1500 renown. It says it for them in the challenge menu.
---
It’s a joke mostly
---
Yo I have that mask too
---
Actually Pro League Is 10 Rounds First To 6 and A Tie Potential 
---
Whats your gamertag
---
Frost, jager
---
Thermite,jackel(map depending)
---
Or having a Blitz up against a balcony/windows and launching his ass off the side a la **SPARTA style.
---
I really think this is their plan. I hope, can’t happen soon enough.
---
1: I was tired so you’re right I should explain it more. Basically I was trying to say when ubi puts in new characters they make new guns for them, instead of reusing other guns that have been used already 
---
2: it could be 1 and 3 but in my opinion I think it should be 2 and 2
---
Probably just lag tbh
---
Oh yeah, I hate playing against a good clash
---
It used to, for a reason they dont anymore
---
GIVE ME THE SAUCE BITCH
---
Ostrich stick head in ground. No see ostritch.
---
This used to happen to my friend once every couple weeks! For some reason installing siege on his external hard drive fixed the issue. 
---
Most likely lag 
---
He means they switch roles every 6 rounds
---
That’s what I think but it also happened to my friend 
---
&gt; People who are EU and PS4 players
---
What do you mean by EU? I am from the Mid East, but I play on WEU servers with a 100 ping. I have been trying to form a team for a while, to no avail, so are you okay with playing with that ping?
---
&gt; 2/3 hours in the evenings is perfectly fine.
---
Evening means, what exactly? I play usually around 10pm - 1am UK time.
---
Yeah while that does look a little suspicious, sprinting footsteps are hella loud.   Hacking on console is basically impossible so I’d just say it was him being soundwhored.  Plus there’s a camera right where he ran past, Frost’s teammate could’ve called him out (if that happens at the level you play at)
---
Please read what the packs do instead of complaining 
---
I had it on my main ssd.. sucks that thats the solution.
---
Why is blitz constantly banned though? I understand lion being banned but I don't feel like blitz is a problem
---
Weird..
---
Watch yo boy Roy's inside the mind of a diamond series. 
---
It's actually first to 7 now
---
Still didnt work I guess her pistol just doesn’t count
---
Whoever was screaming needs to get a life. Whoever screams over a video game is just sad, including for such a mediocre task.
---
Killcams are hella bugged right now.  Look at his rappel line in the kill cam, definitely just a bug
---
Wait why?
---
I As a Partial Cav Main Know Shes Controlled By Droning And Jackel.
---
Having a bad day or something? 
---
We solved the issue of casual being boring by going into Ranked with a idgaf attitude. Fuck a rank, we went in had fun. Tachanka mains and Clash spawn peeks. 
---
Lol just quit ur job 4head 
---
Yes...
---
I don’t know I’m low 200s so it’s a possibility but it looks really suspicious that he followed exactly what he did though 
---
I didn't know I needed this before... HOLY FUCK $89,99!?
---
Learn how to use a phone Jesus Christ
---
Terrible and gamebreaking. Would ruin most maps balance wis by alloeing absurdly fast, risk free rotates.
---
Watch loads of pro league, pick up on their strats and even the little things they do, I saw a G2 Valkyrie cam placement on back that I now use every game.
---
Blitz is *thicc* and *wide*
---
It's almost like the game is better without cancer operators like Lion, Blitz, Clash, and Maestro.
---
Okay. We must have read it wrong
---
I'm with u. I dont like the 3 rounds then switch. Im not a fan. But I do like the ban Lion,Blitz,Echo,Mira feature
---
That's called team death match
---
You wouldn't dare...
---
r/UnexpectedHamilton 
---
You mean Kixstar?
---
nah
---
Haha nah mate, but thank you. 
---
Please understand that I was asking a question and not complaining. Me and my friend must have misread what the rewards were. In fact me and 7 of my friends must have. Don't be a dick.
---
Any UK time by preferably about 6-9pm. It doesn’t matter to me because I’m on all day every day lmao. By the ping, it’s not to so much for me but for you. If you’re fine with 100 ping and it doesn’t cause to to perform worse than usual then, by all means, I’m happy to have you :) However, if you normally drop 8 kills and only 1 due to 100 pong then thats not very ideal. 
---
If you willl be playing later, I should be on in about  3-4 hours
---
Ok whatever I'm done arguing 
---
Playing against bad people and steamrolling isn't fun either 
---
When it gets fixed, it likely won't be an issue, stating it as a reason to need shields is just wrong.
---
Get a better gaming chair and you’ll make up to it in no time.
---
Yo! This is the cosplayer. Cosplay insta is @stronzocosplay
---
Working on a maestro and I did recruit. Check that shit out.
---
i hope they quarantine lion for the next road to SI weekend
---
Why does everyone ban Lion and Jackle?
---
I remember he mentioned that this same bug only happened to games that used battleye. I personally have not had this problem but I would try to contact Ubisoft or battleye themselves for help.
---
when you buy the year passes you are promised a myriad of items (skin, charm, bonus renown, r6 credits, ect) and I have only ever gotten the ops and maps. never anything else when I buy the pass on both xbox and PC (except the newest pass I was actually given everything)
---
Why don't like it?
---
one twitch zap kills a downed player i do it all the time
---
True, BUT I WANT THAT HEADGEAR
---
lol
---
Yea I guess that makes sense.
---
Towers
---
Only because there is no matchmaking 
---
My group bans Monty and Echo every game.
---
As a Blitz/Caveira main, fuck this gamemode lol
---
Yeah, I can see why this rework would pretty much break the game.
---
We had ADS' all over the place, and they used all 3 Fuze charges outside the room.
---
It’s @r6fire.  Nice throw!
---
**THEY’RE BATTERING DOWN THE BATTERY, CHECK THE DAMAGES**
---
Nice
---
This would be a good change but I don’t think it should work on Monty while his shield is extended because of the way that his shield supports it (it would be okay since you can concuss him and then knock him over
---
Favourite map?
---
But shields aren't OP. Look at the win deltas
---
This makes me sad, I can't use blitz's elite if he's always banned
---
Oh hey Thanks bro
---
University classes were just cancelled for the next two days (6th time in University history that classes have been cancelled for cold weather), so I may be able to get back with you sooner than expected!
---
talk about dedication 
---
Everything I’ve said is based on other commentary in this thread where the shield op survives the C4 blast.
---
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
---
You said if you cant counter the ops mentioned by op, you are prob a copper.
---
Lion and blitz and banned like ever time
---
One is banned from esl
---
One is like,  nearly universally considered hyperaids
---
Oh THE STUPID DEATH ANIMATIONNNNNNNNNN
---
I mean it's round 1 though you silly slut
---
I mean, you find me someone who enjoys playing against Lion, Blitz, Dokkaebi etc every defensive round. I don't think they exist...
---
Lol shoulda reposted a less obvious one, this has been on the sub multiple times before 
---
Tilted Towers. You know from fortnite. And, whenever I solo queue I always get paired with people that barley know how to lean and even aim, but everyone on the enemy team was diamond last season (they have the Charm) and are abusing the broken ranked system.
---
It isn't borderline cheating, it is cheating. 
---
Just blast people through walls like the Airjabs.
---
That must be ironic
---
Cool, so a defender ran into dead nomad’s jab and knocked back zofia. Epic
---
Yeah, I'll  take a hard-nope on that
---
If it makes you feel better I don't pick Blitz a lot.
---
Hmmmmmmmmm
---
Bank.
---
After 5 minutes restart the queue, it does that sometimes
---
I play in pretty high plat elo, and I have never had a problem with monty. Most likely for the sole reason people mainly run Blitz
---
As a Monty main, all I can do is thank Blitz for taking the heat this time.
---
I didn't even notice your flair. I was just explaining why any rank above Gold 2 is aids and butchers the game. Even Pros don't wanna touch ranked because of the state of it.
---
I would say maverick for offense just cause he is fun to play and pretty strong. Get maestro for defense, his lmg is a beast and his gadget is very useful.
---
Right, but the SG-CQB is a beast as well. It’s probably a little awkward running it on a 1 speed though.  It also has a vertical grip, unlike the M590. Throw a laser sight on it and hipfire those fools.
---
I wanted to get one... but at 6'7 the 2XL being 29"/74cm long is mad short... would be a belly hoodie for me =(
---
Every operator has an easy counter but bad players don't recognize that. Lion is countered by mute, armored walls, anyone decent at anchoring, and OH YEA! STANDING STILL lol 😂
---
never played it bc i dont have aids. you ever heard of looking for a group? may take a while but usually with joining a group theres atleast 1 person that knows what they are doing and you get along with
---
Yo, I bought Valk, now I have Zofia. Would defo. recommend her
---
I dont know if I'm the only one but I hate the mode. Everyone becomes a problem league wannabe super try hard and does the most toxic strategies to win. Not fun at all for me.
---
Honestly Ash is kinda a wasted ban 
---
Restart after 2 min. Otherwise you’re in mm limbo.
---
she moaned while getting hammered. Nice. 
---
Add me: Harry Balzac
---
It takes way too long to finish.
---
I like (current) casual more than because I can get more games played in less time. Ranked is toxic and annoying.
---
R2SI is fun if you have a bunch of time to do it. It takes about 40-60 minutes to complete a game, and if you work in the morning and play after you eat dinner (like me), you're looking at 2-3 games before you pack it in. I'm not a big fan of that
---
Oh I guess I shouldn't of said anything... But the people that ruin ranked for me are the people that abuse it. I think more people will stick with it longer once they fix the ranked system
---
I would main this op and while my shield is up I would just blow a bunch of people up
---
It always confuses me why people ban kaid, he’s super easy to counter unless thatcher is banned, but without his claws he’s just a slow old man with bad guns
---
I like that name 😂😂😂
---
All skill no luck 
---
Exactly, trigger the sweaty nerds before the match even starts
---
I vote Jackal because I prefer tracking gadgets but Zofia is good as well so it’s all preference
---
I’ve noticed also that your player model doesn’t even actually crouch until well after you push the button, so the server side actually nerfs that problem in Battlefield and CoD.
---
Yeah it’s a game with a lot of m suspicious looking kills.  I can’t imagine how the anti-cheat sorts through at all!
---
I think that's supposed to be a joke
---
Sometimes I feel like a nerd for all the little things about siege that I know lol my teammate kept doing this last game and he didn’t believe me when I said defenders can insta defuse by breaking hatch 
---
knowledge pls gib (o´ω｀o)
---
Yep, she literally has EVERYTHING
---
Agian, I can still outgun an ash purely by my own abilty to aim and land headshots. She has to have good aim to to beat that.
---
Blitz doesn't require aim and he doesn't require more game sense than the average operator. He just rushes and blinds you while sitting behind a bullet proof shield. He's a 1v1 crutch op who has no place being where is in terms of power. 
---
Thanks. Finally a normal reply.
---
LITTERALY
---
True. Not to mention Battlefield is just a perfect game when it comes to player mechanics 9 times out of 10.
---
Or, just add a 3rd. Anyone who tries to make the argument about splitting the playerbase is just being stupid. It's one of the biggest multiplayer games currently and other multiplayer games easily deal with a stack of different matchmaking lobbies. There is literally no reason to not add it as a 3rd option.
---
I didnt know this. So yay. Thanks op!
---
Fair
---
Its our rank
---
*Tachanka slowly walks towards you with a proud smirk* "I promote you to comrade!"
---
saying this cuz here are people who legit believe thats a rank but ok buddy
---
I need to see it in game, it doesn’t seem that great to me.
---
Someone teach the enemy team how to make callouts for god's sake
---
this happened like 2 days ago, can you find the video?
---
We were on a break. It was tough. But I feel that if this mode becomes permanent we will be able to get back together again. :}
---
I have a girlfriend btw but this is a different type of relationship - a love/hate one. 
---
Only console things lmao.
---
i second that, its nice to have more insight on my stress levels 
---
+1 for 5 stacking
---
me and several of my friends play ranked actively seeking to get better (because cas won't ever help)  and we've mostly encountered boosters, people throwing, and teammates who refuse to comm, it's rough.
---
we want to be high gold just to avoid the fuckery of silver, but matchmaking is a joke so we end up with the silvers and play against the high golds
---
IDK remember but I recognize the voices.
---
Won't argue over that. Global abilities in general are annoying. Seriously though, I hate finka more than lion. Getting steamrolled by a team high on nanobots pisses me off. Trap ops on defense become staple.
---
Socialism for dummies 
---
Maestro is stronk 
---
Lesion or Maestro
---
No, I don't think it does. I think that since the operators are essential to many strategies in the game, they would still all have their same uses, except for the few people who only use certain operators for their guns.
---
And you do realise that if you let the Blitz get to you that’s on you, there’s so many things stopping him from getting to you and if he manages to get to you then it means ya royally fucked up somewhere between the lines and obviously it’s a punishment like for example fucking up a bandit trick, you mess up then the thermite can do as he wants/ you don’t do the many things to stop the Blitz getting on ya ass he can do what he wants 
---
People on this thread are getting wooshed for OP asking for explanation wtf

---
Is this toxic or skill 🤔
---
It is a good idea indeed. But this only works if you plant the defuser right next to the bomb. Easy to cover from below and hard to disable. He just planted to far on the hatch.
---
I just want maverick to be able to use the suppressor or angle grip and not suck ass. He’s fine with muzzle break and vertical grip. 
---
I remember defensive ash. I don’t want that back, I do want the gun to be a little better with side to side spread however. She doesn’t have impacts and her gun is basically just a faster P90 with Tourette’s syndrome, let’s just lower its Tourettes a little bit. 
---
No.

I pick Cav more than any other. Dealing with her is a nuisance even with good teammates.
---
Is this event still going on?

There is huge difference between secure and bomb. There is a reason Secure is not considered competitive and people often make fun of players who stick to secure and hostage instead of bomb... Soloq is not a problem if you are familiar with meta and know callouts and positions. I'd say best is to find a group of people to play with and check some VODs of teams playing bomb on different maps. Throughout few rounds, you will "learn" default setups for both attack and defence and just in general get to understand the flow of round.
---
  
---
Forget everything you learned in secure area.
---
There's a seperate (hidden) casual MMR. 
---
Just do it. I turned off everything but bomb as soon as I hit gold1 and it’s been so much better since. You’ll get used to it eventually.
---
It was a joke. They completely missed it. So did u. r/woooosh 
---
I'm sorry you feel that way
---
How you put what op you main next to name???
---
I feel like lions concept to be a pushing op is a good idea, but it was just executed very poorly. We could use someone that can push like lion does, but why use a motion detector drone? Moving around is very important in siege as a defender, where positioning and repositioning can give a good advantage, but what's the point if you just get restricted for a few seconds and have a man in a yellow suit gun you down?
---
By the way, lions gun is also the major flaw in him, in does 45 damage and has 50 bullets, you could at least make the defenders have a chance against him 
---
Whats your favorite attachement?
---
They are testing it for the general public to probably replace ranked with this
---
Us Echo players have feelings you know :(
---
The other day I encountered a team that picked no ban twice. Was really confused.
---
Had that happen to me! I was the only one to connect. A second connected right in time to get auto picked for first round. A third connected during the second round. :/
---

In a thick russian accent:
---
I’ve played maverick for a while, he’s easy to shoot when you notice him. 
---
Main issue with his gun is that the only really viable option is muzzle break and vertical grip, the side to side recoil just ends up too bad without one of them to be able to use consistently, I should have clarified that the vertical recoil is pretty okay and it’s the horizontal which needs a little lowering. 
---
He does need to be louder however, but not as loud as the other breachers, as he is kinda made for stealth in that regard. Maybe make that distinctive falling metal sound occur more with him, or make the look of when he’s burning it more obvious. 
---
Also forgive my bad spelling errors. It was posted on mobile and I didn't read it too well
---
Probably at lower ranks people are sick of spawn peeking... its so cancerous
---
Pros need to warm up for Pro League, we don't need to warm up for ranked. 
---
First time?
---
Ok but if I get caught out of position by any other non shield operator, it still comes down to them having to out gun me for me to die, they still have to play better than me to kill me, while blitz just gets to win by rushing and blinding, so again, hes a crutch. 
---
any operator that lets you win the majority of your 1v1 engagements is a bad idea in a skill based shooter. You hate ash for that reason so why does blitz get a free pass even though he is demonstrably more of crutch than ash in that environment? Why the double standard?
---
So many downvotes from a simple question.  You people are too sensitive.
---
I do the same thing but with Fuze...
---
Works every time.
---
Coming right up
---
For the games I was in, it was mainly Blitz, Cav, Clash and Maverick. Lion was only banned once.
---
Tachanks. Recruit can use good guns (mp7, f2, r4c) whereas tachanks doesnt have good guns. Recruit can use good utility (c4, frags, flashes) whereas tachanks is stuck with deployable sheild and barbed wire.
---
Only on weekends leading up to the six invitational
---
Quality banter right here. 
---
Oh ok thanks

He ranks down on purpose (ruining other peoples matches by conceding) to be in Copper 4, then dominates everyone and thinks he is such a cool dude for doing this, while in reality he is just ruining the coppers games for his virtual dicksize
---
No idea, never heard of it. I don't think everyone posts about it 20x a day on this sub. 
---
So since your point is nullified I'm copper? Alright. Enjoy being harstuck gold on console complaining about keyboarders you casual.
---
Dont quote me on that though thats what ive seen on this reddit on sunday.
---
That shouldn't be the point of cosmetic skins. It should be there for people to have fun with customizing their operators looks and why leave new players out of that? It's not important to the game itself. Maybe if they had some really high end gear that you actually had to earn like dark matter in call of duty then yea but there isn't except diamond. My point is that I think a lot of newer players would love to have some of the old stuff so why can't we? Just because we didn't play a few months ago? That's silly. Whether it be from buying or earning I think every player should be able to have access to them. If they re-released that jager pro skin would you not buy or try to unlock. Of course you would!
---
Yes 
---
I use eco but not as much as blitz 
---
Ban phases basically just turn games into “no fun allowed: the video game.”
---
Hey guys this may be a stupid question, how do I get those things next to my name, the badge like things everyone else has.
---
IE: Fuze main
---
Monty extended should not be affected. You can aim your C4 over him and kill him. 
---
This would make C4's more viable with Blitz, who has time to fuck off before you get to detonate. 
---
The idea is good, but this will just split the playerbase up a lot and make queue times even more annoying. 
---
But as a zofia main lol. I do think vigils is badass though
---
Or in tracker-cancer teams: combined with any of Lion, Jackal, and Dokk.
---
Explain "Abuse", and I mean REALLY explain it. I'm pretty sure most of this "abuse" can apply to more than just Ash.
---
Oh fairs aha the good chibi is super nice

C7E. Recoil &gt; dps
---
My friend saw me writing this and said “what version is that” and I’m disappointed in him now.
---
I just replied to another comment with the same thought. I think only Blitz or an unextended Monty. Blitz is fast enough to get out of the C4 radius unless you catch him off guard. 
---
I bet you can't two shot this blitz's hand on a pixel angle.
---
Kaid: "Hold my beer..."
---
Good luck against a skilled monty then
---
Exactly. You can delay SO much as a roamed, but the attackers can literally make their way through each and every room on the map before focusing obj like you said. Then at best, it’s a 2v3 but more likely a 2v4 situation, unless they’re bad attackers or are just screwing around. 
---
Young squeakers??
---
Crabs are people - legit or quit
---
Dude I started in white noise and I have no idea what you are trying to do with his
---
that’s milosh. his twitter is @miloshthemedic and bro u don’t need to be so rude
---
One extra jump after destroyed and random ones prior to that.
---
To confuse everyone who started playing during/after parabellum.
---
Even if you load thru steam all your info is stored thru ubisoft. 
---
So to answer your question. You're fine. Ubi has your stats/progressions in the cloud or something. 
---
Yes but what does it mean
---
It was back in year 1 with ash, on Kanal. The game was 4-4 and my entire team pretty much got wiped with 1 guy dying to the old Insta spawn kill from control room window. I just said fuck it and ran up the stairs. I gunned down Jäger as he climbed back inside from a run out and turned on Rook. I then ran into control and domed smoke. I placed a drone on my flank and smoked the objective and abused the name tags coming up if you looked at people through smoke lmao. Won the game 5-4. 
---
Dokk is also in the fill. 
---
Fully Cancer Meta: Lion, Finka, Dokk, Fill (3 speed, Jackal, Zofia, Bitz, certain others depending on situation), Alt. Fill (Fill, Thermite (if hard walls), or Thatcher (because trap meta)).
---
New UI went into effect during parabellum. People who started playing after that never saw this one
---
Ah right
