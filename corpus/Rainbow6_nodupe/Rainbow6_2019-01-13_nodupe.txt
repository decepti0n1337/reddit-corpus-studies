U better have black ice

&gt; there everyone has the same graphics quality and this is nothing special.
---
That's not even true. One X runs at 1728p and PS4Pro is 1440p. The base models run considerably lower res than that.
---
you´ll get faster eventualy , practise makes perfect. :)
---
Yes much. I have the twitch prime one that gives her purple hair. 
---
I want that gamemode back. So Jager can die more.
---
Watch the fuck out!!! LOL
---
glad to help
---
I wish, using the french flag skin until i do
---
Then they vote kick you
---
Well if I was in that situation I would slam the fuck out of the guy, steal everyone of his kills and run in front of his shot to get him banned.
---
Tsk tsk 
---
Hey could be worse, you could be qued up back to back with a brazilian pro player and do bad both games for being nervous of having a person that high skilled playing with me. Second game he ends up telling me in to stop playing siege cuz i am shit lol 4 days clean of siege
---
Really one of the last good season skins. The new ones have just been bland and colorless. I wish they could put in the effort they use to or let the community create skins.
---
I'd be pissed lol

Feels bad man, I’m the shittiest in my group of friends and when I’m the last operator I’m sweating buckets 
---
No, *clearly* it just got stunned by a Grzmot mine.
---
Using this
---
If you know about a glitch, and you take advantage of that glitch to win, YOU ARE A CHEATER.
---
Although that doesn't necessarily mean u played well it's pretty likely u did. I know how u feel. 
---
I didn't call him Chinese or japanese!!!! I said Asian!!!! Which is ethnicity!!!! Just like Hispanics, White, and Black people!!! So looks like you're the dumb one on here 😂🤣
---
Ngl, killing Zofia as Ela is the most satisfying thing I can do on defense
---
Can you shout through the “windows”
---
Great game. &lt;3
---
what skin is that on the mk11 (think thats frost’s pistol?)

😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤

Yes it is, a classic!

I truly can’t stand playing on this map and it feels like it’s in rotation more than the other maps.

So its not all console is trash, just this season of ranked

Yup, try 2500 tho... It often disconnects me from games.

Yea I should’ve been more clear. I’ve ran into many toxic players in the past, but this season it’s like everyone has become toxic and I’m literally pulling my hair out in frustration with the community
---
I’m gonna tell my mom you bullied me she’s the president of the United States she’s gonna have you killed 😤😤😤
---
Yeah , pretty expensive on the used market. In Germany as an example they are usually sold for around 100-200€ on eBay. But when you have luck you can find in smaller shops the Tachanka for the original price of 20€
---
Thanks, I think haha. I'll concede that I probably lost us the last round because I blew up a wall that my teammates didn't know how to play.
---
Same, I'm guessing because I prefer the desktop version of the site while on mobile.

HOW DO YOU KEEP DOING THIS
---
I find myself in more and more games with m&amp;k users on both the enemy team and my team too
---
I've only gotten black ice 3 times, and two of those times was for thermite
---
I have been playing this game since release and I am level 212, I have never felt like run-outs were unfair and allowed you to win rounds to you shouldn't. To be fair that's kind of what ranked is right now, everyone is very aggressive and plays for fun. I disagree that plain dumb playstyles are rewarded in this game, what really differentiate lower ranked players from higher ranked is communication and coordination. Why don't you send me a clip of all those "un-counterrable" run outs?
---
Why don't you play r6tms or go4?
---
well he’s my dad! and he’s gonna have you killed again 😤😤😤😤
---
there is a 1x version and a 2.5x version
---
Those two spots yes but if it’s bomb (all Ubi cares about for pro league) then it is much more balanced. But most locations in each mode him with only two with that kind of thing could be fine. I’m not sure about the rolling up part though. Don’t think that is needed.  
---
Oh don’t even get me started on that crap. Ubisoft has even come out and said to report people using m&amp;k on console because in their opinion it’s cheating. 
---
&gt; just because of the green hair
---
It's the leggings and the thicc memes.  That's why we see her absolutely everywhere on this sub.
---
Always reccomend hopping onto the tts if you have it. Just play thunts or a few matches with all the ops. Maybe 3 or 5 times each and you'll find the ones you like most. I prefer lesion, zofia, capitao, cav and frost, though I use base ops more. 
---
But he is my uncle! So you're my cousin! So I'll deal with you myself! I'll mount a cluster charge on your butthole!!! 😂🤣
---
“Report people who do it” 
---
*reports*
---
*nothing ever happens*
---
So the no memes rule is just ignored?
---
yes, but they don't really listen to pro league. Basing it of them and listening to them is two very different things. Also what is wrong with balancing the game around the highest level of play?
---
well I’m into that! 😤😤😤
---
yikes, secure area in a nutshell
---
yea same that was why i was wondering why they do it
---
KDA much? 
---
They would be in spectator mode in a custom game would be my guess 
---
 So, I ran into this guy in Ranked a few times and he has done something to his game to cause it to never load until he decides to let it load. So we are stuck in the lobby forever. We tried to wait it out and each lobby after a round took 14 mins each time. Dude tells us he's trolling and won't leave the match so everyone how stays suffers. I've ran into him 3x times this week and had to abandon the match. The guy won't leave and if you abandon you'll be locked out of rank for about an hour or so because the current match is still going on as he's holding the lobby open. 
---
Knowing about a glitch and exploiting to win makes you a cheater. So yes, there was cheating. I bet the Hibana told the Glaz that they were going to jump the shield and glitch the Echo. The Glaz got ready for it, and executed.
---
i guess
---
Especially in a game like rainbow
---
Welcome to Rainbow Six: Siege. 
---
What is this “crouch spam” you speak of?
---
Pretty much.  There's memes everywhere.  Occasionally the mods will delete memes, but rarely.  It's either that or some incredibly suggestive picture of her or another female operator.  I'm all for some memes, but when it's just the same thing over and over again, it gets boring.
---
Then I got 3 of them (cluster charges)! Enjoy! 😂😂😂
---
None in stock where I picked up this scope. They only had 4x and didnt want to wait for an online order
---
Where do buy mnk for console from? 
---
3 times the fun! 
---
You have a good point bandit is more useful alibi is just memes
---
oh ok
---
There's literally no way you can prove that that happened. Ubisoft isn't going to ban anyone here.
---
What have they not given you for your season pass.
---
Also I don't understand how these two things are linked? You are making the game worse for yourself because you didn't get your skins? What are you achieving?
---
You forgot the part about taking responsibility, you think anone in plat or diamond thinks they got therr because “trash” teammates? 
---
they usally do it to it to test to so if the cheats work, because once i was warming up for some comp and a cheater was on the other team, thankfully the opposition killed him  nearlly every round after they found out he was cheating.
---
i then started up a comp game and guess who was on my team, the cheater.
---
Just because you are a cheater doesn't mean you're getting banned. Ubisoft never banned glitchers, period.
---
Second, there's no way you can prove these people were actually abusing a glitch.
---
Ranked is kinda better for that stuff but its 4eally luck of the draw
---
Those god damn hockey pucks
---
You also missed over 30 of the shots you did take.
---
I loved the custom camo choices, choice of weapons. Love Seige, but I miss those choices
---
Yeah I’d definitely pay for this as some sort of a bundle. I wouldn’t put it past the devs to add something like this either.
---
Same here
---
Preach your glorifying word
---
Attacking Tachanka uwu 
---
They already have rappel animation plus heli as well so it would not be hard.
---
For you yeah, but most people I know can easily aim at his shoulders or legs. Your lack of aim is not a reason to nerf a character.
---
Yeah I've had this bug, I made sure to check my headphones in case I was being retarded but they were the right way round. A restart fixed it.
---
There wasn't one
---
LoL. Man people love to complain about free updates to a 3 year old game. It's a decent map. The windows aren't functional. You can't open or even shoot through them so they're just cosmetic. Who gives a fuck? 
---
I tried to make the crosshairs straightened up as best as I could but sadly, there isn’t a tool for that, or if there is, I haven’t found it yet

---
‘Injured the hostage’ is an understatement when fuze is on attacking...
---
I agree with it being boring to play her and not being very excited to get in the match with her. Her guns are a little wack with an eternity to bring the lmg into ads and the AR feeling too slow of a fire rate. I like that she is a 2 speed 2 armor tho. I also think her ability is great as it is. Giving her some team rush ability is very useful and if your lucky enough to pick up a teammate from afar that’s even better. I do wish the sound was only an initial thing tho. You can leave the blue outline but let me frickin hear a little plz (:
---
this is so cool
---
Suppressive fire you say 
---
For attacking do either nomad or thermite, nomad is good for taking out roamers and thermite for letting your team into an objective. For defense I'd say something like cav or kaid. Cav for getting info for your team and kaid for shocking walls and stuff
---
Sorry for the loud mic, Nvidia likes to boost it every now and then
---
Well then I guess you miss 97% of the shots you do take.
---

Fortress is more like a magic palace than a fortress
---
Thanks for the tip, but it isn't the aim its the aim down time, I can flick to the head but i have to wait for it to completely aim in or I have a like 30% chance of actually hitting the head, I think I can get used to it though.
---
They dont deserve it.

I liked outbreak but I got bored really quickly, I played like 10 games and stopped, so it would’ve been a waste of space on the game, taking space that could be used for updates, balance, operators, maps.

That’s not to say the modes bad, just isn’t worth keeping over content for the games main mode PVP
---
this has to be edited, right?

I don't think they're op, I think they're just broken af. I hope ubi does some kind of rework for all shields this year because a lot of people hate them and they're just not fun to play against.

No it actually shows the highest rank you achieved during that season. I got plat in chimaera then lost it pretty shortly after and never got back, but it still shows me as plat.

I hate that people are so toxic to lower level people in this game, I made an alt account and was voted out of 3 games in a row and team killed in 4 for simply having a low level. Console is also more toxic in general from what I’ve seen, you have the low percent of good teammates that actually give callouts and then you have the 3-4 stacks that just TK and vote out anybody who joins

Well, in high rank elo you don’t stand a chance not crouch spamming. But in this clip, I only crouch when not shooting.
---
Calm down, cobba
---
when you buy the season passes before a date you are supposed to get 
---
1. a weapon skin
---
2. a charm
---
3. some r6 credits
---
4. 8 op
---
5. 8 outfits/head gear
---
I only ever get 4 &amp; 5 and Ubisoft support always just says "it takes time give it a little" but here we are 2 years later and still no credits or skins
---
also did we play the same game? casual is so much more relaxed and fun than ranked. for once I actually am having a lot of fun since I can just play however without 4 people screaming in my ear at all times.
---
Screw 2kliksphilip. He's just a poser trying to be 4kliksphilip.
---
I changed it twice, I hope that’s enough. Haven’t played in 6 months so it’s very odd that it would happen now.
---
Agreed blitz is too fast for thiccbois on defense and he take zero skill just like Lion and finka 
---
What the odds are.*
---
I could get in the “first login screen without 2fa but the acc management needed the code
---
If you can't play versus Lion, I really recommend people to uninstall their game. 
---
"unspoken rule"
---
l m a o 
---
I've had some fair success in casual with reviving people as Finka. Its really great against Cav.
---
People do it to spawnrush, so always be prepared. It is definitely less in ranked though. More like a "fun" strat. 
---
I guess you are playing casual, where higher ranks just want to kill low people to get a good feeling...
---
#whoa
---
Reporting for toxicity only means chat, simply teamkilling wont get anyone banned
---
peeking*
---
It’s not “aim dueling”, it’s called flanking. Yes, it’s annoying as hell, but there are multiple ways you can control it. 
---
That is not funny, you just made a random joke about jojo, that is even doesn't makes sense. Look he said "that's how works" HAHA XDXDXXD FUNNY KING CRIMSON, guys like you killed jojo fandom
---
Mute talks???
---
They already stated that it's not coming back, but I mean, Ubisoft said it so that might be a lie
---
It's called spawn peek and it's a normal part of the game, you can counter it by keeping a drone which side you are spawning or just check for broken barricades
---
I said in a different post that I got used to crouch spamming because you literally stand no chance in high elo gameplay. 
---
But whatever floats your boat mate 
---
Reeeeeee
---
**MP4 Link:** https://lew.la/reddit/clips/afi96p.mp4 
---
No other way in high elo my dude. I am too, annoyed by it but what are you gonna do if everyone is doing it ?
---
Check if you have 2 accounts maybe you linked it to the wrong account
---
You're correct that I play casual, atleast for now. I was expecting it to be more popular in ranked after experiencing how effective it was in casual, although my one ranked game made it clear to me how much to skill difference there actually is (alot, that is).
---
Oh wow, that's actually very sloppy.
---
No, i Just have one and bought on one steam account. 
---
Why with no operators?
---
Did you check on your steam inventory or in-game?
---
I'm not sure but checking broken barricades can't be possible on every map right? On themepark when spawning at the entrance it's not visible right? Or am I just blind?
---
How would I use the drone effectively? 
---
Yes its a legit strategy, you get the other team really salty then you respond with “ez pz”  it tilts them. 
---
I envy your claim.
---
True. Maybe they drop a mid season reinforcement even though, they stopped that but think about it would you rather have loads of operators or more fixes to ensure that those operators can survive 
---
I say fix the issue before the work loads gets too great for it to be done 
---
It really does hurt.
---
Noclip: ON
---
Monty and IQ are like £25+ online with Game.
---
we need Health Operation 2
---
I check in game, Am Just joined and check charm, but i Dont have lava charm so i check steam DLC and i have Year 4 pass. Did this mean i need to write Down support? 
---
***CSGO flashbacks intensify***
---
If I were to put an answer on it it would be that in MP there is an added pressure and completely different mindset to playing a terrorist hunt. 
---
plus it might feel better in T Hunt because they take a while to shoot back making you feel better 
---
This could go in a satisfying video commpilation KreyGasm
---
Wth he is not an artist, its a bug
---
Fixed by changing shadow settings to anything 
---
Glitch 
---
Well that's what I thought at first, but if I shoot at a wall in T hunt my recoil control is really good, but if I shoot at a wall in MP (no pressure as I'd still be in spawn and it's not moving because, well, it's a wall)
---
When you watch it you can see has you shot the reticle wasn’t blue so you didn’t hit his hitbox. 
---
Spoopy
---
Oh, didnt you know? People are allowed nowadays to hunt lions in the wild. 
---
Laziness .....
---
I wish I played from the beginning 
---
I've found they mostly leave when downed or about to be interrogated, they don't get the death, and can return for the next round, ******** in my eyes. 
---
You should be able to stream it really good actually.
---
Then it turned blue? If not there's something seriously wrong with the hitboxes
---
Check if you are having the 100% CPU usage bug.
---
I personally dont know for sure if there is or not, but it doesn't make sense to me why Ubi would make recoil different for game modes, especially since terrorist hunt is meant for practice
---
Diver titties
---
Flair checks out
---
Yes, when white noise launched if I remember correctly.
---
Fuze is uzbek too so it’s perfect
---
You heard it here folks, who gives a fuck about anything that’s cosmetic, why bother even making a graphical engine at all /s
---
I guess I'm just broken or something. That's unfortunate.
---
Not every game has this 
---
Lol get yawted.
---
if you are having the 100% cpu usage bug go to documents - games - rainbow six siege - gamesettings.ini and change the fps limit.
---
Red-green colorblindness really dicked me back then. 
---
It's my favourite thing to do but I think that's probably just because my aim isn't very good
---
Hitboxes are perfect now, so uniforms aren’t part of the hitbox. You shot between his arm and chest... how you managed to do that is relatively impressive.
---
Are you actually suggesting nothing is wrong with this... as though it’s intended...
---
Hereford is good there’s a lot of good room holds compared to chalet and crappy skyscraper. Rework tower and bring that back 
---
I just tested. 
---
It’s the same.
---
she only has one good headgear imo, and that’s the burka looking thing 
---
That let sunlight in from the nonexistent other side of the window?
---
Good on you 
---
Thats some top quality bronze awareness
---
There was atleast 1 headshot.
---
Muzzle break all day 
---
For me Bandit was more of a spawn peeking problem with his acog. Especially when  they burst fired and got you by lucky recoil 
---
^(swipe ^gang)
---
Did this to my friend yesterday we were just laughting so hard lol
---
Not available for separate purchase anymore. But you can get it with Gold Edition. 
---
Nobody used it :(
---
Jackson and lion in copper xd
---
Do we really want to plummet the game into a shithole state again?
---
Lol just kill him back
---
Damn, which website did you buy them off? I was just thinking of buying some credits but will avoid it if it’s the same site 
---
Read OP
---
Blitz is NOT op or easy to use he is just hard to counter
---
I think your post got removed, meaning where the text was there is now no text, I can only read your title 
---
Your biggest gripe with the game is something easily countered? I’ve killed more spawnpeekers than I have been killed by them...and I usually only ever die in casual.
---
yeah man wtf
---
This season feels a worse than last season in a number of (buggy) ways, but Siege is a game that’s a combination of luck &amp; skill, so I think you should just play more, or watch some clips on YouTube of what you could do to help you improve your game
---
Siege is my first shooter. Now it’s kinda the only game I play, mostly solo queue on Xbox 
---
Thats a tad weird, it's MMOTANK.
---
I don't like fortress
---
Or wait a few weeks and just buy the Y3 Operator bundle when it’s released.
---
My pp hard
---
I have problems with it being a thing yea, the ammount of times ive spawned taken one step and been one taped beforebi can even ads to check for spawn peeks is quite high, then i also highly dislike pixle/shoulderpeaking because its just not fun to deal with
---
Yes, put it into ranked and pro league too 
---
Damn that’s the site I was just going to use too! :( the site I used to use “Aoeah” have now stopped selling r6 credits, they were really good and reliable. Make sure you change your password and activate 2FA if you haven’t already dude.
---
Did MMOTANK reply to you?
---
Nah you can survive 1hit from the clash shield with 5hp lmao
---
Same here, playing right now and 4 people of 5 in the other team are not yet ranked and in the previous season were Plat, the remaining one is a level 20 smurf. My team is made of silver/bronze. This is pure shit.
---
Some only deal 3.
---
I feel you. And the worst is that there's nothing to do against it.
---
It works same way as hitreg
---
This happened to me too 
---
Spit on me.
---
The whole map is covered with these mistakes
---
I’m sort of annoyed. I have the season pass but I’d still like to know what I’m getting. I hope they release it soon.
---
Can someone explain why people do this?
---
I hope the pic is reversed 
---
February
---
It was even better with sound, you could really feel the sadness when the guy let out a sigh. 
---
Yeah you're not gonna survive a clash with 5hp unless both of you meet at a corner.
---
It's seems like previous season are not taking into account. How the hell you think placing someone that was plat against bronze is good for the game? I'm wondering the thought process "maybe he lost the hands". Fucking Ubisoft. 
---
I got thatchers trench headgear without even knowing it in my first days on siege
---
This is bomb! Is the @ your Instagram? So I can give us a follow!!!

Now what this needs is a shock drone skin for the phone.

I played in same team with im literally few(?) hours ago this morning🤔
---
Didn't TK anyone tho, but we didn't pick lion 👀
---
Ez stolen clip for those internet points

Lemme tackle

It was actually 500 for the first Operator you unlock and everytime it got more expensive with 2000 being the last unlock.

---
Yes, for example in Rocket League unless there was a hard reset at the end of the season(which is very very rare), all your previous ranks will be taken into consideration in the new season'a ranking.
---
Ash is too fast for the human eye, you know
---
He had a better gaming chair
---
They don't tell you what happens, if anything, which to me is their nice way of telling you , "thanks for reporting this player, we will escalate this to the shredder ASAP. Fuck off and have a nice day"
---
Maybe if they actually said something happened people aid be more motivated to report. I reported one player got that stupid message and have to say I'd never waste my time with it again.
---
I think that's a cow.
---
True. As soon as we’re newborns we should get to work right away and keep working till we die. There should be no fun whatsoever 
---
What?
---
You want to know why people run out? 
---
Fok me has it been that long? :D i am getting old in this game 
---
🤔
---
Why can’t battle eye pick this up?
---
Is this why it never registers headshots when i have high ping?
---
Fok me has it been that long? I am getting old in this game:D
---
To that specific spot, I know you can’t get up there any other way as a defender but I don’t know why there’s any advantage to actually being there since it will be fairly obvious you’re in there or have been there to place traps etc
---
To take control of the tower which is super easy to run out from and defend. Usually it covers 1-2 sites but most people just ignore the defenders in there. 
---
This way of operating is also damaging ubi, I’m willing to buy the year pass but why should I buy it if i cannot improve because of this shit ranked. And I firmly think that other people share my view. 
---
super 90... oh wait, all of the shotguns were op
---
For me the easiest way to complete that challenge is to play shields and just melee people
---
Any information on this? cant see anything on google. 
---
Only OG’s remember the 5 hp black and white Instagram filter that gave you crazy anxiety in a 1v5.

I don't know who Monica is, but I've just stuck with droning out my next area I'm running to. Have the time you don't even need IQ to see it unless the Lesion is really good and throws them strategically 
---
I'm not very experienced in video editing. I know there are cuts that and be done better. But I did my best and I really love siege. Thanks to Ubisoft for bring such a good game ( ´•̥̥̥ω•̥̥̥` )
---
Have you tried turning off your rapid fire on your modded controller?
---
Really cool! Personally, I'd dirty it up a bit though. Make it look used, y'know?
---
Thank You for helping me
---
I will set it accordingly to your recommendations.

...for the next &lt;5 seconds

Rouge 9 said that night was the best because it magnifies the main sounds you would want to hear but Ubi disabled it for raked I think

Anti vaxxer

I Finka you looka great
---
Hit or Miss?
---
Yes, in proleague. But what is with normal casual etc? He's not OP at all and many player don't play high plat/ diamond
---
In proleague. But not in casual..
---
Why are you upset?
---
Yeah i was being sarcastic, hence the /s
---
"Well it's her fault for not muting everyone."  Really guys?  Blaming the victim is the best you can come up with?
---
So elo is rank, rank is elo. Thanks friend!
---
Not trying to be rude but she is so cute! I love cosplays
---
Because it’s an useless shotgun 
---
Woah this is old. 
---
Nah, because that's actual gameplay. This isn't, I don't have that much if a problem with off topic content, I just personally find these comics stupid. 
---
That momentary lion scan can be paired with knowledge of the defenders’ positions through droning, and forcing them to stay put. You can easily pre-fire their position or even get into a position to hold an angle on them. Also, roam clearing is 1000 times easier. Imagine having Jackal pushing with you, one of you drones out a cav running down a hall, and you scan with lion knowing she’s trying to get somewhere. Jackal sees where she’s sitting and calls it out, and just as the scan ends, you prefire the angle she was temporarily holding and she’s done. Easy roam clear and the rest of your team could’ve pushed into a site-adjacent room while you scanned since it’s visible for all teammates.
---
Yes exactly
---
yeah i heard someone coming over so i paniced XD
---
It's Tachanka's shotgun
---
Ah yeah, the good old ranks too! I remember getting plat 3 and being so happy. Now Plat 3 is Plat 1 and I'm still not used to it. 
---
XD
---
Yeah... color is what it needs... and only color...
---
Are you serious right now?

Oh my god this is beautiful. We need more!

“Believed to be”. He’s in a damn competitive quarantine man. 
---
Ubisoft caring what we disliked? Good one.

My run this morning was also a proof of concept then. Took quite an effort to complete it. Made me feel good, I'll probably do something similar in the future. But right now I'll throw it out the window by eating 3 chocolate cakes #UbiLogic.

[funniest R6 fails](https://youtu.be/RqIMrtXLXfM) 
---
The few times I have successfully withstood and won a round because of it have been so satisfying 
---
It's a cosmetic
---
So long as the attackers spawn in cover and have multiple ways to leave the spawn, spawn peeking and rushing is just something you have to be prepared for as an attacker. I would argue that the spawns should be set up such that a defender has to be outside for long enough to be detected for a second or two before being able to line up a shot, but I don't think the game is unplayable with spawns how they exist today.
---

---
No, for sake of the realistic side of this game, they should remain.
---
BUT, client-sided things have to be taken away from R6s
---
Pretty sure we did get refunds for the attachments. Didn't really mind about the operators though it's nbd. 
---
Same happened to me when I picked lesion because I just got him. It really ruins the fun.
---
True
---
well, i am not facing them always , but i think getting qued against 5man squads in 8 out of 10 games is still pretty interesting, also whole team of 3 dudes reaching plat and queingi 2 guys with us gold 4-ish matchmaking against 5man plat squads 
---
What about getting unlucky and going on a losing streak?
---
Not the best counter but can still do something to Clash.

---
Tell them Siege is a better CS, there's proper cheat detection. And it isn't a dying game filled with angry Russians. 
---
Is buy this one and the ela one ffs ubi please
---
I completely agree that he needs to be reworked, but until that happens you just need to deal with him being in the game. TK’ing and throwing a hissy fit only makes you look like a massive douche
---
Have you tried winning? :'D
---
.20% more and we have a winner.

Machine pistols and Mira’s secondary shotgun do not carry the movement speed boost, it’s only the standard pistols (Alibi and Maestro’s secondary shotgun is considered a pistol as far as I know, so I believe it gives the speed boost too but can’t confirm)
---
pouchface
---
Real talk Kapkan's operator card looks vicious, like he just came from his operator video 😂
---
Don’t expect to play casual without meeting some toxic ppl. Just play ranked dude 
---
Never seen anyone play Vigil.
---
Hahahaha!!
---
Since mine never appears to show... I wouldn't even know how to get multiple Flairs, possibly a mod thing. 
---
Even in high golds it seems like every other game I get a crouch spam macro kid or someone that just "knows" when to shoot through 2 walls and a doorway into my head. 
---
I’m not saying dokkabei’s ability isn’t good, I’m just saying that when paired with high level players, and her wack weapon choices, lion is superior.

Would inseminate you and make babies.

Thanks for this answer! was what i was looking for.

Very nice. I play Twitch sometimes but I don't have that outfit. I still think it looks better than a ski mask and black armor. 
---
If I had any qualms with the outfit (not the cosplay), it's that it shows Twitches entire face, and thus adds another challenge for cosplayers. 
---
Excellent job though, it looks very high quality.

I had three matches in a row where people were doing this IN CASUAL. Only the dead can know peace from this evil.

its not about askin for an op... it was about askin and agreeing not to play an op!  
---
Anyways I agree with you on what u said :D
---
8 lives, 2 guns and is coming for ya
---
Can you do jackal? I feel like his gadget perfectly fits your style
---
He did it cause they agreed not to use lion with the opposite team... and they asked him not to play it multiple times!
---
I agree, a lot of the DLC ops are better, all I'm saying is that the OG operators are great and you can't really go wrong with the standard editing R6.
---
Also I really appreciate your civility, rather than the standard "fuck you blah blah blah"
---
And bank
---
They were supposed to release it when op. Health came out instead, and they decided to not complicqte that process with yet another map to fix and maintain. Since then new maps have come out, but no Poland.
---
You choose lion, you had it coming
---
Can't believe how mqny autist are on this sub seeking attention and posting about the same fucking shit.

somehow connect a keyboard and mouse and go from there
---
In terms of content it’s not bad; but in terms of gameplay I’d say it’s one of the worst seasons. There is no enjoyment in playing ranked anymore. It’s full of cancer meta assholes; cheaters and boosters. Literally nobody plays strategically; it’s all rush around and peek everyone. Everybody plays for kills even when it’s not smart. 
---
"OKEH"

How long does it take to save THAT much renown for diamond?

r/therewasanattempt

Your moms gonna think its a dildo
---
in the vid he clearly said  “We had a gentleman’s agreement” ... from that I thought they did tell u not to play the operator especially since Lion in itself is game breaking and is toxic just because it exists
---
Nice
---
I can’t carry on.... finish the fight without me! 
---
apparently
---
I was platinum 3 in white noise and worked all the way to platinum 2 until this season. Focusing more on callouts and designated roles in my small stack 
---
No one I saw playing Clash was able to pull that off. And if you’re going to nerf that, you need to buff something else. She’s the least picked operator for a reason
---
I said that using lion is toxic... not getting tked... and tkin is toxic I wouldnt do it... but using lion is toxic too
---
especially if u get asked not to
---
If they are try Harding, then idk. But some people down there are pretty bad, like really bad and some people find it fun to mess around with em. 
---
You gave me a 3 second notice not to use Lion. Or penalty of TK, you can see my mouse wasn't even on the screen.
---
I played the next defensive round out just fine and we won.
---
Then Bagel went Cav and downed me the next round.
---
You 'apologized' for him telling me he was right doing what he did but not to TK him in response. That's not an apology. 
---
After that you two continously harassed me until the end of the match.
---
The only person I downed that whole match was Bagel on the second to last round after he had downed me for the 3rd time as Cav.
---
I’m pretty sure in that tutorial you have to go through it abit, then it lets you use Glaz’s sigh, press r1 to use any ops gadget

Go play ranked. Other than that you are just unlucky
---
I don't think I've seen Valk's in action, what would make her elite skin bannable?
---
Has happened to me before. All I needed to do was go back to operator choice and spam click on the OP I wanted, fixed it after that
---
Couldn’t agree more 
---
Casual diamond flex haha
---
Thats pretty cool. And he's definitely right about making the money back and then some. 
---
Did you use leather or Nylon for the pouches.
---
I think all that's missing is a drone, I'd imagine there's plenty of papercrafts on something like Etsy.
---
Gotta love casual. 4 man spawn peek. An idiot fragging himself. TK. Vote to kick. Ahhhhh the memories. 
---
Its like g36c and the r4c, the mp5 is superior wether you like it or not, its probably not gonna change
---
&gt; Any good reason why this has been downvoted?
---
There are a lot of Ubisofts' ass-kissers here who will simply do the Stalin-esque "there is no trouble in paradise [Soviet Russia]", except for them here it's "there are no problems in Siege". 
---
These idiots are in the thousands and are very vocal. Everytime someone talks about a legit problem with the game, these idiots will show up and insult you just to make it look like this game never has any issues. 
---
At this point, I'm not at all going to be surprised if they were paid or were affiliated with Ubisoft in any other way.
---
Just post what you have to post and don't bother arguing with guys who can't stand back and self-examine their own comment and figure out that they have a lot of double standards [that vocal bit].
---
MAAAA. THERE'S A WEIRD FUCKING CAT.
---
Arrrrrhh, what video is that from?? Do you know??
---
I'm solo queuing while my mates aren't on. Prefer to play ranked with a party. Solo in casual seems to be causing this. I've had another 4-5 ongoings since this post. Its mad.

I love the headcrusher headgear!
---
Ok.....he could just not use Lion?
---
 Worst part is his team is already down a player and it’s OT match point for the opponents lol
---
No
---
That crouch span tho
---
You know, someone is going to rightfully complain that they can’t see the top right of the screen, or you didn’t show your ping immediately after the kill.
---
Devs get your Stuff together
---
That’s exactly what he’s suggesting. I think you’ve misread the title lol. 
---
Woah that's actually really good. 
---
Can I have u pussy pls it vry juicy
---
Nice pic! 
---
I remember creating so many recruit only lobbies using this feature. I miss those times.
---
I absolutely love the colout and textures on the Kaid's fur, especially the different strengths of lines giving depth.
---
Well done.
---
✌️
---
Constantly pressing q and e? Really fast?
---
#ANARCHY
---
That's way to many points for breaching. Maybe a 5-10 point bonus after someone gets kills/downs when going through something you breached. That might be nice. Encourages more teamwork and thoughtful plays that will achieve a win than "No I got to get that breach for extra points". However that is more difficult to make.
---
Definetly, it's been weird.
---
I good it was meant as a funny thing
---
The screenshot you posted says you are lying.
---
how so
---
What ????
---
Honestly imo I would say run echo, maestro, valk, and 2 other ops with bullet proof camera. This game is all about intel and having the max amount of cameras on defense will help with getting the intel you need to win.
---
man i love LMGs
---
Problem was, when looking at a players rank they were so small you could not tell the difference between them whatsoever. Today’s are bland but very distinct, back then it was nearly impossible. 
---
He's doing gods work. 
---
i am in recruit because i done a lot of recruit rushes
---
&gt;it ain't really that
---
How did they deserve it? There was no proof of illegal weapons and they didn't even hurt any civilians in "terrorist attacks" like Kanye said. The Feds shot innocent civilians who were fleeing the burning building.
---
Huh interesting point of view
---
They should use your face for the elite...Will make her look more attractive lol 
---
U want an other screenshot ??! This discussion started 55mins ago and finished 53mins ago...
---
I still remember those times when a weekly challenge said to do 10 of something using GSG9 and I'm like who the F are GSG9?
---
After finding Our Lord yesterday I’ve been in detective mode. Apparently this is a new 3 inch Chibi line that are made by a company called Xtreme Play. There was a press release last summer but I wasn’t able to find any other official press. These do not include codes for in game charms and appear to be copies of the original 4 inch line. 
---
I think im on EUW or whatever it was
---
Maybe try teaming up with people on this sub.  If we give up then anyone toxic will win and the good part of the fan base will disappear. Good people like you are why the game still exists in many ways. Don’t give up just yet!
---
Where can you read "stop" ????! WHERE ? 
---
Sadly I don't think they care
---
Btw make sure to not use echos or maestros stuff, because if you do they have a higher chance of getting destroyed removing your most important sources of intel.
---
Oh, ok. I'm on east coast US and the only braindead ones are bronze and coppers
---
The old version of the MC😢😭
---
It’s okay I’m American, I have to go first. 
---
honestly it really isn’t that bad on xbox. it happens for sure but just stay out of gamechat. if teamkilling happens just throw up  vote to kick and usually they will get kicked. and if someone’s votes to kick for no reason towards you, there should be at least 1 person that votes against it and you won’t get kicked. it’s definitely more not toxic than toxic. get back into it man 
---
Yea, i love the game it's just broken
---
&gt;Burning and shooting 82 civilians alive because they **maybe** had "illegal" firearms epic ATF style.
---
Basically, spend somewhere between 250-400 for a GPU or it's not worth switching
---
No, the game is platform sensitive. All games on uplay are.
---
Pretty sure you can't have pc and console siege, or maybe that's just a steam thing
---
I remember and miss that feature.
---
How on earth 4 players in the SAME FREAKING ROOM don't realise that! 
---
Even it wasn’t why wouldn’t you at least try?
---
PC is toxic heaven.
---
Honestly I think that the posters of the toxicity complaints due something to instigate it. I rarely have toxic problems on pc. Of course there is the occasional team kill and what not but it’s no where near as often as the people say or make it seem.
---
Usually gold doesnt have as bad players expect today
---
You can play Vigil and anyone who cares that you're a girl is a stupid asshole. 
---
Nice work! Took me a second to realize that the entire image was an illustration.
---
Well, Americans are all try hards
---
I get that people are assholes, but a substantial amount of the friendly fire in this game is unintentional. Yes, please, put my team down two people because Cletus ran in front of me at the exact moment I shot out the static cam, just as a quick example.
---
Not to mention the boon it would be to trolls. Wanna impact that wall? Better hope you've got a doc to heal you back up, blowing it out with shotguns? Get real. Smoke's a pretty strong operator, it would be a shame if a teammate sat in your gas and killed you with it. Standing on breaching charges of any flavour, rushing into fuzed rooms.
---
Aside from the accidental friendly fire issue, which I'm sure tons of people are going to tell me isn't really a problem, this would open so many avenues for abuse that would leave trolls effectively untouchable. The only thing you can do is vote kick and hope it goes through.
---
You forget to mention that the men being questioned opened fired when they tried to search the place and killed 4 federal agents 
---
ffs
---
That was awesome.
---
Nope , Kapkan and ash were in one team once...you will get it XD
---
The guy below already described it in full detail. 
---
Nobody gives a damn about you pro league wannabes. Lion is in the game and he's Fairplay to use. Screw your gentleman's agreement. A tk is a tk and world's way more toxic than someone choosing lion. G
---
Never said that in general grammar doesn't matter but in a Reddit thread really and then the fact you're trying to make me look stupid because of it is pathetic 
---
Now if you have something to contribute to the argument that is fine but being a grammar nazi on something as insignificant as a Reddit thread is sad
---
Have a great day :)
---
I think it should be the other way around. The more team damage you do, the more renown you lose. The other way allows for people to get away with team killing and what not while still getting full renown.
---
No pay walls in the game, enjoy
---
Give my boy bandit his elite. 
---
Wow The best

Using a game’s in-game mechanic to its upmost potential to gain a competitive edge inside a competitive environment. Gee, I wonder where people could have the GALL to think of using such out overreaching methods! It shouldn’t be unexpected that players will find ways to push advantages in a game like Siege. People like you who want the game to be watered down truly are the greatest of minds. 
---
Maybe I’ll just play siege and type out in all chat where I’m breaching in from next time, wouldn’t want my good old friends on defense to be surprised!
---
Of course it is scam. Never give away your account information.
---
Wrong sub.

Thanks for the advice i am already searching for upgrades for my cpu and currently waiting for benchmarks of 3rd gen ryzen. Yet what ever i do it will cost me over 350 really, because you have to think about mobo and ram too.
---
The thing that bothers me the most is that the game is 3-4 years old and yet... Anyway...

I don’t think mute has the SMG-11... I think his sidearms only consisted of the pistol 
---
No, Mute didn't have the SMG-11 when the Elite released
---
UCK
---
Better then doing nothing 
---
Sorry brother they gave it all to me. Almost every purple pack has been a unique black ice. Im only missing 3 primary, thermite, glaz and smoke AND a buttload of pistols. Got everything else.
---
Ela didn't take armor tho
---
12 months late 
---
It wasn’t there for long. Wouldn’t mind having it back though.
---
**MP4 Link:** https://lew.la/reddit/clips/afnqu9.mp4 
---
Yes, *if* you do runouts. If not, you get fucked. Its the same for Skyscraper. Runouts are a core part of the defense meta for some maps, and probably quite intentionally so. 
---
Or accidentally nitro celling yourself when you think you're putting down barbed wires
---
I kinda miss afk recruit..
---
You have a boyfriend?
---
From one flawed system to the other!
---
People don't seem to understand you can't quantify 'skill level' in a number for a game like this.
---
From what the website is describing it as this score should get a more appropriate name like 'aiming and positioning skill approximation'.
---
As such you are bound to automatically rank higher on this score when bumrushing 3-Speed Operators relatively well instead of other playstyles that are more productive for the team.
---
There's one problem. Teamkillers don't care about renown. 
---
This is old
---
Of course there isn't change, you've got kids like yourself playing this game.
---
He has it
---
Amazing looking forward to more posts of these
---
This is useless, most people that team damage/tk/throw are on alternate accounts, they dont care about renown.
---
How the hell is that hacking? All you need is 4 people deranking to surrender after the 1st round.
---
My meme was oc buddy. If I wanted to take people's memes and post them I would go to Instagram. As well, I dont use "paint". Just because I had a template and didnt fuckin draw the meme doesnt mean that someone else should get a free pass from the awful rules.
---
People online target anything about you. I get treated like garbage constantly online and I'm a man. It's not because I'm a man, it's because people like to treat people like garbage online. 
---
Yes
---
?
---
Yeah, thought i’ve seen it before. Drove past it last time I was in Stockholm.
---
Notice how one of them either got boosted or is cheating. 2400 elo last season to diamond this season? That’s suspect
---
Oh so you've seen the clip too?
---
I wish we at least had this is casual 
---
Holy crap :o
---
Shouldn’t you use google?
---
Yeah. I know people are trash. I just get different reactions from female and male friends so far
---
I remember, when getting creamed by the other team, going at it again just to see if we can’t win or be better against them.
---
How about if you have NO team damage
---
Must’ve been in the new patch then.. haven’t played it since 
---
You can stop worrying about giant balls now.
---
You don't reinforce kids room
---
Why? People do nonstop spawnpeeking and runouts anyways. 
---
Carried by hacker?
---
Bruh your post can be reproduced in 5s on paint. Common low effort memes are not allowed. If its a high effort oc post it will stay up.
---
That's what happens when you leave a game before you lose it constantly. 
---
My good sir, I would not. I like to brag when I kill someone with 25 rounds from the same gun.
---
It would be extremely difficult to make a ranking system based on putting down armour, playing monty and pushing etc.
---
More frequent updates != More productivity from the Devs

Frag grenades are a powerful Gadget and how many operators have those only three
---
I did think it only took me like 5 minutes I'm not going to sit here and think all night just to please you are you coming up with any ideas.
---
And say if you cut a hole with the buzz saw so you could use the foam to block it later on in the round.
---
Then the only reason we have is Ubi trying to balance ops.
---
This reminds me of one of those MOBA home screens. Incredibly cluttered and messy.
---
Are you running the new insider build?
---
Do your parents even know you are on reddit?
---
Definitely 
---
You are on console right? I don't know why and how this happened to you...on PC there are players with 100+ ping in so many games.
---
Did you time out and had to reconnect multiple times? Otherwise I can't explain this :/
---
But still getting banned for slow internet...come on Ubi there are better this to do.
---
No the levels of harassment that you're doing right now is sad am I upset no am I annoyed yes. 
---
The stuttering and fps drops also
---
Good PC's don't freeze
---
It's not true. When I play Frost in ranked I asked my teammates to pick a shield for me and it still works.
---
"A developer who seriously considered these ideas would implement them with balance in mind." 
---
Dude, your ego is showing. 
---
I've played this game for a long time, they aren't implementing any of these. 
---
no I’m on console 
---
I gotcha
---
mate you clearly have no idea what you're talking about with this game at all, if holding angles was so consistently good to do it wouldn't be more of an advantage to have better gun skill than game sense at the moment.  
---
I understand that, but it doesn’t make sense his hammer can stop a drone from scanning you, but can’t stop and electronic grenade from going off 
---
Just so you know the actual number doctor strange gives thanos is 14,000,605
---
It's okay bro I've reported you for being harassing
---
let's get this straight though. you didn't get banned because of your connection. you got banned because you left ranked and it ended.
---
and it doesn't kick you if it's at 100. or 200..
---
So accurate!

What is with your power trip here why are you following me from post to post just to basically call me stupid
---
r/absolutemadlad

What? So if you are going, just leave after you die on the last round?

I’m on console, I disconnected once joined and then was loading in got kicked again then got banned for abandoning. It was also late game

*facepalm*

I comment on your post and disagree with you and because I disagree with you, I'm harassing you...?

that's why i put my steam overlay in pause break

I was gonna be on your side but now that I see how YOU are on responding to that comment like that and what "your" definition is of "harassing" is, is just pathetic lol
---
No....shhh, don’t tell them 
---
Wow
---
Aaaannnndd that’s why they’re golds 🙃
---
I play on console almost exclusively and majority of the time it's someone taking minutes to load in due to network if amything. Typically if you dont kick them I find after waiting minutes almost as soon as you load you get a _______ has the left game a good 80% of the time. Even on console it shouldn't take longer for someone to join then what the time limit is to select a character and choose your load out.
---
Nothing about the Waco Raid or the Branch Davidians is wholesome
---
They do hidden recoil changes
---
I agree look at their last post
---
I’ve accidentally thrown a nitro cell but you have to press the same button twice to blow it up.  So tell me, was blowing yourself up REALLY an accident? 
---
I miss old club house 
---
I got tired of casual a long time ago. I play only ranked now, it's much more fun and i stopped worrying about my rank.
---
What if, when you lose health it goes to pink so it's still distinguishable from people full health and when you are downed it becomes red and the small bar becomes a timer slowly ticking down so you can easily see who needs more help.

Course I don't. This is reddit.
---
What about a weekly free rotation? Just like 2-4 operators maybe?

I mean sure, if your only goal is to win in the causal and not have fun, yea, 5 stack and run a lion blitz combo each round.
---
Do you add beans in the barrel?
---
Ping usually doesn’t correlate with your loading. It’s generally because your game is on a hard drive and not an SSD.
