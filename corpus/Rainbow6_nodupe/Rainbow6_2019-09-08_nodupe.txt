It’s a video game brother just have fun...

---
I’ll try. It’s just pathetic knowing how far people are gonna go just to preserve some shitty status symbol made up of a few pixels that means nothing.
---
If they said it, there would have been many discussion and praise on here. Nothing is here and Ubi haven’t said a thing about it.
---

---
But it would be very nice to have those changes.
---
I feel like there was one in chimera where an operator would be able to become invisible halfway through a rounds I want to say it was Hibana or IQ but I know for a fact it was different than the IQ glitch we had in Burnt Horizon.
---
wait, that’s illegal

It's ranked play, some people want to be serious about it and actually get to rank UP not Down because of trolls
---
But then you couldn't kick people who hog the defuser intentionally, troll or destroy friendly gadgets or something like that.
---
yeah its insane
---
Good idea ill do that for sure
---
Console has advantages that pc doesn’t??
---
Ikr but it's hard to shrug it off after 17 times straight

Why do people even use it?
---
I just restarted when i got this problem
---
I get that bro, I deal with that too. But like... you made a post about this. Like as if it really bothered you. I don’t know you, but this makes me think that you REALLY take a video game seriously. It may be annoying, but they’re just having fun. How many YouTubers have you seen do the same thing? Just have fun with them. If you can’t beat them, join them, I guess.
---
alibi is pretty fun lesion is extremely good and vigil is a decent roamer
---
thanks
---
Agreed. It’s just a stupid game.
---
I said i can\`t acces the router. Due to trashy ISP
---
Yeah literally the thing that will stomp them is the government taking a shit on them consoles they’ll use a be w up and account Ubisoft can ban them new account government fucking them then they stop so that sucks
---
I believe there's an option in the settings that allows you to customise your Terrorist Hunt Mode
---
god dammit I fuckin’ hate battlepasses
---
Ubi machine broke
---
How old are you?
---
They’re just horrible at the game
---
Either the 10th or 17th, The new event for the xbox and playstation editions state the 17th
---
Well none of them had mics for starters, and I don't take video games that seriously I go to university I have a job, when I get home I just want to play and enjoy it but can't when kids act this way so yes it does bother me
---

so leave. Tf? If it’s not that important to you, what’s a little abandonment penalty? I might be the minority here but this shit doesn’t bother me

Good job! They probably just jealous they shit at the game and ur good

People don’t like the obj to be secured in casual. Seen as a bad thing with who I play with
---
Nice nice,very nice,Caesar-chan!
---
Report him maybe?
---
I dont see what the community can do
---
Go to settings and change your preferred game mode to defend hostage in T hunt.
---
Are...are you God?
---
Yeah and that's console plat 3
---
They are definitely in a discord call laughing at your reaction
---
I have how getting to plat is generally an achievement, but people who just get lucky in placements get it for free, like back in grim sky I didn't deserve it, but got super easy placements
---
Ps gets it on the 17th
---
Hey you double posted
---
Imagine being outside
---
Yeah anchoring WORKS but I prefer to say "F you" to his shitty deployment times and run around the map as him, deploying the turret on defuser if practical
---
But the stakes are lower.

It’s okay, don’t feel bad. A lot of people get jealous when you ace or clutch because they’re embarrassed of their own gameplay and possibly suspect you’re a smurf.

how are we supposed to see anything with this garbage quality

That’s when the ops should be available for everybody to purchase, otherwise it should next week for sure. Won’t know until the day before they announce it officially.

Very cool.

Dang good bro, I was like 150, before I got my first ace, great job!!!

Because children aren't always ruining the game
---
Lesion 100%
---
That's really cool! You also have a eerily similar figure to nøkk which makes it even better.
---
you got the kill, who cares?
---
if you’re complaining that you think that’s a headshot, stop. you missed every shot near the head
---
That’s not such a bad idea, but I don’t think that people love those things in the first place lol. At least i know I don’t.
---
that
---
Imma yeet that shit from you attackers
---
Both get banned in rank low tier
---
You need some friends to squad up with. Lone wolfing it can be crap for anyone no matter how long you've played
---
u missed the shot stop complaining
---
Nice joke,cowpoke.
---
Aren’t the servers always gay
---
What’s that?
---
Lesion all of the assist points
---
Yes, sorry for the mix up
---
I’m embarrassed and i wasn’t even in the game
---
Absolutely depends on your play style
---
Its more because i like the classics of things and the bombers and stuff seem to make it terrorist hunt for me, Ive trained on them for so long i know id be asking myself "wheres the bombers?" Forgetting they were removed 😂
---
F
---
It's where the defender can NOT leave garage and the attacker can ONLY come through the garage doors
---
Nitro is the best way, especially with team mates, duck hunting them with a shot gun is good too
---
It's a type of custom game
---
Nice. I don't use T-AA because it looks blurry in motion, so I use FXAA with Nvidia Sharpen filter.
---
True. But at least she won't have a folding glock and can't fight in longer distance. 
---
Now only if Ubi combine that with 3 Speed...
---
You get a squad of buddies that shouldn't be a problem.
---
But when you know what casual is and play ranked, you can't expect it to be even remotely same. There is a level of seriousness in a ranked game that would always be there regardless of this game having a pro scene. People play ranked to win. ALWAYS. Unless they are throwers. So in sug a scenario, you need as much balance as you can get to ensure that victory is only based on the skill of the players. Imbalanced maps don't promote that. They'll favour one side. Which isn't good.
---
hell ya I did, check out the imgur album I posted in the comments

Thank you

Best ace in history

vro was high as shit.

Technically, with the mp7, even with similar drop off, her engagement would still be at 15m, in which she is fine with the fmg.
---
3 speed would be real nice though.
---
Better than my experience; join game, get shot in the head, join another game, all your traps get shot and then you get shot in the head, then actually join a game, get down to 1 v 1, teammate walks around starring at floor, sees my dead body, drops to the floor and crawls up to my body while continually shooting my corpse, three feet from the objective, and four feet from the last remaining enemy.

That is the most putrid but most beautiful spot, damn
---
Recoil in this game can largely be controlled without attachments. There are only a few guns like the m4, type 89 and c8 that people will initial have a hard time using with increased recoil.
---
And  dokkabi can know exactly where the objective is
---
I'll welcome anything at this point lol. It's better than being left alone in her current state.

Ummmm lol I don’t think you need ubi for that, that was clearly a headshot.

You should've taken a screenshot while it was rainin. Cause right now it doesn't have the correct feeling. Like that feeling of disgust when you play it.

well I wouldnt call it good, had to run back to gold because it was horrible seeing that stuff, I regret ever dropping ranks on purpose
---
If you don't see it when you search for it, it is most likely not officially announced.
---
Speculated 10th Sept.
---
So you decided to post it again for more karma?
---
But youre talking about a explosive soo it would have damage per area wich makes that if it is well placed you could hurt more than 1 operator, and the fact of starting a round with 50 hp is pretty annoying, sorry man i know you put a lot of effort on this but is just not viable, it would be pretty annoying.
---
I think we could test the flash light from the bomber in thunt on Blitz. Everytime this Bombers run at me I can’t see anything expect an blue light and engouth to shoot him so this could work out I guess.

---
Yeah, that still sounds like a handful, they would have to specify conditions like if they get destroyed by friendly C4 or kapkan trap.   
---
If you would get penalties from destroying your friendlies gadgets then I guarantee that someone will find their kick from placing their gadgets near kapkans traps-   
---
Or accidentally destroying your Mozzies hijacked drone, Mute's jammer, Ela's icecreams, Valk's BE's while reinforcing the walls or strapping them with electricity.   
---
Or does the game count the cellphones OPs drop if theres Dokkaebi and Fuze bombs the place with several drones in it.

---
While bullet drop off is a big part of it but this guy just got absolutely fucked he hit her 5 times at least and even with bullet drop off (which stops after a certain range 28 meters I think don't quote me on that) that should have been a kill
---
I'm positive you have
---
Caveira ain't minding am i right fellas??
---
Get gud
---
thats bullying
---
Thank you, soldier
---
I mean what you just described was promoted in the ranked playlist for the first year and a half of the game when those maps were in ranked, so you're wrong. And what you said is my point, once you play ranked casual isnt fun because it isn't competitive at all.
---
That is a tk in my book

Thanks bro

How.. did you know my secret?

It's an excellent cosplay. Though I do think there's room for improvement when it comes to the head-fishnet-thingy. I'm not sure what the thing on nokk's head is called. The head-thingy on the character model goes further down, to the upper chest. I know nothing about cosplay but perhaps a longer head-thingy made with a heavier material might add to the cosplay. Or perhaps attach the head thing directly to the chest and shoulders. Stealthy velcro? Also, Nokk is a closet destiny weeb. Which is why she wears celestial nighthawk under that head-thingy. Thus I think adding Nighthawk under that head-thingy would be a superb addition to this cosplay.

I mean you're definitely right, it's mainly used as a mean spirited way to fuck with other players and doesn't help that much with team killing.

I had a game kinda similar to this. I choose lesion who I don’t have the elite for and play on my phone for a second. Notice everyone chose elite skins. Before I could switch to mute (whom I have an elite for), I read in the chat “it smell like broke bitch in here” and was kicked.

Why do I feel this in my soul?
---
I see we have similar  flairs
---
I personally like defense more, because of the recoil. It's just not as sweaty like handling the recoil from most of the attacker rifles. For example on attack my fav op is Buck. I love Buck but often I just take someone else (Ash,Blackbeard, Sledge) because Bucks weapon has too much recoil and is very hard to handle in many situations. So it doesn't even matter the defenders have only smgs when you can take a Bandit or Lesion and go for the headshot instead of trying to hit it with your acog jumping around the screen like crazy with Buck

Lucky shots &lt;.&lt;

Oh well then there's nothing to be mad about I guess

Basically what happens is that a bunch of computers spam a website (or IP address) so that the server or computer is overloaded and can’t resolve requests. What it does is like blocking the door to a house or store, making it hard to enter, or in this case, making it hard to get to the server.

There's some actually great data showing it doesn't do anything on these guns! You should check out [Rogue 9's](https://youtu.be/b79vCwE_92k?t=359) video on the topic. Linked at relevant timestamp but the whole vid is great.
---
cool
---
You shouldn't need to micromanage constantly. Call out general plays, and general strats, you can micromanage certain strats and how it needs to be done specifically for smokes and timed pushes and things. But, that wouldn't work if your team has never tried that before. I guess it is a mix of both.
---
Also, it isn't only the IGLs job to call strats and plays, the rest of your team should be contributing as well if they have a strat or see a weakness in the enemies set ups. 
---
They should be able to figure out what to do on their own most of the time though tho. It is very hard to be IGL if you are at the same time, teaching your team mates how to play lol.
---
Okay. Thanks for reading even while tired :).
---
1) I understood that may had been the case but... that's only because people were not looking for the traps and the rounds are too short for the attackers to look and not rush in. (reinforcing my point 3)
---
2) Interesting stats. Do you have link to back up this? This is certainly not the case when I play on PC.

Now i have depression

Nah bro I see what you mean but at the end of the day it’s the history behind the word as well and also you don’t know what kind of experiences the person has had in the past with racism. I just wanted To make it public to show that if you are new or old to the game and wanting to act like a prick over a game of casual someone might be recording and make your actions public.

Aww using castle plus no attachments?  That's sad yet cute at the same time lol

I hate that too...Every time I shoot drones in Casual the opposite team calls me a sweaty noob. Sorry for playing the game but I'll continue denying you the Intel
---
*change my prismas
---
It was just luck, there was no aim at all

You're really gonna deny that this one was especially toxic? Iron sights across the map MP7 kill as recruit is already salty enough lmao

What cosplay? I can see the Cav, but I don’t see a Nøkk

I want an attack medic with the capability to drop smoke and drag a downed team mate out of the frying pan then slowly heal. I believe he should have a medic bag where he loses his combat capabilities to use. Instead of syringes, the medic bag will have a pool of HP, the HP being it’s ammo. The medic holds his hand on his team mate to heal but only has enough HP to fully heal a previously downed team mate, or heal about a quarter of three operators etc.

Ah yeah the never ending sweaty plats in casual as always

Lol
---
I'm actually gonna try this next time I runout. I usually go for the prefire, notice my aim is off, try to adjust, and then lose my head.
---
I'm not a modeler so i'll take your word for it ;) it's likely that doing what the post asks is possible, but would require artists or devs to do that instead of other things, and probably Alibi is deemed as not in need of a rework... Who knows
---
thanks anyway, didn't know about the memes
---
I mean I personally don’t really agree, and here’s my own thoughts about it, along with some statistics, 
---
So most maps actually have about a 51-55% win rate for defense, the exception being Coastline which is an almost dead even split, making it the most balanced map in the game statistically. Your stats simply reflect you’re not as good at attacking as you are defending: I’m probably the same way. I love defending, and would rather defend every time. That being said, ones personal stats don’t reflect the game as a whole, and overall the win deltas are pretty decent between attacking and defending. Especially with how ranked works: if you attack first you only need to win a single round. Then you can win all three defense rounds to complete the match. Shouldn’t be hard for someone whose win percentage is 10% higher than average. 
---
It comes down to this: you just need to get better at attacking. And I’m not saying it to be mean: it’s genuine advice. I *sucked* at attacking for a long time. It took me so long to find operators I was good with and a playstyle that fit me. A big deal for me was getting rid of ACOGs: I’m generally my teams rush/entry fragger and I have absolutely no use for ACOGs whatsoever. Going against the stigma and switching to Reflex was one of the single best decisions I ever made for my own Siege experience. Play around with your own playstyle and find what works. It’s possible you’re not playing to your own strengths as much. Another tip I’d give is look at the objective and the enemy ops and think about how you’d play if that was you. Learning to get into the minds of the defenders makes attacking much easier. It helped me a ton because I stopped dying 15 seconds after breaching in, and learned where I could safely rotate to support my team. 
---
On to what you said about guns: it’s a completely even balance and should be left alone. It’s one of the best balances in the game. Here’s the reason: there’s a teeter-totter balance between defense and offense style guns. Offense boasts weapons that hit much harder and have longer range (both in damage drop off and the use of ACOG scopes), while boasting a medium rate of fire. Defense guns are designed to dominate close sightlines: they have extremely high rates of fire, albeit less damage per bullet and most don’t have ACOGs. On both sides the ones with the highest rates of fire (and therefore the highest damage per second) have the steepest recoil to make them for fit for closer ranges). The balance comes from each side’s strengths. Attackers can peek windows and long sightlines with long range scopes and have a clear advantage there. Defenders can camp inside and wait for attackers to come in, where they have the advantage. But I would argue the exact opposite when it comes to guns. Defenders may have some amazing weapons on their side (the Mx4 Storm is my personal favorite) but the advantage is overwhelmingly stacked in favor of attackers when it comes to gun vs gun. With weapons like the F2, the AK12, the C7E and the R4C on attack the defenders can get shredded. Plus, the use of droning takes away defense’s element of surprise, so you should be able to use superior firepower to win as an attacker. The only argument I could see for defender guns is rate of fire, which does boost your chances of getting a headshot, but that’s neither here nor there: defenders may put more bullets down range but attacker bullets still hit hard enough to even it out. I’ll take my Para 308 over the Vector any day of the week. 
---
On to your final point about attackers being weaker than defenders: again, wholeheartedly disagree. I’ve always felt attackers are way more punishing if used right than defenders. Don’t like Valk or Echo? Play IQ. Don’t like Mira? Play Twitch, Buck, or Hibana. It’s 100 times easier to counter defender gadgets with a coordinated team than it is for defense to do the same. And attackers can completely ruin your ability to coordinate as defense. From breaching walls to destroying gadgets like Maestro cams the right attacker can absolutely obliterate defense. Even operators considered “weak” like my boy Fuze are devastating in the right hands (believe me he’s incredible if you actually know how to play him with a coordinated team, but most people don’t take the time to learn how to actually run him and die immediately therefore he’s “bad”). 
---
All in all I can sympathize: sometimes attacking sucks. But it’s really a pretty balanced system, and I’ve been on both sides of the equation enough to realize you win some you lose some.
---
Magic of number 10
---
this looks strangely like real life... anyone else?
---
Oh hell yeah then we are definitely gonna have fun 
---
Could be much worse for us though. Me and my squad are teaching a coworker of mine to play Siege. He just picked up the game a week ago. This man is gifted when it comes to being unlucky and bad. I have never seen someone play 10 matches and finish 6 of them 0 and 4 before
---
Ubi said the same shit about For Honor, and they managed to do it, so they can, it may just need a lot of work
---
oh ok
---
Lion for sure
---
I feel like everyone's aim is bad/imperfect on this game, that's why I like it
---
No console has a huge ddos problem if youra high rank its almost every 3/4 games
---
H
---
I guess so but if that was the case they would’ve patched it since day 1 when people complained. There’s a reason behind it, possibly because they didn’t want to have a wall completely overpowered with every gadget in the game so bandit stops it. 
---
If that was the case, then disabling it would be better.
---
Oh and a huge mod pack or macros problem
---
Well, if you win yes but rolls are only guaranteed for wins, so if you were to loose you wouldn't get a roll meaning you wouldn't get a pack
---
He's speaking the language of the gods!
---
Solid work. I was scrolling quickly and thought to myself at first.. “what’s the big deal with this screen grab?” Probably a combo of I need more coffee and your hard work.
---
Yeah I figured. I had someone ask me the question of "If you hit 100 percent does it give you the pack or do you have to win another game" and have been unable to answer. I assumed it meant you had to win another game.
---
Yea winning is fun, bit whem you olay against a 5stack oushing woth strats organized as german soldier in WW2 and droning every inch before even looking into a room, than it's not fun to play against. You, you seem lik a player who really enjoys dumoing around while just talking about some dumb shit with his buddys

Fairly sure gold is the average rank, no?

Have you checked your settings in game? Sounds stupid but sometimes it's that simple...

The report toxic behavior doesn't work. Playing with friends is always the best option, yeah this game is toxic sometimes but with friends it's good toxicity

Most likely 10th of this week because of the release of new proleague skins (not the gold ones) . And please use google search before posting
---
I think they will put them in the battle pass
---
In game settings are fine. The weirder issue is that once I am using discord, I can't hear sounds from any other application except discord, which includes even YouTube videos.
---
The base game operators are some of the strongest in the whole game, for all levels of play.
---
You gain no unfair advantage by purchasing the remaining DLC operators. Some are great ops yes, but that doesn't make you any better at the game, or give you a sudden increased win chance.
---
Also bear in mind, if you're buying standard edition of the game, you're only paying a fraction of the cost of the original game, and in return you can obtain the remaining operators by just playing the game.
---
Ok then, have you checked your discord settings? Or the authorizations in your computer's parameters? 
---
Maybe try contacting the discord support, they might be able to help you :/

You’re kidding right? You think the revive is the most important part? Not the immunity to flashbangs and Ela Mines, the +20 health, and the recoil reduction. But the revive? And it makes a loud sound for not even a full second dude. Look at the data for her. She has the highest win rate out of EVERYONE. Attackers and Defenders. Not to mention that she has a damn laser for an Assault Rifle AND frag grenades. Just stop dude.
---
Well, make sure steam and siege are on your ssd, then lower some of your settings. Play a few test matches. Use vsync if you arent.  Play some more test matches. 
---
Maybe figure out what's happening on screen when fps drops. Then change settings that would affect those things.

But, it’s just not

Absolutely fckin yes. Very useful once you get the hang of her. Droning+candela gets you easy kills quite often. Her gun is pretty ok. Claymores and breachs as her utility. Overall a solid op.

„They said it couldn’t be done...“ - Jäger
---
true
---
Nøkk, Warden's gadget is pretty situational and usually requires predicting when a flash or smoke will occur. 
---
Honestly, as a defender Glaz he doesnt stack up imo, cause say its Warden vs. Glaz, you can turn on the glasses for the smoke but that Glaz, if good, will fill you full of holes before you even know what you're looking at.
---
I have the same problem in casual, the matchmaking there is fucking broken.
---
EEEEEEEEH Nice idea man
---
That was a risky move.
---
Is that duck tape on your pants?
---
what did i watch
---
That's why I never see female players solo queuing (with mic on), they usually queue with friends when I do see them
---
I see this as a solo queue playlist. But I will still be talking on it.
---
Thank you very much r/BarcanLUL!
---
Did that airjab launch you THROUGH the soft wall?
---
The first one is free so we'll see what Ubi has in mind.
---
It's almost impossible to make Nøkks head gear accurate to her ingame model due to the net physics being weird. Plus I couldn't get my hands on her actual helmet bc its law enforcement only atm
---
I don't personally care about what he said, it's just words. But the whole point is just a few months back Unisoft was banning people for saying anything slightly offensive. So, for a Dev to say stuff like that is counterintuitive.
---
This doesn’t mean that it can’t tend towards realism.
---
So in that logic, having an alibi set up in a window could litteraly do the same thing. Stop telling people how to play alibi if you're going off of purely situational plays
---
Its politics. Any SDE with real world experience knows coding is not just coding. It absolutely could be done with the current tool set. The people in charge are not going to spend time and resources on a QOL change like this for the 10 people crying about it.
---
How to spit on console players fr

\- I play on console so :(

Because you can only have those in your name if you are actually an Dev. Like they won't let you otherwise.

Original spook vs. [REDACTED] spook

If it is on PC you are getting then your experience will be much better than if you are getting it on console. This game takes a lot of time to learn everything and it will be overwhelming

Yeah this community is usually very friendly, it’s just those few people who bring it down.

Has anyone posted a pic of them gaining their MMR back after losing to a team with a hacker? I haven’t gotten or seen one yet. Just curious if anyone else has seen that yet.
---
Lord tachanka
---
Thats not a problem, its a benefit. Mele kills wont get you anything except 10 bonus points. Its better to just shoot them and not get too greedy by getting even closer to an enemy. A mele kill can be avoided easily so I do not suggest you to change your shooting habbit.
---
They’re not gonna do it because of an elite skin
---
#2 is the expensive part and probably why it’s not implemented. It’s not sustainable

Yes, if they determine you lost games to a hacker, you will get back the MMR you lost.

Yep through soft walls, deployable shields, and even Chanka turrets
---
What he lacks is not the experience to do it himself. What he lacks is the real world experience to know that coders dont just code whatever they want. Doing development in school and in the real world Is completely different. His argument does not take into account any politics.
---
&gt;You simply have to look at how much satisfaction you get for x amount of work
---
Money. You mean money. Ubisoft doesn't give a shit about satisfaction.
---
&gt;simply isn't worth it.
---
Worth money. Again. Somehow GTA 5 and Witcher 3 have small details off the fucking roof and they are (or were, in case of GTA 5) singleplayer games.
---
Should just added "great" on the end. Ben is great

I prefer all the changing the holograms positions thing, better than the match skins
---
This photo was taken at the end of a con day and in 90 degree heat with humidity. So I was constantly taking my helmet on and back off to walk around/ be able to see/ be more comfortable. I tried velcro, but it resulted in a bubble effect for the net when I would turn my head and such. My net does go down to my plate carrier, but due to the photo angle/ me lifting my head I can see why the net looks wonky.
---
I've broken shields before but I never knew it would knock you through a wall. Thanks for the post! Always nice when I can learn something from it

---
All suggestions are welcome! Its an idea I've had for quite sometime.
---
Looks great!
---
I’m pretty sure Ubisoft said they couldn’t do it, it would be really complicated to add into the game
---
If an elite skin comes out, take for sure that I would probably get it
---
IQ or Tachanka they have the best booty. 🍑
---
Did it get anyone?
---
Doesn't matter you'll get all eventually.
---
No

I once flick shot a teammate on accident and he was even mad, he was like "damn good shot bro"
---
Ah yes 6 rounds per minute
---
This also happened to me a few days ago, I hate that so much. What‘s the problem of being a girl playing r6? I‘m getting tked so often, but I just want to have fun
---
If you are on PC, the R6 tracker app will show you your MMR during placement matches.

I thought it was a weirdly bad quality photo at first. Like it looks like a picture of a Polaroid.

---
If they can change the model and textures of the character, they can change it for the same model that isn't controlled by the character. It is in no way an engine limitation.
---
Pretty sure it is ok
---
In short it is when one can see you, but you cannot see them.
---
Your point being? "Good things exist, so all the bad things are justified"? 
---
Some people had some great shit under feudalism, doesn't make the system as a whole and all the bad shit justified.
---
I disagree.  I think it's just like every other tool in the game, there's more than one way to use it and there's always a situation where one of those uses can win you a round.
---
This has been fixed
---
Oh, so he means the ping abusers?
---
And my drone army grows by one
---
I think Alibi's Prismas have a huge impact on the game.  At the beginning of Parabellum, the system counted all the Prismas as real Operators.
---
Some real copper aim at the beginning
---
3mags
---
its definately the lighting and quality that makes it seems to real

Tagged both of them:   [u/Ubi-Ludo](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ubi-Ludo), [u/UbiNoty](https://www.reddit.com/u/UbiNoty)   
---
Thanks for that idea.
---
I see now. I wish they'd fix it, but idk how they can.
---
It is a nice skin for a good gun
---
Dok is a pain in the bum, but useful solo too since you can use it instead of droning yourself + helps your randoms.
---
No one is really the "best operator" as they all have pros and cons or emphasize certain specialty. 
---
That being said, Lesion and Zofia are very versatile in almost every map. Hard to go wrong with these two.
---
He is to powerful
---
*queen
---
Highly unlikely that is an Ubisoft Employee. Pretty sure Ubi dev usernames have Ubi_ or _Ubi format, as those are restricted from use for non-employees. This just looks like someone with a novelty account name.
---
It also would make very little sense for an employee to risk his job by behaving like that on a company profile.
---
Kaid with his DMR shotgun is great for spawn peaks and a godsin on Oregon in tower(Killed 4 people once up there as him and his pistol)
---
Wym? Are you talking about registering shots or running out and being detected?
---
No, it is most common in upside down rappel. 
---
You can look at the window and see nothing, but an attacker can be there and see you and blast you away without you being able to really do anything. It happens a lot of other places as well
---
Nice work! I love this
---
Ubi has addressed that they cannot do anything about DDOS because Microsoft has to look into it since it is their server.
---
Regardless, they did say they are looking into it, but their hands are tied. Same for server stressing.
---
Next thing you know frost whips out the super 90 when you least expect it
---
Yes, but now you’ve funneled the attackers somewhere else, not only delaying them, but forcing them somewhere else where your roamers can catch them. 
---
And there are many sites with powerful windows that attackers fight to control. For instance, putting a prisma at the arcade window on he second floor theme park helps deny the attackers visibility and the ability to cut off rotates. 
---
Or mining and red stair window on Kafe. Same principle. Both are common entry points and used to hold down the site, prismas reduce the attackers ability to use those windows.
---
Also, as more skins come out (not just for alibi, but for everyone) it increases the ambiguity of what operator it could be.  A problem magnified by the ongoing trend of cosmetics straying away from the original intent of tactical realism and moving further into the realm of cartoon fantasy (looking at you top hat black beard and unicorn smoke). 
---
 There was a time in this game where you could identify an op just by the sight of their shoes.  I should never have to wonder if I'm looking at Caveira or a Prizma
---
No she just wsiting for her to pass by so she can interogate her properly
---
It's a game not the Pinnacle of human existence. Just buy the game.
---
Knife skins would be useless. You barely ever see it, and when you do, it’s for less than 5 seconds. Cavs shotgun doesn’t need a buff.
---
Okay this earns you an upvote. Nicee
---
If they make an Alibi elite it would only make sense to give the same skin to the hologram as well since they always change the look of the  elite gadget too
---
It is ok I guess in my opinion
---
I only play meaty boy when my team gets shitkicked, which is alot
---
So cute
---
I know ha ha
---
Toxicity is a myth in this game. The R6 community is known as somehow "toxic" however most people are just trying to improve and help eachother. When you do run into that one toxic player it just encourages you to play better than them. Buy the game and stick with it and you won't regret it
---
Rally hard to compare. It depends on what you want and need.
---
Definitely not the greatest imo but surely not the worst
---
I go on Reddit maybe once or twice a day, depending on how much siege I’ve been playing recently.
---
yeah i forgot to add her mag size would go down like 50% and smamabilty reduce also or just give her shotgun some barrel attachments
---
More like, an ok-ish skin for the worst pistol in the game.
---
Why? Pre-fire and wall spamming are a part of Siege
---
As a silver, recent bronze, I can confirm that copper players are in fact that bad.
---
I think that's more fair. Perhaps give delayed or shortened pings even
---
Not opening them wouldn’t be hard. Getting them in general would be. I went on a crazy ranked win streak all the way up until 40% and finally got one. Same thing happened again yesterday at 45% and now I’m back up to like 39%. In just unlucky I guess
---
True, true ^
---
Figure out where is the safest possible place you can “camp” the common plant spot. For example in Bank Servers I try to open up the connector walls and play in office. The canisters are relatively easy to chuck and you bring your shotgun to open up easy lines to throw them. Smoke is insane because he can deny 30 seconds of push or plant. His SMG-11 is also one of the absolute best guns of the game once you figure out the recoil and ammo management.
---
Mira
---
Looks wonderful. Could you do Jäger?
---
I'll try it. I like having games on max if I can. I feel like I shouldn't need to change settings with my setup especially since it was running fine not long ago but I guess the game is just really demanding.
---
What res and settings?
---
I'm a girl, and I get spammed with this shit almost daily. It's either I get tked, and told "Go make me a sandwich", or they don't stop talking to me while I'm trying to play, and then yell at me if I mess up. It's incredibly toxic and I have to play with friends.
---
This actually works sometimes. If the Habana is shooting at it from white van she might not notice. And when she does is usually too late
---
Lmao
---
Do you have a group you consistently play with? If you don't these ops will be hard to utilize to their fullest extent because they require a coordinated team to use.
---
**Kacherg**
---
Why compare an attacker with a defender?
---
Spectator glitch
---
I personally would choose Mira because she helps the whole team the most compared to Ying. This opinion would change however if you need better defense or better offense rn
---
Info is fake, assumptions for the sake of conceptual design.

There is no reason not to use it , but there is no reason to ; it’s really your choice. Me personally no bc the roni can only be used for headshots, if you can’t get headshots at long range ( or even close range) the roni is not worth it  as the commando has more power at all ranges.
---
I was thinking a glitch effect where it show you as a hidden entity and the pings appear as if you were teleporting everywhere. Even tho it cancels it out, Jackal may be able to catch you off guard or when the gadgets recharging.

Who were you playing the matches prior

Yeah I’m terrible with Blitz lol

They should just as a immediate fix, buff the EB a bit. Just a bit.

Currently it competes for the place of most useless attachement in the game.

You countered one run out, and a predictable one too. Did you really think this was post worthy? /:
---
The community, shitty hit reg, bugs, exploits, why the hell do I even play this game?
---
The in-game description is a lie though. It doesn't actually keep full damage at longer ranges, it just raise the minimum damage at long range. Rogue-9 has done a few videos on the extended barrel and has found them to be mostly useless as 95% of encounters in Siege happen within 10 meters, and the Extended Barrel doesn't have any benefits within 20-25 meters.
---
I don't play siege a lot, but I think this would be more than a minor change, there is no point in buying any cosmetics for that Operator since after the first round you would know if the guy who is playing her has a different skin or not. 
---
I didn't know it was because of an engine limitation but in all honesty, why make an Operator like her if your engine can't even support something that definitely should be a part of her kit?
---
Countering Amaru before she's even out... big brain to the max.

Ohh damm I didn't think of this. Thanks pal

Y. It's amazing, but why
---
I can relate. Say no to girls who play fortnite.
---
Why not both?
---
Ok you have surpassed my experience
---
It still helps in range and the damage drop-off for the roni is pretty bad so it can still save you
---
He literally says that they are either lazy or that she will get a different hologram when she gets the elite, which are both stupid thinking. They are not 5-10 people making a small indie game and when and if Alibi actually gets an Elite skin she won't have the myriads of different combinations that she now has with all the different cosmetics. She will just have a single one.
---
Additionally, you may not need 20+ years of experience to know general things about game engines but you do need experience in the specific engine to talk in such detail about it as if you have ever used it. As long as Anvil is proprietary people need to stop talking about it if they haven't worked specifically with it. It's like saying I have X car which can do Z, therefore Y car should also do Z. Or I know how to drive X car, therefore I should know how to drive Y car. Every engine is different and suits a different purpose. Especially, proprietary engines.

No, the second last person you downed was definitely a zofia

Haha, that's great! Did you give her instructions for the logo or did she come up with it herself?

It helps that you'll do your job right, either as defender or roamer. That's why I told you it depends on your playstyle.

defender could save the site when hit suddenly in a clutch situation, and roamer can make a kill,two or more and give his team the chance for easy round.

I don't have this issue on PC, haven't played on console in a long while

You could run Holo or reflex but your best bet is to try for the headshot or if you know where they are prefire them

Now that you mention it, I feel like this is true. I haven't played siege for 2 months almost so I vaguely remember the sounds, but it was always kind of echoey

just googled it and apparently its 30, i know it was 20 when i started playing but thought it was moved up to 50 to match the upper limit of the newcomer playlist

I didn't want to resort to downed kills
---
My fav part is when you killed the creeper
---
I find for me when I solo queue its like playing a different game. People generally play super weirdly at low ranks making them extremely hard to predict so you have to drone so much more. When I play with my friends and we play high golds to low mid plays they are a lot easier to read and for the most part don't run around doing stupid shit (most of the time)
---
I would say I'm in the same boat. Most of the people I know would say im a mid level plat player. 
---
I find silvers and low golds to be more annoying as they just peek everything like a maniac. Thought process is "should I peek or should I not peek? I shouldn't peek. Does it anyways"

They may have bought an account too but it was nuts how much they were hacking.

No I agree and the captions so smug considering the fact he t bagged after getting the kill means it wasn't something common for him to have done

Some people saw my xbox avatar and saw that I'm black and started saying  things like "call me nigger and make me pick cotton" and "he's a nigger teamkill him".
---
yeah, i think ubi thinks battleye is way better than it really is because they have no other way to deal with hacking when it fails and it fails a lot
---
In EA’s defense the FIFA companion app is amazing.

Maybe they are talking about when the first bullet kills the guy by the bunk, but idk I didn’t see one either

you can do it by placing bandits too. but it's just 5 points and in this game xp really doesn't matter after lvl 30

CSGO's anticheat is the pinnacle right now. It uses an AI to detect cheat behavior server side and sends the suspect into Overwatch review. It also has a Trust system that matches players based on how likely it is that they are cheating or smurfing. But yea, after that BE and EAC are good

Well the anti-cheat software itself sucks. Valve Anti-Cheat is almost the worst anticheat. However, they built a system of human review that brought it back up. There is no AI, it is stat analysis plus report frequency. Almost no bans on CSGO are VAC bans, they’re dev(Overwatch bans).

When you place Bandits car batteries against a reinforced wall, you get 5 points. You can pick it up, and place it on the same wall and get 5 points again. It makes less noise and imo it's safer than standing infront of a door.

Kaid and Gridlocks AUG's. Captiao's para 308 is also similar if you're going with ROF/Handling characteristics

Yes. But run outs have a higher chance at having a three speed getting the kills.

Ex. 3 speed impact on garage wall on outback
---
alley run out bank top/bottom
---
theme park run out on the sign
---
 Those run outs arent very close range. More like mid.

Oh god wtf are those binds, it hurts me

For me it's a toss up between Dokkaebi or Hibana on Attack and Vakyrie or Doc on Defence

i play on both NA and EU and i find both pretty easy. the only difference and why i play EU more i’d because i’m at 22 MMR on US and 80 on EU😂

Nice
---
Turn up your brightness, they're not that hard to spot.
---
I dont like lesion. he needs a nerf on total damage he can give with 1 gu. like Dokkaebi the gu mine should have a timer. like the effect will stop after 25 hp done to you. or you can remove before it.   
---
also remember you can see and hear echo drones in plains ceiling. but you cant actually see lesion in most the ground surfaces.
---
Neck shots are head shots, they have been since Red Crow:
---
&gt; We have changed the neck multiplier from 2.5X damage to the same multiplier as the head. Basically, that means that a shot that lands in the neck will now count as a headshot.

For all the low effort art that gets posted on here and magically gets 4k upvotes, this is not one of those artworks. Good job my dude!

Zofia or thermite but not with a shotgun

---
You really can’t see them. You can catch their outlines sometimes if they’re placed in well lit areas or on certain surfaces but most times, they’re tough to see from standing. Obviously IQ is really useful for countering Lesion and if you got good eyes, they’re easier to see while droning from the low line of sight and (I think) your drone might physically be able to bump into them.
---
Typically if it’s you vs Lesion and times running out, it’s gg, he played you. You need to have a pretty steady paced methodical assault to avoid the mines he’s already placed and kill him before he places all 7 he gets over the course of the round.
---
this reeks M&amp;K... all those sharp small turns  around corners...
---
I think it is boosting not sure it is under the term cheating because I encountered a couple of boosters. But idk why I am being downvoted I am just expressing my thought on this huge mmr loss that caught me by surprise.
---
You can’t remove the mine before damage it does 10 upon contact making lesion already more powerful than he should be

You WILL be sooner or later. Most likely in the last 1v1 or 1v2 you brought from a 1v3 or 1v4 and got yourself low.

Why not talk about Jackals ban rate? Surely the data tells you there is an issue with him based on the data. You know, the data you can't argue with because the data proves everything.

I mean the only person who can realistically spot them out easily is IQ but even she has to watch out for them. I’ve gotten plenty of game winning kills because people on low health rush obj or last person with just a few seconds remaining.
---
Zofia looks like your playing the game in 8bit lol jagers is cool
---
Maverick can destroy a reinforced hatch/ a single wall if you use him correctly. Hibana can destroy three hatches/ a single wall, Thermite can get two of both. All can destroy reinforced walls, which no one else can do. That makes him a hard breacher.
---
I don’t even you know what you’re saying at this point. I thought you were trying to make a solid point about balance, but now I see you’re just trollin 😂

---
Yachts not the bad imo
---
Theme park makes me puke tho
---
Nice cosplay sister in law
---
Definitely. The only reason I say reduce the recoil, though, is because the MG is not supposed to be a gun, it's supposed to be a gadget, which means it's supposed to be unique and deployable. With that in mind, and considering that it is immobile and requires set up, it should be better than most, if not all, the main weapons. Otherwise, there is just no reason to use it based on the drawbacks.
---
Yes, her smg on console is basically useless. It is just as bad as the smg 12 imo.  I can't speak for pc however
---
Well, if you can't beat em, join em.
---
I like him but yeah as the comment above says you gotta use him correctly
---
I really hope that some people get that reference
---
The_JollyFox fucking blows
---
Honestly Elas weapons are fine as they are. I main Ela and use the SMG, and if used right can be really effective at any range. So no she does not need a buff
---
Oops

I was actually killed on this same hatch before because someone did this. I ran in front door, took someone out on stairs but got lit up, and moved along the wall while still watching stairs as I had heard someone else shuffling around up there... then went straight into the hatch and got electrocuted. It was my fault for being hasty, but goddamn.
---
Pc? I play on console and its hard to use her
---
Dude used it like an ended pearl at the first few seconds
---
Nope. The weapon doesnt really do anything besides break every wall in existence. Her mx4 storm is pretty good
---
How do you even
---
We all did this b4 lol
---
True
---
Ey! I love that mountain! Good for the Lord, having a quality day.
---
ZEN IS THAT YOU
---
Pretty sure that was me, I felt like running the MP7 that round and was like "I don't really use my gadgets on casual, do I?"
---
And I saw the hatch and thought "Why not lol"
---
You should have your crosshairs placed where you think an enemy might be. If you are coming around a corner be aiming at any height or location where a defender could be holding. When in doubt, just keep your crosshair at head-level.
---
An arena for a custom games workshop with different modes that have many customizable options
---
But why?
---
I can’t think of an overall encompassing meta as it’s mostly on a map-to-map basis, but if I were to  nail one that is a generally good strategy is information gathering. Knowing the location of your opponent and what operators they are gives you an INSANE advantage in most situations.
---
Friend did this and destroyed a twitch drone
---
could be that you won one and got lets say 18 mmr and lost 16 in another match against a cheater
---
No, but I do watch his videos from time to time.
---
I really want a grocery store map
---
Ah yes
---
Cartman is truely a god thank you sir/ma'am for conforming it
---
IDK why but laughed so hard on this.
---
you can definitely train your aim and Pro League is not just about aim, its about communication and game sense
---
Man won't shut up about being a kaid main, he's got good videos but damn he just won't shut up about it.
---
Just imagine a server filled with like 20 people watching 2 people fight with sledge inside the fucking Roman Colosseum
---
Why are they putting out twitch prime what’s wrong with normal twitch
---
Happy birthday, hope u use thermite alot
---
Good for you ig? Don’t really care
---
Axiz.MinD#2329   Right now the Discord is just for managers and the owner but If you decide you want to join the Org I’ll invite you
---
It’s in New Hampshire
---
He's been dealt with ;) hahaha
---
Oh I agree cuz I love using her but I think the argument is that she would have too much going for her if her pistol had a red dot and did more damage. I think it’s dumb, it’s not like it’s a .22
---
No that's not what the post is about, the post was about maps, I know that because I just re read it...
---
You aren't bright
---
Did you forget what argument you where responding to? 😂
---
Well damn. That's not good. I remember on Xbox some people hit servers and everyone disconnected, voiding the entire match. Then there were those guys who would lag the game to where our entire team couldn't move but they could. It was bad. I hope ubi does something.
---
Literal bots.
---
If your gonna record with your phone at least put some effort into getting a good angle and not making it look like dogshit
---
now I look at it, this would work on any top floor floor hatches, preventing Amaru from hooking upwards behind you
---
Ok I’ll add you tomorrow, about to go to sleep
---
Woa
---
Oh geez a .49 kd ratio
---
Should sledged both
---
I really don't see why it can't do 44 damage like the five-seven.
---
It's not like it would make a difference, it's a quality of life buff really.
---
Sure thing bud, I’ll do it just for your validation next time! Have fun living life so negatively :)
---
He is a dev though he should be held to a higher standard.
---
yea i agree
---
\-ps4
---
What store tho
---
Retard
---
Yeah see you
---
Before I saw the cosplay tag I thought this was a 3d render...
---
I never want to go to that store that’s why I’m asking
---
Thanks, I believe you have one too?
---
console be like:
---
Lighting. It's the one thing that changes good graphics to bad graphics. The good lighting makes it look a a shity picture
---
Nah I’m black so I have the N word pass
---
That game is so fucking broken ^(sometimes)
---
Does it really matter, the charm is hideous.
---
I got my major charms after like two days though. Also, in case you don’t already know, you have to watch 19 hours to be guaranteed a charm, so don’t be surprised if you don’t get it.
---
You can have multiple passes mate
---
I agree. Its a good one.. now Tower, is complete shit
---
Bro Im not spending another 60gb from my dad just so I can play with a bunch of sweaty tryhards and unfinished mechanics
---
I count it
---
Gsu parking pass, Xbox game pass, N word pass I think I’m at my max.
---
Theres always that dude tryna convince the team to flip and kill everyone 🤣🤣
---
You're right, those are some good references! I am currently a Design student and want to design experiences (to do with digital media). I am aware of the missing buttons and other elements. I made this conceptual stuff in a short span without actually doing a big prototype. Still, thanks for noticing. I will keep all of this in mind, going to make something for Apex Legends next!
---
You will pay with your blood
---
Bruh cop the pimp skin for it, I have it. It’s nice
---
It's called build up nerd
---
And play hockey with me
---
Nope! I’m on 8, don’t try that funny business with me
---
I have more trouble with buck. Not with reflex sight but with acog.
---
There would be 13 total twitches because the twitch that took the screenshot still has 2 twitch drones
---
Just because you say something is good then go on a negative rant about something you can't even muster the energy to begin to do doesn't mean you're not being an asshole. 
---
TL:DR? Just because its your opinion doesn't free you from being a fucking asshole.
---
I am a console player
---
Every considered kaid?
---
Nope
---
This happened to me yesterday too. How is this a thing?
---
Is there such thing as a copper match? Always see gold along with copper.
---
I’ve never been more honored to be compared to such a god 😖
---
Ahh okay. We have a Mount Washington here in Canada too
---
It’s called r6stats
---
Take the death and move on
---
If you want to work on your aim, do terrorist hunts solo.
---
I agree, such is the nature of this game, it is required to pre-fire. Which I don't necessarily think is actually a good thing, after 2000 hours and reaching Diamond. But doesn't matter :P.
---
*Laughs in just buy a 2TB SSD*
---
Buddy that's not the point
---
That's what it's about. Having fun, I'm not the best either but I do enjoy playing casual or ranked.
---
I dissagree
---
As well as the Thin Purple Line for EMT and the Thin Green Line for Park Rangers, Border Security
