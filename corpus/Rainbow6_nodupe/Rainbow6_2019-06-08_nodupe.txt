???

Restart console
---
Alright I hope it works
---
Same thing happened to me, But worse. Lagged out of ranked, had to reque got into an entirely different game and lost to Diamond booster nerds. Lost two games in one, Pretty good I should say. It‚Äôs just ubi and you‚Äôve gotta just deal with it.
---
Good luck
---
I get what you mean,wish we get a "wipeout" section in the scoreboard just like in games such as cod bo4 blackout.
---
The person who downed that one guy gets the full kill and the teammate who killed the downed person gets a wipeout kill point.
---
? How come the legendary 11 kills
---
Fuck off back to Facebook with this shit.

How man gu mines did you place in your doorway

Only problem is that it would be too op if Mozzie was able to throw a twitch drone.

Hi [REDACTED]!

Nice to see you here! I heard you are now doing [DATA EXPUNGED].

every season up to now has had a hard MMR reset at the beginning of a new season. with phantom sight, everyone starts out at 2500 elo (around gold 4 I think), and you do placements like that
---
You deserved it
---
They don‚Äôt even acknowledge TH anymore. The AI is broken, the spawn bugs are game breaking, and there has been nothing new.
---
So you‚Äôre saying competitive shouldn‚Äôt be fun.... ok
---
Restarting my PS4 didn‚Äôt fix it üòî

Your fault

Its on the 11th i think

Dang I actually thought I was getting better... Fml

yeah i fucked up, edited the comment.

Oh no

Where‚Äôs the acog sight?

4-6 kills if the whole team putting their part and I don‚Äôt have a main I use everyone

Also can you do more than 4 bans in customs? I tried it just now and it says either none or 4....

I'm confused how he has no ops because all versions on steam have free ops

so this happened.... didn't know that was possible

Your acting like the word ‚ÄòAt‚Äô was making it obvious you sleep at work. And tbh I don‚Äôt believe you work 120 hours a week and have time to sleep, play rainbow and comment on reddit posts. However guess it depends on your job.
---
Can't pace blame if you dont put a source
---
Wow Greg.
---
Idk really. This must‚Äôve been a bug the players in that game took advantage of
---
I remember when I got an ace a Kapkan with only 1% of my health remaining, but that was an impressive ace.
---
That‚Äôs definitely weird
---
The killcam error isnt really new, you shouldve fall back before that kaid attempt to bash your shield.
---
wow great cosplay..
---
Nice
---
No worries man, I'm just a jackass lol

Good luck my friend

If you don't know, why respond?

Why?

thanks. always looking for more spots

Have you not traded ever?
---
 I got that awhile ago
---
Yeah... I was wondering. I would prefer that from how it sounds rather than the man look she has now.
---
Just use knife?
---
i know about the killcam bug.  
---
it was my assumption monty's shield while deployed cant be bashed to the side at all. so no need to fall back.
---
Actually it's the best place to go with real guns and military gear. No one will suspect a thing! Especially in America...
---
This happens occasionally. Usually it‚Äôs just your ping or the servers bugging out for a second and as a result your drone phases through the floor. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it unless it happens all the time.
---
I wished for Rainbow Six Vegas-like or classic Rainbow Six campaign.
---
Ok honestly, and I maybe the only one, but it would be super cool to have maps/gamemodes where the maps have non-combatants/civilians hiding/running around and if you accidentally shoot them...idk you lose points? Maybe lose the round if there‚Äôs enough? I feel like it would really heighten the reality and make it feel like an actual hostage situation or terrorist threat. After all, I never understood why I was diffusing gas bombs on maps that had already been evacuated. What‚Äôs the danger? Idk that‚Äôs just me though.

Been here since year 1 and heard rainbow recruits or power rangers a lot

Why. Just why. What the actual fuck.

I just started playing siege again on PC... I have all year 1 operators and base unlocked... wanna game?
---
Better than the current imo.
---
Lmg or ar?
---
Yes, bitching is a synonym of complaining so you just made my point for me. More people play siege for fun than to be competitive, and games are nowhere near on the decline, it's a huge industry.
---
not throw then their plan fails
---
I jave tracked down where you live and i am now standing outside your window.
---
Omg i literally just got the same black ice
---
We could just use recruit
---
That‚Äôs what we did and we won the game but I want to punish the people responsible, for we almost lost.

Same lol

I can fw that

thats literally the last achievement i need too, been playing since red crow lmao

Chose what you need to be successful in the objective you are defending or attacking.  Pick someone you like to try to fill that role regularly, but be flexible enough to pick up another op if your squad needs it.

My bad, they probably can control the amount of defenders and attackers they want to ban.

---
__It would be cool if they added the Siege logo hovering on top of it.__
---
best gun
---
Yea I think it's a bug when the canister knocks you down
---
I‚Äôd highly suggest you do. The game is pretty addicting (in the best way possible), and it‚Äôs constantly being updated to have better graphics and what not.
---
&gt;Hitreg is usually because your internet has run into an issue, not Ubisofts servers.
---
I have to asmit, server inconsistencies exist.
---
&gt;Spawnpeeking and runouts are part of the game. I personally hate them but they are a necessary evil for the defenders on many objectives.
---
Finally. Yes, they are a tactical, and are free kills for attackers. Defenders can't be kind Samaritans and let attackers just **walk in** to **their FORT**.
---
&gt;Why do people constantly complain about the one shot headshot thing? Noone complained about it until two months ago and it's a core part of siege, distinguishing it from other similar shooters.
---
Until Apex came out, we saw maybe 1 or 2 a year. Now we see 1 or 2 a week. People don't always understand that when a game has been going for over 4 years, changing the fundamentals leads to more harm than good. And in a cqb non-movement based shooters like siege, 1+shs doesn't make sense. And you can NEVER take luck out of the game.
---
&gt;Do not ever blame glitches on Ubisoft. They are not God, they cannot find every glitch in the game in three weeks. Blame the glitches on the one guy on YouTube who shares them as if people should use them constantly.
---
Tbh they need to test it more extensively. Testing should reveal glitches, and if they can't find them, then their testing is inefficient. If a common guy can find it, then a group of trained developers can definitely find flaws in their code.
---
&gt;Also your points about RFF are going to be invalidated by the mid season reinforcements because they will add squad RFF. They haven't added this yet because they were seeing how the general system worked and how people got around it.
---
Wait a second, squad rff is coming?

Oh cool shitpo-..

Don't worry,  yesterday I played against Pengu in the new ranked preview. We were couple Golda and silvers, them like 3 diamond buddies and Pengu with 1 random I think. We were pretty fucked up, but still we won 1 round and I killed Pengu, he left me 1hp :P
---
10/10 would let her walk all over me.
---
Which is why chalet was removed from PL close to when 3 round came in.
---
This new system is designed to reveal the true inconsistencies and flaws in maps and eventually take them in for rework. I'm positive something for chalet will be announced next season once they have enough data from 3RR.
---
Lol Australia could you even imagine someone livin upside down
---
Hell yeah this game is awesome,learning curve like any other but worth it.its toxic aswell funny and filled memes and I love it 10/10
---
I'd prefer that anyday.
---
When have I ever posted on The Donald? Can I have a link to my post? Also, what correlation is there between posting on a subreddit that has to do with politics and my comment replying to you calling someone a "fucking male supremacist"?

It's super good

Every comment here is going to be biased
---
Has anyone had issues with this and memory leaks in the core game

Last one is me rn in college PepeHands

Not anytime soon. They'll first release sets for ops that only got weapon skins back then. Then series 2 sets will release.

Don‚Äôt buy the bundles. Price drops for operators make the bundles not worth it
---
Greg.Dime
---
It just depends I suppose. But normally you know where people are pushing, so you can call out to teammates to watch. If you‚Äôre attacking, people may go off on their own and die one by one because they‚Äôre not sure where to push. While defending, it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôre at least defending an objective.
---
Greg.Shine
---
yeah, Man ubi if you‚Äôre listening this would be a better April Fools Mode! *The Unbalanced mode*  a random op on attack and defense is completely overpowered per game, These ops change per game.
---
|| test ||
---
Thanks for the reply. Is there a regular occurrence for operator deals or is it usually around big holidays?
---
Ohhh you mean not bomb?
---
When does phantom sight come out?
---
Hello I'm here to answer. Go into the flair menu and hit edit and pick some ops or add some text
---
Do you have a discord? Join the R6 discord and a bit can tell you all the prices of ops and the next time some drop in price
---
That‚Äôs not an Ubi problem though, that‚Äôs a Sony issue
---
My concern is that defense is much easier, so one team automatically gets an advantage randomly getting to defend first.
---
can you do multiple like he did though?
---
Ye
---
Oh sweet, will do. So would you say a long boost is worth or nah?
---
And what, just leave the game every time it comes up in queue?
---
Nah, I only play bomb.
---
Maybe if you farm every 3rd/4th day or every other day then maybe
---
Did you defend first?
---
Why
---
i agree
---
okay, i searched flair in the searched bar and followed the instructions it gave me, but i could only pick onw... Thanks! (imma go check it out)
---
Thanks dude.
---
Bad
---
Yea i dont know why recruit memes, acog memes, and tachanka memes have stuck around for so long. You could probably put the ‚Äúwhats in the canister‚Äù meme in that pool too. At this point its just annoying
---
The Lord never dies, as long as he's not nerfed, HE NEVER DIES!
---
-VeRy ORiGiNaL
---
because you're not changing from attack to defense constantly. Both sides play entirely differently (also attack has acogs while defense mostly does not) so having to change from one mindset to the other is insanely confusing and debilitating. Also, if changes need to be made to your attack or defense you dont have to wait a whole round to change it. You can just make the necessary changes right away. You say your concern is that if one team whens 3 defense rounds in a row then they only have to win 1 attack to win. Please explain to me how that is unfair
---
How many matches would you play on an average night?
---
(This is assuming booster) Not factoring in challenges etc you'll earn around 500 average per casual match (That is if you win 1 and lose 1 assuming a 1.00 Win/Loss ratio) So at a good pace you'll have about 3 matches an hour so that makes 1,500 Renowned an hour. So there is the basic maths for you to figure out how much you'd earn.
---
Greg.Sublime
---
Yea but after 3 rounds the roles switch and the advantage is to the other team so they should be able to get 3 rounds in or else they don't deserve the W
---
ü§îTurn it off in settings
---
Who won?
---
Cool that kind of gives me something to work with. So the gist of the boosters is pretty simple: if you play a lot, it's going to work out pretty well.
---

---
Greg.Lyme
---
A lot of it depends on the team around you. I‚Äôve had games where people just TK and throw so they can achieve the lowest rank. I‚Äôve had people leave games (happens a lot more in lower ranks because you‚Äôre bronze and who gives a shit). It seems like a reach but if you are solo queuing good luck carrying yourself out of bronze. Idk what good KD is but mine is around 1.2 which I would chalk up to be not too shabby.

Please don't check

Guys my cousin and I are getting this constantly on ps4  (connected to the same internet through lan cables) . It‚Äôs happening a lot like every other match! It usually happens right when we finish a ranked match! Is it happening to anyone else? Is there a fix for it?
---
...in this part of the country, localized entirely within a kitchen
---
That sucks
---
If I'm being honest, I was completely calm throughout the duration of the 1v5, and this was my first ace, but I was betting on them thinking I would stay near the IQ. Worked out in the end, I suppose...
---
I got my first black ice in a 2% alpha pack, was very hard
---
It's more balanced, yes. But, old one was more fun to play with.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they can‚Äôt. All the PS+ money goes to Sony, they‚Äôre not gonna let a game not need it for long

Recruit needs to be an option

Lion drone goes off, Thomas the Tank Engine theme plays, and here comes 5 speed Blitz on Performance enhancing drugs.
---
Not for me personally. The spawn killing and runouts as well as the lack of rotations for defense really made it un-enjoyable for me. This is why I‚Äôm excited for the Kanal rework as well because that map shares a lot of issues that old Hereford had and I‚Äôm glad they are looking into making it competitive.

And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so anti the new pro league set up. It has some merit. But I think for certain maps it will give one team an unfair advantage over the other team.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs Maui lmao
---
Even the ranks match...good one
---
Will try to ;)
---
I have literally been using Ash every chance I get! Obviously allowing veteran players get first dibs on characters. Been a great night of gaming so far
---
Wow I got r/woooosh‚Äôd
---
It makes sense, I just didn't see it as fair, so i don't know why people would do something (I) consider unfair by non-gameplay interactive means. 
---
E.g. I'll put a barbed wire here and there so I force the situation in my favor should YOU decide to initiate the interaction. By spawn-peeking, I saw it as the defenders forcing an advantage on the attackers with the attackers having to interact by lack of choice, or taking the long way. 
---
However if I applied that to others, it doesn't really make sense. And as another respondent pointed out, (if I interpreted it right) spawn-peeking is a double edged sword.
---
Sorry for the ramble, and thank you for replying.
---
That's because it isn't actually ranked yet. Once it's the real ranked mode I'm sure the toxicity will die down.
---
OOF
---
Yes , the editions got changed since 12th of Feb . you no longer get Legacy operators for free

Hey! R6 discord mod here, I really like this and was wondering if could get permission to add it as an emote to the server? (Should the admins allow it)

Feel free to use this anywhere you want as long as you give credit.

But I mean there are so many memes in r6 that there could be so many icons that they would have to change it every week to keep it fair and I don't mean to offend any one but some operators are less memorable then others *cough* Non Acog 3 armors *cough*

aw ok. thx
---
It's nothing you did wrong it's just how people are. They get impatient or upset that you are doing better. I usually play with a few friends so we dont get kicked but randos try all the time if one of us is left. The game is better if you find some people to play with even if it's just one to avoid this kind of nonsense. Heck if you happen to be on xbox let me know and you can play with my guys and me
---
any way we can get these as wallpapers? the title screens?
---
only luck

Imagine the BM possibilities...whoa!
---
Still better than me
---
Petition to make this the current subreddit icon
---
Rank based toxicity would explode. Horrible idea.
---
Easily the best r6 cosplay ever.
---
from the top (oh and all these are try hard things to do just fyi)
---
1) - this often is the best cover players will get as defenders to kill attackers, spawn peaks can reduce the enemy team at the very start which helps your team, and you might get lucky and take out a hard breacher. its aggravating to have it done to you but its also aggravating to defend from someone on a window who has most of the advantage.
---
2) - virgins play this game. this shit is trash and shitters fake it as skill to feel better.
---
3) - keyboards and mice offer many improvements over controllers, the least of which is improved precision and the ability to lean whenever you want
---
4) - this can be a viable strategy, running out on distracted defenders and using the outside of the map to ones advantage can be a very smart move to relocate yourself after an engagement and outmanoeuvre the other team
---
I guess its more of just me being one of those people who gotta tell it how it is and be honest with ourselves in hopes of getting others to know that self-reflection is a good thing, especially with honesty behind it.
---
I struggle with the team aspect, too. You're not alone on that one.

I have managed to do this throw very consistently, it is really powerful if some of yours having to rotate back from the harry potter towards attic (like Mute, Pulse), you can kill anyone by the plant spot.

It does say 'any SMG', so the confusion is valid. I tried doing a classic T Hunt with sledge's SMG and was disappointed when that didn't work.
---
Yeah I think it mainly happens at the lower ranks and people actually take the game more seriously at plat / diamond. Im currently gold 3
---
Or just put rocket boosters on it with maybe 2-3 uses per match
---
Source? According to each news article, Ubisoft told that
---
I'm just hoping to catch a woooosh here

Well obviously seige is a PvP game not a PvE focused game unlike some zombie games that design the game around zombies but outbreak was good for a PvP focused game

In System 32

I‚Äôd agree with that.

Yes but you are comparing the game mode to other games like that. Yeah it was okay for a game that focuses on PvP but Im not comparing outbreak to a PvP game Im comparing it to other games like the mode because that is the only valid comparison that can be made. And if you conpare it like that it was mediocre at best.

And all this hate comes from solo roamers who never work with their team or another roamer (because the others one could get a kill...).

They basicly complain all the time about their own counter, because they can't just rush into his front and spray him down.

if it's a cheating ban it was triggered by battleye. maybe you had some sketchy shit running in the background idk

Bring secure back. Bomb only people have had the option to be bomb only since forever. Pro league only maps is a dumb idea too. You think you play the same maps now just imagine how bad it will be when there are six less of them
---
No, he isn't. Blitz is still a shield operator who can sprint at you while covering 2/3 of his body, including his head. He's not situational, he's fundamentally broken.

FINALLY ! I always wishd for a shooting range in R6 BUT this is 1000x better!!!

For 2 it‚Äôs not going to happen, because nobody wants to join games in progress so everyone would opt out, meaning that in the games where someone does leave the match will stay 4v5 and you‚Äôll never get anyone else to join

It wasn‚Äôt that long time ago..

Why didn‚Äôt you ban you muppet - clash probably

I don't have enough experience to call myself good at this though.

as far as hackers go there are probably about 10 people in total that hack out of the entire player base. the thing is their accounts get banned every time they use then so they just buy more cracked accounts online for a dollar each

Np, BTW if you wanna try, try it and see how it goes

Your data on most games is stored on the cloud. So, even if you loose the ability to play the game, your shite is stored. Should work for most any game.

It‚Äôs a joke have you seen the posts with claymores and deplorable shields and the title is ‚Äúonly 90‚Äôs kids remember‚Äù kinda just a fun joke

thats where rule 3 comes in. That person who left will either have to wait the 10 mins (granted he opted out) or be forced to join an ongoing game. 
---
I believe the people who both opt out of ongoing games but still ragequit will have to choose between sticking a game out or joining an ongoing but thats just me
---
Yeah, that's the other thing I've noticed. It seems like people focus on killing each other instead of planting or taking the hostage for example. You can win the round by planting or grabbing the hostage as well. How many rounds have I lost to people not planting..
---
Oh shit I‚Äôm a retard, sorry
---
Someone else tries this: We clutch the round
---
I try this: They destroy the trap and team kill me
---
You didn‚Äôt get banned for that reason.

How are we supposed to tell where you‚Äôre from if you get custom plates though. From 60 county

It‚Äôs good but bland. The map layout and everything is fine. They kinda went the opposite direction with outback and threw way too much shit in the map

Dude you don‚Äôt need to ask. If you want to stream do it. If you‚Äôre bad you will get some shit but at the same time it may be refreshing for newer players to see someone who isn‚Äôt god tier playing too. If you love the game and want to stream do it.
---
Thanks. I hate it.
---
I really like the infinite rotation
---
Lmao üñ•
---
It gives more variety to the game. All in all it‚Äôs a good thing (removing secure area is not).
---
Inb4 downvotes but the tachanka joke is old
---
- Gridlock is underpowered. Nomad is 99% btter f9r the same role.
---
- Mute is pretty balanced imo
---
- Jackal i wouldnt consider him OP. But the fact that there is no counter to his gadget (except cavs silent step) is little broken.
---
Another thing they could do rather than restrict who can play with who is make the higher ranks carry more weight, so a diamond with 4 coppers would play mid-low plat at the lowest

Uhh you might want to censor that username...

Quite possible, but currently how they do it doesn't work whatsoever, I understand that whatever they do people can make smurfs, but I wound rather make them go through a pay wall than just hooking up a random copper, anything that would make their life even a tiny bit harder would be fine with me
---
I would LOVE for clash to be on attack

The dumbest spots always get ya

I mean,he was shit even at the start of the game,and he still can't get his rework bc of "HaHa LoRd TaChAnKa OmG I aM So FuNnY"

A warden watch animation would be cool too
---
that's it
---
Yes, brings in the worst people. Trolls and hackers. Ruins it for new players actually trying the game out.

I opened a window once with a clearly visible mozzie and i shot him so many times in the head but nothing happened
---

---
You posted Ravenshield with the Vegas games...Sad!
---
You can't count on the kill cams to show what the enemy can see, that are broken at the moment so even though it looked like he completely missed you, he would have shot your head if seen from live gameplay, unfortunately they have been for a while lol
---
The boarded window
---
Wanted Sneeki breeki, got cheeki breeki
---
It would lead to everyone watching angles by abusing the camera's perspective like in third person PUBG so this would probably be horrible to play especially for attackers.

Not the gameplay, but the cosmetics tho...

I've been playing the R6 games since the first iteration and the outbreak game mode felt like a slap in the face to the heart of what it was.

Outbreak was almost like totally new IP that was presented to Ubi and they decided to shoehorn it into Siege somehow.

I guess we have [Ready or Not](https://reddit.com/r/readyornotgame) to fill that void.

Don't know how genius and advanced your tactical thinking is but on 1v1 and 2v2 situations this spot is most dangerous place on bombsite, forcing you to either keep your position all time long or run to the closest cover, risking being shot in the back. In case like this on video that Valk could freely throw Nitro from floor 1 I assume it's late game scenario of 3v2/2v2/etc, therefore defenders have control of floor 1 - in this particular case this spot is twice as  dangerous cause defenders can just clear floor 0 and kill attackers from trapdoor. It's very situational spot (let's say - enemy have Mira on target without laundry rotation hole and smoke/other C4 defenders are nowhere close to the target) but it's still worst place to plant I can think of, can be only good in case of heavy attackers domination, like 5vs2, forced by timer to plant with sacrifice of one teammate.
---
i know but the background looks or is the banning screen
---

Claymores have been disabled for a while now.

They do care in casual. If someone doesn't like what you are doing or if you are taking too long to clutch you get kicked immediately.
---
Yeah I did
---
He probably didn't. Also look at both of our names. (r6best, and then r6\_is\_broken)
---
we you game sharing with someone else? therefore you would have gotten ps plus from them as well as their games
---
Don't have to be so rude
---
I always do that for all games. If the queue is taking long I restart the queue. I haven't been able to queue newcomers since I've started playing the game.

Shields shouldn't be one hit kill

That's a nighmare against blitz in closer quarters

And overall good shield players

G2 qualified for the Raleigh Major already by winning six invitational. The prize pool for this event is only 50k and they have their major spot lined up, so theres no reason for them to be there.

Hmm.... yeh I think I‚Äòd be fine and basically just fine when it effects them too
---
Or you think that‚Äòd be a problem?
---
No account on my ps4 had ps plus. Other users haven't need ps plus aswell until today. I think it's because of the free weekend
---
If it makes you feel any better, my entire team was killed from windows, and finka was the only one actually inside. I would have gone earlier, but I wanted them all to be inside so I could grab their attention w/ finka.
---
I‚Äôd prefer if it hides the skull that marks where a teammate died.  
---
That would punish bad communications in a team as you‚Äôd need to call where you were killed from even more so than you do now.

Ahhhhhhhhh

And the keyboard controls on the bottom lol
---
AK 12 shreds,  enjoy!
---
Well i haven't played in like 5 months. Just came back and i got autofilled with lion. So yeah. You see where i'm coming? 
---
I thought it is a bug because i can still select it, but hey it's ubisoft. Should have guessed. 
---
If you ask me lion should be removed from the game.

Its not "vote to kick" its "was it intentional". I suppose when you press "yes" it goes on their permanent record, or something, it doesn't kick them. I also think it determines whether or not RFF activates

Firstly, welcome to siege. This community can be pathetic at times, but you'll find some remarkable people that can become long term friends and IRL buddies (like my current squad).
---
&gt;1) Who‚Äôs brilliant fucking idea was there to include friendly fire? I understand they probably want it to be more realistic, but friendly fire in an online gaming community which normally consists of 12 year olds, braindead spastics, and try hards really wasn‚Äôt a good idea. Especially considering this game is competitive. 
---
FF is necessary in a 5v5 tactical CQB. You know Fuze and Ash? These 2 are absolute monsters in the game. If you disable FF, that Fuze will shoot **15** grenades into the room while Ash, a 3 speed speed demon runs in unhindered, taking 0 damage, slaughtering everybody on defense. It makes for ever worse of a cancerous play.
---
They are adding a lot of anti friendly fire toxicity means this year, with the first 2 phases already rolled out. You can decide whether the person killed you intentionally or accidentally. They are also adding squad based friendly fire damage number soon, so it should become less of a problem.
---
&gt;2) On top of the friendly fire system, there a vote to kick system. Another fucking horrible idea. There‚Äôd probably be much less use for a vote to kick system if friendly fire wasn‚Äôt a thing. I struggle to finish a game because I‚Äôm new. Players will vote to kick me because I‚Äôm obviously a noob, who has little to no knowledge of any map or character. I‚Äôve been kicked a few times already. It‚Äôs a joke. Even experienced players who make mistakes get kicked. The newcomer playlist seems empty to me also, I can‚Äôt find a game in it, so I have to search for a casual match. You‚Äôd think for a fucking *CASUAL* match people wouldn‚Äôt get upset, but sure hey it‚Äôs online gaming init. 
---
Kick system has long been asked for removal. Ubi doesn't listen. I've faced that for my 100 levels before going ranked full time, where there's no kick system. Ranked is thankfully noticeably more mature.
---
&gt;3) People on my team who act the fucking idiot on purpose is another issue. Like I‚Äôm sorry Mr XxXPussYsLayerzYx  but DID YOU REALLY HAVE TO RUN OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, GET YOUR POSITION REVEALED TO THE ATTACKERS, AND GET RINCED EVERY TIME? It says in big red lighting that your position is revealed, so why do it? And if it failed the first time, why did you try it two more times? 
---
Practice. I've run out and done what looks like bullsh*t countless times in casual before finally perfecting it. You'll learn by failing, so they just keep trying until they perfect it.
---
&gt;4) I‚Äôve received two hate messages so far. Nice. 
---
That's just the tip of the iceberg. Siege won the "better with friends" award, and rightly so, since it is a game that HAS to be played with friends to enjoy it to it's fullest potential. Trust me, stick around a while as you get past the toxicity, and you'll make some valuable friends.
---
I've seen and felt worse, and after close to 500 hours, I now have a friend who I met when he was 40 levels below me and we learnt the game together, and we literally call ourselves brothers. This game creates wonderful moments that you chreish. It's just the initial breaking the ice of toxicity phase that you have to get through.
---
I hope you stay. New guys are always welcome, and if you are on the south east Asian server, do join in.

Hello ActivateWindows1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/by90kb/freeze/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
There's a rule for this?
---
Kinda dumb
---
Indeed I do.
---
Causes massive lags though, but yes, I do use it.
---
Yep. As my opinion is correct and you can‚Äôt disagree I will state that the following maps need removing from ranked to be ‚Äòreworked‚Äô (or even reworked again): 
---
- Fortress 
---
- The new Hereford 
---
- Theme park (already getting reworked)
---
- Old Kafe (has been reworked)
---
Maps that aren‚Äôt that balanced but aren‚Äôt awful either:
---
-outback 
---
-villa 
---
-Skyscraper 
---
:)
---
I think a lot of maps have attacker/defender oriented sites but they end up blancing each other out. Id just want them to remove Hereford
---
That‚Äôs /nine fucking seconds/ of ping
---
Np
---
I've played a good amount of casual games. As my title says, I can see why people don't believe me when I say queues are long. 
---
I play Rocket league competitively and I understand long queues and when to reset them. The issue is that I've done this multiple times over a month without any success.
---
Yes, I despise Hereford

Before making statements like that you should try and look at things from another perspective. I have some friends who are from South Africa and they don't have servers so they have to play with 150ms-200ms and it's not fun, I also know some people from the Emirates who suffer from the issue but I'm not condoning ping abusing it's just that sometimes there's nothing that can be done to help it
---
Yeah, it's been shown before but no biggie showing it again bc no everyone sees it the first time shown. 
---
Have an upvote for spreading knowledge!

And now I can proudly say I main Mr. Krabs.

It's like getting a kill with a Twitch drone, or Bandit's shock wire. Rare, but when it happens, the lobby goes crazy.

Can we upvote this to the top of the sub please? I feel like this is very fitting and deserves more upvotes.
---
Attempting to plant there while you are so far behind that the defenders control the first floor is probably bad, but in most cases where you are planting, you are either desperate and just need to get it off (dying seconds of the round), or you have a strong lead. In the first case, sure the spot is a bit risky when the enemies outnumber you and control the main room/meeting hall area, but in that case most spots are risky, and you are generally at a disadvantage. If you control first floor, hatch makes it so that miras/other people sitting in the middle room watching into objective have a pretty hard time landing a c4, and also provides great cover for the only flank route that has vision there, which is the stairs. Given even a reasonable take a main/meeting, its very hard to deny that plant, and very easy to defend due to stairs and hatch control.
---
Chalet needs to be removed as well. Horrible map. It‚Äôs so defender friendly. It doesn‚Äôt matter where you break in on the map, somebody knows where you are because of how small the map is.
---
Not in this case but it could be easier to mask aim hacks with it.

Attachments are not based on opinion:

The only ones you should use are;

Red dot, suppressor and angled grip or you are not a part of  Red-dot gang

You‚Äôd be surprised... I have a burning hatred for skyscraper and people think I‚Äôm retarded, I probably have -10000 karma on this sub because everyone makes me angry, I have to wait 10 minutes beetween giving comments too

This isn‚Äôt a repost.

Tbh I‚Äôm really on the fence with skyscraper because there is only one viable objective , office is hard to defend and the other objects are ass
---
Mr Krabs didnt voice Maestro
---
Meatball man voiced mr krabs
---
Yea I kno about that
---
Its the game telling you never to put a mira there
---
Dude, what you are saying are logical but not practical in terms of effectiveness. Ofc you can run out to protect the obj. But when there is no thatcher attackers are just a lot weaker. If you can successfully use c4 to hold the garage door on chalet, then don't hesitate to worry about anyone. But no one is gonna try to do some weird strat, or do cross play when defenders most likely have one or two roamers.
---
What? There's also that on some sites/maps different hard breachers are much more annoying. Plus banning Thatcher means you just can't deal with Kaid. You don't want to just make it so only one side has any hope of winning. You want to bring the balance of the sites closer to a 50/50, not further.

Oh god it‚Äôs PC as well
---
When does E3 2019 start?
---
I once got a kill with ash‚Äôs grenade. no, not the explosion, the actual grenade hitting someone
---
No, then it would just be picked 100% of the time, as you have the benefit of the zoom while still being good at close range. 
---
It would just be too good on a sight for people to have, especially defenders.
---
Don‚Äôt look at me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm not OP
---
That, is a very good point.
---
Question is, how do you get more than 1 main?
---
Expect them to show up at your house tonight and kill your dog.
---
But now when they bring thatcher to open the wall it gets destroyed easily :(
---
Damn,  I hope it does so that I dont have to rebuy all my ops and lose my levels skins etc.
---
Lol should've gone for the 3 speed
---
lesion
---
He also voice Lt. Hank Anderson from Detroit: Become Human.
---
This sounds like they're being deliberately vague so that they could add it if they find a way to help it benefiting themselves
---
I have black ice bundle on console account and 12 black ice on PC ones. I only asked once something like this and was to someone that had glacier, he was like: "yes, for 350$". Meh, I think i can still flex with my Six Invitational skin. :0
---
True, but if they break the wall, smoke, then go to plant... it‚Äôs amazing for that too.
---
Notice the attachments and guns their holding
---
I knew Clancy Brown was in Siege because I overheard someone say it, but I always thought he fitted the role of Blackbeard more.
---
In which rank planting defuser is act of desperation? On every single tournament I have played (not many of these tho) planting defuser was priority, right after entry frag or roamer catch. Planting defuser places you in very comfortable situation, forcing defenders to rush quickly or regroup and perform risky retake on last seconds. I would even say that sacrificing one attacker for plant is good deal, catch here is fact that in this particular spot planting is barely possible with good defenders. You also have to remember that Oregon + basement = Smoke that is hard to deal on this bombsite, especially on dead-end like this.
---
Sorry idk what happened to the audio, shadowplay said fuck you apparently
---
This even works for the sound a gun makes.

lmao at her hanging on to his back one handing the R4C
---
Thank goodness for the mute jammer located somewhere near the windshield, otherwise the glass would be screwed
---
Thanks for providing great support. See ya
---
I wonder how much they paid him.
---
Attackers have breaching charges and defenders have so many cameras or traps to watch their back.
---
This would be unneeded.
---
Kapkan
---
*bonk*
---
its definitely possible. i‚Äôd say if they DID do it it would be one of those limited time events, and if it goes well they would make a way to play cross platform permanently. the only problem is that it would still be very unfair for console players
---
I play on console, so I don't know about any differences between platforms and that could potentially be what's happening here 
---
That said, I personally recommended staying in normal casual as the newcomers playlist is a haven for people that make new accounts to cheat the matchmaking.
---
I agree, buck, Frost, and Valkyrie are some of my favorites
---
Wait... h--how did they not hear it? or see it? or possibly not understand what was gonna happen next?
---
Well I used to be like that.... Sometimes 4 squads just dont want randoms, thats casual for you
---
I think June 8 through June 13, Ubisofts panel is on June 10
---
Settings then audio then language and you can choose if you want subtitles as well
---
I would do that, but there isn‚Äôt a option for Chinese on PS4.
---
All this needed was a slide jump
---
oh yea I forgot

Are your cables plugged into the graphics card and not the motherboard??
---
I discovered that the charm is available by accident cause my friend told me! Why you don't make posts in official Twitter siege page? You always make tweets about majot / pro league / invitational charms but not "minors". WHY?!

Can you tell me the exact name of the gpu?

The game is free atm, so they use new account to test their hacks

Stop adding shields instead.

Rainbow six: Glitch
---
This season we have a new oper- I mean glitch. This glitch is very unique and totally not the same oper- I mean glitch we have had with some minor changes.
---
Pretty sure Ash was trying to plant
---
Newcomer playlist is basically just more practice for the highly skilled and hackers. It's pathetic
---
Placing them after drone phase helps too

A target looking up or down is the easiest to surprise ;D

Not this time, Mr. Kree. You'll be coming with us now.

I mean, kinda I suppose, not resemblances tho
---
Looks pretty lit
---
It's meant as a joke relax
---
I don't mean in apperance i mean as in what they can do, but i get how people can see how i meant appearance...fair game

Get this spook bitch the mission impossible theme

It sounds fucking terrifying

Well we DONT hate you! Because we are a friendly community

He protecc, by attacc

The hitboxes.... f them, how many times did I hit that headshot but nooo, I hit his hand instead...
---
now back in my day I was able to play the game without raging. those days were good
---
the machinepistol she can equip, most people use shottgun though
---
There are other, more  pressing things.
---
Yeah there‚Äôs still hackers that quietly use walls, and they‚Äôre more common
---
Op is hot*
---
I'm not sure since i've never played her, but usually you can press "B" on guns to change the shooting style (i.e. full-auto, burst, semi-auto)
---
I have a few major gripes like matchmaking and the community in general but a minor gripe is how laggy the menus are on console
---
That's just map knowledge, idk what you're talking about...
---
Its June 11th I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Can someone make the Unicorn Tachanka reddit guy?
---
What about something basic like if an operator had a helmet, they only take 50 damage for head shots?
---
I know youre not OP lol
---
I already did
---
Make sure she never uses a mic to randoms.
---
Unless you want virgin 30 year olds to teamkill her for being female and make constant sexual comments.
---
I mean, both are true.
---
I try to tell people dont let the learning curve or the player base discourage you from this game. It has its quirks and faults but at its core it is a very solid FPS with extended potential. I learned early on to just laugh that stuff off and requeue, dont let one or two games ruin it for you.
---
Niet
---
I always do lol, how do you see anything with 1x sights? I'm on Xbox btw
---
It depends on what weapon you have and how far away you are. It‚Äôs completely possible to down someone with a headshot from far enough away.
---
No one cares fuck off. You played with a cheater and won points they just took away the points you won unfairly.
---
More like aim assist
---
i see nothing wrong on that screenshot
---
Looks like lag to me
---
**Guy with bell peppers in his mouth** : I‚Äôm not asking you why you‚Äôre going through my hotel with guns and explosives!!!
---
June 11th
---
They can breach everything EXCEPT reinforced walls.  
---
Castle uses bulletproofs barricades (unlike regular wooden ones). They can be destroyed by explosives though. You can also punch them but it takes a long time (12 punches)
---
Every ability is op if you describe it like that. People instantly go down on a frost mat, shoot through walls next to a mirror for easy kills, etc. The point is to play around the new things, people would have to learn to play around sounds, I think it'd be fairly good overall
---
No thanks
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs based off of
---
So Ash and Sledge can break through Castle‚Äôs walls?
---
they can only destroy wood, no metal, and castle is a better barricade that needs 12 (i think) meeles to destroy
---
Unless he chose to play with a cheater he shouldnt get penalized for it are you fucking retarded

Too much stim juice.

I'm working on it :)
---
Bible in hand luigi
---
Dammit Nate!
---
I can totally see that.  I'm always aiming for the head because it's easier to put an enemy down that way.  I understand that it may not be realistic for a 9mm to instantly kill a person with a helmet from maybe 50 meters away but for game play purposes and to be less random, that is to be expected.
---
Welcome to 2017.
---
two different you meant
---
Woah I've had a few matches against you
---
No, Ubisoft replaced her breaching charges for flashbangs. And breaching walls with trapped defenders is very unreliable.
---
The good ol' one shot cum shot.  üí¶
---
Fair point but I guess that‚Äòs pretty hard to implement....
---
And the suppressor is almost unplayed so i was just thinking about making it just a little more interesting since there are not a lot of other aspects to buff it without unbalancing it!
---
I got fed up with it in CS:GO, so I installed some hacks so whenever there was a hacker on the other team I could turn them on and even the odds. Only difference is that I wouldn't use them without anyone on the other team using some.
---
Ernie prepared to commit a hate crime
---
Sure it isn't tactical, but it's TactiCOOL.
---
plane, favela and yacht
---
Ha my bad, I thought they replaced the breaching charges for flashbangs. Turns out it's the claymore.
---
Yes.
---
Unless you're high plat-diamond I don't see why you would possibly care about losing one rank because you won a game unfairly. Gold doesn't matter, all ranks before the highest 2 or 3 are super volatile anyway.
---
I got a bandit wire kill a couple months ago
---
In casual, 5 stack with my buddies
---
One attacker left, he hurdles a window right next to me and steps on it
---
We lost our collective shit
---
And then they defend 3 times genius.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Oh wait did they change Yokais thing that if you ping enemy with it it gets revealed for couple seconds therefore enemy‚Äôs can shoot it ?
---
Those happen far more often than Maestro or Bandit
---
Really? Yacht? That's worse than tower. It has no vertical play whatsoever, imbalanced sites, and stupid snow effects. That's why it never made it back to ranked.
---
New Hereford needs a rework, yes. But if it is to be replaced, it must be replaced by a outback. According to Interro, outback is ready for PL, and if it is balanced enough for PL, it is good enough for ranked.
---
CHA-CHA *Real smooth*
---
The game isn‚Äôt being shit. You are a being shit cuz ur gold 3 LMAO ur fucking trash kid get off the game
---
It‚Äôs literally like one game, and he isn‚Äôt even plat/diamond... I don‚Äôt get the fuss lol probably 4-0 a team with a Clash/Invisible exploit without noticing
---
Maestro voiced Hank! ü§Ø
---
You played with a cheater, knowingly or otherwise. You wouldn't complain if you gained points by being on the other team of that match.
---
First actually good con argument....
---
But not communicating is already punished AF
---
I don‚Äòt think thats reason enough to not think about implementing it tbh
---
Says the doc main XD

---
imagine caring so much about your rank that you‚Äôll pay someone to cheat just to bring you up until you eventually fall back down into the rank you belong
---
No its not
---
You completely disregarded the case where I said you have a slight advantage and plant. I claimed it is good for that scenario, not the one where you are in a desperate state. I agree that with a disadvantage it is hard to defend there, but wirh top floor control it is near impossible to retake for defenders.
---
*laughs in zofia*
---
Back it up
---
What round was it? If it was early in the first round then that‚Äôs probably why
---
Thank you mate, I'll watch for it!

... It's sad I know this sorta works. That Welcome Mat's too far close to the wall to survive, but I have legitimately used a similar setup on Border and succeeded. I was gobsmacked at it actually working. People assume the Exothermic Charge will clear the way in that small a gap.

Do I have to claim the drop or is it something that will just appear in my inventory? Just asking because some games like gta cash drops had to press a button that popped up on screen fir a few seconds to claim the drop an others work how the siege pro league drops usually do?

You'll receive a notification on Twitch and the charm will just appear in your inventory. You just need to watch, nothing more.

Thank you! Everyone I talk to in game complains about it like children. I think it‚Äôs a great idea

Unfortunately, siege is a toxic place and it's worse for female gamers. I think some pro female gamers made a YouTube video on these issues

Yeah, all of my ranked games have had over 150 ping for everyone in game. Casual has seemed fine, though?

frite is french for fry so i guess?

At this point i have given up on pvp games ur better off getting destiny 2

It is so much less buggy u can play with ur gf and u don‚Äôt have to deal with the toxic spawn peeking hacking asshats

I think it was King George had the idea of suppressors removing the kill cam so you don't know where they killed you from
---
It‚Äôs the feel man. The R4C was never statistically god like, yet the weapon was because it felt so good to use.
---
The rank and mmr dont match up
---

---
Nice. Xbox gang gang
---
If anyone I would bet it would be mozzie

Nice.
---
It‚Äôs the feel man. The F2 isn‚Äôt the best gun on attack stat wise yet when you play with it you know it‚Äôs extremely good because it feels so easy and good to use
---
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, bringing back Hereford is cool and all, but old Hereford should never replace new Hereford. Old Hereford is the inferior map in every way, it is fucking awful. If ubisoft has enough additional space to waste on that shitty map, then fuck it sure. If not then I don‚Äôt want it back.
---
Oh fuck not the femboy

Not just hipfire though, just all round a great weapon
---
Mm span peaks

No problem. :)
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Lmao
---
Clearly it will never be riced since it's been an issue for a LONG time
---
That's because in siege firerate is king, nothing else matters if the gun shoots fast enough and the recoil isn't like the scorpion.
---
That is an amazing charm lmao
---
probably
---
That's why I posted this because it's just getting ridiculous

That is a massive help. Also helps that it has an insane ADS time and a huge mag to help with the very low recoil

---
I was simply stating my opinion on the new update dumbass, I don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs fucking sympathy. I was fucking pissed off about the update and it was all new to me, I‚Äôve been team killing since 2016 it‚Äôs hard to change your ways when you‚Äôve been doing it for 3 years. Go fuck yourself nigger.
---
I‚Äôm guessing you mean on defence?!
---
I‚Äôd say no. Any gun becomes really good with an ACOG and if a two speed can run around challenging players while being fairly mobile, it would be horrible. 
---
There was a time where bandit and J√§ger had ACOGs and they were so strong on them weapons due to being a 3 speed
---
calories? that would be rook
---
They Clashed them because people found a way to do the glitch again.
---
I know its hard to find a group but if you use LFGs often enough you‚Äôll meet some cool people.
---
Not just you, Deployable shields need a patch to fix
---
It's only a visual bug on the kill cam that's all.
---
i had a team stomping that ended up 4-0ing one game. the guy in the final kill cam pulled out his mirror and face checked the enemy who just emptied their entire mag into the mirror. it covers an okay portion of your body lmao
---
Just FYI, I know the C7E is a longer fun but it actually performs better than the smg in CQB
---
Deployable shields are disabled until the new season launches because of an anti-headshot glitch that was in the game a few weeks ago. Claymores and Clash are also disabled due to an invisibility glitch with the claymore and a glitch where you could shoot through Clash's shield as Clash. Supposedly, they will all be back when the new season launches which is rumored to be this up coming week
---
Your max mmr happened during placements, max rank is after placements.
---
C7E is better
---
Seem legit
---
Nope, not one bit.
---
You must be sharing your account with someone who do has ps plus. It‚Äôs required for online multiplayer. No exceptions.

Developing a good single player costs massive amounts of resources while only providing a small number of enjoyable hours to the player. A good multiplayer mode on the other hand can keep players active everyday for years...
---
Thats quite an easy decision if you are Ubisoft.
---
Fuck, just gimme Bartlett üòë

Hello a-piece-of-bacon, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bydy8d/anyone_know_the_release_date_of_phantom_sight/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Yeah in the beginning everyone could hear every voiceline but that was not good for the game as it gave away your position at random times so they removed this feature

i always thought they took it out since it‚Äôs a school. figured it was too touchy of a subject now a days so they just took it out

Straight up executed

Holy shit
---
acog jokes aren't funny anymore
---
Can confirm. Delicious.
---
So headshots aren't actually a one hit kill. They do approx. 14x damage. So firing a shot through a wall sometimes causes enough damage dropoff to cause an injure upon a headshot instead of instant death. (I find this happens most oftenly with ela's gunning at a 3 armour through walls since her smg does such low damage per shot.)
---
That‚Äôs your opinion if you don‚Äôt like acog jokes
