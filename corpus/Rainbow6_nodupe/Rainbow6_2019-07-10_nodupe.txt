never said I didn't give callouts, it's just way harder to since no one wants to communicate
---
---
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this clip... at all... it‚Äôs actually 100% normal
---
I play Lesion the most on defense. I would never claim I‚Äôm ‚Äúgreat‚Äù with any ops, but I have had a ton of fun and gotten some great aces with Lesion because his kit is so low risk/high reward. 
---

---
-I like to spread my Gu‚Äôs out. There‚Äôs a better chance you‚Äôll catch people that way, and after one person gets hit they tend to watch out for them more so they get less effective the more you put them together. 
---
-stairs are super useful places to put the mines. Not only are they a choke point from both sides, but they can slow rotations as well, which could be critical in the late game. 
---
-knowing how to place the Gu is tricky. My advice is this: place them where a lot of paths converge. It‚Äôs better to place a Gu where there are two doorways and a window than just inside a single doorway. Try to place them in spots that no matter where the enemy comes out from they will have to step on the Gu. 
---
-if you‚Äôre placing them in the hallway, try to space them out maybe 4m apart, just off center. That way the enemy can advance, but will have to take it slow, and many still fall for the same trick a second time. 
---
-if you can kill the person with the defuser, you can use the Gu to keep it guarded. Space the mines out every couple feet, with one or two directly on top of it. Lesion is one of, if not the best, ops for monopolizing an enemy defuser. 
---
-learn to control the recoil on his SMG, not that there is much to begin with. It‚Äôs an absolute laser but once you get the feel for it. I‚Äôve gotten some seriously nutty long range kills with it. You‚Äôre going to want to use that because the Six12 is... less than stellar 
---
-try to stay alive. I know it can be tempting to rush an enemy when they step on a mine, but good players will expect that. You know where they are. They aren‚Äôt going anywhere. It‚Äôs better to hang back and strike 15 seconds later than rush and die to a group of 3. Especially because Lesion is useless if he dies 30 seconds into the round with 2 Gu‚Äôs down. 
---
-develop a playstyle. Lesion, being a 2/2 op, has a lot of options about how he can be played. He‚Äôs sturdy enough to anchor in a pinch if need be, but quiet and fast enough to roam. I, personally, like to roam. I suck at holding an angle and winning a gunfight against enemies who know I‚Äôm there and have better guns. I like to roam with Lesion, and depending on the map I roam pretty deep. It‚Äôs all about knowing how the enemy will enter and attack. Theme Park? I know the enemy will likely breach the trains, and so I don‚Äôt need to roam very far. Fortress? I know there are several ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù that people will breach, so I like to roam out farther to get myself closer to each one, and then rotate and attack from there. 
---
That‚Äôs about all I can think of without getting into map specifics and whatnot. I hope you enjoy Lesion, he‚Äôs super fun to play. If you can get really good with him he will be an incredible asset to whatever strat your team decides to go with.
---
hahahahaha
---
it's okay to be wrong
---
For the smg12 you need slo-mo vision and an 8 meter horizontal mousepad
---
cake day
---
I don't understand why people don't just stick to controller or just move to PC if they want to mkb so bad.
---
This is the equivalent of twinking in dark souls, your opponent just has no chance against you
---
I meant the way he used Clash. Like whenever I go to a hallway, lets say 90 in Villa, Clash just pops up. Then I try and sprint towards her while she just shocks me to melee her. Then a different person just pops up from behind her and fucks me up. Cus Im sprinting I can't ads and shit.
---
solo queue gold is ez lulw
---
Sensitivity in most games is unable to be lowered further than the in game settings allow, therefor you are unable to lower your sensitivity beyond a certain point. You are also lowering and raising it in greater intervals than if you had lower DPI, you are unable to micro-adjust your sensitivity and by extension your aim. More inaccurate flicks and inability to make very minute movements with your mouse. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Now granted Siege has the ability to go into the .ini files and change the sensitivity multiplier so it doesn't ever truly matter as you can offset how much 1 sensitivity equals in game via the .ini but in general. High DPI is bad because you don't get as accurate sensitivity settings as you could if you played with lower DPI and as a result your aim isn't as refined.
---
Clash glitches are what ruins this game
---
What‚Äôs wrong buddy?
---
&gt;This is our next step towards sanctioning players that knowingly and deliberately take advantage of exploits to the detriment of the overall match.
---
Good.
---
You are the type of players I hate, you know it wasn‚Äôt but you still vote intentional
---
Good point, but I haven‚Äôt had much problems with a high sensitivity, meaning that to me, I am accurate enough. I might try going lower but I just really don‚Äôt like low sensitivity.  I think it really comes down to personal preference.
---
Justice is served.

EU I guess as I‚Äôm in the UK
---
Thank god the devs are finally issuing bans for glitches that are breaking the game even if they dont use 3rd party software.
---
clash herself does not though, ubi just does not put enough people on the problem
---
Blah blah comfort bans blah blah.
---
Whats the exploit???
---
Smoke and Fuze are innocent!
---
There's gonna be a lot of cry babies saying it's unfair, mark my words
---
Clash needs a big rework then
---
This has some ‚ÄòFar Side‚Äô vibes. üëç
---
yea exactly
---
Now, ban the people who used the IQ/Clash/Fuze/Deployable shield. Will be fun
---
Spam some shit in chat, servers can‚Äôt handle it, match lags out
---
There's a new Clash glitch!!
---
I might be biased because I play maestro a lot but his cameras are bulletproof, weaponized for annoyance and taking out drones, and can be planted on walls or ground for best vision. Plus an amazing loadout
---
Spam chat with symbols really fast which somehow causes the game to lag.
---
IIRC people could spam a symbol, similar to ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know which one) and it would lag the game and crash some I think.
---
Really, how? If I'm on site with defuser holding square just makes me start planting
---
Nope I wanted the skin
---
It‚Äôs him. It‚Äôs the chosen fuze!
---
What about banning ddosers???
---
It‚Äôs just for this year
---
this is kinda your fault as a game shouldn't lag/break wiht putting a few symbols in like &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
---
First of all, There is no evidence of RAPE. Tge drugging and robbing part is probably true, but stop assuming rape. and wtf do you mean "nickis support for pedophilia is BS"?. Nicki minaj collabed with tekashi 69 (i think it was even after the whole pedophilia case). But more importantly her brother raped his step daughter (who was 11) and Nicki Minaj paid his bail (which i think was 500k iirc)
---
What is this advanced drone deployment?
---
I forgot to take a video of it happening but I do have a picture and/or the name of players who abused it. What should I do?
---
people spammed &lt; in chat
---
When you have coffee and socks
---
Lol yeah csgo team kills count, as MINUS ONE KILL!
---
I agree.
---
1. The situation with Hereford will consider newcomers
---
2. I preferred the original
---
3. They could keep new Hereford and just rename it like "Hereford museum" or something
---
Yea I‚Äôll believe when I see it. You kidding me just like how you said you ‚Äú fixed the glitches ‚Äú also had failsafes and that crap didn‚Äôt work. You guys are going to the laughing stock of the gaming world.
---
Is this a new thing? I haven't played siege in about 2 days. And the last time I was playing I didn't see anything in chat that was causing matches to crash. 
---
If this is something new that has popped up in the recent 24-48 hours, I have to commend Ubi on the quick response!
---
It used to be my favorite map. Now I got none
---
Good look, but aren't you getting a little tired of looking at the same character cards? Idk I think introducing unique set cards would spice things up a bit.
---
I legitimately can't describe how angry this made me when people started picking up on it. I don't get tilted by very much in this game, but *holy living mother of shit, this was incredibly tilting.*
---
Thank you for getting on this quickly, Ubi. Now fix Clash.
---
Asshats
---
Awesome to see, hopefully this will deteer people from using exploits.
---
LOL Amazing.
---
definitely. i have a 5 stack in low/high plat and we win often because of the support players. kills r not everything. my squadmate has a low kd but gives excellent callouts, places good valk cams etc. on attack they will drone the fraggers in. so in conclusion, if u have 0 kills u can have an amazing game
---
Yay :D. Ubi is fixing the game
---
Nice CAV

Instead of team killing people because you are trying to play the game just get to the wall first

Yes u/Ubi-Thanos (doesn't exist) . finger snap those exploiters out of existence

As you can see, I sprinted into safety and on my screen was behind the hard wall, yet the bullets still register on where I was a split second ago.

This is an every game thing for people on high ping. It hasn't been an advantage in 2 years, stop that excuse already. If you lose to high ping, it's because they were better.
---
Probably won‚Äôt happen in the near future, unfortunately :(

Get ready for the "I was unjustly banned reeeeeeee" posts on Reddit and Discord.

Except they won‚Äôt because glitches are on there end and people find them, they have been doing pretty good with staying on top of them, can‚Äôt ban players for using a glitch that‚Äôs in the game. Honestly better that they‚Äôre found fast, so that they don‚Äôt happen for a month lol

Well yeah, but if you buy it, take it home over night, then the chef breaks into your house and shits on your steak, there won't be some kind of reimbursement? 
---
Me asking for a refund is 100% a joke dude, calm down. Ranked is, however, broken right now, and really unplayable if your not already a plat level player.
---
Yeah just like someone spraying in the room I'm in isn't intentional Tking but it's so close to it that they deserve the temporary handicap because they can't be fucking trusted. The Mira's was obviously a fucking idiot, and liable to do stupid shit again, and if they did they'd only harm themself, not their teammates that didn't deserve to play with the mentally handicapped
---
I know right?
---
I sent a clip of someone abusing this glitch to ubisoft... and nothing.
---
(He was Silver/Bronze for the past 4 seasons and suddenly he's plat with 80% winrate with Clash... fucking bullshit)

Go to the rainbow six ubisoft support page and report it directly as a toxic behavior.

Yeah I second this

Please let me know if you find something that works, I have about 500 hours in Siege and its my most played game.

Pride month was last month
---
I usually play at a higher vertical sensitivity for a reason, but even then, that recoil is a little aggressive and buck is my 3rd most played operator lol
---
Bandit been dealing to him.
---
I tried compensating with barrel attachments, but the recoil is still too strong
---
did you try putting it in rice?
---
Thats a huge F

I‚Äôve already done that and it hasn‚Äôt worked. I deleted all files on my pc related to rainbow and I‚Äôm reinstalling right now.

Hopefully Ubi' similarly starts cracking down *somehow* (I've got no suggestions on how to track and crack them sadly) on the DDOS'ing and M&amp;K'ers on console as of lately the issues have been growing the last few seasons in even the mid-Gold's and above. 
---
Personally for me out of my 55 or so matches the DDOS has occured twice (both in the high Golds) this season and it happened to me twice last in Burnt Horizon (I believe both were in the low-mid Plats' for me). It's a small number of course, but still would be lovely to put some fear into people who cheat in Ranked. 
---
Anyways, love the intiative and aggression towards forms of cheating in Ranked on all platforms lately to the people at Ubi', well done. üòä
---
SHHH ED SMH
---
Its just to confirm the answer for the person asking about the SSD. Didn‚Äôt mean anything by it. Sorry if you don‚Äôt like that.
---
Id be fine with a small horizontal recoil reduction, but they have to be careful... idk if you remember but the scorpion used to be by far the most overpowered gun in the game due to its fire rate and recoil gifting free headshots... I‚Äôd still say right now Ela is imo the best roamer on defense (for ranked) purely because of the fragging capability of that shotgun, I just try to avoid playing her because it‚Äôs considered a ‚Äúcancer‚Äù where if you play it people are gonna play it against you
---
The same but worse- you don‚Äôt have the precision with a controller you do for a mouse, which makes it harder to accurately control recoil. Low sensitivity helps shooters, but with buck‚Äôs gun or others your best bet is to start chest or belly button level because you won‚Äôt be able to stop the kick from going head level.
---
The learning curve is a little steep but I finally got it down.
---
I play at 800 with 9/10 83.
---
how is this even possible?
---
This is what pcp must feel like
---
Spin the wheel.  Every one has seen the badger vid right
---
Pull down medium?
---
Thank you, if you have even higher ping sometimes they'll teleport and make it even harder
---
God yes please. Every time i rappel on hereford and consulate i unwillingly end up on the roof.
---
And they would most definitly just make a new account buy the game again and continue as long as they make money from these videos. Siege keys are pretty cheap and there is no way you can prevent someone from creating a new account and start playing again. 
---
As long as it is profitable for them they will continue, simple as that.
---
Banning is not really an effective tool against people that make a living of creating, distributing glitches, hacks, and so on. It works on the "normal" player (usually) since they don't make money from the game so buying it over and over again and start from scratch every time becomes too annoying at some point so they will either stop playing or stop hacking/glitching at some point, but those that make money from providing videos on glitches or distributing hacks don't really care if they get banned so banning them isn't really effective.
---
Sure, that was so racist. Fucking lib.

Also Battleeye had nothing to do with the renown bans back then (which you are referncing) that was FairFight. And they won't use battleeye for this banwave either since battleeye is stricly an anticheat tool and nothing more.

I wouldnt use supressor on the ar15 since you lose the two hit potential against 1 and 2 armors.

If you spend a few minutes in t-hunt it's easy to get it down even using an acog. At first I stopped using the acog after the nerf but now I'm able to use an acog with compensator and control well.

Ranked

If true this sub Reddit is going to be full of:  Why was my account banned? Help me get my account unbanned? Upvote to get me unbanned. Haha

Because you can find both diamonds and gold at level 12

Once i won a 5v3 game lol ubi pls fix

Ok yeah I know that I‚Äôm asking for help against them

But the question is y the p90

Ubi needs to work on fixing the game before they take anymore money

OMG. Have fun hearing the dude and his family chatting in Arabic while another kid mouthbreathes constantly. Third guy blaring music and the last is singing to himself.

TLDR: turn chat volume to zero on PS4.

Thats for symbol spamming in chat, which sorta overloads the lobby for everyone and, in my case one time, can force everyone‚Äôs game to crash).

What‚Äôs the uniform ?

A massive fuck you to the people who use this exploit

because ubisoft are too lazy to re-do the shields and instead just use bandaid fixes

If you think that‚Äôs racist, you are properly more left leaning.

Idk if you could do it objectively. They're all really balanced.

New twitch recoil too

‚ÄúI really want to play but I don‚Äôt want to casual solo queue.‚Äù
---
Holy shit. I remember back in like 2009 watching Club Penguin youtube videos with this song as background music. Good ol days
---
I just tried but it says the same thing thanks though
---
I cant math either. You mean so a square mousepad becomes a diamond?
---
If you can handle the recoil with it on his M4 then absolutely. It still has pretty high damage even being suppressed. It makes you even sneakier when making murder holes when nobody is aware.
---
Only on P.S though? Damn Microsoft and Sony üò¢
---
They already said ages ago that ranked is for matchmaking, not rewards.
---
Just a thought mate
---
He froze his beard.
---
I didn‚Äôt know pulse was a boomer
---
On the plus side deagle and muzzle break is fuckin great
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
In ranked high level players often que with low levels because it‚Äôll average out their MMR, (like a Diamond queing with a bronze/copper so they get easier games, the high level player can carry the team while artificially raising his own rank. It‚Äôs a way to cheat the system for easy rank or games. Pretty Lame
---
this does put a smile on my face
---
Thanks fucker
---
so don't tk

Someone tried to ban me today because I randomly picked Frost.

Obviously the hard core roamers are going to say he‚Äôs ‚Äúoverpowered.‚Äù Idk how the hell he can be called ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù for the game when siege is based around operators that are meant to counter strats and other ops lol. Totally agree with you on your point here about the charts too.

(o.0)
---
It a joke
---
I've had a DIAMOND in a silver lobby before and we somehow won.
---
When I was a buck main I just jacksd up my ADS sensitivity so i could control his recoil.
---
I'm a bit confused about this.   it means that if someone got reported just bcs enemy team lost and rage he will be banned too? Bcs how ubi will be sure about if the guy is really a glitcher, hacker... Or if he is just a normal legit player.   if someone can tell me, I don't really understand rg.
---
Acctualy wjere can i buy this

100%, feels so much better on PC but hard to get used too

Bad news buddy.

Really? I couldve sworn the aug a3 was classified smg...solid gun nonetheless
---
what the fuck

Vertical sensitivity? My friend plays on 100 100 and controls it perfectly with ACOG. I just use Holo and it's fine.
---
Basically the Geneva accord applies EXCLUSIVELY to people who also act accordingly. If you break the accord you are not protected by it. This is part of what makes being a spy so dangerous, you are breaking the accord and can therefore be tortured etc without punishment from the accord (but governments may still take action)
---
Thanks!!!!!!!!
---
So, we're on Playstation in Private Party chat, and I hopped in game to see what they were taking about. I overheard the one kid was mad that my friend pickes Ying and intended to get him killed. I was TKd that round, and watched my 2 other friends playing, one was distracting the 2 kids, the other was actually playing Obj. One of them did get banned in the last round cuz he tried to TK me again forgetting that reverse ff was on for him. Lmao
---
Lol it was, yikes.  Not the point though.  I am actually curious why someone would get banned for downing a hostage
---
Oh thanks!  Didn't think of that lol
---
Where's the hentai at chief?

if you use console, try flash hider
---
One of my friends and I were playing casual and these two people downed me and another rando on our team, but I guess they saw us in an Xbox party chat together cause they got on top of me and t-bagged me so my friend couldn't revive me, people really dont know how to act I guess lol.
---
Shit, sorry man, just heard about now
---
When someone joins a squad it lags the game and will kick you out of an alpha pack
---
Old hereford base will never be forgotten
---
I always presumed it was schrapnel that cut his eye. But, that's just me
---
I used to be able to somewhat laser the C8, ever since they changed the recoil, it hasn‚Äôt been the same for me.
---
Unless it was a recent change. It was counting toward my AR challenges last time I actually cared about the U play club challenges anyway lol
---
You still have the skin, it just takes you off the screen.
---
Lower sens
---
Amen to that
---
Low sensitivity is easier, not nessacarily better. Ridiculously high sensitivity would theorically be better as you could switch targets and control recoil faster. In practice people are too imprecise to utilize it
---
Yeah I feel like this is the most likely, tho I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs network related my other games are working.
---
Stop fucking bitching about it. Protecting the hostage is the team‚Äôs objective. By downing the hostage, you are making it harder for your team to complete their objective. 
---
Retard
---
No prob happy to help.
---
It is a very solid gun. But I wish they had given me the same one IQ had because I have a couple of skins I really like and would love to use on his gun.
---
That was my first too
---
Ela recoil without attachments
---
Why is the terrorist hunt matchmaking take forever, does no one play on them?

You're doing it wrong. Aim with your arms, not your wrists. It's more consistent and allows for micro adjustment with your wrists.

Doing researcch tends to be quicker and contributes to the end of the epidemic of spam of the same thing like the showdown easter eggs

Hello Nightblade20, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cbbse1/iq_glitch_and_shield_glitch_are_still_happening/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Thanks for the input.  As I originally stated I downed the hostage by accident.   Not a common occurrence.  Surely in your time in siege you have accidentally landed a bullet on a friendly by mistake at least once????  
---
Not sure why your even commenting on a post without any real useful input unless you enjoy getting a rise out of random people lol

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:
---
###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.
---
&gt;and region
---
yes
---
I agree I think they should at least need the fire rate and keep the damage
---
I've survived. Claymores as a 3 armor but never a 2. Is damage divided between occupants in range?
---
This guy comments
---
Unfortunately, that‚Äôs just the siege community being toxic. I find the same trouble on xbox all the time. I hate solo queuing even in casual bc of trolls.
---
Oh damn, was my statement an attack on your maturity? Is the word autism that sacred to you to were if anyone talks shit about a person using it you get offended? Probably so, since you know, you're immature.
---
I don't seem to understand why you're so adamant on trying to personally attack me rather than argue against my point, but oh well. If you're trying to say its banned because it can be used in a negative way, its kinda pointless since there are so many words that can be worded in a negative way. You can literally take a normal word like "banned" and turn it into a negative/racist gamertag such as "BannedImmigrant". I don't need the word "autism" to make an edgy or funny name, neither do majority of the players. Might as well move on and ban half the dictionary, right?
---
Same. So diiiiiiiid you get them nudes OP?
---
Thanks man, really long list now, gonna take at least a week to get through but I will come for you eventually!
---
if you spam a certain character it would lag the entire game
---
Smg12 fires enough bullets that you dont gotta worry too much about
---
'Why shoot the accurate, when you can just fire more bullet?'
---
The reason autism is banned is because of how common it is used. I just told you my opinion on it, why are you questioning me? What's your theory?
---
The two matches I've played with her since she's been back just reinforce how much nicer it is with her gone. I genuinely feel disappointed when I suddenly hear her screaming.
---
If you‚Äôre not here to help then fuck off, its my preference
---
It is very powerful, but stop posting this ‚Äúchange my mind‚Äù shit, it makes me want to set downvote no matter what
---
It works 5 times out of 10 times, every time.
---
I have a question why is the name Jesus offensive? I can't change my name to something that includes Jesus!!!
---
...So just PC, then?
---
I‚Äôm already contacting the local mental hospital.

I don‚Äôt have a good title
---
Cry about it
---
Sooooo I've never sledge'd a clash before. Does in cause them to flinch?
---
Make it so you cant use your gun while in tracking mode and he only gets 1 ping off a track instead if like 5 he has now. And the team can only see when he purple thing is on
---
Why would a flash hider be better than a muzzle break except reducing the flash?
---
Reported, you‚Äôre not gonna bring that kinda filth into this sub
---
i cant start the game atfer this fucking update
---
What? Did you even read my response? I'm not questioning you, I'm responding to your response lol. That's what a debate is. You were saying that it was due to the fact that it can be used in a negative way, I responded to that statement. This is a discussion thread.
---
How do you do edits like this? Ive wanted to learn this for years.
---
I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with the image, looks like a standard ranked match to me
---
Whatever is most comfortable for you, that said I will always suggest starting low and figuring out where you should go from there. Somewhere in the 20-30cm/360 range, say 8 at 800 DPI.  
---
  
---
Also ignore anyone saying you need low DPI, use whatever DPI you like when doing general things out of game and use your mouses DPI button for something useful like muting Discord or something.
---
It‚Äôs not that high. It works well for me. It‚Äôs only I think 1200 dpi.
---
What happened to the person that was looking at you from the window while you were reloading?
---
I wouldnt call it a major problem. Just mute them, you dont want to talk to that kind of person anyway.
---
I run Buck with the Holographic, and I think it makes the gun a lot better. I'm usually up close with him anyway.
---
Not unpopular
---
I use his C8's automatic for close range and the semi automatic for longer range
---
god why is this funny?
---
They‚Äôll get what‚Äôs coming to em.
---
What about Czech ? We have 601.skss and it's one of the best special forces in the world. they were using our vz.58 and now Bren 2 and par mk.3 . I hope they will make 601. In year 5
---
It sure feels like it.
---
You realize you're feeding a troll right?
---
He said he's been getting FPS Drops and lag spikes, I didn't mention fixing lag spikes because it's such a long road or trouble shooting and it can be 100 different things, also he didn't even give enough info for ANYONE to reliably discern whether or not it was lag or frame drops. what the fuck kind of high horse do you come in on commenting that stupid, incorrect shit In a 30 day old thread
---
F for those who are about to get banned
---
Tell that to the idiots who think free speech is for everyone.

My friend was trying to teamkill me and I tried flicking on him but instead I killed the last guy

In casual, anything is fine as long as it isn't hacking, glitching, or doing sh*t against the TOS. If you want to test an angle for spawnpeeking, there is nothing stopping you from doing it.
---
.44 mag semiauto? r/ihadastroke
---
Oh my god cry about it some more. First of all, its not unpopular. This whole community of whining toddlers will find anything to cry about, spawnpeeking included. It's part of the game, you can counter it, and you can perform it too. If you think someone's pulling a dick move because they're better than you then consider yourself a major part of the aforementioned whiny toddler community.
---
I used to play with holo but I seem to get more frags with AcOG
---
Yeah it really shows how clueless people in here are about sensitivities in general. 400 dpi with 10 sens is the same as 800 dpi with 5 sens, yet for some reason people just look at the dpi without thinking about the actual sensitivity. I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
---
Mute is sad that you forgot he has the smg11 now :(
---
Shotgun. Powerful.
---
How you compare this words in one sentence? Ridiculous.
---
"needs a Nerf, let's discuss".
---
Fair sass haha. 
---
Look, 3000 ping or whatever you‚Äôre peaking at is insane. That‚Äôs not even milliseconds, that‚Äôs regular seconds. You are having full disconnects from the server, and I‚Äôm honestly surprised you aren‚Äôt being bumped off the server. 
---
I asked about the scan because it‚Äôs really about what‚Äôs going on with your computer (what‚Äôs visible on task manager). I‚Äôd guess you use Steam, so it‚Äôs entirely likely that Steam is updating games while you start up Siege. The massive bandwidth draw for downloads will f*#&lt; your ping. 
---
There are a lot of variables for PC gaming, but task manager will let you know if it‚Äôs a problem with YOU. Once you rule yourself out, your options drastically reduce unfortunately.
---
Why is this a spoiler?
---
I'm not quite sure if you're referring to me as the troll. Assuming you are, how am I trolling? It's an actual question with merit. Try to use the word "autism" in your name and you'll realize its banned.
---
We need a crusader skin in this game right now
---
IN THE NAME OF GOD 
---
IN THE NAME OF GOD WE GO TO HEAAAAVEEEEEN
---
I'm bad at the game three
---
Sorry, on mobile.
---
DPI itself does not mean your complete sensitivity... 400 dpi 10 sens and 800 dpi with 5 sens are the same.
---
Load outs
---
this frustrates me to no end - Alibi's outfit and weapon skin is amazing, same for cav, yet you're giving it in packs up to $60.
---
an Idea (just mine alone): offer them in bundles instead of packs - they do it for Halloween
---
Yes that is also another hint that we might be seeing Greek ops in the future. I think in one of the concept arts for Mozzie as well you can see Harry has a flight ticket to Greece.
---
Initially, balance reasons.
---
They didn't expect that it would be _this_ weak as a fooling device.

Who Kan?! Kapkan!!

Yeah it totally wasn't a typo

If u add another 2 of them and put it together it will be "controlling ela's recoil"
---
Very fast
---
I have 800 dpi, 5.4/5.4/83
---
Lol
---
I say that because I play with quite low sensitivities
---
There are/were huge gamebreaking exploits where clash can shoot with her shield out, IQ is invisible, deplorable shield stuck on head, etc. 
---
It was/is on console and PC, which is why they temp banned claymores, clash, shields.
---
Cav 2.0
---
I'm to tired to argue anymore. Goodnight I'm going to bed
---
someone alarm clock this bitch, I want to see it all.
---
Nope.
---
As far as we know event collections are exclusive to the event and they have yet to repeat a single event.
---
high effort posts thanks for contributing to this subreddit
---
What does this exploit actually do?
---
Well I saw someone spamming it didn‚Äôt know about it and spammed it don‚Äôt know if it was under 10 heard if it‚Äôs under you don‚Äôt get ban I might have done it 11 times (This was when it lagged the server not crashed) but apparently if you didn‚Äôt do it much less ban time
---
Goodnight üôÇ
---
F‚Äôs In chat
---
From what I‚Äôve been hearing from my usual 5 stack (on xbox) they had the exact same issues. I dont have an answer as to who is at fault but Ubi seems to be getting blamed as per usual. Hope it gets fixed soon! Sorry if this wasn‚Äôt helpful
---
I should assume  they‚Äôll just make a new Halloween/Fall event like how they did Summer Splash last year and Showdown this year then?
---
Sounds like your pc is struggling performance wise and is even back logging sounds hut then dumping it because its time to play has passed.
---
Gnüëå
---
Doesnt matter, Ubi blocks native M&amp;K anyway so XIM is the only way to use one in R6
---
Basically you type a long message and when you send it it drops everyone‚Äôs FPS to like 5 for half a second. Some people got macros to flood the chat and it was a big issue
---
Does it count if you type " &lt;3 " or " Holo &gt; Reflex " ?
---
It does more than 80.
---
He isn't dying due to bad game design.  Dying due to his mistakes or simply getting out gunned.
---
At this point they need to have a system that instant bans people that do the actions it requires to do this exploit.
---
Anything other than $60 all in would be preferable
---
I am not completing them to protest against the shitshow that is ranked. Exploits. Teammates are staring at the ground, enemies are always pros. In 90% of my matches I am carry, yet still stuck in silver/gold.
---
oh fuck i abused this....
---
I try to tell him that but it‚Äôs always the games fault and maybe 5% of the time it is but he blames every single death on the game. It‚Äôs annoying sometimes.
---
So its a lighter version of DDoS?
---
Describing what's already in the game doesn't make it right or wrong. I'm just stating the fact that kills are kills just like deaths are deaths. Simple as that.
---
Since when?
---
I use that sign from time to time but have not played much this season.
---
true
---
they should also allow people to buy the event-packs with renown (price scaled tho)
---
^^^ This
---
I had the same thing exactly last week
---
Ok douche
---
Wots in the canista
---
Actually it's not that hard, try muzzle break
---
They should do a crusade gamemode
---
Quality shitpost
---
R√∂ok
---
No. Stop spreading bullshit to people who dont know the topic in depth. Higher dpi means its more accurate. 400 dpi= 400 dots are being scanned in 1 inch. 12000dpi means there are 12000 dots getting scanned in 1 inch. The more dots the sensor scans the less pixels it skips meaning higher dpi is more accurate
---
Ingame sens only multiply your dpi making it effective sensitivity. 10 ingame sens with 400 dpi is literally the same as 1 ingame sens with 4000 dpi it just skips less pixels. If you think lower dpi is better 1)youre wrong 2)it literally doesnt matter nowadays unless you play really high sens
---
Save for ops you want or save up 200000 for 50 alpha packs
---
I know I'm a horrible human being for this but I actually hoped that the guy would throw the waterballoon on the kid.
---
The smg makes me wanna nut
---
Honestly, just buy the ops you dont have, you might end up regularly using them, and they might benefit you team if the team needs one of those ops
---
I second this

Why would using the ingame chat crash matches?

Just call the enemy army one of those

Thats where Theater mode comes in handy . recording gameplays and sending it to ubisoft
---
Do you think that you are better than your teammates? If yes, you should be able to climb. If no, then you are where you belong. Simple. ‚ÄúBeing good‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean that you are 5.5k elo. I may be wrong as I have never been in copper, but a previous gold2 should NOT have a problem getting out of copper. Significant skill/knowledge gap
---
Agreed but I don't know about Maverick. I don't remember when was the last time I was killed by him because i couldn't hear him making a hole. I hear him almost every time and I say almost because when I don't hear him, I actually don't hear anything else either because of a clusterfuck happening. In those situations, it doesn't matter if it's Maverick I don't hear, so I think he's fine at the moment.
---
The operators are designed for play inside the game. Not a set gamemode. 3 round switch was not implemented simply so "people dont forget the other team rushed them" and it doesnt provide better teamplay. It makes it unbalanced and gives the first team defending the advantage. Also, of course a Diamond Hostage player isnt as good at bomb as they are at Hostage. That would go for any player who plays a single gamemode and not the others. Thats like saying a baseball player isnt as good at softball as a softball player.
---
Also the glitchs are not fixed and still being used as we speak.
---
Im trying to be as civil as possible but Im not going to have this turn into some entrentched Bible length battle of the opinions. Its a waste of time for us both. A majority of what I said is *fact* however in the end one could also say some are opinions. Which we both are entitled too.
---
Also I dont mean the quote marks in a condescending way. I simply wanted to respond in a civil manner.
---
Most likely of low level. Console people hare low levels for some reason
---
You mean back when it was the most overpowered thing that ever existed in the game? Sure as hell don't miss those days. So glad it's actually pretty balanced now.
---
CSGO‚Äôs anticheat is actually a lot easier to bypass than BE. You can just read info off internet and know what to do in order to avoid detection. And it‚Äôs usermode, meaning game memory modifications are a lot easier. BattlEye isn‚Äôt shit. It‚Äôs a pain in the a\*\* to bypass. In my opinion, it‚Äôs the best one out there currently( excluding ACs used in competitions, ive never looked at those) EAC is easier to bypass, but their HWID bans are really good.
---
Overwatch relies on match replays, and replays doesn‚Äôt exist for R6. I guess it‚Äôs something they could do, I can‚Äôt tell if it would be easy or hard to add because like I said, I haven‚Äôt written any cheats for this game so I don‚Äôt exactly know how server/client deals with each other.

Man i once potatoed with Buck and I was getting flak like after the recoil change Buck is ez and stuff
---
But no one on the team wanted to play Buck because they said his gun is not good and played sledge for vertical play instead
---
WhAT iS iN thE caNiStER?

It‚Äôs best if you dont ask

Haha fair enough! I hope I didnt sound aggressive, simply curious (:

Aim is bad but I still got the ace
---
Yeah it must be low level. They kick and tk lover levels a ton
---
Thank you
---
Ela wants to know your location.
---
Search your r6 files for missing files (right click at the game and search for missing files )
---
Yeah you probably got carried anyway, do it.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs true. Though, most of the ops I don‚Äôt have aren‚Äôt ¬´¬†essentials¬†¬ª  ops like Frost, Blackbeard, Kaid, Nomad and all...
---
That's why all the community wants some things server side.... in a complex game like this you cannot only handle Time, Scoreboard, Health, Ammo, Gadget count, but also obviously you cannot handle everything since it would create other problems, i think that if Ubisoft will pay for a custom BE version created specifically for Rainbow Six with the Dev of BE and of the R6 team togheter would be easier to do since they would have the base of the BattleEye but customized with some feature to detect more easly a cheat and from a multi milionaire software house like Ubisoft i would expect more effort to fight cheaters since R6S is the game with which they have billed the most in recent years
---
Yeah, though 200.000 is a lot of renown, so it might be hard to reach that amount
---
You need someone to feed off of to start your initial strat before each map. You‚Äôre job is to make necessary changes to that strat in game if the initial isn‚Äôt working, as well as per round if the entry‚Äôs/site control coordination isn‚Äôt going your way. I would also play more intel ops to help your team coordinate better to make those necessary call outs your team might need during the each round. Just my interpretation of what should be done, I‚Äôve only learned so much as taking on a IGL role although I haven‚Äôt done much on the competitive seen.
---
I feel like the clips should be the round. Some glitches can be done accidentally and if someone reports another for an accidental glitch that would be very bad
---
Just seen your age, it all makes sense now.
---
Apparently you can't, this has nothing to do with the comment you're replying to.
---
I'm seeing all of these comments about dpi while I'm sitting here with a controller
---
Ubi doesn't own servers, they just rent them.
---
he‚Äôs non-essential. period. non-essential ops shouldn‚Äôt be above essential ops in a ranked tier list, better guns or not.
---
You want https://www.reddit.com/r/R6STeams/ - rather than the main sub
---
Pogchamp
---
I put doc under a because he is a great op but he is a 1 speed I put thatcher in c because he is useless without thermite and nomad should be higher she is a great area denial and Lizzie has a gadget just like Mutes but he has less and the drones are destroyed a lot and his guns aren‚Äôt the best but I should‚Äôve put him c tho
---
I don‚Äôt even drink energy drinks but would buy these.
---
I think it's supposed to be Rust
---
This is over posted.
---
Looks like it's his arm tho
---
Ive put it in both, gives me a bigger chance of finding one
---
The year pass is good value already it's fine

U watch pro league ?

Not much only clips once in awhile

Verify the files through steam or uplay

What did tekashi do? I know Chris brown is an abuser, but what‚Äôd tekashi do?
---
on twitter they said if a person did it 10+ times, its a ban

Ehh, I think we should get more, but I buy em anyway..
---
Ads gives you a tighter spread. Unless you are caught off guard always ads.
---
Ads can mean the difference between enough pellets hitting a leg to kill them when if yiu hip fire the spread means you don't land enough and have to shoot again.
---
In siege ads = always down sights ;)
---
Use a treadmill running at full speed and the recoil of the smg12 is gone.
---
Not really for any primary weapon, but secondaries are worth considering.
---
Not sure who you are aiming this at, but it's way way off. 
---
Maestro - easily S Tier. One of the most frequently played ops in professional play. Offers destructability, denial, great gun, intel etc. 
---
Ela is not S tier. 
---
Cav is not S tier
---
Mira is S tier
---
Smoke is A tier at minimum.
---
Thatcher is way above C Tier, pretty essential with bans these days. 
---
I mean this in the nicest way possible, but there is tonnes wrong with this list in terms of order from a higher level player point of view.
---
By spamming the chat full of symbols you‚Äôll cause both teams to lag for a second or two. More to annoy people than to get any actual advantage since it effects everyone. The other claymore/deployable shield glitch should be fixed already since both has been back in the game for some time now.
---
Is this like repeated spamming  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; in game chat ?
---
Somebody was doing this on saturday night &amp; every time it appeared on screen the game seemed to lag for maybe  a second or so
---
At the time i thought it was maybe just a coincidence, plus i was slightly pickled by this time
---
But i'm wondering now
---
Especially these days
---
Well thing that i dont enjoy about ying is being countered by jager. I like the breaching from above and flashing strategy though and i never thought of it.
---
if it was the SMG-12, it'll need to be longer
---
You know, You just saved me
---
Finally someone who gets clash.  She doesn't need to be banned every game. Much better ops to ban.
---
Balanced? Shes fucking garbage you goddamn moron. Her gun has worse recoil than bucks, she has 1 less grzmot, her clip size was reduced, and she doesnt even have fucking impacts. Lemme guess, you are one of those people who whine until something even remotely good is gutted right?
---
It's a Triple A studio with pools of money , this will be like nothing .
---
Because its his tier list and not a pro league tier list. This is far more valuable then a pro league tier list.
---
Ranked is not even close to the same level of play as pro league.
---
Never 
---
Pros NEVER go for hipfire because hipfire isn't a valid tactic in siege where there is high bullet probability and inconsistency and that hipfire constantly gets nerfed. What you saw was not anybody "opting" for it, but a spray when getting jumped on out of reflex. The videos that you see of people leaning behind cover and leaning out and hipfiring are just for content for videos. In any scenario, it doesn't  make sense to hipfire, even with the hipfire monster pdw9.
---
like i didnt do it alot but will it be a perma ban even if i did do it alot?
---
I shall fix this for you all
---
AGREED
---
Yeah but this isn't the place for it. Looking for team posts have a sub for that reason, otherwise we'd be inundated with them. So best to delete this one or it'll likely get removed anyway.
---
Also jfl at downvoting me. Not surprised since you are the people who removed ash's acog.. whos next fucking twitch?
---
Oi. Read down this post to my last comment.
---
Can confirm.
---
too hard to do, if we reach the million it will be huge.
---
in 10 matchs, i only do one headshot
---
I'm thinking to send pm to the opponent to have an agreement
---
I was never against a day or two ban lol, but there‚Äôs people who get pushed up to plat on actual ranked by abusing OP glitches, and not once has Zuni threatened to ban and actually take action on them. I wasted about 10 seconds of time in total of someone‚Äôs game and am perfectly fine with a 1-2 ban, they wasted hours of others and get nada?
---
Gamesense and awareness is a process that takes a lot of time. The best thing you can probably do is make them play positions where they are forced to learn it, like roam and Intel gathering. Many operators can aid in this with their gadgets, such as Jackal, IQ, Dokkaebi on attack and Lesion, Ela, Pulse, Mira, Kapkan on defense.
---
High ping does not give you an advantage in siege.  Get past it.  You got killed by someone actively playing at a disadvantaged state.
---
He's @_notpulse on IG
---
OK. I'll give it a chance again. The last weeks it was completely unplayable because of trolls.
---
I mean, it did. Things creep back in or get introduced over time, unfortunately. OpHealth was two years ago.
---
theres no reason to not use the extended barrel on frost
---
Or, alternatively: play my boy Capitao. Fastest way to get rid of Clash ever: roast her alive.
---
My friend got a bug yesterday where he got kicked from the game, and when he tried to reconnect it put him into a new match.
---
every downvotes = everybody who exploited the glitches

Bikinibodhi is pretty funny ain't he

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm biased after the exploit war of June
---
truly justified, i don‚Äôt think so
---
What everyone does that...
---
Meanwhile a million games get ruined over the span of a couple weeks because so many people know about it and forcing Ubi to act quicker leaves us with inferior patchwork instead of a proper bugfix because they're forced to push something asap. (As proven by how shields and IQ were reenabled and then disabled again.)
---
The alternative is to simply post it on R6Fix and let Ubi do it at their own pace, only having 10000 games ruined over a year because so few people know about it and Ubi gets to fix it properly.
---
(Numbers made up, but I assume you get my point.) I know which option I'd pick.
---
I just have stufff against her since the exploit

Practically every community has these kinds of people, it's only brought to a head because of how incompetent Ubi is at fixing these bugs and exploits. You're 100% right about the toxicity tho
---
Nah man chill
---
There is a huge difference in scale between your average ranked match kid who just bought a random booter off the internet and the person in that article. The person in the article brought down entire service networks.

They shoot to make sure it works.... Bunch of horse shit eating wankers

Thx makes me happy üòÄ

I was hoping this would target the clash glitchers or something like that but at least this‚Äôll get rid of some problems

If he is permanently afk, yes.

But if he isn't, shouldn't downing be sufficient?

This wasn't very cash money of you

 AR33 is a hidden gem with suppressor but not everyone is ready for that conversation, that combo with reflex is a very fun thatcher experience.
---
I try to no get spotted by initial scan from drones then run and hide somewhere using the csmeras to keep an eye on the room your in or the enemies location and attack when they arent looking. When i do play multiplayer of course :P

Sorry, guys! Saw it for the first time, thought it was funny, not aware of every R6 meme that exists, mea maxima culpa, will never post it again.

Its nice but a just to much if you ask me

Pass thos pwates

No?!
---
TK's should never be an option. Unless it really would be game Saving.  
---
For example, there was going on a video on this subreddit, where 3 Guys were attacking, 10 Secs left on the clock.
---
But the Mate who had the defuser didn't plant, he camped in a corner waiting for the last Defender to appear. Time ran out, on attacker decided to TK the Defuser Carrier, got the Defuser, rushed to the Site an planted it. So he Saved the Game with his Action.

I don‚Äôt think you really understood my point. I acknowledged that ping is a two way street. (Capable of working in favor of both players) My argument is that having to play against pingers is dishonest to the mechanics of the game and truly ruins the experience. While I will gladly ‚Äúget past‚Äù this experience, I still don‚Äôt see any reason to not voice a complaint of experiences like this continue to occur. Cuz they suck.

Hello a-humman, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cbev7j/how_do_i_fix_the_ping_and_plug_warning_signs_it/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Ok, so going by what you have said, and your new tier list as well,  you are CLEARLY new or inexperienced. Because there is a heck ton wrong with what you have just said and your tier lists. In that scenario, I'd suggest you learn up a bit, get more experienced, and then make a good tier list. Because as it stands, there's too many issues.

i'm just sitting here wondering how the fuck something like this is even a bug ... what kind of code was written for that chat thing ... can we see it i'd love to read it ?
---
Same here this is really annoying
---
Real pros keep a piss bottle beside them at all times.
---
It has happened to me a few times, losing marcha but winning elo, winning matcha but losing elo. I think it‚Äôs just a bug it happens from time to time.
---
Thats why these 'definitive attachment graphs' dont really help. Its all personal preference, so what works for me might not work for you
---
Oh she's annoying, but people shouldn't ignore how strong she is though, a strong independent woman lol

She shouldn't have any additional skill other than the shield. Take the shock away. She should be nothing more than a mobile entry denial operator with a pistol. Does Montagne have anything other than a body length shield and a pistol? No, so why does clash have that, plus a sub machine gun, plus the ability to shock? Shes way OP.

Another iq  glitch?

Hello [http://prntscr.com/od2bck](http://prntscr.com/od2bck)
---
I strongly believe that you don't need flash hider on automatic weapons that don't have random recoil, like L85a2 or Spear. Muzzle Break reduces recoil better and smaller diamond isn't needed for such weapons (Flash Hider also doesn't reduce it by a lot).
---
Good starting points though. Especially the original post, as he explained how the weapons felt. As well as how some weapons reacted with each attachment.
---
Great, thank you.
---
Staged but cool.
---
Yeh why has the 9mm C1 none, it'd be stupid not to put one on
---
I doubt he even cares, he can just buy stolen accounts for cheap anyway (Most of these glitches are doable in Casual as well, so he doesn't need the 2 step activation in order to show them anyway).
---
Muzzle on every gun
---
Hipfire is good for high rpm shotguns and in very close distance imo. I almost never ads with the FO-12 or the SASG (except with Finka-Boost). The recoil is (almost) impossible to control in ads without reducing your speed of shooting. Just spraying down is most times the better choice.
---
No worries
---
Damn:)))
---
I don‚Äôt... I also use the P90
---
that is not true.
---
Muzzle brake: -45% first shot vertical recoil (nothing to any other shot), -45% centering time
---
Flash hider: -37,5% first shot vertical recoil, 5% recoil reduction on every shot(diamonds that define how much can next shot "be different" than 5% smaller), -30% centering time
---
Compensator:  no effect on centering time, 17,5% recoil reduction (diamonds are smaller by 17,5%) on every shot, no additional effect on first shot vertical recoil.
---
This behavious was confirmed and showed by developers
---
Those properties for the attachments are wrong tho..
---
That shotgun is awful. Like it's a stuff of nightmares. Scary af. 
---
Unless it's you firing it. Then it all of a sudden feels like you turned into doomslayer himself.
---
Would be nice if I didn't get redirected to the german homepage of r6 everytime I click on the link.
---
On that regard, we accidently wrote some of those &lt;3 symbols in order to let other people know about the fact that it was banned (We found it funny in that moment and didn't know it was actually a game breaking glitch), will there be any problem considering we didn't actually crash any game?
---
Attack: Sledge - I feel like you just can't go wrong with Sledge, ever.
---
Defense: Bandit/Rook (depending on the map and team comp)
---
Packet loss is a good thing
---
Don't yeet your mouse away man
---
Wait what? I think it's time to read the changelog for the first time ever.
---
Not the main point but ok
---
why you need that
---
Some of you guys sound like you've only played the game once, theres a lot more to these attachments than we all know. And on certain guns certain things will just always work better
---
i.e: muzzle brake on buck and hibana AR 
---
All in all its up to the user and their preference of how they want to control their weapon
---
I personally like my guns with less horizontal than vertical so I run muzzle brake or flash on most guns unless for the laser beam guns w less recoil like the c7e or ak-12
---
You're gonna have to control recoil no matter what when shooting your whole mag, so whatever helps you keep the same steady stream is fine
---
Or heck, even have a single person looking backwards
---
But I agree. I like to lone wolf it so if I see more than one of my teammates I‚Äôm like ‚Äúthis is where I‚Äôm not gonna be right now‚Äù and just rotate a different way
---
Pistols?
---
Actually I do it with every casual map, house or plain arent fun as well.
---
you have no clue what pay2win even means do you?
---
The same guy that killed me did that glitch when they were on attack
---
Yes but there is no recoil prior to the first shot. ‚ÄúFirst shot recoil‚Äù means recoil from the first shot before the second shot.
---
How many does ps4 have so far?

Im a clash main ( Never glitch abuse i aint a faggot) and i‚Äôd be sad to see her go i have loysbof fun using her legitimately and doing stupid meme shit...

Aim Lab on steam is pretty fun and useful for this kind of thing. Keep an eye out for sensitivity settings as you want to keep them the same as you have in Siege
---
Yeah, but in higher levels people are smart to lookout for traps before they enter which makes kapkan/frost somewhat weak

Did you recorded it?

I agree man i changed my flair back after playing with her a couple days back but it seems i will have to change it back as shes gonna be temporarily removed again sooo yea i also losy the groove i cant even perform well (to a meme standard) with her anymore becuase shes just been gone or if you play her people assume your a glitcher all us clash mains got murdered by this glitch more than any other main group ever has :(

Every hitbox is better than ash's
---
I'm pretty sure dokka might be deaf at this point. She just feels the vibrations from the phones to make her way around
---
The thing with clash is that she is rarely picked for some specific starts where defenders bring their focus to a certain area. Bringing a clash on board, means that defenders will have one less shooter during a gunfight. There is a number of ways to fight against clash and that's where the tactical part and teamplay comes into play. It's up to you and your team to read the situation, adapt and counter it. I know she can be annoying, especially when you're alone against her but she is not someone who breaks the game
---
People always accuse me of hacking (on console) and really it because I have custom controls
---
Would you rather have glitches relatively unknown and used infrequently to ruin some of your games or brought to light, so that Ubisoft is forced to fix them? I do not personally care if he profits off of his videos, while he isn't noble in anyway he makes content people watch. Let DBL Online get ad-revenue and make glitches notable, so that Ubisoft will band-aid them instead of fixing them. 
---
Besides, if the game wasn't a broken mess then his videos wouldn't even have an audience.
---
Sorry to say my efforts are rarely worth recording so it is lost to time.
---
He is the chosen one to enter into the dimension where the hitbox of Ash is located
---
Alibi always seems to catch someone out guaranteed, sometimes I get caught out when I‚Äôm rushing through a door I absolutely shit myself when there‚Äôs just a decoy staring at me xD
---
55 Million headshots is pretty difficult in a game mode that plays fast and is difficult to land headshots period, coupled with the fact that you're playing with two weapons that are hard to hit headshots with at all even when you have the use of attachments.
---
The challenge itself is actually probably right.  55 million is a difficult, but obtainable number for the whole community.  The problem is, myself and the majority of the playerbase don't really want the reward enough to make me want to try to do it.
---
Actually its rooks hand that deflects it. not his lunch box
---
You can deflect Gu mines with your drone
---
They probably built something in after it first started happening to detect if someone's shooting while they're supposed to have the shield up.
---
This begs the question... why were you tossing C4 in the first place?
---
That‚Äôs because PS4 has a far larger playerbase.
---
So ubisoft is suppose to know who you getting queud with ? Comeon man ... The only way to fix this is find teamates .
---
I just use compensater. Idk maybe just go in terrorist hunt and try to get used to the new patterns it didn't take me too long to adapt.
---
Is there a clip of this? I want to see what it looks like
---
They wouldn‚Äôt take this. It clearly phases through it.
---
Kapkan, Tachanka and Finka also have access to those two handguns, tho
---
VAC may not be the best but they sure don't false ban people. We have measures in CS:GO such as Prime Match Making and Trust Factor, which weed out a lot of the hardcore / pleasant players into having a better experience.
---
Just search for a ranked game again, it will put you into the ongoing match.
---
F2 has only vertical recoil so it's easy af to control it... tip 89 has medium vertical recoil and goes a bit to the right around half mag but still quite easy to control...SMG 12 and bearing , well, yeah, are uncontrollable
---
You have to be moving for a long toss. Make sure you've finished accelerating before throwing, I guess
---
Her hitbox is like Herobrine. It's "fixed" with every patch.
---
Trouble is the continued discrepancy between where they are on their screen and where they are on your screen coupled with how tiny her hitbox is to begin with means her hitbox won't be fixed until the latency issue is fixed
---
Uhh, yes, it is your fault that MULTIPLE people are "misunderstanding" you.

Sounds like when your fps in uncapped, your cpu hits 100% before your gpu. Try changing R6 in task manager to "Lower then normal" priority, in order to allow for other processes (such as discord) to be allowed time to execute.
---
I don't

Its the siege community, theres definitely some slow people. I mean, you play the game right? I just assume its the same ones who make bot moves.

yeah but why did you put a c4 next to the kind rook in the first place

Sure it might be unlikely to happen but it‚Äôs still a risk which can be easily avoided

just remove her from the game

They both have their own special charm in my opinion, but maybe that's just because I've grown used to the changes

This was also back when Legion had just come out maybe a week before, so no one really knew any good techniques with him, plus a lot of people were lower level too.
---
Report the players to Sony and Microsoft and to Ubisoft support. Provide evidence so these cases can be investigated further and hopefully charges brought against the perpetrators
---
Damn!
---
Why none on Frost's? Is there a downside to using the extended barrel? I actually always use the silencer because I love it, just curious.
---
because frost shouldn't be engaging long gun fights with his weapon.
---
Also, because you try to make headshots not bodyshots, so recoil is more important
---
That's because her hitbox is so janky she survives your assault unless it's an instant kill.
---
Notice how a headshot on her is 1 hit while as a defender a bodyshot is 3 minimum
---
Hibana
---
Well they couldn't give too much or it messes with the game
---
Yeah watch his old vids he‚Äôs awesome
---
I think it's something to do with how siege prevents textures from clipping through walls, like in that picture the game probably thought that there was a barricade there and so it turned the part of the gun that would have been going thru the wall into a flat jpeg. This happens with players too, like in order to prevent a players legs from sticking through a wall while proning, the bottom half of their body just becomes flat
---
you dont know shit stfu lol
---
Buck = easy recoil
---
Ubi have the achievements to everyone
---
Yes even if it hugs the wall it will keep going on the same direction if the candela rolls off the wall.
---
Can confirm, never peek that LMG when it‚Äôs got the anti-tank muzzle brake on it.
---
I know right? Fuck op and his toxic ass. If he's gonna play like that then he shouldn't play at all. Rainbow Six Siege is all about teamwork and teamkilling is far from teamwork.
---
I never knew they rolled in one direction before watching this üòÇ this will be very useful, thanks macie
---
I subscribed to his channel now, I'll get around to watching his videos, seems like a guy who just wants to have fun on YouTube, sucks to hear how he felt but hopefully he gets better soon
---
Should be, used it a few times.
---
Just came here to comment on how the bacon charm perfectly aligns with the loadout pic of the OTs-03 and looks like smoke rising from the barrel.
---
Impressive.
---
I mean I just bought the game yesterday on sale, and I keep failing the normal missions, looks more fun to play with others
---
No sure, but I was wondering if someone used it by purpose
---
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
---
why is this posted in here so much???
---
just check this sub and youll find an answer like seriously restart your game before you ask the same question for the 100th time..
---
Hold on, has that plastic tub always been destructible?
---
Nice try ubisoft
---
Sorry about the red line my gpu is fucked and sorry I couldn‚Äôt edit it - it was a game bar clip. At least the clip is still kinda cool
---
My frustration comes from the fact that Ubi doesn‚Äôt pay for the best package from BattleEye
---
Who picks up on the other end when you hit the tachanka icon?
---
I'm so bad the only headshots I get are on ash and all the ones I think I deserve I don't get
---
Most realistic thing i have ever seen in R6 lel
---
raw dps it's the secondary smgs. otherwise it's probably the f2
---
Nvm, i verified the game files and it works now, some of them were re-acquired
---
Thanks though!
---
Because if you're making money off of spreading glitches, getting banned won't stop you. You can keep buying copies to share glitches while still turning a profit.   
---
Like I said in another thread - it's easier to ban the distributors, but it's more effective to ban the users to set a precedent that using them isn't a good idea.  
---
Overwatch for example permabans anyone abusing glitches, so you'll rarely find anyone doing it.
---
I got to gold 4 after my placement matches.....got a steady stream of wins then boom you're now talking to a Bronze 1-Silver 4 . Solo queuing isnt a coin flip anymore...its betting on black every God damn time.
---
Yeah I got lucky there haha
---
I mean yeah, it's an sidearm. You know, when you're out of bullets in your primary.
---
I think the reason that happened is because some steam game store their files in multiple places and you just probably missed a few
---
I do this all the with Cav at the open area window on Bank. 9 times out of 10 it works and I have no clue how. Heck, they'll even send a drone through the little hole under the little but they never bother to look to their right.
---
Make sure you accepted the challenge, go in showdown, and use the revolver or bosg to get headshots. Refresh Ubi club after every game to see if it updated
---
Agreed, I'd be willing to have Oregon &amp; Outback in the pool as well, as neither is in PL right now but both are balanced enough to warrant being in. 
---
But like you, I'd happily play clubhouse back to back, alongside a few others, simply because they are very well designed and the game can be played in a variety of ways on maps like that.
---
I haven't played siege very much at all in more than a month. Game health is so poor it makes me wonder if I'm ever coming back, especially after the two new operators were such a design letdown.
---
Spamming special characters could cause the game to freeze and crash
---
It's actually filled with air
---
Yup
---
Why do you get -5 for throwing a c4 at someone
---
The damage trade off is so bloody minor, when we're talking about a gun that fires 740 rpm, that's 12 bullets a second. Comparing the DPS it's maybe a bullet in difference if it's a 3 armour. What's your username for R6?
---
I was in a match where some dude was spamming a bunch of commas and semicolons and it was causing the freezing too.
---
Nice. 417 isn‚Äôt a waste though. The first time I ever used it I got an ace, in the right hands it‚Äôs great.
---
I sort of understand what you‚Äôre saying but most alternate uniforms are easily recognizable and elite skins are easy once you memorize them. I have no idea what you mean with the twitch drone if you have trouble telling it‚Äôs a twitch drone then you have a real problem

I always die to stupid ass reasons and I‚Äôm not good with titles this was the best I could come up with üòÇ
---
Wow wtf my mate at lvl 30 has it on smokes FMJ lol luck is bad :(
---
I did the impossible
---
Then she's just another frag or anchor op with perhaps a situational gadget and mediocre guns as everyone else. I've been playing since end of blood orchid and after I got good fragging or sitting in obj got very boring. I like playing shields and Ubi even said they'd want to do something to make shields more fun to play as. And if they remove clash's shield, that would just be the easy way out. I'd rather have her removed once again to fix the glitch than her being removed entirely.
---
It's not just that the BOSG is hard to headshot with (b/c iron sights and semi-auto) it also that it's a bad idea to aim at someone's head with it. You get nothing but a smaller target. And if you're at long enough range that you don't one-shot you shouldn't be using your BOSG.
---
I feel you

I've gotten one I've contributed.

I was joking lol. Also, why did they release clash when she still has the glitch?

Got the headshot tho

No one tells me what to do bud.

Pick and ban Advice
---
Oof
---
This is why you used shadowplay so you can capture it without worrying.
---
Thank you for the upvote &lt;3
---
We got it people
---
Take it from me, compensator is actually what I use. I aim to have no worries about horizontal recoil with Buck while shooting. Compensator helps me with that. Then all I gotta do is pull down.
---
You're already in debt
---
Yeah my girlfriend did the same thing hehe
---
Banning people who abuse the chat, not glitches
---
made me watch this shit smh
---
What attacker has an FBI cap?
---
Bobby, stop pretending and go to your room.
---
This is true only if they are storing all chat logs. This is a huge amount of data. Even IF they are retaining all chat logs, it is likely they are purging logs older than X days, due to the enormous amount of data.
---
Except only headshots with the shotgun counts.
---
Good luck with that.
---
It's not because you can see it on the overlay
---
And I have a video of it (the videos is way better because she just rushes and I panic kill her and accidently headshot a guy that was behind the mattress)
---
Congrats bro, I‚Äôm about to do almost the exact same for this season. Been Gold consistently for the past 3 seasons and now I think I‚Äôm closer to hitting Plat then ever before.
---
The p10 roni is now the best gun in the game - it can headshot ash
---
That's the tutorial.
---
No, SPQR was a seasonal skin (Para Bellum)

Was a Year 3 season 2 seasonal universal so unfortunately not.

---
What happened?
---
I understand why you don't like Nomad, she annoys me too, but I feel like she is in a balanced place. With an op like Lion and Finka you don't really need to use your head when using the ability because pretty much anytime will help. With Nomad, if you use the airjab just whenever it could potentially do nothing for the team
---
And Ranked uses Bomb sooo... Nice!
---
I wish we got notifications if the people we reported got banned.
---
Spawn rushers are desperate af.
---
true sign of bromance would be if the skins / faces were swapped.
---
I knew bandit players do drugs... C4ing a poor rook like that 
---
Unthinkable.
---
First pro league day I'm going to tune in for. Just getting into the pro scene.
---
He shot them in the body, it doesn‚Äôt count. Just because they were 1hp and you shot them in the body doesn‚Äôt mean you got a one tap.
---
No you did not , you are not termite
---
I lol'd hard!
---
Ok, We were just playing a game on consulate.
---
I rappelled inside the second floor with a fuze I got downed by a tachanka. I could easily be revived by the fuze cuz he killed the tachanka. Then he went to revive me I guess, but he shot me instead of reviving me. After the round I typed "Nice teamkill" and like ten seconds later I got banned for toxicity. For 2 fucking days
---
I tried every possible fix yesterday including that but nothing worked. I reset windows today and it fixed it.
---
At least they didn't shove a pumpkin on his head
---
Maybe Im some sort of madman, but I use suppressor on a lot of my weapons. Works well for me so far
---
Riveting
---
Needs to be higher. ü§£
---
Jk. Play at your comfort level.
---
Agreed
---
This keeps happing to me on console every time I log in all my operators weapons everything‚Äôs reset plz fix this Ubi it‚Äôs also on Xbox plz someone give me a fix
---
YOU WILL SHOOT ANYTHING THAT MOVES
---
but sir what if we frie-
---
I SAID ANYTHING
---
Perfection.
---
you can't get banned that fast for chat toxicity. it was for something else.
---
True
---
It actually is, I just got Rainbow on pc for 1 week.
---
Im playing w/bearing only till I buy lion...
---
Gridlock 100%.   
---
Nokk is useless beyond low level play.  If you are facing against compotent opponents she is outclassed in every engagement pushing into a defender who has the position advantage whilst having the same or better guns then her.   
---
She is deisgned around exploiting the enemy team when they make mistakes and thats a bad design.

[Chat Symbol Exploit Ban Wave on 7/10](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cb90um/chat_symbol_exploit_ban_wave_on_710/)
---
I started playing within the last year &amp; it's great. Just play ranked, once you hit gold it's not too toxic.
---
Exactly what i was saying in the party if he cant get to diamond by him self obviously he isnt good enough to play up there
---
They should ban people for using it, but not fix the bug. Then just let natural selection take its course.
---
Personally using the pistol
---
Yes, thank you!
---
pro tip, watch YT videos that show you where to put your mirrors in every map.
---
Oh cool still not worth coming back though
---
Why would they buff Dok?
---
Ban time depends on the context, some people get permed others get varying time periods depending on their total offences.
---
He's my most played with like 28 hrs lol
---
You couldn't have. You did something else that DID get you banned, but you won't tell us.
---
Ops are situational most of the time, but these are always good picks. Defense: Echo, Maestro, Lesion, J√§ger. Attack: depends a lot on map and site, but of course thatcher, if you solo queue, I‚Äôd bring nomad. No attacker is too strong currently imo.
---
Dont move from spawn. Cant loose the thermal imaging if you never move. Or, dont play him. Seige is a movement based game. To force a player to stand still is basically giving them a death sentence
---
Yes. Lovely. please implement.
---
Why'd they make it different on each system seems weird to me
---
Nukk
---
Yeah but if ur using only flash its playable but i like to put myself in suffer so im using the holo( no offense to holo)
---
Well it could be an interesting way to bring her into the loop of a meta using drones and cameras also shes the only one that really made sense for that ability
---
&gt;Hitbox on Rook‚Äôs plate is still better than ash‚Äôs hitbox
---
[here's the aftermath](https://youtu.be/meMtfDtfej4)
---
Thx

Welcome to casual solo que.

And now it's posted here. We've come full circle
---
K, great great great :)   
---
Now with overtly racist/neonazis typing slurs in chat please?
---
I have a buddy that runs that headgear and the bright yellow outbreak uniform. We call it the Shortbus outfit.
---
Ahhh, still sounds awesome bro good work!
---
I showed you my prickly cactus, please respond
---
‚ÄúOK, so when Dokk uses her ability it should make Mozzie useless‚Äù
---
Shes already meta and frankly very strong
---
Strat roulette
---
just remove clash lol
---
Thanks! That will help when I buy her!
---
Hibana or Mira.
---
Entire point of the game is to get better but hopefully this ban wave they were talking about gets rid of this. And hopefully smurfs as well I think it‚Äôs dumb to claim diamond on a smurf. That‚Äôs just me though
---
[10 seconds later](https://youtu.be/meMtfDtfej4)
---
i'm sorry but your aim tho
---
stfu cringe normy
---
he is total trash now, forget you ever knew him
---
*sigh*
---
happened to me the second time today. don't know the reason, but just restart
---
[cause im scary](https://youtu.be/meMtfDtfej4)
---
I'd drink those
---
Is this John Wick 4?
---
Thanks! I considered Hibana before posting but I think almost everyone says Mira!
---
Does that factor in the 25 million smurf accounts?
---
Pretty much ya haha maybe to balance it she has to hack his camera to get access to those drones again or even only getting access to one of the drones
---
Can I learn this power?
---
Ela strong? LOL. Cant get kills with that pos anymore medium to long range, shes fucking useless and there are better roamers. Literally no point in her playing her useless ass.
---
You don't get banned just for that. You're not telling us the whole story.
---
I've gotten people to ragequit with well placed traps and the shotgun
---
Hit you with that ban wave
---
Us console boys are completely fucked. Have fun PC players
---
He probably won't get banned since this was a game bug, not his fault
---
Haha, what? For those operators there's another step, like bringing a Twitch or a Thatcher. Of any soft destructor from below or above. I guess you entirely missed the point.
---
Is this cuz of the chat exploit or...
---
Blitz is my secondary main after Thatcher since Operation Health and always has been. You're not alone, mate
---
I see u with that reverse friendly fire, you just could've called and ended it all
---
Well take your ban and learn to do better in the future. People want to play the game, not get cussed at.
---
The whole R6 community mistakes  hurtboxes for hitboxes.
---
I figured, cause only casual and bronze can produce apes like that.
---
I will burn that into my brain, must lean, lean is love, lean is life.
---
To be fair they said they wanted some crossover of gadgets so there isn‚Äôt any ‚Äúmust have‚Äù ops for the game. But when the other option is obviously drastically better then for sure it needs fixing
---
Summary:
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.
---
It's not the point. The point is that the game is shifting from tactical gameplay which required certain steps to do something to a game where one click can influence a round.
---
r/cursedr6
---
"DON'T GRAB IT"
---
And you missed everyone elses point by refusing to accept that maverick is in fact quite easy to counter. So I guess we're even :)
---
Some people get terrified by the smg11 recoil, it‚Äôs really not that bad, I‚Äôve spawnpeeked with it and I‚Äôm on console, I think most just don‚Äôt ever give it a chance
---
Deep Fake
---
Turn off hud
---
Hardware or ip ban for these please
---
I use muzzle break for her F2
---
Good news! I reinstalled it and it seems to be working fine now! If anything else happenes i will be sure to post it on here, thanks for your time :D

Hello Notime6_6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cbkwb9/fml/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It's illegal to use 3rd party hacks and to ddos. So no it's not "just a preference." You're a waste of oxygen
---
The twitch drone is probably sitting there laughing his ass off.
---
‚ÄúI GOT ONE OF THEM TO KILL THE OTHER, WHAT A RUSE‚Äù
---
Holy shit, they banned a lot of people
---
woOooOooOooOOoooOoOOooOoooOOoOOoOOOooOoOsh
---
Thanks for taking the time to answer me
---
I feel like they all have different roles and aspect, but Lesion is the strongest pick overall. Kaid and Alibi seem fun, but Alibi‚Äôs weapon looks incredible, and her gadget so helpful
---
Nomad looks so powerful, especially in post plant. I think my choice would be Nomad and Alibi, if I only have to pick two.
---
I referred to this as a beginner:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9dk0pm/cynibots\_attachment\_guide\_20\_recommended/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/9dk0pm/cynibots_attachment_guide_20_recommended/)
---
Yeah, nice try fam.
---
Ash should‚Äôve died..... you can hear the bullets coming out.....
---
Agreed. Like I get the point, but I don‚Äôt care what idiot gets banned.
---
Suppressors are good on some guns like the mp5, it‚Äôs pretty situational but it shouldn‚Äôt be ignored
---
You serious?
---
Looks identical to a golf.
---
Man, VW is slacking.
---
No one cares if it‚Äôs secure area
---
OP is the type of guy to buy 12 cans of soda instead of one cause its cheaper when he originally planned to buy one
---
Basically sometimes it‚Äôs good to neautral peak but most times it‚Äôs better to lean plus it moves your head a bit so slight less chance of a headshot
---
Beat me to it
---
Oh nah I'm good
---
ok but can we appreciate how much time he took to shoot the cameras
---
You know the old meta was muzzle break almost every gun because if you can master bursting you can nail anyone ;)
---
Why cant i ever get in games like this.I've been heard breathing through 3 walls and a hatch

Man, good and knowledgeable hype men make any set hype. To this day, Tasty Steve of the Tekken community is still my favorite commentator. 
---
He learns the players, he knows the game, his calls are spot on and his hype is immeasurable. Dude just loves Tekken, and makes it fun as hell for anyone to watch.
---
But, if JR (Jim Ross, the Cowboy hat commentator) came to eSports, hype levels would reach critical mass. We don't deserve his "Bah GAWD"s.
---
Quick question, I had friends who did this in a custom game with only me, them, and sometimes others who were okay with the glitch happening. They never did it in ranked and never did it to completely crash the game even in a custom game. Will they be banned?
---
On vacation xD
---
DUDE NO SPOILERS FFS

We literally all are.
---
Once I saw that little universal symbol I already knew I was going to get plasma pink... At least it's not the unicorn charm

oof, I did it once. Hopefully it's short.

I‚Äôm not saying you lol I‚Äôm saying it will just encourage more people to cheat. People cheat for nothing already. Why wouldn‚Äôt they?
---
Don‚Äôt main a scummy op then
---
Nice. Too bad your team mates skipped out on you.
---
Open task manager, make sure the battleeye Service has closed.
---
It is now posted
---
Bro my friend does that all the time, he's so dumb
---
Yep that‚Äôs typical siege for ya
---
Traps on traps on traps.
---
There's 2 options, 1 was already written above, (restart the game) the second is that you are screwed and r6 lost your save. It means all of your attachments will still be removed after the res, you have to equip 1 attachment to any op, then suicide in a th or situation, this way, siege will create a new save file. Both happened to me
---
It seems her head's hit box is very small / non-existent
---
Too bad you never see this shit on console
---
Most were 2 days.  
---
Some for 7.  
---
Some for 15.  
---
Some permanently.
---
It all scaled depending on how often a player used the exploit.
---
I misread that as Montagne and was so confused when I saw the Jackal gameplay lol
---
Well I don‚Äôt see a problem with that?
---
Nice! Get that gahbage outta here!
---
Dude, you cheat on the game. That's not "a way to play", it's cheating and ruining it for the rest of us. We don't need to make an argument because you made it for us. You're either 12 years old or retarded.. maybe both.
---
I've ran into this multiple times. If I remember right turn off and unplug  both your computer and router the plug them both back in and restart. If that's not it I'm sorry that's what worked for me.
---
that looks like a neck shit to me dood, fake news
---
Bikini is scared
---
How exactly? I‚Äôm sure if this was ever implemented anyway they would polish it the correct way to get it to work
---
Yes and no. If the defender spawn peaks and manages  to pick off a thatcher or someone crucial to the attack it‚Äôs worth it. I see where you‚Äôre coming from but high risk high reward like mentioned above.
---
Only change I want is fall damage to be applied properly when I fling someone off the bathroom balcony on house.

I lost my plat game because of this gay exploit

Echo is as well one click change the whole game when stopping a defuse u know....

he must have been constantly abused it thats why he got perma banned. (over 10 times) epi tweeted about it. I'm sick of those ppl that abusing exploit and making the game absolutely nightmare for all.

Thank the whoof?

Why'd you cut out the part where you blew them up?
---
I had one pack and got a cowboy hat for ash pretty lucky
---
They said it couldn't be done
---
Same
---
I never blew them up
---
Blood splatter is server side, so there is a bit of lag vs the bullets that you‚Äôre shooting at the instant the splatter appears. There was a yellow high ping warming early in the clip, so it‚Äôs quite possible that it was registering an earlier bullet in the spray.
---
Typical pc players.
---
Oh, I didn't have the luck to see it live on a match.
---
Why are they doing these massive ban waves?
---
Operation Health
---
It's actually her face because she was peeking to my left. Anyway, I got the headshot tho
---
You can only trash talk and can't provide a valid argument and I do not cheat anymore so calm down, and yes it is a play style to cheat as people find it fun to piss people off and teleport and headshot people, ask a cheater they will tell you and I'm telling you now, cheating is fun. And if you think I'm just bad at the game say whatever makes you feel happy, I'm a plat II player on both my accounts if you want to check, my smurf is RooksBigAss.

That shit was great, i was watching and explaining to friends that don't play R6 what was happening
---
Why does that sound like a Micah bell line
---
Who‚Äôs shotgun?
---
That guy probably listening to music with 0 game sound.
---
Great value John Wick 4
---
I thought this was in honor of MainCaptainYolo at first.
---
Did the commentators say anything about it?
---
Lol, good.
---
Wait that‚Äôs sick
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt want underperforming teammates on my team.
---
My account has been dormant since about a week after this season so I hope it didn‚Äôt get banned for something stupid.
---
Yeah, not my proudest gamer moment.
---
Nope
---
There were 2 glitches, one was the on you were talking about where you typed a ton of characters in chat like /,&amp;,etc, and the other was where you filled the chat with ‚Äú and it crashed everyone‚Äôs game.
---
Honestly i just play her as a normal operator. One really good time to activate is when doing the stealth breach on a door. Just hit the bottom right of a barricaded door and then hit it again below the original hit. This gives u space to crawl through without all the noise of breaching. Its hard to explain with text so definitely look up a tutorial. Otherwise just cameras, open areas, and places where you know there are roamers.
---
 Ye- if i restart the game everything went well again
---
They just want to think they are better than everyone else
---
My friend got banned for this but he isn't toxic. Apparently it's 48 hrs.
---
üòû
---
God ducking dammit
---
So does this just list the random people banned while you‚Äôre playing? Even people you arnt playing with?
---
Theres like a .0000001% chance that they can get your ip through the server.  They almost certainly just hit the server they are connected to.
---
Homeboy already has 4 accounts then he just uses those 4 accounts to say good things about his one account. I‚Äôm sure they have buddies that do the same
---
&gt;I got banned for 2 days becasue i did &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; twice
---
even though they accounted for people trying it and only banned people who did it more than 10 times?
---
[source](https://twitter.com/itsepi/status/1148754073996406784?s=21)
---
lol
---
I had chat full with it and the game never once crashed.
---
He's probably on the 2g network
---
That‚Äôs the French one I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
To bad they can‚Äôt ban all these Smurf‚Äôs
---
I tried that but mine is still doing it. I know its not a huge problem but its still annoying
---
Nah he will stop playing now
---
Yeah sorry I did the same thing switched from ps4 to pc had to buy all the ops again
---
I had the chat full with it and it never once crashed. Just kept doing the effect.
---
its not that he‚Äôs situational, it‚Äôs that his gadget is about as useful as Vigil‚Äôs. having to stand still in a shooter without respawns, especially in close quarters where Warden would be, is a death sentence. I love playing him, but they need to either let him move or make his gadget a passive
---
Had season pass and everything
---
No really its hard to find a smurf because elo is based on win/loss. If they implemented a way to gain elo based on personal skill such as headshot percentage, kd, etc, with the win/loss then that's a way to weed out smurfs.
---
Yea there were some that were immune to the glitch.
---
Is that just where you don't get matched with them again? I don't think I have ever gotten the same bad teammate more than once.
---
ubi Banned all Players tho spammed "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;" this in chatt to make the Server lag ...
---
but the banns are gone be for 2weeks if u only done it 2-3 Times :¬£
---
It's not immediate. Once they're done with the ban waves, then they'll move to resetting MMR.
---
This is hilarious.
---
Commando pro against that bandit
---
I have the power üòà
---
√ã
---
Did you do the chat spam/character glitch?
---
Nice
---
Honestly though. He's so situational that when a time comes that you finally need to use his gadget, you forget it exists.
---
a good programmer will have the two modules completely separated and unable to interfere with each other this clearly a poor design decision by the guy or guys who worked on that regardless of QA noticing or not. two separate modules that have no business interacting with each other should not cause problems to each other. that's like your browser making your music player freeze ... it makes no sense and one of them did something terribly wrong
---
Maybe the problem is me. I should start to learn french to avoid that problem. Thanks for helping me out of my misery Kappa
---
R.I.P
---
Not all DDoS attacks use botnets.
---
Let me know if you find out. Started out Gold and now I'm Bronze because I get constantly kicked from matches. I've uninstalled battle eye and the game. Turned off any virus protection/windows defender. Still nothing.
---
"I lost the kid...."
---
Old Hereford was dog shit.  Whoever had control of the only interior stairs won every time.
---
2 soup cans and a string. Save you about 197 dollars.
---
that's why bandit is so sad about it getting removed
---
Ouch
---
Makes us more marketable. Dab.
---
100% agree
---
They all have godlike aims that not even the best aimbot can match with.
---
Didn't get banned all is good
---
It‚Äôs possible but it‚Äôs really hard
---
Furries deserves to get banned
---
wonder if his bot friends kicked him
---
I‚Äôm so happy that there‚Äôs finally pc clips on this subreddit
---
That is very me likey
---
They most likely arent doing any dossing themselves, they are most certainly using some ddosding services.
---
Should make a new map called memorial where loads of tombstones and walls are filled with names of the accounts that get banned
---
Well...ya see...me and the boys, only knife. Sorry mate
---
Lucky man, I got permad on my only account. Rip 700 hours, every op, and plat.
---
Have you tried switching your data center by making a custom game? That‚Äôs how I know most people change their server
---
Bro, no one falls for that run-out, only newcomers and noobs. I always spawn there and died to it on year 1, since then I ALWAYS crouch there waiting for a easy kill, always works.
---
Right! And it could be something simple on console like holding Y
---
Me likey too, thank you!
---
You spun the wrong way lol
---
The only way they‚Äôll get your IP on Xbox is if they‚Äôre in the same party chat as you. Party chat is P2P (peer-to-peer) which allows everyone to see each other‚Äôs IP. When playing Siege you use dedicated servers so they can‚Äôt access your IP. So don‚Äôt invite rando‚Äôs to your parties and don‚Äôt go to rando‚Äôs parties and you‚Äôll be fine
---
Holey that ash said üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If someone‚Äôs injured you won‚Äôt headshot them, cool
---
Actual effort? Most of the times it‚Äôs rng
---
restart the game that fixes it
---
VACation?
---
I'll keep ya posted
---
You can tell it‚Äôs pc because there is no frame drop
---
I'm talking about spawn rushing in general on every map
---
This is my religion

Not once did I say shit about lgbtq. I didn't say you were against nor with. I frankly don't give a damn if you support them or not. That's your own personal life. What I was stating is that people get upset over others calling them names when in reality its just a game and people are gonna say what they want. That being said. You are still toxic af. Go look at all your prevent comments on all the other subreddits.
---
You get what you deserve for exploiting
---
Well you still gotta put forth effort to get dicked on by rng
---
What?
---
People use online ddossing services.
---
This isn't the 90s...
---
It's still worth it for the R6 credits to buy an operator you don't own
---
Someone should slow it down to get all the names so we can have a wall of shame.
---
This is clearly a mistake. The patch notes state that Lesion's Gu Mines were supposed to take on Echo's Yokai cloaking mechanics, but the opposite seems to have happened.

True friendship is born in the battlefield. Specially when there's a sweaty bandit main tricking on the other side of the god damn wall

Yes but it‚Äôs only $5 worth of credits isn‚Äôt it?
---
Very low dpi/large mousepad. Run around like a headless chicken and flick. You'll move fast enough to survive people holding angles 90% of the time, and you'll startle everyone else into bad aim
---
To make an omelette ya gotta crack some eggs
---
There's FairFight on console and if they consider DDoSing cheating then they could ban those people.
---
Im torn between opposing frivolous bans, and opposing the toxic community
---
Hasn‚Äôt unlocked him yet
---
Hol up, Military base wifi?
---
This is amazing that this happening right before i get my siege set up for pc. Keyboard feels a little since i tried it at a friends house to try the differences between controller vs keyboard.
---
Did you hear that u/PurpleSquad soawnpeek? No dignity.
---
That also applies to every run out, attacker‚Äôs have the best weapons, they have the advantage, I never see anyone dying to spawn peeks on high ranks. Look at your downvotes, you are wrong.
---
If it's the pass for this season you'll be good with receiving the new ops. Also, don't worry $70 is a joke compared to buying the game like 3 or 4 times ü§£
---
What are you even talking about? The only public console hacks for the PS4 work up to version 5.05. Even then, you can't just brick for running HEN.
---
Although I'm not too keen on the XBone hacking scene, I'm sure their situation is similar.
---
Not enough people playing the mode, and the weapons aren't exactly ripe for easy headshots.
---
I thought it was gonna be a meme video :(
---
A constantly scrawling wall that plays a sad honk from a clown horn for each name.
---
Good clutch, I personally wouldn't have peeked the guy in the hatch, but it worked out in your favor. GG
---
It‚Äôs been happening all day
---
Why do you care if people want to take this game seriously? If that‚Äôs what they find enjoyment in, then who cares?
---
The Roni has garbage damage, you were hitting body shots, you may have lagged
---
Still don‚Äôt understand why we can‚Äôt have the animation on it‚Äôs own
---
I require cock and ball torture right now or I will die of prostate cancer arghargharghaegharghe
---
You can buy operators with r6 coins tho???? And everything else in the game that you can buy with renown???
---
/u/Its_Epi think we could get a total ban count in a while, like we did for Skull Rain?
---
I know right ? 
---
Stacks are a second issue of this game
---
This joke would ‚ÄúSilence‚Äù any person
---
This one specifically was during Team One vs Faze but every match had at least one ban wave I'm pretty sure
---
Damn I got a two day ban.
---
Some player was doing constantly in our game and doing it right as we breached/they breached and it was a close game and it started fucking us. So I google searched how to do it and fought fire with fire. Should have turned the other cheek and not did it
---
Mine always say prove it
---
I actually appreciate it, thank you for helping the newbie better than I could
---
I don't know how you didn't trigger that first Frost mat on your way up the stairs - even if you missed it then, when your model shifted her feet during the aiming animation it should've caught you.
---
I mean personally I don't care. I care about WL ratio. For some reason on console though people will take a high KD and a terrible WL over vice versa any day
---
Yes and often their mic is on for the whole team to listen to their music...
---
I play console and flash hider on Mavericks full auto rifle is nasty. Definitely feels way more stable than comp for me
---
Depending on the services running on it, entirely possible. A DOS doesnt have to be a flood, its a denial of service attack. A single packet can be a DOS if it causes the target to crash/lockup/slowdown.
---
That happens to me as well sometimes. It‚Äôs annoying.
---
Instead of fixing your game, you just press Ban Everyone button again
---
Mostly joking but really even if a yokai was there i couldnt see it over the pictures blur
---
That is a man that has nothing to lose

I‚Äôve had great success holding garage door on chalet with her. It‚Äôs what finally got me Plat.
---
Bruh this has been going on all day lol
---
I tried to but the ‚ÄùRun as admin‚Äù but the option won‚Äôt even come up, any idea why?
---
So not a single person banned for affecting gameplay...instead for "Toxic Behavior." What the hell is that?
---
If you have a credit card or crypto you can rent a botnet for DDOSing.
---
He‚Äôs just too anime to beat.
---
Man I hate playing Chalet, it‚Äôs just so unbalanced with hardly any viable sites and lack of rotations making the map overall attacker favored. I‚Äôll have to try that out.
---
this is minceraft class of rare
---
"I hope y'all don't run into those type of ppl"
---
What the fuck do you think this is? Warframe? You can't play siege without running into toxicity every other match
---
There's still cheaters it just requires far more effort.
---
Haha
---
i only tryed it out a few times i had never abused it only my teamates
---
i only tried it out a few
---
You got banned for telling the truth?
---
Kaid
---
can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs worse: the enemy or your internet
---
I believe that local Terrorist Hunt isn't a thing anymore, sadly.
---
Safest bet are Local Custom Games, but I don't know how exactly Ubisoft cracked down on this issue.
---
Does anyone know whether or not Ubisoft actually stores Chats like e.g. Wargaming does? Guess I'll file a GDPR request just out of curiosity soon.
---
Should of been longer
---
Team oNe vs Faze 42:51 into the video posted on the Rainbow Six Esports YouTube channel if you want to watch it for yourself
---
It‚Äôs just a good toxicity ban wave, not cheaters, just mean people.
---
r/thatHappened
---
It‚Äôs the same with using an ACOG on every gun that can have one. Even though there‚Äôs a few guns that are better without them Mavericks M4 is a good example, the kick of the recoil is too high even with something to reduce it. The red dot works much better
---
So I have been working a lot recently.  What happened?
---
Wjen i had my ps4, i always wanted to play but i would always be turned off by that weird looking snesitivity thing, anyways, glad someone can stand it
---
Tank
---
yea we were playing in copper just messing about so the other team was happy to do it
---
PC can be very volatile. Could be a number of things.
---
Updating all BIOS and GPU drivers is usually my first step when I have issues, but it looks like you have done this already.
---
Try googling your specific issue along with your GPU and CPU to see if there is a connection.
---
Lol at low level any accomplishments Nokk make can be done by other fraggers and with better results.
---
Can somebody explain what happened?

Lol I saw this one

I mean of course there's always gonna be toxicity. But I haven't had a prob that major before. Regularly, it's a fuck you/off but not this bad.

They banned according to the amount of usage.  Some got perma-banned, the lightest offense was 2 day ban, with a few variations in-between.  How long was your ban?
---
People can say the nword with a 1 on the end and be fine
---
After seeing the sens and dpi of professionals mine looked off since they all have way lower sens then i have but have the same dpi yet mine feels slow (dont know where to really post this).

They did that intentionally.

The blip knocked out half of all bums of Rainbow Six Siege, love for the world to see. (2019, colorized)

I like everything except getting rid of the seasonal charms because they're just getting better. If Ubi had kept the old charms for year 4, I would back this idea 100%, but because of the new charms I feel more like 90%. Great idea though!
---
Probably end up having alot of bugs in it

‚ÄúHmm, I wonder what that defusing noise is.‚Äù
---
It was a Glaz too so I was quite surprised I got that

In a fair fight I consider it part of the game but when you‚Äôre cheating it‚Äôs pretty toxic. It‚Äôs like beating someone in a wheelchair in basketball and gloating

You can check my work here, there is others operator reveal [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCwjXnEhoy8UIbx4wA4u\_g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtCwjXnEhoy8UIbx4wA4u_g)

Is it only back on console tho
---
or perhaps you got banned for spamming chat?
---
It‚Äôs the showdown mode
---
what is claymore
---
ela has no ass. legitimately anyone who thinks she has more ass than IQ has never actually seen ass. I'm pretty sure Alibi actually has the fattest in game rn, if not it's cav
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just a bug
---
Yes retsart your game its cuz of showdown
---
I agree. Maybe we could also use guns from dlc CTU‚Äôs if we have the dlc.
---
Worse than plane? Lol
---
I‚Äôm guessing the copper was being boosted by his friends? If that‚Äôs the case that‚Äôs just dumb
---
They've been bamboozled
---
Oh....
---
Good art
---
this was a rollercoaster of emotions
---
I like the idea a lot, sound really seems to be an untouched part of gameplay that Ubi could do a lot with.
---
We've at least got https://www.reddit.com/r/VAC_Porn/ if you like watching this stuff go down and seeing the salt from people getting banned.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
The copper is a smurf of a plat, and he is the one boosting the others.
---
I should have just said who do you all think is the thiccest
---
Even more impressive, good shooting
---
fun wise? holding 3rd floor wasnt fun
---
He was however the only on his team to stay I'll give him that. Most of his team left twice that game.
---
We played all of that content repeatedly at launch, why again now? Nostalgia I guess, maybe they should add a game mode like that just for a limited time, instead of adding it permanently.
---
Aye congratulations it‚Äôs a celebration
---
Well . how long are you banned ?
---
Yeah they just do it for memes every now and then, it‚Äôs statistically worse but if you really like them then you do you, I didn‚Äôt mean to come off as rude on first comment
---
Idk, I liked it.
---
YES. There are also times that people look at my kid and vote kick me before round 1 has started. I am level 14 so I‚Äôm not that great.
---
Vigil
---
I'll have to give it a try as well, I usually use her AR which is really good
---
your memory is failing you, try to think a bit about 3rd floor
---
At lead begin rolling out some. Maybe don‚Äôt put all of them in, but maybe year 1-2 operators. Also give them the new gadgets like cameras, impacts, and claymores
---
Suppressor on Sledge so you can down people and finish them with that sweet sweet hammer kill.

How are you this lucky. I get wall banged by a guy shooting at someone else.
---
# I've seen this raw strength only once before.
---
I'm so sorry you have the issue and that's what I'm talking about! On PS4 that's so common. It's a great game once you get better but that climb to get to that better point is such a struggle because of the community
---
Are you sure you're honest with us ? or you got banned for spamming something in chat ?
---
Ah, ok. Thanks for explaining
---
Quick question, why was i banned for 15 days? I did use the symbol, but i never used it to completely crash or sway a game. i only used it as a joke to troll my friends while they were aiming or before a match. i Never abused it in such a way to sway a game. ive even lost matches due to this??? and got 15 days?? Nice one. maybe ban the clash abusers or deployable shield abusers or IQ abusers get a ban. Smooth developing.

DDoS stands for distributed denial of service. The ELI5 is somebody's service gets flooded with so much traffic that it takes too long to respond to anything.
---
A reddit hug of death is an accidental DDoS
---
Some games' multiplayer services expose the IP addresses of other players in a match.  If you have somebody's IP address you can send traffic to them. If you send them a lot of traffic you can clog up their entire bandwidth with that traffic until the game thinks they have disconnected, and drops them from the game. Until the DDoS stops the target's internet service is effectively dead.
---
Also the gold's getting boosted by the plat 1
