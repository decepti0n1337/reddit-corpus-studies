I agree somewhat. But he'd just need some tweaks. No iron sights, a slower scope time than BB, and no frags and limit the g18 to burst and I think he'd be ok in that situation. 
---
and?
---
You‚Äôre everywhere. 
---
Big deal...
---
calm down. if you used the search function and looked at the 3000 posts about this you‚Äôd see that you‚Äôll get the renown for it. you‚Äôd rather just whine and complain though. you‚Äôll get your renown. also why does it matter. if you have all the ops then renown isn‚Äôt as important as it is for those without all the ops. quit acting entitled. they didn‚Äôt have to give anything 
---
I remember that. Wasn‚Äôt China‚Äôs restrictions the reason they were removing those?
---
It's pretty cool. 
---
I like the ideas, but I feel the sniper that can pierce reinforced walls will be a wallhacker's vest friend.
---
Thank you
---
In terms of gameplay obviously. I‚Äôm not in the ‚ÄúRainbow 6 is realistic‚Äù camp at all; we had alien zombies ffs.

I‚Äôm on Xbox dude.

The first 10-15 shots are easily controllable once you get a general idea of the pattter.  After that the gun jumps all over.  So you just burst fire another 10-15 shots if necessary.
---
How about they just don‚Äôt say it ?
---
You‚Äôre one of those people that drop to copper instead of playing against the same skill level. Just to show off that you beat new/ inexperienced players. That‚Äôs sad

Your CPU is a ***MASSIVE*** bottleneck to your GPU.

What res is this it looked super stretched

Second time of you saying that)

nah b, usually my games are much worse

I said that because he said lion is a must pick in pro league. He can‚Äôt be a must pick since he‚Äôs banned.

Don‚Äôt forget to pick up the uncompressed versions too, here they are: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zkqs0w44zhrye6e/AABFbZHslywAzodIiQVL9ZV2a?dl=0

Wait what? Why did you kill your downed teammate?
---
4:3 90 FOV :)
---
Only the ones from that season/year.
---
Only the ones from the current year.
---
Thanks my dude, keep up the good work
---
I only said that because he said lion is a must pick in pro league. He can‚Äôt be a must pick if he‚Äôs banned. I‚Äôm not complaining that he‚Äôs banned. 
---
It looks 4:3 with lower resolution. I may be wrong, but the stretching is explained by 4:3 monitors.
---
Well Pericote thinks it is, as I‚Äôve talked to them on Instagram about their art being reposted on here, they say as long as theirs credit they don‚Äôt mind too much but if there isn‚Äôt she doesn‚Äôt want it
---
Idk it could be something with the consoles audio output as well but I doubt it 
---
This explains so much I play 16:10 90FOV I might try 4:3 go back to my roots tomorrow 
---
I call him bill.

Its Peri Pericote on instagram

I‚Äôm sorry people bitch about game breaking bugs in a AAA title, but people have to know about a bug for it to be fixed.
---
Speed up their deployment speed and make them see their traps through the walls like Lesion does now. Or go for opposite - keep deployment speed the same or even slower it but make their traps harder to see.
---
I swear to god buck has the sexiest rifle in the game 
---
So you think it would be too overpowered?
---
One of them is getting a kill with a breaching charge. Don't know about the others since i already unlocked them.

Nope. I ran around like a chicken trying to find it. I had a valk cam starring at it but as you could see in the clip, my teammates were saying GG in chat and waiting for my death spectating me. For the sake of reddit,  I "Clutched" sort of. I'm just gonna blame it on the randoms.
---
Ahh, that explains it lol. 
---
It's 4:3 on a 16:9 monitor at 1080P. I can't go back to native. Gives be a headache. 
---
This happened to me but I was with a 4 man and the guy I killed got kicked for being a dumbass and going to peak in the middle of the chalet window üëå
---
Mission impossible 4, I immediatly thought about this when reading ¬´¬†screen¬†¬ª
---
Although VERY cool, and I‚Äôve wanted a bolt action sniper in the game for quite awhile, I think they could just give Glaz a bolt action as an alternate primary and not have a character that can shoot through walls lol. 
---
The chameleon idea is very cool, but I think would need to be able to be shot out via twitch or have a certain effect to it that you need to give it a second glance to see but make it noticeable enough to get rid of it (if you know what I mean).
---
Defenders who are behind a Reinforced Wall take 50% less damage from the bullet
---
If it‚Äôs far away from the objectives with no roamer patrols nearby... why not just go past it?
---
cheer up [heres ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4) a good video
---
It works.
---
Nice ideas in concept, but they'd be trash in game. I have seen the concept of being able to shoot through reinforced walls before on the reddit and I always disagree regardless of the downsides attached to it. In the current meta, there are a million and one ways to remove the ability of a defender to have agency over the situation (jackal, lion, doki, blackbeard, blitz, glaz, ect.) 
---
What am I supposed to do after I am jackal tracked and the attackers also have a Fornheart that is able to kill me potentially across map regardless of how I position myself? What is the  counterplay? The last thing this game needs is more overly powerful attacking operators. 
---
I am less able to give an opinion on chamelion. I think she'd be very weak, as the current "false info" op is hilariously easy to counter if you are even slightly on the ball. 
---
Keep trying my dude. 
---
Imo, this is a lot of changes on top of his core design, and would make him slightly too versatile. This would also encourage gameplay which isn't considered overly "defensive" (window peeking with a head shield).
---
I tried to stop angle campers by going clash and waiting, but as soon as they stoped I pulled out my gun and Frost ran out of obj and got caught in my bullet when they peeked again
---
at least there's not too many "Wow attention to details by Ubisoft" comments.
---
Bombers, nitro cells are barbed wire. So annoying
---
What about only giving him 3  special armor piercing bullets, and then after that he‚Äôs just a regular sniper? Would still make him a counter to those operators, without making them useless picks
---
I did this today it's really fun to do.  Hold a mira or deployable shield and spam crouch
---
You gotta click reply in order to reply to comments.

I outlined the difference. It isn't the same. Modern swastika usage is for a singular purpose. Modern hammer and sickle usage is for a multitude of reasons, a minority of which revolve around murderous authoritarian states. 
---
you clearly did not understand what i said. i‚Äôm not arguing it anymore or explaining it again. if you don‚Äôt like friendly fire then go play call of duty

Oh thanks my dude

there's no need to be a fucking dick to people, it's why this community is so toxic and shit.

Y‚Äôall forgot about maestro and hibana( lasso don‚Äôt know how to spell) maestros cam can destroy the pellets
---
Yeah but he's glaze who can make holes 2c through walls that r reinforced how much damage do u think his gun would do could it use a suppressor
---
IDK, Hatch ladder seems pretty balanced
---
Nice plug.
---
And deal with hackers?
---
‚Äúok‚Äù me one more time Mr.Yeeto
---
hacking is using software outside the game to cheat in some way. this involves no outside software. anyone can do it. 
---
I hope you get banned for using mouse and keyboard on console piece of shit. Fuck you
---
i know how it works. someone else in this thread even said it. anyone can do it. it involves no outside software. literally anyone can do it.

The game's in an awful spot right now. Crouch spamming, OP ops, Ubi taking a while to do anything about all the problems. All we can do is hope they get more on the ball in the future.

Happens to me every defense, ill be holding 2 angles crouching in a corner, right when i peek and fire someone has to come in my line of fire then i have to stop firing and i get killed -_-
---
Is it me or does this shower look like it is in ground and is just a white void
---
The shop says it's going away today.
---
Note that all headshots are instant kills
---
That would be great! Are you on Xbox one?
---
Some people actually just prefer controller for some reason. My friends refuses to play CS:GO without a controller because he just finds it more comfortable than a Keryboard and Mouse.
---
It all rid on that ash not killing you
---
What lmao, i love Glaz, when i got lucky and got 2 headshots my teammates accused me of smurfing lol, ive started playing like 4 days ago. 
---
Wait a sec what‚Äôs the discord

I need that

Literally did this 2 hours ago...

It's bugged. They said they are going to fix it. Don't worry, I didn't get mine yet either

Punch the bear?

But 10 x 0 is still 0
---
Idea with kable: what if his cables would still stun if you hit them while walking, it‚Äôs just different if you are sprinting. For example it could be a movement speed penalty, until you move 1m away from the kable where it will break and make the twang sound.
---
I am having the same issue. At least I'm not alone!

If I‚Äôm not mistaken, that‚Äôs the disconnect symbol

Casual is probably just random.

I'm talking about I was given no christmas pack at all did you not read that? I WASN'T GIVEN A CHRISTMAS PACK DESPITE BEING THE LAST DAY.

I mean it is a bit weird, but it's nowhere near the level the title makes it seem. 
---
I follow u on IG, great work man
---
Yup, currently gold 1 - plat 3 range, but have gotten to plat 2 - plat 1 range with my team. Every team has a keyboard/ crouch spammer on the other team.. It's infuriating. 
---
Yeah it ain‚Äôt ridiculous just strange. But I suppose it is the R6 team, similar things have happened.
---
Just because a gun is already used doesn‚Äôt mean another operator can‚Äôt be released with it. I mean just look at Echo getting an MP5 and Kaid getting an AUG. 
---
Glaz:Hehe...piece of cake. They won‚Äôt know what hit em!
---
*shoots Thermite by accident*
---
Glaz:OH NO! Thermite, a-are you okay?! I-I‚Äôm so sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to!
---
It‚Äôs in fuckin chinese, we can‚Äôt read 
---
But you **cant** join an ongoing ranked game.
---
The weird thing is that your ability thing isn't on the bottom meaning somehow it's turned off
---
I got my plat and haven‚Äôt touched rainbow since because of this. Hope they implement a crouch soam restriction system like cs, or something. Simply every crouch after the first one is slowed down or maybe you can‚Äôt ads while going crouch like they did with drop shotting. 
---
nice repost 
---
Exactly, I totally agree.
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be possible at all? Maybe I mid interrupted your statement 
---
Ahhhh crisis averted.
---
I'll definitely check them out. Can you also eloborate what starter edition gives or its worth or not for buying.
---
I think that it's important that he has more than 2 placable items but 4 or even 3 Resupplies if they provide explosives; shields; barbed wire or cameras could be just to much but they need to provide that to provide utility besides ammo (which you tend to have plenty of) as to be an effective gadget.
---
Maybe 3 Resupplies would be ok but I like the idea of being able to hide healing stations around the map for your roamers to fall back to for a quick pick me up.
---
I like the 2-2 split of resupply and healing. 
---
I'll definitely check him out too. Thank you :)
---
I know it's his vid, but I still posted it here because the info is useful and he didn't post it anywhere else.(To my knowledge)
---
I mean, no I'd imagine yeah you could cut it closer since technically you lost according to the clock at the top...

Smaller diamond is less recoil.

Why not post a link to the video then?

Grim Sky and Para Bellum both have those. In Grim Sky Vakanda woman was pointing her handgun at player. In Para Bellum Maestro was giving Alibi one of those "whatch'ya doing tonight girl?" looks.

Though? You mean tough?

Isn‚Äôt this just what Ash does normally?

This is a symptom of quitting losing matches in Casual and only staying for wins. If you leave matches when losing and mostly stay for wins, your hidden MMR for Casual matchmaking will only go up and eventually be so high that you will be matched against people who consistently win in Casual.

See the Irish SF uses weapons that are exactly like the ones from the operators I listed. Echo and Kaid got Versions that differentiate from the ones that were already in the game, Echo's MP5S has slightly different design from the GIGN MP5, It is thicker and has a suppressor included, Kaid's AUG A3 XS is a smaller and thinner version of IQ's normal AUG
---
Different Versions, not the same guns.

Kaid‚Äôs pistol is gonna get nerfed, it‚Äôs too easy to spawnpeak
---
This is so sick!
---
Do not buy the starter edition it makes the game way too grindy because everything costs more so just buy the standard
---
No that is entirely it, you know everything you‚Äôre getting with the season pass. 
---
Everyone can access free events without the season pass and everyone can access the new maps/reworks without the season pass 
---
Have you heard of holidays yah the devs are humans with families and spend the holidays with them
---
Reason?
---
Also true.
---
Devs are on holiday break with families
---
It wasnt working for me 2 days ag; it worked yesterday; it's not working today. i believe its a fuck up with Ubisoft several teammates said they have the same issue and the enemy team in my current match.
---
I never said you need a software. Mess around with the game and it happens.
---
Still a hack, since you have to trigger it for the enemy team
---
DETAILS.

Busy eating tasty gingerbread.
---
Can your monitor do 60hz?
---
Where is it penalizing old players? A bug? I'm sure that that's exactly what they wanted when they did this. For FREE. I understand that you want the skin, but it's a gift. Be grateful and wait like the rest of us  
---
Oh, thx
---
Buy a R6 Credit bundle, you‚Äôll still have extra credits for skins, uniforms, etc...
---
Marry him
---
Ehh the 25k was out of no where. Shouldn‚Äôt depend on that for the skin knowing they‚Äôd release a holiday bundle like every year.
---
*tries to reload after expending 1 bullet*
---
Winning gunfights consistently is considered a serious talent. Wich is why streamers are becoming millionaires. (Pengu for example has a way faster reaction time than most humans. He was born with that. He didnt learned that.)
---
Dont put yourself under pressure and/or expect something from you that you cant deliver.
---
50% of winning gunfights is a clever amount of pre fire. Focus more on leaving the situation as the winner, and you will become better at it.
---
If you feel slightly frustrated about it, stop playing. Take a break.
---
You wont make progress if you are pissed. 
---
Thats atleast how i became better.
---
You could just wait until they release the y3 bundle, it would be  20$ just like the other bundles and come with all 8 ops, it should be releasing soon since the y4 leaks have been everywhere
---
Its a bad habit man haha
---
then you missed it.
---
\&gt;new players get pack instantly  
---
\&gt;players who have either grinded hundreds of hours for all ops or bought season passes have gone a week now with the same cookie cutter bullshit "Um yeah we're working on it" response   
---
Really dude? Now imagine if we could AFK farm renown in Thunt again. How fast do you think they would patch that even during vacation? Probably pretty damn quick. Yet, they can't fix this simple bug.   
---
It probably was intended for just the ops. Be glad you got anything. Stop acting like an entitled child and start acting like an adult. Jeez. 
---
Let‚Äôs upvote this to the moon
---
He has come out and said on the Pro and the Potato he had over 8 accounts in top 100. If he disbanded them then he did, but I can see him getting bored and doing as he wishes 
---
You act like the developers have no clue about anything 
---
HE TURNED INTO A GUN! WE ALL SAW IT
---
Go to the R6 subreddit and click the three dots on the top right and then click select user flair. Hope this helped!üëç

Or they could just disable Tk in casual
---
Does anyone have a problem of having no audio when they are dead?
---
what is this choppy garbage 
---
Well Castle would have the advantage of not letting others see into the OBJ.
---
I doubt they would actually remove it, they could atleast make changes though.
---
Something similar happened to my account a few months back. You can contact Ubisoft support from their website and they will remove the 2FA as long as you have your email.
---
As the name says its PC DVD, consoles use Bluray Discs that have a lot more capacity in comparison. In PC isnt common using a DVD drive even if they are very cheap, BD drives are "expensive" and most people are not going to use them anyway.
---
dude players who played for 4 years now and have every op are arent getting their gift from ubi even tho they supported the game for so long.
---
im get that they are on holiday but damn thats a major bug that is not getting fixed. and its not like it happened to a couple people, it happened to everyone who got all ops.. 
---
I've been playing the game since launch. This was always a thing. I don't understand why people is talking about it 3 years later
---
The starter edition on pc is $15
---
Since you ignored me. Which is funny. Have a nice day. Later. 
---
This is just what I needed. Ty
---
Nope they were a paid alpha pack at the time, exclusive to the event that has been quoted as "not likely to come back"
---
I'm in the same boat. I have all the ops. Its a free gift. I'm waiting patiently for my FREE. GIFT. 
---
And I‚Äôm the child

I dunno, but they could at least make friendly fire do less damage.
---
It‚Äôs been in the game for awhile now and I don‚Äôt really support it, but at this point it‚Äôs either adapt or get killed and derank.

Glad to see another Thermite player out there!üëç

I‚Äôm not of big fan of complaining about this game and I‚Äôm saying this because it must be hard being a developer for this game and waking up and seeing a bunch of tweets saying fix your game do this that. And yes they are very slow at fixing thing but this game is not perfect and nothing is but people complain at every thing the reason why i‚Äôm saying this because i see comments saying ‚Äúfix your game‚Äù i‚Äôm uninstalling because of a stupid reason‚Äù and it must feel scary for a developer that messed up or is trying to fix the game see a pile of messages from people that have no experience being a developer.I may not be a dev but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that easy to just ‚Äúfix the game‚Äù (sorry for any grammar mistakes)
---
Always üí•
---
And if you start shooting, don't become a toxic shit that starts TKIng
---
Yeah, I have thag skin. The outbreak packs come with advanced or higher editions.
---
One time I was in a ranked game and both teams were trying super hard. On the 4-4 match point, we all agreed that we'd go out in a knife fight outside. Other team was about to win 2v1 but our random mongoloid, brainlet teammate started shooting and killed them. I mean, we won, and I still felt cheated. 
---
im commenting so i can get 97k upvotes when this blows up

How do you get the Buck Main tag, idea what that is but I want it

Yeah while newer players have that gift while you can sit and wait

thinking the same thing

---
I mean you commented multiple times on this post? Did op piss you off as well?
---
yes Terrorist Hunt is such a mess and needs a big overhaul   
---
your cant even play it tactically they spawn in mid round randomly or in places you may have cleared  
---
its not even good training for the main game mode 
---
i think the outbreak mode looked better but i never go to play it though 
---
To be fair I‚Äôve played with PeekMe. And he‚Äôs pretty decent
---
For everyone it's not my clip Idk I will have it listen but it's from a Instagram video .... The content creator himself shows community highlights and I just like this highlight...
---
What should I ask her?
---
Back then it was worst. The hit reg and the boxes were all sorts of fucked. Rogue-9 did a video on it. In no way shape or form does this mess with hitbox or reg. It's just a spam tactic now.
---
But do that shit in the first year with the poor reg and shitty hitbox outlines. Keyboards, controllers and games would be destroyed.

Hey nothing can stop the power of imagination and creativity. You can actually come up with loads of ideas.

Siri is fucking stupid, I am sad. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
For anyone wondering, I'm pretty sure that was his right foot, though which part of his body was it is irrelevant. The problem is that after shooting, you can hear that sound when you hit someone, while no blood was present, nor did the guy react in any way for being shot.
---
It was known for more than 3 months at least, O have been inspired by a person to make 7 videos regarding the stuff, also some nice tricks with his smoke bolts
---
So you're telling me Siege is the only game in the world that is allowed to have a character that looks like a Navy SEAL?
---
Crouch spamming should be a banable offense 
---
But then he wouldn't be the standard model anymore, that's the point in not being able to customize and all looking the same.
---
Does he get better, because I think an RPK is a lot better than a NERF?
---
Alexa pick me and operator I rainbow six siege
---
What do u recommend instead?
---
I think its because drop-shotting was 10x worse.
---
Then they fixed that and coupled with Grim Sky's recoil buffs made it very easy to maintain control even when spamming crouch
---
I don't play a lot of games with this setting, how does it give an advantage?
---
I wish i got that or the knight helmet but i always get duplicates 
---
Sounds kinda lit
---
All i know is that he is getting a rework idk
---
It‚Äôs Ching Chong language
---
the concept had a spacer between the shields, not great but would allow body shots through
---
First PUBG then Minecraft, now this???
---
Watch him without sound and play a hip hop song.
---
I hear we are getting a kanal rework this year
---
Not only will you fry the enemies and hostages eyes,  you'll easy bake oven the whole damn block! 
---
Don't rework house. That's my favourite map
---
Recruit isn‚Äôt meant to be a permanent thing. His  purpose was to provide a stand-in while you grinder up renown to unlock others. 
---

Was crouch spamming even an issue in this clip? Had the Nomad stayed standing this guy's awful aim wouldn't have compensated in the affirmative anyway-- not to mention that the Nomad had the peeker's advantage and the better gun.
---
Honestly, in a game that's all about angles crouch spamming is a perfectly viable tactic that allows for more variable gameplay; unfortunately, it also places a greater onus on aim as a skill which most of the playerbase is allergic to.

How do counter him? By forcing yourself into cover and not moving?
---
Its so cute the way how his hat is moving up and downüòÇüòÇand yes this season is whack as hell
---
Its a bit annoying if you have to reload and messing with the shotgun. And  yes buck is smoother but in time i get used to it. And in ranked as a defender playing against Jackal is really annoying despite the weakness of his shotgun. I mean i do a similar thing as Buck plus i have a tracking device.

Wtf I thought the exact same but now you told me so I realized...

Most golds have better aim than macie-- it's not surprising, consequently, that he wants the removal or crippling of a game mechanic that sits contrary to his playstyle and skillset.

Nice, you also have the cheat codes on the torn paper.

Please report the bugs to r6 fix....the developers dont fix things when you post it here on reddit

Just type 'sound bug..footsteps etc.. ' in the search region

Yep

Yes we need indian ops I‚Äôve been waiting for since I got the game

Even if he would have killed the guy he would need to defuse

Additionally I think there should be more first person movement when you crouch or lean.

And move slow as fuck when ads

Yep, pretty much sums up this season. Kinda reminds me of dropshotting

This is a misunderstanding of how ping affects actions, and also a misunderstanding of what the blog post stated.
---
You state that a users ping affects where they are shown to enemies, which is true. This is due to client side prediction, and allows a player with ping, peaking a corner, to see an enemy before the enemy sees him. So, in the case of a player with a crazy ping of 10 whole seconds, this results in the peaking player seeing his enemy an entire 5 seconds before the enemy sees him.
---
Now comes the part that people often omit, typically through ignorance. **All** your actions are affected by this delay. Movement is the action most people site, because it supports their claim of ping abuse. The action which almost nobody sites is **firing your weapon**. So if we apply the exact same principles to that action, the lagging player who has now peaked the corner fires his weapon on his screen. That action will only be counted by the server **5 whole seconds later**.  
---
So what you are left with is a 5 seconds **advantage** when peaking, and a 5 second **disadvantage** when firing, resulting in the effective **0 millisecond ping**, which the blog post clearly states.
---
To be clear, this is a **very important phenomenon** for high ping players. Having a high ping is extremely detrimental to being able to play Siege at a high level, and this shows that peaking an enemy, instead of reacting to an enemy peaking you, **reduces your effective ping to zero**. This is important because, while it does not offer an **advantage**, it eliminates the **disadvantage** of a high ping.  
---
For more information, and the only accurate portrayal of "peekers advantage" that exists in video form, you can watch this video

This is not amazing, not even close. 
---
heh. programmer here. 
---
this is NOT a matter of 2 lines of code.
---
this can have multiple causes, the most obvious would be a one line fix, but i highly doubt it‚Äòd be that way since ubi probably tested it internally. 
---
ubi has to pin down the actual issue, find out whats causing it and then fix it. that can, without a doubt take multiple workdays, no matter how easy a fix it is. so shut your mouth it you dont have a clue about how something works and be grateful ubisoft even released a FUCKING GIFT, you entitled moron. honestly i wish ubi wouldn‚Äôt even release gifts, people like you dont deserve it. 
---
Pretty sure your points are invalid. I, and others, don't have an issue with any of those. Except for the matchmaking. Even then, who cares? It's just a game.

But how will the sweats sweat?

This is free fucking gift. Atleast be greatful we got one. Let them come back from their holidays first. They have more stuff to worry about with the limited staff who are working during these holidays.

Well...there isn't anything wrong with crouch spam. As a mechanics in a first person shooter it's pretty baseline. Movement and evasion are core fundamentals of first person shooters. It's simply a matter of if you think crouch spam and fast movements belong in Rainbow. 
---
I personally do, you don't. Did the video anger me? No because it aligned more with my opinion. Did it anger you? Yeah because it upsets _your_ bias.
---
I won most of my placement matches (7 or 8 cant remember) and got bronze 3 ):
---
you're lucky I didn't even get a fucking christmas alpha pack at all
---
Or when you join an ongoing casual match to warm up for the day and you take a little over 15 seconds to fully load in and get instantly vote kicked before even getting in the game...
---
It's too similar to maestro anyway, they would either have to do pretty much the same otherwise one would become obsolete
---
The only difference is the stakes...

Lol you guys say I'm being impatient. I'm fine with the waiting. Thank you

I knew /r/animemes and /r/rainbow6 were the same subreddit

Yeah but he got an extreme passive ability that doesn't really affect specifically him... It affects the whole team.

If bb peeks a corner you were aiming at you'll prob be dead if you didn't react fast enough

&gt;Fuck rogue 9's video. If this doesn't give you an advantage then nothing does. It's literally every single game at this point. Why should I be punished for not purchasing a scuff.

I use my mouse to lean I find it easier to do it that way.
---
Idk people are weird. Everyone has their fave skin though.
---
WE KICKED THE WRONG GUY
---
I wouldn't be opposed to these additions, but I don't think it would really make that much of a dent in the problem.
---
1. For players who have all the operators unlocked and can take or leave the cosmetics (which is a fairly significant portion of the player base in Siege), these changes wouldn't influence their decision to not check the option to join a fresh game. Hell, even some people who do care about the renown and/or experience might weigh a fresh game versus the chance to influence a team that went short handed (which many times is because the team is in a hole score-wise) and perceive they will receive more renown/XP through a fresh game where they have an equal chance to get a winning game than walking into what many times will be a losing situation in the first place.
---
2. Your suggestion wouldn't impact players who frequently leave casual matches once they die/decide their team is a lost cause. Those players are already forfeiting the chance at XP, renown, and alpha packs by leaving early so clearly those rewards weren't compelling enough to stay. With my suggestion, some portion of players who currently would leave a casual match might stick around if a real incentive for them exists.
---
Also, you didn't really address my suggestion. Is there something you have an issue with that maybe I didn't think about?
---
The better to eat you with, my dear.
---
Lol you all act like I'm being a bad guy here. It's their problem that they said they were going to fix right? So why make me a bad guy when there doesn't need to be one.
---
Pretty sure if they did, they wouldn‚Äôt be in this sub still. There might be some, not sure though.
---
But on the otherhand I've played for 3 years on pc and never seen this shit, it is probably more common on pc though 
---
Then what‚Äôs the point of the post?
---
Hotel ?....Trivago
---
Siege has extreme jump exhaustion to be fair  
---
Late to the party
---
It‚Äôs like cartoons where someone is being chased, so they duck behind a dumpster in an alley and the people chasing them just run past
---
/u/Crepug look at this. lol
---
Then what's the point of your response
---
vote kick initiated (1/4) 
---
They did it once before? And the fact it would be too fucking silly for them as a business NOT to appeal to the chinese to get into the Asian market?
---
That was to block out the game's activation code. But yea, I remember storing cheats on papers stuffed inside those cases.
---
People really don't notice when a comment is sarcastic, do they? 
---
They‚Äôre doing a separate version for China. 
---
Yup, its a rare bred.
---
I don't get it :P 
---
You know what matters in this game? SKILL
---
RAW SKILL! 
---
If you are better than the other person youll win the gu n fight its as easy as that.
---
Its the same debate OW had a while back you never punish/nerf skill of players and in case of OW many players left because of that. 
---
Xim apex is undetectable. At one point the game was able to but xim quickly put out an update to once again make them undetectable. The previous comment about the separation not working is true- m n kb users will continue using xim apex and other input converters to trick the console into thinking they are using a controller. 
---
The reason being that nobody in their right mind would bring a bolt-action to CQC firefight.
---
Don't agree for map pools and shields, but the rest is totally true. That's why I decided to stop tryharding ranked and to play just for fun
---
1-3 shots to shield.. Dies. His rifle now takes up to three or 4 shots to kill, (of which if you wait for recoil recovery you stand waiting to die for anoter second or two before you can take another accurate shot) which gives the enemy 3 or four x's the chance to kill you in one of their shots. And lets not kid ourselves, his shield can be spotted so In advance around a corner hes actually in 2020.
---
I used to use his SR-17 with a silencer long ago, which back then took two or three to kill. but now, its no longer for fun anymore because people complained and now it shoots marshmellows, even mith a muzzle break. 
---
TL;DR: He's fine :P 
---
I mean nobody would bring a car battery to a siege either, but here I am putting one on a garage door
---
Remember the t-rex legs?
---
The more you play, the quicker you'll get used to it. My current sens is almost double my old one and I got used it to it in less than a week cause I've changed my sens so much. Plus, that period of frustration try to get used it will be over quicker than you think and it'll be easier to control it by the hour.

Dankjewel knaap

u/TheMightySenpai unleashes the greatest comeback from when we were 7
---
Sorry bro hahahahah
---
I'm not sure. I don't see it working on either side because on attack it would be unreliable and on defense it would cause major spawnpeek
---
i agree the team killing is stupid  and something needs too be done about it 
---
like  how do you win a vote to kick a Griefer when they have 3 or 4 fiends on the team ?  
---
kicking someone if they load in a bit slow isn't very nice  and probably isn't what the kick option is for  
---
like i say it ends up just being abused most of the time   
---
*halo theme plays*
---
Wasn't it supposed to be functional a week ago? Or am I missing something?
---
Hitboxes function normally when crouch spamming, ie they follow the playermodel. I don't know how else crouch spamming could affect them, other than a macro + hold to crouch which is arguably more of a detriment than a benefit.
---
Crouching repeatedly during a gunfight is a perfectly valid strategy. Any player can crouch spam and this consequently encourages a greater emphasis on mechanic aim.
---
FUS RO DAH!!!
---
Fuze
---
Then the strat has worked!
---
There is plenty things wrong with crouch spam. It's the same as dropshotting. Players use it as a crutch, defend it when people rightly complain about it, and then nobody really refutes when Ubisoft removes it. 
---
Y.E.E.T.E.D ?
---
Where she blows it alien out of the goddamn airlock? 
---
I only use it if I‚Äôm memeing in casual or if it‚Äôs 3-0 in ranked
---
I personally think it's a great competitive map. Except for the top floor. Fuck that floor.
---
Trying to hit a Target that is literally teleporting left right up and down isn't skill anymore, it's who gets the lucky headshot.
---
You are exactly the kind of person that ruined chiv.
---
Binding the lean onto any extra mouse buttons you may have makes this easy.
---
Sometimes the hit boxes, when it comes to knifes, are very broken and you can be far away from the guy you are knifing
---
i‚Äôve been waiting to see something like this happen
---
Gotta keep in mind kill cams in siege are jank.
---
Imagine being so bad that you have to drop from gold 3 to copper just to get any kills after playing over 400h
---
But we already have German and English Ops, Dutch are obsolete
---
The top floor is the only defendable site 
---
We died asking for them but got both ignored and raped with downvotes
---
Whats wrong with the top floor
---
Everybody gangsta until the hostage starts walking
---
It'll be easier but can be perfect I bet you the way I saw people perfect it it's inhuman 
---
Ff rustig aan pik
---
I think they've been changed cus the same thing is happening to me
---
This hurts on more levels than u imagine
---
Ripping off a lot of the emotes and shit from Destiny.
---
Someone plays Fortnite. Just because they aren‚Äôt claiming to have created it, they are taking other‚Äôs content and selling it. That‚Äôs why people are suing. It cost 8$ or something to get the floss, so Fortnite is making money off other people‚Äôs creativity and content. 
---
Evasive tactics = literally teleporting like neo
---
Do you honestly think that it's a good fit for a game as tight as rainbow? If you do then it's obvious you use it as a crutch. 
---
It isn‚Äôt op if everyone is in third person.
---
As an Australian, cheers mate.
---
The enemy seems to have a macro to allow him to do it that quickly. The way he was crouching and able to lean back and fourth quickly as well seemed off to me, and the fact that he easily stopped in a crouching position, not standing. I also think it‚Äôs sus he knew where the streamer was, but callouts exist so meh
---
Basically why i went for copper 4 and quit the season. Fuck this game, if they fix this shit im going back. I play since Release and this was the nail in the coffin for me, well this and the degrading performance since Parabellum.
---
UNPLAYABLE
---
It was slower if you went from q to e (or whatever your equivalent input was). If you went q-q-e then it was actually faster than it is now. 
---
This is nice, extremely nice...
---
Ligma

I only use it if I‚Äôm memeing in casual or if it's 3-0 in casual 
---
Too many angles for attackers to get shot from
---
A DMR that takes 3 shots to kill but has the same RoF as a regular DMR. The MP5 Doc has would have similar DPS but a higher RoF. RoF generally beats out high dam per shot.
---
Literally everything else you mentioned in regards to that is possible rn with Acog defenders.
---
As to the nitro cell thing, yeah THAT is pretty powerful. I'd maybe suggest only one resupply and 3 heals but the heals are 50 max now.
---
BTW Doc can overheal, this guy cannot.

Still very toxic. Depending on your casual elo which you can‚Äôt see it might be easy or hard

I thought extended barrel decreases damage but keeps that damage going for more range according to rogue9's spreadsheet ..

This reminds me that we need Irish operators badly.

---
You take this way too seriously. All we are doing is discussing skins and are the copied or not, but you take it to personal insults. You are pretty sad guy to be honest. 
---
Mine is V in all games, not really different from C, just the way I rest my thumb aligns with V more.
---
Idk, i don't feel the same way. I mean yes its easy  , but how many tk can you do in a day really or a game session ? BY ACCIDENT!
---
From personal experience i learned myself how to be more careful and pay more attention to my surrounding so that i don't kill a teammate.It still happens sometimes, most of the times when i'm not warmed up and people stack near me.
---
Usually people keep their angle and spot when things get heated and don't go ham like crazy in other teammate visor. And there are comms so that you communicate.
---
I'm sure ubi has a graphic with TK based on rank lvl too tho :)
---
Only issue with this would be hackers imo(and maybe caveiras interrogation (when you try to kill her at the moment of interrogation and you kill your teammate in the process too)). If you solo q and get ranked in a team with hackers you'll get penalized if you leave or kill them :(
---
They need to slow down the crouch animation by Like 50% and add in a fatigue where it gets slower the more you spam it. It's really fucking old now... It's the new drop shot. Trying to force people aim off from standing headshot level

Uh did you not see the defuser and the bomb? You can be DBNO'd in bomb oddly enough if the defuser is planted.

Next season will be the last season that there will be 4 new Pro league sets (maverick, clash, kaid, nomad)

I should thank flakito for carrying the team
---
 I mean imo Hereford base actually looked like a base now it looks like a abandoned building of sorts

The reason I'll buy the starter one is I'll be poor for a while and if I buy it it will probably be non-sale prize which is half of standard. I have a few friends that play the game tho I'm fine on that one.

Just put lean buttons on mouse 4 and 5 you can move jump shoot and lean without taking your hand off anything.

Yes.

I'd like a BF3 Operation Metro styled map. I still have memories of 24/7 max ticket servers that would ban you for using shotguns. Good times.

Canonicaly it would make more sense he is a 3 speed but jeez thats nightmare fuel

Change your sever mate. Cus has super low population and the ranked match maker sucks for cus. It basically just grabs 5 players 1-2 rank levels, so silver-plat in one game together. Eus or WUS even with higher ping is much more fun

Yeah the old map was bad and new Hereford is not that much better . the only good maps IMO are coastline , clubhouse, skyscraper, consulate , border , and I honestly don‚Äôt mind theme park even thought it‚Äôs big

Sometimes, but more than likely it‚Äôs people being greedy for more kills. Not waiting patiently.
---
that is of the big oof
---
As I was running up those stairs I heard Zoidberg saying "Woop Woop Woop!" in my head
---
Sounds the same as xbox casual to me, but from what you describe Ps4 might be worse. Atleast ranked is a safe haven.
---
Opa, e a√≠ Notera?
---
That fucking W/L ratio Jesus 
---
yea that‚Äôs not hacks with that kd lmao. but in all reality it‚Äôs achievable cause that‚Äôs games been out since 2016 i believe 
---
Under appreciated comment right there . But I liked it . Keep on doing God‚Äôs work son.

My mate said the exact same thing the other day

I originally posted this on [https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/aafo9u/10minute\_meme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/comments/aafo9u/10minute_meme/) at r/linuxmemes. A lot of people recognized the game so, might as well.
---
Who cares about points
---
It won't let me play because of Two Step verification even though I have it enabled.
---
This is nothing compared to my 1.1 W/L and 0.8 K/D
---
Maybe it‚Äôs not meant to be competitive and they want it to be an easily accessible game that‚Äôs fun for all groups ü§îü§î
---
Honestly, y2 ops are the most solid so no reason to discount them.
---
I mean... if you‚Äôre consistently that good, you should have no trouble finding a group to play with. So I see this as either one of two things. You got extremely lucky and this never happens OR you act all cocky like other people who make similar posts, and nobody wants to play with people with that toxic attitude. 
---
&gt; (and maybe 2v1)
---
Not unless you've *massively* fucked up.
---
damn you fr got 30 kills?
---
Again, the above solution works, spread the news.
---
*Smash bros announcer voice* Mr.Game And Watch.
---
Yeah, so your entire team has to change their graphic setting to reset this.

Hello LongDongBigBong, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/abvaq4/idk_if_anyone_else_has_experienced_this_but_along/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I love rogue9 but to be fair it was just him and one other person in a custom server. I'm not saying is evaluations are false. Imo it's just still really hard to tell. 
---
The animation doesn't cause your hands to cover your face but I promise you hands block face shots all the time. They were two separate points. 
---
Too many 90's. I like the look of it but the map design sucks
---
Jackal has the most situational ability on attack. And the only attacker who's ability can be used against him by trapping him. 1v2 where you are jackal, against a good duo means your guaranteed death.
---
Not saying jackal is bad. But roam hunting ability in siege has always worked well only in a group. Never alone. Even lion- dude is near-useless when alone, but with just one more buddy, he's broken OP.
---
Jackal has a bit of everything, but isn't the best at anything. He is flexible, but not perfect.
---
I hate that I've done this because of how much I love seige and the course le thousand hours I've put into it, but I started playing insurgency sandstorm and have got hooked on that... hard

Agreed.

Go [Here](https://store.ubi.com/us/tom-clancys-rainbow-six--siege---advanced-edition/5a786fd2ca1a64a9c39f33bb.html?lang=en_US)  and then click compare to see what each version gets. Very helpful 
---
Likewise.
---
This thread is full of examples that people don't put themselves in someone else's shoe.
---
There are people that tells you this has been posted dozen of times, saying you are late, everyone knows about this already, etc. Yet there are tons of people on this thread did not know about this at all.
---
And this thread's creator also did not credit the original creator of this attachment guide, also ignoring the fact that Rogue has put effort into all these.
---
It could be that this thread's creator only did this purely for spreading the info to inform everyone, intention was trying to help but everyone start pointing their fingers for karma farming.
---
The same thing could be applied to the discussion of renown which I'm not going to deep into, some people claim renown is too easy to get, some people said too hard, some people said alpha pack duplicates are bad, they just do not put themselves in someone else's shoe, doesn't know the fact that people come from different background, starter vs. complete edition, spend 5 hours per day vs. 5 hours per week on this game, with or without season pass.
---
You should play it like the Spanish Inquisition. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition. 
---
"Welcome to the club, buddy" 
---
If they have already have been spotted then it doesn't count 
---
So how will I know that I got an Op? 
---
Oh I like the M870 over that shotgun. 
---
Why breaching charges? Do you like to suffer? 
---
Damn ubi got my hopes up for the 3473928th time
---
I wasnt expecting that but when I saw the hostage slaughtering people I lost it
---
Game is much better at low settings. 
---
Why?
---
So, not liking something immediately means I'm bad? At least I'm not fucking toxic
---
that defender gadgets seems familiar if you watch Mission Impossible.
---
Blitz is not balanced, along with Monty. Their ADS times are absurd and when combined with quick peeking/leaning they become extremely effective fraggers.
---
Shield ops like recruit and fuze are balanced simply because they are not guaranteed invulnerability unlike Monty and Blitz. 
---
I really wanted to believe that the one guy managed to clutch a 4-0 reverse sweep solo against your team.
---
It hit me and then went behind me. The last flashbang was far away and still blinded me, but because of my insane luck at that moment I was able to kill Maverick and get the ACE =]
---
Do we know what we are getting since we can‚Äôt get a free op?
---
I have played around a hundred hours this season and am gold. I feel that fortress is great. Once you get to know the bottom floor the map becomes very fun and great for roaming. My one issue is the lack of color or large room defining features as it makes callouts much harder for people who don't know room names.
---
Plat 2 on pc. Playing an ok amount. Mixed feelings about it. Leaning towards me not liking it though. Sometimes it feels defending has a big advantage. I might be wrong though, still haven‚Äôt lost a ranked game on it though 
---
Your high dude.
---
Doing well is like 300. Many games since I'm shits it's like 150.

Ahh, here we have the elusive Gitgudolodon, indigenous to Reddit communities and gaming forums overall. Very rarely seen outside of their preferred environment of Doucheland where they mingle with other Elitists discussing how bad game mechanics are good for the game and people just need to learn to exploit better. 
---
Bring back old Hereford. I hate the makeover. 
---
Hey currently looking for people for our team! If you wanna learn more. Join https://discord.gg/R3xMpM contact me or yan for information

Oh, so you‚Äôre saying using a bumpstock would increase rate of fire
---
25k renown
---
Fuck yea! We gonna be feeling good!!! J√§gers around the house
---
Part of the game get used to it. It‚Äôs fun when you do it and it‚Äôs easy to counter just pre aim. 
---
Me and my buddy are looking, I‚Äôll message you in a few mins. 
---
You can see a lot better in some areas. Lesi√≥n gu mines stick out like a sore thumb. And game runs better. Playing any competitive game higher than low does not give you anything.
---
Yeah, I think I didn't expressed myself enough

Hello OneManDrones, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/abvd3j/need_tips_for_clash_in_1v1s_or_1v2s/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I agree. It's a shame, really. I was looking forward to saving up for it. Should be brought to Ubisoft's attention.
---
I like new Hereford. Probably one of my new favorites, simply because of how well balanced I think it is.
---
Getting frisky with your finger placement I see. 
---
Villa has so many small rooms which gives too many fucking angles to cover whether you're attacking or defending, I despise the map.
---
He would‚Äôve still had a solid like 5 seconds to run back to the defused 
---
Maybe he wants to be a cunt and not find a solution.
---
Easier to bitch and complain then take advice on how to fix it
---
Echo is pretty good 
---
he's on ps4
---
Sounds good
---
I did something similiar with Kapkan. I was setting my trap and as soon as i finished, Blitz was charging at me so i started backing up.
---
Yes. /s
---
I was gonna exchange mine soon. Guess I should wait. 
---
I don't have echo :(
---
Each time I said this in this sub I got downvoted in oblivion, but this is the sad truth.
---
Fortress is pretty big but not as chaotic as some others, but maps like Villa, Tower or Theme Park are just too big and just don't feel *real*, like a kid who'd stuck 3 Lego Star Wars ship together to make a big one.
---
But new Hereford is definitely the worse. Not only it has absolutely nothing in common with the old Hereford, but it also is plain bad as a whole. I discovered a room only a few days ago while I was roaming, and it was useless, like about half of the whole map.

Trust me I know. I first got into the game at operation heath on xbox because the ace videos on Facebook looked super cool. Loved it for 2 months went to uni and kinda lost touch with it because it wasn't super enjoyable anymore. Come spring this year built a pc to play pubg and hated that after 10 hours bought seige for $10 and have since logged over 200.hours and love it on pc. Weird how you can lose touch with a game then love it on something else
---
I bet the gingerbread camo is gone.. I wanted to buy it with my renown from the pack. 
---
I mean that technically happened.
---
I shoot at the feet and it gets destroyed but also gets detected
---
Recruit is the best op
---
Course. We'd all love all the maps to be balanced but what map is fully balanced? None of the maps are perfect. I felt Theme Park was one of their most balanced maps but everyone hated it because of one choke point (train) and because it was apparently too dark in places 
---
I agree with your tower statement . and on the flip side favela is a steaming hot pile of garbage to defend 
---
i dont think so chief
---
Gut gud? Is that aimed at me? 
---
My guy if you want to learn about operators then watch Russian Badger, strats and tactics Varsity Gaming, and stupid shit Tux Bird and Yumi
---
Hold on is that a creep? Who cares who plays the game?
---
I was thinking about that it could be the processors problem. Might not be able to handle the game and recieve  information from the mouse and keyboard.
---
Btw it's not an argument. It was a question. 
---
I don't think it would be that time consuming. Other games have anti griefer precautions in place, and they work way better than whatever Siege does now
---
I‚Äôm not completely sure that is around what the vigils slug does. Vigils slug can fire twice while the crossbow can only fire once. Vigils shot gun downs 1 armored enemy‚Äôs at close range consistently and long range tends to take two. I would make the gun along the lines 160+  damage this would probably one shot everything so you would not need the bleed affect
---
Fortnite is gay.  FTFY
---
The barbed arrow already does bleed.  I changed some stuff, buffed the damage and bleed damage.
---
The original operator concept I posted on Op Creator had all 3 arrow types doing over 100 with stronger bleed, but I felt like it would be to OP so I changed it
---
M12 is inferior to Vityaz and K1A in every way. 
---
And 9mmC1 is almost redundant when you have UMP45 and 416-C.
---
It‚Äôs hard to normalize the TTK when you have a limited firerate.
---
Thanks
---
Honestly I love the new Hereford. It has so much strat potential it's crazy, EXCEPT top floor heavily favors defense (same issue as Bartlett, no safe entry points) so everyone picks it first every time. It's a shame honestly that one bad floor ruins 3 great ones.
---
Darn, thought so, funny though 
---
this type of stuff happens way too much. like I get it, it's a game and it's all fun but it does get a little annoying sometimes losing a round because your teammates don't play seriously due to you having an advantage. the worst is when it's a 5v1 and your teammate TK's another teammate because "hey it's still a 4v1" and then we somehow lose the round
---
not dissing you or anything, I've done recruit shenanigans too. it's just funny how often stuff like that happens in a game where you can when a 1v5 with 5 bullets, especially when the enemy is running right to you
---
These [guys](https://i.imgur.com/ooiZioq.jpg) are a 4 man squad where one of them are just loading in forever. He refuses to leave and join back later.
---
My only issue with the new Hereford is the fact that they even call it Hereford Base. It bears so few resemblance to the original.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with it?
---
Oh im all for variety! Infact i was hoping for ubisoft to release algerian ops due to the fact that i am algerian! But you and i both know that they will most likey release russian german or american ops in the future . I also think youre missing some operators :Blackbeard thermite ash valk castle pulse and mav thats 7 US operators jeez they do need to have different countries
---
Just casually get the fuck out of my way to Lion and Nomad
---
No, it shouldn't, cz it actually reads like Detali, where "i" spells like English sound "ea" in clEAnig, for example. Neither "–π" nor "–™", shouldn't be too
---
Dont die
---
Alright, that sounds cool.
---
&gt; I would make the gun along the lines 160+ damage this would probably one shot everything so you would not need the bleed affect
---
I actually posted an operator similar to this, with a 150 damage sniper but it got downvoted to hell and no one posted any constructive comments, so I've just been trying to keep damage counts low on the operators I make :p
---
It was just a question. Your statement is pretty obvious to anyone that plays the game. 
---
Ooh, nice! Does it say who the manufacturer is anywhere on the labels? Just want to see if they're available in other countries.
---
r/r6operatorcreator
---
I completely agree. Plane is my favourite map just because of how fun it is to play. Sure, it isn't really that balanced, but it also isn't too bad either IMO.
---
But then proleague would need to change. all theze changes are because of it. sped rounds up which takes away more strategic play.  And they also have released 2 maps that are the same basic map. bring old hereford back... make proleague rounds longer so its more about strategy than them shooting.  This is what the community wanted. sadly they now see the downfall.
---
I added my dXdiag, does this help?
---
video?
---
Alright I see what your your saying. So like a trap that slows people down. Btw the first sentence where you say bad idea isn‚Äôt a sentence because you need a subject and an action and you have none of those.
---
Did they change how crouching works? Looks like it‚Äôs a viable strat now.
---
Thanks for the kind words :)
---
I know. Predictive text misspelled it.
---
Not really oopsie, you do prefire the angle, she comes in and die, precisely because you did prefire, it's just that you do it because it's an healthy habit and because you actually expect a kill, but it makes you remind why you prefire that haha
---
The enemy is quite braindead in this clip, they don't react when their team is being mowed down and thermite casually goes for the plant.
---
It's not misspelled, you just wrote a capital R instead of a small one
---
I'd say ying but I'm a bit biased. Lately I've been using her in casual and I fuckin love her. Her LMG is pretty solid. 81 shots so just hope your aim is alright. 
---
Nothing more satisfying then playing secure area. Tossing candelas inside and going to town. 
---
I've also found an easy way to funnel is place your candela on one window and to to opposite side. Once you set it off they tend to just run or not do anything and you can pick em off thru windows.  
---
I know it doesnt say much. But my average KD is .91 and with her I'm almost at a 2.0kd.  
---
Something about her is so fun. 
---
And when its the enemy they seem to never take enough damage, even when shooting their head...
---
Meanwhile in casual you can call out that you‚Äôre about to be interrogated and your teammate behind the shootable wall won‚Äôt do anything and then immediately die after being revealed by the the interrogation 
---
Are there any minimum requirements?
---
Well, im comparing ubi to other devs and games where they seem to fix these small "bugs" alot quicker. And here in sweden, the 27th and 28th were normal work days where i believe they should have had more then enough time to fix this small issue. And consindering this is ubi's biggest esport title, they might aswell make more frequent updates, such as smaller and similar sized devs do. 
---
"HoW wAs ThAT nOt A hEaDsHoT" ensues
---
I just thought of this but is the original still in the game for Situations? I remember the first situation was on Hereford, is it on the updated map now I wonder?
---
I literally said I don‚Äôt care. I was making joke. The group I play with is three woman and one dude. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about some internet nerd making a comment.
---
They register fine for me 
---
The billions Of callouts and angles you need to know, how it‚Äôs so hard for Attacker and defenders to play their objectivesand the trillions of corners roomers can be in and how it‚Äôs so difficult to kill a roamer with fellow teammates and how it‚Äôs so easy for that roamer to escape. How the attackers have so many angles to watch where enemy‚Äôs can come from and how they are unable to watch those angles because the maps HUGE
---
It's bugged, and we are working on it.
---
learn to adapt. its honestly not hard imo. shoot for the dick.
---
Well buy sledge if you main him
---
Honestly, i just bought all the dlc ops with season passes, then grinded for the base ones. Its fun when you finally get a new operator after a grind. 
---
*J√§ger opens window to spawnpeek, gets thrown into space*
---
Yeah I want a space map too now.
---
i'll post multiple video on youtube by tonight.
---
So I‚Äôm guessing it not working still lol I could do with the extra 25k lol 
---
You think they would. Sounds much easier on making small basic maps than these ones
---
Ubi please
---
Well considering this account is 2 weeks old, has 5 posts only this one I am not sure is a repost and no comments. I am more inclined to think it more likely this poster isn't even human.

Git gud
---
Lol, I just put that user flair as fun. I removed it now
---
You're right. Its most likely just fast crouch spamming.
---
Sadly like dropshotting it just becomes reflex eventually and you catch yourself doing it and feel like a dick after.
---
Suck it up and lower you settings. FPS is way to important. 
---
(I meant that as light heartedly as possible)
---
Haha
---
I would team killed her
---
just requeue
---
hey look another person that thinks having a mini assault rifle on defense is balanced
---
Might as well give it to Thatcher
---
Looks like someone watched VarsityGaming‚Äôs most recent video
---
I have to agree with Guumees, Siege appears to be the only game in which cheats such as these are possible, which leads me to believe that there's enough spaghetti code at play to slap some parmesan ontop of it and sell it at a resteraunt instead of a game launcher.
---
There is 0 script protection, which is why players could utilise the scripts for the Chimera zombies without issue, and why Ubi had to rely on manual bans for those individuals. 
---
Try /r/r6steams, you'll probably have more luck there. 
---
But we didn‚Äôt lose üòé and Valk didn‚Äôt even die 
---
You are right. I feel dumb rn bc i have so many hours in the game and forgot castle and pulse.
---
Yeah i hope they add more countries to the game.  I am hoping for Sweden, Netherlands and China rn. 
---
But i am afraid you are right and they are going to add more American, Russian and German Ops.
---
Well ye, but old Hereford actually looked like a compound, not the new one made out of bricks
---
The fucking adrenaline rush  
---
Im not agreeing that we should have WW2 weapons in Siege, but Frost does have a Sten nd Valkyrie does, for some reason, have a Spas-12.
---
i think there are some exceptions to this like with soviet womble tbh

They why did you make the comment if it doesn‚Äôt matter? Sorry if I seem upfront, but I‚Äôve seen too many woman playing be targeted.

i guess that is the best answer ill get. to be honest im more annoyed with the meta abuse rather than the countering if it. but thanks anyways!

Get good moron
---
Okay I'm dne talking to you if you think drops hotting is a skill...... I think you should play a different game 
---
Try to logout of steam and ubi and restart your PC and then restart R6.
---
(I assume that you're on PC, on console go offline and do a hard reset/unplug the power)
---
lmao, good idea.
---
I'm so proud of this community.
---
I have the same issue, I have the Sony new golds and I can hear game volume but in game chat isn‚Äôt working so I have to use via party
---
I did that as well before still not working
---
client-sided game. thats the issue 
---
Yeah the Smg-11 was the only smg secondary that didnt get nerfed to oblivion. It has a little less kick, but enough. The best combo is for smoke and mute with the M590 shotgun with the SMG-11 with compensator, vertical grip, laser, and sight. For me personally, I use reflex, I like the sight picture and sight prodile over the holo sight, but that's just me
---
I kill them and then tell them to stop sweating in casual and then they cry.
---
Youre the one wanting to change the game. And you are the one saying he isnt having fun with the game.
---
Im enjoying siege more then ever.
---
Just turn on and turn off quality of shadow to fix it
---
i should try that!
---
I just came back from the holydays, for how long has this been like that? Is a quick hotfix that difficult to make from a complany like ubisoft? What the hell?

I tried it, it doesn't matter if you have it on uPlay or Steam, just buy the edition you want and it will be updated imediately( but it won't appear on steam).
---
Wait.. Girls do that?  
---
Personally just seems like a lazy operator idea.
---
The gadget description while basic just makes it sound like it's the same or similar to others already in the game just with a fresh coat of paint. Taking the description as is it describes electric barbwire, frost traps, kapkan traps and lesion traps.
---
It really seems like they realized electric barbwire is almost never used and certainly not off sight so this gadget is meant to fill that role. Also the "makes noise" makes it seem like they are going to make it very loud/noticeable which is only really needed because the sound is fairly unreliable in this game and why the other traps gadgets sometimes aren't good enough.
---
Hello Maresant, your submission has been removed as it appears to be a question about the Holiday Pack issue.

I once aimed over a downed hostage (their team did it), over a desk behind that hostage, and the bullet magically hit the hostage in the head... Wtf game, just wtf...
---
It‚Äôs had the problem the whole time it‚Äôs been available. Everyone who doesn‚Äôt have all the ops gets a free op and it works for them. But somehow Ubi managed to screw it up for us with all of the ops.

Don't be sorry dude. I'm not here as some sort of favela protest. I understand not everyone likes it. But it's not the worst map to be put in the ranked pool
---
Where's Zofia?
---
The blood spatter is pretty telltale, though.

Neo be like: Nah boi this aint it chief

I got 2 aces back to back about a month ago, forgot to let everyone know

some people have school, jobs, and activities so don‚Äôt have much time to get on, why don‚Äôt you share your tag? 
---
Year 4 not included its year 3 and back
---
Alibi and ash

All of them, including dlc. 
---
This bug happened in the last season, but you‚Äôre right that killcams have always been buggy
---
It's really really bad. I pretty much stopped playing the game since the new maps continue to be garbage. This will be the first year I don't buy the season pass I guess.
---
You could instantly tell because of the laser. Lol
---
he‚Äôs gold two
---
I love playing him in plat and dimond so affective just looking to have some fun on smurf but I‚Äôll get him anyway just to try hard if I need to not mess about cheers 
---
i like the  "*wait* *what... what the fuck"*
---
this.was.insane. i would have reported you ;)
---
Just instantly ‚ÄúFuck this, I‚Äôm out.‚Äù
---
It's my favorite clip of stop an interrogation lmao. It was necessary :3
---
I‚Äôm surprised you took that long to shoot! Especially after her head moved
---
I‚Äôm have this equipped... it‚Äôs not that bad in game
---
it used in bomb
---
It's quite sad they can't fix a small issue like that for 2 weeks. I'm quite sure it's easy to fix something like that for thoose people working at ubisoft.
---
Find good people to team up with. Always helps to be in a squad.  Make friends in the game. Keep adding players. Always play with a microphone on. Playing against plats is not always a bad thing since you get to learn a thing or two each time you play with them. And there's always a good chance of winning if your squad mates are good. Solo-ing after gold 4 is always a bad idea. Personally i don't care much for the ranks. I play for the thrill. So i don't mind going below gold. I love siege. There is no other fps like it. It's the only game i play 90% of the time. 
---
I have the same problem, nothing has worked 
---
You're on the spectrum aren't you
---
you're comment was comically, be a comedian, oh and don't forget your /s.

Actual facts

Hello ByteMe717, your submission has been removed as it appears to be a question about the Holiday Pack issue.
---
Why are you trying to knock down blitz and montagne?
---
Oh man dont get me started how this game has melted over to my real life, between cameras and where a good peek spot is. 
---
Proud of you &lt;3
---
Enemy had a better gaming chair
---
For the record the other team is purposefully making that happen. To fix it change any graphic setting. I personally lowered then raised my shadows back and it fixes it.
---
 Personally I fucking hate because its ridiculous and I'm one of those purists who wants every thing ridiculous taken out of the game. That being said I will remain objective about my opinion. Crouch and lean spamming does not make a good player in my opinion. It is team based game, and this should be removed as it promotes a selfish play style that has nothing to do with teamwork. The spamming was never intended by the devs and occurred as a unfortunate by product of not planning ahead. The devs have proven in the past things that were not intended will be removed from the game. The last point I have is the spamming favors 3 speeds and on a couple of occasions the devs have stated they wish to make 1 and 2 speeds as viable as 3. There was a speed nerf to 3 speeds in year 3 but seeing as this did not do much to the effectiveness of the 3 speeds, I would say they are not done with the nerfs yet. I would also argue the skill gap would be higher if they removed the spamming as it is harder to coordinate with a team than it is to use an exploit that makes server hit registration worse in some situations depending on ping.

Bartlett U, I remember kitchen and people would hop out with hostage and get gunned down immediately 
---
If you know how and when to flash a room and push....she's pure cancer.
---
In my experience plat and up attackers will not hesitate to throw 20 rounds at something vaguely player shaped. They pre-fire drones for fuck's sake. 
---
I don't get spawned peeked, I know about 97% of all spawn peeks with exception to fortress, new hereford and Villa but it sucks if your teammate isn't as hood as u and has thermite and gets killed.. and I'm currently Gold with a clearance level 278, 1.1 W/L and a 0.9 K/D... 
---
Not the best player but I can def carry my own weight. My YT channel shows my gameplay and I don't do smurf accounts... if I did I'd have numbers of a hacker, but been with my account SLASH180 since beta
---
One of us, one of us, one of us

Remove the damaged reduction from suppressors and they're balanced.

Half of the fun of runouts is getting killed by one and wising up and Glaz-ing their asses

Seems like it ‚Äúexists‚Äù it‚Äôs just not proper English. God forbid anyone not have proper English on reddit.
---
True, but when she came out I got a 3 piece on a monty, a thermite, and a hibana that walked past me together while I stood still on top of my prisma. Just looking for that feeling again.
---
Hail fellow Space Lizard, and Hail Nimrod as well
---
what the fuck? they can't ban you for whatever they want. that can have legal repercussions if they try to ban you for literally no reason. if they banned you for no reason, that's like them stealing your money.
---
that feels bad, dude. 
---
Huh?... it currently isn't an option... 
---
As I thought. 
---
Odd that I'd be getting tweets about it still being active then. Ah well.
---
Thanks for the replies all
---
How to counter blitz: shoot his shield because 50% of the time it is actually doesn‚Äôt exist it just looks like it does. 
---
Yeah, mine was never able to convert "at this time". Guess it's at no time now

Did u read the text? Or just the title?

We said that back when we bullied him Pre-Blood Orchid and look where it got us. He only grows stronger.

The Christmas gift that could never be opened. Just Ubisoft things.
---
Personally I think it's not a bad idea but it breaks some of the core mechanics of game. Firstly run outs are pretty annoying, ! but community created them for attackers  not to feel safe in outside of the map and nowadays its even a pro league strat so sadly it wont go away. Secondly camera spotting is a mechanic developed for dead defenders to not afk for the rest of the round. The idea isnt bad but it wont make it  into the game, especially counting on the that people would brag about AI auto aim being unbalanced. The 10 second timer like in hostage defend in terrorist hunt can be a good alternative.
---
The main bar in clubhouse is too open now. I don't find it to be an improvement on the old bar. The rest of the re-work is ok...
---
new one feels a bit more balanced but just isn't fun 
---
Update: pack disappeared... I better get a free elite skin from this 
---
Dude what
---
Pick one because you can't get both. The only thing that's hard to get is the contradiction between wanting a competitive environment with un-competitive games.
---
oh jesus. ive been playing since the middle of year 1 and i, along with most, dont feel this way. this is the entitled asshole atitude that everyone thinks fuels siege. people like this are a big part of the problem in the community. the fact that you and i still play after 3 years is the only reason theyre still developing free content for the game at all and i think thats thanks enough. they dont owe you anything other than a copy of the game for paying them. the experience is usually great, and interacting with everyone is likewise usually great. ther is infinite replayability in this game because of the environment and operators. i dont know what you expect, but saying you deseeve something for playing a game, at no additional cost to you other than the game price, while they have to pay for servers and a dev team is bullshit. plain and simple.

Wilhem Scream
---
Also use castle barricades on the outside doors or the doors most easily accessible 
---
That and they give shotguns better grouping
---
‚ÄúSomeone confirmed it‚Äù oh that‚Äôs for the reassurance now I know it‚Äôs wizzone21.
---
Ok i thought you get spawnkilled every time they spawnkill. Then if you have bad teammates i would think on using thermite or hibana if they die fast. Sorry for the first i Don't wanted offense with it but your first sentences looked like you get spkilled a lot of the time
---
No...not ‚Äúwoooosh‚Äù...
---
You must miss Bartlett Uni then
---
Unlikely. Bad for business
---
Lol why would you expect that
---
Someone put the wilhem scream on this
---
-69 respect 
---
Duck yeah 
---
He probably has auto-aim connected to the games firing mechanism. You can see the snap right as he fires a shot, evident in the other video as well.
---
I play solo, it's fine. Game is more alive than ever now so I'd just go for it if I were you.

Hello Acekata, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aby9j3/rainbow_seven_siege/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Maybe he‚Äôs just good
---
I never use lasers except on pistols, shotguns or lmgs, when I‚Äôm going up close or making a lot of noise. That red dot giveaway is not worth it for me. So many times I‚Äôve gotten the upper hand in an encounter because I saw their dot and prefired first.
---
PHAHAHHAHA FELIX REKT
---
Bro mo need to do that just shoot the the shield direct on. One of those bullets are going through üòÇ
---
I mean, especially if it‚Äôs rotated by random. So one team will get an advantage based on RNG?
---
No
---
No one was curious. 
---
1. The Goal: The goal for each round is for attackers to secure the objective in time or kill the entire enemy team.  Time is on defender's side, if the game ends without conclusion, defenders win.
---
2. As Defender: time is on your side. You either "Ancher", try to slow down attackers with you set up, be patient and let attackers come into your set up. Or you "Roam", occupy the far side of the map, and collapse onto the attackers when they push the objectives, or waste attackers' time when they are trying to catch you.
---
3. As Attacker: you have the fire power advantage and drones, and you need to push actively to win.  You can either "Frag", kill defenders with your raw guns skill and firepower advantage, "Support/Breach" by tearing down enemy walls and traps, and use your drone to scout ahead of your teammates, or "Anti-Roam" by tracking down enemy roamers for teammates to make safe pushes.
---
4. To learn the map: map knowledge is crucial to know where you should push and where the enemy may be coming from.  A great way to learn it for beginners is to go into custom games with no enemies, and learn where all the stairs are. They are major choke points, and help you shape the entire map in your head. Once you learn the map, cameras can help you know where the enemies are and make a move on them.
---
5. Watch your death recaps and your teammates after you die.  Try to fit the enemies actions into the above categories and try to imitate their actions. 
---
Yos

BEGONE THOT
---
Nothing else official. You can go on ebay or wish, I've seen stuff there bet they're low quality 
---
Hell yeah
---
Honestly I wouldn't try to get used to it at all. Melee in this game is so inconsistent, I find it hard to rely on it for almost anything more than opening barricades.
---
If you're really desperate, go through terrorist hunts and try to melee only, minus the bombers unless you just like to die and sit in the menus to restart. Should help you get used to whatever button you use to melee.
---
She's pretty good when you have a good team communication. Her guns are good too and you can get some easy kills when you know where enemy is all you have to do is just throw your candela.
---
I'm speaking in a general way, I've spawn peeked people and they leave game and I've felt bad about but only after they left the game... I know it sucks tho so I'm against it now unless someone tries it on me... u just gave me a great idea... make a video of 1 tapping spawn peekers lol
---
Sounds like very low level play, from your other comments. Information is everything in this game.
---
Yah defiantly worth it and if u are on ps4 u can add me
---
Except... you weren‚Äôt the one to buy this. This is a stolen image 
---
I‚Äôm a plat 3 lol
---
Try doing an ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew in your command prompt. I accidentally stumbled upon that when I wanted to see if it was an issue with my router so I connected straight to my modem and I needed to do that in order to get any internet connection. 
---
With a good team shes pretty solid.
---
WHEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVR
---
That's because you've only played 200 hours. There's a decent amount.
---
Ik this is from mission impossible from the comments, but can use link the scene? Just so ik what ur talking about
---
my sides
---
A person who watches anime
---
Un-friendzone him pLeAsE for our sake
---
Me too. I also usually choose the deployable shield because it basically forces the attackers to either shoow through the holo and get pinged or deal with it and lose time.
---
I can just imagine coming out the shower only to hear a THUNK and get my leg fucked up
---
It clearly says ‚Äúrotated by random‚Äù
---
If it‚Äôs a stupid idea Ubisoft will keep it in for at least a year or two.
---
Yes, it is still broken. 
---
Why does it look mega streched?
---
Be patient man, theres like over 100 people posting this about their missing renown, ubisoft will fix it soon
---
Clearly outplayed /s
---
Feel free to show me a screenshot of this supposed room. Did you mean Restaurant? Fountain? Lounge? There is no room called dining room.
---
You won't get lost or feel awkward on theme park once you've played it enough, it is a bit too dark though
---
i‚Äôm sad no one got my thanos reference
---
SLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIN'!!!!
---
Already hate the fuck out of Mr. Shieldface-- lets add a shield to everyone's face.
---
But all these rooms have their own distinct names. There's the "Fountain", the "Lounge" and the "Restaurant" with the kitchen next to it. A single drone sweep will tell you what the rooms are called.
---
Rails are my enemy.
---
Soooo still not fixed what gives?
---
You kinda can - that‚Äôs why I was asking about the auto click - you can just leave it clicking on the co-ordinates of the VOTE FOR RETRY button and every time you die it automatically starts another round after auto selecting the sight/operator to defend the hostage - if you survive 30 seconds you make 20-30+ renown - roughly if you leave it for 9 hours you can make 10000 renown 
---
And casual is a way of practicing with your mirror placements
---
Recruit OH PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
What?
---
I mean I understand how some are upset they they may not be able to use the renown to get the Christmas skin if it isn't fixed in time. But, hey you are getting a free gift maybe be a little more appreciative of that? 
---
He does
---
I forgot, communication online isn't real.
---
Lol .01! Does he always freak out this bad?
---
why does this sound like something I would do
---
What does RNG mean? 
---
I'm saying that at operator selection menu you'll be designated by CPU unless you choose yourself to be the 6th operator...
---
Try 400 you can ever trust the o2 around you
---
How the fuck have you gotten to that screen, mine just says error 
---
I legitimately left the room IRL to do something and came back with the secure area objective light blinking with my team losing their minds only for me to turn and dome an Ash who didn‚Äôt realize that the only hologram on OBJ was me all along 
---
you are allowed that opinion but no
---
Yeah, I know that. I work on mods for Cities: Skylines, I totally understand when someone wants a feature that sounds simple but requires a lot of tedious fuckery to make it work. It just bothers me when they say it isn't possible, as opposed to "It's actually really complicated underneath the hood, and we don't have the resources at the moment to get it functional."
---
Kafe isn‚Äôt a great map, in fact it‚Äôs objectively awful by almost every standard, but other than that I agree. OG hereford was poorly designed, and people‚Äôs defense of it is outright garbage.
---
I'm going to catch flak for this but I'm impressed not only for the free operator but giving us 25k renown in lieu of having them all. Granted its all messy but their intentions were generous and good to say the least, points for trying! Of course people are outraged they aren't getting their 25k right away, but there is a universe where Ubi gives us nothing...
---
Operation Health Part 2!
---
Yeah this is the first time I've been able to get to this screen before I couldn't even click into it but it just keeps saying that and when I click complete nothing happens but I still have the pack.
---
If you do offline t hunt you spent connected to the server so you dont get renown 
---
Illusion -1
---
Quit creepin 
---
I have his elite and honestly since it is first person it never bugs me. Lol. 
---
And decrease the recoil 
---
I spent all my 22k renown because I thought ubisoft had my back and I'd be able to buy the gingerbread skin with the 25k + some "Change"
---
F!
---
I‚Äôve only been playing siege for a couple of weeks now, I have this impulse as well and whenever I hear someone making noise in a room near me I mentally call it out 
---
no u
---
imagine adding content to your game without making it more buggy everytime
---
this post was made by not ubisoft gang
---
Ubisoft swaps grenades between few operators every few months. Capitao had grenades but they were changed to something else or given to someone else. Iq lost her grenades for Finka (her pickrate was ridiculously low, so they gave her grenades for higher pickrate). In 2019 I'm betting Finka will lose her grenades or someone else will get grenades.
