All operators know each other. They're all part of the same unit R6

Almost 4hours every weekend cause thats all I can stand at this point, and 2h during the week. And the smurf was when I queued by myself
---
Pretty much one of the best if not the best shottie in the game right now.
---
What do you mean by removed?
---
I've died so many times because of this bs so now when Smonk pops his shit in front of me I just run away. This client side mess really makes you angry and paranoid.

I would want to play with the radius of the gas cloud to balance the poison arrow. I like the EMP arrow idea since thatcher has to pick up a lot of slack as is.

Masculinity is something every man has to define for himself. My definition has been influenced a lot by shounen anime and Jojos bizarre adventure, so I find it humiliating to be shown up by anyone really. If a bunch of bros are arm wrestling and a hot chick shows up and beats all of them it can be really humiliating. It’s not her fault and her being strong isn’t a problem. I actually find it extremely attractive, but it certainly wouldn’t make me feel good if she just showed up and beat me in front of my bros. Did I explain that well?
---
The challenges really do ruin it
---
You on PC? I can maybe give you some tips on where you go wrong.
---
I never see him played 
---
One big thing is getting a group. The siege community can be toxic at times, but I've met some great people. This will make ranked experience so much better. Both in how fun games will be and how consistent the experience.
---
Beyond that, to improve your game play you gotta practice. Not to stereotype silvers, but most likely your aim isn't consistent. Play classic t-hunt on house as Ash and spawn construction everytime. Rush main and play for kills not to win. With a little time it does wonders. I have friends in silver, and it dramatically increased their likely hood of winning fights. 
---
Next in ranked don't be afraid to record your game play and review it. Look at where and when you die in games. Next pay attention what each character has to do to influence the likelyhood of winning the round. It's a slippery slope, but watching streamers and proleague to learn things like how they get in site or aim can also help. Remember that it's a different environment, so learn from things. Don't just copy.
---
Lastly start simple don't aim for diamond start simple something like gold 4 then 3 and so on.
---
Definitely not as developed as Siege it is at the beginning of Year 2 whereas Siege is at the beginning of Year 4 so think of the game like Siege was during Velvet Shell for development.
---
The game relies on 3 class types, support, marksman, and assault.
---
 Marksman have snipers (or in Enforcers case an LMG with an ACOG), long range scopes, and can mark enemies locations from afar, and cover them helping out the team.
---
Support have flying drones to find enemy locations as well as having special abilities like Toxics (inspired by smoke) which floods an area with toxic gas to flush out campers, or Medic which can revive teammates with their drone. Support have weaker weapons and are best used with the support of assault.
---
Assault have great weapons, stamina and health buffs, and great Frontline abilities like Pointman who has 4 flash grenades and 2 frags, and is immune to flash grenades and suppression. Vanguard has sensor grenades that when thrown scan the outline of nearby enemies temporary to help the team clear out areas.
---
Overall Ghost War is fantastic but nobody knows about it or what it was, heck I didn't even know it existed for about 2 years as everyone knows the game for the Campaign. Oh and you can be downed unlimited times and picked up in a round, and the maps are a lot bigger.
---
What don't you think wouldn't work? The " aforementioned sarcasm " didn't elaborate on that.
---
Sounds like your biased against Blitz, he's fine right now. 
---
Bruuuhhh i meant to time love
---
Being able to click a button to say that TK was on purpose and kick the teamkiller would make the game ten times better. I would take the risk of getting kicked because of accidently killing somebody instead of dying three times in a row to a troop
---
Keep playing TH. As far as I remember they are not accurate with the site
---
Why's a smoke grenade  there?
---
Sometimes I could play 7 games in a row and sometimes I get bored after 2. It depends 
---
But even if you play 3-4 games a day, 7 maps become repetitive eventually and you want variety. It's not that bad here because the mode is only available on the weekends, but if this were ranked, it would get boring eventually and I will have to take breaks or play casual a lot.
---
There are maps I dislike too (like Hereford), but having those maps once in a while doesn't hurt. 
---
Hey any ps4 players, is anyone else having trouble connecting to the internet despite it being perfectly fine on other devices?
---
Is that dead boi clutching his ammunition pouch?
---
Yes, I have that on, that is why I get the emails with a security code to log on to another pc
---
I feel like they've been trying harder to make rooms more visually distinct every season. Every room in Fortress has almost a completely different theme, compared to some earlier maps which tend to be more naturally blended together. 
---
Thing is though, there's *too much* distinction and it makes it barely possible to quickly get everything into your mind and remember it when it matters. As well as having so many themes that the simple ones like bedroom and bathroom turn into more (to the average player) random ones like sewing and loom, or fermentation and brewery. 
---
What made many of the vanilla maps so memorable to me was they instead made rooms distinct almost purely with layouts, with almost no two close-by rooms with even a similar shape. A garage and a main hall would *feel* different, and not just a box with a different art style applied.
---
WALL CAN WITHSTAND ASSAULT 
---
Ban Roulette? New strategy?

Can you explain how he's not overpowered? Because  in high ranks he's pretty overpowered.

---
Unironically using the term triggered. Thats a good start. 
---
Username was created when this was supposed to be a purely professional account, which it now isn't.
---
A map with balance issues is AN UNBALANCED MAP.  I don't just pretend my designs are good if there is balance issue, it would lead to me being a shitty designer. 
---
Your preference for variety over quality isn't an excuse to act like a condescending cunt with an unironic "lul git gud attitude". Oh and BTW thats why have been downvoted.
---
Siege is a competitive FPS, some players get enjoyment from winning and they like to win and lose based on who played better, not who got lucky with the defence and attacking rounds. 
---
You call me triggered but your the one having an angry rant because the majority of people who like ranked want to play on less maps that are properly balanced as opposed to playing on demonstrably unbalanced maps labelling them whiners purely for having a differing opinion from you.
---
Call it a challenge? One team having a distinct advantage in a supposed competitive game is blatantly poor balancing and anyone with sense and a lack of angry bias can see that. The entire problem is that two teams who could both be playing excellently, playing to the best of their ability, wont have their skill be the deciding factor of the match, but by pure 50/50 RNG of who got play what rounds. Thats bad game design.
---
Almost every game I'm in he gets played multiple rounds. Today I played in casual against two different 5stack squads that had dokk, lion, blitz and finka. The 5th wasn't consistent. Like I understand he may not be that good at higher level but playing against a team composition like that is not fun. Not the way the game is supposed to be. Again, this is my opinion. 
---
I'm sick of how often lion gets banned on every map even when the opposing team are a bunch of level 50 unranked players only because it's the unwritten rule of PL. 
---
I guess i need to practice against him. Hes just annoying to deal with. 
---
Keep him 3 speed just change the look of the uniform. Mira and echo are both 3 armored and look much smaller. I was only talking of cosmetics 
---
I’m level 97 so big oof
---
*q ueer*
---
The registration fucked up. It’s fine now.
---
Yeah definitely, my favorite way to deal with Blitz is to face him, and run directly at him and knife, your melee is faster than his, also his legs and shoulder are great targets to shoot at
---
Yeah, I’m not advocating why you should ban her. I was answering the question of why someone would *want to ban* her.  Don’t downvote me for answering someone question.
---
This is one of a reason for not playing R6. I feel like I am not in the game or something.
---
Try to find a person who from Germany. They are very friendly people and most of them speaking English.
---
Noise can stay the same, just as a side note. Slowing operators down a tad wouldn’t inherently make the game less fun, it just means you can’t run around like a headless chicken winning gunfights by merely running around. You’d actually have to position yourself well to win fights, which is how it should always be
---
Problems with Hunter:
---
Your ops wouldn’t work because they don’t follow the general pacing of the game. R6 is mostly comprised of people shooting at each other in certain strategic ways, and being limited to melee, or a cumbersome, single-shot weapon is a tactile disadvantage, to the point where your half-baked operators would be unusable. A bow is a significant downgrade from a normal gun, unless it does something unique and different that you didn’t specify, making it near useless, especially since it hinders your operator’s movement.
---
Problems with Haze: There are already operators that can counter a smoke and plant strategy, such as Pulse, Echo, Jager, or any of the trapping operators, but for arguments sake, I’ll consider Haze. You described him as a Glaz counter, even though Glaz can also see through smoke, which puts some guy with a club in front of a Russian sniper. Melee is already broken in the game as it is, and having an operator who’s primary ability is a melee attack that can be easily defended against wouldn’t be very helpful.
---
Problems with Bunker:
---
Not many here, it’s just not well thought out.
---
Was that thorough enough for you?
---
This just happens when any game gets more popular, it's a side effect.
---
Reporting them is the best way to go about dealing with them. 
---
if you can log into your uplay account, yeah.

Teamkill kicks are not battle eye, that's for cheaters and toxicity reports. Tk bans are a part of an automatic system.

Oh mate buzzing

No only on console

Frost shotty got a buff. I’d argue that it is the best shotty in the game honestly
---
I didn’t really consider the fact of someone other than OP trying to argue for these shitty operators.
---
“Am so proud with this community”
---
I know I was just saying that cause I thought you meant it was only for rainbow

This is epic

Last time I've matched up against him was when I was in silver (playing on EU, he's from NA) and [we got absolutely destroyed.](https://youtu.be/LnyRr8Rc2Gg?t=119)
---
  
---
The difference is he was diamond already in that clip, I was silver, and I'm still only gold. 
---
I'm sure you did buddy 👍🏼
---
Just sad that Ubisoft doesn't give blind gamers their own server
---
Hmm, Well, if you want to buy a defense operator,  and you don't have any ops from Year 3, I would recommend Maestro, he's not necessarily your style considering the ops you said you use on defense, but he's a good anchor with excellent weapons and a useful ability.

Must be Xbox only option because that’s not an option on ps4.

That's not nice of you to say darling
---
I usually play ranked with friends but I play some casual just for fun if their not on, it’s just annoying tbh and not right
---
Maverick needs some sort of sound SOMETHING so that he can be heard 
---
Lol wut
---
Thank you 
---
what did he say?
---
Yeah I do believe I’m going to get him. Although he isn’t fully my style, I like acogs on defense more than offense and he is one of the few that has one 
---
Because its same as casual but longer and with bans
---
But it may not be the full story, or you might have missed something. If you have the clip, just upload it in a new comment to avoid any confusion or issues.
---
If someone is running around you lose the gunfight it’s your fault 
---
"smurfing in casual" "kid" lol

Your bullet went right beneath his right ear. What you are referring to is his own bullet shell as the others already mentioned.

Dokk looking French for some reason, good drawing tho

I was playing rank and than Everyone in the match have a huge lag spike and one of my teammate left
---
Yes thanks
---
Uh, they have them in the UK shop “Game” pretty sure these are legit. u/UbiNoty any ideas?
---
Oof. I haven’t been able to connect to WiFi all day and I really wanna play invitational 
---
F or our LORD
---
Great for console, those enemies were a bit dumb lol
---
no it's just a special game mode only on weekends
---
Yeah it worked for me man! Ty
---
No
---
I dont come against much qe spammers and i dont really care
---
I want to like this weekend event but it's just too toxic. I wish someone did this for me so I could just get the challenge over with and go back to ranked. All I did was play Thatcher every round and I pretty much did the challenge in 1 game. 
---
Bad luck i guess, Good luck fixing the WiFi and play it
---
Me and my friends had a discussion about this, but i say maybe 1k renown for levelling up. Its nothing too special, but its nice. And can really help
---
I don't owe you nothin ):&lt;
---
I doesnt abuse hitbox, watch rogue9 video
---
Actually there was only 1 IQ in the video
---
These dumb suggestions
---
If they have a friend it does nothing, and there's no way to know theyre trolling. They could genuinely want any op banned
---
They absolutely do manually ban cheaters, I've reported hackers with pretty much circumstantial evidence through Ubi support and been contacted by the hacker themselves that they've been banned.
---
Great work
---
Ubi said they won’t.
---
I love this community 😂
---
no, it was because you need three team kills to get banned, or two teamkills on the same person
---
And that universal :^0
---
I don't like that there's next to no way to stop him *before* he makes a hole. Nearly all of his counters involve him already having made a hole.
---
Get good
---
I bet I’ve beat you on Xbox as I’ve faced many diamond m/k users that can’t seem to play fair yet shit talk mid game only to lose the match. 
---
no no no no if you like playing near the objective, like a room or two over/above/below... you need Ela and her shotgun. 
---
Find the room you want to hold down, place her mines in that room or rooms leading to it (NOT the objective) and throw your barbwire down as well. 
---
Use the shotgun and takeout anyone who hits your mines and is trapped in the wire
---
I'll never forget being told to "turn off your voice changer or shut up" I rarely use my mic anymore.
---
Click on the big ass banner that says Road to SI

Didn't one of Alibi's art also have her hold a Beretta?

Wait what do you mean by “we made various zombie sounds in villa” ?

yes. I'm sure

Lol ruined?... maybe causal hence the word CASUAL it isn't a game mode that is taken very serious by most of the community. I get the frustration but I mean that's why ranked was created so the people that care about competitive play can get the oppurtninity. Casual is more of a fuck around mode where people can try new things and strategies. I'm not condoning the killing it is shitty but like the others said you can vote to kick them and also report them. And once a player gets reported so many times I'm pretty sure they get a ban or some sort of punishment also I think they get placed with more and more players that also play toxic. So the hope would be they all get reported just enough, I feel like shooting back and killing them your becoming exactly what your complaining about lol. It's a great game idk why you would want to quit purely because the casual problem? But you do you hopefully you change your mind the ranked gaming is entertaining in seige.
---
Ye much better than the gimp mask.

Yeah I was thinking noise cancelling headphones had to be the only way it would cool.

Sounds awesome man!

Vigil does, but Valk can offer greater utility. Both are solid picks. Might I also recommend Frost? She's got solid weapons and, albeit one of the more obvious traps. It can always clutch a round!

Meme died

Is this game dying? pretty sure they've stayed consistent with approval rating and what not since 2015.

Shit

Hey you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there.
---
The MP 18 was a very ok submachine gun, but in now way up to modern combat use standards. If you wanted a kind of cool old gun that was actually usable, the M3 Grease Gun. 
---
As i said, there were positive changes, although i didnt really mind that change (i was kind of a bandit main not gonna lie) i still think that was a good change for the health of the game, i never said vanilla was perfect, i juts said its better than what we have now
---
Don't play it if it's frustrating you because then you'll hate it. Just take a break and come back when you feel like it because the purpose of the game is to have fun and if you're not having fun then there's no point. Also if you really want to get high gold or plat you gotta play with a team. I don't and I'm always stuck around silver/low gold. 
---
Back then
---
Right now, with pick and ban, starter means ubi is forcing you to either screw yourself, or just pay a lot more. There is 0 incentive to buy starter, especially when standard goes on sale more than starter.

You need to start at 1050 ti onwards, and that should give you, under ideal conditions, 90+.
---
And then depends on cooling and other stuff.
---
I was 114 on PS4 and decided to get the game on steam. "Oh starter edition? Everyone's telling me not to get it because it's a waste of money? What do they know I'll grind my way up". Worst decision ever, refund the starter and buy the standard lol. 
---
In Beauty and the Beast, Gaston ate four dozen eggs daily when he was a child. That’s fourty-eight eggs a day. As an adult he adds another dozen, tallying up to sixty eggs a day. This is nothing short of genocide.
---
My theory for why Gaston is beloved by the townsfolk is that some time prior to the start of the movie, France was overrun with poultry. Helpless at the claws of the chickens, the people of France were preparing to abandon their country, when a lone child stepped forward. “I’ll eat the eggs”, a young Gaston bellowed, “And I will save our homeland”. And so it was, Gaston ate and ate until he was roughly the size of a barge. How the cholesterol didn’t kill him can only be attributed to his inhuman fortitude. This is where the story turns tragic.
---
What Gaston hadn’t accounted for was developing an addiction to the eggs. As he aged, he ate more and more, and with the chicken-crisis over, his addiction began costing him financially. There’s a scene during Gaston’s song where he motions to a wall full of his hunting trophies. But why are they there? Does he own the bar? No, he sold them for egg money. The fact he never brings up his egg addiction or his prior heroism can be attributed to another one of Gaston’s defining character traits: his struggle to be emotionally open, and his modesty. It’s not easy being the man who saved France.
---
I think the saddest scene is when Belle shows Gaston the book, and he holds it upside down. See, Gaston seems brutish, but remember - his entire childhood was spent eating eggs. He didn’t have time for an education; he sacrificed his upbringing for his countrymen. He can’t even hold a book correctly. What Gaston wants to say, what he’s struggling to articulate, is “Belle, I’m dying. A life long diet of a quite frankly insane number of eggs has left my body bloated with tumors. Before I shove off this mortal coil, I want children, who might experience a world without the oppression I have suffered”. Belle cruelly mocks him, which goes to make you wonder who the real beast is.
---
When Gaston sees the Beast in the mirror, two thoughts run through his head. First, he sees his countrymen in danger once more, and despite being riddled with egg-tumors, wants to lead the masses to one last charge of glory since fighting for France is all he knows. Second, he realizes Beast’s head is about a month’s worth of egg-money. So he sieges the castle, and in one of Disney’s most tragic moments, plummets to his death.
---
Another reason Gaston wants to marry Belle is because, as mentioned above, all he knows how to do is to fight for France and its people. Gaston saw Maurice as a genuine danger, and he’s not wrong; consider the hellish contraption Maurice created. One look at that war machine and Gaston hatched a plan; marry Belle, and get close enough to Maurice to talk him down. Mind you, he did love Belle, and wanted to be the father of her children, but the danger presented by Maurice forced his plan into action immediately. When that fell through, he had no choice but to throw Maurice in the asylum (something marrying Belle would have fixed, since he would once again be close enough to Maurice to influence him). All in all, the failure was one of articulation.
---
Gaston is the protagonist of Beauty and the Beast.
---
Barbed wire is just bandit: slayer of drones.
---
71 odd, but he has the most pathetic drop off in the game. Worse than Cav's.
---
He was no more that 10 meters away. 
---
damn i lost a game like this once. the other team was just flat better than us and we couldnt get anywhere near site until literally the last second when i just ran into site. i thought the game glitched before i realized what had happened. 
---
Megamind was miles better than despicable me (voice actors, humour, soundtrack), it’s really a shame it wasn’t a bigger success 
---
I will agree, I've met some of the best people I know through this game but it also brings out the inner wanker in a lot of people and sadly that is what a lot of people remember more when they think if this game.
---
Also to see how bad it really is
---
Hope shit this looks amazing I got really drawn to the visor's shine lol

I only love the charms. Others are just meh to me. Skin isn't that appealing to me, since my favourites are gingerbread and sovereign which I already have, but the charms are downright beautiful.

What about the five *Golds* on the other team in the current system?
---
FFS this is not a one-team game. 
---
I might be a weirdo but I like the Thatcher headgear. It's like a budget elite skin.  
---
Nitro cell is just bandit: kill hungry manic
---
old clip?
---
That's actually pretty good idea. Keep the silence but still kinda audible sound but have smoke being emitted
---
Which is weirdly enough an actual thing. Mozambique drill is the name.

*Moderators do not whitelist for this.*
---
just to add to it. the game is focused heavily on being able to adapt and counter how attackers are attempting to move in. And they banned the dude whos ability is to sit still on a turret and get shot in the face
---
Ok
---
Or make it instantly alert the attackers as soon as you step foot outside.
---
You have to playing the event playlist for it to count
---
You’re a weird fellow 
---
You on casual or the SI game mode?  
---
Did you accept the challenge? 
---
People getting boosted to get banned but i’m not sure how that works though
---
Tachanka running with a suppressed SASG??
---
This seems veeery specific
---
What resolution though?
---
I've got a 1080 with a 6600k and it gets 100hz at 1440p u-wide.
---
1080P much more achievable to get 100hz. 
---
Most people are estimating the next season to start in March
---
how you dare
---
This also goes for bullet impacts on shields... 
---
I have accepted the challenge and I am playing in SI mode, nothing counts though
---
Sad! 2 scared 2 try 
---
You need a balaclava with a mouth hole
---
Some stuff doesn't seem to count, like nitro cell or barb wire if that's what you're destroying.
---
This whole thread is why Ubi should never listen to this sub. 
---
Its just deepfried
---
The whole season! I thought it was until the midway point/after invitational. Damn a whole season is harsh 
---
She's never really a problem in ranked
---
Give it a month you’ll come crawling back :P
---
How to use, one ban Ash, two ban Bandit or Lesion pick or choose. Wanna another for attackers? Okay  Jackal or Dokkabie. And you know why those two are there.
---
what u on? 
---
Xbox
---
cool I am 2
---
Want to play?
---
copper makes you a better player
---
busy 2day I could later tho
---
Needs a smaller head
---

You can, occasionally you can explode it or you can see a bit of the drone sticking out of the wall and shoot it

I won’t be on until tomorrow anyway :)

Dropshotting was a pest, but at least you knew they were going straight down. Crouch and lean spamming, their head could be going   any of 4 directions at any given time.
---
Ahh, so what he meant to say was a death. Maybe OP should understand the different , pal.
---
Now watch and learn, here’s the deal, he’ll slip and slide on this banana peel
---
Nice 4k
---
Did u watch the video?
---
How is that worked 
---
I’d say jackal
---
I'm very impressed 
---
Yep. He has a good gadget and guns, super easy to learn, good choice 
---
Yeah he’s a pretty reliable operator, I will Warn you, if you have the spare cash I recommend getting the Standard or Advanced Edition. You get all OG operators free and significantly more renown.
---
HE? HE!?!?
---
Same CPU too lol!
---
Yea the GTX 1660 TI was "leaked" and the performance is supposed to be below the RTX 2060.  So hopefully there are actually going to be AMD Navi cards that maybe will drive the other RTX cards down.
---
[removed]
---
Actually, what OP said isn't wrong. Getting teamkilled does count as a kill, hence the reflection of an added death.
---
ITS A SHE 
---
o ono :o owo
---
L
---
fair enough
---
Is our lord and savior a joke to you!?!? How dare you doubt him for even a second!!
---
I was thinking of maverick not gonna lie I’m tired af
---
That’s the best spin-trick I’ve seen to date. Excellent Job.
---
Me too, but all those skins are worth more money than the experience.
---
Really? So when I’m 0-0 and I team kill that makes my score now 1-0?? Amazing.
---
Yeet
---
But if you feel like getting one of the other characters more then do that
---
I saved this screenshot and reported this post as well as your account to Ubisoft and PSN.
---

---
I cant stop laughing
---
Damn,getting downvoted for a honest mistake my b guys I was thinking of maverick so I’d go with jackal out of these three
---
Thank you!
---
They havent left, we have been matched up like this from the beginning
---
Why 😂? Its not a scam, I’m not even a bot...so?
---
Thanks for the tips
---
I think i am gonna buy jackal
---
I hope not
---
Lesion and Zofia are good starting operators 
---
That's your problem, your thought process is too narrow to comprehend.
---
Talk about sailing a sinking ship just admit you misunderstood. OP said a tk’d shouldn’t negatively change your K/D ratio. 
---
I got a rank up in this match
---
Objectively, Jackal. Personally, Ying.
---
You are strong and wise and I am proud of you.

Wasn't the wall reinforced after someone put the charge down? If so, I can't really see why this would be a nooby play or something 
---
OT match point me and my squad did it after waiting an extremely long time in between rounds for some guy to load in. They had no idea. There was three seconds left and they ran into obj, the first guy turned around and TK’d the first guy behind him. Was hysterical 10/10 would do again
---
thats why i downvoted lol

Zoom in, to the sight.

I got the r4-c twice I was devastated

Nah, the ROF would've gotten the kill if it was higher but it skipped his head.

U can do the same with k1a though

Yes

Ash is more fun tho wym

That's bullshit. Run outs have been a thing since year 1.

I'm so glad that Ubisoft released this game mode and I do really hope that this gets incorporated into Ranked starting next season. At the moment it does have a slight "casual" feel because people don't care much about winning but that being said it feels 1000x better than regular casual which is a very good sign. Here are some things I have particularly enjoyed about this game mode:  
---
\- Pick &amp; Ban: I have been waiting a very long time to be able to use pick &amp; ban and it hasn't disappointed in this game mode. Not only is it an opportunity to mix up the META and change the way the game is played in general but it is a good way of removing broken or overpowered operators from the game entirely. For example, Blitz has been the first operator banned in about half of the R2SI games I've played which for me is a good thing seeing as I don't enjoy playing against Blitz, and evidently many others don't either. This can be used as a good indicator of which operators need further balancing in addition to the pick rate, win delta and other stats Ubisoft currently use.   
---
\- Increased plant and defuse time. The increased plant time is a very positive change in my opinion. Five seconds always felt very short and hard to deal with, especially when C4s, gas canisters and Maestro's evil eye is in play. I think one of the reasons Smoke is so weak and underpicked in Ranked compared to Pro League is because his gas canisters don't deal enough damage to be able to stop a plant unless he activates it before the plant is started. This makes him feel very weak and frustrating to play, especially on objectives such as Bank basement, where Smoke is theoretically a very useful plant denier. Increasing the time to 7 seconds increases his potential as well as that of Echo, Maestro and the defensive team in general to deal with a plant where they still have partial site control. Additionally, it can weaken the usefulness of frustrating operators such as Lion or Glaz with smoke grenades, as their window to cover the plant is decreased (ie Lions scan can only last 4 out of 7 seconds instead of 4 out of 5).   
---
\- Attack/defence rotation: Attacking or defending three times in a row is good because it helps to keep the same mindset for those rounds and not having to switch it every single round. Teams can also focus on their mistakes from previous rounds and try again the next round after, instead of having to wait for a round.  
---
   
---
With all that being said, here are some changes I think this game mode could use if it is added permanently into the game.  
---
\- Kill cams should still be available to watch. They are a great way to learn from your mistakes and your enemies actions when they outgun or outsmart you, which helps the game evolve even three years in. Removing them is most beneficial in Pro League where games are recorded and casted, and can be replayed by each team afterwards to revise their enemies strategy, but for an environment like Ranked kill cams are undoubtedly beneficial. Additionally, kill cams can be used to identify and report cheaters, streamlining the process for them to be ultimately banned.  
---
\- Points and hitmarkers should be disabled for everyone just like in ESL. This introduces a new layer of challenge into the game, notably where everyone has to determine themselves whether they injured someone in gunfights, how many gadgets they've destroyed as Thatcher, and in the case of trap ops be more observant to recognise when and where a trap is being set off. I do still think players should be notified when they deal team damage/shoot team gadgets so that new players can recognise when they did something wrong and learn to not make the same mistake in the future.  
---
\- When a new map is released, add it to Ranked for 2 seasons then evaluate whether it deserves to stay or not based on how competitive it turns out to be. This way the rotation is constantly changing without being flooded by maps that not many people like and aren't balanced or competitive. Adapting the casual mode to resemble Ranked as it is now will allow more people to enjoy playing a wider variety of maps without having to deal with casual's current frustrations e.g. 4-minute rounds (Get\_Flanked has made a similar suggestion)  
---
\- New operators should be exempt from being banned until the mid-season balancing patch is released. This is so that they can develop their own identities and that players (particularly season-pass holders) can at least get a chance to use the operators that they paid for.  
---
With regards to adding this mode into the game as a separate game mode from casual or ranked, I am strongly against this as somebody from Australia where queue times are already slow enough. Splitting the queues from 2 to 3 will have a massive impact and I think this game would simply benefit much more from having this as the Ranked game mode.  
---
I look forward to hearing what you all think of this :).
---
Solid operator. Easy guns, simply gadget. Fast, easy to learn. He is a great operator for beginners. Get either sledge or ash for attacking. Again easy to use. Simple gadgets. Both are great for beginners.

The problem is he is right but in the end a console is stupid by it self 
---
Me and my boys have done this several times - it has a pretty high success rate first round on bank. We are plat 1/diamond players on ps4. One time really sticks out though. We did it first round and succeeded. We never let them into OBJ so they assumed we had already defended lockers. We are 3-0 at this point so we now pick lockers to defend and do the opposite. We run to defend archives and put our mute jammers down and act like we defend there. I stayed downstairs and blew a smiley face with my gun in a soft wall. My team mates allow themselves all to die with around 10 seconds to go so the final KC is me looking at the wall shaking side to side.
---
The other guys actually messaged us saying they were reporting us for hacking. We even explained what we did and they refused to believe it 
---
Man this idea solid. I'd u tryna say its bad, give us some reasons why 
---
Please stop

Rip ive been getting the charms only ;-;

I’m glad you’re enjoying! Like I said before it’s a really rewarding game. Feels good to have fun playing

It was
---
every time one of these posts appears, the same thing needs to be said: ubi is at fault for alot of things that plague r6, but m&amp;k being compatible with consoles is nothing but their respective creators' fault
---
It’s cause you can team kill multiple people for the first offence. Like if you fuze a room and kill 3 people you won’t get kicked unless you kill the entire team, had you team killed again you’d have been kicked. It basically breaks down to first offence and second. Basically you TK so fast and one after the other that it counted for one offence 
---
That how Zofia work
---
Yeah it would be louder, so it doesn’t impact attackers negatively as well
---
What is that sound man tf 😂

Me: *at 3:30 recognise the actual place of the objective*
---
Also me: “omg top ten anime plot twists!!”
---
That was epic and fun, congrats.
---
I play pc thanks. Anyway, as I was saying. So you are telling me that people who use different controls, are pussy’s? They use a controller that helps them to aim, it still takes skill to use, and you need to have lots of practice to use a mouse properly. You think that giving them self no aim assist, more chance of fucking up, automatically makes someone the worst kind of person? I think you may be over reacting a little. You made this post out of shear rage, you must be one of those people...

Credit's not really enough though, they should be seeking permission before they post, especially since they're using the content to attempt to make money. So many pages on Instagram just repost other people's stuff, and think it's fine to operate with a 'take it down if someone asks' rather than an 'ask for permission first' policy.

Damn, thos muscles kick like a mule

Already posted

I remember being a victim of that. My team and i (we were all plat 3/2) ended up against a 5 stack of diamonds. On the first round we only realised that were were attacking the wrong side halfway through the round, but we took it anyways. Then we won the next two rounds and something was fishy... we ended up loosing 3-5. We messaged the guys to thank them 
---
But in most of those cases, the posters aren't trying to make money off it. It makes a difference.

Well he has to carry his gear to the Op Site so he can choose his loadout between rounds.
---
What if they made it so:
---
crouching actually takes time to do, and IS an animation, so you can't cancel it (you can still spam, but it will not be as severe as this Bop-it Ash)
---
Leaning lowers your movespeed a flat amount, OR leaning is also an animation you can't cancel without zooming out, and/or trying to lean from one side to the other forces you to reset to the middle first.
---
Yeah you cant shoot them straight at the mirror?

There are so many spots on this map to peek, it needs a complete overhaul. That is not even the smartest way to peek that spot, would rather beat a few holes into the soft wall next to this video and you can easily pick of couple off people without any real danger.

Also the one hallway between buildings is so dumb.

I don't think you can do this that well without a macro and still aim well.

Most diamonds can quicklean mid-fight, but crouch spamming to this level while keeping aim is just fucking insanely hard

More like, classic arthritis in your index fingers lol.  I tried it, it's just uncomfortable for long periods of time imo
---
What ops exactly?
---
You at least stood a chance against dropshots. This? Not so much.
---
Echo is one of the most annoying ops in the game has nothing to do with pro league and banning Mira makes a lot of maps easier to attack
---
The attack-defense rotation is ridiculous, it's contrary to siege's entire lifetime. Three rounds as the same side is an exercise in tedium, especially with randos and I'd imagine it wouldn't improve any if there was a rank tied to it. It's definitely more bearable with a 5-stack, which I imagine is why it is the choice for SI.

Yeah i dont know what raven shield is

Definitely a no with the reinforcements, but I also don’t think he needs to be a 2 speed. The issue is that 3 and 2 speeds are too quick. Nerf the speed of 3 and 2 speeds so that speed isn’t miles above armor in terms of value in this game. That would be a great indirect buff to Fuze.
---
3 speeds need to be the current 2 speed, 1 speeds can stay the same, and then 2 speed are in between. Not saying this is perfect, but it’s needed. 
---
Also, they need to change certain operators to become 1 speeds with reworks. Glaz and Lion could both become 1 speeds after their reworks and this would add more variety within the game as well
---
No, it adds a counter to castle. Since the removal of glaz bullet holes you need an alt option to make a hole to shoot through. 
---
Not really.
---
Only on pc

As a Mira main, this physically hurts me

That was clean
---
Do you really want to nerf fuze further than the pathetic spot he currently is, both in pick rates and win Deltas?
---
Bad idea, mate.
---
Except Ash is staying focused om killing somone and isn't getting distracted by random explosions and thoughts. 
---
What is this low quality sh*tposting?
---
Biggus Dickkus plays

It could 100% be a macro. There's different speeds you can set how fast you lean/crouch spam with. 
---
Invitationals goes as planned, so consistency isn't a problem.
---
Not guilty of this but probably the first meme ive seen in this sub thats actually funny. 
---
Huh, so that’s what that sounds like.

That’s true, well hopefully your next two free packs give you what you want, let the RNG gods be in your side lol

And you too my friend, let lick tip in your favour 🙏
---
Yes, and thanks
---
I can understand that and it is a bit far, I just think the "its just a video gane" is a bit flawed cause you spend real time playing and trying to get better then every few games you just get shit on by someone doing the gayest thing you've seen since 2 guys blowing each other. Thanks for the reply fam.

Next month.

3 on attack, and 3 on defense. So if you make even  text chat, you'll never have to end up with recruit.
---
The space button my guy
---
You make the rest of us look like cunts
---
Fuck you get banned really tolk 
---
That’s actually a 200IQ play, I seen someone do this on casual, he said it’s to make the enemy team rush us sense they outnumbered us, long story short..... we lose.
---
Thanks for censoring that. My virgin eyes can’t handle that kind of blasphemy
---
I find it better to not do that far left wall reinforcment and hold the window angle from behind the other reinforcement, tighter angle that not many seem to look out for, and you get a few rappelling up from bakery quite easily. 
---
trust me you're not smart as you think " mate "
---
Because pro league doesn't believe in using liabilities in their strats.
---
this one is better
---
boosting nah, smurfing yah
---
You on drugs or something?
---
Always happy to be the White Knight.
---
No, its fine as is. Its the price to pay. Even then, how many times are both castle and fuze picked in comparison to other operators
---
Imagine if they figure it out during prep, then place claymores, airjab and breaching charges all over the entrances of obj before starting to secure. Now you're all in the basement and need to rush back upstairs.
---
Still is funny tho, especially since the guy was inside "obj" and didn't realize that he wasn't securing anything.
---
not an r/whooosh
---
Its blatant cheating. if he wants to play m+k then he should go play PC. Seen a massive rise in high plat/diamond using m+k 
---
Yah its been happening to me for the past 2 days
---
Well, thats only true if you are against bad people who cant play anyone other than their main
---
It’s gonna be great 
---
It's never too late for the thought to reoccur, Ubisoft has said time and time again that they want a roster of 100 Operators in the game, they'll eventually go all around the globe with that concept, and the thought of the idea can still happen. You never truly know.
---
&gt; Yeah he stole it from coconutbrah’s YouTube video 
---
Should we tell him?
---
Do you not see how what you just said is toxic?
---
That's a personal question... 
---
Lmao, especially if you have toxic teammates
---
Nepalian Operators, that's something I can get behind.
---
And if your teammate walks in front while you're firing
---
yes it is genius. these ash posts are against the sub rules. Mods said these qualify as memes now because they’re posted every 5 minutes. try reading sometime 
---
Is it bad that I main Echo?  I just love his silenced SMG and yokais.
---
They were fine with introducing Blackbeard in a shorter timeframe. Same with Ela. Or Lion. Your point with testing kinda falls apart.
---
Ahhhh I love it!! Keep up with the great work 💕
---
Wut?
---
You cant buff a god
---
Thank you! :)
---
This isnt that "noob-ish" imho.
---
You had incite to where enemy was, firing at them displacing them, making them move next to an open window, then getting headshots and kills.
---
Seems like you know how to counter/flank that rush to me bruh. 
---
Protect - Lion.   
---
This is why it isnt a thing.
---
Your a fucking faggit can't win on pc so you play keyboard on console just so you get get plat fucking pathetic, on pc your ass a silver 
---
Encounter this fuckery each and every day my dude...
---
Ive experienced this same issue when downing doc. Its as if he doesnt take damage while getting up sometimes. 
---
I haven't even begun to peak
---
***P            E               E                  N***

Easy fix would be for them to put more of a delay on crouching and leaning. Instead of it being instantaneous, there would be a “motion” delay. Like In real life if you leaned left and right like that, it would take you a little bit to get to side to side. Should be the same for crouching. 
---
People always argue that realism != good competitive gameplay but in this case I very much disagree. 
---
Also just seeing this reminds me of cheesy CoD type mechanics in an action shooter, not something that should be in a tactical shooter. 
---
Bruh how did she even aim... I saw that over and over again and im just nauseous
---
Same :/
---
I watched a video about this spot and you dont fall damage dropping onto that ledge on 2nd floor.
---
A good blitz is far worse to play against then a rgeat monty. A great monty is just a pain. A good blitz just ruins the game.
---
You sir have large canisters of compressed air.
---
I agree that if he is picked he would make using smokes a bad idea but thats what countering something is. Aslo there's no real downside to using smokes were as this operator would make you think about it. Haze can only have his club out while his thermal vision is on so he can't just shoot people who can't see him. The ABS would stop all arrow types other than the broadheads because they are flying faster. I think when people say they don't think the bow would fit they are forgetting the other crazy not fitting shit other ops have but I do still see the point being made. Im glad you found it interesting and gave thoughtful feedback on the idea.
---
If they could just pick ONE thing and get it fixed to where or close to where it should be for good game play, that could solve many other problems down stream. For example, If they would fix the matchmaking, the toxic behavior from "salty try hards" (high gold/plats/diam's.)  on lower golds to silvers would be greatly reduced.  I've been ranked in low silver and been in matches against no less than a team of 3 plats to diam's. I don't care if it is casual, that's not going to end well for players that are either trying to learn, or just want to have a decent fun game.  
---
  With that being said,  The new mode of being like pro league has moved those salty try hards away from casual and making it a little better but you will always have the ones that just like to troll.  Those additional  picks for reporting would for sure be better to help game play.  Lets hope they get implemented. 
---
This is exactly what I do. Only issue is that you have to be careful with your lean as pushing on the side buttons can slightly throw off your aim. Can't imagine trying to play with default lean now. 
---
Just Take The Chill Pill And Relieve Stress with some casual

Hello az3rz, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/amqk3x/1v5_clutch_teammates_left_the_game_because_they/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Or he has to stop, get  birds eye view of the map and has to direct the soundwaves towards the location he wants.  
---
Tbh most times they do that cause they can’t afford a PC but can afford a 90$ adapter
---
He uses 6% of Shaggys power
---
As a guy that currently plays solo and doesn't even have a rank, I'm usually baning Caveira and Ash, since for solo experienced they're really annoying to play for pretty much obvious reasons... Cav is basically antifun attacking in solo and ash is so easy and effective it reaches obnoxious level of frustration when I play against her.
---
Turn Vsync off, you get 60FPS in thunt+situations
---
Skill was not crossed enough
---
I don’t know , to me I wouldn’t really feel better than anyone for abusing poor mechanics of a game. 
---
This is why I ban ash
---
Lol always wanted to do something like this but it would require a whole team and I’m a soloq. Try doing it in casual on a spot that isn’t even an useable site to see if people still fall for it 
---
To fix it switch what you vsync is. I’m on PS4 and I now get like 70fps not that it’s off. 
---
Anybody want to pay casual on Asian servers? I'm level 60.
---
That you having a shit connection you can see ALL the network icons lighting up from yelklow to red. 
---
whats going on here?, i see this in nearly every kill cam in every match but ive never seen anyone speak about it until now
---
oh, no
---
Xd
---
You don't. Never heard of a dev accommodating for high ping players beyond matching players of similar ping. Past that it's not their problem.
---
I see. You should realize that it’s hard to expect serious players in casual most players use ranked for serious gameplay and casual for fucking around. As I mentioned I preferred to play in casual to warm up, my teammates just use it to mess around while we get ready for ranked.
---
That's gonna be patched soon, ubi doesn't like cool neat tricks like that 
---
This is like that scene in Windtalkers where Nic Cage frags his Navajo codetalker comrade because the Japanese are capturing him.
---
Landed a lucky shot. Everyone gets a few of those if they play long enough. I bet he quits when I join the lobby. 
---
Aaaaand uninstalled
---
Its called Latency.
---
Yeah I'd love to see it if only for the laugh
---
You literally have to let down your guard to get the interrogation. You can get wallbanged, shot through windows .. you name it. 
---
Without the silent step she would be useless. And interrogations really dont happen every round. 
---
It's definitely not intentional so they will either make it easier to do or remove it.
---
Or be a weirdo like me and use B and N to lean.
---
You need impacts to get there because you need to break open a wall and sprint out into the beam, so I run Rook.
---
So...did you win?
---
Obviously, why do you think I'm listening for grapples and running a 3 speed operator? Not to mention once a spot or a plan quits working, I just find a new strategy and use that to the best of my ability. I mean, at least I'm not hiding in the objective room getting peaked like a noob.
---
You’re contradicting yourself. If you’re a better skilled player than you should be able to counter me and or out aim me
---
Might be a bit of a controversial statement but I am an echo main from his single drone days. I think ubi made a mistake giving him a second drone. It pushed him into the borderline overpowered category. At this rate they're probably going to drop each drone to one shot each which would dramatically reduce his effectiveness. 
---
There are ways to hack current gen consoles but to my knowledge most cheats are just game save editors. I dont believe you can even jailbreak your ps4 and be able to go online because of firmware and software updates.
---
Glitch, there are YouTube videos on how to perform this as well. 
---
I started playing December last year and this sort of thing is why I've played only 2 matches of PvP. I could take a shotgun blast to the face from someone I couldn't see but they could see me, either from crouching/going prone at holes in the wall, or by doing that qeqeqe BS. I play for the sake of having fun but it's nearly impossible when the majority of a casual match is people sweating off their respective genitals for the sake of a ridiculous kill
---
Ah, you camp on the beam, I see now. Yeah, Rook is a good choice for that.
---
Did they change her shield swap speed back?
---
No it is still very slow 
---
yes, i was at the dropper and killed lesion while he tried to defuse
---
What really pisses me off is when this shit happens on console.  We have no way of countering a mouse and keyboard, and these people take advantage of that instead of going to PC where they are equally matched or at least closer to it
---
Imagine this.
---
With cav
---
*crowd goes wild*
---
Or was this pre nerf
---
First gameplay clip i could watch due to the pure creativity and improvisation of a shitty situation
---
This guy play this all day everyday.  
---
Ying is the superior option
---
Idk about that. In my experience there's almost an unspoken rule you don't pick lion in ranked and I hardly see him in casual. 
---
Ok let me see your lucky kills 
---
I got it on my second pack, and I'm so happy.
---
No this was like a week ago 
---
I got it in my 2nd pack. I was happy as a little kid
---
Tricking the system in order to gain an unfair advantage against other players? Sounds like cheating to me.
---
It's because you can't trust your team mates to drone or cover each others flanks. 
---
Yea but that's just a trial and error thing. They would have the number the first day. The PC cafe thing I didnt think about and yea that would suck but also the cafe could find out who was on the PC or connection at the time couldn't they. Ban that person from coming there when possible. There is no perfect answer, it will just have to be a combination of small things to limit the amount it happens and that's about the best we could hope for outside of bad people not being bad anymore. 
---
This would be great
---
Yes I do, and though the nerf wasn't critically needed, but is justified. Her pistol allowed players forgiveness for playing recklessly. They could improperly round corners and still have the advantage.
---
BTW: your logic is flawed, good droning and mic play is overly generic. I could argue that every nerf ever made to any defender was unjustified because good droning and mic play would counter it.
---
Name me another operator whose utility is three items. 
---
Probably thirsty for kills
---
RIP your karma dude, nobody likes to jear the truth as you said. 
---
Bruh
---
Yeah I know how the system works, but siege has moving accuracy and 1 shot headshot. A lot of the time these players are strafing around a corner with acog and able to full control a spray on 1 spot pretty acurately while simultaneously swinging their head up down left and right. The fight is usually over within the first crouch or two, crouch fatigue would help those longer fights, but it doesn't get rid of the issue of not being able to track someone who's crouching and leaning in quick succession. They need to slow down all those animations especially for shields, there's absolutely no reason why they should be able to move that fast. Not even from a realism standpoint it's just not competitive and leads to a lot of gunfights feeling quite random.
---
cheating? potentially, hardly hacking
---
Extra detail of situation none of them even landed a hit, I was the only one to do damage to an opponent and not get glassed in less then a minute
---
That's not a real solution. I have high ping and if this thread is anything to go by then I have the advantage in most games. By your own reasoning other people with lower ping should just get used to getting stomped by try-hard third worlders. 
---

I’m guessing your talking about this post.
---
Yeah that’s why she was nerfed.  She was borderline too powerful in the lower ranks.  The dev’s literally said that.  Come on dude
---
My YT is the same as my name here. I dont typically post lucky kills, maybe sometimes. 
---
1st of all, you are a noob. Secondly, if you think that spot is good go watch some YouTube videos and git gud. The only reason that spot works is because your in that tier of players who act like they don't have thumbs. 
---
I guess you could consider it both if you really wanted to. Getting an XIM in order to trick your console, I would consider that hacking your console.
---
I like the idea of a smoke based ambush character on def because he could be easily countered by glaz.
---
There have been plenty of prolific games in the past where the networking issues weren't this bad. The point I'm getting at is that there are things that can be done to mitigate the problems with online play. Obviously you can't set everyone's ping to 0; that is just a fantasy. I know how these things work and AAA devs with networking problems this big are either incompetent or lazy.
---
*the FBI wants to know your location* 
---
I take it you are new to siege... So basically imagine blitz as Thomas the tank engine in speed, then imagine Thomas not needing tracks to hunt you down and that's a very basic version of him ps.. The fuckFace has the power of the sun in his shield..
---
All I want. Is the fucking ash skin, but nooooo I get a Pulse skin, an op I rarely touch
---
First off I wasn't the one who suggested the droning thing so chill m8, her pistol only did 99 up close. I mean really up close, at distance it became a regular 4 shot pistol, and to come back at the droning thing, that's all you have to do is drone and communicate OR pick ops that are hard counters to her. I'm guessing you're one of those low level babies that don't understand how to play the game so you demand a Nerf for somebody that doesn't need it.
---
Who made this
---
This what happens when you mix pure coke with Gfuel
---
I can understand the damage reduction. At 99 damage a 1 armour operator that has melee'd shock wire in order to destroy it (you take 3 damage per melee) would be downed in 1 shot. 
---
Same thing for if you had accidebtly touched a bandit wall, 1 shot up close would have downed you.
---
So to me that part makes sense. The rest seems to be similar to how they nerfed twitch. Make it so bad twitch players that zapped everyone stopped playing her, leave the better players to pick her and use her drones properly. For Cav they seem to be making her harder to play so the "worse" Cav players stop playing her, while the "better" Cav players can still down you in 2 shots and at a greater distance. 
---
If you place the circle a little to the right and up thats where I play as Doc
---
I have nothing against Brazilians in reality, jokes aside, but in online games i feel like the worst bigot when i end up in a match with them. 190 ping and a mic that sounds like a kinect mic picking up the whole damn villa they have on constantly. 
---
And this is probably just a joke man
---
r/therewasanattempt
---
Okay stop. She's not being nerfed. Overall she's going to be able to down people from further away. And yes, increasing her pistol recoil is completely warranted. 
---
no they dont have to accept that. r6 is casualizing the experience so ubisofts game can be sold in more countries around the world with less servers running. its one of many reasons people make fun of this game for being "esports ready" when ubisoft says they care on the 1 hand, but on the other there are things like client side debris, broken sound, and lag compensation, just to name a few.  
---
csgo does not have that mechanic in place. if you have 150ms in csgo, you are at a significant disadvantage. i see no reason why rainbow 6 cant have that same system aside from ubisoft wanting to save some money. 
---
Please cut the ban timer down to like 15 seconds. If someone goes afk (which it seems to happen a lot in solo queue) it takes way too long
---
Well you at least downed the person in the back
---
was real as far as I can tell
---
Karma for your stupidity 
---
Yeah lol. Thanks. 
---
Damn
---
I made a thread about this a while back and got downvoted to oblivion. You people are strange.
---
Hahaha the death animations are all just falling to their knees
---
Guess its time to switch to PC then.
---
inception
---
well look like i'm the only one that find this mode boring, especially since they obbligate me to play 3 rounds in row in defense or attack.
---
or maybe is because is i do not play it with ranked mindset and just like a casual with different rules,
---
i really find it so boring that often im not able to play 2 or 3 games before close the game things that does not happen in ranked (usually im able to play 5+games)
---
bruh
---
That’s what I’m saying have to know so much about rotations and flanks and if you’re running around the attackers and your silent step runs out your fucked

Ah, right. 
---
He means rewards like alpha packs.
---
Charms and alpha packs from challenges won't show untill you restart the game.
---
I mean if you accidentally TK someone, and you verbally say it was an accident. most people don't try to vote ban you, so if you're getting vote banned you're probably doing it intentionally. Just in my personal experience and I've been mid-high gold every season.
---
I liked hibana before, I think this could be a lineup for an elite here. 🤫
---
I think that some sort of fatigue system would definitely be welcomed...but I LOVE the idea of a ping cap for ranked
---
It is one message from him with two lines
---
Ah, “activate windows” I see you’re a man of culture as well.
---
Someone "roaming" by camping in a room theres no way you can drone out isn't good map design. "JusT iGNoRe tHeM bRo" doesnt work. 
---
Yes I do program. You have no idea what you’re talking about. You probably just copied and pasted a Wikipedia article. You’re last paragraph made no sense, it was pretty funny. Post it on r/programmerhumor
---
No in terms of op use 
---
Noice.
---
Yeah you need to know the map a decently well amount and gotta be good with her pistol, the sites on it a little iffy as is
---
Ty
---
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Nice
---
Oh ok, in that case all operators take some level of skill, especially to play them effectively 
---
Thx
---
I blame lag. And you using Reshade. 
---
I feel retarded now, though I probably would have noticed if I'd actually had looked at the chat when it came up (was talking to someone in the room at the time)
---
Yeah the sights are a little wonky and with this buff/nerf coming the recoil is gonna be atrocious 
---
Competitive game play only exists on pc so.... try harding on ranked I guess?
---
Lmaoo 
---
And they're taking damage if you didn't see that. Which makes no sense "her secondary is OP" it's her fuckin job 😂
---
Once I saw a guy was banned by BattleEye with name Battle.Eye 
---
1. what i said has nothing to do with that scenario. do you not understand that balancing this game around coppers ruins it for the pros and makes pro league impossible to play? this is why they shouldn’t make balancing decisions around lower levels. it’s pretty simple. 
---
2. nice job pointing that out genius. so you’re saying that a shield can’t stand up and then crouch when there’s an enemy in front? didn’t know that was impossible. it’s literally common sense. or is that too hard for you. 
---
3. okay so let’s say the fuze lion combo is hard to deal with (which it really isn’t) why would you honestly want to make countering it more difficult. 
---
4. i don’t even TK nearly as often as you do apparently lol yeah but you’re right i must sound like an avid teamkiller. you’re really on point with these analogies that don’t actually work. honestly say what you want. it’s clear you can’t use any type of critical thinking and i don’t know how more clear i can make it for you 
---
Thought that was the case tbh
---
I throw out of CEO personally.
---
I enjoyed watching that, thank you. 
---
I know it’s so stupid at least the drop off range is getting shortened 
---
I'd rather wait 30 minutes for a normal casual match than an ongoing one. Just sayin.
---
Did you just copypaste this
---
That would cause enormous input lag
---
&gt;*accidentally*
---
Ah my bad. 
---
If you own the game on uplay just buy the season pass through uplay. If you try to do mixed platforms game on one dlc on another shit gets stupid.
---
Ever since I got him I’m slowly becoming one.
---
Than elaborate since you're obviously smarter than me. That the years I spent studying programming are nil compared to your obviously superior knowledge of the subject
---
See now the damage drop off, yeah that very easily could be changed that's pretty OP but the actual damage, that's fucked.
---
As a high silver, they really need to crack down on the fucking keyboard faggots on console... It's bullshit because people drop rank and ruin everyone elses fun
---
Restart. Simple
---
Looking for hostiles...

Dang I hope they don’t remove this spot

Can we get away from the ELO system since that's meant for a 1v1 situation. I would like MY rank to be affected by MY contribution to the team. Not if my team wins or loses. I would like for this new matchmaking playlist to be the new ranked, and more than that, just mimic pro league rules 100%. That's why we play ranked, we like competition and more likely than not, we watch pro league. So if you would make this mimic pro league and change the ranking system to analyze my contribution to the team (also round based instead of game based), then that would be PERFECT.  
---
There are many ways to determine my rank, k/d, bomb plants, assists, ping assists, kills around my drone / cam I'm on, bomb carrier. The support player gets shafted in a team based game. If I'm doing my role as a support player, i.e making call outs constantly, planting the bomb, opening reinforcements, my rank needs to accommodate THAT, not if I win or not. The ELO system is not the right system for this game since it was made for Chess.

I couldn't have done it if it wasn't for my friends callouts. :)
---
You are very fortunate. It's a very common occurrence for me. I take casual kinda serious as it's a warmup for ranked so I get either kicked because I'm taking too long or I get TK'd the next round. 
---
That little shoulder dip Clash did when Monty went after her is why the "*Just melee her*!" response to a 1v1 with her is BS. Any competent Clash will know how to do that so you've got about .4 of a second to shoot her FOOT when you melee her and that's it.
---
Dude, I see this shit in fucking gold nowadays. Ridiculous.
---
Disgusting, I hate players like that 
---
I think it's your problem. On my PS4 everything works normally 
---
Restart the game
---
even her identity is a lie just like her race
---
I HATE WHEN THIS HAPPENS
---
It’s a violation of ubi’s rules, they’ve banned the usage of the official mouse and keyboard, the only way to use them on console is with a xim adapter that they can’t detect. Also this is a gaming forum, what do you expect people to discuss on it if not cheating issues? I think you’re a xim user
---
Did you make sure to add the challenge in your challenges menu? I forgot about that until I completed the challenge this morning and now I feel like an idiot.
---
I’ll be honest. I’m on a keyboard, but I could never pull anything like this..
---
Same, it completely ruins your defence setup :'(
---
This happened to me. I had to go into my computer sound settings and change several things. 
---
Definitely fingerless
---
Seriously, the top PS4 Siege streamers all use controllers and they're Diamond. I play with a bunch of them and people constantly say M&amp;K, nope just a lot of controller time.
---
Even if he can’t, he can just uninstall the steam one and use uplay. As long as he uses the same account everything will carry over between copies.
---
*Jazz Music Stops*
---
Do you know what you changed?
---
Even still. With mouse and keyboard... he could barely see the guy, and leaning so much like that... how he hit that shot is amazing 
---
Never said US was innocent. Doesnt make Israel any better. Apartheid state. 
---
Well he gets his 75 health immediately so that might be it. 
---
This is why I quit playing 
---
Basically. Or wow this map is pretty cool, I wonder what I'm eating for dinner tonight, wow that's an interesting corner.. dead. 
---
okay thx! i´m on PC but still thanks for the info!
---
Imo no. If you play enough you can buy the ops with renown. Maps are free. The only upside is you get a free skin with the pass, and a 10% discount in the shop. But it’s up to you really, as it is your money. 
---
Ffs, sort it out ubi.
---
I searched your name last year you were 2,765 and deranked to 2.154 wow 
---
Thanks!
---
EUS is NA-east, it stands for East US. The names for the servers are always Compass point then Region
---
That's exactly why he doesn't.  They explicitly said they didn't want people to ever choose Recruit over a normal operator.
---
Dumb decision, but apparently they're standing by it.
---
Used to play him alot in the past but switched to hibana because lots of times there is no hard breacher. Buck is pretty awesome though. Very under used IMO.
---
Man ... the worst thing was the part that he was 0.4 seconds late to kill Maestro. But you have to love the "it works before ypu fully put it" thing.
---
Yeah, I understand the skill tier whatever where she does require skill as you as a player get better, but unless you push and rush with her, meh.
---
I didn’t know who made it someone sent it to me on insta I decided to post it here he didn’t say who made it lol

Your fine that wasn't abuse of the lean spam you didn't t bag around wiggling back and forth I'm certainly sick of having every enemy wiggle at me but that was just good aim and a smart play one big dick energy for you my mans 
---
Twitch is better because if you play IQ I find myself just walking around looking for gadgets and getting taken out before I can get to em. Twitch you can get a couple in the prep phase and also if you want just want to hang back and sit on your drone and stay alive you can get more. I finished the challenge in 5 games with Twitch so I’d say it’s pretty effective
---
Even I got scared seeing pulse rushing around the corner with his shotgun
---
I don’t see it.

Silver IV well that explains a lot

Buffalo if he plays on pc, suddenly the enemy is difficult to play against

It's more for the visual evidence which just provides more concrete evidence.

That isn't K&amp;M, my friend's killcams look exactly the same. Over the mic you can hear him slamming hit analog sticks back and forth

*uses both reinforcements*

I personaly think this is one is awesome... 
---
I don't know why do you have such a big problem with that 
---
Shit man be careful with that that's a eo16 coffee can filter those babies carry a metric fuckton of asbestos if the case cracks or you breathe through it you're most likely screwed as asbestos divers can cling to clothes walls and the inside of your lungs please tell me you haven't breathed through it for an extended period of time  also  the 81 is the manufacture year so the filter its self is most likely quite old and fragile do not leave it lying around put in a air right box or dispose of it in a safe way

So u beated the cancer with a knife… That's interesting
---
5-7 shield and MP5k recruits are *BIG* smackers
---
Plus, having barbed wire as well as a block of C4 is great
---
Not to mention the ability to demoralize the enemy team by slaughtering them using only recruits
---
You know Ash isn't all about rushing, most of the time actually coordinating with your team and going for single entry frags is a lot more effective than just brain-dead running in. 
---
You are the problem with this game on console and I hate you.

Only in console casual

Wow, then I have shit internet

Check out Get_Flanked, and I’m sure this sub would be a great help, ask away, most people will help out.

Make it so the crouch fatigue resets when stationary?
---
Didn't know that It could crack. Definatly haven't breathed thru it, the day I got it I put it on r/whatisthisthing. They told it could have asbestos in it no I've just kept it in the bag. Thank for the advice!
---
Yeah, I was trying to say that, but I try to play Monty as much as possible, so that's just what it looks like for me
---
Well there is the recoil update.
---
He is in no need of a buff.
---
Nah it was some kind of visual glitch
---
You’re not alone

All good xbox USB port just died but luckily it has more then 1

Why is this issue getting worse recently? It's not like it hasn't been possible until recently but it seems to be a lot more common.

Hello dobstp! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
I really like get_flanked on you tube. His explanations make sense and he has a good polish. SiegeAcadamy is good if you wanna read. I've been playing a couple of months now. There is a lot to learn. Welcome!! 
---
I'm just trying to understand why there is no way to avoid being kicked.
---
That's what I want to know.
---
I don't think I could hit all those keys while strafing left.
---
They don’t need to fall for it, I assume by running into his los. If they don’t peek, it’s a much easier plant, and retakes are definitely attacker sided.
---
As it stands, glaz is way too strong at one thing (smoke push/plants) and sucks at most everything else, except plane, except plane isn’t in ranked. That’s why he’s unbalanced. 
---
noone takes the clutch or kick thing seriously
---
Alright. Never saw that glitch and with the lean crouch spam macros, you never know.
---
What?
---
Yeah, it takes coordination—big whoop. 
---
I also can, but you need to consider the pacing and how he immediately shot a person, as soon as his body was barely visible. That's not a normal reaction time. You should try to do this exact thing he did, at the exact same pace. Post your results. 
---
I don't want to find out really haha
---
I only vote kick possible clutches if the person is like copper 4 bad/staring at the ceiling

I know everyone wants you to make this ranked, but can you make it casual as well. Pls. 
---
Gaming atoms

Im on console too. Mostly everyone I see is a complete potato and has no brains at all.
---
Yeah I mean fuck realism amirite?
---
Honestly it seeks like it.
---
its literally the only good objective to defend on this map, even tho its annoying to attack on it they cant do anything about this site if they wont buff other sites
---
Who posted it a day after coconut posted it on YouTube.
---
So that'd make kgo130's post the first Reddit repost lol
---
I love how console players are aware of their surroundings.
---
Yeah he is very underpicked in ranked at least the charts say this (plat and diamond) but i can prove you that I cant see him often and gold. The only reason behind ubisoft not buffing him is because of the pro players... He has an incredibly h8gh usage there... 
---
This isn't a glitch, spamming lean/crouch while moving around is literally part of the game.
---
Were you copper?
---
I got 2 and they were hibanas rifle and I don't own her,and the angel
---
lol noob u suck
---
get gud
---
you're not even ranked and you get carried
---
by the way I fucked your mom 
---
now prepare to get tked 
---
/s
---
In the photo it looks like there is enough room for the slide though.
---
what did they do to deserve that op selection
---
In starter edition you only get 4 ops to start. 2 attackers, 2 defenders. What happens if the two ops you have get picked? Recruit it is. 
---
Spamming crouch and lean do not have to be done with macros. I can do it with my keyboard easily right now and I don't use macros.
---
There's literally no proof the player was using aimbot, you're just making this up. If the player was using aimbot, there would be no need for him to spam crouch/lean, he would just straight up stay aiming in the direction of the OP and quick-peek him instead of spamming lean/crouch.
---

Correct, would be impossible to *wiggle* like that precisely

“Everyone in this game is toxic”
---
“There’s some nice people who play the game”
---
*HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM*
---
You don't need macros to do this.
---
yeah it was kinda of toxic 
---
You can do anything except move. Shoot, lean, crouch, prone, whatever, as long as you don't move.
---
Imagine the controversy 
---
Expect to have a rough time the first 30ish hours until you understand the maps. Knowing where enemies possibly are hiding and what to reinforce and ignore is a large part of learning. Have fun tho!
---
Ay I’m just trying to catch some attention. I’m here for discussion alright. 
---
Wait can attackers pick armour up?
---
I’ve seen a downed ash haul ass across the map on pc. Funny shit.
---
These discord memes are taking over! And i like it :D
---
Maybe you should expand your horizons
---
True, idk why people ban ops "because pros do it." It's like, you aren't playing on the same level as pros, you should play at your level.
---
Should there be a night version of Fortress???
---
try to play this game at nights, this 9-year-olds are sleeping at their mama's bed.
---
Holy shit dude, you are making gigantic assumptions of a player in a random reddit clip. I see this shit in Siege every day in gold and plat. If this is your first time seeing this, then you are wayyy out of touch with how Siege can be played.
---
You also probably don't know what smurfs are, because good players can purposely de-rank and play like this in copper.
---
You don't need a macro to do this, it's piss easy to pull off with a regular keyboard.
---
Hahaha just noticed that, no clue. I remember I was solo q and these guys did there own thing. They must not have liked me before because they said I was “redeemed” after I did that.
---
Maybe but I fell in love with cav and am not really interested in playing other characters, unless I’m getting hard countered anyway 
---
I think it's more exciting to be forced to change up your strats and tryout new ops but that's just me. Only making particular ops is just boring to me
---
Honestly my opinion would be to play casual till your high enough to play ranked, much better environment their, you’ll play with your skill level and you’ll get better at the game. Ranked isn’t as hard as you think it is 
---
Silver 3 and lower is the lower 50% because the majority of untangled players are worse that silvers
---
Droning and calls is probably the best advice I can give for  for entry fragging. Need to know the approximate location of defenders.
---
Roaming is all about three things.
---
1. Holding key positions
---
2. Delaying the attackers, even if it means dying.(You don't have to always get frags.)  
---
3. Patience.  
---
If you pause right before he dies, look at the numbers above his gadgets.
---
Thanks for the advice much appreciated 👍🏻
---
I swear I've seen like four of these posts in less than a week.
---
George Michael:"Ash's hitbox."
---
"Who?"
---
"Ash's hitbox"
---
"Jägers acog?" 
---
No that’s actually caboose he’s just angry 
---
He also might be referring to the fact that people seem to be more sweaty on casual than ranked. 
---
Buck’s the shit.  He’s become my favorite attacking operator with Sledge being a close 2nd.  
---
Im sure that not 100% of all solos would play solo. And if the 4 man squads wouldnt suck ass atleast half of the time then we wouldnt be all agreeing to this maybe? And if there are plenty of resouces to get a 5 stack as a solo then why dont you get that one solo for your team and play as a 5 man? Wouldnt that be much simpler? Instead of taking that one solo that you dont know who either is too shit or too good for your team?
---
When the server allows a tactic allows players to see the enemy far before the enemy can see them, I would count that as an exploitation of mechanics. If you don't, that's fair enough, but I'd still have to disagree.
---
yes you can spam lean and crouch without a macro, but it was pretty obvious he was using one here. and if you’re telling me that him shooting at him before he even knew he was there/was on the screen isn’t aimbot, you’re definitely new to the game and have no idea what you’re talking about
---
Source? 
---
Ah thanks for the correction 
---
ITT Lol fuck you man, the p90 is bad bc I don’t like it’s recoil pattern and I’ll downvote everything you say against that. But gg so I don’t get downvoted.
---
This is utter shit. 
---
No problem, I never play casual I’m like level 221 and I remember being scared to play ranked because my friend said it was really hard , put it off till like level 70 ish and then I said I would give it a try , I started off low silver with like a .6 kd now I have a 1.3 and I have a whole shit ton of knowledge about the game lol
---
I don't think, they have 2 gadgets that's really good, no need for them to have too much weapons
---
well it's a fact that with a controller you are less responsive and accurate than with kbm, so it really doesn't surprise me

I tell you, had a run out on cafe, saw the fucker come charging around the corner as if he still had the element of surprise - but was instead saved by the goddamn lamppost there on the corner catching about 5 bullets.
---
China would like to know your location.
---
While they are at it, they should completely remove both crouch and prone actually. Would make an even greater game, eh?
---
If they just fix the client-server side desync, everyting would be fine. Though, honestly, a crouch fatigue would be good since R6 was supposed to be a "realistic" game and crouch spamming is annoying as hell.
---
Yeah as soon as I can play ranked I’m gonna give it a shot

Nope everything medium as usual

LUL is an emote on twitch that’s a picture of TotalBiscuit laughing with his hand on his chin
---
Yeah I know he was joking, just came across to me like he was implying that the peek shouldn't be in the game because rainbow is more realistic. Guess I got that wrong.
---
I mean it wouldn’t matter to me as an attacker, but I really love cav and don’t want to play another defender, so long as she’s working for me. I think it rewards bad counterplay, because you can just counter a character your not doing good against with a ban 
---
Mira is a dumpster machine
---
Lol now you're just complaining about playing with people when they do bad.. you're that player that sucks ass some games too bud. And maybe theres a reason someone has not made a thread complaining about the solo player they get randomly? Because they know it's their choice to not go find a 5th?
---
It’s really hard with a controller 
---
He's referring to the hacker youtuber
---
Blyatiful.
---
&gt;yes you can spam lean and crouch without a macro, but it was pretty obvious he was using one here.
---
Lol...and where exactly is your evidence to prove this was sO oBvIoUs?
---
&gt;and if you’re telling me that him shooting at him before he even knew he was there/was on the screen isn’t aimbot, you’re definitely new to the game and have no idea what you’re talking about
---
Lmfao dude, you literally just proved to me that you're the one who's new to the game. Anyone that played a shit ton of Siege knows all the common angles and pre-fire spots. Do you know what a pre-fire is? It's when you start firing at a certain spot before you actually see the spot so that there's absolutely no delay for your bullets to hit that spot.
---
High-skilled players that have a lot of map knowledge will pre-fire common spots because they know there may be people holding those angles. Ash literally just pre-fired a common peek angle from Train room.
---
Thanks for proving that you know literally nothing about how Siege works, and the fact that you don't know what an aimbot is or how it looks.
---
that cod melee crap is such cancer i hope they remove it 
---
He should’ve aimed for the head

Yeah there’s certain things I don’t understand. Earlier I was playing and I took about a minute to load into the round after picking my op and someone said to kick me, we loaded in and then someone started the kick vote. After that one hiccup I loaded in just fine. 
---
I’m not crying for attention, I’m here for discussion and you’re just proving that a lot of people in this community are toxic. Just because I complain about something doesn’t mean I’m crying for attention.

---
If not, find you motherboard model, Google it and download the main drivers for it from their website then reinstall your Nvidia drivers.
---
I had an issue where it would never let me go to 60hz and this is what fixed it for me. 
---
Twitch and Fuze have had their operator cards changed, Twitch in the operator screen used to have no eyebrows so they changed it
---
That's what makes it a competitive game. You can't win in higher levels with mediocre aim, that's the point.
---
Out of the loop, someone explain? 
---
I never blamed that player, I never said anything about this guy in question. But since *you* did, so will I, if you look at the footage from OP, we can see that OP did not see that player at all, but the enemy Ash did have enough time to react and shoot (even if it was a prefire). Why did the Ash have this amount of time? Crouch lean spam. If the Ash had peaked normally, or even quick leaned, the server latency would not have been so large. Yes, I know no game is perfect. Yes, I know this is in every game. But in recent seasons the Devs have managed to bring the servers up to s ratch so that *normal* tactics and peaking will no longer make it so that the peakers advantage is so large.
---
But please, stop this argument, there is no point. You have an opinion and so do I, so you can keep to that and I will mine. Thanks.

---
Might as well try IMO.
---
Yeye 
---
Woah
---
Please qoute the part where i said "im better than 4 man squads" all im saying is that 80% of the time its frustating to play with them.
---
They dont have to conform me. But when you didnt talk to me the whole game then dont do it when i lose a round for us. (Noticed how i said "when I lose a round for us")
---
Maybe i can find a 4 man squad but its much harder for a solo to find 3 or 4 people that they like and wanna play with than for the 4 man squad to find that one guy that they like.
---
Youre honestly getting too emotional about this....
---
I want a fair game and for solos that lies in solo lobbies. Doesnt matter if im a diamond with 6000 points or a copper 4 with only 400.
---
yeah mine too

yeah I’ll see if they need updated.

There isn't, pistol slides travel around a full inch (depends on the specific pistol)

The slide actually
---
Before you straight up assume it is console, you need to remember not all PC players run KB&amp;M. Lol Controls change according to device used. 
---
It’s great on the MP5 and P90. But of course if you don’t like it, choose whatever makes you play the best. 
---
I don’t.

Rules kinda do.

---
I hit plat one controller and every second person was ping abusing Arab  / meta abusing keyboard and mouse so it was essentially unplayable so I bought an adapter to be able to semi compete against these players, I do think it be good if uni found a way to stop MnK adapters 
---
&gt;Why did the Ash have this amount of time? Crouch lean spam.  If the Ash had peaked normally, or even quick leaned, the server latency would not have been so large.
---
Are you insinuating that this is Ash's fault because Ash literally did what the game allowed her to do? Because you would be wrong if you thought that.
---
The game allows you to crouch, it allows you to lean, it allows you to strafe, and it allows you to do all three at once.
---
If the servers of the game cannot handle all of these things, then it's up to the **developers** to fix their servers or fix all the movement mechanics. You can't blame the player for playing the game the way it was intended.
---
And technically speaking, peeker's advantage happens even without leaning. I've played Siege since beta and I've been killed countless number of times by someone that simply strafed, no lean spam, and they didn't appear on my screen.
---
Is simply strafing and killing someone abuse now? No it isn't.
---
Just because you have an opinion doesn't mean it's right, and it doesn't mean that I can not tell you that it isn't.
---
Don't record your screen with a phone
---
Hey, at least it’s not Ash face all over again.

Use shadowplay? It's awful quality when you record a monitor with a phone
---
I agree that the in-game community is mostly crap, but Reddit? Here most people are more than nice, what made you think otherwise?
---
Yea true, but it's been a while. Still dreaming for her elite.
---
Hightens the skill cap. If this were not true then valks gun would suck ass, but she is great is you hit the head. So stop complaining and hit the head I guess( plz don’t take as mean ). 
---
Any feelings you wanna talk about 
---
honestly made my day
---
I can totally relate. 
---
At this point I'm already tilted when I see a ping abusing stack in the enemy team. It's made me age 10 years in a span of months.
---
It is actually impossible to remove  peekers advantage. It's never going to happen unless everyone is playing on LAN.
---
The last legendary thing I got a was a weapon skin for lesion shotgun. Yours is better 
---
Fair enough

"console diamond"

Dude this Fox is just stole my Girlfriend 
---
Yea I joined 5 months before they made attachments free. So I was purchasing all of the ops and attachments too
---
I can't open your reply to my comment, so I'll rephrase.

This game is fine other than the rampant crouch and lean spam, which is going to be fixed. You really just need to play the game more. Get used to people's playstyles, recognize trends, learn to counter them. Use peekers advantage. Learn the height of people's heads, standing, crouched, or prone. Begin to listen and recognize when to begin prefiring so you kill them when they round corners, use the element of surprise. Start to learn your playstyle, and play operators that suit you well and synergize with the other ops on your team. These mechanics in the game are for increasing skill cap. Considering the way you feel right now, I'm going to guess you're new (because 99% of people level 70 and above are fine with the mechanics). Just play the game more and you'll learn, cosciously or subconsciously, your brain will begin making connections. The mechanics really are fine other than crouch and lean spam.
---
This again is just a really really long way of saying get good. That's all I can say.
---
Lol, you die in 3 seconds if someone is repelling. That's the funniest way to get killed I've seen this week :d
---
Why is it sometimes I load into maps and it has the obnoxious gray film over everything and other times there is no film?
---
Probably because you are using ash
---
Because PL bans Blitz every round, you're right. /s
---
No, people ban Lion and Blitz because they're both obnoxious to play against. They may not even be overpowered but damn they're annoying.

Drm with iron sight and lazer for the ultimate hip fire
---
I've had the exact same thing, multiple times. Verify your game files, if that doesn't work, reinstall.
---
I love these

This is my opinion (and I'll embrace all the downvotes I get) - so longas the person is playing CASUAL, I do not see a problem with using a Xim. Main reason is - not all of my friends play PC, and I'd much rather use my mouse and keyboard than my controllers on PS4 or X1 unless I'm playing a racing game. In an ideal world, we should be able to choose what peripherals we want to use on console, and not have to use a third party adapter. I do not own Siege on console, however if I did, my opinion would likely be the same.
---
I don't know about you, but I get a lot of "A player that you reported recently has been banned" messages in CS:GO.
---
Siege's report button is just a "feel good" button.
---
At least the trigger discipline is pretty consistent.

Hello -R3LAX-, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/amvccy/my_game_keeps_crashing/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Never thought I’d say it... cav needs a nerf. Or it’s just a bug that’s existed for who knows how long. 
---
Ah yes ridiculously long matches for less rewards I'll pass
---
Dyke ela
---
So what does turtle mode mean because my first thought was that she will go prone and kill them.
---
Yeah, when I use to play BF4 and BF1 (which I put many hours in) I kept knifing people once instead of twice or thrice, and melee animations are a big reason why my K/D is lower than I'd like.
---
If they just implement this into ranked how would it be any less rewarding? 
---
Not really. But yeah maybe everyone is gonna peek this 
---
I don't wanna be that guy, but... she's cute. Really well done drawing
---
If you think that tongue clash looked more like girl over Alibi... then I dont know what to say.
---
Finka and Clash are the most manly looking female operators. And Clashes bald head doesnt help her looks.
---
F for her thumb lmao 
---
Show the killcam
---
is a doc, what u expected?
---
you can tk two people but you cant tk the same person twice
---
Imma be that guy and say no
---
If there are enemies in the line of sight you do not get penalized. Basically if your shooting in the direction of am enemy and you tk you wont catch that ban.
---
You serious or just being that guy
---
&gt;:(
---
Yep
---
To not use an entire mag to kill sum thicc French boi
---
This is not true I don’t think.
---
Lol I’m just being that guy.    Recruits with dlc weapons would be fun. But it would also be extremely op
---
Other than shotguns I like to run it with Buck's primarys and some machine pistols
