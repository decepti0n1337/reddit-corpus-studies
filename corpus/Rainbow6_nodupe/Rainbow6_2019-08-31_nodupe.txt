The season pass should be cheaper or the battlepass should be free becuase no new weapons

It‚Äôs not needed, 99% of the time you get shot in this game you‚Äôre melted instantly.

Yea. We've all tkd for no reason. But i stopped back in like op health. Like... This game isnt growing up bc of the players like that

The simplest change Ubi could implement would be longer duration for her gadget and I honestly wouldn‚Äôt complain at this point since she just feels like she really need something more going on.
---
Nothing but gadget buff: make it really long.
---
Slight gadget buff (another + 2 sec): give her a better gun.
---
No gadget buff: make her 3 Speed.

When I saw the last guy in the chair and Cav opened the door I got goosebumps. Everyone at work wants to know why I‚Äôm screaming YESSSS!
---
That's as we kids call in the business, boosted
---
Thanks for recommending dead subreddits
---
I see, that is indeed unlucky. Those unranked are wildcards, the system doesn‚Äôt know where to place hem so they end up backfilling in ranked games. Your best bet would be to play in a 5 stack. (Btw particularly odd this late in the season to have three unranked on one team)
---
Nice

I feel bad for the new players, just trying to enjoy the game and get hit with waves of toxicity

Asking for follows on Reddit. What a world

Yes, they may have thought that was a fully automatic scar

Damn man I was in the Top 5 on the GB ladder for Vegas 1 as well. I probably played against you! That game was the shit.

they have been shit on enough

why are you apologizing for playing casual on an alternative account

Make sure to let us know when you inevitably hit diamond bro

Why not?

How do you have 2 ops in your name.

Imagine only having one full elite squad, #brokeboyhours

Edit your user flair on the main page
---
Boy does it suck when you watch that killcam
---
Use the moot app if you want to find consistent teammates
---
I feel like they should categorize them(ex. ranked charms, animal charms, or just by which season they were released), so they dont get lost in the clusterfuck that is the Charm
---
I was excited for warden because of how he would be able to counter ops like Ying and glaz but i think in the end he was just a complete disappointment and not the anchor I thought we were gonna get
---
I only have one friend who still plays siege (the one in the photo) so getting a five stack would be hard unless I find people on discord, where in that case I don‚Äôt really like playing with people I don‚Äôt know since I don‚Äôt know what to expect of them. And I was also wondering just like you why tf they were still unranked. I don‚Äôt play often lately because I‚Äôve grown tired of the game but come on, even I‚Äôm ranked. My guess is that they just hit a high enough level to play.
---
No problem just use this

Can I have the lords head without the watermark for a lock screen

This was taken about a year ago, you can tell because of the scoreboard.
---
I know a guy who has 6k plus or something 800+ levels across 2 platforms.
---
I only had cheaters. One of them was XyNoonTM. He even have yt Channel with the same name üôÉ
---
I‚Äôve played siege almost daily and pretty exclusively since launch and I have about 1000.
---
And the diamond on the enemy team
---
What about a full elite squad with a diamond skin?(me)
---
This is what I was needing man thanks !
---
Maybe boosted,but maybe he decided to try his best and set goal to be better,or he got 4 friends and finally he doesnt play solo.
---
Dont judge others without evidence.
---
When u go on there, there‚Äôs an edit button in the top left corner so you can write something else and paste the images and all that
---
I saw so much posts about people leave ranked matches, but honestly im playing since around middle of black ice and that happened really so rarely to me, is it happening on lower ranks or something like that ?
---
Did you play in newcomer you bastard!
---
Me with outside cams
---
So true lol
---
why the frick you want teamkill bro that is so unc00l
---
Nice. Looks cool dude

That doesn't show the money, diamond skin shows renown

I played one newcomer match and got my ass kicked so I switched to casual and did the ass kicking

Haha smurfing is so funny.  /s

I can dm it to you i suppose
---
Oh cool your birthday is today? Mine is tomorrow. Happy birthday!
---
yeah they kindve fucked us over by only adding new operators and a map (and they can‚Äôt even make new guns or have too many maps at once)
---
Your wifi smells like toasts probably
---
What about your dpi?? Cuz ads is only about the time it takes to draw up your gun.
---
Then they could make it into something you can turn off or turn down. Don‚Äôt they do that already with the operator voices or am I confused with something else?
---
If she's the hottest in the district I better start packing and found a house elsewhere
---
I know that. It is still relevant because in casual you expect to be going up against people around your hidden elo. You can then check the elo someone has in ranked and see if they manipulated the hidden elo of casual since it should be separate. Kinda like diamonds dropping to copper 4 just for giggles but in casual mode.
---
Holographic sight
---
Ranked is part of the game, if someone can level up to level 30 during a free weekend then let them play. Hackers aren't prominent enough that you need to limit all other potential players over it.
---
I do this all the time but it‚Äôs good for people who don‚Äôt know üëç
---
It's in the baffin bay, the map was themed arpund canadian operators
---
you‚Äôre either joking or you‚Äôre a copper
---
Oh no. 
---
But is the cursed one.
---
People who can achieve level 30 in a free weekend aren‚Äôt new players. That‚Äôs my qualm with it, it‚Äôs always smurfs or hackers.
---
Jesus Christ it‚Äôs Jason Bourne

I don't do rank I'm a casual

Do NOT buy prebuilt. You can save a few hundred and have a better quality system for cheaper if you build it yourself.

It's not fun but you get ELO back when they get banned, and who ranks up a "smurf" account they will only be able to use for a weekend.

Are you stupid?

I hope Ubi gives you bunch of resources and models for you to play around with. Videos like this is pretty good at advertising game after all.

I know I am slightly shaming them but I was mad and it‚Äôs hard to not be. The title may have been excessive but I posted the photo show the matchmaking... you can see it can‚Äôt you? 
---
As for my stats, I told you I‚Äôm not a perfect player. However that was back then. I have reached gold multiple times (idk if on this account) and almost plat. No matter how you view these kinds of posts anybody can tell just by looking at this picture that the matchmaking is not fair. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I was being too harsh (and I apologize if I was) since I got the point across.
---
Duplicate Alpha Packs shouldnt be a thing at all

Aye man just don‚Äôt pay attention to that avarice cuck, he‚Äôs clearly a dickhead so we just gotta steer away from his bullshit

You are my favorite person on reddit, Everyone in this sub sucks ubi dick and defends them left and right. It makes me sick, they‚Äôve made over a billion dollar on this game and they don‚Äôt give two shits about console players. Ddos and MnK every game. Take a clip and send it to them and you don‚Äôt even get a response. They do nothing

Negro ice
---
Why does that matter
---
My team always tries to do this. They always sit in spawn as the last one alive untill time runs out.
---
the below is posted by another user regarding devs talking about Crossplay specifically
---
  
---
It is linked to auto-play at the correct timestamp, if its doesn't just look up 46:55.
---
From the video:
---
dev in video says he is not 100% sure on every detail. (WIP)
---
crossplay in its current state is 100% based on input.
---
kbm players can opt out of aim assist users.
---
controller users can opt out of kbm users.
---
they are looking into defeating XIM users.
---
there might be a feature to pick and choose which platforms to play against.
---
they want crossplay to be balanced and don't think pc controller users will be an issue.
---
they will gather info on crossplay during beta.
---
Cross-save, being looked into, not guaranteed.
---
Currently at 48:25 when asked about console users being able to opt out of playing against PC AT ALL they say "we don't know the answer to that question, because it would be pretty much the same experience. The only thing you might get would be some FOV difference there. I would have to check with Paul Hale and see, I'm pretty sure that could be an option we add if there is a problem for players. I think you can opt out by platform but I'm not sure about that."
---
I wish we could get the dev in charge of crossplay to come out and give us detailed info, I guess we will wait for the beta/launch.
---

As seldom as they are they really should have no dupes. If R6 worked like Overwatch where there was an Arcade system with weekly wins and one garuntred box after a level up? Yeah, duplicate away. 
---
But getting one item per pack at a random interval depending how much you win/lose? Nah, no dupes is the way to go.

Yeah but I don't want to get destroyed in every match in the beginning

Human motion animation is really tricky.  We see it in our everyday lives so much, that it's almost impossible to trick your brain to the point it believes what it's seeing is real.  Unless you have fantastically talented hand animators or Hollywood budget motion capture, it's pretty much always going to have that uncanny "just a bit off", or unnatural feeling to it.
---
I play on Ps4 and wanted to do some renown farming in casual, if you want I can show you the ropes along the way. I'm a high plat IGL who's been playing since release and new and my buddies are pretty chill so hmu if you're interested

Well is not that she looks like one, at first appearance you think she is aight, but when you read her bio, her appearance changes from an aight woman to a grown ass woman who still behaves like a kid because of her rejection of her childhood instead of moving on. She looks like a woman who has those weird hobbies, and likes to behave like a trailer trash woman.
---
*Me about to say mods can give it to you* *see‚Äôs flair*
---
The only problem I have with it is the animation doesn't tell right away if you reloaded the mag, I sometimes aim when I see the "end" of the animation but it didn't finished reload.
---
Same with the PDW9
---
nice
---
Then start with bots I like to go on house and find new kill angles and tricks i can use with like the 4 operators I have

They showed the 1st battle pass tracks, there were a few charms and the lore that they mentioned

Outbreak was fun but I find it kind of fucking ridiculous the first story/campaign content we got in a Rainbow Six game, the game about an elite anti-terrorist force, was about fighting fucking aliens
---
I‚Äôm about 99% sure using steroids at the special olympics isn‚Äôt allowed.
---
mw2 ninja defuse anyone?
---

---
Appropriate equipment for aiming on Console is a controller. If you use a mouse and keyboard, (like you seem to be suggesting) you‚Äôre cheating.
---
Good to know. Thanks dude I'll start paying extra attention to that
---
All I needed was the alpha pack to boot but I didn‚Äôt get it
---
There are ps4 r6 communities with 100k members, if you are a bit specific with what kind of people you looking for, you'll have pretty good chances
---
Mute. Always has been, always will be
---
Yo I got the same thing but for dark souls
---
What do you mean ?
---
&gt; It meant that the intention was that you should eventually be able to unlock everything given enough time.
---
you can still do that by getting duplicates. 
---
given enough time, you will get everything from alpha packs. the duplicates just make it take longer.
---
hmmm weird

I meant more in the snese that people in casual cant be this freaking uptight

This gives me some big PDTH and Mercy Hospital vibes. I love it.

How do you suppose it get fixed then?? You make a post about it as if you were asking for a solution. So??

Yea, the problem with Reqs came more from low ass drop rates on cosmetics. I never played Warzone, wish most of my Req drops weren't Warzone weapons and such.

Move that fast lol. She's a damn 2 speed
---
how did that even work?
---
If your talking bout thermite, what about jagar??
---
If I see it medically, Ela has a confusion on her personality, and seems to have a bipolar disordered. Also, her father's preference on Zofia, caused Ela to have some insecurities on herself. The way she dresses and acts, is a result of Ela's personality being suppressed and no way to expressing and show herself. Zofia being supportive to Ela, cause Ela to have more insecurities, because she may feel herself incompetent.
---
she's shit that's why she's underwhelming
---
For people who don‚Äôt have much stuff unlocked like me yes
---
stfu

i agree. I also think that thermite's new face should be a thing. He looks like he would rape something. Not someone..... Something

People play 100's of games trying to do trick-shots then edit the successful tries together to make the montage. If they do it with a pre-made team its fun cause everyone's on the same level but it bugs me when theres 1 guy/gal always recruit rushing or trying to trick shot in my ranked games trying to get clips for youtube

---
Duplicates shouldn't be a thing until you have all items in the game, just like in Overwatch
---
I love that one. I‚Äôve got it on 2 of my Xbox accounts and it was my first legendary on PC lol.
---
I contacted Ubi and they said it could result in a banned but the guy said he doesn't know for sure so and I'm waiting for battle eye to respond to me so I say don't use them unless you 100% that they're safe to use.
---
They should add safe to leave system if its only one person remain
---
Most likely just staged.. It's casual.
---
Binge Get Flanked, varsity gaming siege school, and rougue 9
---
Good stuff man. Basic edits would be way easier in premier and faster export too.

I was once new to PC gaming, my best recommendation is have the highest DPI (based off of your mouse) and have a lower In-Game sensitivity.
---
maybe he was joking maybe he wasn't

Oh yea, she's trash

Bruh casual is all one big meme, calm down.

Don‚Äôt play on console if possible , Ubisoft cares fuck all abt their console community
---
I‚Äôve gotten 4 actual legendaries (black&amp;yellow packs) and one was a duplicate :(
---
marley should go pro dont @ me
---
Mavericks nose is beautiful
---
My friend got a duplicate Glaz black ice which shouldn‚Äôt be a thing
---
Run all the situations, and be able to clap a lone wolf mission on normal before switching to all multiplayer. Your aim and map knowledge will develop.
---
It's awesome to hear your enthusiasm - after free weekend it gets even better without all the smurfs with free accounts.
---
For advanced tips, check out Rouge-9 and Coconut Brah.
---
Have fun and shoot straight!
---
Also, feel free to friend me... TheBigBo-Peep
---
Breach charges are actually wonderful for her to make flank holes and other stuff, heck I play her as a loud character even and throw stealth out the window besides hiding here and there or walking through a hall with a camera, but she‚Äôs pretty okish in my eyes besides the shit guns, the shot gun needs a buff I think and the FMG9 while I have had some kills, definitely doesn‚Äôt feel good on her since she has to push with it.
---
I play fuze a lot. His special works well on shit others place down. I don't get that many kills with it, maybe 1 out of 8 or 10
---
Mayhaps but it looks like the added it on after
---
Thanks man I‚Äôll check it out
---
Haha trust me I know
---
Thanks so much!
---
Thank you for responding my man! I‚Äôll look more into all of the operators.
---
With the new ops, it could be two 5x5 grids.
---
I don't see it,looks normal to me
---
Pack in any game should be a thing period. Did any of you guys saw the new NBA myteam trailer?
---
Im amazed at the amount of people saying "dont blame the game!" but then again this is the r6 subreddit.   
---
Perspective is absolutely fucked and needs to be looked at by the devs. This may be a poor example but there are plenty out there that show obvious issues.
---
That same one that's banned 98% of all ranked games, jackal. Guarantee you he would be banned in casual too, he's op AF plus he can see where you are exactly just from seeing your old foot prints. It's a bad skill.
---
Not really a helpful tip for how to learn playing on ps4 :\
---
Lads whole karma got wiped out from one comment
---
for real though, [here it is](https://youtu.be/-f24vXcWmbc)
---
what the hell man i‚Äôm gonna cry
---
Wow, this trailer just brought back old memories of the original ghost recon, splinter cell, and conflict: operation desert storm I and II. What I would give to have my ps2 back with all of my old games and memory cards
---
It's not a perfect square.
---
As per pro league rules, you are not allowed to use a mouse and keyboard when playing in a console tournament, therefore it‚Äôs cheating.
---
Also though, you must not know a whole lot about fighting games to think that a fightstick is a significant advantage over a gamepad. Both have pros and cons, but it comes down to preference. It‚Äôs easier to do dialout combos on a gamepad, but you have better stick control on a fightstick for a game like Street Fighting that incorporates more complex stock movement like half turns or triangles. Meanwhile using mouse and keyboard on console is only an advantage with no drawbacks, as it gives you more precise aim, with more keybindings so you don‚Äôt have things like accidentally knifing as you try to ADS and lean at the same time as happens often with a controller. 
---
But you‚Äôre just being a contrarian piece of shit so you‚Äôre going to completely ignore everything I said and focus heavily on a single point that you can argue instead of actually addressing the argument I presented, all so you can feel justified in your cheating.
---
oh no
---
Asian because off ping
---
The ability to use text chat on PC I feel like was always a big advantage for console users. Because if this happened on console you would just get destroyed and shown no mercy. Or at least in my experiences that has happened. I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever gone out of their way to message someone on Xbox or ps4 just because they would do a knife fight. And It takes a long time to type shit out on console.

Fascinating

Gordon Ramsay: IT'S FUCKING **RAW**

Wouldn‚Äôt that be the same thing
---
Sometimes you have to reset your game to open an alpha pack
---
When ever i play hibana i get the first 2, then ALWAYS fuck up the 3rd.
---
Oh lol üòÇ

I bet he got kicked by his team 2 seconds after that happened

Was this ranked?
---
Of course
---
Awesome thank you cant wait to watch more of your videos!
---
Yeah, Karma for running Doc with the shotgun.
---
technical test server
---
its not pro league.
---
I think how much mmr you have gain and lost in your games that you have played that day. I may be wrong but that‚Äôs what I assumed for a while.
---
yes sir
---
people who don't try as hard as you
---
No you can‚Äôt...
---
What is the pass is it in game 
---
Sry i live under a rock
---
That‚Äôs a rip from hacker
---
first round he teleported to the sky and slapped all of us
---
Ubisoft said the battle pass is going to come to siege in season 3 and season 4
---
Thx
---
Your welcome
---
Thanks!
---
no it made it more relatable
---
I think it is such a stupid move to play with enemies like this. Just kill them. So many games have been lost because of brain dead stuff like this lol
---
If Kapkan reinforces objective and immediately goes to place his traps at far away locations,you should have enough time to get at least 3 down.Then,you can rotate to objective,and place the last two right at the most common entry points.
---
If you are playing Maestro,you are likely playing close to objective,which is where your equipment will be going down.I don‚Äôt know why you would need a minute to set down 2 Evil Eye‚Äôs and barbed wire.If you have an idea of where you want them,it shouldn‚Äôt take too long to get them down.
---
The chances Mozzie gets a drone vs a higher level team are low.Assuming he does get one or two,it shouldn‚Äôt take long to get them where you want them to If,like Maestro,you know where you want them.They are small and mobile after all.
---
Overall,I feel like everyone asking for a longer prep phase is doing it for comfort.Sort of similar to comfort banning in Ranked.Echo isn‚Äôt OP,but he can be annoying and stronk in some cases,which leads to his high ban rate.Same goes with prep phase,but in reverse.You don‚Äôt NEED a longer prep phase,but it would make things easier for you.
---
This is probably one of the worst written pieces I‚Äôve made in my life.
---
Feel free to shit on my arguments.
---
if you leave lost games they don't count towards your w/l stat. it's just statpadding.
---
I would be the one that gets killed  
---
With that one difference that I've joined a long time ago and I'm still shit at this game
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm away on holiday for the weekend
---
Jeez that's awful. I'm expecting similar situations when the new ops will be released. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I can understand why you killed him. Personally, i don't tk for such reasons, i always tried to just deal with it, because losing a team member will just make everything worse. Y'know, assholes gotta be assholes /shrug. If they cross some boundaries i'm definitely stuffing them with bullets tho.
---
Oi
---
It's a *very* effective strategy
---
if you're solo, it's echo &gt; maestro &gt; mira. mira needs some strategy and teamwork to fully shine.
---
Xd
---
Hey, thanks for calling me out. I feel that if you hadn't that the karma that got me into r/memes worthy would've felt more like I deserve it. The reality is, I saw the other guy's POV and immediately found the Doc POV link in the comment section. Afterwards, I just put them side by side, without much editing or work involved.
---
So, thanks, it got me into r/memes (what I've wanted for a long time now) and while I'm grateful for the karma that this post got me, I do need to remember that it was 100% piggyback that got me up here. So I thank you for reminding me.
---
Yes. Its siege related is it not?
---
That looks ok
---
Not gonna lie was kinda hoping you would have posted the JoJo pic again
---
or you know....just a free weekend player
---
Thanks! I should definitely work on my headset tho, I can hear things but when I try to talk all my teammates hear is a long beep so I can‚Äôt really communicate with people in game
---
No coz this a witch hunr try something else and probably not here
---
Same thing happened to me, but the first guy killed me...
---
Yeah lol
---
I saw someone named "RegginYag" getting banned. Ain't gonna lie, the name's pretty funny.
---
I was just curious if i could get him banned i censored his name for a reason
---
They can, it just costs alot of money to buy the liscence, create the model, make all universal skins work on the model, and then balance it without making it a carbon copy of another gun.
---
What about Montagne montages
---
Sounds about right
---
Is it still free weekend ? Looking to try it on PS4
---
U can prolly if u get evidence but saying smtn in description cant be taken as valid proof tbh ppl can do that for fun
---
Could just surrender though.
---
I think continuously moving my righthand thumb left and right can keep my senses and aim more consistent
---
Same lol
---
I prefer mint
---
Sure! The more info, the better
---
I personally love the FMG9 and N√∏kk. But she's definitely not competitively viable with her current loadout.
---
Well either way it‚Äôs a casual
---
Why? From all the things he could've asked for, why anime?
---
I had a game that‚Äôs still one of my best ever even though we lost. We went up two rounds then lost two players. We still took it to 4-5. Maybe I should say ‚ÄúI took it to 4-5.‚Äù I went 16 and 5 while my team were on 4 and 2 kills respectively.
---
The confidence in not using your stim to heal up was the best part
---
Thanks
---
Idk he just said draw a 20 page anime starring a rainbow six siege operator and this is what I drew for my design lol.
---
 Yeah, that one and the IQ one were the worst imo
---
Hello DualSur, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cxtu4e/blitz_running_like_other_shield_operators_i/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Oh I do love free week
---
Oh I see, I wasnt aware there were different licenses.
---
No Russian
---
All I get is plats and smurfs..
---
Level 200+, 6 Black Ice, 9 Legendaries. My friends not even level 100, and he has about 14 Black Ice. It‚Äôs completely randomised.
---
Alright, so siege runs on the AnvilNext 2.0 engine and havoc is the physics engine anvil runs. 
---
I'd assume the fact that those arguments are the same in ue4 and siege is either a coincidence then or due to both engines having been written in the same language (no info on that though as anvil isn't a commercial engine)
---
Cha cha real smooth
---
It's so weird seeing Thatcher using a fookin lasersight on his guns
---
Hhhmm, I mean, I do love banning racists...
---
sex
---
I think the new version is wayyyy better, the fact that you can show ase youre mains and stuff is cool.
---
i ment J√§ger .-.
---
Is it still the weekend? üëÄ
---
That's fine, also good luck playing Siege!
---
happy  birthday ( and nice gift )
---
Actually I don't, I always scroll through gameplay videos
---
Okay dude
---
Replying so I can find out the answer to this as well! I immediately searched for it. &lt;3
---
Matrix shit right there
---
NO YOURE NOT ALLOWED
---
WHEN THEY PLAY AGAINST ME ITS LIKE IM PLAYING AGAINST FUCKING BOLO BUT WHEN YOU SEE THEM ITS LIKE THEY FORGET WHERE THEIR FUCKING KEYBOARD IS
---
Maestro lmg.Lesion machine pistol.Ela pistol
---
Umm, thanks for the exception
---
Get PC you fucking peasant.
---
Today I got my first legendary after months, it was "banana for scale" charm :(
---
Although my next ap gave me black ice, so siege and I are cool now.
---
No efficient way to change the data center for good. It requires you to go into settings each time after every match and constantly change it
---
Na i prefer white not black
---
You know "anime" kinda sounds like "animated" which it actually means. Your picture isn't animated.
---
Big brain time
---
Basicially my point.. just, more aggressive.
---
3H30M 2.41 K/D 59 Kills Total, 68.9% Win Rate, no clue how many EDD kills. Probably somewhere around 15
---
Get the pass just because you‚Äôll get so much more out of the pass which makes credits more valuable since everything in the game store is 10% cheaper
---
The matchmaking itself is the problem. It shouldn't even take 3 minutes when people on "weu" find games within 10 seconds at times. I feel there might be a need for Ubisoft to intervene
---
Oh shit sorry bro I though you arguing Xbox luh you b sorry
---
Okay, I'm sorry I am no Anime/Manga expert I ain't know shit I'm only doing this because my friend told me to you can't really expect me to know everything about this man especially by the fact that I don't watch Anime.
---
#onlyincasual
---
Ooh baby
---
Siege is not the worst community, there are far worse community‚Äôs out there, you might‚Äôve been kicked because you took too long to load in and people didn‚Äôt wanna wait
---
You will most likely see that in low elo (under silver/gold), it's less likely to happen in higher elos (gold+) i'm pretty sure because people are attached to their ranks
---
Rainbow ice
---
See the comment below
---
There‚Äôs just hackers and bots everywhere
---
I probably still am that guy, but to be fair, I have been playing since Op Burnout.
---
Ily2 I get it I get it
---
They cost 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 renown for each ct unit
---
i can almost feel it
---
Yep. Get it and try it out. Even though a lot of people are mocking the people who are trying it out on a free weekend, I‚Äôd recommend trying it. I got into the game through a free weekend.
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
God didnt create cargo pants because it would be too op and it would show the inferiority of purses
---
how did they not defuse lmao
---
That is what u get dude, im so glad
---
You now have to use 2 drum shots to heal
---
Yea
---
Yes, it is.
---
Oh I really look forward for the next season. Wish you good luck when that time comes as well. :)
---
Well done.
---
Someone did this to my friend yesterday,he told me then I came down and Doc was dead some seconds after
---
This is so sad
---
ash 100%
---
No, it is. But we are calling OP a noob (jokingly) for using extended barrel on his AR.
---
What's wrong with using 1x sights to roam? Most of the defenders are 1x sights except the 3 armours.
---
Well, it's Jackal's gun
---
So let's just allow people to hack for a entire weekend so the game becomes unplayable in ranked until monday.
---
Its called "Travel"
---
same for me, I just finished collecting all ops and ember rise comes out soon :(
---
YOU REALLY HAD TO ADD THE BACK SIDE PIC
---
I don‚Äôt think R6 is for you man, try Club Penguin that might be more your speed
---
The thing about the data centers won't chance shit. I have a ping of 9-12 and still don't get the head shots, but blood from the head. It's just the bugs, there were less before operation health
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
What do you want the credits for?
---
When are they going to fix this bullshit?
---
your suggestion would entirely stop cheating in ranked
---
Literally nobody is using it.. its basically always shotgun/smg/barbed wire and why wou√∂dnt you. Its the objectively better combo.
---
First few days were good. Everyone talked and had fun. Made about 5 friends on the first day. 
---
Now my casual ELO is pairing me with Plats that use mnk and try hard like it's ranked. No one talks anymore either. Haven't had one other person with a mic in two days.
---
Kinda sucks.
---
I've only met smurfers so far
---
##this joke aint funny
---
üòÇ
---
v
---
maybe one day we‚Äôll be able to go 2 hours without this exact image posted
---
still 8x6
---
Save that for the spinoff Ubisoft is working on. I play r6 for competitiveness and other games for co-op. Let‚Äôs keep it that way before we get another disaster like outbreak again.
---
I actually like the look of that. Would wear on most ops!
---
"Merry birthday"...
---
Flash hider, imo, is the jack of trades barrel - it's not usually the best choice, but it isn't the worst either. Usually helps but there's also usually a better option.
---
Why are people so toxic on free weekends?
---
Just keep playing and dont get disappointed !
---
But it all boils down to how it feels to you - if you prefer one over the other, use it! This of course takes lots of usage of each, so start playing.
---
Flash hider, muzzle brake, or compensator- depends on which gun and your play style.
---
Flash hider- better small burst control (I use it in mid-range SMGs that might need to play close quarters or range)
---
Muzzle brake- better single shot control (I use this on many ARs when I‚Äôm trying to get headshots within 2-3 buckets, especially big slow ones like Blackbeard‚Äôs or Buck‚Äôs)
---
Compensator- better full auto control (either on small SMGs that you plan on holding until the nah empties out, or on ARs you plan on using like suppressing fire)
---
Corsair K70
---
Extended Barrel provides the full damage over a longer distance range, basically "extends" the damage dropoff.
---
For spawnpeeking it can be useful if you're not able to get headshots that far, but yeah if you're not going to spawnpeek, it's useless.
---
No he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôd be a one speed op that has to place 6 gadgets,his 4 batteries and 2 barbed wires compare this to someone like rook or maestro who have 2 or 3 to place down
---
Lol i was away from keyboard so it picked randomly
---
Not the answer I was looking for but thanks
---
I think another reason they got rid of the acog is because his gun was one of the highest damage guns on defense at the time, and it still has pretty good damage right now.
---
Yeah, u've got a point, i agree.
---
Maybe changing her to a 3 speed 1 armor operator would fix things.
---
I mean if we take a look at his style, a 3 speed 1 armor would fit her better. 
---
But yeah, after all a weapon change would make more useable(?[idk, if thats the right world for it])
---
Like shooting fish in a barrel...
---
Yeah, it works in THunt tho if there was a reason you wanted to do it.
---
&gt; like compensator or even flash hider. 
---
Flash hide is better.
---
What graphics are you playing with Jesus you must be playing on a nintendo64
---
I forgot about reinforcements tbh
---
Haha, good monitor broke so I have to play on the shitty one with 938 megabytes of video memory
---
...but what happened afterwards? Did all 18 pellets  properly burst?
---
Jeez, her SMG is really powerful but I just need to figure out that damned pattern
---
I just love how he scoots down the street, all I can imagine is him saying ‚Äúaight imma head out‚Äù
---
Depends on the gun. For most people right now it's a personal preference. Some I prefer flash, others I prefer comp
---
What is the point of this post?
---
Oh yea.
---
Lololol hail lord chanka XD XD
---
If you can't control jagers recoil with an extended you need help.
---
Free to Play weekend looks as interesting as ever
---
First world problems lol
---
Thanks for having my back, friend.
---
That was bananas. A+ potato fight with the Blackbeard
---
Baby rage
---
Its acknowledged and being looked into this update
---
XD
---
[Update] there wont be a 1h or 10h loop because my computer died after 4h of rendering and i lost most of it :/
---
How is it round 4 whilst also having 4 points on the board
---
And... this is the most pathetic thing I've ever come across... let people play whatever they want on whatever they want.
---
cargo shorts are what happens when you genetically modify a human to have perfect traits enjoy your torn clothing and fannie packs
---
why do you have so many accounts
---
What the fuck? No.
---
It makes you wonder: are there any romantic relationships going on in the background of Rainbow that we don‚Äôt know about? And, are they allowed?
---
I appreciate your support. But even criticism is acceptable. Everyone has their own opinion. And I know even though it may hurt, he/she may be hurting alot more than me.
---
You might want to put lean on "toggle", so you don't have to keep pressing q or e all the time.
---
thats just wrong
---
It‚Äôs real sad boi hours here in Rainbow Six
---
Meant the we Bois first than smonk and captain cargo shorts.
---
Yea it should be S+
---
Yeeeea dude agreed.Unisofts dev team is shit but their animation team is great!
---
Noooo its a bad map u IDOT
---
Yacht is meh in my opinion but plane is usually fun
---
Lol they got greedy for the kill and it was the first round. They had 2 diamonds the rest plat, and I lost this game, as u can see, I‚Äôm the only one doing anything
---
They brought aids on the first round lmao fuck those guys
---
https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/free-weekend/index.aspx
---
Yep, multi-player is just simulations. So no matter what you are atm (def or atk) you are the good guys
---
I mean you could just be a friendly player and tell them why that's a bad spot to place it
---
This... Big brain move
---
PS4 gang
---
You guys haven't played Dead by Daylight, the game in which the killers get bullied by the victims.
---
Normal gives you all the base ops and deluxe gives you only the year 1 ops
---
Thank you, I was having thoughts about that, I don't see my self putting drones in certain places, too much hassle, so yeah, I'll be more prone to get Nomad.
---
Sorry I cant tell is the first part: Yep, multi-player is just simulations. Is sarcasm or not I‚Äôm dead in the head rn
---
Log out of uplay
---
I feel like that's consulate
---
Free weekend? No wonder I‚Äôm seeing people reinforce halfway through a round.
---
General Mozzobi! You are a bold one!
---
I heard the longer you cook frag grenades the more damage they do.
---
How do u do it?
---
It fucks your aim with sides button tho
---
or even a co-op campaign. To be honest it just needed a real Campaign to begin with.
---
They are toe sick, i dont know why some people feel the need to be rude.
---
No there are 2 operators who can though doc on defense has ability where he can pull out a stun pistol with regens 40 hp and it has 3 uses finka is the other op on attack she can do the same but 20 hp and it‚Äôs temporary
---
What is he holding tho?
---
Bruh you said free week but your the one playing jager so you put them there
---
Hello shwimple41! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
It certainly doesn't help the attitude of people that are trying to improve.
---
I would of been restarted the queue
---
I'd be down to play
---
If you don't have to much money, go deluxe, you'll get all the non operation operators, if you have more money, you decide which of the better versions you should get!
---
I can confirm, newcomer is full of noobs
---
Lol, just got done roaming and came back to the obj and was like, wait a minute
---
I think with the deluxe version. U get r6 coins so I would get the deluxe version
---
ngl looks pretty sweet
---
Wait... Is that even possible?
---
Honestly that's one of the many ways to improve in the game, its by playong against better players thsn you so it's not that bad of a thing bc it helps you to knos how to counter these ops
---
If anyone wants to play drop your gamer tag and rank
---
So does the evileye work on the outside or no?
---
The Moot app has a lot of xbox people willing to play
---
After the first 10 minutes i wanted to see how far it could go without putting me in a game
---
It's free WEEK dude üò≠
---
You seem ashamed but what do you expect in casual
---
Ur an Ash main u cant say anything lol
---
Let me gues it was cav which took cam instead of nades
---
Saw this in a match yesterday, fr tho, these people trippin
---
For me it was a few t hunts for aim and then a casual or two for reactions.
---
I got minus 33
---
It just a budget Clash
---

Not like this type of picture (camera on barricade) gets posted in every free week.

Hello Andrew5848, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cxxnk5/my_siege_glitched_and_gave_me_this_really/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Basically this:
---
Yes, you can get any Operator with in game currency that doesn't cost money (renown), there are 20 basics and a lot more from dlc's (still able to purchase with renown, but higher cost). I suggest you to get the basic 20 first.
---
Everything you see in the game that is not an elite skin, or Esport related is something you can buy with in game currency.
---
This is a game that works with the 1 shot headshot mechanics, if you are good at aiming, go for the head.

If you have more questions, feel free to ask em by responding to this comment.

Haha epic! Its like every free weekend one of these posts is made.

Got it, thanks!

Because they think it's funny to make fun of people who literally never played the game (also free karma for this type of post)
---
He has ascended to a higher plane
---
Do you play on console? And do the youtubers you watch play on PC? Because PC players play at a higher FOV the perception of speed and distance is skewed, the size of the crosshair is the same but because the FOV is wider it makes it appear smaller, if you get me?

Jajajaja funney meme.

Seriously its Y4 why are people still making fuze + hostage jokes

Depends on the gun. I'm on mobile right now, otherwise I'd link a guide that explains what each one is good for but off the top of my head I believe this is how it goes: compensator &gt; good for tightening wide spreads/horizontal recoil, flash comp &gt; for vertical + horizonatal recoil (but does so at an average rate), muzzle break &gt; extreme vertical (does little to compensate horizontal recoil)
---
If only it had one less bullet in the mag than max and it would have been perfecto
---
Ah ok, thanks for explaining
---
Not a bad start.
---
Id argue its pretty great on cav or maverick. Outside of that though, i never head reason to use it
---
Congrats, keep on enjoying the game :D
---
It doesn't make them useless at all. This is a good mechanic. It just requires a small amount of teamwork to play around-- which adds depth to the game as a whole. There are like 6 operators who can effectively counter this, lol.
---
Just buy it, there will not be a new siege games for many many years. Lots of people are online regardless of free weekends. Lots of fun!
---
Lol but why is it? Is it cause people from different ranks get mixed up here?
---
Sir this is a Wendy's
---
Ubi sadly can't do anything, not the help center at least, if you really want, you can wait to the next patch, or ask to talk with a superior of the assistance team.
---
Watching the twitch stream. Link your twitch account, watch it. Certain charms require a certain amount of watch time
---
That‚Äôs the shit that makes coppers go fucking mad
---
If you sold your ps4 and asked your parents for money or something you can buy an average pc wich runs r6 at 70 to 90fps
---
The thing he is getting at, is that in siege you very rarely will have opportunities at long range shots, You are giving up attachment slot that could be used for something much better and all you get is long-barrel which is useful maybe 15% of cases and even then not quite as you should be going for headshots anyway.
---
I love free weekends they were what helped me decide I wanted to get the game and the game always gets at least a little boost in sales after a free weekend there's always new players coming in and it helps keep the game alive.
---
 Rainbow 6 is my favorite multiplayer game and I want to live as long as possible especially on console
---
Yeah that makes sense. I shouldn‚Äôt say it didn‚Äôt help at all because obviously team play and mouse skills improve with time basically. Side note, 10k hours? Was this over the course of Source and GO? How do you not get bored I will never play another CS match after my time playing.

Thanks but, I have purchased them in the past and then it suddenly stopped working
---
Have you‚Äôve seen the reveal trailer? It was so different and looked amazing
---
the part where overwatch isn't much better value the part about buying the base game of siege the part about how easy it is to get ops basically everything after the first period
---
New law, new stuff, some region approved a low that banned the in game currency because it could be like Gamble.
---
Nice one lol
---
MOUSE AND KEYBOARD ?!?!
---
Recruit was OP in ranked so they had to take him away, you have been chosen to wield the forbidden power.
---
Plus in game where all you see is the head now is irritating.
---
And I thought I was the only one !
---
as if its impossible to make the icons scroll
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure just a few matches won‚Äôt change anything but if you get placed it‚Äôll slightly effect rank next season but nothing much
---
With the new season coming out there will no longer be enough room on the screen to display all of the operators on one screen so they are changing the layout.
---

but since it seems that you‚Äôre a regular on Reddit I‚Äôll answer one
---
Acog, Vertical grip, and Compensater when possible
---
It's a balance between fire rate, recoil and damage.. with fire rate being byfar the most important. 
---
Ela &amp; Mira's guns are balanced because they have either ridiculous recoil or crazy low damage to balance it out. Or both. The F2 is broken because it has the ridiculous fire rate, very little recoil AND almost 40 damage.

You would be surprised how often this works.
---
This actually worked last year in the halloween event.
---
When having an elite skin equipped,but playing an event which forcefully equips specific cosmetics,you can still get the elite mvp animation but with that event uniform and headgear.
---
Just the last times it didn't work because they made custom winning screens for the Showdown and April fools events.
---
There is a video with all elite skin animations of last years halloween event.
---
So Sledge and Rook are good beginner ops, as are Thermite, Thatcher, Doc and Mute. 
---
As for attachments. Experiment a little bit most would say Flash Hider/Compensator and Vertical Grip. 
---
Newcomer is good to learn the bomb game mode. But Casual is good too for learning. Terrorist Hunt is good to practice your aim and recoil control.
---
I'm a console player so I don't know about PC parts. 
---
With text chat/comms, don't get aggressive with people, don't take stuff to heart. This game is pretty punishing to beginners so be ready for that. Don't be racist, sexist, abusive etc. That should go without saying. Try make calls if you can, use your compass if your lost. 
---
Ranked is bomb only, for level 30 and above and is usually taken seriously by other players. So if you feel ready for a more competitive environment then jump in give it a shot. 
---
I watched VarsityGaming and his series titles "Siege School" the videos are geared towards beginners and helping you gain an understanding of certain aspects of the game. 
---
Beat advice I can give is just take your time and don't feel pressured. There is so many elements to this game, so many operators each with a unique ability that you need to think about. So just take your time, learn at your own rate and be prepared to take criticism and hatred from other players in the beginning. But persevere because when you get your first clutch, ace and carry. Its so rewarding
---

best thing to do is find someone/ some people to play with who are experienced (level 100+) and who are willing to help you be a better player

This game isn't about realism and hasn't been for years now. And besides that, it definitely isn't 90% luck? If you prepare for or plan around the Bandit, it's practically 0% luck.

Just so you know, as long as the you cut the whole way across, with one line above the other, the reinforcement in between will fall so you can drop just the bottom half if you want to crouch through, or the top half if you want vaultable cover.

It‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs just in previous games I‚Äôve had a bad experience with solo queue so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the same with this
---
You can get a lot of renown fast by watching the tutorials and playing the situations. That should give you enough for a few ops.
---
Nah because whilst it seems cool with some elites, imagine Doc in his old timey animation wearing his classic uniform, or bandit in military police uniform on his bike. Some just really wouldn't work
---
Finish all situations first thing and get 3 stars on all of them. That will give you 6k Renown for operators right off the bat.

Yes ranked. Or if you were wondering silver2.

Ahhh that's crazy. Any idea why?
---
I love all of them.
---
Everybody should spread awareness toknow hackers and their names. This includes pc and console. Also, the majority of people that use macros or MnK on console dont realize that is hacking because it technically is playing the game with an unfair advantage and not playing it how its suppose to be played, which is actually equally bad as hacking, as stated by ubisoft.

No. During the events of (I think) Rainbow Six Vegas 2 the team was disbanded. That gave rise to new terrorist organizations, like the White Masks in Siege. And Siege is the reforming of Team Rainbow with new operatives.

I mean, yeah. But i kinda want TDM straight up for just playing with the boys.

Im pretty sure you wud get in to people with a similar rank when ur playing cas and if u get ur rank up (which is still a problem because some people dont like playing ranked since it is full of pressure) that wudnt happen

It's absolutely absurd that they've said they're open to it a dozen times, but it's never happened. I'm not saying that it would be like five minutes of work, but realistically, it's not like it would need balancing or something. Just make a shitty range, and let us have infinite ammo on it. That's it

So this is the new thing now I guess?

Ahem... Guys... Hate to break it to you... [But rails can absolutely be applied to older AR handguards.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_QJ5lPaLXguA/Tao2HbwjdpI/AAAAAAAAH2A/CSPElK1vr1Q/s800/D7K_1866.JPG) This rings true even with 70's era M16 triangle handguards, which can also be affixed with pitcanny. ventillation holes on said grips are not just there specifically for ventilation, they are there for modularity to boot. Modern systems such as MOE make use of this as well.
---
Also, I hate to break this to you as well, but magwell hand-guards are not intended to mitigate the actions of the rifle the same way an angled foregrip is. A magwell grip would function to the user much more like a verticle grip, not an angled, in which the user is supposed to c-clamp the rail with thumb over bore for recoil mitigation as opposed to grip vertically and apply down and inwards pressure to mitigate recoil.

I'm cool with it, as many guns as they're are in the game, it's a little unnecessary continuedly adding new ones. For any given op there's already guns that'd fit them well and be balanced. I hope in the future they do go more of the Finka/Lion route, but I'm ok with them being a little lazy one season.

I just downloaded the game to test it out and have some fun, but then I get spawn peeked all the time by a smurf:(
---
It‚Äôs just a roll of the dice every time you queue into a match. The turds can‚Äôt be avoided, it‚Äôs been a problem with online multiplier that goes back at least as far as Halo (although you‚Äôd even have friends who were dinks just playing Goldeneye on split screen). I do find that ranked is *significantly* less toxic than casual, and that higher ranks (up to a point) are less toxic than lower ranks. 
---
As for the causal life, negative attitudes can snowball. Just try to be a good teammate, and not provoke the toxicity. And if your teammates still choose to be toxic, just leave. That is the blessing and curse of casual - you can just leave, any time. I played a handful of casual matches yesterday. Got deliberately TKd in a couple, and I quit out immediately. If that‚Äôs the game you want to play, fine, do it without me. I‚Äôll find a new match.

You're right but at least the range in which it would affect the enemy is dangerous enough so that it wouldn't be such a good idea to try to be toxic. I do agree with you though :/

He has to stand still to be able to see clearly through smokes, which leaves him open. A lot of people dont rely purely on smokescreens to planet. It takes more than not being flashed to kill a rushing blitz, and if you're good, you can kill him while you're flashed. Ying? Those flashes have always been inconsistent and subpar, ever since she came out. 
---
Combine that with a loadout that's *just okay* and he becomes a very situational operator that just isn't viable enough to be worth having on a team.

It‚Äôs literally the whole point of the skin. The guy who made this like the car so he made the skin. It associates to the artist, and that‚Äôs all that matters

to put it simple, no. Her scorpion is the worst gun in game on all platforms as it's the only primary to my knowledge to not have a recoil diamond. Not to mention it only does a max of 23 damage the 3rd lowest in game. Her pistol is a niche as it does the lowest damage of all handguns and has a 12 meter fall off range making the red dot kinda redundant. Her secondary gadgets are quite useless as she's a roamer but given not just one but two stationary gadgets she can't really use. Her mine is also very lackluster. Compared to every other roamer even some 2 speeds she's the worst defender in game by a longshot.

Oh they do. They have *soooooo* many. It will warn and warn and warn you.

True, I just don‚Äôt want to have another gadget needed into eternity
---
Nah black ice is pretty cool, I'm talking about black ive
---
What about odd job as a three speed one armor and a pee shooter
---
Youve probaly aready did this but you can change the ram it uses from 2 to the amount you have it personally boosted my fps with mods from 10 to 300
---

*Thomas was pissed because he had never seen such bullshit in his life*
---
Ok call of duty pap camos
---
Omg is this copper? They didn‚Äôt reinforce the hatch and had no idea where you were coming from LOL
---
I love xbone
---
You should be able to mute yourself or talk, but I think it would help because people usually hide away in discord or Xbox parties and avoid communication which is necessary in a game like R6.
---
Am I the only one who'll think about about the Key and Peele sketch whenever someone mentioned black ice
---
I can totally dig it
---
The top one should be called blood ice
---

Honestly, Ive done alot of these up to the point where I choose the throw the game by going thermite, planting the defuser on a hatch and blow up said hatch if there was a bomb in the trophy room

---
Lol we already have Amethyst and Emerald, which looks very similar to black ice, but the bottom one looks liiit like that Ash that somehow didn't die.
---
pulse and castle's ump is great, capitao's smg is nice, but i prefer his lmg

She‚Äôs dodging the bullets!

No, I‚Äôm coming from thousands of hours on ps4 and I‚Äôve recently switched to Xbox to play with my friends
---
Nearly all spawn kills are easily to counter, as you learn where they come from, if you come to expect them, it put the defender at more of a risk than you as a attacker. 
---
I hated spawn kills when I started playing, would rant and moan everytime I died from it, more experience I had in game the less I died from then, and killed them in return, the one thing that taught me how to spawn kill, was simply by learning to spawn kill, if you know what LOS are used for the spawn kills, and what places you can do run outs from, and also pre broken ground floor windows to open during prep to run back in 
---
There has been a few unfair spawn kills, unfair meaning the attacker has no time to react, have been removed or are as easy as learning now to spawn on that spawn point. 
---
Siege has a steep steep learning curve to start with, exspecially if you playing against players who are already experienced
---
The bulletproof camera is what really makes it
---
Attack: Radar- a hand held device he looks at and it will show a small dot on his device when someone moves but can not defend himself and the device has to cycle back before another ping. 
---
Defense: Ping- Ping has a small device that she can put on doors and windows that allows her to tell which direction enemies are coming from.

he panicked so hard
---
I would play pulse his gun is pretty similar but his gadget is much better
---
Yeah, but we don't know the price and content yet.
---
I got $20 that‚Äôs says you made a smurf account and went into newcomer or casual to shit on players trying it out for the free weekend. Seen these ‚Äúace‚Äù videos too often already this weekend
---
Idk but it seems youre too young to even play the game
---
Ubi: Introduces a system with the potential for more (**free** and paid) cosmetics that are obtainable simply by playing the game when players have been asking for a way to earn cosmetics by playing  
---
Community: Stop monetising the game and copying more popular games  
---
Also Ubi: Doesn't add a training area which will probably need to replace a map rework in order to have the manpower to create  
---
Community: Why don't they listen to us?
---
Would pings device be like Kapkan where it‚Äôs an automatic action or like valk where you could throw it near a door?
---
I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. This man is delusional, take him to the infirmary.
---
This will never happen and everybody knows that
---
Creppy
---
No, I‚Äôve recently got a spare Xbox from my friend that upgraded to a Xbox one x.

That's not the only season to not get a new map. There wasn't even special events in every season back then like there are now, literally the only thing a "full dedicated season" was then was a map(sometimes), 2 ops, and a mid season patch. Like I said, your only argument is it hurt you feelings. Get the fuck over yourself.
---
They are in the next season they said they were taking more actions against them
---
Thanks, it took a while so that means a lot

I hate when this happens and I am level 118

Near perfect recoil control, trigger finger and high af sensitivity. Sure thing
---
Haha :)
---
We shouldn't let it die, but holy shit people need to stop using it for like 3 months and have a limit to how many times the meme can happen a day, because it is a goodish meme when it came out.
---
There's 2 in the game and both are trash conpared to the other primary weapon(s) available to their respective operators.
---
I have thousands of hours on ps4 between Pluto-RS and Killswitch1000-d
