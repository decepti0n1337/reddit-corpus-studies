You can literally say the same thing about most shooters wtf.

---
---
I think the obvious answer is that any skin not available in Alpha packs (and therefore without a duplicate price) couldn't be sold.
---
The map rotations of both casual and ranked are weird this season. The unranked playlist is also questionable.. i would probably do it a bit different if i was Ubisoft but Yeah, i am not Ubisoft for That reason probably 😂
---
I play to get called a dumb black even though I'm asian.
---
Deserved
---
Agreed. There's no "wrong reason" to play a video game. If the guns make it fun for you, enjoy!
---
I understand it, but it feels like I've been rubbed with superiority grease.

Ela is next so yeah.
---
I had the same idea as you where i thought Echo might be next but yeah. It's ela
---
It's the literal definition of a shitshow
---
Yeah but you got to cater to the window licking pro players who are too dumb to figure out how a new gun works.
---

---
Won't anyone think of the esports
---
Calling r/expectedthanos
---
At least with Nokk she had Claymore early on but it got removed for bug reason or something. Ubi stated long ago that she'd get her claymore back.
---
No but since you’re kind of ignorant and maybe incompetent or you just won’t get that even they kind of reused gadgets nokk is completely different than cav or vigil
---
That’s also the biggest problem money wise. Other than that maybe some changes to the seasons pass, add the battle pass, maybe a seasonal skin of your choice.
---
Nice try Ubisoft.
---
I get voted to kick all the time because of my gamertag
---
*Nord VPN has entered the chat*
---
I originally thought it was more of a punk rock type but then I saw the animation and well wasn’t expecting that...
---
Indeed, I expected her to make use of the gun or something. Not raise her fist like she wanted to flip off the enemy then realise she's in a children's book
---
C7E was pretty damn broken on launch
---
Looks pretty good
---
thats aw wierd way of spelling "we are cheap and lazy"
---
Majority of the comments about it that I've seen so far are positive, so yea
---
I play so I can feel like a navy seal and act like I’m badass until I turn 18
---
These days man... everyone criticizes you for even having an opinion, sigh. Of course its bias, it's a freakin opinion.
---
Chalet will be the new Hereford in terms of popularity and balancing.

OOF

Nope just a regular player, take off the tin foil hat
---
Ah another thermite main with the elite skin, fellow man of quality.
---
They're just getting punk-ier with these skins

The mvp animation to be exact. I don't expect much of ingame animation

If you play A racing game for the cars, you're playing it for the wrong reason.
---
Please tell me without being an asshole the answer to my question
---
I'll gladly get paid to find out which little kids are swearing and being toxic.
---
They should replace Warden's MPX with Mozzie's Commando 9 because it would be a buff to Warden and also make sense because the Colt 9mm SMG is a gun used by a number of federal services.
---
is it me or 
---
the 1st plugs look like they are screaming or are sad
---
but pluggs 2 look happy
---
Looks like shit. Lol. But for real.... it does.
---
No shame in admitting people are better than you. Learn from them. You will get better and then you can complain about secondary gadgets
---
You got banned because you weren’t in the game when it was over. They can’t possibly know that you were booted offline by ddossers, so they have to treat it like you abandoned the match. Also I like how you call ubi flying fucks but when someone does it to you, you can’t handle it and have to downvote
---
I think it even applies to for honor. Imagine if the new character(the one with the hammer) came out and his play style is mostly the same, focus on out of Stam punishes etc. but instead of a hammer he just has raiders axe, uses the same animations and has the same executions. I donno but that’s pretty boring sounding to me. Ya he’s a new character but he feels the same. It’s even worse in rainbow because all you ever see is your gun! At least warden has different reload animations I guess.
---
I guess we have to wait to find out how much they want for the season pass if it’s like 5-10 bucks they could include them in the season pass but they would need to adjust the pricing on it by at least 20-40 bucks
---
So there are wrong or right reasons to play? Gun lovers, don't buy the game. Sorry Ubi, someone on Twitter says liking the game for the guns is bad, so I can't purachae your game. Sorry.
---
You are in a field with two buildings. You can only enter one. 
---
In one, there is a Twitch with no guns, with two drones ready to roll. In the other, there is a completely identical Twitch, except she has her weapons but no drone.
---
Which building do you enter?
---
The point was that Kanal is in Germany
---
you open packs and you get items, understand it or deinstall plz
---
In my opinion I just want them to add a recruit that can have attachments but no abilities and just give him all the weapons for each side and a bunch of other ones just so I can play around with cool guns, like I play echo mostly because he has probably one of the best defensive guns, and I just use my yokais as cameras for hallways haha, but I want to be able to run like 2 different CTU sided weapons like an ak12 and an m45 that would be pretty nice,
---
Depends the MnK player I guess but yeah Ddossing is stupid broken
---
Yea I'm not here for the guns, I'm here for the toxic team kills and the sweaty doc run outs.
---
I think he means “ if you paid for season pass for guns you are wrong “
---
I mean, he has no grounds to say that his way of playing is better than everyone else’s. Personally don’t care about no new guns but...
---
I’m low Plat and it’s tough to maintain now. I don’t have an Elite Controller either.
---
They had the developer power to add a battle pass but not new guns?
---
I’m pretty sure it’s hibana/echos
---
I love House, Plane and Yacht :(
---
Does he land right off the window or the momentum carries him further in the room so it won't trigger the frost mat?

Then what is the point of charms, skins, weapon customization, etc? Screw off with this "my way to play is the ***only*** correct way!"

Not if I rage quit fast enough!

I would definite pay an $5-$10 if they put in the battle pass. You already get 8 ops which is $40 if you were to pay for them.

Attacker has smg11 and Mira/Jackals shotgun

Defender has Echo/Hibanas pistol

I literally never said I didn’t care about cosmetic items

They've said they're never touching House. It's too much of a classic map and it would be too difficult to fix because a residential house can only be so big before it's something else.
---
Wasn’t this just posted by someone else right before you
---
He's not saying you're playing it the wrong way though. His argument is that if you're playing the game solely for the guns then you're playing for the wrong reason.
---
Personally, I don't mind the use of old guns. It's just that Ubi needs to make sure that they think about which guns they want to reuse.
---
If it's a 5 stack sure. But if it's a two stack, it's not fair for the other three members of the team. 
---
&gt;That's what people want.
---
Is it? Most people seem really happy with this change. 
---
&gt;And that's even less fair.
---
How is it less fair? It's more effort for them now.
---
Yeah Ghost Recon: Wildlands is basically Open World Gunporn: The Game. Seriously, the most ridiculous amount of real world weapons to find and customize, and that's even going into the dozens and dozens of guns introduced through DLC since it came out.
---
I guess that's the big appeal of a Tom Clancy game, whether it's Rainbow Six or even Splinter Cell: Blacklist, expect lots and lots of gun porn.
---
Yeah I mens there are charms, skins, parts...what is the Twitter person even talking about
---
This is real, no way they would model legit cars and get the licensing for that. I imagine it’s just a snap shot they were using for mock-up. Also this has been posted at least 70 times on this reddit today

It didn’t. Comes out on September 10th.

I've used her, like here and there and they're solid guns

I loved that season

I'm never gonna get further than this I can tell you that much

That’s my talk but it seems a lot of people expect ubi to give them everything for free since they bOuGhT tHe GaMe eArLiEr
---
I can see why. It’s boring as fuck now. Even more boring with fewer maps this season
---
I tested it earlier and it didn’t really feel all that different to me, I’ve heard otherwise though from other people so maybe it’s just me. I don’t use it that often
---
I realized they weren't actually ass like I thought they were when I got the last shotgun challenge done in 2 games. The acs12 is just bad though
---
If I could just load up all of my attack operators with Thermies 5.56xi I would be psyched.

I got kicked last night when it was a 1v3 with a minute 30 left and was told if I didnt enter in the next 5 seconds I would be kicked. Sat there for the 5 and then proceed to try to win. Vote kick starts, I get one kill and at the same time I get picked off they kicked me out immediately. Dont play games with ultimatums.

Or the fire rate of a shotgun with the damage of... Nevermind.
---
Honestly I played Warden mainly because I love the MPX, and because of Blitz. But ever since they nerfed Blitz, there’s no need.
---
Now we just need the octopus back on house
---
They're too busy with battlepasses to even consider this as an option.
---
But the laser gets people to chase me also hip fire is slightly better
---
Seems to me nobody gives a shit about your opinion unless your a pc diamond
---
I’m not the only one that got serious super smash/super Mario sunshine vibes right
---
Did that this summer ended up with a $4,000 Siege machine but at least i feels line a challenge again when playing
---
Wait what they show your most used ops now?
---
Do you notice all the cinder blocks in the smokey room with Nøkk and Warden? I think that’s where it is coming from
---
This is a copper idea sorry
---
they probably should change that balcony a bit to  make it fair for the attackers but the risk to staying outside in some areas is what I think makes the map interesting and challenging in a good way
---
You don't understand, New attacker can grapple to hatches from below and you can't place breach charges on them if they are above you so the shotgun is required.
---
Imagine getting to the bomb on border by the hatch in that tiny room in lockers since no one stays under it that would be completly broken and even more with ying entering by the window and flashing the entire site.

watch dogs vibs???
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I also made a point in another reply that the bulk of the heavy work is probably the modeling, texturing, animations, and all of that. The stats themselves, there's probably already a system and algorithm that will properly tweak behavior via a number input.
---
What i think os happening is that I've forgotten that they are making a new game, a spin off based on that one event. Theu probably have majority of their artists working on. 
---
That game i mean it makes sense... we started to see the recycled gun thing after that game was announced.

Definitely a hard choice, but I'd say TCSG12, can't argue with an ACOG on a 2 speed.

Oh I see. I’ve played the TTS but hadn’t noticed. I assumed she could like bust it with her gadget. That sucks.

It won't be a thing until it HAS to, basically. Successful companies operate on prioritising what is most likely to give return on investment. In this case, it's skins, charms, the pilot programme, game-breaking bugs, exploits, battle pass (that most of us dislike, sure), etc. etc. It's only when all those things are taken care of that QoL improvements are considered, e.g. it took 3 years for Ubi to change the controller response curve (lot good that did) because it would do jackshit to the bottom line.
---
So, when are we gonna see account transfer? When it's in Ubi's best interest to implement cross-platform, most likely driven by competition. The more games have cross-platform, the less excuses Ubi has, the more it becomes a priority, ergo the quicker it's implemented.
---
With the confirmed cross-platform on Modern Warfare, we'll have to see what IW/Activision say on account transfer. It'd be a very good marketing tool to say "The first triple-A multiplayer game with supported account transfer". Idk if that claim is true, btw, but food for thought.
---
He's basically like the ali a lite of rainbow 6
---
As a g2 fan I was very impressed by their performance, they definitely deserve their victory
---
I like it although I personally prefer the more historical elites such as Docs or Miras new one. I think it would've been cooler to have one based around the Warsaw uprising or sumn but this is still pretty good.
---
Those are things you don’t need to play and you can just grind for ops
---
That’s why I haven’t switched to pc. Something like this would be great
---
Any example? Just curious
---
Very true it’s going to change the main thing done people are use to doing
---
Yes. I’m sorry but I can’t get behind these. I miss when everything looked tactical and military-esque
---
only one who really don't like it for a couple of reasons?
---
wow what an exceptional value
---
Supposed ubisoft hasn’t actually changed that at all to be fair since it has been their goal to reduce run outs. The balcony does need a small change to add cover but then also would that make it an easy hold for attackers? The balcony is a long straight walkway right now so killing people outside (presumably after plant) would become really hard.

Still waiting for my Clash cat... I can wait a bit longer.

Id rather recycled good weapons than trash new ones like the pre buff aug
---
Oh i thought you meant that there was finally a good elite skin because you thought the others were meh mb mb
---
Perfectly summed up
---
You can still like someone and their work even if you disagree you know. He's just stating his own opinion you can disagree and give your own reasons for playing siege. I agree with bikini to an extent, if I wanted to play a game for the guns I'd play something else. For me siege has always been about strategy, gadgets, and angles/positioning. I don't care about having a fair straight up gun fight, it doesn't really matter what gun I'm using as long as it shoots bullets I'll use it to win the round. Some guns you play very differently than others, but most full auto guns are basically exactly the same, you use them the same and they do the same thing. Some more effectively than others, but I don't care for getting a new smg with 35 damage and 700 rpm 30 round magazine, we have plenty of weapons like that.
---
Yes but was it 3 shields

People still do that on Reddit?
---
I mean, I kinda understand  
---
Because if you play Siege for the guns, and the guns only (Which I guess most people do), then there's no different between Siege, CSGO, CoD or BF anyway
---
Siege set itself apart from other FPS solely because of the Operator system

Without it, I might as well go back to play Vegas 2

On the other hand, the guy couldn't have choose a worse time to make that statement lol

Okay that's like Burger King but can you do real McDonald's please?

I don’t mind the chaotic parts like that. I think it changes the way you play a bit and I prefer the variation

The more i stay on this sub the more i love this game lol
---
These operators are going to have a low pick rate just watch i mean in how many scenarios are you going to use a shield that explodes or use a grapple hook

Well some items can’t be bought anymore black ice old season pass skin etc.

That’s amazing

Ok everything is good but why a battle pass?No one wants that.

Same vibe. Out of curiosity, what else do you use your PC for? A lot of the money I put into mine was on the 1080Ti (about $700 as it was right before the announcement of the of 20 series) and my 1440p 165hz monitor. I'd have struggled to get a PC to $4k if I were sticking to something that would realistically only be used for gaming and not rendering or anything else like that. Ever since getting into the gaming side, I could see myself taking up some other PC-related hobby now that I have a decently powerful machine so I'm always curious as to what other people have gotten into.
---
You said that one comment further down after he complained about you not answering his point. Nothing in your initial answer actually adresses his specific point. In addition, you have acted childishly in one comment and like an absolute dick in another comment later.

I mean I love siege for the airs ass angles, but I like my guns

At least I can now specify that I died to hackings. After all, that was CLEARLY BULLSHIT. I HIT HIM IN THE HEAD 5 TIMES

i dont have season pass and i dont want the new operators i didnt like them

I don't find her recoil hard to control. Especially on her LMG with holo, 150 rounds will allow you to ace w/o reloading.

The m762 is a great gun as well.

Oh well lol I love fortnite so i don’t mind😊

Pleasant
---
yo is it you bullyingcoppers?
---
Okay....but why?
---
Why would any attacker ever not destroy that shield before going in there? lol
---
Also, it's actually broken that he gets 3 of these shields!
---
How is it lazy. In the animation Ela has fluid movements that seem natural, and on top of that the paint effect on the screen is really well done. It’s definitely more complex then a lot of other animations
---
I disagree, the map is just as much of a shit show it was before
---
Why can’t the whole thing be free
---
What a puss move
---
that doesn't make any sense at all
---
No, I'm not jealous or anything...
---
How do u have this op i got season pass
---
Why did they remove so many maps from casual?! I get that some people dislike these maps, buts it’s friggen casual!?
---
I wonder if it was a glitch? If it was a glitch then I’m sorry but if it wasn’t a glitch then I think my point still stands
---
PC isn't that much more expensive considering that you need to pay for online but console is just overall a lot easier if you play casually since you don't have to setup much
---
most likely

I had no idea you could rappel to that balcony...
---
Interesting, why?
---
no

that means they bought it on the TTS
---
Why was organised crime/triad bureau the one to make that raid? Protesters might be organised, but its nothing like the pro-China triads that went around beating HK civilians. Not to mention how slow the police were to respond to said triads.
---
Seems weird that they could make this raid but spent 40 minutes idling while the civilians were beaten in public transit.
---
Kinda looks like lord farquad had a baby with lady Gaga.
---
because they need funding for SI20. something else got cut so this is why the battle pass was introduced.
---
My toaster oven could clip something better than this.

---
i didn’t like them
---
I second this
---
They can't stop us all
---
I might become an Ela main, This looks fucking awesome.
---
The pool table. I thought it was green
---
Oh yeah if I could hear it, it would be my fault, I more of put it on here because I couldn't and was curious if other people could.
---
Ah, another main.
---
Absolutely. Use a vertical grip, and don’t run an ACOG until you’re feeling groovy with the weapons. She’s crazy well equipped, a fantastic AR and one of the best LMGs in the game. 150 round box beast
---
Man do they look upset about it tho
---
these are dope honestly, especially Lesion's, Kap's, &amp; Frost's. starting to actually like this game again lol
---
There are already discounts on ops. The older they are, the cheaper they become. 25k as a starting price isn’t even that bad, my friend got a lot of the ops before they did the whole discount  thing within like a week or two
---
Rainbow 6 currently has some many weapons I just do not see reasons to be disappointed with the news, at least you have 6.000 hours at siege, there is no way to boring at it.
---
They're literally adding an unranked playlist for new players to get acclimated to ranked. There's no excuse
---
Thanks for the link man
---
Just saw it and gonna have to agree with u
---
The resurgence of these elite skins are just plain dissapointing
---
Yessssir!
---
I’d rather they reuse guns instead of limiting each weapon to one operator. I wanna use something like the skorpion on another operator.
---
No.... I don’t think I will.
---
It's harder for me with the worst wifi
---
Really hope it’s buck
---
Cheers maverick
---
When you realize gta doesn’t transfer all your stuff..
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
The guys bulges get bigger I don't know why I looked but Thatcher got a major boner
---
Same, only use LMG on her too.
---
I got kicked for not clutching a 1v5.  Whole team got demolished on a failed rush and I survived with a little damage.  Cue the ***Clutch or Kick*** in chat from my team.
---
I managed to get 2 kills and then died.  Got kicked.  It was the first round of the match too.
---
I pray to all that is holy
---
May the Indian be 3 speed
---
Just think of it as him getting a new better house
---
Yeah, I mainly play on xbox but I like to play pc now and then especially on the test server
---
Welcome to Siege
---
You can’t make an elite skin that pleases everyone. You make a tactical one, everyone complains it’s too serious. You make a street clothes one, everyone complains it’s too out of place in combat.
---
Just wait til you see Ela’s lol
---
But muh Cavi
---
As long as it comes with a long thwacking stick..
---
Good to know that what the rework is all about
---
How u get that op
---
The reason being because back in 'nam i think soldiers would mistake clamores as a can of food
---
Get off Ubis dick Bodhi
---
I really wish they would do this, but alas I don't believe they ever will. Doesn't seem very Ubi.
---
 she should say “Disney Channel”
---
The upvote and downvote buttons are supposed to be used on people who either add or detract from the conversation, not on people you agree or disagree with. Since the emojis added nothing, it was rightfully downvoted.
---
Well now I officially can play T-hunt classic on plane with my eyes shut, the regular terrorists have set spawns, though some might not be used in a round, but there can be up to free in small room under cockpit, up to two in meeting, one in left side of kitchen, two on right, three behind DP cover in bedroom hall, two in bedroom, Bombers where the only unpredictable part of T-Hunt
---
Her name is roughly translated to "Bang of Fine Arts"
---
 I know right
---
6’2”
---
There’s no shop
---
Damn she ugly
---
It’s basically maestros LMG with 30 less rounds and a quicker reload (^^)／~~~
---
There was no math involved so obviously it doesn't.
---
Mozzie pls
---
You fools, it’s obviously lucky charms!!
---
Your screen is super vibrant and bright, I noticed it too.
---
How is it at all relevant to this Ela skin?
---
You're not answering any questions.
---
Found the commie shill lmao
---
Why is acog getting removed from guns?
---
Thanks man! I don’t mean to draw attention away or anything but I thought some of the other stuff on here looked cool and wanted to try lol
---
I’m waitin’
---
I hope, I didn’t buy the elite for nothing
---
Farquaad
---
Who do you main
---
🤮
---
Although your points on my example are valid, Ela isn't the only one affected by them.
---
a) this also applies for most of the defenders, whose general loadout is composed by one full-auto long range weapon, generally a submachinegun, and a shotgun.
---
b) I deriberatedly chose Ela because her gadget's main purpose is setting up the enemies for a gunfight in favor of Ela by messing their vision, their hearing and their movement. But it is also an early warning system to alert the defenders and herself on incoming incursions. My point is her gadget is a perfect example on how gunplay matters for some operators as much as strategical use of gadgets are the most important factor on others, thus invalidating Emil's/BikiniBodhi's statement.
---
OwO is that Sparky? You know I did it to em. But an outbreak/story mode thing in general would be pretty epic
---
and here's a easter egg in a easter egg it the old voice line for the hostage but I was recycled and ended up in the crate
---
He is literally 0 days old so yeah your right
---
Yes
---
Bandit has a nice one but so does thermite and thatcher
---
Yeah, really just wish I could merge my accounts (eventhough they're both already connected to UPlay.) It would be nice!
---
Wtf this has nothing to do with siege
---
Oh man. I have a black ice for every gun on console.
---
She said her name was Candy Kane...?
---
The game eventually will need new weapons. It’s already getting more difficult to indentify enemies from gunfire with the new ops. On top of that, fine tuning operators will be more difficult if the necessary change is a weapon rebalance. You can’t have Warden’s MPX doing more damage than Valks, then they wouldnt be the same gun anyway and it was pointless not just giving Warden a new SMG.
---
Those persons ruin the game.
---
r/OkayButWhy
---
I must say, that I don't hate it as much as I thought I would. I love the ending if that animation as well.
---
Its just how its set up. The menu is loud while gameplay is just normal sounds
---
Well I did that before and then it got removed for whatever reason. This one didn’t so idk
---
Her animation is stiff and lacks follow-through, causing it to look lame and devoid of emotion or personality. Her paint effect is also extremely poorly done if you have done any art study into fluids and how they should react with a surface. There is no animation to the paint, just a decal being lazily applied in a straight line across the screen. No drippiness, no anything to give it any life and make it seem realistic. It's just lazy. Lazy lazy lazy. Any ammount of study or research could have made it look x10 better, but I guess it's just "good enough" for people to spend $15 so they don't care.
---
-angry art student noises-
---
Ela our here looking like 2009 Lady Gaga
---
Don't give a narc any feel to the fire, just ignore them and don't allow it to get to you. They have nothing better for themselves other then spreading negativity on to others.
---
Very balanced
---
Nah bro you can’t step in here like you been with there since the nerf....bandwagon smh (jk play ela I love her everyone should love her)
---
how the fuck are people leaving footprints in a clean area

Smoke and kapkan

Watch killcams, even as inaccurate as they may be they can teach you a lot of tricks. Try to do what people did to yourself. Learning by doing.
---
I’m gonna miss flinging them off of the scaffolding with air jabs on house...
---
Remind me if I'm wrong, but I think the Maestro might have been hacking
---
Goyo is so good
---
Every single game that has a pc and console counterpart I wonder why this doesnt exist. I wouldnt mind paying another $60 if my account continues on both platforms. Sometimes I want to play pc. Sometimes I want to play on my xbox. Why the fuck is this not a thing as standard yet
---
Hate to be that guy, but why are Lion/Finka and Maestro/Alibi vertical and everything else is horizontal? They look good! Just kinda OCD on that lol
---
Ditto, I will cream my jeans if it’s anything like Frost’s
---
They dont need frags. Dokeabbi is support not a fragger like clash and glass should normally always use smoke grenades that is my opinion
---
Who do you play
---
If there isn't anymore, there definitely was one in the past, and items carry over from previous TTSs.
---
Damn
---
What fucking map is that
---
As a clarification i do not play anyone a lot
---
Mexican isn’t a bad word lmao. I myself prefer to be called Mexican, not Hispanic.
---
no its not not even in the slightest
---
Someone give this man gold
---
I’m not sure what you’re saying. You need recoil control on every operator
---
Bruv she has that karen haircut
---
Yep they show it during the reveal video
---
Won't happen. It's almost impossible to make an ip address anonymous. Maybe using a VPN might help but that just adds extra hops and increases latency, albeit less than being ddosed.
---
ThEy ArEn'T TaTiCoOl ReEeEeE
---
You clearly don’t read much some  Elite skins are tied to the operators background/history 
---
Stop your bitching if you don’t like it don’t buy it 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
It is all related, they are looking at god damn demographics when pushing out these expensive af skins. Ubi is actually pretty smart by making such a skin, there is a market for it (sadly).
---
I think it looks rather ugly but honestly it's really got good flavour to it, so I could understand some people really digging it
---
I am actually upset about the loss of that octopus. Shooting it made every house match better. Just the explosion in size and happiness. Now it is lost.
---
Yea I just wonder what they are thinking she has great gadget great gun in my opinion and great utility with smoke now if u want u can bring a drag grenade
---
They would probably lose a shit ton because when this happens and my team is 5v1 we literally get 0 elo
---
Or get kicked because you didn’t win the match for your teammates who died in the first 30 seconds to a twitch drone
---
yeah look i have but its not good.I can use maverick but i cant use nomad i have control but its not good
---
In my experience it's exactly the same as it was, just like the SMG-12 and Ela's Scorpion (Which were rumored to had changes as well).
---
Hello I’ve a question, i downloaded r6s Deluxe Edition so i can buy some (ad-on)s right cuz sometimes a key appears on my currency pack and digital content.
---
Ok I agree mostly, but! New guns are a large part of what make the new seasons interesting and make me want to play them and recycling the same old guns season and season again just seems cheap and half assed.
---
I thought he just gave people fully activated weaponized AIDS.
---
Oh my bad kinda crazy
---
Plus frost mat can be easily be destroyed in that window XD
---
How do we know she is next after Mira ?
---
Cav's elite was also leaked.
---
Smoke’s elite is amazing imo.
---
He definitely has a lot of potential
---
What is voice abuse though?
---
I see
---
I'm gonna have to drop another 20 😥
---
Bosak Ela
---
let us seeee
---
DansomeWoja ur the goat
---
Mmm damn, can’t wait to never get it
---
Nikki got nerfed so she isn't invisible to the eye but zofia is pretty good rn
---
Negative attitude seems a bit ridiculous
---
It's all up to your playstyle
---
Oh ok then, do you like aggressive loud pushes or taking a slower sneakier approach
---
Nice usernames btw
---
Hell can't even pass GTA accounts anymore
---
I like Smoke’s elite :(
---
The point of the change is aim training in THunt, to run through the maps and warm up.
---
/\\
---
That one should just play a train horn at full blast.
---
I am super down for Kellogs to pick this up now please
---
Then why add them to a military situation game? Who tf shows up to a hostage scene wearing that?
---
Just saying, they took the shield away to stop people abusing the glitch while they fixed it
---
Military/tactical elites &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lore elites
---
Why the fuck wouldn't they give us the option to turn them on or off? I have relatives who pretty much exclusively play T Hunt, just to chill as a squad on weekends. It's not just for warming up, they should at the very least give us options.
---
It barely happens but I get to play my main attacker when it does and it is nice
---
Can someone give me a video link please
---
I dunno, ask Ela
---
Universally loved?
---
Yeah it has problems like that sometimes
---
Fanservice = Money 
---
can't blame em. They could charge $100+ for a skin where she has a tiny bit of midriff showing and people would buy it.
---
They're really bad for aim practice though, especially if practicing one-taps with high recoil weapons.
---
That's badass
---
Oh it sure is.
---
F
---
No it doesn't.
---
It just tells you if you are under the effect of an already detonated EMP - your reticle and attached laser disappearing. Basically like the Jackal track icon.
---
You know cosmetics are made by a different team right?
---
i think they forgot how to aim or were playing with their eyes closed
---
&gt;URSS
---
Union of Republics, Soviet and Socialist
---
This isn’t true what so ever, what’s fresh about being shot at? 
---
All guns do the samething, shoot bullets, whether or not it’s “fresh” is up to the person using the gun.
---
It’s ridiculous tbh, especially since the only thing you’re getting from a new gun is recoil and some damage numbers that are gonna be copy and pasted from ANOTHER gun.
---
New players come to casual and are overwhelmed with amount of maps they need to learn. It's in the patch notes.
---
Exactly, I was wondering when someone was going to post this shit. Good on you op
---
Could say that about Cav too.
---
Honestly, not gonna lie, her default would look way better on this.
---
This ^
---
Y’all know the guy who appeared on the stream with all the Thunder Sticks?
---
That was Geuce, aka the guy in the first two pics with the beard.
---
Is this console?
---
Aren’t you glaz she can draw?
---
Can we reuse not gay guns? Like not the Vector and not the fucking G8.
---
FUZE HAS THE BEST BLYYYYYYYAT
---
It’s would be like oddjob from golden eye
---
Smokes doesn't look emo.
---
Damn right, balance is necessary to a competitive online game
---
I have played many custom games with my pals.....never did find an option to increase base hp. Was it added in ember rise? Or is it that damage multiplier thingy?
---
Yeah, believe it or not there are some people who like bombers, nitro cells, and barb. It makes no sense to just change all of it without giving us options, when T Hunt is used in a variety of ways.
---
Go to asian servers it might have high ping but its way way way less toxic than where ever your server is.
---
Thx dude,hope you having fun with your elites
---
How do you get to 200 health, is it a setting?
---
I bought every single season pass on console, and that's not to mention all my elite and paid for skins. Ubisoft is greedy and would never allow you to transfer your skins just as they are.
---
Nokk is definitely a up close character, and that’s probably why they sides her with a shotgun, which btw is really good IMO and a sub.
---
Here come the downvotes
---
What’s the excuse for Finka not being to revive herself
---
I like chalet
---
1. Because a preplanned bombing might be considered as organised crime?
---
2. I don't get why you're trying to bury this coverage with more evil, is it really that hard to admit both sides are fucked up and no one is justified here?
---
I think it was Marley and beaulo
---
Makes sense.  Better for both sides in my opinion.  Person joining mid game doesn't have to deal with the 0-2 and can join a new game.  The people in the game don't have to wait 20 years.  In conclusion, the way joining mid game works is terrible and unrewarding.
---
Example:
---
“YOU ARE SUCH A NI**ER HOLY FUCK”
---
“Oh my god a grrrrrilllllllll omg omg you’re a grrrrilllll suck my dick”
---
fr? i play with a fuckton of diamonds on casual despite me being in gold, siege playerbase must be smaller then i thought
---
Totally True
---
Yeah, it was marelt or beaulo with they're eyes closed
---
Ah I see your a man of culture as well
---
To you. I support this movement
---
On the other team?
---
Her hair throws me off the most
---
Like a true Russian...Tachanka is there.
---
Never said I didn’t either :P
---
It is still a bad map that is not viable for ranked play
---
Throwback to when I got called the n word for winning a knife fight that won the game
---
"Ela, jeśli tego nie powstrzymasz, zabiję się"
---
Then nobody would use her because there would be no difference between using her and an ash. What's the point of using somebody with practically no gadget?
---
In siege, considering metas exist, gadget defines everything.
---
There's well over 90 unique weapons in the game. Be honest with yourself, adding a new SMG that's slightly different to another SMG isn't going to change the meta. We have more than enough weapons. Get over it.
---
I would quit lmao the toxicity is unfathemable
---
Isn't there a setting?
---
the game has multiple teams working on different things, it's not like the dudes who code and fix bugs are busy making smokes furry suit
---
not to mention you don't have to buy it.. at all, it's just cosmetics as far as I know and they've been doing that for every event now
---
No.
---
Thanks bruv. Just want people to stop going crazy over weapons of mass destruction in a frikking video game.
---
Why can’t it be about both the guns and the gadgets. The game also should’ve been fixed a long ass time ago this is a four year old game.
---
Fuze: IT’S FREE REAL ESTATE ^until ^I ^blow ^it ^up
---
I thought ela got leaked?
---
Yeah, it's brutal enough to try to kill someone that's aiming at your head, so why make it even more harmful? The increase in time could cost people matches, so in return to doing that Nerf they should buff hip fire, making there be s smaller radius
---
I hate you
---
Ballance
---
oui
---
This is my favourite Elite so far. Until Dokkaebi gets one at least.
---
Swear down, the only thing in Siege I will spend real money on if I have to. Unless it's like real disappointing trash that they just threw out.
---
Stop edging him.
---
Tbh I did not understand that room you mentioned because I don't remember any of kanal's callouts.
---
Going to have a long night then.
---
Indeed it is.
---
its funny that that's the rank from last season 
---
FAKE
---
It says unranked is ranked without ranks. Possibly it means that lvl restrictions are the same.
---
“Our arrows will block out the sun”
---
That’s what I’m saying. Add a different gun to the game that’s unique it shouldn’t be that hard for a major company like ubi to do that
---
What was changed?
---
I dunno why people are downvoting you. I was wondering the exact same thing too.
---
This doesn't promote new content. This doesn't expand the lore like scalpel and hammer. This isn't long or detailed enough to be a commercial for tv or youtube. I guess this can be used in promo material in tournaments.
---
Like don't get me wrong, I'm all for siege content. But I'm wondering why ubisoft would spend their promo budget to make this and what exactly their end goal is for this clip.
---
Most gold post I’ve seen lmao, chalet is a good map
---
what rock you do live under
---
Chalet is one of the best maps, how about they stop releasing mediocre/bad maps every operation and putting them directly into ranked and just start reworking maps like Yacht or Favela an focus more on technically diverse OPs? I don't know about you, but I think the new OP's are pretty wack compared to the first seasons.
---
I've ran into more good Cavs than Nokks
---
It doesn't really matter if there are new guns or not, I play siege cause its fun plus I already like the guns that are in the game like the FAMAS of twitch and R4C of ash, high rate of fire and good recoil pattern.
---
No it's an image used for reflections, you can find it in my posts
---
All of the event skins ever would like a word
---
Mira and Mira please
---
In an article(Idk which one, use search bar) it stated although ubi could afford new licenses for the weapons. There is only so many licenses they are allowed to have. Why? I’m not sure.
---
yeah either make him a 2 speed or slightly reduce the placement noise of the charge.
---
Ok I missed a announcement when did the ops get leaked
---
It could already make profit with the other ways the game is already monetized
---
True true
---
Hey you were right! Rejoice
---
yes obviously
---
Some harry potter shit
---
I play it for the pure anxiety it gives me
---
I still think that the cluster charge’s deployment sound should be a little bit quieter, so that it wouldn’t be that obvious for defenders and you wouldn’t be shot through window that much easier....
---
Maybe that’s just you, but every bomb site is very good on defense, and entering the building and clearing roamers on that map can be a pain in the ass with how close quarters it is
---
oh god, is this it. is this finally when i buy an elite.
---
Kaid. If you aren't used to anchoring it's decent practice, and his DMR is powerful. You're also bringing great utility to your team with his gadget.
---
"yes he was abusing his right to speak because i said so"
---
Fucking dumbass content creators just regurgitate whatever bullshit Ubi says
---
This game is based around guns. It's a fucking first person shooter- the guns are the main fucking draw of the game. 
---
The tactics, gadgets, other shit all take a back seat to the most common gameplay- gunplay
---
You deserve more up votes, this made me laugh.
---
That's most of the reason the original Rainbow Six book was written.
---
There’s a limit to how many firearms they can legally license in the game. Which is why we’re seeing recycled guns lately. Not sure what can be done about it but I wish there was new ones too to refresh it
---
nah ,shes getting the punked out zarya look
---
It counts as a rifle for the rifle challenges.
---
P.S: The operator screen in the main menu is major fucking shit
---
They have, it's just her next to a turret thing with a spanner in her hand lifting it doing the whole rallying the troops pose.
---
Wait so a communist and a fascist are equal to you?
---
Just use they
---
In other games like league/OW its for stuff like spamming surrender even when the game is still close, constantly whining, and just generally having a bad attitude. It's stuff that's not directly toxic towards any particular teammate, but is still bad for morale so to speak. You really wouldn't report someone for being tilted though, so it's not that common to report someone for it unless they completely throw the game because of it. IE: "game is already over I'm gunna spawn rush as recruit."
---
different monitors, different color settings, etc.
---
I'm still seething at the fact that Ubi thought Nokk would be OP with an AR and just dumped FMG on her and bunch of ppl ate up that answer despite several ppl immediately questioned Ubi for that decision regarding why they didn't just adjust the AR instead?
---
At least with Warden being slowly fixed (less penalty for moving and slightly longer usage), I have hope that Ubi will do something more. It really better be changing her to 3 Speed or something similar because otherwise there will be no reason to ever pick her.
---
Afther I scored an ace(let me say it again,a f*****g 1v5) someone started a vote to kick me
---
They really done did man
---
How the fuck is Bandits edgy teen wannabe? We get 2 "nonserious" elites and youre missing the like 8 other serious ones? My lord
---
UBI GET UR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT
---
Yeah true all I'm saying is that it could've been much much better. Mira elite isn't very bad but I personally think that it's a wasted potential in both cases
---
Why use that copypasta here?
---
Not a veteran of the high ranks, just high gold and occasionally plat III but I’ve seen this happen before in solo queue. Most important thing, open mic, say hello, and be confident when talking strats. You obviously have the game knowledge and if you’re in plat then you have a lot of the skill too, just focus on being a good teammate above all else and then they won’t care what your K/D is, especially if you win. What is your W/L ratio? To me, that’s what is always most important. I would rather have a 1.2-1.4 W/L and a 0.6-0.8 K/D than vice versa. 
---
Kills really aren’t everything, they are important, but if you Main an op that allows the entry fraggers to get their kills easier, then you will do great.
---
The community can be toxic. Just play until you’re confident enough to play ranked
---
Smh my head smh
---
So wack.... wish Ubisoft had brains.
---
Ubisoft said so during [last year's Paris Major](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/98jbvq/summary_of_developer_masterclass_from_paris_major/). We haven't heard anything since, as far as I can tell, but the general assumption is that Tachanka *will* get a rework (new ability, lore, etc.).
---
Welcome to Ubi's idea of writing.
---
FUcking hell yes finally I can use the 417 as I have always wanted to.
---
Ima try hard not to make a capitao joke here, but you may be right that I give ubi a bit too much cred in that last paragraph. What’s your position on the patch?
---
goyo is broken as fuck lmao, he's smoke but 10x better
---
IQ Elite was a trial run. After that they went "IQ Elite sold, go wild."
---
I just want ela in yoga pants and I’ll be happy.
---
The smoke elite is awesome imo, and the ela one seems to be “lore Based” as well
---
Imagine shilling for a COD game in the current year
---
If you weren’t using the barb wire for Jager then you were playing him wrong
---
Yea jump ship from a game with a cosmetic you dont want to a game where youre gonna need to buy weapons from loot crates....makes sense
---
I like it
---
I'd like more maps. I only just bought the game, but after playing all the tutorials I feel like I've already seen all the maps. A level editor or generator would be great, id' love to be on a new map every single time.
---
I only use his shield for when the Test Server is up. Barb wire is for life
---
Finally! Someone who shares my sentiments
---
Feeding issues. Early 20 round m16 mags would often be loaded with 18 because the spring was too weak to reliably feed 20.
---
Well Poland didn't exactly have a great time in WWII so this isn't surprising
---
Yeah man I just switched to PC and I LOVE it at 144hz.
---
Legit laughed outloud with my roommates lookin at me weird lol.
---
Thank god she finally is coming out with one holy shit
---
Imo bulletproof cam would be better
---
Well I’m tryna fuck lion
---
That is one really hot tech nerd
---
As much as I see people complain about this, that’s a terrible idea. The name of the game is being tactical and work methodically. There’s no risk in taking any shots if you can’t teamkill. That also brings up the controversy of being able to rush into a room as attackers while Fuze is cluster charging the room and not dying from his cluster charge. Same with Smoke canisters, Exothermic charges, Ash’s charges, Capitao’s fire bolts, Hibana’s X-Kairos, Zofia’s impacts and literally any other explosives such as impact nades, frag nades, and nitros.
---
Honestly sounds like you need to just frag more. Go to casual and frag a ton.
---
True,both bandit and smoke's elites are nicely done, I just think that ela had so much potential and could've easily had a badass elite. I'm fairly dissapointed honestly
---
Please elaborate kind sir/madam
---
Hk doesn't have reliability issues
---
They will soon
---
Pretty sure that was the Kriss Vector
---
I’ll take one please
---
That's sick
---
Lady Gaga
---
You'd still want to take mute. Stops people from finding out that impact hole at least. Plus the shield can be destroyed within 10 seconds of the start of the round anyway.
---
Saw the leak already. 
---
And fuck DBL. He can go rot in hell for all I care cause he popularized the Clash and IQ glitches. 
---
So fuck that lame ass twat.
---
So will you actually pay real money to get it?
---
Fuze and Jager
---
Maybe Hibana and Mira
---
Bohdi's an idiot and probably on Ubi's payroll.
---
I threw up a little in my mouth
---

---
I'm being stupid but I don't get it.
---
Explain plx.
---
Listen man, don't ever let your K/D define you as a player. If you're out here rocking a plat rank and maintaining it even while solo queuing, you're doing something right and it's probably by supporting your team with more than kills. That's the best advice I can give anyone and I've been peeing since S1, kills aren't everything. You can 1 v 5 the whole enemy team on a game of bomb, doesn't mean you won't lose the round. 
---
My advice is sticking with your group of friends and enjoy yourself. Soloing in Siege is a great way to get a headache because of all the trolls out there. And never forget the objective is more important than kills and that by focusing on the objective you'll probably throw the kill hungry people off their game. 
---
The rest of it comes in time and experience. Map knowledge, your aim, knowing where people generally come from and what they do, all time. So while that builds, just have a good time. It's still a game in the end.
---
Yea people have been asking for ways to go up hatches for 3 years now but an operator that can will have a low pick rate....ok then
---
I don’t understand why casual doesn’t just have all the maps. It’s fucking casual who cares about map rotations?
---
i lol'd when i saw the card but continued watching and was like "oh..."
---
goyo is going to be so fuckin broken. ROAMING VECTOR HERE WE GO
---
its like if we gave tachanka wheels
---
Is he like... invisible because i don't see him with you .\_. (not like i don't believe you)
---
Was disappointed when he didn’t just heil hitler tbh
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yLyS6EY8j_I
---
mmmmm
---
I love it.
---
I just have a feeling that he won't get one for a while, simply because they don't know what they could change his gadget to.
---
Unless this Noir idea of his made his Eyenox filter monochrome. That'd be pretty cool.
---
Dokka is cute :3
---
I like your user flair
---
BRUH UNPLAYABLE WTF UBI UNINSTALLED
---
Thanks lol
---
That isn't that tall, just sorta. Or is it? I am that tall. Am I really tall?
---
Its on the TTS. This is literally why the TTS exists. The Technical T E S T Server.
---
If there was that many operators on the game that would be amazing
---
I don't know why but that elite looks like garbage if it actually is to come to siege
---
Hello madhattedmalice, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Dear ubisoft we'll need one more thing if you can do it before launch, allow us to play both attackers and defenders in Thunt classic. 
---
thank you
---
It would be really nice if they tried to add someone to be compared with Ash and not just remove her ACOG like they are doing with Jager next season which is a really nice step of development on the side of ubi instead of taking the lazy disgusting route
---
Yeah that button will be as useful as the old “Report Toxic Behavior” button.
---
Yeah try like .001% only a few hundred out of the nearly 50million players will ever get this. It’s for a veryyy small percentage of the players.
---
Y’all ever f**k a b***h named Mark.
---
Honestly, just change him to a 2 speed and I’d feel like he’s in a much better spot
---
wtf is this xd
---
I mean European history in 20th century as a whole is kinda dicey
---
I wish stuff like this happened in my games lol
---
Idk i see it aswell
---
It’s supposed to be a buff
---
there isn't a negative reaction from the community just people on Reddit getting angry that they joined a trend that makes games better the longer you play it. The battle pass is literally one of the best ideas for Siege and I wish they put it in earlier
---
[Are you sure about that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/csl9ia/the_man_in_the_crate_is_not_lost/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
I think it used to be called TTS which is Technical Test Server but they reduced it now to just TS (Test Server)
---
Stop fucken reposting your shit idea
---
Good banter
---
You have a valuable idea especially gearing towards 100 unique operators. I would just like to see an operator(on the defender side) that can deploy drones that are like Twitch's on walls and when an enemy walks by they get shocked by lets say 15 health.
---
Agree. Nice to see some focus on this .
---
You should get vigil first, his guns are beautiful
---
It doesn’t look as nice
---
Hello eyrk11, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

I tried to found this pic in google but it says me “Nope”

It’s pretty self explanatory in the video
---
Ah yes of course, a brave and daring idea to create the first completely open map
---
AND THAN THE WINHED HUSSARS ARRIVED
---
And yet there’s still no Tachanka elite skin
---
They will never do this unfortunately. They like money.
---
COMING DOWN THEY TURNED THE TIDE
---
They’re probably adding cars to siege or a new event
---
So fucking stupid.
---
She looks better with her hat on lol. The animation is good tho
---
That guy in the blue glasses behind them tho

Pfft, the bosg my guy

Pretty sure it’s Bronze 4, Copper logo got turned completely red this season.

2. I'll be rusty.

3. Salty players that tk or kick for the smallest things.

I use to play with 4-5 people all the time.sadly fell out of touch with then all. So now if i want to play I basivally have to play with randoms and hope for the best. I did play a few months ago and we won, did alright. Wasnt as bad as I expected. But going from apex to r6 was odd with how "slow" everything felt lol.
---
Wait house? What the fuck. I was sad about plane but now I’m straight up depressed
---
Probably just a random placeholder from the devs build.

Basically the consensus i saw is it's a reflection piece that accidentally ended up being visible due to a glitch in the TTS, you can find it by looking through things like scopes or goggles apparently it's a background piece that makes the foreground pop

Iirc it's in the patch notes

Some of these are actually horrific, I love it.

its probably a zombie
---
before this screen, the game shows u the operators u most have hours played?
---
Why do all the new elites fucking suck? At least Mira's elite looks OK but this elite and smokes elite are making me think ubisoft are giving up
---
I have played this game since beta, and did not know this.
---
Did they just give up? That’s sad.
---
God damn (thumbs down)
---
With H A I R.
---
I was seeing this too and asked about it, apparently it's the background for the season pass. I don't know if that's true, but it's the best and only explanation I've seen.

They should have given her like an artist’s beret or something
---
He took your last reply as an insult, basically.

true but at least its a nice and clean skin and a cute lil charm tho
---
 negative additude - every player, that s doing something to prevent others from having fun. I think this report button rather os for reporting teammates than enemies.
---
Hallelujah
---
Ok
---
operation health*
---
i mean the entire point of the game is that these aren't literal counter-terrorism situations, it's the operators training against each other so yeah, of course they wouldn't show up to literal hostage rescues dressed casually
---
I loved it at the start and it actually inspired me to buy a gaming pc again where I could keep my skins... And now I refuse to buy siege on pc until the same is possible for it.
---
I’m not being sarcastic, I think they are perfect sizes, they sent to small like house, and they aren’t to big like villa (which I kinda like) or fortress, or the new Hereford base. There big enough to roam in, but not so big that you won’t see any enemies the whole round and there’s plenty of space between objectives keeping each location unique from others. Oregon is my favorite map in the entire game and I could go on and on about how perfect it is, but I think you get my point
---
I paid 200euros through 4 years (playing since closed beta) and got 1500hours in game, I think that's fine (it would be fine if someone's paying that amount every year lol)
---
but he was also nerfed if you use his shield so :P
---
I Will use that over the leggendary vigil headgead
---
A Ukrainian police station or a Aztec temple setting would be cool maybe every a lake house in Croatia or France with alpine ops there’s so many possibility’s and I like the idea of a setting in like New York in a apartment complex with scaffolding etc that’d be really cool maybe the maps completely vertical and the ops have to land on the roof and spawn in repelled or something
---
The best op for hostage
---
Welp, hope for plague doctor is actually dead now.
---
I love the animation of the Ela. I have Pulp fiction vibes from it.
---
2 head shots is mostly what is needed.
---
Hope first and second wave Halloween sets return. Also the event will have a larger selection of operators to select from as well.
---
rip
---
At the major, they had a community play room where we got to play some stuff early and Mira and smoke elite were there, also saw someone with Ela elite, how they have access to the client outside of the event though I have no idea
---
People will always find something to cry about like battlepass and ignore all the good changes they did with ranked.
---
They are saying you are getting personal.
---
I don't know if you're trolling or just don't play the game long enough to get what I am hinting at. But either way, danke! I is German, I know se number of se Polizei!

Yea but what do we get more in contrast? Now they can be even more lazy.

No. It's not a milsim.

I love this comment

Ohhhh, that must be why they're reworking Kanal

how do you play siege for guns? what does that mean?

If her gadget become much stronger or make her 3 Speed, it could work. But in her current state she's useless.

The only thing put behind pay walls are a few bundles and elite skins this is very rare game where you don't need to spend money everything else is free it's all optional 🙏
---
I don't think he really that underused. For most objectives you will find a creative way to use him - either use him to destroy gadgets (Theme Park: Daycare) or to flush the enemies out of the room (Bank: Archives). If you look around you will probably always find ways to annoy the enemy. Just get a bit creative.
---
But I do agree with the 2-speed. Maybe Ubi doesn't want him to get around the objective so quickly that you get his hockey pucks left and right with a very short time between the charges, but personally I wouldn't mind him being a bit faster.
---
there are also some people that play with their entire family crying in the background. I hate those guys. cmon, unplug your mic at least
---
Ela Elite is next
---
If you play an fps game for the guns you're playing the wrong game. 
---
How fucking stupid.
---
I think they should make it so that the free pass would grant access to boosters and packs and shit. This way people feel like they’re unlocking shit no matter what. The “premium” pass will include the cosmetics. This way if you don’t like the cosmetics you have no manipulated incentive to buy the pass unless you just want to. I also really hope they don’t put the charms in the premium pass unless they’re really good. Like if the Dokkaebi watch in the trailer is a charm, I’d love it if I could see it when she’s using her gadget or something quirky.
---
I don’t know if they’re going to do this because the primary incentive is still to make money. But I understand what you mean in many free passes are really lame. Even if there was just two worthwhile things in the free pass to encourage you to progress, then after you’ve already unlocked all the levels you can just buy the pass and get everything if you want, I’d be happy with that. L

Last time I truly cared about ranked was Op Health. You are an insperation to try again.
---
To put things in perspective, I started playing during Health and was high silver low gold then. Wonder what I can achieve now.
---
Looks like a real picture
---
Well, its reddit, its like 90% bitching about anything and everything
---
Bruh i was hoping for Montagne, he is like the only one from the GIGN without an elite skin
---
Oh right, I thought they were making changes to his guns
---
Mira’s is better honestly. Ela’s kind of looks like a Karen ( ngl that Karen is thick af though) Mira looks better and cuter without face paint.
---
Yeah but they showed it unlike the extended barrel to the Vector
---
That looks like an airsoft loadout i like it
---
Yes, Like as before at Operation Burnt Horizon, Capitao's Asphyxiating bolts are changed working same as Gridlock: Trax Stingers. And people said buff for him. Also this time they changed Capitao gadget completely with name working like as Goyo: Volcan Shield's fire effects.
---
Anyone got a 4k render of elas yet,

They die after 3 headshots just shoot them in the head not the torso and they are no problem.
---
Thank you, that makes sense
---
You do realise that cosmetics and bug fixing are completely different dev teams? You keep asking for new content and ALSO ask for bugs to be fixed but Ubisoft can’t fix all the bugs while providing us with 2 new ops every season and new features all the time. If you read the dev blog all of the bugs are being fixed and they have been acknowledged. Rainbow six also has 99 guns and you want more? Out of all the FPS games (except a couple) it has the most amount of guns. The map reworks have also been really good and compared to the recent new maps I’d rather them make the old unbalanced maps good and playable.
---
I am strongly against this idea, there are things i think they almost has to do, and things i hope they do.
---
if this "battle pass" is not with the Season Pass, I will be so mad, there are already so many cosmetics you can pay for in this game. 
---
i really hope they don't focus everything on it, i hope its just a addition to the game, where they dont change everything just because they added a battle pass.
---
CSGO did this with Danger Zone
---
i really hope siege doesn't become a microtransaction filled game, i like how it is now, dont ruin it please ubisoft
---
I agree with you, she isnt as useful as others make her to be. She needs a buff
---
And the entirety of your team inside the objective ;)
---
I hope they check on the videos, because now some little kidz could report the hell out of ya, tk you and then kick you out. Just saying, abuse of this system should be punished way harder than anything!
---

---
I have less internet points then you, therefore my opinion is invalid? Do i have that right?

I thought Fuze was good enough that didn't need any buffs.

Yeah but I think I was on a team of roamers. Castle slows then down I guess.

Weird question but how come all the leaks I see , come from Asian country ? Are these guys developers or hackers ? How do they get to the new content ?
---
Oh how many TH runs I lost because of these guys.

But still, TH will feel hollow without them. Kinda like when the kid you used to argue with all the time switches schools. You're glad you're gone, but still feel empty when they're gone....

I think people don’t seem to realize games as service actually need to fund themselves, especially if they want to try cool shit. I get that some monetization practices are really shit (e.g. limited time “premium” loot boxes), but this is one of those times I really disagree where Reddit is going with this. Like we never expected to get anything other than what we got from the Season Pass, but now suddenly everyone feels entitled to the new Pass.
---
Like I said, the Season Pass is underwhelming. But bringing that up NOW with the incentive of earning free shit instead of doing it before, just sounds awful, whether intentional or not.
---
I'm guessing dokk elite is next although i want vigil elite
---
I thought this was fake...
---
That’s too complex for the simple minded Ubisoft
---
Finally
---
All I think of when I see Kaid is Bill from Left 4 Dead.
---
First, they nerf Frost by taking away the shield. Then they nerf Frost by making it easier to destroy her matts. Now they nuff her by swapping barbed for shield? Why not just take the camera away so she can have both shield and barb like the good ol days?
---
Though honestly, I like the camera, and either way, having the shield back allows me to bring back some of my old angles.

Where’s the bikini skin?!?!
---
Bandit had a history with his look, certainly not edgy because he was undercover at that time. And before that, Hibana had the traditional look of a disciplined police trainee. So maybe this Ela skin has an operation attached to it.

Everyone hates them but tower and plane are my two favorite maps. Big sadface.
---
Because its a full priced game that already has a 40€  seasonpass + micro transactions

Imo goyo doesn't seem op at all and seems very situational and relies heavily on predicting where attackers are coming from. Not only that but people are going to catch onto his shields in no time at all. 
---
I'm excited for amaru and think that her gadget, while easily used for dumb rushes, also has the potential to be used in a really smart way
---
That’s where the operators pose, you can see this in the reflection of their glasses, headgear, etc. you can try looking at the reflection on jägers headgear

It is the same it just looks slighly different because it is zoomed in

Clutch or kick. They are simply challenging you to perform past your known limits!

Here they simply ran out of patience lul

And if you play frequently it's super easy to save up 50k renown at least before each season.
---
yeah im on EU aswell,ok ill add you once my game is downloaded
---
&gt;And he's saying the uber serious and bleak military aspects get old after awhile. 
---
Then play something for a bit that isn't serious. I'm tired of games giving up on tonal or artistic integrity and having wacky crap because of a few newcomers "bored" of a game choosing a tone and aesthetic then sticking to it because they cant just let a game be its own thing and expect to do everything other games do.
---
&gt;You can have a balance between the serious military aspects and the silly fun stuff and I think R6 does a decent job of doing that.
---
It does no such thing.
---
There isn't a balance because the moment you add the silly stuff it immediately detracts from those who hate that stuff.
---
And we are at a point where the silly stuff outnumbers the serious stuff.
---
A balance is having military tacticool aesthetics with the elites offering retro equivalents of that. Blackbeard, Jaeger, Mute, Thatcher and all the other historical skins are great because they dont utterly destroy the tone of the game because they remain militaristic on some level.
---
It's crap like jogging outfit IQ, baywatch Valk, this ela skin and london chav glaz etc that just look so out of place.
---
Ela is fun, but compared to all the others who you could play she's not very viable. For her I'd really recommend the Origin FO-12 as it does a much better job at being a weapon. Better damage up until 21 meters as well. Also giving Ela some utility as you can soft breach walls with it.
---
I think you are right with that Kafe. Im really curious about new Kanal.
---
Hibana and pulse were lovers. During the SI event you could get a heart charm with hibanas real name in japanese
---
:3
---
It just dosent have that kanal feel anymore its like hereford almost
---
It's a shame she doesn't fire the turret that would have made the bundle great
---
Winrates for niche picks changes extremaly, look Frost or Kapkan history
---
i really hope ubisoft somehow makes this happen
---
This game is turning into more and more of a joke with every season.
---
If they made lesion look a little better i would have been fine with his, also that wouldnt be retro for jackal would it?

Hello somesiegestuffiguess, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/csve4f/new_kanal_blueprints/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I love the skin
---
oh no I'm gonna waste money now
---
My Lion about to have new primary
---
I think that as you say the perfect way to make this pass great is to offer r6 as rewords and maybe even an elite skin at the max level (which of course wouldn’t happen...☹️). I’m as you, I bought the game in operation red crown, I have a shit ton of cosmetics and the announcer voice doesn’t really appeal to me. But I would buy this pass solely to support the creators and if I get rewards for that, that’s win win. It’s ok to not buy it, and I would even say that if you play this game once every couple of weeks don’t buy it. But I think it more intended for the newer player, it has some nice skins and the normal ones are pretty pricey for a new player. And it has story which I’m always a fan of...
---
Wait new lean system?
---
Can someone tell me if the seasonal skins will be removed from the shop once operation Ember Rise comes live?
---
Why? Didnt you like tuxedo guy with the great running skill? Or that gal with the bicycle helmet chain combo on her head?
---
Explain how pro league has ruined the game? Ubi needs to stop catering to the CASUAL audience and remove the awful maps like chalet from ranked. This is one of the best updates especially because they removed theme park, fortress and hereford.

How the fuck is any Ela main going to not get spotted with such flashy greens like that? And her hair is essentially now a way to line up your shot easier, with green being on both ends. This looks so fucking shit

At least give the LMG a try with the new angled. It's definitely on par with other attacker weapons, not spectacular but not terrible.

It is, but it's called La Casa De Papel here in Italy as well.

You're right but they come with limited line of sight. It's not a need acog or lose situation, there's plenty you can do to beat defenders in a position like that. It doesn't have to always be challenge with acog.
---
You play on PC mate, you've got no idea what it's like in plat on console these days.
---
Gross. So gross. I dont like this at all.
---
R u ok
---
So people could play and learn all maps? Just not the whole amount at once.
---
You Just need to active aim and its a laser again so its fun bc this time you need to have Skill
---
Or just add another site.
---
Ela, ww2 skins have become tiresome, they all seem lifeless
---
Best comment, wish I could gold you
---
Is it still horiztonal or vertical?
---
Id like a video if possible
---
Far from useless.
---
Still too situational, but far from useless. The movement change might be the fix we waited for, but I don't have TTS, so cannot say how it works now.
---
It looks so stupid, I love it lmao
---
I wasn't playing a lot lately so once I came back I decided to start with some casual before joining my friends in ranked. I was mostly alright except for occasional toxicity and unprovoked kicks. My last 3 games I was kicked twice though. One of those I was first in my team with 3 kills after 2 rounds (1:1). Then the next round I kill a dude spawn-peeking, dudes in my team die during the next 30 seconds, they patiently wait for me, I kill 3 more dudes only to die to the last one in the objective room. And only then they proceed to kick me.
---
Why? I would understand if they kicked me before (no need to wait). But what's the benefit of kicking a guy if the last round is about to start right away anyway? It just doesn't make sense...

Hello ConorMoeFoe,

Dont blame u.I have a hard time with smg11 recoil

Memory’s is possessive

If you would only spare 10 seconds of your day you could click on that link and find out that the sensitivity modifier has nothing to do with zoom.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable for the lack of Nokk buff. 
---
However, with Warden being buffed (and actually targeting one of the biggest flaw within the gadget), I have hope that Nokk will get one as well.
---
Bitch...
---
Vietnam flashback
---
Oh chillin then
---
1v1 me I’m poisongamer1738 ill be on in 30 mins
---
I hate people who use the phrase "its just casual". As if that would justify anything.
---
Theme Park wasn't in ranked the 1st season because they "learned from Tower" and the community was crying for it to be in ranked. Then they just started putting maps in ranked and removed them later if needed. 
---
I feel this is fine because people learn strategy in ranked and that's how you gauge the viability of maps. But I also think shit maps like the ones you mentioned should be removed after 1 season.
---
Meh....it was aight
---
Have you seen the president of Libya?
---
If the outfit wasnt so horrid, the headgear I could tolerate.
---
No gun is a truely a lazer but hey any recoil buffs that are fair are fine by me :D
---
It means we don’t need to wait 2+ minutes watching you hold the same angle, go do something.
---
But if you never saw this comment, how would it affect his content? He stated his opinion, not that what he thinks is holy text and fact. Like I said if you disagree with him, fine, but his videos are still the same regardless of what he thinks on this matter. I looked at his twitter and he's just going a bit crazy with all the people complaining after the reveal.
---
If jager is banned on your match you'll know what to expect
---
Hello one-armed-scissor,
---
That didnt adress my point.
---
Vertical = 0
---
Horizontal = active aiming
---
Jäger's or Thermite's are my favourites
---
nerd
---
So it didnt change
---
&gt;tiresome
---
I do not think so. But I can't imagine Ela in WW2 clothes.
---
That could work but what would it be
---
Cavira is closing in on at your location.
---
Chevron?
---
i think in bundles, but you can also just go to the operator and go to uniforms
---
It’s a game, it’s not serious. And we don’t even actually kick people and I’m getting downvoted. I get grinding and trying hard in ranked but Its a game meant to be played for fun.
---
Thats looks like a suppresor but elongated
---
A bit closer to heaven...
---
Tried that but didn’t have....
---
Good question! Ask UBI though, coz i don't rightfully know
---
you are a sad, strange little man.
---
~~F~~
---
Called the Money Workshop in Finnish
---
And you are ruining someones fun by kicking them.
---
Can someone explain the 'call me harry' reference? It just seems completely random, so I'm sure I've missed something
---
Yeah it’s not just one comment for me, I’ve been going back and forth with him for like a day. I’ve been nothing but respectful and merely saying that is my opinion and the opinion of others. But every response has got more and more derogatory. He’s so sure he’s right man. It genuinely pisses me off. I was just glad I wasn’t already subbed on YouTube.
---
What is echo looking at
---
lol check yourself it's true.
---
I do but pretty much only on coastline
---
Red dot on the mk17!?
---
That barrels gonna either snap or bend
---
2
---
On the TTS yes. On the live build no.
---
Terrible because i doubt you was tk'ing so much
---
Yea no. I just wish y'all could take some heat, instead of fucking crying Everytime someone hurts your fee fees.
---
How high are you?
---
lucky
---
I’ve just played since release on my PS4. I have all of the operators except the 2 new ones
---
Yeah, because I work for free
---
Elaborate
---
Stealthily
---
Yep best sight for it. Acog can get out of hand. Red dot is precise and is the best for upside down window peaking.
---
but you will need more than a patch to block the wall something stronger
---
Expect she is not a real person. She is constructed, I know a lot of art grads, and the dude is right, they would all despise her.
---
r/wholesomememes
---
At the very end of season 3. Just like Smoke's elite was leaked 3 months ago but was released last week
---
I never understood why skins arent tied to our Ubisoft club accounts
---
Every battlepass has a free version of it lol
---
Art school and rebellious attitude
---
So bs! Wheres my castle elite skin!!
---
I assumed they Will put skins in that new battle pass
---
Doood like tru story
---
Ela elite is for boys. Mira elite is for men.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Happy cake day
---
Harley Quinn?
---
If you see the part of the gray line that’s in the orange box it’s slightly out of place
---
If he was put in the game
---
All the season pass does is get you early access to the maps and ops and get you elite skins it's the same with Fortgay but people don't bitch about that!!🤷‍♂️
---
Meh, unfrickable. Not cool.
---
Ya
---
Hey I’m 16 too
---
I don't think most teams would be willing to devote the resources to ensuring she could get up through a hatch.  You'd be sending two ops down below to open a hatch, just to have her fly up through it and get killed immediately.
---
&gt; I know that there are different team that work on these but lets be honest I am not encouraged to spend money on a game that in 4 year didn't fix some of its core problem
---
Yeah as I said
---
Maestro, echo or Mira are all great for staying on site
---
say sike right now
---
He may not be the hero we need but the hero we deserve
---
they literally all died before him are you mentally inept
---
You would be a Clash main.
---
35k is more than i need atm
---
Elites don't add shit, what is it like 15$ for a couple skins, a animation and maybe a charm (I think), I'd rather save 5 bucks more and get a whole fucking game.
---
Only have six ops left to buy, I'm so close
---
And that's in America, right?
---
Rocky.... Reasonable.... Anything but smooth
---
BP should be free if you have the year pass...
---
once on coastline i was shooting a drone during prep phase and my bullets went through the floorboards and i headshot my teammate that was downstairs lmfao
---
If I somehow survive votekick I tk the guy who most probably is also the guy shit talking in chat and leave. I don't think I'll be any better than that toxic guy
---
A submarine is just a boat that goes underwater, on purpose
---
Reasonable clutch ever lol sounds good
---
I remember this game in year 1. Everyone was super nice and helpful, especially towards new players. A lot of steam reviews actually revolved around how nice the community was, which prompted me to get this game.
---
Now I dont even play anymore and have no desire to, primarily because of the shitty community. I'll only pick it up in a 5 stack with my friends, but even then, im not too thrilled about it.
---
r/mildlyinfuriating
---
So IQ is too good with frags but she's perfectly balanced with an Ash attached to her?
---
Isn’t echo bannes in ranked ? I want something that plays in simple and ranked 
---
Sorry for being picky
---
Personally on PC I’ve never had a problem with this
---
I like it because it still has the changes to q e spam that they added in phantom sight, while also feeling more snappy
---
u/iwannafucktwitch r/iwannafucktwitch
---
In the April's fool's event I clutched the 1v5 and then got kicks I was so furious but I was like hm yall like to lose huh
---
Great feedback
---
Lol still wont prevent people getting upset about the part that wont be lol
---
You can’t  stop worrying about grenades now
---
Or you rephrase it to "got a reasonable clutch today"
---
Replace an op with fuze to take care of jager ads and you've got yourself one hella of a combination
---
Will never type the key in this sentence for this man. He deserves no respects.
---
I wish you could spend renown on the season pass too..
---
Not gonna deny it lmao
---
Im already tr... trash.... Clash main.
---
HAHA DUUUUDE YOU JUST GOT R/WOSHED HAHAHA
---
Didn't have the copy pasta sorry
---
You know what, I like that.
---
I love that Cav's skin is the opposite of spooky because shes alreaady a spookster.
---
If we can’t save him, you can be damn sure we’ll avenge him *Avengers theme song plays*
---
These guys have to make a living it's better than them making a 2nd siege and making us buy another $60- $80 game (if you want a bunch of added shit) but no they continue to improve the game and add content so they keep the audience that they have and rope in new ones. This game could be worse it could be FTP and all the ops cost 3x what they are now cosmetic 5x what they are now but yall continue to bitch... 😔

Nice one. Thanks for working on them. They're very useful.

only when the enemy team is toxic

Should of took away her camera for the shield. The shield makes sense for her as you can put her Mats behind it
---
patience game
---
Yeah It might not be that bad with those changes, I forgot about that. We'll see how it works later.
---
I was playing against ddosers for my gold game and motherfuckers had a fucking plat 2 and gold 2 on there team and it want hard to deal with them THEY JUST FUCKING LAGGED THE SERVER it got so annoying and I just left cause I didn't want to deal with it

---
Yea he does get banned alot in plat and up ranked.
---
The ela one is very polarising 
---
People either love it or hate it
---
Then there is a 3rd group that loves it but won't buy it because of her current recoil
---
tachanka is a dead meme
---
Mic not required? I can see why you're struggling...
---
And after doing this you would realise why this is not a thing. I changed it and then reverted it immediately
---
When I played if I was LMS and a vote was initiated I’d just throw or leave first. Fine, you want to lose the round and have one less player? Here you go.
---
I think I've just discovered a new fetish.
---
That would be awesome if they added custom Jackal tracks to the game for the elite skins.

The ak12 for attacking not just because it is the best gun which it is at least by stats but also beacause of fuze and in defense it’s the mp5 for the gign ops
---
There's a special circle of hell reserved for people who do this.
---
AK12, C7E, F2
---
MP5, ALDA, MP7
---
We do this in Insurgency Sandstorm often. Lot of times the last man alive is a sniper that doesn't realize he's the last one. So we start a votekick to get their attention to get on objective.
---

This is all we've had to go on so far, but I think this is the same guy who reliably leaks more or less everything up to this point, so whilst it's not much - it's definitely probable.
---
"YOU CAN'T FIRE ME, I QUIT!" Then kill the hostage and alt f4
---
Just make it Rainbow eight, no need to over complicate things.
---
Will it even matter when it comes to consoles?
---
It was a complete cluster fuck 😂
---
Yes, I think it is a good compromise
---
WHY UBI DRAW HER FACE SO FAT JUST LIKE HIBANA, I AM DISAPPOINTED.
---
It's just THunt. But also got a 2070 Super ngl
---
Well it's always going to be wrong. Because I like this skin.
---
I don't know what to do with this image, cannot compute
---
Smoke with M590A1 on left, Echo with Supernova on right. Live up top, TTS down below. No difference in fire rate or reload speed between any of them.
---
Don't forget that menu animation was both depressing and loud as hell. 
---
Also Clash was constantly looks at you like "I know that you spawnkill last match ya litt'l piece of shait".
---
Some maps are defended favoured, some maps are attacker favoured, just look at the clusterfuck that is Favela.
---
Yes, but Amaru also has counters in Frost, Kapkan, any trap op really, as well as Castle. The only way to counter them is to use other ops assistance, or to go below/above and destroy the gadget, which is essentially exactly what you’d have to do as Hibana.
---
What have you done?
---
I think it was a case in which made IQ's gadget destroying aspect too good. 
---
As for Dokk, I am worried for that phone call + frag.
---
Turn off V-sync
---
You mean casual lol
---
Looks like IKEA
---
I recently started streaming on Ps4, and I can finally begin to capture some of the many instances of people being unbelievably toxic in game. This happens at LEAST once every time I play siege. So I look forward to when the report system can actually account for this type of racist toxicity.
---
Could easily be fixed by just not allowing last man standing to be vote kicked. Realistically what reason could there be to kick him manually? If hes team killing he'll be auto kicked.
---
Das ist nicht gut
---
I don’t want their toxicity in csgo either lmao, make them go play fortnite or something
---
Where is "Report tea bagging you stuck while stuck in a frost trap as defense counter defuses"?
---
This is gonna be fun.
---
Twitch F2/Mira Vector
---
I forgot about Castle. I guess trying to Castle that window and put ADS there is a decent counter. I might be overreacting but I already hate Chalet.
---
Youre right, dont know why I said 9 tbh. Touche
---
I don’t know, please help.
---
I think it’s good that they’re switching it up, as long as they don’t make another Jäger situation
---
JFK
---
It's console, people need to play lower sens to compensate the lack of precision the thumbsticks provide. It was a flick, but it just looked slow because he has slow sens, maybe?

I have a ps4 so im a 60 fps god
---
Because it's so cool man. She just finished painting class and now is about to go pLaY LaSeR tAg WiTh tEaM rAiNbOw.
---
I sure hope so, a large portion of the player base exists on consoles. I would hope that Ubi would see toxicity on PC and Console the same.
---
I’m not saying Amaru needs a nerf. I think Amaru sounds pretty balanced. I’m saying that map needs to get the fuck out of Ranked.
---
You know my teammate shout on me on voice chat becouse he Fall down from roof while i was shooting with someone and becouse of him i didnt hear cav... In next round he killed me after shouting "why you didnt help me!!!".... Just r6 community
---
Let me guess your a copper on Xbox beacause noise and keyboard isn’t really a thing on console it’s called having skill sorry to break it to you but if younthing everyone and their mother is using a mouse and keyboard on console then you just suck at the game

Amen
---
I respect your opinion, most people hate plane because of spawn peeking and most people hate tower because of its size and how long it takes to get inside, it’s also difficult to get inside.

What I heard around in some pro streams and read on Reddit, apparently Nokk might be getting the G36 from Ash, although I can not confirm this for you, I guess you would still be glad to hear.

I think they made some tweeks to the destruction again. There has been some inconsistency with wooden beam destruction so they changed it a bit.
---
So it's gone forever :(
---
because they will end up locking more and more content behind it if we don't shut it down now. "hey you want the seasonal skins? fuck you buy the battle pass". "oh you want the new uniform? fuck you buy the battle pass".
---
Man no one would survive a xbox live mw2 lobby.
---
Huh ok
---
This could make the Supernova the best pump in the game (excluding the M870 as no one uses that seriously except for recruits) especially with the new suppressor making sneaky Echo w shotgun an option

Yup. Sure. I hope so, otherwise, I reserve the right to message you "I told you so."
---
So can you quick lean like QQE/EEQ

But we know the new defender for operation ember rise already. He in no way give Jager competition gadget wise.
---
Yesterday I was in a 1v3.I was taking my time and then the Vote kick initiated started.3/4 wanted to kick me and one person didn't.I clutched that one for you my friend :)
---
This is funny. But also kys.
---
what?
---
Use your team, stack up and try to find the roamers so you can get full control of the cams.
---
Less challenging opponents in casual and not as much renown per win and team coms don't happen if you mute people
---
Yeah but that will just increase the time waiting to play.
---
If I remember correctly the old skins that were released prior to the ones from the crimson veil packs were available during the event. I don’t know if the crimson veil ones will be available to buy just outright.
---
True. But anyways, i just wanted to show you guys that this is working to. You could also use a Pulse Goyo combo (or valk combo) and watch if someone is underneath the hatch and activate it from above. Its cool that the fire drops down.
---
At least you don’t have to rely as heavily on callouts in a game like MW2 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I more mean that the Supernova used to be the slowest shotgun in the game, making it very difficult to use if you didn't get the kill with the first shot.
---
Vote to kick.
---
Also communication with your team is important, so i dont want to mute people if i dont have to. But thats been ruined by everyone going out of their way to act like 3 year olds.
---
&gt; The only info I was given for S4 is "Jager will have competition".
---
I guess if there’s both roamers in bedroom and garage it can waste enough time to save the round, especially if there’s some Maestro or something in there.
---
Chalet is so unbalanced in defenders favor
---
i think amaru should get the AR33 seeing that Peruvian special forces use it IRL, and it would be a much better option than the G8A1 imo.

HAHAHAHAHAH TACHANKA HHHAHAHAHA LMFAOOOO HHAAHHAHA HE SAID TACHANKA HAHHAHAHAAHAHAH IS IT STILL 2015 GUYS???? HAAHHAHA
---
Sounds like it'll end quick that way.
---
an extra 5 seconds picking the operator for your teammate won't matter if it won you the round.
---
So with the map rotations for casual does that mean we could possibly see Bartlett back in rotation
---
Looks better than in the game
---
They basically are
---
Thank you at least someone else is listening to the devs that they can’t add guns silly nilly no one understands it in this community
---
the supernova is terrible, probably the worst primary pump shotgun in the game, adding a suppressor just handicaps it more imo
---
This one is actually good!!
---
Smonks is good, glad we didnt get a plague doctor
---
I love it, means I can do 180s with an acog really easily
---
The only guns that have black ice are all base operators weapons and buck and frost weapons.
---
God: *judgement begins*
---
If you don't like it, dont buy it,   simple tings
---
Definitely. People need to learn that being tired, stressed-out, overwhelmed or whatever feelings are a thing and can have a huge impact on gameplay. And even if someone is "bad" and doesn't have too much kills - who cares? I mean, I don't know why lots of people feel the need to emphasize it constantly. I'm pretty sure that those who perform worse in whatever game have another area of life where they excel. And frankly, I believe toxic people don't really have other fields of excellence, hence the aggressivity ingame. I usually play at night, before getting to bed, so I miss callouts or make bad decisions... But even if I have the best kd in a match and the most points, I am still usually called "fcking trash".
---
also „Treffen der Küstenwache“ translates more into „Meet-up of coast guards“
---
Translation should be just „Sitzungszimmer“
---
I f you ask me, I think you should send a friend request.
---
obviously trying to climb up.
---
the charm you receive at the end of the season will always be the highest rank you achieved.
---
same counts with stats
---
Good day on Earth
---
Scandalous
---
It's alright we all make mistakes
---
+50 enemy stepped in it
---
(love the air force flag btw)
---
One of the previous event charms was pulses heart and on the back it had some connection to Hibana on it, this was the 2nd easter egg that they're connected.
---
So it’s para bellum leaning, right? They wouldnt return quick leaning. Don’t get me wrong, I really want quick leaning back. But it is para bellum leaning, right?
---
I know I just wanted to see if I could get into a game but I was watching YouTube so i was set for the long run
---
Why do they keep making these horrible elite skins? That looks ugly af, same as Smokes elite.
---
*heavy breathing*
---
Then why add them?
---
True but tbh the majority of the playerbase isn’t even playing ranked properly and who do are most likely silvers and golds. Their aim isn’t that good so for them it’s important to be able to fail a couple bullets
---
Yeah, noone will develop any strats in casual so even after a whole season, noone would know if the map is actually good or not.
---
No pasaran!
---
I was Five.DWC just for the record I wasnt being boost I got put with a random american 4 stack
---
Do you think I always pick frags? Of course I' m going to pick smokes as Glaz, It's my job as a Glaz main to cover defuser. However, frags can be of equal use in clearing out defenders, if another op brings smokes. If you, for example, are teaming up with Ying, you're better off having 2 frags and 2 smokes than 4 smokes a lot of the time. But it depends heavily on what site you are playing and how good the coordination on your team is.
---
next season ... rn on TTS
---
Why is it longer than the actual gun
---
That I can understand. And I don’t mean to be aggressive. I just don’t understand how someone could be on the other side of this argument.
---
I have thought about that before, but I don't think it really has a use
---
Looks great! Hibana would be nice, though you should do whoever you want.
---
They're technically different within the game code based on the feeding mechanism. But I'm glad Ubi gave both of them the same attachments
---
Well those frost and vigil headgears are gonna haunt my dreams for sure
---
You don't and that's the beauty of it

Cool they added a literally useless attachment to a gun that will never use it
---
good point lol
---
alright my bad, i’d be pissed abt m&amp;k users too
---
Cams taken out show the other team someone has been there while nokk can pass them while the defenders still feel safe and sound

It's Pulse, Hibana, and Thermite.  Pulse is the bald one, you can tell Thermite's on the right because that's how he looks in Chimera, and Hibana's in the middle (Ying has longer hair)
---
What about the dart boards on some of the maps?
---
Hello CasualOneTaps,
---
Because the post is about the sensitivity of the optics pictured above. When I said it had no relevance I meant that it doesn’t matter if they changed a screw on the acog from torque bit to Phillips.
---
I found your reddit heh
---
Use it on burst mode
---
he has the most pick rate from last month's mid season delta Chart
---
You have 0 idea what you’re talking about. Watch the get flanked video on it. It’s what happened with fortnite. They have M&amp;K enabled, but you are put into an m and k lobby. So, companies made an adapter that makes the console think they are using controller when they are not. It’s not ubi’s problem. Whenever they patch it, the companies will come up with a new exploit.
---
Then we could never play any game mode besides bomb on the ranked pool maps.  Hard pass.
---
Same mistake like in Outback.
---
Exactly. 
---
Don't rush into obj like a crack-whore running after a dude waving a five-dollar bill, get killed in the first 20 seconds, and then vote to kick me because I have a whole 2 minutes to play the round.
---
Even if I do somehow bring it from a 1v5 to a 1v2 or 1v1 and end up dying, I still get talked trash to or voted to kick.
---
Like, I'm sorry that all 4 of you guys were so incompetent that you died, and you then expected me to clean up your shit. If you couldn't win the round, then don't shit yourself all because I couldn't either.
---
yeah, and it wasn't even like the other team ran in aimlessly looking for the last kill. Just a nice job by OP.
---
It’s going to be free at first but after that there’s gonna be a free version and a paid version
---
I hate how people do this. It happens to me way too much.
---
Thx
---
How dare you not die in the first 45 seconds
---
Someone downvoted you because they don’t understand that from an American citizens legal point of view, a machine gun trumps any other moniker a weapon has.
---
Thanks! Those are my two favorite operators so I’m open to anything! I’ll definitely look into making her possible later today!
---
Sure feels like they did, that’s a huge spike in them popping up when they never did before. You could be right
---
why not
---
Can agree with both here. Amaru seems situational. Goyo will be heavy.
---
Dude, you have 0 idea what you are talking about. Console runs rampant with m and k. I’m not a console player and I know that. It’s a real issue, and it’s not Ubi’s problem. It’s the console company’s problem. Watch the get flanked video on it
---
Unpopular opinion: I think the battle pass will be great the game is fun and all but it can be a bit repetitive adding a battle pass will give you more to do on the game instead of just going into matches getting out and doing it over and over
---
It could be like a one use item when ur down. Like u have one chance to hit someone when ur down with it and down them
---
Can i retweet this and share this?  like i wanna rent a plane with this flag behind it
---
I think they its recoil more predictable
---
lmao it was an interesting game
---
I only got 1 for the past 5 months, and I haven't gotten any Black Ice for the past 3 years :(
---
Rainbow isnt even fun solo these days anyhow
---
Those are dope man :) you should try Ash or Bandit next
---
It doesn't annoy me, I just think your idea of fair play and "sportsmanship" in a game isn't someone else's. If Ubi decides to actually do something about it maybe ill agree with you, who knows they might do the gears of war native support or even the modern warfare device matchmaking. Until then seems to me that the creators of the game are happy with a mnk users money as much as a controller users.
---
There is going to be a free track on the second edition as well
---
Smile!
---
Probably just for you. I've gotten a consistent stream of legendaries since their release, one of my friends hasn't gotten a single one in like the last half year and another just got two in a single week
---
There’s still a free version, and I think this is gonna replace the season pass
---
Same sound but with an additional click at the start for the magazine release being pushed
---
Really look the clothes for Ela, but the hair is a massive-turn off imo.
---
The colouring is alright, just don't like the style. Seems too close to her original style, just a different colour.
---
Mira's hair-do is real cute, tho
---
EXTEND
---
Yes.
---
It’s supposed to look like one. The civilian legal version of the Kriss Vector comes in two styles: carbine length with a mock suppressor over the barrel and pistol length. Ubisoft put the mock suppressor over the ugly ass long carbine length barrel like it is in real life.
---
Maybe I mixed up the smg11 and 12, but either way I dont use any of em. I dont mind the c75 from what I used of it, but I also dont use it a ton so I cant REALLY say too much on it.
---
Plus, a fair few pistols are really good anyways. I dont mind not using machine pistols.
---
Hey there big boy 😏
---
Imo its bad
---
yissss
---
it's only my personal opinion
---
In all seriousness tho she we get on that with a pre-emptive rule or something?
---
They are 100% of the reason why i leave games early if that shit starts happening. its not even a good "joke" nor a good use of time if i just get booted for staying alive. Thats prolly why Ubi is implementing timeout/abondon penalties in ember rise for casual now. 
---
They literally cant do anything about these asshats misuse of the kicking system so they'll just give you a button to label them "bad boys" while you still have to suffer the rest of the match. All while not knowing if the other 3 or 4 of your team will just vote you out. 
---
Also, a weirdly open power for people to maliciously take away any experience/renown from players if they are small squads that just troll kick people in casual.
---
Thicc and quick
---
I’m wondering if her elite got lumped in with the halloween stuff maybe she had something different released in October? It had a yellow icon next to it
---
Read my post again. There shouldn’t be a patch to fix it. There should be a console ban to people current using it. This removes the issue players from the community. Future adapters would have less of a base to appeal to.
---
I get voted to kick when i join an ongoing match before i even get the chance to load in
---
This is why the only time I ever boot up R6 is with one or two of my friends. 1), I have a genuinely fun time and 2), this shit doesn't happen
---
Do ash with a tiny head
---
recruit
---
I was probably the most aggressive lol. Well cheaters exists and thats frustrating, but as I said, we need evidences before accusing. Controller doesn't always mean bad aim. hope my point is a bit more understood
---
Then don't play it
---
Fuze, Ying, Buck, Dokka, and Sledge
---
21 frags, 15 flashes.
---
You'd think one of them woulda droned.
---
But still there are adapters that trick the console into thinking you’re using a controller.
---
Was hoping for a cobra commander skin for nokk.
---
Thanks! When I’m home from work I’ll take all the suggestions and see which operator is the most popular! I’ll let you know if I end up picking Ash it Bandit!
---
Simply beautiful
---
Clutch or kick is meant to be done to friends, I hate that randoms just do it now.
---
Some of them sound pretty effeminate

In ranked too

🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳

The Lord knows that sometimes one must make the ultimate sacrifice for others to see and walk the righteous path of the Chank
---
ow mah gah
---
it looks like sia’s transgender cousin with down’s syndrome
---
No, its random, or you can choose them.
---
I think it looks good, the hair makes me sort of put off
---
you don't have to be salty, not everyone can get plat 3 \^\^

Was that client or server?
---
The new one
---
This doesn’t seem very practical
---
What’s your graphic settings
---
Its the tts...
---
Ranked has taken night mode out for the better it gives advantages. Second they’re rotating every 3 months the taken out maps in casual. All the people bitching about adding new weapons you need to cut out other things. Lastly they’re taking out 2 shit maps and 2 maps that I’ll admit am sad to see go. But as someone for a whole week only played favela, tower, Hereford and fortress I cannot fucking wait for them to be gone.
---
Nope I'm able to do it on mobile
---
Hello KobeRobi, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Grammar nazi spoted!
---
Ugh, no. Ela's elite fits her perfectly.
---
u/brodiebradley51 if you would be so kind to share your opinions here.
---
As for me, amaru looks fine but situational. Good for some sh*t sites in trash maps like chalet kitchen, and sites with many drop downs.
---
Goyo is epic.
---
You’re kidding
---
Am-uWu is fine. Her grappling hook is fun to use but I can't see a scenario where it would actually be useful since you can easily be punished while trying to use it.
---
G-0Y0 is a bit strong in my opinion. 3 explosive shields plus a nitro means that he has tons of utility which will make attacking harder next season.
---
You really are some kind of joke.
---
&gt;my in ability to aim
---
I can control recoil easily if you havent realized, i just rather not deal with horizontal recoil. As im sure many people dont either.
---
Second, my play style with her is perfectly fine. I can pick up a frag easily but have to rely on my grizmots way to often with her, so i would rather use someone where i can at least have sane recoil to get the frag - such as any other three speed.
---
So my conclusion is you are inherently daft.
---
Apparently it’s not liked that I posted this
---
Waldo, that you?!
---
Why not? Credits were free
---
I like the ela elite though
---
It's not about the choice of frags over claymore but frags over smokes. Theres an actual decision to be made now when playing these operators.
---
Lol my only answer for those fucking retard casual clans is ‘no balls you won’t pussy’ on mic when they initiate kick. If it doesn’t go through then I say Damn can’t even get a full squad fucking autists, 9 times I enjoy when they tk me cause then I can just say enjoy your L and join another match.
---
Ok, here we effing go.
---
Firstly, Rainbow 6 is not free to play, it barely has justification for the season pass and the extortionate weapon skins due to free maps.
---
Secondly, If the battlepass was a wholly free monthly challenge type thing for everyone (not seperated by paid tiers either) nobody would give two shits.
---
But every season will have a paid battlepass and a free one, which locks many players out of content if they dont pay.
---
And you can bet your dick that if it's successful Ubi will stop releasing seasonal skins and hide them behind the battlepass.
---
Thirdly, Ubisoft has started to lower the effort put into seasonal drop eg reworks instead of new maps, recycled weapons (neither of which are inherently bad things btw) so this is indicative of Ubi wanting lower the effort put into making money but getting more money. 
---
If Ubi want to justify a battlepass every season, the quality of content should be increasing not declining and yet here we are.
---
Depends on your rank.  Starting in the middle, you'll probably miss the MnK users (more common now than they were a year ago) and the DDoSers that plague high rank and the worst of the smurf problem in low rank (not new, but worse than it used to be).  In casual you'll probably run into more smurfs than you would have a year ago and the matchmaking feels more uneven than before.
---
For more positive news, ops are fairly well balanced right now.  The balance isn't perfect, but it's much better than it used to be.  You now get to pick your spawn point on attack in casual.  In ranked, they've added an op ban phase (1 attacker and 1 defender per team) and you play 3 rounds before switching sides.  Kafe got a rework and is much better.  There is now reverse friendly fire.
---
Well Cav needs to get a down and it takes time to interrogate, but she also doesn’t have a thermal vision which would show exactly where someone was in small cover. Also that’s the point of Glaz.
---
It's just one month dude. You won't lose anything by not playing those maps for 1 month.
---
It is to not overload new players with useless maps from the get go.
---
Is this an Xbox exclusive
---
Then ive been lied to, someone and i quote 
---
&gt;the recoil is amazing
---
Somewhere back in my previous reply section though
---
Lol “almost every operator has drag grenades”
---
Dude there are 24 operators, next season there will be 25, right now 3 ops have frags, next season 4 ops will have frags (I’m not including glaz, because him getting frags and actually stupid, he is just going to use smoke grenades)
---
But the scorn is bullets ripping you apart.

Don’t even get me started on the assholes who try to kick new players. It’s like they expect the new player to be a diamond god. They can’t learn the game or get better if they’re getting kicked all the time.
---
Tested. Can confirm it was a hoax. She hasn't lost anything.
---
So you're okay with pay to win. Got it.
---
Very disappointing.  I was looking forward to Ela's elite skin.  It's a hell no from me.
---
I may be able to help but I’m not on much and I don’t use my mic often.
---
until a team hate bans jager :D
---
What no it funny still xD he is lord xD /s
---
I wish there wasn’t so many toxic players in this game I love this game so much. I joined an ongoing match the other day and before I could even fully load in and see anything or anyone I heard “that’s a bad name and bad stats” then someone else called me the in word and I got kicked all before even getting a chance to play... it’s a shame too I probably would have carried haha but I just don’t get why being nice or working as a team is such a hard concept for people playing in the casual playlist. I’m glad they are adding a new matchmaking system that will be like ranked but doesn’t affect your mmr. It’s for people who want to get use to ban fade and stuff so more like “Rank Practice” Which I think will cut down on some toxicity. But one can only hope.
---
Epic
---
He took his enlargement pills...
---
It doesn't matter what they do to nerf them cuz most of my deaths as Monte are from stupid pixel perfect knifes that somehow hit my hand and not my shield. Others are good C4 throws and getting surrounded.
---
let me get this straight:
---
alpha packs
---
boosters
---
season pass
---
seasonal uniforms
---
seasonal gun skins and charms
---
Elite skins and credits only skins like the league ones
---
event packs that are usually 60$ if not more (last event was so garabage that some people stopped playing, not even a complete challenge) I wanted only the alibi skin and i had to pay like 70$ to fucking get it
---
pro league bundle every 3 months
---
and now A FUCKING BATTLE PASS
---
Fuck you ubi... its literally seeing something I love getting killed bit by bit
---
That would be u/killimaze
---
Stop flexing on me with your free shit
---
It is bait me and my friends never vote to kick the last guy seen so many people clutch the 5v1 so why do it?
---
The only negative of repeating guns IMO is that its harder to tell what operators the team has just from gunshots alone. Nook and smoke is fine because they're on different sides, but warden and valk and both of the new ops have same guns as the ops on their team.
---
If we keep going down this path I would be expecting summer swimsuit skins next year
---
Hello Prime_Nostalgia, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Have i ever told you the definition of insanity?
---
Yeah its annoying, can't play siege without running into an m+k player who thinks they are better than everyone else lmao it's just the kids with no skill pretty much.
---
good or bad?
---
Bro why that look like it’s 2 feet long ?
---
And it is still useless, but good to have the option thx Ubi.
---
Yeah haha everyone is getting more no matter what is a bad argument. All battle passes have free tracks, but in almost every game with one the free track is garbage compared to the paid one. This is equivalent to saying that paid alpha packs aren’t worth complaining about because they give you two for free.
---
Also, the issue is that they’re locking even more stuff behind a paywall. There’s already so much extra monetization in this game that more is just not needed. Season Pass, Paid Alpha Packs, and now the Battle Pass
---
Last night, I was voted and kicked before I had been loaded into the match.
---
Hip fire one is white and the sight's is red
---
What are you talking about
---
The teamkill because they are jealous of being so bad at the game
---
You just happen to say the 2 most used guns in Ghosts and claim that isnt where the idea came from. I'm not saying Ghosts was bad, I actually really liked it, but the mask and guns are like right from the game
---
We are Fuze
---
Fuck
---
Did you even read the post? I said that I don’t mind the map rotation but is instead complaining about the unnecessary night mode change.
---
Make it so it only applies if Cav herself is the one who downs them. 
---
Boom, simple.
---
Too  much. Before  the last nerf, Blitz'   winrate  was below  50% and Montagne  was   less than  a   percent  too  high  in  the   win delta. The  nerf was huge,  so  now  they  must  be much   lower than  that - this one is  overkill.
---
Honestly I think a fun mode would be 1.0 siege, just the base ops and maps as they were on release.
---
Yeah, people who can't handle being one tapped
---
Considering the USSR army killed more then the fascists...yeah...i guess
---
Gotchu homie, the mask hints at it too
---
Is this a console thing? Because I'm level 200+, with over 800 hours playtime, 600+ in casuals, and I never had anyone vote kick me for not clutching. I got voted out of a match once because I joined a match already in progress because four lonely dudes wanted to play with themselves, but that was about it.
---
No you fricking don’t billy
---
Lol, can't wait the 2:40 for the round to end. What a bunch of losers.
---
UBI YOU ARE CANCER
---
Not only that your other games you keep monitizing will continiue to fail you will drive siege into the garbage too. the quality is the game is so low right now and you keep pushing more and more monetization.
---
Hello CJW291, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ct169n/ps4_tournament/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
People   just  want  it  to  be a run  and  gun CS:GO, anything that  requires  a   different playstyle is a    big  no.
---
Yea I’ll probably take away the interrogation
---
Yeah I know (also completely unrelated but what do you do to get it to show your mains)
---
thank you for that
---
Yeah I hated the smoke elite at first but now I like it for the most part. If only ubi let me put the hood up to cover that awful hair then the skin would be perfect.
---
Lol, I did an ace once like that
---
With Bartlett Uni. and the other reworked maps
---
A theory I've accepted is that the death of the server browser caused the downfall of kindness.  In a server there are constant visitors, a mini community all together in a single game.  If someone is being a dick they will be remembered as "That dick" to the rest of the community and be shunned or possibly banned.  It's a place where eventually everyone knows everybody and they all meet up to play some matches together and have fun.  During this time also voice chat was a must, if you wanted to talk to friends you would need to do so over the public comms.  This means that private conversations could lead to public discussions and in turn create a bond between complete strangers.
---
  Then eventually p2p connections were made, people would go into matches practically anonymous considering that after the match they would be placed in an entirely different game where no one knows them or their dastardly intents. Then private group chats were popularized basically killing off voice chat.  Now you could talk with your friends who were in an entirely different game rather than chat with your teammates.
---
  Im not saying that all these advancements are bad, in fact I was excited to see them introduced to me in the past.  It's just that the gaming community we once knew of the past is gone due to these advancements.  Everyone is now antisocial and hold no guilt in their actions.  They can fuck around and do what they want with no reason to care.  There's no moderator that will sit them down and say "Fuck off", there's no internal community that will band together to say "Fuck off".  The only thing that matters between players is the scoreboard and whether or not they get the big L at the end of the match.
---
She's cool but I'm more a buck player than an Ela one.
---
I was playing yesterday with a team I found on an LFG (Xbox) and I was top of the team. They kicked me cause I left their party forb5 seconds to talk to someone. Didn't ask if I wanted to join back or even invite me back. Just a kick. People are dumb.
---
so a better pulse+cav on attack that would make glaz even worse than he already is?
---
Cat doooooooog caaat doooooooooooog
---
Sumthin sumthin cat dooog
---
They    should  let  us  choose   the   map  in casual.
---
I think because you tk people you lose more matches wich cause you to get matched up with people who also lose often
---
bcs I don't play ranked? I play this game fun and I don't want sweaties all the time with me, so since I don't give a fuck about rank losing, it's time wasting and I don't like that
---
plus that can happen in ranked too
---
Everytime Ubi posts another picture of some cosplayers and tells us how "great" this community is, I have to think about trash people like these and that they seem to make up the majority of the playerbase.
---
I mean,   Maestro  needs  the   shield  to    safely go into his  cameras.

If you go to the main page of this subreddit and click the three dots, there is an option to change user flair :)

5 ops have grenades on tts smart guy
---
r/R6OperatorCreator
---
It’s for sure really close but I’d say your just not aimed in fully yet by a really small margin
---
Who peeks a corner looking straight in the direction they move?
---
All about that CLUTCH OR KICK
---
Hey
---
It will force people not to main operators which is a good idea.
---
RIP
---
Lol oh look another mad online europoor
---
It would create newer strats. I'm sure there are many that Devs hope players would use and execute. 
---
It will make coordination key in the game. resulting in, hopefully into a mature game with more coms and less rage yelling kids and adults. 
---
Strats are always available it will just force you to change it  is all.
---
She does
---
No their general purpose was logging who died of plague.  That's it.
---
Plague Doctor smoke makes perfect sense because Plague doctors are the earliest example of a professional wearing a mask meant to keep toxic gas out.
---
Warden was also a reskin of two ops my guy, but worse.
---
I wouldn't say they're better, I would just say what they gave us isn't worth $15
---
Explain. How so?
---
i'm loving the uniforms... the headgears are cool for a Halloween look, but idk about in game
---
LOL F in the chat to all the people who want the plague doctor Smoke outfit, you didn't get it 🤣
---
Put a condom on that jeez
---
Pretty sure sbr would be used to describe the semi auto variant. With this being full auto, I’m pretty sure it’s an smg turned carbine
---
Yea smg 11 is a lot better and the smg 12 is more usable. Like what I felt playing tts yesterday.
---
u are gay
---
warden is ass
---
shutup you can’t get a point blank kill with a shotgun
---
I personally have never had that happen, maybe its something specific in the settings
---
#THAT IS SO UGLY
---
This is the community sometimes, I would label it as toxic bad luck I guess.
---
The only situation is to have every one on the team kill you, and at the last round you either get capitao or zofia, or an op with a nitro and you take everyone you can.
---
Awesome
---
Rouge 9 is pretty good too
---
B for effort A for execution D for luck
---
Random shittery, doesn’t happen all the time
---
let's just take pro league for an example, the support dies, should the fragger now play thermite? no pls never bring this up, or only make a new mode for this
---
"who says i am gay"
---
00 "you are gay"
---
Toxic af
---
🏆
---
Poor Man's Reddit Gold
---
I mean lion right now it’s pretty good pick, tho warden at the moment is super underwhelming as Jäger alternative but in the next operation there gonna buff warden a bit but ultimately it depends on your play style
---
Because you can’t peek a window whatsoever because you can’t see anything outside. You’ll just instantly die bc it’s pitch black.
---
It will cause others to focus on trying other ops. Not just maining one. 
---
Will cause better teamwork. Who can play this op, or this op? 
---
And players will tell you which.  Open up peoples ops options. 
---
Doesn't just have it where people can lock into ops over and over and others cannot play. If your good with that op, you wont die. And it will make it into a mini game as well. 
---
Your stats with that op will increase or decrease because you will be playing better and harder focusing on becoming top 100 with that op.
---
Idk lol
---
Are you joining the game in progress? Sometimes when you join in progress and take forever to load in they’ll kick you
---
Or your just getting unlucky
---
Kinda weird, but better then all these world war 2 garbage old timey skins.
---
I've played so incredibly many games, and the only community thats worse is League of Legends, judging by my personal opinion, but siege comes close. Never knew people could be toxic in a shooter before siege.
---
Preach brother! I haven't spent money on any season pass or anything and I have 80% of the ops and like 20% on PC I want more things to grind for the game is fun but there's no reward for time put in besides alpha packs and I hate the shit out of them.
---
Basically, it only affects what you can see, not what others can
---
and we cant hear the drone haha
---
I like that bouncy attitude of some of their gear
---
Yeh it happens at every rank, its just unfortunately the higher the ELO the higher the chance that not everyone your playing against is legit. 
---
Its a big issue, but naturally there will be the "Im Gold 2 and i have never seen this so it cant be an issue" when in fact it is a seriously big issue.
---
It’s sexy time

My friends want to move to PC, but I won't be joining them because I have purchased *everything* on xbox. If I can't transfer, I won't make the change.
---
Bruh lion, people saying warden are so stupid, warden is the worst DLC operator ever added to this game
---
umm. i dont play casual, but that just sounds ridiculous, how can a team fully give up on a teamate enough, to throw a round.
---
Ash
---
I'll take it =)
---
Lion
---
Whats your playstyle
---
its a console-only issue.
---
Bro it's casual for a reason. Go play ranked
---
yeah, people are happy she's getting nades w/o realizing she is one of the most annoying operators you can possible seal with
---
That's why solo Q is never a good idea
---
It's got the size of Tasmania right (compared to Australia), but it isn't in either the place where Tasmania nor New Zealand would be.
---
Tasmania would be a little more south-west, and New Zealand would be a bit more east.
---
Seems like Ubi fucked up the geography.
---
Yeah I love it when they lock more and more cool stuff behind real world money as long as they give me garbage for free :DDDD Praise Ubisoft for giving random charm number 78 for free while making you pay for good looking outfits that they could’ve also made free
---
Your argument is really pretty bad. 
---
The whole ‘if you don’t like it just ignore :DDD’ mindset is not a legitimate argument either.
---
The computers in CC3 look like computers from BO2’s campaign as well. With their futuristicish blue surfaces, without being full on holograms and stuff.

Oversaturated*
---
Also you opened a can of worms by mentioning fortnite
---
Fragger still has other options lol
---
You make it sound like theirs only 6 ops to choose from. 
---
There are other fragger ops that can be used. Its about changing the strat with other ops. Use a different support, etc.
---
I didn’t mean it as rude, I was just making a joke about how your great ping is limiting your experience.
---
Why else does this post exist. Report the bug. Other wise it’s just teaching people how to cheat
---
One of many reasons casual is so terrible.
---
How do you prefer to play attack
---
On defense I roam and on attack I don’t know bc I always die. I was thinking about buying hibana, is that a good choice

Hello kainzy_, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

Jesus fuck, this is a perfect as example as to why spacing and holding different angles/sectors is important
---
&gt; It will cause others to focus on trying other ops. Not just maining one.
---
Forcing people to play a certain way isn't good generally.
---
&gt;Will cause better teamwork. Who can play this op, or this op?
---
Will just cause people to bounce between a couple of ops.
---
I just don't see the point.
---
Dang the barrel is extra E x t e n d e d
---
i give you that black ice for free i got it but never use the gun
---
The guy at high ranks is such a crutch op, he has 60 hp on his shield so every gun in the game except the dmr shotty needs to rounds to just get passed the shield, but with the shotty the recoil is so much you won't be able to land another shot. He's pretty damn op.

I literally got a 4K once and they kicked me for no reason

Guy, you dont have to get defensive, a Remington would be nice in the game, I'm just saying Ghosts happened to pop in my head after seeing that

Ubisoft announce this dogshit money-grab attempt and some people eat this shit up like sheep. People who spend ludacris amounts of money on microtransactions on siege are the reason Ubisoft keep releasing these scummy business practices; because people won't hesitate to buy it.

New surprise mechanics, how exciting. Hope you get one extra pack if you own the season pass and buy a battle pass too.

That would actually be sick.

How did you know

Uplay doesn't use steam in any sort of way except for a means to sell the game, you and your friends are all going to be using uplay accounts to play together

Magic man, magic!

They killed Marco/Kelly so hard just to shoehorn him and star together. Star was a shit person.

They had me in the first half, not gonna lie

His mods on discord are crazy I would just make another account.  Badger himself doesn’t really mod that much.  If you look at the comments on one of his battlefield 1 videos you can see the comments have a similar problem.

Dpi gone wild at the end

I know I already want Kaplan and lesions head gear

Who's skill is that?

A handful of those are actually already in the game.

This is why i never play casual bomb, for some reason it's just full of toxic try hards.
---
U need glasses to see!
---
Nice. Can't wait to not play it! The last Halloween event I didn't play looked fun, as did the Toy one this year. One day... one day they'll let lonely losers, with one friend like myself, play things in Solo THunt... hahaha, who am I kidding!? No they won't.
---
I have 600 and 8000 dpi set on my mouse lol

I’m not saying it needs to be that pic but modeled off it
---
I'm the same for the JTF 2. I have all of them for both ops except the CAMRS
---
Hello fellow gamer, you have to understand that they have 100+ weapon or so, and you can't put a weapon giving it the same name as the original, without paying the license to the house who made it.
---
Cheers, n4meless24.

If a person is wasting my time sitting in a corner and not listening to the team I'm kicking them sorry it's their own fault. I wanna see my team make an effort

It's a picture from the Berlin Wall... Which the shield is based on...
---
Fucking HAUNTED
---
I bet the way I spelled things, you on ps4?
---
Gotta remove the vote kick ability for premade 4s. Stupid ass kids just take turns TKing you every round, then kick you once the reverse friendly fire is on all of them.
---
Sure, it opens them up to be targetted and trolled by the one stranger, but the stranger doesn't know they are premade, whereas the current system just allows squads of 4 to run rampant in this game, ruining everything.
---
Or at the very least, make it so you can't vote kick against someone you TK'd.
---
There’s already about 100 guns in this game at the moment, there is a limit to how many licenses they can use at once.
---
Hmm, I guess in that perspective you are right. Still, I think both that and Oregon can stay in the ranked pool because if we drop too many maps then imo then ranked as a whole would get stale because of the lack of Variety.
---
Hm who knows ^^
---
On paper yea, in active duty it just made the gun more complicated to maintain and loading the gun with a magazine made it jam constantly
---
It’s telling that the us military is attempting to phase the m249 out with the IAR
---
Aw man
---
Fucking hate those guys
---
I played 1 v 5 one time 20 years ago when they booted my whole team and I clutched them after. Ran into the same clan the next day and they pretended they didn't remember.
---
Long Boi
---
Honestly... so what? They're a company, that's kind of their deal.
---
As long as they still focus on fun operators, maps and gameplay, *using* that BP money to fund it all, I see no problem with it. 
---
Besides, if the BPs are anything like other BPs, $10 for a bunch of rewards is hardly a scam.
---
What would monster be like?
---
you dont have to leave a game where you got tkd cuz the killer can only do it once now since the new update.
---
(not saying you are bad ) you can learn to not get killed if someone is peeking , by playing more youll get knowlege on how to counter.
---
But if you always quit, your learning is hindered and you wont learn how to defeat a spwan peeking enemy but to quit as a solution.
---
&lt;pro-tip: use your drone to check if your spawn is affected by a peek ,
---
if you are thinking that someone might be peeking.
---
if the case you can further plan to counter it by :
---
1: locating
---
2: deciding from where to peek (keep in mind where he is expecting you to come from)
---
3: facing enemy or taking other route to get out of the situation
---
Dont just rush out of spawn straight to the building!
---
Because his gadget is electrical and the mute jammer blocks the signal for the flash to go off
---
I fuckin' wish.
---
The US military also doesn't keep squad machine guns in service for very long, in comparison to the AR platform.
---
Same as the people who rage quit round 1
---
Mmm yeah, I know how they work, but still, you have a paywall in a game with a lot of bullshitery around about $$$, the game isn't F2P, it have season pass, elite skins, bundle skins, all cosmetics, are a lot of money, and usually a lot of them, are just colors and some events, like the bandits and sheriff's, and you still need to pay 60$ (if my mind doesn't lie) for all of that, 60 bucks for in game deals like this, just kills me inside.
---
I don't have a problem spending money, my problem is when they make it something too cocky and too common.
---
Battle passes are fine, but in a game like this, I will still waiting to see how it ends, I hope it ends good.
---
UGH Rook, stop calling me
---
“Did you check your angles, Bandit?”
---
&gt;”Yeah, I did.”
---
“All of them?”
---
&gt;*#”ALL OF THEM”*
---
Why? They already sell elite skins, pro league skins, special gun skins, they sell credits that you can use to buy ops, alpha packs and skins. What's the difference? This is still only cosmetics. 
---
The second battle pass will have a free "track" where you'll get all of the story and some free rewards. You don't need to get the premium BP. I don't see any problem with it as long as it is priced appropriately (5-10 or something like that) and doesn't turn into a slippery slopes.
---
No, as a matter of fact I ran into a booster on my team, I teamkilled him and I left the match ( Ranked )
---
I hate the toxic tryhard server. I just want to try the new content without getting team killed, berated for picking them, or people banning them... But that is too much to ask for I guess
---
Imma need to know what gaming chair you use
---
You call it Unplayable, I call it America kicked German ass and it’s in the Tom Clancy Universe so the Americans made the Germans switch to the superior Two hole electric plugs... because Tom Clancy = Fuck yeah USA
---
I want refund.
---
Yeah, alpha packs have so much garbage in them its rare we get anything worth it, i like the idea of a pass just because we're earning something, even if theres a tier to pay for.
---
but in siege skins don't cost up to 800 dollar, and in csgo there are cheap good looking skins, but not many for free, in siege there are a lot of good looking skins for free (renown ofc)
---
U r nor but that’s why r6 don’t price the stuff like csgo
---
Really?
---
A full size bed with built in blanket over the shoulders my good man
---
Nope. They will rotate around to get the easiest games.
---
I just wanted to play as a soft warm up for ranked.
---
Better walls to test guns are on Bank
---
on ranked yes . But in newcomer ? they still crush the real newbies
---
It will be good just r6 don’t price stuff
---
You can, but still, I like I can unlock things, after all, it's what makes you feel you are progressing.
---
And then it’s all dlc after that

Of course, she’s the Rainbow engineer right? I got some nuts that need tightening lmao

I only remember doing this once, and it was because the guy decided to team kill the rest of us right at the start, then proceeded to try and solo the rest of the match.

We didn't give him the chance.

 My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Here in Norway it's called Papirhuset, which is a literal translation from la casa de papel. When I went to Britain recently and checked Netflix there it was called Money Heist (which is a terrible title, let's be honest!), so I think it is the same in the USA.

---
Blyat they banned my main
---
I’m sure it’ll tease changes to the map for season 4 since the event will occur 2 months before the new seasons starts
---
Villa is an alright map, it just has a useless basement
---
I would have to say it is the costs.
---
I will agree with this
---
IMO were getting a horror movie event to go with these. Imagine everyone else being the spooky bitch hunting down cave in a 1v9 sort of setting. Would make the contrast make a lot of sense
---
Well obviously not. I'm talking about if you have two ADSs on a each side of the window or right on top of each other won't they both shoot the same grenade and thus, waste a charge?
---
Yes except operators can be banned. Better off to just play Casual.
---
#RIOT
---
Yeah. Less chokepointy and less window snipe apparently. I'm also getting back into it. I'm still updating myself on new operators.
---
Yep that basement is pure shite
---
Newcomer as well as Casual is pretty much the Epidemy of Toxicity on PC. I can tell things will change (hopefully) quite a bit as soon as Unranked is introduced next month. Should make the experience much more enjoyable

---
Those watermarks though wtf???? Lmaoo
---
OH MY GOD KAPKAN
---
i know, the berlin wall did it for the gays too...
---
That is literally the exact opposite of what stock images are for actually. Hence why they have a watermark, you pay to get access to the version with no watermark so you can use it for your business.
---
I am givin u shit tho haha
---
Maybe not...there may be other ways to vault/rappel to the right position
---
The sound in that map is a mess.

Jäger is like my friends, sending links to thinks a 2:31 in the morning, looking at you Craig
---
But I want to have it you know?
---
I pay every year for the season pass I buy from time to time the elite skins and sometimes even the event lootboxes but the fucking battlepass is the biggest OVERKILL I've ever seen.
---
If ubishit would care about us they would fix the ddos issues, they would fix broken operators and they would add the battlepass for free but nooo not with greedy ubisoft they want everything you have.
---
They followed a good path - until chimera it gone downhill.
---
and I want to know more about the lore and want new goals in this game but hey they put it behind a paywall.
---
You'll get there, I mostly use it for burst fire headshots, it's not really built for prolonged fire. But recoil control just becomes second nature after a while
---
I love that Ubi has been creating more lore for Siege in recent years
---
Lmao yeah i get you
---
Ya and your casual mmr will better reflect your level of skill
---
You do realize that the Battle pass and other forms of monetezation are the reason the game will last the 10 and maybe many more years. There is a business behind the game and they will support it as long it makes a good amount of money. Despite that they won’t take the step to make ops only available through real money since that would cost them a big amount of their players. As long the battle pass only contains cosmetics, lore and boosters I’m fine with it. There are already normal store items which are only accessible through r6 credits. The battle pass is just an other method of selling those plus the casual user is granted free items as reward for playing which we asked for a long time
---
It’s her natural hair color. Ela is a blond

The fuck is going on with her bangs. She looks like Stephanie from Lazy Town but with blonde hair.

Yeah but you’ll be at a safe distance. Just throw and forget, come back and rush in.
---
Rip spare time
---
Yea, but this guy was going off about how I was garbage after me explaining it all to him lmao. Just look at his comments and you can see. I blocked him because his toxicity was off the charts. And like I said in the comments below, This guy is still going off on me after I explained how; when your aim and move buttons are the same as your lean buttons, its an involuntary action to "lean spam", but on MnK its different because you have to actively press 2 seperate buttons that have no correlation with move and aim, and are directly for leaning. Im in silver 4, im not good, I had no clue what lean spam was till today, I looked at videos and not once did I lean spam. During gun fights I wasnt lean spamming. On the stairs, I was getting a good angle lmao. This kid is obsessed with my vid 😂
---
Black ice or elite skin... So hard to choose
---
that would be my thought too, his hp was low enough that the gu killed him.
---
dangers of in-engine cutscenes.
---

---
R/wooooosh

No they won’t, they both have a range and as soon as it enters the range it will destroy it and they both can’t have the same range
---
Bah HUMBUG!
---
he got some nice jiggle physics
---
I need a username like many people have “PM_TIDDY_PICS” or whatever. Mostly people send random shit instead of tits obviously but it would be funny to see all the random shit
---
It’s based on her backstory as an edgy art student
---
(This is not a joke she is in fact an edgy artist)
---
Then he should be playing casual to guarantee they’re available.
---
I mean they all pushed one by one and missed almost all of their shots. IMO that's pretty aimless
---
you put them in high-traffic areas such as the drug room window on Theme Park to stop as much shit from coming in as possible. 1 ADS can be burned with 2 flashes, making it virtually useless. it's also a strat to just have all 3 in there &amp; have someone hold the room.
---
Love how you had a camera on it as well.
---
Outback is insane
---
No, but when I see any kind of professional sporting event, they don't need a play-by-play caster for the audience. The audience generates their own atmosphere with chants, songs, slogans, etc. 
---
Imagine play-by-play casting at a soccer match on the PA, that just doesn't fit, and it's not necessary.
---
Half the map is already spooky themed and the other half is too dark to see!
---
They could just change the name and it'd be perfect for Halloween!
---
Yea that's a weird choice, the textures almost look lower res
---
I am that kind of friend as well so https://youtu.be/qIWH-ArjdOM

Oh god this isnt even bad. 2 weeks ago was playing ranked with my buddies on Bank. We knew there was a Mozzie hiding in CEO so my friend called it out and I immediately one tapped a wall and just domed the fuck outta Mozzie. Even though it was ranked I took the time to message him and apologize because omg it was so beautiful but looked soooooo bad for me!!! (I play Xbox)
---
Ubisoft should just separate controller users from Mouse and keyboard users for console and even in pc.
---
That too, stopped playing it after a couple days.
---
/s ?
---
You're a god big fella
---
They haven’t announced anything about pricing the battlepass. It may be included or discounted with the seasonpass. I am really excited for more lore too! I won’t be getting the battlepass but instead will watch all the new lore stuff when it’s on YouTube.
---
I’m confused.
---
My luck I would have gotten 1 then get flicked headshot instantly.
---
Also you’ll come to learn calling out and being on cams and understanding the maps are just as important as gunfights and can be a lot of fun when done right
---
Don't understand what benefit it has to the game at all.
---
Hello kira_noob,
---
Exactly
---
can’t one ads take 3 projectiles tho? I don’t see any reason you would spread your ads’ out
---
Agreed. For a multi billion dollar company adding a battlepass when we already have a season pass is quite scummy. Not to mention them releasing a full priced game that takes the story mode we've been asking for since the game came out and putting out as a seperate co op game we've already played with outbreak. Quarantine in my eyes is much worse than the battle pass.
---
But i dont wanna have to wait a month for all the cheaters to get banned
---
Been a problem for 4 years don’t worry
---
Who's the most pathetic? You complaining for the millionth time about something that is GETTING FIXED NEXT SEASON? Or me trying to make you think about it (to make you maybe realise that it's not that important and that nobody can do anything about it except toxic guys who need to fake their ranks with tricks like this) ? (On another note, you need to chill out dude)
---
Everybody's chill til The Lord gets headshot.
---
Oh no. That sounds like a nightmare for OBJ Rush strat. Luckily they aren't to hard to counter.
---
Edgy
---
That just makes sense. 
---
I’m completely fine with rebuying the dlc on it’s respective platform. Plus they said you’ll be able to use gear you’ve already acquired. The dlc is just for the specific quests and special events/modes basically.
---
makes it so the defenders get a slight chance to go unnoticed. can’t totally stack it for your attackers
---
OK that makes sense.
---
I wish I could run this with the elite :(
---
Yeahhh I cant break into my normal rank (struggling plat 1 to reach diamond) Been dossed so many times this season!!! I'm not a diamond player I'll admit that but I can hold my own in that rank but fuck sake man, I can't go a night of ranked without being dossed at least twice.

There’s a reason they’re gearing the game to the pro scene. The map is good I don’t know why you think otherwise

you mean new kanal?
---
Yes and that is bullshit. They could just add variants and the licensing thing is a lie.
---
Nice wouldn’t want you wasting enough renown for a new op on a dumb looking headgear enjoy
---
Yeah, the ACOG frame could be found very obstructive when moving a lot, i just use it when i want to hold angles and play slow
---
Okay and for the majority that doesn’t? It’s not worth it
---
Frost looking like a Tarkatan right there
---
R6 can add fast txt
---
Well kinda suck but I’ll try, I need about 4000 more
---
I feel like there could be 2 solutions 
---
Bring up 5 random maps each team bans 2 then play on the unbanned map 
---
Or 
---
Bring up 3 maps and each player votes, the one with the most votes is played, if it's 50/50 between 2 maps one of those maps will randomly be chosen 
---
I feel like this would be nice in ranked but then unranked is just random
---
Just buy a cheap Bluetooth one.
---
*know
---
i love how surprised you were, you stopped to record in the middle of the gun fight LOL
---
\+ operators with old guns
---
Thing is it’s also based on the gun, some work well with it, but like maverick’s M4 it works better with a red dot.
---
The best waste man, the best waste
---
Because they would totally give a defender an attacker secondary. You created glaz 2.0. This is a stupid idea
---
Man imagine all those skyscraper bans... A man can dream
---
R u bc everything I lose when I have ppl that do talk they come to game chat when the game is over
---
Lmao bandit looks like doctor from DbD. Skins are dope though
---
Yeah, I was pretty bummed they didn't have the red suit to match, but it's still an unexpected and awesome cameo nonetheless.
---
Fair enough i on pc or console
---
Remember, no Jackal
---
Exactly what I was thinking!
---
He has become the long boi.
---
But how are he do it?
---
Click here to find out
---
C8 isn’t all that bad
---
Congrats ! Well done
---
This is not true. You get a single week battle pass in s3 that they showed has mainly charms. Then in s4 there is a free one (guaranteed to be filled with garbage like the s3 free one) and a paid one that will have all the actually good cosmetics (Which they could have also made free). 
---
It’s just Ubisoft being greedy and adding another needless monetization style to a game that’s full of them already.
---
Whats TTS normally?
---
But how do you know she look like this in art School it’s not confirmed until it’s actually released
---
He probably is to be honest. In my opinion i dont want it because i have parental controls on my acoount for some reason that it beyond me. I should be able to sit in a party by myself for if people get on and join
---
I didn’t even mention Jackal in my comment lol
---
+ castle + mute
---
Imagine not having to play villa and fortress over and over :) that would be amazing
---
Finally I won't be yelled at for not being Thermite.
---
How about no
---
Ok I will make it short cause I have little to no time rn.
---
I really think you don't understand entire idea of Season Pass, at all. When you buy any base game - you get what was on base game. Buying season pass should give you ALL new stuff - cosmetics, gamemodes, weapons etc. etc., depending on game genre of course. 
---
You see, Season pass of R6 isn't really a season pass, even if it's called so. It's more like pack of operators and seasonal skins. Now with each season there are less skins, less enjoybale operators, however number of paid cosometics that are not included is constantly growing. 
---
Also - once again - it's in interest of developers to keep the game alive with free content to keep new players flow comming and sell more copies - also possibly hook more players taht will pay for cosmetics.
---
I just in the match and banned Jackal xDD
---
it can;
---
reduce stress, enhance sleep quality, boost your mood, release tension, help with concentration, lower the risk of getting prostate cancer, relieve menstrual cramps, alleviate pain and also improve sex
---
I'm gonna hit you with an uno reverse card and ask:
---
What is unhealthy about masturbating, let's say, once a day?
---
i’d be so upset if i was that chanka. that seems par for the course for me in siege. i do something and just immediately get lasered then 2 seconds later someone does the exact same thing and nobody is paying attention there anymore
---
OK I'm gonna half agree with you, fortress is going which is good but I actually really like villa
---
Technical Test Server
---
PC although I was a console man for most of my life
---
Hey guys, Its Ian from forgotten weapons dot com, and to day we are looking at a not so forgotten shotgun, the SAS 2 bore stopping gun, this shotgun was intended to be used vs IRA technicals during the 19-80s. Its a shoulder mounted evolution of the boys anti tank rifle, but with the power brought down, were it would \*chuckles merely throw the operator off there feet. Now we actually have some footage of this gun in action, check it out.
---
Funny cuz the data doesn't bear that out.
---
PL sees [capitao, lion, monty, mav, and nomad](https://i.redd.it/1tpkkfnqcfc31.jpg) banned more often (likely because it doesn't indicate whose prints are whose before scanning so you have a 20-80% chance of pinging someone in relative safety depending on timing and roamer quantity)
---
And his Win Delta sees him underpowered
---
Thanks you :3
---
Same but it’s much better tbh
---
That was quick damn
---
Hello kanaxiety,
---
Ahhh A fellow RB &amp; GTS player, salutations.
---
I can see the appeal of villa but I just feel like every new map is desert themed or barren with no plant life, for some reason this bugs me a lot and I have no clue why
---
Bruh just stop crying if you dont like it dont pay for it let people who like it pay for it or are you jealous that people have cosmetics they bought that you cant have ?
---
I only play casual and having mmr in casual has degraded my experience so much that I had to buy an alt account or I couldn't find any matches.  
---
What is even worse is that I live in the country where the weu server is located, I should find matches easily.
---
I dunno how many 1v5's I've won as an attacker from people just hurling themselves out windows trying to kill me. It's a lot of fun, especially when playing a passive Glaz, because it goes from a stressful situation to a shooting gallery.
---
good luck with ddoser
---
Oh yeah, it's all comin together
---
We're talking about console right? In my experience people generally type slow when using a controller. I don't know what you mean by fast text.
---
Doc looks sick af
---
I like it especially the animation i just hope the gadget skin looks good
---
No illegal, just perspective
---
Yeh hence im not playing the game right now :(
---
Hmmmm
---
This bot is like Ubisoft, they'll never admit a mistake
---
But hes fatter, and has a pea gun!
---
Nae nae on this bitch
---
If they want fast gameplay why are they playing R6?
---
You deadass looked him up!!
---
Thx 2 all
---
That is why you fail... GG
---
We need Hardware ID Bans
---
f.E. your RAM
---
I hate it when that happens so much I was once roaming as cav and it was a 1v3 and I got kicked before I even got a chance to clutch
---
Don't forget recruit
---
Yea like Capitao, Lion, Monty, Mav, and Nomad.
---
All of whom had higher ban rates than him in PL
---
Okay, okay, you got me :(
---
So from 0 to -0
---
Damn got me there with a typo
---
I’ve seen that parking garage before in the reflection of a scope or something, it may just be the default reflection that they use
---
How about if im plat 3 and my friend is gold 2?
---
They're going in the right direction with the buff he's getting next season. Reduced movement penalty for seeing through the smoke is the way to go. His kit is really good for close to range combat. Honestly the only other thing I'd say is to give him a nitrocell
---
You're too good for me
---
Yep I'm a retard
---
Oh for sure, but for not playing PC much and not being big on FPS games in general it's been a learning experience. Throw in a wonky left hand and ya,  lot of being mvp then zero kills next game lmao
---
I wasn't the biggest fan of it at first but as time has passed it's become one of my favourites, I actually think watching pros play on it has made it a more enjoyable map to me, but a map ban system could be great if you're not comfortable on a specific map
---
Don't know why gamers gotta bitch bout this sad cosmetics shit that 0.00001% of the community even notices during gameplay
---
Huh
---
Same but I left because fuck paid online services
---
*Nails fly across the map.*
---
Uh Kapkan looks baddddd asss, but why is Gridlock in blackface?
---
Base weapons up to buck and frost.  Lion can get it from the revolver shotgun and 417, finka sausage and pistols, nøkk with the fmg9, wardens shotgun, the new op with amuru with the lmg
---
Time to unsub
---
You caught him off guard in a casual mate lmfaooo
---
Especially with that rate of fire. Yall already know I had her on lock before her big nerf.
---
Oh shit, here we go again
---
Seconded, nofap might actually be bad in the long run, not to mention that sub is full of fanatical neckbeards who think quitting fapping will turn them into instant chick magnets.
---
But porn is the real problem here, quitting porn is much better...
---
you're not 18 right?
---
Most people have stopped caring about alpha packs long ago. Far too much filler in them and too much work to get them.

Hello PizzaWizardR6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ct6lzq/our_cosplay_group_had_a_great_time_at_the_raleigh/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Waiting list: Mute, Thatcher, Maestro, Caviera
---
Yeah Halloween indeed
---
hehe
---
Then that is why its not happening on that platform because of pro players and the more competitive aspect to it. But it needs to be sorted for console because a vast majority of players are on console
---
God
---
That lesion skin some Gu(Mine)de looking shit
---
Probably because it is already an existing weapon and is a DMR which won't cause that much problem like an assault rifle or an SMG would
---
Like a year ago. Map was fine when it first came out, but now that everyone knows how to attack the only two viable sites on the map, and neither of those sites are fun to defend, it's just total shit.
---
Alpine maps would be awesome, maybe a summer house near a cliff/bluff, and one spawn point requires attackers to rappel up the cliff
---
Rookie numbers
---
That's fine. It was meant with malice. I just was just reminiscing back to MW2 days. Like, this guy has more skill than I do. I was just making an observation.
---
Well yeah casual offers more content for me, I play ranked as well, I learned the game in ranked, I only started playing casual like last season, before that it was always ranked, and I've had the game since it came out.
---
Lol, it's all a simulation, man, so it's okay to pop their heads from time to time, it's his way of bonding.
---
it’s on TTS?
---
nut!
---
WHAT ARE WE YELLING ABOUT!?!?!?!?!
---
The point is, no one wants to see a 1 kill run out in a casual. No offense boss.
---
I feel you, I personally wish she did more damage per bullet but I’m not a balancing dev or an esports player so my opinion isn’t worth much. It just seems too much of a peashooter
---
They should release a TTS-exclusive Operator with the ability to absorb all sweat in the map in an instance and then shoot it back at the enemy. I have Never encounterd such sweaty Players in my whole life. Even in my 10 years of CoD i Never saw so much sweat produced by 5 human bodies. On the live servers i may encounter 1 or 2 of These tryhards maybe every fifth match or so (im probably just Lucky).
---
Haha nah. This year I can't be on the gamescom
---
But less tryharding cause there is no rank.
---
Capitao is 3 speed and has acog, whoops.
---
Just bc you don't want to see it doesn't mean other don't, your not the only one in this world, no offense boss.
---
But as someone who doesn’t have many skins I like getting them
---
Also, if you play Forza Horizon 4 and you want one of these, either type in my username: guns11ng3r2000, or type in"(Operator) Icon R6S"
---
Oh, you wan't me to scan your QR code?
---
perhaps he's compensating for something
---
I don’t really like it. That’s just my opinion though
---
Oh my
---
Awesome. Do you got smg 12?
---
Operators, loadout, sights, acog.
---
Watch the reflection, it's just where it shows you the zoomed weapons.
---
Wtf
---
On defense.
---
I think it looks alright
---
Capitao isn't a defender
---
Did this so much in rainbow is magic
---
People want to see how the OPs might fit into the meta, or how they work with a coordinated push/defense which is less likely to happen during casual due to the ruleset differences.
---
Yeah lol I know it's a simulation, I just find it funny how his lore contradicts his play style 
---
Lore : I will protect all of you 
---
Play style : *spawnpeeks and gets 3 kills*
---
It was in some stupid packs for a limited time. You can’t receive this item anymore.
---
Does every gun have a black ice version? If so, GIMME BLACK ICE ALDA!
---
Just. Take. My. Money.
---
That's a point. I am searching for nice guy who could do it for me
---
It's so good seeing ubi go back to the OG operators and giving them more backstory and it's really funny reading about the different relationships between the ops and how they are impressed by the other ones gadget.
---
I can only recommend everyone to read all the OG operators bios again.
---
M'Capitão
---
*A bit* quiter. I didn't say it should be quiet at all.
---
Where'd he go?
---
It’s  buck and frost and then black ice como stops
---
That’s it, I’m not playing Rainbow anymore.
---
you ignorance amuses me, enjoy staying an empty shell

The guy who created cat dog is from the town I currently live in.

---
"Keep in mind, however, that Ranked policies also apply to \[the Unranked\] playlist,  and any sanctions you incur in it will also apply to the Ranked  playlist....
---
The first thing we’re changing pertains to the sanctions a player receives for leaving a Ranked (or Unranked) match in progress.  Repeat offenders will now get increased suspension durations for every time they leave a match in those two playlists. Additionally, when a player  leaves a Ranked or Unranked match, other playlists will be locked while  the match they quit is ongoing. "
---
I'm assuming that since players are going to be penalized for leaving, there will be no backfill (i.e. it will be exactly like Ranked in this area).
---
Ya sure, dm me.
---
I made a doc emblem on bf4 once
---
That lesion skin is amazing
---
Yeah but remember this is reddit we're not allowed to enjoy the new content, we have to complain about recycled guns and the battle pass
---
noice
---
It’s called Halloween
---
They can really add an UTAS UTS which is the true CTU tactical shotgun
---
Ya'll need some history lessons, motherfrickers!

Hello Th3MemeL0rd, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ct6qal/how_can_i_play_ember_rise_now/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
When do you calculate it?  If only at the end of a match, that is RIPE for exploitation.  Just have the boosters quit and the player being boosted gets credit for a 1v5 win.  Then switch to different smurfs (or play one casual) and do it again.  It would make boosting much more effective (and thus popular).
---
It also falls down
---
**Happy Kapkan noises**
---
Yeah it's basically my friends. Bunch of toxic fuckers....
---
K
---
no.
---
Yeah, but when you run out of new players, you need to adapt. Free content doesn't pay developers
---
They’re making it so groups get activated by RFF
---
man short drone
---
oh my god I just realized that’s not what OP was talking about he was talking about hitting the next rank .-. 
---
I completely thought it was the renown and mmr gain
---
Because I prefer it? Large mag, high damage, good sights, low recoil. It's a great side arm and I trust myself with it more than the smg.
---
Dissipate quicker &amp; smaller area I think is fair.
---
dam, unfortunately u posted cringe bro, gotta delet
---
Nice, dual wielding for IQ.
---
Why did you buy an online multiplayer game if you have no wifi?
---
If everyone is OP is anyone OP?
---
I kind of like this idea.  The gameplay would be so uneven and chaotic, but it might be fun.
---
Thanks for your feedback!
---
The first reason is understandable.
---
The second reason is a crappy excuse. Ubisoft skirts around licensing **all the time**.
---
See almost half the guns in this game. Most of them skirt licensing by having different names than the IRL firearm itself.
---
Lmao Finka hitting the Nae Nae on them haters
---
Tangy is a twitch steamer and he is posting that he killed him
---
Theres an operator symbol I dont know in top left next to his. Its cav green but looks like a volcano?
---
I agree with everything you said, I was asking unrelated to the fact that it’s cheating.
---
She looks like she’s running like warden or maybe like a zombie.
---
Another person reposted last time without credit as well.
---
That's the new operator Goyo
---
If it was right after that game it still could have been the servers. Did you beat them? Did they destroy you, If they did then yea maybe they were dossing.
---
Omae wa moe, Shindeiru
---
Obviously. My question is how big is the difference.
---
Not the  spawnpeeks? Like you could ace just by opening small box and peeking the windows
---
that barely even looks different
---
I bought it when i did have wifi, then my mom started working with herbalife and now we cant afford to live in the cheapest apartment where i live
---
*BEANS*
---
the left just looks far better texture-wise.
---
The .500 S&amp;W Revolver can kill this way. An inexperienced user is able to shoot once and as it flies back from recoil it can fire a second time.
---
wait werent the latest leaks about zombies?
---
2:33 where they show it he’s missing the red suit and it’s just pictures tho. Not sure if there’s a video yet,but I liked what I saw that’s for sure
---
Yup
---
I know people who are greying in their 20's.
---
Buddy . Someone opened 3 alpha packs that got 3 black ices in row on youtube that someone donated him 1500 dollars
---
Then they face copyright issues for using the brand name
---
No I think it’s safe to say that it is normally the toxic tryhard server
---
Does this make it a 6-speed operator?
---
bruh moment
---
Thatcher, Maestro, and Caviera won't be out until tonight or tomorrow. If there are any more requests, please submit them
---
Ig: @dbl_online has the full video of her animation and 360 of her uniform
---
Fair enough, I have strong feelings towards mnk on console lol.
---
Like I said, using mnk on console gives you the same advantages over controller players as you would have on pc. faster aiming, more precise aiming, button mapping potential, ect...
---
Hello OrganicLag,
---
This is just me, but it looks like the second cam is actually placed slightly higher than the first hence why it's being blocked
---
*[REDACTED]*
---
First it was hibana... Now its thermite.... Why?
---
My 2 friends and I (we didn't buy the season pass) are totally gonna do this the whole next season's first week in ranked. Toxic? Maybe. Effective? Definitely.
---
exactly. It wouldn't be a carbon copy of the ATK smoke grenade, but still effective and could be good on ops like warden, or roamers as a way to escape stealthily.
---
I’ve read that teams got multiple guns with their skin. It’s just uniforms and headgears that are for one operator.
---
OOF for Jäger. Can only block 6 grenades. now there is 10 of them.
---
pea shooter + high RoF = headshot machine
---
it's ttk isn't even lower than other guns on average even with all body shots tho
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QF72f4Bm7PfbWeSWbl8R8uL0mOzXpG_1vOjqEjXcFGk/edit#gid=0
---
3 armor and you hit in the shoulder mostly
---
WTF
---
ash drank some monster
---
Hell of a play. Surprised the second one didn’t blast you also
---
Beat me to it with 3 hours!
---
You're lucky wardens a hard counter
---
So basically idea 2 is a better kapkan
---
Same here
---
Looked like head to me
---
I respect that but still, isn't that the whole situation that results of adding new ops and updating their game
---
The blood splatter from the shoulder goes over the head
---
I dont know if he has it
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
I feel like they're gonna start doing one of each season. Mira will be military ela is casual
---
Definitely making her 3 Speed. I highly doubt Ubi will change her gun which means the only way to adjust Nokk is through her gadget and armor/speed rate.
---
If she becomes 3 Speed, it would make her a slightly better at flanking than the majority of the Attackers including the other 3 Speeds. It will allow her to change her location much more aggressively. 
---
It could justify her lack of gadget and weak guns.
---
It might even justify Echo and Mozzie being a counter since she can be played more efficiently.
---
Relax they’re fixing it next season
---
Ill keep that in mind. 
---
I just need to be good ... huh ...
---
You almost have to treat it like elas gun.  Just commit in your mind to only take very close gun fights.  It's a very strong gun so you'll shred them if they're 5 meters away.
---
so what, this gets posted constantly here
---
good bot
---
Thermite's face on TTS looks like his face in outbreak mode trailer
---
I made a joke earlier about Jäger needing to worry about grenades now and got downvoted a few times. I will never understand some people🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
People don’t like casual ruleset
---
*laughs in Fuze*
---
Hibana from below? Idk lol
---
Chiron Man
---
jesus christ.... why is it so hard to grasp that testing new ops is better in a ranked gamemode? Casual is a fk fest with random sites and tk/votekicks constantly.
---
Unless it's still used by special operatives today that kind of goes against the spirit of the game.
---
o shit waddup!

"I feel like I'm gonna break the damn thing!"

Omg

So good
---
we got a tough guy over here
---
How is it a better Kapkan? It’s a ranged throwable that allows more ranged breaching while allowing you to use it to clear utility as well. It makes so much sense and is quite frankly needed. 
---
As for the Impact Smokes, it’s a really good idea that still requires a lot of coordination and skill to use. Could benefit warden a lot as well, but only twice and with a small window of opportunity. 
---
Two ideas that would really add more variety and choice in game. I say let’s do it and add them
---
Oh, I noticed the reflection ages ago and knew it was a parking lot of some sort so when I saw this frame I instantly knew what it was
