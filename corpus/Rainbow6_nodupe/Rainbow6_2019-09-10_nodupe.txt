It has one door, and 3 other entrances that don‚Äôt require hanging on a rappel wire.

And two of the three vaultable entrances leave you very exposed.

thank you much

They removed it cause it has one door. It‚Äôs bad and pretty defender sided since it‚Äôs meant for Article 5.
---
Probably because boi sounds like Boy and thats a meme. Or maybe because of the rural part of brazil? Idk i just think its not a good choice of animal. I mean The best animal choice i think it is the Blue ara ara from rio.

Yes

I would say contact i got mine immediately

Anyone has info about when this update will go live on consoles ?

I think he's not under contract with ubisoft / esl. At least not a permanent one. It's more like a freelancer thing I guess.
---
That man was murdered
---
To put it in your own terms:
---
As Anakin hated Obi-Wan, this game‚Äôs community hates blitz
---
I agree. And as a Jackal Main I absolutely agree with your earlier point that his pings last too long. Personal I wish we would have 5 total scans but have them only ping once or twice.
---
‚Äú***your only now realizing its ultimate power? MORTAL FOOL***‚Äù

Ah yes I agree.

who and where should i contact?

There‚Äôs really only two ways to get black ice, you either get really lucky and get it after your 240th try, or you save up and buy the 50 alpha pack bundle and your set on getting one at least or a legendary
---
Are you on PC?
---
Yes. PC. Sorry for leaving that out.
---
But Favela bad
---
Yeah that makes a lot of sense to me. I am glad Ubisoft has removed a lot of the obnoxious call of duty type things from the game already. Mechanics like drop shotting and crouch spamming are mostly gone or nerfed already which gives me hope that some day they‚Äôll address the 1 hit headshot kills.
---
talk to microsoft
---
Smashed her right in the box.
---
Ubisoft have been tweaking the footstep sounds for a while now. It used to be really loud and it used to be super quiet at one time too.
---
I don't really know if it should be louder or not because it might make rushing too easy and make intel tools less relevant.
---
Fuck. Bartlett.
---
hes using a VM (GeForce Now)
---
No how dare he do that
---
No but they should patch out the silent sprint
---
There already very loud. If you think there low try a different headset. I use the Arctis pro and you can hear them from far away
---
*Knockoff titanic theme*
---
Forget ubi, I'm taking your word for it! Thanks!! Can't wait to play it tomorrow! Thanks dude!
---
Lol wut
---
Can't spell "spawnpeek" without "rook", as I always say!
---
Wow. First of all, with the rng recoil, it makes a lot of headshots just be random bounces to the head. Also it would still be rewarding to go for headshots because there would still be a damage multiplier for them depending on the weapon. DMRs for example would still be able to 1 shot. Also you should be going for center of mass anyway since that‚Äôs whats actually ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù and what soldiers are trained to actually do.
---
He's cost like 500-2000 renown if you have the basic game iirc
---
What did I do
---
Lucky on my schools computers every single site is blocked by YouTube
---
It‚Äôs probably because you were outside so long
---
Everything
---
This is getting out of hand! Now there are 4 of them!
---
I heard I could potentially see enemies quicker
---
Major props
---
Nice, well here‚Äôs hoping the update comes tomorrow so you can unlock them. I don‚Äôt have maverick but cav is a lot of fun when you get used to playing her
---
Or was this a compliment? ;)
---
&lt;3
---
Nah, just make all 3 armors two speeds and remove ACOGs. Attackers can peek fine with 1x and the gun stat disparity between att/def more than makes up the difference.
---
My case rest
---
chill on the editing can hardly see whats happening
---
By that logic a C4 also makes barbed wire useless on the same operator, because why the hell wouldn't you take his C4 when any other op who doesn't have access to C4 could bring barbed.
---
Mom pls come pick me up
---
I'm scared
---
Cav will probably be released on Y5S1 or Y4S4. A leaker said that Buck, Capitao and Cav are next.
---
Oh no, someone not using meta attachments...

It was :(

This. Clash was the only one with worse score than Tachanka on her release but now she's in a much better place.

Warden with his new buff can at least do something against smokes. Tachanka still have no uses.

Wha-

It's very similar to a Israeli Civilian gas mask but with slight changes

Clash I think is a weird case. You can't play hero solo. You need communication which as we know isn't the general communities strong suit. Having a mobile Mira mirror that can slow enemies is powerful in the right team comp

I've seen a lot of my friends on xbox have gaps of lag. One of my roomates hit 100 ping for a week and the rest of us were fine. Some things that I recommend; if you haven't already, buy an either net cable and connect to your router for a wired connection. You can also check your network connection, look for what your NAT type is classified as. If your NAT type is "moderate", that could be the reason you are facing issues with connecting with others. If it is "closed", you will not be able to connect to lobbies. You want your NAT type to be "open".

You guys must not be very high ranks then (no offense intended of course). I seem to get ruined using that spot regularly, but then again I get ddosed daily so ranked is horrible for me anyway.

Yep that vid was pretty insightful.

Any idea on how to fix?

Honestly no. I've never had the issue so I've never looked into it.

The game does it out of spite. It targets people who are sure to rant about it on reddit.

Mute blocks the wall and part of the doorway for drones and Bandit covers the blind spot

jello

I'm speculating that they're finishing up a couple bugs and don't want to announce the season until they know for sure its smoothed out.

Wouldnt be surprised if they drop the patch notes sometime around 1am EST (4 hours from now)

Nice

Weird thing is, it‚Äôs just your camera. The character model is  normal

I know, I'm just pointing out that the"3 armour=acog" rule isn't truly universal, as proven by tachanka, clash, warden, and kiad to an extent. Also goyo now has the TSCG with acog and he is 2 armour

I think this happened during wind bastion as well. It‚Äôs counting the release as the day the operators are available for everyone. Meaning tomorrow the patch comes out

I got the Year 3 pass in parabellum and got all the operator skins for Season 1 and onward, however I didn't get the universal weapon skin. If you buy the Y4 season pass right now you'll get all the unique Y4 operator headgear's and uniforms, but you won't get the Volcano Universal weapon skin.

Lol, same, its all good though

HOW HAVE YOU NOT SEEN BLEACH ITS GREA-

Its pretty goo-

...Maybe try the first 2 seasons?

ah yes, refreshing to see a fellow j√§ger

pls bring acog back

I honestly like the copper charm color for this season ngl
---
They say they‚Äôre doing it so new players aren‚Äôt overwhelmed by all the maps. So they‚Äôre rotating the less balanced maps out/in every month.
---
lol you suck, i got to copper 4 at the beginning of the season, it took you long enough
---
How is he not dead?
---
Short Circuit for the 416c
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs been in the game since it‚Äôs release. I‚Äôm talking about all the Y1-Y4 operators who have been added post launch.
---
yes all of this
---
He‚Äôs good
---
had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
&gt;Smoke's impacts replaced with deployable shield
---
Fuck off

Good luck with mute‚Äôs symbol
---
I don't play shield ops cuz I feel like a bad person when I do.   They just seem silly to me.
---
A lot of noobs use Monty which makes people hate having him on the team.
---
Mine is JFK getting whacked with a bat by cat in the hat. Soooo yeah this would be AWESOME
---
i just get alot of hate for having a monty main flair
---
Nice job!
---
First of all, I didn't downvote you. 
---
Ash's playstyle from using R4C didn't really change as it was/is still a rush choice of a weapon. 
---
As I've said before, one main complaint against Nokk is her lack of damage. 
---
Though regardless of all that, I'm not sure if Ubi will start changing around loadouts.

You should message panda and squad tf up bro

He just wanted to be a good doc :(((

I might be big blind dumb fuck but the pic was sideways and I literally didn‚Äôt see the gun at first. Try a better background Coker to really make the rest pop
---
(not only blindly agrees, but immediately passes on as fact)
---
i might leave the game if  this happened to me
---
Uh. No. I have played Blitz from before launch to today. ADS has never been this slow. Ever.
---
Pretty good, not gonna lie üëç
---
The sad part is, a lot of monty mains drop their shield to 360s for some reason. This is sadly the only one I could record at the time. LOL
---
How much do you want??
---
nt

actually i liked attacking better because of the destructible floors that were under maps

Why can u get flashed from behind by blitz

Ash Main checking in.

I got this and I make circuit boards for a living so I slapped that bad boy on and went for some pulse games üòÅ
---
Some people do. I would think that there's videos on YouTube but I assumed you already checked
---
\&gt;! Like this \!&lt;
---
It's all about  what you like in collectables.
---
You act like you would throw it exclusively on barbed, but you could chain it with other devices. For example, on clubhouse, using properly placed barbed wire and reinforcements, you could completely deny dirt tunnel as long as thatcher was banned, even from a twitch due to the positioning of the electroclaw hitting both reinforcements and the barbed.
---
I mean if she kills EVERYONE with the F2 I‚Äôm not mad.

The real issue is she thinks she will.

I love this community. Gotta wade through pages of anime drawings, shitty cosplays, and low quality game clips to have real discussion. And here it is.

First the switch as a system sucks and can‚Äôt run for shit plus Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt really care about money and Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt run the sub so yeah

He forces people do do something other than point-shoot-kill, and most don't like to..think.
---
what the fuck were u doin in the killcam?
---
Mozzie?
---
He told me I should get Siege too.
---
And then 2 months in of him pressuring me to get good so we can play ranked, he's telling me to quit.
---
Basically trying to make me waste my time on trying to get good, and wasting my money. He says he can't win like he does on console (he plays PC with a controller lol), and I always say I'm garbage at the game but I still have fun, and he says that's because I don't understand the stakes yet. Whatever the hell that means.
---
It‚Äôs amazing. My brother uses it because he doesn‚Äôt have a PC, and he plays Rainbow with no latency(or anything noticeable). Only issue is just that since you‚Äôre streaming, the quality can decrease if there‚Äôs a poor connection. Rarely happens though.

That yokai drone be super chunky lol

Don‚Äôt have chrome on my phone.

I don't know about that. It takes maybe 3 bullets, then breaks. Honestly, it should at least be given 50 more hp for him to be relevant again. The amount of times I've turned on him and headshot him are ridiculous.
---
Model kinda confused me, but Cav shooting checks out.
---
#XBOTS
---
I thought that's the fun part watching pro siege? Haha.
---
Also, I assume it's now harder to attack?
---
He values individual rank too much, he thinks if you arent a winner, and don't display it, you can't have fun. If you wanna keep playing, then keep playing. If you dont wanna spend more money on him then stop. Even if he's a real life friend, if he isnt considerate to you, drop him. It's easier done than said, believe me.
---
Eh. That bandit is just dumb. Doesn't know how to bandit trick
---
the communication needed
---
My bias is for evil geniuses, but that's just cause I like them.
---
I had already planned on getting Siege before he got a PC. Having a friend who wanted me to get it just kinda sealed the deal for me on getting it. But he doesn't know that.
---
I also play so much better when I play alone or with randoms I meet in matches, because his tryhard sweaty saltiness isn't there to kill my mood to also prevent me from having fun. But again, he doesn't know this, and just thinks I'm trash all around.
---
I missed that the first time.

There is nothing we can do that's worse than what you do to yourself.
---
28 shots later
---
"You've been exposed"
---
The hero we all need
---
Theres the basic shooter stuff:
---
\- Learn to shoot for the head and get good at it
---
\- Learn the maps and how to traverse them
---
Some general advice for siege:
---
\- Use your drones as an attacker, theyre a very strong tool and if you just use your drone mid match to scout your path instead of blindly running in you will already be better than half of siege players.
---
\- As a beginner avoid guides that show you crazy angles/tricks on maps and focus on the basics, build your foundation first. 
---
\- Understand that attackers have much stronger weapons often with acog sights so as a defender you should only engage them only in confrontations that favor you, defenders have more control over your positioning so take full advantage of it.
---
And the most important tip:
---
\- Dont be toxic!
---
Most impressive
---
pro tip: Don't aim at the fucking sky, look at where their heads would be
---
There‚Äôs really no controlling it. It‚Äôs so sporadic that you can‚Äôt just pull the stick down to compensate, so I‚Äôd say just spray and pray or burst fire

yeah lesion is cool

thats why I wait until ember rise when he costs 15k renoun

They're joking you didn't do shit you got tked cos why not?

ü§°ü§°
---
No, because if it does, be sure you're gonna losem
---
Give him two and he'll be spawnpeeking as doc
---
I think it is cool
---
How much body shots for a kill? Will burst fire still be effective?
---
Not saying he can't use them, it just those attachments tho. Idk where u got that from but ok
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
Like the motion sensors on bank, they can give away your position so by allowing you to put these at your flank out of sight would be a really good gadget
---
he might, but the situation in which he would actually need it is a day darker than you or i could comprehend
---
Yes sir They ended up trying to bait me  when thatcher used his last emp thinking I didn‚Äôt know thermite had no charges left and and therm pushed me easy Pickens.
---
Can u tell me how?

But thank you dude

Ehhh, maybe.

He was clearly not a protester but ok
---
The first week of the test server over runs anything regarding the game. This sub, YouTube, twitch. And that's fine it's new and exciting shit so it should. A month later it's not.
---
in output settings, change from x.264 to nvidia nvenc or whatever else you might have there.
---
Reverse friendly fire doesnt protect you from grenades, impacts, nitro cells, and basically every explosive, but they get still get banned and/or take damage too

Cool thanks a bunch will try it when I‚Äôm on my pc next

How dare that flare is copying me

I need me some of that zap ass

Console? Otherwise just pull straight down lmao

Did you just take that from the doc cutscene

Ahhh that explains it thanks, yeh he did get kicked from the game

Np

Valk needs a tricycle

Almost got me.

Ah okay, I've played a fair amount of Apex. 5K+ on Wattson, and a few Ks on other ops. Hyped for this game!
---
Why do you need tissue if there‚Äôs toilet paper right their
---
I've said it once and I'll say it again, assists win games, and ubi is ridiculous
---
I had trouble buying r6 credits and pro-league skins because my game wouldn't communicate with the steam store through the in-game shop so I sent a message to Ubisoft support and their fix worked for me:
---
Refreshing your Steam files can resolve many issues that can be encountered in the Steam application, store or games. Performing this operation will ensure that there are no issues that could be resolved with a new installation of Steam, and it is a good place¬†to start any troubleshooting process.‚Äã
---
Note: This process will not affect your currently installed games.
---
1. Completely exit the Steam client.
---
2. Open the run dialogue by pressing Windows key + R. You can also navigate here from the start menu by typing run.
---
3. Type steam://flushconfig¬†and press Enter. If asked to allow this website to open a program, please click Allow or OK.
---
4. Restart your computer.
---
5. Now launch Steam directly from the installation folder, not from a pre-existing shortcut (~C:\program files (x86)\Steam).
---
-The Steam application will either appear as Steam or Steam.exe depending on whether your settings show file extensions.
---
Yep
---
Nokk with acog is too op,she just can't have it.
---
You should try and get a squad as soon as possible as it makes the game both more enjoyable and rewarding imo. Whilst learning the basics I also recommend you get into the habit of learning callouts (it will take time but you will get there eventually) To help with this, below the compass which is at the bottom if your screen has the names of each room you‚Äôre currently in so that goes along way. The game is Frau striating at times but I urge you to  stick through the hard times at the beginning.
---
They need to bring back the old fire rate.
---
Ah so it‚Äôs the all out balls out strat. In it to win it.
---
Was very confused how this clip was possible! Thanks for the explanation!
---
Here are some videos from RussianBadger that he made. He reviews operators 90% of the time so here are some for Sledge, Monty and Doc. I watch these alot and it helps with other ops as well. 
---

They moved the champion rank to 2500 mmr to test its functions, now they moved it back to 5000+.

Yikes. All that carrying my team and nothing to show for it

Cas or ranked?

This is... Pointless?

I don't see anything to answer to create a discussion, either some questions on what people think, we all got to the conclusion that they can use weapons, and we all started liking the recycled one, what now?

---
The sad thing is that you Are probably better then me....
---
Except there are times where Ubisoft not putting in content has hurt them when they were otherwise seeing good increases in the amount of players. 
---
There is a balance between what you seem to perceive as "profit" and content because putting in more content can easily be profitable. Remember how many people flocked to R6 due to the outbreak mode?
---
I like the idea but I doubt ubi would remove his turret
---
I'm excited for Warden.
---
Can you post the link?:)
---
Only last alive can kill, if she downs second to last op, the last couldn‚Äôt do anything until the bleeder dies, no?
---
Okay ty
---
This is pretty amazing...in a way
---
F2s strong sure but with acog it has decent recoil and her ability is one of the worst attacking abilities so she needs that gun
---
I think Nokk is very weak in the matchmaking enviroment where everything is facechecked and map control and droning are foreign concepts. But in actual competitive play where a lot is determined with intel and intel ops dominate the meta (echo, maestro, mira, valkyrie, lesion etc) she could be a handy pick in some scenarios. I think the devteam is afraid she would be too strong in that setting, rather than in matchmaking. They don't want another Lion situation on their hands, which i completely agree on with them.
---
In a game where you aim to have a hundred different operators with unique gadgets and abilities, loadouts and so on, some are bound to be weaker than others. And in my opinion that's ok. Just like tachanka, some operators are just extremely situational and there's gonna be a better pick 99% of the time.
---
This would actually be really cool
---
I mean, he wasn't that good either.
---
they‚Äôll have hearts and minds they‚Äôll just be splattered all over the walls
---
Chibi is on the cute side, Funkos are just an American abomination made to barely resemble a chibi.
---
this is literally me when I play with friends. I play amazing on my own, then I join my friends and stuff like this happens
---
I dont know who the original creator is.. 
---
It was poted on an ig account who reposts memes all the time
---
Anything that‚Äôs not throwing is unacceptable in cas /s
---
They had us in the first half, ain't gonna lie
---
I still think kapkan is in a good spot rn, he was my first operator too. The only thing with the insta kill traps was that they had a big ass laser going across the door
---
How do you get them? Do you have to pay with r6 credits?
---
First of all, great opperator picks.
---
Start by looking at some beginner tips on yt.
---
For a second I thought I was in the clip because I‚Äôm level 298 and every season EZ copper 4
---
I mean look for the original artist . it wont take much of your time . Because this reddit is against reposting stuff without crediting the original poster
---

---
REEEEEE

hes a god
---
That was almost too perfect timing
---
Yeah I'll just look up "Fuze hostage meme", that'll get it
---
Playing Casual, you will run into toxic players. Learn to roll with the punches. Avoid saying super terrible stuff in chat or voice chat. Report toxic players. Leave matches when you get team killed 100% on purpose.
---
When you reach level 30, you can play Ranked. It's a lot more strict, but as long as you play by the rules, it is generally a lot less toxic. So that's gonna be up to you if you wanna switch over to that or not. 
---
Lastly, sticking to operators you know is good, but don't forget to try out new ones. There's a whole bunch of them in the game.
---
Just click on their heads lmao ü§£ü§£ /s
---
It- It- it‚Äôs beautiful...
---
This made me all fuzzy and warm inside
---
So what I'm getting from all of this is that that guy sucks at recoil control?
---
Yeah, it's quite common to do so. Often, teams place shields or barricade the doors near the drone hole to shield Bandit from Zofias stun. Sometimes, defending teammate might stand near the drone hole just to trigger early detonation of Zofias stun grenade so it doesn't even reach Bandit. There are a lot of ways to deny Bandit tricking
---
Probably really tattered clothes, and cracked parts too. The colour scheme would also be black white and yellow, kind of like an uglier and far more degraded version of the pl sets. Could even add some scars to their body if wanted.
---
Lesion would NOT be Captain Cargo Shorts tho. They are too important for any harm to befall them
---
Buck, the most fun op. Has nades, shotgun, great gun. Just a great operator
---
Mayyyybe he played alot the first 2 years then took a year off and this is him coming back? That's what imma say for the sake of my sanity
---
get this guy b&amp;
---
i think r6 dev teams must not replace guns for nokk and warden, but add new (or reuse SD and p90). FMG is nice choise with nice RPM and recoil.
---
As my aim is trash i would need these 3 bullets
---
&gt;It looks sick af yeet
---
Fuck you
---
They're alright
---
Mad respect to the man who blew up himself to keep the streak going.
---
Lol 3 
---
I am reloading after 1 bullet is missing when I shoot the cam at  spawn
---
That laugh lmaoo
---
I try to use burst mode on distance.

Reading comprehension. Unranked Casual is a thing, I'm not CALLING you a casual.
---
Are you seriousü§îü§îü§î
---
Bruh first time I heard this line was tonight and it‚Äôs 100% applicable. Pitter patter!
---
I‚Äôm like 31.4% sure that‚Äôs me, was it in a vanilla cup a few weeks ago?
---
Anything is better than the kangaroos
---
When is the update? Some people comment 10 am
---
Doesn't tachanka literally means "Turret".
---
I would keep him the way he is, probably changing the way how the turret works..
---
Giving him as main weapon an LMG and 4 Turret stands where he can quick attach the LMG for heavy recoil reduction.
---
Giving him suitable movability, an LMG as defender which is compareable to maestro, with the side effect of just 4 places he could greet you. 
---
As well as you could change the scope to whatever you want. 
---
Tachanka + ACOQ = evil
---
Ships this is tts so the update isn‚Äôt coming today?
---
haha no steal thanks
---
Yeah it's nice I guess
---
Arg. I've given this spiel in other comments on this subreddit. I'll do it again here. 
---
I get that this guy is probably twelve or joking. But man I hate folks who genuinely think you gotta be the most vanilla in casual. For me, personally, the only different is to chill and hang out with friends. It could me catching up during the week or workshopping new plays out. The only difference is that we aren't playing for the W - that's ranked.
---
Cause if we follow the logic of that dude, then how far is too far?
---
Oh it's casual, how dare you use gadgets.
---
Oh it's casual, how dare you use your operator's special.
---
Oh it's casual, how dare you crouch walk.
---
Oh it's casual, how dare you aim down sights.
---
NUG
---
Cause what I‚Äôm seeing her is that Guro whatever his name is kinda taking a very small amount of space so I guess just make him take more space?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt get ela because she‚Äôs very good when you know the maps well and same with lion who is useless unless u know what your doing or are in a coordinated team. For any new player I‚Äôd recommend Rook on defence if you want to anchor, for roaming Jager or bandit because they have solid guns + gadgets are useful in any map. On attack Id recommend hibana, thermite or twitch. Try to get cheap ops because your new as the standard ops are some of the strongest ops in the game still
---
This man says a lot of confusing great advice. On defense, Lesion has 2 great guns and a solid secondary along with a very easy/crucial gadget. On offense get Zofia. Her gun hits hard and her gadget is Ash++
---
Looks like the damn Shrek gets spooked sfm
---
are you playing on a switch?

Thanks Marie!

man i luv you üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Ubi doesnt realize even birdshot would have killed the fuck out of anyone at that range in real life. Someone needs to take these devs to a shooting range for christ sake.
---
I like these better than funkos, tbh
---
Yeah it made no sense, he just quit out of nowhere

I'm just reciprocating the initial hostility you brought on my good man. As anyone who's being accused of 'bitching around' would. Good day.

I would say he should've stated that he doesn't know who made it, but I don't see why he shouldn't repost it.
---
She specialises in using a grappling hook, it makes sense because that's the idea of her character
---
And that grappling hook can helps the team if Amaru does her job, the attackers could give her the defuser to plant, she could then use her grappling hook to go up a hatch and watch the defuser from above with her team. She could also be used to immediately enter the buildings and speed up the process of taking control of the map, I immediately think of Consulate for example, if you want to control top floor she can immediately enter admin office and hold any angles while her team enters the building
---
Fair enough, but myself i've never seen anyone excited about CA skin for JTF2 ops more, than Black Ice, that was released alongside it. 
---
But i really don't think it would be too hard for Ubi to actually make flag skins for future ops, so that's an option too.
---
I mean is this really news? They have been saying for weeks they don't have a date. Why would they push it today without telling anyone?
---
F indeed.
---
The j√§ger of posts
---
Trap ops and Monty because
---
1.trap ops will be almost always useful on any sight and fit my playstyle on defense.
---
2. Monty is a godsend with a good team that is coordinated and I refuse to play with uncoordinated teams in ranked.
---
These are for ranked in cas I will more often then not go recruit because he is fun and versatile and they never expect you to be good
---
Iraqi Suicide Bomber being taken down by an U.S Counter-Terrorist Commander (2004)
---
He tried to get in the helicopter
---
Well seeing as how that's in game content, they can't add it in now without an update.. so if the season doesn't start today they those get delayed as well with no update on it
---
Not even
---
The SASG 12 has the highest DPS in the game, if I'm not mistaken. While the ACS12 has an average DPS even for shotguns.
---
I would call lesion a skill op but I agree his guns are easy and his gadget is simple to learn
---
*and sometimes, if you want to save an life, you have to take one.*
---
That‚Äôs what I just said
---
It‚Äôll probably be a smaller update. All the teams have been promoting this date, they‚Äôd be unprofessional not to release it today
---
Bru
---
Okay first of all, give back my TV. Second of all, what?
---
Bit of a stretch dontchaa thunk?
---
Nothing really new.Drone ,learn callouts and play.In my opinion there arent other ways to really learn the game
---

why is it ‚Äúmerc.tsm gn‚Äù when geo started that

Same here, pretty bummed out

Smooth brain operator
---
I never understood why it's so hard check for spawnpeeks. Like almost every game everyone just runs in and doesn't check windows.
---
I don't believe him.
---
Find friends who play the game as if you think Monty is good now with a coordinated and close team he is an unstoppable force, except for smoke and lesion and all the other trap ops

Because I'm a TSM fan, not an EG fan
---
The Long one is actually one of the best shotguns out there.  The short barreled one on the other hand...
---
The flick comes out in terrorist hunt. So does the perfect recoil control. It almost never appears in multiplayer.
---
Agreed
---
I get the stats, but it doesnt bring utility to the team. Also you'll have to be super lucky to get in site and plant, unless you're against a bunch of coppers. The chances of that happening is very slim. Imagine as per your scenario, Amaru has the defuser, gets in site but immediately shutdown by a frost trap. Not only you've lost a player but you've also lost possession of the defuser and its retrieval will be harder. Since its on site and all the defenders will be keeping an eye on it.
---
Now, this may rival the lord, *tachanka*...

I'm also aware that is was on purpose i just feel like slapping an "h"

The AA12:

Just you, I really like them.

Aggressive atalian noises
---
My 11 y.o. brother often plays from my account, this could be the same situation
---
That would be incredibly strong
---
That's why it's a HS machine, even if you aim lower, you will end up higher because of the vertical kick. Weapon has close to zero horizontal recoil, so you literally just pull your mouse down and have a laser beam as a weapon
---
East surely?

Click about 3 heads, according to how many enemies are left

It's getting buffed thank god

u/magic4man where did you get your helmet?

It can't go to heaven if it's a Twitch drone
---
Yeah, not flowers, and not kangaroos
---
I agree. That's why I will try it out on Lion. : D   
---
I personally would never give up the F2 for any other weapon
---
It honestly looks better than the bronze and silver ones

ah, my pc broke so i went back to console, i just ran reflex because console recoil is gay aids when youre ‚Äúnew‚Äù

You can also try this..... üòÇüòÇ

you're asking the wrong question, the real one is how the fuck did he end up there ???

If you search Pilot Program 2 on YouTube and look at the end the team skins will be released today September 10th.

The irony of the smoke defusing... while in smoke... is just brilliant. Ballsy smoke play.
---
1. Use your IT12S to cut out the shape of your mira.
---
2. Reinforce the wall.
---
3. Place the Mira.
---
4. Nice clear window.

and for non Mira players
---
1. Stay away from Mira.

2. Listen for Mira trying to stop you from fucking over the POA. (Or you might get wasted)

3. STAY AWAY (please)

---
Have fun getting team killed by braindead casual plebs at the start of every attacking round. Trust me, I‚Äôve done it before and it goes just like that.
---
As a Monty main I can confirm, monty‚Äôs who go alone in ranked aren‚Äôt playing Monty correctly, but it‚Äôs also the teams responsibility not to abandon the Monty. But it‚Äôs always nice to have a Monty who can hold his own, either because he has to wait for his team to get to him, or because it‚Äôs a 1v something.
---
Is the title a reference to Silent Hill 2?
---
Maybe they are trying to figure out a way to get rid of the ddosing? :D
---
At least I hope so... as I believe that we will see more ddosers during the placement games than ever lol
---
Commit die
---
As dumb as this looks, I feel like it could work lol
---
Ahh yes 2v1 let's camp on site and not help my teammate. That's was a big brain time from Kapkan.
---
Literally the worst shotgun imo I‚Äôd literally use anything else üòÇ can‚Äôt really blame his potato on that one because he did hit shots he just would‚Äôve killed the guy with a different shotgun
---
Year 1 season 1 probably been the best
---
Twitch rivals has no clues about maintenane at all. watch it. they hold steam games when steam has their sheduled ones ALL THE TIME.
---
you can get one at grey-shop.ru
---
For anyone who saw my post, this was the one that started it all, then I drew a shitty warden, then next day, there was more, and day after, even more, so huge props to Kris to they guy that started it all
---
Playing Casual solo can be hard.... my best opinion is go Ranked .....
---
You just need to learn how it works. More work is needed than just reinforce and slap a Mira on.
---
Shhh as soon as they forget I‚Äôll pull the trigger on the hostage. Or what I like to call him acceptable casualty lmao.
---
He isn't making an impact on me emotionally or physically, but he is pretty annoying.
---
He's telling me to buy games left and right, but I'm always hesitant to because he'll just quit them in a month and then try getting me to quit too. Recently he's been begging me to preorder Modern Warfare Remastered, and he's mad that I still haven't done it.
---
1. I don't like Call of Duty.
---
2. He was raging so hard over the open beta of the game, I can foreshadow him deleting that game.
---
jokes aside the copper charm is looks cool for me sadly drunk me got bronze
---
Just RELEASE THE NEW SEASON FFS! 3 WEEKS OF TEST SERVER IS NOT ENOUGH?!
---
i personally prefer acog man with his totally cool slug gun 12

same with the current ones as well

You can repel on top of the electrical box, then carefully walk across to the wall, there you can walk up and down the wall all you want.

Can you imagine being a cunt who thinks that people who play on console don't have a computer?

There's something called "plug and play".

And there's something called "struggling with dll files, graphics card incompatibility and constant crashes."

Uh, that logic makes no sense at all. Why would you not want a test server for consoles? You can't port something over without issues period. Consoles always tend to get bugs PC doesn't have when they come out. Having a test server on console would help a lot. I tend to see people talking on consoles about bugs the PC version doesn't have with the same version.

No. TTS is an oportunity to test the game, to test content before it goes live. You are testing the content and report bugs. It's not to improve your inventory. And it's not harsh, you have the oportunity to play content before release.

Why would IQ‚Äôs LMG be better with angled grip? You should already be ADS when you‚Äôre moving anyway.

they use microsofts azure servers, thats an decision made by sony and microsoft, those are the issues. They are not secured at all and it was known for ages.
---
Besides that: Don't forget their chat service is running on the same azure crap as this game. You are getting your IP adress parsed to other players, openly, no security at all, that's why people say to never join random people, as you get ddos'd, etc.

I think we have 2 possibilities:
---
1. They are using pilot program skins and what you just said to indirectly tell us today is the release (and it will release within a couple of hours)
---
2. They're just being silent and launching it on some other random day without telling anyone in advance.

My man said house is the best map in the game

It's on par with pro league now, longer plant and disable time. (7 seconds) It's done to stop silly plays like this, while it's 'cool' 5 seconds makes both the plant execute harder, and the retake disable harder. Both require more teamwork and coordination, elevating the skill ceiling.

You can get the map without cutscenes by changing t hunt preferences to only Bartlett and only bomb defusal.

Hello RetroGaming16,
---
How soon do you think???
---
Release dates (even broad time frames) are deadlines, deadlines get missed, missed deadlines lead to disappointment, disappointment leads to public outcry...it could go on
---
I hate it, but from a business standpoint, you can't be disappointed in something that wasn't promised.
---
In really curious what games? What platform?
---
Lol, why be like this if its delayed.
---
Idk. It's all speculation at this point. Has reset hit yet for challenges? Cause reset is my guess, but I could be wrong
---
Shut your mouth.
---
Give a go at the new ember rise ones!
---
have you seen the original trailer [let me link you it](https://youtu.be/J9p3vMcPVrE?t=14) the game was way different there werent operators and gadgets and shit. it was good old rainbow six. now were all just stuck playing this till ready or not comes out
---
Hostage secured. Mission failed.
---
The opposite side is the team could all say it was intentional when it wasn‚Äôt
---
i like this idea because me and my 3 stack would never have RFF
---
Yes.
---
The Summer Bundles are removed.
---
I went through all the operators and even the single items got removed.
---
ALL seasonal BUNDLES got removed but you can still find the weapon skins and charms in the store.
---
The only seasonal BUNDLE that remained is the Phantom Sight Uniform one.
---
Three days!
---
when I first got rainbow I was coming off of a few hundred hours of csgo, so I only played recruit and sprayed people down with his ump and mp7
---
Quickest 4v1 that I have done.
---
That was the trailer, the game was never like that and the game would not be even close to what it is today if it were like the trailer.
---
I'll correct it from lobby to team, cause that's what I meant. It'd be pointless to ask the enemy.
---
thank you for the descriptive and useful reply. although i understand what you have said, and was aware of the longer defuse/plant times form the TTS. the ninja defusing still happen right? less likely sure, but still capable. if anything it would be more impressive/embarrassing when it does now right?

---
Haha yeah. This is the 2nd one I've done thinking about doing more soon!
---
I'm expecting F2 losing acog after the DMR getting buffed next season, probably mid season patch. It's just too strong a weapon, basically replaced the position of the R4-C, noobs best friend.
---
So I put together a better build using AMD parts all from PC Case Gear and a 500GB SSD as well as a 1TB HDD, and it came out to around $1200 AUD.
---
Here's the part list in the basket on the site: 
---
https://i.imgur.com/Sb7V0lZ.png
---
The R5 2600 is quite similar to the 9400, except it has double the amount of threads (12 vs 6), although the same amount of cores. The RX 580 is between the GTX 1060 and 1070 performance wise, so significantly better than 1650. The H310 motherboard they have with that PC doesn't even support PCIe 3.0, so it would bottleneck a modern GPU.
---
The only thing is it doesn't come with a Windows license, but that's easily solved, just burn Windows 10 to a USB drive (Microsoft has a tool to do this), plug it into the new PC, go through the steps and you'll just get a message to activate Windows without needing a key, then you can download a tool called "KMS38" to get rid of that message.
---
There's a lot of stuff to learn about building PCs, but it can be really rewarding knowing you built it yourself, and can therefore probably just as easily troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
---
WOW no U, thank u so much ü§óü§ó
---
If you read the latest news, they are having issues... May not be released today. That is why there are no times on the drop update for the new season....
---
I mean if your team is toxic and they all vote against you
---
Fuck me. It‚Äôs delayed then. Hopefully not more than a week.
---
I'm sorry Ubisoft, I've always loved you guys but this season's rollout has been very unpredictable and frankly not the most professional. 
---
Typically teasers start 2 weeks out, then after teasers a map trailer, an attacker teaser then a trailer and a defender reaser then a trailer. This season? Dead quiet, total radio silence until a couple of days before PL reveal then just a quick teaser image followed by a narrated gadget teaser. Felt like an afterthought.
---
Then no new season launch date. 3 week test server left people thinking maybe Monday 9/9 or maybe Tuesday 9/10. Here we are 10am on 9/10 and nobody still has any clue when this is actually going live.
---
What happened to all the communication we used to get about these things? It's disappointing to see the degradation of how a season roll out is handled from previous seasons.

Don‚Äôt u see, the plastic drone obviously had more mass and momentum than you brick of plastic explosives.

# what about THE RUSSIAN BADGER

You both literally missed each other like copper 4s.
---
In this case I‚Äôm taking about server ddossing which is when someone while defending basically  stops the entire server from moving so the defending team will win by time
---
Meaty indeed
---
How do I get the Narcoleptic Nugget charm? Will it be in the shop?
---
Play the objective and watch how others play. You'll learn a lot by simply playing the the game. This game is incredibly fluid in how rounds play out, and chasing the final two kills instead of throwing the defuser down can lead to a loss. 
---
Also, dont be afraid to play custom games alone and walk around the maps, opening stuff up, looking at camera locations, ETC.
---
I've never actually been downvoted this much please downvote me more
---
Lol imagine ddosing in casual, wtf
---
&gt;Ubisoft does nothing to ban the dossers even if you report them directly to them.
---
Do you have evidence?
---
Yeah so the P10-C is useless then.
---
SAS ? No. It‚Äôs 50 dmg.
---
Ikr
---
Ddossing is when some terrible video game player gets ur IP address and sends lots of packets to ur router causing it to shut down or freeze then u need to restart ur router or even call to change ur ip depending on what router u have. Another way is people hitting the servers where they make the whole servers ping high so no one can move and wait out the time to win. People who do this have no skill and are just insecure about there ability to highly rank, I would rather play with a copper 4 then a champion ddosser.
---
I mean I didn‚Äôt downvote u but..
---
Normal shot: Hits the target as expected
---
Silver 4 nibbas: OK BOYS IT'S REDDIT TIME
---
less maps are better imo, the crappy maps are getting taken out leaving the better more competitive ones

It would be random between the normal version and the gassed version but you can keep resetting until you get it.
---
Line m up
---
I think he‚Äôs talking about ranked. Used to be they tk you twice and get kicked and now you‚Äôre playing 5v4. Now they TK you once, stay all game and pop your mirrors, destroy your shock wires, reinforce your rotates, give armor to the other team, call out your position in all chat, grab defuser and sit in spawn, etc. etc. 
---
I see what he‚Äôs saying but I disagree that it‚Äôs worse than before. When you get someone who really wants to be a dick it drags on for longer and in ways much less possible to overcome. But it‚Äôs not like it was easy to overcome 2-3 rounds of 5v3 then the rest 5v4 either and getting these losers putting all this effort in to it is a lot less common than that was.
---
Those things are based on the throwbot 2 robot, or something similar. Drones like that weigh upwards of 4 pounds.
---
A block of c4 weighs 1.5 pounds, the phone is not even half a pound.
---
Makes sense to me.
---
You should have fuzed her
---
Don't you know the titanium plate in Gridlocks forhead? It takes at least 5 shots
---
Um, yes?  Three shots should logically be enough to kill somebody.  40 damage makes sense for what it is.
---
One of the people I used to play with became a dosser so I stopped playing with him, over a year later he is still dossing and a high diamond with no skill to play
---
What is the point of this comment
---
Its not useless its just not the preferred choice. 
---
Damage is irrelevant when theres other factors at play. You wanna buff elas RG15? It has 38 dmg
---
this idea is horrible. how would your teammates even know if it was on purpose or not. the system we have now is good, so stop trying to change it
---
Battebots s12 e 9
---
Instead of playing doc play rook. Be since your new your just going to get killed in almost every situation so you most likely not going to be able to use docs stims. With rook you put down his armor at the start of the game and thats your job dont. Doc and rook have the same guns so when you want to switch it wont be a problem
---
There is a workaround. Invite a friend and start article 5. They have to accept the invite while you are in the cut scene. As soon as they are in your squad you can skip the cut scene. There ya go article 5 with your squad
---
I wish I was silver 4. Game would be more enjoyable.

I agree, Blackbeard's shield needs other nerf, perhaps it needs only 1HP

If your willing to grind terrorist hunt then you must be one of the low iq players who doesn‚Äôt see tachanka dummy thiccc

Wait sk what your saying is that the counter that counts down to the 16th is for that?? That doesn't make sense this post was literally about how they arnt gunna say when they're releasing the season but they have a counter that says the 16th?? Like is there poor communication or somthing
---
Yeah I absolutely love it. But of course at the same time, there are obviously plenty of people who love the feel of the ones I hated so I gotta imagine they‚Äôd probably hate the feel of the Huntsman Elite. So definitely a good idea to get your hands on a few different keyboards before you buy if possible.

---
The problem is, that ubi cant do anything about it bcuz its Sony's and Microsoft's fault. Third party devices allowing them to use mnk. Third party devices translate the input from mnk into a controller input for the console. So Ubi just sees someone using a controller and cant do anything against it becuz the game gets the input from the console. ... Im on PS4 and i can tell u on our end its not better...
---
I thought bullets can go through the wooden door frames.

It‚Äôs stupid that she saw you without any bit of her being exposed though.

Lol remember when they NERFED this shotgun? Great idea ubi.
---
I mean what do you expect if you spray at your team like that?
---
I mean that list is fine and it will run siege well, however personally I would get a different PSU, something fully modular. If this is your first ever build having a fully modular PSU will save you so much headache. Look at the EVGA supernova G2 or G3.

Looks like you're using a mouse and keyboard tho

Them too

Imagine just yeeting a nitro 50 meters

It literally never happens except on accident, something happens like 1/50 games maybe.

Thus was happening for me in ps4,but I just opened one so it should be fine now
---
Her DMR is dogshit.
---
Would be pretty neat imo
---
I get that, I play 32 92 22 though. If someone were to post casual xbox clips using MnK against controller players that would probably the saddest thing possible.
---
R/everybrooklynninenineintro
---
You can report them to xbox. I've a bunch of MnK  users banned. a month later they will send you a message saying they took action. It sucks but its the only thing that can be done at the time. I say open the game up to cross platform and enable MnK on console. Make em waste their money.  Its easy to flash cheats into the hardware as well.

The shield is on Clash's back when it's inactive.

Same as yesterday ffs

just restart the game worked fine for me

ACOG is stupid on both attack and defense. It promotes passive angle holding and lowers the skill ceiling on nearly all weapons that can use it. I'm not saying that the ACOG as it currently stands is a problem-- I'm saying that the game would be better without it.
---
Think about it. Siege, while still an FPS, centers around operator utility and gadgets. Removing ACOG would result in players being less reliant on mindless peeking to gather intel and secure kills and rather move that dependency to their abilities/destruction/etc.
---
On the TTS it says 6 days till full release.
---
Usually they have a set release date in mind. However, issues uncovered in the TTS can cause them to delay the release date to give them time to try and fix it.
---
Yesterday I played a ranked match on Hereford with only 1 other person speaking English on a mic - a Monty. I picked Thermite, we won the first 3 rounds by going to a site together, him covering my plant, and camping it out.
---
Siege is so fucking easy when you play with people that coordinate!
---
They were pretty transparent when they told everybody last night dont have a release date yet.
---
Dope
---
Hell even say they can‚Äôt/ won‚Äôt do anything about it. Just let us know that you‚Äôre at least aware of what‚Äôs going on.
---
Its Casual because you cannot play secure on rank

In the cross-over event they did with ghost recon wildlands it's heavily implied that Cav is a lesbian and Twitch is her lover/girlfriend.   
---
In looking for Caviera we find a picture of her and a man in his apartment.
---
Nomad: "Could this guy be her lover? A boyfriend?"
---
Twitch: "Uh. No, she‚Äôs- let‚Äôs just say that‚Äôs impossible."  
---
Later in the mission we find Caviera interrogating a man.
---
Twitch: "I told you that we should go out more... this is not what I meant Tiana (Cav)."

It‚Äôs all very toxic but in my experience PC is a little less toxic. At the same time, I started on XBox and I already had over 1k hours on XBox(just looked that up and holy shit I can‚Äôt believe I played *that* much without getting better than I was lol) before switching to PC so obviously I wasn‚Äôt the total noob starting on PC that I was when I started on XBox. 
---
Still, even throwing out when I was new I think PC is less toxic. But saying Rainbow is less toxic on PC than XBox is kinda like saying Shaq isn‚Äôt as tall as Yao Ming. They‚Äôre still both insanely tall, and both communities are still insanely toxic.

Same on xb

Id say it‚Äôs also probable that he experienced bufferbloat, which occurs when a client is congesting the network. For example, when your phone starts backing up to the cloud, it will probably max out your upload capacity as long as the stream is ongoing. 
---
Some routers have fc_codel or smart queues or whatever they call it (NOT QoS) which gives each stream an equal share of the bandwidth. These are pricy however and usually business oriented. 
---
I got myself one on my 5/0.2mbps line and it solved my issues completely. I remained on WiFi as I had no way to get a cable across.
---
I JUST USE MONTY AND DOC
---
I called this last night. Last minute bug crunching caused this. I bet it has to do with the faces morphing on the title screen. It's a bad look when you load up the game of a new season and see a graphics bug like that.
---
yet they hyped up new Pilot Program cosmetics for 3 weeks saying they will come out today
---
Oh my god your brightness setting
---
I found pc much less toxic than ps4 but part of that might be the fact that I'm not solo queuing anymore
---
Ubisoft said 3 weeks of TTS my friend. Its already 3 weeks, so they fucked up and now are silent like a mute on shock.They even anounced the pilot program for september 10th? where is it? fucked up by their bad company management. Sry if you are upset that people complain.
---
Sept 17.  Thats what it says on tts
---
False
---
Do you know what a "restart matchmaking" is ?
---
Every operator in the game has a use and is viable. Don‚Äôt listen to people saying Kapkan isnt good, or another operator isnt. Kap gets me kills late round even in high plat. Everyone is viable, you can even use Tachanka‚Äôs turret to get an unexpected spawnpeek.
---
Everyone gets the season at the same time, there is just a 7 day period that ubi locks the operators for everyone that doesn‚Äôt own the pass.
---
Wait
---
Explosives and such still hurt teammates even with RFF.
---
i am level 201 and i didn't unlock ranked yet :(
---
But the SPSMG9 is still the best option, this doesn‚Äôt resolve the problem. 
---
Sorry but why the heck do you care about buffing the weapon when you don‚Äôt even use it ! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, communication is always nice. They probably found some horrible bug like the mid season clash/iq shitshow, dont see any other reason, tts updates seemed ok and effective.
---
Fuze with shield on Barbed wire "Uh oh"
---
Clash starts slowing him down "Oh no"
---
Smoke throws a canister at him "OH NO"
---
Finka boosts which cases him to take extra damage from smoke *"OH NO"*
---
This made me laugh in class thank you
---
Kapkan traps still put towards the end of the round are fantastic, get off your high horse saying people are ‚Äúdumb‚Äù. There is luck that goes into every trap operator. It‚Äôs not so much whether your trap will get kills and more so it‚Äôll tell you where the enemy is coming from and gives attackers yet another things to think about regardless of it kills them or not. Not to mention both his primaries are very good.
---
Don't really have an issue with alt tabbing aside from the game switching to windowed mode when alt tabbed at some times.
---
I have had thoughts of an attacker with all the secondary gadgets named Jack

I‚Äôm fine playing the game just want more than 30 points for a win i‚Äôm literally getting now whereüòÇ

and Epi confirmed that the pilot program will release at the same time as the season, so.  Should be today. Ubisoft dropping the ball with info.
---
Which was meant to be for non season pass holders

---
Guns irl are no where near as quiet as they are in games. A slight damage decrease to negate the fact that they are being generous with how well the suppressor works doesn‚Äôt bother me at all.
---
Never once did I put words in their month. For the last 2 years or so the patch always came out after 2 weeks on the test server, this has been confirmed by Ubisoft on multiple occasions. Until a few seasons ago they changed it to 3 weeks, the only exception of it not being on time is this week.
---
Well yeah, just that most people are excited about the ops and not many of the reworks so people without the season pass won't really care until a week later
---
My performance is fine, it's just that the game doesn't display properly.
---
Valkyrie not Nomad wasn't it?
---
OP asked if Kapkan is a good operator for Ranked. I am simply telling him the truth.
---
Yeah, fair enough
---
You may be right tbh. It could be so many things. All I know is. I'm excited for what this update is bringing (except battle pass but that's just me). 
---
If you see this Ubi. All we ask is just communicate a bit more. If your willing to do that than we'd be probably be more understanding to alot of things.
---
i‚Äôve been plat multiple times before i started tho. like me ddossing has nothing to do with my skill
---
Nomad is the main character in ghost recon, not the Nomad from siege
---
It wouldnt be the best option anymore, mobility would have a great impact on clash especially, it would be more of a choice between the 2 weapons. Theyre both good weapons in their own respect and now the p10 would offer a sort of advantage over the spsmg.
---
I care because i like versatility as much as the next guy but i don't want to see things get unnecessarily changed
---
 You can run but you can't hide XD.
---
\+1 This. I've been wanting this since launch. Another thing is when it reaches 0 seconds there's still some progress on the bar left. A timer would just be a lot better.
---
Aha my bad. Haven't played it since it came out.
---
Did he pick you up? Reviving teammates that the person downed (you) takes off the friendly fire.
---
Pilot program was confirmed to be released today and Epi just said on Twitter that the pilot program will be released when the new season drops. Kind of a cryptic message, so either the pilot program will be delayed along with the season or it's dropping much later today.
---
Lol trash
---
Well the US Army uses C4 because it is extremely malleable and is more effective than tnt. And yes it is a secondary explosive which means it requires high pressure and intense heat to explode. Nitroglycerin I believe only requires one or the other.
---
 Breaking your aly wasn't very challenging but I found some ways to have fun XD.
---
Yeh but we did this for fun lol
---
Apparently this is a post worthy to be removed because it might be a "bug" and should be send to R6Fix. I get the R6Fix part but not the part where it got removed.

The problem is its a game so you cant measure it,irl it makes no difference if you fire into a target with one or not,if the shoot is made it will still be lethal(lets say we are talking a 7.62)

Tts should be 2 weeks again. Waiting damn near a month after reveal kills all hype for me

You can change your keybindings. I prefer left alt for grenades, personally. And of course, have your lean on toggle.
---
Yes, you become a bot
---
If he got it from downing you, then picked you up, it removes the RFF automatically.
---
Nothing except you won‚Äôt get a seasonal ranked charm or rank.
---
That's why I was thinking it would be negligible. It's still a decent sized bullet.
---
Some serious small penis energy coming from you.

copy that
---
How does a two speed operator make a gun a better option than an other ? Sorry I just don‚Äôt see it.

Anyways, this is going into circles. You are obviously as much convinced about not changing the P10-C as I am about buffing it. 
---
Nice talk. Good day sir !
---
Thank you didn‚Äôt catch that error

When defending this side properly there "must" be someone playing stairs. Not only to stop drones like this, but also to prevent the other type of twitch main from sneaking up the stairs and shooting bandit in the head instead of the shock wire :)

It's a video game. There's nothing on the line in ranked either.

I‚Äôm not sure but it may be because they only had Recruit as an operator or they only had one or two operators and they got banned which gave them recruit?

No its not. That is from monday i think and i just go get some snack and random Pick picks me recruit

fake news

It‚Äôs coming out tomorrow mods ubi announced it on their Instagram

Been waiting for someone to say something as I thought it was just me. I constantly get lost connections in every game I have played since yesterday.

Operation tower strike
---
I was playing with 3 of my friends and we quickly learned our random was doing this crap every round. We surrendered when we finally had the option. Didn't want that clown getting any elo.
---
Imo the new ops aren't going to change anything in siege and I'm wanting to see what people have to say to try change my mind
---
gg
---
You can actually - they both have a HWID which they can block, if they werent i would be unbanned form all my games
---
So this means we have 4 weeks of TTS?
---
That's new.
---
Thats just common sense xD
---
Source? Theres no way this is real. You would have screenshot the tweet or posted a link with it.
---
I hope it is though.
---
Probably had some issues with the battlepass during the release cycle so they pushed back go-live. I doubt they delay a week.

lol glad to hear it

Neat?
---
Agreed.
---
I think a lot of the names simply get cool because we hear them so often in an admirable and positiv context. You look up to these guys (names) and they are "famous" (in the siege universe). That alone gives a lot of mojo to those names if you ask me. (Kinda like Band or Artist names)
---
Other than that, something that Sounds unique but still "simple" and precise is good i think.

Ah ok, I didn‚Äôt know what pish meant.
---
I don‚Äôt think Amaru will change much in the game, and she might be kinda situational.

Goyo on the other hand will be really game changing in higher levels. He seems fantastic for plant denial and delaying the timer and he has a great kit.

The one that used Hereford as the test base or the gameplay trailer that used House?

Lmao you're not a happy soul are ya?
---
FUCK YEAH
---
Hey! Communication! One more day isn‚Äôt that bad of a wait.
---
Nvm they just tweeted confirmed tommorow
---
Rainbow Six is sadly not the only game. GTA online get worse too with all that glitchers and what i see the last days looks like they hacked the PS4 already :/
---
If u didn‚Äôt buy the season pass I would get the new ones about to come out
---
Check their twitter. It‚Äôs tomorrow
---
First
---
Im sick of this season though Phantom Sight sucks and feels like its been going on forever, I just want Ember Rise
---
See? it was going to be today, you just had to use common sense. 11 Sept release.
---
Thank you for being honest.

Nothing really you just don‚Äôt get a rank

I reckon a battering ram type thing is used far more often than a shotgun to breach doors. It‚Äôs not always as simple as shooting a lock.
---
Was there a major glitch which they had to fix?
---
It's quite unusual to see Ubi release updates not in the expected schedule, however I'm happy to see that tomorrow is the time
---
You try to find how the fuck did he climbed up there
---
Agreed. Wish it was today, but the 11th beats the 17th. I‚Äôll take it,
---
1.I'm entitled bc I bought the freakin game,again,this is not a F2P game,this is a AAA game with multiple editions,season passes and other microtransactions...
---
2.Free DLC my ass... A lot of us have the season pass so no it's not "free". I've paid for advance for the content I'd like to use...
---
3.Maybe we wouldn't make up release dates if the company would SAY something.ANYTHING....
---
4. You can stop the white knighting,it doesn't work...
---
Gonna be honest the new ops coming out aren‚Äôt too good ability wise
---
Crazy bitch
---
but it is also an open bolt meaning there shouldn't be one in the chamber in the first place
---
Yeah good luck with that. After all the backlash they've received during Chimera and when they tried to censor the game they are now completely distancing themselves from the community ceasing all communication except pr bullshit. Speaks volumes of how little fucks they give about us if they can't be fucked to even tell everyone that they need a couple more days to get things done.
---

thats pretty nice

Been checking Twitter for the last day or so! trust as soon as I post there‚Äôs something on there üòÄ thanks mate
---
&gt;Try being a little more realistic
---
You really don't know how frequent battering Rams are used, don't you?
---
If you have a barricaded door, reinforced door (yes, these are used in high profile kidnappings), your only choices are A, breaching rounds, again loud, or B, battering Rams, loud but better as a distraction since you have enemies ready to open fire at the door but can be surprised from another entry point.
---
Also, shotguns on doors are definitely not quiet. Even one shot is audible. You might think of the MASS, but that isn't really quiet either.
---
Shitty day to release a Operation, no respect for people that lost their lives on that day.

Realizing the new season is released on 9/11...

Thats a lag switch, they can collapse the server too, or if you join their party they Ddos you specifically

if you do enjoy fast gameplay (i love it personally) maybe try a slower approach and compare it. see which one you prefer and focus on that play style. other than that you are good.

You can play Lesion effectively on any map. Mira is either really powerful on some maps or really ‚Äòmeh‚Äô on others.
---
Very interested
---
It's not just him though. Germany has a strong culture of remembrance and guilt about everything the nazi's did and it's something that will definitely come up in your every day life if you life here. That said it's not a comfortable topic to talk about as it should be, because the holocaust is nothing you should be comfortable with.
---
&gt; In theory it should be easy to protect lower ground from above, but nobody plays vertical.
---
The problem is, against a competent attacking team, is that to play a site vertically on defense leaves you open to an attacker on the 2nd floor catwalks looking through into the windows. Geisha hatch is in the open of that room and Office hatch is easily viewable by 2 windows. And all of the spots with good holes to open (like watching the closet window) are also in bad spots. Then you have floorboard beams unfortunately going in the more difficult directions in most useful places.
---
Pulse is also meh on the map because he either stands in the open to C4 a crucial room (Exhibition/Armor or Tea Room) or has to deal with the fact that some doorways between rooms are in spots that take an extra second or 2 to get around (think running between Kitchen and BBQ constantly to cover Karoake and Geisha), which can make all the difference between a kill or miss.
---
Then it has a decent retake problem. Besides the fact that the catwalk exists, leaving defenders always at a disadvantage on those fights, you have issues with Office (the 2nd best site) being shut down easily by 1 at Dragon and 1 covering Stairs, usually by someone rappelled by the window just next to it (but it can even be the same person if you breached the wall at dragon).
---
Bold of you to assume that I've ever gotten laid.
---
Fair enough, I just don't see her used enough to validate a ban tbh. You're using a ban on a character with a stupid low pick rate instead of someone like a bandit or lesion, who see a lot of play and are very strong.
---
Mav makes sense on certain maps. He completely breaks clubhouse
---
Middle train area is way too powerful, it basically gives you control over both upper floor bombsites and its very easy to hold if positioned correctly. And on the other side, if you lose train area on Defense against any well coordinated team your suddenly at a huge disadvantage and will probably lose site. The middle train area is basically just way to important for transition/breaching in ranked play, people basically defend train like a 3rd bombsite.
---
I can farm, but I don't have boosters
---
because gubisoft is a b\*tch ass
---
Engine update hopefully. Doubt it, because a lot of features hide behind "engine limitations".
---
I thought you were a new player or something, then I read the comments and seen what the confusion was about
---
They‚Äôre changing the parts that do need it, train room and gargoyle area over by the double stairs.
---

That is surprising

---
 It‚Äôs dropping hot like the World Trade Centers
---
Comes out on the saddest day
---
Did they say if they were bringing recruit back
---
&gt; and no destructible floors.
---
The floor above both bottom sites are destructible for the entire sites (except 1 bit above BBQ near the window).
---
There's barely any vertical play because no one is ever really on site anyways.
---
Pretty sure it was supposed to drop today originally because that‚Äôs when the esports skins were supposed to drop. But I guess I can wait a day
---
Why is this subs picture one character from the game
---
casual is 10 times more toxic than ranked and thats known by the whole community
---
My opinion; hostage (in PVP) should have the same amount of extraction flares (1) as it does in T-Hunt. Once the other team grabs the hostage, the round is as good as over. Once in a stark blue moon you'll be able to catch em or maybe hit a dinger, but for the most part having 3 extraction flares in one corner, 5 feet apart doesnt make it very challenging for the offensive team to get them on the ground.
---
What do you dislike most about Bank?
---
Technically all the sites are viable (though Open Area is obviously way tougher to defend).
---
idk, kinda normal when you match up with equal teams. it could be 4-0 win, 4-1, 5-4 who knows.
---
We can only hope
---
I have a good strategy I'd like to show you. Found it on here couple days ago. We can make a full squad if you'd like
---
Fuckin laser sights
---
They removed recruit, which made the update not too fun
---
I still feel like releasing "Burning Embers" on September 11th was a bit of an oversight by the marketing team...

If I turn on my Xbox will it auto update
---
No, u are a popo head https://youtu.be/bodqcJRnOsc (sorry I am a phone nerd now)
---
The patch was a day late. You guys are so spoiled.
---
Exactly why I asked here. Cheers man
---
Im surprised that Lesion didnt shoot the claymore
---
*hell yee brother*
---
this ruins my excitement, I wish I was exaggerating but yesterday 8 out of 10 lobbies got ddosed and either crashed entirely or we lost because of it (ps4/weu/plat1)
---
I get WAY more hate mail in casual than I ever do in ranked. Maybe cause I use casual to fuck around alot since that's what it is to me. Also I've noticed when I used to play in plat there was never really any toxicity, now that I've been back and I've been hovering in low elo (low-mid gold) I see some stupidness and a bunch of people leaving after getting shit on by like a run out or something.
---
If I had low health I would‚Äôve understood dying in 1 bullet
---
Delayed two days two times.
---
Apparently, trying to get people to make Ubisoft talk about it is against "the rules" of this subreddit but spamming Black Ice, 4K clutches and fanart/cosplays is totally great content that will help fix the game.
---
People need to do what the Apex Legends community did when Code Leaf was at its height. They spammed the subreddit so much about this Respawn was initially ignoring it but they couldn't forever and they finally addressed the problem and spoke to the community about it.
---
Cool thanks!
---
that green arrow is initial crosshair location, everywhere the colours are is a potential for the follow up shot to be placed
---
Makes sense why I couldn‚Äôt play lol
---
Would you rather waste a few min and keep MMR or waste a whole game with a great chance for a loss?
---
Who gets to site faster? Amaru or Ash. The ultimate question about this season.
---
Oh yes, it drops tomorrow.
---
echo and montagne are way too low
---
Sometime in order to save a life you have to take a life
---
Why‚Äôd Ela better then echo??

Hello njozwiak88, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d2gp8l/server_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So how this reads is that the shots will be heavy on the right since the "colored lines" go further and further over the center line that the green arrow is on?
---
Probably not, considering you had to pay for the packs and be lucky
---
It's messed up how Comcast is always on the enemy team.
---
you‚Äôre flair and it‚Äôs presence of jackal. what i learn from dying and losing to jackal is just to ban him every time
---
May I ask why you put echo where he is I thought he was one of the best especially on bomb.
---
They scrapped that entirely
---
Gridlock is op and she can crush your head with her thighs win win imo
---
Why do they keep taking naps out of casual??
---
Just remember, your enemies probably hate being there as much as you do.  If you murder someone in the same room more than once, call them out and declare it "Your Room".  If you kill them there again they'll tilt, if they call you out on it back congrats you're still in their head.
---
You can get some pretty funny rivalries/stories going in the chat to help pass the map.
---
thanks you surpassed my expecTations
---
That happened to me
---
Yea mines is down
---
That's all I needed to know, gridlock it is.
---
I like N√∏kk over Girdlock
---
I respect this brother. Thank you!
---
Yeet
---
DDOSing definitely does happen quite a bit on console, it's very obvious when it's a ddos, everythings fine during the prep phase, if you're attacking they'll stress the server when you spawn so you can't move and run out of time, on defence they only stress it right before/after they enter site and get a plant off then you can't defuse so you lose.
---
I've had it happen to me 4 times in the last 2 weeks and I'm only high gold/low plat, I've heard it's a lot worse at high ranks.
---
Anytime soldier
---
Still happens way more than any reasonable person should expect from a ¬£60 game made by a triple A developer with millions
---
correct, to help with that you can put on the flash hider, or if you want a mix of both helping vertical and horizontal recoil use the compensater
---
He's not a fucking hacker, he has a twitch channel and everything.
---
Huh? I‚Äôm not making a point there I‚Äôm just saying I don‚Äôt like acog and I wish they didn‚Äôt have to be in siege but they do
---
Breh have you seen the goyo and kapkan combo
---
They didn‚Äôt give a time. Just checked the website and saw it

---
I imagine it has something to do with Ela being a trademarked Ubisoft property.
---
&gt; Attackers can be straight up spawn killed at all 3 spawns
---
Ya I don't get how they haven't fixed this yet. Literally moving some of the cars around would fix this issue, plus maybe a staircase instead of a ladder at one of them. At least at the back alley spawn it should be a freebie for the attackers if a defender tries a spawn kill there because they need more time to peak the corner but alas so many people still die there.
---
And your other points are also pretty valid as well. I guess I was thinking moreso of how the map plays in pro league which none of those points play a factor for.
---
&gt; encourage stale attacker behaviour
---
This is one of the most painful things in the game. It's why I hate Glaz on Plane. Idc that he can shoot through the glass, that's easy to avoid, I care that he just sits out there for 3 minutes doing nothing most times because everyone knows now to avoid the windows.
---
And then attacker-only catwalks/balconies, skylights, etc. all cause this all the time. It's why I like that Kafe skylight is way less useful now.
---
For a game claiming openness it‚Äôs very ambiguous

So if it's a bold fuzzy green line going over the line it means it could go either right or left right? And when it's a fuzzy bold line or thin line what's that mean?
---
Someone is not very good
---
Don't worry, they'll be there next week.

Ty
---
Theres a difference between a developer working on a singular game and a developer working on many games and a difference between how long you think it takes to fix a bug compared to all of the time to even find what line of code is causing the bug or finding a solution to the bug
---
Or just baiting for the shitstorm
---
i think youd be shocked at how good she actually is
---
the more solid it is the higher chance the shot gets placed there, you'll see the DMRs have a thinner wider area
---
Lol no way
