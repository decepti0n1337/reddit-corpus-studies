That happened to me yesterday it was funny

Make what ? The picture is real
---
Everybody refers to this as Rain'B'ow6Siege
---
What a pov cunt
---
Oh I’m just quoting game of thrones😂
---
I tried to find the joystick buttons under the screen
---
How do you get the visualizer behind the vigil icon?
---
Oh boy you have no idea
---
IMHO: suppressors only for fun, it's unlikely that competitive player would fall into "where that shot came from" situation: you still can hear the shots and most of the time you would see an enemy or atleast suggest where he is.
---
Suppressor damage reduction is solid, especially in 25+ metres situation, same goes about recoil.
---
I just got headshotted through my shield
---
Not really, the AKs in game have way less recoil than the c8, but the c8 being a copy of the AR15 has a piston for making the recoil softer and the 5.56 nato has less mass than the AK, making the recoil even less of a problem.
---
That's what frost gets for playing hostage
---
You’ve got a lot resting on that next match
---
That dedication. Respectable. You either get flamed by your teammates or gassed the fck up so hard.
---
Only +10 diameter penises allowed here.
---
Interesting. I'm also left handed, in basically everything I do, including writing, sports, all that, but gaming is my only exception, I guess I grew up using my right hand to aim. Welp, if that works, good for you then.
---
When that happens I tend to get stuttering in game (but usually for bigger games like arma) hence why I swapped over. It’s smoother overall for my recording set up
---
Bitch bandits skin is baller
---
Looks like console to me. The console community has always been horrible.
---
My bad, misunderstood the question. I thought it was talking about the drive inside the PC. In that case I usually hear people calling it a USB stick.
---
Not sure honestly.
---
Or misunderstood the question. No need to be so harsh about it, fuck.
---
I’m gonna get the ice cream cone one first and then the secret star but just hoping that they release the ice cream cone skin from the start and it’s not part of some bs event packs
---
I haven't played Bartlett in forever. I'm assuming they took it out already.
---
Actual RNG makes it so you actually have to get lucky. Unlike other games I'm pretty sure this one has no bad luck protection and you can spend you're whole time never getting one.
---
If I'm not mistaken this is a bug tho
---
The person that leaves should still face an MMR loss and a temporary ban, the longer the ban gets. Of course there should be a 5-10 minute wait just incase the player is just rebooting due to a bug.
---
Yeah and you can change the buttons' roles on DS4 through Accessibility on the PS4 settings so...
---
Israel would be cool, maybeeeee Indian, the other two, not so much
---
Yeah it's a real charm. The charms are about 99% of this games cosmetic appeal but the community hates them
---
What kind of aim was that
---
have my upvote for condolences
---
Guess who got their steam account back
---
It’s still in the game just not in rotations
---
15 dollars
---
Yes but everyone appreciates it as R6 or R6S
---
Damn...
---
Those are good points, though I still think that the 1.5-2 second window where enemies don't realize where they're being shot from is incredibly important (even in higher ranks). I'd also say that if you're playing as Nøkk, your goal should be to sneak within 25-ish meters from your enemies. The damage reduction at that distance is pretty negligible, in most cases. I think your points are totally fair though, I'll have to run some tests with my buddies and see what they think.
---
Attack get in the building is the best thing you can do as an attacker don’t sit on the roof for 3 minuets. Drone before you enter. And as a Monty main it took me a really long time to get use to rifles and snags in general because I limited myself to a shield and a pistol I’m not saying don’t play shield ops because there quite fun (and frustrating at times) but don’t let them be your crutch.
---
Wtf is this
---
You only suck because you didn't play it from the start. If you played it from the start it'd be natural for you to make certain plays and setup certain strats since it'll build into you. When you're not used to something you have to think of it more, after a while you'll get better. Secure is basically TDM too, Bomb is actually more like an objective mode so be prepared to actually play the objective.

r/facepalm none of the new ops but the ausssies have come out

Actually yes

yeah, but most of them were charms or as he said, " A common disguised as a legendary "

I mean ... ... ... ... did it work? Lol
---
Honestly the only change warden needs is let him keep his ability to see through smoke while slowly moving kind of like Glaz. Just give him a bit more leeway with positioning.
---
I like the m4 and the c7e. I also think the v308 is shit
---
I think you also need to keep in mind people don't exactly play their best on casual.
---
Inb4 the buttons on the side to release the camera are fingerprint sensitive

You're right. It can slightly delay the next headshot :)

I just got back from this happening to me a minute ago I’m gold 2 now I’m trying so hard to get to plat but it’s starting to look impossible I’m probably just going to quit r6
---
I think I’m concussed
---
V308 is good, solid damage and minimal recoil; M4 has solid damage and controllable recoil with the right attachments; the C7E is a point and click adventure: borderline no recoil and quite good damage output. 
---
If I had to pick two I’d say V308 and C7E
---
You still neee to worry about front door runout, or even balcony runout, but yeah, it is pretty helpful. I've seen this posted a handful of times on this sub, and regularly do this myself, but hey, maybe a fresh face will get a quick pick and thank you, so who knows.

[Shrek voice] OH, HELLO THERE!

Ok

Which one do you think is better

Claymores are the new meta, so op now. You can throw them now

I would just try to switch up what you're doing then case they probably just saw a pattern and people are pretty good at hiding valk cams and drones. I've had so many times where I had eyes on someone and they had no idea and I had a teammate calling stuff out

Commando 9, imo

only people i see care about their ranks are coppers who always say its their alt, and gold 4's who claim they are god himself reincarnated
---
of course these arent everyone who is these ranks just the most vocal ones i have met
---
Of the C7E and the V308 I’d choose the C7E any day. Not just because of it’s better controllability and raw killing power, but also because Jackal is a more useful operator than Lion after the Lion nerf.

Literally anything where it reduces how many points you lose can and will be exploited. By the second round you can have a pretty good idea if you don't have a chance of winning. Just play with a squad and you won't have to deal with that, it's really that simple
---
jesus this subreddit is thirsty...

I dont have a single black ice in rank 100 why is this so one sided

i mean why not, i dont see an issue with  team rushing through fuze charges or smoke charges

I'm on a 960m with a i5-6300 and 16 gigs of ram but shadow play very clearly effects my fps.
---
hacking!definitely
---
Could feel the tension in that
---
Yeah but can you fix Clash though.
---
I dislike it. They could've just separated Bomb ranks from Secure ranks and everything would be fine.
---
I'm still pretty sure that removing Secure from Ranked will only be a temporary change since the playerbase will almost certainly decrease. And it's because only a little amount of people playing the game are competitive enough to enjoy Bomb.
---
Well they can. They just don't want to invest money into it. Check the hotbreach podcast with Epi about it.

V308 best gun besides the 416 c carbine

LMAO he didn’t even see you after you refused it so he probably thought it was a ghost
---
That made my day, thank you so much!!
---
You gave me no rhyme or reasoning as to how it could be exploited.
---
And no, the second round is not a good indicator for the entire match loss at all. There are 5 rounds or more depending. There is no clear way to tell a loss from round 2. That's rediculous.
---
If you have to go into a pre-made squad everything you played ranked, then that would have been a requirement from the start of the game. That's not a solution for everybody. Randoms make up most of ranked matches in general

You should always place breaching charges at the corner of hatches with your body still on the roof. If the Pulse or whoever is good at the game you might still die, but your chances of survival will increase.

Where do you people *find* these guys? Seriously everyone I play against has fucking 110% accurate echolocation. You could shit your pants when blitz spawns, and he’d know exactly which room and weapon skin you’re running.
---
?
---
Perfect description since it’s inescapable and guaranteed to kill anyone it infects.
---
true
---
The other day an airjab blew me and blitz back during a 1v1 and the man hits a random frost mat. Sometimes fate smiles upon us
---
Astro A10 seems to be alright. I got mine for $60 and they’re pretty comfortable and they sound great. Imo good budget headset.

Nope you can look at the button mapping at the bottom to see that I don't use MnK

I was 1 game away from Plat 3 last season. Went on a losing streak and ended up in silver 3 before winning another game.

"You fucking muppet" - Clash seconds before being smashed in the face by blitz.
---
Blitz should honestly be removed. He is  both the most infuriating operator to play as and against.
---
That’s soo broken
---
The trick is brother, it wouldn’t have happened if you were recording :,)

Thanks!

Lol but I'm legit a newbie, though I'm not sure if that was a compliment?
---
Never mess with fries

Sniper 90,  the nightmares
---
Has to be the fries, no doubt about it
---
I so feel this. I'm not very good, but sometimes... When all planets align, the sun shines through the window to the west and graces my skin and the enemies are just bad enough, I also do a 1v5... without recording it.
---
That's one thing I like about Xbox. If this happens, you have the option to capture the last 5 minutes of gameplay.
---
Looks dope
---
That's equivalent to like.. a desktop 760 or so.
---
but the enemy blitz is like ash.
---
Damn really gonna forget Renaissance like that, that’s cold.
---
Yeah it's time to upgrade. I'm poor though so its gonna take some time haha
---
Yeah I love me some shotgun Clash.
---
You do. Certain games don't require it, but Rainbow does.

I’d take it as a compliment. It’s like being called a hacker

Repost

552- consistent, angled grip, good for rushes and balanced gameplay.
---
AUG- faster against 1 and 2 armours, slower against 3. Not good for rushes, but for support. Good for an iq that assists in roam clear and roam hunt, but not so good agansg anchors.
---
G8a1- crazy against 1 and 2 armours, *might* get you killed against 3, but the stupidly slow ads time will get you killed for sure. For dedicated support roles only.
---
Take your pick.

Started this january, 400 hrs in already!

Tried it with the holo i did pretty good thanks :D!

Please don't attack me but I don't understand how you can get upset at this: I'm told to kill myself at least 20 times a day, that my mother will be killed or raped or even some other racist comments.

And it's trash, cause all legendarys are crap
---
Well said, but unfortunately Ubisoft never thought this part through when designing their game. Now this stupid mechanic is in the game and all the kids that play this game that can't get kills the hard way want it to stay.
---
Literally every person I've debated this topic with too couldn't even give a coherent counter-argument showing that one shot headshots don't favor luck over skill.
---
It's blatantly obvious that it does, which is the exact reason why most FPS games out there don't have this mechanic. One shot headshots are restricted to more difficult weapons to use like snipers.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ozrVQRf.jpg
---
I agree, it's dumb. You can try asking Ubisoft support to see if it's for sure removed, or if it's just really hard to find.
---
My latest legendary is a baby angle charm....
---
Thanks man
---
Bruh. No Bartlett is spawn peak central keep that shit out of Siege.
---
Because console players have statistically worse aim, and yes my aims lackluster; but I can assure you I'm not as bad as you seem to think
---
My first legendary was the pink universal skin. I felt so lucky until i got my second legandary wich also was the pink universal skin.
---
not all of them, some of them are really good
---
To be fair though I can't think of a single op that isn't very good when a highly skilled players use them. Sure, some may have a higher skill cap like cav, but I can't think of any ops that don't get better with skill.
---
That's because Sony and Microsoft allowed them to have crossplay
---
Saying that as if Siege was mindless TDM
---
Contact support.
---
One shot headshots support luck over skill, there's literally no logic you can bring to disprove that. If there wasn't a one shot headshot mechanic, then the winner of every gunfight is the one who can consistently put more bullets into the other person.

Idk how operators can shrink to that tiny pieces when hinding in some god knows where spots

On what basis do you judge the 'coolness'. I named these nations because they have huge populations and a strong military.
---
An ash that drones? 
---
Pfft you expect too much out of most Ash players but yeah  I would agree

I don’t know. I’ll check but I do ordinarily see my kill feed when I skip the replay.

Lol thanks ubisoft

Ok then.

Best of lucks.

Most legendarys aren't as good as most other skins. Legendary skins are good, and I pike getting them, but compared to other skins, they're not AS good.

Those headshots were superb and that was well played.

In T-hunt you have a resupply box that also gives you secondary gadget ammo. I once was frost with barbed wire and I legit took all the time to completely barb it off. The frost mats weren’t visible at all.

Do you call it a FLASH drive because you keep Blitz's clips in it??

No it couldn't work, the main problem is there's only one door entrance in the entire map and there's not even any external walls to breach. It's terrible for PvP.
---
Thank you!

It's the socks that matter 👀
---
I also think it would be more profitable to just go to "R6 siege 2" and have a more stable system designed for Siege rather than Assassin's Creed.  But what do I know?  I have no idea if that's a hurdle or not.
---
Get Flanked brought up some really good points about how a 2 would probably go.  Old ops have core concepts for Siege, so it would be necessary to bring them back over time, or at least their gadgets.  Great watch, go check it out on his YouTube.

When someone gets the final kill they always do some random stuff like run out the closest window. I just find it funny that it’s just so common idk man lol

Like I just saw a clip that shows a computer guy getting TKD for stealing a supposed ace kill in a 2v1

She’s actually not that bad, it’s hilarious clutching rounds with her too

Different forums, reddit posts and such, but I've also seen other people say that it fucks with their performance if it's on.
---
Half of apps are gonna stop working
---
Trying to stop an argument is dense? What am i, supposed to continue?
---
Yeah let’s punish players for strategically playing the game
---
How do you want to play?
---
The usual 50x multiplier is right out. That shit was fucked.
---
A meager 1.5x multiplier though would be fucking sweet as. It sucks that you get penalised for shooting at the head with a shotgun because smaller target = less pellets landing.
---
The biggest weakness shotguns have is enemies peeking over objects or through windows where only the head is visible, it's basically impossible to one shot someone with just their head visible with a shotgun right now. No reason a 9mm pistol should 1shot headshot at 50 meters through a sheet metal wall while 3 pellets to the domepiece cant down someone at 5.
---
I've been experiencing that a lot
---
All the time
---
Lmao
---
How much is 1200?
---
I KNOW RIGHT
---
And also, expressing an opinion is emotional? Jeez, thanks for the advice kind redditor.
---
How many dollars?
---
Fairly aggressive maybe?
---
It’s hard to say really so much has changed.
---

---
The Mickey... mouse...
---
no matter what operators are. it always happens on ubi
---
Maybe
---
Literally guaranteed
---
Agree.
---
It is a slug. And the pump shotguns are all really good because they are the slowest fire rate in the game so if you miss you're fucked
---
Why would you want a completely blank subreddit icon?
---
Operation fooking laser soights
---
Me too, but we must move on.. he’s gone..
---
I could actually see that as a thing for one of the two Latin American ops coming season 3.
---
Oof indeed
---
is there a chance of you doing this for outback, fortress, chalet, sky, kafe, hereford and theme park given they’re staying in ranked?
---
yes the do fire slugs, the other shotguns however all have wildly varying damages which makes some seem stronger than other yet they all have the same shitty spread
---
Nomad
---
Yeah lol, Ik, I didn't think that this would get more than 5 upvotes
---
Tuxbird lol
---
Im actually from Hereford, and the new map is by far ny keast favourite 😭
---
This is my 1st legendary. 2nd Good Night-charm. 3rd one- 54th light ( Jackal's ar)
---
i got the exact same shit a couple days ago, kinda tilted me a little.
---
I thank you for give good content
---
Why did your Operator get nerfed again? Imo glaz was underpowered if anything
---
I think you got shotgunned.
---
this is lowkey my favorite charm tho
---
Maybe Nomad or Gridlock so you can rush and while slowing roamers. I always find Finka a good rusher with the health boost.
---
About 18$ or so
---
I love the Alibi one
---
Sorry for the late reply but I was told that her running sounds is same as the other 2 speed operators even with her stealth on.
---
I once startes matchmaking in ranked, but cancelled before i found a match because i had to to something. When i got back i had grotten a abandon penalty.
---
Best Ninja Defuse
---
LITERALLY JUST VIGIL+CAV
---
And btw why in the green fk is he riding his bike to the top of a skyscraper just to show off?
---
I'm level 119 and just got my first black ice today for the p90
---
Wow the new CoD looks interesting, Glad that they're bringing back the Commando perk :p
---
Why the fuck is this useful?
---
yeah i agree it
---
They would disable any operator or gadget if there was a game breaking glitch with them and they couldn't fix it in and a week. How hard is it to get your head around that?
---
VIRGIN COSPLAY
---
I don't have all the ops so I'll happily pick up those 5k renown
---
Sure buddy, whatever. If i say something some kid'll say i started this lol.
---
You are god damn right
---
this was the first legendary i ever got and now he's my lucky doge
---
https://discord.gg/NM7QfEY
---
So then it won't come back m9
---
First of all, there is a difference between spawnkill and spawnpeek; Spawnkill is litterally the act of being killed without the possibility to press any button or do something to avoid that except changing spawn, just like the last video of CoconutBrah where he spawnkill on Christmas market from Piano in the new Kafè, Spawnpeek is just waiting on the window/door until an attacker run out of the spawn without checking the common spot, So Spawnkill is wrong because there is no way to counter it, spawnpeek is a game mechanic that you can counter just leaving a drone outside the building near the area where you spawn or just inside the building watching the usual spot
---
Duplicate legendary is basically a reroll + ~800 renown. Personally, id rather get a dupe legendary than pretty much any of the common items.
---
You're getting so heated over an operator being removed that you're going out of your way to insult people to who disagree with you
---
Dont give up so easily
---
Your spread shouldnt be tied to whether youre ads, running or standing. Thats bs and alzy balancing.
---
as an avid shotgun player yacht must stay in the game
---
YouTube.com/VPhantom I hope you enjoy!
---
I don’t see anything
---
Also if you're at the max MMR you've ever been for the season, you get 1 point.
---
When  they open the game and see a character they play has a new skin
---
Nah, here’s a better one.
---
Nothing. Absolute white emptiness 
---
(Because Nøkk has the ability to go invisible)
---
Yes that’s fair. But sledge shouldn’t be able to get just outside of site by the time you’ve placed everything..
---
I almost thought this was a trashcan from the thumbnail.
---
are they global?
---
What bugs are in the game now?
---
Even a copper would understand the fact that you can't use a new op, or an op that you've never used before, blindly. Practice with her or him, do some research, watch some gameplay. Blindly playing with someone you haven't before is just stupid. Plain and simple. And yes, I will ridicule anyone who does that..
---
No problem for me Xbox UK. I can almost always get a game in under a minute at pretty much any time of day.
---
Its the bottom floor of tower
---
Definitely not dead
---
XD
---
maybe a Yobe?
---
I have the Elite and this skin.
---
she’s a 1 speed though, better off picking literally any one else to rush with
---
You practice by taking OPs into Casual play. Terrorist Hunt is garbage for this. And blindly playing anyone isn’t bad. I got into the habit of random picking both spawn locations and ops, unless we need a specific one, and learned some neat tricks I wouldn’t have if I didn’t random pick. This kind of elitist behavior is just what drives people to quit the game. It’s not about how you feel, it’s about learning the game. You started off just like any other person. If anything, I’ll show a Plat friend, near level 380 or so (forget), about this, and I guarantee you he thinks the same as I do.
---
colorblind stuff doesn't help very much in a lot of games
---
That’s why we have two drones
---
Pros use this strat all the time
---
“Hahaha! Got his ass!”
---
*Twitch taser shot sounds*
---
“Huh? The fuck?”
---
*Cav turns*
---
“Oh shit.”
---
*shoots again and kills them, drone does at the same time*
---
Best story 10/10
---
Put it on hatches
---
Oh. 
---
Do they have to be reinforced hatches?
---
It scales for repeat offenders. That was my first ever offense and I got DDOSed
---
Of course your friend is gonna agree with YOU. Dont even bother, but I understand the small mindset some people have at the game. It's what separates the good from the bad. That's how it always will be. And you seriously think me calling someone a noob, who is indeed a noob, is the problem? The only problems with this game are team killers and glitchers/hackers.
---
Yea
---
I really love the icon! Thanks for sharing it with us
---
Not according to ESL and Ubisoft Nordic admins
---
Wut
---
Ahh 
---
Does he only get 2 of them or 3?
---
I dont see any icon here
---
YoU ArE JuSt JeAlOuS gEd GuD
---
oh cr*p ur right you shouldn't upvote on the s*x ($-3-x) number 😳🙊💋
---
The satire holy shit
---
Yeah its time for the a new icon even tho alibi was pretty good... but it needs a little bit more glitch effects or whatever they are called.
---
Try again, try find some evidence that actually disrupts my point instead of using evidence and then saying it’s inaccurate
---
Photomosh
---
Nobody ever talked about the fact that castle is an inside man for the fuze on the other team.
---
I have. You not being able to understand that is your problem.
---
Well... Just like the enemy after Echo's *ultrasonic burst*
---
They're as easy to be shot as fish in a barrel or kids in an american highschool.
---
Yesterday I was playing and me and a friend were dancing with a Valkyrie and some ass hat came over and killed both drones.
---
Ah yes, when you lose an argument just insult your opponent well done.
---
Cool body
---
Why did you choose to cosplay as Maverick
---
You need to have made an argument for any of that to be the case.
---
Want to complain about the mere existence of bugs again?
---
Nope. Diamond is now purple and plat is blue
---
Shields are super deplorable. So deplorable they banned it.
---
What was the map? Im really new to the game
---
Would have likely been a much more complicated change.
---
Want to use evidence and then later dispute its accuracy again?
---
"Nøkk" is an abbreviation of "Nøkken" a scandinavian myth creature living in lakes and creeks. Nøkken would disguise itself as any creature or man it saw fit, luring people to their deaths by drowning them.
---
To be fair its your fault if they got your ip adress 🤔
---
Why the fuck do they keep limiting our options in ranked? Just make an MLG playlist and let everyone else play ranked with all maps and game modes. Also why rework Kafe before maps like Plane, House, or Favela??
---
Do you play on pc or consul because on pc this never happens to me and i always use blitz
---
It’s pretty weird. They retextured the plat symbol to be blue like the current diamond color, and the diamond symbol is now that purply one you see in the image above. Personally, I’m not a fan, but a lot are.
---
Lmfao they judging
---
Id rather have Warden
---
Shadowplay(?)
---
Or Pakistanis🤷🏽‍♀️
---
I don’t get it
---
New Op. leak?  
---
Especial ability: He has long hair and a bag.
---
lol

Best comment right here

Or anyone who knows Hindi XD
---
This guy knows it
---
Skyrim👏intro👏doesn't 👏fade👏from👏white👏
---
You need more than two glitches
---
I could record one and send it to you
---
Not completely, she's just a lot quieter. You can still hear her if you're listening for it.
---
Yeah
---
Would a teamkill be justified?
---
I thought I was the only one!
---
This wouldn't work though and must be more complex. Play escape from tarkov they have such a mechanic paired with caliber based damage and penetration
---
they said she had a AR with an acog, then they removed it and she was still to strong so they gave her the current smg.
---
I’ve been doing the same trying to make keychains and this looks really nice!
---
If I’m ever a roamer and a drone sees me, I’ll do the dance of friendship until the prep phase ends so then I can shoot them. It feels like a betrayal every time, but I need to help my team.
---
[Linking their twitter](https://twitter.com/emwhyt) would have been great.
---
Also, they specify in their bio that they don't want their art to be reposted. Did you ask beforehand ?
---
You get downvotes while pink pyjamas and mvp dances get upvotes. Sad times for r6.
---
This is now this sub’s replacement for SMH
---
mid season event probably :/
---
Who’s favourite op is Alibi?
---
We already have a guy in cargo shorts so why not
---
Not more augs 😩
---
I’m on PC and it’s always a 50% chance that my shield doesn’t work properly
---
The scream Jäger makes before dying...
---
Mine 😎
---
This is literally a repost you hypocrite
---
I lol'd

Love it :)

This clip also seems to be an example of what I was talking about here:  [Player model not looking where it should be looking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bt7dra/i_have_a_good_feeling_i_made_some_people_rage/eouqxqd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  unless you want to believe that that IQ was actually ADSed examining the texture of the wall:   [https://i.imgur.com/5x1oZW7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5x1oZW7.jpg)

I love this man, need more

Thank you! :)

Potato aim
---
Good
---
Piss poor aim

Thanks and good luck!
---
Nevermind i see its next seasons seasonal camo
---
This is nearly the same as TF2's Hoovy Rule.
---
Correct, they have that skin in the game too
---
And what did you get banned for?
---
Why would I need to delete the comment? I just explained how you should write the sentence, since the comment made you look like a 14-16 y/o with all the "xD" and not succeeding on making a point.
---
I feel like there should be another bracket, idk what the name would be, but between bronze and silver.
---
It’s been that long without a fix? Damn
---
I FUCKING NEW IT
---
Lols like Bandit has been doing some of those drugs again
---
🤣
---
What happened to E?
---
I’m not sure you can change the upload/download speeds, typically that’s determined by your internet provider &amp; package you pay for.
---
Play glaz
---
Don't even try to justify him any higher than F tier
---
He needs a semi-auto rifle and the ability to say "remember lads, subscribe to pewdiepie"
---
Mr hummes
---
R6Tab had a "purple diamond" rank in its list for all people with 5000 mmr
---
No I think it’s Vigil
---
Darn, I actually liked the teal color.
---
Not enough to justify an E tier
---
I think it’s Vigil
---
On ps4 i switched the buttons from R2 to R1 and L2 to L1 ull have similar results without effort

I dont think there's anything against it? People are looking for teammates all the time so how is discord any different

But cloudnt u use a mirar?
---
Looks like a Ghost Recon headgear.
---
Man I know each spawnkill common locations on all maps. It's just that they have better positioning most of the time.

---
Yeah imo the 416, p90 and sasg
---
No, it’s unbalanced. There’s no reason a level 50 unranked should be in a game with a level 300 diamond
---
Then it may just be a matter of physics.
---
When you go to the tab that has the options section / return to menu you will see data center : {here} 
---
I will most likely guess you connect to west europe since there currently are no SA servers, which of course will change in the near future as Microsoft Azure have now deployed servers for your region.

Sad to see joonas go buy new blood is good

Yes yes yes yes

Don't worry. Looks like no one is using it at the moment.

You need to download drivers from Microsoft
---
My line is symmetrical. The download speed is in the region of the line’s capability. The upload speed is around 10-20% of my line’s capability.
---
Yesterday my friend accidentally teamkilled trying to shoot a drone and the guy he killed sent him a message saying it was his own fault for getting in front of him. My friend Frye’s to take the blame but the random wouldn’t allow. And now we made a new friend
---
I mean there’s really not a whole lot to “argue”. 
---
If you aren’t aware of your surrounds and at this point the “common” spawn peeks, then I don’t see an issue with spawn peeking. Check corners, check barricades, take the safe route, instead of just blind running to the closest door.
---
If you are for sure about to lose, surrender so the Leision gets banned for 30 mins. Make sure to surrender after ha leaves
---
Depending on who you have, I'm not sure on that but Vigil is a great aggressive defensive OP and Buck/Jackal/Hibana are all great
---
Ok, thanks! I'll remember that!
---
Seriously! Ever second game I’m playing against plats and diamonds and my team in silver at best
---
A communicative 5 stack, some patience, and the ability to accept losses (even bullshit ones like glitches, M&amp;K users on Console, etc.), adapt, persevere from it helps to get you there.
---
Why thank u
---
Xbox controller hooked up with the USB cable or wired. I never ecperience input lag when using a controller on PC, this could be an issue with your drivers not being fully updated, faulty controller or cable.
---
West Europe is the one. I’ve changed DNS settings and all the jazz. Snake oil.
---
Hahaha true
---
Happy cake day
---
I was afraid that this was the case.
---
Are you paying for symmetrical speeds ?
---
This takes me back to the beginning of the sub reddit
---
Oh definitely and to good effect too! However, this allows for some flexibility on maps where Mira isn’t strong. Also,  bans are coming to ranked next season and I’m sure Mira will get banned on maps that she’s big on (Bank, Oregon, etc).
---
Breakpoint can't come soon enough!
---
Np glad u found it
---
That would make a lot of sense. I do need to update my drivers 😅. Thanks!
---
Wired could help if it’s not already
---
Idk I get some bullshit kills with the m762 like I put two rounds into this window and headshotted jager
---
Considering it was changed specifically for the Italians and has remained that way even though they aren't the face of the game.
---
Oh, I’ve been stuck at gold 1-2 pretty much the entire time I’ve played R6
---
Thank you
---
Reddit on mobile yea board is such a pleasant experience. *maining
---
Indeed. Indeed I am. xD
---
Yes.
---
It’s called the infiltrator it’s a pretty great flic
---
Your ping will remain at that rate simply due to the distance between you and the server. 
---
No amount of DNS, router or port forwarding changes will reduce it unfortunately.
---
Morrowind reference detected.
---
The community did some serious great suggestions on an elite skin for smoke, for example the famous plague doctor skin. The skin that got leaked has not one creative aspect to it, most people think that it looks like a generic teenager in a gasmask.
---
Np
---
For meme tier list, at least.
---
This is why the change to DbnO are dumb.
---
&gt;I think it would be fair if you could only rejoin a ranked game if you've been disconnected for ping or something like that, anyone else got thoughts on this?
---
That just isn't workable.
---
Nitro needs to be nerfed
---
Definitely not shit.
---
Hole up...
---
You said that on a weekend, you spent precious time going through video recordings of some game you played in the past? And then you took the time to create this post to share it with other people who spend all day playing video games?
---
How is one so motivated? That is a lot of investment in internet karma.
---
You referring to the 20 hp?
---
No.
---
The umbrella should be able to take 5 decent caliber shots, and can see through smoke and detect vital signs. It should have a long sheathe/unsheathe time
---
Is that not what we want?
---
This is exactly the scene I thought of when I saw the character reveal
---
Why should I? I just keep playing the Operators I usually play, additionally there are a whole lot of common and uncommon skins that are way better looking than most epic and legendaries.
---
Personally I think it fits his personality.  He has no concern for his personal safety and this gas as we've seen from experience hurts/kills anyone inside of it.  Reading up on the bios of operators gives a decent idea on what an elite could be for someone.  I like it just because it fits that aspect of he doesn't give a rats ass about his personal safety
---
She was banned almost 2 weeks ago because people were exploiting a bug where she could aim and shoot with her shield up.
---
Ghost Recon Wildlands
---
Oh nice
---
i
---
I thought it would only put it on the P12 cos if you have for exsample the Bundeswehr skin for P12 you can equip it for all the P12's like Bandit, Jäger, IQ and Blitz. So I thought that would happen
---
For real, people ask the same questions like every hour
---
You know my problem isn't really what rooms I'm calling out. I pretty much know the rooms, though I certainly still could better my knowledge, it's just the people don't listen. Though I will try to use those advices, thank you.
---
Interface preferences in the options menu
---
Nice! For one week, that’s way better than a lot of people ive run into who have been playing for a lot longer than that
---
ahhhh ok thanks
---
Is that Bartlett University? That cant be
---
I agree, its also really cool to see something different unlike the ww2 esc elites we’ve been getting, thats part of the reason i love bandit and iq’s elites
---
He was already bullied by his mates and you pushed him down the cliff.... gj lol
---
No suppressors are godlike what are you talking about
---
Not for long
---
Okay? Pls don't.
---
It got nerfed not buffed
---
nah im pretty sure they are doing away with historic uniforms entirely and just doing whatever they feel looks cool
---
If you have decent internet, just run siege on GeForce now
---
Two weeks before everyone else
---
I like the smoke elite
---
It’s to match the back story
---
Oh shit I think I took a pic with you guys next to the tofus!
---
Ho? Then you come and Hammer as close as you like
---
I had an ela interact with my drone during the attacking phase so I lead her all the way back to me. We ended up tea-bagging into the objective with the rest of her team and the round ended in a draw I believe,
---
Please no
---
50 on all of them, consistent plat player every season, lvl 163
---
Yeah the ww2 themed ones were alright for a little bit but after a while they got old fast. Blackbeard had a good one cause it went with the history of his ctu, Bandit is a great lore elite as well as IQ with her workout gear.  I'm hoping they can do more lore based elites instead of the ww2 related ones cause it's better to see something different than a trench medic or something
---
why dont you watch spectate your team mates instead of spectating the drone?
---
This happens me all the time.
---
YOU GOT THAT
---
Yes I have been thinking this since they made elite skins
---
&gt; Diffuser down and all attackers are dead
---
This is why.
---
Don’t you mean one week? When the season launches we get exclusive access for a week
---
Explain to me how a two shot weapon that now can down people in two shots at longer distances is nerfed with this
---
Damn never really thought about it but New Hereford *really* is in the past. I wonder what map takes place in Siege’s future. Probably fucking House. Too high tech for the world we know.
---
cause that would obviously be insanely unfair. You could just tell your team mates exactly where each defender is
---
“One more game”
---
June 11, plebs like me on June 18.
---
Oh whoops I thought it was two.
---
Thanks for correcting me.
---
That’s so weird I just came off insta and saw this again awesome !!!
---
not very good tier list.
---
Well I was aiming right at em and if that’s the case it needs a accuracy buff
---
I’m unsure why he dropped his shield at all though. Just wait until you start with the defuse.
---
You can say fetish, wtf?
---
Crii thought it was tomorrow
---
Your boyfriend is a jerk
---
Hey I have ~105 through pure wins.
---
Didn’t even get hit.
---
Poor smonk:(
---
Okay let me explain what I’m saying again I guess. 
---
You’re on the attacking team...
---
You plant the defuser...
---
Your entire team then dies....
---
Why can’t we then spectate the defenders as they try to find the Defuser to disable it.
---
No problem
---
When I see posts like this, sometimes I just want to scream my lungs out.
---
or you missed. it’s a 2 shot in close. no question about it. quit lying
---
Oki thank you
---
all it takes is a granade to take you down on that tight room
---
Absolutely nasty, great clip
---
Yup
---
Yes my opinion is if you don’t have a mic don’t play. People like that piss me off
---
What are they doing with an army?  Fight kiwi monster?
---
What does this have to do with siege
---
I think it is kinda normal. Siege is a Game inducing extreme mental fatigue, even without unforeseen complications like the game bugging out, toxic players, leavers, loosing streaks and what not. It takes a lot of focus so even on a good day, without much complications there are at most 3-4 hours I can play before taking a break of a couple of hours. On days I am not completely fit or got stressed at work the playtime will decrease while the downtime might increase. One of my last sessions I was physically and mentaly in peak form and I ended up quitting after 2 1/2 hours because of team balancing problems, like playing almost all of the matches with a 4 vs 5 disadvantage, while the enemies teams always were filled back up after leaves
---
Oh my God. Statesman operator and kingsman operator. Please, it's too perfect to turn down ubi. My thirst for this to happen can never be quenched.
---
Good point
---
that's actually exactly what happens unless Ubi changed it
---
Do you know how people set their mains?
---
At least it isn’t a duplicate. Or a charm. I usually get both
---
I’ve also been trying to find a sensitivity that I’m consistent with and so far I’ve been jumping between these numbers.
---
Vert: 65-70
---
Hor: 65-70
---
ADS: 35-40
---
^(this is beyond science)
---
Yes, PC is so much easier when it comes to communication. But you still don’t have to be full tryhard in a full match vs one. All shield recruit and teabagging from spawn on should be an international sign for friendly enemies :)
---
For once, I'm actually torn which seasonal weapon skin to get. It used to be "None at all" or "the one good one", but now I don't know whether to get Strike Force or Destroyer. (I'm also considering the ice cream one, but that one's mostly for lols.)
---
Yeah it really does.
---
Why? Are you a diamond?
---
Wait, I thought it was red.
---
he's fatto but all because of that armor he wears :)
---
I’m talking about the shotgun not the smg.
---
He can be very good on some obj's but he's held back by his mediocre guns
---
Plat 2
---
And I play ESL
---
Yeah more Scottish
---
Pretty sure thats a pasta
---
Cool. Congrats. I’m not, I’m even unranked, I don’t think that matters, thank you for the input.
---
Freeze frame as you shoot
---
all what I need is 1r6 credit, because I have 299 credits and can't buy a pack, when some events come to siege
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
It does matter improving small stuff will make u that much better
---
Yeah, on console u just gotta teabag and 360 and hope for the best that the enemy won’t pop you in the head lmao
---
I like Finka sweating and IQ looking nervous as fuck next to Nøkk lol
---
Wired? Have you done a traceroute?
---
I’m sorry but I had to. 😣
---
I've never understood that quote.  By definition a miss is when you tried but missed your target, so if you never try you don't really have a target to miss
---
I thought if you go down far enough sorting from recent bundles you'll find it
---
How many fps?
---
Napalm.
---
I guess Ubi still has not watched this video
---
cOnSoLe PlAyS

Secret service
---
How about you go into 15 casual matches and get spammed by Ela’s shotgun. Then come back to me and tell me how skill is involved.
---
Omg that fuckin potato fiesta burrito party.
---
No, you just kill her.
---
Yeah for sure! Send me a friend request
---
Will do!
---
In casual I'll care if someone takes my Ace or something but in ranked I couldn't care less. All that matters is the W
---
I’m level 97 and i still don’t have any black ice at all.
---
silent night? you mean like nøkk's new ability?
---
F
---
He’s right though. If you wanted the kill, you should’ve headshotted him and it would be immediate. If you downed him, it shouldn’t mean you get the kill, whoever kills them should get it. It’s fair.
---
Omg not fair
---
I think if any it's tower.
---
Aye mate
---
Oh so back when Ela’s smg was a laser, all you had to do was kill her right and then the gun wouldn’t be op anymore?
---
I'm going to be completely honest: I don't like the way that Ubi is going with the shop. The current system is a clean, effort-free experience that I don't have to think about unless I'm actively searching for a specific CTU or something, and the menus are all separated in a clean way. Note: *An effective UI is any UI that you don't need to think about.*
---
So, that's why I'm worried about this Xbox-ass window-based shop. The new design doesn't seem to have options for you to view menus of all available categories, and even if that were to be implemented, I think it would be annoying and clunky at best to need to scroll and search oversized windows to find the type of product designation you're looking for. Am I the asshole here? It just looks very clunky and like a noticeable downgrade from the clean, effective shop we've had in the past.
---
This is probably why I've gotten 1 tapped thru bb's shield so many times recently
---
You see, the problem here is that the FO12 isn't broken.
---
I'm pretty sure they have fixed it. The sound you don't hear (your silent foot steps) are client sided. Ask a buddy "Hey can you hear me run" while doing it.
---
Hello anthyfield9, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/btp3dz/no_text/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
And have the sidearm have the pistol with the select fire option to fire a shotgun shell.
---
Maybe give the attacker the perfume grenade?
---
Besides spawnpeek the map was heavily defender sided, no entrances were viable
---
Yeah, but not everyone is a amazing competitive player that needs to improve at everything, I think that having fun is more important than winning or being competitive.
---
&gt;The map in balance and I agree on everything you say'd. I just wanted to hear the communitys thought. 
---
Trust me, either you are very good, or your enemies were very bad, but border is balanced enough.
---
&gt;P.S. out of the the things need to fixed the first is Ela her ass should be thicker then Gridlock with Rooks armor on.
---
Na tank mama is da thiccest. Rook is just plain fat.
---
If anything rework bathroom/tellers site
---
Good you set them in their place.
---
They thought you would have given up but you made sure they were on their toes.
---
Cold.
---
could've at least credited em
---
\&gt;inb4 "em's watermark is on pic so it's ok to steal lol"

nah bro. the watermark is barely visible as is.

---
Wifi - I don't know what a traceroute is
---
And what I predicted came to pass.
---
I think it needs to be installed, but not 100% on that.
---
Yup. No competent player has ever made it copper because of bad teammates even though they claim that as the reason.
---
*visible confusion*
---
HELL YEAH
---
r/r/
---
Still the case.
---
Vertical play is the biggest issue. Even if you bring a castle and Mira in Connector, if you lose control of piano, and lobby connector, you're screwed.
---
Uno should remove their acog scopes so the masses will freak out
---
Tachanka's pp
---
With the recoil it’s packing you gotta be hella skilled to fully empty a magazine AND hit your target. That, and the fact that shotguns are inferior to anything that’s more than 15m away makes it balanced
---
Dang
---
Amen, brother.
---
Thatcher did that in the hammer and scalpel video.
---
I think you still can, but I don’t know for sure. When I play Bandit I always use the batteries on reinforced walls so I haven’t tried/seen it for awhile.
---
Yes, we know.
---
This was posted multiple times last week.
---
Of course he did, he's a hacker man
---
is it just me or does he give off vibes from kingsmen
---
You are delusional if you think R6Fix does anything more than sending emails "thanks for your report, we will investigate"
---
Lol I would like to have my plat thing
---
Is it me or is his stomach big?
---
I have it for all 4 SAS operators because I bought the pack at the end of season 1 for I think it was 10k renown? 
---
My biggest regret in Siege: at the same time, I opted to buy the Leder skins for GSG9  instead of another set of black ice because I loved it, and it had previously only been available for money.  Leder skin is still available and costs basically nothing, black ice never came back.
---
The longer you charge it the more blood sucking moths are summoned from Cthulhu's realm of nightmares.
---
Cause 5 golds equals 2 diamonds lmfao
---
Ok now this I can confirm is true
---
If you aim lower when peaking then you will land every shot especially if you know how to control recoil. That shotgun can shoot further than 15m making it unbalanced
---
Note: While Arsole is technically poisonous, the effects are long term, and quite high. So it's unlikely that this is actually what's in the canister.
---
4-1, the 2 diamonds obviously carrying the rest, how did they not do much better than us?
---
I see you have an issue with blackbeard just by looking at your name. lol
---
Recruit is still there?
---
Hell yeah
---
Ah, I did not visit this subreddit quite a while. This was just about the substance, not the elite, btw. I just marked it as a spoiler for people that did not want to get the elite spoiled
---
Hello redwingjv, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/btpwza/this_game_is_unplayable/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Those damage stats are if every pellet hits, and at the 18m range a few will always miss, as the hipfire/spread of the F0-12 is huge compared to other shotguns. 
---
It's a shotgun, it will never be as good as an automatic weapon unless it was truly busted, Sniper 90 for example, Ela and her shotgun are fine where they are.
---
That means you're good lol
---
You can't have it both ways.
---
Very nice play! Only thing I’d point out is that you could’ve picked up your drone and thrown it down the stairs so your team could spot your flank
---
Still unranked
---
Did you buy that little r6 emblem / tag valued at 1 credit, that'll be why they sell it
---
I don’t understand the first one how would that help the attackers?
---
You cant have a balanced matchmaking system?
---
Unless they could make it so you have to confirm your rank through Ubisofts official stat page it wouldn't work, as people would just fake their rank.
---
*YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED*
---
not in ranked
---
I think I just found my new favorite acronym
---
People who leave so they don’t get interrogated deserve a Medal of Honor
---
Mr meatball with an lmg, where are you
---
I love Favela too much.  I don't know what it is, but I can't just leave it.
---
Is this a  joke?
---
I agree, but where is the icon
---
I approve
---
this is honestly even more prevalent when youre rapelling upside down.. ive been one tapped 2 or 3 times in the very few hours ive played as blackbeard and in the replays they have a clear line of sight on my head whereas its safe from my angle... thanks for pointing this out!
---
The one I'm thinking bout is the top floor one
---
Add some maverick holes after the tip for Pro Status lol
---
If you would have been sledge you would be the new king of this site 🤣
---
You can't complain about the system being bad in matching by rank when you win the game in that way.
---
I would like to see this map back but only if it got reworked. That aside, Favela, Chalet, Skyscraper, and Tower would be nice to see significant changes to as well.
---
**HERETIC**
---
PERFECT BALANCE @Thanos
---
You gotta specify what platform and region man
---
Nah they need to make the p90 a viable option over the mp5
---
The average MMR of their team matches the MMR of yours, which is how matchmaking is determined for a team queue like that. They had a bronze and a silver and you had all golds.
---
Why do we need this?
---
*MAESTRO WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION*
---
The fire rate compensates for the missed pellets. All the gun needs in a fire rate nerf
---
Those sounds are client sided, so the enemies and teammates will still hear you sprinting.
---
play casual then
---
That’s some fine work son
---
Pretty sure you have no idea what you're talking about OP. All of your arguments are fallacious, a one shot headshot only favors the lucky player. Removing one shot headshots favor the player with better aim. This is true for literally all FPS games, including CS:GO.
---
Siege not following the standard basically flips everything around.
---
Yup, that about sums it up
---
Check edit
---
Better than people getting stuck in gold or silver because of people like you
---
Right??? :(
---
First time me and my friends try to play in 2 weeks... it’s a sign
---
#Tryhards all ya
---
that's what happened to me, but everyone left but me.
---
I basically gave up, but at the last round I managed to ace it as recruit.
---
Valk in C tier? BB in D? Cav in S? We need to start clarifying which rank the OP is in before we post these..... because I would agree that cav is S tier in bronze, but not in gold+
---
Yeah it’s doing it for ranked and casual on ps4
---
:[
---
Yes this is great
---
Cav and Thermite should be A tier. Ash, Echo and Lesion should be S tier.
---
Now that’s epic
---
stupid sexy Warden...
---
1.) use Adderal
---
2.) Profit.
---
Dude on the right is radicalsoda
---
Just as an FYI since this was covered by just about every person who felt the unrequited need to post this over the last week since it was leaked: This is ***not*** what is in the canister, rather a cheeky joke about the word Arshole and chavvy brits. If you're really curious about what's in the canister, ask Ubisoft S.A.M.
---
Maybe read the fucking rules before you post a banning campaign. Jesus Christ I'm getting so sick of this shit
---
Or, with warden, you can actually shoot him. Lion could sit outside and patiently allow his team to push and be safe. Warden has to stand perfectly still to see through smoke. Like glaz. He wont be too OP
---
She became the best op in the game due to a glitch
---
Same thats why I got into r6
---
Capital has been nerfed, he now has 10% of his screen covered with a black bar and everything outside his optic is blacked out when he aims.
---
Because it isn't.
---
No witch hunt, downvoted
---
Yeah. Ps4?
---
Happened yesterday for me now I'm good
---
Hopefully never. Please never bring back Zappy Bitcht that isn't Twitch
---
tbh he was just brought back for fan service
---
I knew that it’s why I stopped playing. I’m not gonna even try and combat something like that. I’m just curious about what happened? Did they like take her out of the game?
---
Why does that look like a school?
---
1) I hate what that does to me and I don't like being reliant on drugs 
---
2) no
---
yess
---
Yep same here
---
well i spent $15 bucks on pro league skins so i better get her back
---
Yes, ps4 matchmaking issues.
---
Yep. Repeated matchmaking error on PS4.
---
Bomb is warmup for ranked, hostage is for dicking around, and secure area is everything inbetween
---
fuck you.
---
Nope. Operator no refunds 2.0 is a go
---
Before it used to be like this with acogs but now most of the time where ever your reticle is the bullet will hit there. But with some cases with reflex or iron sights, the bullet would be a cm off the actual reticle.
---
did you just not read the part that said next season
---
Who said you can’t next season
---
Same here. I'm seeing all greens on the PlayStation server status so I'm thinking it isn't just ps4
---
What do you mean people like me, I’m not the one going out and boosting with low levels, I earn my diamond with my fellow plat ones and veterans of the game before ever playing with my friends who I convinced to get the game recently, and by playing with them I’m only handicapping myself by bringing inexperienced players
---
I have a lot of free time
---
This is actually from a Mall in Los Angeles. This space is called Eataly L.A.
---
I am playing bomb.
---
Terrorist hunt is the only that works for me
---
It’s just a way of giving each tier a specific, universal, grade, with S meaning it’s ‘super’. Calling an operator S or A tier let’s you know exactly where they rank it as opposed to God or Great tier etc. Numbers could be used, but letters are just fine
---
i wish i did.
---
yes until they fix the issue but they haven't made it clear when that's gonna happen. So until then, claymores, deployable shields and clash have been removed
---
Imagine playing R6 in 2019 and not knowing that the queue stops working correctly after 3 minutes.   
---
Wasting your own time for no legitimate reason.
---
This is my mind on drugs
---
That was half an hour ago not now you mudblood.
---
I call that a moral victory
---
Looks like a known issue on ps4 
---
https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/status/
---
Ash wouldn't be able to take it down because of the Bandit shock wire.
---
+ during queue times it’ll let you know % chance of winning based on the other teams stats
---
It’s not about counters. There is no such thing as a counter to a weapon. It’s about his powerful it is
---
This tierlist ordering comes from japanese fighter-style games which usually use a graph from D to SSS+++ to show a sustained combo. For example the Devil May Cry series.

Holy crap. So I guess maverick is affected cause of the claymores being gone...

Never

There’s a subreddit for R6 beginners? I underestimated this community, good to know
---
Actually good one :D
---
*sniffs* They are in garage and have a black ice skin.
---
Is pushing a kid off a tower one of them?
---
Diamond player with 500 ping. I see this as a handicap to the enemies
---
I agree, the plague doctor one is also kinda unoriginal- literally 90% of the elite skins are just older era versions of current skins so I’m glad they changed it up
---
You hate these because they aren't adding to the game but you also enjoy fanart?
---
I personally like it even tho I never play rank
---
You forgot the Lesion mine
---
“Brennan I’m coming”
---
*poof*
---
poop
---
Lol you're a little late
---
i think it was 150? maybe that changed at some point, no less than 75 which is not &lt; an mp5 shot
---
Blast radius? I think they need to take a set amount of damage to break
---
From i what i can tell he wasnt lagging during the match. It might have been during the photo that it spiked but i cant remember if ping changes at the end game screen
---
"so i don't have to get close to it... 
---
....
---
...OHHHH WAIT!......"
---
Oh sorry i forgot that there is only one way to win in rainbow. To kill the whole enemy team, not secure an objective or defuse a bomb or maybe extract a hostage... nahh only to kill them all. oops
---
How do you set up a custom match with more than 3 players? Or how boy a party is
---
Should be ready for run outs it’s basically meta
---
And that we deserve
---
maybe unplug the second mouse
---
Gg, I love kapkan too. Was were you using as attacker?
---
Obviously repost
---
Idk dude IQ's AUG with a supp is pretty delicious
---
***Big Thanks to*** u/majesticube ***, who help me a lot with this idea!***
---
Because it can do shit like this \^
---
when you start a custom you can invite 9 other people
---
This is how I got 3 kills of my first ever ace. Frost is still one of my favorites.
---
Mention to be a reply to the one guy who didn’t get it
---
It's a great concept and I dig the art.
---
I hope I never have to witness that ever wether it's my teams or the enemy's im not religious but ima have to pray I don't see that shit
---
Been having that on Xbox for almost half an hour
---
Don't worry - The Elite Skin will fix this
---
If the frost mat is placed correctly no it would down them then finish them with the explOsion
---
\*smonksmonk\* ):
---
It’s really not that bad. It’s much easier to control than other semi-autos. The shot grouping is also really small with a laser. I’ve easily sprayed opponents from across rooms and killed them
---
https://discordapp.com/invite/rainbow6
---
Clash?
---
The prompt is weird, the bandit has to either be right behind or right in front of the shield. Unfortunately, as the person above said, shields were disabled until they can fix the glitch with them.
---
A kill is a kill ;)
---
It’s so very ready
---
no
---
Mirror next to it?
---
*Ali-A intro blares*
---
Ok thanks!
---
I just got out of a match with some friends, we’re all platinum and diamond, and we had a flawless victory. Matchmaking sucks

u/SAU-SIEGE what have you done???😭

Marcus should be a 3 speed because a large part of his character comes from his parkour skills

Now just import lawbringer 1:1 no changes needed

Yeah it will literally all just be copper 4 or diamond

this might be the most pointless rant in the history of rants. get over it

Of course! Thats why I play siege

another post whining about runouts? how original

I just wish they would auto switch the secondary gadget to something OTHER than the shield/wire for OPs that I forget to switch them back over and don't get anything that round.

nothing should be done about runouts. it’s a viable strat and pretty easy to counter.

As a guy that hadto wear an eyepstch for a while - it depends on which eye is a leading eye. Usually left for lefties, right for righties, but you perception of length gets seriously messed up.

Wait that’s illegal

U idiot this is ubisoft game characters.

I disagree

I mean, it would prolly add a level of attractiveness to being a better teammate, why not try it??
---
yes you were lagging. your internet is what’s broken, not the game.
---
Him bring viable relied on the banana vision. Now that you have to be completely static to get this and any movement will knock this off, he isn’t gonna be great at all. When has standing still ever been a good thing in this game. 
---
He needed the nerf and I’m happy that they took this route but it will kill his viability completely I feel.

YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!!

they took her our :(

So we can just chill and run around aimlessly? There are times where we don't want to tryhard and sweat in ranked and just want to have fun.

You really didnt give aiden the ability to hack like 3 devices from a distance?

Surely a frag on the other side of the shield would clear it?

I'm Fapitao :(

Have you gotten a sense of your own play style?
---
What ops do you play most?
---
Do you rely on gadgets or guns?
---
Do you roam or hold?
---
Just curious, but what's the purpose of the second mouse?
---
If I end up in a casual game where everyone is basically a boy I just use my pistol to make it a little more fair
---
More like a smg but when he deploy the shield it is basically montagne but thinner
---
Glad someone else agrees he’s just a kingsman that’s what I said when I first saw him.
---
we said front
---
The ash must of felt so bad after that
---
You missed
---
Possibly ;)
---
Perfect XD
---
Won't the kapkan trap destroy the frost mat before they step on it?
---
It’s not a pump shotgun and it has bad range compared to the others.
---
SOH CAH TOA
---
I don't see a stack of Gu as tall as the shield.
---
You said front
---
Or you, ya know, don’t THROW A SMOKE CANISTER ON THE DEFUSER BECAUSE YOU WANT THE POINTS WHEN I’M TRYING TO DEFUSE.

We have Dokaebi to hack

Attention all Gold 3 and below, stop complaining about players that are better than you and do something about it.

Lol ever try turning your phone to landscape mode? Also computers and consoles have this incredible capability that allows you to take a “picture” of whatever is on the screen. It’s called a screen shot.
---
I hate Cav too, simply because 1) she seems to have a seriously high pick rate. It seems like every team has one, and 2) She really ruins my strats. Seems like everything is going okay until she comes out of the woodwork. I try to play in ways the enemy won’t expect but it seems like she always knows. I was playing Villa the other day and the OBJ was on the third floor. Decided I’d breach the basement barrel and do a Blitz rush up the opposite stairs where they wouldn’t be expecting it. Guess who was right around the corner? Who lurks TWO TWO FLOORS BELOW and on the other side of the map. I was pissed, but good for her
---
Mantagne because I’m silver and can’t cope with that shield
---
Have you ever been spawn peeked by a Tachanka turret?
---
That happened to me last night. It was surreal.
---
And then someone on the enemy team picks thatcher
---
disagree, one ash or zofia round taking 4 away off start...
---
holy shit they ##FLEW into the room

No, I cannot.
---
B02 Yacht?

Mav makes free gloryholes
---
Mute disables drones, charges etc
---
Rook gives live saving plates
---
And Fuze kills the hostage
---
Fair enough.
---
Nope the symbol definitely says you lagged right as he peaked 🤷🏻‍♂️ just a simple lag spike my guy
---
You’re not ‘really good at the game’, ok? You’re just up against shit players. And no, bronze is no where NEAR the top rank. Not even CLOSE. Not even in the same fucking continent. Like, if bronze is on Earth, the highest tier is on fucking Alpha Centauri. Ever heard of it? EXACTLY. (It is a real thing though). Take a step down, and realize you are up against shit players.

But I'm also pretty decent and can clutch if I get sweaty.

I'm usually top two of if any team I'm on because I'm a team player and refuse to run around by myself.

If I see a teamate running around by themselves then I partner up with them and ping TF out of everything if that persons not talking.
