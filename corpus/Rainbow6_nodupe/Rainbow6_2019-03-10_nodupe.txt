Patch notes: hibana can now break the matrix
---
Are you on Xbox? I’ve seen more trolls today in ranked than ever before. 
---
Every. Single. Time. Except it only happens on the attacking side, I never get vote kicked when I go Mozzie
---
Maybe the fun kind 
---
I’ve seen that, what do you think
---
STOP FUCKING REPOSTING
---
The new one kinda looks like Mulan
---
I actually did that this morning at it worked! but thank you for the help 
---
See:pengu
---
bruh this the black ops 2 font. Smh
---
I swear my one friend was complaining people “we’re stealing his operator”. Mozzie and Gridlock make 49 and 50 total ops. 25 on any given side yet selfish pricks want to vote to kick when they have plenty to play as. 
---
I want that attacker so much &lt;3
---
They should fix their game first. 
---
Surprisingly I'm on PC. This is the first season it's ever been so bad. I usually don't play this early in the season either so that must also have something to do with it. I'm just going to not play ranked for a while.
---
I'm sliding over cars while a shoot!
---
Plot twist: OP's teacher was the original poster
---
ROBOT WARS!
---
It translates to warm inovation and I think that this is important 
---
I feel like there's some nasty Mira plays on that wall just waiting to be figured out.
---
I just want gesture wheel where you can say "Hi" , "Thanks" , "You're Welcome/No problem" etc.
---
It would be much more handy that typing or saying "ty" in the chat for revive or something like that... I mean... I do say "thank you" , I don't know about other ppl but that would change it (I hope)
---
Gey
---
No, your pass isn’t fully downloaded. Go into games and apps, click the menu button on siege, and then go to the ready to install tab. I had this same issue and that is what fixed it for me. If that doesn’t work, then I would talk to Ubi support.
---
I think it's fine if the game has totally imbalanced and noncompetitive maps like House, old Hereford, Plane, etc in casual only. I dunno, it feels like we've gone from an imbalanced map that's fun for a large minority of players to instead have an ostensibly competitive map that nobody seems to actually like.
---

---
I personally like the super intuitive, high verisimilitude maps even if they're totally imbalanced.
---
In the past 24 hours 7 times I’ve been booted out. This is getting really ridiculous. I’m so close to finding a new game.
---
Same. I never felt so heart broken than when I got duplicate black ice for the smg-11
---
Sledge and his grenades man. I've seen it too many times...
---
You click crouch and then immediately press it again but hold it the second time. You will go prone while still adsing.
---
Nice, but why is your brightness so high
---
Still. That is a small target to hit and you are still at a disadvantage because you probably wouldn't even be able to recognise that that thing is around the corner aiming at your head
---
Thank you kind sir
---
I’m surprised people love mozzie community wise. I can’t stand his loadout. 
---
Because some fuckhead was in a shadow and I couldn’t see him so I bumped my brightness up to 100 out of spite.
---
**THE ULTIMATE NERF TOWARDS ASH**
---
How?
---
I feel like her head looks too cocked to the side in the new one to be beliavable. Too small too. Plus the old pose was just cooler. It's not bad tho, and Hibana Elite more than makes up for it. 
---
Not sure if it’s the same on PC but I had this issue on Xbox a few seasons ago. Had to uninstall my game then install it again. Worked fine afterwards. God speed 
---
Thanks man, idk why that happened
---
If it had a large hit box and a light or something to give it away?

The ultimate power move

Needs more fidget spinner. 
---
People do realise some of this aren’t realistic just extremely advanced military tech that does exist 
---
New one looks like that one kid that wants to be your friend and you keep saying no but they tell everyone they’re your friend anyway
---
I’m level 157 and gold 2 lol 
---
Ubi pls do
---
RIP Console users. My PS4 sounds like a jet engine enough already
---
It's great, but it undermines the custom appearance the legendary skin sets have.
---
Well with my internet speed it will take about  30hours to reinstall and it slows internet for the whole family
---
It is going to be annoying to re install so imma try to fix it if everything tjing doesn't work i will re install it 
---
Ewww light mode
---
Loo it’s a joke in reference to all the noobs in there😂
---
Lol, I love when people just say "It's only 400 bucks lol" without thinking about the conditions other people live in. In my country there's 24% tax on almost everything and 12000€ per year is considered above-average wage.
---
It happened to blitz too
---
50 dmg is better than 1100 fire rate, especially if your aim sucks
---
Forget spinner girl VS 80’s lady
---
Yeah bro that montage is blind as a bat hahahahaha
---
Yeah a tape q-tip gun belongs on a AAA FPS game
---
It won't increase load times as it has to load the models anyway 
---
Dude wtf?
---
New one looks too fake y’know 
---
Cool
---
I'm in the same boat and I also have shut down and reopened the game as well as restarting my ps4 
---
Sick play !

Youbrealise dok is attack and everyone else is defense on this image 😏😉

I liked the old portrait but the new model is much better.
---
lol I love it despite its flaws.
---
Play as Mute, put hammers in obscure places, and use the shotty to pop them. Before they can get Mozzied.
---
He had 3 Hager’s, there are 10 drones.  You will get there.
---
You’re actually the first person I’ve ever heard (in real life and on this sub) admit to liking her Hereford.  Don’t get me wrong, the aesthetics are amazing, but the map design is meh, and what they did to old Hereford is actually a travesty.
---
I ended up giving up after 2 days of back and forth with Ubi support and bought it on steam and have full audio back
---
Your way of thinking doesn’t make any sense to me. Why would you want to ruin the experience of someone who is trying to take the time to learn a game that you enjoy playing? Why would you make it so they don’t have the chance to see how cool the game really is? We want people to come be a part of our community and not label the entire player base as toxic just because people like you abuse the things that Ubi implements to help better the experience that players, especially new ones have. 
---
My advice, get good. Then, maybe you wouldn’t feel the need to pick on the new guys. 
---
It would be about the same fps as in-game wouldn't it?
---
Honestly sometimes it’s just luck, I’ve randomly sprayed a soft wall before and somehow got someone. Lol and it was so suspicious too, I thought to myself “this might look like I’m hacking”.  Unless there’s some way of cheating or hacking on ps4 that I don’t know of 
---
All you need is the Black Widow skin anyways so it is a non-issue
---
repost?
---
Same but we all know that with friends is just a joke🤣.
---
Fps would probably be the same, but it's the loding times that are the problem
---
Definitely. 
---
Wait no it isn't.   Big data consuming update not worth the 4.2 gig decrease

Is it?

If Xbox go to my games and apps, press the 3 line button I believe and manage game and add ons, and you should see it there to download.

because that's how it was before.
---
Each floor is fundamentally changing but in particular main floor is heavily being changed
---
If you find a r6 meme, reddit saw it first. 
---
Wait what about skyscraper I just realized
---
Did you buy the pass with the game open? Restart
---
Old, got it in Para Bellum already
---
If you are on Xbox go to r6 press the three lines button go to game addons and go to ready to install. It should say season 4 pass. Download it and restart r6.
---
it's if you queue with them..
---
There aren't enough buttons on a controller for this. It's not possible with the current layout of the standard controller.
---
I like how everybody uses the straw man argument.
---
Like when I TK people think
---
“Wow he TKs because he’s so bad at the game so he kills teammates because he’s jealous of their skill level”
---
When in reality I just TK because it’s funny hearing the reaction.
---
Same with smurf. It’s fun and easy destroying noobs. Has nothing to do with with “getting destroyed”. No Smurf’s are Smurfing because they are getting their ass kicked. They are doing it because it’s fun.
---
Never hard reset your console for problems like this, the hardware is clearly not the issue here.
---
Have you searched for an actual Ranked match yet? That might be an easy way to get rid of this pop-up.
---
I can confirm
---
It’s always an Ash.
---
Yep
---
Lol shut up gay boy (I’m joking)
---
Exactly, it ruins the experience and frustrates people to the point where they abandon the game. I just don’t understand it. 
---
gridlock traps are used to stop the flank from caveira
---
I mean I guess it is I sorta forgot about it 
---
I more think of it as another office building that happened to have a doc close by 
---
matters what he does, but 90% of em.. not really tbf xDD
---
Not true at all.
---
You have done well my son.
---
Apparently it was too innacurate sometimes like showing 70/80 damage on a single SMG shot which led to too much complaining of bad hitreg or the likes
---
Hell nah the old one doesn’t fit in anything but The Grudge.
---
One time I did a Cav 1v5 clutch but interrogated everyone instead of defusing. It looked like I had enough time but was off 1 or 2 seconds. My team decided to call me a ‘fucking moron’ or something. I mean, are you really going to tell me I suck at the game when you can’t even do it yourself? They didn’t even say anything while I was interrogating them. Yes, I understand that I was being toxic when doing that, but I’m just a point goblin, like many others 
---
Never going to happen
---
I don’t necessarily like it, I just think it’s better than the old Hereford

---
Right! When we played a game he was so supportive. To be honest I planed on trolling with my friend, but I could not bring myself to do it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The new map is questionable, I believe some areas are attacker friendly and some areas are defender friendly. Over all ot makes for a good map. Lots of nice angles and vertical play. 
---
Mozzie I see getting nerfed due to how powerful his gadget is for information denial and gathering. 
---
Gridlock is well balanced decent recoil on the lmg and nice scope for it too. the gadget has a long full deploy time and is easy to destroy. 1 speed 3 armor is a nice addition to the roster on attack.
---
I haven’t been playing r6 for a very long time, but my personal fave was White Noise. My main Vigil got introduced, and things just felt fun back then
---
Someone's bad lmao
---
I think it would help group attackers for easy c4 group kills. I'm for it. 
---
xD
---
I've always wanted something similar but I didn't think of animated cards. that's pretty clever imo. it might lower fps for potato users like me though. itd be great if the cards had the current skins/weapon attachments you have on. 
---
Pretty straight forward, really. Just win one match twenty times and you're golden. 
---

F2 basically is a gadget lo

Glad to see casual hasn’t changed

Clientside?
---
Was about to ask his ping lol. Well it's obviously boobisoft being a goof again
---
Have you seen the video above?.... My head was barely showing at the time where I was able to see Cav and Cav was ONLY able to see my legs popping out..... and like 1/4 of head, but I was able to see cav's head peeking right around.  
---
I'm not saying that the old QEQE was good, I also hated the stupid shield players spamming QEQE (aim in center and eventually the head will get popped tho) but this new QEQE is also coming to a problem ;u especially with peeking
---
is this what hell looks like?
---
What do you mean?
---
Ur hitbox is bigger than ashes hitbox
---
With the old QEQE comes QQEEQQEEQ spamming which is really where my issue is. 
---
If Ubi can bring back the slower animation of the old QE and get rid of the broke ass QQE spam then I would be all for it. 
---
confused how i’ve been downvoted
---
[removed]
---
People who play secure the area have no clue what this videos means.

I’ve seen similar reactions from Mozzie’s when you kill their drones.

But why put the spoiler tag on it?

&gt; but it’s more of what the competitive side of the game wants
---
It's pretty universally hated. It's more balanced than old Hereford perhaps but it's an oversized, overly complicated nightmare to play on. 
---
* Blasphemer! How dare you bring logic into the house of God!*
---
that's not saying much
---
Because they dont put any effort into the stories they make
---
He just curved his bullet down the stairs :(
---
dae the lord??? xD
---
Even if they don’t like the map very much, it’s still more competitive than the old one. That’s the only thing I meant by saying that 
---
Yup... i think old 3f on situation “CQB Basics” was blocked off before this season. I accessed it today
---
just keep playing, it is a really, really difficult game to learn especially if you're new to fps games. siege was my first fps and i always solo queued so i had a 0.5kd for at least my first 200 hours in the game... i'm now up to about 500 hours and i've managed to boost my overall kd to 0.8 with a seasonal kd of at least 1.3 the past two seasons. i have learnt a lot just from playing, practicing aim in thunt and watching twitch streamers and youtubers (varsitygaming and get\_flanked are my favourites).

300 IQ plays

People say she's weak because she's a 1 speed with a lackluster ability. She has smokes but there are better operators with smokes so she is seen weak in comparison.

He predicted Apex Legends as well. 10:05 - I got bamboozled lmao
---
Well yea i knoe they're gonna do it but still
---
My mates already need 5 minutes to load without this. 
---
Yeah, I think that will be better, old QE system where the animation is slower so that your head won't go bobbing crazy and that it won't be staying still for quick peek around the corner

Nah it was favela he just straight up walked through a wall
---
Good enough for me thanks for the feedback 
---
Ops drop a week later if you don’t have season pass, this applies to all seasons now and forever
---
He has it but is scared to use it because he's so used to the other one. 
---
Could you elaborate on that? Im not familiar. 
---
If they lower recoil to that of cod, it just really isn’t much of a rainbow game anymore, it’s just another generic FPS, the realism is what puts rainbow games separate from all other games
---
Quality shit post 
---
I feel like the sound is wrong. I think I hear somebody in the next room and then you know he is in the opposite direction.

\~100 is still okay. \~200 is bad.

Source: Played with 100s ping before, I got to Diamond. I just got fiber internet, so now my ping is &lt;100.
---
This community is a cesspool. I hope so. 
---
The only thing I can think of is play casual, or another game to get used to it, then when he thinks he's ready to go to ranked.
---
Not bad but I like the pictures better u know
---
On top of everyone elses advice that they have suggested, you also have to remember it is currently the start of the new season, the ranks are currently all messed up. There will currently be alot of high plat - diamond players stuck in gold because of how bad their placements went aswell.
---
Just keep your head up, focus on map knowledge and game sense. This game isn't all about fragging.
---
He's adamant about Ranked and I don't blame him you shouldn't have to play only one game mode because some assholes. 
---
Lower it on console then. It’s completely different from pc to console. 
---
Text stays normal as the voice lines are under a seperate setting. But, all voice lines will be changed to the new language, so this includes the commentator and the operators.

My man 
---
You forgot the teamkilling prick. And the non-reinforcer who for some fucking reason never reinforces and expects to win the game. 
---
MMR (Matchmaking Rank) also has nothing to do with a Elo system.
---
Elo only works in Zero point games such as chess and GO, its meant to rank player on a individual game. simply the more games win and the high ranks you beat the higher you climb.
---
Trueskill was made for halo 2 and works best over multiple games to find the most competitive match.
---
this is why at the start of a season you lose and gain more MMR then at the end of the season where you gain very little. simply its trying to find the most competitive outcome in the match not rank your ability.         
---
I liked the effort in Blitz image 
---
Been playing since launch. Squaded up with a lot of different people (friends, friends of friends, strangers, etc). From my experience, Level 50 players arent even that far off in terms of skill than Level 1-10s. Focus on getting better than trying to know wat ur teammates levels are. People start getting better at around Level 100.
---
Definitely more fatter
---
doesn't mess up hz, fps maybe.

I think mozzie as he's more useful to the team 
---
Try opening task manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), click details tab and find Discord process(es). Right click on them and set their priority to above normal. This will give them better access to CPU during gaming. If it helps then there are ways to make this setting permanent, doing it this way is only temporary.
---
Is mozzie from Dallas buyer's club?
---
Oh, so the game is just supposed to magically assume that person was going to be interrogated, despite them not being in an interro animation? Gotcha. 
---
It truly is
---
stressful line of work, that requires years of experience. yeah that will do that to ya

Oh don't worry about that. Easy to play like you're losing when you're always losing 
---
Funny thing is that room is between Nature and Bushranger and it's usually heavily defended with that bombsite. Might catch people off guard once but not twice.
---
It's nothing new. Every season start has many more cheaters than regular play. But like you say, the fact that these players never actually get penalized is beyond me.
---
Just ran into a 5 stack in casual twice in a row flaunting their wallhacks and no recoil scripts essentially killing everyone at the start of every round we were on attack. But like you say these dudes were like level 150-300, with season passes and pro league skins the lot. Clearly they know there is essentially no risk to their account or they would not buy this expensive stuff if they would lose it.
---
You know VAC works because most hackers have new accounts, and no cosmetics. That isn't the case with BattlEye games because it's a piece of shit

PC MASTER RACE
---
Lol clutch or kick bro. 
---
FYI. It’s probably a squad warming up for ranked and are waiting on their fifth. 
---
I’m not saying I participate in it but if you really want to get serious, get friends to play with. If you’re looking for a squad to play with to try hard, join ranked or find a thread hosting. 
---
No disrespect, just saying..
---
The old one looked like a guy so new

Nah he’s barely even used

Lol, what a silly thing to say. Me correcting his complaining has nothing to do with being light or  not.

That’s casual for u, try ranked, people hardly leave on higher ranks.

Congratulations dude, it’s so hard for me to get to gold that once I do reach it I never play ranked for the rest of the season 😂

Check your owned games and apps (My games and apps - Games - Ready to Install), could be that the season pass is not installed.

Stop. Never do this.

Lokkaluze temporarily scans for footprints. if he scans yours, your phone rings. If you don't stop the ringing within a few seconds, a fuze charge jumps out of your phone.
---
Thanks for your input, sport. 
---
I feel dumb for asking this but haven’t played r6 in a bit, how much is elite Hibana?
---
Why would you pretend to make this? Adding a relevant title was funny enough but lying about making it?
---
Check TTS Notes it was fixed. The running animations have been changed twice since the first week of Burnt Horizon TTS.
---
Yet another cry out...
---
Listen... as much as people love running and gunning don't blame Ash... literally you can do it with any operator, it's just that she is a fragging operator so she is the one picked the most. I can tell you how many times i'll go to casual, randomly rush and die. Why? because it's not a thing to do in siege all the time. Yes sure sometimes rushing is effective but it's rare and only when you actually know how to rush. If you randomly run and gun you wont win a lot... 
---
There are some godly players that play Ash right and never run and gun. Simply they are gonna drone or get droned. Push to clear for the team, make holes with the breaching round and support with stun grenades.

that twitch drone flick tho, got the thermite charge with like a second to spare

Next time use tackenka on that spot for the ultimate meme

I really hope you reported him because he'll get communication banned almost immediately, which would be hilarious

No but in higher ranks against teams with proper communication, expect them to go lion if you go lion and get your ass kicked.

hey u just keep on keepin on

there are a lot of charms that have clipping issues now. I think actually most of them have clipping issues on a lot of guns. 1 step forward 2 steps back ;-;

plus why is she no longer holding her gadget, they really did her dirty

I’m kind of torn I honestly both, in my opinion she looks more “cute” while before she looked more badass
---
tl dr lol
---
but if hit reg annoys you take a break from the game like i did. Come back after some time after and try to forget about hit reg. I noticed much less problems with hit reg especially because now i embress the fact that hit boxes are weird so sometimes it shouldn't be a headshot even if it looks  like it
---
Yeah that part of the map sucks, I hope they’ll add some small features to make it bearable
---
Why do you play casual
---
C h i c k e n d i n n e r ?
---
Favela is one of the best maps. If anything, remove Fortress.
---
I’m level 200 and find low levels majority of the time in casual, don’t agree with it either but it is what it is, if you want fair matches play ranked.
---
Pog
---
This update was trash. Worst update they’ve had so far. 
---
OK THOUGH
---
U just need to play Mozzie and kill the drones you captured.
---
Creepy... as if she is Caveira 2
---
Not enough.
---
His gt is chinese, so definetley an elite

How long did this take

Ur reaction was too slow tbh, considering u were alrdy watching the door.

Hello Elhypersnyper, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/azdllf/ranked_matchmaking_idea/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You can't play it better now than over the first week? That's either a lie of a closed mindset. It's not a good map for a competitive map, but I have definetly learnt things from the start of the season. There are maps like Chalet that are just as linear in the strats and has so many shitty angles for roaming uptop, no one opens their mouth about that though.
---
Not its not. I always picked mozzie and never got tked. The shit will hit the pan when everybody has access to the new ops .
---
I’m okay with this being the only new map along side the reworks because its so good.
---
I think the ops are really good tbh, just the things behind the scenes are bad. (im east and i get put on west servers) My game has been crashing a lot. Hopefully they iron out everything 
---
You hit that Bandit into the wall holy shit
---
new patch notes be like:

1500 r6 Credits. So 15 dollars USD.
---
Gridlock doesnt have an smg
---
Same here. I dont know why they cant do something about that. I always report over 100 ping. I dont know if it matter, but its only thing what i can do for that. I know that many other ppl do same. Mby if we all report, then they have to do something. Or just put off that server chance 
---
Oh he's not degraded... But he wont get any playoff wins. Those wins that need a deep team. 
---
Playoffs = Plat2+ in this analogy.
---
I went 5-5 and got silver 1. What the fuck. 
---
Welcome to playing shields. It’s literally a gamble on the hit box god.
---
I mean im talking about the death not about my 2am Reaction time :/
---
Blitz is a thick boy. I expect nothing less.
---
Why is cavira rated worse
---
The new one is just ugly as hell
---
Happened to me like a week before Burnt Horizon. This isnt new.
---
Prefired a spawnkill runout they did every round 🤷‍♂️
---
I love how she hears it, looks towards the wall, thinks, "Huh, probably nothing," resumes holding angle, and get's absolutely busted by the breach charge.
---
Because his range is way smaller, they try to avoid them way more because it's such a big intel source and often u dint have a chance or are just dump when driving into a jammer
---
They didn’t change anything the hit boxes are still the same, the shields are broken a bit but that’s it
---
In cooking ? Yes.
---
In battle ? No.
---
I am not sexist and it is cool to have female ops in game , but everyone knows males are mostly stronger and perform better in battle.
---
Lol meant to say the 
---
How much is your retirement check going to be each month?
---
I'd be cool if alibi was crouched when the Prisma was thrown the Prisma would also be in the crouched position
---
Cool idea, but its a combination of all of Doc and Finka's worst parts
---
about 10 minutes, clear the map and then yeet the walls
---
how much in renown? 
---
M249 and commando but roni is also good
---
Just play ranked
---
In what way does the new one look like an anime character?
---
Ah shit, may aswell call it a loss then
---
At least she looks like an adult
---
No, but you can do cool things white his mask!!
---
Oh it was immediate, then asked if we could party up in 15 minutes after his abandon sanction was done 
---
&gt;- Nomad
---
You give her ANYTHING else, she'll become Op. Her kit exists to not make her OP, and even then, in her current state, she is retarded Op.
---
&gt;- Finka
---
Wouldn't matter. People will pick frags anyway. Frags are number 1 utility on attack.
---
&gt;- Jackal
---
Same as Finka. Smokes are number 2, and nobody in the sane mind would ever pick anything over smokes, unless they are frags, and that too depends on team composition. And frags on jackal is too OP.
---
&gt;- Blackbeard
---
Same as nomad. Anything else for him makes him OP. Especially claymores. And we all know how fundamentally broken he already is.
---
&gt;- Ying
---
Not sure about this. Flashes won't work since she isn't immune to them, but would add too much anti Defender utility. Smokes were removed for obvious reasons. Frags makes too OP. I don't really know what else would fit.
---
No this isn’t R6 related no share for you
---
In the Gear Shop first floor, its the kid and indys hats on a hat rack. Im drawing a blank on the kids name lol. 
---
Yea are you trying to remove the hot breaching from the hot breach god?
---
If you don’t have friends jump into casual and get on the mic and meet new people. Friend them if they have at least a .8 k/d. Boom problem solved 
---
Her new portrait looks like she has downs syndrome. 
---
Thicc
---
Lion  and Monty Defence. I leave you with that thought.
---
Yes, but they can't. If you look closely you can see that the clones are at a much lower resolution than the main operator. This is done so they don't exceed the polycount and texture budget they have. 
---
Loading in different loadouts for different players each round Alibi is picked would lead to longer load times. Sure, it'll load fast on high-end PC's, but you gotta take consoles into consideration as well.
---
D A T A   L I M I T S
---
Yo, that's some straight up Terminator stuff right there lmao
---
There are actually lots of people who agree with you. For those who are seriously passionate about Siege and are heavily involved in contributing to the improvement of Siege, they don't care the genders of the Operators. For MOST female Operators no one complains about their gender. Though it's true that Reddit and Instagram are filled with a lot of bad criticisms regarding females in Siege, they're overall ignorable because they aren't informed opinions and they come from losers who don't actually care about Siege itself. They're only complaining cause it affects gameplay and whether or not they can get double digit kill games or getting an ace. People like content creators, pro league players, and their passionate fans who follow this game religiously don't care whether an operator has testicles or ovaries. 
---
I suggest taking such stupid statements like "Ubi should apologize and redo Ash cause she's a woman" lightly. Though they are stupid and disrespectful, such comments don't actually affect the game at all. Ubisoft won't care, so you shouldn't either. I know it sounds rough, but it's just the way it goes. There are SOME arguments though regarding certain Operators that make lots of sense, like regarding Gridlock (She was showcased as buff and muscular Lara Croft figure, but then she just turned out to be fat, which doesn't make sense for a game trying to achieve "moderate tactical realism").
---
But yeah, in summary, the Siege community, as it is now and as it moves forward, largely don't care. The sexist/uninformed stuff you see here on Reddit and on Insta regarding females in Siege doesn't represent the majority. I've been a member of the Pro League community and tons of content creator communities for over a year regarding Siege, and honestly on the surface all the typical toxic shit you see disappears once you start getting deeper into the community, because those who love Siege love each other. Though there is still drama and criticism among the more intimate community, it's ultimately for a better Siege.
---
P.S. Also don't get tied up about the IQ/Ela thicc memes, they're just light hearted memes, no one actually takes them seriously. They've also died out anyways, everyone is now memeing Ash losing her ACOG, Mozzie, and Gridlock.

Yeah just repel through the window. I play as frost and counter the rush. 3 traps 3 people... Round over haha
---
I’ve been abusing that one since I found out and it’s so nice. Absolutely wrecked a defending team who had no idea we were there.
---
Agree, I'm shocked that the "Western interpretation of Asian women" comment got so many upvotes lol. 
---
Your words are upvote enough. Thanks!
---
I used to be on stable 9 ping, now it’s anywhere from 30 to 120+. SEAU servers seem to cross over with Asia servers, and they’re just pushing people from different regions together. It’s a bit of a shitshow, but it should be patched soon, as they have to force an update for that window you can teleport through on outback.
---
This explains how a sledge somehow walked into site and knifed me, I had no idea where he came from
---
Haha yea
---
Hahah yeah they need to fix that one
---
Tbh, Siege has abandoned it's attempt at a realistic shooter a while ago. I think they're aiming more for narrative and character driven design than realism, and I think that's ok. *Ready or Not* just showed off an 8 minute gameplay trailer and I'll take my dose of spec ops realism there. 
---
Her elite face is different than the one in her default skin, which looks bad. 
---
You never did a freebase?

Is this the 6 invitationals headgear?
---
And a gold background on elite skins
---
What ever it is, they need to fix it I guess
---
Am I missing something? Didn't they make some Amanda Walters looking chick a new Six in Siege for whatever reason?
---
Is this a version after Ding got promoted to a new Six (Vegas storyline)?
---
Or is this Clark?
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmnmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
OP doesn't have any servers nearby, there's nothing he can do about ping.
---
They don't count as attacker drones they are friendly gadgets at that point
---
O-Ren Ishii vs Beatrix kiddo lol
---
He's probably alright.
---
Thick girls rollen through 
---
defenders can use drones now?? 
---
You are too cool cause you have 1337 kills in casual
---
Rules themselves tend to disagree
---
if the rc4 gets buck's recoil (no attachments) will still be extremely easy to use,because ash has vertical grip attachment and with a flash hider "buck's" recoil will not be hard to master
---
She's not even human.
---
You fucking genius I LOVE YOU AHHAHA FUCKIN pm me or something we should play some time, that was the greatest time Ive had on R6 in a while
---
Real questions
---
Thanks man, but the problem is that we shoot them in the head, we see the blood, but they dont die, and its not my connection for sure
---
Why do you have to remind me. That thing is from the depths of hell. 
---
Dang. Well goodluck with that. 
---
Your view/camera moves quicker than your hitbox/body for other players. This means that sometimes it seems like you are shot even after reaching hard cover. It’s very frustrating but theres not much to do about.
---
Sad story
---
Dev team said that the ACOG removal was to cement her role as an entry fragger all the while keeping an option for those that want to play more methodical with the G36 with x2.5, so her pushing aggressively with a 1x R4C is the intended result they were going for.
---
Difference is before she could be across the entire map still running around looking for site, catch a glimpse of a defender miles away and A-10 Warthog their ass with minimal recoil. As a defender it's relatively hard with a 1x to hit an already slender hitbox at range, unless you are playing one of the 4 operators on defence with an ACOG in return.
---
I personally much prefer that I get a better chance at mid to long range on an Ash, and have a bigger target to hit when she comes in close range, not to mention you can hear her at that stage and you probably have a few Lesion traps or the like not far to help out.
---
he said old bb, like one unbreakable shield bb old

Hello Theroy, my boi
---
All i want is a buck elite, or jackal

Not really. After level 80 ish people have gun skill and map knowledge so it’d be pretty balanced anyway

---
die of cancer each and everyone of you fuck you
---
I put my webcam in my mouth.
---
There’s no set date but sometime early season I assume
---
People don't seem to understand how Alibi is played. You don't try to fool enemies into thinking that Alibi is there. Yes it can make people shoot a bullet or two there if they come quickly around corner etc., but main use for  holograms is to gather information of enemies' positions.
---
Put Alibi behind shield or window, and if enemies want to come through that, they either get scanned or they need to use grenade, EMP, or other resources to destroy the hologram.
---
New Hibana is more accurate than Old Hibana because Asians actually look younger than they’re supposed to. In Asian so I know
---
Reported
---
If anything they need a buff dude. Don’t know what kinda magic stuns your up against
---
Those guys good anchors too. The worst are probably the three speeds who are supposed to roam lol
---
Old one. Im would be fine with her new ingame skin if it didnt look like literal plastic
---
Its already out you can just search it up online lmao, unless you're a bot or some wierd AI
---
r/wooosh
---
Dude this is fucking epic. If I could give gold I would
---
I see the Siege community is still full of cunts
---
Happend to my friend he just deleted them reinstalled  the season pass 
---
you are right, she is not thicc, shes just plain fat.
---
Hmmm
---
If it's choosing between having them put 100hrs of programming/modeling effort into either
---
1. Making her have the same skins
---
2. A more logical buff like making the holograms have different stances, or being able to mimic other operators, not just alibi
---
Then i'll pick option two. But in an ideal world, we'd have both
---
If you can perhaps start clipping said events we can try and deduce what is actually happening?
---
More often than not it's either a blatant miss, latency hiccups or connection problems, spectator and kill cams are probably not synced up the same among all players either (Me and my friends noticed this on a few occasions).
---
What is the soldier 76 thing?
---
Oh I'm sorry.

---
What makes you feel this way?
---
Thanks for the info, much appreciated!
---
Fortress is tower 2.0
---

But you need ps plus to even get online at all with games. Maybe it’s different in US but my ps+ ran out two or three weeks ago and i couldn’t get online until I bought a new subscription. I have a ubi account 
---
thats why if you killed the hostage it counts as team kill and when you killed pulse it counts as no ban
---
Also, why do the attackers have the defenders' icon?  
---
You forgot this one
---
You were much faster than a google search lol
---
Dolphin dive!
---
Btw I believe I've talked shit to you in the past in-game for some bullshit and I apologize. I try not to be toxic but sometimes frustration gets the best of me, so if it was indeed you I do apologize.

---
Im in finland but i tried to get the free trial to my little brother and i added my paypal with no money or no bank account linked to it and it didnt accept it
---
The other day my brother said lets make this uplay account so i can play online and i thought well you still need ps plus to play online but i made him an account then casual and t hunt were unlocked just by that
---
I dont know wtf happened
---
what do you mean? just because hes a dev now means he couldnt have done something different before that? Im talking years ago.
---
Hahahaha yes, rivella! I love it
---
Welp, happy or not that's what he's getting :D
---
It's Mozzie
---
I feel like this should be how it is, the cav player shouldn't be cheated out of their interrogation just because someone left. Makes sense for gameplay that the interrogation still counts. I'd argue they should still be able to interrogate people even after they've left if they're DBNO. 
---
I can hear the thermite smashing his keyboard, absolute superb video op!
---
Still Thicc 
---
Nice

What did they say?

I like the old one,I know she doesn't look much Asian but after all the years it fits her and it works.

What in the fuck =/. Well no complaints there I guess haha 
---
*When a shadow does not match with its surroundings.* 
---
What is this doing here?
---
correct. Been playing since Beta and I hate how much I love it
---
Naah. Can't say I support this idea. I mean, it's cool but it's unnecessary in terms of loading. Imagine ubi does this and causes more people to load longer, especially those people who usually takes long time to load the game. People will throw knifes at Ubi and say ''Bring back operator portraits instead''
---
Yeah i dont know what happened either :\
---
Loot at you. You is me now.
---
People pressed the the down arrow that is located under your comment and next to the up arrow.

Gotta love Cav just crouching by the wall waiting for hell to end!

The new operator card is better, but the old in-game model was better.
---
Doubt it; wonder how many are dupes. 
---
*Now your thinking with portals...*
---
Well played my dude
---
Good idea but would drastically reduce performance. It should be implemented but off on default.
---

---
Do you know why apparently only negative rollbacks are happening? If the whole issue is due to rollbacks, some people should have gotten like 600 ELO plus, right?

M O Z A M B I Q U E H E R E
---
It’s to counter Mozzie because that bitch annoying as hell.
---
Zofia. Basically a rip off ash who’s still good, her AR is amazing and controllable, grenade launcher fires impacts and concussion grenades are good for intel and she has a claymore 
---
Doke, good gadget, average guns, secondary’s have loads of recoil, DMR is good but low fire rate
---
Finka, weapons are fine, ARs weak, LMG and shotgun are fun but her gadget seems useless at times and recoil reduction can be annoying as you’ll over compensate sometimes 
---
Nothing worth upgrading to on AM3, you would need to replace the motherboard as well. Then it gets complicated cause there's so many options depending on whether you go used and how much you're willing to spend. Also, anything more modern than 2015 would require upgrading to DDR4 RAM as well. 
---
There's already an answer: R6TM. Join them anf stop complaining about an issue that already has a solution. 
---
Mozzie rides the bike, gridlock drives the truck
---
Thats how siege is when a new map comes out thought everyone does stupid crap to see what works and what doesn't it'll level soon i promise but next time you play outback spawn anywhere but the south spawn and take a little bit of a glance at how much ubi spent placing somethings like cars walls fences etc to prevent spawn peaking
---
gottem
---
Is the i8 8400 ok too?
---
Isn't it just EA bashing, gatekeeping, cringe lords?
---
You joke but spawnpeeking with tachanka is one of the “key” 3 viable strategies. Since you have protection of your head and the attackers always get cocky because they think they can kill tachunks for the memes, but that lmg is also a sniper rifle when used right.
---
The three you named are, not looking at a skill level, the best attackers. Something to keep in mind for example is, that Doka is gonna get banned a lot while Finka and Zofia nearly never get banned. My personal order would be Finka - &gt; Zofia - &gt; Dokabi, but keep in mind that we probably have different playstiles. 
---
And its bugged and doesnt count most of the times
---
They have MASSIVELY fucked up shields. 
---
Thicc is often tended to be used ironically, calling something “thicc” typically just means fat. Thick on the other hand......

IT IS active tho :)

How is Tribes not on there?

I just thought its a cool detail that most people overlooked :)
---
That's so cute

roamers need to delay the attackers as much as possible. in bomb you play for time
---
Well, and then on the other side, noone is complaining about a green-haired, legging wearing special soldier from poland \^\^
---
 &gt;roamers need to delay the attackers as much as possible. in TNT you play for time

Tbh bro the best thing to do is just save for a pc so you can get off console 
---
Can you point me to these leaks? I don't like the way you insinuate that I'm stealing the supposed leaks by saying "you idea", since I came up with this on my own, in which case it's probably a good idea.

As your a pulse main stay underneath objective or hotspots of enemy’s and nitro cell from below using your pulse scanner to find where they are

---
Yeah well I mean of course there are some questionable choices in the list, but I'm not that against calling a game as "introducing" something to a even if it technically wasn't the first one, but the game that was had like 100 players total as opposed to millions.
---
Are you sure ? Nvm then ? But new info we will get mozzie and gridlock pro set
---
Yh i think if you have any of the CBRN uniform for other characters then they get to do the mission in there customized costume

Microsoft and Sony should ask the countries to ban XIM and any adapter for now on . and make it illegal to be added then

Good job. How many kills?
---
Was this actually discovered during the TTS phase?
---
So this is relevant to the sub because we have 1 (one) mention? ok
---
Yup it’s still there
---
New one is too optimistic.....like she hasn't seen real combat.
---
Old one looks like someone detached due to the pain she witnessed is combat, that moody melancholy fueling the fighter in her.

Shields are just fucked in this update. I had a mira spray at me while I was fully extended and she headshot me. I’ve had a ball shotgun me right in the face even though I was staring right at her. I’ve tried to melee people, but they instakill me with a melee before I even connect.

10 kills and only 1 death :D

Dang ela looks fantastic in that headgear

HAHA FUKEN KIDS AMERITE???

How do you think the community will react to a gay/lesbian or transgender operator in Siege?
---
Nice dude
---
I disagree, although I hate all three of those, tower and skyscraper don't have as many angles to watch and prefire. Not even gonna talk about the outside, it's basically a freaking museum. 
---
I guess your right I just really liked the old voice of 6 and that shot of him standing in front of the board asking grace to call him Harry seemed a bit suspicious
---
Same
---
This happened to me as well, it also happened with a few other challenges as well. For example I had to win 7 or 8 rounds with jackal before I completed the challenge to win 3 rounds with jackal and mira.
---
The Elo glitch is noticed and is being fixed, ubi has a record of the elo lost
---
For Honor has this, it sucks. It takes minutes, not seconds to load into a match because having the animated operators with all the player’s customizations showing drags out the load times
---
&gt;Warframe? You mean the ~~free~~ better Destiny? 
---
seems like you have a problem with trusting people in general xD
---
This bug has been around in r6 for a damn long time haha. They havent even discovered all of it yet
---
You can downvote me to hell but I need to say that - I don't like these "friendship" attempts in matches. It's not the point of the game, I don't want to goof around and make screenshots. Also I don't want to be shot by teammates for shooting enemies cause "he was friendly". I don't care he was friendly, I'm here for rank and fun of playing game as it was meant.
---
Yeah well so can some others be in this list too so I didn't count it in.

Except I did because I said

&gt;Warframe isn't exactly an FPS game.

There is an option for that !

If you go in Options &lt; Gameplay &lt; Interface Preferences. You'll find a couple of settings you can modify, feel free to test that with a couple of teammates to find the best options possible for you.  
---
You can't hide the icons sadly, but only the names and outlines if you wanted to know

Right
---
Thanks, me and a friend of mine have been trying to play co op but it's been difficult 
---
It literally informs new players how many scopes a certain operator weapon has....I dont see the problem.
---
I use the roni for the cool sight but I also love the lack of recoil and high fire rate.
---
u/jmehoph is right. Ubi is telling People on Steam that they do not meet the Minimum Requirements and its fucking dumb. If you wanna Upate your Game and make it run smoother and/or look better dont do it at the cost of the consumer or atleast say so early enough. But now Ubi lost a small amount of Players. But what do they care? Its a very small loss for such a Big Company and its sad that they wont care till a Shit Storm is started but about 100 People can hardly start a Shit Storm strong enough for Ubi to even care about.

The most frustrating thing on this map for my team is that we have to drone for maybe half the round just to get inside the map, and because the map is so unlinear and has so many rooms, we get flanked way too easy. People are a saying that's because we don't drone, well, it's the opposite. 
---
Rogue 9 did an in depth analysis of the stats, here’s a link. https://youtu.be/7Il8aZiCOvA
---
Worth a view, but tldr: both are good but commando is slightly better overall
---
mate how is that that hard to understand? must be a british thing. 
---
Every game has glitches though.
---
I honestly couldn’t care less what kind of character we have unless they are normal looking ops with decent gadgets. If they bring in a gay op with a rainbow flag hanging out they’re back pocket and some cyan blue hair looking ninja ass I’d be upset. For me it’s just another person in the game, so long as their lifestyle isn’t shoved down our throats. Have a bio that says she became a he back in 2009 or whatever that’s fine. But I just don’t want it to affect how the character model looks. Gay straight or trans, they all wear the same uniforms and have those standards to follow.
---
When someone reinforces in the middle of the objectives, just Thermite or Hibanna it.
---
As long as it doesnt affect gameplay i doubt anybody worth while would give a damn
---
She is balanced now this guy just got killed by ash too many times think of jackal his gun is op or twitch or even Iq but no one cries to nerf them
---
Not at all dude lol the fact that it's a different model doesn't change anything to the solution I was suggesting. 
---
Maverick, Lion is getting nerfed and it takes good communication to use him and Ying takes a lot of time to master while not being very rewarding. Maverick is possibly a game changer operator and has some pretty good guns.
---
I think they load in as drone phase swaps to attack phase. They might be being loaded in somewhere else and teleported in, but if you put a drone where the attackers spawn you can see a few frames of the operators appearing before the round starts.
---
It's not. It's just tilted.
---
[Like this](https://youtu.be/K1MviAG024c?t=26)

If alibi feels like a German male inside then we need to accept him

Yes old Hibana looks more serious. New one is too cartoon-y 
---
I haven’t gotten kicked yet for not clutching but I have got TK’ed. It honestly makes no sense why you would get kicked for staying alive longer and winning more gun fights. Especially when rounds before that you are the reason your team is winning.
---
....
---
What?
---
Have a look in this thread and maybe, if you try to disregard your own wounded ego you might see its the other way around.
---
The problem is... In all the matches i lost... I was always the one clutching multiple rounds... I cant be clutchin and winning every round ever...
---
Im not even toxic... In my post i stated i used support ops that could also frag, like echo, and gave good callouts... Sigh...
---
This has been going on for a while before burnt horizon it's just significantly more common now
---
They might look cool but us special forces out perform them in all ways lol
---
If they have a team of 30 people playtest a version for bugs for 2 full weeks as their full 40 hour shifts during that time, that ends up being 240 man-hours spent on bug testing.
---
If they release a version and *half* of their concurrent player base plays for 1 hour, thats 36,000 man-hours spent on bug testing.
---
It's just never going to be possible in game development for a QA team to be able to catch nearly as many issues as the public can. The QA team exists to try and catch things that stop the game from running and playing entirely, but they'll never have the success of finding smaller bugs that releasing a version to the community will.
---
I would say I’m proud but you’re playing blitz 
---
Danish operators are already confirmed in the roadmap for year 4. Also wasn't there a screenshot of a Ubisoft video where you could see artwork of a frogman?

You aren’t wrong in this case, it’s happened to me before as well. Join the R6 discord and you can find teammates easily there that are pretty good and your rank. Obviously you can’t win them all, but it’s frustrating when this happens

The fact that Goldeneye isnt the origin makes this all kinds of bad.

Hmm nice idea. maybe for every pack you get (dependent on quantity you buy) you get a different amount of renown booster. For example a 4 pack gets 2 days of the booster. Then in addition (again depending on quantity) you get a number of alpha packs E.G a 4 pack gets 2 alpha pack plus two days of renown booster. 
---
A 6 pack could be 3 days of renown booster and 3 alpha packs.

Thanks! I've been playing for over 100 hours but I was just never quite able to get to top position
---
Go have a heated gamer moment somewhere else buddy. 
---
God I loved tribes.
---
Honestly I probably should have included them too. But they’re more I’d just fraggers, they’re biggest benefit is they have an amazing gun (arguably the best gun on defence) and they’re beefy, do the cam just take fights for days. They are fun to play, but from a meta perspective I hate those two as they add little tactically. 
---
Sigh...
---
He's saying the knife has no lag, unlike Dokk's gadget. Just like how he said "a 6-inch blade never loses reception" in his operator video.

Nice on though.

lol was just to get better screenshot
---
Saved for research purposes.
---
I like the new Hibana but she looks a lot more anime and less siege. She's really out of place next to all the other operators.
---
It is much more comfortable. 1984 my man. 1984. 
---
I think they already said that this would never happen, but I could be wrong.
---
so i just have to pray that it goes up before the challenge ends?
---
Theres walls where if you shoot them with Ash's breaching round, it will break the other side of the wall but not break it all the way through

It’s from the “fan kit” - I think it’s official, but I’m not sure,

Why does it matter? Should they do the same for ranked with those under level 30?

What about maestro and alibi? They have the exact same problem tho

Nothing budget about this.

Sir you just shot a McDonald’s camera with an C7E what do you have to say in your defence

“I hereby sue Ubisoft for encouraging shootings of cameras with Military ARs”
---
Valkyrie cams also don't stick to some surfaces and just bounce right off, some of the fans in the corridors you can stick cams to, some you can't

No but if you want the operators, there are Y2 &amp; Y3 operator bundle. 
---
Jokes on you I received my N word pass way back in 2017.

Mira, her vector is a absolute unit of a gun and the strats are endless

It really depends on who you think you will play more.

Lol I’d love for you to say that to me irl

Probably. Or try reseting your console or Internet. I didn't do those but it might help

&gt;watch kill cam
---
&gt;puck landed in an entire different room and still killed me
---
I'm sorry but FUCK YOU
---
No. That’s not how it worked. When you track cav it tracks her but when she used silent step it wouldn’t ping. However that ability has been nerfed. What I believe is going on here is the person is standing next to a mute jammer. I’m not 100% if this works but if that’s not it then your game just glitched
---
i say change the recoil, her gun is too fast and irl the g36 should had been the more precise of the two. also it doesnt help that even if you dont aim, you will problably get a headshot....how many times have you seen this ? just pay attention to ashes kills, its almost always a headshot from a BLIND BURST
---
Because people are always looking for things to whine about
---
That ability has been merged
---
ok i will try that thanks for helping
---
Which operator has that shotgun
---
Blame the hitboxes. Not like Gridlocks propably the easiest character to hit.
---
I so want to see one of these in game!
---
The losses are meant to matter, if you are consistently getting beaten then the system is working by putting you down. If you are good enough to progress through the ranks, then you will. The issue is with the people losing \~1000, which Ubisoft is addressing.
---
Truth but at least complain about something that actually has an effect on your gameplay 😂

You know the same thing. Couple of crouch spammers here, couple of MnK's there, getting shot even when I was in cover.

Too long, didn't read; Hail Satan.

basic rainbow six siege
---
168 hrs with a single operator. Wow
---
Not for the price, no, but I think the microtransactions that make up for the price are way worse than if the game just costed money.
---
It'd be cool if the projections matched depending on what weapon she had equipped. Even though I think she is very strong at the moment, it just bugs me how they cant be changed. The only reason I think it would be problematic to implement is because we're all used to the bright red and green decoys already; it might lead to her being too confusing. I know personally it'd be really frustrating. Not to mention the incomprehensible amount of time it would likely take to implement.
---
*times &amp; yeah make fun of someone with differing opinions to yours, it highlights your vast intelligence

New for sure. She actually looks Japanese now. The old one she looks white. As a Japanese American, I welcome the change.

What was it? I don't remember.

There's been fps that have the option to use those controls between Goldeneye and Halo CE. Not as popular as Halo but definitely existed.

Usually once you have better game sense/aim you can get the cav only, but if you are over or under a cav interrogating, I usually just aim at the teammate to prevent the interrogation
---
Kind of I think idk
---
Nothing will beat the year 1 uniforms they have to cav cap hibana and echo. Those were actually different and worth having now the uniforms are just recolors of the default which sucks.

time to use reddit search....

Is there a game EA has touched that we can safely say wouldn't be better without their meddling?

Ubisoft Support is probably the way to go.

This sounds like something someone of the elite would say. What are you trying to pull here?

All operator profile pictures are photoshopped, but she looks Japanese now as she should.

Yes

Yea I play on Xbox and I'll try it soon. Thanks!

Thank you! I've been wanting this for so long. Reminds me of Advanced Warfare.
---
It is indeed true unfortunately. Outback &gt; fortress
---
As a general rule of thumb, if your teammate is downed with 1 or more enemies on them, they werent going to survive anyways so if a stray bullet hits them they cant be mad.
---
oh, really? if that ability has been nerfed my game must be glitching, because they don’t have a mute. demit 
---
Sneky ninja 
---
Ash doesn’t have 1080 RPM, a 50-bullet mag, impacts, and a mobile alarm system that concusses your enemies.
---
She has a considerably less broken gun and less utility. People play her because she’s of no real use to her team besides killing. If you lose an Ash, you lose a gun. That’s it. Compared to losing a Hibana or something like that, that’s absolutely negligible.
---
Honestly, the ACOG removal didn’t do much—she’s just forced into a rushing role now. If Ubi wanted to really balance the G36C and the R4-C, they should’ve doubled the recoil that the R4-C has, because it has none as of now.
---
Yeah something similar to mirage from apex legends. Nothing to fancy but something useful. 
---
I'm pretty certain he's talking about Doom 1
---
Looool wtf is this

Thought the same thing. Hah they weren't that tough.

ive played quiet a bit of alibi, and while it is true that the whole "stand in place of your prisma" trick doesn't work as well as it used to, and putting them in windows and doors to block lines of sight and gather info is generally the best use, there is no doubt that using anything other than default cosmetics is a disadvantage, even if it is slight.  
---
I still do get kills by replacing my prisma with myself, which i couldn't do if i buy the pro league set.
---
The big thing i don't like is that if i want to look cool, i will be at more of a disadvantage than any other operator doing the same thing.   
---
also jjust from a business perspective, if they matched, i would be buying cosmetics like the pro league set but as i there's no point

I started gold 4 and dropped to bronze one. I drop at least 7 kills a game,mind you that's not great, but I'm not bad. People throw and to and I can't win.

I also never called you insane. In fact, I did say you were probably dropped on the head a few times. You have been a hypocrite though since *you* are going around calling people mindless idiots for not believing in your Billie Eilish conspiracy theory.

That mechanical keyboard is pure fucking r/asmr shit
---
Yeah, the same thing has been happening to me. I found casual mode easier because of how many smurfs are in newcomer mode.
---
I got a server disconnect in my first match, but we were losing since my teammates were blaming each other in their language( I assume they were premades), which lead to them playing even worse, so I was kinda happy for the disconnect, because I didn‘t get a loss for it.

I listen to music most the time if I'm in casual and just messing around, but when I get serious I pause it and crank my sound up lol

If you got 4 kills and an injure in YOUR welcome mat i would still count it as an ace

You’re getting DDOSed, idk why someone would do it in casual but people do it in ranked to avoid taking an L. Look up what DDOS stands for, I’m not about to type it out. It’s not Lag Swatching, Siege is server based.

My pro tip. Don’t use dmrs, people can say your bad for not using them all you want but the latency on them is insane and you will always be shooting way too much to get kills

ofc i can, point is you dont know this and play a game with fans at 10% speed, all components especially cpu get veeery hot in few moments, sensors still -27°so no cooling at all...this is serious risk.

\[an early version of part 3\]([https://imgur.com/a/gt8mX0d](https://imgur.com/a/gt8mX0d)) , after finishing this version I wanted it to make it look more like a 'family tree'. I also chose to exclude vanilla ops as descendants.
---
Feedback appreciated; how would you change some branches?
---
Yes I noticed this. Happened the other night and was very confused because of how fluid it use to be.
---
Gotta include the two stupid ass leaked new ones that are just Cav, Vigil,  n Glaz
---
should automatically do it, they should cost 500/1000/1500/2000 renown, if not contact ubisoft support
---
You can change it back to normal in the settings, they just changed the default to advanced (read the path notes or the big reminder once you log in!!)
---
Yeah, I was so close to Gold last season (didn't start playing ranked until like a month before the season ended) and I really wanted to get it this season - I placed Silver 1, only 50 points below Gold 4, but I quickly deranked to bronze 
---
You can change it from advance back to standard....

lmao you're just bad

fortnite building is inherently intuitive because all the structures are walls or 45 degree slopes and that makes for easy to make, but strong fortifications

You can take recordings on console and upload them directly to youtube. It's quick and easy, and I don't have to watch you struggle with your phone.

I don't know why this bug (in general) hasn't been fixed yet. I have been noticing this a lot more recently and it can be game breaking. I will shoot a hole in a wall, but it will be rubberbanding me and anyone else back nonstop. I have placed breaching charges next to them and everything else, but the wall still rubber bands everyone. Have seen it on Thermite charges as well, and also impact holes as defender. 
---
Mines SirJonnyBling lmao I’ll add you tonight I didn’t play last night much at all
---
That outback uniform for Mozzie is already in the game as well for Bandit. I cannot recall the name of it, but I have it equipped to Bandit at the moment. So they just took a uniform that was already created for another operator and copy/pasted it onto Mozzie and changed the color of his shirt. 
---
This is why I'm glad I held off on buying this year's pass. With the amount of glitches and exploits that had been popping up the last two seasons and the perceived lack of effort on things like quick fixes and quality cosmetics made me feel like giving thirty dollars to Ubisoft this time around would just be satiating their greed. This is coming from someone who has spent ninety dollars on the previous three season passes. I just couldn't get on board this time around.

That's why he pairs up with montagne. Montagne IS the shield

absolute game breaker. never playing again
---
I think skins should NOT give you any advantage or disadvantage. This being said her holograms should definitely mimic her actual looks (skins, headgear and probably also her loadout and weapon skins).
---
Its so that people know if they have other options or if it's just one before clicking in

I thought ddos means they overload your router. If that is what ddos is then we didnt get ddosed because my router is fine. But I'll look it up.

1. Knowing map knowledge is half the battle really.

What difficulties are you having? The advanced deploy system (now the new default) was widely accepted as improving usability and ease, and many players would change their settings to it; for these reasons it became the new default.
---
Think of it as selecting another weapon. It let's you pinpoint where it will be deployed instead of just 'doing it' and it also allows for you to cancel animations in case you need to.
---
If you would rather not get used to it and would prefer to just go back to the way you are used to, follow these steps. 
---
* Go into game settings
---
* Select 'Controls'
---
* Scroll down and find 'Gadget Deployment'
---
* Select 'Standard'
---
Hope that helped some.. 
---
How do they not planned to get caught using it so blatantly?
---
So it's not only me. Thanks for clarifying.
---
It means you kill someone that is rappelling im pretty sure
---
I Would argue that Anthem’s problems dont stem from it being published by EA. Its just typical looter shooter problems.

I don’t really think anyone came from Tachanka remember he got a face shield long after black beard was in the game.

I did just upgrade my interent, and my internet has no problem with any other online games, just siege. I always have over 100. In all my other online fps games its under 100. Maybe its just some glitch. IDK, just wondered if I was the only one
---
Fucking glorious LMAO
---
I tested it in the Game-Integrated Benchmark. Was locked at 60.
---
okay , this made my mind go dirty
---
I believe it’s when they are repelling and you kill them while they are repelling.
---
StOP beINg sOOo seXEEe
---
You get it when you kill someone rappelling. 
---
Shoot someone while they are in the air. Ie: rappelling on the side of a wall.

I wholeheartedly disagree. I use mine as a indication of improvement. Same with my W/L ratio. As a huge fan of statistics, removing this would most likely make me turn to other games.

If you want a seasonal K/D, make it seperate, its really not that difficult.

---
Wait...is this the real life?
---
It will probably sound extra stupid, but I'm 1) a girl 2) french with a stupidly obnoxious accent and I'm so, so fed up with voicechat because of that... And it seems like it is essential in this game as it's more "strategy" focused than the other shooters out here. I'm basically too anxious to be both a noob and a girl. This is why I never picked it up, although I sure hope one day I won't overthink stuff like that lol.
---
Lol thanks, was gonna change it to goose to match my Siege name but... I couldn’t figure out how :-:
---
Because for what ever reason they chose to make a 4x scope a 2.5x. Instead of adding an actual 2.5x.
---
Now that I have seen this, I will be very disappointed if we dont get a frogman op.
---
Not flexing just showing that there was a glitch in the system that there was two rainbow six but there was only supposed to be one
---
That's happened to me since switching to that specific scope. I swapped back.
---
smurfing, boosting, hacking.
---
but well.... i think if ranked gets "out of beta" its doomed. you just cant determine a players skill on the whole team.

sure its great if you have a consistent 5 stack. but who has that?

i dont know man

Virtue signalling is not cool, that's why.

Cool hope u get banned too for toxicity
---
Ahh yes you can see it burst on the last frame. Since it would take 2 bullets from the MP5 to break the shield (50hp shield) it seems that the the problem would be that the shields hitbox breaks after the 2nd bullet, causing the 3rd to kill, and the visual for the shields damage and breakage is delayed. 
---
You replied back, you couldn’t resist. I knew it had to do with dominance.

“Mr. Madison, what you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”
---
Are you joking? I’ve literally had this same thing happen to me, laughed my ass off with my friend who was in a party with me and was spectating. 
---
Sure but callouts don't have an easy calculable statistic.  This is the best they give us and it is at the end of the day a representation of one's ability to frag. 
---
I agree there. An ACOG with 4x at 50m is horrible to shoot cause it’s so close. A red dot with 2.5x is so much better for the engagements in Siege 
---
The doc didn't have enough time to finish defusing the bomb. That's why you guys won

It's probably better the first week with the season pass players rather than unlocked week with any troll who would get mad at shooting drones.

How toxic is it to want cheaters banned?

That was my first thought, but maybe it could be a way to repair holes in walls? Idk, just an idea.

I have that too. And the lebel skin for the mp5.And the alpha pack charm. Literally the most shit legendaries in the game lol

---
I don't think it counts as last-second when there's 2 minutes and 40 seconds on the clock.
---
Honestly, the movement might actually be the reason I can't get into Warframe. Its cool, but it ruins the game for me. Everytime I try to play a mission it always goes the same way: the 3 other people run ahead as far as possible, ignoring every enemy they can while I desperately try to keep up. If they can't ignore an enemy, they're just bullet sponges with annoying abilities. Then the boss gets shredded and we do it all over again. I like *fighting* the enemies, not glossing over them like trash

Ahem. I don’t know if you read my response to this persons post, because clearly you didn’t. I will relay it to you right here. “Hahaha. I’m all for both. I just feel like it’s a little unfair with all of the hate I’ve seen directed towards the ops solely for being women (I wasn’t kidding about seeing some dude say that Ubisoft needed to issue an apology for making an operator female btw. It’s crazy)”. I don’t know it what world that sounds like me agreeing with someone. I think men and women should be treated as equals. I don’t know why I’m trying to reason with someone who stated that women should be in the kitchen, though, because you’ve clearly made up your mind. 
---
Thankyou so much!
---
Not bad
---
&gt;different textures on a model.
---
This isn't a usual model though. Lord knows how they set it up, it could require a different model entirely for each combination (Hence why the shotgun doesn't appear either). I think it was mentioned during their stream, and I can't be arsed to search through the whole thing. If you search this sub you'll see plenty of people saying the same thing.  
---
Think about it too: Why would Ubisoft not make skins work with holograms? Skins are one of the main monetization systems in this game, and wearing one on Alibi gives you an immediate disadvantage, so no one would logically buy them. A company like Ubisoft would absolutely avoid such a case if they could.

Nice ace but those headshots are all luck.

Ahhh yes, shooting at rainbow six, the perfect metaphor for ubisoft.

I like to think it was a combination of luck and good crosshair placement. Definitely lucky 4 guys ran through the same door though lol. 
---
Ranked is nearly impossible to solo queue anymore
---
Since Mozzie is such a new op, it’s gonna take a bit of time till people get used to the defender drones. Also, I would suggest better communication, for example if you were mozzie, calling out every time you got a drone and preferably the location of where the drone was caught. Calling out that you got a drone SHOULD already give attention to your teammates to be more aware. Plus the drones have a white outline to show it’s a friendly, but I think that’s only when it’s being controlled and moving? Not sure about that statement. 
---
That looks scary

Thanks to 9starferret for helping me solve this. It seems that there is a visual bug that does not represent the damage done to the Shield. You can see the shield destroy on the very final frame. Since it would take 2 bullets from the MP5 to break the shield (50hp shield) it seems that the the problem would be that the shields hitbox breaks after the 2nd bullet, causing the 3rd to kill, but the visual for the shields damage and breakage is delayed which is why it looks like he shot through

Yeah, no. That page is before the game was actually released. He doesn’t have the K33 he has an AR33, L85A6, and he also has a shotgun.

No problem, enjoy the new season!

So?  That's great.  If you keep playing you will easily improve it, so stop worrying.

Hiding information from players is dumb.  Solution isn't to hide from reality.

We’re bringing up maturity now? It’s a fact, Ubisoft has been incredibly lazy. Map reworks instead of new maps, the SMG-11 elite skin wasn’t added for 90 days, I could go on.

And they’re holding them hostage behind these so-called “updates.” The last update was a complete joke, especially when you consider that we got an attacker on defense and a defender on offense.

So Ubisoft is admiting that it's an unbalanced map. Why is it in the ranked rotation then?

I feel gridlock has potentional to be a little to strong. But for the most part i agree
---
I refuse to believe it
---
God damn that controller aim is better then me with a mouse

I'm from the northern US consistently being placed in 100+ ping LATAM servers. Shit's getting very annoying.

---
Well its basically copied from OW so yea.
---
Ok, If it’s a legendary why does it look like shit?
---
u should try casual on console
---
its the saltiest sweaty enviromment ever :D
---
Jager and Bandit bother list their ACOGs. Guess what happened? They’re still some of the most picked operators in the game. People don’t pick ops based on sights alone (some defensive sights might sway you to pick doc or rook etc, but the majority sites won’t), they pick because of usefulness. If you have a player who can frag, they’ll get 2-3 kills every round with Ash. Game sense doesn’t play as much of a role when someone can run n gun in a game that you shouldn’t be able to do that necessarily. 
---
Flair.
---
Get gud on the map. 
---
Both probably
---
Then stick to casual instead of being a dick. 
---
Wow he was blitz. He could have had it easy. Just use the flash, only the real one will cover their eyes
---
The issue seems to be players aren't being routed to the right servers. I'm in the northern US and am constantly matched with Brazilians in LATAM servers with 100+ ping.
---
I think it was me and my squad
---
ty my dude :D
---
Time to train then XD
---
this should be on ygs 
---
Ubisoft has to have done that deliberately so that if you got the timing right it would perfectly sync up. If not that’s fuckin incredible luck.
---
Yah, I guess the regular model of the gun looks nice 
---
Nah mate all we need is some trap ops on defense and global abilities on offense.

Nobody cares.

how can you main an operator who came out last week huh, you probably dont even know his age /s

This is very easy to replicate as it is the exact same as rappelling through any other window. You can not jump directly through the window, it has to be done while rappelling. I have done it multiple times, and have gotten a full team to do it as well. While funny this is definitely problematic as it leads directly into a couple sites, and even on one occasion I killed a defender standing against the window while testing. 
---
but why do they still dying from smoke's gas
---
Do you not understand that it's a super simple math equation?  If you actually play at a 1.5 kd pace it will go above 1.
---
Yes I know it's just that it was just his birthday and for some reason I thought that's when he died lol
---
This is the kind of content I want to see.

Yeah. It’s sweaty to use the best attachment and make jokes about balance changes.

Make sure someone else goes tachanka, just an extra measure to make sure your team definitely loses every match
---
Win a match with a full squad once but it’s actually 20 times I don’t know 
---
Imagine reposting someone's artwork and not giving credit. That's toxic.
---
I see a team of all fraggers with no breachers whatsoever losing to a defense that looks like it knew what it was doing and was probably set up pretty well.
---
Its almost like the game is about teamwork.
---

That's brutal... 20 squad wins in one week? I'm even lucky to get a squad together for a couple of games. 😞

I think that the year 2 is more worth it since year 1 operators are half price of year 2 operators. 
---
I watched this a couple of times without sound and was so confused. Thought I was missing some of the video hahah 
---
You do though. Along with the 4 weeks of exclusivity for the 8 ops, you get 8 exclusive headgear and uniforms, a universal gun skin, a charm, 2 extra challenge slots, 600 R6 credits(plus a bonus 600 if you had the previous pass), and a 10% discount in the store. Is all of that seriously not enough for you?

Not an ace but still nice 4K clutch.
---
Why though? 
---
Ok raging is a stretch but i realize what your saying but the fact that they did add her but it isn't even that forced it's not like she screams about  accepting fat people it's just how her character looks and i don't see a problem with it when it's done tactfully as in with gridlock. They didn't make a it a point to say she was fat they just did it.

I experience the same thing. Why don’t we start a community in PS4 for solo queue players who Wants to play the game like it should be, regardless of the rank. Anyway , everybody should go up if played correctly.
---
They didn’t tho

That was everything I could have ever hoped for

Honestly, you're rank shouldn't be based on how many games you win, but how well you play

In Seige, even if your're in a party, you can hear game chat. Depending on if your talking too much or your voice is annoying to them, they might feel negatively towards you. This is not an excuse fro team killing, they can just mute you, but it's a reason none the less. Either talk less, stay in a party, or move on.
---
Year 1 had the best premium headgear. Change my mind.
---
Look up the error code on Ubisoft support site
---
That sucks. Hopefully it picks up! If you need to reach out to a friend!! Feel better man.
---
I’ve seen that as well, but we play as Mira and cab, and usually wait until others are locked in to try and avoid being killed
---
Lol, I think that perfectly described me and my squad when we play.
---
Nomad from ghost recon
---
They can’t, they need to schedule it like everyone else to update the game, I do agree with including consoles though, that’s something that would help the dynamic on how characters are used
---
She's situational. 
---
Here will be other ops that are better picks.
---
Only use Clash if you are good at providing intel and coordinate well eith your teammates to have them get the kill.
---
If you can't do that you'll just be a hindrance.

No, they can. They can get the bug fixes out quicker, Microsoft or Sony doesn't take 45 days to approve changes, it's just not how it works.

---
I just like to clarify on this sub because if you start talking about sites and defuser it can be confusing for some people who play the other modes. Personally I feel bomb should be the only ranked mode since it's the most competitive, but that's not relevant to the discussion.
---
I'm pretty curious about the rework. Kafe is in a weird spot where it's almost competitively viable, but at the same time it's so far behind other maps that it will need a miracle to be fun again. The teaser they showed at invite looked nice, but I'll hold judgement until I play it a few times.
---
Advanced drone deployment then you don't need to get injured and can just shoot them

Lol you don’t need coms until platinum really. Gold and under is about fragging out. And the problem with console is that it’s not push to talk, so the com audio ruins the game audio. Solo queuing for a few seasons turns you into a way better player than you’ll ever get with a squad becuase it forces you to be good. I love solo queuing. I only com with my friends who I know are good about communicating 
---
Lowest I've ever gotten one was a 4.5%. Highest was... 87%?

In my 2 weeks of doing it, seems a lot better.

I got one at 4 once, and it was that unicorn charm thing

GG
---
My ping has been terrible since the update, but my friends are fine

I get kicked from CASUAL games for having a low K/D
---
Communicate a lot, give constant callouts. Know when to play agressive and when to play passive. Go behind a wall and reapear often, if the enemy stops focusing on you emerge with a gun and net one or a few frags.
---
Your job as clash should be to get intell and to make pushes hell. Much like meistros cams clash forces the attackers to put attention on her.
---
Donacdum, keep tabs on where you can get shot from and minimise those points.

Also, run the fuck away from capitao, the old man loves to cook turtles.

Ladies and gentlemen, we got 'em
---
Well you have to remember, it’s taking 45 days so that Ubisoft can get as many bugs and glitches seen at once, and then completely wipe them away, because if they released new patches for every single bug they find, that could slow them down for the next season, and then next season will have more bugs
---
Doubt it
---
no mute mains deserve to never have to deal with anybody else when selecting him &gt;:(
---
Do you know that good spot next to penthouse by the window?(on the map of the vid)
---
Map reworks are better than new maps until Ubi allows us to blacklist maps for comp and casual. There are like 12 maps in the map pool now and everyone has at least 3 maps they hate. I don't want there to be 20 maps with no blacklist because I'll never get to "master" a few specific maps and it'll be a constant cycle of learning new maps.
---
You can only buy for 90,000 renown sadly :(
---
HES INSANE
---
But some people want to play the game and not meme
---
Like I previously stated, most publishers and developers have no issue getting them out quicker. No matter how small or how big, one bug is one more than there should be.
---
I have been playing for two years, since Velvet Shell in specific. My K/D is currently 1.76 ranked, 2.19 casual.  W/L 1.78 Ranked, near 2.45 casual. Every single time I increase by 0.01 its a happy day for me. It feels like I have both improved an achieved something, which is why I wouldn't really agree with a statistical reset. To drop my stats by 0.01, it would take quite a few repetitive donuts to deal that damage. 
---
THANK YOU. IM NORMALLY NOT GOOD, I GOT LUCKY AF
---
how does one control the shotgun recoil on console?
---
I wholeheartedly agree it’s a shit gun skin, but maybe pair it with the trench Doc elite for *some* effect? Might get some use outta it then 
---
Only in copper.
---
I definitely wouldn't mind if the current Amethyst was a skin, but they really shouldn't advertise it as a gemstone skin when it's completely different from the others.
---
That's the issue I and others have with it. You buy any other gemstone skin (or if you have Obsidian from whatever gave it) you get a "shiny" blocky skin.
---
If you buy Amethyst you get a weird sandpaper fade thing that looks completely different on each gun.
---
&gt;New leaning. This is mostly opinion but I don't understand why it was changed. I know it was for QE spamming but I never had a problem with that. I'm convinced the new system was designed for coppers and console players where they were limited in movement. I also noticed that shots that should not be hitting are killing people. I have died to people not even peaking or aiming at me. I have also done the same to others. I get a head shot when i clearly missed. I don't know if this has to do with the new leaning, but I thought I would include it.
---
[This video shows exactly why lean spamming is a problem.](https://youtu.be/FoLXUs46uWY?t=154)
---
&gt;New maps in the map pool. Why? What is the logic behind putting a brand new map into the ranked map pool. I have played I think 4 or 5 Outback games and won 1 of them. Maybe I still would have lost if I knew the map, but I can guarantee to you that I would have done better if I knew it. They should put it into all modes except ranked until about a month.
---
There are two main things to consider with the ranked map pool. First, many players refuse to play the casual rule set. In order for them to experience the new map, they will only be able to play it in ranked.
---
Second, and more importantly, there isn't any real benefit to players for the new map to be left out of ranked. Casual will never be taken as seriously as ranked so long as the consequence of winning or losing is irrelevant (at least publicly); this prevents any matchmaking system from having any hope of consistently matching evenly skilled teams and thus any data regarding map balance from casual will be nigh useless. Thus, keeping it out of the ranked rule set will not help Ubisoft determine whether the map is balanced for ranked. Thus, the map will eventually make it into ranked regardless whatever casual data exists.
---
To go one step further, what would keeping the maps out of ranked for an arbitrary amount of time accomplish? If your goal is to not have to play the map in ranked prior to learning it, you can choose not to play ranked until you learn the map through casual, discovery casual, terrorist hunt, or custom games; there's no reason to prevent players who either are comfortable with the map on day 1 from the TTS or don't care about having a map they don't really know in ranked from having the opportunity to play it. Then if you were to do that, you'd actually likely have a better ranked experience as many teams would already have their initial ranks when you started in ranked yourself rather than you queuing with everyone at the start of the season.
---
&gt;Map Pick: We all know what this is. I hate to make this comparison, but like Call of Duty. Simply 2 maps with a random if those two aren't wanted. 
---
There are currently 13 maps in the ranked pool. If I assume there are 5 favorite maps, the likelihood that one of those two maps is offered is 64.1%. You would literally see one of the favorite 5 maps nearly 2/3 of the games you play (plus you'd get one of those top 5 maps 38.5% of the times the team chose random on map selection). Even with the slight variety among those 5 maps, that's an awfully frequent chance of getting one of those maps.
---
This what gonna happen if they nerf Mozzie.
---
Thought it was 100,000 renown
---
Literally unplayable
---
What? No Far Cry 5?? smh my head
---
Yes, liked this map more than a lot of the year 2&amp;3 maps. Don't like outback either.
---
yeah,I  had used that skin,before my friend said "the shape of the gun is like a banana."
---
You have to understand that not all bugs are immediate issues, and I’ll say this, it depends on the game, with how Ubisoft is working on and updating rainbow six siege, they can’t really afford to fix every little bug that comes out, as for rockstar they can because their updates are spaced out quite nicely, and because of the size of say, rdr2, it’ll take quite a while to find a bug, and even then it’s probably just a bug in a back corner of a map
---
I think all 5 of the players in that clip are coppers
---
I'm now running into a problem where my teammates are shooting my drones when attacking because they think they're hacked. Like, can you not see that my drone isn't covered in red LEDs?
---
Probably trolling on casual lmao. You’ve just been in bad luck.
---
But wait.... British Men lose smg scope
---
o ok didn't know
---
Then that's bullshit 
---
r/beetlejuicing

Lol I had the opposite of this happen to me earlier today. I stole her drone and as soon as I got on it, she rushed obj and one tapped me.
---
Good question tho, never really tought about this! Thanks for the answers! 
---
My question is how you didn't down thermite at point blank range with a shotgun
---
they are sounding like Bethesda to me (they also have done this multiple times since fallout's new game came out). And my friend who mods ark (thru the steam workshop) also has gotten banned by battle eye just a week ago (note he doesnt actually play ark just uploads mods from the dev kit). What is going on with battleeye right now
---
I mean for the attacker everyone knows that peek
---
Because everyone who plays on PC is Pro League material
---
I’m not dissing your main, but high key she sucks dong man, she’s only good with a coordinated team and that’s pretty rare 
---
Only joking. But could you? 👀 
---
All these vigils but none use their ability. Smh lol
---
I’m sure that’s what balances him. He can already capture 3/5 starting drones, enjoy him now before they nerf him down to 2. 
---
I had the same issue happening with me earlier and restarting the game didn’t change anything in my case atleast. I just kept playing while talking in party chat until a few matches went by and the issue resolved itself. 
---
I have Spotify on 5% and it helps me focus better than silence.
---
Nah R6 has a crazy weird FOV and camera, its why shields are kinda broken
---
Good job. Place your barbed wire.

Probably where they got the concept even though he's korean smh

I only started after it was removed, but if they got maps like Favela in rotation..

---
i meant kaids shotgun specifically
---
You shot them chest/shoulder and then died
---
it’s not an elite lmao
---
Ubi gonna do what ubi does best. Make mistakes
---
Personally I think If they changed Glaz’s ability to shoot through windows and somehow made runouts harder, it would be a much more appreciated map.
---
It does and it should work after an hour or so I guess
---
I thought after her nerf she was no longer useful. Then I ran into a player who destroyed us with Clash. So yeah.. in the right hands and with some coordination she’s pretty decent. The fact her gun is no longer a burst helps too. 
---
I love listening to music while shotgun or blitz rushing in casual. These strats need to be executed quickly, and with no over-thinking (of which i often am guilty tho), and music helps me in that. In these situations, if you get flanked you're dead, and there's no reason to fight it or even care about it because you're in **casual**. Please try it, it's waay more effective than it should be.  
---
Listening to music in ranked is just taking away one or 2 of your 3 ways of detecting other players (sight, hearing and friendly callouts).
---
yeah
---
I think that's the whole point he was trying to make, making it randomized in casual keeps it more fresh by not making you play the same sites every game.
---
U N P L A Y A B L E
---
not sure if your taking about another post or this picture 
---
Yes please. I barely get Brazil map too
---
Its super easy to mute people. I honestly wait til they do something annoying because more often than not people will just say useful bits of intel. But I’m ready to pull the mute trigger. 
---
Honestly more annoying listening to 12 year olds giggling about shitty Trump jokes than the ragers. 
---
I knew what it was as soon as I saw the title and I still got so excited !
---
As much as I'd like to see a solo (or solo/duo) queue, it unfortunately wouldn't work unless the game prevented teams of 3 or 4 from queuing. Otherwise, squads of 3 and 4 would never get the players they need to round out their team since those players would all be in the solo/duo queue (even if you gave single and paired players the option to join the larger queue, I doubt there would be many who would choose to enable that option).
---
Personally I'd like to see a 5-man queue and a less than 5-man queue to at least prevent the teams of incomplete squads from going against potentially very coordinated full squads. It wouldn't be as game-changing as your suggestion, but it also wouldn't leave teams of fewer than 5 in a position where they can't find teammates through matchmaking.

Wait. Is that a thing?

I bought the game like two weeks ago and it’s been... interesting.

The last bullet was aimed directly at his head because of the recoil.
---
Cry about it, there are far more oppressing matters in the game of r6s other than a “/3”
---
If that makes you upset and not the terrible hit registration or the shitty sound design than you should play a different game.

I feel like this season especially is being really hard to solo queue and win games.

What

I literally just posted this

It gives me more confidence and let’s me focus more on shooting than listening.
