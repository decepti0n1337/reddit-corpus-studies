All except gridlocks have the same
---
---
---
I can agree with this. It doesn’t need a rework but it could use a Clubhouse level buff. They turned Clubhouse into one of the very best maps with those changes. For Oregon they need to do something about big tower
---
I just run it on most setups and it's working out really well. I do think that the perk that allows you to get 2 explosive gadgets should not include claymores though. If I were to change anything about them it's that.
---

---
And maybe if you shoot the claymore before it goes off to be like in Siege, it just fizzles out and it ends there. Right now shooting the claymore makes it blow up so people without EOD even if they manage to react and shoot the claymore when they see it will just end up killing themselves.
---
4D sound coming from my headphones tbh.
---
I may be most picked op in the game, and was broken with acog, but I still need it
---
Ubi can’t fix toxicity. That’s a player base problem.
---
Lmao nothing I just haven't heard anyone say it I a while it took me by suprise
---
I'm SO JEALOUS.. this would go perfectly with my banana shotgun skin,,, also dick joke
---
She’s not elite or anything but she’s really solid. When she came out I thought she would end up being on the weak side but I can confidently say I was wrong about that
---
You got them nosephones so you can smell operators coming?
---
F
---
you did an amazing job mate, no need to shame yourself. The fact you single-handedly win the game is undeniable!
---
Gridlock’s gadget has so many more uses though especially now that ranked is bomb only
---
Thank you!
---
The only legendary i have that isn't a charm is a headgear
---
You can bet 250 bucks, witch should get a protitute to have sex with you.
---
this is my fav charm and i wish i could sell every other charm to buy skins, i love this, you degenerate zoomer lol
---
Yeah someone also died to a beach charge
---
Thanks
---
Are you okay?
---
I was more suggesting that to stop drones coming into the toilet you can use a mute jammer to secure your privacy but a claymore works also maybe if a child was to walk past
---
**P90**
---
wait, why do those recruits have different hats?
---
And that’s why I want an Acog on Tachankas SMG
---
Yeah, nice. But maybe fix the game first
---
It’ll be destroyed easily it’s only got 1 health
---
Reddit isn't the place to ask for advice, go to Ubisoft tech support
---
It took forever for the post to actually go through.
---
A perv with a drone next to you? Better go for both. And throw a live nade through it for good luck
---
Well you gotta commemrate them for their speed and efficiency
---
Congrats

Yeah lol. Fuze is a joke and definitely needs some buffs. I 100% agree with making him 2/2

D R O N E. Drone early and often. ACOGs are your best friend and having a hard breach can mean winning the game
---
"*you filthy degenerate scu... wait wrong sub*"
---
I think if they were slightly more visible he wouldn’t be an issue at all.
---
I'm going with lucky
---
My friend sold his tablet so get better aim from OSU, it’s the only reason why I have this thought.
---
Your connection went to shit, you can see all the symbols in the top right light up.

As consistent as crunchy peanut butter.

You can turn chat off

That's why I only use mozzie to hack twitch drone and destroy attacker drone
---
I think its the resemblance to Harry. Might just be a coincidence since this is an old map idk
---
Yeah, lesion is pretty strong. We had better nerf Ella again to be safe /s
---
Well, every aspect of buying games seems to come down to personal preference.
---
In my opinion, though, I value more my account than the game itself. The game can be bought again (especially with those huge discounts when the game is like 5 dollars), but your account can never be, all your progress and history will be lost

---
Ela still needs a buff to her Scorpion Evo 3 A1 don't get me wrong but her gadget would be pretty good if Lesion was brought down to her level.
---
Pick &amp; Ban Phase needs improvement especially on both the Ranked and Competitive side. Whether that’s additional bans on both Attack/Defense or grouping Operators under specific categories. Ex. Hard-Breacher Ban: Thermite, Hibana, Maverick, being one is selected. Basically, grouping Operators who share similarities in both gadget and game-play would have their own specific ban, instead of limiting two on each side.
---
Is there any video game skin that "is" worth 20 bucks?

Not the place to ask for help, go to Ubisoft tech support

I've had to use the Ubi support to get passed the two factor authentication after getting a new phone. You should be able to do the same.

Ps4?

I feel like he needs to lose the Intel part of them, sound queues alone would be enough for him without having the ability to pinpoint an attacking operators location.

As someone who plays the SHIT out of Ella seen my her get nerfed again hurt lol. If they changed the recoil to be vertical instead of "bouncy" like some of the other SMG's I feel like it would be a good start. 
---
Though tbh I don't have all the answers and have no idea how to even begin making her balanced but not "frustrating"
---
Nah dude you clearly aimed... AT HIS FUCKING PRIDE AND SHOT IT TO OBLIVION
---
I don’t think the adapters are just for siege so its still legal to sell em
---
Fooking Genius Soights!
---
Time for a Killa style Tachanka elite skin.
---
Nope its Black ice gold charm
---
5 ft 11 vs 6ft
---
Magazine! \o/
---
How bout mod packs that have mods built for siege how come they can’t get them in legal trouble
---
Fair enough, speed loaders are clips
---
Needs more acog.
---
The nerf is unintended, they were trying to redo the cloaking and how visible both lesion and Echo's gadgets are. This probably hints at a new potential gadget that cloaks for Y5. They probably won't go through with the nerf though until they settle on something they're happy with.
---
There’s your answer.
---
From the Oversiege Team?

Hate on me for it, but I’ve legitimately hated fortnite ever since I tried it in season 2

Back when the Elite skins were released and people were asking why can't I mix and match just like other skin bundles? The answer came back because the other skins would interfere with the unique animations the Elite skins have been tested to do properly for the victory screen.
---
You can get it all with renown so why does it matter
---
It's NONSTOP nut not NO nut.
---
its ubi.
---
It’s a fucking Maxim gun, why wouldn’t he be jealous.
---
No the other events in siege have been brilliant like Doktors Curse and the April Fools one and yeah in ranked it takes in account your current MMR for next season so say I got to gold 3 in ember rise it would take that into account when ranking in shifting tides
---
What about it. You can buy it all with renown.
---
I always thought it was because of the cosmetics clipping but honestly idk
---
Depends.
---
**I damn sure as hell DO NOT want something like the elite twitch drone camo**.
---
5 min in for fuze GPS. Sorry
---
Xbox uplay it also happened when the get all year 2 operator bundle came out
---
*Loads Mp5* Rook would like to know your location
---
Thicclock*
---
she does. But she is still in motion. Ela mines have motion sensors so even if she hides from cams she cannot hide the fact that she is still moving.
---
That's what I said, but didn't use the term cosmetic clipping after all it has been years since the launch of elite skins so the exact term slipped my mind.
---
Always love watching console players play well, always amazes me how they do it with those fineky little knobs
---
I see no problem with the G L I T C H L E S S game
---
Im down
---
elite uniform includes headgear as well. You can't wear it separately.
---
You left out crying babies and screaming arguments with their wives in foreign languages.
---
Agreed, music is wack
---
I hope they do, because it gives them a good reason to cash grab on impulsive people which is a pretty scummy business practice no matter what you're selling. Exclusivity is a subjective feeling that ultimately goes away
---
Lol fuckin retard
---
What's the Smoke uniform?
---
Free Shipping
---
Well not nesseraly talker ops like sledge would be headshoted less, maybe not in low skill games but in higher elos players basically always aim on the head which with sledge and kaid and I think Amaru would be chest level
---
No it’s just console
---
Depends on how good you are
---
Iam sorry for my behavior
---
Try fitting that under a door
---
Agreed. And if someone poses a "they're &lt;10% of the population," the largest racial group in Brazil is white, then pardo (multiracial), then black, and Caveria is almost definitely pardo. Capitao could also be pardo, just having more African ancestry, however this doesn't negate the fact that this would be Pardo overrepresentation in Siege while there is no white Brazilian operator. 
---
It would be absolutely fine for a white South African operator, and hopefully Ubi does this and represents an Afrikaner.
---
More like BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM Round Win Hostage eliminated
---
Mira, I'm a Mira main :)
---
If you know the maps really well, she can be unstoppable
---
Here at Team Rainbow we aim for inclusivity in every sense of the word.
---
I think you can do it in a day
---
it is okay mr.cia
---
Ah yes I love the sound of fresh cluster charge in the morning
---
A day wtf
---
I did it on friend's account only for 2-3 days. But he didnt played a lot and I got a lot of elo for every match. I played like only 3-4 matches every day on his account.
---
Usually if the person is an asshole. Today I was playing with a 4 stack and the one random was carrying.  I got stuck in a 1v 5 and he initiated a kick on me which of course didn't go through and then we kicked him. I'd rather lose with friends than win with assholes.
---
This is the cod community being upset about their game modes having an MMR system lol
---
How much elo did you get per match ?
---
Damage increase
---
I can definitely see down the line both teams getting 4 bans. Right now I think it's kinda problematic since you can wipe out almost all the hard breachers or almost all the anti-gadger ops ect
---
Nice. darn talk to text
---
The whole point of seasonal skins being a limited time offer is so people play the game and grind out renown for them, not to make impulsive purchases. Changing that would defeat the whole purpose of ubi trying to encouraging people to play the game more.
---
It's a good start but him still being able to pinpoint attackers locations with his gu mines tells me that Ubisoft doesn't want to balance him seriously.
---
Kinda looked like black Jeremy Clarkson to me
---
I used to main Mira, however I play with a group of friends that are far better than I am, and one of them started maiming her, so I switched to  frost
---
Yeah ik. Or maybe I can cut them with a saw and then glue them onto the mask so that they fit.
---
Nice.
---
Good choice btw
---
They'll wait for data after every nerf. They won't just throw the hammer at him instantly
---
Nice one, but it's a meme, moderators only delete my memes?
---
I got the kt camo which imo looks a bit better and fitting
---
that's not true in siege, but true in a game like overwatch where kills are much harder to secure, in siege one player can literally kill on average 3-4 people in one round just because their aim/positioning is better than their rank.
---
Worse as you climb the ranks. She's pretty much useless at plat or above.
---
At least you didn't get a shitty ass charm
---
She is not really a very good operator. She is good against inexperienced or bad players that don’t communicate or coordinate, but against any experienced team that uses comms or coordination she isn’t good because she becomes an operator with weak guns and a gadget that is worthless.
---
This is fake
---
I just use my pistol when i see one +accuracy 80%
---
I can confirm that

Tweet Ubisoft on Twitter. Try get their attention
---
It'd be difficult for the game to process. The reason they do it is to prevent overuse of a feature like this so the game doesn't run slow. It's a good idea but with the amount of combinations it would have to process that's too much for the server. I'll give an example: Alibi has 5 available headgears and 5 available outfits. That's 25 different combinations the server would have to process. And I know there's probably way more headgears and outfits so I wouldn't doubt them never implementing this
---
use your jammer
---
I upvoted to keep your karma safe...
---
But In all seriousness, all other operators are good at usually at least two things (twitch, tachanka, doc, zofia, ela, lesion, caveria, gridlock, capito, etc) or their gadget is handy in almost all situations and can be used easily (rook, ash, thatcher, iq, thermite, bandit kaid, etc) with the exception of warden who is good when all the enemy team decides to push in and rush plant. But since most operators are good at two things or are good at one overarching thing, a simple scan can say “don’t rush” which essentially disables almost all situations in which you can use the gadget. Also, casual players don’t really communicate so he’s good in ranked but not in casual. He needs more viability, and this could be what gives him that
---
I did twice I hope they notice
---
ok, it's the highest rank they have then.
---
Yep its part of the instant gratification many people want in video games nowadays just for turning it on i want 100% completion and every cosmetic item ever conceived.
---
You put two of the ADS next to the kids bedroom window. That way, they will waste a throwable, destroy the ads, and then waste another.
---
We've been over this boy, literally every week.
---
A, no self sufficient ops in the game, and B, no sharing utility between attack and defense, and C, this will do more harm than good.
---
And don't tell me that Glaz and ying were self-sufficient. They are not. Their self-sufficiency was pulled months ago.
---
ok boomer
---
You are right. But it is possible that they did copy it. They have a history of coping siege operators
---
That frown was in all seriousness.
---
I replied on main comment.
---
If you want to make warden better, make his gadget more forgiving. He, by design, doesn't fit into this meta because smoke meta is gone.
---
If that happened to me I would be so pissed. I couldn’t lose lesion zofia and jackal
---
Oh ones still loading in
---
I never said they were self sufficient, now did I?
---
I am pissed I bought the deluxe version and they still get taken away
---
I think the biggest issue people have is that there are some really good skins that are only in packs, so there's a good chance you'll never get them. If they just made those available for renown I wouldn't have any issues with packs
---
People on that sub are really mad that Skill Based Matchmaking exists. The funniest argument against it was that you cant just come online and farm some noobs, you actually need to play well to get good stats. Sure, it has its disadvantages, but complaining about fair matchmaking, smh

That is the truth. And he is the best counter to ying
---
The scorpion is the only primary in game without a horizontal recoil diamond making it random. It does the 3rd lowest damage of any weapon in game and mediocre fall off range. This together makes it the worst gun on game. 
---
For killing multiple people with the fo12 that is currently possible. But despite actual statistics and data which they themselves own the new nerf will kill the gun. It only has one positive trait over the other shotguns and that's the fire rate. It does the 3rd lowest damage per pellet, is terrible at range for damage even with the extended barrel. And only has average spread. With the new nerfs you'll be penalized even more so for trying to take advantage of the one thing it has going for itself. Your damage and spread are much more penalized making the gun one of the weakest of all shotguns now.
---
 As an Ela main we don't need her 9th nerf. Especially console who has barely played her since her 5th nerf. She needs buffs and she needs them now because if she isn't buffed you'll never see her ahain.

Reading clearing isn't your strong suit.

The artist has drawn these over the past year or so, and is just now starting to post them on reddit.
---
It would make total sense to do it like this. Once you buy the elite you can also choose the animation for the op without using the skin. You still have to buy the elite but at least you can have more variety
---
She is best girl
---
It‘s a repost but don‘t worry there are a lot of reposts
---
Lol if u dont like him dont watch him
---
Probably u r just a fuckin jealous silver
---
Marley is the same joke every video. It goes like this:
---
*Marley hits a crazy shot*
---
*Dom overreacts with lots of “what?!” and “Mate!”
---
*Marley wheezes*
---
So what if I am a silver? I’m actually a normal
---
Plat, but either way, the dude is a joke of a R6 player. He has the voice of someone who wants to hop off a bridge, and the gameplay of a wannabe Beuolo, or however you spell the kids name.
---
Probably, or they just spend 90% of their lives at Chick-fil-A, especially Tux
---
You can stop worrying about stopping now.
---
Realism &gt; balance I suppose? I understand people wanting more logic and realism in the game but you can't sacrafice balance. It'd be pretty OP if capitao could throw all 4 bolts into obj and burn 2 ADS and the bolts still do their job while the ADS is now gone. Then we'd just have captaio as #1 pick with all frag ops just storming obj like live artillery.
---
Lmao you’re not wrong, but that shit has grown on me. Makes me crack up whenever Dom gets pissed at everything Marley does. That’s your opinion tho man, completely understandable.
---
Blue on Blue -10
---
You can stop worrying about you can stop worrying about grenades now
---
Flick my (minge) ying
---
It is a repost and it got downvoted into oblivion the first time it got posted.
---
What is your rank
---
[removed]
---
Wasn’t even coppers. It was silvers
---
Cursed smoke looks like a hyper realistic peashooter.
---
I'm guessing they're here only for the duration of the event, since it's so "limited".
---
Idk why ur getting downvoted for asking a question but if the defuser gets deactivated in any way the round ends
---
Thank you for reminding me of this cute comic, i love it
---
I mean atleast you are consistently inconsistent
---
Poor chankaa
---
Kawabunga it is
---
I would rather people don’t go afk especially during a rank game. If people know they will have an operator they like, they are more likely to go afk afk and don’t stay to give callouts.
---
What rank
---
That’s how you get TK’d
---
Loglicly there in the same unit sooooooo
---
Yeah I agree but still this feature would do more good than bad. Coming back with an operator you know how to use to help your teammates is much better
---
He is awesome ! I just got a triple kill with Commando 9 and I hijacked some twitch drones.
---
2 minutes? Damn, SEAU servers must just suck then cuz my fastest queue time is normally around 10mins unless it’s casual or stacked.. maybe it’s just me..
---
I have a Maverick one with M4 and 1911
---
Nice! Glad you’re enjoying him, I consider Mozzie one of the best ops added in a long time. Perfectly balanced, nothing too weak, nothing too strong. He’s a lot of fun imo.
---
Holy shit that's long. I'm on NAEAST
---
Ubi can’t really do anything. People use adapters so the console thinks it’s a controller. This is a problem Microsoft and don’t have to fix
---
Actually a lot of my ranked games are like this. 5 stacks of champions from eu or Asia when I'm solo q as plat 1. Server lock needs to be a thing.
---
But why do you need something limited? Why can't someone who started playing today not get the chance to buy a weapon skin? What about having it and someone else not having it because they didn't play then makes you feel better?
---
Michael Scott: OH how the TURN TABLES
---
There was well over a minute left in the round
---
9/10 is definitely a massive overstatement. I can see the reason for if you are not skilled or knowledgeable enough to know how to deal with a clash you would want to ban her. But she's not overpowered. She's situationally good. There's plenty sledge could have done to win that fight, you just need to be ready for the spin tricks, go prone and hold ads on her wait for her to turn around and just headshot her. She can't see where you are when she's facing the wrong way. If she's alone just keep walking and melee the shield. With Kali being in the game soon too, she would be useless since the sniper bats the shield away like a melee.
---
It's understandable being frustrated by her, but if you refuse to learn how to beat her you will never succeed.
---
She looks like she's gonna sing a pop song
---
it's gay to use mouse keyboard on console until the cross platform
---
I normally have menu music at 50/100 but I turned it down to 20 for the event.
---
Agree
---
Ooooooo sorry I missed that part, teach me to wake and watch... and comment.
---
Ah makes sense, a lot more people on your end then. I hope your issue gets resolved
---
I agree but sometimes you gotta take it and continue on
---
Just play in pc, playing a shooter on console is already a big nono
---
This would also profit ubi. You bought an elite for someone? No real point in getting the new cosmetic sets for them.
---
I just can’t imagine going AFK so often to warrant this feature. Maybe it’s because I can play a wide variety of ops but I don’t care who I get when I get a random op, as long as it’s not clash.
---
My friend made his team learn spacing the hard way, if you were all grouped up, he chucked a nitro in the group, if you didn't scatter, you died
---
If it’s available all the time it devalues the skin, it’d be like if Glacier came back, people who already had it would feel cheated that some new player gets a skin that they got early in the games release or years season releases.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
“You’ve been spotted intensifies”
---
What is it with this sub and titles that cause pain when reading.
---
ive had this happen to me before. These 2 guys have griefed every ranked game ive had with them w this strat. Its honestly so stupid
---
What platform?It’s not possible on PS4.
---
“After Jagers agog is taken he takes his anger out on those around him”
---
No worries! It's been a while since I've played, but I believe you're right in what you're describing. But here, it seems just to be where he placed the defuser, what looks about half onto the destructible wall, so it may have counted it as the defuser being removed from the room as soon as it was placed down? Hard to tell, but definitely a glitch of some sort
---

---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepost
---
Whoa really? I did not know this.
---
I didn’t mean to put that how do I delete
---
nah, this game is not for being afk. You should pick your op depending on the team and map, not just if you main them or not. Just my opinion
---
Jealous Jager... This makes me sad. 
---
Great picture btw :D
---
Been saying it for ages
---
Yep. It also does about thirty other things.
---
Agreed, once rewatched I see what you're saying.
---
And?
---
Yea, but what's the point in playing ranked when half my games I have a 10% chance to win cause people can't stay on their own servers? Worst part is the games that I do beat them I only get like 10 elo because they're only champion on eu servers. Just make it a regional rank or add region lock.
---
# Soviet Anthem plays
---
g432
---
Pounds or kg?
---
that looks like AKs in counter strike with that counter strafing
---
I disagree because I main her and on some objectives she is next to useless with all the flank opportunities. But I understand why some people may find my favourite turtle operator to be less than fun to play against
---
PC player here . No it doesn’t
---
This is so cringe. Weaboos are obsessed with fan fictions
---
have you tried using valkyrie cams?
---
They are in full colour and have no annoying overlays
---
Yeah I know I do as well but it doesn’t take you 2 minutes to pee. If you have to pee either go before the selection screen or wait, select your operator and then you have time to go pee.
---
they are verycomfy. iv been using em for 3 years and i still love em
---
Why is everyone like: serves your Right, should’ve just shot him. Like what! I say go for the knife whenever you can, it’s FUN, maybe other people should try it
---
Regardless, I was trash and got dunked on.
---
Increasing the number of bans will just solidify Jackel, Blitz, Montaigne, Thatcher/Echo, Cav, Clash, Bandit as the main bans. The reality of the ban system is that not many players really know how to use it effectively and ban comfortably who they know everyone else will agree with.
---
Reviews say the bass dominates everything else
---
What was the point of the event? I played it once and got less renown than usual and it was hostage
---
Blitz
---
Thanks Jager. You will always be better that wamai
---
Let me get that for you
---
I google what I give a shit about, I ask what I’m curious about but ok with not finding out
---
They're blue tinted and the angles I want don't necessarily work with the angles her camera gives but yeah I'll try them
---
This makes me mad, I just woke up why are your making me mad already!
---
This shit happens on PC as well. Dont act superior
---
It already has like a 1.5x zoom. Make it higher! Keep those sights!
---
Vigil has quite the view.
---
For the billionth time it’s not Ubisoft’s fault holy shit
---
Username checks out
---
That defeats the whole purpose of bans.
---
You ban, for the entire match, and work on a workaround to either deny the enemy those ops or to remove any counters to one strat of yours. You ban lion and nomad cause they are a menace, you ban Thatcher because you want your defender utility to prevail. You ban Maestro so you can bring back the smoke meta. You don't just ban for the opponent. You ban for the benefit of your own team. Bans mid-game defeat the purpose of tactical ban and just make it easy to ban. The uncertainty is a part of the game and you have to predict what players at that rank would commonly execute and you execute accordingly. Making bans easier shouldn't be  a thing.
---
The sling on the M14 is a great touch 👍

You didnt even explain the system you want to implement, just casually brought up 2 systems and then said you dont even know if they work...

If there are less rules about shooting. It shoots faster and more accurate. Available resources should be spend on best performance
---
This doesn't make any sense. In what world does Jager actually use his ADS and actually support his teammates in a strategic way?
---
&amp;#x200B;

p.s. pleas giv acog back ;)

someones fun at parties

kiss already

u/Pax-007 shortly died from the overdose of Flinstone gummies after posting this

Jager is a cock blocker
---
Don't think he comes based whether or not I'm playing Siege. This mechanic does not introduce any drawbacks, while being a "nice-to-have" every once in a while.
---
Ive been playing about a year and I only have 7 legendaries, they are quite rare.
---
While I agree with this. The argument shouldn’t be to do away with seasonal exclusives but more so to fix accounts spanning multiple platforms.
---
Agreed
---
oh no vigil ded
---
Needing to pee that much doesn’t come out of the blue, you needed to pee before you started the game.
---
I hope everyone reads your comment and see how this is the most logical statement for an exclusive.
---
If you’re standing still and have a laser on, the cone of fire is much denser. If you move any at all though while firing it’s back to “barn” wide
---
When people ask “when did Sau-Siege fall from grace?”.
---
Show them this comic.
---
I don't think that would fix the ban. Maybe adding sound like a humming sound when its invisible so you can know it in the room. But removing the invisible aspect would just make it to easy to spot and noone would pick it.
---
I'd rather they put less effort into advertised events and more effort into creating characters and actual events. Better to have a good event and a bad event like this one and the halloween event than to have two mediocre events like showdown
---
sucks its in custom game
---
Heck, even fuze is not russian
---
Oh I got the full hibana outfit+headgear+weapon skin+charm from a single alpha pack

Damn dokkaebi looking like she has enough cake to stack a bakery! I wouldn’t mind being sat on by that phat ass and being smothered by her sweet sweet buns

Saying Ubi doesn't care about consoles is like saying cod doesn't care about PC. They do but most of Ubi's player base is on PC so they focus on it more. And ubi can't do shit about m&amp;k. I mean it would be cool to just make it cross platform and add official m&amp;k so people don't play in normle console servers with it but I've heard some console people don't like that. It's not as simple as flipping a switch and everything is fixed and everyone is happy.
---
I also got it.. had to unequip it cuz i always got shot in the head
---
Nerfed btw
---
Why take it personally over skins? Exclusivity doesn't show anything but someone logging in at the right time to get it. The argument that it happens elsewhere doesn't validate it either, when most people consider it to be a mistake anyway. I don't understand why anyone would get upset that something they paid for is now being sold again, it's childish.
---
Well that’s one way not to get karma, that’s for sure.
---
Only one I have too. I hate that gun too.
---
It is really low effort, why would it not be. Like... netflix execs who know sweet FA about video games have Ubi a Fuck Load of money to do literally anything that looks like an advertisement. So ubi delivered. It's really not supposed to be an amazing game changing event. It's just an ad for a TV show.
---
oh
---
Montagne is a fucking wall
---
Small finger UwU
---
We already had our big event this season so I don’t care.
---
The SW event in For honor is just that instead of swords you have a light saber with some different sounds, that’s exactly they same thing as the Casa del Papel event... just a reskin
---
That was kinda rude. A lot of people can think of the same thing doesn't mean he copied someone
---
Looked it up most people moved to r6 folder from uplay to steam after that steam should only download some missing stuff, just make shure you move it to the r6 folder in steam

At least you have climbs.
---
There was a period my KD was around 1.5 and over a month or so it just consistently dropped to .9

I still don’t know what happened but I’m “back” now
---
What's not to like about some. Sausage action.
---
same hahah
---
I hate that I have that one. At least my other 2 are mp5 and commando
---
Payday 2 allows you to prioritize character models 1-4. It should be simple enough to implement in Siege.
---
Free renown for beating them again?
---
How'd u complete article 5? I can't matchmake that
---
I get your point, but if you load into an R6 game you should stayed focused on the game. Fair enough if there is something that you have to do pr you are looking at your phone, etc.
---
yeah
---
I hate it when I see people under lvl 100 and have 416c black ice.

Well if we are going creativity I am a defender and can stick to ceilings for better angles

Get Jager Defence.
---
&gt; I'm okay with some monetisation to support an ongoing game, but between various versions, premium currency, yearly passes, and an upcoming battle pass, don't you think it'll ever be enough?
---
These are the monetisation schemes I mentioned in my earlier comment, so I don't know what you are talking about.
---
Bosg acog
---
Classic forgot to put the background in the draw loop
---
Ha nice yeah Frost is underused
---
I am not taking it personally at all. I don't have any exclusives. I am speaking up for people who do and why they are there. Exclusitivity does show something. It shows for example that this guy or girl has been playing the game since beta and has been a supporter since then compared to someone who just joined in year 3 or 4. You reward your initial fan base because it is due to the initial players playing , that helped push this game to where it is now. I have no idea what you mean by the argument that it happens elsewhere. I do not get upset at exclusives being resold but I fully understand why others would. In some cases it was a skin given for the first 1000 people to play the game and help it grow. Now a newbie comes and has the capability to buy the same skin in an already grown game. If you do not see why that would annoy some people, there is nothing more I could say that could assist in that.
---
Have you tried reinstalling the game ?

Kaplan’s traps knock don’t they, making in really hard to get a kill unless they’re the last one alive and run into a kapkan

Ignore my last comment. Didn't see that you actually posted your own work. Figured it was a bloodsucker stealing your art to post it here for free karma.
---
im just a skinny ass dont worry
---
lol thanks, imma have to save up for alibi and Kaid
---
Not like you missed anything anyway.
---
That sausage party tho
---
Nice! My friend told me to queue ranked for shits and giggles and ended up getting Plat myself, i stopped playing ranked when I got to Gold 2 cuz i told myself that's good enough for me, my rankup match was one of the best i've ever had in R6 too
---
thanks, i really appreciate it, but no i didnt mean to "make" you say alibi
---
Consistently inconsistent.....
---
Ah, now I see why there isnt a bosg acog
---
let us ban 1 or 2 operators so i dont have to random montagne or clash.... please ubisoft....
---
Yeah I legit thought of this idea and when he commented that I felt like such a karma whore lmao
---
I am disgusted, take my upvote
---
Nice repost.
---
Mi son alzato
---
This also can be a good alternative if my idea is too much work to implement
---
What I'm getting at is people do go afk for whatever reason, regardless of the system existing or not. At least 5 times a night I'll hear "Aw shit the game gave me ___", regardless of if I'm playing casual or ranked. Simply put, its a thing people are gonna do, so why not at least make it so the rest of the team doesn't get punished for their inability to be there for the picking phase? I'd much much much rather somebody get an operator they know they can play even if its not directly going to assist with the objective over an operator that it just going to negatively hurt the team.
---
Why does she not have the bosg
---
Not a weird flex or anything, but I didn't even notice there *wasn't* an aim assist until someone on Reddit told me. It's not that bad
---
Overcome
---
nice
---
Bruh life happens, something might come up and you dont want to get punished just because something happened randomly in your house or somethin
---
That actually sounds pretty fucking cool ngl
---
Yea, but it’s prob a bannable offense, I feel like afk binds and stuff should be legal tho
---
Lol this happened to me couple months ago on favela they all just lined up for a smooth ace
---
You dirty karma whore lol. It’s still your idea, don’t let others make you feel bad for it.
---
I know, Imagine fighting during a thunderstorm!!
---
You can stop worrying about karma now.
---
re map crouch to space bar
---
Don’t think we should be encouraging people to be AFK / on their phone more than they already are
---
I know, but it shouldn’t be too common of an occurrence to warrant this feature. All this would do is endorse people going AFK and that’s not something that’s good, especially in ranked.
---
How do people play like this...
---
you can’t talk about playing serious and playing recruit in the same sentence lol
---
As far as i know, chibi is japanese for small so you made no mistake with the title
---
Yeah that's what i do but it's boring
---
Xd like your attitude.
---
Legendary rarity isn't subjective. Epics should be reserved for older content and charm sets such as dinosaurs, army men, etc.
---
Did we all forget substantially increases ADS? TBF I just started playing again after a year so, so idk if that's still a thing.
---
You are so fricking lucky
---
I got vote kicked the second I loaded in
---
You list three games with lootboxes that have event exclusive loot boxes and play on impulse purchasing and rng...
---
Holy shit wow, sorry. I apologize, didn't know some people could be so close-minded. I won't make any more dry/ironic jokes that are simply trying to make some people laugh.
---
**IT LITERALLY DOESN'T MATTER IF VIGIL IS ALIVE OR NOT. THE JOKE IS HE HAS A GOOD VIEW OF DOKKAEBI's ASS. IS IT THAT HARD TO UNPACK OR DO YOU HAVE TO SUCK THE FUN OUT OF EVERYTHING AND DOWN-VOTE ME?**
---
A pistol, probably
---
We stepped into a war with the cabal on mars
---
Oh yeah
---
That looks like it's out of borderlands
---
I'm going to assume for up votes since we are on Reddit after all
---
I would say that unusual are a pretty scummy business practice that preys on gambling addiction.
---
Just unlock the operators one by one with renown. There is no need to buy any of them with real money. Dont worry, you wont miss out on anything, you will catch up sooner or later depending on how much you play.
---
Okay let me rephrase that. Anything that gives a person an unfair advantage in a multiplayer game is consider cheating.
---
Ngl I completely forgot boost did that
---
&gt; most of Ubi's player base is on PC
---
lol, no its not. The only people that believe this are insecure PC players.
---
Ubi has straight up said that 50% of its total sales come from just PS4 and Xbone. PC makes up 31% and the rest is Nintendo and Mobile.
---
The pixel between the door is a good follow up for an easy second I only got countered once on it of all the times I used it
---
The characters in PD2 don’t change anything in gameplay tho.
---
The point of the random pick is to keep people from going afk
---
I see. If anything I'd say wamai should counter capitao. His gadgets on a timer and it's a magnet. The white circle is huge so you could argue it has enough power to pull the bolt. IMO that'd be balanced since it can't eat all the bolts and you finally have a counter for cap man. A counter besides creating a cigar shortage of course. 
---
But I am not a game designer so what do I know.
---
The enemy team can’t guess your strategy if you don’t have one
---
Then awesome!
---
I'm at 20 hours of gameplay and I have about 4 cheap operators and I'm only halfway there for a single year one operator. I should be allowed to purchase DLC if I want to and I shouldn't have to pay 10 times more just because I own the game already.
---
Air
---
Tower in a nutshell. We all hated it, when it was in the ranked rotation.
---
That's like saying I know having sex with a man is gay but what if I just suck his dick
---
Improvise
---
Ok guys I feel like I need to clarify since people are kinda 50/50 with my idea. Firstly I agree people shouldn’t be AFK in the first place but when they do getting an auto pick isn’t punishment for them it’s punishment for the whole team and secondly if this idea will “encourage” more people to go AFK then there should be a different type of punishment that punishes that one player that went AFK or there could be a better way to go about my suggestion you guys had some pretty good alternative idea too :)
---
Why is she using the ERB?
---
thats still way more than a console lol.
---
Yep, same thing
---
Not really toxic, you just know how to play him.
---
Totally agree
---
The cosmetics are staying til next year.
---
The event I personally played 1 round (was matchpoint), lost because how awful is hostage and never touched the event anymore.
---
But mom said its my turn to repost tomorrow
---
thats basically why I play vigil
---
Thank god it’s gone hated that event
---
And how does that make TF2 any worse than Siege?  And Siege has all these additional monetisation schemes on top of that.
---
The event ducked anyway
---
Type-89 is sex in a gun.
---
Yeah especially as a fan of both the rendition was good.
---
Shit be loud tho
---
Along with what these people are saying, they’re hipfiring which has a big effect on recoil
---
Didn’t even play the mode
---
But then how’s glaz gonna get picked? Cuz nobody’s playing him willingly
---
4 But ok
---
I've skipped a lot on this series... Can somebody explain why the new ops are depicted as fish and why Clash always has her tongue out?
---
I load up siege for the first time in a week and im here shouting "THE MENU MUSIC IS SO FUCKING LOUD"
---
it’s sarcasm, why there’s a lol at the end.
---
I want fish elite skin for kali
---
It's so great with the wood grips from her elite. Good lookin gun
---
i turned up my music from 0 to like 50 during this event, ubi did a great job making the menu music with this one, if it was too loud turn down your volume
---
Audio is still extremely bad for me, especially vertical. I can barely seperate on which floor a person is.
---
Last time I was playing on Outback and I gave a "fake" call because audio was coming from above but in fact, it was on the same floor and I almost got my teammate killed.
---
Monty is a special feller, not everyone wants to play mont because not everyone can play him well. Big ups to the mont mains 💕
---
Not a smurf or anything
---

---
Maybe one smoke pellet and one flash pellet? They wouldn't be able to bounce around corners like normal flashes because they explode on impact (and same lower radius and shorter duration than normal flash), but they'd let him delay/deny an approaching rush.
---
I’ve found [this](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F282940655353) , but I don’t know of anywhere where you can buy the chibi versions. I did see that someone got actual alpha packs from Ubisoft which had a mini Tachanka in, maybe contact Ubisoft to see if they sell them somewhere?
---
my first season was wind bastion and this season, 90% solo q, was my first time in plat
---
I'm a Monty main, I rarely go positive but I'm usually top of the scoreboard

You can spawnpeek with a lesion mine (hard but so funny) also, throwing nerfs are coming. You can nullify a flash bang by not looking at it. Lesion mines can kill. Nothing can counter a lesion mine if you don’t see it while not seeing a flash is what keeps you a live. Zofia counters flashes, as well as ying while I guess fuze kinda counters lesion.  Point here is what’s more annoying: a poisonous mine that takes away a lot of your health that tells the enemy where you are, or a flash grenade that you can nullify by looking the other way

Wtf lmao what a dumb “event”

Could be just a star simble on the side of the operator name
---
I lost a friend  because i did that a lot

I heard r6fandom has them but I haven’t checked

It’s usually treated as a joke that sometimes gets taken seriously. I’ve only ever seen people get kicked if they do something seriously potatoey or if our team is feeling especially memey. Then it’s just hilarious, even if I’m the one getting kicked. I can see why not everyone sees the humor in it tho
---
It was also free weekend on steam. Thought I could get some easy games. Karma decided to put me (High silver low gold) in with 5 man plat teams while my team was all silvers and golds.....

Liquid Nitrogen canisters or something along that line to disable the bomb without needing the defuser. How this would actually work in game and be balanced I don't see it happening. Too op.

I am always up for more options. Always upvote this sort of idea when it comes up. Can’t see any harm in it to be honest.

I, personally, just like random because it gets my “net” of ops played spread out a bit more than what I will play in ranked.

Maybe if we keep making the post theyll listen, lol.

You’re the only one alive on a 1v5?!?!? HOW WOULD I HAVE GUESSED, THANKS FOR INFORMING US!

Game music at 1% shouldn't overpower heavy metal at 150%.
---
Make it December 1-7th of 2020, the 5 year anniversary of Rainbow 6: Seige.
---
Have the old graphics and everything, add in some old bugs as well.
---
I think instead of picking your favorites, the game choses what ops you get based on playtime, and or win rate %, or KDR. Because if you could just pick your favorites for the game to pick if you go afk, then people don't have to worry as much about going afk during op choosing.
---
This looks like the bit coin stocks
---
ok bitch
---
Yup it was a shitty rushed sponsorship thing they put exactly -25% effort into
---
Lol ikr. I think im kinda deaf now
---
As did I.
---
Okay thats a bug and bugs happen all the time thats unlucky. But the event itself is not good and should not get called "even" cause it is just hostage on bank
---
Console or PC? Unless you’ve been using only shotguns, your headshot% is fairly low. On PC you should try going for more headshots than you’re getting currently
---
i dont get it
---
Took me a while to realize the scale lol

I was fan of the music itself but was very annoyed to turn the sound up and down depending on if I am in a game or not

I swear these bullets sometimes hit backwards

Cezar the dog guy?? He's an epic gamer??

You start at around the same MMR next season

We literally just brought this up on the last episode of Unrenowned. I think a Vanilla Siege weekend event would be friggin legit.

Hi

That’s what he just said

So where’s this rock you’ve been under?

Is that a KWA
---
What operator is this?

Wonder how much they got paid by Netflix for the dumbass event
---
Lmao yes

I am obligated to leave one singular upvote, may I bless you?

and no i didnt upvote already-

Who would use frost's shotgun its just evil

Almost all are smurfs.

It has a faster fire rate sure, but still the point stands.

*laughs in ark player*

Had the full monster kit so I thought I might as well commit

That would be pretty awesome, would I be able to PM you about it mate?

Nah, he was probably under crack as usual

Hey, they have some sort of bass-ic concept of a pun, don't hate.

[Edit: Can't type]

With the bosg, if you rapid fire. Are you really gonna hit that second shot?
---
 Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dances from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon.
---
Ahh
---
This guy gets it. Last week I played a full plat team that was dropped down to Silver. We obviously lost. Such a toxic thing to do, and Im seeing it more and more every season. Whats the point in playing ranked when every other game my team gets matched against plats and diamonds who dropped down?
---
seriously those pants looks hella comfy
---
I mean they literally made 3 shitty skins and some menu art because Netflix gave them a bunch of money. I really want to know how much was paid for this cause Ubi was basically given money for nothing
---
Ultra wide 4K HD thic
---
Only good thing about this was that i got 60 frames in the menu atleast
---
sure!
---
Not really
---
Have you hear of DayZ?

Thats some nasty kills tho lmao

Exactly. So with the new sniper, that second shot is the first with extra steps.

Just a bonus it had cool ass skins

Haha. Saw you on r/airsoft, very nice

Kinda does though. High rank means you consistently win against the other team.

Missing a player, has the teamkill warning, is down 0-2 in fucking Archives site on Bank in Casual, on console. Literally the worst siege experience possible right there.
---
What skin is this?

It’s not fixed in there, I plan to move it further back along the rail. But as a left handed player I want it on view

Pc or the game?

Only play the best ops (;

I'm aware. I did agree with him though, don't see any problem with that.

To play devil's advocate how can you get better if you're never pushed or experiencing better then yourself?

Fellow Redditors, we must eliminate this mans.

Hahaha I get it
---
This was a “Look at my ace” but actually good
---
Damn what a loophole. Kinda wish we could see that ping tho xD

It's never going to happen. They don't want glaz on defence. So yeah seeing the same brain dead idea every week on this sub gets annoying after awhile.
---
He's a defender
---
Yeahhh broooo

16k coming next year

Damn a month for 25k? Ive been collecting those 20k-25k uniforms for my original ops every couple days.

The whining from people who can't handle night mode maps will never end. Won't happen, unfortunately.

Pretty sure moroccan granddad is older than thatcher.

The smg is one of the best I the game because of low recoil, relatively high damage (for and smg) and decent fire rate. However, the sasg is god like when mastered. Although people think it’s a meme, it’s really not. The pmm is hands down one of the best pistols in the game based on damage and paired with the sasg with very good fire rate (for a shotty) and 50 damage per pellet they make a great combo. Just look at Godly Noob or VarsityGaming. They have nearly
---
mastered the semi auto shotty/pistol combo.
---
I dont know
---
Love the idea
---
Plot twist- that’s an actual case for the game and the gun is actually huge
---
This was golden for ubi. Ubi got paid by Netflix to get paid by us to wear Netflix skins.
---
This hurts my eyes.
---
I like it.
---
I guess but a lot of the time there isnt really wire that close to the wall or its not in a position thats too detrimental. The damage is a good point but it may be easy just to run from it and then dash back to the wall.
---
This event was just mildly spicy siege
---
Can you post links to each individual one in the comments? I missed all of them but they look interesting.
---
Epic
---
Ubisoft would never implement this as it incentives walking away from an active game, which ruins the flow of gameplay
---
They’re saying you’re irrelevant
---
I'm just saying in general, it can be used for more than reinforced walls, kinda like zofia or ash when they destroy gadgets
---
Wrong
---
Turn upside down and it’s a different story. You become practically un-killable from inside the building.
---
Yeah but why not just bring zof or ash in that case?
---
What game is this
---
This is automatically invalid due to bush camping at the start, I’m sorry pal but I don’t make the rules

Big sausage vibes

Ur right. I've completely forgot him. And it would be even more perfect for the role
---
A bit extreme when r6stats showed all 5 being plat 1 and 2 previous seasons, yet they were "silver" this season. They dropped down so they could faceroll lower ranked players.
---
You bought it on his account. He now owns all of those operators.
---
Sorry I only speak walk hax
---
*dink*
---
Something that new players should learn early on is that when you are playing defense and there is only 1 attacker left, dont play like a monkey and chase the last guy. So many rounds will be lost that your team should have won because your entire team decided to get kill hungry. When you have the advantage, all you need to do is waste time playing passively.
---
the masks are cool, but i'm not sure i want to run around in a bright red suit.
---
That’s so situational and bad
---
That show is maybe one of the best shows that has come out on Netflix. If you havent watched it then I recommend
---
check out r/siegeacademy it's a subreddit focused on learning and getting better at the game
---
You mean I can turn my volume back up from 10%??
---
That is backwards for NathanDudani or something like that his main has been #1 on Xbox for a few seasons
---
I thought about this before but I think this is entirely situational. You’re not going to reinforce red hatch or new hatch on kafe when you’re in kitchen say. Or bathroom hatch in coastline when you’re in kitchen
---
Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if they held it back because of the leaks
---
Used to have a 6kd with tachanka, went afk for one round and it was gone just like that :(
---
Its was good music to listen to, but it was too loud to be enjoyable.
---
Staged
---
O partigiano portami via
---
O bella ciao bella ciao  bella ciao ciao ciao
---
That is Consulate which isnt even that bad. Everything else still stands though lol
---
Sausage rules all
---
Add sprays to seige like in tf2
---
Okay, that's cool, I guess. But it's only useful on a few maps and sites with outside hatches (the only one I can think of rn is Kafe). Otherwise you can just reinforce the hatches in the prep phase.
---
Understandable definitely. Ubisoft takes incredibly to fix major issues in the game and always waits to add changes til it's a new season or midseason patch instead of just patching it in when it's done and polished.
---
Love to see it.
---
Mozzie : 2 great guns, shotgun, barbed wire, 2-speed, can steal drones.
---
Didn’t even play because I hate hostage but I did hate that music

Congrats!  I finally hit Gold I after being stuck in Gold III for the entire season, not sure if I have the patience to solo queue to Plat for the first time.

Kinda looks like the courier from fallout new Vegas

I’d rather not

You probably got kicked before the end of the game
---
It’s a horrible mess roamers have a field day roaming it,defenders camp the elevator whilst every one goes down and it’s just confusing af
---
Yeah I did get kicked but even if you do get kicked you shouldn’t  lose MMR
---
Save your money for the year 5 pass
---
if fuze elite isn't partly based on that dude, then I am a dead walrus
---
Ubi, I'm not against this type of marketing. But there's two caveats: 
---
 
---
- Be more creative. Doesn't have to be the Haunted House (which could be a game in its own right). Even simply putting both teams on fixed spawns every round would be more fun as it would develop into a silly meta game where players are trying to predict each other's next moves.    
---
- If you want to push awareness of something, put some skins up for cheap so that you turn players into your brand evangelists. Add some expensive ones, sure, but don't expect players to all just pay for the privilege of doing your advertising.
---
Honestly though I wish there was cross platform on siege it would be amazing cause some of my friends play on PC and I play on console
---
That’s been running around for years buddy
---
Good idea I don’t like how the entire character gets green maybe just text or a star or even just a church mark box like for which operators are shown on the operator screen
---
Cross play pls so I can wreck people using controllers lol
---
Anyone that is confused, while killing nokk, he also wallbanged his teammate through the wall behind nokk
---
Yes we all love bananas
---
Why not? If like if you quit the game it counts as a lost
---
If they had one of the skins as a challenge I woulda played it.
---
Caviera vigil and nokk are fun because you can sneak around and feel independent from the pack, making plays and taking names. Dokk is also good
---
It is the most complicated map in siege, and by a large margin.
---
Not only do you have an insane amount of rooms, you also have to take into account the soundscape; really confusing in tower. Coupled with people not being familiar with the map, it makes for one of the most frustrating moments in siege.
---
Cuz it sucks
---
Good...what did you expect?
---
Because aiming is a lot harder..
---
You can move your whole arm on a pc so 1cm is a minuscule adjustment. 
---
Meanwhile the max ROM on a joystick is like 5 cm.
---
When the tiny PS4 controller is so good it looks like an Xbox controller
---
Imagine peakers are the Spanish inquisition you always have to expect them.
---
I went afk and was punished. Fuck Ubisoft. I deserve the mmr for not playing the whole game. How dare they punish me. Lol
---
Music make me lose control
---
What I got it like level 50...
---
Wtf do you mean I had to help my mum with something urgently and that’s why I had to leave and I told the other people in the 3 stacks I was in too and we ended up winning .
---
Send me the charm link pls
---
Fuck me eh
---
I’ve always felt like it favors defenders because it’s like a normal map where the defenders can go outside without being marked. It’s actual exterior doesn’t offer much to the attackers.
---
Are you the controller user?
---
Rook... mine...
---
thank god i thought i was just sensitive and shit. but yeah that was so bloody loud that music
---
Why did one of the string segments sound like the world's loudest orgasm meme
---
So? If you leave/go afk in a game it's a forfeit. The game doesn't care that you needed to bring in groceries. It's there to stop people from afk macroing and getting lucky elo wins.
---
Unfortunately. Maybe try to get a refund from PlayStation but they are beyond stingy. Best of luck.
---
Probably has teammate outline turned off
---
Or just put Bartlett back into casual pool... please Ubisoft, I beg you
---
Combination of bad lighting, too many rooms with a lot of cover, hard to watch flank on attack, and the fact that you can deny half of the map from the mezzanine.
---
Loved it. Bella Ciao👋🏼
