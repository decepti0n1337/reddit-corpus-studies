You're trading a whole operator for a piece of barbed wire or a nitro cell, that isn't a good trade.

It‚Äôs opinionated, but I feel like your in the right here, especially if you were on Defense first. Mira, if used correctly is a ‚Äúpower house‚Äù and chances are you would know more and how to use Mira more effectively then the enemy team, giving you an advance there, as well as there are numerous work around to get rid of a Mira when you are on attack.

I stoped playing Siege, the games too broken, everyones uses mouse and keyboard in the higher ranks. Theres more to it but no sense complaining further. Just wanted to vent and hopefully find out I'm not the only one who feels this way. ( on xbox btw )

Had the same problem with Fortnite. Uninstalled. With R6 if you play a casual match or 2 your reflexes will come back. Fuck fortnite.

They called themselves socialists but politically and idealogically they were far from being left wing.

However it is common alt-right/nazi rhetoric to try and blame the left for Nazism, its part of their propoganda machine so maybe do some research on the topic to try and get away from all that.

If you want to get really technical, Finka's spear isn't even a legit gun, the Vector .308 for Lion doesn't exist. The French operators on defense use German manufactured weapons, which the Secret Service should be using in this game. The K1A is a carbine listed as an SMG, Kaid is just Bandit+Ela, Hibana is just ranged thermite, Alibi and Vigil were supposed to be one operator, Maestro is just a different permutation of Echo, Ying is just Fuze with flashes, lesion is just Kapkan with a DOT effect. I can go on for days, they are planning to have 100 operators, it's inevitable to have a few with very similar or hybrid abilities.

stuff about internet, I asked if they are able to put out some hotfix on it, the support said that they weren‚Äôt able to, which I assume that the support team can‚Äôt do anything

You can't put any more muzzle attachments on top of the silencer, and it's not like you can't put silencer with a grip on every other gun, so that's a null argument. üòÖ

New season same returning unending toxicity
---
It‚Äôs more annoying to deal with then it is difficult, just like Lesion. I feel like a workaround would be better then removing her from the game however, as it is a small amount but some people really like to play her and I‚Äôm going to be honest she‚Äôs quite fun to use, more so in casual then ranked though. Don‚Äôt feel like it was the best idea to put a shield operator on attack, but that‚Äôs beside the point. What would you guys do different to make clash have the same appeal, but be more balanced when coming to go against her?
---
I'm nuht gunna try to juustify et

Same happened to a friend in ranked. He also had to restart the game

Uh. Yeah. Ranked is sure out of beta.
---
I just started playing on Xbox. Rank 11. What do I have yo look forward to?
---
To be honest this feeling came from never actually putting serious effort into bomb. I‚Äôve just played my first ten matches this season and maybe the first three I didn‚Äôt enjoy but after that I started getting into it more. It‚Äôs a bit more sweaty but in a good way. I can see myself growing to love it actually which a couple of hours ago I didn‚Äôt think I would say!
---
Why exactly are you so triggered? All I said was its funny that they cant fix shit, like how shit must the dev's be that they put a already retarded character in the game, and it ends up being the most broken glitchy character it's funny how dumb they are lmfao but hey stay triggered retard HAhA
---
I‚Äôm confused then. I‚Äôve seen his rhetoric about how capitalism, perpetuated by the Jews, was what caused Germany‚Äôs misfortune. And isn‚Äôt the right more leaning toward less government? In that case, why did he take over businesses and repurpose them for war? I‚Äôm really confused because I just assumed these were leftist policies myself, not talking points or propaganda
---
Bandit has the same gun but a flash hider, an extra reinforcement, 4 hard breach denial batteries...
---
But only has 1 set of utility.
---
Do you play bomb? What elo do you play ranked at? I'm genuinely confused how recruit could ever be viable, he's not played for a reason.
---
I‚Äôm not usually that bad
---
Good thing Pick and Ban is in ranked now.
---
Well if you haven't played very much you don't know where the bombsites are, so you're more likely to just drive your drone around aimlessly

at this point you're just trolling or being extremly butthurt, either way your deaf for any reason so enjoy your won Argument on the internet

This happened to me yesterday, and I thought it was fixed
---
No fuck you. They‚Äôre trying their hardest to get these glitches and pieces of shit like you aren‚Äôt helping. Try writing a line of code as complex as this games, then comment a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù. At least then you‚Äôd realize how much of a cunt you‚Äôre being.
---
You use headphones right?
---
I feel like reusing the guns was a good call, as it opened up new buffs and implementations for the guns, like the D-50, for example. Some could make the argument that they could of done that as well as have new guns, but if the new operators were to get new guns, the new stuff for the pre existing weapons probably wouldn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôm ok with them re-using guns every now and then, but if the new operators, all of them from now on have old weapons, that‚Äôs a different story.
---
He is still strong, you should put your maestros up in hard to reach places as often as you can or make them face up until you decide to use them so Twitch or Thatcher can't just easily destroy them.
---
The shield glitch relied on placing defender gadgets with Clash, how the hell does Monty do it?
---
Yeah shields on defense just don't really work. From a competitive standpoint she's useless and from a casual standpoint she's a headache. 
---
She could have been an interesting take on Castle. Like a deployable shield with a zone control upside.
---
ah Ubisoft's spaghetti code strikes again. at least in ranked I will now be able to ban her broken ass until they actually fix her.
---
I‚Äòve taken out more than 2 people in the skylight to the left of this one, must be players with special curiosity, like that fuze in the Oregon looool
---
Does she sound the same as other operators when running or is it muffled a little bit?
---
Lol what do you mean  
---

---
that's clearly her left hand lol
---
As a maestro main I can say that the nerfs really haven't effected him. He's still a strong defender and just as useful as he was pre-nerf. Definitely go maestro.
---
I said running...
---
Every addition is fine except for one in my opinion. I really don't agree with the whole "switch-sides-after-round-3" because if a certain map favors a certain side, it becomes quite unfair. Earlier today I played a ranked game where defense won all 9 rounds; in this situation all of the pressure was on the attackers after the 3rd round because they were down 3:0. It just so happened that they won the next 3 defense rounds, but lost overtime because they had to attack twice rather than once.  
---
I'm not sure exactly what's to blame for this type of scenario, but hope it can be fixed somehow, eventually
---
Walt is missin :(
---
cancer
---
Which means that boat is probably about to get *very* lost
---
That's a good point, you're right.
---
Still, funny clip and some good karma.
---
Could be. Could also just need any deplorable gadget. We don‚Äôt know, since people only use the wire to to the glitch. If it‚Äôs any deplorable gadget, then only impacts and C4 would be a safe selection.
---
Well then why not just tell the guy who was asking that he has a magnified scope rather than saying did you just assume his has both eyes closed?
---
She still has a shield if she‚Äôs running
---
Thank you I was also having the same thing right when United fixes something they break more shit

You throw a drone after your 1st drone is destroyed and then you spam your gadget (shield extending) and then with timing and luck you become invincible like clash.

Took the words right outta my mouth. Used to be a glaz main... now I barely play anymore
---
Congrats mate.

If anything he'll be better. After Studying the art of the sword.

Spamming Q and E, leaning left and right

They also took away the slide if you double tap prone while moving.
---
Permanently remove her, period.
---
She still can move around with in extended
---
Completely forgot Monty had drones to be honest, and no don't worry I won't. Last season I ran with a 4 man so we could tk anyone doing the shield glitch.
---
Stop Reposting
---
They just need to stop kicking out so much new content so quickly and focus on perfecting what they have now. I understand that's the appeal of Siege, but they can mitigate this by bringing out old game modes (Chimera, April Fools, Halloween, etc) to keep that dynamic flowing. New content consistently is cool, but not when it breaks more than they can fix.
---
Why Jackal?
---
Just restart game to get packs back. And the skins can be put onto any gun and yes they stay after the season ends
---
Oh I know my dude. It‚Äôs going to spread so fast! I have even started doing it again lol
---
Pressing Q and E buttons all the time to avoid getting headshotted.

Common strat for wanna-be-pro and wanna-sweat-and-win-no-matter-what guys.

I was genuinely upset to see her back in the game last night. She sucks the fun right out of the game.
---
Ah, I don‚Äôt play PC so I didn‚Äôt know, thanks
---
Cheers, luckily haven‚Äôt ran in to any glitchers yet, hopefully gonna improve on last season.
---
Great banter
---
My counter to that is that Mute's Jammers simply provide a small radius for you to move within. I think it's great they listened to Reddit and made Vigil a hard counter (similar to how Cav's silent step prevents Jackal tracking when activated). But his whole intention as an operator is just not fit for Casual nor Ranked. 
---
In fact Ubi called him their [biggest mistake](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeparlock/2018/10/24/ubisoft-calls-rainbow-six-sieges-lion-its-biggest-mistake-in-reddit-qa-more-reworks-on-the-way/#303f86694704).

I would say this is a good reason but the only thing described is basicially a meat shield or cannon fodder and no op should be classified as that
---
Yeah, fuck shields
---
I've see solo indie devs roll out bugfixes within a week for similar issues, and teams of 5+ people usually take even less time. It's laziness, or a severe lack of developers, or terrible spaghetti code.

But sahelanthropus wasn‚Äôt the weapon to surpass metal gear

She's a great roamer she good for making the attackers worried and make them go after her losing time and her interrogation helps out the whole team by revealing enemy position. How is she bad?
---
I would say yes on the second one. The first one was more in the open than the second. You still could've waited a bit to let the first guy get to a safe spot to revive him. Even with the guy jumping out of the window you would've been able to wait for him since he knew he already downed 2 and was probably using them as bait for another jump out.

The fan goes crazy for me.

tbh, ubi's move to make all the base ops cheaper kinda pissed me off. When the base ops were more expensive, I grinded to get, every, single, one, then siege updates and all the base ops became cheaper. I got so mad, but hey, it did mean that I could get frost sooner.
---
I agree. Siege has become the most cancerous meme. The playerbase is the most toxic out there and the game is just gadget gadget gadget.
---
I‚Äôve always been stuck at gold 1 but the soft elo reset helped

lol
---
Killing ADS‚Äôs and providing intel while still having explosive fragging capabilities is a meat shield?

Lol what game have you been playing?
---
Impressive
---
Gignen
---
Thanks for the feedback! I love your detail and I seriously appreciate you taking your time to put it out there. Truly.
---
I‚Äôll try to keep this brief: (SPOILERS BELOW!)
---
1. This was originally supposed to be a short story around 4 or 5 chapters long, where Jackal came across the ghost of his dead brother. Very fan-fiction-y, eh? When it picked up traction though, and people wanted more, I eased things back the best I could to a more realistic setting and tone.
---
I actually was quite inspired by Outbreak. Its deviation from Clancy realism inspired the idea of a supernatural element - especially because I, myself, have experienced some very odd, unexplained things in my lifetime. I just ran with it.
---
If I had known the book was going to go where it was gonna go, I likely would‚Äôve done something else entirely, but I don‚Äôt regret it. It was a blast to write.
---
2. You‚Äôre spot-on about chapter length. The reason chapters are so short in this story is because I posted these on Instagram, where you‚Äôre limited to 10 ‚Äúslides‚Äù per post. That‚Äôs where the vast majority of my readers are, so that‚Äôs why I go that route. That‚Äôs why many segments were chopped up when they typically would not be.
---
3. Lt. Col. Acevedo was a little shoutout to a follower of mine. She had always been very supportive (still is) and I told her I‚Äôd name a character after her, and give her a minor role.
---
As for The Djinn, his entire character was inspired by Joey Ansah‚Äôs performance as Desh in the 2007 film ‚ÄúThe Bourne Ultimatum‚Äù. Desh was fierce, efficient, and frighteningly lethal, and gave Jason Bourne a very sudden fight for his life. I loved the idea of bringing in a third party ‚Äúout of left field‚Äù to shake things up for Jackal &amp; Mira. After all, for most of the novel it‚Äôs not entirely clear how deep the corruption runs in Ceuta. I feel it‚Äôs very reasonable that they would have assets like The Djinn.
---
In fact, The Djinn was actually sent there to kill Captain Vivas and ‚Äúwipe‚Äù clean any connections to Senator Costa and other corrupt officials. I admittedly leave it to the reader‚Äôs imagination and discernment, but it‚Äôs to be assumed that The Djinn was watching the residence when Jackal &amp; Mira entered.
---
I suppose I could have given a more detailed, or gradual, aftermath to the character, but I settled for letting the reader know that whoever this guy was, he was no joke.
---
You get a glimpse of that when you find that Ghost Recon operators were perfectly aware of who this Djinn fellow was, and moreover were shocked to see that Ryan and Elena had dispatched him.
---
It‚Äôs left to your imagination, really. In the end, The Djinn was sent by higher powers to do a job, and he was defeated. Still, he put up quite a fight against two of the most capable operators on earth. Just wasn‚Äôt enough.

Again, I want to thank you for your input, but also thank you for reading! I‚Äôm really glad you enjoyed it overall. I‚Äôm currently 11 chapters into a second novel, Rainbow Six: Drachen, on Instagram. I haven‚Äôt brought it to WattPad yet, but I will.
---
You may be happy to know there will be no supernatural elements there. Ha!
---
I haven't heard mine. I usually have my headphones on 98% game to hear around me. The game says it's something about the TV and "tearing". So idk.
---
I know right

Same here, saw an Ela today using the deplorable shield glitch.

Outbreak was great if you weren't going for the charms. But I remember having to play the same 30 minute mission three times to get the really cool charms and it sucked
---
That what he use to do when he played the game at first. He also does it normally on his twitch
---
I earned one tonight and it didn't show up.
---
This image must have triggered some people
---
Anyone can listen and people would frag more effectively with sights, muzzles, and grips
---
What is the world record for this?
---
Even if she was older, I don't think she'd lose that much of her original facial features. The distinct V shaped chin. Thin cheeks, farther out eyes, and especially the height of her head. I don't believe she'd lose all of that in a few years. Especially when she's only 31-33. Ubisoft changed her bio for no reason and got rid of the year she was born and just marked her age so it's up for debate now.
---
In the menus it looks similar to BlackBeard's helmet. Idk tho
---
Could be
---
Now the map is unbalanced but it isn't the worst we have seen really
---
My friend got pissed cause I was using shield fuze and got 3 kills in a ranked match. He called the 2  fuzes and one handgun kill I got luck but one fuze was the rest was just pure skill
---
I think finka is fine considering nobody can hear shit over your blood pumping in your ears.
---
I'm usually on the brink every season with some heartbreaks or lag matches.  Always good to get that one.
---
I appreciate your appreciation of another‚Äôs point of view.
---
I dont know how to respond to this
---
I would think no but who knows it‚Äôs only like 60gb so won‚Äôt take that long if you do
---
Are you using a scuff?
---
So don‚Äôt respond
---
Haters will say it's fake
---
Glaz was overpowered, his ability to entry into a site while essentially invisible was simply bs, and used little to no skill to gain from it.
---
Now you have to think about how you position yourself and how to best utilise your gadget, they increased his skillcap while making him less annoying to play against. 
---
It is a good change.
---
If I could upvote you twice I would holy shit
---
What a great insightful discussion OP started.
---
Referring to my second point, Ela‚Äôs in game model looks very different from the CGI trailer. If you look at her in game, they look pretty damn similar
---
No M870? Wack
---
Congrats dude üëåüèª I hope to make it to plat this season, I‚Äôve been high gold since I came to pc I just haven‚Äôt been able to make it the last little bit
---
It's like a helmet made of graphene. I heard they're developing one.
---
r/mildyamusing
---
I know you guys will work as fast as you possibly can to remedy this, but I hope it'll be fixed soon because I really am itching to hop in and grind Ranked this Season. üòÜ 
---
Good luck and have a good day Boat.
---
I‚Äôve legit done that. In a situation where we have enough people and someone is sneaking around. I use myself as bait so people can find where they are. Either I kill them, or the people watching nearby will find them. It works sometimes ha ha!
---
I once lost a ranked just because of the lesion. 1v1, I rushed in to plant, 2 seconds on the clock, lesion hit my foot. Boom. Done.
---
I am very impressed with that and I wonder if he can carry me in ranked? jk lol
---
What's the point of TTS lol. The clash glitch fix isn't working and there are numerous other bugs people are complaining about.
---
That‚Äôs littt you are really talented
---
If you can‚Äôt handle the heat get the fuck out of the kitchen and don‚Äôt post here
---
Accept ur loses and wins and see what u did wrong and right. Chances are that if u really are still struggling your still getting a lot wrong about how to play. If you do watch pro play tho I do suggest rather than just watching, pay closer attention to what they do and why they do it. Look at the strats and habits they have and try to think about how u can apply it to yourself to make u play better
---
why didn‚Äôt i think of this :( i would have won the game a while ago if i did this
---
Not gonna lie that made me hard
---
Hey,
---
I can tell you what worked for me when I was learning. I by no means am a high ranked player but I think I can answer some questions.
---
1: I'm on pc, sry
---
2: No, you can use any sight you want as acog is by no means a must and more of a personal preference.
---
However, there are general trends where acog is used on ops like Blackbeard that don't want to go into the objective and holo on ops that like it close and personal.
---
3: I have no main myself. There is really no such thing as maining an operator like in MOBAs as all ops basically come down to gunplay. But buy operators based on your Playstyle( anchors or roamers, fraggers, etc)
---
4: T-hunt, the fastest you can complete.
---
5: Learn maps by just playing them, OR launch a lobby with a map you want and plrun there for some time.
---
6: you didn't ask about it but I will tell you anyway.
---
DONT stress about your rank as rank doesn't equal your skill.
---
Have fun
---
Congrats dude
---
Dude i feel so bad for you
---
Actually that no longer works.
---
I am not? I just explained why 18% for that achievement is not unusual.
---
I've been looking for a team in case too, DM me if you want.
---
To be fair, none of these bugs matter in pro-league because they're illegal anyway and cannot be done accidentally
---

Ah. Thanks!
---
Yes.
---
Lesion was portraied in Blood Orchid as the one assuming this role.
---
Chimera was unbalanced, but you can shoot lion and finka. You can't shoot people doing these glitches. 
---
Health was bad, but it didn't have the high amount of game breaking bugs were dealing with now. Most of the bugs present in health are around right now, if I recall. The only one that isn't here is invisibility glitch. I have no faith that that glitch wont crop up again though.
---
I don't really know why Grim Sky would be worse, other than maverick.
---
There's also the IQ exploit where you can see the defuser.
---
They feed on our pain.
---
A lot of physical labor? And you get this where from a game that's story is literally just a bunch a paragraphs? Ela is 33, nowhere near her 40's. Still quite young especially compared to most of the operators in game. And even with the eye shadow which is very very little in amount that wouldn't make her look any different. It's literally a few pixels on the very bottom of her eye and barely covers any more space. And if she has any blemishes she uses a lot of makeup to make her skin look that smooth and keep it that pale. Which she is very very pale. And covered in many freckles. The only area where you could also say she does a lot of physical labor is when she first started her career in the military. Not very much now, not much we know of at least. So don't pull facts out your ass that aren't true for the most part.
---
It usually happens when other 4( usually party) press leave matchmaking but game still leaves them as parts of the lobby for some reason.
---
Jaeger corps real speacial forces
---
Thank you!
---
Broke ass get a job
---
Good idea
---
It‚Äôs not worth it, trust me. Ubi made a very balanced game and Nokk isn‚Äôt really worth it, Warden‚Äôs pretty cool but if you don‚Äôt have the spare cash you shouldn‚Äôt get it.
---
Kotal sledge, Tekk-taha!
---
Actually they can because it's their game.
---
Hes thinking *"hmmm i wonder whats in these oh well back to work"*
---
Preach!
---
Thank you for actually being helpful
---
Not to be confused with Thottie
---
No they can't. Criticism of video games is covered by fair use.
---
Why can‚Äôt they just take her barbed wire? At this point anyone playing Clash is a liability for the  match, I haven‚Äôt seen it used for utility in ranked after this shit started

---
ubisoft doesnt remove those type of bans, unintended or intended
---
That's genuinely blyatiful.
---
Jackal's face expression is honestly extremely close to the original
---
Just like NASA duct tape?
---
I don‚Äôt see why not.
---
She is a special forces operator. That means physical exercise and training almost every day. Not to mention that she is still active duty and running ops. How could you say she doesn‚Äôt do physical labor?
---
Bruh moment
---
Am I dumb or does it look the same
---
Weird, I'm the opposite, i get runaway frames in the menu's and loading screens.
---
Congrats OP, I used to play this game in 2016 got back into it a month ago, my high last season was Silver 3, now this season I‚Äôm a Gold 4 so far. This gives me inspiration
---
Damn straight
---
I just did it in a custom game. It's still working.
---
Some pretty crazy cross hatching
---
Just remove the gadget that allows this, dont remove the character. Jesus i paid for the game i want to use these operators but assholes that glitch keep making ubi take them away. Seriously just remove their barbed wire or whatever is directly letting them glitch like this. Dont remove an operator again for the love of god.
---
You‚Äôre right, silly question. It‚Äôs sledge with that one headgear isn‚Äôt it?

Great video!

Hello PreethishAnam, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c015ll/this_is_so_unfair_please_fix_this_perspective/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Why the holo? Personally I prefer the reflex for cqc due to smaller casing
---
Its not like it doesnt feel that way now. Silvers and lower should not be allowed to que with plats or higher. It makes ranking rather easy as the matches are more than likely plats vs coppers which shouldnt be the case
---
They probably haven‚Äôt reached the time limit yet, they drop after a year of their release then again the next year
---
Im saying this because its not a gamebreaking mechanic, without it clash wouldnt be playable. So y do u want it removed?
---
You can say the same for OW but it's much worse and fortnite is worse than OW
---
I got 6 wins and placed in gold 4. What the heck
---
Clutch or ki‚Äîoh...
---
do you mean the round switch?
---
By your argument, the entire scanning process should be removed. I don't necessarily disagree, but it would be even more unbalanced if you were allowed to scan without repercussion
---
Yea I won 8 games
---
Probably trying to get Doc to heal him but Doc thinks he's Rook
---
It‚Äôs called role swap because you switch from attack to defense

I haven't seen a whole lot of complaints, and when I did see some they always uploaded a video with it showing off the "problem"
---
Bruh big mood united pls fix
---
Thank you!!
---
Its because of operation health
---
if so, its terrible for unbalanced maps, like chalet, if you load into chalet on ranked and you're on the orange team you might aswell accept defeat cos you're defending the first 3 rounds
---
Lmao okay buddy, sure. Whatever you say.
---
...which are the frogmen, aka Danish special operatives
---
Why do their faces always looks so fucked up in the kill cam? It kind of makes me hate them lol
---
You gonna have to reload it no other way
---
All ideas can be traced down to a single originator. I don't give a fuck how "ignorant" of game development I am, this is basic common sense. It doesn't matter how many hundreds of workers Ubisoft has, or their development structure, at the end of the day it had to be one person who first proposed the idea, who gained the approval of his or her coworkers and superiors who then helped he or she put it in the game. That's who I blame, not the people along the way who agreed with the first proposer, or wrote the code into the game or the artist who chose the fucking text that the warning would be displayed in etc. because without the original suggestion none of the rest would have happened.
---
yeah its defo a bug
---
One would think Valk would hate those players who constantly scan on her black eye and gets them shot out as a result. At least that's all I've read from Valk mains on this subreddit.
---
Gone reduced to atoms.......
---
F
---
I wish I could remove clash
---
Please send it to me when you do.
---
i wasnt correcting you, i just didnt know if thats what they called it, wasnt sure if thats exactly what you were talking about
---
A whole 80 days of play time
---
Honestly I have no idea why I use the holo. I really like the sight but the casing is a little restrictive.
---
It‚Äôs always Ash that‚Äôs the worst, too
---
Y'all are God's I hope you know that
---
I wonder if I still have my 100% then
---
Yes I‚Äôm still stalking your profile. What you play on?
---
pick rate helps you get a pretty good idea which ops are good and which ones are bad. After all if an op is bad, no one is gonna pick them.  
---
So Clash, who is picked less than 10% of the time in Plat+Diamond, is also a big loser here, as when she is picked, the team loses more than it wins.
---
Now sure maybe in gold or silver a good Clash can fuck up an attacking team, but that's not competitive. That's not Siege at it's peak. Put that "good Clash player" in a lobby against Plats and Diamonds, and they'll get fucked up. 
---
&gt; They‚Äôre hard to deal with and can give the team info.
---
You know who else fits this description? Like half of the other defenders. Echo. Valk. Lesion. Mira. Pulse. Hell even Cav is more useful than fucking Clash. Sure Clash might have a higher survivability rate, but the ones i mention can give more info and pack a punch where Clash does not. She's not a good operator.
---
[Test](https://youtu.be/8-4mTvxwD_s?list=LLQpKG_cTNp-Ajvk4swKzt8w&amp;t=1321)
---
most legendary skins are pretty bad tbh, some hardly even rare worthy
---
Well you could desable everything but bomb, some people liked secure
---
Ubi actually seems to have optimized the game a bit, framerates are in general better on all maps for a majority of the PC players. Footsteps I'm not sure what you're on about, I've had no issues whatsoever with that.
---
Be happy you got plat, and keep grinding
---
A lot of people who play siege are aggressively competitive and impatient with newer players. If you can find at least one person to play with, you can't get vote kicked because it needs 4 votes (although players might teamkill you instead). If that's not possible, avoid ranked until it is. But in general playing solo can be a nightmare, so see if you have irl friends who you can play with, I highly suggest it. Also, wait about 5 seconds to choose your operator, because there are a good amount of people who vote kick because someone took their favorite player.
---
???????
---
I wonder if you can get it twice?
---
Lesion looks fucked sometimes too haha
---
Honestly Finka is just a bit more balanced in my opinion than Doc. She only gives like 15 extra health for not very long. Doc gives you a permanent health boost up until full, where it starts being temporary. It declines pretty slowly and its pretty annoying to be facing down a guy across a large room with about a hundred and fifty health.
---
That‚Äôs not a lot compared to others
---
Can I get a carry üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I was level 15 like a week ago and started playing again (got the game in November) and now I‚Äôm level 49 (Xbox)
---
East US here, I've been booted off the game more than 6 times today, 2 of which led to me being signed off playstation entirely.. Not sure if lag on my end (which happens often for me), Ubi's server side or if DDOSing is a thing? Came here to look for answers too.
---
In all honest, people keep saying how do you buff a god? But he just isnt fun. Even being bad isnt the problem. Being stationary on a turret isnt fun even if it was good.
---
Just headshot someone, thats how i got the trophy
---
If your truly a gold player you should get out of bronze pretty fast
---
I had a twitch drone battle today, I won but it was weird as fuck
---
*spawn peaks*
---
k/d
---
If you truly are a gold player you should have no problem getting out of bronze
---
Yea maybe
---
At least she didnt drop shot you on top of that. but dont worry theyll "fix" all these bugs next season so just sit tight
---
Mozzie is so underrated.
---
But what if you rage quit your match and you still won (by rage quit I do mean pulled out the wired connection to pretend it was the internet's fault) then it wouldn't be earned as much
---
We are closer to having inspect animations for the guns mmmmmmm

THATS FUCKING STUPID clash was already broken jesus
---
Very nice!!
---
Been seeing these kinda memes a lot recently, what's the original meme these are based on?
---
Lvl 100 is ez to get lol
---
I feel like this is fake. It obviously isnt, but my reaction to anything from r/pics is its fake.
---
Feminist? Smdh. üòÇI main Jackal/Thermite/Nomad (been playing lots of Sledge recently tho) and I‚Äôm very indecisive on defense, I use a shitload of operators, I‚Äôve bought all except 4 defense ops, while I‚Äôm missing like most of the attackers üòÇ but out of all of them I prefer Mute or Mozzie the best probably
---
This dude is playing Lost Vikings online against people? He'd probably still beat the people I queue with.
---
Ma man needs more mountain dew
---
I don't understand why you'd bring the operators into this when all but pre-nerf Lion barely see any play competitively. Lion literally had global wallhacks showing full enemy outlines and moving with them until quite recently, which is very different from a ping. Caveira has to pray to God she is going against a team that's below Gold level skill-wise to ensure that she can get off a successful interrogation to enable her ping. Jackal isn't good either. Alibi's holograms have a built in pinging system because her ability by itself would be too damn weak and even then she is barely played.
---
    None of these operators would be buffed by a removal of the spot warning except for Jackal. You already know if you shoot an Alibi holo that your position is revealed. You already know if a teammate is being interrogated that your position is revealed. You already know if you move during a Lion scan you will be pinged. The warnings are only there for new people. Jackal is the singular op that would be buffed and he can be adjusted if needed.
---
  "How about instead of scanning, you learn how to communicate with your voice and stop complaining about core mechanics that add balance."  
---
 There is zero difference between an Echo Yokai seeing 4 enemies in a room and him relaying that over chat followed by launching 2 sonic bursts and then your team raping everyone there compared to him taking a scan and the same thing happening. Which means that the mechanic doesn't balance anything, it just penalizes those without mics and those stupid enough to try to use a gameplay ability that they thought they were supposed to use. You're pretending as if shouting "4 guys kitchen" is somehow very difficult to accomplish which is a load of bunk.
---
Woo
---
Oh ok I thought I was a no life for playing for 11 days 10 hours and 28 mins
---
I'm unable to send any chat messages on PC right now. Could be some Ubi server shittery.
---
Nah... I'm level 95 in 4 months
---
This brings me back to high school when I did a shit ton of pen art. You should do an elite in stippling.
---
I know for sure one of them is to win 5 games flawless in ranked.
---
I was thinking of it because sometimes I can't see the DBNO indicator, and by the time I realise it, it'd be too late most of the time
---
Funny how rank and karma are so similar.
---
People take way too much stock in them, but they dont actually matter or do anything other than an ego boost.
---
Seriously, I just want the shields fixed to be fair. Shes not a skillful or dynamic operator to play as. She has no direct hard counters. Monty to be fun, and now I feel discouraged from playing as a shield op because it seems like whenever one of these bugs rolls around they release a broad spectrum nerf of the shields instead of just fixing the original problem and leaving it at that. Last time they took my ADS speed, which was the entire reason Monty was a credible 1v1 operator like he was originally built to be. 
---
What will it be this time, Ubi?
---
#shieldgang
---
Dear god
---
Im offically jealous üòõ
---
Nah, they're just who I choose. I use Bandito every now and then on my main acc and like all the time on my alt ones. I played Sledge hella heavy during R6 is magic, and sometimes I'll play Buck, but that's mostly for terro hunt or if IQ and Twitch are taken
---
Now that you say this I realize that I‚Äôve done the same thing
---
As a Mozzie main, I can confirm
---
Yeah, with or whitout a laser hipfire still spreads so your shots ain‚Äôt actually going where the laser is even though whe yoh Ads your sight is right in the laser. You were probably hitting his neck tho.
---
When N√∏kk exists...
---
It is dumb I agree. Which is why I further incentivize people to get a group of friends and play this game with them. You‚Äôll have way more fun and you don‚Äôt have to deal with the toxic bullshit. It‚Äôs a Win Win.
---
Whats your ubisoft name?
---
To bad I can‚Äôt ever play blitz in ranked again aye
---
none
---
That image made me chuckle
---
It's casual, drop in, have random fun and leave when done. It prevents top spots just being picked every match.
---
Dokkaebi looks like the medic from Team Fortress 2 :√ö
---
You're... very much wrong. Had a draw happen yesterday on PC in ranked. And also you can see Clash is still alive after the claymore explodes.
---
Thats the highest mmr within the season. Since everyone starts with 2500mmr, it shows that your highest mmr for any player under sliver 1 at the end of the season as 2500mmr.
---
Pretty dumb way of showing that info.
---
I don't think he means worse in the sense of powerful.
---
I think personally planning a round knowing that there is no Blitz to counter is much less stressful to me. And yet, Monty is more powerful than Blitz, especially in bomb mode.
---
Monty main btw.
---
Why can‚Äôt these people be banned
---
You posses true raw strength
---
Awww yea, hoping for more ways to purge the unclean (fire)
---
r/perfectloops
---
Well never actually removing it and just making it impossible until something changes and it's possible again. The more stuff they add the more options you get for exploits and the harder it becomes to fix. But in the end: The Basegame is flawed.
---
To be fair this probably only requires one pretty decent computer, just requires at least 5 monitors hooked up
---
Finka kinda does that, for the whole team
---
But finka has a lot of other bonus synergies that doc doesnt give, while having non of the weaknesses that doc has since he needs to aim and shoot to heal a player.
---
It's so satisfying to set up near their breach point (if they haven't spotted me).
---
I've got exactly the same problem; Tried everything, nothing really works. I'm about to reinstall the game as a whole to see if that does anything. I used to be able to play at High with a stable 70 FPS, now my PC has a hard time reaching 50 with everything on Low.
---
From what I know this isn‚Äôt a Ubisoft thing it‚Äôs whoever owns and controls the servers (I could be wrong - I don‚Äôt want to pretend like I actually know these sorts of things) 
---
However, I agree with you, dossing is a massive problem, especially among plats/ diamonds on console, I‚Äôm not sure how bad it is on PC I believe it‚Äôs a thing but maybe not so prevalent.
---
I‚Äôm at 258 with 1180 hours

That would be a sweet outfit

Looks like he was just flicking his analog stick around. It doesn't look like m&amp;k at all.
---
It's universal. All new ops can use it.
---
 Hello  What is the application?
---
Finished. Thank you for your hard work, I loved every bit of it! I hope to see a sequel with other operators *cough* Vigil vs N√∏kk *cough* in future!
---
Should add a mountain of (hostage) corpses behind him. 
---
/s
---
Looks great!
---
You'll remove impacts off his cold dead body. 
---
Dude can not only block upto 4-5 walls, he can impact trick to stop most inside walls. remove the c4 and give back the barb but stay away from the impacts.
---
It still works. Just last night (atleast my time, GMT +8) I experienced 2 games straight with people doing the exploits. I don't feel incentivized to keep playing until they fix her.
---
Idk what rank ur but high plats ban kaid 99% of the time
---
Yes it should be a thing, however I think cue times would be ridiculous and I wouldn‚Äôt get into a game
---
We will be team killing her until its fixed
---
Same, don‚Äôt really know where this conversation is going I just got excited when I seen another mute main. PS4?
---
Well i blame the community and Ubisoft. Everybody abusing that is a massive [insert insult], of course. But A) Ubisoft won't ban them for some reason and B) They just push new content even if the old one is still broken and this most likely breaks even more. I don't like how they handle it. It's a complex game so of course there a bugs and exploits, but just putting more stuff over it so you can't see it anymore won't fix shit.
---
What was ur rank last season
---
Nitro is better, he is able to deny plants  with nitro. This outrage is another example of Reddit not understanding how the game works at higher level play.
---
Yeah, like operation our game is shit so let us waste a couple of months and do nothing
---
They called it Vortex Optic in the Operator balancing notes [here]( https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/phantomsight/index.aspx). Just scroll down to the middle of the page
---
Yeah I do play PS4! And yeah I don't see that many Mute mains, I do see Mira alot tho, lol
---
I would play the old hereford instead of the new.
---
How many hours
---
Lmao
---
I meant to say second main my actual main is vigil
---
All you have to do is throw a frag(Sledge and Buck) at it, have thatcher waste an EMP, or have Zofia or Ash destroy it . Nearly all of the things I mentioned are almost always on an Attacking team, plus you won't here the screaming because no one except for cardboard elites is dumb enough to step in it.
---
Kaid is an even more powerful operator than he was before lol
---
dyslexia
---
It‚Äôs not even part of the expansion
---
This enemy team sucks, they keep dying the same way
---
This isn't a mistake, unless you already bought them. They were free for a little but ubi then reverted the change.
---
I wanted to play rainbow six and when I tried to open it it had a 9 gb update (nothing out of the ordinary) But when the update finished I was greeted with this error.

You can reinforce between bombs, but usually not all the way and the more important part is to make a rotation hole. Just "not reinforcing" is not enough.
---
Shield OPs plant with their shield on their back, useful sometimes.
---
There is no point in planting if you won't be able to defend it, and the defenders will mostly panic as soon as the plant is down, so calling it out is probably not the worst idea, after that you just have to hold angles.

I almost there but those omega pro doc mains are just playing too much they passed level 200 a long time ago
---
I bought 3 then got hacked so I wouldn‚Äôt reccomend but it all depends on what ops you main now or ops that are never not needed or you‚Äôll never get bored from I‚Äôd reccomend rook or twitch or someone balanced

Because balanced ops will never get changed to become shit

this game is unplayable

Well cav's pistol take same amount of shot to down someone as suppressed D takes to kill someone. If i can down someone as cav with 2 shots in 10 metres, deagle will kill them in 2 torso shots aswell. 
---
Not suppressing it doesnt makes a difference except u take 1 less shot at further away.
---
When you alt tab'd and got back to the game its fixing thr fps. But every round fps drops significantly and you have to alt tab and got back to game every round to fix fps. At least this is the stuation for me.

They were too broken before. The nerf on the smg-12 actually meant the c-75 was viable and currently I think both are balanced. The smg-11 wasn‚Äôt supposed to be used as a main weapon as it used to be on smoke. The bearing-9 was nerfed just cuz hibanas and echos main guns are already really strong and so is their pistol, but almost no one uses that lel. I dont like the changes but they are needed for a balanced game
---
Are you sure about the 8 wins? What is your username?

I love the idea

Not even shooting from the side of the shield smh. 0/10 for realism.

As stated the FMG 9 is a headshot machine, might need to get used to it

With the changes to the trophies/achievements as well, along with the infamous "data limits", I wouldn't be surprised if they completely remove TH to change Siege to purely PvP focus.

---
Mpx is a pea shooter, mx4 is a peashooter at range, and smg are made for cqb. not for long range. console doesnt matter as much because getting Diamond on console is so fucking easy as I hear every one say. witha mouse Scorpions recoil is pretry controllable, smg 12 is also pretty controllable. the fact that you cant control the recoil doesnt mea  that the gun is shit. and if you hit the head its a one shot and the more bullets you can fire per second, the more chances for a headshot. so yes firerate is pretty much everything. vector also has very bad dmg but it has a really high firerate. easy to hs with.
---
I'm going to leave it with this because you just cant see my point of view.

Sometimes it does feel that way. My apologies if I came off a bit strong but a lot of people don't understand how the ranked system works and there is a lot of misinformed people out there so I just wanted to stop this before people accepted it as the truth.

Not everyone likes bomb.. not everyone likes attacking/defend 3 rounds in a row. People are paying real money for elite skins, and operators, and not being able to play them due to the ban system.

Also don‚Äôt come back with some stupid rebuttal like ‚Äúgo play casual then‚Äù because we both know casual is a toxic mess where people could give 2 fucks about a win.

Hibana and Frost are arguably the nicest looking skins.
---
No it isn't it's based purley off of win or lose the actual reason is that your mmr wasn't put to the normal 2500 and was instead put to the halfway point between 2500 and your mmr score at the end of last season
---
I'm saying this because even right at the end of last season I saw a lot less toxicity in games. A lot of friendly people, had some laughs, good teammates. Now not so much

Why?

I‚Äôm honestly surprised I haven‚Äôt been kicked or teamkilled for playing Clash so far. I‚Äôm not a glitch abuser, this is the first season I‚Äôve gotten to use her. She‚Äôs actually a ton of fun. But some people can jump the gun a bit and tk or kick you if you pick an op that‚Äôs having issues. Luckily everyone‚Äôs given me a chance to show I play fair. While I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to main her, she‚Äôs definitely been neat to play around with strategies for

The vector has a better fire rate better recoil but loses by 2 hit points to the scorpion. And yet again fire rste doesn't matter as the scorpion is the second worst damaging in game for defense. And you're going to go off of things you've heard,  not seen or done?  Okay yeah you're really giving yourself credibility there pal. And yet again 75% of 25million is about 18750000. Which makes pc players make up about 6250000 players. 25% off that witch is the plats and diamonds who only get their stats recorded is only 1562500 players. Out of the 25million that exist that's so minuscule that any data from it shouldn't matter at all
---
I mean it's the exact same order exact same platform and almost coincidentally the same time. So I think it's highly likely we've played against each other

One you don't want another scorpion in game. Since it's pretty much the worst gun in game. And the acr is nothing like a scorpion. It's a rifle. The scorpion is a smg or carbine depending on the variant.

It really is the most viable. I understand they‚Äôre mad about it but this game isn‚Äôt meant to be easy. It‚Äôs suppose to push yourself and make you grind.

I think he needs some rework to not be that inpactful in bomb. Maybe a cooldown for the shots

That's a good idea. It would make people buy more skins. So it's a win win.

I hate it. I only splace secure area. But now the only way to play the only game mode I like is casual, which sucks. Everyone either just kills each other, leaves, or treats it like cod and no one cares about winning. Ruins the whole point of playing.

Was very noticed the other day playing it.  Makes it much more pleasing and at least a little more tolerable to play that map.

I was pointing out the bans in the image OP posted, not your choice bans.
---
I mean pick and ban really showed how bad some people really are. Look at KG, he was diamond every season but he's having a hard time with pick and ban and is now Plat 3 for for two days in a row.

Now pick and ban definitely needs the win round upped from 4 to 5 to balance out the one sided maps and trash maps like fortress and hardford.

restart the game . problem solved

I was reading somewhere that if UBI knows you're running a mouse and keyboard on PS4, they'll treat it the same way they treat any other cheaters and hit you with a ban. Is there any truth to that?

Not making the assumption at all, I‚Äôm simply telling you to not care about your rank. You said you and your friends wanted to climb, but they didn‚Äôt want to climb past plat 3 due to mouse a key players.. I get you want to have fun and it‚Äôs a problem, I‚Äôm just simply trying to help you make it less frustrating for when you do run into these players. Don‚Äôt take offence to everything anyone says dude, just trying to help.
---
Exactly, must be canon and must be serious. No more unicorn shit.
---
1) I literally just said that in another comment to you but that goes back to 3.  Queue times for diamonds would literally take 45 minutes to find a game. Also no one plays hostage and if you allow secure area hostage stans will bitch and then they‚Äôll all be back in. And like I said with smaller game modes a diamond hostage player even diamond SA player would probably be mid play level on bomb. 
---
4). Its more competitive because it isn‚Äôt a mode just to killing. You just said you don‚Äôt like casual because it‚Äôs cod like. SA is just a cooler version of cod if you look at it. It‚Äôs all about fragging and not any real tactics. Bomb needs to actually pick your ops, pick a strat and play the objective. You can also win by not killing everyone (not cod like). Whether you like it or not it takes more skill in bomb than any other mode
---
Good question. Probably by the time they fix the clash glitch.

Them double barrel 20 gauge shotgun gorilla glue nostrils are perfect that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs hard to watch, right?

# A REALLY BIG FUCKING HOLE COMING RIGHT UP
---
Game companies don't take consoles seriously anymore. They're very limited hardwarewise.
---
Warden is very situational so a lot of the time he's a dice roll. Nokk is really fun to meme rush with. I say Nokk.
---
I‚Äôd be fine with Echo going back to only one Drone, but the real issue isn‚Äôt that Echo and Montagne are so good, but rather that there aren‚Äôt operators who can impact the game as much as they can, and therefore they‚Äôll get banned a lot due to that. It‚Äôs my problem with Pick/Ban that I‚Äôve been saying for months now.
---
Let‚Äôs just use defenders, because this problem is a lot worse on the defender side.
---
So game of bomb, you‚Äôre trying to decide who to ban.
---
Echo, who has 2 invisible drones which can disrupt your push, remove Finka‚Äôs buff from operators, stop the planting of a bomb/thermite/breach charge. He has an ACOG, and a full auto secondary. 
---
Mira, who provides hard to counter intel on two zones. Allows a single defender to lock down an area. Enables bandit tricking on garages. Has a nitro cell, and a secondary shotgun, giving her the best map destruction on defense. 
---
Maestro. High damage, magazine, rate of fire weapon with an ACOG. Secondary shotgun for destruction ability. Has 2 cameras which provide intel, deal damage, can distract attackers which require your explosive resources to destroy. He can deny plants, and gives defenders a good stream of intel. 
---
Bandit. Can prevent the breaching of reinforced walls, countered by thatcher, but can overcome this with skilled play. Shines on sites which require attackers to breach a wall, such as garages. 3 speed, high rate of fire gun, nitro cell.
---
Kaid. Can prevent the breaching of reinforced walls and hatches. Countered by thatcher. Shines on sites which require attackers to breach hatches, such as basements. ACOG (only on single fire weapons). Nitro Cell.
---
Mute. Can prevent the breaching of reinforced walls. Can stop drones, Lion‚Äôs Drone, and Dokk phone calls. Countered by thatcher. Is a good pick if your opponent is running a combination of Lion/Dokk/Jackal. Gets a nitro cell and automatic secondary. 
---
So, I don‚Äôt think anyone will dispute that all of the operators I named are good operators, definitely worthy of playing and all able to influence a game in their own right. But the first three provide intel, which is huge in this game. They also enable the defending team to play different strategies than usual. The fact that Echo and Maestro can both deny a plant means that they don‚Äôt need a body in every objective watching out for the plant, allowing more people to roam and play site adjacent instead of on site. Mira has possibly the biggest impact of any operator, as she can turn some sites which are normally attacker skewed into a defender favored site by way of good placement. Armory Lockers on Border for example. The last three have two things that make them not worth banning. They all overlap a little bit in what they do, meaning that you cannot get rid of Counter Breaching entirely as a strategy by banning. If your team bans Kaid and the enemy bans Mute, Bandit is still in the game, and counter breaching is still a concern. Their abilities don‚Äôt enable a new strategy. They‚Äôre helpful, and can certainly win you a round if used right, but they don‚Äôt allow you to play off site like Echo, or completely lock down some angles like Mira. Since they‚Äôre not the ones who change the game the most, they will rarely get banned in favor of banning those who have a bigger impact. 
---
My problem with pick/ban, is that there‚Äôs not that many operators who really have such a big impact, and as such, we see the same ops getting banned over and over and over, meaning that Pick Ban is consistently removing the same content from the game more than it is adding an additional layer of strategy.
---
Mira‚Äôs L pose is still in the game?
---
Kapkan, I have come to bargain
---
&gt;Fortress,...,Chalet, Skyscraper 
---
I very much enjoy these maps, fuck off consulate, coastline and Hereford though. 
---
Problem is no one will ever agree on what maps are fair and balanced because they all play out differently at all ranks.
---
 I understand that consulate and coastline are realistically fine at diamond and pro league because of proper stats and players actually giving the info they have. 
---
 
---
Copper and bronze have it fine too because no one is playing properly so anything can happen.
---
 However in solo q plat /gold you get one talking player at best if they even speak your language vs a 4 stack doing copied pro league site executes.

At first it took forever for me to get new ops so  ended up buying them all but now that I have I notice I get renown way faster just from getting a little better. Honestly if you practice with what you got you‚Äôll find you can be getting a new op every two weeks maybe sooner if you play a lot. If you‚Äôre rather buy do what I did and buy the ops a whole year st a time so wait for like year one ops to go on sale and get the pack of all of them.
---
Which universe are you playing from ?
---
I think so, but I haven't tested this
---
No it still isn‚Äôt working. Guess I‚Äôll just wait and see what Ubisoft does about it.
---
If you play in the higher levels of ranked Warden will be more useful to help with smoke defuser plants. If you play mostly casual he will be pretty situational at best.
---
Nokk can be used to slow play. She can enter a map anywhere and stealth by the cameras and her silent step ability is great for moving in on players.
---
I wish people would fuck off with this circle jerk. As far as competitive multiplayers go, this game is pretty well balanced and constantly being watched over by Ubisoft.
---
I guess you don‚Äôt consider the new operators (which can be unlocked simply by putting time into the game) as ‚Äúuseful content‚Äù I guess the FREE maps they add in occasionally and the reworks to make things smoother aren‚Äôt ‚Äúuseful content‚Äù. 
---
Sure Clash is broken right now, and they‚Äôre trying to fix it, but don‚Äôt fucking attack the developers by saying they‚Äôre adding nothing useful to the game. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt play it.
---
Awesome haul! I need a Blitz keychain dude bad now, and i dint know that before
---
I'm on console not possible
---
Buck, cav and valk are 15, I'd buy Alibi

Sure, thanks!

Are you German? I'm learning the language, maybe I could practice a bit with you sometime haha.

I would reccomend reading this article on the subject which portrays both sides of the argument while coming to the conclusion that Nazism and fascism as a whole takes from both sides of the political spectrum.

Sorry I was being rude. I had some serious day last night. I will take on your opinion and thanks alot. Once again I'm really sorry.

That loop though. Impressed

Yeah I had some really serious day. I apologized to him.

Yeah I had some really serious day. I apologized to him. I agree. I was a fucking asshole.

Either way, the shotgun is not really for killing; it‚Äôs for utility. The DEAGLE does most of the killing while the shotgun provides for a silent means in two tap vaulting barricades, creating quick and quiet kill holes to launch flashes or get DEAGLE peeks through, silently rotating via hatches and whipping out in a clutch scenario where you‚Äôre holding a close range angle and somebody is rushing you.
---
It basically gives Nokk the ability to be a mini stealth-Buck. It‚Äôs got a quick reload, silencer with no damage penalty at 35 (top tier damage per shot for semi-shotties) and it takes her much closer to Cav in terms of gameplay, doubling down on that CQC.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Do you need your own barbed wire for the glitch, or is a teammate's one good?

New Season, Operation Expunged Hope is launched!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We provide you a 2 New USCRU (Unidentified Subject Capture-Removal Unit) Operators,
---
And New Gameplay mode : Annihilation Mode, a sequel of Operation Outbreak.
---
We introduce you Scar.
---
A light-armored Attacker who is very suitable for stealth gameplay.
---
His abilities are Stealth Charge and Grimlock Mk.2.
---
Stealth Charge replaces the original gadget section. When activated, it makes a circular hole in seconds enough for one man to vault in. 
---
It is very silent and doesn't produce fog compared to other breaching tools.
---
3 are given.
---
His unique tool is 'Grimlock Mk.2'.
---
It is device that could detect a sound that is produced nearby. running sound, unsuppressed gun fires and tool deployage is detected.
---
It has a limited range of 20m.
---
And the goggles covers an minor area of the player's view when activated.
---
Eliminate enemies with LYNX-PDW (AAC Honey Bader) with a pernament silencer and high rate of fire, or AR761 (SIG761) that uses a higher .308 NATO rounds.
---
For a secondary you have a MAX-9 (MAXIM-9) which is specialized in accuracy and stealth.
---
(Im sorry for what happened last night  [u/missuboo87](https://www.reddit.com/u/missuboo87) )
---
Cav is a psycho tho. Not a normal young person
---
Because people in this community are toxic.
---
Low level,  being level 108. Okay there buddy. Her max for fall off range is 18m so not too far past 15 so damage will likely be shit anyways. And when attackers can out range you,  out damage you. And no its not 28m until the scorpions drop off its 18m. Significantly worse. Yet again you get your stats wrong.
---
Well if you want mass destruction, Buck, if you want to be able to play a supporting role and/or drug-enhanced weapon of mass destruction, go Finka. If you do go Finka, don't bother using the Spear, it's DPS is shit. The competitively best option is the Lmg technically, but I tend to run the SASG  since it's more fun. Plus the SASG is good as a breaching tool for soft floors and hatches, so you can drop frag grenades and PMM/Pocket Cannon on the objective while boosting your teammates for pushes.
---
Boo hoo. The ranked changes are here to stay.
---
The bushes
---
Dont forget valkyries "we can do it" pose. Idk why they took these unique poses out. At least mira still gives the enemy the L if u have her shotgun on.
---
You mean og Jason voorhees?
---
the short shotty is a must have for a typical mira setup. you do not want to use the vector through a wall with its weedy damage. But I do love the usp,.
---
That‚Äôs not always true. I played only secure, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I suck in bomb. It may happen but that‚Äôs just bad luck.
---
And again, there are many games that have different gamemodes for ranked, wether it be Capture the point, Defend area, Team deathmatch and so on
---
You can vault into the space there, he can only shoot out from a couple of specific angles though, he could throw other gadgets out though.
---
Then it‚Äôs just a visual glitch
---
Someone who is not a mute main, I miss this pose as well
---
&gt; That‚Äôs not always true. I played only secure, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I suck in bomb.
---
It means you will likely be lacking in knowledge.
---
&gt;there are many games that have different gamemodes for ranked, wether it be Capture the point, Defend area, Team deathmatch and so on
---
So what? Utterly irrelevant what other games do.
---
Fix this ubi
---
You can‚Äôt refund items bought on Xbox, at least I don‚Äôt think so
---
Proof?
---
Ranked players will continue playing ranked, even after they attempt to boycott it. They'll eventually come back, regardless of the removal of their modes. Just that they'll spend more time in casual now than before.
---
Everyone is going to give you their opinion. There‚Äôs no definitive answer. A lot of things have to be considered like map, your teams playstyle and whether or not you‚Äôre defending first.
---
patch notes
---
Did they.. Reinforced in between the bomb sites?
---
Ohhh ok thanks
---
I‚Äôve looked and can‚Äôt find anything on it.
---
Hahaha ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ so funny üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£
---
blame operation health, its a great cover up
---
I agree 100%.
---
&gt;It means you will likely be lacking knowledge
---
What I meant is I play bomb in casual, so I have knowledge
---
And for the second point, that‚Äôs mostly a personal preference of yours but ok.
---
The Frost Mat change is good. Certain attackers with low DPS guns literally couldn't vault windows with a Mat under them because they couldn't do 100 damage fast enough. Generally you either shoot the Mat or you don't, so the change should only affect people who are paying attention. Most Rushers don't pay attention, and that's backed up by the stats. Frost Mats actually had the highest rate of effectiveness at Diamond (it's an older infographic from about a year ago, but probably still accurate), where players rush in faster and look at the ground less.
---
The Kaid change is nonsense, though. No reason to remove wire. His other gadget could have been replaced with C4.
---
Not excited about the Twitch change. Good players will just control the recoil and it'll still be a stupidly high DPS gun. I've been a Valkyrie running into a Twitch more times than I can count, and unless I hit a headshot the Twitch automatically wins the gunfight even if I shoot first.
---
Just go to his channel, Mr Homeless, his latest video
---
It seems your misunderstanding what I‚Äôm saying... I want to play the game mode I prefer and play against people who are the same skill level as me in that game mode. I used to run bomb and secure turned on (I think hostage is broken) but the point stands removing secure doesn‚Äôt solve any real problems for bomb only players. 
---
Don‚Äôt have any stats that why I said I surmise but you realize every shooter eventually dies right?
---
Observation tools under Improvements
---
Both of them. Weekly Ubisoft challenges give 250 each, and daily 150 each.
---
ur not gonna like it if u cant play it often
---
They take away the pose and give him a secondary that makes his shotgun viable. We can‚Äôt have nice things :(
---
Uhh is this the first time you've looked up? This painting has always been up there. There were actually several more, including some with nude children which they removed (thankfully).
---
When a good player uses her, and you're on a clutch situation, man she is absolutely lethal and insanely annoying, almost makes you wish you'd get shot in the head through her shield
---
&gt; What I meant is I play bomb in casual, so I have knowledge
---
In casual...
---
&gt;And for the second point, that‚Äôs mostly a personal preference of yours but ok
---
Personal? Er what?

Doubt it. My friends are all playing Borderlands 2 together and the mp game right now is Rocket League. There are lots of r6 nerds who only play r6, but most people have choice, and when one game takes options away you go and play other stuff.
---
Engine doesn‚Äôt support mid round operator changed (or if it does ubi is too lazy to implement)
---
Ranked game modes in games are meant to introduce a ranking system so you play against people in a similar rank as you. That drives competition. Secure is competitive. When you get into plat and diamond it is very competitive and has its own meta separate from bomb.
---
Ultimate edition stopped being so ultimate January of this year, when Ubisoft took out the base operators from the bundle to nickle and dime more money out of new players. Pretty scummy shit if you ask me. They don't really clarify well either on their store.
---
I did play it in ranked too, but since it‚Äôs not my cup of tea I just play it randomly in casual
---
And yes, it is personal preference. You prefer to play a tactical shooter with only one gamemode, while I like to play a tactical shooter that would give me a choice
---
You could use the same argument for hard breachers  and not utilizing their gadget.
---
They must've hit it twice on the bottom.
---
I tried it out on some casuals and TH and it's amazing!
---
I said "used" which I corrected, I used the right "your"
---
Thank you kind sir, was looking for this
---
Thanks ubi to give this challenges while my wifi decides not to work. :)
---
&gt;I did play it in ranked too, but since it‚Äôs not my cup of tea I just play it randomly in casual
---
And your knowledge will reflect that.
---
&gt; And yes, it is personal preference. You prefer to play a tactical shooter with only one gamemode, while I like to play a tactical shooter that would give me a choice
---
The quote you replied to had nothing to do with what I do or do not prefer. Complete non sequitur.
---
Nah I meant the title, ‚Äúyou game‚Äù
---
SA is not competitive. The maps are unbalanced around it and would not work for 3 defend and attack. Same with hostage. That's the fact.
---
So is killing a medic that did not fire a gun, but so what? The Japanese did anyway. I would know I  ~~didn't~~ fight in the Battle of Okinawa.
---
Ok my bad
---
what about castle?
---
Oh, I didn't even catch that
---
Komail why are you replying like this
---
This. It's much more conducive to a competitive match by rewarding communication a lot better.
---
It‚Äôs really not lessened. People not having a clue is your perceived knowledge on that player. A lot of this people genuinely do not care. A lot of players only go to gamechat to bitch and complain and not give callouts. Those people will still be in rank. Their knowledge and their use of it is very similar to having a mic. They might have it but don‚Äôt use it.
---
I'm playing through gold right now and my group always insta-bans Jackal and we usually ban Echo, Lesion or Mira, it's so nice. The other team almost always bans Blitz and Echo if we don't, I haven't seen too many worthless bans in the 15-20 games I've played outside of blitz.
---
Ah. Which convention covers that sort of thing?
---
Jes
---
cuz i don‚Äôt know how to reply like a reddit user lol

Reading the FAQ shouldn't be required. When the actual store page for the ultimate edition says: [https://store.ubi.com/uk/game?dwvar\_5c586c7d29e123fd15c55bc6\_Platform=pcdl&amp;pid=5c586c7d29e123fd15c55bc6](https://store.ubi.com/uk/game?dwvar_5c586c7d29e123fd15c55bc6_Platform=pcdl&amp;pid=5c586c7d29e123fd15c55bc6)

 **LEGACY OPERATOR BUNDLE**  
---
 Instant access to all 24 Operators from Year 1, Year 2 and Year 3 
---
Most players would take that to mean that all the launch ops will be unlocked. I think it is reasonable to assume. They don't overtly say anywhere that you won't get the launch operators. It is intentionally misleading to extract more money out of players.
---
This pose was literally the only reason I started using the shotgun with him.
---
Its donut operator btw
---
Indeed. And now he's here to fuck us!
---
Well that was a painful word salad.

I brainfarted in the end. Didn't realise what was happening anymore.

cool but id say its distracting
---
I don‚Äôt know if this helps because I‚Äôm pretty low level but what I do is flank the enemy while they are distracted by my team which usually leads to me being able to get behind at least one enemy then I take them out. 
---
So I pretty much try to be As stealthy as possible
---
I wish I was that talented
---
I was trying to always pick Clash so exploiters cant use her or at least TK them if they exploit
---
**RIIIISE**
---
Honestly I cannot stand the new ranked, to me I like variety but when my entire team plays the same operators three times in a row it just seems repetitive, it could be I‚Äôm not used to the new system but I have lost most interest in ranked because of it and so have all of my friends.
---
I agree, or even 6 like pro league
---
Queue* and it‚Äôs mostly because you‚Äôre off prime time and plat is the least populated rank (diamond has more players than plat 2 for instance).
---
I played it twice in ranked and every time they came through windows or bottom.
---
I NEED A WEAPON
---
fyi using different weapons leads to different poses
---
The Russia Day Challenge is until next Thursday, but the weekly challenges are until Tuesday.
---
Ohh I see, that‚Äôs a good idea actually, I‚Äôll do that
---
Not needing hearing aids later in life is probably a good start.
---
She's like the bald, angrier blitz
---
Eh it‚Äôs different from cod I just bought it on ps4 a couple days ago and it‚Äôs very active.
---
I die all the time but I‚Äôm sloooooowwly getting better very very slowly lmao I managed to get one or two kills per round. 
---
Anyway imo it‚Äôs a fun game that is very hard to get into but when you do you will enjoy it so much. The deluxe edition is on for $15 bucks online so it‚Äôs a good deal.
---
Navy SEAL copypasta.
---
yeah basically eh...
---
yeah.
---
Yeah? Why were people upset?
---
Dont forget to press B to change your gadget from stun to a breaching round. Zofia has 2 types of grenades. 4 in total
---
Breaking the glass behind the barricade, that way when I jump out it makes less noise.
---
'need' is a strange word choice.
---
It's nice to shoot with, dampens muzzle flip and kills the sound/muzzle blast.  Also if god forbid I'd ever need to pewpew a home intruder I won't do permanent hearing damage in the process, tinnitus ain't nothing to fuck with
---
it was at the most 27 days actually (just under a month) still, clash was/is a weird character just as a concept, of course she is gonna have glitches, for now, just ban her in ranked, or play custom games with friends, in casual you can just leave, so it's not gonna be as big as a problem.
---
Stupid sexy Flanders
---
Could you notify me When its fixed?
---
I need a desk to lay my head down on after being crushed in ranked.
---
all 20 base operators cost 25k together if you buy every single one of them, so its pretty much 1 dlc operator.
---
Now I wish I went that shiza is dope
---
Lesion. Probably the best allround defender
---
why does this exist
---
no......
---
Idk why they would basically delete a map to add a completely different one. New Hereford is entirely different, should have just been a different map. If they're going to force us to learn these completely new floorplans they could at least keep the old ones around when we want them.
---
Meanwhile objective location is still unknown, becuase RED doesn't update it for some reason..
---
I‚Äôm thinking maybe he will get s buff here soon hopefully. Nothing too drastic just allow him slightly more flexibility when peeking smokes because as it stands he doesn‚Äôt really excel at the situation he is meant for at all. I‚Äôm ok with the fact that Glaz is stronger in the interaction between the two but Warden should at least have a decent chance.
---
What about an attacker
---
&gt;I shot at the closed mirra window to bring them out , which worked.
---
To be fair, doing things because they work on bad players is not a good habit to get into
---
Anything that brings down the volume of a gun firing is a good thing. You want to take every precaution you can. That's true for the range, but ESPECIALLY true for a home defense gun.
---
Suppressors can also help with recoil.
---
And, crucially, they look cool.
---
He's a legend in the Siege community, goddamn madman. He usually starts his videos off with a little goofing around which can definitely be strange, but he's been playing Siege, especially ranked, with anything from guitar hero controllers to voice commands on Airpods. Plus his persona is really entertaining, I'd reccomend you scroll down and start watching them all, because they're pretty great
---
the only person with a unique pose ;\_\_\_\_; i wish each op had a pose. it doesn't have to be flashy, just a small shift in stance to show their personalities.
---
The Vortex Holo for the Fmg9 also works for Smoke. They also had to move devs to work on Ghost Recon and other games.
---
What about an defender
---
She gets banned because the glitch is back
---
Or just have both, cuz I hate the new one and the old one wasn't well designed but I still really liked it.
---
I honestly think Siege was meant to be played on PC. I started off on Siege on PS4 but the community on PS4 is just so toxic. From the ddosing to using a MnK agasint controller users.
---
can i bring it to school for show and tell
---
well , to be fair ... lol [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E55t0lnp\_8M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E55t0lnp_8M)
---
Siege is definitely a fun game, probably on console as well. If you're not gonna get into competetive then the PS4 game of Siege will definitely be worth it. However if you do want to go into Ranked (Siege's competetive gamemode), then you might be in for something new. From what I've heard, Siege's competetive mode is riddled with people who use an attachment in order to use mouse and keyboard (especially in the higher ranks) to get an advantage over people with a controller. 
---
Not sure how many you'll encounter but either way it might make a fun game to play for you

My friends hate nokk they left nokk unbanned and she was annoying so they just banned her

Nice gun, which state are you in?
---
Ur drunk go home.

My Operation idea:
---
**Operation:** Last Man Standing
---
**Operators of Delta Force:**
---
1. ATKer Stinger. (3/1)
---
**Guns:** 300Blk Honey Badger, 6.8 ACR, Glock 19 Pistol, Fullsized Uzi
---
**Gadget:** HCM/ ICU 3x: Regenerates 20 health and grants short andslight running speed boost, can be used while downed.
---
2. ATKer Ghost. (2/2)
---
**Guns:** JAE M14, AD MK13, Glock 19, Fullsize UZI
---
**Gadget:** Cryogrenade 2x: Liquid Helium grenade that makes Reinforced walls and barricades, breakable in 4 hits.
---
**Map:** Lockout: A sand castle somewhere in Iraq. Small Map with many breaching points.
---
That's all i envisioned so far.
---
I don't think so.
---
Well I.Q. Is cheaper
---
Or just completely disable debris collisions for 1 second (and is on the ground).

Ubisoft be changing the smallest things

If you were going against good players that cam would have been shot down 0.02 seconds after the attackers spawn in, but good nonetheless.

just replace the new one with a much better old one

It's just frustrating because for me it's between having low fps natively running it, or streaming on geforce Now and having input lag.

same shit

I love his shotgun so much I've started using it on smoke and mute as well lol
---
Because of the lack of content üòÖ
---
Original price is 25k so I guess it went down by 5
---
I stand corrected
---
How can you prevent people from being stupid? It's not like ubisoft can invent a magical mind reader. The closest thing they can do is add a trust factor system. Players with low trust factor only play with low trust factor players. Pretty much like csgo but it won't stop theassive horde of idiots doing it.
---
He most likely was ubi‚Äôs attempt at trying to stop the smoke plant meta. But didn‚Äôt really turn out well.
---
Oh good point.

You can detect it. Fortnite picks up what you're using and puts you in a lobby with similar inputs

Nope, you'll have to make smurf.

Seems R6 devs are playing a bit too much CoD...... But really op I'm not sure how recently you started playing but this is a glitch and we have seen something like it a few times but it must e gotten so bad that during last season they removed her and ballistic shields entirely
---
Outplayed haha, nice one
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a quote from somewhere
---
Some people wanna derank, some people treat ranked like casual, if they arnt doing well they leave, and some disconnect due to internet issues
---
Streamers over exaggerate which often gets them more attention. Just because a guy that streams Rainbow did one glitch with said operator and then proceeds to ‚Äúf***ing hate‚Äù said operator doesn‚Äôt warrant a ban.
---
they are both great. lesion is more beginner friendly, but mira is bae.
---
Because then what is the point of having ranked??
---
That's a bit like saying why cant the NFL have two different versions of football.
---
Yeah the failsafe doesn‚Äôt work, I honestly don‚Äôt know why they don‚Äôt just give her like a bulletproof camera or something else until the actual fix is deployed when she can then get her wire back

he is british, doesnt know how to use guns properly because all they are allowed are single shot .22lr
---
[oi intensifies]
---
I had it happen to me this morning.
---
I respect his point of view cause he looks at the game from fun perspective.
---
Good luck shooting through Castle's barricade lol. That's precisely why he has to be picked with Mute, you're basically asking to get fuzed.
---
Some people just want to get the copper charm since it's actually more rare than Diamond.
---
So they just find a game and leave. This happens a lot at the beginning of the season. Either they leave or they purposely throw.
---
I was going to leave a similar comment
---
&gt;Just because people don't play the most competitive version of a game doesn't mean they should just play casual
---
Ummmm....yeah. That is exactly what it means lol.
---
Power ranger squads?
---
That defender is interesting :)
---
Can we all agree to stop posting this?
---
Mods this post
---
ok but how in the world do you already have black ice for the R4-C, when i‚Äôve been playing this game since 2016 and i only have 2 black ice guns total! hahaha
---
Parks and rec reference, not the office.
---
Lesion
---
1. As I stated, casual is unplayable for some people. Theres lots of reasons and I dont want to start that conversation here.
---
2. A recruit with a frag and 2 breaches or smokes and 2 breaches brings just as much or more than Fuze, and they aren't slow as shit. GSG9 recruit on defense is arguably a better choice than Cav, Tachanka, and maybe Castle.
---
y no new holo tho
---
Something new and unique :)

God I hate this youtuber

I get your point, but your argument doesn't hold up too well. You disprove yourself in your own evidence. Sure those things were in the game at release, but they've all since been removed. Case in point right there alone. Those things are completely gone (for the greater good). The only spawn peaks that get removed or worked are ones that are truly game-breaking. I'm aware that they still exist for extended periods of time bc patches take time and so on, but they typically do get fixed. I also don't recall making the parallel of "x has been in the game for a long time, therefore it's good..."
---
All the feedback says YES buy it. I'm okay with a learning curve. I just want to have fun. I had the opinion console was dead. People with keyboards on ps is nothing new to me (still dont like it). I'll buy it later today. 
---
Sorry for ranting on one comment. I'm new and dont know how to post on my original yet
---
Yes, 3 years ago
---
yeah because the recoil isnt that bad for me. if you are in the average gun fight distance which is less then 15 meters there is no dmg drop off yet.
---
the dmg drop off argument doesnt really work for a 3 speed that can close the gap so quickly.
---
Anyone thinks his head looks like a guy in a rubber mask?
---
It was the very first alpha pack that I opened! Look at my posts for evidence lol
---
tosic
---
Right, but does that warrant a ban on Jackal because Macie said one thing after one glitch?
---
Or a bulletproof cam
---
Console is full of "pro MLG" guys who rush in, get killed first, and then vote to kick anyone on their team who plays calm and collected
---
Old clip
---
After the MP5 nerf Echo's version actually deals more damage per shot compared to Rook's/Doc's.
---
I had to buy a pack for my other one to show up.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about the attacker, seems like it would require a lot of team work to use the ability which sucks if you solo queue, provided that the load out doesn‚Äôt include a secondary shotgun, defender seems neat though
---
Yea I agree
---
&gt;All of the recent changes are great and all
---
Are they though? Did we really need changes to Cafe? Who asked for banning operators? No new map? This update is shit.
---
I just see how often he gets banned during my placement matches.
---
Ok...?
---
restart your game , problem solved
---
Blitz,jackal,cav, and clash is all i see gettn banned..u think this ban system will give some info to ubi about their operators
---
Has been military slang for a hot minute
---
Hmmm you still base your argument off many,  actually too many variables. In drone situations closing the gap is sometimes impassible,  and especially in a game where you can die in less than a second closing the gap when already being engaged at by a enemy is just too much to rely upon to work.
---
I bought aPack after the game and didn‚Äôt come up
---
Oh yeah, stupid season pass
---
Restarting the game seemed to recover the alpha packs for most people. The game crashing this is stupidly common rn so they‚Äôll probably fix that soon enough
---
Clearly you‚Äôve never match point 3-0 recruit flex
---
The amount of times this has been posted outnumbers stars in the universe 
---
I doubt mouth breathers will stop
---
Love him too but he‚Äôs soo good if the enemies take their time. He can be a little annoying so I see why people would ban him. Still want my elite skin tho :(
---
If he couldn't shoot from behind the shield Blitz  wouldn't be a problem and he'd barely be banned. They buffed him too far and now he needs to come down a bit.
---
This fucking update
---
the alpha pack thing happened to me yesterday and i was so confused on how it houdini‚Äôd out of my inventory
---
edit: just logged in right now just to find my alpha pack waiting for me, maybe just restart your game and see if that works
---
Sexy
---
that‚Äôs tock sick
---
You're right lol
---
they took clash out for like a month and still didnt fix it
---
Lol that's insane, I guess this is why they primarily investigate counterfitting as opposed to security details
---
I genuinely hate DBL Online. He has singlehandedly ruined the game for weeks at a time on several occasions. All it takes is a video to Ubi support and stuff like this will be fixed, but obviously sending it to Ubi support won't get DBL those views and YouTube clout so he has to ruin the game for everyone by widespreading glitches.
---
He's completely talentless and completely uncapable of earning viewers like every other big name in the Siege community does so his last resort for any kind of YT career is this shit.
---
You can also ban Jaeger and throw frags through the drone hole. Or bring Maverick instead of Thatcher.
---
They're a lifesaver for me. I turn them up a lot so I can wear ear plugs under the headphones but still hear people who are talking to me. It helps when shooting indoors since the gunshots are so amplified.
---
honestly jackal isnt broken. There is a fine line broken and annoying. Jackal for example is annoying, same with blitz and many more. Clash is broken not because of her ability because she is literally glitched. Old ash with r4-c acog wasnt broken either. People just play ops like jackal and ash because they‚Äôre easy to understand where as someone like dokkabei might be more confusing.
---
Thankyou bro ;)
---
Yeah there is, when someone is planting the bomb an echo blast to the person planting will disable the plant so in clutch moments when the attacker is getting that last second plant off you basically get a free win on defense.
---
wtf What rank is this? I‚Äôm still placing but never got new ops banned so I can play them hehe. Usually I see blitz or jackal banned.
---
Probably going to be January 1st, as usually done when celebrating a birthday when its unknown
---
You mean the 5 man shield meme recruit ultimate squad. 
---
Best flex.

---
&gt;im gonna stop this thread right here
---
Camp camp camp
---
It's really good but let's say you're defending first on Hereford, that pretty much means your team won the game. I think it should be ESL map pool only for ranked.
---
I HATE bomb. Been playing since Day1  and always hated it. I hate the new banning phase, I hate the 3 rounds in a row bullshit. 
---
I hate how the wannabe pro players are dictating the game for the rest of the community.
---
Depends on what you are asking about.
---
I remember when I was like you, a secure main.... boy do I not miss those days
---
Yea man i can imagine, thats frustrating especially since theres a mmr gain decay depending on how many games you play, the beginning of the season is crucial to push while youre gaining 100 mmr per game
---
Thanks, i've been playing the game on and off the season for years now. I know differences surfaces sound difference, callouts but i never really address this issue of me unable to trust my ears on this game.
---
US secret service and yeah i think n√∏kk works under gsg9 but I‚Äôm not sure
---
Shut up
---
The multiple blitz icons really don't do it for me
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Why does anyone care that you're jobless? What bearing does that have on anything in this post? Unless you're just looking for attention
---
Is your ps4 setup with your account being the main one? Or is someone else's?
---
Id say similar to hanging from the ceiling yes. If the operator has the proper gear.
---
No one mentioned mutant powers so I don't think walking on walls is what is being discussed here.

You can always have fun from any game mode. If people wanted  100% fun, they would never have touched ranked. they wanted ranked fun and they'll do anything to have it.

He's watching Fuze fuck 5 people (and a hostage) all at once
---
I just feel as if his gadgets don't really fit with his intended playstyle at all. Give him breaching tools? BB isn't a breacher, it just doesn't make any sense.
---
More like Blitz, ash, echo, and bandit
---
Already better for me than the last 2 ops

https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Jaeger_Corps

My bad this is it
---
Being someone who works a 9 to 6 job everyday i feel you. I also still play three to five hours a day. But the world doesnt revolve around you either. Your friends should adapt and learn or accept that they are going to be at a disadvantage in the game. Thats just the reality of it.
---
If you think BB is OP you don't know how to deal with him properly and that's not my fault.
---
EA ready gameüëå
---
Doesn't Doc have the P90? I thought there already was a defender with the P90.
---
I wanted to ensure that people don't take the speculation as a major topic of discussion nor do they take it as something to prove wrong. I wanted to make it clear that it was a light hearted, casual, speculation.
---
if it's a grapple gun for hatches and outside use likely yes, if I'm wrong it might have an ammo thing telling you how many you have left to use.
---
I console share with my brother so it‚Äôs someone elses, i believe we both own copies of the game tho because we bought them before we console shared, my account definitely has a purchased license
---
that‚Äôs false lol Caviera interrogations brings something to the team. Recruit absolutely does not at all.
---
I think this really prevent me to reach diamond. It really brings me down when im trusting my ears and yet the enemy is not even in that direction. It'll stuck on my head and ruins the entire match flow
---
BB is one of those operators that is sort of in a "meh" state at this point.
---
Had the same thing
---
I don't have any good teammates, I solo queue. It's just silly game design is all, giving BB breaching tools when he's not a breacher. Doesn't fit with his intended role.
---

There is

ya everyone keeps going on and on how great bomb is. I have yet to see what makes bomb great. If anything its just more annoying.
---
Will they use pre used guns again? I think its very likely. I'd also imagine we'll see a lot of new ones as well.
---
You got that MMR before you where ranked
---
Ive seen someone try it before (until i tk'd them) and it is like a ritual. I vaguely know how to do it, from the one time someone on my team tried it, and it is almost impossible to accidentally do it.
---
Did I say that? Point out what part of my statement says he's OP. Don't make assumptions.
---
He's "fundamentally broken". He violates the 1shs rule of siege and makes it where under no circumstances would your TTK against him in a head-on gunfight be lower than his to take him out, but he isn't without counters.
---
But, broken ops don't need buffs. Simple stuff.
---
PS4 servers down
---
Thanks man
---
Doc and Rook both have it.
---
I thought the op with the grappling hook would be a defender so other objectives could be more viable, but will see.
---
Also, a deployable shield with a canister full of fire? That's weird.
---
That bio description is a whole nightmare
---
Welcome to Rainbow Six.

Hello Hagoku, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c09p59/hello_everybody_i_uploaded_my_new_r6s_montage/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Both.
---
Since they saw our reaction to the reused guns, I'm pretty sure they won't repeat it. Also the developers have been through so many work lately; kafe rework, new ranked, the new ballistic shield, the glitches etc...
---
I never said you said BB was OP, read it again. I said "If"...
---
Where is this first rule of siege? lol. You've never heard of armor levels or finka or doc??? If you really think TTK in a head on fight doesn't vary all the time depending on tons of variables (like weapon damage and fire rate) then you have no idea what you're talking about... 
---
Just stop lol.
---
Yeah that co-ordinated is going to shit all over a Caviera. And relying on an operator to may e do something is a waste of utility.
---
How do you practice for an ace, I want t oml learn your secrets.
---
Ps4 severs are down

they cant just entirely change an ops gadget

Now the better question is why did you ban thermite

Does he mean a new defender?

u/vredditdownloader
---
I think Rook has it too
---
As someone who is amish, i miss this pose as well.
---
I got bamboozled
---
How come she‚Äôs locked from casual?
---
Quite possibly that the main account (your brother's) doesn't have the license. Since yours does you can play on only that account. And your brother can play it on his ps4 because your account is main on his.
---
epic
---
Im assuming so. Its honestly hard to tell.
---
But why is there a Ranked Icon right next to it? 
---
And in Burnt Horizon my Highest is Correct
---
Ah right ok, ty
---
What the actual fuck is wrong with people like you? He clearly hit his shot..... then his ghost died to bandits spray, how does that show he sucks in any way? He should have won the fight but UBI-shit can't make a game work properly.
---
When this happens and people just say "its cos your bad!" its just petty.
---
It is really nice tho, and now 3 ops have the deagle :)
---
Congratulations! Until the next one :)
---
&gt; Let me also remind you that maps are designed for bomb,
---
LOL no they are not. Thats the main reason why me and my friends never played bomb. It was clearly an after thought game mode.
---
Could be an anchor for info, or use the drones to spawn peak/roam
---
I don't, plane only? No thanks

This is horrible as I am seriously enjoying myself playing as Clash right now!

To be fair Ubisoft do have to fight with the limits of their engine
---
That's half of the idea of what I was thinking.  Report them for a specific thing, add in an overwatch system where higher ranked people can review the games (for benefits), and punish them with a ban if they are proven to be an offender.
---
Do you even know how hard it is to develope this kind of game? If you think it is easy then create one for yourself.

They thought the failsafes would but they were bypassed

Do what everyone else does and go to ranked and derank. Ubi ruined casual with sbmm.

no.
---
From what I've heard, the glitch works in such a way that you'd pretty much have to take away barbed wire from everyone for that workaround to be viable.
---
Shield mains unite, to stop this horrific evil.

Which is why I think the 'overwatch' system in CSGO would be great for RB6.  People can review vods, and you can CLEARLY see if they did it intentionally or not.

Welcome to downtown Coolsville.
---
Ban is needed!!!   
---
Why? Because it was publicly announced that it is an glitch/exploit and thus not allowed 
---
So if people do it twice they should get a warning - if they used it more a ban/season ban
---
Can u just not do that
---
They do, but it's hard to control your hidden casual mmr. A lot easier to guarantee your opponents in ranked.
---
Latest update (2:34pm EST) on [status.playstation.com](https://status.playstation.com) is that services are down but their engineers are working on it.

like what?

I've done nothing but teleport bread for three days!
---
Wtf is with ban, I don‚Äôt dig it at all
---
The exploiters are to blame for doing what they do but some of these issues are repeat offenders and for that you can‚Äôt forgive ubi. Something in the code is not right and if they need an operation health 2 to fix things then they should just come out and say that instead of making new content. We have enough in the game already and can skip a quarter for the long term longevity of the game we love.

Lol not looking for anything from anyone for defending Ubisoft. Just sharing my perspective. Yes, they need to fix the issue, that's obviously the best course of action, but no one seems the least bit annoyed with the people who try to find these exploits as quickly as possible and then post tutorial videos online teaching equally shitty players how to do them. No one's hands are clean in this, but the way I see it, removing Clash as quickly as they did is the right step, and not something we ever saw happen in the last 3 years.
---
This doesnt look like an advantage actually
---
I'm sure they're trying, but I'm avoiding Ranked for the time being.
---
Because Shakal ability is so annoying. It just causes random and shitty situations. ‚ÄùYes, let‚Äôs scan some footsteps where a defender were a minute ago and he can‚Äôt do anything about it‚Äù It‚Äôs not OP or anything like that.

Has to be multiplayer
---
Close the game untill the fixes come...
---
It most certainly is not a huge undertaking.  It would just require them to want to do it.  Recording games can literally be done by a single person not even related to UBI as a third party program.  Almost every single game I can think of pre-recordings had some random person make a 3rd party program to record games.
---
Also, I'm not sure why this is such a major issue wanting them to take time to make something that will actually IMPROVE RB6....
---
I can only speak for myself, but the casual rule set frustrates the hell out of me. Not to mention some maps in there shouldn't exist (looking at you, Favela).
---
Excuse me what the fuck!? How did they ban five operators?
---
Oh ok
---
Oh well. Having her back was fun while it lasted
---
Stop talking out your ass kid, gtfo my comment.

Restart your game.

Voila.

Maybe it time to update your policy and  ban fuckers that use this shit?

They shouldn't though.  You can be banned for being boosted, so there is literally no reason to not being able to be banned for exploiting.

Are you saying something like OBS is comparable to CSGO's Overwatch? I feel like I've misunderstood what you've wrote because that's just so wrong I don't think you could even write that in good faith.
---
aw fuck bro
---
I agree, a 2/2 switch would be better and maybe a extra round to balance it out but ESL maps would probably be better for ranked with this system.
---
Yeah but when you stuck in a wall
---
Get reported for glitching
---
Get banned
---
What you doing now
---
Jackal, I fell like he has more usability
---
Obviously wouldn‚Äôt be surprising
---
I can't load into the game period it just says "For some reason Tom Clancys Rainbow Six Siege took too long to start."
---
Ye but at least I bought the doodoo brown phantom sight uniform for ela lmao
---
Just the fact that they claim they have failsafes in the game when they clearly don't just proves that they're completely incompetent
---
It's the game banning clash. Same as with ranked reborn. The auto can from the game on clash has been reactivated as people found new ways to glitch.
---
I MAIN CLASH
---
Leave Bans can occur bcs somebody has crashes or DCs in somewhat respective to this but if you TK once you can't get banned or kicked for only one time (with RF it's almost like self killing) but if you do this on purpose by throwing c4 and detonating you should get much more higher ban penalty since it's 100% on purpose
---
5 rounds would be worse. If anything the solution is more rounds, as people are unlikely to win all the attack or defense rounds if there are a lot of them. Unfortunately the R6 maps don't all have enough bomb sites to lock out 3 sites, so they'd have to unlock sites. Also match times could get pretty long. Regardless, the opponents have the same disadvantage that you do after the swap, so really that's not an excuse.
---
Oh yeah his pick rate will drop like a fly.

Not ops gadget but whole fucking operator.

Which is weird, because they did the exact opposite with IQ and claymores. They removed claymores from everyone rather than disable IQ.

It just came off as kind of... Sad
---
&gt; Because you are calling in help from OUTSIDE the game to help your rank INSIDE the game.
---
On paper, how is this a bannable offense?  You aren't doing anything wrong IN GAME at all.  Technically you are just playing right?  You aren't using a program, you are just playing your own game, the cheater is whats actually doing the bad thing. 
---
&gt; You can feel whatever you like but your principle doesn't actually hold up to logic.
---
It most certainly does hold logic, considering every other game I play literally bans people outright for actions exactly like this.  Your logic is the one that is shit my friend.
---
First thing I noticed was the trash cans
---
Weapons are verh boring. Why is Delta force using Uzi? ICU is just an adrenaline that finka use except that you use it yourself and you can use when you are downed..
---
Cryogrenade is not really practical. Why 4 hits? It is not really suitable for the game.
---
and your first reply was a thought out?
---
Yeah and deployable shield too
---
This is awesome.
---
Upgrading to a new engine is a huge endeavor.  Depending on how different it is, they‚Äôd essentially have to rewrite (as in the code) the whole game.
---
Also you can add for leaving an Stack Token : 
---
If somebody leaves for one Round the "round" token increases if it's reaches 2 you will get an leave penalty if you don't reconnect by the end
---
Welp this is now my lock screen.
---
Here is my upvote for compensation.
---
I'd be okay with it as long as it was a suppressed variant like the shotgun she has or Echo's MP5
---
ok thanks
---
Echo: *laughs nervously
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs not just Siege servers or internet related? I know booters are a problem but, out of my 200+ ranked games last season at Plat 2, I only ran into one game were there was apparently a booter.
---
He lagged the game so that it wouldn‚Äôt start, kicked his own teammate, the game started, and got rolled for last round :/
---
Applause
---
The psn servers are down
---
same bro, with R6 credits as well
---
Cheats are not glitches. Glitches is an in game effect that you can trigger by using your knowledge of the game. Cheats are in game effects that you trigger with an external process.
---
What is in the game is entirely in the hands of the developers. What you inject into the game is entirely in the hands of the player. So to the responsibility lies.
---
It‚Äôs not that stupid. Just wanted to know what the three speeds are. Sorry, I‚Äôm new, I played some three speeds and decided I liked them. So I just want to know more of them. Sorry.
---
Thanks kind person!
---
Dang it I was just enjoying using her for the first time in multiplayer. Freaking exploiters.
---
Nationality does not matter here. Russia Day is about equality of all nationalities under one flag, not just "day of Russians, other nationalities can fuck off despite having russian citizenship" therefore it's completely logical Finka should be counted too. Just an oversight ftom devs.
---
It works exactly like that. Except much quieter and slower.
---
Where‚Äôs mute
---
&gt; Why don‚Äôt they just upgrade it or use a new engine especially with new consoles on the horizon? I know it‚Äôs not that easy but i mean they‚Äôve had years to do it, they‚Äôve been complaining about ‚ÄúEngine Limitations‚Äù but they don‚Äôt seem to be doing anything about it.
---
From what I understand is some developers don't make new engines that often and instead use modified versions of old engines because new engines can sometimes cost quite a bit. It's a huge undertaking that takes a year or two and hundreds of developers(since it's a large company like Ubisoft making it).
---
Sorry, i misunderstood you. On twitter they say they are investigating so no eta.
---
Ok thanks a lot
---
I was thinking it‚Äôs cool until you t bagged
---
Oh I know I was just making a point. But yeah. Games will always have some sort of problem. Be a responsible player and play correctly or don‚Äôt play at all. Devs work hard
---
Ask yourself first. Pete?
---
Just get DBL Online banned already, he is the main reason why this glitches spread around so much
---
No its not, Its people ddosing servers using booters, thats the problem, if you are in High Elo games you are gonna get you lobby booted 1 every 2/3 games
---
That would be the hilarious way of doing it, but sadly it's not the politically correct by the books approach that Ubisoft prefers.
---
hey man, better you than me!
---
haha
---
They could update their engine, they're still using anvilnext 2.0 which they also use for assassin's creed.
---
This was about 3-4 hours ago. Reddit wouldn‚Äôt let me post for a while and my friend was still in the game
---
No problem :)
---
Ah shields again just got back to equiping them
---
And? you literally added nothing to this thread.
---
That‚Äôs why the ‚ÄúA POS‚Äù on his chest stands for ‚ÄúA Piece of Shit.‚Äù
---
She's a monster on Outback
---
Wecre in the endgame
---
So you give them away, to someone, for money.
---
They could update the engine, they're still using anvilnext 2.0 which is what they used for assassin's creed.
---
The failsafes were working though
---
Bro I'm a clash main and I can't even play her this is hawt I hate people who exploit üôÇ
---
The tea bags lmfao
---
This is cool and creative, i hope to see a vigil one :)
---
Well you did get to play her a week early.
---
Coooofe
---
no
---
No
---
I don't think you understand they won't change her loadout as they've never changed a DLC's operator's loadout, Once an operator gets a specific loadout it's there permanent and won't be changed, it's too late to change it I mean they might buff her FMG-9 in the future but she won't be a priority so I doubt they'll buff it.
---
Ubi - *rolls up newspaper* Shoo shoo, you just now got your new ranked system, now shoo or we will delete Blackbeard.
---
Bye!
---
&gt;  it should be possible to separate gadget ammunition counts between operators
---
should be right, at the very least they could make it possible to pick barb as an option just give her 0 to start the round
---
Again, how are any of these issues not just outright proven to be non issues given CSGOs history using them?  The choosing the players to participate in this has been solved by CSGO.  Ranks are obviously a HUGE factor in doing this.  Also, every case isn't just reviewed by one player, so if someone is bad at solving cases, then they are removed.  Just like CSGO.  This makes it so they take every case seriously and try to actually solve it.
---
What are the issues with it being crossplatform as well?  Literally take one system you make for one platform, and replicate it on the others.
---
Seriously every 'issue' you are pointing out has been proven to be a non issue so idk what you are trying to get at here.
---
Than why can people still do the glich?
---
Clash has been banned twice in the space of a month üòÇ
---
He doesn't actually find any himself though. I believe most of the times he credits who actually found those.
---
There is a large difference between getting stuck in a wall, and repeatedly glitching into a great peeking spot every round to snipe the enemy team as they enter.
---
Note that they removed claymore for nokk. Even tho IQ is the one that triggers the glitch
---
bot and luck
---
Give IQ frags again
---
This is all "DBLOnline" fault on YouTube, truly the scum of the community
---
Maybe a slight one like reduce how many times you get pinged
---
Very nice , you never forget your first one
---
Evil eye v2
---
If you look at the team members you can see how everyone is using rook
---
Lesion and Echo are probably the best.
---
Play something else for a while? [R6S page shows some issues on PS4](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/status/).
---
There‚Äôs another exploit you dense fuck
---
The mustache doesn't lie
---
Silver/gold is incredibly aids to get out of. I can get my main to diamond with some effort, but soloQ'ing my smurf out of silver can take days some times.
---
You can genuinely go 15 kills a match and still have a 50% win rate.
---
Thank you for clarifying about claymores. I saw the posts related to bugs being back and stayed away from the game since. I'll be hopping online tonight for some matches.
---
Heartbreaking is the correct term(just saying lol)
---
Are you asking if anyone here has been shot through a wall?
---
I believe there's a micro drone hole
---
They should give her a camera and I think this should be even permanently, it would fit her better.
---
Fucking 1854890033752179865 IQ play right there!

"Hey bro, you got enough credits to buy the bandit elite since you main him?"
---
*no*
---
I keep seeing references to this video. I‚Äôd like to see it.
---
An unbrekable wall not a normal wall
---
Thx bro
---
My favorite is blitz √ó4
---
Man not cool i just got clash today
---
Mode?
---
On the contrary, Im not sure how long claymores will be back. Seeing how the other 2 failsafes did a spectacular job at preventing the glitches /s, im not sure if/ how long the claymore glitch failsafe will hold up. Enjoy it while you can!
---
Damn you'd probably fail a drug test with your toxic ass.
---
ah! Ok, yea, that should not be possible unless there is some weird glitch. Has not happen to me in recent memory.
---
As a Valk main this gun is just really bad IMO. You‚Äôll literally never win a gunfight head-on because it‚Äôs just so damn weak. Even if you do catch someone by surprise if you don‚Äôt get a headshot sometimes they can just gun you down after tanking the first couple of shots. Some may say ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù but the gun is just really underwhelming.
---
Back when Robocraft was a think, it was standard to have one of your friends leave a losing match in order for everyone to lose less elo. In my 5 man we had one person bite the bullet each time, rotating so everyone got a chance.
---
My favorite attacker is pulse too
---
They didn't make it easier, they took out the terrorist hunt and situation trophies. They changed the operator win trophy to be exclusively in ranked now for example, which makes things far more difficult than they previously were.
---
What were the old challenges you couldn‚Äôt get?
---
Just remove all Shield Ops, there problem solved, forever.
---
u/sxub read these commentsüòÇ
---
Yeah I know still sucks bro üòî should have got Maverick
---
Something something wololo
---
She‚Äôs hella aids to go against
---
Its not one video and its on a website that has to do with thisüëâüèºüëåüèº
---
Dodgy internet?
---
It‚Äôs obviously on October 31st. She is a spooky girl
---
Win 200 defense game modes in Terro hunt, and get 2k bullet penetration kills in Terro hunt. Not difficult, just incredibly boring and tedious
---
I really can‚Äôt see how she‚Äôs overpowered, what rank are you playing at?
---
Operators
---
I don‚Äôt Finka she care
---
I'm sorry, I've never experienced any struggle to reach a rank that I felt was appropriate for me so I can't really relate. But how can it be hard to get out of bronze or copper? All you need to do is slightly tip the game in your team's favour. 
---
As for basing it off off kills or any performance based score. That would literally destroy the game. People would get (even more) kill hungry. There are also huge flaws in not rewarding players who did contribute, maybe even a lot more than someone top fragging. If we cannot capture all actions that contribute to a team's success we shouldn't capture any. That way your performance is still measured simply by playing a lot of matches and how your performance is the only constant in all your matches. 
---
Classic examples of actions not rewarded in any score based system:
---
- shallow roaming, stalling the attackers for 2:45 and not allowing them to push site merely by being alive. You die and the attackers need to rush in. Your team get easy kills and you didn't get any. Should you get less Elo for a win or lose more when you lose?
---
- droning someone else in: you don't mark because that notifies the defender. Based on your calls another attacker gets 3 kills. You move in, hold his flank whilst the other attacker plants. You hold the flank but they push your mate and ONLY because he knows his flank is safe he can hold a tight angle and kill the remaining 2. 
---
If you introduce any form of performance capture in the amount of MMR people gain or lose people will drone less, will hold flanks less, roamers will die more to get actual kills. 
---
In the current system it's simple, do your best, play to help the team win and you will rank up if you are able to be a net positive to your team. 
---
I've seen plenty of people get 9+ kills and contributing very little to a team. As an attack they don't push and maybe get 1-2 kills on impatient defenders as the clock winds down. But even worse as a defender they deep roam, simply hide on the other side of the map without exerting any pressure on the attackers. Defenders on site get pushed and the attackers plant. Now this deep roamer suddenly needs to retake. Attackers have a layered defense. The defender gets 2-3 kills, maybe even 4 or 5 but then the defuser timer runs out. A loss. Plenty of kills but did the deep roamer really contribute ANYTHING to the team that round? This happens plenty of times.
---
Trust me I know how it can feel sometimes. I've lost a 23 kill game once. Just have to focus on your own play, see where you maybe could have helped the team out more.
---
no not true any mode where attackers have to come to you favours defenders, i get what your saying but is not the reason why it should be removed. the mode needs to come back.
---
i know what lets make it more competitive, pro league style yet leave shitty maps that are not in pro league and have 3 rounds attack and defence, they have messed up, starting attacking on Hereford 3 rounds sucks, 1-1 round map rotation was fine. secure was fine.
---
If you remember ‚Äúblack Jesus‚Äù and ‚Äúraptor legs‚Äù you qualify for a veterans discount...
---
Only pc
---
Yes, the glitch was very complicated. It‚Äôs just strange everybody called it IQ Glitch an that I have never seen someone doing it with another operator, even though I had a lot of glitch battles
---
This is amazing. Where‚Äôs the other 5 parts ? I need more!
---
Mpx and semi auto pistol. Attachments up to you
---
Shut the fuck up I didn‚Äôt ask for your input (jUsT sAYiNG lOL)
---
Nawh, porn is porn whether it's mirrored or not, so no biggie for him
---
You mean to tell me ppl stand while taking a dump? Have you seen the stalls?
---
Meh i hate clash as it is, i heard a rumor of permanent removal and was kinda sad when it didnt happen
---
Dat ping and those smooth 5 F's
---
Console gameplay lmao
---
DAMMMIT! I was just getting around to using my shield/Frost trap/gu mine combos
---
Why are you people like this?!? Why do you exploit these things!??!?!
---
I never said it was impossible. I asked if you knew how to just *implement* a system like that into a game. Which you obviously don't, so I accept your apology.
---
Can we just turn her shield into a full size deployable shield. Fixes the glitch and is more interesting on the gameplay.
---
Never
---
this is really well executed, the only thing i noticed at first was the kaid head
---
THE BIG OOF
---
Good job literally ignoring my entire paragraph about how Recruit is objectively viable.  How are you disagreeing with a straight fact?  That takes some skill.
---
Those operators are all useful in their own ways, I agree.  But has it ever occurred to you that some people just have a different playstyle than you?  I know you‚Äôre a diamond, so you‚Äôre a god amongst men and all that, and I should be licking your urethra and begging for your succulent gamer juice, but maybe - just maybe - I find it better in some situations to be able to help my team with barbed wire and a nitro.  There are plenty of objectives in the game where we don‚Äôt know where to put a Mira that couldn‚Äôt possibly screw us over in the long run.  If the other team is able to drop the Mira somehow, we‚Äôre just fucked.  And sometimes there‚Äôs an objective that we‚Äôd rather be able to put barbed wire down beforehand than have to run out into the open just to throw a Smoke at the enemy.  Sometimes Smoke just won‚Äôt cut it because he can‚Äôt get any good angles unless he steps into enemy fire.
---
Is a diamond really not able to comprehend this?  Of all people, how do you not understand the importance of barbed wire and nitro cells?  How do you not grasp that Smoke canisters do les damage than a nitro and are sometimes harder to use?  Maybe I want Smoke‚Äôs ability but our team needs someone with better guns more, and Smoke‚Äôs loadout just won‚Äôt cut it.  Maybe the other team has already shown us they‚Äôre capable of verticale gameplay, so rather than having a Smoke with barbed wire and gas canisters, we‚Äôd use a Recruit with better guns, the same amount of barbed wire, and a much more lethal nitro cell.  Depending on the objective, I‚Äôd be willing to make the trade off for a single reinforcement.
---
Are you just ignoring facts at this point because you‚Äôve been proven objectively wrong by a shitty gold, or is your brain only programmed to play rock-paper-scissors with operators in a game that you can ultimately lose if the other team is running full recruits but they all have better aim?
---
It be like that
---
That wasn‚Äôt intentional at all. 100% luck. But still sick lol
---
r/cursedimages
---
Maybe Monte as well or Clash. Especially if the shields are broken still
---
Google "bandit tricking"
---
That was beautiful
---
Love these kills
---
hmm maybe but impacts are usually a defender gadget but I won't be surprised if Ubisoft gives an attacker impacts.
---
So then take away her barbed wire. Problem solved
---
Ty
---
Yes ive heard it rivals the mona lisa
---
He was 2-0 for the current season. I get that it's not perfect but that's the point. Is there SHOULD be things in place to prevent this but they either don't work all the time. Don't work sometimes. Or can be gamed by play8ing with derankers.
---
A person is is ALWAYS plat 1 or diamond for like 5 seasons in a row shouldn't ever see a gold. EVER.
---
She's the least picked and lowest win rate operator in seige I don't think there is anything overpowered about her
---
Lmao at those devs.
---
The issue is the 2 fuckin blitzs'
---
Yeah, I blew it...I‚Äôm probably more mad about that than excited over the double kill.
---
N√∏kk is actually pretty good. Just play her a lot like Cav and exclusively run the shotgun
---
WAIT WHAT AGAIN
---
Blackbeard is a bad operator. You guys probably get mad because he tanked one shot that you guys missed
---
I hear you, nothing wrong with that :) Just saying, you probably wouldn‚Äôt like it either if that were in the game.
---
The report button does nothing, change my mind.
---
I'm pretty sure they never even *claimed* that it did anything. Like, maybe there are posts out there where they say officially that they do review it or something, but I've never seen it and I've been around since beta.
---
I see nothing wrong here
---
Man in background gets fucking shot
---
They keep doing these hidden recoil changes either on purpose or by accident, but its really a pain in the ass that on the new season you need to retrain your recoil.
---
Totally agree. My kd is still really low from when I was first playing ranked
---
It may be your network. I have the regular Comcast one using the 5ghz network. Me my wife and a friend can all play together.
---
I'd kill for an old school mode. Year one rules and is only
---
Bruh your comment bugged out and posted the same thing like 5 times
---
This is why we can't have nice things...
---
At least they remove OP or busted operators in siege, in for honor they buff them instead and nerf everyone else.
---
OMEGALUL
---
Except not really since clash was removed
---
That's. Frustrating. That was a lot of work.
---
As if anyone is scared of those new ops. Weak as hell.
---
Japanese Twitter
---
People hate ranked cuz off the soft mmr so have fun with people who gave up on plat or diamond aspirations
---
We better get a sweet ass six shooter skin.
---
That double wammy was amazing nice work
---
K/D is a pointless stat in siege so what does it matter
---
Really? It's been like 3 days into current season and some idiots are already talking about next season "leaks". It's not the time for that yet, and your leaks will be nowhere near accurate when the season actually comes.
---
The four Blitzkriegs of the apocalypse
---
You can't change facts. (I think it only works if they get several reports within a short amount of time)
---
Maybe he just really feels strongly about this opinion and wants to broadcast it to the rest of reddit like a craigslist ad.
---
Consider spell checking before posting. And no, pretty sure the highlight thing is a plugin interaction between shadowplay and the game
---
I know i‚Äôd kill myself too knowing my luck, i would somehow miss the floor and just watch the grenade continue to roll for the final second. BOOM.
---
Also looks like that bot isn‚Äôt really suicide aware.
---
You do realise that if one person is bad and your team loses then the whole team is bad. It's not like you can have 4 pros and 1 copper 4 and the copper is going to make you lose unless being intentional, there's also mute buttons so you cant say he was talking so much. If homeless was doing bad and not getting kills then the team loses then the team is also is bad and deserves a rank loss.
---
Nah he prolly has an extended stick. My movement is the same way
---
What about the ridiculous amount of server cheaters on PS4? Multiple times a day my Plat/Diamond squad come across teams that just lag the server so you can't plant the bomb on attack.
---
u/ubi-ludo
---
Imagine hatch on penthouse on Coastline, it is usually open by defenders for rotation, this attacker will make them think twice, if defender open this hatch, they need a person to watch hatch or below which roamer should be watching as it is the same way as main gate, or the defender can just reinforce the hatch but they will lose 1 reinforce + rotation hole. Pretty strong IMO, even in solo ranked, people might be forget about hatch at the center of sites, it depends on how loud that gadget will be.
---
Bruh BB is in my top 5 used operators. I dont mind playing him or going against him currently. 
---
That being said i only play lower plat ranks, i understand that diamond/CL/proL people have insane aim and that extra 2 shots will determine who wins a gun fight.
---
I've heard that Ubi has thought about it and I also wanna play with a friend who's on Xbox
---
Nah he probably is using an extended stick. My movement looks the same way
---
For real though, defending with fuze would be so fun don't lie
---
No problem with my mozzie
---
Even plat nobody uses him...
---
The new one is shit, i miss the old one a lot.
---
It was my favourite map bruh
---
Because some people care about the stats other players see  like rank and K/D
---
Clash has been removed again
---
Because at low skill levels he's really good
---
Damn no Clash till next season I guess
---
If I get on right now and claymores are gone I‚Äôm going to cry.
---
So you abuse a glitch and you shouldn't be punished because it's not your fault it's in the game in the first place? fuck me, Darwinism at it's finest here boys.
---
you can't just "upgrade or use a new engine". that would be an absolute mountain of work that would take hundreds of people and a few years to finish. tools would have to be made to work on the new engine, which means training staff again, then they'd pretty much have to rebuild siege from the ground up.
---
I had a 3 v 5 today to lose my gold and the other team ran Lion finka Monty
---
Weird. I‚Äôll keep looking into it
---
Big explaino please
---
The more you look at it, the better it gets\*
---
some ppl would judge u though ur kid
---
I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd do that less if there was an operator meant to take advantage of open hatches though
---
some ppl would judge u though ur kd
---
Git gud
---
A trick that you knock the hostage so you can revive him and it cannot he downed again because it‚Äôll just die, if the attackers accidentally shoot at it then it costs them a round. It‚Äôs trashy tbh
---
RIP to all 2 Clash mains out there üò¢üò¢
---
Old Hereford is in situations bro
---
Dude was about to revive hostage when hostage was downed by enemy team and I shot him stopping the revive while the reverse friendly fire killed me
---
No. I genuinely play controller
---
No, it's a regular xbox controller
---
Funny beacause Jackal is one of the older ops
---
I guess they need a RErework for clash lol
---
Alright so here's my thought, I think the devs have been accidentally leaking their future OPs abilities throughout the new gadget reworks.
---
\*They Reworked Glaz's ability (I know it's broken and could be a reason to rework it as well) so that Warden can almost use the same filter, the stand still to see through smoke filter.
---
  
---
\*They Reworked Capit√£o's fire bolt so that it could be used (possibly, according to the leak above \^) for the new Defender.
---
\*They Reworked the Deployable shield so that it could be used (possibly, according to the leak above \^) for the new Defender.
---
Sooooooo what's next yo, did they recently rework an OP or a gadget ? Like I remember them talking about Smoke rework or something.. correct me if I'm wrong
