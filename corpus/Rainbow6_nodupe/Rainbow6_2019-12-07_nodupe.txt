Sniping's a good job mate.

 This reminds me of the meme where there is a white girl and black men.

Not bad\~

Could you do better? Hmmmm

If you're on mobile, go to the r/Rainbow6 main page, press the three dots at the top right, change user flair
---

---
If you're on desktop, go to the the r/Rainbow6 main page, change user flair should be around the menu bar where you see community info, wiki, etc. So around the middle of the page once you load in? I think
---
Maybe try either:
---
Resetting your binds to default (I know you haven‚Äôt changed them)
---
Binding shoot to something else and trying
---
Trying a different mouse
---
That‚Äôs my best advice, keep in mind I‚Äôm not a pc player.
---
Wowowowowowowowo that was wicked
---
Thank you and I really don‚Äôt but .8 is terrible I‚Äôm happy with even a high .9 it‚Äôs just my personal knowing I‚Äôm capable of fragging rather than oh look I have a 12.0 kd you know?
---
To add to what every one else is saying though... let's be real for a minute. If you can't get out of bronze, you're there for a reason. Every bullshit scenario you can dream up in your head about people holding you back, or trolls, is applicable to every single person on your team and the enemy team. 
---
The entire MMR system basically amounts to = get a 50% win rate or higher and you'll climb. Sure, there are anecdotal cases where people will fuck games up for you, but you can't control those people. Focus on winning games. Not KD. Not sIcK pLaYz. Focus on consistent, game capping, fundamentals.
---
Is your eu rank on that server or is it different?
---
what do you think of this?
---
not glaz

Pls win

The absolute Disrespect

I think it is a very cool clutch! You are really good! :D

How i feel when i have to do taxes
---
My favorite part about this game
---
Of course it‚Äôs an ash
---
I sent this to my friend before I posted it and he posted it before me. This is my OC. U/joy11joy

This was just posted from a different angle.

How ungrateful he even got an elite skin that asshole.
---
It happened for at least 10 hours last night every 15 or so minutes from what I saw. It‚Äôs still occasionally happening today as well. I‚Äôm estimating at least a thousand people got banned.
---
I think they do this cuz it has slashed and people try to spell out things like the n word with slashes and shit
---
Saying you made an image doesn't imply that its content are all created by you. They did make this.
---
It was my friend. I sent it to him before I posted it and he tried to steal my karma
---
Trus
---
Should‚Äôve been my girl.

Ikr
---
Every word you just said is wrong
---
Me going to the restroom at work
---
I thought that was a death laser satellite, then I realized this was, in fact, chanka turret without his hat.
---
More like the Art of War.
---
I forget which part it comes from, but there's literally a strategy by which you retreat and feign weakness to bait pursuit, but you're basically repositioning to an ambush that has no possibility of defeat.
---
Love the chill song with this
---
Yeah op report the guy so nothing will happen against him and he can carry on doing the same thing.  The guy deserves a tk/thread
---
Thanks
---
Sorry but I down voted you. I have never put someone deliberately into negative doots before. I up voted another few to make up for it.
---
itll be ok bro
---
Stop pressing r3
---
And here I brought you back to zero. Cool.
---
Wait where does it say it‚Äôs 300 win. Mag if this is true then that‚Äôs really annoying and considering how powerful this Gun is they should just change it to a 50 cal
---
This is pretty much World Of Light in a nutshell.
---
Isn't there a scheme you can change to that changes R3 to crouch instead of o? Or whatever your button for that is? There ususally is. I don't have siege on my ps4 or I'd check. At any rate, panic crouching is infnitely more useful than panic knifing in this game lol.
---
Calm down stop panicking trust yourself that you will kill the enemy and everything will be fine
---
You are a absolute idiot
---
what i mean is when you hit tab, i wish there was a button in the top left corner
---
The fact that it was done on controller as well is insane
---
create a fake email to the typo like i did
---
My bad üò¨
---
Hibana and thermite charges have been silent for me, it sucks for bandit tricking.
---
This is minute long holy shit
---
*cries in bullet peeks*
---
I think he‚Äôs prom Britain because I remember a Hot Breach podcast episode when they were talking about gun laws in countries and he brings up how it‚Äôs different for him then it is with Get_Flanked and such.
---
Nice mouse and keyboard on console
---
I'm with you on that
---
I usually wait until the 15 second mark to let people have a chance to have them if they want to play them, then I pick them if nobody is interested.
---
I just liked the dance and song it hypnotized me
---
I almost started slow clapping for your comment and I don't know why that was the reaction but damn
---
Form my experience buck is either a sucide bomber or a extra shield that  we use as a big drone
---
I am a console player and trust me this is low level gameplay. It must be in copper ranks. All the low quality videos uploaded to the subreddit by console players make us all look shit when in reality it's just the coppers uploading their 4K's and lucky aces and shit.
---
It is the sound engine its just soo bad
---
Perfect thanks I love Rogue. Didn‚Äôt know this existed

They did add a setting for it? Because I wasn't seeing one

I‚Äôm gonna go spawn peak!

Jerry were to late into the round. 
---
Yeah watch m-
---
It basically just comes down to damaged opponents. 84 vs 71 damage **could** potentially make the difference between a one shot kill/down. The only real advantage of the suppressor is that it disables hit indicators, so is that worth it for you?
---
Until they schoot you
---
I spray through walls a lot because I have decent gamesense and often get headshots. You're fine.
---
Daym bro
---
What happened to him?
---
I know it's sad a moment of silence for all the bandit's that died to this
---
You need a phone to see it tho haha
---
In some instances I think it can be helpful but on a loud ass mf like Kaid I‚Äôm not so sure. I wish suppressors were more viable in general but sadly they are mostly useless
---
Not my proudest wank

A man of dedication, sheer will

Bet you're fun at parties

This is a big brain strat

Hacks?! That's some true skill.

You think the people who posted this aren‚Äôt human?

Do you just assume everyone is a ‚Äúboomer‚Äù as you call it? Whatever that means.
---
I think they'd be dumb to drop it now. She needs some recoil changes. It's fine limiting Ela to close range gun fights. But her scorpion needs to at least have the first burst land on target before recoil kicks in.
---
My so n got into Siege and did this with his Mega Blox stuff.  Pretty good job too.
---
You‚Äôre the best
---
Nah the new one is ok but the old one is better
---
Nobody thinks it makes hitboxes bigger, it just stretches out the image and some feel it makes it easier to aim
---
His purpose was to inform others of what it gave him so that others can make an objective decision fully knowing that they will have a different result. 
---
How is that helpful.? Well I can weigh the cost benefit based on a previous example of what could happen and make an educated decision whether I want to move forward or not. 
---
It‚Äôs not pointless. Like I said. It‚Äôs helpful to know what the result MAY look like.  Your welcome to your own opinion, however don‚Äôt assume that this wouldn‚Äôt be helpful for others to know.

Fuck the Ela elite, we need a Buck elite ASAP. Plz Ubi
---
I used to have a similar problem (crashes discord, bsod etc). I googled around a bit and the fix that worked for me was deleting one of the folders with sound files and verifying game integrity to redownload them.
---
Not surprised that it's a red bull fan
---
Q
---
Well then. That‚Äôs good to know
---
Any evidence of this bug?  Because the only time I‚Äôve seen it is when people straight up hack
---
We will be right back
---
May is not strong enough to represent the small  probability to get something remotely close to what he got. Like I said with the youtubers you can watch 2 video one can get like 5 legendary and the second one like 1. Which one is right? Which one represent the real probability? 
---
It‚Äôs all luck and numbers, your odds to get something close to what he got are very slim.
---
If you found this useful and will help you decide if you get 50 packs or not that‚Äôs great but for me it doesn‚Äôt
---
new theme park is the best rework, i used to hate theme park but now i love it
---
2secs:)
---
Killer Queen has already turned this post into a bomb!
---
Yeah that is what I was thinking. Just as an example, I like looking at minecraft builds before building something in minecraft. I wont replicate what i saw, but i can use the inspiration to drastically improve my build. Thanks for the tip
---
I love Ubisoft, they're one of very few developers who would make jokes. Most others are to serious in their social media
---
Charge your phone man!!!!
---
That lesion running away has me geeking. Buddy decided he didn‚Äôt want any part of the situation anymore
---
&gt;In plat there is so much less toxicity
---
Hahaha good one. Give it a bit and you'll see
---
Cheers. Your point is a valid. And worth making. There‚Äôs always 2 sides to everything.
---
No worries, good luck to both of you!
---
STOP
---
I mean from the games I played in every game of gold there‚Äôs at least of really toxic person in the 4-6 games of plat I had it was pure fun even when I lost the people were enjoyable to play with they tried they gave calls if they could and no one and I mean no one was toxic I‚Äôm not saying this is all of plat I mean I‚Äôve heard the horror stories of plat
---
That's cause the flaw in the system is that it doesn't take into account unranked mmr. If you are unranked, the MMR gap doesn't apply.
---
That one is still messed up, yes.
---
How can you live in Africa and not realize how much of a shithole it is?
---
Mmmm lucky
---
LEGO should do colab with r6 called 
---
Rainbow‚Äùbrix‚Äùsiege
---
How in the hell?
---
Well thanks for the fun!
---
How can you live outside of africa and know exactly how it is there?
---
I have the impression im talking to a 15 year old.
---
Oh that's playstyle dependent.
---
Zo is more of an aggressive playstyle. You frag, and you support when possible. Nomad is more support than aggressive.
---
That being said, playstyles can be interchanged.
---
A generally accepted fact is that nomad is the best solo op in the game. So unless you have a aggressive frag out playstyle, pick nomad.
---
I think that 2626 is silver one now, you were gold, but because of the mmr changes, you would be silver 1.
---
Summary:
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Kali was already dead.
---
Sadly. They lost yesterday.
---
R6tab is not a Ubisoft application so it‚Äôs possible it didn‚Äôt fully update your rank.
---
Nope
---
How did 16 people get banned when only 10 people can be in a game?
---
I got like 3 elo away from from silver 4
---
Would be a glitch fro the tracker because that‚Äôs the season where they took out Gold 4, and added different ranks so it‚Äôs just their system acting up. No biggie.
---
Lol my favorite part i saw i had 3 shots i needed to hit 1 lol
---
I‚Äôd say his back does be sore
---
same thing happened to me, for me on that season it went to my ending rank
---
I have no idea what‚Äôs the clip here
---
I thought that could be it but I ended gold 1 on ember rise, not plat 3
---
makes sense.
---
It is if it was one of the first ones wich it usually is.
---
F, sorry &gt;!I took your luck and got a M870 black ice. Rip the homie!&lt;
---
probably
---
And a bucket
---
Normally when I decided to leave an angle, I end up getting unlucky and somebody speaks at the last second. I already saw Jager cross earlier, which is why I was there in the first place, so my decision to shoot was prediction + protection. That's also why you see me immediately turn my camera as soon as I tap. I was just covering my ass if anything went wrong. Lol
---
Fake
---
##Drone lives matter
---
I have a feeling it's days are numbered
---
i‚Äôm getting it too. ofc it happens at the most inconvenient times for me such as getting shot at or right before someone shoots at me
---
Damn man I feel really insecure about being level 150 now

‚ÄúHey I‚Äôve seen this one‚Äù
---
I always thought they just wanted to get rid of the drones they capture, but are too stupid to realize they destroyed both
---
Nomad? I thought it was Gridlock
---
B√∏nk
---
Courier six is still a better sniper.
---
The closest thing we will ever have to a spawn peak battle game mode will be this map
---
We salt you
---
Kalis weapon doesnt have recoil after the kick it goes back to where it was
---
can I add you so I can see it in person?
---
You have created a black hole!
---
nice,nice,nice
---
I have like 1000 or so and I‚Äôm only a level 200 lol
---
What was the name of this song?
---
Yea I don't get why so many people have a problem with it. It's the same amount as before but in a different order.
---
420 blaze it AMIRITE FELLAS?
---
Yes
---
Really? I find a lot more blitz because getting flashed then meleed is toxic
---
Are you playing stretched in Siege? Ewww wtf
---
You did it, you crazy son of a bitch, you did it!
---
For everyone conefused, this is only happening on his screen but not for the actual player. It‚Äôs a glitch where destruction of the map like barricades and wall only loads on the client side but not for the spectators.
---
There‚Äôs a one week period for season pass holders, you are not supposed to be able to buy them before the one week period.
---
Who doesn't at this point
---
New here? How long have you been playing the game?
---
New ops are available as 7 day early access for season pass owners and post 7 days for non pass owners. It's mentioned on the blog post and season pass page.
---
Don't make him Tachanka v2. That much zoom with nothing else is a waste of a spot, and we don't want another waste of a spot.
---
Glaz is fine now. Playable.
---
If your thinking of operation health two then no
---
Gridlock? I thought it was Mute
---
Ah, an another rework, why am i not surprised...
---
&gt;:(
---
He already past it
---
Love that
---
What I don't understand 
---
Mans got beaned and now rage posting on reddit
---
Looks like he's saying the 12-0 pinger was playing bandit. Regardless of the operator, playing against not one but two teammates with excessively high ping is absolutely infuriating.
---
Shit man, I've been playing since the game dropped and I thought I had a lot of time in it.
---
Right ok thanks
---
Ahhh tf2 vibes
---
Which one? DP-28, PMM or 9x19VSN?
---
Yea thats very true, i just pushed up back to gold 3 with my mate, sadly versed a team of only TWO, felt so bad for them so we had knife fights ect but ofc won, but you dont feel great after winning those, then game after we had 4v5 against u and we managed to get to 3-0 winning, then they were easily able to win defences with the extra and we got all the way till round 9, i was going 11 kills and it came down to 1v3 with my mate and he got two but missed out the third due to time, probably woulda smashed with 5, but I do try to recognise my own mistakes and not just blame it on 4v5.
---
I definitely wouldn't say it's "very rare".
---
Coulda lagged
---
Even sony and ms cant do much. The onlu thing they could do is not encourage the use of an adapter but that would lose them money and they arent going to do that for the sake of siege being better.
---
Rest easy soldier.
---
No
---
I always call it being hungry, and when they come at you it‚Äôs ‚Äúbiting‚Äù
---
I had one of those in a ranked match today and he was a total cunt after we roasted him when he returned
---
Every *Legacy and Operation Black Ice* weapon
---
Yeah no, you're completely wrong.
---
I just had a mega stroke watching this
---
I'm still recovering
---
Where‚Äôs the piss jar?
---
The only gun I have it on is the 417:(
---
Wut. New bombsite in throne room is fantastic and very easy to deffend, you literally need to hold 2 doors if you reinforce end bandit/kaid walls
---
Very worried as well.
---
Not funny
---
Didn't laugh
---
This comment is both very true and criminally underrated
---
Sherloooooock!
---
Seems that the Kairos are a bit buggy lately, between sometimes making no sound and others that you have to activate them a bunch of times so they actually activate...
---
No get a headset
---
With the actual price system it's cheaper to just buy them separate i think
---
I think so yeah cause this game constantly has new operators coming out(8 per year)
---
69 420
---
Lmao
---
Your friend was born with the devil‚Äôs own luck
---
is dead.
---
I saw it on sale I swear for 40 and didn‚Äôt get it. Hope I was wrong lol

Coastline.

those guys were awful but maestro really needs some sort of nerf

Then dont get jumped 4head

I can‚Äôt even lie. That‚Äôs actually pretty damn funny üòÑ
---
Ah yes interrogation wouldn‚Äôt even have to be a thing if people ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get jumped forehead.‚Äù Yes, if you want to get good then don‚Äôt die so simple durrrrr
---
I‚Äôm usually good and it physically hurts me to play with these types of people
---
Most spawnpeeks are from windows so he will probably prone a bit to the side behind cover before resing himself so that it basically makes a headshot the only guaranteed kill
---
Im saying drone cav out or stop being a little bitch and take the interro instead of being a cunt.
---
omg bro I somehow omitted this message notification!! I'm really really sorry
---
actually I'm studying abroad in uk now so maybe we can play together with a decent ping? my id is octopuscr3
---
by the way I'm a newbie with around 60 level and haven't play a single rank game, since I don't want to burden those 'try hard' guys xD
---
The fastest *nice* in the west
---
You‚Äôre the little fucking bitch. You‚Äôre the little bitch ass fucking loser is what you are because you‚Äôre ducking retarded. Get some jumper cables and tie them to a train track on a bridge then jump off with them tied around your neck so when a train goes by you can get electrocuted as you hang you miserable little bitch.
---
Nice
---
Thats incredibly poor bait mate.
---
That‚Äôs not really Ubisofts fault
---
MaTe m8 m9 mate mait lmao you insecure little bitch ass redditard
---
N√∏kk lookin pretty fine over there
---
I just tried it, when the turret runs completely out of all ammo, it stays up and can‚Äôt be used anymore. If the shield is on it, the shield points down, but the turret stays straight, which makes it look like someone is using it and possibly why he destroyed it at the beginning. It is definitely a bug because when you get off the turret while it has ammo, the turret also points downward.
---
Ok Boomer.
---
its actually r/notopbutok
---
Ash mains always up to no good
---
Look at the shadow brine headgear. You can sorta see his face. He's white.

That ash hat thoigh, never seen that one before.
---
To make it look like someone was around the corner
---
You seem to be getting a bit worked up there mate. Try stepping away for a bit and taking some deep breaths.
---
They were fucking around and clearly partied up. My team sucked ass.

Don't like it any way

Xp boosters or winning ranked games, or both

how is it not a 1 tap it was a headshot the points pop up after the first shot
---
I use the PlayStation platinum headset with the bass boost preset in headset companion
---
There are also methods of t-hunt farming that you can search up in YouTube just make sure it‚Äôs the latest video because the older ones don‚Äôt work anymore
---
Tachanka is always a strong choice
---
Hax
---
I feel that. If it see coming, I often report them. Get them closer to a ban :)
---
You shot more than once my friend
---
Whats this song
---
How's the player base in africa?
---
Do unranked games work as well?
---
One taps only count if you shoot once only. You shot twice. That's why you see a lot of people empty their mags to one bullet to get the one tap.
---

[**1 tap**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=1%20tap)
---
Common [**video game**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=video%20game) term involving [**one bullet**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=one%20bullet) taken [**to the head**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=to%20the%20head).

And have a plan to kill everybody you meet.
---
Echo
---
Yup shot more than once
---
Facts
---
You could Just activate it when youre flashed and deactivates it immediatly
---
If you‚Äôre more of a fragger jackal (although he does get banned a bit)
---
If you‚Äôre more of a support hibana
---
It sure is good.

That hurt my soul to watch...
---
It actually sounds a lot more Japanese
---
If u played The Lord Tachanka, play with his shotgun, ALWAYS !!!
---
Yes this should be a thing also they should make it when u turn off the glasses you don‚Äôt lose all your charge
---
Yes! I agree!
---
It actually sounds Japanese now
---
Right, i can see the buttons on your screen
---
Remove it. It was just made for the "woaw effect" at release. Like her pistol.
---
Still it limits the amount of times you can use his ability. This happened to me. I got flashed by a Ying. I used my ability and killed her. Then a blitz came later and I had my gauge filled up to 3/4th of the total. I got flashed and I died.
---
Jackal, his guns are better, his ability is better ( in my opinion).
---
I dont play on xbox anymore so I doubt I‚Äôd be any good
---
Classic console throwers lol
---
My ego has jumped through the roof this season, Im in silver 1 with a 1.7 kd after 50 ranked games. I really have to find a squad
---
Fortnite only can detect actual mkb users, not people who use adapters
---
Honestly, just wait for next Season pass coming next year.
---
Also, Nomad is Year 3, she wouldn't be unlocked even if you got the Year 4 Season pass. Mozzie and Wamai are only ones really good. All the more reason to wait and go for next year's season pass.
---
Looks nice.. but any other operator... üòÇ
---
Story of my life
---
Finka should get it as it is her ability but using one surge to do it and removing the teammates revive doesnt make Sense aswell as this is also Part of her Kit and she gets a rework next season anyway
---
it should be like cav‚Äôs ability
---
Your complaints are valid but don‚Äôt argue against any of OPs arguments
---
It is so odd. She just has a tshirt and some khakis
---
Yea he was from EU
---
I just ran a defense with vigil and his ar and git 3 kills!
---
Would be careful with showing off that knife on the Internet . This specific type of knife
---
He was from EU he had 100-80 ping
---
Awesome! Hope to see you there!
---
you think they buy regularly? They hack some poor dude account  or buy it on the black market for pennies.
---
Good luck
---
Nice job. :)
---
Hmm yes, battleship map
---
You have nice aim.
---
a rare compliment when the clip doesn‚Äôt involve much aim, but I already know it, just by the way you did a sexy ass 180 without much wasted movement.
---
are you a fellow CS player like me or just a chad rainbow player
---
Find a squad
---
Is this because these ops are banned a lot? Otherwise I‚Äôm dumb and don‚Äôt get it 
---
and if that‚Äôs the case, why does lion get banned? Anytime I play him I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever suffered from his silly little scan that lasts a second
---
Srry about deletes community rules

Hibana

Once you get like 1000 hours you can easily tell who is cheating and who isnt
---
Mira &gt; monty

Is not out yet
---
Smh ikr
---
Right now its wamai for me
---
I know a guy who has been toxic for over 2 years now, yet to be banned. Seems like the ban system is inconsistant.
---
I would've gotten kicked for that
---
Who the fuck he think he is now to dictate what to do with the game ?
---
I went up against a cav that was sniping people
---
Thats a penis.....
---
Lesion or Echo for defence
---
That means you‚Äôre in the game and still waiting on other people to join, the game has had that since blood orchid
---
Multiple operators at once, 5 tachanka or 5 monty.
---
bro, can you tell me your settings?   
---
display and graphics
---
I think you did a good job. What‚Äôs it made of/ how did you construct it?
---
I thought it was a bug or something, cause it took like 6 minutes to load in, didn't normally take this long, thx anyways I was a bit worried.
---
opponents need brain
---
Unlike other events, that have a theme, this one is just regular R6:S mixed up. Take the showdown event for example. Everyone playing has a unmodified BOSG 12.2 for a primary weapon, and a LPF revolver for a secondary. The theme is the wild west. But this? This isn't very good, by theme. And no ACOG for the attackers? The attacker's assault rifles are made for long ranges so they can hold angles from long ranges.

If he's just selling accounts why would he care about gun skins
---
Not to Yuri but the whole squad, to make sure no one associates the Russians with this terrorist attack. And the agent you're playing as is Joseph Allen. (SPOILER) You also get shot by makarov at the end of the mission so when the police identify you, a US citizen it'll be known that it's an attack of some group from the US and not the Russians.
---

---
Jackal can't track echo?
---
I don't know any angles to outside, but I do know something else you could do; Run outs. One match I saw a Jager and a Alibi run out to the south eastern spawn point. It wasn't that much successful when I played Lion, but there we're some casualties from playing IQ.
---
*happy 1 tap noises*
---
And you weren't the first person to do it either.
---
He wasn't doing that before but now. He bought the ultimate edition with season pass on sale and is now helping Smurfs and noobs to get plat accounts
---
I do this every match in VillaüòÇ
---
Hans! Get the flammenwerv.....
---
They make Warden wait for a full charge so he can't be totally immune to flashing, because as soon as you activate his glasses they instantly cure blindness caused by a flash. Being able to activate his glasses with a partial charge would allow you to just spam turning them on and off, and because of that I think it's reasonable that he needs to wait for a full charge. However I think it's lame that even if you manually disable his glasses that the recharge always starts from 0 as if they were fully depleted. I feel like if you manually disable his glasses that the recharge should start where you left it.
---
It was at this moment he knew, the AUG‚Äôs ironsight looks like a pistol‚Äôs ironsight.
---
Imagine if that disc caught a grenade
---
The sooner you stop blaming teammates the faster you will improve. teammates have some impact but if you dont topfrag every game and carry them then you cant really blame teammates for losing. if teammates were such a big problem people wouldnt consistently hit diamond every season. I do and I only soloQ. Sure you run into the odd troller or player that is worse than a bot, but in the end if you are better than the enemy you WILL win. If you arent better than you dont deserve to win anyway so yeh.
---
Cuuute

It looks kinda nice ngl
---
yes

The spetnaz are good they dont need it lol

Chris Hanson: Why don‚Äôt you take a seat, Nomad

Please take a seat and we'll call you through when we're ready
---
Code i have posted another photo with a different title that's all (Ezio zoomed in (Villa).
---
how come dokkaebi can‚Äôt call him
---
That's like when I try to plant the bomb but reload instead.
---
its off center?
---
Ohh
---
If it‚Äôs something for the game then yes but just buy them strait for the I game menu
---
It's on Kanal
---
Oo wow always knew the lore reason but never the gameplay reason. TIL!
---
It really is, goyo shields are whack. They shouldn't be going off when reinforcing a wall.
---
Wow I thought I was the only one that knew that spot :(
---
He impacted it
---
You must recover the defuser
---
This video made me realise how amazing the movement and ragdoll is in the game. You don't just die and fall right there, your intertia defines the way you fall and there are different animations. They must have spent a lot of time perfecting that. And I'm sure you've spent some time on doing this awesome video as well!

IQ is my highest picked operator with just under 100 hours
---
Agreed. Besides the book in the back ground. It‚Äôs crooked.
---
My guy you are leaning the wrong way
---
Idunno what i find more amusing
---
Hostages in Russia are much harder to kill. A few nades wouldnt scratch the hostage.
---
didn't see it before. you made the game unplayable for me
---
In a glove
---
As much as it is buggy, toxic, and sometimes a dogshit game, we can all agree it's one of the best.
---
When I checked the ubi store they‚Äôre sold out
---
I haven‚Äôt heard the name ‚Äúecho‚Äù since the pick and ban feature came out
---
House is a shit map.
---
I think it would be youl responsible, because you downed him after touching him and the damage came from you, yourself, triggering the trap.
---
About 3 months from release so early feb
---
How do you even play the game.
---
Congrats!
---
In case you are all thinking about how Wamai kills the hostage.
---
His gadget explodes when it activates. 
---
The gadget explodes before the caught throwable explodes. The damage is not much but a downed hostage is very vulnerable to damage.
---
This is that ranked vs hobby lobby casuals
---
If I have to I‚Äôm gonna get it from there because it‚Äôs sold out on the actual store page
---
I was going to purchase this elite, but now that they changed her shotgun recoil I'm not gonna get it. Ela has just been needed and nerfed and nerfed to the point where now she isn't a very good pick.
---
Or because he is the only defender without a phone
---
I think the release for Y5S1 would be either 10th or 11th of March 2020
---
Press the 3 slide tab next to ‚ÄúPlay ____‚Äù on the home menu, go down to ranked and press whatever button it tells you for Guide and it‚Äôll bring up these stats.

What did he say?

Well my phone died but we‚Äôre good now

It did because he killed me when i was outside

Idk I don‚Äôt get it. If someone leaves before the third round, at THE LEAST it should be half the elo taken. Losing 90 elo for a 3v5 is insane.

I mostly solo q but got so tired of losing because leavers that I started using Looking For Group and it‚Äôs the same thing.

Hello dahenhiwa! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**

Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!

---
Yeah but if you go to the communities or whatever you end up getting the toxic teammates that think they know everything. It‚Äôs a lose-lose.
---
Its casual bruh
---
Guys thank you so much for all of the upvotes!
---
Are you on pc or console?
---
i had connection issues late last season, but yeah shifting tides my connection is horrible, only for this game
---
She honestly is fun to use for messing around with in Casual or now "Quickmatch" and just to meme but for Ranked I would not recommend using her since she has a very low Win Delta.
---
Yeah are you
---
We must sieze the means of playing in a team and evenly distribute MMR for every single player.
---
Performance means nothing at all in this game, placements or not. Which is the dumbest. The only way to affect your rank at all is a win or a loss. Doesn‚Äôt matter how you got it.
---
I‚Äôm not saying K/D should be the end all factor but it SHOULD factor into your rank somehow. &amp; it doesn‚Äôt, at all. Your ability to win isn‚Äôt a skill in this game as much as Ubisoft thinks. When you factor in leavers, solo q, five stacks, people who get completely carried, toxic teammates, etc, it‚Äôs just a poor ranked system.
---
Vote to Kick initiated: Floxxx123
---
a 1.3 K/D means your avg round is basically 1 kill and 1 death. Over a full 9 round match you would wind up 11-9. In a 5 round match you would be 6-5. If you arent doing anything else to help the team (flexing to different operators as needed, making calls, etc etc) 1.3 aint nearly enough to be throwing your teammates under the bus.
---
unless you have a K/D of like 2.5 or higher, its likely not your teammates.
---
I'm sure you know this but you would've gotten at least into the room if you'd pulled your pistol out when you were running at the end there. So close
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying there‚Äôs no win. Even when you put a group together with a post, someone will leave, or someone will be complete cool then start acting weird as soon as the match is locked in and they know you can‚Äôt kick them.
---
Go get them is one of her lines.
---
Glad i wasn't the only one that noticed that
---
Pc
---
Okay
---
What‚Äôs an exe post
---
That's a dumb suggestion
---
It's not even really a theme park anymore. Just random themed rooms all smushed together.

Bosgacog wasn't a garbage idea

To Dokaebi: wheres Echo?

To Jackal.   : wheres Caveira?
---
To Lion.      : wheres Vigil?
---
r/notopbutok
---
Always
---
Im not buying Wamai just because Ubi patched his dance
---
Yeah. Its probably bugged. Nobody can reconnect i'd reckon. Also on pc btw
---
I always restart my game right after I disconnect and when I boot it up again I can rejoin
---
They should honestly screen the community at regular intervals and issue bans to people with an excessive abandon rate. The stats are tracked.
---
For me as well everything else works just fine like cod, bf, gta, etc.

---
Because it takes the previous season into account too. Rigged... Jesus christ, come on.
---
That‚Äôs really weird - what was your record out of the 10 games?

Its based with the rank you ended last season.

Would you look at that buddy

Ndyl sndikd?
---
Yeaaaah, that's why
---
That's what I say to them. Most of them are hard stuck plat3's that got more lucky than anything getting our of gold.
---
fair
---
Lmao fishing for comments üòÇüòâ
---
for attack, a thatcher / twitch and thermite are basically always needed. on defense, Bandit / Kaid / Mute as well as jager or wamai are usually required.
---
It depends on also how good you do and how many kills
---
See you there ;)
---
Wdym? We won like 5 out of the 10 games?
---
Chanka rework coming in!
---
nice
---
Okay thank you for clearifying
---
Then I would suggest kali, she is amazing on pc but not that great on console, I would only have suggested goyo if you were on console
---
The rank you ended at has an impact
---
Damn 4 years, I love this game
---
You‚Äôre the luckiest man alive
---
Yes i know i just want to make sure
---
There are interviews with the map creators and they said they do something like this for almost all the maps they rework
---
What are we explaining?
---
Client side debris is generally fine, they just need to tweak some things like when breaking a piece of a barricade for example.
---
I see we are not a dying breed
---
Kali is very situational 
---
And Goyo's gadget is pretty useful on the "late game"
---
So I would recommend Goyo
---
Hopefully there‚Äôs not a terrorist hunt or bomb defusal mission going on when I‚Äôm there!

Kali is something you‚Äôd get as your last op. Its extremely niche. Goyo is much more useful, even if you die
---
Look at the colour of the flag!
---
I would play fuze so much more if this became a thing.
---
Look at the colours of the flag on each sticker!
---
You're free to have your own opinion. Personally I think that "no acogs on 3 speed defenders" shouldn't have been taken so lightly by the devs. They broke a core design principle over a meme. To buff a weapon that is now still worse than the k1a.
---
Your kill started the ban wave
---
I see people all the time with hundreds of abandons a season they derank low boost people or pad their stats it‚Äôs pathetic
---
There was a 10% discount in year 2 for a little bit but that‚Äôs all
---
Cause I know how to play her.
---
ALRIGHT I DID IT! it was fraps... god I stupid
---
Free elo right?

Should've shown the death stranding baby for a more shocking reaction from the viewer.

Ok guys it was fraps, thanks a lot for your help!

Someone with sense has arrived thank you

one guy is the reason you lost 7 games ok my dude you can keep blaming it on others but that way you wont improve

exactly

Play vertically. Go above/below obj and try to catch them off guard, take out traps, etc

Should‚Äôve hit Valk with the hammerüò¢

this is now officially in the lore

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm sayin‚Äô man
---
Honestly tho. You right.
---
Well fuck off then
---
Hiding in a room waiting for that clutch. Might as well leave and come back and the end of the match.
---
I‚Äôm mostly being a butt though.
---
What you find comfortble
---
it's only a matter of time before they add an operator that uses a switch
---
Change the fire rate on the gun to burst fire.
---
Instantly becomes more manageable.
---
Consulate? Didn't they just move a wall and add a bad site?
---
U
---
What in this post said that I would do that?
---
Etika confirmed Y5S1? 
---
#JOYCON BOYZ FOREVER 2020?!?!
---
Maybe? Idk tho I'm plat 3 so maybe I got worse opponents bcz they're unranked?
---
Both the daily challenges and weekly challenges could use some update at this point.
---
The daily challenges one still ask people to use vanilla operators, it's so repetitive. 
---
And they are still asking people to do this win 8 games with Spetsnaz/GIGN/FBI/GSG9/SAS every single week, which I refuse to do them because those will take away all your time to enjoy your hard earned DLC operators.

I only get shotguns, but I don‚Äôt use any shotguns
---
And the far right with the server icon
---
Ow my eyes
---
When everyone died in the same hallway. What shall we rename that?
---
The one thing that I like is actually recoil because it sometimes helps me get the headshots
---
All of them should have massive ping. Some are at 9, some at 15. Max I saw was 100 or 200
---
Well before the round i knew there were 3 on the other side of the bridge and at least one on site. I just gambled and played the odds that no one was watching that window and just went for it.
---
Appreciate your efforts bro. Enjoy your Reddit Premium. Much love.
---
On long range I either use bursts or single fire tho. And yea with that damage most of my kills are from headshots
---
Yooo
---
The took my pro bucket spots on all maps &gt;:(
---
There is nothing saying it wasnt that way (that i know of) exept for a voiceline ying has that says "i knew this guy once, i broke his drone" and something about her tone of voice indicates to me that she broke it out of retaliation

---
My friend is a fuze main and we ruin peoples days if they choose a site with a soft ceiling
---
Crouch on c, change rappel STANCE on c, EXIT rappel on space, that's what I said
---
That means your teammates didn't load into the match and got abandon sanctioned. If it was a legit 1v5, you only lose 1 or 2 elo.
---
The server is messed up right now. I would stay away from Ranked.
---
Okay, I just got your problem, you can't change the exit rappel button, and for you it's on crouch because you have crouch on space
---
I dig it.
---
Honestly, why we don't have this already? Big QoL there.
---
there isn't an individual option to set exit rappel. That's my point.

Okay, yes, that's really uncool

Yeah I'm usually playing on plat elo and (Idk maybe I'm that unlucky)  I get always the players that even though they are in plat they forget that they have a drone or they don't know how to aimmm
---
yup we have data limits but don't u dare forget the stego anus
---
exactly, it's incredibly counter intuitive if you've changed your settings from default
---
Thanks OP, Enough is enough and I'm drawing the line here. I am sorry, but I am uninstalling the game and not playing anymore, this is the final straw Ubi, you've done this to yourself.
---
 When I saw it zoom in like that I thought it would go to the Skyrim thing ‚ÄúHey you, You‚Äôre finally awake.‚Äù
---
how do you do the wamai dance?
---
It‚Äôs kinda what they are doing with quarantine, honestly they should do this as an other game so they can invest more into it.
---
Thanks dude, that‚Äôs really good especially since there are less rounds in casual
---
Did you read the title?
---
that worked! It seems like a programming oversight. I appreciate the information though
---
when i play solo ranked i only get teammates who leave after the first round
---
That a weird thing but ok.
---
Adresse all the intensive leavers and there won‚Äôt be a need for this.
---
This exact thing happened to me
---
..twice
---
Definitely agree. The only problem is that some people may see it as a money grab, assuming that we would have to pay for another game
---
[Done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_6F7YC-lgw).
---
You must be new to the game lol rank reset happens every season my dude
---
That‚Äôs usually what I get I‚Äôm just really happy this happened friggin love varsity the best part was I top fragged
---
I think getting him the deluxe edition would be best, it includes all the starting operators and the all of the year one operators. You can get better editions that give you more things but half the fun of rainbow is saving up to get these new operators. You can always google the different editions and see the difference for yourself.
---
I mean at least it had a haunted house and a train going through it. Those are the two main things they removed and they were the only things that actually made it part of the theme park. Now it's just a bunch of meaningless rooms.
---
I have noticed this for months. This is where is would put my drone on this map. Happy to finally see it being acknowledged.
---
Amazing great job I appreciate it :)
---
That Blitz is if they were American bro
---
One elite on each side of the regular operators.
---
That would be very specific if so. It's funny as hell either way.
---
Hmm, I not sure what might be the issue then honestly.
---
they can give a renown or punishment for leaving to many games
---
There‚Äôs nothing ‚Äòofficial‚Äô about the phrase.  I can go submit my own ‚Äòofficial‚Äô statement that says it means to kill nothing.
---
It‚Äôs *generally* used in games that involve 5 players.  League, csgo, dota, etc.  If it‚Äôs any less than that then I wouldn‚Äôt call it an ace.
---
This is definitely the best one yet!
---
In my case, all 3 of those things will work if I‚Äôm on attack.
---
That's how I got it.
---
My friend once said 
---
"I spooted him!"
---
Yes with a double o
---
Not sure, looks pretty sweet though
---
Thats a valid argument but I just don‚Äôt see it like this. We can‚Äôt expect they to maintain the multiplayer and create a huge campaign 4 years after release.
---
Imo it‚Äôs better is they handle it like quarantine and make a completely different game with the operators and lore of siege. 
---
It‚Äôs probable those games won‚Äôt be full price as well.
---
That‚Äôs why I thought let‚Äôs see if anyone on reddit and maybe one of the community devs can help me out
---
Or maybe a 10% renown punishment if you have that preference set to off?
---
I hope they remove all metal bars from all maps.
---
I will thought for sure it was gonna be Skyrim...
---
Lol got that glitch in a terrorist hunt on Plane, couldn‚Äôt ADS at all
---
Agreed. I wish it was for a Primary weapon though.
---
Love the ideas. Thanks for the feedback. I trust that they know what they‚Äôre doing lol
---
No hate but why is this legendary?
---
The intricate design
---
they just kicked my friend out of the match in the middle of the round and he couldnt rejoin
---
Super hot and humid in the summer, negative double digits in the winter. We have such great weather here!
---
Expected Skyrim
---
Ironic that the blitz main says that
---
The under Barrel launcher has the same counters as thatcher emps so everything alright there
---
She is not balanced. her scorpion is the only gun in siege that does not have a horizontal recoil diamond making it random. That is by definition not balanced. second her shotgun was balanced and now sucks. As it can no longer be somewhat capable at mid range. Which every other shotgun that's a primary in game can do. Her pistol is the weakest pistol in game. Her secondary gadgets are both pretty much useless. She's a roamer and is given two stationary tools. Put 2 and 2 together there pal you should get that instantly. Her mines are lackluster and in terms of a gadget that's a trap barely on the line of okay. Lesion does better intel gathering. Kapkan has a better damage dealer and location notifier as it makes a lot of sound. Frost insta downs you. Ela concusses you for only 5 seconds. yeah. That's really balanced huh?
---
Then we can make informed decisions on which operators we buy
---
Casual
---
Bull sht. Everyone already  knows e girls don‚Äôt exist. G.I.R.L = Guys In Real Life
---
yeah ok, bandit is definitely better but if there‚Äôs a thatcher then you could say they‚Äôre both as effective, but when it comes to shooting or tazing with twitch then bandit is better, but his gadget skill is good for how efficient it is
---
You can get rid of it if you want but I'll use it still
---
He has to stand completely still for his gadget to work and so combined with his sniper he is bad according to people
---
Be quiet before I turn you into a girl and you don't exist
---
soft roaming means peaking on enemies which means more risk of dying which means possibly no ability to area denial at the end of a round. anchoring is the right thing to do when you and your team mates can highly profit off of your gadget at the end of a round
---
i think you accidently put a jk in there mdude
---
Go pee before you queue
---
I was three or four rounds in before I needed to
---
Alibi's shotgun?
---
I mean if you choose to solo q (like I do) you have to be aware it‚Äôs a grind to reach anything. It took me nearly 500 games last season to make it to plat 1. that‚Äôs how it is
---
Well no shit they‚Äôll say that, but it‚Äôs definitely because they don‚Äôt have to spend more time making new map textures
---
It's possible on local, non-internet custom games. That's how we used to play all ops back in my old college.
---
Alternatively, someone could have bought really cheap chinese knockoffs and thats what they got.
---
Damn, I got outplayed.
---
Lol
---
Not sure what that would look like, but I know every twinked invader is an Ash / Jager main.
---
Is this projection?
---
I thought it was gonna be a death stranding meme lmao
---
HOW DO YOU GUYS GET THE OPERATOR SYMBOL OVER UR USERNAME
---
I was expecting "hey you... You're finally awake"
---
ALTIAR
---
I've been trying to get it since Alpha Packs were introduced. So in my experience, you just fuckin' don't.
---
It seems more difficult to counter, but I haven‚Äôt played the live build yet so I guess I don‚Äôt have a place to speak
---
That is funny as crap.
---
Wdym youre facing it? So it hasnt happened yet?
---
I did pretty much the exact same thing I was bronze then gold the last two seasons now I‚Äôm platinum
---

The FMG looks realy big, but I mean I couldn't do any better lol. It looks fantastic!
---
Never!
---
Aaah damn it why do people know i actually like to get them fingers up my butthole
---
Why you gotta use the word grill for girl unironically? This is some cringe.
---
Best 10‚Ç¨ you can spend on a watch, made with nuclear battery.
---
Only times I had to buy a new one was because I lost it and no because it broke.
---
Btw how do you get that blue text next to your name?
---
That‚Äôs a rather large gun
---
Thanks for the feedback üòÅ
---
I have r4c black ice
---
HahaüòÇ
---
If you go offline you can use every operator
---
Dont quote me on that though
---
Came here expecting grills that also had some videogame attachments/a tv screen.
---
Left wondering what went wrong in your parenting.
---
Why is the fmg 9 so fucking big
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
*cries in no black ice
---
I was in a game where kali wasted her charges because wamai caught both
---
he only has to stand still for it to see through smoke now
---
Nice!
---
A well placed maestro cam is all it takes to counter it. It can be shot from it's rear end
---
I emailed ubisoft and they gifted me the charm because I have had a toy stegasaurus for years aha
---
It's not Vreddit, unsure if it'll work. You can also yoink it off youtube if you want.

At least I admitted it

Most others would not

I once saw a guy with 40k ping

I'd say my nigga has a bad alcohol addiction doe
---
Look at Ireland bruh. We as small as britbongland.
---
BRUGH
---
It is New Zealand. Notice the size of Japan, the UK and Ireland?
---
So in reality, why are we even talking about it if it wouldn't be added for these reasons?
---
Now that I look at that I could buy that actually. Why are they so small ? Lol.
---
for those dog lovers out there, what if instead of an actual dog, it was a robot dog?
---
it could look something like Boston Dynamic's Spot, or LS3
---
heck, any sort of chunk of metal with 4 legs
---
Yeah but Ubisoft maybe made New Zealand that small lol.
---
oof
---
Double no.
---
My mans listening to marvins room and crushing a 24
---
If you have a high k/d and low win/loss I'll go out on a limb and say most of your kills are garbage time kills that don't have much impact on the rounds
---
Birds have vents. That's a vent.
---
Not sure where you heard that from, but definitely not true
---
The question is why does it exist
---
Everything about that was hard to watch.
---
Idk I cant remember just wanted to make sure.
---
Complete BS
---
Its during the game not the loading screen that i noticed this issue
---
&gt; Find a way to make knifing A. More Consistent B. Balanced 
---
Bruh once you knife, you lose control of everything leaving you vulnerable, so please stop ranting after losing a knife situation alright?
---
Wow...you're not really smart, are you? Can you swear on your life that you've watched every movie and played every game that came out 3 years ago? Can you ask someone who was literally born yesterday if they did? I'm not sure you'll understand, but I'll try: just because you've seen something doesn't mean other people had. Your experiences don't mirror other people's experiences.
---
Try out the in game benchmark. It should easily tell you the amount of fps you should be able to hit on most maps.
---
Wait a minute
---
Alright tnx ill give it a try
---
Not sure how playing Zofia to kill an Ela shotgun is a good example of using her passive. She has a passive just like how operators like how Dokk can hack camera's; not just call phones, how Echo is immune from her calls, how Cav doesn't leave footprints, how Doc can revive himself, Ela is also resistant to grzmots, smoke immune to his own gas despite other ops having a gas mask.
---
You can look at videos, play the discovery playlist or custom games to learn the new maps. It's only your fault if you don't know the map.
---
What's your laptop? I got an MSI GP63 8RE, it looks a lot like yours.
---
Not gonna lie I like this idea but give him like a skoprion msg as the secondary maybe
---
Thanks, I love it.
---
Agreed
---
I disagree. I think having glaz as this middle of the road more close quarters friendly DMR type is fine. No reason to make him more like her. He has frags, good rifle with a recent fire rate upgrade that is reallllly good. He gets conditional thermal scope, which is certainly helpful if you choose to play that playstyle with him (and using smoke grenades). Or you can make less use of the gadget and take the frags for more entry fragging. I think he's in a good spot vs kali. 
---
Besides, I think the days of adding new weapons on a whim like that are long gone thanks to licensing.
---
You guys all complain about realism until it involves assholes. Now you don't want it.
---
Glaz's sniper has been buffed before and he always ends up being way too overpowered and then nerfed the next season, there is no they would add a new secondary no matter how much anyone wants it. Kali and Glaz are both quite different, Glaz is more useful for defending teamates planting the defuser while smoke is down. Glaz after the buff this update isnt great but he doesnt need to be touched, if hes used correctly he can be extremely deadly with any team comp as long as you have smokes and good communication.
---
Yo holy shit its ree kid
