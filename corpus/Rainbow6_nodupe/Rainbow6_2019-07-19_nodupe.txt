Servers are down for most people

Not Funny. Didn’t Laugh.

Whaaat? I personally adore the animation.

Haha okay that's pretty good mate :D
---
do you know when will it go back up?
---
Servers are wack for everyone right now
---
Sniping on bank was so satisfying.
---
He doesn’t need a nerf he needs a rebalance maybe decrease time in between location pings and maybe reducing the time in which footprints are effective and reduce the cool down slightly
---
Okay wait.. why is this a Legendary ???
---
damn that sucks, but it started for me around the time the update come out, does that have anything to do with it you think?

Yes, not impractical at all
---
I don't think any changes really need to be made. People just need to get better at the game. There is no reason to ban these two operators so often, other than being bad at the game.
---
The best Alibi strats I’ve seen is, she puts her 3 holograms in each corner of the room and she stands in the last corner. So funny when the enemy sees it and turns and runs.. then peeks and takes a shot at 1, peeks and shoots another lol by the 3rd peek he’s dead. 
---
And one that’s happened to me, she puts a hologram behind like a crate or something that covers her from the hip down. Enemy peeks and shoots it, then hides while being pinged. Meanwhile Alibi was crouched next to it, and just stands up and stands on it. The enemy comes in the room thinking he’s okay and boom dead.
---
Spawn peeking is not douchey or toxic, it requires simple droning.
---
Less movement penalty. Not as good as he was, but maybe weak end of viable.
---
Buuurrn
---
Try again, Siege is working for me now
---
The lord is disappointed that you don’t take screenshots
---
That's actually so nice. I love how you've done the f2
---
Thank you! :)
---
Nope
---
They released hard counter to Ying and Glaz while nerfed them both. Ah, goobisoft.
---
Seems like you’d be doing God’s work.
---
I didn’t realize she was glitched, I just assumed the Six12 was just that bad lol
---
Bad smoke
---
There is a scaling ban.
---
No but seriously how does she even see?
---
The TTS does not represent the community. It only represents five per cent of PC players that play it for one hour and then never touch it again
---
Nice
---
it should be obvious these charts are useless as soon as you see kapkan as "too strong". Stop balancing around this robotic garbage and learn how your game works.
---
Is this a recent update
---
Ash does not need more nerfs. I'd prefer it if they nerfed her recoil and gave her back the acog though. Remove her Vertical grip?

Yea I mean when lion came out he was op so every time he got picked to get banned that's why the need his ban rate was too high but recruit has a lot of loadouts so he is op also they removed him from rank probaly
---
Did you remove fog from your files to cheat?
---
Click the 3 dots, go to flair, click edit on the top. It’ll show :operator name: just type in the same thing with whoever you want. Idk the limit but I’ve seen people with up to 6. Plus you can type in whatever you want for a little text next to it
---
Ya but that extra hit means Blitz will have is back exposed longer. It will definitely slow down the Blitz players that run like crazy and get melee kills.
---
holy shit
---
Ubi does not like RNG. Siege should always be a tactical shooter
---
bullet sponges
---
Isn't he a bit lower than Chanka in term of winrate? lol indeed
---
Got em, pineapple head
---
Yes, I play on Xbox and the shotgun is 10x better then the SMG primaries.
---
Ubisoft gives you a stats email at the end of each season from which you could copy it
---
A smart defending team will immediately be on cams at the start of the round identifying who the attackers are and where they're coming from. It \*is\* important to kill those cams quickly once you enter their field of view, and you should 1000% be expecting that you're teammates are going to want to shoot those cams. If you obliviously sprint in front of someone who is ADSd in the direction of a cam, you share at least half of the blame (if not more).
---
If this happened to me in ranked I would lose it.
---
Edgy Echo bout to snipe your only hard breacher
---
Imagine how much terrain destruction they'd be by the end it's be awesome
---
Gotta love the chat from them. Trying to justify rank boosting as if they have any skill at all. Rainbow 6 will die if they don’t fix this soon.
---
Can easily one tap him or finished off by a teammate. The idea made more sense when getting picked up brought you back to 50 instead of 20.
---
Whaaat the one shooting bullets at head level should be careful?  You crazy. The 2nd guy was tempting his own fate though lol.

It was their fault for making the challenge too hard.

It may have in the beta.

Yeah I’m not super mad about it it’s just one of those small things that kinda make me hate siege

Hello sau
---
lesion is better in nearly every aspect. kapkan traps are usually pretty obvious and are easily taken out
---
Yeah ik I’ve played siege since launch an it never ceases to be annoying
---
i'm sorry comrade but it had to be said
---
Happened to me for 2 days straight, playing 1 casual game and than going ranked fixed it somehow, it was a tip from a friend with the same issue.
---
U/ubiNoty anyone ubi pls
---
If you get one shot anyway, may as well make it a shotgun
---
Doc pistol
---
Since its not on the picture. Its from Sau-Siege.

That was Shipment, killhouse was the plywood training map

it do be like that sometimes

He’s playing BB, anyone can do that lmao.

Fuze

Black ice is quite rare. It’s under the “epic” category which, according to statistics, drops from packs 18% of the time. But then you have to factor in all of the shitty epic items that could also drop. So realistically you probably have like a 2% chance of a black ice drop, which is comparable to a legendary item. I’m a lvl 140 and have it for Buck’s DMR and the Russian pistol and that’s it. My friend is a lvl 100 or so and has it for Bandit, IQ, Ash and Jager.
---
Yeah maybe it’s just a console thing, but I’ve seen rounds both on my team and against where he has just dominated whole matches
---
Depth strider is Def better than bane of arthropods
---
Yes brother

The cosplay isnt good you are clearly not 1000lbs and you dont just lay in your mates dead body

Luckily you didn't get to 2300 and still in silver III

club house or coastline because they're both really balanced and fun to play

I had a hard time finding smoke, i immediately saw the trex tho.

I do this too but with his pink jumpsuit, and definitely not because I spent $30 on that event and couldn't get the Unicorn helmet. Definitely not the reason

Rip Monty, he's fucked
---
Yeah, me too.
---
truly
---
I wanna know what that thermite was seeing..
---
Every time you warn your firing a fuze charge and then someone runs in like it shoots cupcakes and handjobs
---
One of my first packs was m870 black ice lmao
---
Well then you're not supposed to get kills as monty
---
You should help your team getting the plant down and win the round
---
current lion is actually pretty nice. he's not an easy operator to fully utilise so a slightly below winrate in pubs is no big deal. They could reduce the v308 recoil a tad but i honestly wouldn't touch him rn.
---
I use it now if that makes you feel any better
---
ouch
---
Then hopefully I’ll be able to get back into ranked without ping problems
---
If only you could put skins on Recruit's guns, that would make the M870 Recruit rush so much better lmao

I guess IQ cant find this drone. Best location for drone.

Smoke is a good counter to shield operators
---
Not crazy at all
---
You ordah 3 shirrrty chicken?
---
This. I have no idea who even tested Nokk to come to conclusion that she was so OP that she is given FMG. FMG is an Ok gun in Defender's perspective and absolutely horrible choice on an Attacker who works alone. 
---
Nokk doesn't have damage nor range aspect to go against popular Defenders who all outguns her.
---
If you claim you have dignity why are you so salty you lost? Either learn how to counter spawn peeking by learning the common angles or by droning the area out before peeking into windows
---
I mean, skill and stuff should be the same on both PS4 just has more players
---
Usually alibi isn't used to trick the enemy, mostly she is used to ping any late round justs through windows or it gives the defenders something to peek behind. If you are going to try to trick the enemy, then yeah, don't use the acs
---
My own because I'm lonely

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh cheese burger

The free legendary I got was just the color pink
---
I did not know they had more, i guess i understand though
---
I had an  idea for a foam gun like from Prey. It would patch up Hibana holes, drone holes, open Mira mirrors, etc. The idea was to not let the grenade into the site rather than destroy it.
---
hell yes, on the wild west map
---
🤔
---
New York
---
I'm salty because they used a cheap trick and exploit to win and they didn't use common angels. Plus I waited 30 minutes just to lose to a cheap tricking smurf and derank
---
Perhaps
---
I never said you dont know how to counter blitz, buddy. I was explaining to you one of the ways that you could POTENTIALLY counter him. Im not saying just wait for him to blind you and attempt the strategy, but im saying when he does blind you, that is one the things you can attempt. 
---
You can think it's dumb all you want. It has worked for me countless times and im not going to stop doing anytime soon. 
---
You thinking that blitz shouldn't even be able to sprint is pretty dumb itself. Think about what his name means and how Ubisoft originally wanted him to play. To rush people. 
---
And your last point is very wrong. Monty is picked a decent amount of times in pro league because he is the best shield OP in the game, so it's not that "sHieLdS aRe a BugGy mEsS". It's that blitz is practically worthless at high rank when you pick Monty. 
---
When were having a nice disscusion until you decided to get triggered and starting calling my strategy dumb and using that idiotic meme text. 
---
You didnt my mind about anything and Im certain this game will die before Overwatch does. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Thanks
---
My favorite was the old version of Hereford. It was easy to learn, had balanced objectives, and was just fun to play around with.
---
This would actually be so fun
---
It really did lol
---
Belive me the whole match gets funky when a spanish speaker or a portuguese speaker insult the other whit a racial slur
---
You can always stand still and pretend when you feel someone is pushing.
---
literally ubisoft
---
Shhh, dont tell the coppers and silvers that!!
---
I guess that's correct and I have not thought about this but that does not really cover the reason why they don't release the ones for console. I am sure that they must be at least slightly different
---
Damn now they know
---
I think
---
Huh, I’ve never heard nor would I understand what they would be saying so
---
Same here. It was awful. Just the color pink is not worth being a legendary
---
I keep trying to spawn peek with rook but he's just so dummy thicc that the sound of his ass cheeks clapping is heard from a mile away.
---
House because of all the year one memories
---
Xbox casual is awful but I don’t usually have a five stack so I just gotta suck it up. 
---
Xbox live hasn’t changed a bit since the halo 3 days.
---
I love SpwanPeeking
---
RACIST! lol
---
Maybe is because i play late at night sjsbsvsvs
---
Both lol. Controls for Xbox and PS4 the aiming and shooting are usually reversed like on Xbox it's lt and rt and on ps it's like l1 and r1
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Ubi doesn't want him to be auto-banned every match.
---
It's because people dont want to deal with shields in general
---
Oh, it doesn't say that anywhere....  usually for factual information a source is needed
---
Possibly
---
I want a bonneless pizza
---
patch notes came out earlier today
---
There are plenty of ways they could tweak him
---
- Give him a bit more movement while seeing through smoke. 
---
- Make him a 2 speed 
---
- Give him a stronger gun 
---
- Add another element to his gadget so he's less situational. (Like how Dokkaebi can call people and hack cams or how zofia can also withstand) 
---
Any one (or possibly even 2) of those would work.
---

no. just NO. the 99 damage was ok (even then it didnt down enemies from 2 meters no matter how many bullets!) but i dont care thats rb6. i mean i got headshotted today through my shield with monty. thats the way it is. ppl are/were just complaining about cav because they were too bad at the game. i mean come on.. you just have to use your drone and watch flanks, then cav is useless. but no lets complain about how "OP" her pistol is, because we are too bad at this game that we even lose a gunfight with an AR against a PISTOL. ppl should stop complaining about everything, they should more try to improve at the game.
---
Buck’s rifle doesn’t have that much horizontal recoil but it has the vertical recoil of a DMR
---
True, but I believe it's mostly to not let people use them as an argument.   
---
"X operator is underpicked on PC but overpicked and wins too much on consoles, therefore X must be nerfed because consoles are the majority"  
---
Or something of that nature.
---
A Tachanka buff is so easy I simply do not understand why it hasn’t been done yet:
---
1. Cut turret deploy time in half, reduce recoil by 10%-20%
---
2. Give the 9mm an ACOG
---
3. (Optional) Give him a C4, maybe Kapkan’s.
---
Smoke. But there's a reason why you don't take the FMG9 with Smoke.
---
I bet he can relate to Doge

just a quick little info for you there, originally blitz couldn’t run with his shield out, they only changed it because people were complaining about it

Try using no muzzle on it
---
I don't think he needs a nerd I just think his ability is annoying and that is why he gets banned alot however echo shouldn't be able to stop you from planting or putting out gadgets. I think he needs a nerf in that regards.
---
Oh fuck oh shit
---
It’s weird that people are so against you on this since the chart clearly backs you up. 
---
I’m high Plat 3 and have started dabbling in him and already my team is starting to ask me to pick him consistently. He’s a bulletproof drone that has the ability to shoot people once they get distracted by your team. Not to mention he has smoke. Lesion mines are more visible now so if you’re careful you can just ping them and have your team shoot them. 
---
So long as you avoid cornering yourself Smoke is more of a delay than a counter. It takes way more coordination to take out Monty than it does to use him. You just have to learn when to stand still and become a mobile Mira window for your team.
---
As an occasional salty stoner can confirm.
---
PS4 had more people with mics from what I remember.

I was just trying to save him lmao

Warden should get an AR and be able to move with his gadget. No ACOG though.
---

---
No old Hereford forever
---
That's an X-Drive badge, my guy.
---
Ayyyy
---
You must be playing in low copper then. 
---
He isn't even a "funnel" right now. Literally anyone with a breach charge can render his gadget useless. He aides the attacking team by allowing them to plant on his walls without fear of getting shot during the animation. 
---
A funnel forces the attacking ops to go in through one or two doors at most. Giving Castle the buff I proposed would do that. 
---
He wouldn't be the most OP operator in the game, he has plenty of counters still... Maverick, Hibana, and thermite are plenty to counter him with a good team.
---
This just makes me sad about how they made the scope for the .44 mag ugly as fuck now
---
well he did admit that he’s *not* so...
---
It's a CSGO mode, too. Called "arms race".
---
Lol, I thought it was photoshopped at first

More like you’re a useless talkative asshole with a bad attitude
---
Not gonna upvote bc it’s at 69 but I definitely would
---
Wait is this DansomeWoja from coconutbrahs vids?
---
ADS up and running
---
No
---
I’m just imagining him as this absolute crusader, covered in plates of glorious silver, desperate to impress lord ubi for a suit of gold. So he slays his enemies with the power of a full nights sleep and a 5 stack, going 15 kills and 0 deaths. Only to be granted a singe point of MMR.
---

Wow no way thank you for being up how toxic siege is. None of us would have known withought you. NO SHIT THE GAME IS TOXIC ITS WORSE THAN RUST!!!
---
if u play house, its the one near river docks, and its an easy push XD
---
Honestly Ubisoft is at the point where they might just need to delete some operators and refund people who had them.
---
Warden absolutely sucks and I haven’t seen Ubisoft ever changed an operators speed and guns, both of which he needs to have changed.
---
I feel like the devs have had restless nights thinking of Blackbeard
---
Jackal and Lion have been hellish for the devs
---
Why are they nerfing shields? As a Montaigne main it’s not like he’s too op in my opinion.
---

Lucky shot most likely. Happens to the best of us.
---
They only do it so they can post it on Reddit. It should be downvoted and banned as karma farming at this point.
---
Yeah, agree about Nokk. The idea of stealthy Attacker looks cool on paper but all it takes is Anchor pressuring entry points and she's rendered useless and offer nothing to her team. There's no reason to pick her over other Flanking operators such as Ashe, Mav, and IQ. 
---
I like the idea of Defender even though the similar concept has been discussed for some time. Imagine the panic as the Attacker realize what just happened. However, how would other Defenders interact with it? It might get in the way of some Defender's rotation.
---
Because shields are too powerful now, they aren’t meant to be a one man army
---
I think hard coding the bosg on every operator at the start of the match is a lot fucking easier than switching through every gun in existence on run time...
---
And we all know the engine is a little "challenged" at just running the normal game without blowing up
---
1- hipfire spam after you down. At that &lt;2m range, all shots would hit.
---
2- shields are NEVER supposed to win a 1vX. Hell, in an ideal scenario, you can NEVER win a 1vX. It's the stupidity of your enemies that you capitalise on to win a 1vX. So nothing much has changes. If they are dumb, you would with regardless.

No they were definitely thinking of montagne

Excuse me, but I am a navy seal veteran with over 2000 confirmed kills. Treat me with respect or expect a ban from reddit.
---
Lion has been nerfed so he isn't as good though his gadget is still no risk high reward. Zofia is often picked in pro league and I have heard people like her so that might be your best bet. Buck is great at vertical play if you want that though his gun has one of the worst if not the worst recoil in the game. Twitch has a good gun and an invaluable gadget against a lot of ops. Nomad is really good against roamers. Hibana is great for opening hatches or murder holes. Capitao is good to prevent bandit tricking on several maps though its kind of a niche thing. The list goes on but in general I think you can't go wrong with one of those.
---
I mean they did July 4th and stuff this year as well, but they skipped Japan’s National Foundation day which they did have a charm for last year

Melee clash hard.
---
Yes they should. If someone who wants to ply with there friend should be able to regardless of rank. There are genuine people including myself who play with lower ranked friends.
---
I have a copper friend who I play with who is level 40.. and to be honest is absolutely awful at the game meanwhile I’m Plat 3/Gold 1. 
---
What should happen however is the highest ranked person on the team is a large portion of what the MMR Average is based off.
---
Example:
---
Currently 2 plat 1s, 1 Gold 1 and 2 copper 4s will be placed against Gold 3s based on average MMR. This is wrong and the issue. 
---
If you rework it to a weighted system.. say 40% for Top rank, 30% for second, 20% for 3rd and the bottom 2 only combine for 10% of it then it would average out to Plat 3 which is a much more accurate matchmaking system.
---
With this system it would almost eliminate the copper 4 derankers as it only account for 5% of the MMR average.. not the current 20%.
---
Below is a few example of “current” plus the “improved” listed above.
---
3 Plat 1s and 2 copper 4s.
---
Currently: Placed against Gold 2s
---
Improved: Plat 2s
---
Plat 1, 2 &amp; 3 and 2 Coper 4s
---
Currently: Gold 3
---
Improved: Plat 3
---
3 Silver 1s, 2 Bronze 3s
---
Before: Silver 3
---
Improved: Silver 2
---
Even as an entry fragger his wr wasn’t even that high compared to other more stronger ops, so stupid of a nerf
---
suppressor? isn’t that useless

Literally watched a mute put down his mute jammer in front of 2 walls I already electrified, not once, not twice, but 3 times.
---
I know those terms lol. I'm just unsure if Ubi would limit kills to natural numbers or integers. I suppose someone could try to overflow it and see what comes out the other end.
---
I think that the reasoning for giving her a weak gun is because her gadget is way too strong for attack, so they have to compensate for it somewhere.
---
But Warden does have a terrible SMG, along with being too slow
---
Oof
---
I don’t have access, it’s either deleted, privated, doesn’t exist, or you spelled it wrong
---
I miss the old blitz, the instantly go for the head blitz.
---
Try again mistyped
---
Why?
---
I saw lol
---
I've seen it to. It was back in the older patch notes, around the time Lion was broken.
---
JUST GIVE US THE NEW DEPLOYABLE SHIELDS ALREADY. IT WAS ANNOUNCED A LONG TIME AGO
---
Thanks for posting my post there
---
Lmao
---
That’s what I mean, just remove the hipfire and take away the frontal weakspot.
---
They have already nerfed shield ADS time, and with these changes it’s going to really hinder the shield.
---
They need to make it so that if a player leaves the game within a certain distance from Cav, they get a free interrogation.
---
Of course
---
[like this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ac51cf/an_interesting_face_you_have_there_ash/)

I literally got off a villa match, came in and my team was down. It’s 0-2, I drag these sacks of garbage kicking and screaming into a tied game and they all left on the tie-breaker. This is the usu solo queue experience
---
I dont get it
---
Brig's shield after this new update...
---
Literely the same bro and on pc. Playing the game from the end of outbrake just missed it.
---
Because with the hipfire spread increase, the ADS nerf and the 2 shot melee, having s frontal weakspot doesn’t make any sense.
---
I’ll never understand why getting final kill cam is a death sentence.
---
Re read now
---
It’s because the people on rainbow six siege use an adapter witch makes the console think that it is receiving controller inputs but really, they are playing on m&amp;k

Ps4 servers are the same shit, just less TK and more people leaving over smallest things
---
Open up a karma court case. I will be a witness
---
Hipfire is sometimes the only defence you’ve got though, if I’m looking at someone through a window and they are aiming for my head for when I ads, I can only hipfire, and if there frost Mat or guu mine right under the window, I can’t go in, I rather have the ability to hipfire and expose my hand than just doing a  staring contest
---
Nah mate
---
Is that so? I've been killed plenty of times by my teammates for the stupidest reasons, and plenty of times I've been left for dead like OP. hopefully this is true
---
Fuze shield and a lot of blitz them become useless though. Montagne would only be viable with a team as well.
---
Can confirm
---
I ain’t mad, we both just made the same joke. I’m chill, I’ve probably got more karma anyways
---
Was talking with friends one time in Spanish. Said black ice (hielo negro) and got the message for saying negro
---
Holy shit.
---
u realize who that is
---
Like a turret with wheels!
---
too bad the song ruins the video.
---
Nice strat
---
To be fair, this joke has probably already been made multiple times before haha
---
Pistols should be close to last
---
If your only option is to hipfire your really not doing your job as a shield. Yes, you can sometimes fall back on it but most of the time a good player will be able to plink away at your HP before you’ve managed to make good use of it.
---
COD has gun game?
---
No gridlock you’re just too fucking morbidly obese
---
G(re)at (post)
---
Since when has that stopped me
---
YES!!!
---
I’ve seen it before but I saw that at a gas station and thought I’d make it too
---
I don’t know what blitz or Fuze uses hipfire as their main means of fighting enemies.
---
He was gold the past 4 seasons with xim on xbox😂.
---
I asked him to add me on steam, to show him how to play mnk.
---
What is this, a meme for ants?
---
I try tellin er to lay off the feckin vegimite, yeh? WELL SHE DOENT FECKIN LAY OFF OF IT MATE, GREEDLOCK IS A FAT FOOK
---
Ubisoft should still let diamonds play with Cooper's but the enemies follow the highest rank which would be the diamonds
---
Where is docs stim pistol
---
This shit looks like fortnite skin
---
Yeah, it's just like this on PC too LOL
---
This caption cracked me up
---
Wonder what your camera screen would look like,would the dots whaling each individual camera go across the screen
---
I can help you with windows actovation if you need it.
---
Damn the last few seconds was like a scene out of a movie lol. Deagle kills are so satisfying
---
Respawns have never been present in Siege, which most likely means they haven't designed anything to pick random spawns for players during the course of a match. Designing that would definitely take way too much time and money for one mode.
---
No who is it?
---
But it’s already like this. I see no problem.
---
some pro league player. he plays for velocity
---
ADS is a unviable mechanism when trying to taunt enemies as well as facing against two or more opponents. You may be the fastest hand in the west brother, but you can't shoot two at once.
---
I dont know what level of play you are at at the moment, but Glaz was OP before and I'm speaking as a plat.  I do agree though the nerd was a bit harsh.
---
Idk why but I read this in an Irish accent
---
This is what 1000 hours of mute looks like
---
I love this idea and really any other new game mode ideas, I feel like the game needs some new game modes to keep it interesting and attract new players, for me at least regular old siege got kinda boring and slow so some sort of death match or gun game would be awesome
---
Why us he being a bitch playing in gold
---
You can buy those figures on the Ubi website
---
Hop into a custom game and do it on ash while you stand on top of it. It does 90 damage.
---
Hello fiat-3000, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cf4gwe/does_anyone_know_how_to_fix_the_authenticating/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You gotta shoot the default
---
How this thing works please? I understand I need to put in details,but they are only operator details or player as a whole details? Im stupid I know
---
😂 You're such a troll
---
LOL that would work as well. Both of these new operators are complete joke.
---
I can't even count how many times mirra teammate killed me because i was reinforcing a wall, but that gone after reverse ff update. Now they only insult my whole family.
---
Operator details. If you look at examples I've listed , those players bed operators are Doc and Jager. You can find specific stats using an app and possibly on Ubi website.
---
So should I get standard? Is it possible to unlock the ops by playing standard a lot?
---
It's because of shit like this that I can barely even enjoy the game in casual modes. Could Ubisoft not just remove friendly fire from casual, or what? Or at least get rid of it in Terrorist Hunt, ffs.
---
Maaaybe now that they prevented him from moving while using his scope they can give him his 2-shot-down-at-any-range rifle back.
---
With the appropriate ROF nerf, of course (ROF goes down when flip sitght is engaged, normal ROF with 1x sight).
---
That's WHY he would get banned, the RFF got activated when chanka downed OP, when OP dies, the chanka will most likely get banned. I experienced it myself. Btw you can't kill someone twice since RFF will prevent people from doing that.
---
Lol he is not a diamond just a plat a low level plat at that.  He at best is a average good plat player.
---
Level 61 Silver 2
---
OK thanks, yeah I use R6 stats to see my status and stuff, thanks for elaborating 👍🏻
---
Nah, responding to every non-serious/figurative instance is fine if it actually saves someone’s life. People go through some wild shit and have some dark thoughts sometimes, and maybe seeing this comment on their favorite gaming subreddit helped someone get in touch with the help that they need to move on to a better point in life.
---
You bought something off a place you hadn't vetted? Or isn't a known and trusted vendor?
---
So should I get standard edition then? Is it able to unlock them all in standard edition, just by playing a lot?
---
Hey mate I also live in the Middle East. It's really frustrating man.

BTW wanna play? Console or pc?

Like that one Halo cut scene glitch where Master Cheif has a Helmet under his Helmet
---
The look of a player who is primed and ready to team kill the hell out of that bandit...

Most likely big boys in a 4 stack who are afraid of playing with a pug 5th unless they look like scrubs who can't 4v5 everyone. xD

You're not allowed to witch hunt on this subreddit

Kids like smelling roses, men like smelling deodorant,

legends like smelling Black Ice...
---
It’s a racial slur against Hispanic people.
---
Looking forward to seeing how the buff affects my game play with him. Obviously he’ll never be back to what he was before the nerf but hopefully these buffs lend him to bring a bit more balanced of an operator. I’m excited for my boi ❤️❤️
---
how is it harsher? hipfire is going to be useless, removing the weakspot will just allow you to be frontally protected.
---
Play ranked. Casual is too toxic.
---
This is why I hate secure
---
Looks like I’m gonna have to add this montage to the spank bank
---
that wouldn't really fit the style of the game at all. How would ops work?
---
HE’S ROAMING
---
YEP!
---
Would it qualify as a witch hunt if they directly told me they are booting and threatened to Swat me? If so is there a subreddit for this kind of thing where I can get this asshat banned?
---
I have and the game just puts me in another ongoing match. (Sorry for late reply.)
---
I can feel this dude just burning inside trying to hide it with laughs lmao
---
Lmao I had the reverse situation last night, there was this kid and I accidentally broke his smoke gas grenade and he got mad and I didn’t wanna hear the “we lost the game because of you bs” so I tk’d him (we won without him btw) and he got so pissed and I messaged him over Xbox telling him to chill and he had the confederate flag as his gamerpic and mf got mad after somebody else tk’d him for being racist and he said white power and left. Kid sounded no older than 11. Smh
---
The only way to counter it is to play with friends.

this brings up the question of why blackbeard can't just use air for his shield. It can take way more hits

Everybody knows intel is meta on defense, like it has been for the past year.

R4-C is Top 5 in attack weapons and losing the ACOG did not matter in Plat and Diamond. Ash is currently the 4th-highest picked Atk Operator with the highest win-rate. Unless the ACOG G36C is carrying the load, the R4-C IS a game changer, like all very good weapons are.
---
F2 is fine, I was talking more the F2 being nerfed brought down her pickrate, which is what they intended to do. Hence it being a step in the right direction.
---
u/UbiBoat u/Ubi-WildWatermelon how about a big fat ban for all those tkers in his team?
---
cool
---
Well of course you wouldn't see it.
---
Ok. Thanks for the meaningless post
---
Regardless whether or not I give callouts or the fact that i may have been downed somewhere not too close the fact of the matter is that they have no skills, map sense, garbo aim, play like a 7 year old and talk senseless shit rather than letting  people focus. Sure it happens with other groups but not all too often. At least English groups give call outs and useful knowledge.
---
r/itswooooshwithouttheh

That was actually good. Enjoyed it

As long people can leave games without consequences, this will be a thing.

Now all you gotta do is try this on realistic

Thanks, this is my first montage so I’m glad you liked it.
---
This is a good thing, Maverick was far too quiet, to the point where you could be literally pressed against the wall he was burning through and the first you’d know about it is when you’re taken out. That’s not a fun operator to play against, and before anyone comments “bUt hE’S sUPoSeD tO Be a sTeaLtH opEraTor!!” He still is, he’s still way quieter than both existing hard breachers.
---
If you’re playing IQ and Smoke don’t be super aggressive

Not a big fan of having to finish someone else's game for them.

Well done for exploiting a glitch and killing people who didn't know about it.

I watched this dude place his jammer on a electrified wall and walk away, he went and reinforced something while his jammer broke, he came back and placed another one, that one broke too. 
---
He then placed another before finally just walking away

It was pretty funny to watch, he was like level 20 or something so

Reverse friendly fire isn’t really helping because the people still get their enjoyment of fucking with you

Don't solo queue
---
Thats why if you go down in the ranks it is almost impossible to solo queue your way back up
---
1. WAY late
---
2. play Buck and thatcher and Hibana
---
3. Aim down sites
---
4. PAY attention to noise
---
5. watch videos and tips
---
6. Hide drone near obj so you know where they are shooting from
---
7. Communicate
---
8. No TKing
---
9. NO fuse on hostage
---
10. Have sites up when around OBJ
---
11. enter OBJ by breaching
---
12. Don't use red dot
---
13. Use rope if OBJ is high
---
14. play the hatches
---
15. Don't be retarded and not ban an op on ranked because you are on attacking or defense first
---
16. USE secondary gadgets
---
Let’s be real, the “kill/ hate on the best player on your team” mentality has been around since before Fortnite happened.

Some of you may die, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make
---
He's in an odd spot because ubi have no idea what to do with him anymore after all the changes. I feel like all they needed to do was keep glaz how he was and just give us warden with a better weapon and access to an acog like the mp5 maybe.
---
Not new. A post once a week this pops up. If they glitch or ddosing the whole team will suffer for them. I only got points as I was on the side getting cheated.
---
You're evil

But I respect you for sharing your trick and warning others

I know that, it’s just who’s doing that stuff at that low of a rank

I jumped on ranked for the first time tonight and first match first round I aced the other team. Got a double kill with a grenade and proceeded to stomp the other team. Finished with like 10 kills. Rode that high for about 3 min until I was curb stomped the rest of the night...sigh.

However I use an elite controller, which allows you to calibrate the stick sensitivity separate from the game. I have custom elite controller settings, so these settings for Rainbow may feel different from how it plays for me. Hope this helps though.

Then maybe don't play. I don't mean that to sound harsh, I am just saying that if it's resulting in a less then pleasant experience for you and the other players, it's time to take a break until you can figure out why your latency is so bad.
---
There may be nothing you can do to that end, in which case I think you need to ask if this is really a hobby you are in a position to have. It's a shitty thing to consider, but there is nothing stopping you from playing other types of games that aren't so dependent on stable internet.

Either shift all movement keys so far to the middle of the keyboard so they wont use old bindings, or you get an external usb keyboard.

I said one thing, you’re the one arguing with me about it lol I really don’t care that much

Imagine trying to kill yourself 5 times and still failing at it.

What does you saying one thing have to do with anything? When did I say I wasn’t arguing? I’m simply trying to insert some common sense into you but you can’t change someone if they’re too stubborn to do it themselves

I'm sure you had a felling it's just spaces. I also report the whole enemy team when one of them put too many spaces in their message lmao I'm so random

People like you are the reason he was removed.
---
What? You haven't made a ticket and got a reply in ten mins.
---
That is on the exact level of OP as Tachanka-shooting-us-all-on-Kanal or Pulse-nuked-our-entire-elevator-team on Tower or something. Not really a concern, IMO.
---
Even in bronze people are still trying to play and enjoy the game. The same people who play ranked are the same people who win when they get stomped by smurfs, even though they're literally doing the exact same shit.
---
Because Fuze needed even more downsides right?
---
SANTA GONE ELECTROCUTE YO WALLS!!
---
Dunno what to tell you, dude. Disagree?
---
This is rage inducing.
---
Ranked is out of beta, not rank
---
it has operator bans and a limited a map pool now
---
Woah that made such a difference!
---
What elo are you in that you seriously think this would be a good idea? 
---
All it takes is your warden and your jager to team up to get free kills, this is literally lion tiers of op.
---
Huge lol for this dood.
---
He finished WB with more than 900 games with a 49% winrate
---
For BH with 160 games he had 90% winrate
---
Now for PS with 250 he have 93% winrate
---
I think between Wind Bastion and Burnt Horizon he upgraded his controller for a M&amp;K
---
Thermals exist, but not in the way portrayed in r6. Cloaking is not a real thing and there are no battery powered glasses that can cleanse you eyes to a pre-flashbang state during its effects nor from a quick google search is there anything in a glasses form that prevents flashbangs from having an effect on you.
---
~~un~~fortunatelly this game still count W/L since is hard if not impossibile to make a system for this game that count your real 'skill',
---
...how the hell can you kill someone with a lifeline lol. You need to have extreme good aim. Also Baliff should be replaced with another pistol
---
lmao ok buddy
---
We want our acog back
---
Hey guys I'm basing my A level project on R6.
---
The program let's you build a squad from all currently available operators and will evaluate stats to give tips/warnings about combinations and a few little side features to view stats/bios.
---
I would really appreciate if anyone could answer a couple questions for [my survey](https://forms.gle/RqNaRdXaRXxB4anx5).
---
Thanks for reading!
---
Because the old map was unbalanced af and only fun if you were in bronze, whereas the current one is better balanced but unfun for everyone.
---
They should have just remvoed the map all together tbh.
---
Why would it be specifically Puerto Rican’s? A bigot  isn’t gonna go up to a brown person and ask if they’re Puerto Rican so they can call them a spic.
---
Oh you know? Nice.
---
Im not putting it dude, thats me. Maybe you are not that smart xD
---
please, feel free to disprove me mate
---
They could've taken away 300
---
10/10
---
So just because i play recruit they have to remove him? Why not remove every op with negative win delta then?
---
What he deserves.
---
I play casual on pc quite a bit. And it gets toxic 1/4 games. And usually its 1 or 2 people that turn the whole team toxic.
---
Well your opinion is clearly pure shit and founded on nothing.
---
Recruit has no hard counter because they don’t have any unique gadgets, unique gadgets is what makes the game what it is, all of the competitive metas the game has ever had, have existed because of unique gadgets. 
---
You mention recruit players in ranked would only be in late bronze to early gold, I wonder why they are in such Elo with a lack of desire to win.. 
---
There is no situation where a CTU’s recruit is better than an actual operator, for example, Thermite, Ash, Pulse and Castle are all superior to what an FBI recruit brings to the match, the same can be said for every other CTU.

Yeah I play monty as a 'fuck you free round' cheese pick in ranked, and even I have to admit he's hilariously OP in his current state.

You can toss C4 into Shipping Dock spawn, and kill the entire team. All it takes is your anyone with a C4 doing it.
---
*Follows back*
---
Interesting option. I'm surprised that I didn't think of this one.  
---
However, Nokk's biggest weakness comes from her complete reliance on her stealth and how she doesn't have a way to deal with the Anchors pressuring entry points. 
---
Other flanking ops, Attackers in general, have damage and range benefits to have an edge over Defenders. Even when Anchors are holding angles, Attackers have chance to entering obj and fight them especially after dronning their location. Nokk has neither the damage nor the range aspects. Her only chance is Anchors looking at different direction, which by then other Attackers can also take out these Anchors. 
---
She needs some damage buff to be more justified in being picked over other flanking ops like Ashe, Mav, and IQ. IQ taking out every hidden cams in the area and crouch walking into obj poses more threat than Nokk silently going in with her FMG. Mav and his blowtorch pressure Anchors more.
---
look up ERC-7, thats cloaking, if u google R6 Warden, boom, you can see the glasses, and if u look up Eyenox Model 3, you can see Jackal's visor
---
I have a questions. Can I get the short cut of his gaget plase
---
NEVER TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF MONTAGNE
---
You say it like doing a game mode like this is a bad thing.
---
You sure ? There's no PC player in the top 10 leaderboard
---
You don't need ACOG to peak...
---
If I sat somewhere like above Garage on Bank, jump out, toss my smokes and use the 2 seconds before detection wisely then I should have at the very least a couple free shots before they can detect my exact location in the smoke.
---
Great job! But they're on attack... lol

---
Like what's gonna actually happen in Area 51 ?
---
I want my mmr back
---
I wish ubisoft would do some more with dealing with people like that it doesn't happen too often but it ruins it for everyone and it's no fun to play against a team where the just kill each other or leave.
---
I see, thanks
---
It looks more and more like Ubi is pushing buttons randomly hoping the game will balance itself...
---
This video makes me proud of being a Kaid main

---
You just said I was
---
2/10, i need to see a video of the wrist-breaking recoil
---
Xbox casual is very toxic
---
so the model is wrong...
---
It was only a total of 25k renown to be fair but yeah that's enough for 1 dlc operator
---
essentially a double flick, yeah?
---
Low sensetivity
---
compensator affects all shots.
---
muzzle brake only affects the first shot, but much more.
---
flash hider does both but less effectively.
---
yep. same goes for Clash. She's a support op and does require a good coordinated team and if you're the last one alive and as long your name is not BikiniBodhi you will very likely lose the round
---
I find it funny that in these situations, if the other team just did absolutely nothing, like not even touched their controls once then they would have won
---
The problem is that, despite so many people call her anti-roaming, she doesn't actually have much utility to track down and find the roamers. She has the least chance to actually encounter them because she doesn't get shown up on cams so the roamers are more likely going after Nokk's teammates.
---
Of course, she can get call outs from her teammates once they get attacked or found them with drones. However, by then, any other Attackers can do the job. Nokk gets outgunned by every single popular Roamers if she encounters them. Some people suggests hiding in more heavy traffic area to cut off Roamers but Ashe taking out cams and just doing that is far more threatening. IQ can reliably take out hidden cams such as Valk, Echo, and Mozzie so she can also flank around those areas. Nokk just doesn't replace anyone in any role. 
---
So many people are like Nokk shouldn't take out cams so the Defenders won't know, which is true. However, every cams in the area should be destroyed to allow Attackers rotate more freely without being targeted by left over Roamers or Anchors changing their angles to counter Attackers rotating. Nokk not destroying cam benefit only herself. Though I myself try to back out after taking down one Anchor (since any more than that likely will get me killed in fights) and destroy every cams in the path so my teams can be more free. 
---
Ubi seems to be wanting to keep her damage aspect low and make her dependent on her stealth to do anything. If so, she should be able to run while using gadget so she can pop from different places quietly like a ghost. This would justify her 2 speed and weak gun much more than her current walking slowly.
---
Well of course I know that but usually there’s some very vague and usually stupid reason behind the toxicity, but this was just out of nowhere
---
Did you take a look at her right arm
---
Yea he was meant to stop rushers, now they get a slap on the wrist.
---
Go to your R6 folder. Right click the launcher -&gt; properties -&gt; compatibility -&gt; disable fullscreen optimization. Got rid of the watermark in game for me
---
fr tho lol
---
we do have a bigger playerbase on console, but they cater to PC more since it's easier to implement stuff on there. it's fair but it sucks for us console players
---
Did you read my last comment?
---
ACOG on the C8
---
Fair play you absolute madman.
---
that's in casual, kanal isn't in the ranked roatation. plus that's a really situational throw and it doesn't work half the time
---
Then why are you asking

I wasn't sure what you were complaining about so I asked.
---
You going to explain how it's broken or are you just going to continue just saying it's broken? It's a good idea and since you mentioned Lion, Lion was not broken when your outline is shown only when you move.
---
😭😭 free renown as consolation at least
---
You have a strong point here
---
I wasn't complaining It was funny so I shared
---
The problem with reports is that one single report could also be just one dude who is very mad. 10 reports could be a dude and his buddies being very mad. 50+ reports tho are a different story, it then has to pass through to a human to look at it, but that human has probably 250 more report cases in the inbox, the work begins: are those 50 reporters associated? do they all say something simmilar about why they reported?
---
could take a week or more sometimes. And that is with xbox/ps4 internal reports, ubi toxic behavior reports are...idk what they are. Maybe they activate some kind of monitoring tool to track what someone does (negative points for example), or they are just being recorded and once someone peaks X reports per day/week/month/season they get time banned for toxic behavior.
---
I see
---
This nerf is only to influence the mindset of the community to not ban him and it'll likely be not successful.
---
And he is only over picked because he gets played every round he is not banned in PC Plat/Dia ranked, but the win delta is still the same
---
yes consoles leak ip from parties sadly. never accept invites from ur opponents.
---
just give a diff smg
---
It’s even worse from a casual point of view. Playing hostage/secure is basically playing ranked now, as all the gold 2+ all sweat their balls off because they can’t play in ranked. Smurfs have reached peak toxic, and balanced games are a thing of the past.
---
I hate those kind of players toxic people Just like. Other peoples suffering. But reverse is really nice job Ubisoft.
---
same here my guy, I'd switch to PC if I had the time... or the space... or the money...
---
If you're cool you can join our group.  Avoiding TK from randoms is high priority for us.  We aren't great at the game though...
---
I was on ranked two days ago 2v1 on outback and in a fight with jackle and my other teammate came up behind me and shot me point blank back of the head ....he then also died. Told me he wanted final kill
---
How is he "AIDS"? He's literally over picked and too weak by a fair amount
---
Same. Lol
---
I got perma banned does that count
---
&gt; Just ~~Xbox~~ casual being toxic 
---
There ya go
---
Can you downvote pls so I get 6969?
---
Kafe is my favourite map and whenever me and my friend are attacking 3f or 2f we spawn park and run up white stairs, it works as long most of the time and catches the defenders off guard because they will still be preparing for the action phase
---
Niger is banned but the Japanese can still tell me to run away
---
Looks to me like you’re managing recoil fine 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Xbox is weird, I found having a goofy/funny gamertag usually insulates me from what would otherwise be toxic behavior in R6 and other games.
---
The PDW just felt so much more comfortable for me. Fast ADS, nice fire rate.. i love it
---
Uhhhh any tips on getting to plat or diamond? Pls tell me
---
I like the 3 round change, but op bans would work just fine with switching sides every round.  The only difference is that you couldn't pull the "I'm starting on X side so I'm really going to hamstring the other side with this ban and hope I get enough of a lead the other side gives up" type bans.
---
I'm not even certain it would change the bans all that much.  A lot of them are "I can't stand/deal with this op so lets remove him".  And while tactical bans of the other side would become less influential, they would no longer be limited to the side you don't start on.  I.e. you would be more likely to ban Thatcher when you start on attack because you think you can adapt to his absence better and no longer risk being down 3-0 if you can't.
---
I dont think "rando click Facebook button" qualifies as enlistment.

No black ice for barbed and nitro, not a real bandit main. /s

How is Steve jobs going to afford food for his kids when you don't buy windows???

By the look of the title I thought y'all were gonna lose

That diamond at the bottom lol
---
Game is on sale so I am downloading now. I’m setting a timer for 2 hours and if it’s as bad as I hear unfortunately I’m going to get a refund. It looks like a fun game but I’m not going to play something just so some kids can ruin my mood.
---
I don’t use jackal but does standing in a mute jammer stop it?

---
Wish granted now its 123
---
Red 3 looks very promising.
---
*Use code "Frost" for 20% of your first purchase*
---
How to tackle it though?
---
Could Fuze become a 2-2? That may help his pick rate.
---
Tachanka should be like Maestro, give him his LMG as his default gun, give it ACOG/High-Power Scope and make his gadget something like providing bonus ammo/gadget resupplies (eg resupply up to 2 barbed wires, bullet proof cams or shields [doesn't resupply explosives].
---
So Tachanka is like bringing two bonus gadget uses and a strong anchor weapon.
---
My leg!!!
---
Good video
---
It's that short.
---
He's blind and you're deaf!
---
maybe you can buy it for me bb 😍😃
---
Don't spend all those points at once Jimmy
---
That’s what I was thinking, I could freeze the cam or glitch so that they could move together in a pact instead of just her
---
It's just white digital camo?
---
He just got a crazy buff
---
Yeah, both machines are good for some things and bad for others, idk why people come in with the whole PC master race stuff. 
---
PS4 is where I play all my action/fighting/racing games. It’s also super fucking nice for streaming services. 
---
PC is where I play my shooters and strategy games.
---
I don’t want to play Siege on console just as much as I don’t want to play Need for Speed on PC. 
---
Also yes I’m aware you can connect a controller to a PC but as I don’t have an Xbone controller, I have to use third party software, easier to just get the games I want to play with a game pad on my console.
---
Access to photos tied to your name, company owned by the russians, Terms letting them use your picture however they deem fit.
---
You don't need a tinfoil hat to see where this is going.
---
Lmao this reminds me of a few weeks back I was in a 1v1 on fortress in the game room holding an angle on a door I was expecting entry from( I was in prone), guy walks behind me from vault walks over me looking for me, I knifes him in the back to win the match.
---
Exactly. I went 11 and 4 in the last game, but we lost in 8 because we had a teammate tk and leave in round 4.
---
Dang, congrats.  I’m at 97 and still don’t have them all.  I even played in ranked with a booster and the 1k+ renown didn’t get me much.
---
That 8$ you say its been free for years now.
---
Yes you can go on any server, one of the guys I play with worked out or found out how to do it and we have tested it regularly and it still works.
---
We are based on weu but play eus or the Asian servers as it resets your rank for each individual server. 
---
So if you can't hit gold/plat in the EU just head to US and try again.
---
First you get in your squad
---
The host then loads a custom game they have set up 
---
Go to the settings and select the server you want 
---
Save the custom game set up
---
Back out 
---
Hit ranked 
---
Will load into server saved in custom game 
---
After each match you have to do whole process again.
---
(Above is from memory but I will check and update later if required)
---
I remember back in the day when I still played console, Halo 3 was crazy toxic like that. You’d get TKd if you picked up the sniper cause some 11 year old wanted it. 
---
He’s not gonna get a kill with it but he’ll kill you for it.
---
Yeah because the pirated windows doesn't have the watermark lol
---
I'm 176 and still need dok and vigil
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they did something about tking. But there’s definitely a lot more they could do.
---
Downloading win10 and installing without the license is piracy regardless of if you downloaded it from a dodgy site or from the media creation tool
---
But you always have this damn watermark in the corner...
---
And honestly they should get the money for their program
---
Probably lost and won against hackers.
---
Well done!
---
Link to the leaks? I hadn't heard anything about the next ops
---
Feels like yesterday frost’s shotgun was broken. Man im old.
---
I can't beat the shit out of you without coming closer
---
I hope your grandpa doesn't use shock wires to punish when you were naughty hahaha.
---
There isn't an advantage. I play it off because I play some comp and I personally find it more enjoyable.
---
It's a straight disadvantage though.
---
Absolutely. It just hurts to know that we lost a game because we were outnumbered. Its just a helpless feeling when you are down 3-1 or 3-0 and knowing you can’t do anything even if you play great. There has to be something that could help when a teammate leaves
---
500 for year one, 10k for y2 and 15k for y3 then 25k for year 4. I think that's it. That's still alot of renown.
---
They had 4. He started the vote kick and everyone else voted yes. Then voted to kick him since they would only need 3 after they kicked his friend
---
Do what CSGO does and let there be a bot you can take over if you die. That always seemed to workout a little more than not having anyone at all.
---
I was introducing my newbie friend to siege when this happened
---
I just have loads of friends on PS4 and only one on pc so that's why. The experience on pc is much better but friends&gt;experience so...
---
Well, developers can't really do much about the players playing the game and flaming boye
---
*buys one Alfa pack*
---
Gets legendary duplicate 
---
*stonks*
---
My friend uses red dot suppressor and angled grip and he does better when he uses that.
---
I usually play in a 4 stack and I still manage to get that one shitter.
---
Perhaps Instead of the moment the tap “quit game” they stay still trying to reconnect (like a WiFi search) for 10 seconds? 
---
They also need to make voluntary quits much more penalizing
---
Tap on your name and then it says change flair. There you can change it to your preference.
---
and yes you have found the mobile user.
---
As a hobby-developer myself I can understand that. Take your time. Shall I DM you my email for further correspondence?
---
This should be from the opposite angle
---
Ubi Fix it, i suppose
---
We don't have a lot of situational ops, when warden works he fucking works but he relies on the attackers to make the first move. I like the idea of not all ops being great picks for all situations, especially if Ubi want to get to the 100 ops mark, not all ops are gonna be useful in ALL situations, which is okay. Situational makes for cool moments
---
I like that idea. Or he only gets 3 pings, and footprints are only visible for 30 seconds
---
Lmao, 5 days later I realize this is a Katana Zero/Cyperpunk meme. I'm a dumbass.
---
But the skin doesn't look cool when the only "cool" parts can't even be seen in game....
---
:thinking meme:
---
I'm level 90 and still not very good hahaha
---
I can imagine doc saying that in his elite victory screen lol
---
But we can still call each other mother fuckers, dick suckers, etc etc. I just don't like banning a word like that just because people will be mean with it. It treats the community like kids in a M rated game. Give us the ability to chat mute individuals on the enemy team. And if they get too many reports they get a chat ban. That would discourage toxic chat and stop people from doing work arounds where they are still saying mean stuff. Banning certain words just makes people keep coming up with work arounds. Let the players who are interacting be the judge of that.
---
And maybe attackers can use drones, lion uses his ability cz his drone is still there.. etc.. so I agree with you: the idea is absolutely orribile
---
your friend doesn't know anything about nothing . But if you want operators . Buy them with the renown you got from the situations
---
Margo is a *^(fucking)* **GOD**
---
Well we need to ban the hackers faster or determine they’re hacking because battle eye isn’t doing anything. For Example the youtuber mister homeless was TRYING to be banned and it took awhile
---
***It also just happened to be on Consulate***
---
sure
---
Kinda ironic how my first legendary duplicate is my banana charm, talk about getting fucked.
---
Give the m417 a twenty round mag if you want people to stop using the f2
---
God damn y’all are all mad retarded leave each other alone
---
No red dot is to chunky and takes up to much of the screen
---
Instead of running away, you're coming right to me?
---
What rank are u on console
---
Weird flex but okay
---
That video gave me a major laugh . i wish i just saw that falling doc
---
You saw her when you killed her on the stairs?
---
I had this happen playing cav the sec i shot final bullet for the last kill
---
Mid Silvers and Low Golds. Barely any skill gap
---
I’m not using the commando the fire right is poo poo
---
No u
---
With marinara sauce?
---
It’s because the barrel is a banana
---
Or maybe something similar to Dead By Daylight. You get rated on certain objectives you do. For example Bronze/Silver/Gold rating for objective time, frags, intel, round won. Based on how many points you accumulate you get a notch. 3 notches and you rank up. But also you have to lose 3 notches you rank down. So your rewarded for your own performance and not punished for having a sloppy team... idk...
---
N O B O D Y CAN STOP ME
---
Before they do maybe they should fix matchmaking cause I've got 10 abandons because ubi dced me and would connect me to a new match instead
---
Shoutout to my teammate who started recording at the perfect moment.
---
1000 times better than normal bandit elite

The reddit seige community is large.

Where else should I have posted my amazing thought?

Do we have his reddit account name
---
That aim made me cringe so hard
---
69 hours ? nice
---
Jokes aside . Try to find a squad who could help you getting out of that copper hell
---
I saw a clip where people used frost traps against this sort of hack, but geez that really sucks
---
Lmao alright
---
My man bandit out here looking like santa claus.
---
Came here to say the same thing
---
Why is she holding saiga?
---
Yesyessyesysyes
---
u/russianbadger
---
The thing makes the gun like 2x as long, gives away her position soooo badly.
---
Looks like automated recoil control?
---
That's what you get for playing casual.
---
That setup looks hella comfy.
---
Now they need to add this as a new game on Hypixel or something
---
You’ll shoot your eye out, kid.
---
I love you fellow badger fan
---
Thanks bro. Are you playing alone or with squad?
---
the FMG is miles better than the MPX tho. it actually has "decent" TTK. while the MPX TTK much worse. yet no one talks about one of the truly aweful guns in the game. the 9mm C1 is one of the worst automatic weapons when it comes to TTK. only cavs smg is worse, but her real primary is the lusion.
---
The only two things that have given me happiness: Minecraft and R6 Siege
---
Clash isn't even as bad as Monty
---
Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but neckshots are headshots and have been since Red Crow.
---
Can you imagine the recoil on a deagle, with an acog.
---
Big smoke
---
This is really well made.
---
She can run with her gadget activate though.
---
Do you mean remove the glitching effect while running?
---
Oh shit monty main! Mostly our team banned Monty. Hahaha thanks btw!
---
After 2 years you have noticed gratz!
---
I think it does, in Buck's Assault Rifle and Maverick's M4 I think increases the recoil but the damage stay much longer
---
I am generally the one who die like that
---
Mav'n'cheese
---
On the other hand it would make sense for him to be a hard fragger because iirc that was always Ubis intent for the spetznaz ops, to be played ass aggressive kill-focused operators. 
---
All their gadgets revolve around trying to help get kills.
---
Or the points that barely make a difference in renown they really should make it a set value if you win or lose
---
It's amazing how you made this like king of the hill with just body language and a slight art style
---
muzzle is pretty good on a lot of weapons but I get where they're coming from
---
I could see that happen and I feel like she would be quite strong but not totally op and it would force people to use barbed wire and watch their flanks because they can’t trust the cams
---
U can easily counter clash compared to Monty
---
Lmao XD
---
Yeah it was a joke cause every time something like this is posted people say it was a neck shot but they count as headshots to
---
Now that's some great OC!
---
Yeah this game needs a lot of help. toxicity alone is insane. I've been like targeted by the other team for toxicity for no reason. Punishments are lackluster as are the updates and patches for console, and cheater prevention for PC. No idea how bad hacking is on console but I would assume its better than PC.
---
Looks clean AF but is this a urinal or toilet? 
---
j/k!  Nice work!
---
Oh I’m sorry my mistake I see now
---
Same I would have ran into it and realised it was a claymore to late
---
le german man zoom scope lol xD
---
Very impressive
---
Man,this is the best R6 post i've ever seen,congrats from Russia!
---
So I'm no pro either, but these moments were too stupidly funny not to share. The first clip is long, but it gets snappy afterwards. I couldn't think of a good outro, so I've just dumped a voice-chat-based derp :)
---
No same with frost mats
---
High Quality shit. Good job.
---
Very creative! I like it😄👍
---
Yeah but we have to deal with mouse and keyboard f*gs. And since ubi dont give two shits about console we basically dont even have the solice in knowing that reporting them *MIGHT* do somethimg
---
Wow. Banning Monty. My congratulations is getting revoked.
---
Ok then don’t use it. You don’t know what load outs are good or you until you try them all on different guns.
---
not really 200 IQ but nice anyways
---
Also it’s impossible to hack on a console ever since thw Xbox 1 and ps4 came out
---
Did you start playing 2 weeks ago?
---
I don't know how to even get any flair
---
Hello aquaguy120, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cfat6x/check_the_rook_p90_clip/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Cav is not worth anymore, usable but not for ranked 
---
Jackal is worth it but the problem is that he is prob gonna get a fat nerf sooner or later
---
Damn you're about to get all the karma son
---
I have donated all I have in silver. For this masterpiece.
---
not even close baybeee
---
some pros/high level players explained this a while ago, I looked it up when i bought frost
---
- in like 95% or more scenarios, it doesn't effect shots to kill. 
---
- in a lot of scenarios, you give away your position by the incredibly long model of your gun
---
so it's better to use nothing than EB.
---
That's some quality content, well done.
---
Guess that was your Luck for the Next couple months lol

I couldn’t agree more

If you could throw them on the end of a spear, yes, otherwise no

I don’t have any of these ops but I’d get alibi

You clearly main her then cuz God damn if play against her she is the most aggravating thing on this planet

ORA ORA ORA ORA

Maestro
---
You should go play Monty or Clash in ranked then, and if it gets down to 1v2 just stop playing and see how that goes down with the teammates.
---
shut
---
Nice.
---
Same with his bro Bozon Bunch
---
Depending on who els you play with alabi you need to be a good roamer with maestro you got be a good with camera placements and with clash you can't get lucky with her
---
Bazooka time

Did anyone even ask? Jeez why does everyone have to be so negative.
---
Can I learn this power?
---
Thanks dude. Helped
---
Haha. Either in a hurry or had a stroke.
---
Nice editing.
---
i dont play the game really since maestro came out (maybe once a week?). and its a team based game, i often play with guys who are silver or even copper but i dont care. we have fun playing together and i am not a tryhard that cares about his rank. i know guys that are plat and even diamond but play like gold3. i gave up caring about my rank years ago. again.. its a team based game, your rank doesnt show your skill
---
There's these fucking indian kids yesterday in ranked tking me when i had 0 kills the next match few matches i got 4 kills and an ace and promptly almost commited suicide on how annoying kids are. Why aren't the playing fortnite? Jesus christ.

I envy you. I tried to do that but caved and bought year two ops just so i wouldn’t get kicked for picking an op that the team didn’t find suitable. I bought all my year 1,3, and 4 ops with renown that I earned though.
---
and if you do that save all the packs you get until then. should be a nice lil pack opening. otherwise save for next ops or get headgears/uniforms/skins
---
Macie Jay came out with a new video about Ying tips a week ago. https://youtu.be/jAttthg_BqM
---
I wen't back to look at the transition frame by frame, bravo sir, bravo!
---
nice
---
That was dope
---
Lol tbh, if I didn't have an Xbox One X and a 4K TV, I wouldn't have been able to see that guy :) I literally just saw that pixel go from white to black
---
r/SubsIFellFor

r/suddenlyYoda does exist, though
---
Steve and Alex operators confirmed
---
This entire post was just a diamond humble brag lmao
---
Start to learn room names on each map and use cardinal directions for stairs and hallways (ex. east stairs).
---
a copper guy can be at least plat in a week if he plays with 4 diamonds in his team. and a diamond guy can get to gold maybe even silver if he plays with 4 copper guys you understand ? your rank depends 70% on your team 10% on ubis matchmaking and 20% on your skill
---
thanks! we all thought we lost since my friend didn’t plant and there were still 2 ppl left
---
Yeah but it’s also in combination with her being 3-speed and her utility being simple enough for the newest player to understand and effective in its job. An overpicked operator is harmful to the meta.
---
It’s the same situation with pre-nerf Ela and Jager.
---
Scorpion(Mira’s vector rival) with 50 bullets and no recoil PLUS having a gadget that told attackers to put the mouse and controller down PLUS being a 3-speed WITH impacts. I love Ela (my most played def OP by far) and looking back, she was fucking broken. 
---
Jager is in that situation where he’s 99% mandatory to a def. The 416-C (R4-C rival) plus one of the best gadgets in the game plus being a 3-speed. His alternate in Warden is laughably bad since Kaid is actually a decent alternate to Bandit. He’s not broken but something needs to happen before it becomes a “who do we pick alongside Jager”.

Oh I see now. What a bad change ! Before it was great.
---
So jäger shot rook, which activated RFF and kill them both?
---
I do some stuff on console that has gotten accused of wall hacking, like prefiring random shit that sometimes people hold angles on and getting kills it sometimes happened multiple times a game so I can see why it looks sus as fuck sometimes
---
Fucking beautiful work.
---
eciN
---
So thats what thats called
---
Shoutout to the guy who actually bought the Doc elite
---
not sure but that probably makes the most sense yea
---
i believe they do care about their console players but it’s much harder to change stuff due to it having to be verified by sony and microsoft
---
TnT the villager
---
I play on PC and tbh I wouldn’t have even been able to see if a board was *broken*. It’s less about how well ur screen is and more of how well you can focus.
---
mwhahaha, Im glad my meticulous frame by frame editing paid off. Thank you!
---
The ineffective fire might be a bit better now that they greatly reduced his damage falloff
---
I’m not sure 🤔 But I am thinking about making a YouTube channel!
---
One time i was playing on club house and decided to play cav, thermite ran right past me even though i was extremely visible not even in cover and he just walks right by me. I was very confused.
---
Idk if ur just like taking it from get flanked but this is basically his ideas
---
Lmao I’m dead!
---
Give this more upvotes dammit
---
&gt; Funny how you actually dig into someone else's profile for a comment 
---
When you call someone a kid who doesn't think every gun that kills him isn't op yet wants to buff an operator that historically was very difficult to balance, then yes I can't help but point out the double standards. Sorry I took you seriously.
---
&gt;  what an actual loser. 
---
Again, I'm not the one drooling over fictional characters.
---
Who
---
Ok?
---
I’m new to the game, what operators have this gun?
---
👏👏
---
Basically once people started banning him, everyone else assumed there was a good reason
---
The part they didnt realize was that roamers can't multitask and like to waste their team bans
---
Valk is one of the most universal ops so that'd be a good idea imo
---
Need more info about play style, type of guns you like, etc.
---
Oh look, there he is
---
Ok well I think that I agree except everyone should be able to see the ping
---
Aw maaaaaaaaaan
---
It took me 20 times to find where it transitions to Minecraft the 1st time. Can’t find the 2nd time
---
Good meme man and also good tip be careful of Mira's and treat them like a player is behind them at all times
---
Oh wow, this is high quality content. I'll have to sub /r/Rainbow6 since it seems they finally started allowing the best content here.
---
Yes indeed. The meme himself
---
🤡🤡🤡
---
I dropped 9-4-2 once and got tk'd and teabagged so
---
Nokk sucks, and asians are supperior. Get ying.
---
Should I save up for someone else with my remaining renown?
---
Theyre still gonna get banned all the time.
---
In retrospect, pick and ban was a dumb idea
---
I want that mod
---
Wow, thats Kinda Epic.
---
Love those transitions
---
Maestro is really good too
---
We don't give a shit if rainbow is easy they're just joking you 12 year old

In the distance:

---

---
yeah, that'd be a pretty good idea.
---
I found mine on a YouTube channel called grieffdrums  or something has footstep profiles etc etc, just search on YouTube and you should find it
---
Better yet lets just remove their guns cause if they can kill people they’re “op”
---
I couldnt even play thats my point
---
Not their usual, repost. I may join you.
---
I'll do good with any gun I have at hand and I can play any playstyle that I need too. Basically just need to know which one is more superior
---
Dude we're down voting you because you're in the wrong sub
---
Girl love my dick whoops
---
Ok.
---
It’s the most annoying thing ever. I can’t hit diamond this season because every time I get 3 games in I face a dosser
---
Impacts or nitrocells work wells along with traps and Smoke. If you don’t have any of these getting someone to flank behind them usually works.
---
Glad you did minecraft not some other game...
---
I wish I still had the patience to make a map that detailed and accurate.
---
Yea I feel the same but then I don’t care about it being competitive and super balanced.
---
It means it has been hacked by vigil
---
You put in a lot of time to make this and thats what I appreciates about ya.
---
Well its like looking out a window of a moving vehicle like a car. If you look into the distance you seem to go quite slowly (which represents low fov) but if you look at things that are closer to the car, it seems like you're going a lot faster. And when you have a high fov, you can see more around you, which seems to move faster.
---
Oi fokin rite we arnt
---
Just got my first plat II.
---
Thanks for shouting my name in this post! Maybe I'll get my credits someday!
---
It has to do with your perception of movement. There is no benefit to switching you POV besides a wider viewing angle.
---
Yatch? What is yatch?
---
Thanks!!
---
Ah I see. So its normal?
---
I don't like these maps.
---
Sit the f*ck down Clash I’m here to spill the real tea
---
you have no clue about siege
---
you think you can judge players by their rank. you dont know that its a team based game. so it actually doesnt even matter what you think. i bet you are that kind of player who starts crying when he has to do something in order to win. i instead, want to help my team i dont care if they are gold copper or something else. thats the difference between us
---
Yea
---
True, but usually I face pretty bad Montys, so I haven't had any good Monty players, suprisingly. Either get stuck in a corner or die too early.
---
Super new to the game, was playing newcomer playlist, apparently "reinforced the wrong wall" got TKd by someone who was admittedly smurfing. Now, I understand that doing a bad job reinforcing can hurt the team, but I feel newcomer playlist should be a place to, ya know, learn the game, not get TKd by someone who's played a shit ton, and decided to Smurf out of boredom
---
I think Microsoft is doing pretty good.
---
Although I'm literally laughing my ass off after that round, the video didn't record my microphone and nobody in my team screamed, so yeah it's all cool.
---
No screams

Really? Realism? Very real when I shoot someone point blank in their unprotected face and they don't even go down.

Then leave, this pretty much never happens in ranked, and if it does, i guarantee you are playing under at least gold 4

I assumed him and his friend were 2 of 5. Leaving only 3 of them.

The Chinese are notorious for ripping off IP from companies too. They require foreign companies to partner with a domestic company- setting up easy IP theft. I wonder if it's just a "do whatever it takes to win" culture.

For an abandon you get a loss, 15 min queue ban and 30 min renown decrease. But I agree it’s not enough of a punishment in general but since the last patch you are unable to rejoin matches if you left so they should fix that instance first
---
I like them, they help
---
Classic doesn’t have acceleration iirc but updated does, I prefer classic because I have the same speed all the way through my movements
---
We need to complete our fireteam then.
---
he is talking about in-game report.  
---
Anyways, Ubi wont do anything.
---
Ash is one of the quick ass rabbits.
---
Yes and No.
---
A new game does allow for a new purchase and additional monetization, that's a fact.
---
A new game also allows for different mechanics and balancing that may not be possible in the current siege engine.
---
Keeping it as an R6 extension rather than a totally new IP let's them keep the established characters and build the franchise off of these characters.
---
Absolutely not we want to reduce the ability to gamble not make it far worse.
---
Have mods gone to far?
---
I really hope he gets banned. Also the team he was boosting.
---
What the fuck is this gilding
---
That's when I use a nitro to kill us all.
---
That guy must have such an amazing gaming chair, he's so good, look at that skill, acing on his own (yes, it's irony)
---
I think it's a fairly interesting idea.
---
All the people who are crying about how game-breaking this would be as a spawn peek tool are disregarding their drones, and the fact that warden can't use his gadget at 100% unless he stands still.
---
Maybe this guy is ready to spend money to gold this post a shit ton
---
Ela scorpion with compensater and angled
---
This is just trash.
---
Get good.
---
Him and his friend were 2 of 5. There were only 3 randos. You must have missed read the part where he said he initiated the vote to kick on his friend. Then the 3 randos voted. So really it was his fault
---
My one question: is it normal to suck this badly at level 58? Provided, I did used to just mess around and TK with my friends for the early days.
---
With randoms in ranked. Thermite on border attacking armory.
---
This is an expanded version of the game mode and do you really want to add another 30 or more gigabytes to the regular game’s size
---
That's hot.
---
Can you do gridlock?
---
you can't give yourself awards so this guy's really gotta be trying hard
---

I got tk for not going all recruit, I hate this community

I was playing old Hereford on Xbox. I was using Vigil and everyone just pushed me like a moron. I barely had to move
---
Echo ones real cute :)
---
I second this becaus the game is already like 70 gigs
---
Last night after playing on and off for last few years I got my first ace on Villa, was my first match first round on attack trying to place on ranked. Was nervous going into placements but I aced first round. Unfortunately I peaked too soon apparently and ended up getting slapped for the rest of the 9 games. Placed in Silver II though so....🤷🏽‍♂️
---
It’s absolutely fake and the nature of the post makes it especially concerning.
---
Defense, Maverick. The resort place, enemies where in kitchen. I used his semi auto
---
You still need an adapter which will cost you upwards of $100, just plugging in a mouse and keyboard won't work on console.
---
Oh god that aim
---
True
---
didn't know you could fake awards
---
M E A T Y
---
hence "this guy's gotta be trying hard"
---
He even removed it. I think he is messing with Reddit or something or exploiting in some way how Reddit works.
---
Yep, and looks like it’s already removed
---
Love this my girl would.
---
1. I don’t think he needs a nerf, but he does certainly need help, and then based on how the other operator is balanced down the line, and if Jager still has a high pick rate then they can think about a nerf for him. 
---
2. I never understood why each ads only destroys 2 throwables. There are so many operators in this game that can burn them easily. If you make it 3 instead, it would force more IQ, twitch, and thatcher counter play instead of an ash throwing in 2 flash bangs. Might make him too strong, but if he’s the only one it makes sense to me until they add in another one.
---
Well you're a diamond that consistently top frags... If I didn't know any better...
---
Which ones your favorite?
---
House and plane aren’t all that bad
---
All of what you just said applies to the current version of castle, that's why he only has three of his barricades.

Id love a nursing home objective, everyone moves 1/8 speed and shoot spit at each other from their toothless mouths.
---
House is shit
---
r/gaming
---
They’d probably appreciate too
---
you can't remove your own posts, only thing he could do is delete it and then it'd say deleted. a mod took it down
---
You can fake peoples moving faces now this is by no means surprising.
---
Yep. This is why we need a global rank. To discourage people from region swapping and throwing just to get into low ranks
---
A slow push forward is always a strong option. Moving towards your opponent will often cause them to panic a bit, making it easier to go for a kill or let your teammates get a kill
---
Everytime I make Mac and cheese this always goes through my head
---
With event skins that you could use in the rest of the game. That would be so fun!
---
Bruh don't lie noone on reddit has a girl it's in the TOS it's a sacrifice we all have to make to use the app. Smh my head people out there lying ngl

BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD

Not that I'm special.. I'm sure others are getting them, but what is the requirement? None of my friends have gotten one, just stats in an email. This is my third one.

You’re trash. Change my mind.

That's what I'm trying to say.  Sorry if I expressed it badly

Whoever you main

I don’t know about ps4 but for Xbox I got a year 3 bundle

Nomad on Favela (the middle floor site) with the AK
---
Please give me reasons why house is shit. Good Secure sites. Good for Custom Games and only 3 real spawnpeek spots. Kitchen to river docks. Master bedroom to APC and front door or big window to construction. Side street can barely be peeked.

Whaaaaaaat

Well, he wants them to be banned for the season, we dont have that yet, bet yeah we've got the general idea

I think it’s a great idea. Could be a great thing to add too with caveria,
---
“First time using Ash”
---
“Ash main”
---
This is amazing holy shit
---
I thought I was the only one who used the AK, everyone I know uses the ARX
---
Just to kill
---
And squaded up with rest of them being coppers dont forget.

I'll take one, please.

Well thank you. I do feel superior.

---
She should have ample time to switch in a reasonable situation. Her role is to help get frags, not to frag. In a 1v5, Clash shouldn't win.
---
region?
---
People don't appreciate Fuze enough. One of the best assault rifles on offense, one of the best (imo) LMGs, and the shield (eh?) to boot.
---
Also has the PMM.
---
His gadget is pretty "meh", but it's good for catching unsuspecting people on objectives.
---
And if only reporting people actually did anything.
---
*rank*
---
Mozzie
---
First guy has absolute terrible aim. How does he lose a gunfight when you had your back against him in point blank range
---
Pretty much this.
---
Even better is the followup comments of like "dude don't get so mad it's just a game, I'm just messing with you, why you gotta be so butthurt about it" etc etc
---
“Toxicity” I was insta banned as I joined a match
---
Why did they organize it like that tho
---
Exactly what I thought. At first I thought he tried to sledge hammer me because he was so close, but then when I rewatched it I saw he shot at me before I even turned so I really don’t know
---
I have r4c and l85a2 so im cooler than you all
