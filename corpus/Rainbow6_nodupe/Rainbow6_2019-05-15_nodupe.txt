In my opinion, the best thing to do it put them in a special pool. They can only play with other known or suspected exploters/cheaters. This way they are none the wiser and cheaters play with cheaters which the honest players play with the honest players.

They have absolutely NO obligation to maintain the permanent and constant use of operators that are purchased with fake currency (and ya, even R6 credits are fake currency, even if you can only get them with real currency). They hold all rights to change, modify, add, or remove things deemed necessary (by them) for the state of the game.

there's an invisible IQ glitch now? wth is going on with this game
---
I wonder which server were u in.
---
I have my opinions on Ubisoft, as of their years on console but especially in the last 4 years or so about releasing games that have KNOWN issues even still in the beta. They've gone down quick in my mind because of these issues and then rushing to release their "next big game".. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

I mean just insta lock her then change last second. That's what i do when someone goes castle and completely bungles the objective.

what is the new friendly fire system on siege can someone pls tell me

Just leave the game, stupid

Man i hate it when people do this and then complain when you report them. "Its not hacking bro. Its just a glitch."

Oh, and let‚Äôs give the shotgun to a three-speed whose gadget is made to disorient and slow down attackers while we‚Äôre at it.
---
My pet peeve is when Kaids put there claws dead center in the middle of the reinforced walls, you provide no challenge for maverick when he has to look for the electro claw if they have no thatcher
---
You don't have the right to have access to each operator you paid for (with fake currency) forever. That's insane. Why do people keep saying this? If they decide to end the game and close the servers by the end of this year, they can.
---
Games shut down their servers temporarily for fixes quite often. That removes access to the game you PAID for... but it doesn't matter. Same goes with temporary disabling of operators. Hell, same goes with if they chose to permanently remove an operator like Lion.

That's for patches. A hotfix doesn't need that. I know Destiny is a game that frequently updates and fixes their game without having to go through platform approval every time.

Yeah but his gun is really good if you can manage the recoil and he can equip a shield and smokes
---
I haven't realized it yet. I love Fuze and he has my highest k/d I'm just never bothered by him when he's on the other team
---
ARE THOSE ACTUAL COMMS IN A RANKED GAME????

It's a server issue not a game breaking thing üòÇüòÇ
---
*‚ÄùBlinding trash get stomped by shotty‚Äù*
---
lmao
---
This game is so unbelievably broken at all times. How have invisible operators and shield bugs been in this game season after season?
---
Worst part is console players have no real system of reporting.
---
Ubisoft doesn't report back like Blizzard does with Overwatch reports. It's such a waste of time.
---
He shits on me almost every time I play and I don't usually run one of his hard counters besides sledge. I love his utility and his gun is an animal on top of a shotty secondary

Havent seen this on PS4 and I don't want to

I guess so.

Oh I do!

Yup.

Michael Tree Sauce doing the lords work

So many salty people in here üòÇ it's a game ffs. Server issues happen from time to time. Relax and play another game for a day or so until they fix it

Yeah he has potential to be pretty good but as a primarily solo player he's usually more harmful than useful

Stop being a fucking asshole, this post is entirely innocent and you‚Äôre being a bitch

Then at least put him in the middle cause you making my boi fuze look bad and he better than this

And you still get -10 despite he is the one placing his ADS on the electrified wall...

LOOKS COMPLETELY FAIR TO ME.

i completely agree, havent been on in a week, mind updating me on the situation?

No not really smurf
---
You must play select few characters then. There are only a handful of ops that can‚Äôt deal with him
---
It look likes stutters from high FPS, try update your v√≠deo driver, try v sync, if it stops, limit max fps in R6 confg file
---
Yeah I haven't figured that out yet. If I would put time into using him he'd bump up
---
It phased me for a little bit, but thanks. I‚Äôm gonna keep the post up, but I‚Äôm still gonna play the game normally, I‚Äôm just gonna have a ‚Äúlittle bit‚Äù more hatred for Clash. Thanks though.

I hope you get common capitao headgear duplicates

Where would I go to do that?

I think they‚Äôd be fine as long as they just used it reference your use of penis
---
Headset &amp; motherboard (or whatever audio output you use)?  
---
Are you using the same ingame sound settings? TV/Night/Whatever the 3rd one is  
---
Are you using stereo settings or some BS surround garbage? You only have two drivers, so any kinda of surround is simulated and that can cause issues.
---
Still happening its not as bad as outbreak season last year but its starting to get there.
---
Ah yea I feel it. If someone needs glitches to get kills/enjoy the game they should probably play a different game lol
---
Okay thx

Shit

That's true smokes are really powerful and his AR is pretty good even though I love lmg's but I'd take Monty or Blitz over him if you want a shield op

I wouldn't disagree with that. I just haven't put the time in to figuring out her gun and I always lose my drones. I just don't think she's as useful as thatcher

Capitao should be 1-2 ranks higher, as a mid/high gold PC solo queue player, I make light work of attempted roamers using him, and there‚Äôs extra utility in the fact that for a bomb defuse, he can cover almost the entire plant with his bolts. I‚Äôd put him low B or high C.
---
What is half of 5 people?
---
My advice to you. Don‚Äôt make jokes to the Siege community, the entire community for some reason is insecure of their ability to play the game, so any time, and I mean any time they get the opportunity to put someone else down for being bad, they will. Most of the community are total pussies. They‚Äôre so afraid of losing their balls because they‚Äôre bad that they have to make others look bad. That goes for a lot of these comments. People need to get over their damn egos.
---
I just get dumped on constantly by Maestro and Lion isn't good for a solo player like me
---
Maybe not
---
Ran into the clash glitch yet?
---
Yeah, he certainly begs team play. I've seen a castle barricade with a frost mat and a kapkan wire more than once. But with a competent team, he's definitely a force.
---
Okay. I'm on PC. I haven't seen it, and I've tried to doing it for 20 minutes in custom games (not to actually use it, just to see if it still exists) and it doesn't seem like it does.

Sorry if I seemed aggressive
---
I just played 3 casuals and every round had a cheater. All I could do was try to pick clash and switch off so they couldn‚Äôt or being impacts and try and destroy the shields.
---
Ubisoft is letting their game go to shit. Its a shame.
---
for those encountering the clash glitch, you can report them directly (preferably with video clip proof) through customer report since it's breaking the code of conduct "Use of third-party hacking, cheating or botting clients.". Since the clash bug is an unintended mechanic and gives an unintended advantage through use of an exploit, I'm pretty sure it falls under the category of cheating

Looks more like a gimp to me.

As the man with few words mute I approve this

Yup same here man! Just entered 3 consecutive Ranked matches with this glitch (i only lost 30 Ranked points) i just can't seem to enter a match without this bullshit...
---
I heard the new op makes no sound. As a cav main, I would empty my pockets for this shit. I fucking love stealth. I'm so excited.
---
Please no. I just t bagged and sat there. Shot at the sun. 0 kills. Let them kill me. I did it once in casual, to see if I even could. I dont want to be temp banned for letting someone kill me
---
I knew someone would say it XD
---
Except it's not like these issues have existed since the beginning. They fixed it, and the bugs just came back. It has been a few days and they're fixing it for us. The reason this happens, is because they're still adding content to this game.
---
I was bronze-ish prior to OP health, so I didn't have terrible wait times, I do remember 5-8 minute queue times for casual back then.

Well to be fair you kinda are, cause you are reposting the instagram post

Haha!  I love how you just watch hopelessly.

Console or PC?

The opposing team was Clash and Deployable Shield glitching every defense round. Super toxic too, as you might imagine. They know they can't get banned for it so what's to stop them?
---
The app doesn‚Äôt recognize him either
---
She's S tier because of the facking glitch
---
Was that in casual?
---
This is true.   
---
For clarity - I would not expect the 'automatic' system to deal with this.   
---
You can actually submit user reports to Ubisupport. They will investigate the accusation and if they are 100% positive that cheating took place then action is taken (and the person who submitted the report gets a 24 hour reknown bonus pack).   
---
Simple - If more than 1 glitching support ticket is submitted within a timeframe (or over multiple games) - then this person is doing the glitch intentionally to ruin others gaming experiance or gain an advantage. Week ban (or whatever action Ubi decides is suitable). This way the person who does it unintentionally - all good.
---
Awesome!
---
yes
---
Oof

It's all good but I was thinking you might have had a lower end gpu with not enough vram to handle siege but a 1080ti is plenty for siege. maybe try turning vsync off if tou havent already
---
That‚Äôs why you have zofia. She can shoot her grande at her. Then the shield gets lifted. Or maverick can burn a hole in a wall in that hallway so it‚Äôs sideways. Then it‚Äôll kill her.
---
So 1 guy whose a little bit better than everyone else gets a ton of kills but he is actually still a noob, and he‚Äôs just going against the Worlds worst players, then gets banned for doing better than the worlds worst players. There‚Äôs some flaws with your recommendation.
---
Not mine
---
Ah
---
Amazing Job!
---
I wasn't the one play tachanka, watch the vid
---
Not saying it's your fault, but why not just stop playing ranked after encountering the glitch for the first time instead of queuing up again?
---
same lol I'm all hyped up because I've been playing for a couple hours
---
If someone used the glitches in ranked is it technically cheating?
---
Old and re purposed driving engine is the key word there

I just instinctively wanted to turn off my xbox while looking at this pic

Gotta show my sauce my dude

It is absolutely still in the game. Played 4 matches in a row just now. Every. Single. One had a Clash bulletproof shooting through their shield or an invisible IQ. Every single round. Game is unplayable. This is on PC in high plat. I just want to play the game I paid for. It is infuriating that support said they WILL NOT BAN ANYONE USING THESE EXPLOITS.
---
Damn it man why you gotta do me like that ;-;

Your just a toxic asshole

As an spanish speaker, to simplify:

Yes, Mira means ‚ÄúLook‚Äù but it also means sight (as in the gun‚Äôs, not the sense of vision).

IS SHE MASTURBATING... VALK WTFUCK
---
&gt;Why can't they just put pick and ban in?  Let us ban them and they can take their time. Everyone wins
---
Anyone with a deployable shield can do the shield exploit. You can only ban 1 defender per team in pick &amp; ban.

I love this concept and I hear it all the time. My team is bad because I had 48 kills and they had 1 each. Like??? No shit?! It's fucking math, why are you mad - this is not CoD.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
The biggest issue I've seen is clash so if this fixes 2 out of 3 game breaking glitches I'm still happy
---
I'm not justifying it, they do need to fix their fucking software considering this has happened time and time again, I'm just talking about what the support staff who have nothing to do with coding could do in the meantime.

I'd much rather have the option to use a still picture background. I really dislike that the GPU ramps up to 100% usage just sitting in the menu.

Because the typical response for doing something you ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù is an apology you half wit. Any half way well mannered individual would apologize and carry on without a word. So yes, you can be blamed for baiting them, if you weren‚Äôt you wouldn‚Äôt kick them for saying sorry.

BO4 actually does have predictable recoil patterns for the record, it was talked about at launch a ton by the devs and is demonstrably there.
---
Those aspects have never ever been a focus for COD and a majority of the playerbase doesnt care. So congrats on using an argument that's been relative since Bad Company 2 I guess.
---
I don't give a shit if COD looks or sounds real. If it plays like COD and has interesting weapons with good map design that's all that matters. 
---
I can play maybe 20 minutes of BFV and get bored. The MP is all the same no matter the mode, nobody does a damn thing they're supposed to about OBJ. Campaign is a one and done 4 hour adventure that nobody played. The co-op mode actually feels like it's dead.
---
BO4 MP can keep me entertained with shit like Infected, Prop Hunt, and barebones TDM. Blackout is wildly different from MP and is an amazing change of pace for COD. That also has Alcatraz as an entire separate ( albeit smaller) map to play on. 
---
Zombies is zombies. Round based survival with 5 maps already and we still have 2 maps to go with each map varying in difficulty and characters you play as.
---
BFV is always the same boring and sluggish no-named soldier that nobody gives 2 shits about. No matter the mode.

Because it doesn't affect the amount of mmr you win or lose.

They ban who abuses exploits, it's not Instant obviously, you can't pretend the ban 1 second after your report. Give them a few hours or a day/2 days. It's been like this since the start. :)

The MMR is updated solely on the outcome of your match. If this outcome is unexpected (for example, you lost against players with a lower skill than your team), the skill updates will be more substantial, and vice-versa. In addition to that, the more confident we are about your skill (i.e., if your œÉ is low), the smaller the updates will be.
---
* Result of the match
---
* Your skill uncertainty 
---
* Expected result 
---
Nothing else affects the mmr update, Getting 30 kills, winning 4-0 or surrendering will not affect your mmr update.

Right, but I'm not the idiot who started with that. Your previous comment is just bashing 1 typo when the irony is you don't know what an apostrophe is.
---
Hey can you guys like fucking roll it out? I thought ranked was unplayable before but it‚Äôs actually literally unplayable right now.
---
Someone can‚Äôt catch clear sarcasm
---
Did you just give the procedure to do the invisibility glitch?
---
Really not a fan
---
And remove favella, like, from the game code. Scrap that shit completely.
---
Jokes on you, he's probably an orphan.
---
I‚Äôve stayed off of ranked since the first time I encountered the Clash glitch on Sunday. Even casual is flooded with Clash glitching and shield glitching. I‚Äôm still yet to encounter the IQ glitch though, thankfully.
---
Yes
---
Why does she look like the American version of gridlock?
---
Fuck this game until it‚Äôs patched than.
---
‚ÄúRebellions are built on hope‚Äù
---
Nope way more to it bud, but I‚Äôm not gonna share that
---
Thanks
---
Do not fuck the game my friend. CD holes are too small for that
---
Hostage is the best game mode
---
Same. Although not as bad as this clip, I got teamkilled for shooting a drone that was dancing with bandit.... like I get that drone friends are fun but a fking tk... cmon

Nice. That was my first ever legendary. Getting a charm is kind of annoying though because the only other legendaries I‚Äôve packed are ‚Äúfaded leather‚Äù for Jager and ‚Äúpassion‚Äù for Mira. I suck at playing Mira and I personally don‚Äôt like the faded leather, even though I‚Äôm a Jager main
---
Are you defending a totalitarian regime that tortures and kills innocent people for merely disagreeing with them or seeking the truth?
---
The devs saying yes to mouse would sorta fix the issue with adapters since people can go out and get a mouse and keyboard for less than a controller so if they wanted to play even then they could
---
I tried to record a clip once and went into a corner and got 1 nice frost trap to my walking hands
---
Sixge is unplayable
---
Everyone on PS4 is doing the Clash and shield glitch in casual and ranked. I haven‚Äôt seen any IQ‚Äôs tho
---
Good. Thank you.
---
Classic.
---
That's awesome. That's one of the charms I want, along with the doge. Last night I got three legendaries in a row.. for Mira. The "passion" uniform, "raid leader" headgear and "rose thorn" weapon skin. I was stoked.
---
Yes, I am.
---
Idk is it even reasonably possible to hack in alpha packs to a large amount of other people‚Äôs accounts? Surely that kind of thing would take long enough to where you‚Äôd be banned way before you actually succeeded in a major way
---
Means you need doom slayer /rdoom
---
Don't, your connection will be sad.
---
compensator if you have good gun skill because it will make it a 3 shot most of the time
---
Do Kapkan Traps trigger?
---
nope
---
its weird cause some people say they do and some say they dont
---
I would assume so but haven't seen it first hand.
---
good lad. sad people do glitches like this to ruin the game. dbl online is responsible
---
The LMG is better
---
fun, but if i‚Äôd be the hostage i‚Äôd be dead in no time knowing my friends

We need a Siege 2 built from the ground-up.
---
There‚Äôs always something broken in this game. Ubi, please.
---
"The system is working as intended"
---
Nice! Thanks
---
i found black ice for german shotgun 4 times already and i only have 4 black ices
---
Wow. This stupid guy recorded himself and his team abusing the game breaking exploits.  I hope he gets banned on xbox as well as from rb6
---
That means my team is not shit
---
Not playing til it's fixed. That's all
---
He left me like an idiot :V
---
I never ORDER them to not do something, I always go "I wouldn't do that if I were you, he might come around" or so on, never; "Don't do that you retard."
---
Love u Carl
---
Well I'm glad I'm not playing the game anymore because not only are the glitches are just FUCKED but the community is a toxic cesspool that will stagnate the player base and YES IM GETTING HEATED BY JUST TALKING ABOUT IT IM'MA BEAT MEAT 
---

This idea seems to be popping up in every second persons mind, as this is the 4th(?)Suggestion about this type of operator.

Yes. Almost everyone has a mic connected to their PC to chat.

"Hello darkness my old friend...."
---
Analysing this fkn tweet
---
Even worse on console. I don‚Äôt think ubi can ban people on here.
---
If someone wants to know how to do it, they will seek out a detailed guide, which there are many of on YouTube because people are fucks. I know how to do this glitch, and this clip really wouldn‚Äôt tell someone how to do it.
---
Lmao, the abandon penalty I just got for leaving the match is more of a punishment than they‚Äôll give anyone using these glitches. GG, Ubi, see you next season.
---
Well, that was an unintentional easterg egg of the clip XD
---
Console of-course :)

Whats this IQ glitch? I heard about the shield glitch but what can IQ do?

The only thing I don't like about the skin is his face/head, looks like the pure stereotype of a biker where I'd prefer if they made him look like his mugshot. Plus over all it feels lazy, like they just slapped BB and Pulse together to make it.
---
After that though I think it's one of the best, it's MVP animation is over the top in a good way and where the maps are is hilarious thinking of the effort to get the bike to those spots.
---
Well you can do it in game atm, but i think there will be updates to it in the future so that people get banned for being toxic and what not
---
The best part is, you are Bandit.
---
You know what they say about doing the same thing over and over?
---
Theres a glitch on ps4 where walls and barricades are destroyed for some players but fully intact for others so you just see someone phase through a fully barricaded door or wall
---
I always get those teammates, I hate them, and I hate this matchmaking
---
and?????
---
How?
---
Play with 2 or more people. Can‚Äôt get kicked if you don‚Äôt have enough people to kick you.
---
You really are toxic.
---
Definitely a good thing that the banana has an actual ruler on it because the in game model is certainly not banana-sized
---
Almost broke my game disc yesterday. I refuse to play until this is fixed.
---
I don't think perm banning everyone is the solution, this will have to go case by case because some people abused it multiple times, some people wanted to see if it worked. I was the 1% who asked my team to tk me after I saw it work, then I got on my alt and tked everyone on my team who abused it and target a member of the enemy team if they abused it.
---
Agreed, Ubisoft needs to take a strong stance against the cheaters
---
Thanks! :)
---
Sorta good idea as iq is the most broken, but you still run the risk of getting banned even if you limit yourself to only killing the glitchers. Wouldn't risk it myself.
---
This is exactly what we need them to do right now.  It would be the quickest and simplest fix until they can resolve the issues properly.
---
*extremely weird noises of excitement*
---
I wish 100% of games had players willing to communicate and play at their best, but that doesn't happen. 
---
That's the problem with W/L rank systems is that with absolutely zero impact of player performance on your rank, you will lose games where you are playing better than the average (insert rank here) and be losing MMR.
---
No lol. Blackbeard can't shoot THROUGH his shield and 2 Blackbeard doesnt have an invisible shield so your logic is below 0.
---
Ye but statistically its an over average wep
---
&gt;playing hostage in ranked
---
crouch walking on secure area. id like to see you do it on a competitive game mode and not crouch walking
---
Yeah, My first game on in a while I get team killed then voted out, the siege community is just terrible. Ubisoft should be more harsh. Especially for people who abuse glitches.
---
Black ops 3 Black ops 4 type of menu üëå
---
Finally a good headgear for Lion to combo with season pass uniform!
---
If ubi finds proof that people abuse glitches they will ban them for cheating. In that case yes you‚Äôll get your elo back. But if they can‚Äôt find the evidence they need nothing will happen.
---
Is there something wrong with them, you seem very angry
---
Crouch walking is a crime now?
---
If its a moustache i think he is Dr.Disrespect...lol
---
Lol happens on pc ....
---
Yeah, I apparently had it happen to me last night. So, what I gathered, it's some type of teleportation glitch, she entered the objective multiple times but we could never see her, then she knifed/headshot all 5 of us, but the final killcam showed her still outside the building. AND this was on PS4.
---
MMMMMMM FKIN CLLLLASHH
---
Ive seen this reply multiple times but i see no such dots
---
it‚Äôs just a cheap way to play. getting killed by someone who made no sound is annoying as hell. also is usually a slow and ineffective way to play. you‚Äôll never see a pro do it
---
i see... i'm a gold 3 myself! ^(i pulled a little sneaky on ya) but it's just annoying to explain to those guys every time how the win delta works and that they should start playing ops that would help them with countering like kapkan with impacts and sasg 12 but they just scream yOuRe JuSt A sTuPiD nOoB gIt GuD
---
I was killed by this and made an oath I wouldn't come back until it was fixed
---
As a Jager main I can confidently say this is what I do in OBJ
---
We were 3 rounds in, and we were clearly gonna win, and then someone on my team decides to surrender, and everyone voted yes
---
Using the in game mechanics to get an advantage on an opponent is a crime now?
---
&gt; if you think games just don't have bugs
---
I said nothing about games not having bugs. You mentioned that. As a former software engineer I see a lot of crap here by that would have gotten many people fired.
---
Dev team is incredible? Not the way you mean it.
---
still didn‚Äôt say that it was. go use blitz lesion bb montagne and cav. the game allows you to do it, doesn‚Äôt means it‚Äôs not annoying
---
No, it‚Äôs just most bugs that I encounter don‚Äôt really bother me, but it‚Äôs glitches that effect players and could be used to make your team win.
---
you also just repeated a question i answered
---
You cannot get into play nowadays cos everyone there uses mnk. I wish it was bannable
---
Factssssssss
---
Speaking of this, anyone got any video with every operation intro/main menu? Would be very appreciated!
---
Excuse me it‚Äôs ‚ÄùJ√§ger‚Äù
---
&gt; will my team get a ELO conpesation like against cheaters, or/and the glicher (and his 5stack premade) gonna get banned

That's a big NO.

Take this China Censorship!

Sounds reasonable

I had multiple stories actually

How to say "would u sit on my face" in japanese?

Getting an ace in a game based on outthinking people, by outthinking them is a crime now?

I‚Äôve never had this challenge
---
It's google translated
---
Thanks. Ubisoft needs to more serious with operator bans and player bans, they need to permanently ban more often other than 30 minutes, 1 hours, etc bans. It would be annoying but it would help out casual players by getting rid of toxic players for a good while. (Most likely not gonna happen) some players might learn a lesson (cheesy as fuck ik) but yeah glitch abusers are dickheads and cunts.
---
Thanks brutha
---
I wanna screen shot this and send it to ubi cuz that‚Äôs actually really smart but I‚Äôd change it to closer to 30 seconds when the round starts.
---
I thought u're native speaker
---
The way operators counter each other and fit everyone‚Äôs different playstyles
---
How does one find a team to play with?
---
Come around the corner I fucking dare you
---
Yes, Ubisoft needs to be more harsh with bans, and taking down glitch videos frequently. People like that ruin games and suck dick.
---
yes they do
---
He can take his turret and walk around but it‚Äôs shield goes down and he can only hope fire
---
Sorry.
---
Damn, how did you know?
---
How many months apart is it between new elites?

Ok thanks, good to know!
---
Clash is for bubble blowing babies &gt;:(
---
Good idea, ranked is currently a no go for me until they fix this.
---
He ¬¥s giving you everything he ¬¥s got
---
What a pal
---
In case you didn‚Äôt know...Clash is bugged right now. Her shield can be glitched out and she shoots her smg through it.
---
What if, when mounted, the turret could rotate 360¬∞?
---
That‚Äôs what casual is for. Ranked is supposed to be like pro league especially with pick and ban coming soon
---
I love when you're holding an angle and your buddies step in front of your bullets
---
Basically Clash can have her shield and SMG out at the same time, making her basically Monty but with a SMG. Her shield can block bullets and her fun can still shoot and obliterate you.
---
This is the newest operator which can easily be mistaken for clash. Her ability is that she can shoot through her shield. Also make sure you don't confuse shield glitchers with the other new operated shield face.
---
Yeah, very fairly outplayed.
---
1 step foward, two steps back. Ubisoft balancing montra

All of them are English.

---
Give him the infinity stones
---
Now that you mentioned it.... Hmm....
---
So you don‚Äôt get get ran up on deploying things
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume your new to siege or haven‚Äôt used c4 a lot
---
What did u fuck this time ubi
---
Played Siege a couple of days ago after almost a year out playing top down MMO, so my accuracy was a little off. Took it slow, killed one person but missed the last and had a child screech down his mic at me because I didn't get the kill. Even though the rest of the team all died. It's such a stressful game and it's a shame because it sort of used to be fun.
---
How is it a friendly reminder when you said ‚ÄúUbisoft released new boosters‚Äù. They‚Äôre old.
---
Because it‚Äôs a big gun.
---
Both have an infinity stone
---
Meta right now is clash using your gun while your shield is equipped
---
The best operators at the moment (my opinion) are: clash (shieldglitch makes her invincible), maestro (his lmg is really powerful), and frost (her weapon is also really powerful). You could also buy Maverick for stealth or mozzie if you want to spy on people.
---
The Meta at the moment is two/three defenders on the objective (most of the time these are 1 speed 3 armor) and two/three operators roaming around (these are mostly 2/3 speed operators and doc). The Meta for attackers is staying as a group and mainly use 2/3 speed operators. 
---
I don't know what you mean with sensitivity, but if you mean mouse sensitivity, you have to figure that one out for yourself.
---
Holy shit a tachanka main{-}7 also I don't know
---
All the good/experienced dev were prob moved over to the GR breakpoint dev Team
---
You can change to whichever you prefer so it‚Äôs not a big deal.
---
Yeah tru dat, i think its really a button to report cheaters to the anticheat. But you still dont need to spam chat about reporting some one.
---
I really wanted the alpha pack charm or this but all I got was the Doge charm
---
Had one happen the other day where I put my Mira down and the side that was supposed to be clear was black. The side that was supposed to be black was clear. It didn‚Äôt fix itself until it was a 1v5 on bank basement defense...in ranked....4-4 match point.....üòÇüòÇüòÇ I literally wanted to cry. 30 MMR from plat.
---
Usually lower ranks are used to it
---
But it‚Äôs a gadget
---
THIS THIS AND ONLY THIS! Such a simple fix to this massive problem.. It  boggles my mind that they havent done this yet
---
Because the advanced is better and you are wrong, that's why.
---
Dont yoy guys have time??
---
Operator selection is nothing more than a UI screen. Disabling an operator is a matter of greying out the icon and making the button inactive. It‚Äôs the exact same functionality for the pick ban phase. The idea that removing IQ or Clash for a month would break Siege that‚Äôs ridiculous. Of course the people in charge make the decisions, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we should accept it. Bugs will always be apart of games, but these are bugs that could be avoided easily.
---
My boi recruit!
---
I think it's like downvoting a comment on YouTube, the button changes colour and that's about it. I'd like to hope it gets logged but I've no confidence that it does
---
Sucks I just got back into the game and this happens every game
---
If that doesn‚Äôt work reinstall rainbow and try to see if it continues
---
Y u be toxic. Just stop playing the game if you don‚Äôt like it. I was just answering this guys question
---
Vote to kick initiated: 1/4
---
nice looks like a kawaii Ela
---
What did you do to Ela?
---
When I started up to 25 really I was routinely kicked out as soon as a match started because they didn‚Äôt want to play with lower levels. Stupid shit.
---
For ops just hit up YouTube my man, watch some gameplay of the new ops, and then decide who to buy. 
---
For sensitivity, if you don't have you old settings to work from, my best advice is drop is as low as you feel comfortable with, then adjust up or down if your struggling to track, or over under aiming, over time I've lower mine from around 11/11 h/v 65ads 800dpi and how I'm at 6/6 h/v 37ads 800dpi and I still think it needs lowering a little more. 
---
But don't change you sensitivity up too often, spend a week or 2 at each sensitivity, unless is drastically to slow or fast for you, as it takes time for you to build muscle memory and if you changing it up all the time any muscle memory you learn for your old sensitivity is wasted
---
just add to this "its not cheating its exploiting" and "sorry the game is broke"
---
Picking up spaghetti is technically "easy" - until someone shows you a fork.
---
I agree with this post, advanced is so much better its not even funny
---
Welcome to console, if you don't have someone with you or if you aren't a high enough level you will get kicked because people don't want bad people on their team
---
If we're talking about the channel that's starts with a D and ends with an E at the end, then yea. Hate that channel because the second the vid is up, it's game over.
---
Unfortunately, this games toxicity will never change. I stopped playing for a good year, came back last month and though a majority of matches I've played were better, I still had games where guys would team kill on 3-1 match point round just cause. I save clips and names so I can call them out here and send reports to Ubi. Kids will be kids and they are gonna keep doing stupid stuff like that. Better to find a reliable squad through discord then solo queue
---
What if I say "no u"
---
technically the words dirty or immigrant arent bad by themselves, and the filter doesnt look for context. If it sees a word classified as a swear word, that's when it does something
---
Up until three recruits show up on my screen...
---
Console has text chat? What??
---
Nah. Not new, played when it first came out, got bored after awhile, came back, Siege was glitchy, tried coming back and I see it still hasn't changed much
---
Is it though? Or just a big gun?
---
They took er jobs !
---
They told me that it's not very good, but i'll try to investigate more. Thanks!
---
[deleted]
---
W hat is wrong with IQ?
---
It wasn't directed towards you,  it was for the other guys response. And it's not being toxic it's just a opinion i believe in and that's because of the brokeness of the game and it's state. I truly care for the game but i just don't want it to go any more further in the wrong direction ubi has been leading it to.
---
It's honestly kind of aggravating
---
But it‚Äôs a BIG GUN. It SHOOTS people. If it SHOOTS BULLETS and is big and goes bang,it‚Äôs a gun!

My brain hurts

That‚Äôs 2 season in a row for three accounts, it start to become more probability than chance.

Blind fire is not allowed in airsoft though.

Wait so it's not ironic? gah
---
Won back to back against cheaters using the shield glitches. feltgoodman
---
Pretty sure you can Change it to the old one in the settings even though the advanced one is much better
---
The thing is, that it is a part of how the game is working, therefore it is a game mechanic, intentional or not doesn't matter. 
---
Besides that, there's nothing in the rules book (code of conduct, user agreement, whatever you want to call it) that prevents you from doing that, so it is not "illegal" or simply isn't cheating.
---
so ur telling me people can ban ops in game which is basically disabling them but Ubi cant do it automatically ?
---
Ah, alright, if you got those three maps down, I'd do solo TH more than casual. Only because you can disable all non-ranked maps from the pool, leaving you to play the ranked pool only. A healthy balance between the two probably is best
---
This is both. These are statistics trying to calculate probability.
---
I have given you a reason the clip the blood siege being buggy lately and have you ever played with 100 ping

you don't like it? I'm very glad I got it.

Oh shit, really?

---
I‚Äôm saying they aren‚Äôt the same and like the thread said, it‚Äôs not that simple.

Yeah

Clever girl...
---
But you barely observed anything
---
I could cross the street and not get hit by a car. I observed the fact that I wasn‚Äôt hit. That doesn‚Äôt mean that the changes of me getting hit by a car were 0%
---
So Ubisoft decided to attack the black marked of cheater makers by supplying their own options for free?

Do you have any keyboard or mouse software running?

None of those definitely point to what you're trying to make them.

Which is it then? Your ping causing issues or the game needing to be fixed? You're just throwing shit at a wall and trying to see what sticks.

I 120% agree!!! I enjoy this game so much but situations like this just make it unplayable. We already has operation health and stuff like this still happens. I would have expected an emergency patch!

Y‚Äôknow whenever it comes to glitches and exploits; do we blame Ubi or the people who made found the glitch in the first place and made it widespread

Yes. Terrible human beings. I dropped the hobby cos of them.

---
Have you tried increasing the page file size for your virtual memory? There should be plenty of tutorials on YT, maybe that will fix it.
---
but does it count as a gun kill or a gadget kill?
---
Yes... don't play Rainbow6 at least until they fix these stupid glitches.
---
Thy‚Äôd better fix their shitty game instead of introducing new OPs and maps
---
Well when glaz uses his gun to kill someone, it is considered a gun kill
---
You probably tried this already, but i had my char suddenly stop doing anything sometimes, turns out it was because i had a controller plugged in and because of some microtouches it took the controls over. Plugging it out while playing siege worked.
---
No u

Hey man the trick is to never play siege without friends other wise bad stuff will happen

I said another $500 as in $500 plus the amount I spent on my console
---
But no helm, id pay for that alone
---
My squad managed to beat several teams last night, despite people in those teams using glitches.  It was like playing ranked on hard mode, and it was so satisfying to beat those cheating losers fair and square.
---
Don't become part of the problem.  If you need to cheat to win, it doesn't count as winning.
---
Still has nothing to do with the title.
---
If u think I‚Äôm the problem then do something about it.
---
Yep, and i think different sanctions for different glitches would be fine. Clash glitch or invisible glitch should maybe result in a perma ban if done on purpose. Sometimes a glitch happens and u don't know how.
---
This isn't your first language is it?
---
There was someone in front of you at the moment of shooting and you had rff on so you killed yourself
---
Even paid service like dashlane, lastpass, and 1password still have their free store only system, and if you arent that keen on using pass manager, notepad-in-a-vault/secret place is still a working trick.
---
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2005)
---
Not even playing thatcher tho...
---
That‚Äôs what are statistics and probability made for.
---
I totally agree with you. If new things are implemented in the game just for the sole purpose of showing off cosmetics to people, that could affect how the game works in the sense that it could make the game less enjoyable if the developers focus on making money through cosmetics instead of fixing/improving the game. I don‚Äôt want to feel like playing another game like COD: Advance Warfare or WW2 where all I see are clowns with dark matter camos running around the map. Sure they had the April Fools event with the rainbow headgear/ uniforms but that was something that we don‚Äôt see often in a serious or competitive game. People can say what they want, but I‚Äôd like his game to stay as it is even though sometimes this game can be very hard to enjoy especially in times like these where people exploit the game. But we‚Äôll see what they have for us later this year. Hopefully it‚Äôs stuff that we can all enjoy in peace.
---
It was just a joke sorry
---
Ah I see. I guess I'll just have to go to the friend store and pick up some friends that are into Siege.
---
So being able to become invisible/invincible, isn't an unfair advantage? What if clash is able to dodge the two fire bolts, or kills Capitao first? Then what? You should just lose?
---
The IQ glitch is next to impossible to counter, I've seen a many of aces from exploiters. Shooting her body in spawn doesn't kill her, and she doesn't make any noise/can't be seen where she physically is... What's your counter to that?
---
U gonna do something about it or u just gonna complain about the problem?
---
My counter to that is Kapkan and frost
---
Nope, r6stats never counts accuracy correctly, because every bullets in this game "hits" (even hitting the skybox count as hit)
---
What is going on? I've been off R6 for about a year and I come here and just see utter confusion?
---
Interesting, I have never encountered any of these glitches.
---
I've not complained because it's not a problem for me because I don't dribble.
---
An unholy blend of Archer and Salad Fingers. Cash's jawline is truly haunting.
---
Yes it‚Äôd be great to have the sound fixed and have to listen for audio queues. The new operator would take skill to counter.
---
Because the clash glitch and Dep-Shield will fuck up our ranks if we even attempt ranked right now.
---
 I'll try that thank you
---
You are so cute lol. Nice cosplay!
---
*Anime ela be like*
---
 Original and totally not posted every day
---
Can confirm, some guy decided to yank on my gun barrel for a laugh and a pellet went straight into his forehead from a few centimetres away, despite the gun being a pile of crap it still left a nasty welt.
---
Earlier at another session some guy was bleeding from multiple wounds after strafing in front of friendly fire, looked nasty.
---
Of course go to clubs on Xbox and say someone to play siege with
---
Paintball is said to be worse but idk i only played paintball
---
U said if u team kill that often u should be punished, well do something then pillock, do u even know what I‚Äôm talking about fool?
---
There are many good cams, I like going prone and throwing it under the desk. U don‚Äôt get as much view but my friends and I have good hearing
---
You have a cap and a sledge. And a Hibana. Get behind him or crossbow him. Not very difficult.
---
Yeah, I might have to do the same. I‚Äôve yet to play ranked this Season and I wanted to place before the end of the Season, but I might not even play now.
---
Ur playing like a bitch on console that‚Äôs why you got kicked just spam t bag and run at the dude
---
Outstanding move!
---
.......u get teamkilled by honest people for being a p*ssy.
---
Works for me. Gonna try it asap.
---
Did I say that I should be the one punishing? 
---
&gt;do u even know what I‚Äôm talking about fool?
---
Better than you it appears.
---
We (5 stack) would try our best until match point. If we were defending it was a win, if we were attacking we‚Äôd just suicide.
---
When an Unstoppable Force meets an immovanle object.
---
They just dont play as him lol, if they do the judges make them lose the round.
---
Thank you Sir!
---
Honestly? Yes.  
---
While projectile carriers in your scenario goes rampant, remember that both sides can do the same.  
---
While on the other hand, not everyone knows(or wants to know) how to abuse a glitch, meaning that in many cases only one side will get the advantage.
---
Funny cause I never get tk'd I wonder why
---
Good take away. Great counter argument. That'll work the first round and then none of the following. Once IQ knows you'll take trap OPs she'll slow down and shoot out traps. Now what?
---
Hoping IQ is an idiot is not a counter lmao. Hoping your Capitao can kill clash before she guns him down is not a counter.
---
Sledge's, right?
---
Honestly I hate people that teamkill glitchers. Just accept the win haha
---
Might want to edit usernames out, against the rules
---
Winners don't use drugs

Welcome my friend

Looks like dancer of the boreal valley.

This is bouta be a dope ass season.
---
It is so anticlimactic when you are sneaking up on the objective and then you get spotted

Who else actually jumped at that jumpsxare LMAO

I posted a video clearly displaying a team exploiting these glitches and this is the message I got... Such nonsense!

The Frogmen Corps are some crazy motherfuckers. from the Wiki page
---
"Each year 500‚Äì600 applicants start the course and less than a dozen complete all nine months. Since its creation in 1957, 311 have completed the training"
---
Are you sure that its that black and white? If by content you mean Maps and Operators id have to disagree.
---
Id imagine that they have creatives who are creating the ideas or visual designs of the operators and maps and also bring those ideas to live by implementing them as code into the game. I dont think these roles are mutually exclusive.
---
And it would be very counter productive to have some one else fix the bugs that you have made through your code.
---
On the other side Operation Health 2.0 would only help temporary liek the last one. As it doesnt change the development process in the long run. So we would be back to 0 in a few months.
---
Tho some developers stated that the dev team has come a long way, and they have more people working on the game and a more solid development cycle then ever but it doesnt change the big fuck up the game was at the start. Rainbow was a big melting pot for technologies in its starting years. They scrapped a lot but there is also a lot of the spaguetti code in there from the start.
---
Looks like I finally have an attacker to main. No longer will I be stuck on the op select screen on attack saying I don't know who to pick.
---
Ying has an unsupressed version. I wouldn't be surprised if Nokk has a integrally supressed weapon
---
F for intel meta
---
Right this guy worries about the trivial shit "it hasn't been four years yet!" get outta here, the real problem is the exploits and time it takes to patch them. I am sure they could work out a solution at the studio to disable ops.
---
Why are you playing ranked when it‚Äôs broken? Also just cause they made a teaser and released it doesnt mean theyre not gonna fix it lmao
---
Damn
---
On Facebook. A better picture of NOKK the New Attacking Operator. (Video is the same)

Id I figured on bare skin Airsoft would hurt more but I just assumed they used more powerful guns than the $10 pieces of shit I had.
---
Any other Company has this hotfixed the next day. Incompetence is rampant in game devs these days it seems...
---
Only problem is that you can tk once and than reverse friendly fire is on because that was intentional tk, you can only stop one abuser per game.
---
I been lucky so far, only encounter one in ranked on the other team, (even though i got kicked on the last round...)
---
Caviera and vigil have some competition
---
N√∏kk, N√∏kk. Who's there? (I'm so sorry...)
---
Already liking the look of N√∏kk just from this teaser. Looking forward to how they tease the Secret Service guy and his dapper suit as well.
---
Her mines arent even that good,  they don't have markers abive them, that aren't lethal, and most of the times they go off it'll only last three usual 5 seconds instead of s full 10. And by the time you move to intercept whoever set it off they'll have a gun barrel at your head since Ela sounds like she's wesring high heels with the bottom of heavy boots.
---
Yes, I changed it to Lesion immediately after posting this. Sorry for the confusion.
---
she's prolly gonna be a slightly better vigil on attack
---
\*her.
---
The only thing wrong is that guys aim
---
He did drugs
---
Probably Drugs
---
Actually this is way better. Yet, at the same time I don't want these idiots to rage on me cause I messed up their only way of winning and kill me

Hello henkkaaazzz, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bozw1e/messages_i_got_from_a_dude_after_breaking_his/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
let me just "repost" this https://i.redd.it/jv2ze1p77xk21.jpg
---
N√∏kk is female
---
Just wait till Sam Fisher joins in on the fun
---
It does serve a purpose though. Helps us learn to combat it, as well as putting it right in Ubi‚Äôs face.
---
 I‚Äôm happy they are because I hate using global operators. I like helping myself. That might be a bit selfish but I don‚Äôt wanna fkn die lmao. I only use ops like Mozzie, cav, and clash for defending.
---
it's Lesion time
---
Pulse was more OP when he got the "Quality of Life" change that made his scanner update in real-time than he was during Black Ice. I think this was during Skull Rain or Red Crow.
---
Lol, some people resort to glitches to win
---
what are the leaks? can you give me a link?
---
So she is a dementor? Also that video made my ears hurt.
---
Mr. Bear needs to come back in siege.
---
That just looked like a cooler vigil trailer tbh
---
She's an attacker.
---
Raw input On
---
Raw input Off
---
Neither of them helps :/
---
omg i wanna see her vs Caveira
---
According to notebookcheck it should ad 1080p, but idk why game version....
---
I think you‚Äôre just in a bad mood. Don‚Äôt worry, they are working on it. The issues will definitely be gone by the time next season rolls out or even before then.
---
Oh Hey cool Predator is joining the game in a new event. Wait...... no that's just N√∏kk
---
‚ÄúU replied to me, so u were talking to me‚Äù [it your fault, not to see your own produce, one day you‚Äôll pay for your sins]
---
Vigil + the girl from "The Ring"
---
Would be a great meme comment but anyone who refuses to have 3+ passwords might be seriously that ignorant
---
I‚Äôd rather have the renown than the skin
---
Looks like ill be Lesion all next season.
---
Sin doesn't exist.
---
If you were offended by what I posted, then you should change the way you play (and read).
---
Can someone identify that handgun she is using  ?
---
I hope so
---
This is the Xbox community in a nutshell.
---
Source: I play on both Xbox and PC regularly. This rarely ever happens on PC for me.
---
Its not annoying. They're not going to delay their Season 2 reveal because of in-game shitlords. They've been working on these operators for months. All reveals coincide with major competitive events. They will fix the exploits as well as release new content.
---
I actually really like that she has her face covered. It‚Äôs a nice change of pace from the other female ops we‚Äôve gotten.
---
I know I‚Äôm just saying as being the scariest op
---
On bare skin it surely doesnt feel great but not near as bad as paintballs on bare skin. I play in a t shirt, getting hit in the arm with a paintball leaves a *large* welt. The majority of the time getting hit with an airsoft bb leaves a pretty small insignificant welt. 
---
Or to consider it with the numbers, paintball guns are usually regulated at 250-280 fps. With a 3 gram paintball that's 8.7 joules. 
---
Airsoft guns on an *outdoor* field are typically regulated at 400fps, which with a .2 gram bb is only 1.4 joules.
---
Overheating? Whats the cpu usage like when the game acts up?
---
her *
---
makeup maybe since he‚Äôs undercover
---
Suppressed Desert Eagle? That's certainly something.
---
Because why waste my time staring at a load screen?
---
Like how IQ had a shotgun in her operator video, right?
---
monkaW
---
Oh so u admit to saying I was the problem
---
Thanks dude. I didn‚Äôt realize this was planned. I needed to hear shitlords lmao. That might be my new word. Cheers mate :)
---
Before any of us rush to conclusions about how OP or broken this op might be (based off the leaks), remember that there were tons of pre-release discussions about how Alibi or Mozzie was going to ruin the game.  Let's wait and see.
---
She's
---
More
---
Spoopy
---
Than 
---
Caveira
---
Raptor legs plz
---
You quoted what I said. It clearly doesn't say anything about you personally.
---
Damn. Yeah that's basically why we quit playing paintball with just hoodies as gear. lmao. God help you if you got hit on the hand.
---
New Spooky Bitch
---
The clash glitch is nothing compared to the IQ one. Opposition does the IQ glitch and you can mark down the L, unless someone on your team is doing it. That's entirely what ranked is at the moment, who can out glitch who.
---
She made her amazing
---
Yup it's the main reason I stopped playing. Friends stopped playing.
---
Yeah this shouldn't be mandatory.
---
Seems like the leaks were correct. Offensive vigil
---
Lmao exactly
---
Nah just right
---
markers like lesion traps would be a QOL change, im not against that.
---
Good to know that just cause they made a teaser and released it doesn‚Äôt mean theyre not gonna fix it - thanks
---

---
Good teaser ! Now I wonder if she's still "extremely cute"
---
As a programmer, I can assure you that "disabling an operator would destabilize the game" is a "fuck off" statement from a programmer who either doesn't want to do it (because they'd rather spend their time fixing the actual issue than adding workarounds) or is petrified of that specific part of codebase.
---
Personally, I'd just disable it purely in the UI and ban anyone who bypasses that to pick them anyway.
---
So? It's their flipping problem.  
---
Riot Games has no damn issue disabling any hero from LoL at any given time, even if only for an hour or two. This happens (or happened back around seasons 4/5 when I played) regularly every single time a glitch or exploit was found with a hero.  
---
The complete incompetence of Ubisoft in implementing a system that'd allow them to temporarily block a character from being chosen is NOT an excuse for them not to block one.  
---
It's their own fault they've implemented all the characters into the game PERMANENTLY.
---
Didn't know Cav and Vigil had a child
---
Going to need a little bit more than that.
---
Pick and ban is an entirely different system to globally disabling an op.
---
This guy has to be just hype, I bet his only ability is to hide from cameras
---
Or girl idk what it is
---
So Vigil or is it shimmered to players eyes?
---
If they don't fix IQ she'll became useless from the start, lol. Now they have motivation.
---
Jesus. One operator having a similar ability is *totally* enough reason to expect everything to be low effort for the *next four to five years*
---
The green thing under the screen? What is it?
---
But he looks so cool they can‚Äôt do that
---
Don‚Äôt forget leigion
---
Girl *
---
No lul ü§£
---
I was reading about Delta and they had a similar attrition rate. I'd love to read a detailed account of how this kind of training goes down.
---
Clash is not shit
---
‚ÄúBut ma dont leave me!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry son but you just suck to much at video games.‚Äù
---
Playing with a friend helps stop this, its annoying as fuck because I was 1v4 clutching then i went on my cams to check something then got kicked
---
Anything can happen,and Sam would give Skull lady a run for her money.
---
League of legends, if even the newest character who just dropped is bugged, they get disabled until fixed. WoW has Disabled content that was released too buggy in the past until it was fixed. It‚Äôs not hard to find a game that does this or at least does something about the people exploiting the bugs. Only Ubisoft allows it to continue in this way like it has for four years. 
---
Oh and I know what you‚Äôre going to say next ‚Äúoh but siege isn‚Äôt like those games.‚Äù Bullshit, those games have just as many challenges to develop as a game like siege and they manage to pull off good responses to bugs. The difference is that those developers actually care.
---
Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever get to play as a Nazgul but alright I‚Äôm kinda down for this
---
i was trying iq glitch for about an hour and couldn‚Äôt get it, i know i did steps right though?
---
How old is this clip, if your hands have been shaking since before the pistol recoil change, you may want to see a doctor.
---
RIP Vigil who's the spoody operator now
---
Fuck em man, if they get pissed, they're fucking babies.
---
You just triggered my PTSD from that sluts grab attack
---
yeah a french yt in live say i like at 90% at the Lesion's shotgun and it's true that I agree with what says
---
So a gunget? Gadgun?
---
Excellent point
---
Exactly that.
---
I‚Äôm uninstalling if she turns invisible.
---
So what are you doing here?
---
Lol, it‚Äôs the hood they both have. Good times good times
---
I‚Äôm confused as to how we got from the original discussion to this. Anyways, yeah crouch walking is completely ok and not a cheap mechanic in any way. I‚Äôll go find some pl clips of people crouch walking to show you how stupid your claims are
---
I guess that's Pancor Jackhammer. Oh boy, BF3 vibes.
---
Alright bois, lets go on a witch hunt.
---
Operation 2scared
---
Are you blind
---
You can always ping through debris
---
It's not a glitch when it's a feature!
---
I agree completely
---
I‚Äôm so fucking hyped.
---
Lmao
---
Spookier bitch.
---
Consol players are super salty
---
Tomorrow
---
It will most likely preview on Friday.
---
I kind of hope she has a different gun. I don't mind if operators are using recyicled weapons, like for Finka and Lion, but I want new weapons as well.
---
Thought the same thing.
---
So, the new Operation is called Phantom Sight. Huh, sounds nice and fits well with Nokk's ability. I like it.
---
It's pretty old, I was having problems sharing it on the app, gave up, and forgot about it. Came across an article on how to resolve the issue so I tried it again.
---
Will everyone get them ??
---
I‚Äôm confused what‚Äôs wrong with the maths?
---
It's incredibly sluggish and awkward compared to a mouse.
---
And on the topic of FPS, very sluggish compared to VR also.
---
YOU‚ÄôRE ROOKIE!!!
---
Well not really, I‚Äôve won against clashes. Just use stuns or go above and shoot through the floor. Nomad works really well too, as well as anyone with frags.
---
Yeah holy fuck this man is making no sense lol
---
I may be wrong but I thought I saw an As Val or VSS
---
That'd be very odd, considering that there's only one or two Pancor Jackhammers that actually exist.
---
These 2, big woman being a worse Nomad. Drone guy being another boring sit on a camera defense op. Glad I didn't buy the pass this year.
---
Hello Mihael_71, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bp0sc3/its_just_disgusting_to_use_those_glitches_in/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yo this is actually a nice idea
---
Kanal is getting the rework in S2, I think Kafe is getting theirs in S3 or 4
---
They've done it before, MP5SD. Though they also use a placeholder weapon for Zo's teaser too iirc.
---
I wonder if her ability works like cav , where when she activates it she can only use her secondary gun.
---
Maybe
---
Is she voiced by Mads Mikkelson? I can‚Äôt be the only one who sees the resemblance of this shot to the death stranding trailer
---
He probably though he hit the guy on top of red stairs. Little did he know it was even more epic than that.
---
Cav gets a taste of her own medicine
---
I'm sure if it was my job to sit down and come up with ops I'd do better than another guy who can see through smoke and not get flashbanged, and a female vigil.
---
is this amnesia?
---
gimme Ubi

I gained 4 points for rank
---
&gt; big woman being a worse Nomad
---
what?
---
It is beautiful
---
I hope u got reported.
---
I mean we already got a preview with IQ glitch, it's training us to look out for invisible ops.
---
Got it. Good clip btw.
---
Maybe her ability is like cav, when she activates it she can only use her secondary?!
---
Ok, you‚Äôre not wrong. I‚Äôm just sayin it‚Äôs good that they‚Äôre balancing either side, and yes I would like to see new abilities further down the line
---
What teaser ?
---
Nope. Nope. Nope.  Now I have to watch out for a spooky bitch ON BOTH SIDES?!?!?!  Sigh.
---
I want to play her.
---
The only time they outright disabled an Operator was during Operation Red Crow when they disabled Hibana.  However, it caused the game to be even more unplayable than with Hibana available and they rolled it back literally the day after.
---
I would've hoped after all that time they would've added a mechanism that is designed for that precisely in case something like this happened again, but we have no evidence either way that such a feature was properly added.
---
Yes pls
---
Amen
---
Big woman/man then.
---
Why does the Xbox version have an FPS counter? Seems pointless.
---
Eww, Hereford is pretty bad.
---
lol wtf is this? Predator mixed in with a horror genre movie?
---
Game is getting less and less realistic with each new operator. Invisibility cloak now?
---
Because she has fucking silenced deagle
---
the other one is better.
---
You know quite literally every competitive game out on the market right now that has a glitch of you section in their report pretty much every game in the world that has online multiplayer pretty much every online service provider like playstation network xbox live and steam.
---
 You really want provable examples of something that is common knowledge?  Look at it this way if someone in the competitive pro scene were to use this glitch he and his team would be disqualified because it is cheating that's all the proof you need.
---
 You know what I think I think you're one of the people who abuses this glitch and you just don't want to get banned for basically cheating so you're trying to defend the glitch and the people who use it because the only people that ever defend this kind of stuff are the people who do it
---
Isnt FMG-9 an Glock 18?
---
at this point this message should be very obvious because of the amount cheaters in this game atm..
---
Is that the well girl from the ring?
---
Hmmmm
---
Yeah and I've already got one trying to defend them and say that they don't need to be banned because apparently he thinks it's not cheating which tells me hes 1 of the people who does it
---
lol on my accounts profile bio for a while just said "I tk glitches and cheaters." don't have to agree with my philosophy but you aren't going to ruin everyone's fun so you can abuse the game.
---
why would u ever go from pc to console.
---
Oof thaths nothin my man i have 18508.00
---
Damn he looks dope
---
they actually made her look like a frogmen instead of making her look nothing like her CTU like most operators, Finally I'm glad they're changing it up.
---
I mean I did only try it once?  And I asked my team to tk me, but I can see how this is a problem, and I couldn't do a custom game because none of my friends would just stay.
---
Are you saying Jagers stuff only works on 2 nadeS?
---
Hype train!
---
Careful, too many words will trigger his retardation.
---
Why the hel did you play ranked when this was happening? I wasn't about to risk my Plat 1 for shit DON'T PLAY RANKED WHEN GAME BREAKING BUGS ARE PRESENT!!!!!
---
Yeah, he sounds like a moron. Idk y, but I have been getting a lot of plats and diamonds who have been glitching, and they say that I‚Äôm a retard and thk me when I call them out for it so they get reported. Idk y the higher level players r more toxic to me than any other group of people in this game.
---
If you also compare the Stocks of the guns, which you can also clearly see in the video, It matches pretty well actually. But take everything with a grain of salt, as it might just be lazy reuse of assets.
---
Reported a few times through a support ticket. 
---
They don't do anything with it either, same as the in-game report. You just get a generic "we have sent the info to our team etc. etc." and just shield themselves with "as per Ubi policy we won't reveal the outcome" ... 
---
Just a generic thanks for the report, but nothing's gonna happen reply.
---
And exploiting glitches in the game should be motive to FIX IT. If you find a glitched hole in a wall that lets u spawn peek an enemy with no  repercussions whose fault is that? Yours or the Devs? We both know the answer so again. Ubi...FIX your game.
---
I was looking for this info. Funny how they took the sticky down. Almost like they want it to go away. 
---
So my question has been answered. This game is still unplayable.
---
Team killing a cheater isn't toxic.  The cheating itself is toxic if he was team killing someone just because that would be toxic but if the person is abusing a glitch and cheating that's not talks it that's giving them what they deserve
---
Idk man maybe it‚Äôs since I play casual but I wouldn‚Äôt even know this exploit exists if it weren‚Äôt for reddit
---
Huh that‚Äôs funny...
---
Your mission is to locate and consume a lunch
---
Oooh yeaah
---
I spy an ex call of duty player who tactical reloads after every kill
---
Still make me laugh whenever I read that Ela and her sister are more resistant to concussion grenade because they had apparently used them on each other throughout childhood. As if getting concussive trauma to your skull made you more resistant to it more than every other CTU innthe world. Or Poland was THAT strong
---
Yea but the handgun in the leak is very clearly a full sized Deagle
---
Thank you
---
That twitch was stupid lol not the system. If i saw this glaz aiming there i would of go around him from his back instead of stepping right in front of him lmfao it's called common sense.
---
He means his friend is a thatcher main
---
Also here is a link to the operation:  [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/413713441631633408/578291374483308561/operationsledgehammerthatsmashesthewholehouse.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/413713441631633408/578291374483308561/operationsledgehammerthatsmashesthewholehouse.png)
---
It's more like 'Nook/Noek' instead of 'knock' I believe is the right way to pronounce it.
---
Of course it‚Äôs the devs fault, while players are encouraged to find glitches and report them, using them several times should be bannable.
---
wdym client side?
---
Beautiful!
---
nope https://i.imgur.com/ReU00iQ.png

unless you're thinking of the pro league glacier skin that cost actual money

If I were to make a guess, maybe She/he disrupts cameras almost like a mute jammer

This is no laughing matter gosh darnit

ive yet to see it in ranked. im sure its happening but i guess im just one of the lucky ones.
---
Oh, I wouldn't have ever thought you've tried it, that changes everything!
---
He curved the bullet.
---
Because they think they're competitive skill rank means they are automatically good and just above everyone else.  So they think because they either aren't or got carried to diamond and platinum that they should just be able to get away with cheating and abusing glitches.
---
 I'll admit it my skill rating in this game isn't that high I am a gold 3 or 2 on average but I don't really play ranked that often I enjoy the game and I just play casual But I've been up to the highest ranks and other competitive games like an over watch I was a grandmaster for a while so I know exactly what goes on up there in the high ranks everyone gets an ego and has their head stuck so far up their own ass they  Think that they are Immune to ban and punishment  And get mad when anyone who is a lower right of them dares outplay them or call them on being a jackass.
---
 Just my personal opinion but if you abuse a glitch and your in diamond you don't belong in diamond because that tells me that you used glitches to get up that far
---
Nothing. They don‚Äôt ban people for glitches
---
Yeah this tends to happen to players who are under level 25 I had to play with friends until I got there to prevent me getting kicked in every match
---
is that a motherfucking jackhammer?! what the actual fuck?!
---
nope, i'm the only one who uses my pc.
---
....no it doesn‚Äôt. that‚Äôs not true at all. they add new skins for guns all the time and it has nothing to do with the operator or anything like that.
---
no idea fam
---
Damn this game looks good on max
---
Her ass must be glorious then.
---
Is that left stick aiming as well ?
---
Big yikes
---
I‚Äôll take an ineffective policing system over a a vote to kick that‚Äôs easily abused by a 3 or 4 stack any day of the week.
---
[You‚Äôre thinking of SAD, which I‚Äôve read actively recruit from Delta.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Activities_Division)
---
ive seen the complaints all week. i've played every night this week as well, havent encountered a single one of these exploits.
---
I agree !
---
i learned most of my calls from just playing. Also under the compass it should say the callout of the room your standing in. But you can watch pro league. its a little more fast but i learned some nice ones from there
---
I agree that it's the Six12SD
---
It just looks the exact same, Barrel and stock. If you catch the right frame you get a pretty defined silhouette of a Six12SD.
---
Actually the clash wasn‚Äôt exploiting.
---
Went from gold 2 to gold 4 before I stopped playing altogether. Kept losing to teams that had glitchers every round. Further reason to remove k/d stat
---
Good to know.
---
My first game of the day is a casual to get warmed up and make sure I‚Äôm not full potato aim that day, if all is good to go then I only play ranked from that point on. I hate casual so much.
---
I thought it was ¬ß
---
damn, thats a whole nother level of jumping to conclusions
---
Too op lololol.
---
Permission to upvote sir?
---
You see you say that, but this is ubisoft. It wont be a week. It will be months. Plural. They will attempt to fix the root of the problem so as not to worry about it again. 4 months later. They re add the character into the game. The coding screws with the older stuff. Bam. Two more ops out. Eventually half the game isn‚Äôt playable. But its obvious to me that you and what is it now? 40 other people can see passed your nose to spite your face.

Looks like she'll be an attacker version of Vigil

It was lol. I had loads of fun in that lobby

While what i wrote is purely based on my short development experience, im curious how you got that Info...

It‚Äôs a gun.
---
I need a Season Pass ASAP
---
Doesn't matter if its 4 years or 3 years. It should not be happening. That was a pretty pointless argument
---
These are the worst gliches yet and we expect these not to happen every damn update they have and four years later, here we are
---
whose Nokk again? Attacker or Defender?
---
And ones already invisible
---
&gt; If you can hide yourself from cameras that doesn‚Äôt mean you turn off your thermal signature.
---
But we don't know if the defender vision is based on heat, and anyway it's not like this game was realistic in any way, so it doesn't really matter.
---
If you take the ingame logic, Nokk will not appear on bulletproof cameras, that are kind of thermal. So think as the defender goggles as a bulletproof camera glued on his head.
---
Pls Ubisoft i can only get so hard
---
that gun would be terrible on attack
---
I said i can't buy through the game https://i.imgur.com/vpBOAca.png

Blackbeard tho

Is it the first time they do that?

I mean doesn't for honor and assassins creed have one already

Attacker

Maaaybe ;p

Indeed, I believe so. I know Hibana's Elite is also lore tied but in a lesser manner. It is tied with her learning how to use the bow she uses in her Elite animation.
---
I hate clash glitchers, they‚Äôre all absolute losers and now I have to run impact grenades now to make sure I don‚Äôt get teamkilled
---
I am thinking more of a balancing stand point a suppressor with a 50 would be a bit too op.
---
Hey! Thanks for the correction!
---
Vigil pt 2 The attacker
---
I have played siege from Day one and always tried to report players like that and what does ubi do? Absolutely nothing. If you are not a streamer or Pro, your report etc does not matter one bit
---
Happens all the time its so annoying and especially if you don't get kicked the people who tk you
---
me going downstairs at 2am to get water
---
Worst? Hardly. And it‚Äôs been a minute since the last bout of terrible glitches. As it is taking a week off the game won‚Äôt kill you. You kids don‚Äôt understand a damn thing about the reality of dealing with the glitches from a technicians stand point. Nevermind 99% of this community has gotten more than their money‚Äôs worth back on this game already
---
okay? congrats on making an incredibly pointless post
---
Is it like vigil but attacking or...?
---
I love it
---
Ok thank you
---
lol how‚Äôd you guess?
---
fuse has a shield and the ak
---
&gt; Get over your spoiled as selves and take a break from the game for a few days
---
some of these exploits have been in the game for 2 years
---
i get called a smurf all the time because i switch between consoles. im like level 300 on ps4 but im low level on xbox. so when i play on xbox how is ubi supposed to determine whether im truly smurfing?
---
I was scared enough by Cav on Attack. Now there's god damn boogymonster on defense. My heart can't take this anymore
---
nope. just your garbage internet
---
The operation should have been named Phantom Menace, Change My Mind
---
Not so secret now is it
---
I just want the game to work as intended not with all these shitty fucking glitches ruining the game experience.
---
WATCH OUT BANDIT GLAZ IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU, OH NO HE CAN‚ÄôT HEAR US HE HAS AIRPODS IN.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd be able to buy them anywhere digitally. 
---
I‚Äôm not an expert on this but I‚Äôm thinking the reason you can upload a code is BC the code is already in a database somewhere, registered, and ready to be activated.
---
Hopefully this means UBI is doing something positive for the game.
---
Not gonna happen
---
  
---
Would create so many false bans because this game is a buggy mess and it's not uncommon that people accidentally use a glitch because it's so easy to recreate
---
Like the old 3 speed tachanka glitch just use your turret with a pistol well congrats now you get banned because you used your pistol on his turret
---
I already smell downvotes but my opinion is: don't ban exploiters start hotfixing exploits
---
Well they just added the heaviest and the shortest.
---
said dbl_online with his game breaking glitches

why don‚Äôt you wait to complain until they‚Äôre released

Rumor is both, silent step + vigil suit.

It was obviously a joke. And I always have a steady 10 ish ping. It's whenever an enemy is near by I get a random lag spike

your definition of promoting is kinda skewed bud

Hello XeroLulamoon, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bp2sv7/why_is_the_community_upset_on_glitches_currently/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Omg that is straight up Slenderman shit bro.

I‚Äôm just glad it‚Äôs not a leak, cheers!

I don‚Äòt know but I can‚Äòt wait for the ‚ÄûN√∏kk N√∏kk; who‚Äòs there?‚Äú jokes :3

She‚Äôs kinda a mixture of cav and vigil, she was leaked to have a shadow step and that she can go invisible to cams when she activated her ability
---
Is that a

# Five-seveN???
---
TY
---
Hold on bigger question is she holding a suppressed deagle
---
Well that‚Äôs just untrue
---
It‚Äôs pronounced Nuk as in nuke but with a shirt u. It‚Äôs the sound you make make when your confused about something but short.
---
Uh but in short basically
---
And they say this isn‚Äôt a horror game....
---
Thermal literally means heat. If his cam is thermal, then it is based on heat. Who knows maybe bulletproof cams will be a counter to No√∏k.
---
Vigil‚Äôs ex who stole his tech after the divorce
---
why would you post this again. obviously you had a cheater on your team. accept it and get over it
---
So just danish navy seals. Okayyu
---
Casual is horrible.
---
Well I guess since I can‚Äôt make a post asking about this apparently, what are the big glitches right now that the community is upset about, I haven‚Äôt quite seen them and am curious
---
Attack üëç
---
WHY ARE WE STILL HERE?!
---
Then it's not functionally a deagle. It may be the same make, but deagle refers usually to a heavy-round pistol- The 'smallest' round any model has used was a 357, which would still be quite a bit heftier than what that op has.
---
All I see is a thumbprint
---
Wish they did that, but sadly the only verifiable ones are rare.
---
the red flashing light is supposed to be the punishment for ping spam. 
---
in regard to the main post, that would very op if the ability applied to the whole team. Universal abilities have already been abused then nerfed (lion, and dok. finka actually has downsides such as increased damage from toxic babes and being more detectable by pulse). Any decently coordinated 4-5 stack could easily rush through crucial chokepoints.
---
I like that, that's pretty sick.
---
√ò√òF
---
I'll stick to my PC thanks
---
2nd Worst.
---
The Castle one was a little worse.
---
Never seen that before
---
Yeah they have used the wrong weapons on ops in reveals in the past
---
Gross
---
We're defo going to get some gameplay soon
---
Then you need to broaden you horizons. That or you will just have to deal with it until it‚Äôs fixed. You complaining isn‚Äôt going to make it get fixed any faster
---
You need to play more and have actual reasons to hate an op before hating on it.
---
Stolen from Ubisoft Twitter
---
Iq can turn invisible
---
Idk about the hakim rifle. Lol. Imagine the spawnpeaks.
---
Chaos My friend, chaos
---
i don‚Äôt understand, i said meant that you can barely see the cam. not sure if i‚Äôm stupid or if it‚Äôs you who‚Äôs probably bronze
---
probably model reuse for prerelease material, like iq's op video
---
Why would they make an op meant to flank and play slow a 3 speed over 2/2?
---
Yee. Thank you man :)
---
So she's literally just attack vigil right?
---
How do I upvote this 50k times?
---
Hmm is the forigve system included yet ? Seeing quite a few vids now where RFF gets activated imediately
---
How can a game go from having no glitches to having 3 pop up Simultaneously.
---
The leaks said she has a passive silent step ability as well but that might not be true, and I think the deagle is a mistake like other photos where ops have the wrong guns
---
no it looks like it resembles her face viel she's wearing
---
yea its almost like it never got fixed in the first place
---
hmmmm
---
Awwwww yea, another 3 speed
---
Doubt it, Lesion already has it.
---
Hold UP, does she have a shade tech watch?
---
League of legends is built on the proper engine and probably is far less complicated than siege. How does you attacking ubi help you enjoy the game? You know that like the number 2 reason people don‚Äôt pick it siege is because of how toxic this community is. You bitching leads directly to your displeasure with the game. You complaining after the problem has already been reported and recognized increases the trolls who want to do it. You literally are causing yourself to not enjoy the game.
---
I was so hyped for this season. Then the glitches and general toxicity have resulted in me not even bothering to finish placements yet. I've been playing since white noise and this is the least amount I've played since starting.
---
I've never run into this issue
---
must be americans cos i literally don‚Äôt understand, i just said that i tried it and you can‚Äôt see the camera from a 3rd person view. now your trying to impersonate me from a spastics perspective
---
No matter what the system for punishing it, people will pull this. They did the same thing beforehand. Without a system punishing it, people would just tk randomly because 'hurr durr, u mad'. There's no way to make it work without these dipshits abusing it.
---
Ia it lore friendly
---
&gt; Do you work at ubi?
---
do you?
---
when i see a 1 year old account that posts ONLY in the rainbow 6 subreddit and 95% of those posts are defending the game/defending ubisoft, i gotta ask
---
To be honest other than the dancer, it reminded me of the orange glowing watches from the Division
---
You aren‚Äôt too bright huh?

Is Nokk gonna have a fat ass too uwu

Operation 4thosevigilmainsoutthere
---
Looks like a mummy head. I love it

Thats just sad. Cmon ubi.

Nope.

can you stack them? like have 2 beside each other or will they both hit the first two?
---
I call this the Chopper lean (One Piece Reference).
---
https://m.imgur.com/sY1gJ8Z?r
---
What about the clash and shield glitch
---
If she‚Äôs invisible to Valk cams, Echo drones and Maestro Eyes, then this operator is going to be off the charts. She looks great for solo players like myself
---
Operation: No Slep
---
and Alibi
---
That's true but it's gonna put pressure on them to fix it faster right? Cause in the history of rainbow, there has never neen 3 major glitches at once. You defending them isn't gonna make anything happen either. If we don't voice out option on this then it'll take longer to be fixed
---
Alright so what‚Äôs your solution?
---
No, honestly didnt even know they were a thing
---
I‚Äôm surprised so many people here have played Dark Souls, I don‚Äôt know why lol
---
N√∏kk, I choose you!
---
I started today in a good mood and the intention to get to plat because I was only a few wins away and now I'm back down to 160 points which for me at this point is about 9 straight wins, most of it thanks to guys running around with clash or some invisible IQ knifing everybody. I know it's not going to happen but it would be nice if they at least reimbursed the points lost thanks to people glitching.

"beary amazing"

Without any draw rounds ranked can only go 4-4 with 5th win winning the match.

in ghost recon they have the RB6 ops and sam fisher.

I think the watches from the division is called shade tech watches

I love the blue they‚Äôre using for this season, good color choice

because they are old glitches that have been in the game for 2+ years

Just delete the bug

That was one single glitch. Not there at once
---
And everyone will play them for the weapons and will provide such little utility to the team. People will play them like Ash and this is a good thing. With a 2/2 they are less effective at rushing and are pseudo-forced to use utility better and be more conservative. 
---
Capitao is the only well designed 3 speed in the game.
---
That‚Äôs weird, I thought that all the floors on favela were unbreakable.

Euthanize global dumbassery and general idiocy

That‚Äôs good to see. I hope she is. We‚Äôll have to wait and see

dude my dad hava a scar and i never asked about that

shills gonna shill
---
Now it should be that whenever her gadget is activated, her visors glow like Iron Man like the picture.
---
Well i ger around 64 fps average on benchmark but it still stutters ingame, and im  almost sure it aint my net. Either theres some poor optimization for certain GPUs after this new patch or the "requirements" and the games cpu/gpu usagr has been increased or something similar :/
---
Better than their default uniforms
---
But it made the game the most unplayable its ever been, and meant you auto-lost if you didn't get Defense 1st Round.
---
Doesn't look like hes into shoulder bashing tho
---
Seems exactly like that from the video, glitching out.
---
It won‚Äôt pressure them to fix it faster and if it did it would probably create more glitches because they tried to fix it too fast. There have been 3 major glitches at once.
---
My defending them is because this community is shit and I‚Äôm tired of seeing you spoiled children bitch at ubi when you mother fuckers are the ones giving the glitch tutorial videos 200k views. Oh that‚Äôs not you? Then complain about those 600k people watching the the videos and not the company taking active steps to resolve the problem
---
Ahh nice job dude.
---
Offensive Cav as well.
---
It will be a full-auto slug shotgun with ACOG and a 30 round mag. Wdym.
---
Vigil is ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to attacking drones as a defender
---
Nokk is and attacking operator invisible‚Äù to normal cams, Valk cams, Maestro cams, Mozzie drones and maybe even Echo drones
---
The game after I got my rank was the worst. I got toxic teammates that didn't even call out and blamed my friend for everything. I carried them and still lost. They were plats and I was gold, I lost over 100 points and deranked. Worst game yet
---
oh, that‚Äôs a gg
---
I mean, Nomad kinda ruined that lineup.
---
D.50 with silencer op
---
It‚Äôs actually not a sniper veil, it‚Äôs used by the J√¶gerkorpset/Danish special forces to break up silhouette during waterborne operations.
---

---
That‚Äôs dope
---
"Horror fantasy".Dude, it's just a trailer. Like Dokka acting "like a boss" in her own trailer.
---
If we assume that she does get invisibility from cameras like Vigil is invisible from drones (I am not sure it's gonna be this simple tbh) in universe she would just have some kind of device through which she can enter a facility/building without being detected by eletronic surveillance.

Why did i try that?

Anyone else suddenly want spaghetti?
---
How are 3 speeds good for the game? They promote a playstyle that removes all of what this game is built on; droning, pre-aiming corners, good crosshairs placement etc. All goes out the window when playing a 3 speed. 
---
They also tend to have strong weapons that aid this playstyle and always are picked for the speed eventhough 90% of other operators have better utility and would likely benefit the team more. Nokk will be another one added to this list if she‚Äôs a 3 speed
---
Was probably just because ‚ÄúHunter‚Äù sounds way cooler to anyone who doesn‚Äôt know anything about danish special forces (probably a lot of people) than ‚ÄúFrogmen.‚Äù
---
Like the 'ea' sound in 'learn'
---
then it's artificially inflated and doesn't actually correlate with one's ability. no point in having high numbers that are innacurate just for the sake of having a high number
---
We actually managed to win with some magic
---
Don't forget now even the droning phase is a horror movie with jumpscare spider and Mozzie chasing behind your drone.... Might as well label the game as "horror tactical shooter" Ubisoft.
---
spaghetti head
---
All bans are final, why are you banned? If i were you id just buy the game again if it is a mistake on ubi side, because its not worth your time unless you stream/a youtuber.
---
IQ Glitchers getting banned?
---
Are you on PC? I know its on console, its bad rn.
---
It‚Äôs not hacking
---
Yeah the link is somewhere in the other comments!
---
What's Nokk's ability/gadget ?
---
Where‚Äôs the face? The leak said she‚Äôs cute
---
Besides fixing these glitches these guys should do something about DBL Online - A youtuber with over 100k subs and all of his videos are about glitches in R6S and how to use them.
---
You‚Äôre a legend
---
Does anyone know where these operators are going to be from?
---
From what I know, glitching doesnt get you banned. Could be wrong.
---
Where are you getting this idea that twitch mains are playing twitch incorrectly?
---
This operator's appearance is realistic, a lot more so than the four manly men that just received pink unicorn, butterfly, princess, and kitty cat outfits in April.

Why are you banned in the first place
---
well everybody was calling him sir hammerlock (from borderlands 2)  so i assumed  he is black which he totally looks like it in this picture
---
Nokk voiced by norman reedus confirmed?
---
Exploiting glitches and using them for your advantage should definitely be banned
---
Not really, have you tried to move your K/D once you hit a high level? Im 10x better than when I started and its only gone up .1. We all sucked when we first started, having a smurf is like a second chance, now that you know what you're doing
---
Nope no date they have just said they are working on it looks like I won‚Äôt be playing for a while
---
Thats not bragging, thats called showing your qualifications to discuss technical aspects. Kinda like if someone were to mention their medical doctorate when discussing a health topic.
---
Thats still op. This would be akin to anyone near vigil being invisible to drones. you could just load up iq + ash + nokk for op entry fragging.
---
RIP spawnpeaker or frost or kapkan.
---
I mean it‚Äôs possible, we‚Äôll just have to wait for the reveal. He looked white in the other teaser though, and the lighting in this photo is strange.
---
Go back to /r/incels
---
i'm not a spawn peeker, and i play for fun and tatic, not meta. i dont care who is A or S, i play whoever i want or will complement the team already picked.
---
Ya see I do understand what you are trying to say. And I am sorry for accusing you of what I did.   But it would still be a deagle because that‚Äôs what the make is.   I understand where you are coming from and what you‚Äôre saying 100%, I didn‚Äôt understand what you meant by functionality for a bit tho. But the smaller deagle that she has is still a Deagle it may not be a D50 but it will be a D something . The game will still call it a deagle. The way it looks I guarantee everyone will call it a deagle.  I can almost bet that you yourself will call it a desert eagle. You may not classify it as a desert eagle. But it is still a desert eagle
---
I really want to explain it and help you out but I just can‚Äôt figure out what you‚Äôre trying to say
---
If i was to stop my teammates i would kill them before they could do it
---
Never thought they‚Äôd add the dancer of the boreal valley into siege ngl
---
You put too much effort into that answer
---
Yeah am about to do that but that's dumb i got banned for toxic behavior but the thing is i didn't get temparary bans before i just got this perma instantly. :/
---
wait they‚Äôve revealed the defender too? I‚Äôve only seen stuff about Nokk
---
TE SECABO
---
We tf2 now bois
---
IQ one too. Don‚Äôt play till they fix it bro
---
Yeah doesn‚Äôt mean there has to be 50/50 female and men. It‚Äôs fucking stupid.
---
No one's pushing anything. You just weirdly have an issue with an operator not being male.
---
Actually this game does quite well with avoiding cosplay babe girls
---
~~they missed the opportunity to call it phantom forces and give a shoutout to the only good roblox game~~ idk, its not bad imo.
---
Nice
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs it for the defender at the moment
---
I never glitched anyways
---

You can only do that once, then RFF will be enabled.

Edit: Way better and easier explanation. Just pronounce it like Buck, but with an N instead of B. (If you're going with the Norwegian pronounciation, that is.)
---
Oh look, it's Future Soldier.
---
What‚Äôs the IQ one?
---
Just another glitch
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
I NEEEEEEEEEEEED AN ARMOR BAG
---
‚ÄúSmurfs‚Äù take away the whole point of a ranked game, especially when it‚Äôs higher leveled people throwing games to get easier matches.
---
Nah ur fine lol
---
I TOLD YOU TO STOP BREATHING SO HEAVY, u/SECTORISNOTCLEAR. YOU‚ÄôRE NOT VERY GOOD AT FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS, ARE YOU?
---
ALSO, I CAN SMELL THAT FART. IT‚ÄôS SEPTIC, I WOULD GO CHECK THAT OUT MAN.
---
N√òKK N√òKK.
---
Apparently she can turn invisible and just run and hs everybody. Crazy
---
No Ubisoft is. Trying to be equal. And yeah I think it‚Äôs weird when women are in special forces that a made for men.
---
√ò is a short vowel, so more like nukk
---
I much prefer Carlsberg, Legos and bacon but eh.. I'll take it. Thanks!
---
So there's basically no hope i get my acc back?
---
Yeah the art team is completely separate from the balance team so often even the promotional material that ends up being used is old concept art with what they thought the guns might be
---
Are you one of those realism guys
---
Hello forthemasters, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bp55jp/glitching/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
If there is no way to counter the bugs, might as well give them a taste of their own medicine. Besides, we‚Äôre not doing the bug unless an enemy does it
---
It's a bit different
---
Probably 3 speed. Who knows tho
---
It absolutely happens.
---
The game hasn't aimed to be realistic for a long time, and personally I think that's fine. If Siege was just filled with generic army men 24/7 no one would be interested and visually it'd be too boring.
---
The fact that Rainbow showcases a variety of characters with different appearance is one of the many aspects that makes it great, imo.
---
its the same glitch u can do it with just about anyone with a shield. expect echo
---
Needs the vigil drone overlay.
---
that looks like 0 brightness lmao
---
Jager doesn‚Äôt have an acog
---
vigil means staying awake especially at night and like watching over people and shit, so that kinda references his back story of being from north Korea iirc.
---
 ig J√§ger could make sense cuz he kinda hunts the attackers projectiles and shoots them. 
---
As for Zofia, it's the polish version of Sophia which means wisdom. So that kinda references her character especially in contrast to her younger sister ela.
---
Gotta sell season passes somehow.
---
Wallhacks &amp; recoil macros would have sounded stupid to people two years ago...
---
Are you fucking blind? You must be a special type of retarded to not see the glitch being exploited.
---
Hot
---
Tiring
---
Trust me dog. Nobody's gonna miss Clash or Deployable shields. And this is coming from someone who using the deployable shield religiously
---
See there's a difference between playing strategically, and holding the same angle for 1 1/2 minutes while the defuser is on the other side of the map, and going to get it when there's 15 seconds left.
---
Yeah I know!! I saw that it made me upset in the stomach
---
Dont know for sure but Id guess thats the case, we will know for sure soon enough.
---
~~Been there~~ am there. I feel you
---
They will not get banned, they never ban for abusing a glitch
---
I saw the Nokk teaser on Twitter so they combined cav, vigil, and the girl from the ring into an operator on attack. I'm gonna shit myself when SATAN WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE BREACHES INTO MY ROOM.
---
Somewhat. My pops is a military historian. And i wasnt trying to be like ‚Äú MaH ReAlIsm‚Äù i was just genuinely surprised
---
Sorry. I‚Äôm busy right now and I just read it quickly and responded from my phone. I‚Äôll edit it
---
Is Nokk Danish or something
---
Is it just me or does N√∏kk sound more norwegian than danish??
---
I bet if the report button actually worked that would be something
---
Let's never forget the Ballad of King Buttfucker.
---
People already complain too much about not hearing attackers and such get ready for this mf to pop out and shit on your whole team
---
Still having college classes when literally everyone else is out/graduated is demoralizing
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt @ me
---
&gt;Remember I said it 
---
ü§î
---
I do not need to sexualise my pillows. I like them normal.
---
I dont know, the Dollar Flu and the Dark zone are really good story points, that and the rouge agents and hunters are all very appealing ''Bad guys'' to me. The narrative of the games are very skewed as most people dont listen to all the extra content and whatnot and all they get from the story are the pretty crappy cutscenes and the choppy radio chatter during missions. That aside however, it was just a comparison on how the equipment looks similar to the ISAC watch piece, no need to break out the capslock.
---
DIE DIE DIE?
---
Ying, flashbangs, claymores, nades vertical play.
---
its no good
---
Hue har hue har funnay tachunkie maymay is big god!!! I'm litarelly xd'ing out my xd hole rn lmao!!!!111!!1!1!111
---
Take away IQs claymore. Poof. Problem solved.
---
Disable deployable shields. Problem solved.
---
As for Clash, you can just get rid of her all together.
---
I really enjoy meming clash though with the flip strat... I say remove her ability to pick up barbed wire that has been placed already
---
From that video it sounds almost like Nook, but with more of an uh sound. Interesting
---
In these cases they should just disable the broken chars until they have a fix
---
Yea that‚Äôs fair, I usually play buck and Sledge from above. Maybe IQ and Thatcher could be closer
---
Am not there. But existance is pain. I hope your life gets better
---
Report the players, ubisoft suspended a large amount of people abusing it on xbox last night (:
---
And Maestro
---
(I've no idea your genders so...) I pronounce you, married
---
Look's more like the girl from 'The Ring'
---
The Neanderthal society is too underrepresented in this game, the only one of that race is Ash. Therefore, we need more of them, Swedish people don't even exist lol
---
Unfortunately it can‚Äôt be transferred
---
It‚Äôs okay, I get it *wink*
---
ah fuck
---
Its what I feared the most after seeing the trailer..
---
Game been out for 5 or 6 years already..  it's easy to get new operators so don't think your missing out of you don't get the "premium edition"
---
Thanks coreross. I didn‚Äôt know you were in Reddit. Huge fan of the channel and I‚Äôll be sure to check the video out. Thanks for the information. üòÄ

What does he do?

Hello imdylanr6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bp57z0/clash_shield_glitch_should_receive_the_same_ban/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
The fact that you get 60 points at that rank is much better than me sitting at plat 2 winning 4 points a game and losing 30.
---
Same thing happened to me but form gold 1 to plat 3
---
Oooooh üòé‚ù§
---
Her name is Attacker Vigil and there's nothing you can do to change my fucking mind
---
And is a division agent
---
Ok
---
Ubisoft doesn't  ban for toxic.  They just have report buttons.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
---
It will next week
---
*I‚Äôm the spook bitch now*
---
Should I just get the cheapest edition possible then? I‚Äôm not gonna be a hardcore player in any event but would I be at a disadvantage then?
---
Here's a funny thing about artists: untill you pay them, they can and will draw what ever they want.
---
Also, there are probably a ton of female artists out there that like to draw the male ops as well, though I don't quite understand why the gender of the artist is important when looking for cool art
---
They will ‚Äúreview‚Äù it (if at all) and then leave it at that.
---
My whole squad did
---
Not to mention server connection errors
---
Look I know it‚Äôs the Denmark op but I just thought it kinda looked like the division watch
---
Nothing to do with nokk but I would like a atk op that can blend into any wall/floor for a couple of seconds but can only use pistol
---
I couldn't agree more I just went up against a team exploiting just about anything they could to win after we stopped them the first couple rounds
---
Good. Had the same issue a few days ago
---
Just imagine the memes
---
r/thathappened
---
Yeah it happens way to much,  you enter a game and half your team dies in the first 10seconds and get pissed off at you for living and playing. The community as a whole is very toxic in R6S. Trolls, Griefers, Clash Exploiters, hackers and team killers. The game really hasn't changed much in 3-4years.
---
This is why traps are the best friend for a defender

Hello fvillain, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bp591u/eu_servers_unplayable_right_now/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
True, lmao
---
how about my smurf on console?
---
and they say r6 isnt a horror game
---
It's the gaming community in general. It's just toxic as fuck. When siege really blew up the community went downhill
