I had a similar issue, I shot out a Kapkan trap and it showed on my screen that it broke but when I ran through the door way the non-existent Kapkan trap went off. I also would throw lesions and they'd show that they were thrown but they'd just disappear instead.

Idk but I feel like the only rook player to place armor AS SOON as the round starts, and I make sure to ping the shit out of it because there's always those Ela and Cav's that immediately leave the obj

Well I‚Äôm gonna go get me a ps plus card (again)üòÇ

Maybe you havent bought any boosters and bought alpha packs here and there. I have all the ops on my alterante account. Did you use your uplay tokens to buy 3 and a 7 day booster? Grinding terrorist hunt albeit boring can net you tons of renown in just a few hours.

Easiest way to counter it is to not walk in front of the spawn peeker. The opposite spawn on this map is superior in every way for this purpose.
---
Gridlock is great, highly underrated. Kate Dos got a rework
---
aussie aussie aussie XD
---
I see your point, but hostage is a game mode that's supposed to slow the players down. The hostage is supposed to be this fragile thing that both sides have to protect in one way or another, and it's designed to add a bit of caution to the gameplay. Like because my gadgets, guns, and grenades will also effect this other person potentially losing the game for us I should probably think more about how I'm gonna go about this. At least that's what I think about it any way.

If it's stupid and it works, it was stupid and you got lucky.

it‚Äôs ok i just think it‚Äôs kinda funny

Hostage should be treated like an ally to the defenders.

It's ok. Just some tips; don't have so many zoom-ins, it takes the attention away from the actual kill. Also pistol one-taps aren't enough to make a video in my opinion. They get boring reeeaaaal quick, so maybe have a few other types of kills. Anyways, that's just my 2-cents.
---
Well you know, if you maybe read my comment you can see I wasn't even triggered by you calling me a n√∏kk main. I could care less because it's Reddit and who gives a shit what main I am. You see how many tachanka "mains" there are running around?
---
I'm moreso annoyed by the fact that this many people seem to think that it makes you "good" if you can win a 5v1 while going 100% effort in a TEAM game! It's honestly baffling, but, that said, it's Siege and the community isn't the brightest.

You initiated Revival process before the falling animation. Falling is not considered as character movement in R6. It should but right now it is not. Hence why you were able to revive her

He's a dev for a video game. Not a public official. Why should it matter?

Did you just assume a Siege player wouldn‚Äôt blame his own shortcomings on others? (In this case its clearly Thermite‚Äôs fault for not killing Frost BEFORE)
---
Oh God why didn't he reload after firing that much

I understand the pain, and it sucks that we have to do that to not get tked or spammed
---
Dont you have to start a new account in Siege though?
---
Corporate needs you to find the difference between these two pictures
---
Ah yes because you arnt the only one its okay. 
---
The game isnt enjoyable when you are matched against people with similar skill? So you go verse people who are way worse then you? You do know it makes it less enjoyable for them right. 
---
Playing against people who no the map like the back of there hands and flick to the head leaves no room for improvement. Getting a lucky kill on a smurf because they misplayed while 14-0 doesnt help me get better at all. What does help me get better is coming against people within my skill range and constantly winning and losing battles.
---
Look at the end of the day you are going to do what you are gonna do. You know its wrong i know its wrong. but if you don't enjoy high eleo then there is likely a problem with the game too. Unless you just like being the best in a lobby.

You can't.

Is that the barricade builder thing?

bruh i thought this was like concept art for her nice cosplay

Her scorpion is the only primary without a proper recoil diamond so they're kinda right saying it's bad. That's really my main problem with her asides that she literally has no point to be played over anyone else as she just does everything worse than the others.

Don't lose your cool over him. He loves to pick fights over literally anything and doesn't accept defeat when actually proven wrong. He's a good mix of delusion and sillyness.
---
Regardless, 9th is wrong. There is no official post by ubi stating that it is 9th or even 10th, just that pilot program releases on 10th.
---
That whole interaction was stupid
---
Ultron intensifies
---
Hahah this was me and my team!
---
Yeah
---
No! Ranked is a ginormous mess right now with these shitty maps. They‚Äôre just removing 3 of the most hated maps in R6S history.
---
I feel like they should make ranked more balanced and actually better before throwing in random maps. Name ONE map that has been removed was a bad idea!
---
So this game is only supposed to be shaped around how the highest ranks perform?
---
battlepass is just people paying for charms/skins, and they've been doing that already with the many many events we've had already
---
I guarantee you Ubisoft does not care about what copper-silver players think
---
By the same logic, why d you go to school or college. Why don't you just " look it up on search bar" ? XD
---
I prefer the 'X' when I wallbang someone *oof*
---
I've never really had trouble with directional audio in this game
---
Because the maps that are being removed produce an unfair advantage to one side.
---
Hereford for instance has a 65% win rate on defense. highest ever. All others top out at 54-57.
---
Meme park is getting reworked next season, so they took it out in preparation for that.
---
Fortress has l hallway issues which obscure call outs. Hereford hallway is a maze, and mazes also have the same issue.
---
Chalet and skyscraper each have bad layouts and 1 viable site. Chalet for instance, has the problem where all 3 staircases can be covered from one single angle. It is VERY bad.
---
3 round rotation exists to provide a means for the player to correct his mistake again. Regardless of this, a ranked map needs 3 viable sites. The maps that are being removed don't have that.
---
Oh, and please don't bring up yacht. That map has flat zero vertical play other than a handful of hatches. No destructible floors or ceilings, barely any window play, and what not. With the current defender utility we have, it would be heavily defender sided like Hereford is today.
---
Ranked needs balance. THAT'S what's needed to make ranked great again.
---
"So they beat you this time. But how many grenades did you throw? Did you count them? Really. Ask yourselves 'Did I throw all the grenades I could?"
---
Oof
---
I guess now it 20000
---
There will be a free one and a paid one separately
---
Just use the same ubisoft account and maybe steam account and it will transfer everything
---
Does it drop later today or tomorrow?

Oh, didn't realize it was that simple. Thx

Then why would you call this guy a loser for being gold 2? My fault for assuming you were obsessed, but I am tired of the community treating each other like shit.
---
As all things should be
---
I saw 2 angles from that map, and my next game was litteraly this map
---
Was able to use the angle where if your in the hallway you can peek the hatch, and that‚Äôs what I did, got 2 kills for it
---
Ah okay sweet! Glad to see you‚Äôre still playing video games lol. I don‚Äôt know if you remember me. We used to play freaking call of duty on the Wii! üòÇ

Lets first start off with on how you're 876 hours in and yet you're only level 144 and Bronze 1?

Either way their gadgets are useless in this scenario. Their pistols dont even have sights that would be affected by thatchers emp and both like it dark anyway.

Oddly enough that's a funny idea

If it does it should go after your highest

I forgot to mention the squeakers :p

Do you mean without acog?
---
I like to set up trap spots with her mines and the deployable shield. Pick a narrow corridor where people are forced to push up to you, wait for the mine to go off and pop out with the shotgun. Works 100% of the time if you pick the right spot. She's like a more active kapkan.
---
Absolutely. Once you get to gold 1ish things start to become a LOT more even.
---
Yokai gets the points since Yokai did all the work, not Echo
---
Well yeah, should've been more specific

In the common editor for your  videos you can only clip one part in the whole, but not like showig the beginning, cropping the middle and showing the end. I hooe you know what I mean
---
One word: free weekend
---
Problem with that is your concentration would be divide between to things and in R6, where moments can be tense and require your utmost focus, it can result in your death.

If you are solo-queuing then clutch = kick

What's with this community and uwu stop

What kind of project is this? Is this a mod for offline siege or something?

Yes, this will be the 2nd season with soft MMR reset

It's both, You were able to ADS in time and lucky enough the bullet hit the guy and didn't miss or disappear into thin air
---
Shootout at the Overlook Hotel.
---
That's more than just bad luck lmao you got the deluxe edition of it
---
Don't step on it, it will kill you
---
That would literally be their balancing though, forcing you be constantly aware of both directions. I'd say the main issue is that if someone gets the drop on you from behind then knowing they're there a split second before they drop you doesn't really help.
---
It actually isn‚Äôt though. It seems like it‚Äôs limitless unless you actually want to see the entire fucking world get smashed, but it only has 25 charges I believe. 
---
This is probably because you could theoretically cause an actual debris/lag problem on some random part of the map while everyone else is fighting otherwise. Either that or to discourage sledges from just trolling and breaking half the map. It just rolls over into t hunt.
---
you are not alone

I reckon it'll be about 6pm GMT like the other updates but not sure what that is in other timezones

Ranked is bomb only
---
Sorry for posting my thoughts. Sucks yours don't really matter too much to me.
---
What do you mean "ungrateful" you colossal dickhead.  Get Ubi's knob out of your gob.  I've bought the game and paid for quite a few extras.  The least they can do is provide a stable service.  Oh, and aside from them being so shit they can't protect their servers, they also toast my 8600K so that it runs at 80% causing stutter.
---
You're not wrong, it's only spectator mode.
---
F
---
So original.
---
Its still Ubi's fault.  They should ditch them if they can't prevent ddos.  If they can't prevent it, then they need to detect it and perma ban accounts.
---
Lol at first I read this wrong and thought you were openly asking for rank boosters like wtf
---
epic gamer moment for sure
---
How Siege should be played. Fuck 'mains'
---
I'm not on console, I'm on PC.  I've been gaming for over a decade - FPS, MOBA, RTS - have never seen ddos before this game.
---
Tham moment when you‚Äôre so bad the game takes your rank away.

Go to the club challenges on Uplay, see how many hours left before it expires. That's how much time left before next season launches.

Hello jimmy_gary_adam, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d1oz6k/nasty_spawn_peaks_and_one_taps_rainbow_six_siege/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Free weekend get them into the game then when it‚Äôs close to the season sale and boom more players more money
---
r/woooosh
---
to be fair, it's a pretty poor design that you have to do this before putting down a window that is supposed to pop out the soft wall in front of it...
---
It should be fixed.
---
Ya I guess.
---
Imagine a black ice Monty shield with a black ice uniform and head gear with a black ice magnum. Literally the equivalent of hacking.

---
When does thw season start? Will there he another season? Hav they lealed the ops?
---
Duuuuude thatd be hella awesome
---
Longer matchmaking times :
---
#I am gonna end this man's whole career
---
Some people don t mind ongoing matches
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure most people prefer starting 0-0 then join mid game
---
Well that's interesting question for Y4S4 operators
---
They basically disconnect everyone from the server and record who was in it.
---
So they can look for players who are constantly in matches that get shut down and determine a next move.
---
It only happens in casual, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs the end of the world just play the remainder and then you‚Äôll hopefully be put in a fresh game, not exactly that big of an issue
---
Thanks
---
Bullshit. There are so many ops that would benefit more from nades.
---
No its not
---
Hold the fuck up
---
Thank you

The only way around it is to have a friend in your lobby

I‚Äôm only getting this on off peak times maybe just wait until more players come on a full squad of 5 friends helps

I think she‚Äôs in a good place right now.

Not well. I can promise you that. But Vegas should be good.

Like....? (Please don't say IQ, I know pengu said the same, but she doesn't need frags)
---
At least they'll be a reason that bullets can penetrate the shield
---
Not a bad idea tbh.

Exactly this.

Fair enough but she has absolutely no utility she needs something

Lmao, well played.

Thank you, it fit so nicely

U feel she needs some more utility

I think game has enough guns but why new ops have lame ones? Amaru with LMG it must be a joke. Just give her o rifle and make everyone happy. 
---
Jager has 416-C so is R6 has the license of 416-C or all HK-416 variants? If R6 has all variant licences then just give an attacker 416 I mean it's one of best assault rifles in the world. Same goes with Nomad's AK-74 and AK-74U.
---
Consoles should officially support m&amp;k and the matchmaking should be input based as you said.
---
Would be the best option, you probably still get m&amp;k players who use and emulator but it'll probably be less
---
pro tip. I used to be just like this. Have spotify alt-tabbed, (or downloaded and opened if your on console) and everytime your waiting for a match or die or something just play some music. Really helped me, especially when you can just turn some music on right after you die a frustrating death.
---
Most of the time I question how I died, this is how.
---
I'm not saying its smart, but you're absolutely right. Ergo, the 2 year long shotgun meta
---
Interesting.. last season from memory came out at around 12-1am on release day. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs 10th of September but not sure whether that‚Äôs US date or ours.

If there is an obvious gap, I will fill it, otherwise I will go for Lesion, Alibi or Ela for fun.

If the rest of the rando squad is hopeless, then I will run Kapkan to at least give them a fighting chance.

Thing is, I did this to show you how annoying this kind of behavior is. You saying pot calling the kettle black just proves that I made my point. I don't normally correct people unless its someone close who I know wants to improve their skills in that particular subject. Maybe stick to that as well.
---
J√§ger: I've got your back
---
J√§ger died, so he could save you
---
I mean,,, just report them for toxic behavior, if I i finds a problem with what they‚Äôre doing they do something. On one hand people can just be inexperienced (especially with the huge rank difference in queueing this season) so they could just not know what to do, and they shouldn‚Äôt be punished for that. If you feel it‚Äôs intentional, report them and move on,That‚Äôs all we really can do.
---
What hardware do you play on?

My best was roaming theme park and sledging cavvie as she was interrogating ash then getting one accidental through a wall. (I dont deserve that one)

Nice,cant wait for ember rise coming out in the year 3020
---
Basically use your utility to waste as much of the attackers time as you can. If you use it right, they should only get a general idea of where you are. Once they do use that to reposition yourself into a situation where you can either get a kill, or make them second and third guess where you moved to. 
---
Main AR and smg 12 are the usual. Impacts for fast escape and rotations. Non-comparable to cav

Rainbow Six is the name of the game franchise. there's others, like rainbow 6 Vegas

You should ask if they want to knife, often they are correct

It's the same because it's based off of a specific thing, of course there wold be little variation.

when does it come out

BrotherS?!
---
Is that 420 r6 credits I see
---
I think I can answer this for you. In terms of his gadget making him invisible to drones is VERY situational using it during the prep phase is generally useless because enemies will still be able to see that you are vigil but feel free to use it anyway since it recharges. The real use for it is for when you are being droned out, the enemies will get a general idea of where you are but not be able to pinpoint you. At this point a master vigil player would be able to be creative with his positioning and catch the enemies off guard. Vigil's uniform is nearly all black so feel free to use that to your advantage. Vigil's loadout is where a lot of people go wrong, yes the BOSG is fun, yes it can 1 shot, but it isn't realistic to use in a gun fight because if you miss even one shot it's pretty much the end. With that being said I would recommend using the K1A with a Holographic, Flash Hider, and Angled Grip because there is almost no recoil and the Holographic has the finest point. As for his secondary that is up to your personal preference, the SMG-12's recoil and the CZ75s limitations are both things to consider. I would also recommend running impact grenades to make yourself quick rotation holes. Generally Vigil is an operator that is easy to learn but hard to master, that is the reason you will see varied success in matches.

Hello unthink1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d1sly1/ubi_please_bring_back_invitational_pack_skins/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Normally I don't teamkill due to how toxic it is but since last night, I've thrown that out the window. We were playing coast line, secure area, defending kitchen. I picked mozzie and started using his shotgun to break a hole above the window. I get shot, turn around, and the guy who shot me is shaking left and right to say "no." I immediately shoot him in the head. You accidentally shoot me, thats fine, it happens but I'm so tired of the intentional ones. I've decided if someone is going to be an asshole and do this, I'm going to TK, every time. This game has been over run with toxicity to the point where I may be putting the game down permanently in the near future. Nothing ruins an amazing game like the player base.
---
I‚Äôm barely showing names, also they‚Äôre DDOSers so who gives a damn, if they wanna remove it they can remove it I suppose
---
this guy has also been spamming on every reply that the new season is coming out on the 17th with no proof.
---
Play casual and practice your gun play, playing with 2 or 3 others helps too
---
Why ?
---
I have 300 hours and I haven't done this yet
---
Some are saying it's been delayed for Sep/17th.
---
I‚Äôve had to restart the game a couple times because of the audio completely flipping. I would have people I‚Äôm playing with walk or shoot next to me (outdoors as well) to make sure I wasn‚Äôt going completely crazy.
---
You called?
---
I‚Äôm very inconsistent also, I can get 13 kills one match, then only get 5 the next
---
\*Op if they don't have a hardbreacher.

Is it still available? I'd buy the fuck out of this if so just for ironic comedy

Thanks will do comrade

they lost 6-8, and the title is literally referring to that game.

People say it's tomorrow (According to their intuition) but the reality is that there is no officially confirmed date.

I completely disagree with the whole recoil thing, nearly every single weapon that has a recoil pattern is just a slight variation of left, right, or center. It's not like any of them are that. Complicated.

My roles that i play are fragger on atk and def.

Sure, but there‚Äôs only one peek I can think of that you can been seen immediately after spawn. All the others you‚Äôre able to play around.

If you lose a couple drones, it can be hard to keep your eye on all popular run outs though.

It isn't a delay if it was never publicity announced to come out on a specific date.

???

Bro is Ubi isn‚Äôt including literally every possible configuration of the AR15 down to every different hand guard made by the 100s of manufactures that make them, it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt even give a shit. I need to be able to pick up an AR with a 14.5‚Äù barrel, a Geissele hand guard, AAC brake, BCM grip, and Magpul stock.

I was about to be so fucking mad if you didn‚Äôt flip it all the way over to see if it activated. Thank you

believe so i didnt get it

I don‚Äôt do anyway weeklys and I get it about once a week but I also play a minimum if 3 hours a day
---
Increase brightness
---
Sit closer
---
NOT CONFIRMED YET.
---
It's not delayed. Not confirmed yet.
---
It can come out tomorrow. It can come out next week. It's not confirmed yet by the official R6 Twitter account.
---
And since it isn't confirmed,it can't be delayed.
---
Tomorrow.
---
Consider getting your vision tested and let them know about your eye strain issues.
---
Cav and jackal not that I think they are op or anything I just hate been interrogated, or tracked
---
What did he do to get that reverse friendly fire?
---
Aight, I guess I'll hop into my smurf then haha thx &lt;3
---
Implying Doc players actually use their gadget on anyone but themselves
---
But he's mostly correct, sometimes, he becomes an asshole, he previously said the 10th, but it may or may not be delayed, he's saying its purely speculations
---
They realized that we don‚Äôt have friends and wanted to be nice
---
Also, some strats require running out of map in the first 10seconds.  
---
Like valk cams, maestro placements, lesion mines, etc.
---
Should be tomorrow.
---
However, after the season releases, the season pass holders have 7 day exclusive access to the new operators. Everyone else has to wait 7 days until they can purchase the new operators.
---
Playing it now
---
Hook the Xbox up to your regular pc monitor.
---
If that‚Äôs actually true then I need them
---
I solo queue a lot and I‚Äôd say I get pretty decent luck on getting one teammate willing to play an op that‚Äôs needed. I have to go Thatcher and ask for a hard breacher or go hard breacher and ask for a Thatcher though, can very rarely go something else and count on two teammates bringing those two. 
---
My luck on having that teammate actually do his job before dying isn‚Äôt so great though.
---
Valve* lmao
---
Warden is still terrible.
---
GIMME THE BOOST FINKA AAAAAAHHHHHHH
---
I don't think you know what toxicity is
---
I know, i just call them Volvo like most people i know

Their price will be lowered I suppose.

So is this G8 change(+100 rounds) alongside it getting the angled grip or instead of it?

I talking about the shotgun itself, not the ace.

But the shotgun isn't toxic, it's just powerful
---
Thanks :)

Games are competitions and competitions are games, theyre tests of the players skill, if not, if they dont require effort, theyre a waste of time.

I think I‚Äôll lay down for a bit, let claymore do the rest

Awesome!!

I agree with all of that except the rigged alpha packs. Ubi didn't put the MP5 black ice in an alpha pack for Marley, they just gave it to him.
---
Holy shit! Which class/equipment is this? I'm part of the wave of noobs.
---
topless warden
---
Thank for the feedback
---
appreciate it
---
Shut the fuck up
---
It is toxic, it‚Äôs too overpowered.
---
Yeah, Maverick is going down to 20k and Cav to 10k
---
A lot of people might disagree with me when I say this but I‚Äôd hop straight into ranked as soon as you can. Ranked isnt free of toxicity but it‚Äôs definitely better than casual
---
Draw some of that sweet hentai stuff. Like the operators fucking and stuff.
---
Thanks for the comments :)
---
That‚Äôs what I was about to say.
---
NOT CLICKBAIT!!!!!
---
But the gun isn't toxic, it's the player behind it.
---
The Warden buff is a good step in the right direction but why not give him smokes? Ik defenders don‚Äôt have smokes but it‚Äôd make sense for him to be able to actively use the smoke ability instead of only being able to use it when an attacker throws smokes
---
another point could be the fov. 
---
when i play on a fov that i'm not used to (especially first person games) it really hurts my eyes as well after a while. maybe try messing with your field of view?
---
Sometimes I'm facing the bomb and touching it or am right next to it and it doesn't acknowledge that I've found it, and on Xbox half of the time I can here the echo of guns, but not the initial 'bang' or the sound of the reload. 
---
Not as important as some of the things that you pointed out but still pretty annoying.
---
Yo that's hella gay
---
Along side
---
This is as evil as spawnkilling with lord tachanka on the Christmas looking map
---
Yeah the community is pretty AIDS. Everyone loves to shit on, team kill, and/or kick players for being new or bad, or even for having a bad game or making a mistake. Hopefully the new unranked mode coming soon will help some.
---
Not much you can do but one thing I‚Äôd suggest is maybe a little ‚Äúhey guys just a heads up, I‚Äôm still pretty new and learning‚Äù at the beginning of a match. You might see a lot of the scrubs that play casual and think they‚Äôre the shit stroke their ego by helping you and feeling super smart instead of by being toxic towards you.
---
In the form of an alpha pack... If they can control who gets what in an alpha pack, what's stopping them from having a system in place denying or rewarding your account whatever content based on, performance, placement in ranked, toxicity level, overall level, K:D, etc.
---
Something to think about.
---
just use the acog
---
When I first played I knew for some time that I was going to be a Thatcher main, my first attacking round starts and well what do you know, I get a fucking ace.

Oh, this is my first season actually diving in so I didn‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôm guessing the prices go down the longer the ops are in the game?

It wasn't in the form of an alpha pack...it was just in his inventory.

So I was playing on a smurf to help teach a friend who is new to the game. I was playing a phone game at the same time to lower my already trash skill. I found this dude in the new comer playlist. There are a few things I learned about this playlist.
---
1: Ton of smurfs on Xbox
---
2: If not for map knowledge, actual new players would be better than me cause I can't aim.
---
3: You can play the new comer playlist until lvl 50, but you can play ranked at lvl 20 and, in turn, find people like this.
---
Just to put it out there, my highest, with a team, has only been gold 3. I'm typically low silver.
---
I'm aware that I'm part of the issue by playing on a smurf, but the fact that you can have plats and diamonds, that are that rank on a smurf, and still play this playlist, is pretty messed up.

That‚Äôs fair I agree dude u didn‚Äôt think of the three speed thing that could work and I guess it would boost how well she can frag
---
I agree, I main mostly vanilla ops. I do like to toss in some capito and nomad in there. Mostly I play rook/jager/bandit, ash/thermite
---
You just install it from the uplay library
---
Oh rip I can‚Äôt try help if you‚Äôre on xbox
---
Snake_Nade is literally a top 3 Siege streamer, where is his charm?
---
Run Rainbow six siege in offline mode . You will play with all the operators then . But only custom match is available
---
I like the idea of where you are coming from but i have one question: how are you going to get on the train, unless it stopa
---
For a special mode like (Showdown or saving mr Bear) i would love to see it and play it just like you described it but I'd hate to see it in rank because it would favour Defense more than offense it would be an one sided map.
---
Honestly
---
Nah. That's what she originally had which is why I never used the LMG. It had so little ammo for some reason.
---
Play the situations and you can test some of the year 1 ops
---
Wouldn‚Äôt say a new player should be playing smoke or thatcher
---
Damn that really makes people mad
---
This is funny honestly
---
i'm planning on it
---
No. Fuck shields. Their ads time should be on par with lmg's.

Anyone saying that is lying. Warden can be useful while tachanka can't actually do anything important

Outback is a good map and if you think about the maps in the game we already have like yacht and plane are the same structure, keep in mind both of these aren‚Äôt in ranked which proves a train map wouldn‚Äôt work because maps like it were tried and were proved to be horrible.

Hello LatvianViking, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d1v5qg/question_about_ps4_network_issue/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
This would be impossible in the Siege engine.
---
Next idea please.
---
Shake my head 12 times
---
yeah this idea will never happen. not only is it just a bad idea but also the data limits and engine limitations wouldn‚Äôt work with it either. so no. 100% not.
---
&gt; Porter was not an academic, although in secondary school, he excelled in science. He took a particular interest in biology and the unit on dissection
---
&gt; Porter is a thrill seeker with very little regard for his personal safety. He is fearless in battle and can be a great asset for defensive maneuvers. However, he seems to enjoy the havoc and chaos of war.
---
&gt; ...more comfortable to play with
---
Always primary never shotgun
---
Lol. Yeah i could never control that gun, I've only realized its power now.
---
I did this last year in school too lol but it was with fortnite because it was the only game I played. (Sad I know)
---
I do that all the time in Siege. I don‚Äôt feel like trying sometimes.
---
For a fast pased competitive game like Siege, High refresh rate does wonders.
---
He literally wrote /s
---
Report them to the console as well. I had to deal with a lag switcher the other day, and my entire squad reported him to Microsoft and ubisoft. He even admitted it because a couple guys messaged him about it, and he said "How did you know I was lag switching". Like its not obvious when one guy has a ping of 9 and the everyone else is jumping from 50 to 2900. Legit question tho, are there also people that make the servers kick people? I was having the game of my life the other day and the entire server kicked my full 3 man out, then we could barely get back in and it just repeatedly kept messing up until it kicked every single person in the final round and it started acting like the game just didn't happen.
---
Sure, I think I will do Blitz (first request) then Ela, ok?
---
Well the E-Sports bundles are supposedly due tommorow and we were told they would launch with Ember Rise ....so idk man I think it's out tommorow , won't be disappointed if it's not though
---
Sounds hilarious, sure!
---
Any tips on how to play them without a shield?
---
I mean, place cams -&gt; hide -&gt; pew pew -&gt; POW POW POW if enemies are too close to your nest. This is pretty easy and good tactic.
---
Isn‚Äôt ember rise supposed to release today?
---
He just said himself the Pc isn‚Äôt strong enough. There‚Äôs probably a reason why he plays on Xbox.
---
I like iq and twitchs more
---
Buck. Favorite skins, and outifts are on Buck.
---
Thanks for the idea
---
Mozzie is good, so is outback and Kafe rework. The bonuses are the main value of the pass anyway, plus if you were to buy ops separately it would be 40 bucks.
---
üÖ±Ô∏è
---
I've always thought it would be cool to be able to set them to either shoot off in succession like they do now or set them all off at once. So instead of 5 grenades one at a time, its 5 at once. Or just make it a throwable so he doesnt have to be separated from the rest of his team on a site execute. That's his big weakness. I know I compare him to gridlock a lot but they are the most similar to each other and that's why she is so strong. Everything she does with her gadget is done together with her teammates.
---
Happens a loooot more than you think it does
---
It's down for me too. Went from a nice 9ping to 83-100 now :(
---
They're so easy to deal with though, so I don't understand why people think they're annoying. Lesion and Echo can both be countered by IQ. Jackal is so easy to bait once he pings you, and Cavy kinda just sucks.
---
Are you on PC? Go to your game settings in the files and scroll all the way to the bottom and check if your data center is correct. Sometimes the game puts me in asian servers randomly and I have to manually change it back.
---
Did you thank the jager afterwards
---
They probably have. They just don't want to reveal it yet.
---
*‚ÄùRemember- we are the hunters, they are the prey.‚Äù*

Who is that? I would love to get the dog charm!

My pleasure
---
The shield/trap idea wasnt really that good before but it will be even more useless now with Goyo and Shield 2.0 in the game. Everyone is just going to destroy shields instantly now because they might be a Goyo shield or someone might be behind it ready to peek you.
---
Lion. Neat Loadout And Gadget, Interesting Backstory, And He Has Some Good Uniforms.
---
Yea, fuck people who play the game. They should've all gone recruit and pushed upstairs instead rite.

Idiot

They can buff it it really just needs better recoil
---
He is a Korean streamer. I thought people like them are popular but still "minor" compared to other siege streamers

I really want a shotgun skin, it's about time the SAS shotgun got one

I‚Äôm m a jackal main on console ez plat 2

This is sort of still Michael Myers though? Lol

Exactly it‚Äôs too easy üòÇ
---
Lol exactly. I have no clue why people think putting wire in them is a good idea
---
This is very similar to this years planned Halloween event. Should be a fun week or two
---
The two biggest reason people want to give Warden the P90 are 1) It has an ACOG giving Warden at least a semblance of range and 2) The P90 is a staple weapon of The US Secret Service and thus giving it to the Secret Service operator would make thematic sense.
---
Not sure if I personally agree with either reason, but hey at least they aren't trying to give him an overpowered weapon.
---
I really don't see a reason to banish mav from existence, I'm trying to be impartial don't think that I'm asking because of my flair

Hello Myphhz, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d1w9lb/rainbow_six_siege_montage/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
But when i open the game with wifi off it wont let me play a custom game...
---
J√§ger and Ash, lovely guns and 3 Speed.
---
What if I'm on console
---
Make Fuze a 2 speed - that would make him attractive
---
Ooo thank you thank you
---
You‚Äôll still get it. You just have to link the Uplay account you use on console to your twitch account. If you have amazon prime you can sub for free as well.
---
Probably Thatcher and Valk, just for the team aspect of it. I'm fairly shit at the game for the most part, so helping the team in little ways is basically the best I can do.
---
Yeah but it's different
---
Well
---
[removed]
---
Uhh
---
It runs in the family if you know what i mean
---
I made a concept of a similar operator, attacker, has syringes, when he approaches corpse he injects a liquid to revive the dead for a maximum of 60 seconds, with 80% health
---
Yup! And one for Interrobang
---
You have to link your psn/xbl to your uplay account
---
1 problem i see so far with this is that this would increase teamkilling for example someone mains ela and ela gets taken the ela main could pick this operator tk the ela pick up the kit and play as ela-ish
---
Hmmm yes. It appears I should.
---
It's on favela and it's a ace clutch on defence! I'd say that's pretty damn impressive
---
If I were them I would flank me out side of the window I was next to
---
There was a visual change to the way the guns kick. They haven‚Äôt had any recoil change.
---
Not really trolling. I agree it is kinda idiotic but that's how it is.
---
Yeah guys lets make it so the defenders can have 5 ACOGs! This is a great idea!
---
That‚Äôs fuckin dirty lmao
---
dear diary......
---
Apparently not. Look how many people were saying Monday.
---
Also the TTS does 3 weeks early now not 2
---
Ya but you know. Not funko pops.
---
No VPN same issue. It's odd. My buddy is also being put on WUS when we solo que, we both live on the east coast.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean. I understand the recoils themselves are the same but the animation seemed to be less ‚Äúintense‚Äù
---
The number of locations you can effectively impact trick is not so overwhelmingly large to make it worth dedicating.  As for rotations, other operators will likely be able to serve the purpose of impacts, and for his shotty one clip can create a passable rotation for me through a wall.
---
We can agree to disagree, but what is true is anything c4 can do impacts can do and vice versa for the most part.  Other gadgets would provide versatility to his kit.
---
Perhaps the code you are using is already used, I got my version on clearance specifically to finish the entire collection as I already had an advanced edition from way back summer 2018. If you bought the game and the code doesnt work for you then you should still be entitled to the contents otherwise other in game or monetary compensation.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs staying, it‚Äôs intentional
---
Zofia 
---
Does everything except hard breach
---
Why are redditors so insanely obsessed with giving every defender an ACOG?
---
Y tho?
---
you can‚Äôt witch hunt here.
---
Just because impacts and C4 both go boom doesn't mean they fill the same role. 
---
Impacts allow Kaid to roam (something it seems like Ubi wants to allow), they allow impact tricking which is becoming an important strategy for high-level breach denial (Kaid is the only dedicated anti-breach operator with impacts). Ubi nerfed his shotgun's ammo capacity specifically to push people away from using it to open rotates and towards using impact grenades for that purpose.
---
We have another anti-breach operator who specializes in drone denial and we even have Mozzie who's entire niche is drone denial. Wasting your secondary gadget and half your primary gadget utility to stop drones as Kaid is pretty inefficient and like I said, nothing is stopping you from doing it with a little teamwork.
---
 In the Wind Bastion TTS they toyed with the idea of making electrified barbed wire much more powerful (15 damage per tick if I remember correctly) but they decided it was far too powerful. After reversing this change, they decided that the barbed wire synergy wasn't really an important part of his kit anymore.
---
Now, the idea that needing teamwork to fulfill your role is "ridiculous" really shows me what sort of headspace you're in. Teamwork is a core fucking element of this game: Thermite needs Thatcher or breachers to counter Bandit. Bandit needs Jager to effectively defend against explosives while tricking. Anchors need roamers to keep map control for as long as possible. Entry fraggers need their team to push up and occupy map control they gain. 
---
This is a team game, if you can't be fucked to ask somebody to put a barbed wire on Laundry stairs I'm not sure this game is gonna provide the experience you're looking for. I say this as a devout solo player.
---
Sorry, just pissed
---
I‚Äôm sorry but what retards
---
Btw what does APC stand for (no I'm not a noob I've been playing since operation health
---
Go Play overwatch. Don‚Äôt take away what little realism this game has left.
---
N√∏kk, that shotgun op
---
I like the red dot, fight me.
---
Good, that's how monty always should have been. Extremely powerful when with a coordinated team (still is) but weak in 1v1s. Monty was by far the best 1v1 op in the game, while also being extremely useful to help with pushing and planting. Shields should not be able to win 1v1s for free. Look at clash. If played correctly and with team support, solid op, you can make some neat strats with her. Defenseless in a 1v1. That is how shields should work, they should never have been the one man armies they are.
---
hmm
---
nice
---
What happened just now to me has actually made me not want to play this game anymore it's the fact me and you have opened hundreds of packs
---
But it's casual so it's a normal thing
---
Its u.s south central
---
When it's released are you going to change your flair
---
No way he‚Äôs only been playing 6 hours
---
Ion?
---
Yup :(
---
I did. I quit because how boring the game was
---
Not really necessary tbh.
---
Nomad is the only "meta" operator in that list.
---
Nomad is also most effective. Nokk doesn't do much for your teammates and a poorly placed Ying can lose your team the round if you flash the wrong person.
---
Nomad is also really fun and her airjabs can be pretty funny
---
Uh no? If you aren't bringing impacts on smoke you're basically throwing, you need them to impact trick or toss at people planting behind cover.
---
yeah looked like you were intentionally going to troll him by killing his drones. what'd you expect? totally deserved this tbh
---
u should post this in r/R6ProLeague since this subreddit only care about memes &amp; cosplay
---
That shotgun is definitely not Op
---
That sucks. I think there are some ones that are like 20$ but ship to the uk.
---
Yup. Practically everything summed up.
---
Yes indeed
---
I did but you can only have it when you buy a nvdia shield, correct?
---
ikr? Fuck the ACOG, it's the definition of a crutch-- I'd be all for it being removed from the game entirely honestly.
---
Mate the difference is i commented on a guy saying the dude on the chat got proved wrong. 
---
Which he didnt. 
---
Context is a lot more important. You corrected some spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Big difference especially because what i said created discussion. Seeing as we are on reddit that is sort of what this site is for. You know discussion. 
---
So pretty massive difference in what we commented.
---
Have you the tale of Darth WouldaCouldaShoulda the wise?
---
I feel Glaz has been nerfed way to much. Removing the claymore is Gunna hurt so much for me with how my team plays. Not much coordination lol
---
Not really? he's fighting bronze console players on a garbage map where aim duels happen every 5 seconds.
---
Don't think I've been this annoyed veen when I've been killed by a try hard in casual üòÇ
---
Nomad, her ability is extremely powerful (a  bit over powered) and her guns are decent 
---
Ying isn't that good after the rework, her LGM is alright 
---
Nokk has a weak ability and a weak gun
---
Ya I'm pretty sure I got mvp and showed off my lesion elite
---
What about a claymore drone
---
What I wanna say is, if they are certain that they really have run into a deadend that they can no longer add any further new weapons to the game. Then they have to start redistributing weapons among the operators.
---
For example, you have to actually take the G8A1 from IQ to Amaru for obvious balancing convenience reason, so you can buff/nerf a weapon without worrying about the consequence of the others. At this point with such a big problem, you should not have any operator with two primary assault/SMG anymore, save the G36C from Ash for someone else, save the AUG from IQ for someone else, save the CAMRS for someone else, save the SR-25 for someone else, save the PDW-9 for someone else, save the AR-15 for someone else, save the AK-74 for someone else, save the P10 Roni for someone else. And then replace those operators that you have taken their second assault rifles/SMG with a CAMRS/SR-25/AR-15 and in the future these will be served as every new operators' alternate primary weapon option along with the 417.
---
Thing is, they didn't do any of these, they just cut off the content suddenly. So, we are really left in the dark.
---
The recoil change you may be referring to was a bug with the vertical recoil animation being less obtrusive than normal. While the recoil itself stayed the same, the actual kick you saw was altered. This, however, was a bug, and I believe has been removed.
---
As for Thatcher, the only thing that comes to mind for this TTS is that now the enemies get a debuff icon, similar to what you'd see from Jackal tracking you, that indicates their electronics are down. The wording of this, however, caused confusion (no surprise there) as it appeared to indicate that you wouldn't be able to use gadgets during the EMPs effect, which would render Bandit tricking nearly impossible. But again, people simply get an indication as to how long the effect has left.
---
TL;DR: no buff to sub smgs and scorpion recoil (animation was changed accidentally), Thatcher's emp now gives a debuff icon.
---
I think it was the aim assist
---
They were not bronze to let you know, the map is heavy attacker friendly and by himself
---
I thought not, it's not a story the bot would tell you.
---
inb4 the entire subreddit does this exact thing with every other operator logo for the next month
---
If you really see no difference between impacts and C4 I can understand why you'd see having both as a bad choice. I'd urge you to reassess. These two gadgets function completely differently and exist for completely different purposes. Just because you can use one sort of like the other and get mixed results doesn't mean the difference is negligible.
---
If you bring FMG over shotgun you belong in bronze.
---
What you meant by open and mederate ?
---
Record and report whenever possible. It‚Äôs unfortunately very much right now on the community‚Äôs shoulders
---
I‚Äôm a month late so apologies for that. But as a sucker for the punk aesthetic in general, god damn that is one ugly animation. I‚Äôm split on the skin itself but wow. Bit of wasted potential tbh
---
That's just potato aim, look at the recoil
---
it‚Äôs been said at least 5 million times there isn‚Äôt anything for them to do.
---
very nice
---
No it's Microsoft and Sony's fault
---
In my opinion they should just let keyboard and mouse players queue with each other
---
$10! I‚Äôm NOT A CHOOSING BEGGAR
---
Jager's ADS has a interception range of 5 meters. So if you're standing on the very edge of that 5 meter distance, and a cooked frag grenade lands a meter away, then you'll still die. All it will do is create a false sense of security, and give people more shit to complain about on this sub.
---
Yeah but I can mow down an entire team with the F2 twice as fast.
---
It's treason then.
---
Not gonna lie that might push me off this game if it continues. On scus I have a 9 ping I go to these servers and I have a 30+ping against players with a 9 ping that have the upper hand on me.
---
because the new shields are overpowered as hell
---
I think he meant on
---
And what was mute doing??
---
Dokkaebi
---
KEEP ALL MAPS ON CASUAL AND ADD A BAN MAP SYSTEM FOR CAS WHERE YOU CAN ONLY BAND A MAX OF 3 MAPS
---
Gotta be honest with you here: impact tricking wasn't something I considered, mostly because I've never seen anyone try it with Smoke.
---
Well then it‚Äôs still in the same country
---
Okay but did that Thermite also put his charge on a wooden barricade?
---
Cake

yes! and Fuzes face mask :)

It has one door, and 3 other entrances that don‚Äôt require hanging on a rappel wire.

I think he's not under contract with ubisoft / esl. At least not a permanent one. It's more like a freelancer thing I guess.

That man was murdered

To put it in your own terms:

As Anakin hated Obi-Wan, this game‚Äôs community hates blitz
---
I agree. And as a Jackal Main I absolutely agree with your earlier point that his pings last too long. Personal I wish we would have 5 total scans but have them only ping once or twice.

who and where should i contact?

Are you on PC?
---
Yes. PC. Sorry for leaving that out.
---
But Favela bad
---
Yeah that makes a lot of sense to me. I am glad Ubisoft has removed a lot of the obnoxious call of duty type things from the game already. Mechanics like drop shotting and crouch spamming are mostly gone or nerfed already which gives me hope that some day they‚Äôll address the 1 hit headshot kills.
---
talk to microsoft
---
Smashed her right in the box.
---
Ubisoft have been tweaking the footstep sounds for a while now. It used to be really loud and it used to be super quiet at one time too.
---
I don't really know if it should be louder or not because it might make rushing too easy and make intel tools less relevant.
---
Fuck. Bartlett.
---
hes using a VM (GeForce Now)
---
No how dare he do that
---
No but they should patch out the silent sprint
---
There already very loud. If you think there low try a different headset. I use the Arctis pro and you can hear them from far away
---
*Knockoff titanic theme*
---
Forget ubi, I'm taking your word for it! Thanks!! Can't wait to play it tomorrow! Thanks dude!
---
Lol wut
---
Can't spell "spawnpeek" without "rook", as I always say!
---
Wow. First of all, with the rng recoil, it makes a lot of headshots just be random bounces to the head. Also it would still be rewarding to go for headshots because there would still be a damage multiplier for them depending on the weapon. DMRs for example would still be able to 1 shot. Also you should be going for center of mass anyway since that‚Äôs whats actually ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù and what soldiers are trained to actually do.
---
He's cost like 500-2000 renown if you have the basic game iirc
---
What did I do
---
Lucky on my schools computers every single site is blocked by YouTube
---
It‚Äôs probably because you were outside so long
---
Everything

This is getting out of hand! Now there are 4 of them!
