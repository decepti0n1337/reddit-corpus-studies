Lmao

---
---
Thank you!! Whatever happens, it was totally worth it. One of the best experiences of my life has been sharing this story with the Siege community over the last year!
---
No they havent.
---

---
Pro league rules involve. Ore then pick/ban and 3 round rotation.
---
I'll add u but I'm not on rn
---
Only if it‚Äôs by a cheater (hacker)
---
Yeah, obviously, I just liked how good the data matched.
---
We had the entire weekend of it to inform them it's bad for general gameplay but great for pro league.
---
I had to go on this sub on either desktop mode for mobile, or just go on this sub and it's on the upper right towards options
---
Okay nomad main
---
mlem
---
It's not a new season if they don't readd a bug or two. This is old school r6s
---
He‚Äôs trying his best give him a break!
---
They get reverse friendly fire
---
Thanks! Ur my favorite mod.
---
You got to admit the siege community has more toxic players than most
---
I think you should just play casual. I dont even understand what is it you are complaining about when you have the perfect gamemode for you already.
---
If only the human brain wasn't flawed.
---
On PC, it's on the sidebar (right side), [juste above the bottom of the picture " (edit) " button](https://i.imgur.com/pw1sRuK.png)
---
Oh, thats horrible. I tought they would get reviewed and maybe banned :(
---
I don't think she's a robot, but I'm not a big fan of the bag on her head. I really wish I hard a mustache like Warden though. Like, I would use him just for that glorious mustache. 
---
Just comparing the design for these two operators, most that come out in pairs share a somewhat similar aesthetic. Warden looks very formal and reminds me of Commissioner Gordon. While N√∏kk makes me think a shy teen whose doesn't want to be recognized at the Hot Topic.
---
Is it just me or is Glaz floating
---
The person who team killed you gets the red triangle next to their name - so now when they shoot someone on their team they take the damage as opposed to the team member
---
Yea he‚Äôs either confused or he‚Äôs a dumb
---
Which they had in the Pro League playlist
---
nah he should be a pizza maker or someone that makes spaghetti and meatballs
---
Thx found it
---
For one single team kill? That‚Äôs a bit extreme.
---
Well shit no worries now my homie just bought me the season pass. Time to fight all the other plebs on my team for Nokk lol.
---
If it does it would be better. What I mean by that is that even if you play at copper you are playing with people that like and understand pvp not pvers, not saying there's something wrong with them but it's just a fact that most of the time pvp mains will be better.
---
Season ‚Äùwe dont care about the glitches haha"
---
Running shotgun suppressed and not the d50 but also suppressed.
---
Maximum spoop
---
I'm ok with bugs popping up. It's that they knew there was a bug, didn't fix it, then put the exploits back in anyway. So you couldn't fix the Clash glitch. Fine, keep working on it until it's done. Don't put her back in anyway and assume it'll be fine.

Get flanked is another man child like kg that wants a career from whining about stuff in video games
---
Well, yea it is but that is not going to change the fact that teamkilling is a huge problem.
---
Time travelling Buck main
---
No, the recoil patterns are the same. It‚Äôs also why using mnk on console gives such a huge advantage despite the input lag.
---
He just came out damn
---
I lost 5 and won 5 got placed gold 3. Confused on how you got silver.
---
Sorry I meant Y3S4* lol
---
I wish they would make it so that when you shot someone in the head you would automatically die if it was intentionally.
---
Why you gotta be like this?
---
Wow. I wish I could go to siege school.
---
Sorry my grammar is horrible
---
OwO
---
Nice man! I cant wait to play hadn't had a chance I was busy playing Bl pre sequel.
---
How is N√∂kk? I cant wait to try her out
---
They removed all the THunt/Situations trophies and replaced them with new ones that are multiplayer focused. A good addition imo.
---
So you just never buy a gamer ever?
---
What about Smokes?
---
Hmmmm no boosting is still bannable no matter what
---
Clash and monty shoot while shield is back on the game so i wouldn't be surprised if IQ starts to reglitch again.
---
Secure area is a great game mode. But continue on with your childish banter because the game mode you like happened to be the one thet kept, while others are upset that their favorite game mode was taken away, and they feel likw they got ripped off paying money for a game that was literally taken away from them. They should have issued an optional refund option for the game along with the new update.
---
Shootout to the two randoms that started all the weird funny tactics, had a great time with them.
---
Its highly implied that she was raised by a single mom and never met her dad so the illegitimate child theory makes a lot of sense.
---
Thought they said they added recoil to it
---
Not even funny. To quote Vincent Vega "What's more chickenshit than fucking with a man's automobile? I mean, don't fuck with another man's vehicle."
---
Just now i get comfy whit using the iron sight
---
I quite like it
---
Ok let me know when your able to play
---
Does it reset for casual at the beginning of the season?
---
If you were any good with Buck it‚Äôs so much easier (at least for me)
---
But Is glaz left handed?
---
And I think that's about it.
---
-Bubba
---
And Fortress. I really, really don't like that map, and of course it was my very first ranked game this season...
---
They don't play multiple matches. You're thinking of LAN events and PL Finals. Actual playdays are only 1 match, and use this exact format.
---
Really? I did not know that. 
---
I would like to amend my previous statement, *the Danish Special Forces look like shy teens that don't want to be recognized at the Hot Topic.* 
---
I'm gonna say it, those bag things look really funny, and I kind of dig it.
---
Nokk would be useful too wouldnt she since she can also be silent even nomad would be useful as well as kaid
---
After the initial kill they will die if they try again
---
According to the graph doing the rounds I should be high silver, as demonstrated by my Grim Sky performance? I'm willing to accept I'm not great at the game but Copper came as a shock!
---
Double poop
---
Lmao what? This isn‚Äôt an opinion, the bans literally say banned for being boosted by a cheater... use your eyeballs.  You‚Äôre on crack if you think someone gets banned for being carried in ranked.
---
What you mean? New ranked is great. The only thing thats fucked is the return of the exploits
---
This isnt really a rare thing in r6s, you can play for 1 night and get a similar situation
---
This is gonna be top voted, bet
---
I'm a fuze main
---
mo lol shes a human her background is redacted
---
So you think it's okay if a plat player goes on copper and Carrie's someone through that match therefore ruining everyone else's match? Are you sure you're  on crack
---
T H I K K
---
Glad you had a good time man, hope you can eventually get the game!
---
Who do you use more
---
I‚Äôm telling you what the bans are for, dumbass. Not giving my opinion on what I think is okay.
---
Ah ok. Yeah it was fun to explore under the ice. Wish it was still possible lol
---
Shields are back in the game I believe so are claymore
---
When you ban thermite and hibana and just sit at the wall thinking really hard about hardbreaching
---
[Both](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bzjers/hate_to_break_it_to_you_ubi_but_clash_needs/eqsuo1k/), they are basically the same glitch. monty has a fix before clash was released but the last update "removed" it and now they both have it
---
MY LEG
---
3v5 is not easy if both teams are competent.
---
Ok, making sure I'm not the only one who finds this recoil just as easy to master
---

No

Her ass.It s good.
---
Somewhere in my captures on Xbox, I have this shitty clip from like 2 years ago when I first started Playing of me clutching a round (very clumsily) as kapkan but man was I proud of it. 
---
It‚Äôs really all uphill from here friend.
---
No just don‚Äôt take it away what?
---
N√∏kk Elite? They only just came out. Slow ya roll.
---
What do you mean?
---
I thought it was thatcher because they say Nokk is British. And that it would be really unexpected
---
Oh thank you I'm excited to try new guys

---
Bruh what are you talking about?
---
Good job man stick to those admins
---
I like the suppressor ideas, but feel as though that the extended barrel should not be a must pick, but more of a choice with how your going to play the match, with the changes that you suggested the extended barrel would be a must pick and therefore little to no other barrels being used other than that one when available
---
Season pass holders should have access to the new ops a week *before* the season drops, not the week of.
---
He got bored of clash getting all the attention when he was the one that came up with the idea of shooting with the shield up.
---
I‚Äôve had even more bs, one time there was a plat 2, gold 3, and 3 in copper, it was like in sliver 2 and the coppers were boosting
---
Yes dude. I wear that proudly in high rank games now ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I‚Äôve always liked that reload, it‚Äôs big and flashy like the deagle
---
I‚Äôm going to give that a solid oof
---
He's whining about 3v5 in solo q. It EZ because you just feed off of the chaos of solos and do something the enemy doesn't expect.
---
I am of the opinion he should be left alone. Not all ops need to be viable. He can remain as a monument to ubi‚Äôs sins.
---
Silent 2 step...
---
Ranked is still putting people on Brazilian Servers, I clicked casual and got put in Ranked.
---
Can you please make a post for this, this is a big deal to those that care about ranking properly. Last season I made a post about this same issue and it was removed.
---
It‚Äôs a fucking barricade who cares? OMEGALOL
---
I'm not great with posting videos 'cause I can't save them to my phone. 
---
Video just shows my 4 kills over the course of maybe 5 or 6 seconds. I cut it there because the Nomad was being cheeky and Smoke ultimately got the last kill a minute-ish later, so I didn't subject anyone to having to watch that. 
---
I don't get these often 'cause I'm not great at the game so I decided to post it. No hate plz friend.
---
Yeah... But it gives you the item.
---
Happened to me but I magically got the turtle for IQ
---
It happened to me but when I logged on later it was there waiting for me
---
Nice to see some creative charms for ranked now instead of just the operation logo and your rank color and number.
---
LMAO truth
---
They all joined in when it was 0-2
---
I've got a few questions about N√∏kk I was hoping someone here could answer.
---
Just how quiet is she?
---
Does the activation and deactivation of the HEL make noise?
---
For one there is no buffer between the rounds. Adjustment for your Attack or defense can be immediately. Especially good for team that don‚Äôt play often together since you don‚Äôt need to start talking about attack and make your adjustments right away. Build more of a competitiveness round by round bases. 
---
It allows a team to take advantages of bans and picks more. You are defending? Maybe you want to ban so you can more affective or ban more passive to win rounds while the other team counters that. 
---
Team with more diversity can show off their abilities better. 
---
Believe or not with current shit map pool this makes the game less defensive sided since not all 3 maps have 3 viable sites.
---
Then Jackel across the map giving her last pinged location the finger.
---
It‚Äôs not though when compared to other smgs
---
I picked the now ops today and haven‚Äôt been team killed ...
---
Yet
---
I got a successful roll for an alpha pack after my match last night but it didnt show on my menu, even after restarting
---
wdym? i love the fmg 9 and think its great
---
I mean how they let them back in without fixing them (btw i meant all of them so far and this failsafe gave monty a glitch)
---
aww thx

HEY THATS NOT YOU WHO COMMENTED THATS ME COPYRIGHT STIRKE

Yeah... You commented on my username so I tapped yours to look and got a bit distracted
---
##okay good sir
---
pretty sure I probably didn‚Äôt do it but okay
---
That's it, I'm getting me mallet.
---
You know what I agree I‚Äôm going to have my extended barrel have a suppressor so it‚Äôs extra long, I could even poke people
---
Maybe just some bad luck in matchmaking? Or maybe it's just one of those toxic waves that come here and there?
---
Did I have anything interesting? :o
---
Sorry mate that‚Äôs just how it goes
---
Raids: Shadow Legends
---
*leans forward and squints*
---
nothing beats the golden deagle
---
No people who want to just run around and shoot people cry about it, people who want to play siege for what it is want it back out of the game. Streamers and pros right now are asking why it was added back into the game, they are saying how sweet it is. If you had reaction time and decent aim you wouldn‚Äôt need it, instead you have to drop to the floor and unload a clip into somebody because you can‚Äôt win a straight up gunfight. People want angles, droning, not dropshotting.
---
Her weapons are pretty good imo. Maybe you should make a tier list based on pro's thoughts on the op or just their gadget.
---
At this point it's true as fuck. Really hope I can at least hit the silver range before I get placed.
---
you know its casual right the mm doesn't really care about MMR
---
Well this graphic looks like it was put together with little to no thought behind it, so we‚Äôre even.
---
My game crashes when I try to change my loadout on Nokk, I've restarted my PC and still happens.

All my drivers are updated as well.

The new season toxicitygets old. I always wait until either all my other teammates select an op or there‚Äôs about 2 seconds left before choosing a brand new op. Usually works well enough until the hype dies down after a couple weeks.

Then please tell me how so then?? What's bad about it?

Wait wait what. Win a game of secure area in *ranked*? Lol.

I guess. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love getting a flawless victory but to happen over and over seems a little weird.

So glad I didn't buy this year's pass.  So sick of all the recycled guns.

Caviar
---
Finka has one of the highest win rates in the game, her Spear 308 is a very good weapon and her ability can lead her team to victory with its surprising effectiveness, the amount of buffs it provides is overwhelmingly good.
---
Vigil on the otherhand has had his SMG12 nerfed to high recoil hell, his c75 is mediocre at best, his smg is just average and the bosg is inconsistent and if you miss or get rushed by multiple players you're fucked. Not to mention his ability is very underwhelming and has received no help from Ubi aside from making the cooldown more like N√∏kk.
---
I'd like to hear your explanation for Zofia. As for Ying I think her gadget is inconsistent and her weapons are relatively bad compared to the offerings of some of the other attackers.
---
After reading the other comments I see the mistake with Maestro and I'll fix it (btw I'm the friend that OP mentions in the post) and Echo I think is fine where he is but I'm open to explanation.
---
It's most likely toxicity. Someone probably autolocked/picked  Nokk or Warden when they wanted too. Most of the  time its 1 toxic person, then someone else avenges the person who got tked.
---
But instead of a plat 2 it's a plat  1 and 2 diamonds

---
BuT iT's JuSt A PiCtUrE oF a BaThRoOm!!!11!
---
Yes
---
Shame
---
They made it so ranked is only bomb
---
Only recently came back to R6 after a year of .. not playing? Happy Ned Flanders has come to the stage
---
I agree with this, I was playing Nokk and there was a hatch above me I wanted a ash following me to breach but she just crouched and stuff. Eventually I played warden alot in that round and almost/the entire team would make a circle around me and just praise my mustache.
---
Looks like I‚Äôm strictly playing card
---
It wasn‚Äôt his fault, someone put a hatch in front of him.
---
Cas
---
I was playing villa today and i happened to be playing warden they brought blitz, ying, glaz, and jackal with smokes and last was just a stupid ash with flashes. I dropped an ace with warden something that I thought would never happen lol but about ranked its really prefrence i didnt like the other modes so idrc.
---
Kaid is really just a situational op. He's practically the only op that can deny a hard breach on a hatch. Bandit has the better gun, is a 3 speed, and can bandit trick a wall. Kaid definitely shouldn't have lost his barbed wire though.
---
This has to get changed. It's so frustrating.
---
A Courage reference??? Wow...I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
It never hurts to just play ranked and get used to how people play that way you can just continue grinding. I know golds that played 400 matches last season alone just because they prefer the way people play ranked vs casual
---
Its part of the update broski. You can only play bomb
---
Vigil has had his SMG12 nerfed to high recoil hell, his c75 is mediocre at best, his smg is just average and the bosg is inconsistent and if you miss or get rushed by multiple players you're fucked.

Oof
---
I once got into a game of sweats with my friends, and they banned the new ops so we couldn‚Äôt play them. We called them the fun police, and did everything we could to not let them win.
---
##we kind of demoralized them entirely
---
0 utility, half reinforcements, awful iron sights on 90% of guns.
---
If you wanted to, google would probably have your answer
---
This
---
My game had unlimited bullets getting shot. Everyone had to leave.
---
RFF is an anti team kill system. So don't get baited into team killing as it will then be an anti you system.
---
RFF will active on them if they damage you enough. But they probably walk a fine line in team damage
---
GOT IT THANK YOU
---
Lol my first casual of the day and I got booted pre game when I chose N√∏kk.
---
**THEY HATE USE CAUSE THEY AIN'T USüò§üò§üò§**
---
Forgot to mention he's on PS4!
---
Idk cause they are retards
---
The recoil is still manageable if I do say so myself
---
Wait Cav in S tier and Vigil in D tier, really? I‚Äôm what world?
---
Even in the situation it's meant to work in it's fucking garbage
---
By the time your sight is clear, whoever was planting using smoke would've gotten it down and ran out. Besides, most players will bring a glaz for smoke plays and by the time warden is in place with his gadget on, Glaz would've had his gadget come online by then and shoot him down instantly (Not to mention it's easier for him since he has thermal too which warden doesn't have).
---
He's decent against flash spams and ying rushes but that's it
---
Almost. The whole thing has to be connected. You're almost there so!
---
This.  *restates previous comment*

Has anyone else noticed you can‚Äôt play in 4K anymore? Max res is 1920x1080

Man siege can really suck. It used to not be so when I joined, mostly people there for a good time then it got big.
---
Can we get an F for our fallen comrades to toxic teammates
---
It doesn't activate if you use both twitch drone and pistol shots, at least it didn't seem to activate for the guy.
---
He took most of my hp more than half with his pistol and then proceeded to leave me at 10 hp with his twitch drone, still didn't activate the RFF.
---
That would be incredibly taxing for consoles and lower end PCs to have to render every single cameras view

My older brother said he did this once. Fortunately he‚Äôs a lot better now.
---
Wdym by starting closer to where you‚Äôve ended?  Did they tweak the ranking system?
---
Ubi has only allowed you to get the old outbreak packs for buying siege. Thats about it
---
Wow great job!!!
---
You should have*

oof

Happens to a friend and me all the time. Friend nearly aces a team in the clutch, and they vote to kick because he didn‚Äôt clutch. I always say to them, ‚Äúhe wouldn‚Äôt have had to clutch if you all didn‚Äôt die.‚Äù That usually shuts em up.
---
A+ for effort
---
Maybe someday they will add more achievements hopefully that be pretty cool
---
I was Monty so yes, the 2 nitro cells and countless impact grenades felt good
---
I liked it alot, 2 rounds that I played as warden most of my team was around me praising my mustache. (or my entire team) Nokk is also very fun.

Obviously they do a lot more than add 2 ops in the game. They fixed the prone system where you can slide around anymore, that‚Äôs probably what caused it. Pretty obvious they don‚Äôt just add the ops in and that‚Äôs it
---
That won't do anything if the monty is any good, can do 2 180's to block the explosion then be back in the corner.
---
Would you, by any chance, be pale as "milky milk?"
---
The game engine can't display multiple perspectives at once.
---
Oh
---
Same wanna play sometime I'm on rn my GT is Shaggyclover93
---
Pencil Mustache DLC when?
---
Good one üòÇ
---
buy the pass then  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I feel like molasses now.
---
Wait till they come up with this bs technovirus and everything becomes warframe.
---
Magic
---
Yeah an hour after this post i actually aced with warden using the mpx which is just something
---
So I just read the update, The charge up is the intensity of the highlight. So if I stand still I can see... wow, that's kinda dumb.  Best part is it won't fix Glaz defuser cheese, but ok ubisoft.
---
Felicia.
---
Console is an absolute hell hole. I played on my PC account for a couple weeks and went back to console today, got vote kicked, teamkilled, and was basically in a pool of toxicity the entire time.
---
Frost traps HP down from 100 to 66.   
---
   
---
Because when I think of Frost, I immediately think about OP she and her traps are, so glad she finally got nerfed.   
---
Now it will only take 2 shots to break her traps instead of 3, now I will finally get to Plat,  
---
Now that the terror of Frost and her menacing traps are finally balanced like the rest of the defenders.   
---
üòí
---
The original renown is 25,000
---
90% of 25,000 is 22,500
---
The original r6 credit cost is 660 
---
90% of 660 is 594 
---
So they got the renown wrong but the r6 credits right 
---
Unless I‚Äôm dumb too
---
I actually felt like all the operators ran weird after the update. 
---
I was playing Bandit and the running motion seemed off, almost like he was a 2 speed, but just a little faster, but not quite his fast self.
---
Lion seemed stiff.
---
Twitch seemed so quiet.
---
Then again, I have been away from the game for 2 weeks, so perhaps I'm just not used to it. But it really made me stop and pay close attention. 
---
Something has to have changed...
---
But now is no time to mourn, now is no time at all.
---
r/oddlyspecific
---
Mine showed up like half an hour after I got them.
---
tis a vidya game
---
You need 2500 elo to hit gold 4, Good luck friend!
---
yeah just read that, was kinda buried int he patch notes. Doesn't really fix anything though. Just makes Glaz much worse at anything but that.
---
Original renown is 27500
---
I personally prefer the secret star skin as the carbon black is so well conplemented by the white blue and gold accents
---
The only thing is that ying doesnt have any cool cosmetics so idk
---
Really with gridlock  And   Mozi unlock them the day they came out  And quick question how do you get multiple tags on your name
---
He was pretty good and still is. Totally deserved that nerf
---
Thanks I will try that
---
you go in game with your original and you move your mouse left/right until you do a 180 or a 360(aiming down sights too), measure that. then when you change the aspect ratio you measure and change it to that
---
Damn. Have u tried reinstalling if u havent then this might be ur only fix
---
If the glitches still severely affect gameplay then you DON'T put them back in. Especially after taking them out all together the first time around because its not an easy fix. Why Ubi. Why...
---
I actually just moved from 16:10 to 4:3 aswell and just fiddled with it in thunts for about an hour, ended up lowering my v/h by 5 each so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more preference than anything
---
I shut down a smoke plant with Warden, so that was cool.  His gadget is CRAZY situational, so most of the rounds I played I never even used it.
---
But his combo of shotgun primary plus an SMG secondary that isnt totally ass makes him feel like old Smoke used to be.  Im a roaming Rook main and playing Warden is just the same for me.
---
*What have you brought to this cursed land?!*
---
‚ÄúTrue, true‚Äù
---
Im assuming all ops will have different abilities or they may be in game but not playable like some characters shown in other games.
---
Literally unplayable
---
I‚Äôll try that, i‚Äôll have to wait and play until tomorrow
---
soft mmr reset now, depending on your past rank highest you can get is 3500 elo, i forgot what the lowest is
---
\*Defuser drops\* "Give me the plant"
---
It's your fault
---
You might have the season pass, on the tag thing click edit pick asomeone and who every you wanna add put :opname:
---
How long did it take for them? It must‚Äôve been a LONG and painful journey
---
Copper on you Black Ice charms, F
---
Some guy didn't get nokk so he left, then two others left leaving me in a 2v5. Great start to the placement matches.
---
Its a glitch, report it to ubi support they'll help you
---
My squad an I are extremely upset about this aswell you‚Äôre not alone. We‚Äôve been trying bomb and honestly the game just doesn‚Äôt feel the same to me.
---
What they are doing is one person leaves the game while they are gone they boot up a program on their computer, join back in the game and when they are about to lose they crash the game. Everyone gets kicked, the game is over no one wins or loses. I would love a way to report the person but their not hitting my internet they are going for the severs.
---
Oh I see, why did they do that, and are there patch notes stating that they did that?
---
Sorry I don't follow, you mean into red stairs?
---
 Bingo. I see it.
---
Okay, thank you!
---
Huh?
---
Hey I got it
---
I know!!! I‚Äôm extremely glad that someone has the same opinion as me. Frost is sooooo broken! üôÑ
---
90% of the system is the same, matchmaking is the same. 
---
Only difference is the reset, It used to reset everyone to 2500. Now it will reset you to a mmr between 2500 and your current MMR at the end of the sesaon. 
---
But just in case your really good or really bad, they have a current mmr Max (3500) and Min (1500) so people like pros dont just start off with diamond rank.
---
Ok so the latter
---
It that so? In the past I tried a lot of times to put one there but I think only one time I got the green light but it didn't let me place it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Well, at least now is easy to place.
---
I understand what your are trying to say, however i feel it would provide confusing data, would the teammate get a kill as well
---
Honestly that doesn‚Äôt shock me. I‚Äôd rather get a more realistic mode rather than this weird stuff. I guess I‚Äôm more excited for the cutscenes rather than the gameplay
---
I have no idea where to look it up but if you can show me then great.
---
But let's just say you are right.
---
They could buff her that way, and if she is too strong they can limit her to a specific weapon. Even tho i think it will probably ruin her. She is though to balanced because she has 2 abilities at once.
---
https://youtu.be/bbq8OySsKL4 
---
Watch from 3:55
---
Did i do it tight
---
Alr man if that doesnt work then i have absolutely no clue what to do.
---
She weak and if ur saying that she needs that buff then yeah i agree because she is weak
---
Do tell me why it was removed from PL then? Maybe the fire in fireplace wasn't hot enough? Or snow outside was too freezing to spawn.
---
IDK, seems funny, ain't it?
---
No problem
---
And they take it out of rankedüò°
---
Well, at least I've confirmed that you can't get high from pancakes then, cause that's what I had for breakfast.
---
Ye but capitalized the C in chibi
---
O ok
---
Lol
---
Well, you ain't wrong.bsue takes a while to master.
---
But she's going to be great.
---
I was worried for a second üòÇ
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
bots are still better than 90% of gold tho
---
Wtf
---
Not on console :(
---
So literally a 1shot sniper? Would sound nice.
---
The new change didnt satisfied me at all, now he needs multiple shots and literally everyone who has some brain will simply spray in his direction and he gets downed. 
---
I think the idea of no thermal (as it's useless now) but higher damage would be nice
---
Oh f**k.
---
Now I so want to grind to diamond, if those kind of charms are the trend in the future.
---
I agree I fuckn hate Bomb
---
That‚Äôs his job, the cheese was him being an entry fragger.
---
Yup. The vast majority of top players use kbm and ddos
---
Be happy
---
Yes and claymores too but they‚Äôre back now
---
Vigil ain't got mediocre guns, bub. Not secondary, at least.
---
Just because you dont like the anwer doesnt mean im wrong or that downvoting it will make you right all of a sudden.
---
* Its a video game 
---
* Its not realistic
---
* Its not a mistake, it's a international artistic decision made by the lore team.
---
* There are lot of operators that are not realistically capable of being in a CTU. 
---
* Most of these operators are picked for their equipment, skill and knowledge, Not their physical capabilities
---
I actually thought that's what was gonna happen
---
You must be hungry.
---
That's why you got banana themed buckshots.
---
Maybe so
---
Check ur flair m8
---
Most likey his first time on the map so he didn't know what was on the other side.
---
Or You Just Ban The new Ops In Ranked with your Friends 5 Stack lmao
---
Save up for elite or iff there's a next round of pro team skins.
---
No it‚Äôs fun to do. And yes I know it‚Äôs game breaking and unfair
---
Ubisoft "fail safe" was probably
---
if (clash.sheild==active &amp;&amp; clash.shoot==true){
---
      clash.shoot =false;
---
}
---
What did I just watch
---
If only technology allowed us to capture our screens directly instead of having to use our phones.
---
At least she's cute
---
it glows a lot.. for once i was happy be not be able to hit diamond
---
Dont you know that they changed the physical exam to a weight exam? 
---
The standard is to compare the person thats being tested to a 15 year old Estonian boy.
---
True, but he purposefully dropped his rank since it showed as Silver but upon further inspection he was a Diamond
---
They shouldve just taken her barbed wire and bam. Problem fixed. Never seen anyone do it with the impacts iirc.
---
The thing why I agree with bomb only for ranked is that secure area is a much easier mode to play. The rank from secure area does not translate to the rank from bomb. The discrepancy between a diamond in bomb and secure area is pretty big and normalizing it seems like the smart thing to do. There isnt any other game I can think of where you have 1 ranked queue for 3 modes that are vastly different in their complexity.
---
As a Silver II I am proud of it.
---
Not only does it work. All the others do too. And it works on monty too now.
---
Wow. Can you not read? Pro league has more rules then pick and ban and 3 round rotation.
---
And that goddamn humming
---
Huh for sure, ty it was a last min "huh can this be seen by this" question before me and my buddies got off for the night. Tried searching the sub but saw nothing on it
---
honestly the plat charm looks way better... kind of glad i suck at the game now
---
Same goes to your black ice skins on fmg-9
---
The glitch is being able to shoot with your shield up. Basically a 180o unkillable operator that can 1 tap you.
---
Dont be mean to my clash...
---
He‚Äôs my favorite op. I like his story, but I am considered a flex player
---
I'm sure if they could they would; the fact that they haven't means that their current code doesn't allow it, or is hard to implement
---
T h i c c.
---
Yet it gets downvoted, lmao. It really is too bad Ubisoft never hears positive things when they do a good job, it feels like everyone just wants to complain.
---
Yes I know endurance can't be measured by buffness, but she has been there a few years 
---
and if they aren't on missions army is mainly training for those missions ( source, mine friends brother is in the army: scouts pataljon) 
---
P.s could you tell me there Cooper's test standard
---
never heard of it
---
yes its a notification system bug. just ignore it
---
I'd agree with you if favela and yacht werent in rotation right now. If you're gonna bring back those shit shows at least keep university
---
No probs.
---
I'm not sure about bullet proof cams though, since I haven't tried it yet, but I'm sure if she is spooky on maestro cams, she'll be spooky on BP cams as well.
---
Well, now you know.
---
Report those suckers.
---
Do you have bloom turned on?
---
(UwU)
---
Damn I was wanting the Tachanka headgea. That was the last thing I needed so I got all excited lol.
---
The amount of people tk'ing, throwing games, suiciding, winning teams surrendering.
---
It's at an all time high.  Ubisoft don't have any solution to stop it. They don't care what ranked ends up like as long as pro league brings them more money.
---
With the amount of shit the community is doing and the amount of game breaking issues and common bugs it's best to not Commit to an entire season and wait to see what they do.
---
Oh definitely, im enjoying her so far but haven't tried using cams against her. Well that and not too many people play her it seems like, well at least on ps4.
---
I remember a while ago someone suggested an MVP animation where his evil eye camera lights his cigar or something
---
Well others wouldn't agree with you for sure since IQ can detect 20 gadgets and is the only hard counter to Valkyrie and echo, so that route is a no for sure.
---
Recorded on free weekend?
---
#
---
It‚Äôs a 1911
---
Well the casual community never understands balance, so that's the bane of the game.
---
In real life those would not stop a bullet
---
Map awareness level 1
---
When you need more words for school but you dumb.
---
Indeed!
---
Well ubisoft, you removed claymores l, defender shields and clash because there was a way to get an unfair advantage when using them.
---
Time to remove prone or ads because you can get an unfair advantage and it can be exploited by anyone.
---
See why their system is garbage?
---
I thought there was a fail-safe built in?
---
Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
Sadly it's just 3 days for me, since at the time of launch, I was out of station.
---
I swear, sometimes I hate my job.
---
The window is reinforced from the other side wtf
---
I want it now!
---
And still exploitabused like always
---
And died to Alibi while saying that N√∏kk counters Alibi. It was hilarious.
---
Ok, I‚Äôll try a restart of the PS4 then, I‚Äôll see if I run into other issues later. Thanks
---
&gt;because their fucking braindead and can't comprehend call outs of places that involve 2 different bomb sites
---
are you saying that secure only players are dumb?
---
huh
---
Ubi now: ‚ÄûWe did It boys! Recruit rush is no more‚Äù
---
But but but. I'm in silver 2
---
They aren‚Äôt technically fixed, but they implemented fail safes so that you can‚Äôt take advantage of them in anyway. Like if you turn invisible you get turned visible again, the deployable shields drop after 2 seconds and you can‚Äôt shoot through them, clash has another work around I can‚Äôt quite remember.
---
So yeah, they are still in the game but rendered completely harmless until they can be squashed completely
---
Apparently the other guy just got the game too
---
I noticed maybe the same thing. Like sometimes i push the right stick first it goes slow but a second after it makes an huge turn. The same goes for recoil i think they made some changes...
---
Macros are only bannable if one key push does more then one action.
---
Having a macro that that when you push it will make your fully auto gun shoot one round only per key push is not a bannable offense.
---
Having it so one key push fires 10 shots single shot is.
---
This is how it is in every game.  One key push must equate to one action.
---
Even wows macros abide this ruling.
---
Money I guess...They want you to buy the upgraded version of the game with all the operators from the past seasons
---
Anyone else not like the new selection screen? The icons are too big and spread out
---
Starter edition has every op cost 12500
---
I agree with him, it makes no sense for her to be that thicc
---
Ubisoft is really taking the fallout 76 route on this one
---
Idk it could be latency. Even 20 ping for both players is enough to cause a small server communication issue like that.  It definitely isn't the player pov issue.
---
Ubisoft changed their achievements so some of them are less grindy like you no longer need to kill 200 terrorists through soft objects or do 100 protect hostage terrorists missions it's more of things that you would do naturally over time
---
Our time has come.
---
This is the quality content we deserve
---
Technically yes.  Bannable... If and how is another story.
---
I donut anything is going to happen. Given that he's well know.
---
I guess that's a step forward..maybe? If the glitches are still there and if clash already has a workaround I'm sure it's only a matter of time before more start
---
I'm saying it's easier for solo players to enjoy the game and not have to wait for a group to play the game. At least secure area gives you a chance to carry 1v5 because it's more simple and your monkey teammates can be more clear with info. Besides did you miss the whole point? 2 bomb areas is too difficult for people not secure area is for stupid people. Idiot, nice try.
---
Actually 3 years. Game was released in December 2015, so technically 2016. We're at the Q2 of year 4, but definitely not 4 years yet.
---
I swear NA people are actually clueless
---
That's always the best.  
---
Back in like October/November I was playing with a friend of mine (He plays really casually given how much times he plays, while I am pretty competitive one) after he started in September and we were doing some Ranked at random because I was getting bored at Casual's pace.   
---
We were in Border, I was holding CCTV with Ela+FO12 while he is anchoring Lockers. I move out after killing an enemy, they drone me and go to the stairs.   
---
In the time needed for me to do this while saying "I move out of CCTV cuz enemies are there" I hear him "Oh fuck what the hell" and headshotting two enemies while the other anchor falls to the ground. Soon after I am telling him something like "nice job bro" and he starts laughing like a mad man. Like, 2 minutes of laughing.  
---
Because he fucking missed the downed guy with the revolver trying to heal him two times and didn't notice until the guy on the ground started moving away from him and telling him "WTF" in chat
---
Om point, before this i played WW2. Although the knife part is an accident pressing the de R3 button.
---
In casual there is no satisfaction :v
---
Why simply don't separate the ranked mode and the ranked competitive mode? I simply want to play a modality where i can have fun while ranking, not a modality that FORCE me to play what I don't like.
---
"I just kinda wish you were stunned!"
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Sasg is brilliant for shorter ranges but personally I like the M509A1 or whatever the SAS shotty is called
---
Also, every time you break down a barricade the shield glitches into your fow
---
But it doesn‚Äôt effect gameplay
---
it feels like people playing Buck, Fuze, Valkyrie always are the ones being to dumbest.
---
Buck is killing himself with a grenade, while Fuze wants to kill the hostage, valkyrie places her cams in the corner of the objective under a table in the hopes of opening a portal to the fifth dimension
---
It‚Äôs pve with 3 player coop I believe.
---
I‚Äôm actually glad they removed recruit from ranked. At this point it‚Äôs just a Op people use to troll. If you want to troll, go to casual why ruin the try hards experience. 
---
For people that argue recruit can be played competitively, that‚Äôs ridiculous. It used to be somewhat plausible year one but now there are so many ops that it‚Äôs just a troll pick to play.
---
:/ dunno why you are saying that because I never implied you will be 100% banned.
---
A macro doing one action per key push does not break any rules.
---
A macro doing multiple actions per key push is breaking rules and is a bannable offense.   You may get banned for doing it.
---
Yes that's what I heard too, but why no PvP?
---
This is hilarious
---
Please adopt me
---
Maybe because you could just play this game?
---
So trueü§£

Glaz vision? Wardens ability is completely different to Glaz.

---
Every season I start out ranked gold 2 and make it into gold 1... but never broke into plat and I hate myself for it. Dope ass charm though.
---
It's multiple actions with one key press. Whilst it's incredibly unlikely technically you broke the rules :p
---
actually that started with Outbreak with Lion from GIGN and Finka from Russia, then with Grim Sky with Clash from Scotland yard and Maverick was basically General US army. It seems that every other Operation we get 2. Honestly if they are going to give the US 3 separate DLC's then they need to put in a Mounty op from Canada.
---
I would like to see a crawl knife only run
---
They changed the achievements some of them they just changed the names and others they just completely changed
---
The game is suppose to be team bases. Bomb has the most team based  attributes and is the most balanced, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the only mode
---
Wait, WHAT!? That's it, I'm done. See you in the next Siege game, where you can have the White Mask skin as a Recruit elite. Ha!
---
I make myself laugh sometimes. Next Siege game, pfff.
---
I think I'm going to stick with Siege
---
Fucking god tier reference
---
I like to cover myself in shit, and jump in the toilet bowl and pretend I‚Äôm a turd
---
I am as well, but this is a cool idea. I just prefers PvP over PvE
---
Operation Health was about servers, not bug fixes.
---
You're missing my point, you are connecting these games to today's politics. These games are about stopping terrorists from destroying a place or even world in some games. Some of these scenarios are: Stopping a killer virus (Rainbow Six), stopping a smallpox virus (Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow), stopping terrorists from destroying Las Vegas (Rainbow Six Vegas 1&amp;2), etc. How is any of this "imperialists propaganda" or have anything to do with the right wing. It seems that these games are just about stopping the bad guy from doing a bad thing.
---
The only problem with this theory is the fact that N√∏kk would be around 41+ years old, meaning she is older than Zofia. The reason behind this is the fact that she was part of Task Force K-Bar 2001-2002 (The first major ground deployment in the War in Afghanistan) and Operation Desert Snowplough 2003-2007 (the codename for Danish operation under British command during the Iraq War). So N√∏kk's first deployment was between 2001-2002 and before this she was at the Army NCO School and then went to the Royal Danish Officer Academy, as far as I can tell this will have taken her till she was around 23 to graduate from (quite tough to find out how long the courses are if anyone else has a better timeline then let me know). Even without this, if she had deployed as soon as she turned 18 she'd be the same age as Zofia
---
It opens the chat and types a message it doesn‚Äôt have any actions
---
I know it‚Äôs not him just a weird coincidence
---
See, you get what I'm saying, it's nice as a gamemode in a game, but not as the game itself.
---
Renders shields useless. Shield users can already be shot if they position incorrectly.
---
Shields reward good positioning for the user and punish bad positioning for the target,
---
Making them easier to deal with face on renders them pointless.
---
or white, like normal and bulletproof ones
---
That is great üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ My biggest problem after learning not to switch to secondary was learning how to stim teammates. They would knife me needing a stim and I'd look at them with the stim out before stimming myself lmao
---
I'm a fan of kaid if you hit your shots that thing destroys people
---
This! Exactly what I meant in my post yesterday... fix the root cause, Ubi, instead of doing failsafes that probably bring new problems with them.
---
*vote kick initiated*
---
youre welcome
---
If you accidentally activate a glitch like these, either don't play that round or have one of your team mates kill you because that's not fair to the other team.  if you continue to play knowing you are glitching, and get kills you should get a temp ban.
---
Just use thatcher.
---
Operation health is not needed, a competent dev team is needed like come on. Yes maybe some of these bugs require lots of skill and effort to fix but they are a huge company, they have a competitive scene, these should be fixed instantly. Also who the fuck actually cares about quarantine. It‚Äôs not what rainbow six siege is. I would rather them just fix the game instead of making fancy stories so they can ‚Äúdraw in new people‚Äù because what‚Äôs the point in drawing in new players to see how broken the game is
---
Yep, same here. Lost one after winning with 50%.
---
So you want the easy mode for yourself because you can't win soloQ and refuse to get a team (or rather fail to find with that attitude prob)
---
The fact that you can "carry 1v5" in secure just proves that it's a bad gamemode and should not be in ranked, siege is still supposed to be a team game
---
We‚Äôve been bamboozled
---
Why can't they just add a insta-ban when people do this type of exploits? Right-left-left-x-crouch-INSTA BAN
---
HEY THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY
---
Fires a slug round. If you miss you are fucked. 
---
Shotguns generally deal damage in a spread which is less punishing to players using them but really rewarding at close range with accuracy.
---
It dosent is she simple ansere
---
Ha ha so funny
---
End of the season. The new relative mmr reset (or whatever Ubi calls it) takes your final mmr from the previous season (mine was like 2670) and the middle ground mmr (the normal 2500 where everyone used to be put at) and places you in between swaying more towards the final mmr of your previous season. I started at about 2600 mmr minimum.
---
at some point they will need to tell us when her birthday is, alex during the panel said once you connect the dogs you will figure it out, but he said he apparently knows her name, since nobody can figure her out they will tell us at some point
---
Looks like a cog from Toontown
---
If you want a true shotgun then Maestro's is a lot of fun to use. Might not be the best but its a lot of fun.
---
What if some crazy guy gets to level 30 while choosing to unlock no operators?
---
If I remember correctly his LMG didn‚Äôt get any benefits from Finka boost.
---
And you got a Warden no less. Fitting.
---
It's legit the mp5 but no recoil and no acog. And you have to learn when to activate her gadget. Once you understand those two points, you've mastered her.
---
....im just going to sit back here....want some bread?
---
They should ban people, why would you not try to get rid of people intentionally CHEATING in your game. Ban them, make them buy the game on another account, and they likely won't cheat again.

r/cursedcomments

Probably because how toxic people get when you admit you aren't great. I mentioned I was usually mid-high silver and I got spammed with shit about how my opinion doesnt matter than. Like give me a fucking break, I play on a laptop and have other things like work that greatly limit the time I can play
---
Only on console I suppose, I still have the old achievements on the PC Uplay client
---
This is amazing , give this man a medal
---
Eww office references. Everywhere i go i cant escape them
---
I didn't even see the red circle around the hostage, am I blind?

1. It's not propaganda. Propaganda, according to googles definition, is  "information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view." He isn't promoting anything, he's just telling stories. He isn't biased, for example, in Rainbow Six (the first Tom Clancy Game) is about stopping eco terrorists from wiping out humanity. Agree with them or not, they are still trying to wipe out humanity. You might as well say violent games are just propaganda for violence.
---
2. I'll admit, I lean more right. We don't think the FBI or the CIA as "peacekeepers".
---
3. I can't think of any nation who's government has been overthrown by the CIA. Even if there was a time that we did that, that's a sucky thing but it doesn't mean that the CIA is pure evil. In the real world there is no white hat or black hat. For example, I LOVE America but there was things that we did I disagree with (slavery, Japanese constitution camps, etc.). No organization/person is perfect.
---
Yes it is.ü§î At the first teamkill the victim gets to vote on intentional or not.
---
Only on PC, I've heard console players say it's still working for them
---
I have as well as reinstalling the game uplay and steam. No dice.
---
I suspect it is a Siege made for streaming. Next gen has them all going streaming and the lag is horrid so no go.
---
Hence to keep cash cow milking out gold, create PvE game out of a mode Ubi didn't think was even good enough to keep around or repeat in game. Lag has little effect on PvE as you have seen in Ass Creed Odyssey where canned animations eliminate the perception of lag. That is also why the PvE game cannot be part of Siege as the devs will have to built in unskippable animations into player actions.
---
Oh fuck where the 1st one?!
---
Ya ma's cunts mad
---
Yeah kinda
---
One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!
---
Boy he asked you nicely
---
You can't do that anymore, they switched from a hard mmr reset to a soft mmr reset
---
your previous rank now does matter and does influence your rank after placements
---
I feel like teamspeak is essential for Monty &amp; Clash, typing and pings agent as good
---
But then I cannot have a big e dick like reddit user Mylejandro
---
ikr, i see this more on console then on pc. on pc they just tend to leave.
---
I mean, this is more high IQ, 0 execution.
---
This is spot on. People need to learn that it will be  3-0 more often than before when it alternated.
---
I shit in a condom, throw it in the freezer overnight and enjoy it like a cold popsicle the day after when i get home from work.
---
When i'm done sucking on it, it goes back into my ass where it belongs
---
I then shit it out almost completely but right before it's out i slurp it back up into my ass.
---
NOOOO MY MAIN
---
If you play day 1 it is pure luck. I won my first 5 being bottom of the team in 3. (MVP once I'm not always bad).
---
Best of luck to the remaining 5
---
Exactly this üëç

For god sake I deranked to copper 2 in late season from a g3

nice

I think you struck a nerve

/r/woooosh

I feel like the audio is really bad at the very beginning of each new season but usually within a week I find it to be back to normal.
---
Obviously it does to him if he's asking for someone else's opinion.
---
I've legit spent hours adjusting it, it makes it way harder to deal with the mouse and key kids.
---
Lel
---
That‚Äôs just your opinion. It‚Äôs like saying that every game of CODs equivalent of ranked should be Search and Destroy and not hardpoint or domination. 
---
I‚Äôm a bomb player and I don‚Äôt agree with forcing people to play bomb in ranked, especially if all they have ever played is secure.
---
Ubi remove this crap please. Your failsafes are failing, don't release a new season if you still have major exploitable bugs in the game.
---
u/UbiNoty u/UbiWildWatermelon u/UbiBoat u/Ubi-Ludo
---
I 2nd main Monty too and whenever I get killed I see my shield acting weird everytime and wondering if that was why I died
---
Dosen't seem to be that way I get an average of 4 or 5 kills a match against people with 20-40 ping on ranked
---
They came out after operation health . Which is Blood Orchid (Y2S3)
---
They will be 15000 Next Season
---
Since when was "lord tachanka" canon? They gave him one uniform
---
Yeah I was smoke and I was smoking the last enemy.. my teammates just rushed into my smoke and died, they voted it as intentional TK ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Tehe
---
Alpha packs*
---
Welp I use recruit for thermites AR with the frags and breach.
---
This post is out of this world
---
It is not. It can be activated after the first TK if the kill is not forgiven. But before that no RFF
---
Just play thermite. You get the same ar and you have great utility
---
Which is stupid, because her traps were not OP.
---
U don't
---
Has your brother played an fps game with a controller before?
---
Sorry what is a ddose?
---
I love that I could read it.
---
Been using Googles Learning Morse a lot lately :D
---
Beautiful but you had to make her thicc
---
You do. If you start now with the standard edition it's a chore. I have 280 hours logged, already bought some chars and still have not unlocked all. It became better with the price reduction but well.
---
I guess but its pretty harmless so I doubt its a bannable offence
---
I understood that reference
---
Its a video game
---
I mean... if you have no shot registering issues, it's not a hard disadvantage, but that should happen.
---
How many kills you get does not really measure how good a high ping is.
---
Real life priorities, so this man says he can‚Äôt buy a game for around 10$ because he is thinking about his currently life. 
---
You talk like we who play R6s don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù life as you. 
---
Also, real life includes paying for stuff and not waiting for ‚Äúfree‚Äù weekends. 
---
I think you‚Äôre inner stupid.
---
Agent 47?
---
Alright thank you
---
Man outbreak was great
---
im happy you can laugh about this, cuz i would have cringed so bad.
---
probaly but i heard that is gonna be a complete new game i don't know if that's true but i hope that it is a gamemode like outbreak
---
Ubi can‚Äôt win this war
---
Because spawnpeeking with the spas-15 more toxic is
---
Final mmr
---
Huh i guess ive never seen it and havent had happen to me
---
I kinda quit the game because of that
---
Ubi fkd you as they did when you bought the game.
---
we fell victim to one of those classic blunders
---
What is up my coconut brahs
---
Nah, if he‚Äôs getting an elite skin it‚Äôs gonna be a James Bond tie in
---
Beat the shit out of your brother
---
So sad I have to wait 7 days for this to show up as it doesn't show for non season pass people
---
Confuzled
---
If you think echo has no value then I'm afraid your opinion is automatically falsified about this topic
---
Okay,next time i gonna to do dkkaebi
---
Wait when can you do this? Only against Cav, or all operators?
---
Yh it‚Äôs long but it looks like solo queuing is a bit dead now
---
Omg thank you!
---
ahh right, i started last seas
---
Unless you're in matchpoint, then you can suck a fatty according to Ubi, I can be ahead 2-0 but have 1 guy get peeked and ragequit, lose that round and then have to play 4v5 for 2 more rounds before getting "Heartbreaking defeat" 
---
Thanks Ubi.
---
Just give up on firewall lol
---
It's so ridiculous, that in other games, if the devs take something out, it's fixed in days, or a week after. And in Siege, they still couldn't find a solution. But i guess pushing the new content is far more important than fixing some hm... gamebreaking bugs.
---
People here are kinda misinterpreting the reason why Recruit is gone. He is gone because of Pick and Ban. There is no recruit when pick and ban is active (this has been the case in custom games ever since pick and ban was introduced there). Probably because if people ban Ash they don't want a recruit with the same gun to rush then.
---
I‚Äôm honoured haha.
---
I think its only if theres large MMR discrepencies no? So it matters if you were Plat or Mid Bronze it matters. If youre silver it doesnt
---
Might have to change your flair if they do.
---
I mean I lag like hell at 100...
---
Still broken though
---
On which gun tho
---
Siege needs more protection against quitters in general, it's terrible in both casual and ranked.
---
Actually, they did. There was supposed to be a failsafe so that this couldn‚Äôt happen, with the full fix coming later this season.
---
Then by that logic the update shouldn't have released today.
---
Everyone, just ban her during the picknban phase.
---
Thats the main appeal in ranked for me now
---
Ive been playing since launch on and off for few weeks at a time but im somehow immune to gain map knowledge
---
Sticking to one side helps me to get to know where things are
---
Noice
---
All ops are free since cholera why is he in casual Then? Why not just pick another Op
---
I very much appreciate the way you think about us. Don‚Äôt get enough thanks :c
---
This mouse looks pretty cool, i can't see what brand it is :(
---
All we want to do is sit in the corner of the objective while the whole team move to the other side of the map
---
Except in the event there is no 5 man. But they don't have anything to register that to put recruit in for those people.
---
Yeah, this game is so heavily Intel based that people only play in 3 stacks or more
---
That‚Äôs just my art style. It was unintentional
---
Is big gay.
---
Good question, who even are Alpha Packs
---
Reload your game
---
I don't think the difference is that large as you think when you first watch it. Certainly not a perspective bug. You held an acog from a very close angle and she wide peeked. 
---
I rewatched it and there is no difference between how wide she peeks on both your screen and the replay.
---
Ah I was plat but ended at gold 3
---
Why are they so dead set on keeping us of it? Its a lot less broken than all the spawn peaks on this map?
---
They also showed a Top 500 rank which now isn't in the game. Things change, nothing shown is ever final.
---
All ops are not free anymore and casual is designed to do silly stuff and meme. Hell i play a lot of recruit m870 in casual because its fun but ranked is not the time to do stupid shit. (Im going to sleep so i wont respond until i wake up)
---
Well in my case there is always a 5 man. No 5 man no one plays. We do it because we enjoy ranking up together and also when we are playing well we switch to recruit and loosen up a bit. Why remove that?
---
We‚Äôll see in 2 years
---
From Gold 3 with a 5-5 win/loss ratio to the brink of Gold 4 but still 3
---
The truth is the player retention will likely take a hit, as there are fewer game modes to play on a competitive and the monotony will spike, I dont think it's a good move and hope Ubi reconsider their position here.
---
wait...that's illegal
---
What the fuck
---
What does it do in terms of performance? Won‚Äôt it decrease performance since it is operating less?
---
Better question, why are Alpha oavks?
---
Wooow...
---
Search ranked, within 7-8 seconds you will be placed back into the match. If it doesn't back out is the queue and reboot the game.
---
PC ones are still the same from what I can see, all still completed.
---
i hate  English
---
Don't know about exploiteds but alot of old glitches are happening alot more frequently, mainly sound glitch and the server lattencey is terrible.
---
new meta
---
Lmaooo
---
I love how all these clips everyone you can see stops and is like wtf did I just do
---
F2p but bought Blackbeard for 20k renown? Or is all ops available in free weekend?
---
It‚Äôd be cool to see something like left 4 dead‚Äôs versus mode though
---
Ubisoft - "If the map deems you not worthy to stand on it, it's decision is final"
---
I figured it is said like how Ella is said
---
‚ÄúMornin‚Äô boss! what a beautiful d-‚Äú
---
I think some of it may be too harsh, the first offence shouldnt be punished that much, for instance you get internet problems or the game crashes. This should serve as a warning with a 30 min ban for instance and the offences after that should be strict.
---
In game. I have a really good router and my internet is amazing.
---
This just looks like a standard photoshop filter...
---
Yeah, i usually wait a bit, last season about week and a half, but got too excited this time. Paying the price now. Well now i know, and knowing is half the battle.
---
fuck it, remove all of em. we recruit only now bois
---
Wise words friend
---
Rio? You're already playing ranked? I'm just enjoying the new stuff for now
---
Hey did you buy the game on Uplay or steam?
---
Thats why i wait at least two weeks before i go ranked
---
Thank yah
---
I mean sure it‚Äôs their fault the glitch is still in the game, but it‚Äôs the players fault for knowingly abusing the glitch instead of just playing the game fairly.

Add Bandit and it looks like donald trump
---
You would actually be optimising your cpu performance by doing so. Intel set the voltage in cpu's to a "safe" area. Basically They don't put it at the limit in case they put it too far and it crashes. You can just slowly decrease the voltage by 0.005 each time. If the game crashes, increase it a little bit. Just make sure to do it by small increments. Watch some videos as well if you feel uneasy about it
---
I wish that stuck omfg.
---
Yeah, exactly. Ubisoft Montreal is responsible for Ubisoft's biggest titles. They just outsources Outbreak development to Paris to continue working on Operation Chimera.
---
I get leavers all the way through the season, plus your argument doesn't make sense.  The people playing ranked at the beginning should be theoretically the most eager, and therefore least likely to quit.
---
As for playing ranked early, I only really enjoy ranked.  Casual does not do it for me.
---
This issue is a good representation of bugs and glitches and how hard it is to fix them. Just like the map is complex and can have multiple ways to get on tarps, the code itself is also complex and can have many loopholes waiting to be found and exploited.
---
Now, the tarps can be ultimately removed but what if it's, say, claymores? They need to be fixed, but it's very hard to catch all the possible ways they - or other mechanics - can be exploited.
---
Teach me how to play on a fridge
---
[deleted]
---
So nice they increased tts to 3 weeks to test more stuff
---
I think it used to be 1 flawless ranked game.
---
Oddly enough, that trophy is still there, alongside the new 5 flawless one
---
Just make the punishment much more severe for people who leave, start with a day, and every time after add 2 more.
---
Looks like you don't have gold
---
A 1080ti will not bottleneck any system. Period. If you have vsync off then your game is going to push your cpu and gpu as hard as it can.
---
I think it‚Äôs cause mp5k has only recently been made obsolete, and the fmg never had the holo sight and I think it has very limited barrel attachments
---
Why
---
Slenderman. So...it makes N√òKK.
---
So this garbage is back again, it's a fucking filter and requires absolutely no skill to do.
---
Could you c/p the paragraph just above that clip?
---
Like a zof withstand
---
No thanks.
---
A compotent blackbear wins 99% of fights when peeking into a room with a target in.
---
We don't need an op who peeks a room without exposing them self.
---
it‚Äôs epic gamer reaction times
---
I havent either, but people have seen it in the TS, and the fact that dropshotting exists  was addressed in the patch notes. Good advice on the one week though.
---
Blood Orchid maybe, because people didid‚Äôt receive any new ops for 6 months
---
And you can have two operators or more
---
Probably blood orchid cos Lea was just so broken
---
Oh nvm, its an xbox user. Makes sense
---
Which one was that? üòÖ
---
Because R6s mmr and ranking is dog shit.  It seems very random at the start and the purely goes on win/loss.
---
Warden now NEEDS a headgear that turns his head into that face.
---
Maybe 1v1 with you with Blackbeard you lose 99% of fights.
---
You don't have enough skills to face BB do you?
---
Probably Red Crow, in my experience at least.
---
Year 2 Season 3. Lesion, Ying and Ela.
---
Am I the only retard that can‚Äôt see what everyone else can see? No? Just me? Great
---
While I like both new ops designs I‚Äôm a bit disappointed about the recycling of gadgets and weapons already in the game in one form or the other. Also not a fan of pick and ban in ranked but digging the Kafe rework.
---
No i mean the trophy for doing 5 flawless and 100 defends have been in since the start. Im looking at it now i did the flawless one June 2016 and i still need to do 100 defends I've been working on that over time solo when im waiting to squad up because its fucking boring. I hope im close. Since there's no internal tracker. Your guyses achievements are tracked by xlive whereas Sony's trophies are either just achieved or not. Tell you what aside from psvr i really regret not going xbox this gen. Better achievement system. Better back compat. More powerful console. Pc streaming. Im missing out big time
---
Honestly from experience it works great for non competitive games. Not much input lag for those types of games. Don't go playing Rainbow Six Siege with it.
---
r/unexpectednedflanders
---
It‚Äôs one week
---
Didn't remember that one.
---
Started at Gold 2, yet finished it in Copper 1, 'cause my friends were more serious in casual lmao
---
Honestly I like this season for the new ranked system as a main reason. Kafe rework is very nice and works very fine. But imho the new op aren't surprising, and the fact that they doesn't have new weapons is disappointing. Anyway my overall judgement is good about this season.
---
Ping doesn't give an advantage anymore. Lower pings are better.
---
Peekers advantage will always be a thing.
---
If you insist yiu hit the headshot then check your connection thoroughly. Momentary dips can be a huge problem on siege.
---
Nobody has figured out the scale yet. So I can only tell you what happens at the top end of things because it has a data reference point I can use. I have no idea on the scale where it will put you. I can tell you that if you finish Gold 3 (assuming that‚Äôs what the system uses) and Win 5 Lose 5 you will be placed much lower than Gold 1, probably Gold 4. 
---
If the scale uses your max MMR, plat 2, and you win 5 lose 5 you will likely place around gold 2. 
---
Despite what the other person says im not sure if we actually know if it is based on Max or Final.
---
In my experience, it was just one, which was Ela. I didn't see too much fuss over getting Zofia, but man, I couldn't be in a fucking match with anyone playing Ela it seemed, especially when she first came out. The moment someone else picked her, if someone didn't come on the Mic screaming, bullets were flying and she remained dead for the whole round. Even saw it on opposing sides in matches.
---
No that‚Äôs too op against him
---
OOOOO
---
Ok thanks üôè
---
Some people just need an excuse for missing or being bad.
---
I actually like the new barricades they look so much cleaner
---
For me it lools like wardens head left the shoulders and is going upwards
---
I mean you did a great job putting everything out there, serious props to you but I do think that it would be slightly overpowered, still, great job though, impressed
---
It's a simulation, they are all avatars.
---
thanks to the invis prephase killer for this beautiful picture
---
That's why I gave her the laser. The laser is very bright red and can be easily spotted like Nomad.
---
Really wishing the new ops had at least one new gun
---
I edited the post if you want to read the bottom
---
And that is why you pick your fights on cqb combat. rhe gun has so much recoil that long range bursts are very hard to hit. the fact that you cant kill people easily on long range doesnt mean she isnt viable. In cqb Ela is fucking insane, 1080 firerate and 40 round mag. as i said. if you want to play long range play 3 armor acog.
---
It was Finka not a ubisoft fuck up.
---
Good luck staying conscious though. Let‚Äôs not pretend that taking a hit wouldn‚Äôt put you out the action 99% of the time. The point remains that for the purposes of the game, a headshot should always be lethal.
---
Old English.
---
It has 2 in standard English.
---
Wait so then your friend has no idea who Finka is. Th fact that he only recorded this part
---
I don't see why this is happy news. I'm pretty pissed. As much as I'm a greed fool for collec5ing trophies it really seems like a lot of my efforts and time spent getting these went to do much waste. They seem pointless to be proud of now.
---
Glaz was way too good before. Glaz will always be either too good or too underpowered given his design.
---
Come again?
---
It‚Äôs been one day.
---
i feel ya
---
And people don‚Äôt wanna learn how to play the game....
---
Yeah same here on PC. But it is ubi after all so im not surprised.
---
Nice
---
Why the fuck would people ban Cav? 
---
 I click Blitz and Echo every game personally.
---
I had a stroke trying to read that
---
Funny, I have the four person curse, but it works the opposite way ha ha! We could be dominating and the person that has done literally nothing will rage quit, and then we lose three rounds in a row. Not sure how, really.
---
Lol not if they are teleporting and shit. It could go either way.
---
&gt;I totally understand the frustration. The lack of repercussions in casual matches brings out the most toxic and childish behaviours from players. You just have to be patient I guess. unfortunately not much else we as players can do :/
---
Rest in peace, Lions old scan.
---
It's a Maska 1 with the newer faceshield. You are right about the altyn but the maska just stops pistol rounds and low powdered rifle rounds like 5.56 IF not full frontal.
---
Fuze on the other hand should survive any headshot (if not shot in the face)
---
I can already see all the deliberate TK‚Äôs 
---
‚ÄúSorry, thought you had a valk cam on your head‚Äù
---
Explain what you mean
---
PC R6 should be 80GB without HD textures, Console should be 40-50GB
---
No they would get an assist. All they are doing is shooting an immobilized player
---
Damn that sucks ass
---
One day.. I'll get to play Echo with his deploy... One day
---
They really couldn‚Äôt get more original than that huh
---
Because they don‚Äôt read patch notes....
---
If she wasn't that THICC, she'd be a 3-speed for sure. 
---
That's what's holding her back.
---
Yeah if you are using photoshop with a fucking Commodore 64.
---
Uplay has a 10gb patch, while Steam only 6. Who know's why. I don't use the HD textures and had to download 10 gb from Uplay.
---
Yeah you shouldered her but what do you expect from fighting and ash
---
I don't even think that should be it, I straight up think he just shouldn't have the same mechanic as Glaz. It should just be active regardless. It already has a shitty cooldown with an average active time. Maybe to balance it, have the active time shortened so it doesn't last as long? Make it shorter than the smokescreen duration so attackers can try and play around it.
---
Like r6 has good graphics anyway lol
---
So I'm guessing the one I got replaced the Camper achievement but it still shows it for my friends
---
Nice run just keep in mind to turn off vsync so that instead of getting 30 FPS you get 60 FPS in terrorist hunts and situations

---
Fuze helmet stops even .308. It especially designed with SVDs in mind. It much much bulkier than it seems. You look basicly like Toad with one
---
&gt;Roni has a way higher fire rate, and if you're spraying in the general direction of their heads you have more chances to hit em in the head within the second than the Commando. 
---
That is true. But I have to admit, if one misses their shots, and they will at no fault of their own if they get jumped, they will lose all engagements to the attackers simply because it shoots literal rotten peas.
---
That being said, yes, for somebody with good aim, it is a huge advantage.
---
&gt;I enjoy the F90 probably as much as the SAW but it's personal preference I guess.
---
True. At 780 rpm (rogue 9 tested) and 38 damage, it's a g36c that can beat all guns on defense except the alda. Well worth the pick.
---
I've been practicing with the mSAW for playing support in the squad. Squad is lacking in support players, so might as well be me.
---
&gt;Thanks for the input anyway c:
---
No probs. Glhf.
---
it has a lot of potential, but at high level it seems one and done at best, as it's easy to spot the head of the player outside and defenders know to expect it
---
Or Kingsman
---
They should just add a ladder and be done with it
---
‚ÄúShould‚Äù
---
My has been  reaction time shit
---
Not a pistol round
---
these tarps parkour methods for me are just a meme at this point
---
?
---
How many maps in esl?
---
Probably because you didn‚Äôt run the holo sight.
---
You has been  english grammar shit
---
7
---
I‚Äôm gonna start trying to push the ball inside and see if anyone wants to play with me
---
Because that Is the video
---
Ive had rainbow 6 on 99% achievement completion for years because of that 100 defending rounds achievement. Its the only one I never got.
---
Bruh let me be. I just woke up.
---
When i wake up i dont get strokes
---
I stand corrected, last I heard they used a 50/50 method after seeing its success in other games in a casual setting.
---
can you get all the way to hookah window with this??
---
There was a problem with the photo editor I can‚Äôt do anything about the image quality
---
Go do that then and post it for us, it doesn't even look close, also looks bad
---
finally someone posts actually useful parkour not some here's how to knife the cam in ruins or get to the boat below the map shit
---
Why are you so negative? Must not be a fun life with that attitude.

i want to see new waopns in y4s3 pls ubi add new wapons
---
Nah, console players hate Blitz much more in general afaik
---
Ying shes just so much fun and just a great OP!
---
Hmm i remember having options, you know like the ones they had when the game came out 
---
If they had a better model before this update and they were already dying, cant wait to see it now lmao
---
I mean it may not be a fix but with Nvidia GeForce experience you can add filters to the game and maybe change up some colours
---
Tbh 
---
Git gud.
---
Late last Season i ran inbetween the buildings and noticed one or two bullets somehow flying in front of me where they actually shouldnt be. Noticed the bulletholes right away and was like " WHAT THE...".Yesterday we started a custom game to learn the reworked map and new angles and stuff and i remembered that "thing" so we tested it. Turns out it wasnt just a random bug,glitch whatever, it is a real thing and you could potentially "spawnpeek" someone.
---
Glad you like recycled weapons
---
Also if we look at another 3 speed with a really good gun; ash. Now could you imagine how ridiculously broken Hibana would be if she had ash's gun for instance. having one of the best gadgets in the entire game and being the perfect operator for both close and long range combat. She'd be far too strong.
---
pro league does actually play a huge roll when it comes to the success of the game. so actually if should
---
What map is this?
---
Yeah. Ive died so many times to random concussion shots.
---
Cbq basics situation
---
They called me a madman...
---
It's been fun trying it out with the new sight but... man the M5 is so good.
---
You‚Äôd be wrong then because it‚Äôs an unintended spot. The developers didn‚Äôt intend for that to be a reachable spot so by definition it‚Äôs an exploit. Like I said though it‚Äôs not the worst one ever; low priority for them
---
They can just press f6 now
---
Read the patch notes.
---
Hello Tatchmii, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bzre1h/hes_seen_some_shit/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You have to stand still to have those effects
---
You keep telling yourself whatever you need to be able to sleep at night lol
---
The candelas looked like fun but I've been playing warden and just popping the dumb Yings that rushed point lol
---
Right to their face, blocking the view for the whole match lol.
---
Didnt read the whole context lol
---
But shouldn't you have been on rff at that point and thus just killed yourself?
---
But thermite and maverick have top tier guns because they are at risk when using the gadget.
---
Hibana has an arguably easier breaching tool allowing for safer breaches so she has worse guns then the others.
---
Her guns however are still good.
---
If you look at the operators 90% of them have a mediocre gadget and great guns, have an okay gadget and okay guns or have a excellent gadget and bad guns.
---
It's exactly how they balance it.
---
I, too, hate the idea of preferences.
---
You are right, just to be sure generally I fire a few bullets in case she fakes the interrogation or I miss a bit and hit her shoulder. In this clip, if you notice cav picks up sledge during interrogation which results in a tk.
---
Did that a few days ago. Blitz blinded me and I sprayed the shotgun and chucked the smoke thinking the smoke would kill. Before I detonated the round ended lmao
---
They got out of beta and it's even worse, 
---
What a great job
---
I had a Blitz try and bait me into using my glasses to soon. As soon as he flashed and I kept going after him he knew it was game over
---
Ubisoft:Ah Shit,here we go again
---
Sight color change would be sick
---
Dang, i missed that memo
---
That's a welcome changeüëçüèø
---
It seems like that, but I also get Chalet a lot.
---
Ez clap.
---
Oh yeah sad boi hours I'm level 85 and I have never gotten a black ice ever.
---
Yikes... I miss old Lion on T-Hunt only
---
Isn't Lion supposed to wear his normal CBRN suit? He shouldn't have less 1st person view D E T A I L S
---
Nokk is very strong in the current defence meta which sees lots of cameras for intel.
---
Warden is excellent if you are good at gunplay. He doesn't really bring much unless the team push hard with entry fraggers.
---
Tbh I think they‚Äôre both kinda trash. Abilities don‚Äôt last long enough and their guns are dogshit
---
&gt; But thermite and maverick have top tier guns because they are at risk when using the gadget.
---
The ttk is the same on all three.
---
&gt;If you look at the operators 90% of them have a mediocre gadget and great guns
---
&gt;It's exactly how they balance it.
---
As a package. Not, as you were trying to look at it, in pieces.
---
Yes! G√©rard butler too.
---
Pro league gets terrible numbers for 6 months, then gets 100k as people tune in for the ops reveal and watch the final.
---
Atleast you get to choose who you want to ban!
---
I never use suppressors. They are always worse than any alternative
---
Nokk: I'm too scared of getting TK'd if I take her right now, waiting until the end of the week to try her.
---
Warden: Very hard to justify picking him over the people who have the same weapons as him. They all have more useful gadgets, or at least gadgets that you know you'll get use out of. I see him being ignored this season like Gridlock was for the most part last season. Ubi really should've done more to make him stand out.
---
Hello Brmander, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bzrfg8/alpha_pack_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Im seriously gonna take an insult from a lesion main? Yeah if a Monty main insulted me I‚Äôd feel shamed as he mains a SKILLFUL op. (Lesion too ez but buttcheeks for that)
---
There are also the names mozzie gridlock to see .... said isn't special then in any way
---
That's terrible!
---
Maybe you should read the patch notes.
---
The scope glows targets yellow whilst you remain stationary. If you start moving people begin to fade out.
---
It was a needed change that added some risk to what is usually a risk free entry into a room.
---
Moving reduces his scope's ability. They changed it to make him more of a sniper and less of an entry fragger
---
Ttk isn't the only balancing factor that makes a gun good.
---
Please come out from under your rock
---
All soldiers scream Wukanda forever and rush the bomb.
---
Where is the NSFW?
---
&gt;...and that's why people use claymores
---
....and that's why people eventually get better and either place airjabs for sound cue on attackers side and reposition their run-outs on defender side.
---
Claymores don't prevent or deter run-outs. A guy that wants to do it will do so regardless. It's the tools that attackers use that make it easier to stop them, and Claymores aren't a necessity amongst those tools.
---
Boi, you stole my karma basically 
---
Time to kick it up a notch, BAM!
---
I guess I just disagree. I‚Äôve seen it used in pro league, if it was considered an exploit pro league wouldn‚Äôt allow it to be used. If they really wanted to end it they could just remove a tarp and be done
---
Well, R6 isn't a realistic shooter,it's competitive. Stuff like this is bullshit in a competitive setting
---
Good job Maddog
---
Recoil really isn't that much of a factor with those three guns.
---
Oh that I was aware.
---
Didn't kmow valk ones counted, although in hindsight, I guess that very obvious.
---
Yeah! You tell that air who's boss!
---
I agree. She deserves an elite more than anyone
---
There was an attempt :)
---
Literally every Cav main wants an elite.
---
It's that obvious.
---
They shouldnt have taken out secure, dont care what you people crying about skill say
---
Theres just not enough coordination in bomb for SoloQ's and "jUsT GeT a SQuAD tOgEThEr" doesnt work for this dying p.o.s. game. 
---
This game was barely fun solo ranked because of secure, now its only bomb? Sad.
---
Uninstalled.
---
No, the best feeling is taking one shot on all the enemies, then they die of fall damage. Ez ace
---
It's controllable. So no, it's a player problem rather than a design problem.
---
1 shot headshot needs and will stay. It‚Äôs what separates the game from the others.
---
Brother.. looked at the start of the vid and thought it was the same one lmao ima deletus myself now
---
If it needs a change, it needs a much simpler change. Like wall bang headshots only down, ordo a lot of damage but don't kill.
---
Bearing 9 has a lot less horizontal recoil.
---
Nomad's AK has basically become a laser.
---
Hopefully ela is actually actually changed for the good this time so she has predictable recoil
---
Yeah now at the start of every game you get def or attack and you do the side you got 3 times in a row and then it flips.
---
OGs remember the spawn on the left street and running for your life.
---
They played us like a goddamned fiddle!
---
No they cant wtf. Please use your vast intelligence to tell me what they can do. Tell me how they can control player and community behaviour.
---
Or you could remember that its a game and if someone leaves a ranked game it has zero effect on your life unless you choose to care too much.
---
Ok!
---
Not all Ash mains rush. You'll be surprised on how many aren't reckless
---
I've now seen it all... thank you for this.
---
Sounds like you just need to aim more for the head and learn to control the recoil. Hibanas weapon is my absolute favourite to use and arguably one of the better ones.
---
You all are fuckn clowns, the point of the post was to point out that a good number of people are going to quit the game completely bc bomb isn't fun to them. I get it, some of you like it. Which made the option to play only bomb or secure a cool feature. Casual is a toxic mess currently so I won't play that, and I don't like bomb. Mind you, I'm over level 200 on one account and over 150 on another. I've spent a great deal of time playing this game and I've probably played less than 50 bomb games. It's not my cup of tea. I absolutely love this game, but it's been uninstalled bc they took the fun away from it for me. How many other will do the same? I have hundreds of friends on my list who play secure or hostage only. There are bound to be more.
---
Bro he literally said that at the beginning how about instead of reading just the parts you want to read and referencing them you read the whole thing first, then critique him
---
I know. We only played one game bc we were bored of casual. Next week the rest
---
I'm not saying this is going to kill the game. But with the recent year and what's going on now I won't be surprised if people started finding a different game to play. 
---
Does tf2 still have servers up?
---
  I haven't played it in YEARS.  I only played it at a afriends house  every few months back in the day
---
I‚Äôd take a glance at some of Z-Review‚Äôs videos, especially at what he says about ‚Äúgaming headsets‚Äù but a lot of the devices he recommends will probably exceed your budget
---
I mean how much damage they could take.
---
Honestly depends on the team I‚Äôve played on squares where we vibe on attack and another squad that vibed in defense. I personally like it because it makes a team switch their strats a little if they lose their attack round. Shake it up instead of what usually happens if you lose a site on attack you usually go back to it after defending. Plus having it consistent makes it feel better than the back and forth. I suppose you could do 2-2-1-1
---
Okay, but ranked isnt meant to be played casually. That's why hostage and SA were taken out.
---
One shot headshot needs to stay. It‚Äôs been in the game for four years, why change it now when people have shaped the way they play around that mechanic? It‚Äôs one of the big parts of the game that separates it from other FPS games.
---
Looks like play- doh or however u spell it
---
On go on the the subreddit and click in the three dots at the top right and click on add  flair
---
That's fair, it's definitely not a system for everyone, personally I just never really solo queue and I enjoy it. Glad to see you're not being an ass because I have a different opinion, good on you!
---
I know but I can't find players in the same level of mine who want to play seriously
---
Her recoil is slightly better. Not amazing but a lot more manageable.
---
I gotta try that out. I would think in theory I'd like it, but I'm not going to claim anything until I know.
---
&gt;Bro he literally said that at the beginning
---
You mean the part where he said she needs a buff because people who are bad at the game are bad with her? Yeah that makes a whole lot of sense...
---
&gt;how about instead of reading just the parts you want to read and referencing them you read the whole thing first, then critique him
---
Bit rich from you.
---
&gt;season so that bugs can be found
---
it was found early in the TS but its not much of a high priority or as game breaking as shooting through in-penetrable shields or invisible Operators.
---
and as they said its already being worked on and a fix will be deployed mid-season.
---
plus if you already know what is drop shooting then you know how to deal with it.
---
What happend to Ela? Do you have any details on that?
---
now this does put a smile on my face
---
Not to forget about Jackal, Blitz, Mira and Lesion.
---
Are you able to have 2 flairs?
---
I was making sure lol. Silencer seem to be the disfavored in a gun fight. When in real life it‚Äôs only to silence the gun and the range. So the damage part is really dumb.
---
Than again, play with friends so I don't have to babysit you while you learn. If you suck with an op and you know it than suck in an environment where you aren't hindering others experience while you learn.
---
‚ÄúI thought she was on top of you‚Äù yet you shoot the guy on the floor üòÇ
---
They were taken out because the minority reddit cried about it, even though they didn't have to play it. Don't be surprised ranked queues go through the roof this season and the game starts to die.
---
I always wondered if you could do that...
---
Its not but hopefully they did add new cosmetic in the alpha packs
---
You're shocked that people don't care about their rank in a 4 year old game?
---
Yeah but they're meant to catch people who aren't paying attention so making it easier to destroy them only benefits people who are paying attention, who deserve to be rewarded rather than getting trapped because they couldn't destroy the trap in time when vaulting.
---
Yes read the articles next to the map.
---
No, they should add a shooting range where you can test operators.
---
as I said Casual MM doesn't give a rat's ass for MMR so long it gets you a match quickly
---
Its a fantastic addition, leads to some interesting varied strategies and if you‚Äôre too reliant on one op you‚Äôre probably just not very good
---
This is what happens when you remove game modes.
---
How the fuck does a colorblind mode break the game.
---
Battlefield has had it for years.
---
Open up a report system for players to utilise. Players submit videos of exploiters or deliberate throws in games etc.
---
Only reports with evidence are possible.
---
Employees slowly work through the list and were necessary apply a timed or permanent ban.
---
Word spreads in the player base that people are starting to get banned for shit like this, some people think "nah it won't happen to me" others think "shit I better stop, don't wanna lose the account".
---
With this ubisoft announce known exploits as they come up and issue one and only warning when you launch the game about the exploit and that doing it will see you banned if caught.
---
Would be surprised how many people would stop and the amount of people doing it drops massively.
---
Epic.
---
Still one of the most played games on steam actually. Usually consistently top 20 or top 10. 
---
The servers are definetly still up, both people's own servers and valve's. They keep the lights on at the very least because the game's economy is really fucking profitable, but because of valve's internal structure, nobody wants to work on the game. So nobody does. Just localization file updates mostly now, with the last full update being more than a year ago.

I never bought siege on steam but I have it on there. It won‚Äôt be a concern
---
I had this and people joined after i lost the first round
---
Looks like one of the t hunt guys
---
If you look at the patch notes for operation health some of those things still occur , most of it is creating dedicated servers such as servers for just T-Hunt and custom matches then they tried to fix VoIP but it was still buggy. A lot of clipping on maps and bugs were addressed and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù but a lot are still around. 
---
I get what you are saying though this game needs fixing and I don‚Äôt know why they are dragging their feet with it
---
Yes. All the data they use to make changes, comes from, you guessed it, win deltas in bomb

Solo queue or with friends? I try so hard to get past low gold but it feels impossible
---
I notice a picture of private contractors below lion. New ops... Hopefully?
---
Specifically, platinum and diamond ranks
---
I hate you
---
why am i getting koro sensei vibes
---
Same but I started out in Wind Bastion and haven‚Äôt gotten higher than Gold 3. Placed Gold 1 one game away from Plat 3 and decided to try and get the win. Now I‚Äôm two games away from Plat 3.
---
No I'm shocked that  9 yearold heads play this game
---
1 Million? I only saw one IQ
---
My first Operator was tachanka, are you proud of me?
---
Would 2 round rotation be fairer? I like more variation, so 3 is a little bit too much for me also, but not because of your mentioned opinion. Everyone should be both a good defender AND attacker. 
---
I do understand the choice for three round logic, but two rounds would also fit into that logic.
---
It does matter how long it‚Äôs been in the game if a system is broken or can be improved it should be changed.  Also different doesn‚Äôt always mean better yeah rainbow is different in a lot of other ways in my opinion for the better but, one shot needs a change in my opinion.
---
Take some plates

Dumping on the Secure Area-only noobs has been a blast. Nothing like making someone realize they‚Äôre nowhere near as good at the game as they thought

Hey man if it stops the interro that's all I'm after
---
An* anyways an ace is killing yhe whole enemy team which there was only 1
---
Noob tube*
---
why :c
---
I have PTSD of people running around dual-wielding those fucking things.
---
Jup, every map not above 60-70, usually much higher..
---
Goodluck!
---
Yours?
---
Why you gotta do him like that
---
it's on PC
---
........... gunna make an alt account brb
---
All 20 base ops are unlocked, you playing 20v20 anytime soon?
---
I'm impressed that Ubi refuses to just remove the purple tarp altogether
---
I see your point and yeah that's also good reason 2 round rotation might do the trick
---
Not going to lie to you, I've been using earbuds for years and am better than most of my friends with actual headsets and good gaming chairs.
---
Only way it can be abused is if they disconnect to prevent rank loss. But that also means the other team gets a win.
---
Maybe he did and thats part of his joke?
---
Well need alot more than a goof luck...
---
Thank you
---
They changed the terrorist hunt achievements to easier ones. Assuming they noticed people rarely play T-hunt.
---
https://youtu.be/eatDyi1c-5Q
---
Heres a link comparing the original E3 preview from 2014 and the actual release gameplay.
---
Couldn't copy the link from Ubisofts page for the link for the actual full 2014 showcase but it's on youtube and it looks way better than what they actually released.
---
Also if they don't care about their rank why they are queuing in the first place?
---
For one. The trash bags are black. And his ability is trash. So.... Alright downvote me.
---
Perhaps it‚Äôs the gas that‚Äôs doing it. It‚Äôs not exactly opaque
---
That's "–ß", not "–ù".
---
Could you not just remap your keys?
---
He definitely did that was his way of communicating that he got the joke and was adding to it
---
Good idea
---
And why?ü§®
---
we already had something like that and it didn't work
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to adjusting the rounds required to win in order to mitigate this. We all got those maps we hate or are shit at, front loaded rounds just ensures you‚Äôre off of it ASAP hahaha
---
I've been getting higher frames. I went from 190 to 250
---
Wasn‚Äôt that changed after the Invitational? They went back to only a couple ops being unlocked.
---
Yeah I love the new ranked system, it allows for a lot more strategic play.
---
Im getting my usual FPS but as the seasons go my ping gets higher Y3S4 i had 30 ping. Y4S1 I had 50 - 60 ping Y4S2 Im getting 70+ ping.
---
Are you playing at school? lol
---
Yes. Just vaulted to side panels at the upside of tower.
---
Que the Photoshop/artwork pros!

Inb4 patch
---
I swear to god I just got it almost exactly the same again. Tachanka-&gt;kapkan-&gt;echo(=maestro xd) - &gt;kaid. It is getting weird man.
---
Thanks so much!
---
They can make it work.
---
Get on that science boi
---
Old lion pepehands
---
Fucking insane to me that the tiny percentage of MLG players and wannabes are dictating the entire direction of matchmaking.
---
It will be on Uplay.
---
that's the problem, I tried several binds but some of them don't work properly. the biggest one is that the right ctrl key doesn't work for crouch, im currently using num pad 0 but it's way to inconvenient
---
You know you can just have multiple flairs, so you don't have to worry about that!
---
Hello SpirallLz01, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bzt9a6/clash_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They stopped selling on steam they decided on uplay and epic to boost uplay sales. It's literally what they said.
---
Lets say 2 of your teammates leave because r6 community is trash and its 0 3
---
If you get 4-0'd, it is because the other team is better.
---
If they can win 3 rounds on attack or defence in a row then so can you.
---
Um not to burst your bubble but if your picking random then not happy with the op then dont use pick random?? Theres a limited amount of ops then if you do it after 4 people picked then theres even less. I got Chanka twice in a row did I complain? No because if your playing Chanka in ranked and your like "sorry it was the random button" then it's not my fault the game picked him.
---
"If it runs on batteries, I'll see it."
---
Yeah it took me a little bit but i finally realized that a couple minutes ago
---
If you also look at the top right where the ops are categorized you can see Kaid underneath anti hard breach
---
Just buy a uplay key from somewhere.
---
I really really dislike the pick ban phase. It takes the skill out of the game
---
I've known this for some time, and been waiting to use it with nokk. Now that we have her, it'll pose quite a problem for roamers!
---
I don‚Äôt think you can throw cams in that area, I could be mistaken though.
---
Love it. Makes having a team work together all that more important.
---
To be fair, /u/AJTheMan is (mostly) right. 
---
Way back when Kapkan's traps had a constant red laser and were instantly lethal, there was similar discussions and a few people mocked up what it would be like if we had such colour filters in game. It was possible to make the red lasers especially much more noticeable with some of them, which pretty well completely broke Kapkan's ability. Same thing with claymores too. The thought was that the more competitive, normal colour-perception players of the Siege community would enable these filters and gain and advantage.
---
Now it's definitely a bit more debatable whether or not this would be as big an issue since the changes were made to Kapkan. I also don't see why changing the reticule or UI elements would give anyone a competitive advantage. I would imagine for someone with a red-green deficiency wouldn't necessarily mind getting hit by the odd claymore now and again in exchange for letting them see where their bullets are going to go!
---
Fair enough. I recommend checking out the entire show of red vs blue if yiu enjoyed that. Lots of hilarious antics
---
And what single attacker do you ban that ensures a win.
---
We have claymores though.
---
First of all, I wasn'g comlaining, second of all: it is the NEW SEASON with a NEW FEATURE which I was just testing.....
---
lmao dude. Go buy a lottery ticket you will probs win
---
Very good point. That man is gross with clash lol
---
Because you get rewards and stats which need to be synced with the server.
---
That would make sense cause I don't see the bullet tracers
---
I prefer a recruit that reinforces and tries, over a roamer that dies in the first 10 seconds üòÇ
---
Yeah, but for Rocket League if someone wants to play ranked with a lesser ranked player that's on them. You could just play casual and not suffer any consequence. Game rule wise, there is no difference in RL between casual and comp.
---
Why don't  thay just put a ladder leading up there at this point?
---
I might just do that.
---
The cam hit the skybox.
---
Oh nvm my nvidia software changed the graphic settings and had T-AA-2X instead of FXAA and ambient occlusion was on
---
I really like it. It allows for players to correct mistakes, choose better ops and loadouts for a certain bomb site without playing a round as the other side and forgetting what you did last round and unable to change your plan until the mext round.
---
Was that c4 after the cam &gt; ?
---
It's not. Someone in my game was doing it on my team on purpose.
---
They should make all of them free everywhere to be honest. They directly influence the gameplay. Them having a price and grind tag leaves a really bad taste in a PvP Shooter.
---
When did they come back? I thought they were still banned until it was patched.
---
A recruit that reinforces wall/hatch is better than a roamer that dies early
---
"it works for pro league"  
---
Thats the only understanding they have.   
---
Unfortunately its not pro league, we dont need pick and ban and we dont need 3 round rotation.   
---
3 round rotation puts people on the back foot when a map is biased to attacking/defending. being on the backfoot gives people a negative outlook, Its not fun, its not what people want but its how humans work.   
---
Pick and Ban works in pro league because they have their strategies, They know each other perfectly and their preferred roles as well as the opponents roles and strong points.  So bans are meaningful.   Ranked on the other hand is you trying to decide who to ban based on "who dont I want to see" and isnt a meaningful decision at all and all it does is potentially ruin someone elses pick choice for who they find fun.
---
Lorewise are the multiplayer trainingsimulations
---
Since there is a ban system, and people tend to ban the strong/annoying ones
---
Not sure which red-green variant you have but I find that running reflex on everything helps. I put up with the acog because it's an acog, but I'd gladly trade a teammate or two for a green acog reticle.
---
So, anyone else discovered a problem with alpha packs? Before this season started i had 9 packs. Won a match and got a pack, now i have 7 without opening a single one. 9 + 1 = 7???? that's not how math works....
---
People ban ops such as echo alot  because they cant be very very good on certain maps.
---
Yeah only on pc
---
Eljj beita, Elzbieta
---
Because she‚Äôs a shield op? Maybe? Not sure where he was going with that.
---
At the launch of this season. They only removed claymores from Nokk. I played IQ and Twitch last night and had access to place them down.
---
I sent it to the server
---
Honestly seems more competitive. It's a change for sure but I have enjoyed it so far.
---
Getting tracked while roaming is stressful. As a vigil main, i can say that i play completely different while being tracked.
---
1. Pretty sure part of the agreement between ubi and Tom Clancy is that no player can play as a terrorist
---
2. Banning operators can happen for multiple reasons
---
R6 wide bans (ie clash) to fix big glitches
---
Individual match bans if you are playing a game mode that includes pick and ban.
---
And you can still exploit them so they wont be around long.
---
It doesn‚Äôt always, but that isn‚Äôt a blanket statement for never.
---
This is a specific game. You must perform in a certain way and have a certain team to win at this ‚Äúgame‚Äù The teams ability to perform the necessary criteria to win , can be measured against another team. They are ranked based upon that. Of course if you solo que, you‚Äôre at a disadvantage. So skill is only really measurable if you are in a coherent well rounded team. 
---
But at the higher ranks, everyone could solo que and act as if they are a pre-made. It just comes down to you‚Äôre not satisfying the criteria to win at your current stage , and that‚Äôs not a knock at you, your just failing the criteria of not being blessed with a team. And that isn‚Äôt your fault. But your skill (henceforth Elo or whatever) isn‚Äôt going to improve unless you adhere to the this chokepoint, skill is separate from ELO really.
---
The old animation wasn't always correct, and people would beat the ground a foot away. This can screw over attackers that are holding on angle on the defuser, since defenders could destroy the defuser far enough away that the attackers didn't even know it was happening.
---
Great job you two :,)

Because it is, but he also said twitch would be an A pick even without it

I have looked through yamjam422's posting history and found 4 N-words, of which 0 were hard-Rs.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve seen a post about Op Health being referenced on the paint job of one of these vans before. Don‚Äôt recall if Tachanka was referenced, but I‚Äôm not at all sure that this is new. Maybe I can search the subreddit history and find it.

Watching you repel through that skylight when you're the last one alive gave me anxiety üòÇ
---
Use an app called Gamerlink. I've found a lot of players on there.
---
I noticed that toooo
---
No its normal lmao i tried realistic
---
Every game has T&amp;Cs and TOS. Agreeing to them or not still does not limit them to take disciplinary action against those who break them. 
---
Refer to the [Rainbow 6 Siege Code of Conduct](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-326395-16/rainbow-six-siege-code-of-conduct)
---
I‚Äôd say it is way below average.  Any competent team is going to destroy it as soon as it enters obj to take out gadgets.  People only pick twitch for her gun.  She‚Äôs like a slower ash with a slightly better gun + acog.
---
Please don't mention Blackbeard, or this may aswell be nsfw.

Oh, ok thank you. Is it new or has it been around for a while?
---
Try killing a downed op with a breaching charge, may make it a little easier to achieve
---
Its basicly the keratos with a mag if you have the muzzle on
---
Yeah but most of those things could be just sci-fi of some sort. There is no way that smashing something with an existing gun (mostly) is more effective than bullets or explosives.
---
As a Mira main on defense, if Mira gets banned I become a Maestro main. They play pretty similarly imo although their engagements are different (as in with an LMG I feel a lot more confident in engaging multiple enemies at once).
---
A beautiful, beautiful Madman..
---
&gt;If you answered ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to the previous question, you are wrong.
---
600k people will downvote you now for speaking the truth, sadly.
---
I just imagine it‚Äôs VERY heavy
---
All I know is that the FMJ would have a 99.9% pick rate over the DMR. Giving Nokk a DMR is like giving Ash a DMR, it doesn‚Äôt fit their purpose at all
---
If they gave her a DMR and took away the FMG, I'd never play her. She's designed to be a close quarters operator meant to flank and counter Intel, giving her a long range weapon in this type of game is more of a nerf than a buff.
---
I just got the Platinum trophy two days ago. Seven hours before the update drop I finished my 100th defense TH. 
---
Still worth it
---
If me not remembering some guy saying it took 19 hours to make something like this months ago makes me flawless, then I guess I am?
---
I have tried, but since I have no squad there's always someone who steals my kill xd
---
People who do that are scum
---
Yeah I‚Äôm working on it, I‚Äôm only level 22 and I‚Äôm not used to the leaning mechanics. Thanks for the tip though
---
Ya more Ela buffs... I mean Twitch buffs!
---
Because hes an operator that is hard to deal with in bomb.
---
He‚Äôs one of the best bomb operators because his drones can stop a defuser plant. Taking him out removes that possibility
---
Just pointing out:
---
&gt;Anchoring in a dark area of the map with dark uniforms was a srat,
---
Which meant that people who bought costly cosmetics had an advantage, essentially forcing pay2win, which has never MO of this game.
---
You are never notified of the T&amp;Cs upon playing R6, you have to hunt them yourself
---
Echo gives vast amounts of info to all defenders, can disrupt planting the defuser, has an ACOG, has wire. 
---
He is one of the best defenders you can use, and a lot of the time people don't want to be dealing with his Yokai drones.
---
Thanks a lot
---
Well a plat now is gonna mean plat, idk really know what your talking about
---
It was a joke about the color
---
Hello 3stripz, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bzu97d/gg_ubi_for_releasing_a_bugged_op_what_is_the_tts/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I mean logically, the gas masks for the CBRN ops wouldn‚Äôt work properly for this. Remember, it‚Äôs designed for more of a virus than a gas. If you look at the suits for the other ops, they have the same filtration system as Smoke. But thankfully nobody has said that the SAS ops should be able to go through this or Smoke‚Äôs gas because they have the masks... SAS has gas masks for smoke grenades which even though they have a huge affinity towards using, none but the recruit have smoke grenades
---
Why does everyone hate spawn peeking? It‚Äôs totally fine, we just weren‚Äôt paying attention
---
I was told Blitz was gonna be banned often... it was a lie.
---
Echo stops rushers and lots of people like to rush in ranked games
---
You handled it better than I usually do. I never play with less than a group of 3, and if we encounter someone using exploits on our side we just mercilessly gun them down. Fuck that noise
---
Since when was her recoil ever a downside?
---
They should cut the RPM. Problem solved.
---
no my team rushed every round
---
People just ban ops that can be annoying or good in unique situations instead of banning strategically
---
Coz Intel can be extremely helpful. So having a drone (yokai) is a big advantage for defenders, and it's pretty annoying for attackers because it turns invisible when on the roof
---
This is what they did. Ranked has opban integrated.
---
I had a match in late burnt horizon where it became a 5v1 and after the match ended we gained 0 mmr
---
No, not my boy!
---
Same here, I got the "win 100 T hunt defenses" by winning a game of casual doing the Kafe discovery playlist.
---
You get the last recruit you had, have tried it before banning the only ops I had.
---
Mozzie accedentialy put a pest on his bike and lost his phone so he couldnt control his bike
---
I don't know whats more epic - the fact that clash didn't die or the fact you got both the attackers.
---
It would be my only chance to get to gold
---
When to roam or to anchor comes to what operator are you. At start you might wanna play less operators to learn better and then start filling roles and playing different operators.
---
To anchor - Usually the 3 armors. Sit on obj and be the last line of defence. You don't have to be aggressive and peak literally everything. But keep in mind that some operators play differently. Like Rook, camps angles with your ACOG, Mira can contest ways into the obj with her mirrors and Echo just bullies attackers. Know. Your. Anchor.
---
To roam - 
---
There are 2 types of roamers.
---
I like to call them "Deep roamers" and "Shallow roamers". Keep in mind that some roamers can do both.
---
Deep roamers hide somewhere and wait for good flanks. Good ops for that role are Vigil, Caveira, Pulse 
---
Shallow roamers tend to stay NEAR but not IN the obj room. Usually it's under, above or next to. Operators that do it well are operators that have a strong ability to contest that room they watch and waste time or hopefully take out attackers. Jager with his ads, Bandit, Lesion and many more. 
---
Try to stick with easier operators to play. I recommend for anchoring Rook, Shallow roaming can be Jager, Mute, easy operators that help even if they didn't take out someone. Deep roaming is a harder thing to do, won't recommend to new players.
---
Now, when it comes to reinforce you always wanna have the hatch above the objective (if there is one) reinforced. And hopefully the attackers won't breach it. Kaid, can electrify it, a 3 armor operator that is pretty easy to play considering his loud got buffed a lot. Walls, pretty much just reinforce everything in the obj (unless a Mira is around it and may not want you to reinforce next to her). Until you learn more places to reinforce. Your knowledge will grow and you will know what walls you might wanna reinforce and not. Good example is in Skyscraper bomb mode. In the karaoke room there is a wall that can be shot from the window from outside and from there you can wall bang someone in a room next to it. So you gotta reinforce that but if you didn't understand it's ok ;)
---
I also recommend watching youtubers that upload content that helps players improve like Siege academy or Griefdrums, VaristyGaming and stuff like that. If you have friends that know about the game ask them to help you with things. 
---
If you want any more help ask me :)
---
agree
---
*"13-15"*  ..... Siege is rated 18+
---
NA or EU? cuz honestly its pretty rare for me to hear a peep from people except a few callouts on EU PC. the rare ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô game really stands out because that behaviour is just so... odd. sometimes i‚Äôm even jealous because NA ppl are more talkative, even if that might increase in toxic stuff.
---
This could easily be exploited unless it only applied to players who weren't in a squad with the player who left
---
I have game development knowledge but there‚Äôs more to it than ‚Äúknowing how games are made‚Äù as it depends on game engine, language (I assume C++) and dev team among other things. Clearly they‚Äôve done something really wrong to allow exploits like this to happen and made it so difficult to fix. Not entirely sure how they could ‚Äúcheck‚Äù it. I would check if the player has both shield and gun equipped at the same time, which they shouldn‚Äôt have. Maybe while the gun is equipped, run a raycast (or line trace in some engines) to check if the shield is still in front of the player.
---
But it can‚Äôt be that simple to check as Ubi are having trouble fixing it themselves.
---
Overall; I don‚Äôt know how I would run checks without seeing the game code itself, the problem may even lie within the animation system.
---
So stealing this tactic. Good shit!
---
What about bomb only, it is a solution in search of a problem, Some people like other gamemodes more.
---
Yeah I made an attempt on normal but I need to learn m+k some more
---
Userflair: smoke icon Ireland flag
---
Okay I'll try my best Haha, 
---
So Echo is one of the strongest defenders for bomb, he can single handedly save the round for the defense by using his yokai drone to deny a last second plant or to harass the attackers and buy time for his team, his mp5sd is just as good as the regular mp5 and his overall impact on both teams is very significant. Doc I don't think would ever be banned, because his overall impact is centered around his ACOG, just play rook? Then that ban is negated. Hope this helps
---
Why you using the pmm tho? The gsh-18 is clearly superior
---
Why should they put time and effort into catering to people who went out of their way to break the rules? I understand you want to play the game, but there are plenty of warnings before you get banned, and before you could play the game you had to accept the terms, you chose this path.
---
18th
---
If you're on defense first banning Thatcher is a pretty good strat imo
---
Not Blitz, despite the fact he‚Äôs the one banned every time. I‚Äôd say Maverick can be a big one, or Twitch. It‚Äôs hard to choose an overall most important one. Maybe Monty
---
&gt;I‚Äôd say it is way below average. 
---
Takes out lesion mines, kapkan traps, Mira windows, cameras, zaps enemies (unnecessary though), bandit batteries, Essentially being the single most potent Intel and support op in the game (WITH the best gun in the game btw) and you call it way below average?
---
Damn, hoss.
---
&gt; Any competent team is going to destroy it as soon as it enters obj to take out gadgets.
---
If that player is losing his or her drones so quickly, then he or she is a bad twitch. Watch how LATAM pros save BOTH twitch drones till the final miniute. THAT'S how you play twitch.
---
You make a good point so it would probably have to factor in if you are in a squad or not.
---
It‚Äôs all good, if that happens I‚Äôll post a couple of recycled Tachanka memes to restore any lost karma ;)
---
bikini but he's already in the game :)
---
Not really effective... But have a friend run Blitz and you pick Sledge. Have your friend flash the last guy and you sledgehammer him. We call this ringing the gong.
---
You‚Äôre aware this sight has been in the game for a whole season now right? Mozzie has had it since he‚Äôs been in the game
---
I know that‚Äôs why I said ‚ÄúNew‚Äù
---
It was a downside because it was very heavy But lmao it was just vertical so it was very easy to control
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
Thats super smart
---
Easy pull down.
---
True true. Must be a really big issue if even TripleA devs are taking this long to fix it.
---
There are plenty of warnings before you get banned? Not in my case, an instant permanent, my first ban.
---
Every game has TOS / Terms which all users must follow. By playing the game you agree to them, this is exactly the same for every type of service known to man. I honestly can't help make this seem any less important than it is.
---
What?
---
Because he is very annoying and powerful
---
Hey, I've got an idea: You've got the sum total of all human knowledge at your fingertips, use it instead of asking other people to use it for you
---
Thunk*
---
My tip is to always wait at least 15 seconds or to wait until everyone has selected an operator. Then you have 90% chance u won't get tk'd
---
Yeah it used to be a problem back when maps like Kanal and Bartlett were in the Ranked pool, but now it's much harder to pull off without dying.
---
But... It's not? Ubisoft is based in Montreal, which is in Canada. And they use EDT because that's their local time zone???
---
Edit: Ubisoft is not based in Montreal, it's french, but the ubisoft team that produces siege is.
---
Yeah I have the legendary skin for the M249 but I can‚Äôt put it on the M249 SAW :(
---
G fucking G man. I was gonna try and go for that plat aswell. How hard is it?
---
It good it‚Äôs just sort of sucks
---
Love that they changed the trophies. Terrorists trophies was fking annoying
---
The Beryl M762 is a Polish deriative of the Kalashnikov family of AK Assault rifles.
---
Everybody downvote to 69
---
Took me a decent amount of time - had the game since dust line decided two months ago i was going to go for it
---
If my team is defending first, we'll get rid of thermite on maps where he's gonna make a really big fuckin hole! Just makes most sites way easier to defend, other than that just monty
---
I think placements could be at your average rank last season, rather than your ending rank.  But personally I'm not a fan of total MMR reset at all, and would rather the amount of MMR gained and lost per match was reset.
---
Yup , on ps4 aswell
---
For a dumbass like Lil Yachty? Yeah.
---
I‚Äôm lost already.
---
That font. Why you're doing this to yourself
---
If you want you can go to the [R6 Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/rainbow6) and use the lfg (looking for game) channels to get a quick game going with a squad
---
I'll try that
---
The T hunt trophies terrify me
---
I was thinking rough in bed but no condoms but yeah let's go w rook
---
Yeah I agree Im not good at wording things also what platform you play on?
---
I haven‚Äôt much luck but maybe you‚Äôll do better than me.
---
Except cav is clash for me
---
Burst fire, or spend time learning it. Even though the recoil is intense, it's very predictable in its vertical kick.
---
You used up all of your luck, your gameplay is now eternally cursed
---
Xbox, and you?
---
This needs more foot traffic, you should submit this to Ubisoft for some possible testing
---
It‚Äôs uses about 70% of my cpu while loading into a game, anyone know of any settings to lower the usage through siege‚Äôs settings?

I'm not the best with hystorical symbols but is this an actual Nazi uniform? Something tells me Ubisoft would not add this into the game.

I hope they take years to fix the glitch and just disable her. Clash is gay.

ps4 I dont see many xbox players

If someone quits early in Overwatch (or if so many quit I can‚Äôt remember), the comp match cancels.

Easy solution. Make it so it only uses the highest rank of the squad if the deviation between them is greater then +/- 2 ranks. Lets so how many boosters still play ranked with their "copper" friends for the "challenge".

Also looking like the yacht on coastline

---
Thanks alot for the indepth response (=
---
Wut?
---
Will defenitely do that
---
I do think removing hostage was a good change to ranked but I wish secure didn't go too. Most of the good players don't play secure anyway, and anybody that thinks secure means easy rank ups will get knocked down once they play anybody in the higher ranks in bomb because they play so differently.
---
For solo queueing it was easier in particular because match-making with randoms can get really frustrating if the teamwork isn't there or toxicity spreads .
---
Thanks \^\^
---
Yeah, Xbox 1 isn't a very popular console (in terms of sales) compared to PS4, so there are just much fewer Xbox players.
---
I think I'm actually in it already. In a game right with someone from the uk
---
Well, if you take a look at therms elite...
---
Yeah that's where I got the idea it's kind of annoying but better than an unfair match IMO
---
Gotta love the blind melee
---
But it always was like that...
---
Takes a long ass time and is so obvious on some maps you'll just get shot in the process.
---
Looks like Wehrmacht, meaning it's the German army. Though it could very well be taken the wrong way even if it was Wehrmacht.
---
Since when are visuals not a part of gameplay?
---
They don't effect balance (Though some might argue they do, but barely) but they are a huge part of the gameplay.
---
I guess that's where my confusion came from.
---
That was pretty good
---
IMHO he was in a good spot. Good for sites with long angles and soft walls between them. They havn't changed him in regards to that so its all good but it still doenst make sense to remove his barb wire. UBI keeps trying to make all ops viable on every single map and site (or atleast it seems so). Nothing's wrong with having situational ops, its only bad if you need an op to win a site.
---
Thermite might thematically look like a nazi, but it's nowhere near like this.
---
yes but every time i wanna play him he is banned
---
I think they're trying to force people to their next game and killing off this one.
---
Dude, Thats fucking awesome, nice job!
---
#YOU CAME TO THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL
---
Iron Cross 2nd Class and the Knights Cross. Hmmmmmmmm
---
If anything you can have more fun with secure in casual, I get your frustration but secure in ranked just isn't right, you get the stupid standoffs especially on Oregon and theirs no point in half the ops on secure, echo hiding in OBJ stopping you getting in one single room...not competitive!
---
And they prefer to make ranked unplayable?
---
Welcome to early season ranked. Also known as, Tanked.
---
Those last two shots definitely should have hit her
---
People ban ops that aren't even hard to deal with, like instead of echo they choose cav, or blitz instead of ying when jager is banned
---
HOW COULD THEY.
---
I believe you are supposed to do it by standing on the ledge and facing the blue barrier gives you a repel prompt.
---
But that means I need to be good at the game :(
---
Hackerrrreeeeeeee
---
Thanks dude i appreciate it
---
Or, you could get good and adapt to the better mode.
---
yes but its annoying
---
JUST DON'T MOVE LOL

Or be a smurf and intentionally derank.

A classic ban phase is ash, blitz, cav, and echo
---
Wanna give me a link that works then?
---
Cries in Cavi
---
Both glitches have a hard reset now meaning it resets the players postion and drops them down to 5 health now who do it is fixed there‚Äôs still a problem in the regular coding but now with the reset it can‚Äôt heppen anymore
---
no.
---
No, in a squad (or at least through squad matchmaking). Lone wolf T-Hunt gives out significantly less renown.
---
Fire im shorter burst when farther from enemys
---
Okay like everyone I hate Clash but don‚Äôt use gay as a insult
---
Naw man I got out, it was a miracle, but i got out.
---
No, sounds like a good rework to me

First no kaid is ok but be shroud have a agoc on his aug

Yea, what‚Äôs with that? No mention of a trophy rework(?) in the patch notes.

I really loved doing double shock wire on Laundry Stairs. Most people were unable to jump that setup with drones, as well. Between that and shocking the hatch, you could be the one person to hold that room while everyone else held toward construction, since you would have enough warning if you needed help. 
---
Really going to miss that.
---
How? Almost every bomb site in seige ranked maps has More than 3 doors which means castle can‚Äôt barricade it all...
---
No, *im* crying
---
Well you obviously cared enough to reply so I don‚Äôt see where you are even coming from.
---
Yea but getting lots of renoun forces you to actually win the game.
---
No I can still use him without any of my ops I own being taken
---
I have that shitty version of siege where even base ops cost me 12500 (I think)
---
Bit yes, even with 12500 it should be possible to unlock enough
---
Sniper confirmed!
---
What did they give him instead?
---
Ur so lucky u have that much of a good internet
---
Beat me to it!!!!!!
---
The tts is a thing to
---
Console is so potato
---
The reset does not work
---
Okay but those changes only went to ranked. If you're looking for fun you shouldn't be playing ranked
---
While Ypu cant, can we still play him?
---
Okay calling it potent is just a fancy way of saying overpowered. And they're not overpowered. I'd say on the contrary. And if you can't control recoil, you can't use her gun, even then, with a sub par gadget you need a good gun.
---
Aww man, what? They didn't unlock for me
---
I'm neutral to this change, when I play Kaid, I've usually gone with the impacts. That said, removing his barbed wire for nitro doesn't make much sense. Barbed wire is a much better fit with his electroclaws.
---
Nokk isn‚Äôt invisible to the naked eye; only to cameras.
---
She also has silent step when her gadget is activated
---
What if they are bashing it with their gun?
---
Well this more follows with my other opinion that bad ping players should be matched up with other other bad ping players. Perhaps they could modify punishments depending on internet status? I did not really consider this because my post was obviously directed at those who leave intentionally.
---
Do we want to talk about ‚Äúproximity alarm‚Äù under electronic gadgets???
---
At 42s there's another thing (the defuse device) that shows up 4m away right before IQ starts shooting. Same as 50s and 5m away when the second defender begins defusing. Look at the top of the bomb silhouette :)
---
I haven't played for a bit. They removed him?
---
Thank üëç
---
Yes it does I played on the test server for weeks and about 8 hours on the live game it works I‚Äôve tried to to do it every time after about 6-10 seconds it resets your character model and drops your health down to 5

Yea I know it‚Äôs stupid, I don‚Äôt even have her and we‚Äôll there‚Äôs no point, let people try the new operators people
---
Recorded
---
They don't do that anymore
---
Yh you can‚Äôt use him in ranked anymore
---
It‚Äôs still incredibly annoying and honestly I think it‚Äôs going to hurt the game down the road. Every new operation all new operators will be banned, all current meta ops will be banned. It‚Äôs just annoying

That looks like a visual glitch with the shield. Takes 2 shots to break the shield with the magnum so it should‚Äôve had the animation of the shield breaking but it didn‚Äôt(I saw glass flying after each shot and sparks flying on kaid‚Äôs screen) that hit the shield twice broke it and then hit you but I think it‚Äôs a glitch where the shield doesn‚Äôt appear to break
---
Yeah so it can fall over as everyone laughs at it ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
She does, I've seen it happen twice in Casual and once in Ranked. Everyone should know by now it takes Ubi like 3 times to properly patch something out of the game
---
*damn that's a sexy ass glove*
---
Maybe the zombies have advanced, it has been awhile to be fair
---
He is good on attack, the only thing he is missing is a primary gadget but other than that his kit is actually good
---
Better than my entire team in ranked
---
she‚Äôs muh queen
---
Ahh, thanks!
---
He‚Äôs a very *handy* op to have around.
---
Honestly I believe taking away that choice ruins the game more than leaving it in, it restricts player‚Äôs choice and variety.
---
By all means, go ahead and play ranked then. I can guarantee you that there is a work around, but if you're confident then I wish you the best
---
"experience for those who are CASUAL players"

Say that again but slowly.

I volunteer IQ to suicide bomb by holding her Grenade, oh wait

This guy clutches hard

Mira?

Just prefire soft walls. Not trying to say anything but that trophy is the easiest if you have a knack for prefiring through walls
---
Thank you sir
---
Why was he mad?
---
It did for me I got confused when I got it
---
Yeah, but shooting gadgets won‚Äôt activate rff
---
You are literally on the place they discussed that they would be fixed soon. My brain.
---
Which is fine. It makes sense to a point. But not when we‚Äôre attacking every time. Every single game I‚Äôm attacking first with my group. It just isn‚Äôt fun and it‚Äôs making ranked way to try hardy at the moment.
---
Where is weu?
---
That would be so unfair
---
Yup, when they brought in N√∏kk they gave that holo to the FMG-9.
---
West Europe
---
Nah. Makes it a three shot. Muzzle is the way to go
---
If you crouch walk and you arent taking damage, I believe there is no effect unless it's a yokai drone or one of mozzie's hacked ones. Maybe maestro's evil eyes but I'm not sure
---
Fuck article 5
---
They pulled a lot to finish the new ghost recon. Stupid strategy IMO when this game has about 45-50 million copies sold and is a 4 year old game that grows with each update. Almost makes me think this is why we got no new weapons, a minor map rework, and old abilities rehashed all in one update.
---
Spiking the cinematic effects drops frame rate. Turn your settings down a bit
---
It's almost like there's maestros and bulletproofs and if you shoot the cam you are at huge risk of giving your way your position. Have you played her?
---
No they are not
---
I‚Äôm blessed tbh
---
You may be able to tell she is a certain room but you have no idea where she came from, where she is going, or if she is staying put. It puts a lot of pressure on the defense to figure all that information out without her being spotted on the cameras.
---
That‚Äôs fair I guess
---
I can probably play with you for cas but idk for ranked
---
exact same thing can be achieved by shooting the camera.
---
Yeah, coppers play so goddamn weirdly that it's so hard to come up with a counter on the fly.
---
By statistics he actually has the best dmr in the game with 84 dmg
---
already all on low.

PSA: Never play with your food :)

The entire Kafe map (especially upstairs) looks like it‚Äôs made out of plastic, mostly due to the lack of textures in the wood and barricades

I got back into r6 pretty late and only ever saw him with 2 klaws... This whole time I've been thinking that they should buff him to 3.

Wow

Well, I was at work when I saw this. I‚Äôm gonna try and post my attempt ASAP
---
They aren't gone. Clash can still shoot with her shield up
---
Who TF knows then. Ubi doesn't even know why claymores make you invisible
---
Pretty sure they changed that achievement or whatever to win 5 flawless ranked matches. I dont know why it wouldnt show uo that way though.
---
No, we need simple fixes for a broken game thats all.
---
Why Operation Health when they just could work for weekly hotfixes.
---
Pretty lazy to quit "Operations" because their game is broken.
---
If another developer patches in bugs, they might to try fixing it in beneath a couple days/weeks.
---
Good devs wouldn't need a operation health to make their game stable
---
Same here but with def seems to be random luck..
---
No it would be fun
---
Well only if you look at raw damage. But it's all about damage per second and that's where it sucks compared to any other attacker weapon.
---
Same here bro. I‚Äôm silver 3 and can say that this season has been the worst set of teammates. 
---
I‚Äôm usually gold1.
---
Did you even watch the video? Doesn‚Äôt matter if you like playing her. The glitch is still there
---
What? Lol. Not a single person was in objective in secure the area &amp; they won without any shots fired? That's why secure the area isn't in Ranked. Giving people false rank &amp; bragging rights. It's a fun mode at times don't get me wrong but it's too easy &amp; doesn't take much skill or strat to win or lose.
---
He has a thermal scope, but if you're moving you don't get the yellow thermal outline of enemies. Holding angles is basically the only way to get the thermal outline

Good ol bosg nose back with the siege content we need

Theres a big difference between covering a vunerable teammate and everyone sitting their defenseless

---
I believe the shotgun is in a good place rn. Extreme damage for extreme recoil.
---
4:3 gives you superior ability to use 1x sights, while 16:9 and higher fov's are better with acogs. Personally i play 16:10 so i can get the best of both worlds.
---
Well if you want to swap accounts or something feel free to slide in my DM‚Äôs.
---
Get good at controlling recoil, every attachment is all up to personal preference
---
Das wut I‚Äôm saying
---
Exactly, though a lot of maps generally favor defense. Much more fair and in general, fun that way
---
Sure we‚Äôll play casual and if you‚Äôre willing we can do ranked maybe?
---
Wait man i got the trophy 2 hours ago in a casual. Wtf?
---
Definitely room for abuse
---
Definitely situational my squad will just adapt it‚Äôs good to have something fresh. Good luck man
---
Go to community options and open it, you should see options for User Flair
---
haha right?! now im paranoid and camp that shit like its my child.
---
Before the new xp system, getting to lvl 50 took pretty long
---
I think the fact that she has silent step as an attacker is her strong suit. I‚Äôm pushing a room and then I get peek without hearing anything....like normal from every attacker at the first few days of a season with shitty sound, except N√∏kk is actually supposed to be near silent.
---
Thanks for sharing, IQ is my main and I never thought of this
---
Well N√∏kk is invisible to cameras. The known Vigil effect is only for echo drones and valk cams iirc. So she can sneak into rooms silently without getting detected by cams. Thats her purpose
---
The novel and game that the series is based on literally revolves around RAINBOW stopping eco-terrorist attacks orchestrated by an American biotechnology firm, but okay.
---
Your point about Rainbow Six being about the role of the United States and similar Western countries is moot. RAINBOW falls under the supervision of NATO and is composed of operatives from around the world, from Russia to Columbia and from the United States to Israel. It's not about the West vs. "evil foreign threats", its about an *international* unit organized to combat significant terrorist threats, regardless of the location. There's nothing imperialist about it, it's a neutral counter-terrorism unit being deployed to eliminate *any* terrorist threat.
---
The name RAINBOW literally stems from the team being an international unit that shows no favor to any particular country.
---
Yeah man no problem my GT is: The brown cow89
---
I love watch dogs but idk why ppl hate the game i both games am curious what will be wd legion
---
I do frag out quite often as monty just running in. He's op, there's a reason why I use him in ranked.
---
Don't stress over your placements too much. It's low key pretty easy to get back into gold. I solo queue and sometimes like to ride the copper train down a few ranks but I always bring it back up. I have also noticed a huge increase in completely useless players in ranked over the last few weeks, not just with the new season. Every single ranked game I've played lately I have at least 1 or 2 teammates that never get a kill. How do you play 9 rounds and not kill one person?
---
Russian acog is already very slim, Zofia‚Äôs lmg has a high firerate and the largest mag in the game so its a no to those two
---
If you are talking about weekly challenges, they are moving to Thursday instead of Tuesday
---
...and here I watched this to see if a guy was going to risk his life to save a fern.
---
No they suck
---
You don't
---
Usually my team bans hibana so they have to use thermites charges on hatches and not walls or maverick it.
---
‚ÄúHowdy diddly ho!‚Äù
---
Thatcher?
---
Its only 10 wallbang kills shouldn't be rare as r6 was already tracking em and I got my trophy when I loaded up the game. Who doesn't shot through walls in typical enemy camp spots?
---
This was upvoted.
---
Yes this has been criticized endlessly already
---
Man, you guys complain about everything.
---
From what I understand, the devs have been working on Ghost Recon so they don't have a lot of time to create or fix things this season or next season.
---
What his was on realistic
---
Thats fair, they dont even have to rebalance some other maps, just a simple facelift would be amazing
---
Thx, just did it and worked.
---
Remember Blitz elite lmao
---
Ubisoft introduced a failsafe that will undo the actions that led to the exploit appearing...
---
...but people found another sequence of actions that triggers the exploit and is invisible to the failsafe protocols.
---
Maybe this is because they all worked on Quarantine more than Siege.
---
Wait why shouldn't they be outside?
---
Because everyone has fun in different ways. Recruit rush and Tachanka are a hoot to play. Also recruit has different weapon load outs that regular ops don‚Äôt have, like FBI shield.

One don't go off the charts. Because fun fact they're really really small values. So pc makes up about 25% of the siege community. Just going off console sales that number could be different. And they only base their charts of those pc players, so there goes a couple million stat results from console. And that 25% is lowered heavily as they only take data from the pc players if they're plat or above which cuts the 25% pretty much by 75% of that number. Which in science is a very bad bad idea as less results equals less validity. So no you really shouldn't go off those shitty charts. Also Ela's been nerfed 6 times publically with 0 buffs. Vertical recoil 1, horizontal recoil 2, damage 3, less magazine size 4, impacts 5, "buff" to vertical recoil 6. I say "Buff" because that vertical buff made the horizontal even worse so technically it's a nerf and cancels it out. And no fire rate really doesn't mean shit. DMR's are usually semi auto and can beat any gun in game is they do so please even if it's say the scorpion or vector. low damage, equals low kill potential at any range. And for Ela low damage, plus horrible recoil horizontally and fall off range means she really can't engage past 2ft. Buddy is a joke you know that right? Do you not understand common phrases in English conversations when you're proving someone wrong? And Ela being is an opinion not a fact, because to a lot of people she's pretty shit. Ask many of Ela's actual mains they'll tell you she's pretty shit. That's an opinion but a lot valid of one since we actually use her a lot more than the average fellow. Also Ela's gun doesn't shoot in 1.5 seconds. Runs out of bullets in 2.7777777777777777777777777777777777777777777 repeating sevens, seconds. At least according to the calculator I used. Her gun shoots a bullet every .05 repeating seconds. .05 repeating times 41 bullets is 2.7 repeating. And most of Ela's more recent buffs really weren't needed. After her first few in being her recoil nerfs and lose of mag size and impacts the other ones really asked for our needed and have really dropped Ela's ability to actually roam effectively. Barbed wire does not help rotate does it? Especially when you can just punch it twice and boom it's gone. Shield and barbed wire on a roamer asides from Jager since he doubles as both roamer and anchor, is just stupid. Doesn't help them in much of any way. And like I said mines are good, at the end of rounds when there are few people left so thank you for reinforcing my point.
---
If you play enough ranked you should be able to know which strategies work on the map, and ban operators accordingly.
---
For example, if you're playing on Oregon, you can ban Mira to prevent the team from holding closet effectively, or on attack you could ban hibana so they need to risk the hard breach with thermite or mav. It's not about knowing who plays what well, it's about countering strats so people need to improvise and improve over time, instead of using tried-and-true strategies that always work.
---
Pros just get the added benefit of knowing who plays what, but they're so good that they may have prepared for a different strategy than what the enemy team suspects, which could make their bans work in their favor.
---
Yeah I logged in for the first time in a while yesterday. What's up with that?
---
As a smurf, I have an answer.
---
Once you‚Äôve peaked in rank for the season, and your mmr moves and a grinding 1 - 5 mmr a game. It‚Äôs not worth trying to improve until the reset.
---
Additionally, you‚Äôre versing opponents who, aswell as being in a similar situation, are so close to tour skill level that every match goes to overtime match point. 
---
As someone who enjoys the prospect of getting a higher rank next season, versing opponents where everyone goes 5 kills at most isn‚Äôt a very effective way to train aim and gamesense
---
So what else to do but crush a lower ranks, hitting higher and higher kill counts, I can practise my aim, ability to tackle more than one opponent at the same time. And learn new strats without the harshness of a similarly skilled gamer shutting down my idea before it‚Äôs perfected.
---
I generally don‚Äôt queue a full squad when I‚Äôm smirking so I feel like I‚Äôm also helping out anyone on my team who needs a boost, even if it‚Äôs at the expense of the other.
---
Also smurf v smurf battles are fun as.

Bruh moment

People have been exploiting a glitch with her so they decided "Hey, instead of fixing her lets just remove her"
---
The game is fixed
---
Want to party up, then? I was Gold last season.
---
There are 80-100 weapons already in this game. We don't need new guns with every new season if there are plenty of underused guns. N√∏kk has been great for me. Decent enough guns and the FMG basically feels like a new gun as I've never used it on smoke.
---
For Warden I think the movement stopping his ability needs to be tweaked to allow more. Standing still or having limited movement is dead in this game. I understand the limitation but it's to strict right now.
---
a pretty small hole though... your aim would have to be spot on to get it in there
---
Sound whoring is too strong already in some situations.... let‚Äôs not push it too far. There‚Äôs a lot of audio problems and bugs but making everything perfectly audible with no counters but cav and nokk is too far man

Crywank/10

I took a good oath and i promised to never use acog again its going great so far and i recomend it

How many fucking seasons
---
Because the average /r/rainbow6 user has an IQ lower than their elo, so generally in the 30-50 range.
---
? It's in the game, and will remain as it's feature of perspectives
---
Ehh. The FMG was underused for a reason and it still feels like the trash gun I stopped using the first week I had the game. Plus she's an attacker and to me all of her weapons feel like defender weapons
---
Blursed image
---
Now everytime you activate it whisper: *Out of sight, out of mind*
---
I remember when you initially posted this very curious to see where it does from here
---
So why not just casual?
---
Yeah I understand that and that‚Äôs what the video explains but a lot of people weren‚Äôt getting it
---
Check Rogue9 map change video. A lot of maps already got this overhaul. Villa for example.
---
Holy fuckaroos that's good
---
Fair point.
---
No? The defenders get an entire block of attack afterwards, if anything it's more balanced.
---
If you get attack first round on Chalet, and attack overtime, you basically win by default.
---
Nah I got a man in my squad who loves her and has an ace under his belt with her. If you're good at the game, she's an EZ counter.
---
They did add a pro league playlist. And it must have done well considering they implemented it into ranked.
---
This is dope, you're hella talented.
---
Damn, I can‚Äôt believe I struggled on this with a gun when I was a beginner lol
---
Ah from your phrasing I thought you were complaining as well
---
but they don‚Äôt see nothing. there‚Äôs a pixel effect on their screen that tells you that nokk is there
---
Your time will come, don't even look at your rank! It effects me negatively if I know what's at stake. So I would try that.
---
They do have those other weapons but they are basicially all frag ops, they have no gadget to help their team in anyway.
---
Trying not to get my hopes up for much, honestly, but we‚Äôll see what happens!
---
How do you record your rounds like this? Just got the game 3 days ago and got a 5v1 ace last night to win the OT match point and really wished I could record it like this?
---
I think you forgot a "/s"
---
Me too!! NotABot1138
---
I can translate: "A danger, not to smoke"
---
You're trading a whole operator for a piece of barbed wire or a nitro cell, that isn't a good trade.
---
Here's the thing, why was recruit never played at pro level, if he is as good as you say?
---

Operation Health is a 3 month peroid wherein-

It‚Äôs opinionated, but I feel like your in the right here, especially if you were on Defense first. Mira, if used correctly is a ‚Äúpower house‚Äù and chances are you would know more and how to use Mira more effectively then the enemy team, giving you an advance there, as well as there are numerous work around to get rid of a Mira when you are on attack.
---
A speedrun sub?!.. i might create one tonight
---
*is

I stoped playing Siege, the games too broken, everyones uses mouse and keyboard in the higher ranks. Theres more to it but no sense complaining further. Just wanted to vent and hopefully find out I'm not the only one who feels this way. ( on xbox btw )
---
Had the same problem with Fortnite. Uninstalled. With R6 if you play a casual match or 2 your reflexes will come back. Fuck fortnite.
---
They called themselves socialists but politically and idealogically they were far from being left wing.
---
However it is common alt-right/nazi rhetoric to try and blame the left for Nazism, its part of their propoganda machine so maybe do some research on the topic to try and get away from all that.

---
If you want to get really technical, Finka's spear isn't even a legit gun, the Vector .308 for Lion doesn't exist. The French operators on defense use German manufactured weapons, which the Secret Service should be using in this game. The K1A is a carbine listed as an SMG, Kaid is just Bandit+Ela, Hibana is just ranged thermite, Alibi and Vigil were supposed to be one operator, Maestro is just a different permutation of Echo, Ying is just Fuze with flashes, lesion is just Kapkan with a DOT effect. I can go on for days, they are planning to have 100 operators, it's inevitable to have a few with very similar or hybrid abilities.

stuff about internet, I asked if they are able to put out some hotfix on it, the support said that they weren‚Äôt able to, which I assume that the support team can‚Äôt do anything

It‚Äôs more annoying to deal with then it is difficult, just like Lesion. I feel like a workaround would be better then removing her from the game however, as it is a small amount but some people really like to play her and I‚Äôm going to be honest she‚Äôs quite fun to use, more so in casual then ranked though. Don‚Äôt feel like it was the best idea to put a shield operator on attack, but that‚Äôs beside the point. What would you guys do different to make clash have the same appeal, but be more balanced when coming to go against her?

I'm nuht gunna try to juustify et

They're overrated

Same happened to a friend in ranked. He also had to restart the game

*notices like 5 posts in the sub about 1v5 matches in ranked*
---
Uh. Yeah. Ranked is sure out of beta.
---
I just started playing on Xbox. Rank 11. What do I have yo look forward to?
---
To be honest this feeling came from never actually putting serious effort into bomb. I‚Äôve just played my first ten matches this season and maybe the first three I didn‚Äôt enjoy but after that I started getting into it more. It‚Äôs a bit more sweaty but in a good way. I can see myself growing to love it actually which a couple of hours ago I didn‚Äôt think I would say!
---
Why exactly are you so triggered? All I said was its funny that they cant fix shit, like how shit must the dev's be that they put a already retarded character in the game, and it ends up being the most broken glitchy character it's funny how dumb they are lmfao but hey stay triggered retard HAhA
---
I‚Äôm confused then. I‚Äôve seen his rhetoric about how capitalism, perpetuated by the Jews, was what caused Germany‚Äôs misfortune. And isn‚Äôt the right more leaning toward less government? In that case, why did he take over businesses and repurpose them for war? I‚Äôm really confused because I just assumed these were leftist policies myself, not talking points or propaganda
---
Bandit has the same gun but a flash hider, an extra reinforcement, 4 hard breach denial batteries...
---
But only has 1 set of utility.
---
Do you play bomb? What elo do you play ranked at? I'm genuinely confused how recruit could ever be viable, he's not played for a reason.
---
I‚Äôm not usually that bad
---
Good thing Pick and Ban is in ranked now.
---
Well if you haven't played very much you don't know where the bombsites are, so you're more likely to just drive your drone around aimlessly

Yeahhhh

Why is that even possible to be shown?

This happened to me yesterday, and I thought it was fixed

No fuck you. They‚Äôre trying their hardest to get these glitches and pieces of shit like you aren‚Äôt helping. Try writing a line of code as complex as this games, then comment a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù. At least then you‚Äôd realize how much of a cunt you‚Äôre being.

I feel like reusing the guns was a good call, as it opened up new buffs and implementations for the guns, like the D-50, for example. Some could make the argument that they could of done that as well as have new guns, but if the new operators were to get new guns, the new stuff for the pre existing weapons probably wouldn‚Äôt happen. I‚Äôm ok with them re-using guns every now and then, but if the new operators, all of them from now on have old weapons, that‚Äôs a different story.
