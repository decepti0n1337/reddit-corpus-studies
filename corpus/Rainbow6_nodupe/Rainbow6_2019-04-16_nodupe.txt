I am aware, and now that I think about it, that was worded incorrectly. He called me a kid because he got mad that he knew I was right and that i wouldn't back away from my point, and he called me a kid because it gives him +700000 cool points to the 2 others reading the argument

Early June I‚Äôd say. We should be getting the next season announced on May 18-19 at the Pro League finals in Milan, Italy. Then a week before that we should be getting teasers of the next ops.
---
You know they are both attackers right
---
You‚Äôre argument is still wrong, it *IS* against the subreddit rules to post this
---
Thanks! I'm going to go into ranked next vid :)
---
Someone buff the recoil pattern to a more linear pattern. I've honestly started using the AA-12 in roaming
---
Ohhh thanks for specifying
---
Bro people rage quit cas too. Which is even more dumb cause in ranked you lose elo, but in casual theres no real negative side you get renown either way.

oof
---
Only ever played seasons 1 and 2 and I just lurk here so I'm definitely biased but Black Ice is the best skin ever, don't @ me
---
Candelas are effective in a lot of situations, but (IMO) the ability to kill soft walls and flash/concuss from a distance is more universal. Zofias guns are very good, her LMG being pretty underrated.
---
dude have u made sure u redownloaded the pass?
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Smg11: Y‚Äôall are both pussies
---
What happened to that breach charge
---
How you get that "*operator* main" tag?
---
I‚Äôve said it in a post before I think we should be able to remap buttons so you could make the up on the d pad a toggle to let you lean without aiming instead of select fire because that is never really used so why not let it become a way to toggle leaning with no aim press up on the d pad to toggle on now when you press in L3 and R3 you lean but knifing and running would obviously get disabled to allow this and when you think you wanna run and knife again just press up on the d pad again to turn it off
---
No one forced you to play it
---
They were all born during the time of the Soviet Union, but they work for the Modern Russian Federation.
---
What IQ skin is that on the Aug?
---
This is why I am a Glaz main.
---
wanted the shield too, but got the helmet wich isnt so bad, now at least i  have all defenders attention, and my teammates can kill them while they go, wtf lol.
---
I use it over her other gun
---
Make it a defender op that is highlighted red from Lion in honor of the Lion Nerf R.I.P Lion
---
i though lesion didnt stack.
---
Oh they very much do, same concept, aim at one spot, throw your mines there. They‚Äôll stack if you do it fast enough for them to land on each other‚Äôs hit box, but not too fast where they‚Äôll just bounce all over the place.
---
black ice is still cleaner
---
So Fuze main goes to BO4 and starts using Battery's Cluster bombs
---
What a shot what rank was it?
---
No they don‚Äôt, they keep above your head for a good 10 seconds before they hit any shots. Trust me, I have at least 40 hours of T Hunt
---
Yea but it only works on quantum level. The smaller angle of direction of movement and you, the speed is more visible.
---
it was never gone. and you can't post peoples names here, this isn't ubisoft support
---
All squares are rectangles, therefore some rectangles (those that are squares) have to be squares. Most rectangles are not squares, but a square IS a rectangle. You're the one that's wrong, my boy.
---
\*goes into hostage game with this guy sets record for hostages killed........Fuze deletes himself from game

I don't think Ubi can enforce anything until Microsoft or Sony let them, but its still frowned upon.

While true, I'm still a huge fan of the AUG. It's so well controlled, and while it's got a slow fire weight, it's a gun that feels good when I use it.
---
I LITERALLY PUT THIS ON THE FUCKING FORUMS AND i DIDNT EVEN GET A SINGLE COMMENT BACK, it should be a legendary alpha pack only item tho
---
OP, how in the hell do you have a hitmarker?

‚ÄúHey let‚Äôs run into this mega prefire lmao‚Äù

She's about as useful as Frost, so she can hold her own in the lower ranks but the further up you go the less impact she has.

Hamood? Hamood.

Aaallliiibbbiii

Its just a shower
---
Personally I'd say more counterplay rather than just more counters.
---
I think OW is a good example of where things go wrong, and you end up with games being decided at spawn and skill stops mattering.
---
Meanwhile there are many much more liked operators without significant counters, like Zofia or Twitch. This is because even though they dont really have direct counters, there is plenty of counterplay in that their jobs (being fragging) require them to put themselves at risk of being shot.
---
I personally think Blitz is already oozing counterplay, he's just frustrating. As for Jackal, Lion and Dokkaebi, I dont think they should just add more counters, I think they need rethinks to put then in a form where people are able to use their own skill to mitigate the threat they cause.
---
Is uhhhhhhh... Ela Jewish?
---
I would use commando you get some extra bullets and higher dps plus a cool reload animation.
---
Tried, they didn't do shit
---
Is that the one that's effectively mouldy wood?
---
i only use echo for his gun
---
Probably not for awhile, even ops like maverick that came out awhile ago have like barely any skins
---
And 25kg
---
Looks like someone attends prestigious bartlett university.
---
Mute, thermite, kaid and maverick
---
Yeah Finka rush with her shotgun is pretty fun.

Probably just a loading glitch, i would just restart should fix it.

Wait, don't you love watching dozens of similar clips with epileptic editing topped with le funny epic meymeys and loud kewl sounds?
---
It's called A R T, you know
---
Except he was to the left of you
---
Except black ice was never originally available for any gun except frosts super 90 through an exclusive money only bundle. Until alpha packs came out wayyy later
---
It seems you are in a good High School
---
I could see that working. I just think it works better in proleagues because it's coordinated. In ranked people will fight for it and it's going to end up being wasted.
---
Isnt that her default face?
---
Your first comment literally gave the idea, you don't need the reply dipshit
---
If you "don't care" about casual, why'd you queue? Do you not see how it looks just leaving?
---
True but ranked is even more stressful. Why play then.
---
Literally every 2 speed is great except for maybe frost
---
Well, sadly we got polish "special" ops who are widely known IRL for such great combat situations like patrolling football stadiums and cleaning toilets after US/UK forces in Iraq. 
---
I can barely imagine what kind of content pure polish season could have.
---
Put it on your gun, no one will notice a pink charm. They will absolutely notice a giant pink unicorn head or fursuit.

But I think there needs to be 2.0s of operators to keep the game fun and tactical. The issue definitely will be power creep but as we see with Kaid and Bandit, people will still make a choice depending on how they want to play and what suits the objective. I think you made valid points about the base ops having counters to each other and I think that some of the DLC ops have caused changes because they dont have direct counters, but with the pace of 8 new ops a year, they have to try and plan ahead a little, so maybe later ops will be countered more heavily by current ops. I think another issue is that people still pick certain ops, like ash, for her fragging ability more than the gadget, which is okay in some ways but it's in big part because of her hitbox. If ubi made playing as the big ops have a greater advantage than now then it would be fine, but that balance is tough. I think siege definitely would have died if they didnt add new ops all the time because then it's just like all the other shooters, where a certain strategy becomes dominant and remains dominant. At least in siege you can have totally unique combinations of ops and do fine, and as they approach 100 ops this will become more blatant and more interesting. I think the cancer meta is an issue, but according to the pick rate graphs, they arent used as often as we believe, it's just annoying to see them, but that comes down to not having an answer for the Intel ops, so hopefully counter intel, or counter rush ops will be coming to the game this year.

*Hello, fellow peasants*
---
I do this with fuze, but if you dont shout suppressing fire like Cyril its not as effective
---
I have a Pro and my game size is 57.4gb
---
Zofia‚Äôs LMG is seriously the most underrated gun in the game.
---
I like the concept. To ensure that all maps are being rotated properly, perhaps the algorithm will take into account the least played maps among the players within the past 5 rounds or so, and make it a sum of all players and the lowest scored maps get to be voted on. So if Map A, B, C, D, E, F were all played, then the most recently played map gets the most points from the player.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So if I played Border last round, the system would give it 5 points, and if my teammate played Border five rounds ago, it gets 1 point. it goes on throughout each player. 
---
All the points are added, per map, and the lowest scored maps are voted. 
---
This algorithm concept, I think would work best if the map pool is MUCH smaller. Perhaps this is what they already have, but we do not know.
---
TLDR, if they were to put a voting system in, they may have to overhaul the map selection system to accommodate it. But who knows? Ubisoft.
---
R.I.P rank
---
Honestly not sure why they changed it from the original, was completely fine
---
Gee, it's as if this totally wasn't what his character was insinuating to AT ALL...
---
Yee
---
IQ was hot for me since her face reveal with Elite skin, and Twitch became a lady since her face ‚Äúbuff‚Äù in Grim Sky
---
I love that gun so fucking much
---
Not a good ace, i fucking hate spawn peelers with a passion
---
Focusing on one thing he has said and making that like 75% of your description is just sad
---
Once IQ's elite came out I had to cop and I was so happy they fixed twitch's face
---
I think the ace was pretty expensive. Jokes aside, I think it was a good ace.
---
Thanks man!
---
I just posted an essay for a concept gadget that does a similar role to J√§ger. Maybe you could check it out??
---
I feel you. Sad for me, I can't even upgrade this year; I'm still underage and my parents want me to study instead of working, not evne studying and working. So yeah, I'm fucked.
---
I'm sorry. I ramble a lot.
---
I feel attacked
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
awesome where do i find it
---
They reinforced all of kids bedroom
---
Blame Ubi for introducing skill based matchmaking into casual a couple of years back. Now the only way to play against low skill people is to smurf and derank in ranked.
---
Just love this map ü¶Ä with all the spawn peek spots
---
Nigger boy
---
Yo my guy. No shit, I was that recruit with the defuser running up to you guys (Vocal.Taciturn). That was a great match (and yes, that smexy Monty Jill too). Wasn‚Äôt there like 2 of the guys in the other team that wasn‚Äôt going along with the recruit shtick? Like one of them only played smoke (one of you guys pointed out that ‚Äúof course that‚Äôs how a .9 KD boosted plat would play‚Äù) and the other played Valk and J√§ger?
---
We should play together again sometime, that was great!

Tought this was ingame at first

And those people should get banned.

Am I the only one who have noticed that, Ubi keep releasing ugly female and handsome male ops? Ubi gay?
---
Which platform? I‚Äôm having the same issue on pc.
---
I think it‚Äôs into a girl from a guy
---
Ew, I get not liking the new one but that face was BAD.
---
pootis
---
They're doing nothing wrong though. Every game needs a no mm casual, and a ranked, just Ubi decided to have theirs the other way around.
---
Keep it up, dude
---
Yeah give it back my usaename isn‚Äôt relevant anymore.
---
Can i get to say who my main is? How!!
---
No, they changed it somewhat recently and... well... read other comments and/or look it up, not sure how to describe it besides different.
---
Black ice shield with invisible mont....

Too OP

If that yoki can fly with a c4 on, that‚Äôs game changer fam.

What did he say?

What‚Äôs the point in complaining about free cosmetics? You are just adding to the rule-breaking spam.

Yeah surprised I didn‚Äôt get bum rushed
---
but if you throw enough people at the bullets, eventually they'll run out of bullets!
---
*every soviet leader during both world wars*
---
That would be cool, might increase server load time and might cause constant repetition. I guess if you don‚Äôt like a map and everyone else does then it also might be bad. But I guess if they did it just right it could work
---
She wants a piece of her senpai
---
Happy birthday to the ground!
---
Weird - I created a smurf as well and had to buy all the year one ops, although just a few months ago I created another smurf and didn‚Äôt need to buy any.
---
They are making the game worse for others which is more than enough of a reason for Ubisoft to take action. If you want to stomp on lower skill players you can play t hunt.

You‚Äôre going to run into a lot of toxicity especially as a new player. They have mute options for both chat and voice that will come in handy. 
---
Don‚Äôt forget to lean and ADS.
---
If you don‚Äôt know where to reinforce, watch where everyone else puts theirs. You should also observe if there are any hatches on the ceiling that needs to be reinforced as that is pretty important. 
---
If there is a Mira on the team, make sure you don‚Äôt reinforce in places they don‚Äôt want. They tend to get angry over that. 
---
Never ever reinforce kids bedroom in the House map. 
---
That‚Äôs all I can think of as of now. 
---
Most importantly, have fun!
---
Well done
---
Theres no excuse to teamkilling, but I think you should have been aware that you had a defuser, you can choose to pick it up or not in the operator selection screen.
---
Ehhhhh they do though?
---
Is that not from in-game?
---
Tf
---
I feel you. I want the old blitz back ):
---
Learn the maps, common reinforcement spots, hatches on everymap, stuff like this can get you ways.
---
I think that we hit a point a little while ago where every other new operator is frustrating or a simple rehash of others unlike early seasons where it was changing the meta in a fun and meaningful way. However this entire post holds very little water for the points it makes as it's based around the idea of those operators you listed being some sort of OP meta which is just flat out wrong. 
---
For starters even before Lion was banned from competitive this was never the default meta in pro league. If it was some unbeatable setup, why would it not be used in the most competitive medium? Lion was of course busted and has since been both nerfed and quarantined. Meanwhile operators like Ying and Jackal get use for specific strats or maps but certaintly not must picks and blitz hardly ever gets picked. 
---
As far as ranked play while this meta can be kind of a problem it's because its so incredibly frustrating and unfun to deal with in the moment but especially since lion's nerf it has never been some unbeatable meta you have to follow. Maybe for gold stomping but for a serious match between good teams it actually sucks pretty hard. There's no hard breacher and even if you subbed one of the operators out for one it still wouldn't be all that good. Just look at the operator stats in the latest dev blog, the only operator you listed that is picked more than average (in platinum-diamond rank on pc) is Jackal who has THE worst win delta of any attacker. Not to mention every operator except Dokk has a below average win delta.
---
Basically I think the problem is that they're been scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas since year three began and as a result many of the newer ops are either irrelevant or relevant but really annoying. Clash is a great example as she's pretty terrible overall but still just really not fun to deal with and doesn't really contribute anything positive to the game's meta. 
---
But yeah this assertion 
---
&gt; ...with the current attack meta being Ying, Dokkaebi, Jackal, Lion, and Blitz. Playing around this Meta greatly increases your chances of succeeding on attack ...
---
is not true and you built your entire argument around it.
---
Shut up Ceryl
---
That operator is lion. He has a flying drone over the map (that you can see when you look over your head outside [only when he‚Äôs picked by the attacking team]) that detects ennemy movement when activated. So basically, that drone detects movement by defensive players. He currently shows the outline of player‚Äôs movement (movement with the left joystick if you‚Äôre console and arrow keys if you‚Äôre on PC, so basically you can spin around and crouch or wtv and not be detected)
---
I won‚Äôt go deep into the detels of his ability because its litteraly being rework tomorrow in the next patch. He‚Äôll seem a lot more lackluster and boring for new players like you but he will be a lot more balanced for high ranked players and competitive players.
---
You chose a good time to start this game because the devs really made this game a lot friendlier to newcomers! Goodluck in ranked when you hit level 30! Making friends and running with a fun squad in ranked is what makes this game addictive!
---
Play on PC xD
---
Ha this is great. Keep posting fun stuff like this.
---
Ikr, and I'm gonna sound like a Total weirdo but the old hibana was cuter.
---
I mean battlefield kicks that effect to an extreme, but I am thinking of something really minut, just so that it gives the attacker or defender the initiative to  suppress fire. Because ATM for what I have seen, people don't tend to suppress fire instead prefer running in balls-deep( sorry for my language)
---
Oh thats really good. I like this.
---
Ok dude just wanted to say that raging because someone is better than you is just not how to handle problems, also t hunt is not nearly as fun as multyplayer. Aswell as I know plenty of people that are good but cant move up because of bad teammates (mabye people like you) and stay in lower levels because 1v5 no matter how good you are is hard against a team that is even a tiny bit coordinated.
---
Yo what the fuck I know this is from gta sa but read it in thermites voice!
---
Thanks my guy
---
Please, I beg u ubi
---
Who took the photo?
---
When you really think about it, there is suppression in any game. If you can shoot over or around their cover to keep them from shooting back, boom, job done. In Siege with the one shot headshots, you hold fire with an LMG long enough at head level the guy will peek at some point then that's a freebie.
---
Is this on console?
---
The developers never seem to be satisfied with her character model's face and change it every few seasons.
---
The fans are also never satisfied what the devs do to her face and are constantly asking for them to change it.
---
Vladof! You don't need to be a better shot, you just need to shoot more bullets
---
as long as they don‚Äôt add jumping we good.
---
Yeah I wouldnt like jumping in siege, its unnecessary imo.
---
Any video tutorial u have, I need to practice my valk cams, and I am unable to find anything.
---
yes but thermite is her mentor
---
The problem in siege is that you don‚Äôt have enough bullets for suppressive fire. You‚Äôd need like 500.
---
Ehh only in Europe
---
To me adding jumping would be worse than giving every defender an acog and nitro cell.
---
You misspelled rook behind a deployable shield
---
New old face
---
Lot of people just feel she's never really had a decent-looking one, simple as that.
---
I mean while r6 is all about that headshots, we have to admit to the fact that at least in casual everyone is all about the kills and we also have to acknowledgement the fact that some guns are pretty underwhelming (looking at you Nomad), so having a system that awards you for pinning down enemy while a sledge runs up on them like a  dog who has seen a treat, would help in reducing toxic behavior and build teamwork.
---
Great..  
---
I feel this will be my property of the season. .. yeaa..
---
Thats helpful lmao
---
And to be honest, if you look the easter egg photo closely, you will find she is closer to Thermite. I just don‚Äôt think the distance between Pulse and her is the distance between lovers.
---
What about the first one? I was most likely dead in this link, but it just wanted to show it happened again
---
Yeah blitz is a scummy character
---
Thanks i didn't know that :)
---
This looks like a way better redesign than her current one. More personality while retaining that aggressive/determined look.
---
Sidenote, she looks like [Natalie Portman](https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2018/10/AP_18285729057974.jpg) here.
---
To be honest it‚Äôs not trying to hurt her what would hurt her is if her goggles were removed and she would be blinded by her gadget as well if she had no skill
---
That he didn‚Äôt like Casino
---
Damn, checkmate.
---
Killcams have been all sorts of fucked up recently. Reticles sometimes don't render at all and the replay itself is just a straight up lie. Don't believe killcams for the time being. It would've looked very different on his screen.
---
For some reason nobody is doing well in ranked this season. I don‚Äôt know if the distribution curve of good people change or what but a LOT of people are having trouble getting to where they should be in ranked.
---
What do you think FN stands for?
---
What you described is a secure area shit sandwich of best kind. Best way to avoid it is winning or being killed before the last man standing situation. If the room is secured by 3 guys who are not complete bots and you are new to the game there is no way to win this, except you are able to lure them out and pick them off one by one, which is hard in secure, like I said if they aren‚Äôt complete bots, because securing is a safe win.
---
Just you
---
But... Technically, you don't look at her face when you're playing her, others will, so you're paying for others to don't see her bad base look, which is kind of you lol
---
oh fuck
---
I would rather them balance over powered ops first I mean wouldn‚Äôt you rather see a hole in your wall fixed before you buy paint
---
I got it and it just looks like a wet cardboard box :(
---
There's a YouTube doc about the Iranian embassy hostage rescue and in the video they interview one of the sas members that helped and he looks EXACTLY like the elite skin
---
Well thermite is her close friend and teacher as well, she met pulse through her definitely. The pictures just show a group of friends/colleagues having fun at a picnic or vacation that's all. But it shows that 3 are very well acquainted with each other. So the distance and all doesn't explain having or not having a relationship tbh.
---
You better do that
---
Militias don‚Äôt fucking work, you dense motherfucker. Thats why the White House was burned down in the war of 1812, because militias suck. They‚Äôre impossible to organize, train, and arm efficiently.
---
You said ‚ÄúEurope‚Äù so you don‚Äôt have to be specific and because you dont know what you‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs also totally irrelevant and I don‚Äôt give a shit about their laws in this context.
---
Yea, it‚Äôs right in the constitution ‚ÄúEveryone should be able to afford a suppressors and automatic belt fed machine gun‚Äù. 
---
Koresh was fucking kids you sick fuck. And they murdered 3 ATF agents and poured gasoline all over the compound during the siege, which is what started the fires that killed most of the people.
---
Thank fucking god people like you are ignored, because you‚Äôve got some dumb fucked up shit floating around in your watery brain.
---
I mean there is not too many times I get hit by a blitz flash it‚Äôs mostly called I have a mostly invincible 2 speed that has barely seeable pixels for hit boxes since when the op is so shielded you want to reach for the c4 so it‚Äôs not a boss battle then you have a problem
---
LMG E is just for that, well done!
---
Stop with the thachanka memes so ubi actually has a reason to buff him
---
It would start a meta of people just constantly tap firing doors when defending. Good luck winning a gunfight while half blind and with aim flipping everywhere when you have to push a room.
---
When my brother plays Maestro he fires 30 or so bullets and then stops so they think he has to reload, half a second later he starts up again.
---
Works every time.

I get thatcher but twitch seems stupid since she has taser darts not hacking darts

Three bullet marks on the shield? His shield would be dead after 1

It‚Äôs easy to counter to be honest since if he tries to shoot you enough you can instantly kill it I think this was for the bronze players who have no aim
---
I address the blue mechanic in a previous comment, like bf takes to to a whole another level , it doesn't even need to be noticeable, hell even the arrow markers we use atm can suffice.
---
To be honest I just want to give her some recoil and take away 5 damage just to eat the community have a fit
---
17-6 on platinum is good, but not on silver
---
What?
---
You do realise that he is the only anti projectile operator on defense who's counters are only Thatcher and Capit√£o. His kit, as a whole, is solid. Doesn't mean his gadget isn't the choice. In PL, people ban J√§ger and go all out projectile, as in Finka, buck, ying, zofia and Hibana on attack. That is how important J√§ger's ads is.
---
You got it! You get a brownie point...although, you can totally see the Colonel 100 teleport hacking out of spawn to kill the attackers instantly with the knife.
---
Agreed. Pros are agreeing to that as well.
---
Note that these graphs are plat and diamond. Im not anywhere near them myself, but they know the importance of projectiles. Even if u are right, we still need some kind of jager 2.0
---
Pro league wise its utility&gt;gun. You dont want to give some of the best players in the game free will to chuck cooked nades and instant kill you
---
Clearly I should go for Alibi, which im gonna do. It really itches to play with her when I see shroud or someone playing her :) and if Gridlock isnt that fun then the choice is made easily
---
Echo main here, it‚Äôs all true

Spam or not, Alpha Pack results are still against the rules.

Why does it look like Mute's trying hand Ela some drugs? Maybe it's finally the buff she wants?

Now now there‚Äôs no reason to call OP a nimrod

With the change he wouldn‚Äôt have hit on that distance also, maybe too soon

The goal is to get as many legendary skins as possible. Now, had I gotten a duplicate legendary, I‚Äôd be whining, screaming, and punching people. ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
So what we're saying is, three Mutes when on attack with 3 MP5s...seems legit.
---
Map awareness and knowledge is necessary in this game. Varsitygaming has done alot of maps in a series he calls siege school and thats if you want to invest the time to watch them because theyre lengthy.
---
Sometimes the best way to learn is experience, but equally terrorist hunt is a good way to get to grips with maps without too much interference
---
Fookin laser sights!

I mean it was a suggestion, and its on ubi to see if the system works or not, If it dosent they should not implement the same. But I still think 14-15 map pool is way too many for a competitive game.

I don‚Äôt think you can do it anymore
---
No one is saying that you should play Casual like you‚Äôre not supposed to win. We‚Äôre saying that you shouldn‚Äôt play Casual like it‚Äôs Ranked, because people who are playing Casual are not going to give their 100%, and they shouldn‚Äôt have to.
---
Buy a new processor
---
Yeah thats why i want to push this more.
---
Sure I have. Towerfall Ascensions is our absolute favorite. üòç But we when we all give our absolute best and everybody "tryhards" for the win, we have the most fun together. And while trying hard, we still are just casually playing and having fun together. So I don't understand how this trying hard should take the fun or "casually playing" part away. Maybe it's just personal preferences. ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I want to get him banned. Im not telling you guys to harass him.
---
Hahah ikr... But in recent seasons they have been focusing alot on relations between operators  and they started that shit after intro of ela and zofia and I'm frikkin living it... There is a story and they'll keep doing this kind of easter eggs or teasers to these side stories, would love to see more... Also they made that dokkaebi thatcher cinematic so they'll definitely do something about this aswell.
---
Wholeheartedly agree. Alpha packs are in need of a major rework.
---
The defense of them being free is a moot point when most of the time you end up getting garbage instead of something actually good (which is super rare).
---
Yeah, even though it's not 100% accurate I found it quite enjoyable
---
Im so sorry the shit internet i have spammed the post
---
*Notre Flame
---
No. for everything recruit. Including recruit himself.
---
Wouldn't make sense right now since the second half of the season is already in play. Introducing "new" operators only works at the beginning and middle of the season when every team still has to play against each other at least once.
---
I got that skin. Looks very nice imo. Grats!
---
Go all the way to the left to the playstation store then scroll all the way down to redeem codes. Also I think you can do it in game in the shop.
---
It shouldn't really go through anymore but since the aoe is so big, a shot behind it is already good.
---
LMAO some stores just can't leave a chance to rip off a game,toy,tv show it's hilarious.

Hello OxyRiggs, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bdsd0k/frostmat_revive_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I'd say ela you can kill anything in your way a monty gets in your way save one of your cotton candy shits and throw it at him and clap his cheeks
---
I mean his gun has no recoil his gadget extremely useful, hes strong overall. Maybe give a bit more recoil to his gun but besides that hes very good
---
He means Frost is very rare in high levels, so the small data pool can make her win delta jump like hell.
---
Jesus...christ
---
Omg don't
---
All you need to do is weigh elo for each round. A win in a 5vs3 isn't worth as much as a win in 5vs5. If you are the winner add up all the rounds you won to get your elo for the match. And if you lose add up all the loosing rounds. That way if it's a 3vs5 and you lose it doesn't hurt elo much
---
bruh
---
I would love to see elite recruit skin
---
Both very viable. With Ela I‚Äôll roam off usually and plant at least one grzmot near the obj. I keep the others with me for encounters!
---
If I‚Äôm sitting somewhere and I hear something I can always chuck a mine to see if anyone is there and then head in for the kill if it sets off.
---
But not the game

It's simple. Ranked is a joke.. You lose the same amount of mmr as if you lost. You get literally 15 minutes? 15? This has to start from an hour and every game, you leave after that should increase 3x. It can reset every month or 30games. Until, people stop treating ranked as a "level up game in a certain period of time" with this hard reset BS where it puts a motivated bronze to play vs diamonds even for a week is gonna make your blood boil, depending on the personality of course.
---
Sry can't help you then, good luck
---
Yea ofc, just throw out the entire sound engine, make a new one in 2 weeks, pray to god it is bug free and release it.
---
Blitz?
---
I think i like to make an addition to that concept. How about the least picked "random" map becomes the most weighted in terms of votes, giving them a chance to be pick if not all players participate in voting the other two maps. Let the least picked map start out with 4 votes or the alternative, if picked, multiply the vote by 2 or so.
---
I had a 1v4 just like this. It‚Äôs funny to see them become so greedy.

i dont really care if a teammate shoots a guy im shooting but it really bothers me when someone kills a person i have knocked.
---
That doesn't stop people from going double shield or Zofia + Ash.
---
I'm not saying it's a viable tactic, just that it's going to happen regardless. The only reason his pick rate is do high is because he's the only operator that can take out grenades. A purpose that is *extremely* useful.
---
At this point if they can‚Äôt fix it once and for all, I believe the overall volume of all foot steps for every operator, even crouch walking, needs to be turned up a few knotches.
---

WHERE YOU AT
---
Just on Steam alone at least 115k people playing on a daily basis . I would gladly take a bit of a queue increase to play a map that I like. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt think certain features that work great on other games won‚Äôt work in Siege. It‚Äôs almost to an irrational level.
---
So I‚Äôm looking through my posts and I don‚Äôt get what ur problem is? 
---
Acogs are massive in siege and I cross posted this here for humour reasons (imagine someone doing this while playing jager) 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a massive stretch and I think u need to take that stick out of ur ass
---
They said for him to hold ANGLES and to have more of that sniping role compared to being an entry fragger. 
---
You have no clue what you are talking about.
---
"Old Glaz was perfectly fine".
---
No. In no way was Glaz being able to one shot people through smoke fair and balanced, Pro League teams would run Ash and Glaz, at the time, spam smoke nades and got easy frags.
---
Because a fully automatic 3 or 4 shot kill is always better than a semi automatic 2 shot kill
---
What does giving defenders ARs have to do with anything we are talking about?
---
This is true. LMG use is uncommon enough that people will subconsciously run out or peek again when they think you're reloading after ~30 bullets.
---
This is plastic 9
---
no takesies backsies!
---
Oh.  I understand that.
---
Don't you think having old Glaz back would be cool?  That would be awesome.
---
Yeah, back then he wasn't used much.  I haven't actually played at that time but I've seen gameplay.  That seems awesome.
---
Just one shotting people left and right with a sniper seems fun.
---
We've gotten more maps since then, so it would work.  Like, old Glaz would probably dominate on Villa and Fortress because of how large they are.  Old Glaz could also work on Oregon, obviously plane, border, chalet, bank, Kafe, consulate, maybe Favela, definitely coastline, and clubhouse.
---
Old Glaz would be more situational, and that's fine.  Operators don't have to be good on every map 100% of the time.  It's the reason why I like Castle.  Castle is a niche operator that's only good in certain maps and sites.  That's perfectly fine.  It encourages teamwork and coordination because one op won't be good on every single map, every single site, etc.
---
I feel like that also closer to the original intention of the game, which is a team-oriented FPS.  Since old glaz is more situational, he would require a lot more teamwork to be played effectively, also it would just be more fun to play in general but that's just me, I guess...
---
But the fact that it fired so slow was also an issue. If you miss that shot you are most likely going to get killed
---
bruh I cant even find that is it even out
---
Well, ARs kill faster than SMGs, so since ARs are better, they should all get ARs.
---
Just cuz ARs are better doesn't mean everyone should have one
---
I see the problem
---
Ugh I love kAnal
---
&gt;No. In no way was Glaz being able to one shot people through smoke fair and balanced, Pro League teams would run Ash and Glaz, at the time, spam smoke nades and got easy frags.
---
You...you do realize there was a point in time where Glaz could one shot without a thermal, right?
---
he didn't always have a thermal.  And yes they did say that.
---
&gt;They said for him to hold ANGLES and to have more of that sniping role compared to being an entry fragger.
---
Ok then.  They want him to  be played more like a sniper than an entry fragger.  What does that tell you?  
---
&gt;You have no clue what you are talking about.
---
Nope, you have no idea what you're talking about, not me.
---
You're bringing up one shot kill glaz with a thermal, which I understand was a thing at one point, but I'm talking about pre-thermal glaz.  One shot kill glaz before he got the thermal.  That's...what I'm talking about
---
They implemented matchmaking in Casual *because* everyone was getting stomped by Diamonds and Plats.  They weren't rare at all, you got matched up with them all the time.
---
J√§ger isn't getting nerfed, they really can't do anything to him.
---
Definitely, but that's just how snipers are.
---
High recoil high damage low firerate.  That could potentially work in Siege.  Maybe increase his swap time so he can pull out his PMM faster.
---
But, this would promote patience and better aim.  Sure, Glaz requires an incredible amount of skill already, or, at least in my eyes he does, but this would make him require even more skill to use.
---
Plus, this would make him more situational, which is perfectly fine.  Look at Castle.  Castle is probably the single most situational operator in the game.  Super powerful on certain sites, while weak on others.
---
Basically old Glaz.
---
Thx I agree
---
ARs do more damage but have more recoil and a slower fire rate. SMGs do less damage but fire faster and have less recoil. This, combined with one shot headshots, keeps the two weapon types balanced. 
---
This still has nothing to do with your original argument.
---
Disabling electronics!
---
My friend was playing Blitz last night and a smoke using the SMG-11 somehow shot half his mag **through** the screen on the shield and headshot him
---
Need banana for scale
---
Have you ever been to Britain
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSRvzuDsozI
---
No actually the reasoning was so he could fit the sniper role a bit more, and like you said, so he can't rush into smoke and just kill people.
---
They said it themselves, you can watch the video if you want.
---
No she‚Äôs op enough
---
The shields completely bisect the operator and it‚Äôs been happening all season, I thought surely they‚Äôd have this sorted by now
---
The amount of times I've seen teams lose like this you'd think players would start to learn
---
That looks sick
---
I don‚Äôt have anything to take out of my ass. Humor or not, but the **picture itself** doesn‚Äôt contain anything directly related to Siege, R6 or even ‚ÄúTom Clancy‚Äôs‚Äù games in general.  Another user already told you that it breaks rule #1, and I don‚Äôt have anything to add here.
---
He's already very strong
---
No just no.  Also Ela won't get a elite for a long time since ubisoft hates her.
---
he didnt do sicko mode but his LMG did
---
What‚Äôs your play style?
---
*absorb bullets
---
The girl in the striped pajamas
---
His pick and win rate reflect that he's not broken.
---
I like that he reminded you to use c4 but only said it 3 times as to only remind you that it was an option, not telling you that you HAVE to do it.
---
"He would have to reload by now"
---
Nope
---
Exactly.

Nice play. Is Mira you're main?

His ban rate during SI reflect that 70% of people think he is

That's a drone for us

The amount of complaints about him reflect that nobody likes playing against him.

yea. carrying a heavy backpack on the back is way easier than steadily holding it out in front of you

How is it I'm the snowflake when ur the ones getting mad over a word on the internet.
---
Add some c4 to the mix and kaboom bye bye Blitz
---
Remember that this is a statistic only from Diamond and high Plat and only on PC
---
Maestro is by far the best of those three.
---
Did you check that box that says "I agree to the Terms of use?"
---
Did you read them?
---
Welp guess what they can and will perma ban you, though I don't think they would perma ban you after 1 instance of it, so that makes me believe that you are just generally toxic and this is a accumulation of all the punishments you have gotten.
---
And here is the update they released, so this is likely your 4-5th offense: [https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-321200-16/dev-blog-toxicity](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-321200-16/dev-blog-toxicity)
---
On your next account try not being so toxic.
---
I see where you coming from, but those charts are from PC plats and diamonds. In lower ranks and especially on console, his pick rate is higher and is not as easily taken down due to bad aim from the lower ranked/console players.
---
I'd say maestro but that's cause I like his play style and his weapons
---
Mozzie
---
This kids is why you don't rush all together
---
Everyone
---
Alright found out how to fix it

Oh here comes the wiseguy. They didn't perma ban me after 1 instance of it yes, however, the rest weren't even about the n-word.
---
#DID YOU GET THE SECOND ONE

Yeah I like that idea my brother said something similar this morning

What is that a map for ants?!

I play more of the support/fragger roles. (Hibana,  Finka, J√§ger, etc) I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of camera-heavy ops but I‚Äôll adapt if it can get me the win tho.

Y'all just suck at the game. Get good or at least stop complaining

Which means they're worse at dealing with him, not that the char is broken.

Lol, yes you are offended, and yes you are racist. You're an offended racist. Feel free to pay up if you wanna play again, ubisoft would love your money.

Are you making the argument that because maestro is a useful late round op that his gun doesn't need nerfed? Being useful has never stopped a ranked player from peeking, especially if you have a really strong gun.

Find friends to play with. You can friend people who are good that you get matched with, or use a hub like r/R6STeams

There should already be one. I keep mine at 60ü§î
---
the real question is why tf was he thermiting that wall when the door was right there
---
If they were to throw a flash at their feet and you were blinded completely, this is the distance you aim for the head. Any other time, aim right below it and let recoil work its thing.

---
it's viable but it's boring as all hell and the layout makes it kinda difficult to learn
---
There are in fact some objectives where there's a start that you just have to know (like oregon downstairs) but other that that you just have to avoid spots where a window is behind you or someone can shoot you from behind. Also look out that if the mira mirror gets opened not the whole objective is open.
---
Mozzie stop loading your blanks and put your real shotgun shells inside
---
Yeah, and lost all its uniqueness and charm.
---
Too many new clusterfuck rooms, everything looks the same, top floor is empty and looks unfinished.

The only thing it needed was a second way to get from ground floor to first floor.
---
Looks dumb imo but you do you my dude

When the countdown is going down, freeze in place. You can look, aim, throw, use items, anything you want. Just don‚Äôt take a step while the drone is buzzing. It might take some practice, but I you‚Äôll get it. As long as you don‚Äôt step, you won‚Äôt be flagged

I play on console and can't control any recoil but somehow i never had trouble with mira
---
I mean walking around. Yes I do realize you can defend yourself but you can't move without being detected
---
It's... Even worse now. I turned up the volume of my music and played like 5 times better, because the sounds were actually putting me at a disadvantage
---
That drawing is amazing!
---
It allows you to crouch behind the desk and hold a tighter spot when planting.
---
&gt;&gt;Getting in a spot and sniping into the building.
---
You can already do that with Glaz, adding another sniper op won't add more outside angles
---
&gt;&gt;Third of all, go fuck yourself, seriously.  You can't even quickscope in CoD anymore cuz snipers are only a one shot in the head and neck now.
---
I wouldn't know, I don't play CoD anymore. Go play an older CoD then
---
&gt;&gt;They nerfed them so bad, snipers are shit in CoD now.  Don't you say shit to me unless you know what you're talking about.

I'm gonna be honest, I don't give a fuck
---
&gt;&gt;You're acting like snipers don't belong in Siege when they do, and even Ubisoft wants them in the game.
---
yeah, no they don't
---
Waiting for the season 3 operators, finally Latin American operators Peruvian and Mexican!!
---
I'm not believing a thing until I see an image. I know this dude was right before but last time there was visual proof too.
---
The layout is not that different to old Hereford with a corridor inserted in between.
---
I'v been playing a lot of Tactical realism lately and your reloads give me anxiety.
---
Why move to the side of the Mira window, when the Mira window can move for you?
---
Reposti
---
Whenever this suggestion comes up, I struggle to understand what purpose it would serve. Casual will never provide useful data to determine whether a map is balanced for ranked play. The fact that so many players don't care enough about winning in casual to put forth their best effort which leads to impossible matchmaking means that win rates from casual won't tell you whether a map should be put into ranked.
---
Since I'm pretty certain every map released will wind up in ranked, delaying to include it in the map pool doesn't really provide any functionality that doesn't currently exist today.  Nothing forces players to jump into ranked on day one; players are welcome to hop into casual, discovery casual, terrorist hunt, and custom matches when the season first starts if they are uncomfortable with the new map.  This way, players who played the map on the TTS or who are simply okay with getting an unfamiliar map in ranked aren't stuck waiting for an arbitrary amount of time to get the map in ranked.
---
Usually I would say ‚Äúonly on Xbox‚Äù but that one was clean. Updoot, well played.
---
My game keeps crashing after this update
---
Haha yea I love the colour grey and maverick so I found this skin awesome. But I don't use the AR
---
I hope they take out hereford, fortress, and all the other overly large and complicated maps. It‚Äôs almost impossible to find roamers on this maps, encouraging a lot of obnoxious roaming.
---
hey buddy im pretty sure this is a repost of someone else's content, either create your own or give credit. Plus, I know it is because its an old drawing before thatcher had his elite but he does now. Don't steal content.
---
communication is key in this game, it‚Äôs still a great deal of fun without a mic but if you wanna do as good as you possibly can a mic is pretty much required
---
Everything looks the same? Have you forgotten what OG Hereford looked like? Every single room was a rearrangement of dummies and ammo boxes! At least the new has unique rooms.
---
Flair checks out.
---
This is why you check your corners
---
Don‚Äôt post potato please and thank you
---
Yeah

The pins and coins are from the Koyo store

Good job. Keep it up!
---
Most of the DLC operators arent even that good though, the vast majority are worse than the base 20, and only a handful were meta warping. And those meta warpers still arent as good as Jaeger or Doc for defenders or Ash, Twitch or Thermite for attackers in 99% of situations.
---
People whine about the rush meta and DLC ops, and ubi makes changes around this, rather than looking at how things are actually going in actual real competitive play
---
It‚Äôs a short time being tied down. I usually just crouch or drop to prone and wait the few seconds. I roam mainly as a defender and I can‚Äôt think of the last time a Lion scan worried me. It might not be a hard counter but every single defender can soft counter it. 
---
If he was ever overpowered it was the first day he was released, until everyone figured they could freeze in place and miss the scan.
---
Online ?
---
Good i dont use the mic and i didtn have any problem
---
My aim has gotten better luckily
---
That monty knows what's up, looks like a great player!
---
It's horrible.
---
You need to make callouts so a mic is crucial
---
Looks like it came from ghost recon wildlands tbh I want this for playing grw instead of the kingslayer skin for jackal
---
Jesus.  Never jump the shield when enemy is nearby.
---
Still caviera wont even use her reinforcements in many matches, just my experience making caviera players toxic as hell and die by spawn peeks using the worst gun in the game.
---
I mind if u type wrong English
---
There's the tryharding that's just playing to the best of your ability, but then there are the people who are actually deserving of the title.
---
The people deserving of the title are the ones who only play 3-speeds on Attack and 1-speeds on Defense, the ones who crouch and lean spam to the best of their ability, the ones who treat every game like it's for thousands of dollars.  Those are the ones people hate, because they're just not fun to play against.
---
Nah. All they did is running out with 416 carbine and died by an ash main.
---
The person was saying that Twitch didn't *give* Mozzie the shock drone, she just got countered. That's how the game works. He didn't say that Twitch is on defense, that would be ridiculous. Teamkilling Twitch because Mozzie hacks her drone is like teamkilling Bandit because you threw your own gadget in some shock wire. I hope you're better than that.
---
You'll never know unless you try
---
Lol

Watch the first clip from pengu. He shows you some tips but also an application you can load to have better aim!
---
Oh no more horny 13 years old
---
I could try and find a way to balance a sniper.  Like, I'll just choose an MSR for this example.  Maybe:
---
MSR
---
Damage- 135
---
Ammo- 5 per clip, 45 in reserve
---
Attachments- Flash Hider, Scope(2.5x Zoom, same as ACOG) 
---
Secondaries- pretty much any semi-auto mag-fed handgun
---
Gadget- FMJ rounds(10 total) Able to shoot through reinforced walls, Black Mirrors, or Deployable shields for 60% reduced damage(54 damage through a reinforcement or black mirror)
---
Secondary Gadgets- Maybe, hmmm, maybe a claymore for flank protection and then....smokes?
---
Like, that's an example of something that could be implemented.  You have your sniper, with your handgun, and your gadget and secondary gadget, without being overpowered.
---
Yeah I always thought that was a strange nerf for her. But it just made her ‚Äúharder‚Äù to roam with without realizing the problem was 3 speed no recoil. Just strange for a roamer to not have access to it.
---
Thank you!

Oh no
---
It‚Äôs very frustrating when you first start learning the game and feels unfair, but the more you play, you‚Äôll realize that it‚Äôs actually in the attackers favor and is only really effective against new players. Learning where people spawn peak/run out, usually ends up in you getting the kill instead of the other way around, as for each spawn there‚Äôs usually only 1-2 spots to watch, whereas the attackers can go to multiple positions to counter that 1-2 spots they can peek/run out.

Yeah and you can‚Äôt even play the top floor on secure which is the best part of the map IMO
---
Shield operators have suppression; when their shields receive shots, accuracy is reduced.
---
IQ buff?: 
---
Give her the ability to ping electronics for allies. Only one ping can be active at a time. It would give teammates an outline/x-ray of the item you've pinged and it stays like this until destroyed/removed or something else gets pinged. Would give her a bit more importance for the whole team, for example ping a kapkan trap so your team doesn't run straight into it. Idk, you could probably work out the details and make it balanced, I just feel placing a mark isn't enough of a warning for your team..
---
Release Ela on defense and release BB on attack
---
Yeah, sorry for being toxic lol. It is the way you turn slowly and in unsmooth movements.

You actually seem to have no clue about it. You can‚Äôt just fix DDoSing it has nothing to do with Ubisoft in that case. It‚Äôs like saying: ‚ÄúI lost because someone disconnected my internet. Sure as hell has to be Ubisoft.‚Äù In case of DDoSing Ubisoft can‚Äôt do anything about it.

Maybe she shoots her pistol a couple times and then blows on it?

This is gold
---
Headshots are most of my kills so i got this
---
Round starting spawnpeeks may favor attacks due to their predictability, but runouts later in the round strongly favor the defender.  They can pre-aim for the attacker's likely location (or known location) while the attacker usually is holding a different angle, is often repelling (i.e. at a mobility disadvantage), and probably considers himself safe from that side (since there is no LOS to a window/door).
---
fuckin xbox lmao
---
2 things that throw me off about that. First I understand that you have to be more aware that it can happen so i get what you're saying about the drone usage and placement, but again even if you scope out the runout, they have 3 seconds of unseen sprinting for the round start. Also it assuming you have a dead teammate to watch your drone midround to call out the runout spot. ( Which IMO is about the same thing as having a no timer and instantly showing the runout via the game). And Secondly, "Unless it‚Äôs a spawn peek that can kill you before you could move", again just my personal opinion this should never even be  said or thought about in a game like siege.
---
If you have a huge issue with it play glaz Blackbeard or Monte they all have ways of directly countering spawnpeeks
---
I‚Äôll investigate that

These "reworks" seem a lot more like what they called a "buff" when they did it to clubhouse, i.e. adding a room or a staircase or whatever. They showed a little bit of what they were planning at the reveal
---
Lol you‚Äôre funny, look at the things you say to people with pretty much no reason. Shows your character truthfully, the fact that you can‚Äôt see it shows it even more

seeing all the holes on the stairs makes me want random ricochet  damage to both sides.

As someone who played exclusively PS4 until about season 3, took an extended break, bought a PC and picked up in December, I think you are overselling PC. NO ONE. And I mean NO ONE is there to help. They may be nicer (they generally are) but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone that doesn't get frustrated with poor play or having little knowledge of what to do. With that being said, if you DO make the move to PC - you should let ALL frustration from PS4 go. I take an entirely different mindset in games now. I just try to do whatever I can to help my team win the round. It took me about 2 ranked games to realize I was going to get crapped on fairly often (being new to PC). I've worked up to high gold last season and Plat 3 this season. And thats mostly (bar recently) solo queueing. You do get better team play but it doesn't come without its own toxicity. I'm not trying to shit on anyone or either community, but the toxicity isn't exclusive to console - just reset the mind, join the pcmasterrace, and enjoy a much more fulfilling Siege. I'll never go back to console lol.
---
I‚Äôm so good I bought a 100 dollar adapter to get a advantage on these noobs

It would be free kills for PC players so I‚Äôm all for it

Dude why do you enter the thread if you think that? I'd like to have even Y5 revealed entirely. The hype is there still. You know what the ops do, you are hyped to play them

Even the way he did it wasn't terrible. Mira ran out of her ammo and was bound to reload, only other option was that shotgun which is very bad at killing. A prefire with decent aim would've shut Mira down at the end there.
---
i‚Äôd buy one but I don‚Äôt play xbox :/

I was definitely triggered when I heard about the changes so thank you for this logical solution

I mean I already play mnk players all day soo

If you are fine with not getting frags and you are good at callouts and FOR THE LOVE OF JESUS DONT JUMP AROUND A DOORWAY LIKE YOU ARE A RABBIT ON COCAINE.... Then clash is a good pick. Maverick is good and has NO counters so there's that. He has good guns too.
---
LMAO

It means windows is passing the input from the mouse to the game directly instead of it going through windows mouse scaling or acceleration first.

Yup mines worth nothing. So does it matter?

Of course!

Night mode usually evens sounds out, making loud noises quieter and the quiet ones easier to hear. Probably alters the levels across different frequencies too, idk though.
---
Haven't seen the video but I would guess the combination of reducing the louder sounds that normally mask others while boosting the subtler sounds makes them easier to pick up.
---
I should probably check the video myself at some point to check though

A bit too edgy but well done nonetheless
---
I'm perfectly fine with using casual data to evaluate a map.  Alternately, you could alter the discovery playlist to use ranked rules (giving you a closer approximation).  Neither option is ideal, but both are better than forcing a bad map into the ranked pool (particularly since even obviously unfit maps, like Tower, take multiple seasons to be removed from the ranked pool) just so you can find out that it's bad.
---
FWIW I think the community has gotten it more or less correct.  Tower was a proof of concept that didn't work.  Theme Park has some big, but correctable faults (imo it's the closest to being PL ready of the non-PL maps).  Villa is a good solid PL map.  Hereford is decently balanced, but no fun to play.  Fortress is much the same.  I'm not a fan of Outback (too hard to keep cleared, too many exterior peeks) but the general feedback is pretty positive.  Really only Tower, New Hereford and Fortress were universally (and imo correctly) panned.
---
it's

*inhale*

PEEK
---
&gt; N√∂kk looks extremely cute

Enough to get me hyped af
---
Yeah? There is a hatch there, but it goes down to the floor below.
---
???
---
I want team play in TH and communicate with others. Instead of that I always get afk players farm reown. That very sad and angry.
---
I was thinking something like that. New Hereford is very good for pro league and Hereford base is good for casual!
---
Why did you blur the version and fps? xD
---
I see that hatch, I meant a hatch above. It looks like Twitch drops from the roof
---
*blocked in China*
---
Well it has a low win rate because it has a low pick rate. Which means every loss has more of an effect. Plus I think the stats for that was based off of competitive which means even fewer picks
---
I know. I'm agreeing with you, there is a hatch that goes to the floor below, but not one above.
---
Now you need to make smonk and put him nesxt to the conk
---
Mainly because the amount of nerfs she got
---
Not leaked, it just got confirmed on Twitter!
---
So I might be biased, but it's simply an amazing game. Gave me something I had not experienced in a long time on console, I don't think any game comes close on console. 
---
This game is going nowhere, player numbers have been rising over the last year and will certainly remain steady for a long, long time before you have to worry about being able to find matches. Currently is very fast even in the top ranks. So no worries about that. 
---
Jump in! The curve is steep but if you enjoyed the weekend trials I'm sure you know what you are getting into!
---
Good mounty... Now attack!!!
---
After watching it again, it looks like she was sprinting and then started crouching right as OP turned around
---
I preferred old Hereford simply because the layout seemed logical for the space it was supposed to represent (a house). New Hereford is better for balance but it doesn't flow like a logical building to me.
---
Can't wait for that N√∂kk rule34
---
Back in para belum when I started siege and somehow was able solo que to gold 4 I was opaired with a 4 man team that TK‚Äôed  me ever round, it truly is a nice experience
---
I always hate being the last person alive on my team it puts so much pressure on me especially at match point
---
This is why i make sure to kill my self at the beginning of every round so i don't have to deal with the pressure
---
Ah thankyou for correction
---
I'm gonna give it few days to decide but right now I'm leaning pretty hard to jumping in
---
Oh okay, see, I'm impatient, and just want to play, so I guess I have to wait lol. Thanks for your help,!
---
I haven't said it is bad I just don't think it is the super weapon and that bandit has the better equipment that's all so pls what's ur problem.
---
No, but it‚Äôs a room modeled after one in a tragic attack, ofc it makes you feel sad. It‚Äôs like looking at a twin towers replica.
---
I love it! :) have you done any of twitch?
---
But tragedy + time...
---
I've gotten severely damaged when fuze hit the room next to mine
---
on PC. Consoles tomorrow.
---
Personally, I use the m4 with acog and flash user but also works well with holo and angled
---
If anything the fact that the data is taken from platinum ranked matches proves my point, even the most skilled players usually don‚Äôt do well with clash
---
I mean I agree and he capitalized on their mistakes but still they blew that situation hard
---
Would this include player worn electronics like for vigil? Cause that would be a nightmare if it was just stayed on until they changed it.
---
what‚Äôre you on about?
---
I can only say 2 operators
---
Echo
---
Echo is the only operator that has a drone that cloakes itself with the ability to move around. He is also helpful on bomb as if they plant the defuser echo can use sonic burst from the yokai drone 
---
He is also immune to dokkaebis logic bomb 
---
( only echo can use sonic burst can move the drone around )
---
Maestro 
---
The evil eye is similar to the ADS from jager in placement( floor or wall as high you can reach with it being difficult to spot while using the laser built in
---
Twitch,Habana,Sledge,Thatcher,Thermite can counter the Evil Eye. Only Maestro can rotate the turret and open the visor for the laser
---
Both can harass but maestro can do damage ( 5 per hit for 20 shots ) echo can harass as its similar to ela and zofia concussion grenades. Zofia can recover on half the time as everyone else.
---
Pros
---
Drone can be moved by you
---
Sonic burst can disrupt diffuser planting
---
Reconissance 
---
Cons
---
Thatcher,Any Operator can see a yokai is it is uncloaked our the cloak in general,Twitch,IQ, any explosive nearby
---
Maestro
---
Does damage
---
Harass the defuser ( will not cancel like Yokai )
---
Bulletproof until visor is open 
---
You can ping with it ( not with echo imo just like valkyrie) 
---
Cons sledge,thatcher,twitch,ash,zofia,any explosive
---
( I recommend using both with another person and coordinate)
---
The M4 is the more viable weapon in my opinion, but the AR is way more fun to play with. The M4 carries a better DPS and doesn't need the pinpoint mechanical aim required to be effective with the AR. That said, the sound of the AR is epic with or without the suppressor and it feels a lot more satisfying to use in my opinion.
---
Max Goose. Let that sink in.
---
It's out, just restart.
---
Console updates are expensive, probably have PC go first incase something goes so tits up they have to instantly patch again or delay the console updates.
---
Ah okay thanks mate, it was showing the card but I couldn‚Äôt find it
---
They mentioned during the Six Invitational 3 that they are doing away with the terms Map buff versus map rework. 
---
Even though Ubi themselves won't be using these terms anymore I do think that the Kafe change is more of a map buff and that for example the Kanal change looks like a proper rework. 
---
So to answer your question, there was quite a clear difference between the 2, a map buff alters certain areas and a rework was basically an entire new map. Maybe by removing the 2 terms the 2 will become more similar, where map buffs are more extreme (like kafe) and reworks have more of the old map (possibly kanal)
---
Kaid's shotgun can 2 hit kill most operators in the game, and has the same headshot potential as bandits MP7. If you cant click on a persons head, or spam around their waist, then you are bad.
---

---
I‚Äôve owned a pc for about a week and a half now. I have 25-30 hours on rainbow and I‚Äôve yet to see a single hacker. If you‚Äôre seeing stuff on YouTube or other sites about hackers on rainbow they‚Äôre probably very outdated
---

Maverick is available. Cav maybe later today or tomorrow
---
Fuze
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering lol for sure getting Cav if it‚Äôs renown
---
I wouldn't just play siege, I mean jsut look apex legends atm
---
their biggest issue was not taking out the camera honestly
---
same
---
And by all together you mean Blitz and Ash who stepped on a Gu mine, with e others laggy way behind
---
Yeah, I've been trying to Branch out but I learned how to play this game by playing mira and thermite
---
Ahahaha every time.
---
Ignoring the fact that the AR50 is the ugliest gun in the game. I'm still upset about that.
---
That's the point? He's powerful and disruptive. He should have many counters.
---
Oh yeah! In my country there's a thing called "N√§kki" that apparently kidnaps children who go to swim without an adult. Maybe it has something to do with that?
---
Though the kanal pics they showed look like they're building it from scratch.
---
Sunday I could play fine,  now the game lags a lot :( PC athlon x4 and r7 260x :/
---
No; just a coincidence. I think this tactic is something a ton of people can get a knack out of.
---
fucking nae naed
---
OP even had his phone rung by Dokkaebi and Blitz just ran past him.
---
I‚Äôve played a fair bit of apex as well and haven‚Äôt ran into anyone obviously hacking. Tbh I think that most of the hackusatuions in that game are bs. The only game I‚Äôve had any trouble with it in is csgo, where about 1/5 games is everyone playing clean

The cosmetics in general are *so* bad compared to similar games. Look at CSGO or Apex(which has been out for like 2 months) and it's embarassing. Branch out to stuff like Overwatch or Dota and you gotta wonder how it's been this way for so long.
---
No. Ace means killing the whole team. Look it up.

Reminds me of ghost from mw2

Even though it's just the same frame shifted over a touch, can definitely feel the tone of Doc's face changes in the bottom panel. In the top it's celebratory, in the bottom it still is but he's clearly showing off to Lion and kinda digging the knife in a bit.

Np. If they‚Äôre going to make it even half realistic sound is important.

I've always joked that having operators with basic tools as gadgets would be funny. Like a defender who's gadget is putting up blinds on windows that he and open and close instead of just having the regular barricade.
---
Have you tried verifyng the game data?
---
It's almost like spoilers are entirely optional.

If in the right hands it is a destroyer of teams

Naw they just have a better gaming chair than you

To much vodka yesterday
---
First of all please don't bring the Year 1 card out, I've been here since 2015 and ain't trying to use it as a "proof" of my knowledge either.
---
But to get to the business. Yes, his gadget is very special but I need you to understand that this doesn't mean he can't be balanced out. Now the problem with J√§ger is that his pickrate is very high. His winrate is quite balanced, but his pickrate is over the top. This should be clear to everyone. 
---
But like... to start this off I really don't even see what your argument is here. J√§ger... can't be balanced because he is "just a super useful operator overall"...? I fail to see how this makes any logical sense. An neither does an operator being special make him/her impossible to balance. Valkyrie had an insane pickrate when she was introduced, since her gadget was like no one else's (being the first ever camera on defense). Ubisoft deployed a nerf by removing one of her cameras and now she's balanced.
---
What if Ubisoft made J√§ger a 2 speed operator and nerfed his 416-C. This would surely drag his pickrate down by a far. Now he would still be used as an anchor and as grenade denial, but his roamer role would not be as effective. Now when roaming people would rotate to Vigil or Alibi for example rather than J√§ger. J√§ger is not like Mira, not everyone uses him because of his gadget. He is also used because he is fast and has a great weapon. In fact his winrate quite proves that his gadget is not overpowered at all, but in fact quite balanced. Even like you mentioned, the thing that makes J√§ger so powerful is that he is good in so many things, \*super useful\* even. And this means that he is even easier to balance out.

Wait how
---
not bad dude
---
Nothing was more fun than co-op in those two games. Severely underrated series, if bulletstorm can get a remaster I see no reason Army of Two can‚Äôt.
---
Oregen trail

Blackbeard but he‚Äôs a fuking autobot

I really like that

Read it as Maveira and Caverick

‚ÄúWith the real shit!‚Äù My favorite part
---
I was that doc, I got killed it's a spectator cam üòÖ
---
Wtf, he ran right past you but managed to pull off the pistol one-tap. I don't understand this game
---
Hahaha look those toxics good ace mate
---
All protests arrived.
---
All pulse (?)
---
Actually if he was telling them they have to do it then he would say Ubisoft has to or Ubisoft needs to make it
---
I would love that
---
Certain mouse's have an option to increase or decrease the dpi of the mouse.
---
Ara ara cute?
---
u.u
---
Oh i use the default mouse what came whit my laptop dndjsb
---
i think this weapon this so big for maverick
---
Skins in Seige are 400% better than Apex. Don‚Äôt even go there
---
Noice,I sadly have only just reached lvl 50

I just hit 200 today, what a weird journey

This is how dick Cheney shot someone

It‚Äôd be cool if elite smoke‚Äôs gas was black but that may be a little pay to win also
---
When the GTA tryhards move on to siege
---
I'd say make the jump if its not a question of finance. Its honestly worlds better in my opinion. I loved this game before and now I find it much harder to play other games again. Completely reignited the game for me.
---
Saying ‚Äúshould‚Äù is like saying the it‚Äôs ‚ÄúUbisoft‚Äôs best course of action‚Äù which it is not
---
Eh
---
Paper 17*
---
Wym
---
Just a kill
---
*cries in console*
---
I have almost done these. But echo was last
---
Whomst?
---
Only real siege players know this is the old looking frost
---
Then you die running over to kill them
---
Same here #xbx1
---
1 speeds on attack with the exception of Monty are bad ideas &amp; they're straight up not fun to play
---
I love fros coz when I‚Äôm on a place with more windows than doorways she helps me fulfill the joy of trapping the place
---
Yeah most do, but I've met a few who say it correctly.
---
got it from my old folder
---
For real. I get theme park so fucking much and I never have fun on it.
---
Are memes forbidden in this sub?
---
Why is variety a higher priority than preference?
---
Same
---
The fact that people love black ice so much only shows how sad the state of the rest of the skins are.  
---
The hemorrhage skins were really cool but they were only for paid event packs.
---
It took me a long time to see what you were talking about, and I‚Äôm impressed you even noticed.
---
Yes
---
Am I the only one who sees Mav's charm as the Lobster Harmonica Otto wanted to win the the claw machine in the pin pals episode?
---
Same, all my friends and I are having the same problem, really starting to piss me off since I‚Äôm 7 elo from plat 3
---
I would say Valk mainly because in my opinion she is good for collecting intelligence on the enemies.
---
Though Lesion is only 20,000 renown and Valk is 15,000 renown.
---
OK, cool comic. WHY IS DOC BLACK?!
---
Click on their heads bro
---
Have u been matched w AwsomeOverload
---
Why is maverick getting that skin and not Jackal? Makes zero sense for a person with a ‚Äòmetal‚Äô based special, when Jackal‚Äôs is literally a hunter; ugh. Give Jackal mains something cool dammit, lol
---
I can‚Äôt leave the game without you seeing me leave.
---
All that for nomad to be the final replay lol
---
Imagine the struggle with the controller...
---
Fucking moron
---
yeah same lol, I clipped out the part where I passed it, and went back and was like wtf.
---
Ha, little did you know you just used up all of your luck for the rest of the year
---
oh ho! then leave the game as much as you'd like.
---
I'm getting SOCOM vibes from this. The good ol' days.
---
These are bad afüëçüèºüò§
---
Yeah my whole lobby is at like 150 ping right now
---
The punch line is the guy's name is a bad callout?
---
Yea there's some gems here and there; the outbreak skins are cool, some of the purchasable stuff like geode for mpx or glory for the fbi weapons but I don't understand why they dont release a white noise onwards version of black ice, or extend black ices to current year operators
---
Y‚Äôknow people complain about cosmetics; I don‚Äôt care it makes them stick out like a sore thumb, makes them easier to see
---
The joke being that the guys name is a bad callout? whoosh me
---
I thought this was a prank because it was right after playing the April 1st mode.
---
Yeeeeeeeet
---
Dude try this with e controller. It‚Äôs literally impossible lol.
---
Try lowering your sens. Look into your FPS you want a stable FPS which would give you more consistent aim. Also look into muscle memory
---
He looks like a GIJoe XD
---
I‚Äôve been dealing with this problem too, but in ranked (got kicked for network error, me and a friend) and before getting into a game (matchmaking error preventing the joining of a game)
---
idk
---
"We have like 50 well trained special police officers who serve as our army and to arrest drunk people on weekends". This is why I love Iceland, lol.
---
Me: points something out
---
You: insults me
---
Me: hey don‚Äôt
---
You: iT‚Äôs A mEMe cHiLl
---
Wtf lol. I‚Äôm trying to keep the recoil down but end up ending the mag in like 2 seconds so I end up looking to the floor as I‚Äôm auto reloading
---
Myself or the buddy I'm trying to play with can't get into games. Even terrorist hunt.
---
Was tryn to see if we have faced off before
---
Good to find a brother out in the wild
---
Me too
---
Have you played today? Cuz he wasn‚Äôt op yesterday but know he‚Äôs garbage
---
Same stuff is happening to me, I‚Äôll have trouble getting into one then when I do we got to round 3 and everyone disconnected.
---
Well fronts welcome mat is based off a bear trap so it would be possible that this would break your leg and chase internal bleeding so an extended bleed out time would be more realistic

Like after a minute or so if no one has killed you you could do something like Zofias withstand
---
*BE GONE THOT*
---
People don't choose the AA12 because it makes sense, my friend. They choose it because its volume of fire is impressively high while keeping pellet-to-damage ratio astoundingly small
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs probably the most reasonable outcome.
---
Agreed
---
Yup I'm also stuck in the silver bronze loophole because of them
---
What attachments do you use?
---
Accurate.
---
*gets stolen by twitch drone*
---
Imagine being the enemy and seeing THAT come at you
---
There have been several recent nerfs that honestly seemed to be pro league oriented yet I rarely see them in ranked as issues. But apparently PL events sell enough to be the center of thought.
---
Douche
---
Same, when I first started playing siege there was something about blitz that reminded me of myself... never could figure it out though.
---

Can confirm.
---
Prefire makes them scared tho
---
Based on rof and mag size you get 1.3 seconds before the mag goes empty. However in the smg11, a still good and popular gun you get .8 seconds of firing with worse recoil and a longer reload. It is something to get used to though
---
Theres so many ways to capture game clips and you used a kodak funsaver

Hello altrium1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/be10si/anyone_else_having_matchmaking_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

No because I like to use people in traps as bait for other attackers

But why

That is Big Facts

I disagree with that completely but alright.

I don‚Äôt know, Siege servers recently suck

i love all your messages :3

They have already released multiple quality bundles for Jackal. It's somewhat silly to think that all camo uniforms should be exclusive to Jackal.
---
That's the people's fault, now they can either go into a safe spawn or watch out for the very obvious door traps/peeks. It's good that you learn this stuff imo.
