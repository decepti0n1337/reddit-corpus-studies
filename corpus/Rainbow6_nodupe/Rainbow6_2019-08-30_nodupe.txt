In ninja words ‚Äú your Trash‚ÄùüòÇ

---
---
Who has ever denied that?
---
Nice job man
---
Everyone says it's not AT ALL but it's a lot easier to wallbounce and hit your shots. I play PC Gears most days and it's not as fun when you get into lobbies of mostly controller. I'd give it a step above using a Scuf.
---
Everyone also has the capability to hack their games too. Would you be okay with that? And the companies literally can‚Äôt do anything more than they already have. They‚Äôve disabled it as a peripheral natively and even if they try to patch a specific mod then it just gets updated and they‚Äôd be in a never ending losing battle. Why can‚Äôt people follow the rules imposed by the devs and not cheat? If you want to play against controller players as a kb&amp;m player you‚Äôre literally just admitting that you‚Äôre trash and need that advantage to even win. And for the record I did git good and bought a PC so I don‚Äôt have to deal with retards that think they‚Äôre good at the game on console cause they cheat. Grow up loser
---
I disagree, you also have the option to use mouse and keyboard. Just because you dont do it, dont take it out on someone that does.
---
Depends on how big the luck factor is though;  
---

---
If I play 10 games, and 7 times out of 10 I land I somehow wind up in an area with only P220s/RE-45s/Mozambiques, not much I can do there for instance other than pray and hide.
---
I now wanna see IQ lay someone out in a gym.
---
His bullets are literally the most destructive bullets in the game. People underwrite tachanka so damn hard. I Main tachanka in plat 2 on pc and while he isnt good on some sites, he is actually ridicilous on others. I could write an extensive guide for this if there is any interest. He isnt Even a bad operator. If he got acog and his face shield on his turret is buffed so that the whole thing doesnt get destroyed by getting hit on the edges, rather destroy the part of the Window he hits he Would be really viable
---
Slow down it‚Äôs a casual lmao
---
There are rules against it moron, mnk is disabled on console. People use EMULATORS to bypass it. Instead of talking about something you know nothing about, do a little research.
---
Just like hackers are a PC problem. Glad we don't deal with that.
---
elite skin nokk?
---
I would use mouse and keyboard if I went against other people in mouse and keyboard
---
Look at buck in the backround

Off topic reply - That controller is fucking sick! Wish I owned one.
---
Ubisoft themselves has said that they do not condone MnK on console and have actually banned people for blatantly doing it. It *is* cheating.
---
Will we win even more of this guy‚Äôs approval if we play with one eye closed?
---
Looks like even the slightest twitch will make your character go 360¬∞
---
Highly doubt thats the skin thats coming with her set...or did i miss something?
---
I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre either a PC player or someone who uses  mnk
---
Fair enough
---
Console is bad PC master race
---
Contact their support. A year ago i went on vacation for a week.  Came back and I started a match and like 2 seconds in I got kicked and it said I got banned for cheating.  Was super confused so I called their support number and they had me make a ban appeal ticket.  Apparently some guy logged into my account from Japan lol.  Not sure if they do it anymore but they said they unban once and then if it happens again they won‚Äôt do anything.
---
Tldr  make a ban appeal or call their support.
---
The fucking arrogance of some people man, how do they get so stupid? I‚Äôm actually jealous, ignorance is bliss.
---
Thank you someone had to say it.
---
Without a doubt. Is it as big of a problem on the other platforms?
---
I see, that‚Äôs fucking hilarious
---
thanks guys i¬¥ll save my lunch money */s* for the 40$ bundle
---
I'm better with controller than keyboard so doing that would put the other team on an advantage
---
Ok mongoloid.
---
Thanks man, hey can u explain the trajectory of the twitch drone taser?? I see that‚Äôs ur main and it doesn‚Äôt make sense when I miss
---
Console controllers are what 40-50$? I can buy a keyboard mouse bundle for 15$ it‚Äôs not about money or not wanting to invest in a hobby.
---
People are paying for 3rd party hardware/software to bypass restrictions and limitations set by the developers in the game.  This is cheating.
---
Pro tip: play on pc
---
Slightly above average.
---
You understand we‚Äôre arguing the same point correct?
---
I like lion ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
LOL This logic is hilarious. Everyone is telling MnK Console players to get a controller to git gud. This same argument can be used on you to get a MnK and learn how to level the playing field. Your beef is with companies allowing MnK in the first place. 
---
This would be like PC players bitching about controllers being an unfair advantage on their platform. Everyone would be telling them to get a controller and get good.
---
I have yet to experience it on xbox, but I have been ddos‚Äòd in destiny comp
---
The sounds all sound more realistically clunky
---
Lucky gun to get it on
---
There needs to be a place to f around, soom you will have untanked if you wish to play seriously but now in ranked
---
Shit my bad. I thought you were OP
---
Since everybody responding badly here's a &lt;3
---
Yes it does
---
All Gucci brother
---

---
If your friends can't climb on their own maybe they shouldn't be playing ranked. Maybe they should focus more on actually learning to play the game better instead of just what their rank is. Because when you're not there to carry them they're just going to get crushed by the people who earned those ranks legitimately.
---
&gt; points for win
---
&gt; points for surviving
---
&gt; points for kills
---
&gt; rewards for win
---
Yep the point is losing for sure.
---
Actually, yes. I hate when people do this. It‚Äôs one thing if you‚Äôre dicking around in single player, or in a closed (private) lobby with friends. But this is the same as using aimbot/mods for me: get over yourself and play the fucking game. Please.
---
Dude, it's gotten so bad now. And it was absolutely rampant in the call of duty alpha. Deal with keyboard and mouse low lifes on console or hackers on PC. Damned if we do damned if we dont.
---
Got plat 1 in 1 season long time ago. Now can't get higher than plat 3
---
Op, this is some seriously good shit
---
Bloody brilliant
---
Lets get this straight. You are arguing that a platform that is A:Cheaper B:Better preforming C:Free Online access D:multifunctional E:open source is some how worst because you can avoid the tiniest of chace with some scrip kiddie? If this isnt mental gymnastics I dont know what is.
---
I will give you that it is harder, not impossible, to hack console. Good job, you earned a point, but PC still beats your console 10 fold.
---
Over 1300 hours on Siege PC most of it ranked, I havent ment a hacker yet, this is low plat high gold level.
---
https://www.mpgh.net/forum/233-console-game-hacking/
---
Not impossible, just very hard
---
[removed]
---
It's not allowed. They have to buy a third party adapter for their PS4 to disguise it as a controller. The only game that I know that  allows kb&amp;m is fortnite.
---
hibana so hot
---
Explain please, how you can roam smarter with jackal on enemy team? Btw Kaid ban is useless. Thermite can simply put his charge on the floor or wall neighboring hatch and it will open. Thwre is also Maverick who can open hatch in 10 sec max.
---
And people are still saying that the rank disparity lock is a bad thing.
---
I should have worded it differently...why go through such lengths to be good at a game if you aren‚Äôt being paid for it? Meaning, why buy a XIM and go through the hassle of setting it up and dealing with any issues that may arise and then deal with all the other problems that might occur, like a ban, when you could just try and get better naturally?
---
Sorry for not wording it better. Been a long day.
---
By your logic , athletes getting doped up to perform better is fine and people should blame their sources. All the other athletes should get doped up as well to Git Gud. If you want to use MnK,get a damn PC
---
Have you got down syndrome of you want to play mnk get a fooking pc. If you want to "invest into your hobby" Ubisoft have said countless times mnk in console is cheating and the only reason people dont get banned is it's impossible to detect
---
I mean the dbno is nice but agreed
---
I don‚Äôt have the exact message/tweet,but Ubisoft has stated that KMB on console is cheating.
---
And your argument is shit btw.
---
It was bandit and his pranks again... but I have the Acog. Thats all that matters
---
I wasn‚Äôt hating on your post lol
---
im glad thinking of it but the scary parts of them looking back where really fun
---
r/gatekeeping
---
I‚Äôve never understood why people wanna be so good at a game if they will never try to go pro. I really suck at the game and try to get better but I think I‚Äôm too old and my skill is decreasing by the second. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that there should be no reason to go through the lengths to connect a MnK to a console just to be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù unfairly. Logically, it‚Äôs costly and not needed. 
---
Side note: if anyone wants to see my atrocious stats, let me know.
---
Nobody will miss this fucko
---
Do you play on eu in plat? I got a game today on skyskraper where the game refused to let me connect, and i lost points for it. I could enter a casual while i was in the match so idk
---
Repost
---
A random gatekeeper in the wild!
---
To be fairrrrrr
---
Ima be hoest thought thought he was a girl
---
yes
---
I use controller on pc
---
Fuck you for tanking my headshots and claymores you piece of garbage.
---
You put the crosshairs on something and it goes in a straight line to about 8 meters, only reaching normal ceiling camera height. So think of it like this. Is the gadget within the dimensions of a normal size room. If yes point and shoot. If no don‚Äôt waste a charge
---
And I OOP
---
Funnily enough, when I'm one-shotting drones my game sucks. But if I'm chasing the fucker up and down the room like Frost here, I'm guaranteed a couple of kills that round.
---
Seething console pleb. 
---
Good ammo for the next time some sperg tries to tell me controller is just as good.
---
Note to self: I'm the most fucking retarded person alive please end me.
---
II‚Äôd say roughly 30-35% of my games have been ddosed on PS. It‚Äôs been Since the start too, lost 6 placements to it.
---
Yea, legitimate reason to be upset when you are trying to rank up but some diamond douche smurfs and pushes you back into silver because they "dont wanna try". The whole point of slowly rank up is to slowly introduce you into higher skill tiers, a bronze will see what a diamond smurf is doing but not know how they did it and even if they could do it they don't know the finer details of when to do it or best way to do it or what to do after.
---
lol very funny
---
This argument doesn't work because 95% of people in diamond on console use K&amp;M :(
---
Happy cake day lion main
---
You realize no one likes elitist douches like you right? I wasnt even arguing about being able to hack a console, I wasnt saying a console is better than your almighty pc. I was saying there isnt hackers on siege on console, which there isnt. You cant give me any proof. Find a single video of a hacker on console then talk to me, otherwise I'm done arguing with people who dont know what their talking about.
---
Ok but what about Wii fit game pad users? You talk about mouse and keyboard players as if they‚Äôre top tier when these fuckers are untouchable.
---
Damn that sucks. I‚Äôve only played like 35 games of ranked so far this season and haven‚Äôt seen it once
---
since when the hell can you use keyboard and mouse on console?
---
the f around place is TH if you ask me.
---
yeah I do and thank u!
---
Why hipfire?
---
The pulse C4 from below mechanic is an instant kill for the pulse player in most scenarios with no real way for the attackers to counter, and the only way it's not a kill would be because the pulse player isn't that great. Echo is easily countered by an attentive IQ or hell even a Thatcher EMP or just good eyes. Mute is an intel denial op. He is usually incredible in late round drone sessions. A mute ban would be a map reliant pick for me, like for example, on Oregon.
---
Why not give us the option to turn them on or off? Just removing features is just lazy IMO.
---
It was stupid as fuck but I liked it more than I‚Äôd ever admit.
---
But what if they play cav?
---
When I'm trying to go upstairs at 3am to get food, but I forgot my mom mains frost.
---
Then they can spend more money themselves and play on pc instead of buying mnk to play on console.
---
True, it's just a DMR that's seems to be meta like you were saying. Always exceptions to the rules though. I just want Mav's DMR buffed. Probably won't happen but I am glad to see I am not the only one.
---
But no one will acknowledge that anywhere
---
No

Nice aim

Had a somewhat similar experience with ScreaM in a Faceit lobby for CSGO, was not fun, do not recommend.

Why is it even allowed on console

valk ain't thicc enough üò§

Um what
---
Is mouse and keyboard really that big of an issue? I honestly cant see why m&amp;o would clap controllers
---
Or you could all buy mouse's and keyboard and not be such pussies about people who have control preferences. It isn't an uneven playing field. EVERYONE who has the money to buy the console and the game are ALSO capable of spending at most $50 bucks on a cheap mouse and keyboard set to use. Nobody has to PC players also buy controllers because they prefer them with certain games. Console players are equally able to do the same and I encourage itn
---
Sorry I‚Äôm not trying to be offensive but is this satire? I‚Äôm low iq
---
Ok to play devils advocate I considered using keyboard and mouse on console bc my friends don‚Äôt have pc and controllers ruin games for me. Also I don‚Äôt play ranked bc Idc about that so I wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúfaking my skill‚Äù or anything.
---
I would love a Casino map in Siege but I doubt it will ever happen. They already tried to get rid of gambling themed things in a level so I doubt we will get a full casino map which is disappointing.
---
Unlock Jager. Also, how does the other one stay locked forever, that makes no sense.
---
Buck is doing some real delicious barbecue
---
I Keep getting it on all the operators i dont play.
---
2.99 USD I think
---
Its more accurate, and easier to aim with... its not too big of an issue until you hit plat 2
---
Well, some people don't ask the "What if? " and decide to skill cap themselves. I don't think I'll understand it but I will love killing those players... Over and over and... Over... And over.... üòÅ

I‚Äôve always had the idea how to get leaning while hip firing on console. A way to do this would be to look in ADS and lean, but if you let go of LT or L2 while leaning, you would come out leaning left and right hip firing.

Seems like I always manage to run out of bullets way before that point

Remember when Ela was usable on console? It‚Äôs been like 1.5 years

I use a mouse clit. It's just as disturbing to watch as it is to use it.

I‚Äôm sorry that you are confined to the world of poor aim that is console. Come. Join the master race and be the best you can be.

His horrendous pick rate is due to his almost completely useless gadget.
---
Giving him the Commando will not help his pick rate.Instead of giving him a better weapon selection,how about we improve his gadget,ey?
---
And that's why unranked is a thing! Funny how it works out, huh?
---
God I wish someone could make that.
---
As a Dokkaebi main...nice.

Like any other shield op,yeeting impacts onto the front of her shield should solve your problems.

Then when she is downed,you can interrogate her as to why picking Clash was a good idea.

Glad I‚Äôm not the only one

Thats what I was going to say

I say lesion

And what is this ‚Äúmaster race‚Äù you speak of?

You are the enemy of the people

That‚Äôs quite an old video as well
---
well they were named alibi their profile picture was a black car and they were diamond they also picked recruit every round and walked side to side for the entire round
---
Im glad the unranked playlist is being brought in for players like you.
---
You can probably wait until she tries to defend against the other team and you should easily be able to teamkill her

Hey guys, Jeff here with another community update. Since it seems you guys don't like the Smoke or Ela elite skins, we've decided to give Blitz another. We have also removed Blackbeard's rifle shield entirely because fuck you

I missread, it was a little confusing to my 7am wake up brain, i gyess its just a visual glitch or somethin

I haven't played on PC since Halo 2 but I did use my Xbox controller to do so. If I ever get another gaming PC again, I'll do the same. I think it's just way easier, altho that probably just comes down to being more familiar and comfortable with it. Using a mouse to aim just wasn't fast enough for me.

How did you get an animated background?

It does.

She is the easiest op to defeat just use your impacts

It is a runout significantly more dangerous. The amount of times my friend has done this runout and dies is significantly more than the amount of times he has gotten kills. Attackers have the time to react to it if they are paying attention and can punish the runout as a free kill.
---
Ubi take note
---
Permanently? Jesus Christ
---
They aren't cheating
---
How is that cheating exactly?
---
It still is. It just isn't a gim that can frag a whole team in one mag.
---
I think a good nerf would be jackle scans you but he also gets every other scan
---
Because it provides those players with an unfair advantage and is considered by Ubisoft to be cheating? Maybe that's why? 
---
Its not exactly hard to imagine why people are justifiably angry at such cheaters.
---
Wouldn't say I'm being a nazi, persay. Still though, it's an easy fix, just use the right your.
---
If i go a whole clip without taking out a drone, I just try to joke around with the drone until prep phase is over to smash it
---
So... I actually do this. I can't used to the keyboard and mouse on COD... I dont do THAT bad. Excited for modern warfare matching to input.
---
Shit idk bout you but I play with a thrustmaster
---
It's not supported. You have to buy an adapter to simulate a controller's inputs.
---
Can we all just, I dunno, play with whatever controller we want?
---
Damn I'm late to the party, this is a simple tip but will instantly improve your skill with him, put the enemy in situations where no matter what you win (unless you have my aim which is equivalent to a potatoe with 3 tumors) To counter Lions ability you can't move so you want to put them in a position where you know where they are if they stay still and where they are if they move when using his gadet
---
I agree with this so much. I'm usually the person in my 4 stack to be like yo guys chill
---
They don't in seige. You have to use an adapter
---
It sucks but you can‚Äôt get them again for a very long time.

Ikr what are those

Good on you man.

I really don‚Äôt care about my insults is the thing tho
---
??? You telling me you don't even get dubs using sign language?
---
Kind quirky ngl
---
Why Ubisoft bully a simple casual like me.
---
Personally after some thought, I feel like its really the requirement of standing still and Zofia ignoring his glasses despite her gadgets stuns being used in basically the same situations as flashes. 
---
I dont have many people to talk to about this since most my friends are terrible at the game and are basically zombies with guns but for 1 I feel making his gadget work while moving would help out a lot, and if that doesn't seem to work let its effect persist for a second or two after standing still then going away 
---
As for blocking Zofia and technically Ela's stuns doesn't make much sense realistically sure, but by design it just doesn't make much sense to me that a gadget that is used similarly to flashes still hurts him so much, my solution to this would be either reducing the effects intensity or duration while the glasses are on. Of course she would still get the Intel he is there but it would make Zofia think twice if she already doesn't about pushing like a mad man after sending out a stun
---
I dont know about you guys, but the few times wardens ability would have been useful my glasses were on cool down because I tried flexing on someone prior to the engagement, If his glasses were able to be activated while on cool down similarly to Vigil or Cav
---
I knew you could use mouse and keyboard on console, but I didn‚Äôt know you could use it on siege. I never saw anyone lean on console

Dropping a link here: /r/XIM.

In the lore he was a really bad guy

Classic siege comment tbh

They always overreact though and go from death star levels of danger to stormtrooper.

Actually the original version Einstein suggested to Schrodinger used involved gunpowder. So a bomb is not far off. The point is that we have no way of knowing what is going on in the box including sound and visual methods.
---
Well done
---
Ratted E for epilepsy warning
---
I read this as both a true statement (yes using kbm on console is very sad) and as someone who perhaps got beat and couldn‚Äôt handle it. So they decided to blame it on someone using a superior setup. I have found that all gaming rants start from a place of being unable to handle a loss.
---
Fortnite allows m&amp;k
---
*nuts with nostalgia*
---
i do that all the time. damn i suck
---
If you have the option to use m+kb you should be allowed to use it
---
If you care that much about a video game you got some serious issues. I understand where you are coming from but it should never bother you that much.
---
This wouldn't work though. Think of those rare instances where an enemy downs their teammate and a twitch kills them while they're down for example. Boom, innocent player banned. You could try to have a safeguard against it in that case but then hackers might just abuse twitch drones that have unlimited ammo or something. So it wouldn't actually fix it.
---
Ubisoft doesn't support M&amp;K for R6 because it gives places a rather obvious advantage over those using a controller. Ergo, if you use a third-party adapter to circumvent these restrictions then you in fact cheating. 
---
What else would you call breaking the rules of the game?
---
Casino map, next DLC PLEASE GOD
---
Spicy  and dangerous. üå∂
---
Great..... But thanks anyways. Im waiting for either dokki or warden

Warden was in need of a buff

Goddamn CrossFit

Wardens PL set will be coming out around Sept 17th.
---
Thx
---
ehh, i mean it would help but we have all capped someone in the head since they we're running in front of you when you were trying to shoot a drone. dont lie to yourself.
---
How do you do this?
---
It shows that they‚Äôre self aware and don‚Äôt think themselves superior than others, which is comforting
---
how is it not a hard counter it completely negates / makes hi ability useless if your on it ?
---
Nice bro
---
My friend wanted me to use KBM on PS4. I refused.
---
They need to add a zero the that renown
---
Nah weapons skins are the worst
---
Cav switched teams there
---
Better lesson: dont play console at all
---
Gotta agree with you here. Other people might hate me for using m&amp;k but this is the way it works for me. I normally play PC for almost everything (and usually play high/max rank in most games). Occasionally, a game will come out that all my friends on console play. For the two-three months the game is popular I just want to play with them, but learning to use a controller again just isn‚Äôt worth it. I use to be good at controller when I was younger but after playing PC for so long taking the time to learn one again just isn‚Äôt worth it for how long I‚Äôll need it. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm trying to be the best at the game or cheat, I just wanna play with some friends and actually enjoy playing while doing it.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed that it‚Äôs replaced M&amp;K but just you wait until ubi does something about ddossers (if they do something) and then they will just go back to M&amp;K
---
I guess you took up the hobby? Since it's 4 months later lol
---
I wish I could see, BUT TWITTER BANNED MY ACCOUNT AND I CANT SEE

Glad to see you all want to see the game die from people making it unplayableüëç true gamers

So are operators that represent defense and attack are they your most played characters if so that‚Äôs really cool

Microsoft allow MnK for the CONSOLE. By release games on their console, that is saying yes by default.

The items locked behind it are fucking cosmetics only, and I‚Äôm sure most of the skins in the battle pass will be obtainable through alpha packs and renown themselves, like I said you don‚Äôt have to buy the battle pass if you don‚Äôt want to, it literally doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. Next your going to tell me you want free elite skins.
---
Faith in humanity restored
---
I think I lost a few brain cells just reading this.
---
Why you say this?
---
I don't know. The R6 community had a hell of a tantrum when Operation Health happened, and I can only imagine it'll be worse this time. Plus, I'm curious to see the Indian and Kenyan ops and the Theme Park rework.
---
The man with the weakest pull out game
---
Bandit &lt;3
---
I already went there, says he can't get banned. Figured I'd get the word out to make sure
---
Beach.. you mean pool?
---
What do u mean majority of twitch players plat 2 + literally pick twitch for the gun lmao
---
It‚Äôs just as bad on Xbox. Worse on PC sometimes..
---
No. You can select what operators you wanna display out front. It's an old update but probably new to you console players
---
Ur damn right my man
---
Brother, I assert dominance with the PSVR aim controller on console(legit a vr gun).
---
I‚Äôve encountered it 4 days in a row. It‚Äôs always a 5 stack of diamonds
---
How long would it take to get all the skins for everything tho? Theres over 1k skins wouldn't it still take an extremely long time?
---
Pc is New York and we are the Midwest with weirdos and no internet connnextuin
---
We're not talking about FPS games, we're taking about controllers.
---
3D fighter being your preference doesn't make other fighters simple, that's ignorant as hell. 
---
And most people, the actual majority, not people who think their singular opinion is the majority, talk about him as one of the best fighting game players, even when he loses. He plays about 5 different fighters at a competitive level and uses a controller instead of a gamepad. 
---
Either way, I thought I could humble you, but your young, clearly, and it's the internet. Can't fix broken people with a message.
---
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries
---
I like you name lol
---
No loot boxes but you can buy cosmetics.
---
Dlc every 3 months 2 new ops and a new map or a rework.
---
Lots of good people but the ranking system separated them (or tries to) 
---
Welcome to the game!
---
This thread knocked 6 years off my life.
---
Ubisoft needs to make this a skin. Make Cav more terrifying
---
I used to play PlayStation,but everyone just whines on there like this guy.Ive only met 3 propel who I actually didn't mind on playstation
---
Ahh well that explains it
---
REAL BOOMER HOURS
---
I was amazed by how real I looked when i put my face in the character with the Xbox camera,
---
That's not what they said I've talked to support about it and I've been following this situation since the first day they announced mnk support for xbox. They said it's up to the developers to determine if they want mnk support that's why you can't just plug in mnk and expect it to work on siege you need an adapter to trick the console into thinking the mnk is a controller. Believe me the head of xbox Phil Spencer has said this multiple times in articles that covered the announcement of mnk support on xbox.
---
Atleast he didnt trick you to shoot your own frost mat.. wich i totally have never done btw so shut up!
---
******NUT******
---
So is Schrodinger's cat basically just overcomplicating the phrase "I don't know"? When asked if the cat is dead?
---
I remember printing a picture of hitler and doing that
---
Well then it's an 18 second ace.
---
Theirs alpha packs that give you skins but you earn those just by winning games and theirs ‚Äúa season pass‚Äù that gives ou all the new operaters or that year but if you play you can earn money and buy them without spending any money on the game other than buying it for the first time
---
I can't engage at kid range because I'm a registered sex offender
---
controllers are just a handicap
---
That was a really good clip
---
I wasn‚Äôt able to clip mine due to the power going out just after I pulled it off. Was on plane holding the front entrance with a Tachanka turret, entire team runs up and gets mowed down
---
It wouldn‚Äôt work.KMB players buy adapters for a reason;so they can stomp on controller players without being detected.Even if KMB support came out,they would still use adapters to play against controller.
---
Does he need a buff? No.
---
Should they do this? Yes, it'd be nice.
---
It would, but that's the general consensus on why they won't get rid of duplicates.
---
Unless the keyboard comes with the adapter built in but again it's still an adapter to trick the console.
---
You're missing the point. It doesn't matter what they say. If Microsoft allow MnK support on their console, then every single developer who publishes a game for Xbox is agreeing to MnK support by default, regardless of what they say.
---
Yes. Don't play him though horrible operator a ha ha
---
" We're not talking about FPS games "
---
Yes we are
---
" 3D fighter being your preference doesn't make other fighters simple"
---
I never said that. The fact that they are objectively simpler makes them simpler. They're lacking an entire dimension that you have to think about during gameplay. This isn't rocket science. 
---
Again, what I said was in the context of FPS, as was the OP. Then you swung in like Autismo the great with an "Uhrer Ashkutally" like, literally what the fuck are you talking about? LOL
---
"Someones arguing with me they must be young"
---
Cope harder.
---
Then they need like a csgo overwatch system or something
---
R6 community has tantrums over everything and anything.
---
Well that‚Äôs being fixed.
---
Round starts
---
In british accent ‚Äú I‚Äôm too old for this shit‚Äù
---
Not liking people who hack makes me a not cool propel? Should I also do it so the game dies faster for new players?
---
More like saying "Could be either". Its created to explain how ridiculous quantum mech is and really can't be applied to macro world well
---
Heck yeah! Add me ZeroTwo#8217
---
Where‚Äôs the skin,said you drew it but I don‚Äôt see it
---
I use mouse and keyboard to be average :(
---
WHO'S WITH ME?!?!
---
I don‚Äôt really mind honestly, I was just preferring girls over males, but I don‚Äôt mind playing with anyone. :)
---
Im using tilt controls in my car.
---
1.  There is a lootbox system, you only get charms and skins for weapons and operators. Nothing that changes gameplay.
---
2. There is seasonal content. There are 4 seasons per year, and each one comes with new characters and a map. The maps are free to everyone. However, all characters besides the recruit need to be unlocked, either by a season pass or a bundle (which cost irl money), or individually with renown, the in game currency.
---
3. The game tries to match players by level, so you shouldn't have to start out against high level players, allowing you to get used to the game.
---
switch to PS4
---
Thank you. You are now my friend
---
You're an idiot. I'm going to bed now.
---
But they cant detect it bc  people use adapters. how do they ban people that they can't even detect? That's why if you send in clips of it to ubisoft they can see how they move and look around in the clip. You can tell when someone is using mnk fairly easily through gameplay. You can get people banned for a short period if the clip shows enough gameplay. Like for example the one I got last month had someone walking down a hall after killing me and just the way he walked around isn't possible for a controller or an adaptive controller (the one that helps disabled people play video games). It was 100% proof of mnk and a couple days later I got hate from the guy just because he was banned for a bit idk how long but he was very upset with me.

 #BRUH Moment
---
ties go to attackers now. been a change for a little while now
---
Ok. That changes the situation. Thanks for letting me know.
---
It seems that because this incident occured when I had 2FA ON (which makes sense as I wasn't hacked or anything, just added an ssd to my comp) and because of that Ubisoft can't do anything... Battleye is really my only chance now... :/
---
#Laughs in Maverick and Twitch
---
Now kiss!
---
Is that like the ‚Äúlore‚Äù of the game or is that just an assumption. Just curious lol
---
I think my first ever ace was with Blackbeard when he was mad broken.
---
I‚Äôm not 100% proud of it.
---
Congratulations man!
---
Twitch? I completely understand maverick, but youre gonna have to do some mental gymnastics to make me think twitch is a good ban
---
That‚Äôs why I just get in discord with my friends haha. Took about 4 times getting called n****r and fag queen to realize this wasn‚Äôt church camp lmao. Do like the game and have played enough FPS games to quickly switch to discord chat haha. I like the strategy of siege :)
---
Plan on making any more of these? These are pretty cute :)
---
Just yeet softballs at the diamond room and you will get it
---
I thought you were talking about Banning Thatcher so hard breaching will be harder
---
I am an Indian. We are the ones who are thrown under racism and for not having toilets for some reason. /s
---
As a console gamer, I can respect that üëå
---
Oh lol didnt think of it that way, my bad
---
Nice repost you got there
---
I didn't even think about good bans . My bad too
---
Not cool man you literally just stole a post that was posted TODAY
---
What a cat fight, it really reminds me of high school girl fights where they get all close to each other and nothing happens till it gets broken up.
---
Lore
---
Thats a bit of an exaggeration dont you think?
---
Okay but I hate skimping on the power supply and ram/m.2 gotta have the good storage and power and it'll run forever.
---
As a console gamer, I respect people who play on even ground. Especially when it comes to siege.
---
Well!! Fuck you I am a black lesbian with rickets!

Wow interesting, I didn‚Äôt know that!

Dude that's fuckin crazy it seems like lesion is just destined to get double headshots by accident. I got one on Oregon in the double wide window where one of the bombs is

Do you have a specific map?
---
Yea I mean the children are crying bc they arent getting any new pew pew boomsticks taking away more would melt down the sub again
---
Maybe they like it better. Idk, it's possible.
---
i actually do the same, i tell people im a god on console.
---
Don't be afraid to solo queue. If someone says "you're bad" just respond with "it's just a video game." Also before you tell someone they are bad just remember it's a video game. Play to have fun. I exclusively play ranked and I solo queue often. That's just what I personally find fun.
---
This feels like the beginning of a casting couch episode... it seems bandit got into another addiction after missing his coca
---
If u are good on pc and you decide to play mnk on console you are Still good but I hate braindead mnk on console with to fast sens they have 0 skills
---
She certainly sees play with it, but every time I use it it feels like trying to control a jackhammer. At least with her smg you could see your opponent after a couple shots...
---
Bro, why everyone Hating, it‚Äôs just one god damn operator
---
r/surrealmemes
---
Even better, GSG9 Recruits with the German Shotty (don't kill me, forgot the name)
---
Is there any other reason to complain about free accounts in ranked? Figured it wasn‚Äôt very 200iq of me to think that.
---
They happen simultaneously in R6S.
---
If you want to try out operators just play the test server
---
But you can still get  banned for it and if the dev's say it's cheating and Microsoft says it's up to the developers if it's cheating which they say it is and it is bannable from siege. So your saying it's not cheating just because Microsoft allows 3rd party software on games that allow it? So this game doesn't allow it so it is cheating. Look the makers of the game say it's cheating and you can get banned for it. Its cheating because Microsoft gives the developers the choice if it is or not. it's cheating because Microsoft lets the developers decide if it's cheating to which they say it is. So there for it is cheating. Microsoft says it's up to the developers and they have no say in this game if it is or not but the developers do and they say it is. Mnk on rainbow six siege on xbox is currently cheating until ubisoft makes an announcement that it isn't and that they  implement support for mnk.
---
I just typed in "kaid" and here we are üòÇ

Look at me I'm u/urmonator and I have no arguments
---
Oh really. Thanks. So can I go into like a free mode and try out all their gadgets?
---
Obviously a epic gamer, I can see
---
I played Beaulo on the TS the other day, and I ended up in his latest video. I thought it would be fun to make a youtube video showing my perspective of the game, and I decided to post it here as well. Let me know what you think!

Good chance it's the same guy

Nice
---
All I can see is you repeating cheating and cheating and cheating. You don't get it do you. It's not cheating. If it was cheating, Microsoft wouldn't allow it. The independent developers' opinion is irrelevant. What they want to do with their game is their problem.
---
If I did decide to buy them all, since I cant upgrade to ultimate am I meant to buy year 1 and 2 and buy r6 currency to buy year 3,4 ? Or use r6 for year 3 and buy the year 4 pass?
---
Yeah fuck them literally FORCING us to buy their micro transactions. My wife already divorced me because of how much I spent on these optional purchases.

I think he needs to be the only 3 armor and 3 speed in the game. Ez fix

I got the one that I tried at Shambhala music festival right outside of Salmo BC. I definitely enjoyed what I had, and even considered finding a recipe to make for myself.... But I figure I should just wait till next year hehe
---
My easiest option would be buy the ultimate edition on steam wouldnt it?
---
It's not their fault if you have any of these. 1. A prohibited program installed on your PC. 2. Not Battleye enabled when launching the game. 3. Doing any exploits with the game. 4. Being toxic/unfriendly.
---
Did you buy a second hand PC or second hand hard drive or something?
---
That is what I thought. Thanks for the info
---
Just let people use what they're confortable with.  Fuck keyboard and mouse.  Whenever I'm on PC, I use my xbox controller.  ..why?  You ask?  Because I do what I want.  :)
---
I used to play at much higher sensitivity, but nowadays my aim is too shaky on high DPI/high sens...
---
I used to be able to aim with 5cm per 360... I'm now at 24.91cm per 360.

I absolutely agree, but I would like to be able to visit r/rainbow6 without considering becoming Amish and never seeing the internet again

Do you have all the operators?

Shut up, brand

Stating facts isn't being salty, you just can't accept what I am saying (which I couldn't care less about) and so you insult me instead. You really are soooo clever.

Mhm and you're wasting everyone's time. Actually you are a waste of space. Try and do something with my art its has my signatures and watermarks  ;)

These catch flak for not being "true Rainbow" games but they're fun as hell. Vegas 2 still holds up in 2019. They make me wish Siege had a single player campaign.

I would like to thank you for this opportunity. I have been playing CS for 14 years and wastempted to try R6 but did not buy it, now gave it a shot for free and after 3 games i instantly purchased it and loving it, so hard but so enjoyable

tell me about it, I had 3 team killers in the same match last night, who all killed me for no reason, other than that I was trying to defend the bomb by reinforcing the giant howl in the wall. it's really driven me away, I dont see the point of trying to play ranked when people are just going to shoot you in the back just cos they think their way is better, even when their way involved blowing a giant hole in a wall that overlooked a staircase, and gave the enemy team easy access.
---
Ik I'm just saying

I use my samsung fridge

you can get killed easily from there, so it's only a good spot when the enemies don't know that spot

The thing is elas shotgun is much stronger the the sasg or m870 due to the facts it has almost no recoil is clip feed and has the lowest damage drop rate for a shotgun in the gane cause of its extended barrel option

It doesn't force you. And you don't pay with real money so what the hell are you bitching about?
---
&gt;I‚Äôm honestly considering giving up on this game which is a shame because aside from this and the typical ubi incompetence and no console keyboard support it‚Äôs not a bad game
---
Why would you need keyboard support on console?
---
People downvote because they aren‚Äôt intelligent enough and lack the experience to actually know that what I‚Äôm saying is true lol. It‚Äôs easier for them to blindly deny and dismiss what I say, and keep using the excuse that helps them feel better about their terrible gameplay.
---
I wish siege implemented the gun mechanics of vegas 1. Would be better if they made it like rainbow six 3. Sucks that you have to always ADS even at close range to hit shots on siege.
---
The only downside to the vegas games was the health regen, but overall a solid game. Played in many gamebattles matches.

Okay first of all my internet would not affect the entire lobby, second of all after I got an ace in round 1 I got a message saying they were gonna lag us out and I might as well leave, having heard that before I ignored them but suddenly the entire lobbies pings went into the hundreds and 2 guys who clearly knew what was happening rushed us and killed us all while we were teleporting all over the place, my internet eventually switched off shortly before the end of round 4 and I came back to the typical moron messages from that same dude insulting me and more dumb threats.
---
Would be nice. Be she doesn't need a buff.
---
Her only downside is that she has no nades and this makes a pretty good operator I'd say.
---
Wait what
---
nice
---
you can also start it from uplay
---
Im pretty sure it detects you are using mouse and keyboard board and puts you onto pc servers, i may be wrong please tell me if this is the case
---
So?
---
It would allow people like me to play mouse and keyboard without having to use an adapter, it could open up for cross play with PC (At least for Xbox) and would solve the issue of controller players being stomped on by XIM users, sure some would still cheat and use an adapter for the easier matches but not all
---
Coppers unite!
---
You know im just meming you right?
---
Honestly theres noting you can do,just report them and ubi will fix it like they did with the emote spam
---
No. Case closed
---
You can go fuck yourself. Skillless cunt.
---
Actually, all ops were finished by Health.
---
&gt; His guns are meh with mediocre sights
---
His 9x19 is very good. It's a very standard gun, which is not a bad thing. You can master it well, and easily enough. Other guns need a lot of practice to make them work, especially on console on which I play [example the Vector].
---
&gt; Traps take way to long to set up and you need to forget reinforcing if you want an efficient set up. And most people in higher ranks drone out his traps making them useless.
---
Traps could be set up quicker, which is why I suggest Ubisoft speed up the animation.
---
Secondly, you can stop the enemy team from droning them out if you use him in a combo with a Mozzie or a Mute. It works very well in my team's combo. I get a kill or two using just his EDDs alone quite regularly.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs like saying Frost is underrated. She isn‚Äôt, she has a place in some strats.
---
Frost is a bit of a different story because her gadget is very powerful [one shot DBNO] but her gun is quite bad and possibly too bad for her gadget's level. There can be some tweaks made to the gadget to make it strong enough that her gun stays at its level: such as making it a hook instead of a mat.
---
&gt; The most underrated defender right now would probably be Smoks IMO
---
I would disagree with this because Smoke is pretty easy to use, so a lot of people are now using him. His popularity has surged recently, especially on console.
---
&gt; Can delay/stop a plant for a total of 45 seconds
---
Quite useless actually because the plant time, when Smoke is at his most powerful, is only 5 seconds now. When it becomes 7 seconds, he will be very useful in these stages, as Kixstar said. 
---
However, Smoke's gadget is only really useful when there is little time. It's not going to do much earlier in the round  when the attackers have plenty of time to wait it out. Before you know it, as a Smoke player, you've deployed 3 smokes just to make them wait out long enough to have any meaning. Then again, I'm not the best Smoke player so I understand my arguments are not the best, but I'm just talking based off of my experience.
---
The kit is actually shit, again I'm talking about console. The FMG-9 is solid, but has less damage than Kapkan's 9x19, and the rate of fire for Kapkan's 9x19 makes getting headshots easier and mid-fire correction. The SMG-11 on console is absolutely garbage. The shotgun is very limiting, as it forces you to only play close-range. The pistol is okay though.
---
On PC, it's a totally different story with regards to his guns, so I understand your point.
---
Wait aren't you the guy who was playing casual on Coastline yesterday when a hibana tk'd a buck?
---
That. was. Amazing. I hate friends, but it was very epic

actually I couldnt find any rule against any sort of spawnpeeking/runouts
---
I‚Äôve already stated why I don‚Äôt put my tag here. It has nothing to do with getting a PC. You are here spreading false bullshit because you are too bad to admit you just lost, and it was actually due to you/your team not performing that game. It‚Äôs easier to just say ‚ÄúFucking MnK users‚Äù LMAO. Your console friends are the only ones dumb enough to believe your made up numbers, so that‚Äôs why I said your ‚Äúlittle console friends‚Äù. Now come back with some facts instead of made up bullshit.
---
MVP is not hard Just pick sledge and open everthing

I keep saying they need to do a operation Vegas and add bishop and knight as attack and defense ops and remake three Kings casino.

Oh my fucking lord, controller users can't just "get good at aiming" on a level where it's even remotely close to the aim of m&amp;kb. You can't seem to get that through your head. M&amp;kb users always has an advantage over controller users. I don't see what's so hard to understand about that.
---
And the quote is what you're implying. It's called *paraphrasing*.
---
"Its good to be hold, but not to be greedy."
---
Here is a fact. I put my tag on here to back up what I say. You didnt, you're a coward and talking out your ass. Bye.

I never will:/

Doggy doggy what now?

It's horrendous on console..

Constant DDOS attacks, mouse and keyboard players, people leaving when they're DBNO, it's just full on toxic

make sure you aren‚Äôt downloading the ultra HD textures those add like 40 gigs

Yeah, the very first thing to do is to make a report in r6fix and then post the r6fix link into this reddit post.

Nah but seriously congrats
---
VALHALLAAAAAAA
---
Ah yes, fuse elite, pay $20 to look good while killing the hostage
---
I think he‚Äôs saying git gud
---
thx alot
---
Plz, take care of Finka, IQ don‚Äôt hurt them
---
u too man
---
Also his thing havks drones, lions scan is froma drone
---
We're in agreement, you just have no reading comprehension. My original statement was that controller people can't get good (at aiming).
---
nah
---
Well given wall hacks are nothing like mouse and keyboard I'm gonna go with pretty hard to grasp. Basically I guess you guys just need to git gud and make the switch.
---
BR^U^H
---
When ever I do an update it always jumps from like 1h to 18 days but actually takes like half an hour but idk about you.
---
Mnk is prevalant and op, but has been for a while -- the ddosing is the major issue.
---
Year 1 dlc‚Äôs for the deluxe, that + year 4 pass for gold, and all of it for ultimate edition
---
Seeing people think this is ebic hacker coding is just hilarious to an actual programmer.
---
Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt control Battleye. 
---
Also, coding is not as simple as if():or whatever you guys think.
---
oh it's just black eyes on negative effect...
---
If your social score is less than a hacker's you should be concerned
---
Mostly due to the damage lowering aspect. Personally wish it lowered the damage much less since it already doesn't help with the recoil after all.
---
one time an update said over one year and then 30 seconds later it was less than a minute

no one commenting the red dot in the recruit famas?

and then it takes you  less that 10 seconds to change it. Just try it.

Except I think mercy‚Äôs pistol is better than the mpx

I'm seeing an increasing number of people using this hack

Insert ex mercy main noise here
---
Yeah dude this is the most harmfull world in the word
---
i use nothing exept my thought of a wii remote.
---
I can agree with this
---
Agreed
---
Its not exactly their gun that are the problem, its their abilities because both are incredibly situational.
---
I won‚Äôt hesitate! Thanks :)
---
Ash's weapons are way better than IQs with less recoil. At least in my opinion.
---
Reminded me of those stick figure sniping games
---
J√§ger was a 3 speed operator with acog and was too good at spawnpeeking with it.
---
Each elite is 1620 R6 credits, so it's between like 12-20 depending on how many R6 you buy. PM me that site please, sounds shady as hell.
---
Where‚Äôd you get this?
---
BONK
---
And I don't say it won't be better. I'm a huge IQ Dan. She was my first op. It's just not necessary. She is in a good spot right now.
---
Sorry to say, but this is worse.
---
Still playing TF2, eh? Another man of culture I see
---
Looks amazing
---
If this is the whole costume we def need a photo in it lmao
---
ive had this happen but it was an ace with a reflex on zofia's lmg from spawn
---
TheGoodlyNoob use very often Twitch but those video are not very suited for learning xD
---
I did?
---
Back before siege changed the fact that defenders could go outside in the prep phase, me and my friend joined a match and in the first round the each defender went to each attackers spawn point and found good cover. When we spawned, a smoke hid behind a truck, peeked over and killed most of us.
---
*SHOOT THE FUCKERS*
---
This not needed, at all
---
I didn‚Äôt know that, that‚Äôs actually scary
---
What about the piss snow skin?
---
Ohhh that feel
---
Console is very different from pc (at least from what I have heard) so why does ubi make the same patches and changes on both platforms?
---
The doooo?
---
Nah
---
Yes but better guns would help. Nokk is ment to be an entry Fragger and she can really do that with the fmg 9 cause it is so shit. 
---
Wardens gadget is situational but again a better gun would definitely  up his pick rate and make home better
---
Yeah he is funny as hell. He‚Äôs basically on the border of being informative and funny at the same time.
---
"Am I a fockin' joke to you?
---
You sir, just sent me full chub.
---
This looks like a modified smg-11 but it still looks badass nonetheless
---
Hey u/i_wana_fuck_hibana look at this.
---
Cute
---
Some people don‚Äôt like it though and would rather a harder hitting but slower firing weapon. The MPX is fairly weak regardless of its low recoil and sometimes you can feel it. I see no issue is allowing an alternative that‚Äôs probably a similar strength to the MPX just different. I feel this is important
---
you just kill 5 people, thats it
---
First of all, it‚Äôs not inferior, it‚Äôs different. Yes, playing with a mouse and keyboard is faster but it‚Äôs not bad if everyone is using a controller. And secondly, the consoles are meant to be played with controllers. Most people play them that way and it‚Äôs unfair if you don‚Äôt.
---
what, the base ops are still extremely strong and many of them find themselves to be top tier across all ranks. you can say a lot of things about the new ops but "power creep" is absolutely not one of them lol
---
A remake of these games would be grate! :)
---
Or, use either because some people can‚Äôt use Xbox controllers but don‚Äôt want to spend $2000+ on a pc so they use a $6 keyboard and mouse they got from their grandparent‚Äôs 14 year old computer. Xbox is a cheap pc without a heap of features to put it simply, if you have a problem with someone *getting an edge over you* either get it yourself and spend 15 bucks on some tech that apparently makes you ‚Äòso much better‚Äô or in your own words, get good son. Get so good that even a pc/Xbox keyboard players can‚Äôt fight you. Not saying I see anything wrong with your statement but hey, Xbox controller = ~$50. Cheap keyboard + mouse = ~$15-20.
---
1v4?
---
i love the down votes gimme gimme LMAO
---
There's no timer system for getting in ace like you'd find in something like League. I'm pretty sure the community here and in general just count an ace when you personally kill all five enemies, even if you're just getting the very last hit in.
---
Take my upvote fellow gamer, you got the point here
---
Play on PC if it‚Äôs superior then. Consoles are sold with controllers because they‚Äôre meant to be played that way.
---
not even leaning
---
We need more people like you in this world
---
Acs12 worst
---
I finally just got my first ace after several poor man‚Äôs aces. It was pretty sloppy though and only in casual.. but still üòÅ
---
The fire rate makes it better than the French shotgun. So maybe second worst.
---
It‚Äôs on Minecraft and SOT?
---
That was Glaz
---
Sounds like a whole lot of crying from someone whom refuses to adapt to meta tbqh
---
His is amazing
---
STOP! I can only get so moist.
---
:)
---
No, because they‚Äôd use their in house engine and ruin it.
---
yep, they all rushed me
---
9mmc1 would be a little op on warden though
---
That's actually pretty cool. Making the huge circle into a giant eyeball, it also suits his gadget.
---
Because the last enemy was basically afk outside holding up the match? I dont care if I lose the round, you bet your ass I'm running outside trying to kill this bish
---
MacieJay does a video dedicated to every operator so you could try his videos on the operators you want to get better with :)
---
Why does this look like a gay porn?
---
Yes but then she also needs her vaulting to be silenced also. This and an MP5K makes her balanced.
---
Head gear is so good
---
Make it so warden can use his gadget when its recharging like vigil and cav. We dont need the p90
---
id recommend the razer kraken v7 , pretty sure its $80 and it has a good surround sound for the price and is very comfortable, the only issue is it has usb although you can get an adapter from usb or use one of your usb ports on your playstation, there are ones with aux but i think they are more expensive
---
Me too! Who wants a zombiegame... -.- this is so awful
---
The quiet aspect definitely. But you know MP5K only has a slightly less drop off but otherwise pretty much same as FMG right?
---
You‚Äôre doing a great job and I love you
---
Or shot a fire alarm.
---
I don‚Äôt think it will. It‚Äôs not an OP weapon on Frost, who is a quicker operator with a more useful gadget overall. 
---
With warden being slower and having a weaker gadget overall, I see no issue with this change. People would still play the MPX as much as they would the 9mm C1 as they offer different benefits, which is great for weapon selection. 
---
It‚Äôs similar to Mozzie, whereby he has two primaries which perform differently while both are super viable
---
Just depends on what you like imo, I‚Äôd rather let someone else who loves him use him
---
Maybe, I never got to play newcomer, but I assume most people just play casual, it's the same but it has way more players. Low playerbase tend to mean extremely long matchmaking times
---
Normal only.
---
Hard and above, there are bombers.
---
I prefer miras to be fair just because the amount of headshots I've had because of it is mad, but lions it's just an easier to control, twice the round capacity and higher damage version, it's great!
---
A lot more sliding and contact sounds on the pistol mags sounds really nice.
---
It makes sense. Ubisoft clearly said the use of m&amp;k on console is cheating and it's not allowed natively, so it's not an even ground. What they use is a XIM device to trick the console making it "think" the input is from a controller, hence Ubisoft cannot detect it.
---
I'm saying that console players are mostly casuals, and they don't really care about correct spelling and such things. They just play casually. That's completely fine, I'm not saying that it's not, but what I'm saying it's not false at all.
---
Yeah this may be true but after she killed me i watched the killcam and the headshot did alot of damage because she had barely any health after that she only had like 16 health. So i shot 9 rounds into her and the first one was a headshot but what i dont understand is what the fuck happens to the other 8 because i watches it and at least 3 of the other shot should have hit him but for some reason didn't do any damage
---
The people inside clearly aren't great though
---
Noticed your flair now. Vector army, I see.

The point is that as the **Black Ice** skin is not actually black, a 'Blood Ice' skin would not need to be how blood would indeed look like in ice.

I wasn't negative, I simply stated what was presented to me.  Also, saying that's it's "really creative" is pretty dang condescending when we can all clearly see that he just slapped on an image of a skull to a drawing of Glaz.

I thought IQ and Tachanka get pro league sets next season.

Next to N√∏kk and Warden.

Sometimes you can't get to the other side, and sometimes you need the reinforcement on your side to mount a gadget.

Nope casual

id say just watch a little gameplay &amp; understand the meta. youre a diamond so your adaptability is likely very high, &amp; game sense isnt very volatile. once you understand what has changed since youve played, youll be back to producing @ a high level in no time.

Gotta love copper

That is just sad

Thanks i appreciate a lot

Had a match just like this. It‚Äôs way too common unfortunately.

Devs try, but XIM devs just patch around it. I think Fortnite tried to do this and it lasted for all of two weeks because of how hard to detect XIM is.

I think it was implied she used it to blast the wall at the end though, right?
---
Try shooting it in burst to control you stability
---
Was it not possible to put grips and scopes on the weapons? I can image you had limitation, but since the are high tech spec ops the iron sight, magazine gripping was  such a turn off for me. (or  bit more gadgets, like Concussions or teacher grenades )

Tchankas new buff.

I really do
---
Console problems get console solutions.
---
Nah, I've got no budget but a lot of passion. So I had to improvise by using various animations from the internet as well as extracting stuff from Call of Duty games. It's pain in the ass but it's somewhat worth it.
---
Sweet
---
Im sorry, just your first comment was rude, and i think you should apologize, i just wanted to make a relatable post
---
On rogue 9's damage spreadsheet it is still slightly above average on dps on about par with the vector and the high fire rate means you are putting a lot of round downrange at the person's head which makes it a really effectiv weapon.
---
Gotta love those Fisher Price routers.

It's complicated. It's based on resources I have at my disposal.

Magazine gripping is something that bothers me as well, but I've got like two gun nuts who reassured me that it's kind of correct but not with the guns shown in the video. So I just went with it. I'm just not a military person but I like the aesthetics.

Rip to the acog main

Vigils family having a conversation
---
&gt;Well I said somewhat
---
It's not. Not one bit. Somewhat is an overstatement. You have firing from the sight, one hit wall breaking hammers, insta burn blow torches, instant heal syringes, portable wireless handheld cardiac sensors, and nanomachines. Calling it realistic would mean calling ARMA and insurgency primitive.
---
&gt;just tactical shooter that 10v10 cod and fortnite are way different from siege or cs
---
Yeah and you make it 10v10, A, most gadgets become redundant in that mode, and B, the map sizes are simply too small for that, and C, it would be rush and spawn rush metas, Basically making it fortnite and COD. 5v5 keeps siege as siege.

And yeah that makes a fair amount of sense. And I went and rechecked some of my statements after I posted. It seems ballistic masks are much easier to obtain than I thought. But then again I can't even get Airsoft guns where I live let alone firearm/body protection accessories like that. The variety was nice, it makes a change from whatever they're wearing in game. Like, parkas or something lol.
---
And, off topic slightly, is beer that expensive in the US? And only a single pretzel?? I realise that they're probably much bigger over there but here they come in bags that have like ... Hundreds in them. Like chip packets.

Not the case. The explosion was far too large to be from the Lifeline.

I love that one dude that calls out who you kill like you didn‚Äôt know you killed them

I forgot about Thatcher. What I was thinking was something that disables all cameras in the stage, but that would just make Thatcher irrelevant.
---
if you don‚Äôt use them because of the ACOG then why complain
---
Time really flies doesn‚Äôt it
---
Make Nokk a 3 speed, Capitao 2 speed to slightly balance him. Give Nokk smoke grenades over claymore. 
---
Make Vigil 2 speed and Mozzie 3 speed. Give BOSG ACOG on Dok and Vigil, since they decided 2 speeds can have ACOG on non-automatic weapons now. Mozzie will fit his description as being super energetic, and it‚Äôll make sense since he‚Äôs the shortest male operator in the game. 
---
Yes pls.
---
Yes! It literally just started but now I can‚Äôt even run T hunt
---
I don't think Cav is played much in higher ranks. I main her but don't really see much of her.
---
Yeah I definitely feel for you my man. That sounds like absolute shit to play through
---
But it looks good. It's not about the AMAZING design and effort it's about if you would like to see it in the game.
---
congrats im proud of you babe

Something like that. Mainly his brother, but at that moment he has to defeat the demon king/leader.

I think it‚Äôs one of the coolest looking guns in the game, let alone coolest shotguns.

I got nothing but Windows Defender. Could this be it?

Really? This is fucking shit, i real accidentally kill really few teammates, im new player

An operator who can place 3 pressure sensitive invisible like mat on the ground and detects the attackers position in an outline for 3 seconds; if stepped on. It can only be seen with special glasses that only the operator wielding it can do so. The mat gives away your location, the same way Alibi's tracking works. It also can be shot like Frost's mat.
---
Yes i think a teamkill
---
This is exactly the point of my [parody.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cxl0ak/yellow_snow_skin_concept_because_primary_colors/) Thank you. I've been looking for this comment.

True
---
Its an xbox core live service issue. For future reference, go to settings&gt;network&gt;network settings and it will tell you in the middle there.
---
Yep, search online a guide in how to whitelist some files and do it with siege.
---
That's why i specified "gun design". As a weapon itself - it's an absolute shredder, that i have a slight feeling will be nerfed at some point.
---
YES YES YES YES YES

I like the design

Oh. Did I hear you wanted [more of the same?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cxl0ak/yellow_snow_skin_concept_because_primary_colors/)

Yeah thanks for the tips I rarely join partys anyway but you got a point people with lower rank are usually better the MM and the placement games are not really fair one game against esports players amd then the other against people who just started

Yes it is unfortunately, it‚Äôs upsetting. You can mute everyone and it‚Äôs still not enough. ie someone teamkills you for no reason and then his buddy will teamkill you

You will.  No sugarcoating it.  There is a very steep learning curve to this game.  The low TTK, destructability, and lack of aim assist or respawns makes for a very unforgiving experience.  You will get shot from places you didn't know you could get shot a lot.  Over time, that will happen less, but it will never completely go away (you see it even in pro league).  You'll learn these places and use them yourself and learn to counter them (using your drone to figure out which of the many options are being used this round, clearing from above/below, prefiring those spots or just avoiding them).
---
But R6 is worth putting in the time and effort.  Perhaps because of that learning curve, improvement feels earned and worthwhile.  And matches between evenly matched teems are so much fun.
---
Yea lol. Tempted to buy this game but if this happen more than not then i dunoooo
---
You can easily get banned if you keep doing it you have to pay attention to where your team is so you don‚Äôt load rounds into them on accident
---
Okay
---
It‚Äôs a combat shotgun. Even Cav‚Äôs has a similar design
---
If you team kill too much the worst you will get is a 30 min ban. After that it increases if you continue to do so. Just watch out for your team mates and you should be good.
---
I once got team-killed in the middle of a ranked match because I didn't have an Elite Skin when the other 4 picked theirs ...  fun times.
---
Negative Captain =(
---
who said i was a guy?
---
okay
---
Yeah, same probs with Siege on xbox
---
To this point, you‚Äôd have to bring all three hard breaches which fucks over the attacking team comp, cause then you have to make a decision of only 2 other operators. Depending on the site, it would have to be thatcher, so that leaves 1 op to run counter strats with. Again, not the best idea imo.
---
F
---
are you actually serious..
---
Is it just Xbox?
---
At first I thought this was going to be a clip of someone repeatedly trying to smash open hard walls.
---
Is that an information worth mentioning?
---
All it takes is knowledge of time, space, gravity and the (non) presence of an ADS.
---
Nice almost nonexistent nose
---
Idk mate
---
coastline is basically villa
---
This should be a custom game mode. One player is Sledge, one player is clash (defending her brood), the rest can only crawl and have to get from one side of the map to the other without getting smashed.
---
Your gt is magicded on PC right? Cuz that has less than 1000 hours on it.
---
Either that or a breach charge
---
Just look at this thread. Theres a few that said they would and people on siege seem to like to be a dick as quick as possible. Theres also a larger console community so less dedicated dickheads can screw up your day.

Back in grim sky they used to sell 32000 R6 credits and 600 extra if u were nice for 32 euros in Western Europe, without a limit, I bought their pack twice because i had the starter edition back then so i waste mostly of my R6 money on the characters and the other 32000 pack on the elites that were available back in Grim Sky, i think they had some problems in Burnt Horizont with their system, maybe ubi improved their security, if u want i can show u the tickets xtmmo gave me.

steam version and uplay version are 2 separate versions. so you need 2 downloads of the game installed.
---
Dang you got it before me

sorry, because you constantly post ‚Äústop banning blitz,‚Äù your opinion is invalid

Yeah, like a story mode, or even a multiplayer where it's rainbow operators against terrorists but the defending team play as terrorists instead of the defending ops

Does the HD texture pack really make much of a difference? I only just switched to PC a week ago and am kind of annoyed the game is almost 100 GB when I only have a 500 GB ssd.

Thanks for the warning about the scream.

---
I love how n√∏kk is now just pool monster
---
Ok thanks
---
One thing many people suggested over the years is, a stray driven co-op about white masks. Seriously at this point majority of the playerbase forget about them
---
You should have made another steam account and bought it off there, that way it would have recognized that you already have the game installed. Since you have it on Uplay now, It does not recognize the steam download file of the game, which means you have to redownload the game again on the Uplay platform.
---
I warm up in t hunt for like 25~30 minutes each day before ranked. I find this as an aim practice device way more efficient than casual, theres more enemies, faster games, and it's easier to hit headshots on them. I do wish I could make my own custom aim training like you can in csgo through the use of workshop maps but that is quite unlikely

Yeah me too, lots from what I'm assuming is MW2. Well made though!

Cursed video
---
r6s directional sound just isn't amazing by default, you shouldn't play this game in 7.1 mode. 
---
I had tested the game on AUDIO-TECHNICA ATH-M40X / Logitech G PRO X GAMING ( 7.1)  and SENNHEISER HD4.50

and honestly the last one wins by huge amount just because it's stereo and no 7.1

You know what happened? They made a full story campaign, packaged it up and are selling it as the new Quarantine game. Still gonna buy it tho, worst case scenario it's just better aiming practice than T-hunt

The Ash elite is just the rattlesnake or whatever snake name right?

Never got more then 1 teammate

Can you not see it?, it's behind the blurry picture

I noticed this game was only 4.99 on the EPIC store and I ventured to buy it but then when I scrolled down they‚Äôve got these different packages with years worth of heroes. Is it too late to pick this game up and is there a massive difference for the 4.99 one and the 49.99 one? Can I unlock heroes in game?
---
god they are even backseat gaming him
---
was exploring some old clips yesterday and one of them was this

Lesion is more punishing for longer games. He has good weapons. I personally think clash purely sucks and not really good overall

hmm, I see it more on rook than doc

Not when they're holding an angle

it's possible in few cases :

* When someone doesn't have any operators

* When someone didn't pick any operator

ROASTED TOASTED PACKAGED UP AND POSTED

Start playing T hunt on the maps you find yourself playing more often, if you like playing ranked I would only play bomb on cas. If you want to learn to drag more play capture and if you‚Äôre with your boys or want to learn good starts play hostage
---
Damn. I've played 2 rankeds against the same guy, and I've actually managed to win one of these. Shield in corner is the strat to go. He will teleport towards you and he'll either fall off the map or you can hipfire him. Dumbass hacker has his aimbot on and only shoots to my head, not my gun.
---
Depends. Do you want Good gameplay or cancer gameplay?
---
now do gold
---
I've been told by friends it's a waste of space. Game looks good without it.
---
If you play with a squad get Clash, other then that get Lesion as he is more universal.
---
The average engagement distance in r6 is 9-15 meters and depending on the armor type, most full auto rifles will take the same shots to kill as DMR's.

I see, that is indeed unlucky. Those unranked are wildcards, the system doesn‚Äôt know where to place hem so they end up backfilling in ranked games. Your best bet would be to play in a 5 stack. (Btw particularly odd this late in the season to have three unranked on one team)

I only have one friend who still plays siege (the one in the photo) so getting a five stack would be hard unless I find people on discord, where in that case I don‚Äôt really like playing with people I don‚Äôt know since I don‚Äôt know what to expect of them. And I was also wondering just like you why tf they were still unranked. I don‚Äôt play often lately because I‚Äôve grown tired of the game but come on, even I‚Äôm ranked. My guess is that they just hit a high enough level to play.
