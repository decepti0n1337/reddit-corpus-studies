I mean considering they presumably changed their name to avoid the ban on the correct spelling, I think it's reasonable to ban for evading the rules alone

Did you kill the smoke?
---
teach him the importance of visibility. I remember when I was beginning, and event still some times now because of the camera change, that I thought I was *barely* sticking out and then I'd die to the angle I was peeking and I'd rewatch the killcam just to find out that half of my body was sticking out lol. you learn to hold angles from farther back so your body doesn't stick out past the corner, and hold them as tightly as you can instead of like at the middle of the door/window or whatever
---
I noticed it happens whenever I go from showdown to ranked. A fix is to just reset your game that's usually does it for me everytime.

I‚Äôd say 3rd best Defense weapon.

Not really a fix, more of a work around, but do you have a problem with full screen windowed?

Give it some time to update, maybe 30-60 minutes

I'm glad to see everyone agrees so far
---
Don‚Äôt worry no one will be accusing you of it.
---
Yeah it gets like that, when unable to callout the name of the room a good ping always does the job and just describing wht they are doing is usually enough to satisfy my friends. And yeah i agree its just behind sledge-hammering someone for most satisfying ways to kill people.

at least we could probs buy it this year with renown like we could the last year's skins

Yeah we just get ddosers.

Ooh they should make sledge able to fly too

**siege turns into a game where the highest level players throw hammers at each other**
---
Its clear irony.
---
A sneaky Sledge can be as scary as Caviera and N√∏kk, change my mind

Probably cause no one will use them on the good ones cause there‚Äôs already better skins

I posted something like this when Hibanas elite came out,but people apparently didn‚Äôt notice the priceü§£

Because they r banning for a thing that had to be typed in game chat console doesn‚Äôt have a game text chat

For Honor has the same thing, but you don't get anything for doing it and it's a simple stat system at the end of match scoreboard... Easy to implement into r6

God that would be so cool to have it back. But it did block more of the screen

It worked thank you.

The only difference between gridlock and caveira is that gridlock is 5x easier to hear

Lol sure you would. Are you The Mountain?
---
Because Kix is a guzzler for this game and his job is basically to say everything's good. Ask KingGeorge, you know the no.1 streamer, about facing people with high ping. It's well known because when anyone faces a pinger it's always a bad time, ask someone with normal ping. Why does everyone with high ping pick a 3 speed and sprint everywhere? Why are they always peeking? They know exactly what they're doing.

Nuclear flavored.

Ubisoft is a business, they raised the prices for a reason

goodness gracious

Let me correct you ‚ÄúBest Legendary if the Season‚Äù

That‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt have that one, and my main is Monty, so I have plenty of pistol kills, just no aces since they added the new achievements
---
and Cav
---
yeah but his pullout game weak so he doesn't deserve it.
---
I hate spawn peeks but at the same time I'll allow it because they were oblivious and just ran into it lmao
---
The most genuine answer I can give without it being a meme is that it‚Äôs just a bad room to defend in, 1. There‚Äôs very little cover, 2. it‚Äôs got multiple access points for attacker‚Äôs that reduces the chances of defenders being able to even hold it without going into another room.  3. If you do reinforce it, you forcing you and your team to funnel into one doorway which isn‚Äôt really good
---
Can we talk about that recoil control?
---
or a j√§ger main
---
If i'm rocking with a full squad she's usually my go to whenever she doesn't get banned. Just too much of an advantage, especially when you have a full squad who can communicate and coordinate flanks and shit.

Don't like it? Bring a Capitao boi

It doesn't have to for the statement you replied to be true.

I find it funny no one has said anything about you going our lord and saver tachanka

It's just one of those days where you don't wanna wake up

Everything is dark and everybody sucks

Interesting

I think this is a game or Xbox problem

Even for attackers? I know there are a lot on defense, but thought it‚Äôd be cool for attackers
---
Wait there's something there?
---
Alot
---
The enemy hurt itself in its confusion
---
You‚Äôd have insane recoil though
---
Same problem!
---
Is this meant to be a skin for siege or a concept to have dokkaebi as a character in watchdogs
---
Sometimes even when it tells you you have low ping, you still lag
---
That's not how games work
---
Oh you know that? In the 18 countries of the Middle East, which are rich countries and there is a lot of American and European military forces in those countries, have security problem to install the servers???  Why insist on your irrational words that are not real?
---
When Jackal is banned, Tom Brady with a Beard is the next best option.
---
Are you implying Warden is your waifu?
---
She literally just defeated my 5 push. Couldn‚Äôt flank her cause all she had to was walk across obj and BOOM she‚Äôs at the flank route.
---
Well how come I lag my ass off and have very bad input lag even when it's at 9 ping?

hah console pleb

Shields have had this problem pretty much since the game started. Somewhere around Operation Health they made shoes more consistent, but shit like what you were talking about still happens, just not as much.
---
IMO, they should tweak shields a little more. Using them isn't all that fun and fighting against them can be frustrating.

I've been soloing most of this season, I'm stuck at Gold 1 atm, keep going to G2 then back to G1 but hey if I get lucky

I do as of 5 min after this pic

Tbh it‚Äôs probably a glued rail then put it on.
---
100% deserved for playing Jackal.
---
We are on year 4. How is this suspicious?  People know the player hight by now. And even with new players, shooting through a window that you just got shot through and getting a kill is the norm in this game.
---
And its also already in the game as the reflex sight

Ranked is the best way imo. If you refuse to play ranked then I think if you get really good at a specific t-hunt mission you can rig the settings to get the same map and mode and speed run it. But that's kinda annoying. I saw a guide on YouTube for it but I never attempted it.

It took 12 hours and I somehow did it in one day. Was it worth it? I'm not sure yet.

Like the other users comment, you can buy bundles but I don‚Äôt really know how because I already have all the ops, but at least on pc you can buy the other year season pass on steam, I don‚Äôt know if you can buy it on Uplay
---
For best results, shut it down, let it sit for about 5 or 10 minutes, then make the change and save it, then start it up. Wait 5 or 10 again. Then try to check it in game.
---
house on normal w/ classic t-hunt. average about 30-60 renown OR you can bring a friend for one round and then he can leave and the game thinks he is there the whole time and you'll get 100+ renown each time. just play ash or someone fast and it's ez renwon.
---
Ok, on house don‚Äôt reinforce kids room or living room,  and if you‚Äôre put into Master bedroom or garage, reinforce the Garage doors (they count as soft walls) and keep an eye on weight room and outside (if you‚Äôve got a Mira on your team of course) and as for master, unless it‚Äôs bomb reinforce closet and the other walls in master bedroom

That‚Äôs just casual in general. Ranked is much more chill because there aren‚Äôt as many people that rush and pretend this game is Call of Duty. Plus there isn‚Äôt any vote to kick in ranked.

SAAAAME. I just played a ranked match on PS4 and Slammedwifi (siammedwifi) was lagging the match out.  They won there three on defense then got s Monty into a corner and planted then turned the lag back on.     Fuck all you cheating pieces of shit that does these things. You benefit no one, not even yourselves.

Nothing against your playstyle. Just find it weird that you're complaining

Holocaust joke in 2019 yes haha very very funny

iirc you dont get a death stat if you survive the round so therefore technically possible but highly improbable

I have no issues, but I don't have any issues with the reflex either. Took me some 400 hours but I now know exactly where it lands.

Besides, sight versatility is never allowed in siege because everything is meant to have pros and cons. Pros of reflex- small blindspot wide fov, cons being fat reticle that takes a while to master.

Vote to kick just needs to be removed at this point.  Reverse friendly fire pretty much negates the need for it.

The fact that it's a Doc makes your side much stronger. Finishing off someone who can get themselves back up at any moment /should/ be more of a priority than your teammate getting a +1 beside their name.

Kill Stealing is bs in a game where your own personal score doesn't matter, all that matters are the dubs

Man me too. It was so fun and goofy.
---
People like the easy way out, eh?
---
Lmao i was on when this guy got banned
---
theres probably way more than just one. This game is filled to the fucking brim with edgy children.
---
It may be bad for people maining Echo, Jackal or Cav but give it a season or two and things will even out. Low ranks will still ban the above ops because they can't counter them, but eventually people will adapt. Pickban was a good decision and it brings much needed variety to ranked.
---
You don't watch PL, do you?
---
Cap, Finka, GL, zofia, even IQ's LMGs are used. Because they can handle the 600 ms time, making everything else about it seem like a disadvantage. Hell, joystick uses cap now, with lmg.
---
LMGs are in a good spot right now. Yes, destruction buff is a good qol change, but they don't need any strat buffs.

Maybe look through the thread instead of posting this for the 1000000th time

i think the pistol is the best part hahahahah

Thx

That‚Äôs pretty funny

That‚Äôs his only use because otherwise his gadget is just not viable in any normal circumstances. Yes Warden and Glaz have to stand still for their gadgets to work but at least they aren‚Äôt literally locked into a specific position with restrictive movements dictated by their gadget like Tachanka is.
---
I do this but with finka instead bc boost
---
Ur bad at game
---
Nah. Smoke
---
This is too far!
---
It's not hitreg it's ping and how you play the game. You need to learn how to use ping to your advantage and how it disadvantages you. If you want to win the gunfight you need to push them. Not when they're holding a tight angle though, that can end in a loss.

Alright, thanks.
---
Sounds like somebody doesn‚Äôt know how to play Lord Chank to his full potential
---
What songs did you use?
---
Fuck dude me too, then the server got dossed and my game crashed. When I logged back in, the changes I had made to my disappeared loadouts were reverted. Gotta pay the troll toll
---
Atleast the bottom guys got the sense to hide their faces so Mama doesn‚Äôt know what their upto Cause their Mama would take their M870 if she saw what they were doing to that poor Spec Ops girl.
---
Wait this is actually sounds like a good character. J√§ger Corps defensive operator ??
---
Oh I had audio off I apologise.
---
I'll give laser sights a pass since I saw someone using red dot suppressor the other day. Never have I had so much anger
---
Recruit
---
So many of my teammates  don‚Äôt realize foot steps are heatmapped (hot/red= fresh tracks)
---
Honestly it seems like it‚Äôs happening more and more.
---
It's honestly just sad at this point, I don't even know why he suddenly became a god
---
An Lmg, pecheneg or capitao with m249.
---
Last Season the min Rabk was 20 and this Season it changed to Rank 30+. 
---
So this guy is a smurf from last Season and kept his K/D and W/L even though he can‚Äôt technically play Ranked yet this Season.
---
Yeah, but the challenge is celebrating France as a whole, not the GIGN specifically.
---
and even if it were, he' still apart of the GIGN anyway.
---
Really? Can‚Äôt tell if you are memeing or not. Because I‚Äôve played my fair share of Tachanka and he is by no means viable and literally any other operator would bring a whole lot more to the table.

Holo because I've basically never seen anyone use anything else in pro league. Plus it doesn't have a massive blind spot and you know where the bullet is going to go (the tiny circle in the middle)

I have gotten l8 black ice countless times even though I have fanatic pro league set that I like more so this ain‚Äôt new to me

Thanks!

Worth it tho

Say that to r/yasuomains
---
Kapkan. It gives you an unfair competitive advantage. The traps aren't silver anymore and are instead brown and smaller meaning harder to see meaning less ankles on the enemy team.
---
Good to see Xbox on here
---
literally unplayable
---
I'd say a defender, but I'm not sure which one since I don't know your playstyle
---
Why is it dangerous? Genuinely curious.
---
Getting killed outside the building =/= spawnpeek.
---
Also they just said that they minimizes the number of spawnpeeks so that it wasn't bartlette
---
Gridlock is overlooked a lot but she‚Äôs been growing on me. Her ACOG on her lmg is one of the best sights in the game. And her gadget is great for countering roamers or locking down your area, she‚Äôs similar to Lesion because more than anything it will alert you if someone is behind you. Either because they have to destroy her webs or walk through them which gives an audio cue. Pair her up with Nomad and you can lock down whole areas. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot of potential with Nokk if she‚Äôs used correctly. A lot of people use her as a fragger, but I see her more of a support. She‚Äôs great for watching over your breachers. For example Thermite placing a charge, or Maverick opening a hole and Cav/Valk sitting nearby sees them on cams and think they got an easy kill because their back is turned. Except there Nokk is waiting for that peak and was never seen on the camera. Plus she‚Äôs great for defending the defused because most people check cams and see the defuser is unprotected and rush in, and again there she is just waiting.
---
I didnt have to pay $10 lol
---
Is the theme park drug lab one still there where you can get on top of the arcade machine?
---
When did they removed the no memes rule?
---
Not sure what I just watched, but 10 out of 10 not enough Nomad.
---
But I will lol
---
I respect you
---
I got kicked from the Kafe game and was suspended for like 10 remaining minutes. I played 1 casual game, then tried Ranked again.
---
I got reconnected to the Kafe game to play the final round after a 4-4 tie. We won.
---
-pengu
---
I respect the bit where you revived that Sledge just to kill him again. Sometimes you just gotta put the kids in they place.
---
Hell, if this the way to get Ubi listen and fix this issue I‚Äôll beg right along side you.
---
Ya I'm still playing and nothing. They're just bugged for the time being.
---
Let them do what they want on that game mode lol we need those headshots
---
You have been banned for having fun
---
Holy shit your right won a round from the outside
---
Reset the game, don‚Äôt redo them, I made that mistake and wasted half an hour
---
Yeah, after I played a few games of showdown and went back to both casual and ranked, I lost my entire loadout. Came back the next tho.
---
Good for you then dude sucks about not getting plat tho I‚Äôll try using this
---
I play on ps4 and ive had the same problem i  just restarted my game completely and my loudouts went back to normal
---
Yeah so its prob Showdown
---
I mean the best solution for this is have your own team of friends to play with and you won't have a problem
---
Except he's Kapkan. Close though.
---
Yeah, getting better at attacking any map can help increase your chances of winning overall. I have this idea that every map is defender favored if the attacking team allows it. The only maps that I still struggle with and it‚Äôs mainly because they have aged badly and aren‚Äôt balanced for the current game are Chalet and Skyscraper.
---
Either I'm missing something or this is photoshopped, cause I don't think you can have spaces in usernames
---
You're breathtaking

---
Well idk about pc but you can on xbox

---
Now go use that motivation for good!

&gt; something a top tier Special Forces member would do

ahhh sure...
---
Which they also held wrong
---
IQ can point out lesion mines lol
---
The good news is she was only there for a second
---
You‚Äôve been spotted
---
Realism, if you held your Sterling like this you would damage the gun pretty badly
---
Always good having a smartass like you coming up with original answers! now if i look at your stats things would be completely different.
---
I just go for kills on skyscraper since the defenders objectives are really good just run buck and frag the guy that‚Äôs holding gacia then push through there
---
Every day at work i kill the camera's. Can't risk being pinged as i make my way to the objective. Sadly i have been forbidden to kill any more process operators :(
---
Lol
---
\*clears throat from the overuse of "no you're breathtaking!" responses\* NO YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!
---
I love how she is just standing there almost like she is saying "Hey buddy. Whats up." and then she just offs you hitman style
---
Don‚Äôt like being pricked eh?
---
Thatcher can destroy them all in a single emp
---
Yeah im sure your limited mute jammers with area of effect radius of 2m is gonna directly counter Jacka. lol.   not every complain is crying! learn to know which is which.  Jackal is annoying and has a global ability against you even if you did nothing wrong. that is just fact, you like it or not.
---
Derpy Soviet indeed
---
I like the individuality you can have
---
this is the coolest video ive ever seen on reddit. good job!
---
This happens to me all the time.
---
You destroyed one of the defenders‚Äô dropped phones, thus preventing your friendly Dokkaebi from hacking it.
---
I can't read this the capitalization is as good as Trump's
---
If you destroy a phone that a defender drops
---
Yeah I just hate that map. If a map forces you into a certain meta like runouts then it‚Äôs certainly not balanced by any means. Nomad usually gets banned on that map for that reason alone. As for both this and Chalet they are just aged to play in general as there is lack of rotations, especially on Chalet, and only 1 arguably two viable sites on both maps.
---
Bro this right here is why I need a wy to trade skins with people
---
Console aiming is so slow wtf.
---
Why would not dying count as a death?
---
Oh, its my ego thats getting boosted? All this time you've been literally patting yourself on the back about 'civility' and how im throwing out logic
---
Look in the mirror.
---
e-sports having a rule set makes it so player created issues are a non factor
---
What did I just watch. Epic video
---
It would be cool to have a payday 2 crossover with ems.
---
People have a trick where they space the letters and type the name of someone else and make it look like they typed it. It's dumb
---
Echo it is then
---
Patting myself on the back huh? I'm calling you a fucking idiot for letting your feelings overflow so easily. Take it easy and try hold back the tears next time.
---
He is covered on over 50% of his body while he is sprinting and his hand is small. Warden is the most situational op in the game and rarely gets picked. I can see your view on the low pick and win rate but the other examples that you gave are dumb.
---
You really should do that they will help you and if not you can ask them to get your money back
---
Its kinda magical you completely skip the line where i said there is a bug where you cant rejoin the match you get kicked off from or the second bug where you get placed on another match. 
---
Also good stuff skipping over the server and player DDoSing issue thats ongoing which has jack to do with how good your internet connection.
---
Whenever I see a cam I feel like I am being spotted
---
Absolutely *breathtaking*
---
There is a common bug where you cant rejoin the match you get kicked off from or the second bug where you get placed on another match.
---
Also again your internet connection wont stop your server from getting DDoSed or People abusing glitches like the castle and chat lag glitches.
---
This is a joke right?
---
Even the kill cam couldnt figure out what happened
---
He's probably a smurf, doing a copper to diamond run or something
---
Every online game is filled to the fucking brim with edgy children, nothing special in R6.
---
You will die in 4 days. Make amends, say your prayers and may god have mercy on your soul.
---
how do people still fall for this lol, a sentence long enough eventually has to go to a second line
---
I mean listen, that shit sucks and everything, but the majority of the time, especially where I play, those issues are rare. It‚Äôs a lot of rage quitting or party leaving and it almost always ends in a loss for that team. I agree they have a lot to fix first, but they definitely need to implement something as well because losing every game with leavers is just as bad as being punished for server issues.
---
I'll spawnpeel your fuckin' scalp off, cunt.
---
my man saying barbed doesn't do much, every blitz player knows, that when you get into that barbed wire, in an 1v1, you're fucked. once when I played blitz, I got stuck in barb, and an opposing rook calmly peeked and shot my shoulders till i was dead, nothing to do for me in that situation. if I uncrouched and tried to go for him, he would've shot my legs before I got even out of the barb, if I tried to shoot him, rook would've shot my head as soon as I ads'd.
---
I know this will make me sound like a non that band him every game, but God being tracked by jackal is so annoying.
---
Irritation, frustrations and annoyances aren't valid and credible reasons to make long lasting and significant changes. You need dats to make such changes. Repeating, recurring data. The former 3 are just personal emotion, ones that are specific to you, and that you can work on to overcome.
---
Blitz needs no changes.

---
He's here to f**k spiders
---
Or.. OR.. OR I KNOW! \_MAKE THE GOD DAMN GADGET OUTLINES NOT BE WHITE\_
---
I'm fairly new to the game, makes sense
---
Most certainly.
---
Warden is the most situational op in the gane with little to no benefit for anyone on the team 90% of the time. His gadget is the ability to not have to turn away from a flash and Glaz but worse. The situation is not the worst but I usually play rook on def. And I use impacts on rotations, which leaves me with one impact that cant kill any full health op. Being the only one on site is a very common occurrence for me in ranked and in cas, people love to leave site to get those sweet frags but leave the one op actually defending without assistance.
---
Ah thank you.
---
It just shows how crap they are at the game, they need to cheat to win
---
Its XBOX

He prefired immediately after leaving the cover and his crosshair the whole time was on me behind the wall. Also there was no drone and i killed his teammate in a different position. This is just 1 clip i recorded but i've seen ppl soft locking others in casual b4

It's absurdist humor which is very very subjective.

That background should be a wallpaper
---
I don't think it's that accurate tbh.
---
I don't play ranked anymore but I was plat 1-diamond when I did. This tool says I'm gold 1.
---
I'm willing to accept that I might not be as good anymore but that's still a tremendous difference.
---
It‚Äôs just part of rainbow sadly, I love the game but the player base is toxic.
---
Agreed with the elo.. Should not be penalised as harsh because a teammate leaves.

The Sterling was in service from 1953-1996...
---
Concussion. Impact damage is reduced if it hits a shield.
---
Concussion.
---
no
---
I normally use it because people complain when I use the mp5 in border patrol.
---
I replied with an article that explains how you should of got the base operators but it got deleted because it doesn‚Äôt allow me to put the link in the comment.
---
Actually the Sterling is post WWII, the Sten, which came before the sterling, was used during WWII. The Sterling was brought into service in 1953 and phased out in 1996.
---
Oh Xbox. You never fail to amaze me.
---
Well you could start by attaching the video
---
I mute everyone when I enter the game period. You cant trust people to not be salty
---
What did I just watch?
---
This is a bit shit because no one wants to remove the feature where you get banned for killing the hostage, but it's also shit that you didn't mean to? Not much I can imagine ubi being able to do about it
---
Shubert must be proud.
---
IQ seeing through smoke
---
The only thing I complained about this was that I got +5 in my rank
---
Impact will do next to no damage against a Clash facing you.
---
removing ff would be a terrible idea

This gives me anxiety
---
Everyone‚Äôs like ‚Äúthe mpx is so bad‚Äù but nobody talks about the m590a1 which was recently buffed to the point where it‚Äôs stronger at long range than the tcsg

Thinking cod is a good game is stupid and shows how dumb you are in general lmao I agree teamkilling is annoying but the common denominator is you my guy

Oof!

I'm about to do what might be called,  a pro gamer move.

---
This is awful
---
To those players that killed me for my ingame name {blacky} i am sorry, once i can i will rename myself to whitey.
---
People in silver dont even know what all the operator gadgets do, and after the changes in ranked, i dont think i can ever reach decent ranks again
---
I personally find the c7e to have one of the easiest to control recoil patterns in the game. Also, *remember, switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading*, it‚Äôs perfectly normal to use your secondary for killing.
---
I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm good. My aim is pretty dick tier but my knowledge of the game is amazing, not to toot my own horn or anything. I duo queue majority with a person who could be diamond if he cared enough about the game. I don‚Äôt care enough to know what rank you are but i can tell you that nobody in gold belongs there for various reasons.
---
I hope they change it to personnel challenge like 100 headshots with BOSG...
---
I already earned 31.
---
I guess if the recoil is really that low I can see it doing something. The average killdistance in siege has been under 10meters for a long time now and the idea of extented barrel = noob noob bad bad is just very rooted in my head.
---
Achievement earned: make a shitpost

And your wrong. That a downvote from me chief

At least that guy gave his tm a warning nothing like an unexpected bullet in the back of the head by your potato aiming tm
---
This is why I stopped playing the game a few weeks after starting. I really enjoyed the gameplay, but stuff like this made half the games I was in a waste of time. I would go through the time of matchmaking, then the character selection and prep phase, only to get shot by a teammate or kicked out.
---
It was all just a big a waste of time. In an hour I would maybe get two matches total where nobody did anything stupid and made the game a waste of time.
---
Great game, but a total waste of time unless you have hours and hours to waste.
---
At least he‚Äôs useful again since deployable shields are back... cuz damn that was one terrible time for Tachanka...
---
Rofl :)) this shit made my day
---
[-]7
---
This is your mind on drugs
---
Very big yes
---
Lol, really
---
Huh. Well I prefer the recoil on the pdw and even got my first ace with that thing. But since it's opinions, I guess everyone here is right.
---
No it‚Äôs also in ranked hence the 100+ win loss
---
I‚Äôve actually had this shotgun come in clutch for me a few times in some bad situations, surprising? Yes
---
Would I rely on it from now on? No
---
I‚Äôm with ya mate
---
Idk but ill let the votes speak and it seems people disagree with you
---
Thank you, I appreciate this!
---
what can we do , my fellow comrade main ? we're being betrayed by our teammates
---
Damn straight, this is needed
---
Lmao okay man thats the half assed reply you came up, with nice one... its easy enough to find my name in the video, you're very wrong though i havent played r6 in a week or two right now im in plat 3, and high  plat 1 last season with like 4400 mmr. Also your comment about the friend you played with came out of nowhere lol. I dont like how i sound in this its making me look arrogant and full of myself like you but to save you making a false assumption about my rank i put it there...
---
What system are you on. Would love to play with you. If you ever get killed for reinforcing a wall... I‚Äôll kill the tk‚Äôer and reinforce that wall in your memory.
---
Reload at that kind of location? Oh no.
---
On behalf of everyone here. I felt that
---
It might be a copy paste answer...But hope it wasn‚Äôt
---
That‚Äôs why I only play ranked. Casual is too toxic for me and I almost instantly get kicked or killed right in the beginning
---
Your not I do the same
---
if i tried to post my tachanka.....
---
One time we loose a round cause a moron drop the diffuseur (i don't know the word in english, i speak about the wallet who can disarm bomb).
---
I said "who is the f**** moron who had do that??"
---
A Kaplan respond to me "you"
---
I kill him for his disrespect and he leave the match.
---
My friend told me that the Kaplan was right, i missclicked and drop the wallet outside.
---
It was funny and sad at the same time. 
---
This was the first and last time i was a moron but hey, who didn't do that one time??

Used to happen to me all the time when my down/up speeds were literally the exact minimum requirements to play the game without rubber banding. Have some old clips kicking around of me clutching a 1v2 with half a pistol clip and a knife. Ducked and weaved my way across the entire objective to kill the last guy. Was glad to get a new internet plan. 
---
In case anyone‚Äôs wondering, 6 mbps down, 350 kbps up.

Was literally just killed 3 times last night on casual and then I joined the enemy teams party to hand them the win at after it was 2v2. Turns out, the first two round kills were because I ‚Äútook their mains.‚Äù The third and final time they TKed, was because he didn‚Äôt realize the teammate I downed was the one who had JUST killed me the round before. Listened to the two idiots ‚Äúexplain‚Äù they‚Äôre reasoning for 5 minutes and when I said that‚Äôs pathetic and unbelievable, one of the 12 year olds said, ‚Äú oh I know I‚Äôm shitty, but I don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs casual.‚Äù

In my last few games i have:
---
Been TK‚Äôd for barricading the wrong door (i was mute and i wasn‚Äôt blocking anyone out or anything)
---
Had a Smoke (who didn‚Äôt use his smokes once the entire match) destroy Rook‚Äôs armour after he had used it. 
---
Been TK‚Äôd for playing Blitz in a Terrorist Hunt (i dislike Blitz but he‚Äôs good for TH‚Äôs)
---
Accidentally TK‚Äôd a salty Maverick (he ran out in front of me) before all his friends verbally abused me and called me trash (luckily my good friend was in the game too so i didn‚Äôt get kicked)
---
Been TK‚Äôd for not moving immediately after the match started (i was coughing)
---
Had the rest of my team run out the front door of House to be killed, leaving me to defend Kid‚Äôs Bedroom (i was kicked when i was killed)
---

All this is just the most recent games, the worst is when you‚Äôre a beginner and you get TK‚Äôd/kicked just because you‚Äôre under level ten, even when you‚Äôre playing casual. Something definitely needs to be done about this as it makes it hard for beginners to get into the game.

I was in a silver match and a teammate said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know callouts, just say left or right‚Äù after I called out that ‚ÄúJager was flanking from Aqua‚Äù while he was in baggage and he died because he didn‚Äôt even react to my call. I‚Äôve never been more done with solo queuing.
---
You mean "my headset is working"*
---
Your percentage goes up more after not getting one when you play in ranked than casual.
---
I wish it was this easy. The moment after the first kill, all 3 of them would instantly headshot me into the 5th dimension with supernatural speed and precision.
---
*uses shotgun on doc*
---
Was this in a 1 v 1?
---
Just... restart the game and it's fixed
---
My first ever game of ranked I had a four stack in my team. In the first round, it goes down to a 2 v 1. My teammate went round for a flank, and we pinched at the same time. He was a Glaz in smoke. I catch a glimpse of his barrel and I spray at it. In the process of doing so I wall-bang my teammate (yes okay I was bad and confused).
---
I then got tked every round after. I don't get it though; surely a bad teammate who messed up the first round, is better than no teammate at all?

I actually started playing before it got extremely popular. Everyone was very nice and helpful to each other. It was very similar to the early days of overwatch when everyone logged in just to have a good time with a team. I love that game is popular, but I hate the community a popular game brings.
---
Lmao wut
---
Take a look at the top very right of his team's icons. Icon outlined in white the players operator
---
Yes and no, it was waaaaaay more competitive in terms of picking ops so there was a lot of salt but the game was very realistic for the most part. I think the DLC starting with year 2 is when it stopped feeling the same (Jackal‚Äôs gadget and Mira getting a secondary shotgun just didn‚Äôt feel like it was in the same vein as everything that we loved)
---
been out since Australian season at least because I seen it on the demo server at the Invitationals
---
Yesterday I tested every shotgun in the game. They all have 8 pellets except the revolver shotgun (4) and slug shotguns

I‚Äôd rather a drone be killed than mute just forget about it, the jammer broken, and the drone used later on

I think you haven't though about the balance issues of having a melee weapon as a secondary. He can duel wield with his secondary and knife, then what? He'll be unstoppable when combined with his stable server connection.
---
As I said anything after prep phase is fair game but usually when people play mute and place the jammers they intend to stop the drones

No. Our team got wiped without any of them dying.

Yeah siege community is soo toxic. I‚Äòm getting teamkilled and vote kicked cause I‚Äòm a girl playing r6, so annoying. I just want to play and have fun.
---
yeah my dude that was me üòÇ
---
also what map were we playing? border? fortress? I completely forgotüíÄ
---
I like the idea of new ops and longevity but.... Thew "sci-fi" ops I could live without.
---
I'd say mute is better for breach denial, and mozzie for drone denial.
---
Maybe they could add a noob-friendly super casual mode where team damage hurts you too, you only get so many tk's per day in that mode (minus a forgive system), and setup gets more time for experimenting with gear and planning.
---
It was border
---
I get that all the time. I‚Äôve received a vote to kick for not clutching a 1 v 4, for having a mic, and for simply just joining the game.... There is a good chunk of the console community that‚Äôs become so toxic it‚Äôs unbearable.

I got into a match and one teammate said he wanted to ace, so the rest of the team and I wished him luck. I went nokk and rushed in and got killed by a frost after taking 50 health from her. My teammate said, "hey pk let's review that play, shall we?" And then the votekick prompt came up and the last thing I heard was, "no, let's not"
---
your not alone too
---
We all float down here...
---
Mira and Jackal definitely changed the meta, I did enjoy them now but I'd love to maybe see a "classic" gameplay mode? With just the original ops?
---
Drone kill steal? It‚Äôs like 10 points for destroying a drone? Who cares
---
100% ... doesn't even remotely look the same!
---
that works mainly if the shield player is incompetent.
---
I agree. A few new ops are okay but there‚Äôs just getting to be too many now I think
---
Oh no my 10 points! How will I go on knowing the only way I feel I can contribute is by killing drones!

Eh, typing in chat usually works in the lower ranks, even if it's an obvious disadvantage with the delay, but you should be aware that some people turn text chat off as to not be distracted by it. Personally, I don't use a mic when solo queuing because I don't want to get harassed, and I only think it becomes an issue when you start going into plat; Comms are absolutely a match deciding factor at high plat-diamond. But in the lower ranks, the main issue usually isn't communication or lack of thereof, but rather people's game sense, aim and being able to hold their own.
---
I'd just recommend you to keep playing ranked and practice. It's a different pace than in casual and it's something you need to get used to. Don't be scared of it, we've all been there and the rank resets later anyway. I'd also recommend you to find at least someone to squad up with, maybe over on r/r6steams? Even if you don't want to talk even in a group of people you know, it's just easier to play when you don't have to worry about throwers, people going stupid ops, getting toxic or whatnot.
---
Both could do with being taken out that would honestly make the ranked map pool so so much better imo
---
no body said you should do that. Just stating the obvious fact that youll get plat 10 times easier as 5stack
---
Im pretty sure my dad used baet me with that belt too.

I love it. Next blits plz.

---
My favorite is when you‚Äôre leading the team overall. The whole team does fast and then try and vote to kick me or team kill me next round if I don‚Äôt clutch up a 1v5.  Even the times I have clutched up I have been voted to be kicked or team killed.  Toxic is putting it very lightly at this point.
---
It works for me but I get tired of the sweatiness so I usually take breaks, but everyone i meet on ranked are usually somewhat civilized, at least they dont tk
---
How is fortress the second best compared to map like bank, coastline or new kafe? It is way too big and clustered and the corridor layout is awful for attackers.
---
Mate a smoke elite was leaked a while back

What did you say?

I'm pc. But it seams Xbox is worse since it's free to create a new account.

Pc they have to buy a new account. After every sale there's crazy good lvl 10 guys dominating matchs.

Yeah you can see they are in a game by themselves

Brotha I played you on fortress a couple days back lol you guys took us out 5-4. Tried being sneaky the last round and flanking and you knifed me for the dub

I don't think you can claim sarcasm when you've already used the steaming emoji. Makes people think you're genuinely mad about something

Thats basically any online game.
---
Well I didn‚Äôt add the red face angry emoji for a reason.
---
No, we aren‚Äôt as sweaty as PC, but not this bad, they were just garbage
---
You basically have to play with a squad of close friends at this point or the game is almost unplayable. Otherwise everyone will take turns tking you or will vote kick you for no reason.
---
Are you a true J√§gar main if you don't have the Skull head gear?
---
Wtf is /s
---
Vigil and N√∏kks ability to turn invisible for a camera is realistic?
---
Such behavior is just as toxic in ranked imo. You're placed in a team of 5 and your objective is to win, it's alot harder to do so without callouts on enemy positions etc.
---
I can‚Äôt find any, can you tell me some please
---
Actually....yes, it's totally possible.
---
And like 50% are, if not more.
---
Takes hanging back and observing how they play for a minute, before deciding what the best attack plan would be

Really, that makes more sense.

I agree that the corridor layout isn't the best, but this map is not big, and quite simple is you have the layout in your head, the only 2 big maps in this game are theme park and the new hereford since they have too many small rooms with no purpose, and both of them have much worse corridors
---
Why you should always drone before rushing in

You playin on Xbox?

Damn dude :( this is the kinda stuff that makes me wary about venturing into comp

My brother had the xbox locked up tight. And it was up to mommy to set it rightüòèüòé

Just looked at it, goly gosh

It‚Äôs just game logic.  If we have gadgets that show holographic images of people, cameras that shoot laser, visors that highlight people and intend of interest, watches that make you invisible to cameras, drones that scan your placement, then one lady with a knife üî™ isn‚Äôt so unreasonable compared to the ‚Äúrealism‚Äù of the rest. I‚Äôve been saying we might as well have a totally 100% cloaking unit. Hell, just make a time traveling operator.

Those people are never going to learn from that so you're both wasting your time and everyone else in the match. Besides when you're solo queuing like OP 3 and 4 stacks can just constantly TK you or at least do tons of damage. Just ignore them, it's a reaction that they're looking for.
---
And there are holograms and a drone that detects lads walking but not standing still, oh and a device that makes the user invisible to All cameras
---
Played them last game perhaps?
---
Good commentary on the problems in the Siege community, but passive-aggressive is not a look that suits you. Or anyone, really.
---
Wtf have I just witnessed?
---
What? I'm the one that can tell that you're on pc. It was someone else that couldn't
---
Nah. When I'm being boosted, I end up with very few kills because my teammates kill everyone and I just kinda exist.
---
I don't think anyone is arguing against that.
---
it's pretty commonly accepted that:
---
PC games have low skill floor for aiming and medium skill ceiling for aiming
---
Consoles games have medium skill floor for aiming and high skill ceiling for aiming
---
but even a medium skill PC gamer will beat a high skill console gamer in a flick battle
---
Didn't reinforce before going to other side of map.
---
Oh you poor bastard
---
You also get to pay to play online, which is free on PC and when a new console comes out that's another bite, where you PC will be much more resilient to changes. So if you play long enough, say 2 playstation generations, you eventually lose money.
---
Initial startup is definitely much cheaper on console, but if you have the means to buy a PC, it will save you money in other ways.
---
And that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs its for. The more advanced stuff, people will learn for dry runs, PL games, or killcams lol. Just to give more players a fighting chance, and so teammates aren‚Äôt almost always clueless. But idk, I‚Äôd like to see it, even though Siege is very complex in nature.
---
what other things do you find funny?
---
Gridlock cant see where her stuff is placed and when someone hits it.
---
You mean lesion.
---
And for the request, no, that would be way to OP, especially with the FO-12.
---
Thats sweeeet
---
You missed every shot.
---
&gt;bit even a medium skill PC gamer will beat a high skill console gamer in a flick battle
---
Absolutely no argument against that, completely fact. 
---
I just don't understand why there's so much hate against console aim when it's a much harder road to get good at then the people hating on it have/had.
---
I was like ‚ÄúOh shit he has a gun‚Äù but then I realized they just gave Valks smg to someone else.
---
yeah but It all goes to shit with K&amp;M in console, I know there is hardcore 100% sensitivity on console controllers, you can see that they are good, they way they move is not hard to detect, but they are not that many. Hell, Today I saw how the game technique changed against the rival team, we were smoking them and later on the last winning round the game was flipped, suddenly 2 players where able to move like ninjas.....didn't make sense. I hate to not being able to play on an even base. On PC, full of hackers FULL OF THEM and in Consoles the M&amp;K fools. I know its just a a game, But I want to succeed and reach Diamond.
---
I‚Äôll get one too !

wheeze this isnt a balance

I had already messaged the mods since it is on a Twitch clip. I was told it was fine to post since it wasn't my channel, but still my gameplay. I also apologize for the noise.

No, he wasn't nerfed into the dirt. He was nerfed because it made Glaz unintentially powerful, and they reworked his gadget so the developers could make Glaz be what they intended him to be, which was a sniper.

That's.. that's not how time works.

That's totally a myth. My gaming PC was 950 USD with the cost of monitor (Facebook Marketplace), keyboard &amp; mouse (got them on a special), the computer itself, AND a gaming headset. It's got specs good enough to run R6 on high at over 70fps. Shop right and it's not that expensive. Oh my desk and chair were another 70 dollars.  
---
Considering most people buy the Playstation for 400, then another 70-140 on the headset, then another 400-1200 on the TV depending on size and if new or used I really don't think PC gaming is that much more expensive. People hear the hardcore PC dude talk about how they spent 4k on their quadruple GTX Titan build and get intimidated when in reality cost are no where near that.
---
Yet he does the same damage as a pistol
---
Restart the game.
---
I don't think he'd have said it arrived if he wasn't, ordering it. I think he just means the best shirt he owns. Or it's gibberish and this is an Ad. Either way.
---
Bold of you to assume most Blitz mains use their pistol unless they absolutely have to.
---
Bruh chalet sucks. Like hands down it is one of the most unbalanced maps in ranked. It's basically kanal with some alterations. Also Outback isvcool but not a good ranked map. It's very prebuff club house.
---
Outbreak was 1.5 years ago
---
Zofia is also one of my favorites. Just overall very useful and her guns are good
---
The confidence in which you speak on this matter makes me think that you might be the asshole. The counter to toxicity is not more toxicity it's reporting the guy and reloading a new match with (hopefully) less shitty teammates.

No worries! Side note, her AR is kind of meh, I personally love the Spetsnaz LMG (she also uses it) and run it every time I play Fuze. Would recommend it over the AR, but try them both out.
---
At point blank it one hits. It‚Äôs bad and does no damage because damage drop off is absolutely nightmarish

Next a Kaplan cosplay?

Why not Chalet, and why Hereford and Fortress?

Change it then click on the top left and save it.

You got the pimp daddy deagle? That thing is sweet
---
Almost none of these are tk worthy, why are people such douches
---
Yea it is but it's more frequent in casual since that's the mode most people goof around in or are more salty in. Most of my favorite matches are ranked because that's were I have met less salty players.
---
416 C is like an M4 but with G36 internals. And the pistol is a USP 45.
---
My first time ever playing Thermite I got a kill with a charge. It was like my fourth kill ever, so I was happy
---
1)  if they want to peek, but stay and die, I'm more than ok with it.  It's the people that won't board up, punch a peek hole thru a wall or board but that leave their post that get me.  They always argue like they know best, but if you're going to not board up or want to look out a window, fine, if you die. I see it and will know to watch my back, but when you leave it unattended - that's a big no in my book.  If you leave it unattended, I will reinforce or board it if possible when you leave.  
---
3). As a plat who gets shit on for losing a match 3-2 while being 9-2-2, I totally understand why people have second accounts.  However having a second account just to outplay and smash people is weak af.
---
4) this one gets me.  The best you can hope for is getting new teammates that don't leave and you turn it around.
---
Holy crap, 2000 hours?
---
Well, at least she has experience. Thats always a plus
---
My friend and I dont play ranked but we also dont take casual super seriously and we definitely would never take our frustration out on others. We dont run into team killers often and for whatever reason my friend gets targeted but since i dont join in they end up going after me once they realize we are a 2 stack.

Uhhh don't even know why that's a thing

You're not the only one, I saved up for like a year to buy 50 alpha packs and got ~50% duplicates and not a single legendary.

The link you provided is completely useless mate
---
I solo queued up to plat 2. Still am plat 2.
---
I want to know how many players there are so I can understand how being that high is possible.
---
Ubisoft sends this email
---
Oh.
---
Well I like maestro and mozzie so fuck you
---
So... are you sure you don't care?
---
\- yep
---
ok...
---
\-but seriously... i really don't care.. like at all
---
But.. I love Echo!
---
Chalet isn't terrible in my opinion but I wouldn't mind if they removed it, fortress and Hereford are both boring maps, I personally don't enjoy playing on either and I know alot of people feel the same way
---
I played plat last season and i maintained it for a long time
---
Mom come pick me up I‚Äôm scared
---
Scorpion will basically melt enemies, idk if you are on console or pc, but with a mouse I have no problem to control its recoil.
---
What are your multiple reasons for not having a mic
---
Wouldnt recommend it (especially in higher ranks) i dont know what reasons you have for not using a mic but like other users have said the delay can be a bother. Some people also have chat disabled so if you type a callout they might not receive it
---
And I am, in fact, not crying after reading this
---
Scorpion is basically a shotgun that fires all the pellets one at a time, but worse. Play within 10m of your Target whenever possible. 
---
Her shotgun is fucking amazing. 
---
Her gadget is like a bullshit Kapkan trap with no damage. If you can remember where you put them, or are close enough, you have a good flank opportunity. Or you just might get free intel for your team.
---
I barely remember high school but yeah
---
Agree 100% same background as yourself. 
---
Wish R6 had a after dark play mode no filter be as toxic as you want.
---
[Wait a minute](https://youtu.be/688OPQ9WFpA)
---
Im new and ive been having a lot of fun. Really havent seen much of above at all. Based on my other friends who are new, I think taking the game too seriously really makes it suck ass, but if you go in expecting to be trash and not caring for rank at all you can get pretty good pretty quick. I carry most of my casual lobbies now and ive only played for a month, so i think thats pretty good
---
The thermal is useless at high tiers as you need to strafe to live
---
I got it off there
---
People get banned for toxic behavior ever day in siege, not to mention the several ban waves.
---
I get called trash, told to delete the game, and otherwise abused in every match of Overwatch. It‚Äôs absolutely toxic. 
---
I rarely get abused by my own teammates in siege, and when it happens, they usually do it over ‚Äúall chat‚Äù and the enemy team ends up defending me.
---
Hundos aim is equivalent to that of a T-hunt bot
---
I was worried that this was going to mention the shite my friends did the other night lol.
---
Yes.  ADS is a multiplier applied to your H and V sensitivity when you are ADS.  So if you increase the H and V, you increase the speed while ADSed.
---
That is a good point. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a few new operators every now and then.. but now they are just coming up with dumb abilities with sweet guns. I say come up with less new operators and add some guns to old ones
---
and yet corporations exist to make money, not ethical choices, so this will keep happening.
---
Til shinjuku is not just a made up place within persona5 xD
---
Exactly lol
---
I'm gonna try this
---
Not low effort if he‚Äôs drawing a full comic. It‚Äôs relevant, it‚Äôs funny, and it‚Äôs part of a meme in the community. If you don‚Äôt like it just scroll past it.
---
No, I believe they are gone.
---
Sometimes I wonder how posts like this one get to front page.
---
This headgear has been on frontpage several times, seen it few days ago as well.
---
I felt that way about the entire game since somewhere in year 2
---
"Did you get my text?"
---
Might be for Valkyries gun, the MPX
---
Not hating, boosters are terrible.
---
And also, "you're trash" and not "your" :)
---
Thermite because he makes things go BOOM!
---
Yet people kept bitching about the immersion being ruined because ‚Äúirl there are no woman in grom‚Äù. Idk if thats true and dont care. Theyre still cool ops
---
Lol downvote me for testing out server capabilities in casuals? If any of you were on my profile you'd see where I stated multiple times I know how its all done, but I will not use it for a ranked advantage and that I'd rather see it fixed than abused. But no lets downvote cause "mean guy is diamond by ddosing"
---
Good idea. I should use this.
---
Will they come back? Or will they have Pro Team sets for other OPs later?
---
It is really frustrating everytime I play
---
The way it‚Äôs been, I think they release different ones for different ops and teams.
---
I went for a great monitor but I am still using the keyboard and mouse the computer came with. I‚Äôll look into all of this. Thanks!
---
Good call, I‚Äôll nail down what works for me. Thanks!
---
The music teacher at my school is a Russian immigrant and he wears a belt just like that to school everyday

The audio said he hit doc. Plus he had full health afterwards so even if he didnt hit his head my point would still be proven correct.

There's no Doc in the clip.

Restarting your game should fix it
---
Bro I play on both and the level of competition on console vs PC is vastly different and it's not cause of the xim. Players on PC for the most part know basic strats while on console most players are casual players meaning that they turn on their console and play siege and don't look up videos and shit. On PC on the other hand are players who either frequent this sub or watch prologue and watch YouTube videos to get better. Players on PC I would deem as hardcore gamers compared to console players who are much more casual. That is not to say console players are all just casual gamers, but I am saying that the majority do seem to fall within that specification.
---
Map knowledge and patience will fix most of your issues. It sounds like your dying from being too aggressive or not having map awareness. As far as the ongoing matches and balance... play Ranked
---
This post is beautiful beyond words, I don't know what to say, this post truly opens my eyes on the world. The deep philosophical question this post answers is extremely mind blowing! I can die a happy man now that I have seen this post. If I had the chance to meet the person who made this post I would for it is beautiful beyond words, whoever made this is a god among men.
---
never played R6 but this is exploitable so expect this to be a new meme. buy now.
---
Ok thx
---
Rainbow 6 characters get more face-lifts than the Kardashians.
---
Nah, her cameras need to breathe fire.
---
Lol you have a fully loaded primary weapon and you try using the gun specifically designed not to kill people. Nice.
---
It sucks especially as most of the time my team run in and die in the first 10 seconds
---
TLDR: Finka is incredibly versatile but can leave you feeling lost on what to do and is like a secondary pick op most to the time unless you have a defined team, so she's a good flex op. Maverick is good but do some research on tricks and stuff because he can become a real danger for his own team. Ela requires a lot of patience and map knowledge to master, she is great but you need to know positioning. 
---
I play finka a pretty good amount, and I feel she is a really strong operator in the right hands, but she lends herself very well to many different play styles. 
---
Since she has 3 primaries her roles tend to follow what she is using, shotgun=rush, spear=support (literally like no recoil) and lmg is middle ground. She has frags so she is very strong to bring anytime, but her ability takes some mastery and decision making. If you wanna play more selfish, pretend your team doesn't exist, boost when you feel it will help you to get a kill or push. If you wanna play for the team, help coordinate pushes because that extra boost will be nice. If you wanna play reserved, wait for people to get downed, or try to save them till the end and final fights, but this risks you not using your ability at all and dying without using it. Her ability has a lot of unique interactions, which are really cool, but if you dokt know them you can get played by them. I'd say she is a good op to bring if you aren't sure who you want to go and your team has already gotten all the necessary op types. Maverick is similar in that he requires a lot of practice and you will need to understand how his gadget synergizes with what the rest of your team is doing. I tend to play him if I really wanted hibana but someone already chose her or if thatcher is banned. 
---
Ela on the other hand is one of my mains but I use her shotgun exclusively so what I will say pertains to that but I have used the smg and use it in extremely rare cases. Ela has been nerfed a lot, but she is still very strong, however she requires A LOT of map knowledge to be truly successful. You need to know choke points, and rotation sets and understand when and where to pick a fight. You also would need to come to terms that even though you are a 3 speed, sometimes your greatest potential is anchoring. Her shotgun can just tear through a rush, and with the mines handy you can really throw off a teams coordination if you can scare them.
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
Its a 416. Look at the mag and the magwell. It even says 5,56mm NATO. 416 is in 5,56. 417 is chambered in .308
---
Certain maps
---
Don't play the new mode
---
I mean i have watched it multiple times on repeat i do feel worse and better about myself each time.
---
I really couldn't care less. I'm a Jew and I think it's hilarious. Checkmate champ.
---
Depending on map some ops are more useful so I try and ban. But most of the time the team bans the same people so by default my vote is for Maverick/Mira. Mira imo is a lot harder to deal with than Echo
---
How much does it cost?
---
Activate windows bruh
---
*Sledge, Smoke, Jager, Bandit and Ash would like to know your location*
---
Play more that helped me
---
It's all of those things combined, but I do think the biggest factor is a solid team not just communication, but a solid team balance. You need to have players who can play off of each other so if one player doesn't perform well another player can take their place and vice versa. Chemistry is what makes or breaks a team. Chemistry is what leads to game wins.
---
Reaction time is something that can't be changed with buttons. You need to work on that yourself. need to
---
High sensitivity :)
---
No it is not serious but have some respect for the people who carry you, not make fun of them, and at the end of the match i was still the MVP. It is just annoying to see 30 level cucks stealing kills and being unable to do anything cause you are outnumbered
---
Yeah, it does that. It's best not to watch it too many times. You might get withdrawals.
---
Christ the humour police are out in full force today aren't they. Never go to the shows of Ricky Gervais, Jimmy Carr, Robin Williams, Frankie Boyle, Bill Burr, or pretty much any funny comedian if this offends you. Holy shit. What a weak man you are. What happened to people?
---
High horizontal low ads
---
Yeah i know, but do you have any tips on have to improve? Because sometimes when i get the final killcam i just seems so slow.
---
Yeah. And sometimes you get vote kicked for playing too slow for people‚Äôs tastes. Like, there‚Äôs a reason I didn‚Äôt rush in behind that hot breach. I want to *live*
---
Certain maps, if my team starts on defence for example on oregon, we usually ban Thatcher/Thermite. In order to defend bottom floor and also second floor. 
---
I know this will also f*ck my team over when attacking, but as long as the team gains 2 wins in that defend section, it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Ranked matches generally take longer to finish than casual ones, though, so that evens out
---
Frost, because i 1v5 clutched a ranked match with her, my easy favorite after that
---
That‚Äôs a hard thing to learn.. you either got it or you don‚Äôt. But you can help it by increasing muscle memory that just comes from experience. Also have a good headset, audio ques are one of the most important aspects of the game. Listening for footsteps, if their running, crouching, prone, checking drones/cams. It can give you a slight head start when engaging. And map knowledge. This game is a creature of habit, get used to where people like to roam, hide, spawn peek, rotate. Having that awareness will make you instantly ready when you come across someone.
---
That it is not my problem, the problem is that when i see the enemy i have to Press the trigger faster.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of legendaries for the deagle. I have 2 and I dot have the pimp one
---
There's a website called [Human Benchmark](https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime) that you can possibly use to help.
---
this is easy. do it in a real game then post the pic
---
‚Äúhaha acog dood‚Äù üòÇüëå
---
yeah people on casual play for just to fuck around, I haven‚Äôt played seriously on casual for 1 year, because I was a noob and only used vigil... now I have 400 kills with vigil and nobody wants me on ranked cause I seem useless. This shows how serious and picky people are when it comes to ranked
---
Thanks, but i am level 180 so i know the maps and i have a good headset,
---
No, they better extend the challenge time, give it to us for free, or fix it soon. Pls ubi

Damn that‚Äôs what you call an uno reverse right there

Bro we just played the game together i was HartHolz 
---
You wanna queue now?
---
Completely agree with you there mate, as annoying as it is it's usually best to report and block. Just be the bigger man and dont react to it, the kids of siege ruin the fun for us all
---
If you solo queue silvers and you‚Äôre a ‚Äòplatinum‚Äô you should win constantly, all the time.
---
If you lose every now and then it‚Äôs okay but for the most part it should be a blowout.
---
If it‚Äôs not, ask yourself what are you doing differently?

But you know if your teammates run In and get interrogated I mean just tap f in the chat there

Not gonna lie was half expecting for you to get dicked on by a warden

But nice job

Peek a boo! I'm gonna shoot your ass!
---
Warden is shit. he needs  the damn AA-12 with  a round drum mag, that's be beast, or hell even a lever action semi rifle since he's a warden, could get a old sheriff costume to add to that damn mustache too
---
The SMG 11 has a smaller clip and is mostly only used due to the SAS shotgun users for a somewhat ranged gun, it should have less recoil
---
Nice I got platinum too it took so long because I needed to get that stupid breach charge kill on multiplayer. That was a pain in the ass to get.
---
Rukako was always best girl.

Ya but I don‚Äôt see that happening because she has the highest win rate of any operator right now

Did they call you a hacker after?

The attachment problem is linked to Showdown.

My entire point was that the Bearing-9 and SMG-12 and very much usable at close range. Either learn to use them or don't use them.
---
Alright thanks
---
I don‚Äôt know, it just happened
---
I clicked it. I hate it even more. I'm stuck having to die/lose 3+ rounds straight sometimes.
---
This if from the Fuze x AK-12 from girls frontline hentai doujin, eh?
---
Probably not, I mean Montagne means mountain so you could see if there is something like that. N√∏kk is trickier because of the √∏ in her name, looking up how to pronounce √∏/√∂ would help. Most players just say Nook (as in nook and cranny).  If you have any specific questions I could try my best to give you an answer.
---
Mira more like Milf
---
I mean could‚Äôve been a recording and OP didn‚Äôt feel like posting it on pc for whatever reason, it‚Äôs unlikely but I was just stating possibilities

This was happening to me today lmao. Thought it was my shit being broken by ubisoft.
---
just saying that that shottie with dragons breath, which can do damage over time would be annoying to go up against or even a lever action rifle would do him good.
---
It‚Äôs (in my opinion) the number one problem in all platforms. I know it‚Äôs sucks, but there‚Äôs nothing Ubi can really do Without also aiding them.

It's the latino mom of 7 kids whose main weapon is a flip flop

played with a 3-stack yesterday. They took turns to tk the remaining to players (me and another random). We lost that round. Obviously. The next round i get the same 3 people in my team again. Their excuse for teamkilling was: "It's just a fun little challenge".

Yeah, I was mainly looking at the complete lack of recoil on the shot more than his movements; he's got typical high sens mobility but even the best console recoil control has *some* kick, and dude had literally none.
