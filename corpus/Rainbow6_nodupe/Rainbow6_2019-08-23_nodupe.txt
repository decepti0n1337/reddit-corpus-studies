Of course it should.  But it should punish the person who put the hostage in the fire, not the original owner of the fire.
---

---
If a defender uses the hostage as cover and I shoot the hostage while firing at him, my team loses.
---
If I drag a hostage into capitao's fire, my team loses.
---
If I drag a hostage into Goyo's fire, my team should lose.  If I break goyo's fire onto the hostage, my team should lose, the same way we would if I fired a firebolt or threw a frag at the hostage.
---
---
---
That guy is super racist eww
---
Of course that argument does tend to fall a little flat, namely with the defenders and the SAS.  
---
The L85 is quite often the better and more common pick over the AR33 so you can't use that to determine if it's a Sledge or Thatcher on the field until a gadget is used.  Then the defenders frequently use the same gun.  The UMP, P90, MP5, SMG-11 and VSN 9x19 are all shared between the Ops of each CTU.  Plus the MP5SD shares the same suppressed sound as a suppressed MP5 on Doc or Rook, and IIRC the Mute's MP5k and the GIGN MP5 also share the same sounds.
---
Looks like school yearbook photos
---
Lol
---
So he can breath underwater and the condit shoots enemy‚Äôs?! Too op plz nerf
---
Probably because it would take longer to get DMCA‚Äôd opposed to YouTube.
---
Maybe we‚Äôll see this strat next lan
---
Oh crap, didn‚Äôt know that. That‚Äôs actually way cooler than I thought, when I tested her I thought her only utility was windows!
---
I will upvote for you so this reaches the mods
---
Nice
---
It looks ugly but i think we'll get used to it.

Mortal kombat!! Dun dun dun dundun dun dun dun doo doo do do do doo do doo do do do do do.
---
People only choose the ar-33 over the L8 because only thatcher has it lol

Balancing and bug updates are good for the game but it's not anywhere near content.

Dude almost typed allah in chat smh

It‚Äôs not gone yet

I believed I had it as well üòÇ

One look at our post history is enough to confirm he's a totally different person.

He's posting on PC master race and I'm posting on r/halo and Halo is an xbox exclusive.

Some people, believe it or not, are actually capable of thinking about things from other people's perspectives even if we don't agree with them.

You clearly are if you don't know what an analogy is, you're so fucking stupid it's kind of mesmerizing. You can't read, you have no argument, I'm honestly surprised you can vaguely spell correctly. 
---
Imagine being so fucking stupid that you can read but choose not to read someones response and just make up random shit, couldn't be me but apparently it is you
---
I think the new ops look good and new kanal looks fun
---
Man I just wish the new attack could use a pistol
---
Sau played against shroud in the creators cup at the Raleigh Major on Sunday past, got a couple kills on him!
---
https://youtu.be/fXEmbUkDkgo
---
Burnt Horizon actually. It was only tts several months before that as well
---
I think I prefer the dark background, but I like that they‚Äôre mixing it up. The white doesn‚Äôt look awful
---
This is how it looks now? Ew
---
Your analogy has to make sense if it is to work in the current context. You have no argument other than confirmation bias with no desire to see whether or not that is the case. 
---
Ya I choose not to read things that make no fucking sense
---
I get what you're saying but in the long run it really just doesn't matter at all IMO, the colour of an ops background does not alter the game at all.
---
I just want to play as Anton Chigurh.
---
Why he 3 feet tall tho
---
we all know they ain't porting their game to a new engine and this AC engine wasn't meant for shooting games soo, idk :(
---
Idk
---
They aint even add a map
---
Same with the current season
---
God the artists need to stop changing stuff that literally no one has asked for.
---
Ubi should make it so you can play any map ever made in custum
---
Check Microwave gaming channel, he uploaded all new Ember Rise legendaries.
---
(That is were I saw it)
---
r/boneappletea
---
If you get the chance, play with Dok and Kaid for and bit, then try the AR50 and you'll notice the side recoil it has. If they want to give it more and take the side recoil away along with the damage increase I'd be a ok with that
---
The battle pass is just stupid
---
It‚Äôs worth 1800 R6 credits but it was just a visual glitch so don‚Äôt worry
---
Lion has sledges hammer Jesus
---
But where will we find a Heart of the sea?
---
Why is mozzie, the shortest op in the game, the tallest on the op portraits?
---
Let's be real the gadgets are useless
---
How doesn't it make sense? Are you actually this fucking stupid lmaooo, and no you're just so dumb you can't process what I'm saying, I say "how do you test if Shroud actually has a god level of aim" your response "yOU jUsT TeSt It" "how exactly do you test it?" "yOu HaVE nO ArGueMenT, aND mAkE No SeNse"
---
I have you one way of testing it. 
---
What have you given other than ‚Äúshroud isn‚Äôt as good as people think he is.‚Äù
---
Nothing. Nothing at all.
---
Noice
---
You‚Äôre a good friend man. Hope your buddy does well and you get to hang real soon!
---
He talks a lot of crap for a 2700 mmr
---
Bro they totally reworked kanal, it's not even the same map anymore
---
Love the show but disliked for not giving it to the Spanish ops
---
Like, the country that the show is set in?????
---
Yeah you can‚Äôt go past 9 rounds but back before operation health when you could ‚Äúdraw‚Äù rounds if you drew at 4-4 you played  up till 13 rounds
---
Oh man the most thinly veiled excuses.  Cuz it's not like alts ever are used to post to different subs to obfuscate user history or circumvent bans or anything!
---
Funny that you claim to be a /r/halo regular yet are apparently unaware that that sub's been losing its collective shit over MCC coming to PC the past year.  But hey what would I know, I'm just [definitely a bigger Halo nerd than you](https://m.imgur.com/a/cAJjp)
---
Of course the other amusing thing is you talking about "understanding other people's perspectives" while completely wiffing on my point.  There's some sweet sweet irony in that claim.
---
Maybe you should take a step back and consider whether your interpretation of what he said is actually correct or if you're just reading what you want to read and pretending it makes you somehow more right than the rest of us ;)
---
Nah, just straight up wreck her. Make Sledge hard counter someone besides Castle, since he is already inferior to Buck in most regards.
---
No new weapons.
---
No "true" new map.
---
Half the seasonal weapon skins.
---
The laziness has no bounds.
---
super old exploit, been around for a few seasons now, but I guess it's getting popular now
---
Why does everyone except mozzie look like a midget?
---
Why would you do this to me?
---
I have good aim :^(
---
Isn‚Äôt Mira also a 2 speed?
---
you still don't seem to understand that the insurgency is sub 3rd world tier and war is way more than just K/D, Afghanistan right now is a total embarrassment for the ISAF forces as was the iraq insurgency until the Iraqi army reforms started to actually have an affect. The propaganda victory and strategic victory is a lot more important than the fact that the USA killed more, or else we'd consider Vietnam a victory too.
---
This shit looks... like shit
---
Not really a witch hunt unless you have malicious intent to cause, I believe reporting him is 100% okay and makes the community just a bit better.
---
That‚Äôs what I heard but apparently this is rampant at higher Eli right now
---
i have lost countless rounds because my team gets kill hungry and die
---
Have you tried not getting kicked
---
It‚Äôs possible to beat them. Just be on top of shit on defense and pray you get defense twice in overtime. Of course if they‚Äôre about to lose they ddos the server offline anyways
---
somehow not mozzie tho
---
So real quick can someone confirm this one more time?
---
[deleted]
---
Hard fought victory
---
And here I thought someone found yet another way onto purple tarp lol.
---
its optional dude, why are you mad
---
Hahahahaha good one
---
Nice aim on the scorpion, a lot of people end up shooting the ceiling.
---
If you complaining about having low guns go fucking play Team Fortress 2 that game has over 120 weapons
---
Hardly. After running angled on every gun I can, using vertical is just \*soooo slooww\* and it helps immensely when getting kills because I can shoot sooner than OPFOR. Me personally, I would rather put up with the added recoil
---
I saw a comment on this ( different post however) saying something like ‚ÄúRestricting weapons to operators might solve this issue‚Äù 
---
Seems like a good idea, if only I could find that comment and share it lol
---
120 with 1
---
thank you, someone else finally says it. everyone has just been bitching about the battle pass for a week while ignoring all the cool changes we're getting.
---
"IT'S TIME TO GET ~~SERIOUS~~ FUNKAY!"
---
Fuck that guy, I had a similar problem once
---
greetings fellow females, would you like to play a games ?
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Keep in mind we are talking about a company that now has a paid season pass AND a paid battle pass in their premium priced game.
---
Haha the recoil is unpredictable
---
Yeah his name on his Xbox profile was sideways too like all of it lmao his friend messaged me my address then deleted the message too before i could report it that‚Äôs what bothered me the most ab it
---
All incorrect. 
---
 The real unit is called the 707th Special Mission Group. The 707th is a batallion, made out of two companies. One of these is indeed female-only. The term division is totally incorrect here. 
---
Secondly, A Division is composed of around 8000-30.000 men. Which are devided in Regiments in most countries. 
---
To put it on perspective: battalion &lt; regiment &lt; division.
---
Nice job! But please, use the lean-buttons. Makes you harder to hit, while you can still shoot the enemy.
---
I have to admit thiugh, that I have no Idea on how often people lean on console, as I'm a pc player
---
wholesome
---
2 vastly different games, who cares if another game has more or less it's a different game.....
---
Definitely this. FMG COULD work on Nokk is her stealth aspect was somehow just more efficient. If she was 3 Speed or able to run while using her gadget, Nokk would be able to rotate around quickly and quietly than any other Attacker and thus make her stand out. FMG and no utility would balance out the fact that she has one of the best flanking potential. 
---
However, in her current state, her quiet walk is only slightly better than 3 Speed Attackers crouch walking. There's really no point of picking her over Ash or IQ who can do Nokk's job more efficiently in general. 
---
I highly doubt Ubi will change Nokk's (or anyone else even Warden) gun and the only way to really buff her is by buffing her gadget.
---
I even like more what they‚Äôre doing by trying to improve old weapons by giving them new attachments are giving like Vector and Kaid sniper to a 2/2 which is very different from an anchor use
---
I just didn‚Äôt like when they just put bad guns with no improvement on Warden 
---
Also even tho reusing old guns is totally fine to me I still expect gadget to be not a total ripoff of already existing gadgets like we got during Phantom Sight
---
Very hyped for this season
---
I still used G36 back then because of the angled grip
---
I feel the opposite tbh gadgets&gt;guns
---
I mean don't everybody do that
---
Yesssss (:
---
 Female?
---
This.
---
Unfortunately OP the moderators made a rule where you CANNOT post names of others in this sub. And you CANNOT post accusing someone of hacking either.
---
Make a report on the official website the legitimate way, not through reddit.
---
That's even better.
---
i agree with him
---
Nope 1 speed 3 armour. It's very noticable when playing Goyo with the vector, you're way more mobile in a gunfight, with the high fire rate you are much more deadly.
---
I don‚Äôt like this game
---
What rank are you in and what console ?
---
we get it, you don't like recycled weapons. there's reasons for it.
---
FUCKING HEADLESS MOTHER FUCKER
---
why do they make this shitty changes mandatory
---
Prefiring would counter it well
---
Wrong game
---
I agree to all your points, but your username upsets me.
---
I play AR-33 for angled grip
---
FUCKING AIRHEADED BITCH
---
what platform do you play on ??
---
and the two communities can fight over who is the most sensitive whoever cries the hardest wins
---
What platform mate?
---
I could help you (not boost you) but help you practice...
---
Dude the suppressor looks more like a dildo than an attachment
---
Aren‚Äôt you hiding in a corner tho?
---
Pc
---
True, but that's hard to do with a holosight.
---
Even if you were playing 5:4 60fov with an ultra low sens, this would still be a pretty difficult shot with a holo.
---
Flat board.  2/4 anchor attachments into the wall.  Look for studs if you are using heavy wood.
---
they probably have a lot of diversity for hires
---
Dark backgrounds really felt like they matched the operators and made them look cooler
---
What platform and server
---
oh damn, I would play with you but it depends what server you are on.
---
If an account gets reported as a smurf account ban it
---
Yes. If the recycled choices were better during Phantom Sight and didn't leave a bitter taste and bad reputation, I don't think ppl would have complained this much. 
---
It was combination of bad gun choices + underwhelming gadgets that made PS operators just terrible in general.
---
PICK A CHARACTER THAT TAKES SKILL GOD DAMN IT
---
Is this fucking garry's mod or something?! Looks so Half assed!
---
Every 2 games I run across a smurf
---
Another thing is some weapons would be overpowered if used beside the original operator due to attachments. The reason I say attachments is because every single operator gun that is full auto has an option for a grip except for those guns, bucks c8 and nomads arx, that have gadgets attached. If the c8 or arx was given to someone without that need for mounted gadgets, there would be room for say the c8 with a fore grip or the arx with an angled grip. These two guns are already good, with the arx being amongst the top 5 ars for dps. This games a delicate balance to maintain.
---
More weapon balancing means that there‚Äôs less content each update because their spending a bunch of time balancing guns. Who cares if they add a new gun or not every update, they plan on having 100 operators in the game, so if they added 3 primary weapons every update that would add up to 150 weapons. That would get to the point where every update where getting new models, with a few different ticks in stats. It‚Äôs better that we get operators with repeat weapons now, so that the weapons we get in the future are unique, fun, and interesting.
---
Glaz now has to stand still in order to use his thermal sight. Jackal only has 4 pings now (was 5), and Echo's Yokai will disorient for less time.
---
and how it should be
---
I usually do pretty ok, highest this season  plat 2  it's just a massive losing streak I'm on and want to play just don't have much motivation
---
Read the blog posts on rainbow6.ubi.com
---
Look up a video, will be easier
---
I feel like they're trying to ease the game away from a dark military shooter towards a more fun, accessible experience. And I don't like it.
---
For sure! Though interestingly stat wise it behaves identically to Maestro's LMG just with greater damage falloff and a smaller magazine size.
---
Happens a lot when joining mid game. I think it can sometimes be because of how long it‚Äôs taking you to actually join
---
just dont give the arx and c8 to other ops.or dont let then use foregrips
---
Somehow Mozzie looks taller than anyone else due to the spacing of the background lmao
---
Kafe is ruined ? Did you even play the game on the TTS ?
---
Ikr? when you get right down to it, the guns don't actually make that much of a difference between each other unless you're using something drastically different like a shotgun. They mostly play pretty similarily, and its the gadgets that really make the difference.
---
"Trust me, I've seen this strat in Pro League"
---
OR SOMEONE THAT ISN'T A DAMN 5 SPEED AND CAN RUN FASTER THAN LIGHT
---
Dark mode &gt; light mode in 100% of situations
---
Lets not forget about Buck, Finka, and Blackbeard who straight up have gadgets that enhance how you can shoot people.
---
I'm playing it now. Old Kafe was superior.
---
op is joking don't take anything he says seriously
---
Look at the end of my newest post and you can see I did exactly that
---
True. I don't think Shroud is as good as aimer as Beaulo is at siege, or as ScreaM is at CSGO, or various pros from other games- but I've never seen anyone as good at aiming in brand new games as shroud (but that may be purely because he has the most examples out there).
---
Now of course I could be very well wrong, but there aren't many pro players that stream as many random games as shroud does.
---
Frankly I think the differences in skill are basically moot at a certain level, and that it doesn't really matter how Shroud's aim stacks up to other streamers when playing a game for the first time.
---
Basically I want Beaulo to start making youtube vids in random roblox games he finds, in order to prove who is the best once and for all.
---
My honest thoughts are that it is made like this to make the operator cards from elite skins stand out more. This is desirable from a marketing perspective.
---
does GLAZ counts with on SCOPED as gadget kill ?
---
I love how you wrote a tirade basically repeating what everyone has been saying about the guy you're defending.
---
While claiming that everyone else is just misunderstanding his point cuz they're retarded.
---
It's like a 1000 word version of "no you!" lol
---
No it couldn't possibly be that his point is retarded, clearly it's that everyone who disagrees with him is literally too stupid to understand the point, but you understand all points and get to be sole arbiter of who is right lol.
---
The dramatic irony of your posts is incredible.  Like there is so much I could dig into here, from the fact that your "skills" got you a fake job after producing content for the most lackluster Halo game out there, in a game mode that was dead within three months of release (guess your maps sure were good quality! /s) or the fact that your position as a totally real and definitely not fake level designer in no way qualifies you to be a psychic who knows the intentions of people you've never met better than anyone else (nor does it qualify you to really know anything about marketing, release packages, individual hero shooter characters, especially since Halo 5 famously eliminated any individualization, all things that the season pass is more relevant to).  OR even I could start digging into how you claim to understand my point but clearly don't since you couldn't even repeat what I said correctly and completely changed the meaning of it (the FMJ in game is literally a reskin of the MP5K.  Until they added Mozzie's holographic sight to it the two guns had identical stats in every way, right on down to attachments and recoil patterns.  For 3 years the guns were identical and people had zero issues with it.  Funny you'd think someone who's so talented as a game designer woulda noticed something like that...) but really your continued insistence that only your position is one of logic while ignoring facts that conflict with your own statements is just the best part of this little hole you've dug for yourself.
---
I shudder to imagine how well you code if this is your grasp of logic.
---
But hey you know what's funny? I actually make money off my work, whereas you apparently claim to but don't care about the biggest releases in your supposed field of business.  It's weird, you know, you'd think such a dedicated game dev would own a PC since that's where most games are released and all.
---
A threat
---
yea true ig.
---
Dokk did surprise me.
---
Definitely liked the darker ones better
---
YES PREACH!
---
(im a vigil main lmao, he's a really good operator)
---
Maybe if I'm toxic too they'll accept me, right?
---
Gold 1-Plat 3 on Xbox. there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a smurf account unless it‚Äôs a plat who has a smurf in bronze. there is nothing wrong with just having an alt account and leveling up and playing ranked
---
thats good
---
Stonks
---
Worse than bots
---
Twitch pulled her drones out of her ass
---
and how do they know what accounts are smurfs? there‚Äôs no way to tell.
---
Maybe
---
and im not saying just give everyone random guns. give dokkaebi blackbeards dmr or give smoke a supernova, give ying iqs lmg and etc.. to keep the roles those operators have the same as usual
---
This is amazing why aren't we funding this UBISOFT GET ON IT
---
If they give repeat weapon opps now, then we can get opps with unique weapons in the future
---
I kinda liked it when the had the full body profile type of thing in the first year of the game
---
Is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJAY26UQf5c) what you were looking for?
---
if he did he'd probably cry himself to sleep every night after a 7 year old insulted his mom too many sensitive people play games now at least the brain dead ones anyway
---
Overcompensating
---
Why are we removing content?
---
When is Year 5 bomb only happening?
---
as a chanka main I can agree with this.
---
Also, I went 19-6 in this game but my team ended up losing üòï
---
Fixing the wrong things. They should follow that certain YouTuber that finds all that exploit and glitches and fix them.
---
Momma always said, "if you ain't got nuthin nice to say, place siege."
---
guess I'm not getting a free charm
---
Kitchen Site was shit lmao
---
a 4 man squad killed me because i picked tachanka on coastline
---
Wouldn't that mean he'd have to play ranked?
---
Then why are you in this sub ?
---
*Technically* Sony could disable USB input or something, but that would probably be an insanely over the top move.
---
F
---
To express my opinion
---
Ssshhh, she gets paid by the hour...
---
Mozzie looks like the biggest one out of the operators, but in reality they gave him a stool.
---
The TM too...
---
 How would you charge the controller or use a headset then lmao
---
So is the para 308 lol
---
I don't get it?
---
When your team fucks your strat up
---
Yeah, that's kinda my thing he plays a lot of newer FPS games so has more experience with a lot of different aiming patterns and stuff you know?
---
Braindamage from the article, don't even read it
---
Cause then they don‚Äôt put new stuff in normally and put it all in the battle pass.
---
The entire point of battle passes are stupid as its pay money to grind for limited time items and nothing good is ever gets put in the free bit of it.
---
Along with we already have a bunch items that require you to buy r6 credits, the event packs, and the season pass.
---
they removed maps from the pool because they sucked. idk why they didn't remove skyscraper while they were at it
---
did you even play old Kanal? it was horrible. i'd rather get a rework of a bad map to make it good every season than get 2 mediocre maps every 2 seasons.
---
night maps are super attacker-sided, glad they're gone. 
---
hostage and secure sucked in ranked, glad they're gone. and did you say new Kafe was terrible? it's miles better than the old one, your sense of balance is wack.
---
Yes old Kafe the map where all gunfights on the top floor were attackers shooting from the skylight and had one of the worst bomb sites in the game was much better than the new map that was actually balanced, makes perfect sense 
---
Also night time was unnecessary and just made the game frustrating to play because of the bad lighting
---
Done
---
Stimed my Marley himself
---
Agreed.
---
# YOUR ASS IS MINE, MINER!
---
Maybe they were worried somehow people would rappel through it or something idk. (Oh no did I just give people ideas)
---
I did it from Uplay
---
They probably kicked you because they didn‚Äôt want to load time of the  new guy who joined, I tend to do it often after sitting in lobby waiting for the other side to stop loading, shortly before someone tends to leave on our side. That‚Äôs when its kick national time
---
Its like this reddit dark mode is better than light mode
---
this gotta be a troll
---
TFW the G8A1 with an angled grip is the more versatile weapon...
---
Idk what drugs op is on to think the old Kafe was better
---
As long as every reused gun gets something nice like a silencer, angled grip, or an updated optic I wouldn't mind as much... A new gun at least once a season would be nice, or even modified guns like the m249 saw and v308.
---
Oh yeah that's true...
---
Uh, I guess they could try white list certain device IDs or something? Disable certain device drivers in some way?
---
Yeah, there really isn't anything they can do that wont fuck over something else.
---
It just doesn't fit the background is ubisoft color blind or something?
---
Look closely , the old ones have their respective CTU badge on the background
---
OCD initiated
---
they're cosmetics? it has literally no effect on gameplay
---
Sort of, but a lot of people thought it wasn‚Äôt. Most people seem okay with ‚Äúexploits‚Äù that only involve changing an angle. The exploits people do not tolerate are the ones that make it impossible for you to kill someone. By this point every pro knows about purple tarps, so it was expected to be used and prefired/runout on a lot.
---
Great
---
Omae wa shinderu on that last kill
---
I guess you should've kept it for yourself
---
I‚Äôve played 10 games today and 3 were ddosed, twice by the same player. First time we tied up the match and they instantly booted the server, second time we were on outback and tied it 1-1 just like before and again server booted.
---
Super great
---
The folding glock in a box suits the frogwoman?
---
That‚Äôs the point?
---
Not related to siege but I had a 50kill game in CSGO today and still lost :(
---
You might be the luckiest player I‚Äôve ever met then, hopefully that continues for you
---
and she gets to use that performance enhancing surge in..... bed
---
Did you really get it though? Lol
---
Why is mozzie the tallest?
---
Well I mean, it took them like 6 months to nerf Ela, do a lion re-work etc.
---
I mean, he doesn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs one of the best on defense.
---
I would take a duplicate epic over a legendary any day
---
Or you know, they just could make nothing at all.
---
Hello AxLxExX, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cu702i/twitch_ubisoft_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

That excuse was bullshit, they don't license any weapons in Siege. That's why they all have fake names.

No it‚Äôs not, It‚Äôs loud and you can easily predict where shes going to come in at, Castle, Frost and Kapkan are going dominate her. She‚Äôs not game changing
---
ah that would make sense. ya hate to see it
---
Well your argument a second ago was "isn't 100 enough?"
---
Low IQ individual aren‚Äôt you
---
hahahaha 50% true  
---
But it's also really cool and I wanted to share
---
Im Na east servers ddosers are crazy here ... i dont try &amp; remember names not worth it
---
I need 3 more achievements but 2 are secret
---
Still one of my all time favorites.
---
In casual or ranked?
---
Couldn't stop laughing when blitz give them quick eyes and the sledge booped him with the hammer üòÇ
---
Like how no one notices the acog
---
Idk I love her elite
---
The portraits along with the weapon and uniform backgrounds are ugly, the white does not look good
---
Because it‚Äôs bad?  The colors don‚Äôt make sense at all and meld horribly.
---
For the time it's gonna remain in the game, I would be disappointed if it looked good. So many unused assets. Wasn't outbreak already dubtious ? Don't get me wrong, I loved Outbreak. But so much work put to waste for a temporary gamemode when you could be working on something more productive, just no. Ubisoft is already not good at full productivity, I wouldn't dare to imagine if they were allow to run wild.
---
Yeah there's definitely no way they'll replace an operators guns, maybe add a sight or buff/nerf it. But they can definitely rework her ability to suit what she could have been
---
But it is.
---
Meh i don‚Äôt care regardless of their answer. We have plenty of weapons in siege for them to work around and use
---
A jolly good day to you too my friend
---
I saw a post a few days earlier where they were gonna re-work a few operators, one of them being tachanka and it said he will be able to do a full 360¬∞ turn and you can attach it on deployable shields and once you do it can only do a 105¬∞ turn
---
He told me to say it
---
It's just a strip of transparent tape and whoever run through just got their bloody eye slapped
---
Do it again.
---
Waste of renown
---
Lower your sens.
---
It really is and it needs to be dealt with asap it‚Äôs cheating to an extreme level
---
Didn't know it was thsi bad on xbox
---
Nobody was meant to see a leaked test server patch for a mode that most likely isn't done yet
---
The Doc point of view came out a week before Ash's did
---
yeah, felt like it was long ago
---
I only remember them because of how often I keep getting matched against these guys. My game has been booted 4 times by the same person in the past week. Two of those times being today
---
You are saying that even if im better than you at aiming, somehow you are going to kill me, not even that, you are going to even prevent me from entering the building, that statement goes back to who is better at killing, you can spawn peek all you want dude but if you are shit it doesn't matter. So you are not making a case for yourself. Strategy can be there but again any strategy crumbles when you cannot kill. I'm not saying that strategy and gadgets dont matter at all. What Im saying is, at the end of the day you are going to fight someone and if you suck, no matter your "strategy" or your gadget, you are going to die.

I‚Äôm envy the players who say they‚Äôve only been booted/ddosed/stressed once or twice
---
So many great guns we will never see, MP5/10, F2000, the FAD, Striker, Galil, Uzi, Tavor, UMP9, and a good dozen exotic Russian guns.
---
Ela in her current state of 8 nerfs and 0 buffs makes her one of the worst operators in game,  go maestro.
---
That can't be right. He's got a new weapon...
---
Delete this so itll make its way to live build pls dont let no dev look at that
---
 God I hate BikiniBodhi
---
Don‚Äôt know why, I‚Äôve just never liked the guy.
---
All I‚Äôm asking for is the OCP-11 lmao
---
There is an option to do just that already....
---
As a fellow 2AM scroller, this spooked the shit out of me
---
I guess since you uninstalled it doesn't really matter but I'll throw this out there anyway. 
---
Try playing later in the evening. I'm generally on after 10 p.m. and don't really experience any issues in ranked other than typical server farts. As I said I got hit on one of my other accounts once this season around the same time frame but other than that it's just boosters or people wanting to play with friends that have a huge skill gap.
---
It's weird, because there's an apply to all option for charms and skins when you buy them in the store
---
They also stated it was low on their priority list, maybe this is a teaser of something coming to fruition.
---
Says the blitz main! :)
---
They don't use any real weapon names, so I don't think they ever licensed any weapons for Siege to begin with.
---
Fuck you.
---
@Pericote9 on twitter*
---
It‚Äôs my main and the problem is it wasn‚Äôt working then randomly worked now it‚Äôs doing this again
---
Why are you guys hating on rainbow? You have it but licenses to have guns in your game
---
Yeah some people only care about your rank, some kid spam party invited me and called me bad just cause my ranked kd (I‚Äôm bad so I could give one less shit), so, I called him the gay f word and I got communication banned for 2 days on Xbox live, do I regret it? Fuck no
---
If we could ever get the An94 with 1800rpm burst fire i'd nut.
---
Alright buddy well I‚Äôm gonna go back to my daily stuff and you go back to screaming at people on reddit sounds good :)
---
It looks fine
---
i just noticed pulses face
---
You know what this looks like to me now? A mobile Chinese bootleg siege like game. Moot, Smuck, Boyo, Pal and Mindy.
---
r/titlegore
---
Ok well I want to rank up obviously but I‚Äôll be able to do that better if I can get kills and play w a team
---
Hello brodiebradley51, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

Any reason as to why though?

Oh. Yeet
---
If someone cant choose an opperator it gives him one for the round?
---
ultimate beta strategy: assume everything, lack basic logic.
---
Ok
---
Looks great! Did you draw this yourself?
---
I‚Äôm confused why everyone is whining about the battle pass?
---
I have..
---
I think its when u go doc on tower, then pick the lowest obj so the terrorists take a long time to get there, and u dont die immediately, which gives u a decent amount of renown.
---
Why would they change this?
---
Same thing happened to my team as well
---
Im more surprised that you found a game for article 5
---
I like the Contrasting of the new one

*mphm*
---
*you‚Äôre
---
This is going to be terrifying
---
Memes aside, no new guns kills my enjoyment of trying new operators for the first time. I usually run a few dozen terrorist hunts whenever new guns are out and really get into it. Just being reused guns is kinda meh.
---
;( smoke is losing his impacts and now i cant impact trick....... big sad
---
Yeah definitely better
---
i've played 32 ranked matches this season, 15 losses, &amp; 7 of them are because of dossing. i haven't played ranked in like 2 months.
---
I‚Äôve done worse as sledge.
---
toxicÔºÅlol
---
Im just dissapointed in these 2 seasons the gadgets have been shit (goyo helps the attackers more than the defenders) but ill admit the ops wouldnt be as shit if they had unique guns, hell not even unique guns just guns that make sense for them, nokk should have the MP5SD, Warden needs and acog especially because hes supposed to counter glaz the P90 would be perfect
---
this is why we test things XD
---
I actually laughed
---
no its 3 sledge reskins whit 4 ability's doki / lion / jakal / pulse
---
and ela / frost / kapkan / lesion whit the rush ability

To complain it seems
---
What‚Äôs Quarantine
---
Why in the fuck is mozzie taller than maestro?
---
There obviously needs to be a balance, anything otherwise is just ignorant or stupid. 
---
Take our friend Warden for example, hes pretty shit, a mostly useless gadget, some would call it the worst in the game. So if hes not got  a good gadget what does he have guns? Nah not really. The MPX is pretty weak and the M590 is obviously situational due to its range.
---
What if we buff the MPX or 590 to make him more competit- wait we cant do that because these guns are shared by Valkyrie and the SAS boys, none of which should be buffed. 
---
The lack of a unique gun on Warden will make it difficult to ever add offensive power to him because in doing so it will be affecting other operators, essentially the only way to pull him out of the gutter is to buff the shit out of his gadget.
---
I have Plasma Pink, Multiple legendaries and multiple Black Ice skins (including Ashs' full load out) and funny thing is I'm not flexing because I didn't realize how lucky I have been until I was recently informed.
---
Never spent a cent on R6 credits either.
---
Man he really wants the massively rewarding diamond weapon charm
---
Dang lucky
---
I don‚Äôt think that takes less than the famous 1 min win hostage rescue from House.

Dark-mode always looks better than light-mode

If it's downloaded via steam, verify integrity of game files. Right click on game on the list, click properties, go to local files. Steam games get fucked all the time.

I get like 85% commons out of my packs
---
Helmet I think
---
I rock this one since I'm a bartender. Ahaha.
---
You can also buy each piece individually for (I think) 25000 Renown. Might be a bit off because mine with the Season Pass says 22500.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
Thicc
---
Did you try burst with it
---
Now THATS what I call an epic gamer moment.
---
Sweaty players in casual LUL
---
I wanted enjoy causal only to find 2 hackers in the match, Mozzie at the beginning was one of the hackers. Plz ban them Ubi!
---
How
---
Yeah the main problem is that if you start one side all the time you never get any practice on ranked for the other...
---
I got duplicate Black Ice earlier
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
Hibana was leaked
---
No, TAA changes the rendered resolution. My first guess with running ultra is that you maxed everything. With TAA-4x, you'd be rendering at 4k rather than 1080.  
---
Could you drop a screenshot of your settings? Not sure what would keep you down at 80, but might see something.
---
Level 156 here with only 1 black ice, for the m1014 lol
---
Mavs DMR doesn't fire 50 cal likes those from a Barrett it fires 50 cal Beowulf
---
On the website the ITA12s is (in)correctly listed as the ITA125
---
Ah the life of a solo queuer. Can‚Äôt tell you how many times this has happened to me and I get kicked (in casual) or get called trash and garbage (in ranked) so much fun
---
nice
---
Literally wholesome. Thank you good sir
---
Sure
---
did he get nerfed again?
---
Imagine rolling up to a cosplay place (idk what they‚Äôre called) cosplaying as smoke and pull out an actual m59
---
Or mozzie had a growth spurt
---
Please tell me you were joking about boosting him, cuz if not, you‚Äôre a waste of mar.
---
support.ubi.com
---
Idk why you think reddit has the power to ban siege cheaters.
---
imagine being in such deep copper that you still think Jackal is the most OP motherfucker in the game
---
Looks clean I like it
---
-2000 IQ
---
Well, i guess that's an exception. Though it'll be really hard to tell if that's the truth or not
---
Same thing happened to me in a ranked match. I lost the 1st round after getting headshotted by 2 people and got tkd the next 2 rounds til I left.
---
The way how Maverick slides into objective... hilarious
---
F for purple tarps
---
Is it to prevent hibana pellets?
---
ur a good friend
---
Her gadget shouldn't be countered by mute jammers because one of its functions is to detect mute jammers
---
Been playing 3 years and still dont have black ice
---
It gives a better view thru the window, you can look down more easily for example
---
Ayy, I too started not so long ago, like not even a week probably, I got black ice PMM out of my very first pack lmao
---
*Sure it's not a primary but anyway, shush*
---
What if I told you I have both max quality and high performance?
---
It's probably to make sure the debris doesn't get in the way of the Mira
---
Literally unplayable. I can't believe they've done this.
---
"Im GonNa FuCKinG kILL YoU FOr nO nEW GUns" said every braindead plat
---
Is this a flex or a call for help?
---
Ya lol after switching to reflex, personally, I'll never go back to acog. Gun is too good in a 1v1 to sit back on an angle with it
---
damnn
---
Cant really say i dislike it to be honest.
---
well when  ur standing within a mute jammer u haven't  destroyed I think you are more than stupid enuff to deserve not seeing any other gadgets while still standing with range.
---
Tbh if it was Pearl White on White it wouldnt be bad
---
You think they would put a glock in the game
---
True but constantly giving new ops same old guns isn't fun either.
---
The supernova has been buffed due to all shotguns having increased destructibility. It's great now.
---
This much better, wouls still prefer a 3d operators pick menu thingy like in for honor.
---
Yeah me too my fps has also tanked today
---
Yes especially on attack but to me one of the biggest things holding back some LMGs is the fire rate, the alda doesn't suffer from this at all,like I mentioned earlier the only thing holding it back is the ADS time but you have brought up a lot of good points, I suppose personal preference is important too, that's why discussing the best guns in the game is really interesting to me
---
Never played overwatch but think we could win that one
---
apparently unpopular opinion: historical elites get boring real quick, i much prefer elites based on the op's lore like this one
---
Im polish but sadly i cant speak polish because i was born in the states but my grandpa was a holocaust survivor
---
No I completely disagree, remember mute jammers work vertically too, sometimes you want to destroy them from below or above
---
I don't think the IDF will ever get added for political reasons, that's why they snuck Ash in at launch.
---
Though I do wish they were added with their own season. The attacker could get either an oldschool Galil or Tavor, and the defender could get an Uzi, both getting the Jericho or Baby Eagle for sidearms.
---
Ditto
---
Yeah...nerfed until balanced
---
Dark mode users unite
---
Ahah very funny comic that was posted months ago before the Lion rework which OP definitely made by himself :)
---
&gt;Given the nature of the game. Having huge amount of weapons to monitor and balance would affect the game negatively
---
You literally have it backwards. When several ops have the same gun you lose the capability to nerf an operator by just touching their gun. Because now you're touching several operators at once.
---
then again I say take 2 steps in any direction and now...YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW, THE RAIN HAS GONE..... so yes even vertically you are stupid.
---
I see a man of cylture as well
---
wow i wish i could get my first legendary from an alpha pack
---
Why do all the new comers get the f2 black ice lol
---
nah u r just dumb af :O
---
Oi blin i spelt culture wrong
---
what the fuck is this supposed to mean lmao
---
Thanks :)
---
Why
---
Terrorist Hunt needs a mode that's better for solo Defense play. Classic and Hostage Rescue are good for newer players since you can set the pace of the encounter; Disarm Bomb and Protect Hostage tie you to the objective and throw terrorists at you. Either let us play Defense operators in Classic or add something like a mode where terrorists are hunting you, but you are free to retreat where necessary.
---
And a simple shooting gallery mode where you can switch between attachments without restarting the match and practice shooting moving targets would be nice.
---
Everyone has TTS access.
---
You do realise there are certain situations where you need be directly above or below right?  The metal beams would stop your bullets, this is a post about IQ being buffed yet you are pitching a nerf
---
I usually act incredibly stupid, they either get more angry or give up.
---
I second this, I never get flashed by them and I feel bad when the ying rushes in expecting me to be flashed
---
Step step. Or do we need more?
---
I agree Jackal needs a nerf on the length of ticks or reduce the number of ticks because it lasts way too long and it‚Äôs useful on almost all maps for clearing out roamers.
---
I wish she was a trap, but that isn‚Äôt true, let alone a robot.
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
As someone with an open support case spanning nearly a month and no closer to resolution, i can say their friendliness is second only to their incompetence.
---
Aim will only take you so far in this game, especially on attack where smart defenders can win by just playing the waiting game. Reminds of a PL game on consulate where one team opened the wall to garage pretty quickly, but had zero pressure elsewhere. The defenders just didn‚Äôt peek until the attackers went for the execute which was then easily dealt with thanks to their plant denial, crossfires, and kill holes made by roamers, who were never dealt with.
---
We can talk about it
---
[removed]
---
I never understood that, they don't complement each other. Both force you to stop moving. Now replace either with Jackal and you are at an impasse where one ability stops you from moving if you want to live and the other forces you to move
---
Important message: Ubi can‚Äôt keep adding new guns, because they have a limited amount they can register in the game (yah it‚Äôs stupid)
---
Pre-nerf lion was really fun, now he‚Äôs useless
---
It was ranked unfortunately
---
That 4-4 win feeling! Well done.
---
Elephant&gt;glacier
---
thanos toes
---
use the tachanka turret to go thru an invisible wall
---
They dont use real weapon names? Have you never heard of the G36C? Never heard of the UMP? Never heard of the L85A2? AUG? PMM? And those are just a few weapons the game has so many weapons in it
---
You are so damn right. I've played Siege on PC, PS4 and now on XB1 and its all the same. Votekick because of low level, tk because of low level and so on. As soon as i hit higher platinum rank there was an increase of friends request from people which actually kicked me out of the game weeks ago.
---
Thats why i nearly always played and still play solo. Of over 1000hours playing this game i have maybe played 3 games with a party.
---
By far the worst community ever. And i have experienced alot. Trust me.
---
I know I'm probably a bit behind on this news but I'm sad that they're reworking kANAL
---
Ëçâ
---
"Mom, come pick me up, i'm scared"
---
Yeah, its ugly af
---
I don‚Äôt see a problem with it.
---
WHAT DOES IT COST? I NEED THIS ASAP
---
1) I checked his profile, did he stack up with randoms? He literally hasn't friended anyone on xbox.
---
2) a similar type guy goes to my school. He told me to quit playing cause his mentality is that anyone under plat shouldn't play ranked, and anyone under gold shouldn't play casual.(I average Silver 2-Gold 4 depending) let's just say that after he told me to quit playing because I don't take the game seriously, he needed some makeup for his eye. And now he doesn't Gate keep as often
---
Against a good Bandit/Kaid tricker there is definitely some strategy and coordination  with your hard breach required. Maybe it gets zapped by an ADS because you threw it through a door instead of the wall or they are juggling them. There are plenty of ways of Thatcher to be used poorly.
---
Applies to everyone. Why wouldn't it?
---
YES!
---
Why do people complain about a match being unbalanced when it ends 4-5? That was quite literally the best working piece of matchmaking ever. üòÇ
---
Exactly!
---
how would the queue threshold change that from happening?
---
Everyone got kills, no one dominated... Perfect.

ramp bad, block good.
---
NICE
---
On pc no recoil is hard Actually, probably the only one that is harder is ela's rifle one, but not even this much.
---
It depends. And I mean now quite a few operators have C4 (which makes me really worry about Fuze‚Äôs viability, though they did finally lower his gadget deploy time).
---
how long did you derank to do this?
---
Oh my...
---
Wtf happened to the table
---
The shroud hoodie &lt;3
---
Tbh fuze isn‚Äôt viable since the hip fire nerf to shields
---
I have no idea
---
But plane tho
---
If I had money I would give it to you. The patch notes for next season honestly look really good and fun. I see this season more of another operation health instead of a content filled season
---
This is a genius strat when u have a volcan shield facing the hostage, the lion shoots through a wall/window thinking it‚Äôs shooting u but I actually just shot the gas canister and is burning the hostage.
---
Yeah I honestly think he is the worst operator in the game and am surprised no one else seems to think so. I can‚Äôt think of a single operator who gets killed no matter how he tries to use his gadget. And then he‚Äôs just slow and loud.
---
Fuck you're reposts.......and don't start with ''I didn't know''
---
Maybe you just don't know what fun is....or you just suck.
---
So many people hurt by cosmetic changes lol hate to see how in-game changes will be received
---
We do
---
Noted
---
&gt;we would boycott 
---
Speak for yourself.
---
No that's a meme stemming from a song called Crab Rave. Its used for literally everything.
---
Ok but you need to get past 2
---
Weird for me the bearing is manageable but the smg-12 is nearly uncontrollable
---
Best siege win i ever got was because I broke a window with sledge into the hostage and ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù shot the hostage with my shotgun, downing him. But because lesion was a dumbass he had placed GU mines right next to the hostage so he killed him and we won the round in 10 seconds.
---
Tachanka is worse tbf, fuze can use his gadget on soft walls and floors on which the defender have to guess where he is but he‚Äôs still bad
---
It's honestly ridiculous but sadly I can't say I'm surprised, this community has some terrible people in it.
---
Make it fly
---
Hello Rastrein, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Thats so nice of you !
---
That Isn't A step u have to do and there are 2 steps One With The Turret One With A deployable Shield
---
My opinion is that you should stop bitching about it. You earned it the hard way and you know it. Good for you. But it doesn't hurt anyone that they made it easier. So why waste time and energy on this. Makes you sound like a fool.
---
Dude ikr mozzie and gridlock are great and nokk is a blast
---
Imagine being a rook main
---
And now it can reference crab fight!
---
Yikes. I'll grab popcorn for everyone.
---
Legendary from alphapacks , not elite
---
Lion‚Äôs gadget act more like cav‚Äôs interrogation now and doesn‚Äôt have wall back abilities,m. Also the time you can see the enemies‚Äô location is shortened but the waiting time is shorter as well
---
No outline anymore, just the operator marker above you (like when you run out or when cav interrogates)
---
Where did you get the information?
---
Rogue9 tweeted about it and said he tested it and it isn't gone.
---
Well some people send death threats to the people who wants the new guns lol...
---
Classic fuze
---
Ikr everyone is so sensitive
---
But in all honesty no one here got offended as far as I can see
---
yeah, ubisoft most likely wont do anything like this. most of the time when they add stuff or make any changes its bc a pro player or a copper told them to do so
---
The fuze ace
---
Your entire team
---
The entire defending tea,
---
The hostage
---
Are you fucking dumb or something? The kamikaze name it self implies "god wind" squad that was purely designed and instructed to ram a american navy and if they refuse, they were excuted at gun point and drugged if they had to, not to mention many of the pilots were koreans, philipinoes, vietnamese, and even chinese who were forced to fly the plane. Even the very same japanese empire admitted this was f-ed up tactics and half of the command were against the idea during, and after the war. How the hell attaching a suicide bomb squad's name on a video game that portrays elite "good guys" fighting terrorist and training is not offensive??
---
EW WTF THIS EXISTS?
---
That overheal saved your ass lmao
---
What platform?
---
I just can't believe that ubi can't make these things into sth you can toggle on or off. Is it that hard?
---
To quote Rogue9: 
---
 Deployed gadgets work just like before.  It's only laser sights, gun sights and some gadgets like Vigil's cloak and Pulse's scanner that are effected and now you get a timer that helps you see for how long.

Ahh forgot to mention,it‚Äôs PC
---
Ah! Good ol‚Äô days. I miss the older one more
---
Lmfao
---
controller inputs at bottom? yea instantly closed.
---
Have you checked NAT type. Sometimes on type 3 (strict) it blocks VoIP.
---
Imagine if that actually happened and jager had swastika on his shoulder, and portray GSG-9. The damn german government would send a formal warning and I am dead serious and sure about it. They dont even mention or allow public display of it. And you, as a american, think that's cool?
---
Isn‚Äôt it a one time purchase?
---
Yes he is actually is. Prob why he doesnt tell what is in the cannister
---
super annyoing to play against. Nuff said.
---
Bc it's not being praised, as I said earlier if you were paying attention. It's legit a historical symbol on the side of a gun, nothing more nothing less. You're not running around as a fucking bushido kamikaze warrior killing innocent civilians dude. Calm the fuck down
---
Imo thats the best headgear thats ever been added to siege lmao
---
No one is laughing
---
Those WWII camos as well man, get me mega triggered...
---
As stupid as this sounds, hear me out. They literally made the operators more zoomed in/smaller just to show of..wait for it..the new white background
---
i hope no one thinks i'm here to actually interact with y'all, just watching you incels get offended made me feel good abt posting this so yeah, i just said what is happening and no one is giving out any actual critique or defense so yeah, i feel good so far.
---
My favorite part is that the mute didn‚Äôt even die
---
Tbh I think they have an ok reason why we haven‚Äôt seen a new gun in a while.
---
I wouldn't say battlepasses are good, atleast for a game like siege. The difference between cash only lootboxes and battlepass is that you need to spend time to achieve it even though you paid for it. I would rather have cash only alpha packs rather than battle pass.
---
I'm well aware of the German restriction laws asshole. And I, as an American, would thinks its fucking badass to be running around in an authentic ww2 German soldiers uniform in rainbow.
---
No,it‚Äôs always NAT2
---
i am ashamed to be black after reading this monstrosity of a post
---
I fondly remember the days when you could see the whole operator artwork in the loading screen
---
New op: Clayed
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
I'm so sorry
---
I haven‚Äôt played in probably 2 months
---
Lol at all the brexit party votes*......... Yeah
---
it is when the level up system is shit.
---
he has the P229, the Echo and Hibana pistol
---
The ones that fit our preference. You won't get better by setting it exactly the same way that pros have it. And even they don't use the same sensitivity.
---
Have you updated your graphics drivers? Often this screws up the in game voice comms as it updates an hdmi sound component and sets this to be the default comms device. Has happened to me (with Radeon) and my buddies quite a few times. Just think other people's mics aren't working until someone else says they can hear them fine when I can't.
---
In windows, check what the default communications device is, it may well fix this!
---
That's why you don't play with touch pad
---
Bullshit. Link the post in which this exact joke was used in the same way.
---
The thing that rubs me the wrong way is that there was no prior communication about this to people who bought the season pass. If I had known I shouldn't expect 20 new guns for my season pass this wouldn't be an issue and I would probably still have bought it. Now it feels like they just wanted the money from people who buy the season pass because they like learning new recoil and new guns and who wouldn't have bought it if they knew they would only get 5 new guns. I feel cheated.
---
I‚Äôve never ever thought about it before, but now I am triggered.
---
750 dpi idk what sens and a corsair harpoon
---
Hahah Tachanka funny. I upvote
---
Ahahh
---
Just cuz I‚Äôm curious. When you say good primary.... you are referring to which one?
---
Dammm that's awesome
---
Step 1: Buy scuff
---
Step 2: Don't even know what to do with it. Isn't that something you think of before buying something like that? smh...
---
Both. I prefer the Commando because more bullets and cool reload but I know that the P10 is good in the right hands.
---
She's the only 3 speed attacker with a shotgun.
---
You sir are genius.
---
I Rate This So Much! hahahah YES THEY DO
---
Ah. I see you are edumacated. Sorry for doubting.
---
Why should I ? I know there have been more than enough pointless posts about this skin. No need to confirm that. And I sure as hell don't care if it's the same joke.

I hearts literally dropped at the endscreen because it said that we all got dropped to unranked. Fortunately it was just visually, but we didn't gain or lose anything
---
Might of been a couple posts about this skin. (I searched) but none that used this joke. Don‚Äôt act like your pissed off about a fuckin repost when it isn‚Äôt even one.
---
Realised its too late to credit the artist and im an idiot for not but im unable to edit the post so this is me recognising his work  pericotes is fucking gr8
---
Appreciated.
---
Next update -&gt; black blue beautiful background becomes all white because f your eyes

1. you only need around 2, maybe 3 hours to get lvl 30

2. alot of people complain that the ranked level is WAY too low.

Firstly what platform do you play on

bs, I got 4 hours and I'm only level 13.

üôÑ It's.Refreshing.Seeing.New.Guns, I just like seeing new guns being added because you get used to the same guns so it's nice to see them add something new..its not even a big deal.. it won't change gameplay at all for me.. its just visually nice to see a different design of a gun you won't be able to shoot in real life, idk man.. do you want some kind of crazy game changing reason
---
Oh ok. He's fine then.
---
One thing you can do though, is send a package with sparkles and hearts and stuff on the box, and make sure it's clearly from a man. He'll get endless shit for it
---
Well, for me the reconnect is about 15 sec or so if I rember (100% less than 60 sec) correctly so it is sth on your end.
---
I'd settle for more than "it's lit".
---
I just don't see the big deal. Then again I've played cs for nigh on twenty years.
---
Make him the heavy from tf2
---
First off all. How do you know its a kamikase reference? And second of all....yea no thats just funny how you are offended. Carry on.
---
You realise they have to buy the licensing every time they add a new gun which is expensive
---

No, no.  Dog fur is now #1 priority.  Even the launch of Ember Rising will be postponed.

Why not just make selection screen same or close to aftermatch screen? With all cosmetics and stuff.

You posted this twice

Just search for a match it will retry instant to reconnect

Echo is, but after removing the shield from Maestro but leaving it on Echo, there won't be a reason to pick Maestro over Echo
---
Holy.... Absolutely LOVE IT

( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn\_wTeLSQIg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn_wTeLSQIg) )
---
Even if expired they‚Äôd still have to buy licensing and besides they‚Äôre giving a new outlook to the guns themselves for example nokk‚Äôs gun is smokes who is a defender putting a defenders gun on an attacker could give a new outlook to a gun that is very rarely used
---
Why?
---
I only run default on Alibi, and until they can find a way to "fix" this, making any skins for Alibi is ultimately a waste of time and resources, trust Ubi to make an Operator that makes clones that don't actually look like the operator.
---
As many ppl have mentioned by now Claymore was her actual gadget rather than the stun grenades. 
---
TBh, it's going to feel little awkward for me since I've been alternating between breaching charges and stun grenades. Suddenly missing stun grenades gonna feel weird for me at least. 
---
Now only if Ubi's willing to change her to 3 Speed or something so she can flank better to actually justify picking her over other Attackers.
---
Hey you're that dude from the krunker sub.
---
where's the 1v5 ace match point pistol only dude
---
The sprays through the walls were pretty cool imo
---
At least it would be less bugy
---
Yeah. But not really nervous about guns
---
I haven't played the new season yet but they are distracting, especially when there's an elite card next to them
---
It says it‚Äôs blocked in my country, I live in the US.
---
After 300+ hours I encountered my first hacker, with this exact wallhack
---
&gt;:D
---
This is reddit where people love complaining and calling others overated
---
Smh obviously that won't make a difference. He *clearly* just had gaming socks
---
Oh, that's interesting! Where have these been released?
---
Shit netcode more likely, I play on 2 ping 900+ up and down.
---
I want this
---
I loved the maestro tight hipfire spread even while full auto. Was my favourite thing about the Alfa. Although it is still amazing, especially in 1vx situations.
---

Yeah this is pretty cool

I got a little scared when I saw the word tower though

I haven‚Äôt tried it yet

The last time I played was early Operation Para Bellum.
---
Oh dam
---
Not to mention her being 3 Speed means she actually rotate around faster than Nokk once the cams are down and has much stronger guns as well. 
---
Nokk really does nothing better than IQ in every scenario.
---
Not sure, I just keep up with rouge 9, here is a video that shows year 4 season 2. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IPPCk58TaWA
---
That's IT?
---
I'll be sure to check it out :)
---
IQ is not underpowered. She has an average win rate with an above average pick rate. She is in a good spot.
---
I rarely play Blitz but I bought that headgear just for the times that I do
---
Also kafe got a rework (to get up to speed on new maps, head into a custom game by yourself and familiarise yourself with the changes)
---
Eh not anymore than Maestro's LMG does, since that's 35 damage and with an 80 round drum
---
enemy ac130 above?
---
Muzzle brake can be decent on automatic weapons with high first shot recoil. I use it exclusively on Buck. The hardest part of his recoil imo is the initial shot, then you pull straight down. I'm on pc so take what you will from that.
---
Hahaha I wish my aim is still trash with pistol
---
I think I've said this exact line before
---
He killed the vigil with the nade but saw goyo with the drone
---
So you're Credit jacking the guy ( u/BlameTheAliens- ) who makes sure the actual Artist gets credit...
---
Looks like she's tryna infiltrate the secret facility but the clapping of her dummy thicc ass cheeks keeps alerting the guards so she has to use earthquake.
---
Still waiting for the acog on doc's stim pistol
---
It‚Äôs a real bumpy ride.
---
Watch your damn mouth, mate. Twitch is still thick.
---
I don't see Valk cosplays too often
---
Sry bro but she lost some, I'm sad about it. U should come in France u'll see lots of thicc twitches
---
But clearly not if you drag the hostage into goyo's fire.  So the team switch isn't perfect atm
---
I still think there should be a few seconds of invincibility for both side at the start of a round.
---
There either isn't or it's not good enough, since dragging the hostage into goyo's fire causes a defender loss even though it was the attackers who put the hostage in a damage zone
---
destroy the infinity stones before tachanka as thanos gets them.
---
Kaid gay, u shud have done papa italiano

But for real kudos that amazing stuff

Sounds pretty op

#TACHANOS
---
I feel like her gadget in combination with the shotgun is what makes her so dangerous. She not only gets a notification that someone's there, it's also harder for the attacker to hit her precisely
---
‚Äúso much more than all aim/no brain‚Äù so you‚Äôre saying your lack of aim with mouse can be made up for by using your brain?
---
**Nomad has joined the chat**

Thanks for crediting the artist!

When I'm about to sneeze I usually sneeze.

it's a intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 k
---
True!
---
(glad you got the reference)
---
I think OP is trying to say he‚Äôs been restarting the queue for 30 mins
---
So hi,
---
I have these Frame Drops every now and then (maybe every 10-15mins) and I don't know how to fix this issue.. I've tried reinstalling multiple times and messed with different PC settings (nvidia control panel and stuff like that) and nothing helped. Maybe someone knows how to fix this.
---
Setup:
---
Gigabyte Geforce 1050ti OC
---
Intel Core i5-2300 @ 2.80 GHz (Quad Core)
---
12GB of Ram and playing on a HDD
---
Looks so wrong wtf
---
I know one friend said that even reskinning a gun would make it interesting, but that could have serious backlash too
---
Yeah I deleted it, I forgot to check the rules first
---
Because cat's are lazy. Just like echo with this Yokai.
---
I guess Heavy is also just big boned
---
Dam they want your soul.
---
What is ts? Is it test server
---
i did in the comments somewhere because i forgot too in the post title
---
^(they're just standing there)
---
# menacingly
---
I totally agree with this . Otherwise hire mods that hunt down posts that post people's arts without crediting the original artist
---
Love how they all pushed from one hallway. They weren't even expecting you even though you were on site.
---
ez
---
Well yeah, AT rifles were designed to pierce tank armor, shooting it at a person is telling them that their free trial of being alive has expired. It'd be balanced out by only having two or three rounds.
---
oof
---
Anyone else hate how people announce his name incorrectly all the time? People always be saying "Kai-d"
---
Looks like something from my nightmares.
---
Because he is too situational defender. Thats I think. But impact smoke was better idea!
---
I really fucking hate Kaid look at his stupid icon and his stupid face. Fuck you kaid. Please bake him and send me a video of him burning in a hellish inferno.
---
He is stepping on some books
---
Or hostage.
---
Maybe just a Barret 50 cal and not AT
---
shield? what shield?
---
It‚Äôs wrong and he‚Äôs taking advantage. Really it shouldn‚Äôt be there because the attacker has no recourse, but there‚Äôs also no reason for an attacker to try to sit on the edge of the map. Being there offers no advantage.
---
It's not a Warden specific thing, it's every defender. My God this shows you how fast misinformation travels
---
My bad.
---
Unless I'm remembering it wrong, they did say something along that line. Like Amaru isn't from any CTU, right?
---
Again, if I'm not mistaken, they said they are focusing more on storylines for basis on the ops (just as what they said during the panel at the Invitational).
---
I have quite bad eye sight and this will strain my eyes even more. I hope it isn‚Äôt like this in the official build. I‚Äôm a Valk main.
---
This advice works for newer players
---
But OP has over 1,000 hours . He‚Äôs definitely practicing bad habits he needs to change his gameplay
---
 7 kr
---
I still miss it on the SMG-11. Never forget

Yeah sorry my post is very poorly worded

i honestly dont know why they're doing this tbh

You go to the subreddit and click the ... icon and than change user flare
---
Hello Johan1307, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Yes I should have added that too, each gun shpuld feel unique rather than a better version(M249 SAW)on or just a ripoff of the previous guns(like the shotguns).

My aim is not bad
---
If you have trouble early on with PC controls you can plug a controller in, but obviously you‚Äôd be at a disadvantage. Also casual can get quite toxic so be ready (you‚Äôre a league player I doubt you care)
---
Nokk‚Äôs main role in my eyes is detecting cams.
---
Looks really cool, it has a cool mixture of punk and patriotic spirit
---
I'm pretty sure they can't change only one weapon or else they would have given Tachanka an ACOG, his and Kapkan's SMGs are linked.
---
SAS Shotgun is best shotgun.
---
My number one op for attacking is Jackal and i personally love his weapons and his gadget either makes the defenders paranoid when tracked or making irrational decisions. So i got to go with Jackal.
---
Goyo is funny in some ways. Since he's the only operator whose devices can be triggered by anybody and hurt both parties the same, if the accounting mechanic is like with Kapkan, you can use the shields for teamkills without getting punished... that'll be interesting. (If they switch the mechanics and the person triggering it will be made responsible, Goyo doesn't get the credits for kills by his gadgets. Probably more sensible, if a bit unfair.)
---
hahah lul acog joke funny. definitely not beaten to death
---
The Alda. Only fun lmg in the game that can be competitive.
---
No I would play her
---
I suppose these complaints might be irrelevant by the time ember rises drops, I only complain about the recoil because before grim sky her recoil was at least manageable, right now it has a lot of horizontal recoil that is very difficult to control with a controller
---
I mean, it's never happened to me
---
ok
---
No the one we have now looks better
---
good for you
---
To much head room
---
To be fair, you won‚Äôt see it in defense thunt anyway, because they don‚Äôt try to take the hostage, they just shoot them.
---
Finding Martha
---
Tweet #docstimacog
---
If you really hate thunt, just use really shitty ops like warden for a long time, you'll be able to zip to their head the frame it comes into view, and you'll play better because you know you won't win engagements.
---
Question.
---
why doesn't IQ need frags?
---
Generic names like "MP5" etcetera are just general names given by the military. They are not licensed. Most guns already in the game aren't licensed, and to get around this - they leave out any manufacturers' tags.
---
Ak-12 
---
Wanna use that beast of an ar on Capitaio for maximum fuck you
---
ah right, I could see how the term nut could be taken negatively.
---
a 50 bmg can? what's the .50 bmg rifle do you own? that's cool as shit.
---
wait a second...you use discord light mode? now this, is an avengers level threat
---
Region?
---
Looks like Gavin Mcinnes
---
Where could I find it
---
I want warden to have the mp5 with acog
---
Yea same, just hope they fix elas recoil one day :/ sad to see such a fun op shorthanded by the community
---
Just spray at his shield, as nooby as it looks half the time his shield doesn't work so you have a pretty good chance at hitting him.
---
Yes it is a joke, the m4 is way better
---
The issue here is that the load times would be drastically increased and we'd be waiting a lot longer to actually load in. Especially those of us who are on console would suffer the most
---
Were you just given recruit?
---
You know there is Pick&amp;Ban right?
---
The operators? Its just on the Test Server right now. If past history is anything to go by, probably in a couple of weeks or so.
---
In casual
---
And I don't  see that a lot of concept art but now I kinda do and this actually  way to late
---
Fair enough. I don't really give a shit what the loading screen looks like tbh. Just annoyed that people post this monthly for easy karma and everyone falls for it.
---
Weu
---
I've been playing Casual to rank up my smurf and I haven't been tracked by a jackal once...
---
Had to pause it and figure out what player model it was; It's Capitao.
---
You lucky fuck 5/10 games I get tracked its bull shit.
---
Lmao they wouldn't have given tachanka an ACOG...
---
All they have to do is make the gun into 2 guns with the same name and different attachments. Ez.
---
Because Amaru isn‚Äôt from a counter terrorist unit
---
Actually Maverick is part of a real life CTU delta force and clash is part of scotland yard, Amaru isn't part of a real life CTU I thought she'd be part of FAP.
---
the in game CTU for them isn't real but they're from Scotland yard and delta force while Amaru isn't from a real exisiting CTU only Goyo.
---
I really want to know what happened after the Outbreak Event, so yeah. Maybe this time we'll get to fight the Patient Zero cosmonaut that they scrapped.
---
It's part of the game, if it annoys you just stay in obj.
---
There is no difference for your actual character model, it's only different from your perspective.
---
Whyyyyy!!!!!! Omg I will see Sofia again, Who suggested this idea to them!!??
---
I mean I like the CAMRS, it has 0 hipfire spread
---
-4
---
So dont play 50 percent of this game got it
---
added to the list
---
Damn, I would join if I had the time.
---
*laughs in purposely using shit guns to improve aim*
---
Should be included in GeForce experience.
---
Then not on thunt. i remember seeing this in multiplayer before warden
---
Its ok, maybe another time :D
---
Yeah, just updated them yesterday
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted, this is straight up facts spare the occasional player who uses non-meta guns.
---
or FAP even
---
Not the Point, Jackal is perfect where he is.
---
My rule in R6 "You don't need to have the best aim, it only needs to be better than the other guy."
---
YES. More people need to be saying this. Ubi is killing Siege.
---
She will destroy the EDDs only . Yes , Because twitch doesn't produce heat
---
Yes, because if they are using ops from in the current game, Warden will be useful, all they have to do is make a zombie flash you and go ham. You'll be able to use him I tell you!
---
Fucking phenomenal
---
If you look at the ranked stats page in the game it tells you what reward you're going to get.
---
And I just got my first ace with him. Hell yeah!
---
Thank you everyone, I‚Äôm going to try out everyone‚Äôs recommendations and see which one fits the most for me. :)
---
Hammer time!
---
Actually it's a 3D scene with 2d images in an orthographic view.
---
The pictures might be 2D but the but the background isn't. Volumetric fog, stage and all.
---
When Ubisoft changed it they said they changed it for that reason. They don't really have a reason to lie here. Why would they go through the trouble of redoing the loading screen then. And load times did improve after these changes.
---

Yea, I realize my mistake now, but I was just saying from personal experience.
---
What are you trying to say? There is a priority for thing the community can critique? Fair enough if you personally dont care about it but to a lot in the community it's a ugly design choice that they will have to see every round in a game, why not ask for ubi to fix it? Just because it's not the most important thing? There are always going to be more important things doesnt mean we cant work to fix the little ones.

I‚Äôm the Nokk, who‚Äôs horrified because my friends can be stupid as hell sometimes üòÇ

---
#*fingersnaps back into reality*
---
It's time to put our differences aside . Lets be friends
---
A game mode/ event would be cool. 
---
Play as characters with new abilities, like the new leaks for Halloween,  and possibly cosmetics, not like the ones for other alpha packs, where you can get them individually or in a bundle. 
---
For example, Mozzie could be ant-man, as he is tiny.
---
Thank you!:) i think i‚Äôll leave it the way it is. My main colors are gray, black,green and red. It wouldn‚Äôt fit in :c
---
Killa wore the maska helmet better
---
Keep in mind that this is a game made in code, and swaping a weapon wpuld be as much of a change as adding a new weapon,
---
Adding or removing a certain attachment from a gun for just one operator just doesn't work, because then ubi would have the same weapon code twice but one has an acog and the other one doesn't
---
All in all a good idea but from a coding perspective it would be a waste of recourses that could be used for actually fixing the main issues of the game
---
Tru that would look nicer too
---
I don't mind reused guns, I'm excited to use mira's vector and kaid's shotgun on a 2 speed.

Well yes but keep in mind that if you use her ability wisely, or even m3Ta aBus3 then shes wery strong.
---
Darn, they have to model and make animations for new weapons. Not like they've been doing it for the last 4 years.

Well ask Microsoft/Sony about it . They are the ones who allow such things

Yea he's just repeating a bogus conspiracy theory that Marvel tried to kill comics characters that they didn't have the movie rights to to empower the MCU.  It was peddled around the middle of the MCU when all the other super hero movies were sucking and failing as an excuse for why Marvel was kicking everyone's ass
---
She already seems rather strong, and we don't need to buff an above average operator. I also don't think that 2 sound cues should mean the same thing. Shattering barricade already means someone could have come through the window, I don't want to die (and I don't imagine others do) because I happenned to guess the sound cue wrong.

I'm OK with reused weapons, as long as they are good for the characters. IMO Amaru and Goyo's weapon options make them exceptionally fun, as I adore the G8A1 and vector. But next season and more importantly next year, if we don't get at least SOME new guns, I can't say I'm buying the season pass

All of those are except Echo and maybe jackal
---
how often does that happen? Ash mostly uses her gadget offsite, to open walls, barricades, barbed wire, or take out shields.. A few other uses, but for the most the jager's gadget requires direct LOS to Ash when she fires to destroy the grenade. also, even then, the ADS destroys 1/2 of her gadget, and she can yeet flashbangs to burn the other charge. Mozzie actually TAKES OVER 1/2 of Twitch's utility.
---
Twitch meanwhile can be locked off her gadget by quick mute placements in unhittable spots. or just blocked off by Mozzie, or shields, etc. etc. Twitch's gadget gets worse the higher elo you get.

This isn't League of Legends. The game is not balanced primarily around pro league. This is why Jackal was nerfed, Echo was nerfed, so on and so forth. Ubisoft consistently balances around ranked, while also making some pro league based balance decisions.

I wanna buff for zofia that makes if cav tries to interrogate her while she's withstanding she stupxles cav also awesome drawing.

Oh my it's beautiful

Pulse looks like he heard some bullshit

The explanation for the SAS one is that the gas masks your wearing as anyone but smoke dont have rebreathers equipped and the filters that they have installed in the masks are probably too weak to filter out whatever is in the cannisters. Smoke DOES have a rebreathing unit equipped and i have no doubt that his mask has the correct filters installed.

Huh. Doesn't seem too bad.
---
I don‚Äôt believe these would count as they are just props and decoration. If someone didn‚Äôt want their item there they would probably replace the weapon with another one.
---
Have my upvote again :)
---
The question suggested you believed Ela's recoil was changed. If anything you're good at being wrong as it wasnt. The question hints you thought it was. You were wrong about that. It wasn't, the sights were chsnged. That's not necessarily a buff for people. Nor is it directed towards a single operator. So really Ela was not changed the game was changed. Not her specifically. But the way the question is worded makes it wrong,  that's why you're wrong.
---
She dont call me brother I'm mister dicklister
---
They are mini Miras though. Yes you can technically see through the slits but as they‚Äôre so small and quite misty, you can instantly tell someone is behind one, meaning they act, play and work like Mini Mira Windows. 
---
And Zofia and Ash (maybe not at pro level) will definitely be picked more. There are not many counters to these shields but Ash and Zofia can do a good job of just denying the shield any use as it would be destroyed. They will be mandatory (they‚Äôre picked nearly 100% anyway because ash is ash), to help combat the shields. 
---
This is why to me the changes make sense. They‚Äôre both so strong already and making them a must pick virtually, does mean they should maybe get some small tweaks for sure

There really isn't any legal ramifications, furthermore Ubi doesn't absolutely have to licence any of their guns so long as they don't have branding or they are named differently than their real life counterpart- Ubi also doesn't really have to license to any gun manufacturers because of a court case they'd won from a gun company demanding money for a licensing agreement and Ubisoft won that case by arguing that it goes against freedom of expression, and because of that many of the guns on RB6 are unlicensed to begin with.

---
Ah, but if it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs there, then can they be implemented into the game. As when it comes down to it, the only true, unalterable, aspect of adding a gun is the model
---
yes
---
Popular Marvel villains :D
---
Yep. Once i send ticket to ubi support and cheater get banned. So its works.

Don't change it drastically cos you will completely wipe all previous muscle memory. Gruntastic on YT has a great guide for resetting/ finding the best sensitivity on console. I suggest you watch it, I have tried it twice and it has worked tremendously both times.

But it also depends on bbs aim, can he use the possible split second advantage to kill j√§ger before he dies?
---
Exactly the comment i was waiting forüòÇ
---
Having a useable prop and a art prop are two completely different things. There are also no tags claiming for that gun to be what we assume it is while the guns we use on operators are named (even if the names are changed like the CAMRS) it‚Äôs still a functional representative of someone else‚Äôs property.
---
You mean "step" bro
---
What I recommend is is change your V:50 H:70 ADS:30 and then go to T-hunt and play for a while and adjust it from there.        
---
My Sensitivity is V:50 H:100 ADS:30
---
well, they'd say "oh well its still a video game that involves shooting" no matter how many times i'd tell them this, but they'd keep on saying the samething
---
For me, I usually grind out ranked to hit my rank, then I generally try to play as much comp as possible, such as scrimming teams, playing in leagues or weeoly tournaments. Because of that, I'm used to having a dedicated support drone me as an entry in and they clear the way for me. Maybe I'm overthinking the comms used in ranked, as I di agree with your point that no matter what happens, Ash will always be picked in ranked. I feel like an attacker 3 speed with an assault rifle such as the R4-C will always be good, even if you remove 6 bullets from her magazine. Maybe instead Ubi should nerf the recoil, or maybe lower the fire rate?
---

The amount of Smurfs in newcomer is unreal. To them it's just an 'easy mode' lobby.

It isn't as simple as just adding a model they have to do animations and then stats- but I agree with you, the only reason they are doing this is to save money on work even though they are making a ridiculous 1B$+ profit a year off of only RB6.

No worries it‚Äôs a good meme tbf

---
That really doesn't matter in the end tbh, Ubi already won a case that argued that gun licensing in video games goes against freedom of expression and consequently many of the guns on RB6 are not licensed.
---
Like dont get me wrong, the split second advantage can be used very good but if i can tell you one thing, its never more dissapointing when a doc with a revolver one taps you trough your shield.

Whether you meant it that way or not that's how it came off, clearly to at least 12 other people.

&gt; That point on the map takes about 10 seconds to get to if you sprint to it immediately. It offers no tactical advantage except for a straight-view if the window that he got shot from. 
---
Ah, seems like there's more to it that I don't understand because I haven't played the new map.

Now this sounds like you're going back to blaming people who get killed by spawnpeaks. I don't know the new map but I do know that there is A LOT of windows in the new Kanal, I could very easily see how it would take you at least 11 seconds to clear them all, and more likely around 20-30 seconds before feeling comfortable enough to move forward.

Reusing guns like the G8A1 and FMG9 is a great idea honestly. These 2 in particular because it basically is a new gun because they got basically no usage before being added to the new ops. I hope we get some proper use out of the P90, AUG, AugA3, MP5k, 417, Ak12, Spear, etc..

---
That's a good point - it would be the first operator that is using a passive gadget/skill. That's definitely something to consider and I don't know if it's a good direction to take the game.

However, I think having a few more "basic" operators would be nice.

Pretty sure the bottom line was that they are not physically reproducing their goods, only that they were making artistic representations of it and that art is protected by freedom of expression, however if you find more on it lemme know.

Here's what I don't get. Why didn't warden get Ela's shotgun or the ISTL from the Geo? Two good shotguns that don't see much representation in the game. Instead he got the shotgun that 4 other operators have..

Never heard of an Ash Rush?

I mean then you‚Äôd just wind up with someone who is arguably a better spawn peeker than doc considering the AUG is designed to maintain it‚Äôs accuracy and range over longer distances than all the other SMGs in the game. Not giving it an ACOG was probably intentional
---
Thank god its not another console clip.
---
Their new policy from what I've seen is, it'll only be on semi-auto weapons for 2 speed defenders.
---
Warden is absolute garbage right now, the mpx isn't that good I don't know why he doesn't have an acog
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a shit situation, you either have to wait it out or take the L
---
Because they‚Äôve said ACOG would only be on semi auto weapons and valk with an ACOG would be legitimately broken
---
Wow, thank you I didn‚Äôt know that lol. The only shotgun I actively use is the M870 for memes, The BosG or the SAS shotty
---
It's actually because the licensing costs are getting way too high. There are wayyyy more guns in siege than probably any other shooter, lets just be happy with what we have.

How‚Äôs it lazy? We can‚Äôt get a new gun every season or the game would get to complicated. We got 2 new operators with 2 different unique abilities which should be good enough. Goyo got 2 guns which before we only available for kaid and Mira so his guns are still pretty unique. The attacker got an lmg only available for iq and got to put a suppressor on the shotgun. 
---
They reworked a map, added a new game mode, patched glitches (even tho more will be found lol)  and yet all people care about is that we didn‚Äôt get a new gun.
---
It's also a crime. It would be lovely if they would actually attempt to prosecute.
---
*sorry for video quality
---
I'm pretty sure any of us could do the tts if we had a computer that could run it, i think you just have to have a purchased copy of the game linked to the ubi club or something like that
---
I used them for about 4 years, before I eventually took them off. Least for me now, I got better aim without them. But it is a personal preference, since I don‚Äôt have large hands like guy above me^ mine are like alien hands lmao
---
If you‚Äôre ranked 199 you are not 1st.
---
Glad that‚Äôs not happening!
---
Really awesome clutch! What rank do you play at?
---
I don‚Äôt mind the map. Is it out of ranked or cas too
---
I solo queued yesterday on ranked and got placed in a match with only one other teammate. I think we actually won one of the rounds. I was pretty pissed off during the game but I only ended up losing 6 MMR. I think I went like 8-4 or something
---
Depends on the state, in some you can get "tax stamps" and permits to modify weapons in ways that would normally be illegal without them.
---
It's a pain in the ass though and can take years. Have a buddy that had to wait 2 years to get the right go-aheads for a 10" AR-15 &amp; suppressor. Dude's as clean as a whistle too, and knew the firearm seller and local police well.
---
As an airsofter and R6 player I love this picture. Also if I‚Äôm not mistaken that is a UKArms M14 EBR. Such quality üòÇ (good for cosplay, not for airsoft according to Rev)
---
Could you imagine how strategic you would have to be with Jager if his gadget zapped all projectiles, including friendly.
---
Knowing Jordans heritage this is a very Irish way to deal with the problem btw.
---
Just not a grappling gun!
---
Wait a second was this pic pre season phantom sight
---
who deuced in your cornflakes
---
So you‚Äôre a copper 4?
---
100 hours lol
---
Probably will shame it‚Äôs just tts
---
Vpn to which country? I'm canadian, it said unavailable, so i vpned to US before seeing it wasnt available for US.
---
Looks cool. Good job.
---
I‚Äôm more disappointed I can‚Äôt see the ending due to being in the US of all fucking places.
---
I know it‚Äôs just a joke it‚Äôs bugged but you can come watch the stream later :)
---
Are you confusing the ADS with something else?
---
that is funny bro i am going to laugh
---
Would like to see Nokk‚Äôs card.  &lt;Laugh&gt; zoomed in image of burlap.
---
Yeah I meant testing on our own platform. My friends just got it for PC and said the TS automatically downloaded after the base game for him. 
---
I have a laptop but there's no way it's running siege hahaha
---
This should honestly be a punishable offense. I swear people do this on purpose in lower elo ranked games just to get maybe 50 elo. It's dumb.
---
isaac gang rise up
---
This is a bathtub...!
---
It's not bugged, they reduced the Elo for every rank to test the champion rank for a few days.
---
Just seemed like it was, does jager have explosives? Don't know if it was an edd
---
Only on console...
---
Nah, not realy xD
---
Montagne has enough
---
Thanks man)) And right now I‚Äôm in my elo peak at high silver, low gold( Though I hit plat for the first time :D But toxic friends didn‚Äôt help when I was gaining and losing 50 elo a game haha.
---
wow that angry post was on here for a grand total of 30 seconds. i hope it was worth it
---
yeah no thanks, I don't want Valk with an ACOG. that shit would be broken my guy
---
Fact: dont spawn there, unless your monty
---
 I can‚Äôt recommend them enough, I have the wide faced concave MW edition ones for PS4. I think these are the longest they do, my hands are on the larger side.
---
To anyone asking why:  
---
\- I like the overall map design special with the 2 towers
---
\- the lighning of the map is not fucked like on other maps
---
\- i like the way the objectives are places and its fun to eather attack or defense on this map
---
\- for me and my squad it was always a balanced map
---
\- the way defenders can rush both towers at the beginning of the round is unique but is high risk-high reward
---
\- (for me atleast) its possible to play uncommon operators and strats that pay off
---
To anyone who doesnt like the map:
---
Can you tell me why? I only recently noticed people dislike this map, i always thought people like it
---
i posted a statement c:
---
He does look like a college student
---
Tough luck
---
I'd try some blood berry pie, I'm a little hungry.
---
I remember there was a guy dressed as Tachanka at Hollywood Sports.
---
It's not that bad, Mozzie is actually taller than someone now.
---
Im gonna snort your grandma‚Äôs ashes
---
- recoil on the MP5SD is much better and headshot is headshot
---
- can reposition drones
---
- can easily deny plants
---
- won't even noticed most of the time
---
There‚Äôs gonna be an unranked game mode so it‚Äôs gonna be ranked but you don‚Äôt lose or gain any Elo and don‚Äôt rank up or derank. So hopefully only the cool people will play casual still and we can live happy ever after
---
No you can not. Nobody wants to see that mongrel multiply.
---
Download Windscribe, make an account, and set it to UK, France or Germany or something like that, buy R6 credits, turn VPN off.
---
Aw man kanal top floor barely resembles the original map. What a shame.
---
Because it would also give valk an ACOG to it has to do something with the game engine I believe
---
I definitely agree but I tend to find the chaos of chalet an entertaining break from more serious maps.
---
That's not what I'm talking about. I'm saying they're giving more people a reason to cheat.
---
I'll try and let you know if it works
---
too late already did it.
---
You know that it's actually proving my point, Echo is perceived as much stronger and thus always banned while Maestro isn't.
---
Balancing operators around "it's banned anyway" is not a good idea.
---
Just download TunnelBear VPN, it's free(for 500 mb a month). Then just change region to Germany before you launch the game and keep it running in the background.
---
Once the game launches Ubisoft support will mail you saying you logged in from a different country. Just ignore it. 
---
Buy the credits, make sure your Steam overlay is on. 
---
Once your purchase is confirmed(with an email confirmation) quit the game, turn the VPN back to your region, close the app, and there you go.
---
amd? ouch
---
Why the fuck dokkaebi hiding doritos under her hat.
---
Fubba from Borest Gump
---
It's where the main menu screen is set
---
Next time just use the search and at the top and search 'parking', we don't have to see this exact post 300 times an hour
---
I have an R6 soundboard app, and one of his taglines is "Fuck, grenade!". This particular soundboard is one that, if you press one button multiple times, it wont just overlap the old sound, it'll just repeat from the beginning. So I just press the grenade one a ton of times to make him say, "Fuck fuck fuck". Its hilarious.
---
Thanks for the input...
---
imagine if this was the reason
---
iPad reddit. Oof

HÃ∂oÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂ Kaids mad

Didtn see anything here :)
---
y‚Äôall called?
---
RIP Bombers. I will miss your jump scares. :(
---
haha
---
So satisfying, especially with Alibi or Maestro
---
I have one friend that plays rainbow and he constantly gets mad when he dies,even if it‚Äôs a completely fair kill
---
More like *"ANGRY KAID NOISES"*
---
He literally has more kills than my main on my account because people don‚Äôt get creative with the turret
---
I don't know how you feel about it but in my opinion, that meme is ded.
---
Potato PC noob, blyat.
---
but he was the toxic one who tbagged... what are you trying to call him out for??
---
I heard you talking shit, BOY
---
Meme might be dead but his gameplay sure as hell isn't
---
Meme isnt funny
---
*4 VS 5*
---
I'd love to see a spin off called Rainbow six siege: Bandit gets revenge
---
Blackbeard was a tank who would obliterate entire teams. There wasn‚Äôt a real counter to him besides C4.
---
&gt;survives a headshot
---
looks like siege alright
---
If the enemy team knows how to use a drone, he sure will be.
---
What rank? Dirt?
---
Hi this is not the FBI can I just have your address and a suitable time for us to raid you thanks
---
*3 VS 5*

Tachanka: *two shots people with a turret*

Ubi: Worst operator in the game!
---
Notice what
---
That‚Äôs a epic gamer move, good job.
---
Is pulse on some MD because that jaw is swingin
---
As nice as itd be, they're a bunch of shekel hoarders who want you to spend as much money as possible on all versions of the game. They'd more money if they enabled cross save. Plus, I dont trust their programming either.
---
The noises coming out in the end
---
You now what, the mpx is so shit why not give valk an acog
---
No not yet, thats a future thing becuase its difficult to redesign smoke propagation, simmilar to how long it took to redo fire spread
---
I feel like as much as anyone would deny it we've all five something similar at some point.
---
Captain Marvel OP ubi plz nerf.
---
Why does it have to do anything? It's just a level that means nothing after level 30, what is putting you off?
---
Pulse looking like he took a mad dump
---
Aw man great edit anyway
---
Valk/Mute so I can be busy with utility, especially with Valk...my mind goes to bank where I put cams in the far sides of the map.
---
That's true. But often there are the most toxic people ive ever seen before online
---
I should have mentioned I‚Äôm more of a casual player but I‚Äôll keep this in mind when I do play ranked
---
Yeah this event was exclusively for console
---
I guess I did have to put a /s, silly me thinking reddit could understand a joke.
---
So Basically OG Glaz? His ability was Originally just Zoom toggle, until the Meta became ACOG everything so Ubisoft added the Thermal effect as a buff.
---
Except that was Hostage so no one will care
---
When a multiplayer shooter has better story and world building than story based single player games

Dude every legitimate criticism on this sub gets downvoted to hell. It's a common trend.

Astroturfing isn't a conspiracy theory. It's a real thing.
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)
---
They‚Äôre still OP tho
---
There‚Äôs a thousand and one metaphors you could have put and you had to choose a politically charged one? Nah man. Just don‚Äôt bother.
---
I just do t hunt for earm up... Don't see a need to rework it
---
**Astroturfing**
---
Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection. The term astroturfing is derived from AstroTurf, a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word "grassroots". The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a "true" or "natural" grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a "fake" or "artificial" appearance of support.

Don‚Äôt use laser sight
---
Judging by the sound it makes, it's probably a harpiscord. Although I never tried shooting at a piano, so I don't know what that sound like.
---
It would still be better than that new one
---
They say if you play the right notes, you win instantly.
---
The BEEG one
---
God damnit
---
I dont anymore this was from a couple of weeks ago
---
I would like a last team standing situation for the game where you just kill the other team and after 4 minutes everyone's health goes down to 1 for an overtime situation.
---
thanks man
---
Yessir
---
Amaru is definitely the Peruvian bird/snake cryptid. Still no clue on Goyo.
---
I thought it came from the crab rave with some text overlay saying "obama is gone"
---
I'll support this only if we also add favela back to ranked rotation. now you might think i'm crazy, and you'd be right, but nobody should be exempt from the pain of sites that literally have more exterior soft walls than you get reinforcements
---
Thank you, you are a good man.
---
Dont forget the gas can right next to the grappling hook.
---
I'd be down to play in a little bit but keep in mind I'm not the best at this game, I've only been playing casual lately.
---
Pulse looking as special as I feel playing him.
---
Or flanking.....
---
Pulse looks like clone Stewie in Family Guy
---
They removed Favela twice now. The first time they lied and said it was to fix the issues wrong with the map. It returned with zero changes.
---
People can choose to play on these maps. If they don't like them, they can requeue. It's one thing to remove them from ranked. To remove them from a CASUAL playlist where nothing matters is asinine. And it's doubly ridiculous when it happened in a year with the least amount of added content yet and has had more content removed than added. Great evolution right there!
---
You may have to restart the game to get the option.
---
Dont forget the ones that walk in front on you in a fire fight. Then get upset about it when they get shot for it.
---

Shoot, I meant to sign up a few weeks ago, how long is the current waitlist for the reposts?
---
Wheres homeless
---
Until less than a year from now when I guarantee you they remove hostage and secure area from casual.
---
If you read the patch notes, they explain why
---
The next rainbow six won‚Äôt be out for like at least 6 or 7 more years I think lol. The devs said they want to support t for 10 years
---
They changed the mmr requirements for each rank so that they can test out the new champion rank. All the ranks have been reduced accordingly.
---
Vote Kicked initiated: Captain Marvel 3/4
---
Yes or No
---
I'm getting kinda tired of seeing this image posted here at least once an hour.
---
They reduced rank requirements to test the new champion rank
---
Goyo is a widespread spanish name, a person bearing this name is believed to be accurate and resilient. Maybe, that's it?
---
The 10th most likely...thats 3 weeks after test servers just like last season
---
Do you happen to know the song in the video?
---
 Until less than a year from now when I guarantee you they remove hostage and secure area from casual.
---
No
---
absolutely my proudest fap
---
Statistically it‚Äôs as balanced as bank. So.... objectively the complaint about it being unbalanced is wrong
---
I don‚Äôt see that happening. What leads you to believe they will do that?
---
I actually did something like that almost a year ago. It was definitely worth it.
---
They won't. Seeing as they are the casual gamemodes that are playable in the casual playlist.
---
The fact it is just a levelling system that does nothing but lock you out of Beginner and access to ranked. It's a potential mechanic that can reward players.
---
It‚Äôs a pin from Fanfitgaming.com and idk for some reason they don‚Äôt sell the blue or any other color than yellow
---
Favela is a garbage map and it 100% deserves to be removed from the game entirely. They should never have brought it back at all. "Don't like it just requeue." is really stupid to even suggest. If a map is so bad that you even consider requeueing just because you got it, the map shouldn't be in the game. There's a difference between refining the content already in the game, and just removing content for no reason. 
---
Quality over quantity.

Theres one on outback called Brick

With the name info I could track it down in two seconds.
