Hmm?

I see nothing

They shouldn't be allowed to kick a low level for doing bad, they can't expect much from a low level :(

Wow I just started using it yesterday too
---
Ying is really great too tbh. 
---
Thank you!!
---
Yes! My friends don‚Äôt get this. Bomb is the true test of skill and tactical ability for both offenders and defenders.
---
I'm a secure main, though I honestly find bomb easier. Idk why.
---
By... Not playing with bad teammates? No harm in getting son people go play with occasionally
---
Imagine lying
---
Rushing in immediately that'll show 'em
---
That was not a one tap and also please stop spawn peeking
---
I'm with you, I feel the same for most streamers, I can't stand them, everything about them seems forced, fake and they are flat out annoying.  
---
The whole "That's just his character" is bullshit and isn't an automatic pass for being a cockhead.

Bruh, what am I missing here, what did you clean your room or something
---
Haven't seen this myself but maybe they go AFK to increase the alpha pack meter
---
Did that once and I woke up 3 days later with a 30 day ban. Still dont know what I did
---
What and get rid of the shorts no way man how else is he supposed to carry his soup cans
---
It has a higher rate of fire than most other attacker weapon outside of outliers like Twitch‚Äôs FAMAS, which is the dominant stat in short range corner fights.
---

---
This defines N√∏kk‚Äôs playstyle by making her worse at holding longer angles (due to worse dropoff, damage per shot, and lack of ACOG) but her gadget and SMG rate of fire means that she can get the drop on defenders and fight on equal terms at worst if prepared properly.
---
Especially the gadget, which means that both observation tools and noise, which currently define a humungous portion of R6‚Äôs defender advantage, are no longer 100% reliable methods of catching attackers before they enter your line of sight.
---
The Deagle is also basically a mini DMR without optics. Sure, it‚Äôs no SMG-12, but with a muzzle brake or suppressor it‚Äôs probably one of the strongest semi-auto secondaries in the game.

No matter what rank you are or level, there is an underlying rule you may not know that always applies, "clutch or kick"

TK is only one vote. It only pops up for the person that gets TKed. Vote to Kick is 0/4
---
That should only apply for ranked though, because losing in casual is no big deal
---
This was posted less than a year ago by someone else, I‚Äôm not calling you a reposter since I‚Äôm guessing this is your own clip, but I thought I‚Äôd let you know üòÅ
---
DATA LIMIT REACHED
---
Ah, I see they've put more yellow paint on, the old one was definitely wearing off.
---
Ok cool! Thanks a ton
---
You put one thing in the title then something else in the description. What do you want?
---
[removed]
---
Not my fault your grandpa was a filthy zipperhead
---
If you want to tell the whole siege community that, you can, but good luck. Idgaf if its casual or ranked, I wanna win and get xp, renown and a chance at a pack and that's pretty much everyone
---
Not just Testservers. Casual servers have alot of this right now. Idk what happened with R6S after I‚Äôve been away since I got my ranked on the current Season.
---
Bonus points if it's the Elite mat, how anyone falls for that is beyond me.
---
R/woooosh
---
I think I just live a pick up put down lifestyle.
---
You cant kick in ranked, nor receive new teammates
---
Speak for yourself.
---
Bomb site is CCTV and Cash lmao
---
Hmmmm
---
Supposedly, her current icon was going to be changed to the one shown, following ubisoft announcement that they are removing depictions of skulls to cater to Chinese market. They later decided against it because of the community‚Äôs backlash.
---
Oh yes
---
Iq is fairly balanced already but that could be a cool idea for a different attacker
---
No thanks, I'm straight
---
Basically attacking mozzie but better
---
I say no
---
Also Lesion not Legion
---
I love winning too, but I'm not the kinda person that would get mad at a teammate for not winning, I see that as bad sportsmanship
---
Just increase the force applied by melee, but to all objects. Punch a door? Wood goes flying against the opposing wall. Hit a player? They go flying 10 feet in a ridiculous ragdoll that makes no sense.
---
Water bottle whit drugs

Do the situations. If you get 3 stars in all 10 you get a quick 6000 renown which you can use to purchase a bunch of base ops.
---
Thank you man I appreciate it !!!!
---
You think I don't know that? I inferred from his post that he was talking about the garage site on secure area, because he says "that site" when the OP is about garage and there's no mention of Cash/CCTV.
---
Idk, it never happened to me with Mozzie and Gridlock.
---
Garage is defender heaven cause of all those pixel peeks
---
No, that‚Äôs just a visual bug that happens during the killcam. Happens to all the shields in killcam.
---
As far as I can tell, that kill wasn‚Äôt sus.
---
happens to me every time since burnt horizon started and i play a shield op. I don't think the enemies see you like that, i think its just a killcam bug, like raptor legs
---
I don't hate it, per se, but it's kinda disappointing to have the other three SAS members in sweet, tactical gear, and then have Smoke not match the set. 
---
Maybe I'm just overly picky, but I'll still pick it up.
---
Hidden pixel peaks are fucking aids. Glad it‚Äôs gone.
---
*uninstalls*
---
I feel like somebody doesn't have any 1 taps to share...
---
is it ranked? if not just tell them to kick the dude.
---
Why is Korean font always different from Latin alphabet fonts even when it's being shown on a copy localized in one of those Latin languages?
---
is this copper gameplay? lol
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty easy fix once you contact support. Your account isn‚Äôt legit broken. Good luck
---
Is this a new op?
---
It's less than 1% of a wall but you have to pay real money every time you use the gadget
---
I don‚Äôt remember if this was cas or not
---
It's the blue/black or white/gold dress all over again
---
Thank God
---
I dunno, I'm still trapped on PS4 :(
---
What do you mean barely? It covers 80% of that room. Also the rooms are: closet, master bedroom, stairs, and the storage room if you open up that wall.
---
Nah, I'm not creative enough for that lol
---
i fucking despise tower
---
In my opinion, both looks really good, but both have pros and cons. The newer one looks more cartoony, but the way the yellow paint, assuming the ‚ÄúX‚Äôs‚Äù were created by yellow spray paint, looks more colorful than the other, because of how the paint was applied. The older one looks like it was made from older wood and looks like the yellow paint has been rubbed on and discolored, giving the illusion of reality.
---
You forgot about wireless too lol
---
Burnt Horizon, is out, right now, as we speak
---
you really have to question why it is animating every time it loads and why they didn't render it once and just have it play...
---
Ok that‚Äôs good thanks man sorry for being a waste of time you‚Äôre time or anything
---
Burnt Horizon is out right now, it has been out for 2 months
---
I'm doing God's work keeping you low leveled scum out of my casual games.
---
They were for a while, but Ubi reverted it for some reason recently.
---
I listened to it 15 times with some astros.... 100% don‚Äôt hear a thing
---
Please ubisoft.Hear our voices.Give us some attention and we wont make you regret
---
what's up with that dep shield as well in that pic... it's sideways...
---
No, release fate for y4s2 I need
---
Why'd they change it? The old one looks so much better.

I agree 100 percent. I really enjoy the idea of this game and how tactical it is. I've been getting sick of arcade feeling shooters and this game feels so much better than the others out there. It's heartbreaking to be continuously beaten down by my own team. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one who has gone through this. Thank you for your reply.

"continuously beaten down by my own team"
---
Whose fault is it that you aren't queuing up in a 5 stack with mates as Ubisoft recommends? You are supposed to be playing with mics on Discord and partying up with in real life friends to play Siege. Not solo queuing with randos.
---
The Wiki still cites him as 36.

(I love the animation)

Holy shit how dumb are you?

I own a PC and agree with everything said in your essay. Just all my friends are on PS4 lmak

(Still gonna buy the elite even though it makes 30% sense)

My opinion on the elite: DEGENERATES LIKE YOU SHOULD BE HUNG ON A CROSS
---
A problem caused by guns not shooting actual projectiles, but a bit of data that sprays in a bullet-like patterns. So you can shoot though microscopic holes.
---
[deleted]
---
Okay the wiki says 36, then it says he was listed originally at 1990, THEN on the release of the game he was changed to 1981...and nowww....

Goddamn this is a shitshow

Ur rank only resets every season.

Sorry for late reply I know they don‚Äôt want afk players but if you are it would just be a nice quality of life change like I‚Äôm watching YouTube then go back to game and I‚Äôm loading in the when I check and have 1 sec to chose and get a op that‚Äôs not useful for that obj or a kaid when there‚Äôs bandit

Year 4 season 2

I'm pretty sure around June for the summer sale

Alot of ideas were dumb including boxer(i don't get what the gas would be except BO)
---
What‚Äôs awesome about dressing up as a glorified furry
---
Cant hear it, heard a similar sound but it came from my friends mic
---
This is cursed
---
Perhaps maybe put in a setting to hide stats if the player wanted.
---
he's such a pussy.  I cant stand him
---
This is just a concept piece. The artists were probably just having fun building a sort of personality for her. She wasn't "supposed" to use anything, they were just generating ideas.
---
Sounds like the start to a siege themed porno
---
Wtf
---
TJ√òP
---
Ight shut it down
---
You got confused. We're in year 4 and season 2 which is the spring one
---
I completely understand the game is supposed to be played with 5 of your friends. Regardless that shouldn't give people a free pass to kill, kick and torment some random teammate. I play on Xbox and I honestly don't have any friends who play this game. I've played team based games in the past and have had fairly decent time solo queuing with random people. I totally get that there's those toxic crappy people out there, but this experience has felt borderline unnecessary. What's saying a group of randoms can't experience the game for what it is and get along? That's all I'm saying. 
---
I don't feel "persecuted" by any means, it just feels like since I'm new at the game I'm getting singled out in matches. 
---
I know solo queuing in a team based game isn't ideal and isn't the proper way to play, but why can't randoms follow along and just leave me alone?
---
Except, A lot of other country's have multiple units as well. I can name them if you like? Canada for example has like 5. 6 counting CSIS.
---
Also what worse problems are there? The games been out for 4 years. You telling me they haven't fixed everything wrong with the game by now?
---
YES!!! I wish you could choose between the 2!
---
TRAITOR
---
Well, Ubi cant do that, bc then if you are 3-0 down, you could just have your squad tk(If ur in a party), so that tou lose less elo(To boost)

Honestly if it was a boxer I would still not buy it but at least it's a sure fit in his known story.

Thank you for your response. Just knowing I'm not the only one makes me feel better

I love the slow-motion body flying through the air
---
Bro just scroll past or use the search bar lmao
---
YES!!! I wish you could choose between the two so bad!
---
all the major exploits should be removed by now so I'm not sure what you mean.
---
I think you are sorely mistaken my friend it was still easy to knock out if you knew the tricks and nuances to it, but now it will be extremely easy as we will be able to simply watch for a peak and if it doesn‚Äôt come toss a couple flashes and a drag and it‚Äôs over

The new ones are ugly

Controllers almost got broken
---
Holey shit now no more acogs pixel peeking from that balcony. Maybe makes a first floor or garage door approach a bit more viable now. Cuz it‚Äôs usually storming in from cctv and thermiting the wall open then clearing balcony.
---
I wouldnt complain if they did that.
---
Just the way the community is you gotta take your lumps but as soon as you‚Äôre level 30 and confident of you skills jump into competitive because it‚Äôs much better then casual
---
She likes the tire so much that she‚Äôs hugging it

Haven't you been in public school? The only way to survive is to join a gang, any gang. In Siege, the equivalent is the 5 stack of friends.
---
I mean, we have glaz for a sniper and tbh one is enough just based on the way the game works. Yeah it‚Äôd be cool, but I feel like it‚Äôd make it so much more of a meme-y game with a stealthy bitch trying to nosxope or quick scope ppl.
---
He‚Äôs banned in pro leagues. He is a intel gathering operator, but has good guns
---
Even the art team wants a bolt-action sniper rifle.
---
Devs, just give Glaz a new sniper rifle!

You seem like the type of person who liked the last Jedi

there's like 3 cosplay posts dude, I haven't even seen a gridlock cosplay what the hell are you even bitching about.
---
Should've been the way from the beginning. IIRC, they have that feature in Arma 3, Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, and possibly Insurgency. Implementing it would be a nightmare though and Ubi probably wouldn't bother.
---
Siege is doing great on console my kind sir
---
Looks like a gillie suit mask.
---
This is useless
---
shouldn't this go on the TTS reddit?
---
On XBox, there will probably be a free weekend, in the second half of the coming season, which will probably be around July. Those are always accompanied by a sale
---
Pengu has said outright that he would lose to Kanto though
---
Dude, I get matched with 200 and above ping in almost every game.
---
Anyway, just wait a bit, didn't Ubi announce the Asia server thing last time before pausing it? Eventually your server will be the PRC one, so that will help your ping.
---
Is the Tachanka Spot still possible?
---
No they don't need to make it happen.
---
Nah, you might be lucky or something but going between PC and console. Even on ranked console players troll and act stupid in high ranks
---
How did you do that!?
---
I thought my friend and I were alone on this one
---
wait really they are removing secure? why not hostage
---
Most ghillie suit netting has much larger squares than that.

I was reading it as ‚Äúcav‚Äù in both the original comment and your reply and it was REALLY funny

Blackbeard doesnt hunt drones

No it isn't the equivalent of that. Use your mic to tell them you don't want it reinforced.

Plot twist: wins the next 3 rounds, AND two in OT cause the Lord never fails

Thats a legit strat i dont see why that would go away. Irl it would work and theres no balence issue with it.
---
Thanks I will

I wish they would show wear and tare on the weapons. Could base it off time played in hours or base it of the season you first logged on.
---
Hey that‚Äôs enough to buy the new underwear you‚Äôll now need.

He‚Äôs okay, but better on good hands but he‚Äôs just a little too good. He‚Äôs more of a situational operator.

THEY WENT FROM SPRAY PAINT TO BRUSH STROKES, THE FUCKING TEXTURES DON'T LINE UP ON THE TOP SLAT, AND YOU CAN STILL SEE A PART OF THE OLD SPRAY PAINT TEXTURE ON THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF THE X...
---
THIS IS A DISGRACE
---
I have so many questions.
---
This... Does put a smile on my face
---
Lmao the reaction of every mozzie in my team when a drone is on my jammer.
---
Exploits are just as bad
---
Capia?
---
Those non-bomb "diamonds" have nowhere else to queue when they play ranked now, so statistically you'll be running into them more often now when you solo queue ranked.
---
Most likely. I only did it cause it was easy to recreate in Adobe Illustrator and got extra credit for it... ;)
---
There's a different spot now, but there is still a peek in dirt.
---
Another sniper would be a pretty terrible design. We know the troubles with glaz so I don't think that's something they wanna tackle again.
---
If you wanna see your Elite Animation, I guess a common response will be...Git Gud?
---
lol

Lol wut

Isn't the artist name in the top left?

&gt; Also if you look at the season survey's this sub does you see that ~70% of respondents pick bomb as their favorite mode in general (so casual and ranked). If you narrowed that down to just ranked it would probably be even higher.
---
&gt; This sub is not representative of the playerbase at all.
---
The majority of the playerbase doesn't even play ranked, let alone bomb. There are a lot of ranked players purposely don't play Bomb so they can dodge all the good teams. Usually the same types that play with smurfs on silver accounts to boost each other.
---
Thanks lol

I get a constant almost 70 with Vsync off, which I always have off.

You don‚Äôt need to be warden to see through smokes gadget

Well then I recommend just playing the game a bit more and as you learn the operators you will learn who‚Äôs on what side.

That worked. Thanks.

Plague doctor shit is overused/overrated

Yup, it worked. Thanks

Same here pal

Because I haven't seen that kind of ping before and I wanted to share it to the R6 community

Can't seem to find it. From what I remember it might be in their OoT series which is really long, also remember that Dan did say it a little jokingly since Arin and them are friends and all...
---
What‚Äôs wardens ability
---
Haha no but I looked at him waiting for it after. He didn‚Äôt hit the toxic stage yet I guess
---
Just take out the SR25 and give BB both variants
---
This does effect Bomb players. Secure and Hostage have been used to dodge high-level players by bad teams and earn ranks people don't deserve. It also hurts queue times for everybody by splitting the playerbase into 3 queues.
---
Now everybody is on an even playing field. Ranked queues will improve drastically. Ranks have more worth now that you can't queue Hostage and mow down lv60 noobs for free ELO.
---
You can still play Secure and Hostage in casual, just not in ranked when it matters. It's no different from removing uncompetitive maps from the ranked map pool.

ah i see you are a man of culture as well

Nah man im pretty sure it is killing the whole enemy team in csgo its like that. And it has never been a special Number cause different games have different amount of players in the game
---
But in all seriousness being on xbox for almost 4 years now,people tend to "avoid" people with those handles
---
Where did you get this?
---
I feel like doke is already in a good spot but if i would be for a buff it would be to give her some sort of a full auto primary.
---
they are trying to brighten up the game for competitive integrity, if you notice the new clubhouse rework, the dark areas of the map are a lot brighter than before

Looks like they don't water down their yellow paint anymore!üòÇ
---
All bald men with beard and glasses look the same. Change my mjnd

Regardless of whether or not this was concept art or an actual idea that was scrapped...  
---
It'd be really game-breaking. She's supposed to be the offensive Cav or Vigil, right? The Attacker-Roamer, who passes under inspection, who stays silent and mysterious, yadda yadda yadda.   
---
Why in the hell would they give her a rifle that's (I'm assuming based on the title and picture) comparable to Glaz's? She's stealthy, up close, sneaks under cameras, etc. etc. Why would she be way out in fuck-all nowhere with a sniper? No one would be able to see her regardless.   
---
It makes far more sense for her to have an SMG and a shotgun(?) if I remember correctly. Close up and personal. Not my playstyle, but still cool and going to add a lot to the game. Honestly if she had a sniper rifle I'd be disappointed.
---
if you could say it like that, problem is that I rarely touch bandit, I much prefer Mute that fills in a similar role but better (imo)
---
counters dokkabei when near his jammers, neat jammer spot on Oregan in the basement, etc..
---
although I must admit it looks really cool on the MP7, one of my favourite guns thats sadly on an operator which I dont really admire
---
Eh honestly bb is in a weird state, 
---
If you like playing on/directly next to obj get mira, she can be a game changer on the correct map, and can turn the tide if played correctly, mira is situational, but you also need a certain amount of teamwork (not much) but some. 
---
I would recommend Mira, because she brings something to the team while bb is more of a fragging op, doesn‚Äôt do much but kill.
---
Choose according to your playstyle, we can't help you
---
Depends on if you want a new attacker or defender. I like em both.
---
I would say Mira blackbeard‚Äôs shield is useless
---
Got chat banned because I shot myself in the foot thinking it would make it so these losers couldn't spam my inbox. Boy was I wrong

They need to address people peeking from the soft wall in dirt picking people off on hot tub wall/balcony.

This is definitely unfortunate but it's alot of communities everywhere you look etc there will always be a bunch of senseless trolls amongst us.. It's up to you obviously to rise above and press on my fellow kind soul!

Are those just screenshots or actually image files from the game? My friend enjoys using castle and I was wondering how to get to the image files.

Hear hear comrade. Hear hear

Jesus christ kid, read the fucking post and stop trying to brag about rank, literally nobody cares. You act like a special little puppy. Rank has nothing to do with this, I see it in clips all the time but I've experienced it only a couple times the entire 5 years I've been playing this game, the last time I saw it was today in a clip right before i wrote this "unpopular opinion" post. I can tell you have to ask for aces because of how butthurt you're getting over this.
---
I'd say Mira.
---
Heisenberg?

Honestly? I think his elite is great, stop with this Pleague doctor, he doesn't have anything related to it

Watching him buy all the Blackbeard cosmetics, then get into a game and refuse to use his shield because "he doesn't like the shield," made me hurt inside.

At least wait until you have *looked* at the characters abilities before splurging...

In what way would this improve something?

Oh, so you dont have a dad too...

I‚Äôm talking about the gas cause it‚Äôs toxic if it touches skin and his arms are exposed but I genuinely think if fits in with his chaotic personality
---
Less recoil
---
Yeah okay but who cares
---
I agree. Also of you do a certain amount of damage on someone and they get killed by someone else. It should still count.
---
900 renown is not true
---
There is on T-Hunt but not in game.
---
300 renown + 190%

I‚Äôm not sure the kids understand this format lol
---
I agree! Never understood why people liked plague doctor so much, I've always thought it just looked ridiculous. What we're getting fits Smoke's background so much better.
---
It's good to see so many people in this thread that are also happy the elite set isn't plague doctor.

I wish we could do it. I got Chalet 4 out of 4 games I played today.

It's not generally practical for most military situations. Ignoring the transparent version, there is a real variant, though you're more intended on setting up somewhere with it, and I don't know if anyone's actually adopted it into real world usage:

Do you also shoot in casual?

With warden you have to stay still and have minimal mouse movements or the ability will go away. You‚Äôd be an idiot to start shooting your tracers through smoke standing still.

Very, very popular but not widely spoke about because Fuze is underpowered.

But it still falls to second overall, since despite the 850 rpm guaranteed 3 shot, the f2 with it's 960 rpm still lands 4 shots in 184 odd ms, and will still down a 3 armour quicker than a 3 armour can down twitch, and it kills 1 armours quicker than the ak12.
---
But, yes, in terms of ads time, consistency and sights, the ak12 shatters the competition.

Yup!  After I did this I went to r6 fix to make sure it was already there.  Thanks for all the hard work ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
advantage: attackers below can't shoot echo / maestro when they're watching porn
---
disadvantage: defenders can't look through the gaps and shoot enemies below rendering their pornographic phones more useful
---
A kill is a kill. If you rage over ks, you don't get what the game is about. If you think you deserve a better rank should you also get to choose what charm you get at the end of the season? Just to make sure every stat in this game is irrelevent.

Illegal spawnpeek smh. At least it'll be patched before live.
---
I can‚Äôt disagree with your first point, but what exactly do you think is lacking in secure that makes you say it has no place in a competitive playlist? I personally think it‚Äôs perfectly fine for competitive play. They‚Äôre both solid game modes and I just can‚Äôt see why they both can‚Äôt stay.
---
And think of it this way, how would you feel if Ubi hypothetically decided that secure was going to be the ‚Äúdefinitive game mode‚Äù forcing you to play it over bomb? You wouldn‚Äôt be happy right? And if you‚Äôre not happy about it, there‚Äôs a good chance you might stop playing the game. To me, it‚Äôs not about which one is the best or right one for competitive play (and there‚Äôs a fair argument for both), it‚Äôs primarily the community‚Äôs happiness and what they‚Äôre gravitating towards. I‚Äôm just hoping something like this doesn‚Äôt result in a drop in player count, and I feel like there‚Äôs a good chance it might. A lot of people I play with think it‚Äôs complete bullshit what they‚Äôre doing - it doesn‚Äôt feel good when something you enjoy is being taken from you.

Oh damn, ill give that a go dude

A good MGTOW picture.

It almost sounds like people who only like to play secure area, enjoy a more CASUAL experience.. just saying..
---
I was hoping that i would buy the game again in order  to use my steam money on an elite skin or something 
---
If i do will it effect my progress?
---
I thought he was white?
---
Both! At least thats what the chat is telling me about my dad
---
Want a Nokk, but get a Vigil
---
He‚Äôs gonna blow himself up like that
---
In a way, yes you‚Äôre right, secure is a milder experience than bomb, but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a competitive game mode, and it doesn‚Äôt mean it should be removed. I‚Äôll put it this way, if casual secure felt like and played out like ranked secure, I would honestly have zero objection to taking it out of ranked, but the reality is, casual secure blows and is nothing like ranked secure;  it feels like something really good is being taken away for no good reason, and I don‚Äôt like that. I think it would be best if ranked was split to secure and bomb and you would have two separate ranks for each game mode. That way everyone would be happy, and we won‚Äôt have people losing interest or abandoning the game, that‚Äôs really my only concern.
---
I have a better idea: punish chronic leavers. Is you leave every once in a while for any reason, you won‚Äôt get punished. If you leave every 3 games, then you‚Äôll get punished.
---
So using legit strats and team communication is bad? Look mate, I'm sorry if you don't find me and my teammates working to boost my performance rushing in objective very fun, but I don't want to lose every game.

Like I said, I'm ok with it, but it better provide more than just recoil reduction. As in, something more interesting that would make it more than just a breach tool. Something for consistency of shots.

- **kopalnia** is the kind of mine that you send miners into so that they excavate it for resources (e.g. coal). The word for a mine (landmine) that is an explosive trap activated when someone stumbles into it is **mina**.
---
- **rozmieszczanie**, while not incorrect, is not the most suitable word for **deploying** either. A more suitable one would be **umieszczaƒá**.
---
Then you have to remember the correct forms of each word. The end result would be as follows: Umieszczam minƒô!

I was actually looking for a way for live chat. But couldn‚Äòt find it. Must be pretty hidden, so that people like will never bother them:p

Well, if counter strike can do it...

I could help you with that.

Nokk, Dokk, Jackal, Lion, Blitz = new toxic meta
---
When are we getting the Year 3 Operator Bundle though?
---
Also back then (not sure now) if you stood remotely close to the fuze charge going off, it would kill you
---
yes. please send more of those naughty images.
---
That aint right, poland aint slavic
---
when I click through the support site, it leads me often to the page where I can submit a ticket. Couldnt find an option for live chat yet.

I rushed in as sledge on heford base I bust open a door with my hammer and to my immediate right was both cav and vigil  and I managed to get cav but vigil killed me

Thatcher is based on a currently available technology, just in a compact format. IQ? I dunno about how real it is, but doesn't sound unrealistic.
---
Then we got? Lion's bullshit drone that see your movement through multiple layers of concrete, steel, wood etc.. Finka with her global superpowers, Jackal who can see your exact location based on a single, minutes old footprint, Hibana with her exploding fidget spinners, Gridlock who somehow managed to store shitton of lego-traps in a small canister, Lesion with his sticky-bitchy mine that somehow turns invisible. etc.

XD ja

---
I did it once when I bought my alt account, but it got boring after 2 games stomping on noobs with recruit. So I just went back to casual anyway. Only 3 maps in the queue. Kinda boring anyway.
---
Did Adidas sponsor this?
---
Fuze is Kazakh and Finka is Belarussian, so there are only 3 actual Russians in R6.
---
Yeah, we in Poland actually have slavs in our meme culture. Ale jak w√≥dka tu jest taka solidna?

I think it's partly because that's all that's allowed at LAN

I'm still trying to hit gold, and I'm almost on year 2 of my playing.

You would probably have a better time just playing casual and not newcomer...
---
Speaking of Astro.. I have the Astro A10 for over 2 Years now and i'm still blown away of how those things perform. The Microphone which is used is just ridiculous for a headset in this Price Range (75$).
---
Friends of me spent 250$ for the A50 and they regret their Decision now as they heard me on teamspeak lol.

Oh boy. I cant wait to play against the same 10 operators for a month and also watch everyone fight over who gets to be Ash/Jager.

I want to send you a screenshot to show it to u

I think people are theorizing that she is a princess  or somthing.
---
I will usually place a drone at the end of the path that I intend on entering, then when I walk to the building, I‚Äôll drone in reverse so I can pick that drone back up.
---
she lacks in utility Warden was given an SMG-12 and Nokk should have been given the C75 auto as a secondary SMG.
---
Gadgets don't have to work properly whenever you want it to. It's called balancing and situational timing. 
---
Warden is a situational operator, his whole point of concept is to stop or delay the attackers when they try to conceal themselfes(to plant for example) with smoke grenades, or flash the objective to rush in.

No this is just stupid.

Sometimes I wish that the ash skin that they gave for free should have been ela's skin.

Give me a link.

I would appreciate it a lot if you can!!:)
---
Yikes did she get the interro?
---
that would make a lot of sense, considering it would be a show if her identity got out. so someone of a higher standing in society could really be possible. but then again, it mentions as if her father was never really around much, but is still commendable as a person.
---
I was actually thinking the exact same thing
---
No I dinked her ass but still, she fucking terrified me and I then went and hid in a corner to catch my breath
---
And a hat that says Kurwa!!

Never did think I would see it lmao

Just give the proleague map pool.
---
And with Theme park and Outback. These two are fairly balanced. Themepark only has lighting issues.
---
On too of this add Kafe

That makes it 7 pro league + 3 maps. That's 10

Can confirm some new guys get a bit amped up the first time they work event security at conventions, but a bit of extra safety awareness never hurts an event on that coin side.
---
I say this, but on the other side, one con I got stopped a bunch of times while supervising the first floor guards because the cops thought my gun and baton were too real looking and it took me a bit to convince them I was the head of sec on that site and not in an outfit meaning they were, in fact, real.     Stopped working the con circuits after that and because I really missed doing the cosplay thing myself.

No shadows are pretty good on xbox. I don't know what it is compared to pc but I get a decent number of pre fire and wall bang kills because of them.

I use Mute for defense alot instead of Caveira when I'm on a map I don't know and Bandit always zaps the jammers

Tripaloski

Not a problem either but the leaning is crazy
---
And I know going on Yokai and not getting shot was a a bad play and pretty lucky, but BB was full hp and I didn't want to peak him when I would die to one shot.
---
thats a oof of my part
---
Yeah I assumed it didn't work that's why I made notice I didn't have an argument and agree because all I play is secure.

Looks like corn

How about you try to be a devloper and predict every single bug that could occur

It‚Äôs Cav, only a spooky bitch like her could father someone as equally spooky as N√∏kk

I remember when people said blackbeard was op

Why iron sights?
---
So was it a back rub or shoulder massage?
---
It's literally a coin flip.
---
It will always go to OT and the one who gets defence first in OT will win.
---
I recommend you start playing bomb. It's a totally different game on pc and a higher skill gap.
---
I always vault up on the red car in junkyard and shoot random shots through that window, I kill someone all the way back in dorms way more than you‚Äôd expect...

no maestro/alibi t hunt

I mean what operators should I get first

Main account got banned (lvl 60) so I‚Äôve been grinding to get back to ranked and play with the bois

Okayy

His rifle has to have a variable optic with that scope

Jager‚Äôs 4-16 with a Holo, Angled Grip, and Linear Compensator.
---
AHHHHH

Nice argument
---
To me i feel like it's really great.

Enjoy being a massive douche who has 0 reading comprehension:)

Because it's ranked, not pro league. Try to get into pro/challenger league if you're that bothered.

I wish

Isn't it n√∏kk? Wait, do anyone outside of Norway have √∏ somewhere in their keyboard thingy?

facts

A Denmark crown prince was part of the ctu nokk is based on so this would make so much sense

But a acog is better most of the time
---
Automatically assume anyone that mentions BR is a kid, okay lmao. I'm 20 but whatever. Also actually like read through the comments before just assuming what I mean.
---
*the baba yega*
---
I used to be a Jager Main but then i lost his touch when i kept using other operators
---
Because it's competitive.
---
If you don't want competitive people can go back to casual 
---
And even Ubi said they want ranked to mirror proleague.
---
I mean.... this strat requires that cav not to die... the enemy team not to check for kapkan traps.... and Just really isn't viable lol
---
The skins are getting out of hand.  too many arxade shootem up style skins. And they help you stand out more in the game.
---
Can we get real skins ubi?
---
If i wanna use a scope it either an Acog or Holo.

Super great, not enough love on this.

Thanks buddy!

Yeah, that happened a lot too. Or, player runs around, dies, quits, never gets replaced.

I loved the visual look of the new Caf√© Dostoesvky. Looked so much cleaner than its predecessor.

Depends on your software. Most people have ShadowPlay which takes 1-2fps, at max. I'm not so sure about ReLive.
---
I did when I shot it at a drone and picked it up at the same time on TTS
---
Yep so I‚Äôm wondering if cams can still stick to it

Exactly
---
Yep, kill themselves if their champion loses...they obviously know he is on his own. That‚Äôs how real terrorism works.

But valk is a 2 armor defender, she wouldnt get one.

well, they just responded but not being helpful at all by guiding me to send a ticket ( where I still didn‚Äôt receive any response yet). Whole day almost gone, and I might never see my money again or the purchased R6 Credits. =_=

Is xbox really worse for r6 compared to pc and ps4? I know the game is super toxic and now that RFF is live it seems almost impossible to play with randoms... unless they're on the enemy team and just keep throwing games but that's not really fun either
---
F.
---
ok
---
I meant you can practice now with bomb in the main build with bomb only on in preferences.
---
I was scared of the switch too, but I had to because I was moving out and the PS4 was actually my little brother's, so I had to play on my own PC instead. Three seasons in and I can say, both console and PC have their ups and downs, but both communities can be amazing if you ignore the toxic people.

attack and defense terrorist hunt
---
Damn it I should've thought about that...
---
So IQ doesn't sound unrealistic but Lesions gu mine which is based off of actual chiense technology isn't?  And hibana with a more compact version of thermite? And Finka doesn't even have s +qqquperpowers, all operators on attack is injected before the simulation with nanobots which can go off when she activates. 
---
But a compact heart beat detector is more realistic? Or a shield that can blind people? Or a drone with a mini taser, or a canister that can hold multiple grenades that only explodes when activated? 
---
We know people liked the good ol days of r6s but don't bash the newer operators for being unrealistic when many of the base operators are too. Plus if we want to be realistic in r6s. No way they can hold 2 reinforcements, infinite barricades, their gadgets, and their guns. But they can because it's ultimately a game. The gadgets aren't suppose to be modern day because then it would just be a lot of nuclear type weapons. Its suppose to be based off out there technology that is being researched or developed and then add a bit of creativity in there.
---
That why i said he needed new gun like mp5, p90, mp5sd or 416c if they don't buff his speed though. If you give the mpx the acog, Valk mpx will have it too cause that how r6s engine work, reason why lord don't have acog.

There supposedly is an MMR hidden. The attempt is to have you at a 50% win rate, just like every other matchmaking system.

I had a guy threatening to kill my family, but since he wasn‚Äôt swearing it was A-ok. But when I tell him ‚Äúplease leave me the fuck alone bro‚Äù I get banned for a month. It is so shit

Well overkill went bankrupt so...

Gridlock went to hide  the body

Yep I guess so !  
---
Anyway, wish you luck for the diamond man ;)
---
thats exactly what i use, it‚Äôs insane, i get at least 2-3 kills a round with it
---
But even if everybody same level in the match, a full party could win you because they talking in discord and have more information than you. Usually, when I play as solo, I'm trying to talk with my teammates and give them the info but they always silent. And I'm convinced that it will be fairer if everybody will play under the same conditions
---
best episode of BattleBots I've ever seen

They never weren‚Äôt a thing?

Oh man, I want an m-lok ar15 in this game so bad.

Yeah I'm just lazy lol
---
When I first swapped to PC after a year without playing, I queued into an outback game, it was 2-2 and a complete 1v5 on attack, I was buck. I was in that downstairs office/bathroom bomb site, the first came from the bathroom, I headshot him, the second came from the hallway, but I heard him coming, the third was Cav above on hatch, but I predicted he would do that i so had my shotgun ready for when it broke, killed her, the second last tried to rush in from hallway again, but he got popped. And then doc was in the room opposite, and I pixeled his head. Wish I had shadow played it.
---
Thank you !
---
And I would hate trying to make that callout in game haha maybe I‚Äôll call him Gordon Bc it‚Äôs easier lol
---
Soon hopefully
---
There main selling point is that they are cheap. That‚Äôs why so many 3rd world countries as well as the U.S.S.R. used them.
---
They are extremely difficult to disassemble, especially in the field. They are hard to clean and repair. Most of the time they are used until they stop working and then you get a new gun. 
---
If you do have to repair an AK, most of the time it is done by taking parts from other dropped weapons and using them to replace your own parts.
---
For their purpose, AKs can last a long time. Their simple design allows them to avoid jamming from dust or debris. However, if a serious malfunction does occur, the gun is basically out of commission. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, to repair in the field. 
---
The AK-47 is also much less accurate than many other common assault rifles and battle rifles.
---
Hide chat and ignore the shitty ppl that act like children.  I have had chat turned off for years now. I dont care to read ppl talking shit. Find some good friends to play the game with and you'll enjoy your self a lot more. Are you on PC? Add me if you want. Uplay: FlipFlop72

You were the chosen one !

She legit is good on some maps. Had some great plays with her. Guess im back to geting shot in the face.

Well that explains it then you're for punishing people for language even when its taken out of context.

Also shouldnt you be also against the people personally insulting eachother on that same post? They aren't getting banned.

I think we need to start defining ‚Äúone taps‚Äù.... it was a nice kill but one taps don‚Äôt include burst fire &amp; full automatic

I believe it's just the hat. She rocks some fancy operator gloves but I cant remember the company
---
Both ranked and casual can be toxic but in a different way, in casual people just enjoy being toxic and try to troll their teammate, in addition to not being serious and doing stupid shit. In rank people get so worked up because they're too serious and that leads to toxic behaviour, but I prefer ranked to casual. I only casual when I am by myself.
---
tachanka mine
---
A lot of people have pointed out that his bio states he was a rioter in his youth so it makes sense but bad execution
---
That sledge was a fucking moron
---
It‚Äôs not a very good counter unless the defenders are sleeping. 
---
You can very clearly hear the sound of repelling, if it‚Äôs day time the shadow is a dead give away and there are 3 locations you can easily run out of to get someone hanging there, hell if you have balls there are 4 and you can just have someone run out that door. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs perspective makes it very powerful but like I said the defenders have to be clueless to be killed by it and it leaves the attacker in an extremely vulnerable position from so many locations.

You are a frequent fortnite player who's first post on this sub is THIS low quality sh*t post with absolutely no legitimate evidence, and you talk about game going downhill when the playerbase has CLEARLY increase from 20 odd to 35 mid last year to 45 million early this year. How do you expect to troll when you can't even do just that?

I have nothing against fortnite, but if you want to bait and/or troll,  AT LEAST get it right.

I feel like you don't know what toxicity is. Being annoying is very subjective and not toxicity in any way.

Where are you even getting those statistics because they are no where near from being true. The player base is litterally in the 10 to 20 mil right now and its continuing to decrease. Get your facts straight before commenting bud.

Ya I figured I might as well post this as well, not for upvotes but just to talk about it cause I think it would be cool

No not at all, insulting someone is wrong regardless and I'm sure we can both agree on that. I am over the whole thing really, I'm not angrily arguing with you, sorry if I gave that impression. I was just genuinely intrigued to see your side of the argument. I find it some of your statements overlap and contradict one another but yes, thank you for finally saying that context matters in this case. It should, I'm of a strong opinion of free speech and I think debates like these are important.
---
Play maps more that‚Äôs all I can say
---
And he didn‚Äôt switch over to chase mode.  Where they turn red.
---
It doesn‚Äôt heavily imply that at all. If you are attacking cash and CCTV its good to take garage control, that‚Äôs why so many teams play 1 or 2 in garage on defense lol.
---
What the hell is wrong with you?
---
I‚Äôd like to team up to move up in rank Xbox one
---
It‚Äôs been two weeks
---
Yeah, but I liked the first movie because it was vaguely plausible. And he got injured, and it did cause him pain and a lasting weakness.
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal.
---
Lmao
---
This was in the game but so many teamkills resulted from it so it was removed.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if he is joking or not but if he is..... r/woooosh
---
Straight up the game needs a better map selection algorithm. I played Kafe twice, and Oregon and coastline in 4 games last
---
Raptor legs didn't hurt anyone. :( They made me smile everytime, even during intense ranked matches.
---
I mean he did around the liver when he came back to New York in the 2nd movie
---
The attacking team still has to take control of the rooms from which fuze is going to use his clusters, and it takes time to get all the clusters in right places, thus giving defense time to react properly. Good roaming and wide defense would be more important than anchoring in one room. Its true it might be too powerful in lower ranks. i sail between ranks gold 1- plat 2 , where communication is usually good enough to counter things like this.
---
Either you unintentionally changed data servers, or it's a graphical bug, restart your game
---
The situation mode finally makes sense if we got John Wick
---
NEVER
---
What‚Äôs your rank
---
Jk i don‚Äôt know hopefully soon
---
No, they are deleted.
---
apparently its back in the game on the TTS
---
Damn thanks for the heads up my man! Think I will go with the season pass then.
---
Clash is a girl? Well fuck me upside down.

Hello Rex_from_PS4, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bskyg3/the_correct_way_to_play_alibi/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
They removed claymore from the game temporarily, it‚Äôs not a bug it‚Äôs in response to an exploit
---
"For the foreseeable future"
---
Meaning that there is no real ETA on when the glitches will be fixed. Just have to wait it out....
---
These shoes, I have them...
---
 he just said changing color nothing like density or anyting but I get wat you say
---
Oh okay ty
---
In approximately -50 days.
---
Watch it, else you'll get banned yourself. Nice verbal needle, though.
---
This should be Empire's uniform.
---
That's because they temporarily removed claymores and deployable shields to stop people from glitching.  Cuck's shotgun shouldn't have been effected
---
It's been a rumor for a while, I've been practicing using the F2 without the acog
---
Okay ty
---
But you have to consider this, organised attacking team, clear out the roamers using jackal etc, they now control the top, get a couple attackers to go down and make sure nobody leaves site by holding angles, fuze sets up, yes they hear it but they either die to fuze or die running out the door like headless chickens and getting picked off by surrounding attackers, if fuze gets the placements down which isn‚Äôt exactly impossible then every anchor dies
---
does she turn into a 4 speed with the UBs on tho ü§î
---
Then maybe play ranked on your main?
---
IQ is far out there but it's basically a super voltage clamp. Pulse could just be a sensitive microphone and visualizer or something. 
---
Kapkan doesnt have a laser trap? Not sure where you're getting the idea his clearly explosive EDD is a laser.
---
 
---
# Ah you think Ubisoft is your ally? You merely  adopted the quarantined. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't get properly balanced until I was already banned in Pro League, by then it was nothing to me!
---
Not quite - and I think you‚Äôre underestimating secure by saying it has cheesy wins and does not require strats, as any bomb player would; it‚Äôs not true but that‚Äôs fine as it‚Äôs your opinion. To be clear, I don‚Äôt really mind that ranked is going to be bomb only, however, a lot of people whom I play with are seriously concerned about this and are considering quitting the game. 
---
I do agree that casual should be fixed before making a move like this - it would be less of a problem if secure ranked players could still enjoy the same experience they have in ranked, but in casual - I would not be as concerned about the game‚Äôs health if this were the case. However, we are not there yet, and stripping away ranked secure at this time with the current state of the game is unfair to secure ranked players. I think you would agree with this.
---
I dont want to play ranked on my main. A friend and i want to mess around in ranked on our smurfs
---
is there a change whether they gonna put back towers in that ranked pool? v.v i loved the setting and idea of the starting position as attacker.
---
Featuring ACOG
---
It‚Äôs supposed to help new players. That along with the newcomer playlist are supposed to help them learn the game. That way they don‚Äôt just jump into ranked, potentially being a hinderance to the team.
---
Because the average non-smurf user will roughly get a sense for the game at earliest Level 30.
---
This would surely be interesting however I would like to let you know of the existence of searching for a group
---
I see it as an even playing field. I mean, the player is playing as John Wick. It's not like you're playing against thee John Wick. Otherwise the game would be unplayable. Lol
---
OK wait who is the other guy.
---
Kk
---
I was a fucking around
---
And its gonna get even better!
---
Yea but maybe that's indirect enough for them to not be 
---
But the topic only makes me think if how much more I'd like to have skins earned like how call if duty does it except intead of basically everything being the same challenge and all leading up to the same skin it be cool to have maybe each gun having their own legendary skin to show how much time you've put into the weapon itself. Same for operators.
---
Epi heavily hinted at it in a tweet, let me try and find it
---
That would make the spooky bitch even more spooky
---
*inner Mira main cries to death*
---
the 800 dpi with 6/6/83 feels good. Should I stay there?
---
Old Hereford was at least fun though
---
Btw i got mentioned to play fortnite lol
---
Smile you dense piece of ash main
---
I mean people are upset secure is getting removed so are you really suprised?
---
No, they said they will never do that. They admitted that tower doesn't suit siege, and it was because of countless complaints of the map being fundamentally garbage and unbalanced.
---
Ok did you think I should get a keyboard and mouse
---
does it happen every game?
---
Bomb is literally all of ranked. At high levels, nobody even has matching for the other 2 on (I never see secure unless I derank to Silver or under, and I never see hostage at all) And Ranked is adopting pro league rules, so going forward only bomb.
---
Oh ok
---
That's just like your opinion man
---
What is your GPU usage?
---
A normal teamkill might not be the end of the world, and your team could still win, but if you kill the hostage, you instantly made your team lose, and there is no guarantee you wouldnt do it again, so the game is giving you a harsh penalty, because the offense is pretty harsh, also there are achievements tied to some hostage matches and it would be nice for those trying to get them to not lose their limited chances because of their teammates. Its annoying when it happens, but now you've learned to be more careful lol.
---
y'all cryin' on Thermite's frags while smoke misses his ACOG... 
---
give smoke some love
---
give 'im back the pocket sniper
---
More the increase in recoil that I'd be concerned about
---
Summer sale most likely
---
Restart game, it works every time
---
Try it. Each person has his own dpi setting that they are comfortable with. Mine's 400 with 10/10/83 (or was it 450? Or 12? Lel I forgot). 800 with 6 is also very close to that. You need to experiment, tweak and arrive at your own personal comfortable sensitivity.
---
Also, watch some top diamond streamers' sensitivity videos. You can try those as well if you want some presets.
---
This is why people hate Doc
---
Fortress and Hereford are trash, but Villa has no place in ranked (or in the game at all) cause that map is fucking garbo. Almost as unfun as Tower
---
Couldn't get a good clip of this with sound, but both of these kills were based on sound alone.  I heard the first guy break and jump in the window, and heard the second guy unfolding the breach charge on the other side of the wall. A lot of folks complain about the sound design in this game, and while it's far from perfect (especially when above/below) it's better than most.
---
You're saying you dont like tactical 3 speed rushes? Or tactical seizures?
---
All they had to do was make the outside stairway covered for defenders
---
SO ADORABLE!
---
Dont worry, she still has a gun with an Acog guys! The French DMR is "useable" right?
---
First we had Jager now this
---
very (Thumbs up emoji)
---
2nd best.
---
That‚Äôs a glory hole
---
Moving should jostle your point of view around so your aim moves a bit. Right now we're all on segways because we scoot around without any movement at all.
---
Also it will actually provide a use for the walk feature since it wont mess with your aim as much. Maybe even use the scroll wheel to adjust walk speed.

i bought clash like 2 days before she was banned fix glitch pls ubi

I do believe class has been banned in terrorist hunt somehow.

Sore arse white mask...

I do have a Pc Upsetkiller0456

also smoke spawn peek

I miss Thermite's frags

in my time playing siege, I have got 4 black ice skins, 12 legendary SKINS, 3 legendary CHARMS, and over 50 epics, My luck is amazing
---
my friend once did something similar, but with Maestro cams

I think you my have meant to be commenting on this post:

---
Fuze actually
---
my tops for year 3 are maestro, maverick, kaid &amp; nomad..and I guess alibi is ok because she can be fun
---
lion isn't as good as he was after the nerf, finka is ok but messes up aim which bothers me, clash is lame unless you love shields and holding down the site.
---
Year 4 honestly I don't know about gridlock, but mozzie can be fun because his can act like a mute jammer and stop drops from passing and he can also control a drone, and new ops are "meh" in my opinion.
---
"Holy my vodka" 
---
\-Fuze
---
This is what i cant stand like would it take you that much extra to put up a reinforcement?
---
I feel the same way, after Mira and jackal it has been going downhill in my opinion. I want to play siege again
---
Yes i agree. What they have done to some guns recoil wise has made them super unfun to play...at least on console. Scorpion, smg-12 and  bearing were hit super hard and it sucks. I know there wasn‚Äôt really any acogs to remove there... but i would take that any day over ruining f2‚Äôs recoil
---
(still a god at the game) Don't be so humble
---
I was hoping this new season would change it for me, but I‚Äôve played on the TS, and there‚Äôs no difference
---
Its not garbo but imo its so boring, like idk what it is abt it but i just find it monotonous and boring
---
You can do the same thing with the hatch in wine cellar, you just have to get up on the table first.
---
PMM is a beast.
---
i think that‚Äôs pretty dumb since we have a discovery playlist to specifically play the new map, but i‚Äôve definitely noticed this as well
---
You a non bomb player by any chance
---
Nope 100% bomb
---
Chill man. How long you been playing? You gotta know there's a little but of frustration that comes with playing this game. If you don't want to play this game anymore then fine, but that's not the game's fault. It's yours.
---
Please never Hereford again, garbage map and I never have anything bad to say about this game
---
So quick Q. How does one get a high kd and W/L without hacking. I know W/L you used to be able to just leave the game. But K/D?
---
While there is the argument that "it's casual" I agree that people leave way too much. I wouldn't want to punish someone for their first or second leave in a day, as sometimes shit happens, but as some comments have said, I wish they could track and punish chronic leavers, or perhaps just reward those of us who don't with a little renown or an alpha pack or two at the end of a season. Not sure if rewards or punishment is the way to go, maybe both.
---
Buck is a one difficulty rating despite needing good gun control, game sense to watch for a flank and map knowledge for vertical play, yet nomad and ash are somehow more difficult...nice
---
It's one of the best maps for bomb. You have to play as a team and get majority of the map to attack and defend
---
pro league aim on point
---
blaime ubisoft!
---
Lots and lots of kills
---
I‚Äôve played since Skull Rain, I‚Äôve had fun with every season until Chimera, when that season came out everything just went downhill
---
Nah you gotta pay me a lot of me
---
People have such poor taste. The bandit elite skin sucks and the new smoke elite skin is great
---
I know, its a great map, but its so boring and repetetive imo, its a very balanced map, but i really dread playing on it, idk what it is abt it lol
---
Why
---
This post is stupid
---
F
---
Keep up the good work!
---
Jokes on you, I didn't take out a loan &gt;:)
---
Or the hatch at the other garage :)
---
Hereford, Skyscraper, and Chalet could all get out of ranked and i'd be happy. I'm in the minority that doesn't mind Villa and Theme Park though.

This game can get under your skin like no other if you let it, and sometimes you don't even notice it happening. Take a break, go play other games or do other hobbies for a bit. You might get the urge to start it up again, you might not. Either way, some time away from it did wonders for me actually wanting to play it again. Easy to get burnt out on Siege.
---
Fortress first, Hereford isn‚Äôt that bad
---
Can you provide some examples of the normally unviable sites please?
---
&gt; deplorable shields
---
The autocorrect may have done this, but it's more accurate.

I hate villa and theme park, i just dont know where to cover on them. And I always lose them, whether i actually play good or not

U can...enjoy your day! And pet a nice animal for me
---
Hey, I'm just checking in üëã
---
We're actually both wrong. 
---
The updated one shows the C75auto and the F2 as the 2 top guns.
---
Are you implying we have a collective worldwide gamer moment that breaks siege entirely by saying puta?
---
I'm guessing Mira, Echo, Buck, in that order.
---
I always thought that slav memes only applied to russians, but I live in Argentina so what the hell do I know
---
Lol
---
Yes it works in canada but its android only
---
Which sensitivity are you running?
---
You mean cesspool?
---
It‚Äôs not an F2 it‚Äôs an F1 FAMAS
---
According to Siege‚Äôs ranking system it‚Äôs based off 5 games so KDR doesn‚Äôt matter?
---
If you've ever worn one of these you'd know that this is not what Nokk would see. You barely even notice it after a while, in fact it just looks like a blurred color screen in front of you eventually.
---
"Due to abuse, we have disabled this service." Lmao
---
Lmaoooo yes sorry about that. Edited for being dumb
---
I know Valkyrie and soon warden use the mpx
---
Ive always wanted an option for custom games to allow any operator to be used on either team. Maybe even multiple of the same operator.
---
For Nokk I would use it over Lesion's shotgun,  but on Smoke i use the shotgun to open holes and such, and then the SMG-11 for combat.
---
ACOGs should just be available on DMRs.
---
Bandit and recruit can use the mp7. Rook,Doc, and recruit can use the mp5. Mute and recruit can use the mp5sk and Valkyrie can use the mpx
---
bro it's just a joke
---
Ummm dont wanna talk about how i waste i mean use my shots
---
What rank are you
---
Not everyone has shit aim get up to gold and you‚Äôll realize that it isn‚Äôt a bad scope
---
It‚Äôs fun though. You do it cause you wanna be an asshole which is fun :)
---
This will never work as you reinforce that hatch to prevent that

Hello Silva_31, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bsnqug/these_three_heroes_were_our_saviors_in_the_fight/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I'd +1 Jackal, extremely controllable gun and fun ability. In defense I find mute's gun to be easy to master, but I'm not sure if you'd like his ability, same goes to Lesion. Maybe I'd even say Cav.
---
But Alpha Packs aren't bought with real money. You don't buy the R6 credits to open them, it's completely earned in game with the Renown. So I don't think it would fall under that congressional bill anyways. If they were bought with real money that's one thing, but you can only earn the packs. HOWEVER, I just though of this.. the Alpha Packs like the April Fools ones, those would be outlawed and no longer allowed to be done (since you had to pay real money for those if you wanted them all)
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was a bad scope only that so many peoplw‚Äôs aim suffer because of it
---
Ive gone 20 -5 in ranked before... but im not consistent
---
The problem with Cav is I need to be careful at all times. I'm exploring and I'm not the best at roaming.
---
High gold 3 lvl 70
---
What‚Äôs your rank?
---
Fucking jacket XD
---
Not when she‚Äôs ugly as fuck
---
That sounds like something you may need to see a doctor about if it's that bad.
---
Pffffft whaaaaat no that‚Äôs crazy, Tarzan just happens to be the coolest guy evr and he trained me how to shoot so I owe him a debt but nooooooo not an ad, that‚Äôs whew...that‚Äôs funny.
---
True. If fuze was a 2-2 he'd be one of the most picked operators in the game.
---
If you are only good at certain maps then you are bad
---
I wont take this slander
---
I feel your pain.
---
i swear if this happens imma lose my shit ash never deserved to lose the acog she didnt need a fucking neef by removing her acog her fucking hitbox needed a stupid fucking fix ubishit

I guess all pro players are shit then and you are the best player in the world

Exactly. That‚Äôs boring.
