Only one way to find out. YMMV, but it won’t hurt to go to ubi support and ask.

Just one question: why is at 3 fps
---
This has been as issue for ages. Nothing is at frustrating as trying to spot someone in clear view but that camera says “fuck you”.
---
Would he not be in some sort of military uniform? 
---

---
The lore says he was great at science but he didn't go around gassing people as a civilian kid did he?
---
Then how come I don’t see her wearing a tactle neck? (For the uneducated, tactical turtle neck )
---
He's not a 1 difficulty. People over estimate his old power. You take him our but everyone wanted to cry about the speed and shield
---
Hell i remember them saying it takes up to a maximum of 96 hours to deploy a fix on console after PC. 
---
We then proceed to wait an additional 3 weeks for a game breaking exploit to be fixed back when Blitz could ADS with his shield up (like clash atm, this happened about a year ago) - we had to wait for the entire new season because they couldnt be bothered to fix this exploit ruining the game.

HERE'S VALKY!!

You deserved to die for not sledging that cav
---
How do you know she’s not? You can’t see her neck...
---
I reverse image searched it and [this](https://pp.userapi.com/c844722/v844722116/11e208/9xLMsLStUKc.jpg) was the least compressed version of it I could find. Kimichangas's signature isn't distorted to hell in this version.

&gt; OP: *uses laser sight on **Sledge** with shotgun*
---
&gt; Me: It's okay to use the laser sight on the shotgun
---
&gt; You: Thatcher shouldn't use the shotgun.
---
**????**
---
If I can't make the situation clearer to you, then I don't know how I can.
---
Looks like he’s sniffing a diaper
---
You are only listing the ones you like. That's not an argument. Many people like many different types of skins.
---
I know you we're lagging but I got to say you're pretty garbage
---
*I must cure them, they are sick, the pestilence spreads so quickly, my cure is so close.*

Preach brother, its really not as bad as people think

Do you happen to know the meaning of Guerrilla Warfare?
---
This convo ended 8hrs ago
---
Honestly I want to see what’s under that netting. Not because shes probably hot, but because I want to see what kind of helmet that she has
---
Their username is literally right there in the picture.
---
The C1 does in fact not have a holo.
---
Don't use it much but it's a strange decision nonetheless.
---
I see your selfie
---
MORTAL KOMBAT!
---
I haven't. But I know the pain of putting your back to what turned out to be a soft wall in 1v3 as monty
---
:')
---
He’s fine.
---
Same! Kinda wanna know if she’s hot too tho..
---
Is that a raider CS-35 I see?
---
"Unmanned drones"
---
Jesus christ.
---
What was that.
---
I believe the broadcast settings might still apply I’m not sure, because it’s not a party setting
---
I don’t buy non-elite units much but this one I will. I never realized i needed an Italian cowboy. Wish it was an American op but this is still amazing.
---
Blitz takes almost zero skill, when that happens it's a blessing to know that you didn't die to bullshit
---
SIGN HIM UP!
---
Yup!
---
The objective scanning issue is basically a feature at this point. It can be remedied by quickly changing from your drone to another drone, but it is pretty frustrating.
---
The peeking is actually a new issue Ubi intentional created! They changed where the camera is located on the models. They made this change to fix another issue, but created a worse one instead. They haven’t said anything about fixing it, so I don’t think they care.
---
Ok this is epic
---
No one uses the Lord's picture in vain
---
Wait
---
Rook is 1 on the TTS.
---
Oh god oh fuck, what have you done to my wallet?
---
Alright good. What about Doc?
---
Oh the possibilities
---
Ive seen this somewhere..
---
And shot all above his head
---
He is a level 0.5 difficulty boys. Ubisoft, get some glasses.
---
Link pls. My heart angle the What in Anticipation. I really hope it’s a western event, even though my wallet will hate me.
---
On pc? Because I play on Xbox and it isn’t back yet.
---
The fuck is wrong with you people
---
I’m assuming he climbs walls that you are not able to repel
---
fuck him
---
&gt;I get sarcasm online  
---
No you fucking don't pal.  No you fucking don't.  
---
&gt;saying "Mostly meme" is not explaining the joke?  
---
Yes it is.  The BASICS OF THE FUCKING JOKE IS YOU DON'T USE THE LASER ON THE SHOTGUN IS WHEN IT'S FUCKING THATCHER BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING THATCHER AND A LASER SIGHT.  
---
That was the fucking core of the god damn joke.  Thatcher and a fucking laser sight.  
---
The rest of the joke was because it's Thatcher, and attackers in general, and a fucking shotgun.  No one who isn't giving zero fucks and/or isn't dicking around uses a shotgun on attack because it's just so pointless, because you're giving up an attackers main advantage of range for something that has power at range but doesn't even work half the time like above.  People treat shotguns on attackers like a damn joke, as evidenced by people wondering why Nokk, an Op designed around getting around and close, is getting a shotgun with Phantom Sight.  Especially since you need to get super aggressive with them to make them somewhat work, which again, when do you see Thatchers go super aggressive?  
---
And it was fucking joke that should have needed explanation.  But it's clear that you need something obvious explained to you because you repeatedly missed my point/joke of "the only time you shouldn't use a laser with shotguns is if it's with Thatcher".  Especially when I even stated "Thatcher is the one and only case why you shouldn't use a laser on a shotgun, all other shotguns you should use a laser on".  But hey, I guess I was wrong in assuming that one of the most basic fucking jokes among this game's community wouldn't need to have been fucking explained at all.
---
Roam clear always reaches master bedroom before someone vaulting through that window. Keeping that hatch closed by killing their hard breacher can win you the round, so opening the hatch for free will benefit the attackers. Could be used late into the game though, but it would still be risky if they decide to drop hatch instead of trophy for any reason.
---
rook as well
---
Nomad mains mad
---
You're not a victim, please don't act that way. Racial slurs are much worse when you actually experience racism in your day to day life. Which I doubt you do.
---
or just change the hole to the other side of "thank you for your service"...
---
Looks more or less the same to me. Maybe I'm just blind?
---
Maybe it's the difficulty of playing against?
---
Yes I had heard through the grapevine they "fixed" his hitbox so that you don't get shot through your shield so easily from head on and more coverage when crouching. I came back from probably a year hiatus and gave him a try. Two different times I was crouch walking with shield up and not ADS'ing my pistol. Both times I got killed very quickly from head on and when I watched the kill cam my shield was angled, sort of like when you ADS, but on my screen it was up and down.
---
Helllll yeah, we ended up winning :)
---
Uniform and hung are different.
---
are you just scouring reddit for comments like these? this is very random and off topic.
---
“PAN SHOT!”
---
im still waiting for a montagne write elite
---
Lol right. If we get another cutscene like the last one that details some interactions, I’d love to have one of the SAS and GIGN interacting maybe in like a cafeteria or something where they talk about it. Like maybe it’s become this big legend that’s spiraled out of control and then maybe like Montangne or Mute sits down and clears the air and reveals how mundane it was or how it wasn’t all that big of a deal. Idk would be a neat way for Ubi to make a meta joke about us geeking out over Siege lore.
---
That’s a mega oof, can we get an F in the chat
---
F
---
they are gone, reduced to atoms
---
Not very yee haw of you, pardner.
---
I tried it the other day and it doesn't go through the studs.
---
Future operators will be designed and balanced for bomb mode too.
---
Mozzie gets on my nerves
---
I had a similar thing moving from a ps4 to a ps4 pro where my physical copy wouldn't work, buying a digital copy fixed it and let me keep all my progress.
---
We already got chanka event skin, no need for another skin for him.
---
Do you have raw input on or off? Toggling it should help.
---
Montagne is pronounced Mon-ton-yuh \[French for mountain\] but I always hear it as Montaigne
---
Yeah there was this same problem like more than a year ago and they fixed it but also made him a fucking powerhouse in the process cause the buffed a bunch of other shit and they nerfed him again and now we have the problem of his shield getting shot through AGAIN.
---
I wanna see some dope ass revolver only mode
---
"You never know who dies" made me think of the sawed-off shotgun scene from Killing Them Softly.
---
"If I shoot somebody with this fucking thing it'll kill everybody in the fucking room."
---
https://youtu.be/nT-C0CUvSK8 is the scene for those wondering.
---
I've been waiting for a Mira elite, I vowed it would be the only elite I'd buy if it ever existed. She literally has the largest gadget, an elite for her would be very nice
---
Yeah this has been brought up before
---
Would've bought it in a heartbeat and I don't even play as him.
---
That's a great idea cause then mozzie and echo cant either so you have to be smart when using them. Great idea for a buff would change up the game a little
---
Throw that shit down pard, we in a posse now boy.
---
Xbox gang
---
Frosts new fallout gun skin
---
Get a bigger mousepad and get used to aiming with your elbow instead of just your wrist.
---
I use 400dpi, 10 sens and 83 ads.
---
Don't use 85 ads. Change it to 83 to match your hipfire sens.
---
Don’t focus on what other people’s senses are. All I can say is that find the sense that fits you. I’ve sure you’ve maybe heard this a million times but it actually pays off. Just practice in T-hunts until you find something that you work well with. All in all, practice on senses you think may work with you and don’t copy someone else’s sense as it may not work for you
---
Oh, I wasn't aware, this is my first time here, and I thought this was a cool idea and wanted to post it, I'll probably delete then if it's been up here already though.
---
You can't be racist towards white people. You must be new in the world.
---
If you don't wanna sweat stay out of ranked.
---
*votes to kick*
---
1v5:...
---
My friends: You’re the last one, complete the mission.
---
Well they were trying to fix ranked because everybody complains about it and then they focus on reworking maps because everybody complains and then they added old gadgets because others are too futuristic and over powered and everybody complained and everybody wants new events and outbreak modes and complained, and now they release operators with guns already in the game because they are trying To balance their abilities and guess what? Everyone is complaining.
---
They did him so dirty and he fucking stuck the landing. Props to this guy 👏🏼
---
I assumed as much it'd a good idea cool that you came up with ig yourself
---
Nomad
---
Maybe your SSD is faulty or full? SSD's become slower when they're full.
---
How have you not
---
I believe there is art work showing that Mira helped invent Nokk's HEL gadget. I could be wrong.
---
Castle looks like Kanye West 
---
Capitao looks like Nelson Mandela 
---
Clash looks like a Milkdud
---
Are you completely uncultured, a raging virgin or perhaps both?
---
Theres pros and cons to it.
---
For one, I am an absolute pro with some weapons. Having them on a new operator would feel right at home. I know a lot of people have the same situation.
---
But, I do enjoy the new weapons. New guns make up the character. There are still guns that I would love to be added (AS Val, Tavor, RDB) that would be awesome.
---
I wish I was a virgin lol. But I probably am completely uncultured.
---
It's because the disc version is different region than your downloaded version.
---
Just redownload the game.
---
Restarting your router might help. This has happened a couple of times for me too.
---
Ay man dab me up
---
The change only affects rank games. If you are complaining about sweating on a rank game maybe this isnt the type of game you like to play.
---
What did word did you jest use to describe the LORD?
---
its not about experience, its about principle. their reasoning for the filter is to fight "toxicity", but they completely ignore toxicity towards an entire group of people. racial slurs are racial slurs, and the group of people who theyre directed towards does not change that fact.
---
just type the romanised characters
---
hope ubi is ready for a drop in player base.
---
I'd like to borrow at least 200 of those please.
---
Noice
---
Man that’s true but y4s1 and y4s2 are seeming to follow the color scheme pretty close to what we saw on the map.
---
Okay, so then try to improve instead of bitching about it on Reddit.
---
*pop goes the weasel*
---
Idk who we is I'm ok with the non edgy xxxdarkmasterxxx look that he's getting
---
There is an exploit that allows you to make it look like another player has typed this message.
---
Ubi is getting rid of draws
---
Yeah no problem lol, I was mostly joking becuase that's what you see on cosplay photos especially girls cosplaying.
---
Bruv they should have straight up made him wear a plastic bottle DIY mask if they were going to make him look like a 15-year old with smoke grenades
---
Sounds like some extended input lag there.
---
Try setting game's priority to low in task manager- details.
---
It is all typed from mobile and also by writing that comment isnt that hypocrisy? My good fellow i like your salt. All hail TF|2
---
My dad fucks me
---
With all the running he does in his cargo shorts of course he ain't skippin leg day
---
What hurts your team more, a rookie Ash who just rushes in and dies at the start of the round or a rookie Thermite who just rushes in and dies at the start of the round?
---
I type on mobile all the time, you aren't gonna find anything unformatted from me though.
---
I got one today aswell
---
360p or what? I want whatever your machine is having
---
Get a job
---
It happened to me one game and it got removed again.
---
I dont see a frost on the other team
---
Same. It made me laugh more than I wanted to.
---
What was the point of throwing the three cameras and picking them up in the beginning? Is there a tactical value or is it just a dare against yourself to toss one and then pick it up?
---
Because he's a niche operator, same as BB. Ask any pro player and they'd tell you they hate Blitz and shields in general.
---
what movie?
---
I once had a guy like this join a CSS match. Most memorable moment by far
---
Maybe thats you but most people are typing but also doing shit for school or around the house also formatting to me personally seems irrelevant   unless im writing a english paper
---
“My pp hostile, do not feed”😂😂
---
She had an AR before. They found her too Op. Same for warden, who had a good smg before.
---
When you can see through smoke AND shoot, you can't possibly have a death launcher of a gun.
---
Would you rather have them introduce a new gun, but make it sh*tty to balance him and her? Instead, just use an existing s#itty gun and it's data saved AND balance maintained.
---
Great gadget, bad gun. Bad gadget, great gun. Math checks out.
---
that's weird... some ops were released before and are seeing price reductions later, for example jackal, and ela. Ela will be on sale soon, and jackal not until next year... weird. But thanks again man
---
I’m still a kapkan main, but I do miss the old days. I can’t deny he’s more balanced now tho
---
Gonna try it out, thx!
---
I agree kinda. Sadly the only solution is to maybe get some good friends together and just... play the shit out of the game. Eventually you’ll beat the smurfs and have the ops you need.
---
That’s how you know he’s a good commentator
---
Women amiright
---
I agree
---
It’s all people who care way too much about a video game being more competitive bc them being slightly above average at it is all they have going for them in life
---
Agreed i'll go do some t-hunts and casuals but if i start a ranked game and meet another smurf i'm coming straight back here to bitch to you about it &lt;3
---
You should try out TF2 sometime. That game is the true king of just yeeting players in with 0 direction at all.
---
They shouldn’t even add difficulty’s there’s no way for them to be accurate
---
HOES MAD
---
my pp hostile, do not feed
---
Idk man, I kinda like it. Still wish it was the Plague Doctor though
---
Fix: stay away from console + toxic US servers
---
But srsly, nothing u can do about it but to find friends to play with.
---
And I'll tell you to keep trying to improve as a player. If it goes on long enough maybe you'll be in pro league.
---
Then it would come down to skill, vs I have the superior operator aka blitz and his bs.
---
 shields in general requires different mechanic and knowledge which are usually more harder than normal ops so I wouldn't mind them rating all shield ops to be 3
---
Ash rated 2 is fucked up tho.
---
Yea i think he should be 2-2
---
Clearly, lol.
---
He’s wearing a suit with body armor on top. Of course he’s a 1 speed
---
You might actually need the thermite\~
---
He’s not even remotely close to worst op lmao there’s a reason people want him nerfed, he’s fucking stupid
---
Kaid has an AUG variant
---
True the math does check out but please do note im in seige for the fun im not coming from a ranked type mind even if i treat ranked like casual .
---
Do you pay any attention to the game?
---
But compared to Rook and Doc doesn't he look a bit under smaller for that stat line?
---
Mira and Twitch have a lot interactions with some of the newer ops, they evaluate their gadgets and add upon. (Mira helped with Nøkk's Hel and Warden's glasses and finds him annoying for asking for cooler frames while the thing she works on is the lenses)
---
Mira and Twitch are presumably friendly with Maestro and Clash (Maestro's evil eye bulletproof cover is made by Mira and Clash's shield is made by Twitch and Mira).
---
I think I could assume Dokkaebi and Thatcher dislike one another. (She's high tech, and they end up having an argument when Thatcher refuses to wait for Dokkas hack to go through)
---
Also it is possible Capitao dislikes Bandit because of how deep he went in his undercover work (Caps brother was killed by drug dealers, ever since then he's been anti gun anti drug).
---
On the board behind Harry it says Dokkaebi is scared of Cav (understandable).
---
Echo and Twitch worked on Alibi's prismas.
---
There is interaction between Dokkaebi and Mozzie where she compliments his Pest but thinks she could add up to the code.
---
And before Harry replaced old 6, Mira, Twitch and Ash were mainly featured on Operators' Psychological research bits, one could assume they interacted too.
---
Noticed that its not only Doc and Thatcher that dislike/hate Lion, Twitch also seems to have an issue with him and Harry noted that he needs to get it sorted because he fears their tension might cause discrepancies in future operations.
---
Also Harry's board mentioned something about JTF2 (Frost and Buck) having some issue with Spetsnasz (probably Fuze lol)
---
What does it have to do with the given situation?
---
I think I'm going to be sick
---
It baffles me games still don't do this. I'd cough up cash for a holy hand grenade elite grenade skin.
---
Ash makes sense though
---
Must not. Do you know why?
---
Wtf is an smg 16?
---
They’re disabled currently.
---
Jam works, however add a lil peanut butter and it’ll give ash an acog
---
If that’s on high graphics then what would it be on low 🤔
---
The suit and he is wearing a small plate carrier that is pretty light though
---
Yes I do, it's out there in the open. Just go look at the latest announcements from Ubisoft. It is clear and has been around for a few days
---
Have less devices connected to the internet. Streaming services like Netflix and etc tend to take up a lot of internet. My parents were watching Netflix once and my ping was going from 30 to 170 and to 400 on rare occasions
---
Thanks
---
I agree with some of the ratings but I'd make a couple changes:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\- Make Buck a 2: His guns take some practice to get used to and his gadget takes more map knowledge to use effectively (vertical play).
---
\- Make Castle a 3: Without a specific strategy and/or a well organized team Castle can be more detrimental than helpful.
---
\- Make Jackal a 2:  Jackal has a high skill ceiling but his guns are good and his gadget doesn't take much skill to simply scan a set of prints.
---
\- Make Bandit a 2:  Easy to play, difficult to master. Most beginners just treat his gadget as "set and forget" and won't get the most out of it. If Jager is a 2, Bandit should be as well (although I considered putting Jager at a 1).
---
\- Make Maverick a 3: Requires good map knowledge and getting peeked though your own breach hole is frustrating (and frequent) for beginners).
---
\- Make Vigil a 2: His gadget is relatively simple and he has a good loadout.
---
\- Make Ash a 1: It's Ash, the token EZ mode operator.
---
Those are the main ones for me, but there's a few others I could go either way on. I think it'd make more sense to have a scale out of 5, alongside a short list of strengths and weaknesses.  Also, this info is only available on the operation selection screen in game, not the operator tab in the menu which I feel is a bit of an oversight.
---
Let’s talk about these “Details &amp; Details.” Are we doubling up on the amount of details or are the details themselves also detailed?
---
A steady downward drag at the right pace easily makes the recoil handleable. Otherwise just burst fire it.
---
Is there a way to fix it, destiny 2 is fucking infuriating to play because I can't do anything in my inventory
---
That ship sailed a long time ago. Kaid and gridlock are also 3 armored while wearing next to nothing in armor.
---
Because you have to face the shield in just the right direction or some moron will headshot you through it /s
---
Thank you, kind stranger
---
Nice.
---
My method is to smack the person watching you then smack the person defusing but this was just awesome
---
#BIG JUICY COCK GUZZLED DOWN BY A HOT WOMAN WHO SHOWED BIG BOBS AND VAGANAE
---
Fucking bargin bin elite skin
---
Luckily I don't care what some redditor thinks about my comments. I am just glad that apparently Ubisoft has the same idea as me (and for once actually does something about it). 
---
And just do double down on this point: Reddit makes you think that you are in the majority in terms of the community. But to be honest, most of the higher end of the community is NOT on here, and for good reason. From the comments I see here a lot, this part of the community is at best average at the game or are console players, both of which have no authority to talk game balance at all. But we know Ubisoft is listening to some part of the community - the pros are asked directly and the game is balanced around Plats and Diamonds otherwise. So since Ubisoft has all the data on the game (and we don't), and they decide to throw out Secure and Hostage from Ranked mode, we must surmise that they are way less balanced than Bomb mode.
---
My only gripe is that you forgot Cav is Brazilian, not white 😂
---
https://www.flagandbanner.com/flags/flag_etiquette.asp
---
For your leisure. And strange that you think reading the tag is more important than the flag.
---
That is amazing I’m planning on cosplaying L Detachment or 2 shock army sometime!
---
Alternate between crouch and sprint and you eventually close the gap enough to flash and clap your opponent’s butt cheeks
---
Don’t use aug
---
What ruins this game isn't just smurfs- it's cheaters. There's a huge cheating problem that neither the devs nor the community want to acknowledge because the former fabricates the efficacy of Battleye, and the latter is too insecure about their skill to call out a cheater when they should suspect one.
---
Can I request you?
---
That's a negative ghost rider, just spend a game of T hunt using just the SMG and you will realize how easy it is to use on console. Just not with suppressor, please, no.
---
WAIT A TICK
---
He used up all his drugs that’s why:)
---
You should check out the video I recorded of someone trying to sound like something similar when I played ranked. I was laughing my ass off the whole although you couldn't hear my voice since clips recorded don't apparently record your own voice.
---
https://youtu.be/-Rf1Ko3FIYM
---
Why not? 556 is better?
---
Was about to go to bed but now I might run some casual so I can try this lol love kooky strats like this
---
T-thanks I guess.
---
What is TTS?
---
552 is better gun
---
The only time I run sledge shotgun is when I'm rushing, and that's it, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
---
If what the devs said is correct, then I do pronounce it correctly. 
---
&gt;Its just 'ø'.
---
I can't draw a line through an o, I would still have search it up and copy it or enable a Danish keyboard which I don't need, you fucking monkey.
---
Here's where an issue arises with me:
---
My biggest complaint of teammates and communication, is having teammates who don't know when to shut the hell up. Its not necessary to narrate every little thing you do, especially when you talk so much that I can't even hear sounds in the game. Also, all the backgrounds sounds, the conversations with people who aren't in the game, the music blasting, and the small talk, I'm just going to be annoyed to high hell, so my first instinct is to mute, and those people stay muted. I do end up missing callouts, but I wouldn't have made it that far had I not muted them.
---
Another thing is accuracy. Sometimes the callouts are right and we win the match from good communication. Other times they tell me the left is where I should look, when in reality they took a hatch and are coming from the right and I end up dead. Sometimes I get lucky and completely ignore people shouting at me that I'm "a fucking dumbass who will lose it all because [I'm] trash and a fucktard" and what not, and instead of losing, I trust my gut and keep looking the opposite way they say to and get the kill and win the match. Had this happen plenty of times...
---
I respect and appreciate when people will tell me where and who, versus who and how. Once they're dead (and not looking on a camera) to me, they know nothing anymore. If you're going to tell me Valkyrie is in the Kitchen, I take it into account. If they're going to say Valkyrie's probably coming from the left, I can't always trust it. 
---
I think a vital lesson here shouldn't be to give and communicate callouts, but rather that people should learn how to do it. When to say it, how to say it, and how not to demand it. As well as the golden rule of if it's not useful information to the team, it does not need to be said. We can chitchat in a party or whatever in between games, but not while the game is happening. Also, try to avoid saying something you're not certain of, and instead give an idea. Don't tell someone that an enemy will probably do something. Yeah, sometimes your guesses are right, but you're going to confuse people. Unless you see them directly on a camera feed, you cannot be certain about it. Better thing to do is to say who it is, where you saw them and any other important info that you know. For example:
---
Good: "Bandit is in the bedroom. He ran to the back, and he has a shotgun."
---
(You have revealed who it is, now they know who to look for. You mentioned their weapon, so now they know distance might help them in this case. You pointed out where they were and where they headed, NOT where you think they are. This allows your teammate to generate ideas on what Bandit could do, they will utilize this information along with what they see and hear to determine the best plan of action. Lastly, it's short, quick, and informal. You're not talking for too long, over top of sounds, and you relay all the information.)
---
Bad: "Bandit is upstairs, he's probably going to try and flank you from the bathroom. Just shoot there. You could also go to Kids room and shoot through the closet."
---
(While you did reveal who, You're not giving a lot of info on them here. By just saying "upstairs" You're not specific, this could mean any room, anyspace, or even the stairs itself. You're giving ideas out that one, isn't for you to generate, and two, you're uncertain of. He might try flanking you from the bathroom, or he might try to rush you from the main door. But because you have focused your teammates attention to the bathroom, they won't see it coming until he last second or not at all. With "Just shoot there," you're already fucking up. When in support mode, you need to stop playing the game while dead. In other words, stop trying to use your teammates as minions to play the game for you. Be support, not control. Next, once again, you're generating ideas that need to be left to your teammates to generate. You're putting too many ideas in their head that essentially, just distract them. They also might get a cluttered head and forget that they're moving to the open and forget to check corners and search before assuming safety. Also, notice how long this is, imagine how many key sounds you might have missed while someone talked over them.)
---
Of course though, sometimes you get lucky with guesses, sometimes dead teammaes know the play and can tell you with certainty, but for the most part, there's a lot you don't know. When dead, play support, not your teammates. Give informational callouts or don't give them at all. Sometimes letting others plan a course of action on their own works out fine. 
---
Communicate with your team beforehand about what works best. And communicate with them during about what you know, not what you guess.
---
Well good thing it will be bomb only next season in ranked.

I was actually hyped to see round 3 play out... that's good commentating.

For better or worse, I still trust you.
---
Okay but the one of rook or pulse dude? Yeah ur a bit disappointed
---
Blitz is shield operator, so basically the first thought of some is "His team needs to be behind him and hes the movable cover"
---
But nope.
---
That would look plain stupid what do u think would fitting to such a mask?
---

---
A sledge elite like this wouldn't even make sense
---
SO CUTE 
---
"IT'S SO FLUFFY IM GONNA DIE"

Good luck!

Hey dumbass, there were 4 f5s there. That means your whole team thought you were trash and/or toxic. Sucks for you! Maybe get some friends and a new brain and try again.
---
Tough, huh shitter?
---
I honestly can't tell if this is just a giant woooosh or if you genuinely hate ela
---
Nice
---
You must enjoy stepping on puppies too when you’re bored
---
na just the pick&amp;ban and 3 round per side settings.
---
Its still the same maps and the same 5s plant/defuse time.

Toxic shit

Yeah but smonks elite fits him too

They are most likely blind if you flashed them up close, they are just “spraying and praying” and get lucky. Blitz is a very **VERY** difficult operator to play just right and the people who are amazing with him are unstoppable. Just be patient with him.
---
Test
---
I have the same problem! The flash doesn't seem to register or something, leaving  the defender free to shoot at me without missing. We might want to ask ubisoft about this
---
Don't you dare

I’m buying him
---
I always felt They should've left part of the old days still in. Given he can place his traps lower or higher on door ways, i felt like if you put it higher where it was more visible it should be more damaging as a nail bomb to the face isn't to pleasent.
---
R4C is the better weapon, and as an entry dragger you don't really need an ACOG anyway. If you have trouble seeing then out on 4:3 aspect ratio
---
Wtf? Lmao 🤣🤣🤣
---
Plot twist: they just played the game for the first time.
---
The game files on the TTS show a Mira elite along with lesions. Plus she has a reworked face in the TTS, so it's pretty likely she's getting an elite this season after lesions elite.
---
Deeeebs
---
Big sad
---
Lesion is 100% a “better” operator than Vigil. However, if you mainly play casual and have fun, I think Vigil is a more fun operator. But if you play ranked, grab Lesion first.
---
One more yes there is from xXxTh0tSlayerxXx
---
Didn't they release all the standard ops for free?
---
Holy shit. I made this EXACT comment over a year ago on my old account. Just like now, nobody realised i was joking. 
---
Deja vu.
---
I’ve only played secure for ranked since the start of the game. However I am glad with their changes. Now whenever you get into a solo queued ranked game, everybody believes they’re a fragger. They think they can win the game, not joining the party or communicating with the rest of the team. If you don’t communicate in bomb, you WILL lose. It’s really going to make ranked extremely competitive. Right now the newcomer mode/casual mode is filled with teamkilling and smurfs. I think it will really separate the player base and more of the newcomer/casual games won’t be as bad for people who just want to play and not get competitive. Sounds like you’re just complaining because you don’t have anyone to play with. Gotta start making some teams and finding good players you match up with.
---
They were free for a short while, to entice people to buy the game then.
---
He looks happy.
---
I think they knew that the ranked playerbase was small and dwindling. Chased too many people away with lack of maps and things like no 2 or less queue to avoid sweaty 5 stacks. Probably doing what they can to keep hold of the last few super tryhard bomb players and keep them happy.
---
Upvote for the correct use of “peaked”.
---
Oh, dang that sucks. Thanks for telling me tho.
---
Next operator will dark-souls fat roll around the map non-stop.
---
I am utterly confused. I didn’t even see anything happen..
---
Except. It doesn't put everyone on the same playing. Especially not on console. There are a lot more M&amp;K players on bomb than any other game mode. Also people like me (play 3-1 player) have to adapt to bomb where as people who only played bomb are going to have an advantage.
---
Warden is going to be one of the worst ops in the game.  His gadget requires way too many variables.  He'll have to sit on site for a couple of minutes and HOPE that the enemy uses flashes or smoke just for him to do anything of value.  If they're not using smokes or flashes then you're sitting there with a 1 speed OP with a shitty SMG.
---
Yes there is, but YOU brough that up yourself with your "you'd rather have the one we have now" when someone said they don't want the original one  
---
We were talking about those two choices, and i'm telling you the current one isn't as bad as the previous
---
it will come y4s3
---
Good enough that I would hazard a guess that he is in broadcasting as a career.
---
For those who don’t know, cav is in a lesbian relationship with twitch. It was pretty much revealed in Ghost Recon: wild lands
---
Aren't they supposed to take the bullet? I imagine they must be wearing bullet proof vests full of armour plates underneath those suits.
---
I agree with this completely! I guess the one good change is, I'll more likely find a game if I try sneak a game in before work in the morning.

Twitch 2 is too low, Blackbeard 1 is too low, Capitao 2 is too low, Jackal 3 is WAY too high, Lion 1 is way too low.
---
Smoke 2 is too low, Castle 2 is too low, Ela 1 is WAY too low and Vigil is probably a 2.
---
Gridlock dies before she gets a chance to use her gadget. lolz
---
i opened over 800 packs and haven't got it....
---
Puts it on more of a level playing field, my bad, i play on console as well and the amount of m&amp;k plays has become ridiculous but by then putting everyone on the same queue it can become ubisofts next goal to isolate the m&amp;k players. I've only played bomb my whole time on ranked and its only recently there has been an excesisve amount of m&amp;k players
---
Also make Ela a 50 since you need to be beaulo to use her gun.
---
smoke's elite skin IS the joke
---
I mean it does erase money. You are giving away free premium currency which means people have to spend less. Doesn’t matter how many people do it, if they found out you could get a free 5 to 10 bucks of currency for a couple hours of playing a game you wanted to play... lot will do that. Now that’s less incentive to pay money for the currency. There’s no way Ubisoft will ever do that.
---
No, the only reason twitch was there was to get her back into rainbow
---
That was easily solved in prior seasons to the back of said Mira's head before she could finish placing those deathtraps.
---
See you're correct with most of what you're saying... You do have to communicate. But what you fail to understand is that everyone's circumstances are different. I'm a 27 year old man with a child. The only time I get to play is nights (some times early mornings), therefore either A. I can't communicate because I don't want to wake my family up or B. I don't fancy communicating with people who are still in school and illegally playing the game given their age. So whilst my circumstances are specific, it shouldn't be a neccesity that you have to communicate and join a squad.

I dont get it neither i played secure since Operation Health on ps4 (PSN: Ultradani15  if someone wants a prove), i tryed hostage and Bomb with my Squad no one enjoyed it at all since its completely diffrent ( that isnt a bad thing bcs ppl have diffrent tastes). 2. I dont see myself as a Pro in the Future neither does the Majority of console Players since there arent many Hightier  Pro Events for ps4 &amp; Xbox so why the hell do we get forced to Play a Mode i dont enjoy at all and quit  one which de enjoy for 2+ Years?!( 4 out of 7 of my m8s , 3 of them 200+ lvl gonna quit after burnt horizon) Ubi basicly kills its own fanbase ...

Yes, but when they broke into her apartment, the ghost noticed a picture of cav and what they assumed was her boyfriend. Twitch later re assured them, that, he was her brother. They I asked how could she be so sure and she said something a long the lines of “trust me she wouldn’t have a boyfriend” 
---
Also, in later dialogue, they clearly indicate about their relationship when, twitch is talking to cav.

Ooh, that’s actually a cool looking AR! Never seen that style for them. I would probably make it have no Acog but make it in line with what Vigil’s K1A is in terms of stats. That would seem fair.
---
its not just those windows, perspective is fucked lately. People see you and you cant see them.
---

Someone new to the game is most definitely not going to find the stallion kick of the c8 easy and don't get me started on proper vertical play.

Console right? Seems to be a normal thing on console. People leave for dumb reasons and it's put me off playing the game so much.
---
Sure it does but there is no doubt that it will provent those agressive plays and players. Imagine you run out of it but you have 4 players in front of u, u know that you need the whoşe ability but you need to wait for 12 seconds now.
---
but most importantly, be kind
---
I’ve literally played 2564 hours in this game. Given it hundreds of dollars. So much support. And still they never can fix things. A OP YOU PAY MONEY FOR IS REMOVED because they can’t even program.
---
Well that's your fault lol hundreds of dollars on Siege? That's ridiculous lol
---
4:3 85 fov
---
No u dont. U just wait like 1 second. It starts recharging again and u can use it even with the gauge like only 20% or less full

I understand but then the flags covered up, it's just for aesthetic purposes

Only if you still live your mum

I S U P P O R T E D the game. I WANTED to give them money, y1-2 were prime days. Amazing community, game. But no brain all aim, Ling abuseing, ash jager mains killed it day by day

---
I also love how they finally add pick&amp;ban to ranked but they dont remove the casual maps from the map pool :)))
---
soon™
---
Yes but it will run out too quickly. You wont be able to kill them all within 4 seconds with the recent magazine nerf. So you need to charge it for a good amount.
---
ignorance about brazil, which is a majority white country.

Idk must just be me then

I find Buck playing a LOT worse since Grim Sky. Used to consistently play Buck at diamond level but since GS his recoil is just too uncomfortable.
---
Or even let you CHOOSE what maps you wanna play, even if it’s like “you must have a min of 10 maps selected”. Either way I wanna choose my maps
---
You do realise this game is soooo complex that if a big issue for an FPS game is hitboxes, then they’re doing a great job.

Hit detection and hit boxes are an issue in every game. Deal with it

You're supposed to use c4 with Mira you heathen.  Why would you need a deployable shield when you can singlehandily win rounds with c4. The shield is pointless considering Mira camping behind reinforced walls.
---
Is this the season pass cosmetic?
---
Or that but id prefer if they took the shitty casual maps out
---
Yeah they always link there insta or twitter
---
I don't think you realise how difficult and challanging it is to make a game as big as siege, with all its dynamics destruction etc and make it run well on all kinds of hardware. Yes the game is buggy sometimes and operation health 2 would be a smart idea.
---
Aka villa, fortress and Hereford lmao
---
Spectre M4
---
Idk lol
---
can't you disable maps on preference
---
+ theme park, outback, chalet, skyscraper
---
It already does this. Just don't pick anyone
---
Enough we these filler bundles.. give us that GSG9 bundle that leaked a while ago.
---
-villa from your list and it would be the perfect map pool
---
You used to be able to but it literally did nothing it seem like. It’s been removed now.
---
Ur silent step doesnt even matter anymore if the players are in front of u alrdy. Idk wat u on about. Also cav has never been a 1-vs-Many type of op.
---
there's a difference in neglect and "we dont know how to fix it yet but we're trying"
---
feel free to leave and play other games like apex, battlefield, or fortnite instead
---
Objectively, the melee button is the hardest button to press
---
Yep
---
Look, I’ve tried programming. I get it’s hard. When people are working day and night, multi MILLION dollars, fix your fucking game
---
Could you plz make a phone version
---
Seige is the only thing that feels “competitive” overwatch is easy now, cod sucks, fortnite got boring seasons ago, and apex was neglected worse
---
It is such a good op for clutches mate and what ı meant by in front of u was the room in front of where you are camping
---
Ubisoft doesn't have a research team. They google it and pick the top result (if at all). That is why many of their gun models are incorrect and take several seasons &amp; constant bitching online to fix. Same goes for the loadouts.
---
This literally is everyone's excuse to games that live for a long time and have a big community. Shit changes, the game evolves and it starts off fun, then people take it way too seriously and start ruining it with all their bitching about how the game suuuuucks cuz of this and this and oh ya this fuck this. Then its not fun anymore.
---
If villa had the basement on bomb too, I’d keep it 100% I definitely agree with the others
---
Black Beard difficulty only has 1? i know the BB 1.0ver is ez but BB 7.0ver is not ez as before
---
Yeah, you right, but it's more about commodity? (I writte it well?)

It's something pretty secundary, but still coming back and say the same, people want his time inverted in the TS with some really nice deals.
---
The charm of frost with legs of T Rex its good, but not everyone have a good eye with bugs, probably you had some and didn't notice, still, 5 or 10 alpha packs, 10.000 reknown or a skin, something to make players play more commonly and trying things to see bugs
---
then get a outdoor hobby.

I got this game revently as well. I kept playing the missions till I did all of them. Then play someone like rook or doc. Don't try to rush for kills try to support your team. The most important thing is you win not to get 1 or 2 more kills. When you are a little higher level try different operators until you find one you really enjoy. This is what I did and I got my first ace the 6th game since I played online. Now I am level 40. I know still not high but I carry every game. Just try to be patient
---
You (other players) can hide various things behind a shield.
---
I do it because by leaving I give my team a chance to win.
---
i want to pet this cat
---
Monty and Blitz will frustrate defenders who don’t have a lot of experience dealing with them, but they both have huge vulnerabilities that can get them killed very quickly if the operator using them doesn’t know what he or she is doing. Even with hundreds of hours in the game I hesitate to take Blitz because I don’t have the practice to be consistently effective with him.
---
&gt;edit:actually answer and don’t be ignorant fucks now
---
Wow, someone needs attention
---
There’s literally GAME BREAKING bugs with every “patch” they have no idea what they are doing. The game WAS good. They just did what fortnite did, added too much and didn’t fix what was wrong.
---
Yea your definitely a plat 3 who thinks they should be diamond lmao

---
Maybe if you spend 30 minutes of your 2500 hours you would have read that.
---
War crime? Lol, if I dont wanna have twitch destroying my miras then I do what I can to avoid it.
---
Have a look on [R6Guides](https://r6guides.com) for things to learn. You definitely want to know know the basic ranked strats for each map, and you should be able to complete lone wolf normal terrorist hunt classic fairly easy.
---
It's okay if Ash is the first to die or doesn't do her job properly. Thermite in the other hand is vital to the team, so dying early or placing your breaching charge badly can cost you the round.
---
You can just play better so the enemies doesnt get to the point of planting the bomb.
---
It comes down to personal opinion mate.
---
This is why you'll always be a hard stuck silver. Don't talk to me or my ACOG ever again, you're breathing diamond air.

I’ve found that it doesn’t go through the floor in the setup faze for me but after it’s no problem

You talk about imbalance, yet you want balanced things out. What irony is this?

How can you be so toxic jesus, well, knowing that you like King George it was expected.
---
You don't need to sprint it, you can just wiggle your cursor around while standing at the edge.
---
I know
---
Vigil provides zero non-fragging utility for his team outside of his secondary gadgets and reinforcements.
---
This means that *you* are the entry denial when you play Vigil. Unless you stay alive, hide from the enemy, and remain a threat throughout the round, you're dead weight.
---
Mute can pop down his mute jammers at the beginning of a round, then commit suicide with his nitro cell and still guarantee some utility for his team. Vigil doesn't have that safety net.
---
&gt;IMO the ambiguity of whether they're referring to the skill floor or the skill ceiling of an operator makes this list even harder to read.
---
&gt;Buck's skill floor, for example, is very low. Press gadget button, now you have a shotgun. It breaks soft surfaces. His skill ceiling, though, is very high. His gun, even after all the recoil changes, still kicks more than most other guns in the game, but has a really high RoF and does a lot of damage per shot. He can vertical play like no other, and he has frag grenades, which are their own monsters.
---
&gt; Compare this to Dokkaebi. Her DMR is significantly harder to use than an AR because it's not full auto, and the utility of forcing defenders to make noise isn't immediate unless you're familiar with how important noise is in Siege. However, difference between an okay Dokkaebi and an amazing Dokkaebi isn't nearly as big as the difference between an okay Buck and an amazing Buck. When the team is ready to push, you press the gadget button and give away the general location of any defender not sitting on a Mute jammer. That's about it.
---
Its Irbis i think.
---
You mean Year 5 ?
---
I'm honestly just meming but w/e. Trash like you are inevitable. Stick to secure casual, kiddo.
---
then why you are not doing it?
---
you beat me to it
---
I use scorpion on console, and its not bad imo. It does have some tough recoil but its generally not too bad if you are using small bursts.
---
Why?
---
Love the song. Name please
---
season 10 comes out at june 11
---
I fire over 50 shots at his shoulder and 0 damage. I'm Plat 3 btw.
---
Wait im pretty sure the base ops are still free for the standard version.
---
Thats why they removed the Starter Edition originally no?
---
The Store page only indicates what dlc ops each version of the games has. There is no mention about the base ops. That would mean i would have to unlock th ebase ops even in the Ultimate edition. Kinda fu\*ed if you ask me.
---
Doesn't mention dog tags. This is a game and not real life which means they can bend the rules to fit there narrative. So let's say in the Ubisoft universe this position is correct. Also if it's how you or this website may say in its current position it would be blocked by the thanks dog tag. 
---
Pretty sure this is a charm based on the us/navy seal ops as you need to use them to unlock it. Also It looks alot better in this position then the one you suggested but that's just my opinion.

Well, when Ubi announced her removal, they said that those fixes required a substantial intervention; something not easily done in a small amount of time. The fact that it would take time was the reason why Clash, claymores and portable shields were removed in the first place.
---
My take? Probably Phantom Sight patch notes will be edited to include the fixes. I know it's quite a lot of time to wait, but I think it's better to wait some more time rather than having a half-hearted fix that could let cheaters find a way to exploit the bugs again after a few days.
---
gz
---
Yeah my bad
---
Smoke's gas bio.
---
What edition did your friend buy?
---
Maybe he got an old Starter Edition Key.
---
It is nowhere stated how many ops you have when buying the game. Kinda fishy. I thought it was naturally all of the base ops.
---
Is that a Holo on the DMR?  
---
How dares thou?
---
Oh thats hot, thats hot
---
One i was comparing the two dumbass, comparing it primarily to lesions trap overall. His trap is lethal and in a lot more quantity. It's harder to see and unlike ela's mines waste your time. Lesions trap can kill you if you don't waste your time in finding a quiet place,  and removing them while Ela's just wear off and don't hurt you at all. I never said they were useless but nice try at trying to sound smart on the topic you know nothing about.
---
As someone who plays with a dogshit friend, I'd say grab Siege. But here's some advice. 
---
Don't get attached to one character. I have people that I play with who refuse to play anyone except a small list of characters (one guy is Fuze. Blackbeard, and Smoke only). It hurts you in the longrun to do this, especially if you're trying to fill a specific role. 
---
Turn off aim assist, then spend half a year in Terrorist Hunt while you get to know the maps. You'll build up the skill to play casual or ranked CONFIDENTLY in no time. 
---
Don't listen to the majority of the community. It's garbage. And it's reflected ingame as well.
---
With this in mind, you'll be good to go.
---
What he's saying is that ranked is what you call "Sweaty" it's not even that though it's a game mode where it pushes you to win. Please try and argue that the other two gamemodes are balanced.
---
the only thing x/ square currently does is reload, so why you holding it down?
---
My loins just caught fire
---
Why aren't you using smg-11 ?
---
Yea. Either we were all killed by him and some noobs took the rest, or he makes a clutch ace. He was G1, and we were Silver-Gold team. Last round i was playing Mira on laundry, all team died and i was left alone against Hibana, Blitz, Capitaõ and Ash (my team are not noobs. C4rry had plat twice and he was making 13-4 last match.)
---
That looks much better than balded one
---
Shotgun thatcher in ranked ?
---
Statistically he has a low win rate. So it's obvious why.
---
tru
---
Caveria and vigil together kind of
---
No, it's only tryhards that think it's a toxic thing. Like /u/captainspider520 who is clearly a LOW IQ individual.
---
I hate seeing other people living out their dreams
---
Also, it's TTS so you're supposed to be doing shit like this to find bugs.
---
I play d2 i'm used to being fucked over
---
I am very confused by what you’re even trying to say here. Is it over powered or a detriment to them pick one.
---
Nokk: *I AM INEVITABLE*
---
Except progression is fun for me due to my competitive nature. To each their own.
---
Sadly, you are not unique anymore.
---
Ok then explain to me how teamkilling isn’t toxic. What benefits do you get out of intentional teamkilling.
---
They're doing it to condense the player base and make future maps/ops more balanced. Ranked and pro league, in what I'll remind you is an esports title, should be as close to one another as possible.
---
Its OP, follow my exemple above
---
It would be difficult to be worse ..
---
Now the recharge is not anymore 7s or 8s, its 1s
---
Fun fact about the last one: as attacker you can put your drone at the same spot and have the same view, defenders never look there
---
Ha
---
That's actually super interesting, I hope Ubi fixes that.
---
I load up all of the Ubi club challenges then play all day.

That is not my experience I see her every other round. Literally just finished playing and saw her loads. Shes just not in pro league.

God that's terrifying

YESSSSSS

It's recoil has always been just a bit too random for me (PS4) is it just because I'm bad lol?
---
Thank god shes banned.
---
My friends and I are terrible but we still have a blast.  Play about 2 hours a night.  If you are joining to be top dog then you've got people with 4 years more experience than you.  But if you don't mind taking a few knocks and just enjoy good strategic gaming, you'll love it.
---
Yeah me too. But fixed it. My headphones came both with 3.5mm jack and a really nice usb cable and fits in very securely.

Wasn't there someone called Epi or something? He was kinda a meme for a while but I don't remember the name.

Blitz 3?? Wtf
---
That may be a *bit* excessive
---
everytime I do, I find as soon as I drop my shield It get meleed aside! and then dead.   hip fire is my solution from now on!
---
Exactly my point....can't remember them and personally never heard of the name. Only names I know are the ones on the arcade machines in Theme Park but I'm not even sure if that's devs
---
They could, but you'd probably be the only one using it. She's attack Cavigil and like them, her strengths are silent efficient strikes at close range. I honestly think her kit is one of the best for her role; good primaries, good secondaries. I'd rather sooner give her flashbangs than a DMR, tbh, but that'd make her OP in certain situations.
---
IQ could become invisible? I haven't played in a little while so I'm not sure what's going on.
---
Sure, bruh.
---
French soldier FUCKING BACKHANDS poor german boi
---
I dont have vigil. But I think the spookier you make your appearance, the better
---
Testing
---
Vigil acording to devs is suposed to roam around to flank and confuse enemies with his white outline thing, and those 1 v 3 situations where one drones and the rest goes for the kill usually give him an advantage
---
The escalation of woah was getting me hype. Had me going WOOOAHH.
---
Then you like trash sci-fi, it's about internal logic, not whether its possible or not. Certainly old star trek had that. 
---
Again internal logical constancy. 
---
Also tries to does not mean perfect, but blatant mistakes like that are just lazy, this is not some low budget indy developer.
---
So lazy mistakes are for entertainment? I don't think so.
---
My goal was never to be condescending.  I was simply giving a watered down example so that anyone would understand.  If you understood I was being condescending I assure you that wasn’t my goal.
---
Why some really whiny people all of a sudden is "the community"? As I said, the amount of skins they can release is virtually endless so complaining that ONE of thousands was not the exact skin you expected is beyond crybaby

Sincerely, a salty Ela main.

I don't really think that your personal opinion should influence the rules of posting and since this is r6 related you shouldn't hate so much on this. There's even in the rules that you shouldn't downvote if you dislike/disagree so deleting and banning because you dislike is even worse.

Just hide in rooms around obj and pop out when u hear shooting
---
*89, homie.
---
Ugh, gross. I switched halfway through Operation Tormented War Veteran and London Electrical Gal, so my experience with her on console now is 50/50. I'd practice tap firing and keeping cool. It's easy to forget that recoil robs your accuracy when you're in a firefight. And best practice is if you can't get the gun to work around your play style, either play someone else, or play around the gun. For me Ela was and is hit and run. Keep the mines until you meet the baddies, tap tap tap, and scoot scoot scoot
---
As a roamer, your goal isn’t to only kill, but to either waste the attackers time until they can’t plant, or flank them if they allow you to stay alive. Vigil wastes a bunch of time since attackers have to either spend extra time hunting you down since they can’t simply drone you, or they have to send multiple people to hunt you down. Since this takes a lot of time, attackers tend to simply go straight for the obj, allowing you to sneak past their drones and get a flank.
---
Well, as a studio I still think the R6 team are trying to reach out more. As long as they're taking the feedback and at least considering options I think that's good enough for me. I've never really cared about individuals unless they're genuinely able to make a difference.
---
I think plague doctor works better as a Halloween skin.
---
Tips for playing vigil is dont rely on his ability much. Utilize his amazing loadout. What you want to do is cloak whenever youre going for flanks. Another thing you can do is cloak in the beginning of a match at known spots so they drone out and think youre not there, but then hop out with that boom boom bang.
---
Ngl thats a nice design
---
I’m sorry pengu
---
And he's gotta moustache
---
True dat, thank you my good sir.
---
Well from my experience, you hide in the map or position yourself in a place that the attackers would expect you, however his effectiveness come in his gun. He has a very solid gun that is great at range, so when u flank them try u can kill them from longer angles.  And if you hear a drone, activate his ability. 
---
In short you play him like cav + range
---
Your ability goes through floors etc so there are plenty of areas where the attackers can't be certain what floor you are. His ability is decent but you mainly pick him for the amazing guns, speed and impacts. Cav has worse guns, only useful ability versus Jackal unless you can get an interrogation off, which a decent team wouldn't allow if they know you are playing cav. 
---
Some strats I use is to have rotated prepped through windows that allow me to go down a floor without being detected. Cigar lounge on Kafe to mining is one, Bunk to Barrel is another on Theme Park. They drone me, I get spotted shoot the drone and once they start pushing I jump out (unseen) and keep my ability active below the room I was just in. That will easily waste time, and wasting time is a roamers top priority.
---
Imagine Ikora yelling "PISS OFF!!" while she nova bombs some cabal oh man
---
Tyler is love .
---
But... it will only last for one second??  I’m really confused, I don’t understand how it will be over powered.
---
He looks like a school shooter
---
Yes
---
I feel like the next logical step is Warden and Capitao looking around before saying biiiiiiiitch but Nock and Caviar keep showing up.
---
I am the cure...
---
Yep.
---
The original Team Rainbow was much more diverse at the start than Rainbow Six, but recently Rainbow has a plethora of operators.
---
The intez still counts u just don’t get the kill but I could literally make a compilation of ppl leaving before I can get to em bcuz of how often it happens to me which in my eyes is arguably worse
---
When i see her on my drone when im attack it really makes me play my round much slower because i know she could be behind any small corner. Sometimes ill follow a teammate a bit behind them so if they get downed i know she is going to be coming to interrogate
---
What headphones are you using that you can't feel that they aren't on the right side?

Mine are the HD598Cs and there's no way I can put these wrong, same goes for my older paid, the ad700x.

Says the guy who is crying about the wrong ammo being on a video game character.
---
If youre willing to accept all these things you cant explain, why is it so hard for you to accept this characters model is holding the wrong ammo?  
---
At the end of the day, does it change how you play? Are you gonna lose rank to this? Is the game unplayable?  
---
Do like everyone else does and *deal with it.* Stop coming to reddit every day to cry about it.
---
Ubi fucked up. 
---
1. Their official statement is that its pronounced Nuck, witch is utterly wrong. 
---
2. Her name is from the danish mythical creature Nøkken, and if you were to shorten that correctly she would be called Nøk, not Nøkk. 
---
3. Her bio says she is from the "Jæger Korps", but her headgear is only used by the frogmen (Weird name for the elite soldiers, but oh well). The frogmen are the utmost elite danish soldiers. Only 300 has passed the test to become a frogman since its creation, one of those being the danish Crown Prince. The "Jæger Korps" arent nearly as good or as elite as the frogmen. 
---
They should've done their research, any dane could easily tell them they messed up.
---
Oh okay
---
Each game page has both the content of the edition and a comparison chart. None of which mentions including vanilla ops, and since you'll get most of em by the time you finish the situation, this is a non-issue.
---
Elite headgear
---
With over 400 hours played, this is one of the better games out there when it comes to hit registration.
---
Who in the fuck made this.

Jager and ash are both 2

The 2 ops that are widely agreed that are the braindead auto aim duo.

Good lord

I adapt and overcome, R6 is a great FPS, the south africa server is not implemented yet

To have kill, my only chance is to flank or to brain the ennemies or play trap operator.

Probably the mira one is in early works, though lesion one was also shown and we got that leaked as almost complete as well.

What? You're scared that a 14 year old kid is going to tell you to lick his balls? It's a fucking kid, just mute him.

You don't HAVE to talk to anyone. You just have to be good enough to listen and play the game. 
---
I'm stuck playing on Japanese servers as an only English speaking person and I do just fine with pings and having a nice headset. 
---
As for your bomb only whining, get over it. Ubisoft already got your money, if you don't want to play the game anymore then don't play it. That or if you really want to play secure area go play casual, there are plenty of people that have never even tried to play ranked, just join them.

Its a bit more complicated that that, for 2 season i couldet really play since for some reason i had gone from 20-40ms to 250ms. turned out that the game insisted on me playing south america datacenter instead of one of the EU ones even tho iam from scandinavia. the fix was going into a .ini game file and FORCING it to select a certain data center instead of using auto. so that kinda makes me wonder how many others that are on the "wrong" data center when you see someone playing with 200ms+ in your matches

Hello SOHOWWHATHAPPEN, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bs2l83/nani_wtf_is_this_skin_so_sad/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Hell yea
---
Ubisoft is “reworking” the mood
---
Face isn't the same as expression
---
My experience on console is getting worse, people are now leaving when they're in a frost trap, not even a cav picked. Really frustrating.
---
Nice, the nose is spot on.
---
The thing is, a Thermite dying in the first 20 seconds of the round is a huge loss more than an Ash for example.
---
This difficulty thing doesn't take in count the impact your utility will have on the round.
---
If you are a newbie to the game, don't pick Thermite.
---
Its your second post about this, and while you may be passionate about secure area, it didn't have its place in a competitive mode, in a game all about strats and teamplay. I hated secure area, it didnt require any teamplay and made it easier for people to rank up even if they had no skills beyond gunplay. Whatever, it's not like you want to hear anything that doesn't fulfil your circle jerk anyway. I'll let you to it then, enjoy yourself!
---
&gt; I thought they changed it so that it still counts even if a person leaves
---
Trust me, it doesn't matter what platform you are playing on, it happens on PC just the same. People force close the game in ranked and then open it back up and join before the start of the next round.
---
There not the high end gaming headphones you think they are. I just found them while cleaning out my bedroom
---
Ty, I tried to get her nose as right as possible lmao. It's pretty distinctive
---
I agree it should be fixed in order to look like the flag more for proper etiquette, but I think it looks better this way for design purposes. Let’s be honest, that thing still looks badass to carry
---
It doesn't, she still gets the intel and now your team has to 5 v 4

I used to do that path so many times glad someone shared it to reddit it is cool to kill people from there and people get confused
---
This bitch lookin to mug,stab,or rob someone of the streets
---
its hibana
---
If you want to play it casually or just have fun - then yes, take it!
---
If you want to play competitive, be ready for A LOT of learning as Siege is complex and every 3 months there is another 2 operators that mix things up. Map knowledge is a priority here and you will need to force yourself to explore every possible inch of every possible map
---
TL;DR - hell yeah, buy the game
---
Elite does not mean different headgears. Elite means full make-over. Different headgears are introduced apart from Elites.

Basically just do the same as you would do with cav:

waste time, utility, and maybe get a frag or two
---
I have around the same time as you and have been diamond twice now.  It’s not good enough, especially this season. There a multitude of game break bugs (reverse audio glitch, skybox cam). It’s not in a good place.  If you want this person to get something out of siege then they will have to most likely spend the next 200-300 hours playing it.  Why recommend that if Ubisoft won’t even acknowledge game breaking problems?
---
Because just like when the game released, unlocking vanilla ops is now the only remnent of any sort of progression in this game. It's fun and you get to experience the operator video. It eases you into the fundamental ops as well.

Most of them are fine on both but it's really ela that's a problem. Its ubis mentality of jimmying in and not having more "parts". Like only having two playlists (not including &lt;50 playlist) u cant just stuff things in and hope they work. Elas a plat + worthy OP on PC but is gold at most on console (not saying people cant use her at plat but I mean the average player). That and PC is the prioritised out of the 3 platforms

1. English is my 4th. Language if you want we can wright in German, Russian or in Spanish . 2. It was my sec. Statement so why shouldnt I be able to put a "2."  there which means sec. . 3. Casual is A shitshow Full of trollers tkers and quiters and dosnt have the equal Options/Maps/Playtime as  Ranked and you as a " Pro League Comp. Player" should know that.  Who sayed that we want pro League expierence if so lets deactivate Ranked completely and only make it available for 21-28 days per Year "lIkE iN pRo LeAgUe BrO" + make it a best of 3 +  no solo Q etc. it's  a Game meaning that everyone who bought it should enjoy it and Not just the Top 1% which could play BOMB ONLY  . Balancing? show me 5 Major balancings that came for hostage (ONLY) in the past Year. 4. Kind of cringe that you Call it easy yet i doubt that a bomb only Dia squad could win against a secure only Dia squad in secure and vice versa same goes for hostage ofc.  The majority isnt playing in Pro League neither does the Majority Plan to participate there in the future so why dont you leave the game modes that other enjoy and keep trying to go pro Player with your Gold/Plat Wannabe  G2 Squad?

Not roasting but why do console players always peek so slow. Peek fast and you have an equal advantage if u go inch by inch they will see u first cuz they have way less to focus on.
---
Why tf is everyone whining about solo que😂😂 so you intentionally want the game to be easier? I’ve solo qued some nice red crow... it’s not that fucking hard. Y’all complaining because y’all suck.. period

#ENEMY DETECTED OUTSIDE
---
There's no pleasing this sub. Half of the time it's whining about the historical ones being boring and asking for elite skins with more backstory, then when ubi starts doing lore-based ones it's all bring back the WW1/2 stuff. Personally I think this skin looks great, and anyone who doesn't like it has a wealth of great headgears etc for smoke (some of the best in the game) to choose from
---
So that dryer was quite clearly a game breaking glitch, and thus was a priority. But spots like these do occasionally get “fixed” but they are not as big of a priority because you could fight against the angle.
---
Looks great! I'd love to see more.
---
I love it!
---
I've been playing since year 1 season 2 and I don't think I've ever gotten a sledge hammer kill on someone who wasn't already downed lol
---
Of course, and no I play on PS4
---
Thank you ;o;
---
LMAO
---
They were released in different seasons
---
Ty! I'll be sure to post more when I have the time haha :)
---
glad we didnt get this one
---
&gt;monty isnt as useful when you have a pulse playing underneath 
---
not every site has a "underneath". also if there is a pulse simply have 2 teammates hunt him down or push him with monty first.
---
just wanted to point that out
---
Imagine they were both on one team + Vigil

Have u heard sledge? As a scotsman sledges accent does my fucking nut in

If you have time, go and watch Ricardo Milos meme with this song. The song became popular only cause of the meme.
---
Ash should obviously be a 3, hardest op to use!?!?  /s
---
where did I get jacked in the arse then? my arguments were sound, and represent high level gameplay. maybe that’s why you didn’t understand
---
But how is it punishing them if the only one the RFF is effecting is the random?
---
ok thanks to cvs and intel they will get the best price on in a certain radius and a team of course and they are very strong and they are very effective?
---
Maestro is just a fancy Mr.Crabs....
---
Remembering to press '4' or the appropriate ability button at the start of the round is not that easy okay? :(
---
Do it, pussy. Ban me. Ban him. Ban us all, bitch.
---
Blitz has a high learning curve, but his skill ceiling also tops out below Monty’s, monty is much harder to play but if you can play that beast of a man well, the other team is fucked.
---
Ok
---
yes
---
You can't be serious
---
So he should fast peek a wooden barricade from across the map on a rooftop?
---
Could it actually be Jan their mother? holy shit that would ruin everything lol if she was Ela and Zofias mother I bet it's her.
---
What about Ash + Charizard art?:D
---
Oh thats great.Can I add you so we can play  together (if you want to)?My PSN name is NotMicroGR
---
noice 
---
i did sometin like dis on YACHT, wall bang with jackels smg
---
Most Mira's will want a soft wall next to a reinforced wall they place their black mirror on, so they can either make a small hole to shoot through or just shoot through the wall, that way you can peek with the black mirror and use the reinforced wall for cover, while using the soft wall to make your shots. Hope that makes sense
---
I'd assume in case of a dokkebae, but that's still nonsensical
---
I'll see you on Coconut Brah
---
Omfg, your drawing is so f*cking COOL!
---
My favorite Ghost type Pokemon along with Gengar.
---
Because that's not how this system works currently
---
If the RFF is on you any friendly you damage goes into you. So if one jackass does it and you turn it on for the whole squad, now any time someone accidently gets in the way
---
Or anything
---
They get punished for no reason and that's not ok.
---
You're the one not showing any evidence about it so technically you.
---
Didn’t you know? Filming your screen with your phone is obviously the best way to do it. Not like consoles have built in game recording systems or anything. Why put any effort into the post when you can get free karma from a super old trick filmed on a flip phone.
---
I like his animation tbf but don’t like his skin all that much. Fuzes animation is pretty fun too, but there’s a lot of boring ones
---
12 isnt crazy
---
Using a console but yeah, also easy
---
Ah heck yeah
---
Spook
---
Yeah, honour those who kill innocent civilians in the name of the holy oil war. As if, mate. It's in the game because it's the kind of thing you could imagine BB or Valk having on their gun
---
Your not showing it eithet
---
Ayy big mcthankies 🙏🏻 I'm glad people are enjoying it
---
Bro calm down it’s just thunt. Just play it solo
---
I hope she isnt as crazy as Cav. For your sake OP
---
most of the time there isn't a dokkebei
---
Ranked tho
---
Off topic but how do you get multiple ops for your flair like that?
---
Cool Glasses are nice? I suppose
---
Thanks, the Go4 might be a good tip, was hoping for something more documentation based, can be hard to get usable strategies from live games. But I like the weekly non pro league idea, might be easier
---
You can't do from x to y (where x is totally left and y totally right) in a fraction on console, this is one of the reasons why (imo) console diamonds look really bad compared to pc diamond. :3
---
just:
---
GONE
---
You really don’t get it. Not  ALL the squad will get the RFF activated, if they kill another squad member. Only the squad member who killed the other squad member will get RFF. But if a squad member kills a random, they all get RFF which only applies to the random. They are NOT BEING PUNISHED!
---
Can confirm, enemy team usually gets pissed when killed by Glaz.
---
*Sobble is surprised to see Gopnik on streets*

How does the season pass early access week change anything?

Valk is the thicccest in game

The eyes are absolutely on point 👌

I imagine with the new secret service character will be a counter to his smoke arrow soon, but that asphyxiation bolt sounds nice as hell

1. Reducing the damage on that specific weapon makes it all the worse, if you don’t know, rate of fire is king in siege, it can easily determine if you win gunfights or not. Frosts smg has the lowest fire rate of all the defenders weapons, it barely makes up for that with its high damage. Giving it extended barrel gives you that damage advantage from further away, plus the low recoil makes it easy to use from far away, only complimenting the use of an extended barrel and not a suppressor
---
2. If you anchor with frost there is no need to be silent, they know you’re in the objective
---
3. Reflex sight is a good sight for far range
---
4. you’re right
---
5. You’re right about the frost mats, but spray and pray with frost is very unreliable because of it’s low fire rate, if your that type of guy who likes to spray down a door when you know someone is there I suggest maestro, he’s an anchor, has a high capacity, high fire rate lmg, and has two cameras that can’t be destroyed, which get more intel than a broken frost mat
---
What am I looking at? my screen keeps going fuzzy on the sides
---
After the latest buff he went from being pretty alright to being one of the best ops in the game. Guns are meh, hard hitting, slow firing and lots of recoil. That being said his gadget is amazing now, Bandit tricking is a thing of the past with Caps new fire darts, Black Mirrors either become death traps or are rendered useless thanks to smokes and fire darts, and lastly his darts bypass Jäger. If you're a team player Cap is a top pick right now.
---
I want a Nokk head gear that is a smiley face drawn on her cloth thing

Toxic is any behavior done to belittle or compromise your team or teammates.
---
Console gets screwed over more, love the ideas. I know it's not realistic to have the TTS on console on well but it's just frustrating
---
What do you mean by clutter?
---
k
---
Not me
---
That's disgusting. They abuse the good faith of the game's trust. Reduces the quality of the game and forces game industries to disregard rejoin at connection loss...
---
You look so vigil, that I think you actually lost your family.
---
Honestly so do I, me and some friends were doing strat roulette and we had to all use shield operators.
---
All I can say is that keep playing the game, don’t give up and don’t listen to people saying that you’re bad, everyone was bad at one point. And play as much ranked as possible without worrying about your rank. For your aim, I would say start with low sensitivity and gradually increase it by 5-10 when u feel like you’re comfortable enough with it.
---
Nope this was made with Rainmeter

Love her!! She's my main now!! I will be keeping this 😁

If you think about it Gridlock is like an Molotov operator.   
---
Her gadget blocks hallways and common flanking routes - as a molotov would do. At least a molotov should be used for that, not for frags.
---
No clue
---
Kinky
---
some of games have skins for such stuff!
---
.
---
You know who also slows down the game and annoys people?
---
Echo, Lesion, Mira,
---
Literally the main point of anchors, not to get kills and frag to win the round but to slow the attackers down until the round ends
---
I was expecting a London-Punk- Johnny Rotten kind of skin
---
Yup, I’ll keep my not real gamer self over here and be happy not really gaming. 
---
Atleast I can shoot frost traps with my not real gaming ass.
---
It's level 50 but yeah, 100% worth it
---
It also doesn't fit the whole, "elite operator" shtick imo.
---
I would say diamond on console is diamond on pc
---
yeah, my y4 pass wont give me any deals either
---
Its not something you can "cheat" with a VPN by any chance ?

Not sure

I love it when people get mad about stepping on a welcome mat, the damn thing is not even subtle

Nah, definitely a faded purple

Next Update.

If your home Xbox is set to yours, then yes all accounts on that Xbox will be able to use it.

Bro thatcher is badass though, it makes up for it and he’s military looking boi

I think smoke is way better than those, fits the lore and is overall nice
---
Nothing.
---
But that statement from you was unnecessary.
---
Looks awesome
---
I got the game on a free weekend. Full version for 15 bucks I think.
---
That's what gets me. They removed Clash instead of all barbed wire, why not remove IQ instead of screwing a crap ton of other attackers?

Kinda looks like shadman but it looks awesome nontheless😍

This is the Mentality of the same people that call Siege,Camping the game

just because it's a FPS doesn't mean it's a rush in Call of Duty game, just because you suck at a game doesn't mean it's a bad game.

Go wipe the goo off your glasses and the spit off your screen, then recheck who actually holds the opinion that she looks like 096. I provided a link and nothing more.

(Still, you do have a point. She's hiding her identity, while 096 is hiding ... his?/its? face.)

Is it only me that thinks that Warden wont be that useful against anyone but Ying and a capitao trying to plant? Like most of the times people use flashes to burn ads’ and glaz will kill you faster than you will and shield ops have the shields in front of their faces throught smoke as well.,,
---
how old is ur gf 13?
---
Marketing.

Warden is like the dad that is trying to be hip

Dude it’s fine to play fortnite. The whole hating on fortnite for no reason is retarded at this point

You first.

Yea, I’m on xbox.

Second person to say that lmao, who is shadman and should I be concerned? xD

I'm sure they have data to support that price, but I honestly feel like if they were simply $5.00 they would make even more. But maybe they want them to be more rare.

You sir are the most unluckiest man I have ever seen.

I respect that, as a pc player who runs into people playing on controllers (regardless of map knowledge &amp; game sense) it usually does not go well for them and they almost have to use aim assist. So from my experience I just assume it’s aim-assist. Which does speak to the major differences between the methods of controls. Having had friends who started on console myself, this is also what I have been told. Although I did state that Aim is not everything, but it is a decent portion of what is required. Either way sick one tap, I just noticed a trend in the posts mostly being from a console game and had to question the legitimacy of the posts. Cause I personally feel A-A is kinda cheating, and I have been told that it is not on MP on console, but I think it might be on pc due to the disadvantages that come with controllers in the PC environment.
---
NSFW artist. He has alot of fans that support him lol.  Just look it up n type in Shadbase😈

This is really cool

Yep, I get the punk in school bio relation, but this is not the elite skin to make for him.

Thanks! Looks sweet

Do you have any other artwork?

In the few matches I’ve played, people have been surprisingly not toxic

Haven't played in a while, what is RFF?

Do you know when that will be?

Lmao im not @Obutu3 im just making a joke @Obutu3 about how dudes @Obutu3 watermark @Obutu3 is plastered all over his @Obutu3 images as if he's @Obutu3 *terrified* someone else will get credit.

I think I just nutted

Nice clip but valk shotty? Strange strat

Alright, thank you very much!

I agree with that
---
Now the 100k renown question is, why are you even soloqueuing when you have those many hours in this game?
---
"Thumbs up 90's kid gif"
---
Mmkay. I don’t remember the operator I used, but I was on attacker side. We were playing on house (I think its actually called Oregon, but I think you know which one I’m talking about) and I went up to the tower outside, the one where you can see almost all of upstairs, and they just kept going out of the rooms. I got all five of them just like that. I know, it’s a cheap way to do it, but it was my first one and I was so happy because I have a friend who played it for longer than I have and when he got aces, I was like “Damn, lemme try some of dat”.
---
Reverse Friendly Fire
---
Basically if someone TK's you then if they try to TK again, then the damage is reversed to them.
---
On pc to i gues, 2 time this week
---
Idk why, but as soon as I see this picture it shouts - "BITCH PLEASE!"
---
Reverse friendly fire. If you grief a teammate it activates. Now if you try to damage them, itll damage you instead
---
Yeah its been a thing since the community can't be responsible with glitches
---
wbu?
---
Something about the mask is a bit off I think. It's a bit edgy. Is it 3D printed or something? Or have I just never realized that vigils mask isn't as smooth as I always thought?
---
Finally
---
So if you are playing an op that doesn’t have grenades or explosives go fuck yourself.
---
If you have  &gt;20hp go fuck yourself cause she’ll kill you.
---
If she’s on the other side of a window frame go fuck yourself because you can’t get away from the window.
---
You try to melee her and she does the stupid spin trick.
---
Honestly I would rather have a Gu in my foot while being hit by an echo and fighting someone behind a black Mira than fight a clash by myself
---
Oh yeah that guy...yikes lmao. 
---
I'm only a little concerned then
---
Ah, so griefers will TK once and then resort to destroying gadgets basically?
---
That’s true I mean he has two watermarks close to each other
---
Understandable, it's a constant mood.

I don't think this is how it works. If you charge it, it explodes faster than not charged then you can deploy it on soft surfaces if you want to.
---
vigil isn’t...oh wait...thanks man!

This subreddit has always disliked the criticism  big streamers had onto siege. Of course they'll call the game bad, siege is arguably one of the worse/boring streaming games with an insane learning curve. It sucks to see the community take it to heart but i get it, the streamer may be false advertising the game being bad and a waste of time. I get it, but it's honestly not worth hating the guy over. As a streamer or one that specifically plays fps games, they'll dislike siege and avoid learning it. EX: Shroud, he took the time to learn the game and became one of us. He likes but dislikes the game. For the streamers that play it for a day or two, of fucking course they'll call siege shit. Cause most of them play BRs lol and COD
---
Cant just run around and shoot things, has to actually use brain and is too much for him LUL. Love the doc but this is the wrong take

He could just be very unathletic.

It's the "clash of clans" yelling face that everyone has been conditioned to hate.

---
I’m down. I qualify and have a solid squad but always have an open slot. Psn : BLAZEYAWEENIE
---
I personally started to prefire and just shoot more and you'll be surprised and the lucky wallbangs and random kills you'll get. The TTK is so low that a lil prefire will atleast put some pressure on whoever is on the receiving end. Drone work always helps haha
---
I could’ve sworn it did. I’ll edit it out then! Thank you.
---
Yes. The angle that you throw it at also affects it
---
Any flash can flash you if you are not looking depending on how close they are. I believe the flash range for blitz while not looking is like 3 or 4m but I could be wrong. Regular Flash grenades have a shorter range and Ying candelas have a slightly longer range because of how they shoot.
---
This is now canon.

...is that my dad with vigil?

Multiple games on xbox do have TTS. Pubg, crackdown 3, halo, minecraft etc. Its done through the windows insider program however.

Yeah, I don’t understand why it’s everyone’s wet dream to remove a mode they don’t even play, and don’t have to.

I hope so
---
It's not the point. I solo queue. I don't suck at the game. But when you come up against a 5 man perfect coordinated team with all the pro league strategies who have a M&amp;K on console its difficult. I'm a plat level player (was diamond when I was carried there by my team).
---
That's why secure was good. I could get by in secure without communication. Without watching Pro league. R6 are forcing me to be a pro league level player when I physically can't with my circumstances.
---
I hope your teammate let you get the ace...
---
It's especially a joke arshole
---
Many people on this sub stated out is wouldn't be poisones but maybe ur right so it's even better than a plain joke

Okay. We want the entire game to be predictable so there won’t be a place for luck?

MPX is usually better, but the SPAS is actually really good with a laser because it has nearly no spread. I also use the SPAS to open the tops of reinforced walls. Throw a cam on the other side, wait for somebody to walk in, then throw a nitro over the wall. Doesn't work on all walls and you can open them with the deagle, but it's way faster and opens more of the wall.
---
nice ty very much, it makes a huge difference even just moving a little, went into customs to test, thank you so much guys
---
Disgusting.
---
When did you start playing?
---
Not about test servers but I had a game today with guy who called me completely useless etc god it was annoying
---
So he could show the big brain play of sitting in corner with cav.
---
Guys, if we keep this up there just gonna scrap the whole exterior lol.
---
r/rainbow6recruit
---
This subreddit is not for finding clans or anything like that.
---
MPX, smg. MPX has no recoil, so it’ll be good long range. Use the smg for medium-close.
---
Exactly right, with the balance though, it really messed up her whole dynamic as a 2s2a rusher
---
you had the ability to glitch the shield to cover your upper body and clay mores were inconsistent with them sometimes not working i believe.
---
no problem
---
dockbae, got it
---
There aren't hackers on console so this will never be on console.
---
What do you know lol
---
Well I happen to be a plat player.. But now in the new season I guarantee I'll be a gold. Dont have mnk, don't know any bomb strats, don't have a 5 man team (don't want one either but thanks for the offer /s)

Yell at them to play rook if they just die anyways.

He asked when they will release (stable).
---
I thought it was for the shield claymore fiasco whats just happened, is what im meaning... Also never say never. Theres probably something out there not shared. Ive seen xbox pubg hacks.
---
Oh shit

great job
---
I like your style, looks awesome 👌
---
I cant see you

What is it for subreddit maester?
---
Yeah apperently you have to buy  base ops in every edition. Even ultimate.
---
If the things arent significant,  then pc players wouldnt say they need them.
---
IQ's difficulty rating is still too high. Just because she does vertical play doesn't mean that warrants a 3. Other ops benefit from vertical, too. Her guns aren't the best either.
---
A recent balance patch came out that flip-flopped how how they work. Not the fix we wanted, but I guess it's the fix we deserved.
---
You need it to play online, maybe another user on the ps4 has ps plus?

Too many spawn peekable spots,you can do 🤠3 run outs on the same side,and the general size of the map and how it's not very wide.

He has a shotgun secondary, probably just better off attempting to reload.

We won't be making any more changes to subreddit styling on old Reddit due to low traffic numbers. This includes not adding flairs for newly introduced operators.

Omg they just keep appearing!

Looks good man. Would look cool if you had little bits of artifacting throughout the outfit. Just as a little added flair. Might be a little difficult though.

According to the PS Store, "Full game requires PlayStation®Plus membership to access online multiplayer". However, you are free to play the situations and Terrorist Hunt game-modes as singleplayer. I would highly reccomend getting PS+ membership if you can, as the multiplayer is my opinion the main selling point of the game.

Also new windows and other textures, they should say all of this in the changelogs

I play on PS4 and plan to move to PC in a few months. There is a lot of cool skins and packs I want to purchase but its really holding me back that I wont have it in a few months. I hope the implement this feature because I believe they are probably losing a decent amount of money by not allowing transfer.
---
yeah, forgot bout it

Ah, a fellow man of culture

Clash and deployable shields are disabled because there is something wrong with them. Some sort of exploit or glitch idk. Ubisoft is trying to fix it. I would suggest looking at their Instagram to figure out what is exactly wrong because that’s where I saw it.
---
It's Baraka

Doc is fine the way he is.

are you pc player?
---
Main reason I stopped playing cav , got in a game where my teammates was telling me if I get downed leave
---
Oh, no. I agree. The K1A it's the strongest I could see her getting, but even that's a stretch.
---
Personally I don't mind the fact that they're recycling weapons, it's just the weapons they've chosen aren't that great, but I haven't played with either op so I'll have to wait and see what they're like, I play valkyrie quite a bit so I'm used to her smg but whenever I play smoke I use shotgun so I don't know how strong nokk is gonna be, I do agree that it's great we get to use older skins and they're not doing what they did with gridlock where they made a different version of the m249
---
I’m in EUS and when I play on WEU I have like 90 ping; however, I have god awful internet.
---
They tried to do the Beehive maneuver and failed.
---
They added custom flairs
---
When you edit the Flair, just copy the logo into the next flair and so on...
---
that is just stupid, are you like in a low ranked game like come on you would died on the spot if you were at least in silver 1
---
When your teammates call a peaker from across the map and decide to give it a try.
---
&gt;Nøkk’s gadget is the ultimate form of stealth technology. 
---
No it isn't.
---
I love lesion looks, but the "animation" is very lackluster
---
Maybe if he took those goofy ass glasses off and used his eyes he could see the thing in plain sight
---
Reloading is overrated anyways
---
Yo get this in hot
---
yeah, it also messes your vertical sensitivity. horizontal will stay the same but vertical won't. so like poster above pointed out, lowering the FoV before stretching is always the better idea. if you feel like its not enough, then you can stretch on lowest FoV.
---
Pretty sure they changed them form server to client side
---
It’s good
---
I think you took the picture with a camera so its a little blurry, mind painting it?
---
Idk why u guys hate sky and chalet this much but, what I wanted(and still do) for them to remove the song that played in secure. When it’s contested and timer ran out, it’s too loud that u can’t even hear footsteps. (Even if u disable the music in R6 it doesn’t blocks that song to play)

most of the community plays bomb in ranked. You are speaking for yourself and like 15% of players.

It's just a concept fitting her bio and training. It's part of her design eventually one of the first designs but surely not a gameplay one. Mav was a old man in the concept.

If I was you I wouldn't even try. Plane's shape just doesn't work as a map, it would be best if it never gets touched and remains in casual. But good luck anyway.

RADICAL DUDE!

Mother fucker I have analog condenser mic with an EQ I will out-troll  you in a heartbeat.
---
The main problem ur not seeing is that no one wants to play smokes, blitz or Ying now because every round has a Warden after 2 weeks in the live build he will be way better than now.
---
A Warden buff would be the same charging situation as nokk or a C4
---
Reloads after shooting one bullet
---

---
Windows: Add the ability to lower a window shade, this prevents Glaz from blasting one shots through and won't allow him to see through until after he blows out the window shade.  This also will then allow defenders to shoot out once the window shade has been shot out.
---
Spawn Peeks: Change spawns to only spawn on sides that have the Jetway. This allows either to spawn on side with harder spawn peeks or directly underneath, front or back.  Alternatively adding enclosed jet ways to other entrance making defenders not able to see attackers unless they risk being spotted first by over watch.
---
Layout: Remove all stairs to access lower level (Front and Rear).  Add in an access ladder through elevator at front and rear galley.  To Access Communications equipment on upper deck from cockpit direction allow this access door to be barricaded.  Lengthen the plane, add an additional cabin and Galley at back of plane. Allow wing access to the opposite wings and an additional hard breach door.
---
Objective locations: Add a bomb, or secure area on the top deck.
---
Ambiance:  This is an airport, add in more Ambient sounds.  Jets taking off, helicopters, APU's running.  Add more sound outside and inside.  One idea is to have one of the fire engines sirens on, or even have it blasting water on certain sections of the plane.

An ash tried this once while I was mid interrogation she accidentally abandoned the ranked match and got a 15 min cooldown and i still got the interrogation.
---
It was a 5v4 so we easily won.
---
Maybe something with your account is glitches then..?
---
I'm just offering possible explanations. I know a friend managed to get on GTA Online "without a subscription" but it turns out he just accidentally clicked to activate the free trial everyone gets. Wasn't sure if this happened to you too.
---
All in all yhough, you're getting a free ride. Start asking questions now you might lose it haha. But I don't know dude. If none of the other suggestions are the answer, then Perhaps you're just super lucky.
---
Ela, doing a spawnpeek directly from the window just feels out of place.
---
What do I think of what ? The wall colour ?

Hey sometimes you just gotta make the most of it. that's life advice.
---
I like the x button
---
This was part of his concept but I think going with nokk now was the better idea
---
Oh really welp f then.
---
No, we want the game to be based on skill and strategy. Luck has a place in this game, but not so much that it can singlehandedly win a round as it often does

Holy fuck! Finally!

Great cosplay. One thing that doesn’t look right tho... the skin around your eyes. Maybe try painting it black, so pretty much the only thing you see are the whites of your eyes
---
Noot noot
---
True. Maybe I should've used a different title lol
---
And encouraging camping really isn't a bad thing. siege itself kinda encourages camping, you're supposed to defend an objective. Also a br like I'm describing would really be a lot different from say fortnite and pubg. It would be a lot more tactical
---
okay.
---
I’m pretty sure the game does it automatically if a player is banned and has been in a game with you. Although it does suck they just didn’t tell you anything
---
He was too shook to do anything
---
I'm a big dumb.
---
Thanks! :D
---
I would love to be able to do this! Me and my friend always wanted to be able to put our clan tag on our profiles.
---
I just dont see this being well executed in a tactical shooter like this, just feel like before this can be even thought about so much needs to be changed with the current build.
---
The art team is not the same as the bug fixing team.
---
You just can’t equip skins in gadgets
---
Yes, you can. You just won’t see it in silver where you’re at.
---
This is very possible trust me and trust Zolaze. It's a huge issue on Xbox 1 as well and something needs to be done. If they don't boot the whole lobby they boot most of your team to get the win.

I know im being awkward but in game its a 7.62x51 nato and thats a 5.56

I used that spot while playing hide and seek in siege about a year ago

That’s why it’s gonna be bomb only from now on.

but it doesn't have to be the same build as siege. just bringing in ideas from siege.

Yeet

I don’t like battle Royale games but encourages camping? Dude, this is rainbow six, the meta is camping

There’s too big a difference in how those games play to integrate them well, and battle royales are dying

You claim its a large demographic but apart from your posts, I dont see much of the community being ups and arms about it. And no, I didnt get too choose, you could never decided what mode you were going to get.

Smooth 60 is better than a varying 100 through 144 from what I've heard.

* Calls in Seal Team 6 to fuck up target operator.

**Equipment:**

Nøkk. She has a much broader role as opposed to Warden, who is more late game or simply situational.
---
Characters weapons and gadgets are part of play feel and mechanics. Good lord ur such a dickhead and dont know it. U think ur being civil and asking a simple question without realising there are people who have thought about this and know their answer to it. It blows my mind u can be so far up ur own arse that u think ur justified with these comments. I would write u a 20 page essay on why all elements of all 3 games are not suited towards a battle royal. A totally separate battle royale that has stuff like ash's m320 or jackals footstep tracking, divisions deployable gadgets and ghost recons...I dont even know if theres anything in that that fits a br actually. It would be an unbalanced mess. Blackout has shitloads of things similar and it flopped because it wasnt fun. U have to realise the reason these gadgets are fun are because they fit the game they are in. Try putting them in a br ,no they're not fun. Just annoying, unbalanced. Give me a genuine response not just "wow ur a dickhead" show me where I'm fucking wrong. Respond with "yeah ash's m320 would be cool if u could blow up enemy cover" That's how u have a conversation not just "oh I was only asking a question boo hoo ur so mean"
---
Nøkk will for sure change the meta imo. All attackers are easy to detect but them having cav and vigils (pretty much) abilities on attack will but crazy for dealing with roamers. Warden brings great plant denial and dealing with glaz/smoke. Not to mention he can use the MPX which is one of the most accurate guns in the game. I’m personally gonna try warden first but I know Nøkk will be crazy.
---
Care to elaborate? I want to know if there's some big thing that would be a turn off
---
I would check our Rogue 9s videos on YouTube. He has a good video that details what each attachment does.

Well thanks! I'm sure my seemingly half-awake opponents helped 😄

Somebody said it was a theorized molecule that doesn’t actually exist that would be hypothetically super toxic/incurable

Renown and mmr are very different.

And I do agree with you on the fact that we lose the same amount with or without a full team. It also sucks cuz half the time you lose not points than you gain.
---
I didn’t mean renown fuck
---
I have no friends, solution?
---
Uhh. I don't get it. Why is there just an empty room?

Don't go outside wearing this, you might get murdered.

Any amount of decluttering is good, it helps with both load times and game size. Plus 99% of the debris is pointless and does nothing, this new cleaner Kafe looks so much better imo.

Black amory is fun but grindy. Get the forges then you get the fun. Play gambit prime if you think the matches are to long in gambit (it scales to your power level for evrey player in the match)
---
You was almost right but then you was so wrong. Plenty of post about people not liking the change. Others scared to speak up because of imaginary up votes or down votes for saying the wrong thing. And you can switch modes you want to go on, on and off on the menu?

"for now"... so you're telling me there's a chance? dumbanddumber.gif

Ying: same
---
I haven’t even got to play since the glitches came out but sure.
---
They hate us cos they ain't us.
---
Honestly I can’t choose either, but one thing I know is that they will be slightly above average.
---
Nøkk
---
She has a great ability that allows those players that love doing silent attacks to do them better than let’s say Ash. Now one thing I don’t like is that she doesn’t have an AR. Now I get that it may make sense as they don’t want her to be super OP with an Acog, but they should’ve given her Jagers AR. Overall though, she is a good operator that is made less OP with the glitch she gets when doing anything but walking and reloading. 
---
He’s really good as he is the only one that can hard counter those pesky Blitz players and flashes in general. He will be good, but not OP considering his weapon choice. Overall a very nice operator that plays very well and has some hard counters.
---
Gambit, i love this shit so much I even got dregen

So you run faster with a deagle?

I would say they are even worse in some cases.

Some other dumb fuck I play with said they should add a bolt action like it's not the dumbest thing in the world

I may be disliked for this but that corner peek on the door was my favorite and so little people used it

Hmm?

Yes! My friends don’t get this. Bomb is the true test of skill and tactical ability for both offenders and defenders.

I'm a secure main, though I honestly find bomb easier. Idk why.

---
What and get rid of the shorts no way man how else is he supposed to carry his soup cans
---
It has a higher rate of fire than most other attacker weapon outside of outliers like Twitch’s FAMAS, which is the dominant stat in short range corner fights.
---
This defines Nøkk’s playstyle by making her worse at holding longer angles (due to worse dropoff, damage per shot, and lack of ACOG) but her gadget and SMG rate of fire means that she can get the drop on defenders and fight on equal terms at worst if prepared properly.
---
Especially the gadget, which means that both observation tools and noise, which currently define a humungous portion of R6’s defender advantage, are no longer 100% reliable methods of catching attackers before they enter your line of sight.
---
The Deagle is also basically a mini DMR without optics. Sure, it’s no SMG-12, but with a muzzle brake or suppressor it’s probably one of the strongest semi-auto secondaries in the game.

Not my fault your grandpa was a filthy zipperhead

If you want to tell the whole siege community that, you can, but good luck. Idgaf if its casual or ranked, I wanna win and get xp, renown and a chance at a pack and that's pretty much everyone
---
Not just Testservers. Casual servers have alot of this right now. Idk what happened with R6S after I’ve been away since I got my ranked on the current Season.

Supposedly, her current icon was going to be changed to the one shown, following ubisoft announcement that they are removing depictions of skulls to cater to Chinese market. They later decided against it because of the community’s backlash.
---
Oh yes
---
Iq is fairly balanced already but that could be a cool idea for a different attacker
---
No thanks, I'm straight
---
Basically attacking mozzie but better
---
I say no
---
Also Lesion not Legion
---
I love winning too, but I'm not the kinda person that would get mad at a teammate for not winning, I see that as bad sportsmanship
---
Just increase the force applied by melee, but to all objects. Punch a door? Wood goes flying against the opposing wall. Hit a player? They go flying 10 feet in a ridiculous ragdoll that makes no sense.
