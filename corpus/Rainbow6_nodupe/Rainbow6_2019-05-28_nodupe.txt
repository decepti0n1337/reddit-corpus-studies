Dare you to keep collecting until the beginning of Year 5, Season 1.

Everything there will explode
---
Same lol
---
I don’t have razer
---
Maybe its something like that
---
:(
---
Ikr, same here
---
Hope that becomes a real
---
Lol ever try turning your phone to landscape mode? Also computers and consoles have this incredible capability that allows you to take a “picture” of whatever is on the screen. It’s called a screen shot.
---
I hate Cav too, simply because 1) she seems to have a seriously high pick rate. It seems like every team has one, and 2) She really ruins my strats. Seems like everything is going okay until she comes out of the woodwork. I try to play in ways the enemy won’t expect but it seems like she always knows. I was playing Villa the other day and the OBJ was on the third floor. Decided I’d breach the basement barrel and do a Blitz rush up the opposite stairs where they wouldn’t be expecting it. Guess who was right around the corner? Who lurks TWO TWO FLOORS BELOW and on the other side of the map. I was pissed, but good for her
---
Mantagne because I’m silver and can’t cope with that shield
---
Have you ever been spawn peeked by a Tachanka turret?
---

---
That happened to me last night. It was surreal.
---
And then someone on the enemy team picks thatcher
---
disagree, one ash or zofia round taking 4 away off start...
---
holy shit they ##FLEW into the room
---
No, I cannot.
---
B02 Yacht?
---
Mav makes free gloryholes
---
Mute disables drones, charges etc
---
Rook gives live saving plates
---
And Fuze kills the hostage
---
Fair enough.
---
Nope the symbol definitely says you lagged right as he peaked 🤷🏻‍♂️ just a simple lag spike my guy
---
You’re not ‘really good at the game’, ok? You’re just up against shit players. And no, bronze is no where NEAR the top rank. Not even CLOSE. Not even in the same fucking continent. Like, if bronze is on Earth, the highest tier is on fucking Alpha Centauri. Ever heard of it? EXACTLY. (It is a real thing though). Take a step down, and realize you are up against shit players.
---
It might be my cpu it is really old I might get a new one to see if it still happens I have an  i5 2400 and gtx 1050
---
Dock roaming on another level
---
This happens a lot
---
Absolute 200 IQ play on Consulate spawnpeeking with Tachanka. Happened to me once and I’ll forever be hesitant to spawn Police Line there
---
Oh no! The secret is out!

Do not use the suppressor!!
---
I'm lvl 116 on PC and I still haven't gotten a single Black Ice :/
---
Now throw some gu mines at the other side and you’re golden
---
Oh. I see.
---
dont reload while peeking corners
---
Before I built my squad I only did solos and I did have to deal with that BS but never got placed that for down.
---
But I'm also pretty decent and can clutch if I get sweaty.
---
I'm usually top two of if any team I'm on because I'm a team player and refuse to run around by myself.
---
If I see a teamate running around by themselves then I partner up with them and ping TF out of everything if that persons not talking.
---
Soap didn’t die after all.
---
I always lay down and then use it. Got a lot of kills spraying feet or people laying down on the cams
---
kapkan laser :(
---
it’s not the skin you think it is lmao
---
Acog on defense is fucking annoying and unbalanced. Nah.
---
I'd bloop the deployable shield, shoot the frost mat and then thinking I've won rush in to die from the kap trap lmao....
---
I just started last week my placement matches so im gold 2. And I dont think I will reach plat in solo queue
---
Germany,Russia and Canada all work together to prep for world war three
---
damn that is actually impressive
---
I understood that reference
---
This is so old. Old Hereford, old kapkan traps.
---
That's fucking horrible
---
for the millionth time. they can’t detect it.
---
Nick nick it's sledge
---
 r/ihadastroke
---
Pericote’s works are pretty good too but it’s much easier to find her works on Insta and Twitter in general.
---
Unrealistic deployable shield in picture
---
Clash was usable in the test servers so I’m guessing when Phantom Sight releases
---
I was trying to see how long it would go
---
How many flairs do you have...
---
Echo. I hate him so much. He's so obnoxious and he pisses me off.
---
The things people do for competitive advantage.. thanks for the insight!
---
That’s 180 R6 credits tells me other wise
---
Can we get this post to 420 for big smonk
---
I dont play hostage but yeah I agree with you
---
I feel bad for that Kapkan. When somebody steps on his trap, he's going to lose more points instead of getting them
---
use google or the search bar
---
SOILED IT
---
banditos battery would shock them as they vaulted but then the kapkan trap would blow their ass to smithereens
---
I thought the super 90 was semi auto
---
Can you send the clip I just want to see it.  Also this has happened to me before
---
No I see how you would misunderstand that. It was my bad
---
I like just got this one too, it's alright but it's for Jackal, my 2nd least played operator.
---
gridlocks a fat tranny
---
I mean it's not like most people don't make a run through on the other side anyway. I don't see this being an issue outside of casual when no one has mics.
---
Oh fuck yeah it is i was playing as alibi on clubhouse holding blue hallways in arsenal and a castle locked me out 3 times I kept tearing it down swinging no because i was already so close and on the 4th teardown he was staring at me ready to TK as soon as i tore it down but i have most hours on castle and expected it so TKd him first BOY did that 12 year old turn his mic on and start going at it
---
But if i dont play with a team as castle I usually just roam on a COMPLETE seperate side of the map because i always enjoy wooden barricading every single doorway window due to the TK from the random
---
Actually the battery would ruin the setup. No reason for it. They’d see the sparks and either not go or throw a frag/emu and destroy the whole thing. Instead put a Gu or two or add barbed wire
---
I feel like more people die by teamkills trying to shoot the cam than the cam actually marks
---
I play Zofia a lot, there is never a draw
---
This says nothing I'm honestly asking?
---
That is indeed the entity you mortals call by the name of Twitch.
---
An ash charge would get zapped because of the battery on the shield; Zofia's doesn't though, and yeah a frag would work too
---
I usually wait until everyone leaves until i throw up the barriers
---
Is this 4:3
---
Then you need a lesion trap snuck in there too
---
Chunked you are a gay god
---
I'm March, so 1000 yard stare Ash
---
Sure, it's deffo not u. Even tho the option to mute text/voice isn't there which is odd, considering it shows for everyone but yourself
---
Will the Kapkan trap blow up the ads?
---
I bet you played secure the area, plus against low end silvers
---
And here I am level 108 without a single black ice 😭
---
*Laughs in 1,000+ hours*
---
Nothing transfers you’ll have to start over
---
The fact that you saw this at all
---
*boosh*
---
**Stay clear from the blast**
---
No, you have to have an electroclaw instead of bandit and have barbed wire on the frost mat with gu mines.
---
I had a team of 4 diamonds 1 gold To my team of 3 Copper/bronze and 2 golds like wtf is this matchmaking, can we even call it ""MATCH""Making ???
---
i agree that those who steal art and claim it as their own are scum and should be banned. people spend their free time making art and deserve the credit for it without a doubt 
---
however, the mods don’t have the time or man power to ensure that posted art is original. pictures are reposted here every day and there’s really no way to tell what’s original or not. the only real options they have are leave it as is or ban art all together (which nobody wants)
---
Season pass owners will get the operators on the season release. they dont get it a week earlier than the release of the season. 
---
Non pass players will get the ability to buy the operators a week after the release of the new operation.
---
Keep it going
---
Here’s a link about the new season. Patchnotes/changes are at the bottom

If you're on PC, you have no idea.  On console, any and all of those things happen regularly:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fv-wfNArDU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fv-wfNArDU) 
---
Clip I recorded on Xbox 5 months ago, glitches include:  no Mute jammer sounds, no Twitch drone sounds, no gun reloading sound, no sound from Frost placing her mats, no sound from Fuze placing or detonating his cluster charges, and Buck sounds like he's right next to us but he's on the balcony outside Karaoke window.
---
What do you have to say chunker are you gay or not why or why not
---
What’s a mom
---
Nah I'm on console. Haven't gotten any of those glitches in a long ass time.
---
#3 is the biggest one for me. I hate this shit with a burning passion. There will be 10 seconds left on the clock for the enemy to diffuse a bomb and the last Defender on my team always goes out of the way to try get the kill as opposed to running out time. And what happens? Oh you know, they get exchange bullets and he gets the short end of the stick, dies, and blows the match.
---
I don't understand the mentality of that. Why would you chase a kill in those situations? There is absolutely no reason for you to go to them or to even kill them. Objective isn't kills, objectives are the room. 
---
As a defender you have more control in the round. You need to make the attackers uncomfortable. You shouldn't make yourself an easy target. Don't get kill greedy. Relax and keep them out.
---
--
---
Match I was in the other day: 
---
Defending on House, objective room was Garage. 1v1. Garage doors were reinforced with small peek holes made by Maverick on the 3 set side of the garage. 15 seconds were left on the clock. Maverick was too busy trying to find Kaid through the holes rather than trying to get access to the room. All Kaid had to do was wait him out and stay alive. But no, he decided to try to have a gun fight through the holes with Maverick. As much as our team told him to stop and let the time go to get a default win, he just kept going, and sure enough with 1 second left, Maverick got a headshot on Kaid and we lost the match.
---
I really would love an explanation for this one. In what case would a gun fight be logical? Maverick had no time to make his way into the objective room. Kaid was in a safe spot, but decided to put himself into danger.
---
I hate getting downed by her as Blitz. It always feels like “No! The only one who could stop me!”
---
*rocks. Fixed your typo
---
It really sucks I was lvl 140 on Xbox 3 black ices multiple legendaries now I'm 60 on pc
---
Then filter the creative . You cement head
---
They could simply say "Hey, if you post art post a link to that art's original source". That way, it's as simple as clicking a link to check for credit. Easy peasy.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
i use my reinforcements ok so not all of us are bad
---
I think that entry denial device will blow everything else up, making it all for a waste
---
Sometimes it works if you quit matchmaking and start it again
---
If you didnt know windows 10's inbuilt photos app has a video trim feature. 
---
Record the gameplay using geforce and trim it using the photos app.
---
I saw someone jump over that 
---
I think he said: “so basically what I’ve Ben thin... **slap** (**explosions**) ah fuck I can’t believe you’ve done this
---
Nah the lite skin looks like the cleaners from the division
---
If I knew I wouldn’t make this post :P  in all seriousness thanks though.  I appreciate that.  I’ll look into that.
---
Where's the GU mine?
---
It’s fun to bully with Glaz, it really is
---
No am not, I just play Tachanka a lot. Probably too much, nearing 400 hours almost.
---
[removed]
---
Sure buddy. Like I’m gonna listen to your opinion
---
Accept fate and find some friends to play with
---
Good luck getting through that doorway
---
So you’d rather have a group of trolls leave your game immediately and not be able to have them be replaced by other people?
---
Where did you see this?
---
Where is the stacked gu mines?
---
I cried and I don’t know why :(
---
cries in article 13 will ruin the internet for america too
---
I'll play my game however i want. If I want to try stuff and be serious, I'll do it. It's my choice.
---
Nobody can dictate how I use my investment and play my game.
---
Blackbeard is absolutely fucking useless. I'm not counting the times I've misused him or I *thought* he was well covered but he wasn't...I'm talking about murder hole and window confrontations where a high ROF burst chews through the shield.
---
IDK...in offensive roles BB should inspire fear...like how Cav does when roaming.
---
I don't think twice engaging a BB...and I often come out on top
---
Go for an Operator with a cam  - Valc, Echo, Maestro or even Mozzie
---
Its a different playstyle and every defenderteam needs one - especially with the start of S4Y3
---
^ This
---
Lmao you guys just scattered
---
In the TTS when I decided to pick Kaid
---
Nice bikini charm
---
Holy heavens I need to check this out! Thanks for letting us know!
---
Meanwhile I’m waiting for my lord to get his elite
---
You missed the head and that gun does only 20 against 2 armors, meaning you needed to hit 5 shots, which you didn’t
---
Yeah it was a pretty fun feature if you run into a friendly team that just wanna have a revenge match. 
---
Normally play like best of 3 or something while having fun. 
---
I dont believe there was official reason to as why it was removed but the people think it was due to people matching with a 5 stack of smurfs(friends) and boosting accounts. Which was fairly easy if you matchmake around 2-3am.
---
Damn russians.  Thats why they weren't in the Olympics
---
Ash "I" posing on them acog stealers.
---
And twitch is learning.
---
Facts.
---
Loose, yet well connected, I like the idea and it is definitely a possible connection, rather the one problem is the scandal element, it is true that Zofia's father was definitely wrapped in scandals, yet the part that bugs me is "her family would never reveal that if it were true". I don't know under what context they meant that with her family, but I think the scandal is that she is part of the Bosak family, and likely Danish royalty as well, if this is the case it would connect the dots. A queen and a high political figure having a child of two different nationalities ruling one nation would be frowned upon, and it would also be an indefinite target of blackmail and a huge scandal if found out. The relation is strong if you connect some very loose lines. Maybe there is evidence elsewhere or a release of her data yet to be had, so until it is proven, this is what we have.
---
Gotcha
---
Lmao
---
11-12 june ish unless they run into a major bug in the tts.
---
His Elite and his rework lolbs
---
Noooooo, you got this smoke just get back up and give then the card
---
This is not funny I did not laugh
---
Can you use ela and kapkan together? Or will one just destroy the other?
---
Thanks
---
You and people like you are the fucking problem. It’s called “casual” not sweat your balls off because you have an inferiority complex and need to shit on people to feel good about yourself.
---
Good Lord, have mercy on Ash.
---
Add me, PSN is JainBreak2. Don’t use a mic I’m afraid but I can at least be a squad mate for you. Be warned though, it’s feast or famine with me. I either potato every round or clutch like a madman. Wish it was more of the latter but I take what I can get.
---
i hate when this happens
---
I wonder when the dictionary meaning of casual will seep into your fucking shit filled skull
---
F for that bandit
---
But,.. But i didn't ask you to laugh..
---
I am definitely not crying rn
---
Ash「ez:)」
---
They should at some point go back and update all the models and textures for skins and charms such as these. It’s not the biggest of consents right now but if this year and supposedly next year is about going back and fixing older content then this stuff should be in the same realm as that. I like the quality of the newer charms way more then the older ones, especially ranked charms as well. Hell, this season’s ranked charm is actually 3D now with a Kangaroo holding a ball in the color of the rank you were.
---
My question is, which one will work first, trap explode first so it destroy the welcome mat and player may survive? Or welcome mat get him then the trap explode and kill him?
---
May your cow rest in peace
---
Thank you for the laugh, this was great
---
Flash hider just to lessen first shot recoil
---
Shut your pseudo intellectual pie hole.
---
Let’s just say that I have PTSD
---
What did poor smonk do to them

Oh that's not on at all, That's an appalling thing to do. I do not want these kind of comments here
---
Based on the fact that ever other post is people complaining that he doesn’t have an acog, i’m going to guess not
---
I was guilty of this once
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The guy wasn't even mad because it was such a stupid mistake.
---
Is that cyanide?
---
Oof. I was kinda hoping even though I'll only use his shotgun
---
Actually Ela is the worst roamer in game so Tracer actually has a full auto weapon that kills unlike Ela's.
---
It was 3 weeks from the start of tts on pc
---
Would you feel comfortable building a desktop?
---
LOL how is Ta-CHONKY at least not high E?
---
Yeah fuck you. Tachanka at least a B class.
---
Hit em with the ez
---
What the hell was monty doing?
---
Finka
---
Where's the barbed wire?
---
Oof lol
---
holy shit you just brought up some repressed memories of that song
---
So in 2 weeks?
---
Guess so
---
And here, gentlemen, you have a clear example of the prevailing toxicity in Siege. A ferocious beast, indeed. Shoot on sight.
---
Make an uwu first, then you'll be good.
---
i just wanna know why all five recruits are included
---
Don't bother yourself. He just is in a mid-life crisis.
---
Impossible to do on console
---
Yeah, people love "leaks".
---
why? (only have it on PC)
---
When I get hit by a kapkan trap I'll always think to myself "Oh shit yeah right they had kapkan, better check every doorframe now"
---
Burn.
---
This is why I love playing this game.
---
seriously what's so funny about tachanka?
---
Wouldn't the Kapkan trap destroy frost trap?
---
Coppers be like mine

*clink, clonk.

Any idea how long did that take you?
---
*_Laughs in under-floor Jäger.
---
what a fucking blessed video
---
You should work for ubi xd
---
I think that house can be made a tad better but I agree and I very much hope it won’t be like hereford because that was a fat oof. But I do hope they make minor changes like adding more hatches and a better way to contest garage or protect living room
---
Kapkan didn't see you there, either
---
What y'all think about buckmedaddy
---
Frost is one of the most underrated ops. That’s y I have her elite
---
For twitch a muzzle break might be better because of the insane overtime recoil
---
Were you silent-stepping?
---
thats exactly wut ive been using recently
---
Real shit
---
Frost’s shotgun is great, fym?
---
Congrats you played yourself
---
Same but do you see anything that comes to mind to change?
---
I can do it but it would have to be later like 4-9:30  pm eastern standard time
---
Mate you forgot the lession trap
---
I honestly don’t remember
---
Wtf. Thats just insane. That explains why Ive been getting 1-shot headshot with BB.
---
 Clearly someone is cutting onions.
---
Maybe getting rid of the windows on the far basement stairs
---
Can’t see it but there is a lesion trap there and I know it 😎
---
I can smell the axe bomb.
---
His hair is cursed 
---
Its like a jpeg overlay
---
Run outs were so much fun as bandit on Hereford. You sound like you didn't start playing till year 3
---
I’ve been playing since day one but nice try
---
Actually i replied the wrong comment sorry, btw there's nothing to do with the FOV and anyway it would be an unfair advantage. As i said the shield position is different for almost every player
---
Flash hider. Suppressor if you don’t mind losing gun fights frequently
---
Then act like it. Hereford house border and Oregon in their original forms are the best maps out there
---
Sacrifice before the summoning*
---
{-}7 praise be
---
Fucking gorgeous.
---
That’s what she said.
---
If anyone wants to see the whole round: https://youtu.be/UMuA1Dm6Dmg
---
I really only see memes and low levels use it
---
I personally don’t like to use it unless I’m in casual messing around, but if I’m playing ranked then I use the 556 (black ice💪🏻)
---
In all seriousness I agree that the map is so different it could’ve just been a whole new map and kept the original in the game.
---
Meanwhile me at lvl 80, my max is 4 kills in casual.
---
R6 Operation Duckhunt
---
thank you

Legend has told of this powerful, immortal being.

I was, in a life long past, a Youtuber. Once on a Minecraft server, I was accosted and kidnapped by a group of [Russian Youtubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbCJstMbPn8). It was marvelous. The video only got 5,400 views compared to the millions Minecraft Dinosaurs got, but it was super fun to hang with those guys.

LET'S GETTA LOOK AT YOU CaPuLlOs! *Pop* *Thunk* *Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt*
---
It's a pretty common gimmick in game design, especially in the current climate. That ***is*** the reason packs are designed the way they are. The less likely you are to gain an item through chance, the more likely you are to buy it directly. Alpha packs are designed in such a way that you have such a small percentile of getting an item you want, and as such you are incentivised to buy it directly as a result. You don't have to like it, I certainly don't.  
---
Should it work? No.  
---
Does it? Too fucking well. That's why just about every major AAA developer abuses this psychological mechanism.
---
&gt;You really just sucked the life out of an innocent joke on this thread mate. - u/Protatoe_
---
The joke was dead on arrival
---
I actually used jäger lol, I do love bandit but I was just thinking of the guns that are best for 1v5s and bandits fun isn’t that great for long range, at least for me, and I love Jagers gun because like no recoil and lots of damage so I used him for the defence, twitch for offence because her gun is just insane + acog
---
Hello Wicked20200, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/btx139/help_me_please_t_t/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Used twitch offence, jäger defence :)
---
You sure mate? https://r6.tracker.network/profile/psn/Josh_Corry/matches?mode=Ranked
---
To me it looks like 200 kills in one day....
---
OpHealth was a complete mess, it made me leave the game for months. Of course they need to fix the game, (actually what they should do everyday normally) but the game needs content, different operators, more maps to choose, new game modes.

How can 5 golds be put in a match where the enemy team doesn't even have 1 gold. Like, if there was at least 1 it would just be annoying but the fact that there was none really shows how shit the matchmaking can be
---
Good job, and good callouts
---
Obviously not. I think I presented enough evidence to prove that I'm right.
---
Most calming team you have. Nice  ace
---
Also, I used to play PC, I used same ubi account for both, your probably looking at my PC account which I last played about 2 weeks ago
---
trigger control
---
Game modes is an instant no, since they have already said new modes as permanent ones won't work in siege. New ops are coming and are very interesting. And reworks need priority first else ranked will be the same bat sh*t mess that it was.
---
So, yes, they are definitely going in the right direction.
---
Bro I barely thought that 2 shitty phone quality pictures of names and numbers on a screen would get this many upvotes, I thought I’d be getting 10 max. I wouldn’t lie just to get karma I just find that sad
---
Yeah I don’t get it, you saw your teammate die from there why would you peek it. Lol
---
That’s why I have my messages set to friends only. I don’t have to deal with this garbage and don’t have to get hate messages. It’s a win win for me at least.
---
The Majority of people disliked it after 1-2 runs of the entire thing as it was repetitive they would have to add a shitload more content to justify the storage space it would take up on systems. Especially as most people were done with it in the first 
---
Few days of TTS on PC. there is 0 point to bring it back but nostalgia and those that missed it and even then it would be hard to justify the extra download as again it would only have a lifespan of a week at most before being dead.
---
I would but I play eu and I wanna get plat 2 by end of season
---
Why not for ranked there is option which game mode you want go into would fix the problem? Say u click ranked 3 options bomb , hostage , secure so you know wat u are getting into
---
No it’s gr8 wish I could rel8
---
I really wish there was an option to get rid of all the "rainbow" and other colored crap skins and only have police/military uniforms/skins.
---
Shame.. where was the 720 instaswap
---
I want something like “Forge” from Halo, where Community creates maps and top of them are actually in map pool, it is awesome
---
Mate, you’re just gonna get reported for spam or have your post taken down by the mods. Outbreak isn’t gonna come back, it was a one time event for a specific themed operation.
---
Yes, it’s Ghost Recon Wildlands
---
For those who gonna aks source, it is Ghost Recon Wildlands
---
Compensator. It barely has any Vertical recoil, but it does wander off to the sides. Make sure you are using the vertical grip tho.
---
Welcome to siege.
---
FH.
---
Cause muzzle flash sux.
---
Ohhhh I remember that event. It was shite lol
---
GETS MY VOTE
---
Correct
---
Only if deployable shields were in the game rn
---
Yeah that’s what I meant.
---
Melee while silent stepping = down
---
Melee while normal = kill
---
I was Tachanka in this game btw😂😂
---
But that's the kill cam. Kill cam is known of showing inaccurate things (like the enemy shooting the nothing, while in reality your arm could be seen)
---
(☭ ͜ʖ ☭)
---
And it was beautiful...
---
They removed many awesome bundles from digital content.
---
I often peek wide angles with hip fire. That's sometime a good thing to do. You see much more
---
How could you do this to them...
---
its a gun that is easy to use for bad players. At high level it's super balanced and almost never used, this game should be balanced around the highest level.
---
Cumberbatch: _Is It?_
---
Kitchen objective is finally playable for defenders.
---
Sad times 😭
---
na, after mid gold most of the time the games are fine imo
---
Yeah... Shit's tough dude. I'm the abused one almost all the time.
---
original hereford had abysmal balance for competitive play, while the new one still isn't good, it is much better in that sense. Old hereford only had one good site
---
I just love the idea of that guy playing Tachanka coming back from taking a piss, and comes back to this.
---
Because Pro League has people actively watching a match for those intangibles. KOST wouldn't be hard to implement into tracking however. Would be better tracking in general than K/D.
---
no, the best maps rn are probably maps like bank and villa
---
Fairs, won’t pursue it any further, thanks anyway.
---
I 100% agree, they should buff her gun to make her viable, i think that if they buff her gun, her pickrate will raise a little bit, just removing the horizontal recoil and adding a little of vertical recoil, tbh the grzmot mine if played in a proper way is useful and i don't think she need a marker above the gadget since you can place 3 of them compared to 7gu mine of a lesion,but let's be honest compared to a lesion she is useless, worst gun,worst utility,worst secondary gadget (lesion has impact). So I'll invite you, all main Ela to don't use her, maybe if the pickrate will decrease again dropping to 0 they would notice that and do something

I am three Months late lul, but. 
---
I think that Three Speeds in general shouldn't have an ACOG, they have an inherent advantage over most operators by the way the game is coded alone. Your speed should allow you to close gaps quickly and then use your high damage weapons to gun fools down, not peek from a very long distance and get a free kill because you have an ACOG and a small hitbox.
---
No u
---
My friend has the same problem and a lot of people too
---
Bruh your playing lesion
---
Wont happen if u dont work for them
---
You can like a map. You can’t main one.
---
CYKA BLYAT
---
The other team cheated
---
Lol, the timing 😂
---
Having the shiel electrified will cause most attacker go the other way or blow the shield, the best trap is the one you lure them in. Also fuck ubi for removing frost shield
---
console peasants
---
In the event that you play against a cheater and win, should that player get banned, if you win you lose the elo you gained from the cheater, or if you lose you gain it back. Hoped this helped!
---
What is this??? A repost from Instagram to Reddit!???!! This can't be right!!!!
---
Suck on every other map besides that one.
---
Well that’s sad. Thought it was. I’m saying no to play with my homies that are high gold. Because I thought it was a bannable act
---
How would this work though? It'd take a whole round to type 1 callout
---
DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT PUT A MIRA ON AN EXTERIOR WALL...... Particularly the garage door on Chalet. If it gets opened you fucked your team
---
i’d wager a lot more people do have that, or at least would if it was an option. maybe your average silver player who sits on a sofa and has audio out the tv won’t use it, but they’d still benefit from reading what others put.
---
That's more r/whoosh than I can handle, sorry.
---
That is correct comrade
---
Some game like fortnite have that when a console player has a mouse and keyboard plugged in they matched with people that are playing mouse and keyboard on console as well so ubi could add that
---
suppose so, but a lot of people would oppose this change
---
Do we really need to increase queueing times just because some people aren't content with a controller?
---
Damn I see the ash blowing up that deployable barricade and the rest all going with it lol
---
True spawn peeking where you have no chance to avoid it is shit and a failure of game design but some dude just putting himself at risk to maybe get an early kill is fine.
---
True
---
?
---
That's why I love this community sometimes
---
I don't think they are able to have a TTS on PS4 or Xbox because on pc you have to download a separate game to play it.
---
Thanks for the help, we assumed that but it makes no sense as to why we would have MMR removed, I guess it's just the system being too basic
---
That's so annoying, thanks for the help
---
its fine, it would be your fault if you get killed by a spawnpeeker because you didn't pay attention
---
Not really though, if you see a set of footprints running into a room, you can assume someone is in there without wasting a scan
---
Then Zofia came and all hopes is lost.....
---
I placed silver 2 but my friend are shit so I just dropped from there
---
It’s like a $20 accessory that’ll only really be handy for one game. Until it’s more common for text chat on console games, you probably won’t see it obscurely thrown into one or two games.
---
*laughs in capitao*
---
I play with a controller, but have a keyboard plugged in to ps4 directly so I can use it as a b tech computer when needs be
---
problably rappel kick, i read about this last week or so, i didn't even know this was a mechanic in the game
---
Normal tags
---
That's good cause my teammates need better call-outs anyway and I don't solo queue so it probably will help them get better.
---
Yeah well most console diamonds just use MnK anyway
---
surely most people have a keyboard in their house though, it doesn’t have to be a special console one.
---
They should make TTS an own gamemode that you only can play when TTS is online. I think that would solve it
---
most gold players use one these days lmao
---
Or the little section between the map room and the kitchen on Kanal. Or kids bedroom on House, or the cellar on Hereford base
---
Sorry. "Client side debris across the board is a major problem" seemed to indicate that the issue is with them being tracked by the client.
---
RNG in a skill based game????? no thank you
---
Anything think a defending jackal would be cool?
---
I have seen 6 of your comments on other posts
---
Huh
---
I never agree to knife fights cause it always ends up like this. And when I say “no, I just want to play the game” I get flamed on
---
It would be for the best. Ranked is solo queue hell or 5 stack easy mode, because of partys
---
In the games where someone is talking more people often join game chat, and the call-outs often win games
---
He’s saying the engine might not be able to handle it, adding a steam workshop wouldn’t fix this
---
It won’t work
---
God am I happy I moved to PC 😂 Imagine being a keyboarder and still being hard stuck gold. Fuck me bro, they must be trash 😂
---
Plat always has been man. It's pathetic

***Hey, you forgot the source.***  https://twitter.com/emwhyt/status/1129181493337690112?s=20
---
Keep on squirming. You're wrong about Vigil.
---
Ubisoft is a company existing to make money not doing this makes them make more money because the people with still pay for the skins. If you refused to do this and constantly asked them they would have no choice but to do it.
---
If you knew how many Mk14s and CAMRS with holo ive seen....and it worked
---
my only question is *red dot* on AK-12?
---
What? You've essentially said your wrong because your wrong lmao
---
That defeats the purpose of a jackal in the first place. Anyways if he hears u on a drone he could easily just rush
---
I have to agree, and come on, most of the time you use the scan to make someone get out of cover before engaging or while holding an angle.
---
I hate gadget / melee challenges so much...
---
Wait clash is banned she can’t be there
---
*chanting*
---
Apparently they can't do this because of some engine limitation.  I'm no expert but maybe it would work if they registered every alibi skin as am elite skin, and just changed the gadget to fit the skin while keeping everything else the same?  Idk.
---
What the other guy said
---
Illegal spawnpeeking (meaning they look right into your spawn) is unfair, other then that it’s just you not paying attention
---
WOOOOOWWWWW
---
No I said you're wrong. He is one of the better roamers in the game, his ability is really useful and his guns are pretty damn good.
---
I’m The Lord Tachanka in the Picture, if you think there’s only one long haired boyo in the photo, surprise I am too under the Helmet.
---
Can you link the confirmation?
---
Genuinely curious. To Jackal Mains (Plat 2 or above) out there, does anyone actually memorized and used this? Seems to me like useless info. U dont really need to know who u're up against most of the time.
---
That's actually a great idea.  Having the holo show an anchor op rather than one built for roaming would be way more convincing.
---
Toxic for sure.
---
Yeah, which is what I...already said in relation to his guns, i don't get what you're trying to say outside of you value guns more and I value utility more?
---
Looks like all the fast bois except for elephant legs echo wears them Nikes
---
Added it to post 👍
---
Old days when ppl didn't expect to much for that kind of spawn-peeking
---
Good. Recruit mains should be universally despised.
---
You judge the ops as a whole...
---
What do you mean by utility? It seems we're using it in different ways.
---
Noooooooooooo.......
---
the guy who planted the bomb was trolling his team definitely
---
Or you can scan
---
Aww I wish I could play with you I love ****INVALID GAMEMODE NAME**** and ****INVALID WORLD NAME**** is my favourite map
---
R/wozh cring normy
---
Gadget, secondary gadget, how much he helps his team, etc. A good gun doesn't really help your team, with the exception of pre nerf ela I almost never feel like I lost a gunfight simply because of the enemy weapon, whereas plenty of times it's because of utility (e.g. smoke grenades denying the push or Mira windows limiting angles of attack.
---
Bandit Bulletproof cam maybe?
---
No :)
---
Fuze and the hostage should be farther apart
---
Besides, if we compare Vigil to his primary competition, Jager and lesion, both have statistically superior primary weapons, and incredible main gadgets in the Gu and the ads. Why pick vigil when these guys offer just as much killing potential and incredible utility as well?
---
another one just then! love ranked how it’s in beta
---
RFF ACTIVATED
---
Nice
---
:,(
---
They could make then use the same pose that the player is in.  If alibi is crouching, the Prisma will crouch
---
*Halo theme song done by 80 guys in one bathroom
---
So if you value a good gadget how can you say he's shit? Impacts and cams are really useful too...
---
&gt;A good gun doesn't really help your team
---
O_o
---
Wouldn’t be apposed to that at all. 
---
I just feel Shield is better as he can use it to protect his batteries if he wants. Fits the gadget and role more
---
Four Terrorist Hunt wins? Its usually three
---
Well the reason Bandit doesn't get a shield is because it makes bandit tricking too easy. You don't have to ask a teammate to bring it for you.
---
They need to add more gadgets in my opinion.
---
Actually, even if the shield has 50 hp, it will always block the first shot from a weapon that does more than 50 damage
---
yeah what's wrong stop crying. I had this happen to me, I learnt from my mistakes and I hit diamond.
---
It's time taste and memorize those footprint now
---
Need optimization for Ipad 2017
---
That looks cool

Currently using R6Tab, however if userbase increases, I will switch to my own servers.

Not optimized for iPad yet, you are correct. Released it last week.

How u get that blitz icon tho? I need

wow didnt actually think anyone will recognise it

What a guy. U took the extra steps to get that for him because he was on mobile. Dang what a guy.
---
Yea like I will remember each one of these.
---
How much did you pay them to play like absolute bots
---
You didnt
---
I'm pretty sure that you can't shoot impact nades. He probably was just lucky with the hipfire and got a headshot.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I suddenly have the urge to watch kingsman
---
Did i now?
---
Ya but GSH
---
Here is my guess on what happened, game starts with 4 on his team and 5 on the enemy. Another leaves right away seeing the disadvantage then the other two leave as soon as they die leaving op alone then he dies, takes photo. Enemies screw around and tk op wins that round since they tk’ed then the third round the still tk op wins again then they go try hard and op didn’t stand a chance. 
---
Thats what has been happening since about forever with these games.
---
top 10 photos taken before disaster
---
Yes, thank you
---
Sometimes magical things happen on console
---
Unrelated but what’s your opinions on UUNO leaving LSE and Joining G2 and Joonas leaving G2
---
Why Doc aiming at me i’m scared
---
Regards to the ash thing? You'd probably get more usefulness of you were to play her aggressively, but if a slow playstyle works for you, you do you. In regards to thatcher, the L85 is a great gun, and once he's us d his emps he's pretty disposable, but the L85 is strongest at long ranges, which is not typically the engagement range for an entry fragger, but if the gun suits you the most and you play it better then the R4C or F2, there's no reason you can't entry frag, it's just easier to do on operators with higher RoF guns like Buck, twitch, and ash.
---
Quite sad because I loved the roster. Maybe it does them good, however it will take time to see the outcome.
---
in other words, get better and win against people higher than your skill level with team mates at my skill level, i can do well but my team can’t as shown in that picture
---
Lol that's great, they tell a sub with 24k ppl and not the sub with 660k
---
Thanks, I have all my mains now
---
Охуенно
---
He just dropped the impact grenade when he died, you can't shoot them while they are being held. This happens with frag grenades, smokes and flashbangs too
---
It’s his stim gun honestly!
---

Me either

Isn't he supposed to be an American?

That clash tho, she look like, she killed someone by 360 knifed.
---
Oof. Just. Oof.
---
Wait what!!! Joonas left??
---
Only to have the EDD destroy everything except the frost mat
---
I just tried it, crouch spam seems way slower, and lean spamming was only really a problem when combined with the new perspective (which they sorted out) or crouch spamming.
---
Yeah, there’s a kingsman base in US too from the movies hahah

Too bad this will be obsolete in 2 months, btw where’s my recruit at ?

Yes but tbh I would pick smg anyway tbh because shotguns are just👎🏻👎🏻

I had that happen to me before

Well the six12 is anyway

---
This is the first thing i noticed and it bothers me
---
I assume they are reworking multiple maps at a time, and this one came to fruition first.
---
They have that mode, it's called casual. They are trying to make the ranks more homogenous. A Plat 3 Bomb only player is generally better than their equivalent in secure or hostage.

I got R4C (I hate ash), FMG9 (shotgun's better) and bucks pistol. That's sadly the best one I got

Ok ok I just didn’t think somebody could be that stupid
---
From what I’ve heard, it’s that G2 will be a powerhouse with UUNO on their team now, I’ve never seen LSE/UUNO play before, is he really good?
---
Holographic or reflex depending on your preference, compensator and no laser sight.
---
i fixed it :D
---
This is an MP9 or an uzi but not a FKEN MP7. Are you from switzerland though ?
---
Not a kingsman base but rather the statesmen. Similar but not the same
---
UUNO is a mad lad. Really good player. But he has to fit well into the team. Hope it works out.

Is it just me or does the guy on the right of the hostage look like Chris Evans xD

Lmao, loved using this one in casual.
---
If you did it from another angle and spammed prone, sometimes you could get stuck on the rafters inside too, I used to sit up there with a suppressed gun and shoot near, but not at people when they came past. I love using little glitches like this for fun instead of advantage, see how long it takes for players to realise I'm there.

Can we all just be glad we dont have to stare at her smiling like that when she blocks a doorway, just imagine how smug she'd look blocking you out and having the time of her life zapping you.
---
You can;t shoot impact grenades - if you're holding one when you die, you drop it, and then it usually collides instantly with the player ragdoll and explodes.
---
):
---
Downvoted for the ez in chat
---
The six12sd is better at long range, perfect from holding rooms from above a hatch, which when paired with lesions ability is OP as fuck
---
Jesus Christ it’s sad I can only play on console cause we can’t move the fast
---
Well I use 
---
t-5 with compensator and the homo sight 
---
His piston (of course)
---
And his impacts 
---
If you’re on a close range map thought the six12 isn’t a bad option as long as you  catch your enemy by suprise because it’s damage fall off can be the death of you
---
I’d be smiling to if I got to take the rest of the season off😂😂
---
I would change the stock on your weapon, and the visor curves towards your face where it shouldn't. Other than that, I love it

I thought I got ddossed about 3 times in one day. Then everyone died
---
What software did you use?
---
For me the superior weapon is L-5. I've tried but never made a frag with SIX (i am no noob, i can't just play good with SIX12SD, AA-12 and SPAS-12, any other shotgun [except weak ITA-12L and Supernova] is deadly in my hands.)
---
At least you can use the fmg9 with nokk
---
Blender, I haven't really tried others yet.
---
Not if I spend all my renown on alpha packs

Can we start a vote to have the announcer say "You're being trackled"

Hmm really do not know. Will be a new interesting constellation.
---
15x sniper scope with adjustable zoom and thermal vision
---
Just downloaded it now, looking forward to using it!
---
So now we edit comments huh? Okay, buddy. Show me the actual statistics of the FO12 in action. Empyrical data that prove how overpowered it is and not just its stats. We all know how good its stats are but as I said, every single shotgun is comparatively underpowered and again, Ela's shotgun is the only one that can actually pose a threat at a distance that isn't point-blank.
---
Lmao people getting offended by ez when he’s clearly doing it in good humor and it’s in casual.
---
Gotta love the reverse ace

Fair point

Mine only took 105 levels

if it was 3 plat+ and 2 coppers, then I would say it's boosting. 1 plat isn't boosting. I'm plat, I got to plat solo queuing, I just want to play with my friends and their ranks all vary, some copper, most are silver/gold, we just want to play, and casual isn't nearly as fun.
---
and btw, being plat in casual, people bitch and moan about it too. So basically, lower ranks don't want plats to play at all.

They removed claymores and deployable shields for time being becuase of exploits caused by them. Also clash is temporarily out of the game for the same reason.
---
Litterally unplayable! /S
---
Replace battery for Kaid butt plug, put barb wire on other side, Both shield and Barb wire electrified and squeeze a gu mine right in front of frost mat. *I see this as an absolute win*
---
I mean you can read my post but based on this comment I don’t think you did that at all
---
Good to know, mr. Bronze.
---
https://r6.tracker.network/profile/pc/WerIsBack
---
There were glitches with the shields and claymores that made the game  basically unplayable. With the claymores, IQ could turn invisible and some of the defenders could put a deployable shield in front of their face.
---
This is god tier.
---
I'm not in danger, i AM the danger.
---
Why did Frost traps need less HP?
---
Maybe try the muzzle brake that works just as well imo
---
Are you aware what empyrical data means?
---
Hello The_Giffer,
---
Ash was 100% going for that ace deny
---
Wait how did you vault through the barricade so fast??
---
Yes. Also i wanted to note that weapons are personal preferences. i.e. i play way better with AR23 than with L8A1, and red dot on LMG-E is very effective in my hands.
---
Thanks!
---
thats not what irony is
---
Downvoting because you said EZ. Jk good clip.
---
The mistake is that they DIDNT replace the lorem ipsum placeholder
---
Damn you should get a veterans discount for playing on this map
---
u/skeleroo9876 ay bro he’s lying on you

pretty noobie thing to do . must be a level 55

[Here's the full patch notes](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/btpkyt/may_27_2019_phantom_sight_test_server_patch_notes/)
---
Yes and the data I presented is that. I even provided a link.
---
Okay well stats wise the AR33 is one of the beat ARs in the game, and sights realy are preference, i use red dot on alot of defender guns
---
Ok I’ll try that out but wouldn’t the compensated be better?
---
Please, this is ubi, the servers are always taking a hit
---
Incompetence of the enemy team. Mozzie should have heard you
---
Welp I know what I’m watching today
---
He definitely has reddit because he posted this and more before on this subreddit
---
*USSR Anthem play*
---
i pre-broke the bottom of the barricade so i could vault through it immediately  and rotate into garage
---
ouch
---
Defo 👍🏼
---
convert me
---
It's because the shotgun is an arm cannon
---
Most ppl use L8A1 on Thatcher. I've met very few guys playing with AR23.
---
No idea, I wish they would explain those changes in a blog post since none of them were mentioned in the latest Designer's Notes
---
Using recruit (with m870) increases your chances of winning by 73.2%.
---
Not only you fuckin' reposted this but ALSO you cropped credit out and copied outdated version.
---
Clever
---
Pretty fuckin awesome!!
---
Yeah where ma boi recruit at?
---
It's a prove fact
---
This! I’ve lost so many rounds that I’ve lost count because of a maverick or I.Q. Running in and just doming me
---
Almost was happy for you, Then you typed ez smh
---
Holy fuck it’s annoying when people do that they just appear
---
The valk shotgun is getting used a lot now
---
Did uhh you just get offended over his comment?
---
don't worry about your rank I'm just meming. use whatever attachments you think are comfortable for you and don't worry about what people say are the best.
---
"That explains why my mom got zika, it was your mosquito dick." Don't talk shit about moms without expecting a reply.
---
That’s the point of it haha
---
Why did you put warden in the attacker stand noooooo
---
*I am speed.*
---
and the fact i was being tracked so it would have showed them i was upstairs
---
Omg yes kingsmen
---
That car battery defys logic when it electrifies a wall without actually touching the wall

Can't seem to keep my eyes open for a photo &gt;:(

How??
---
Why???
---
RECRUITS MUST UNITE
---
The m870 is sexy and so is the m95
---
Now I want Wardens gadget to be Harry's umbrella
---
Frost is consistently down there with Chanka in pick/win rate.. and Ubi thinks she needs a nerf. I don't believe the balancing team has ever played Siege.
---
Wouldn’t be that hard to program, it’d be more on the artists than the coders. It would probably be like 5 lines of code, tops.
---
*This does bring a smile to my face.*
---
This is gonna be impossible to fully memorize. I can already imagine myself spotting a footprint as jackal and saying, “Oh look a footprint. Better pull out my phone to see what op this is.”
---
*gets headshot*
---
For what  its changed the frost traps??
---
*I fear no god*
---
I kinda feel bad for that hostage...
---
Recruit is too OP for the game. He needs a major nerf.
---
I would have def uninstalled
---
&gt; but why split hairs
---
Because it's Reddit. It's what we do.
---
First result in google:
---
&gt;Empirical evidence is the information received by means of the senses, particularly by observation and documentation of patterns and behavior through experimentation.
---
You did not show any data. You showed the weapon's statistics and then proceeded to make assumptions that it's overpowered without ever seeing how it performs in actual situations.
---
Gotta hit them with EZ
---
100%
---
Alright time to roast these ops \*breathes in\*
---
Tachanka out here wondering where it all went wrong
---
Jaeger cloned himself 3 times so he can spawnpeek even more

Doc out here looking like he ate the clone of rook that was supposed to be there

cav's looking at iq thinking about ways to put a knife in her

Twitch looks *^(ANGRY AS FUK)* and decided to cut out the middle man and just make her famas actual ice

There's glaz, and then right behind him is great store value glaz

jackal is dabbing because he just found his pain meds

recruit looks like if sid the sloth joined a ct unit

Probably called that because the skin causes damage periodically due to paper cuts.

Doc just wanted the ace and you pulled out a fucken reverse card

Ok but what makes him so great tho

Pretty sure that has been and gone

You said ez, you're an asshole tbh

I did not find an answer there, that’s just a screen grab from the clip in the post?

I wear this shit on my Glaz just for the reactions tbh.

Don't get me wrong its one of his worst headgears, but the reactions you get during a match can sometimes be worth looking like your head is literal dogshit
---
What are his best guns??
---
Oh. Sorry but I’m already tracer, my lord.
---
yeah and that's what it is lol. Only heavy defenders have acogs
---
Its picked because of its recoil pattern, which makes it superior on PC, but on console AR33 is better
---
If I die to a finka rush I play trap ops for the rest of the game.
---
i thought this was my clip for a second lmaoo

Yes I did. The data is showed in the link is prove-able by observation and documentation like the definition says and I made calculations based off of that data. Are you saying the official rainbow wiki is lying?

Gotta go fast

I bought a black ice pacj in the beginning of the game. I have it on all the spetnaz guns

i used to be into penta before g2 and ive had messages with them on twitter before, they are nice people but pengu is v toxic

Nope just yours
---
&gt;on console AR33 is better
---
I play on console. It is. My comments did not make sense so i won't be making more. Bye.
---
Because atm they're broken. As in, with the new vaulting mechanic that they introduced in Y4S1 it means you basically have a 50/50 whether a Frost mat downs you right as you enter a window or as it normally should be. 
---
Even if you know it's there and prefire it it can still trap you.
---
Finka sausage rush is old lol

Yes

There are going to be in-game events every season this year. Burnt Horizon had the April Fools event with Plane.

---
Ahahhahahahah you are in everything i post
---
I was going to get ting but then I heard about how her candelas are inconsistent and they are just buffed flash grenades
---
And then I heard that her gun incredible underpowered and that it’s has the slowest time to kill out of any attcking operator 
---
So I don’t know
---
Bruh that happened to me and i was the drone
---
youre an asshole for saying ex..
---
hey my fellow polak co tam

Yes I’m Defo gonna get him 💯💯

Please tell me your method

Not many (if any) thatcher mains were harmed if the making of this video, a lot glaz mains however, were. 
---
This is my first attempt at editing a video, fun times.

Woulda been impressive if you didn't use a shotgun

Would be funny if this was year 1 Season 4. Lord meme dead, let it die so we get the rework.

I love running her lmg suppressed, the recoil is very manageable for me and I can lazer people. The candela’s aren’t great but do the job when I use her

M870
---
If only 1% of my teammates or enemies had your elegant, precise and smooth crosshair movement, I would be incredibly happy to play Siege. Most of them just swipe left and right with a ton of struggle and top it up with a shaky heart attack when they get a kill.
---
But what if you already scanned 3 times
---
A ace *IN* R6S is killing all 5. So it's not a ace, it's a 4k
---
Just fucking rocket ship straight through a window or down through a skylight
---
A 4k ace.
---
Ok I’ll look around some more and watch yt vids to see what they say
---
Because you say she’s good but many others says she’s god awful
---
None, there may be no language that could possibly offend someone, for then you would be toxic while they "are not mad"
---
Nokk and warden are in the wrong order they should switch
---
It appears his gear came without polish.
---
Sales happen frequently for ubisoft games, hold on a couple of weeks and you are bound to see one.
---
My advice? Get the deluxe edition on sale, it has the year 1 operators, and those are really good for the most part.
---
That was definitely an ace, you can clearly see who gets the kills on the side.
---
All ops can be good if you figure out how to use them best. But she’s popular in high level play for a reason
---
The reason they don’t do this is because one of her counters is to look at her goggles. If they’re fuzzy it’s a hologram if you can see her eyes it’s the real alibi. You couldn’t do that for every operator
---
Why are you copper boosting? That CheesellyNova guy is a gold 3. You are boosted.
---
Nice!  That’s like Christmas morning.
---
He's broken not on the aspect of strength, but of breaking down core gameplay (negates a playstyle)
---
So that’s what Tachanka looks like..
---
r/Woooosh
---
Smack talk is toxic.
---
Feel the same way. The sprinklers add to the atmosphere.
---
OMG ENDGAME, NO
---
idk I feel like smack talking strangers is just kind of douchey no matter how you do it. smack talking is something I would only do with friends in a joking way. I played sports growing up and it was always the douches trying to start shit 
---
just my opinion. I'm in the midwest maybe it's different depending on where you grow up
---
Following your logic if 2 leave in a game and you kill 3 it's a ace.... ok?
---
TheToxic95 silly
---
How dare someone else take your precious internet points.
---
Nice joke, one does not simply disrespect the лорд.
---
Shut up the GSh isn't a bad gun, you will never convince me to use the PMM, ever

---
typing ez 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
---
No it blocks breaches to.
---
Ok I believe that too
---
Apart from clash and tachanka
---
Just in the way that you can call someone black but not n####r. It's a toxic way to talk smack because it doesnt say "I'm better than you get fucked" it's just saying you're trash and a pushover. The best smack talk brings yourself up, and hypes the other player rather than just bringing them down by saying "ez".
---
relateable.
---
How long do you think it’d take to open them all?
---
A 1k ace
---
maybe I do but I'm really not, reddit isn't that serious
---
The people demand answers
---
Haha that made me laugh so much I don’t know why but it was perfect thanks
---
Doesn't that mean knife in Russian
---
Seriously choke on your own spit
---
Same here, I almost never see her picked otherwise.
---
i was talking about the hipfire, i agree on his ability wise, its why he has such a high pick-rate in plat/diamond
---
i cant use this post because of mira and clash
---
Yeah nobody gives a shit lol
---
The skin we need
---
Why the fuck is this tagged creative?
---
Is finka  any good as her ability seems OP yet I don’t hear her get talked about for being great and her guns don’t seem too good
---
God I love the Kingsman movies
---
It's the only thing you can respond. Anything else and they just hit you with the 'mad cuz bad'. Real creative bunch them ezboyz
---
The riskiest thing about this video isn’t jumping out a window and through another to face to guys trying to kill you. It’s trusting the RNG hipfire to kill not one, but two highly skilled operatives. Outstanding move
---
Sadly can’t remember his name 😅

The turret no longer fires bullets- instead, it will take 1 gadget from the enemy team and use that. If no gadgets are available, it will fire high penetration bullets that can go through shields. Example gadgets include:
---
* Ash's charges
---
* Thatcher's EMPs
---
* Fuze's grenades
---
* Glaz's thermal scope attachment
---
* Capitao's fire and smoke bolts
---
* Hibana's pellets
---
* Ying's candelas
---
* Zofia's concussion and impact grenades
---
* Nomad's airjabs
---
* Gridlock's traps
---
I want this.
---
Aside from this still being 100% controllable, running a holo on the F2 would still be 10 times better than the 417. One of the best AR's vs the worst DMR, its just never gonna be the right choice.
---
But you're fine to gain Elo back from another team that had a cheater? They were most likely in the same boat as you and didn't know the guy was cheating or queued with him. 
---
The system is fair as it is not biased towards anyone.

Crafting an experience that is competitive and enjoyable should be prioritized over one that is realistic.

Honestly, idc for the thermal... just give me my damage back :(
---
Macie was talking about this the other day on stream, was losing his shit about the vibrant colour changes.
---
I’m upset with you OP, you didn’t include the knife in the video.
---
It's not just every Alibi skin that they would need to make a model for, they would need to make a model for every single head/body/weapon skin combination available and with Alibi having 2 primaries you've just doubled the number models they'd need to make. Then on top of that, they would need to program a way for the gadget to know which skin/weapon combination you're using and spawn the corresponding model.
---
It's honestly just way too much work and man power for a single operator.
---
Even the older Halo games had pretty good holograms. All they did was run in a straight line but they matched the creator’s appearance.
---
No, it doesn’t. That high pitched noise is a combination of your glasses and Warden’s glasses turning on to block the blinding affect.
---
Might be new
---
As a doc main, this is kinda hot
---
I mostly get these from toxic kids the same nationality as me. They are usually some boosted high gold/plat players and they want to 1v1 me then calling me a noob/coward. So just ignore them.
---
Print it at an angle next time to smooth out the lines inside the 6. I printed alsmot the same charm on the weekend. ;)
---
Yeah but they get a reparation for the prejudice, I got a prejudice for someone dumb action.  They got points back because someone ruined their game, I loose point for just being in the game so I just waste my time while they get theirs back.
---
The stock makes me want to cry, top effort though

Typing "ez" was a dick move but damn I'm impressed.
---
Damn, nice clip mate
---
I think the issue with frost is when you vault the windows you get the shots off and the mat gets destroyed but you still get caught in it. It’s becoming far to common.
---
Pure luck, obviously
---
Or
---
Bad luck on you
---
*cheating
---
I’ve never seen that happen
---
Its literally one less bullet. All the nerf will do is remove the randomness that shooting a bear trap with a low rof weapon while vaulting through a window can have. Its not significant in any way.
---
Pure luck and skill on his side
---
Wish I had those graphics :c
---
If only there were dark parts of maps where you need night vision. That’d be a dope thing to add, but it’s way too late in the game’s life to implement something as game changing as that
---
Mom said it’s my turn to repost.
---
Warden and nøkk have to swap
---
Fuze should just be sitting in the hostages lap, their relationship is very special
---
That’s a big thing actually, where many different opinions clash on each other. I personally play only IQ‘s Pistol with suppressor, bc it’s the only operator (besides Cav, but you can’t choose there) where it makes actually sense to be stealthy at some point.
---
Does it run on AA or D batteries?
---
Happens to me occasionally and my friends all the time. I have clips where I’ve slowed it down and get three very clear shots onto the mat, then I hit it and it will still trap me.
---
She has the highest win rate for defenders. Surpassing rook.
---
Nøkk and Warden should be swapped (I know it  can't be, cuz it's engraved wood) but the art is great.
---
Maestro, Ying, Jackal, Glaz. I was orginly thinking Buck too but he’s probably more B
---
lmao, what an insult, im crying, going to jump from a bridge.
---
jk, you mad because you cant insult. BTW, its "osu!" and not OSU, and anime weeb isn't that great of an insult, go stick your wee wee in a fan.
---
This is possibly the most idiotic idea in all of Siege
---
I've got 112 hours in the game now and I've yet to get a single black ice skin lol
---
Not yet. I think this would be a great feature.

However I would need my own servers for caching this. If I can pay those from the revenue I will do it for sure.
---
Pure skill
---
*no4u cuts a new board*

Thank you, I appreciate it!

Oh yessss.....😏

Your best insult is calling multiple people monkeys. Maybe if you were decent at the game you wouldnt have to insult people that kill you
---
I’ve had similar experiences to this multiple times after playing the game daily... feels bad😂

Do you want earbuds or headphones? Headphones are better in terms of sound quality especially for gaming

Man, I thought I was looking at Hieroglyphics for a sec

Lol, its the first time Iv seen a gun do that. I guess it met with the mesh of the barracade, and got confused. If its common, maybe Im just extraordinarily unlucky, cause it cracked me up.

sorry but at least im better than you, and at least my best insult isn't "anime weeb", ill pee on your mum's ass
---
That would be so broken, he's fine where he's at.
---
Yeah but I dont rly count Mac as a hard breather because his gadget can be relatively selfish at times and doesn’t necessarily help the team.
---
give him a pair of jordans make hik three speed and buff the ump as well
---
No seriously though, I'm genuinely amazed you found the account I was last playing on. I'm guessing you managed to somehow find a list of who had checked your profile; because I defintely haven't mentioned it on my reddit account.
---
I don't want to get charged with crimes against humanity
---
The list isn't too far off of what I'd say, but I have actually played the game, so I know more what I'm talking about, although considering who I am, it's not by much.
---
but what do you do when one team bans thermite and the other hibana?
---
Ubisoft removed her because of an exploit, not because of how broken she is.
---
same
---
That was a headshot? WTH
---
I finally did the push to publish one but auto mod doesn't like patreon links.
---
I somewhat agree with this because on maps with many doors and drone holes, sometimes mute can’t even disrupt all of them, it would be a bit odd tho.
---
I might sound like an idiot, but what is the the point of the rectangle under the logo
---
\[DISCUSSION\] recruit should be an hardbreacher.
---
Interesting idea. Maybe after 3-4 hits it would break. But i don't know if a metal Sledge hammer hitting a metal reinforced wall would break it.
---
Gamer link is a good app to find a group to play with
---
Theres a lot of sites where thermite is pretty useless
---
battery out of juice
---
There's really no point in engaging with them further once they've reached that point. I just screenshot it, save it in an mspaint, then mute the guy and keep playing. Afterwards I make the report.
---
exactly! and you would hear a loud smash to warn the enemy of your presence.
---
Smartest play I’ve prob ever seen with echo in Oregon
---
I wouldnt consider random recoil as a valid way of nerfing weapons, because all that really does  is lower the skill gap and if bad enough, makes ops not viable - then the next highest rof op will be dominant. Its no different from bloom. When you implement mechanics that are inherently random, the winner  is selected randomly to an extent - the opposite of fair competition. 
---
Lowering a weapons damage with a 1SH system doesnt affect its optimal shots to kill since every weapon can one shot kill regardless of damage output. 
---
Removing acog is a great example of treating the symptoms and not the cause. Acogs are only powerful because hitting one shot to the head is rewarded far too greatly. The 1SH system is broken, not ops having acogs or fast rofs guns.
---
That mute wasn’t dead
---
How is this question relevant to my arguement?

Watch out I made a post like this a while back and it got removed for being a "meme" good luck tho

IDK that helmet lookin extra thicc.

I agree they're moving the wrong direction.  I'd like to see her mats get much tougher to destroy--to the point you need half a mag (or melee/explosive).  That way they would actually have some deterrent power.  You couldn't just automatically remove them as soon as you see them.  It would cost you something more substantial to remove them and/or for certain ops to reroute.  As is, they are only good for catching the unwary or those who have to push late.
---
So happy there patching this

Was confused about Frost's trap losing HP, until literally today I shot down with Gridlock's M249 while vaulting and still got snared regardless.

I'm pretty upset about the frost mat tbh.
---
compared to the 9mm and mpx, it’s not. why do you hold a huge grudge against ela lol? it’s not like she’s anywhere near her 4 grzmot mine, impact nade, no recoil scorpion form
---
No buddy. I mean the scope. Valk, Blackbeard, and Nøkk need that there above scope, on their sidearms.
---
Maestro has twitch and thatcher hard countering him. Before the need he was easily an A. Ying might be a B, but not an A. My bad on that. Jackal is too situational, most times they just wait for a ping then push. I also think his gun is kind of bad. Glaz just isn’t good. I was also taking into account the nerd coming in a while but he’s also just not the best. Once I kill 1 everyone else hides and he can’t push alone. An A tier should be able to get like 3 kills a round and I just don’t see that with glaz. Buck’s guns are just so bad I can’t handle them.

When you solo casual, it's really doing psychological damage to you

---
i wonder if the recoil change makes it unusable on console like hibana and ela and smoke
---
First of all I’m a lvl 225 plat 3 so I understand the game. I’ve said why I don’t like him in a different comment and I will be making a new tier list after I’ve played more of the people I put lower
---
Cool nice opinion
---
How I rush into awkward situations and it works out ok
---
No particular reason ;)
---
you also have to open a lot of packs
---
Oooooo nvm then
---
Of course. I realized that it wasn't intentional, but in the heat of the moment I was so frustrated because I was shooting the last enemy. This would have been my first Caveira ace, but there is another time I guess.
---
You mean Jackal’s AR which outperforms everything *SILENCED*? Whose only downside is that it doubles as a fucking spear.
---
How Much?
---
"having unpopular opinions makes me cool"

Hello damiang1234! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
His question stands, are you going to take it down and stop being a dick or are you going to be a piece of shit and keep it up
---
The very cheapest you'll be able to manage will be around $300. That would be a rig with no upgrade path and poor performance. In other words, it would be like 75% sunk cost if you want to eventually upgrade-- the components won't transfer into a newer build and you cant add newer components besides graphics card. In terms of performance you would be able to run older titles like siege at 60fps on medium-ish settings, some newer titles at 30fps at very low settings. 
---
My first build was:
---
AMD FX-6300: $50
---
8GB DDR3 RAM: $55
---
Bare Bones FX Motherboard: $40
---
EVGA 550W Power Supply: $60
---
Rosewill Ranger Case: $25
---
GTX 770 Graphics Card: $60
---
Shitiest used Hard Drive you can find: Negligible cost
---
It did run Siege acceptably, and even newer titles. I was using this up until February of this year-- it ran Apex Legends on medium settings just fine besides processor based crashes. Also played plenty of PUBG on it, very low settings got around 50fps. 
---
I mean it's a hunk of shit compared to 99% of builds, but it will play pretty much everything at very low settings capped at 30fps. I would highly recommend saving up for something with an upgrade path though.
---
Operation Black Hat would've been cooler.
---
I could not agree more.
---
As amazing as the M748 is I always end up going back to the LMG-E
---
Are you alright?
---
I think they did mention they were making a theater mode but idk when we will get it.
---
How do you check casual mmr?
---
Im sorry no. M7 is the only one i cant agree with this
---
idk if you’ve caught my original point. i’m saying every single thing about her has been nerfed to shit so why is her shotgun of all things driving you crazy. they’re easy to handle and ela is too underwhelming to be fully distraught about a shotgun of all things
---
Did you get the Defuse tho is my question?

Thank you, I appreciate it.

Don’t get me wrong it’s one of my favorite ARs. But the LMG-E is my favorite LMG. The things a monster.

What FOV do you play on?
---
Maverick. No counters and you can't hear his gadget
---
I am sorry but that's not a PMM    PMM gang for life
---
Honestly the frost nerf will not affect the idiots who jump in without droning, it simply helps people who actually play the game by droning. If you know it’s there it’s easy to take out, if frost plays tricky with her mats then she’s strong.
---
Works also with Frost-mat
---
&gt; Believe me, the majority of people who disconnect from ranked for whatever reason still want to reconnect
---
In what confidence do you have that information? I’ve ran into countless people who do it just to troll or abuse bugs or to intentionally derank.
---
I see what you’re saying now, but can’t say I know what it’s like because I never really crash or DC. Only time I’ve gotten out of a ranked Match is because I got banned for killing a hacker on my team. If crashing or permadisconnecting is such an issue, why is there so little outcry about it? It sounds like an isolated instance.

This is how i like my gameplay

---
Gotta go faster faster fasterfasterfaster
---
Nah the russian one is better imo, i just feel if i run out of bullets for some reason with Lmg E i acc wont have time to reload
---
Honestly, why not. If the community as a whole chooses not to play fortress, Hereford, skyscraper and any other maps. That’s a big hint to ubisoft to change those maps. Because they’re awful
---
Maverick because he is all around good. His weapons are very solid, his gadget is very versatile, and he is a three speed.
---
Nokk is very situational and requires a very specific play style and good aim. 
---
All in all if you main cav or vigil, then play nokk. Otherwise, Mav is better
---
Коммунизма Ведйоь
---
Where is this patch notes please?
---
Then no-one would play on a lot of maps and the people who actually might like them wouldn’t find people to play with. Also the game is best with more maps but if most people do want it out of ranked they should remove only those specific maps instead of just letting you have whatever map
---
WHERE IS RECRUIT ?
---
Totally a fair opinion and I’m not looking to shit on it. That said, Run..out..of..bullets? What is this gibberish
---
that's a cool bundle and all, but do the GSG9 really need another bundle? They already have a ton of cosmetics in the first place, and there are operators like Echo, Jackal, and Bandit that have basically no unique bundles.
---
Looks awesome! Nice job :)

That was a sick rotate but I woulda been salty af

*Fookin lazeh soights intensifies*

As many have stated in that price range your going to get nothing really, I purchased my rig 4years ago, for over £2000, and haven't had to upgrade yet, but by today's stands my rid is very good but not great, you don't get good and cheap with with gaming PC's a really good graphics card can run up £800+ easily. 
---
My only advice for you is to look up the minimum requirements for siege, then look to build a system from second hand parts, this will really be your cheapest method to buying a system
---
who's that blue guy up there. looks like a total homosexual
---
That is from a YouTube
---
Castle: AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
---
Honestly, I wish, but I also don’t. Because this game is notorious for randomly crashing, kicking players out, DDOSSING (on console) and other BS. I have gotten a matchmaking error mid game, how the fuck does that even happen?
---
I don’t want harsher bans because that affects me (I have a lot of issues with all of these problems)
---
Say if i were to do some (alot) of prefire things and suddenly i only have 10 bullets left, and there’s only 30 seconds left ehat do i do?

Like I said I don't just assume ppl are MnK I ask and alot admit to it or have it in their bio/username. I do think 1/3 games was an exaggeration, but it is certainly an every day occurrence.
---
Maybe region has something to do with it because a ton of the ones I see are boosters from other regions and because I play EUS most ppl from other countries get on my server when they switch
---
It’s hard, and it could be a pulling-out-your-hair experience, but it is manageable-more so when none of your friends play Siege like mine so it’s all you play
---
For PC, that is. PS4 Siege is a hellfire to soloqueue

The whining Baby insult, is crap tbh, since I can't whine like a baby if I'm not making nöices

That isn't ironic. It is fitting however.

I prefer casual because I do not enjoy the considerably longer matches in ranked.
---
5 rounds max is just about the right length imo.
---
Beyond that? No thanks.
---
I’m pretty sure this would be someone attempting to crash the server, welcome to the world of console where DDOSSING the server is a problem
---
I respect your opinion. But I wouldn’t watch another Flanked video if he was the last siege YouTuber on the site.
---
Oh wow thats interesting, thank u
---
Sömething bout the first 20mins of doing something is when u r most focussed
---
I fucking doubt that holy shit you actually don’t know how strong operators are.
---
No it... what? It doesn’t, and I don’t see how you can tell through the really dark tinted visor, but ok.
---
It happened to me too some weeks ago on Xbox
---
wow imagine reporting people for typing something in chat you must be a big killbuzz. Its an online game... cheating i understand especially in ranked but come on someone being toxic who cares get over it move on you must be really hurt if you had to spend 10 minutes of YOUR LIFE just to report someone. The funny thing is that they actually wont do anything I had a guy say that for me being toxic callin him gay a pussy and other mean mean words and he sent me friend request and showed me his live ubi report that was probably 3 months ago still playing the game today and having a good time
---
Edit: Mute before you get to the point of being triggered they cant be toxic if you dont know what they are saying. You must have been a snitch and run too the teachers any time someone said a bad word you know what happens to them? eventually they get stitches
---
Yes my bäd

The fact that IQ spawned ruins ruined it

Says the guy who reads entire comment chains that are hidden due to downvotes.....yeaight

Also curious how you never comment but then all of sudden blast out on this thread.....hmmmm almost like a smurf account 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
As someone who plays Frost a lot, it’s a good change, weaker weapons or slow RoF weapons often can’t destroy them in time when vaulting, even when you know it’s there and were shooting it. It’s the Kaid nerf I find dumb.
---
If you tie 3-3, first team to 5 wins
---
Like wha do they want us to explain
---
You think hibana is unusable on console? Lmao
---
the bearing 9 i meant.

I prefer the faster rounds of ranked, but I agree the matches go on a bit long.

He did the original post
---
Ying is insanely strong with any amount of team coordination, someone else smokes, Ying lights up the whole site and it’s practically a free plant. 
---
Jackal is strong not just based off of his gadget but also the c7 is one of the best ars in the game + pocket rocket shotgun + smokes is a really nutty kit.
---
Glaz is easily one of the best entry fraggers in the game. I’m not going to attempt to judge him off of a nerf that I haven’t played with yet.
---
Buck is also an insane fragger/breacher, not having good aim is a you problem. 
---
Maestro... fair enough I haven’t played with/against him much lately so I forget about his nerf
---
No it's not, and no

They are TTS changes, they will explain them in the actual patch notes.

1st suggestion I don’t understand, but it doesn’t sound that game changing or have any significant use.

2nd option sounds like a gadget in its self that would see more use than Wardens Glasses themselves. He’s got his job to see through smokes and stop getting flashed, and I don’t think this would fit him.

Smg-11 isn’t that bad tbh but the bearing 9 and smg-12 are too much imo

If you go around saying, "fuck [n-words]", "white power!" multiple times, etc, you deserve to be reported/banned (temporary the first time). They're personal attacks and it's just shit-stirring. Imagine making these kinds of insults and then getting surprised when people fight back with reports. 
---
To be clear, I don't give a shit if a guy calls me a "f@g" or "dumbass" or "pussy". I'm talking about shit that crosses the fucking line. And it goes beyond the game. People just act tough because they're behind the screen. I challenge someone to come down here to Brooklyn and call someone the N-word in the street. Watch what the fuck happens.

You have 30 rounds curved mags in your mag pouches ? Because the real famas uses a strange 25 rounds straight mag that is similar to the 20 rounds m16 straight mag, if your famas is from cybergun/ tokyo marui, they sell spare famas mags.
---
As someone with a good amount of time on alibi, I don’t think she needs this. It’d be nice but she’s in a good spot rn imo. 
---
She’s already got good guns, and lots of versatility and utility with her gadget + side arm. 
---
I definitely agree with Get_Flanked and his video on her, using her prismas to force attackers to hesitate and waste time is much more effective than trying to get kills off them. 
---
Placing them in front of windows and doors, and especially over vault-able surfaces that attackers must enter through wastes a lot of time, and gives you intel and makes attackers more hesitant over fear of hitting the prisma.
---
Wow thanks for the support my friends &lt;3
---
😠
---
He sounds really swell
---
I was about to say “ that looks a lot like the kill bikini bodhi got in his video today. The I looked at the user.
---
Where is your god now
---
Great work, I love how the germans (specially the defenders) dress.
---
Blowtorch to make holes in reinforced walls, there is no flamethrower
---
And to say that you placed gold 2 in solo queue is wrong. I searched up your rank and you got gold 2 in para bellum(most likely got carried). Your current rank is copper 3. One of the worst ranks in the game.
---
Hence why I always shoot off that bullshit, if the windows completely broken then it’s all good (most of the time)
---
That has to be the best Thatcher NA
---
Actually, there have been times where I clear see a frost mat under a window, and have very limited entry points, to which I enter and attempt to shoot it, but end up getting snagged in it anyway. This was a nicer change, and still keep her balanced. (It’s only one less bullet)
---
Just grind thunt as boring as it can be until you’re comfortable enough to start playing games.
---
That for sure is the one positive ill give IQ anyday. Maybe I dont play against very smart valks, cause even though im not IQ I can almost always spot cameras. (Im like the designated camera guy on my team, for whatever reason) but SOMETIMES I cant spot it and IQ is pretty useful THEN. Otherwise IQ cant do anything for me I cant do a few seconds slower.

Funny you say that because Pro League told them not to take the Nades away and they did it anyway. Goes to show they don’t just listen to pro league.
---
Why cover wins and loses?
---
You Know claymores were also removed because it allowed attackers to move around in the drone phase right? That allowed hackers to spawn in, move around with a claymore, vault, teleport to the obj and kill everyone before the round even starts... It's not just iq everyone with a claymore could do it.
---
neither is twitch. she has two drones that trade destroying gadgets on 5 charges for literally not jumping. she just so happens to have the 3rd best AR in the game..
---
YOU HIT HIS HELMET
---
Dont say you werent lagging if you wont show the whole screen
---
#87
---
That drop shot on #4
---
Heres the problem: ANY OP can do that. Maybe not as fast as IQ but I still dont see why that occasional boost is worth not taking a better op over her.
---
outperforms every AR that isn't Fuze's, you mean?
---
Best comment I could have hoped for.
---
nvm the TK ... that's a nice spot for cams dude
---
This was done with a laser cutter right? I got my science teacher last year to do one of Sledge. Let's just say it didn't end well.
---
So other people dont be toxic for my wins/losses
---
Maybe it’s because you play on Xbox
---
You can clearly see if I was lagging the person grappled on the building would’ve been lagging on my screen too.
---
INCOMING COMMENTS about how you still lagged, point of the acog wasnt on the head, bucks recoil is ass,or how you're just ass
---
Just saying, based on other comments here. This seems to be a low IQ post.......... I'll see myself out.
---
Typical troll banking on a mis-said word. Im sure you feel victorious now. Its not like you didnt know what I was talking about. Stop feeling big.
---
You understand that the end goal of balancing is to make EVERYTHING as meta as possible.... Ubisoft is attempting to raise the pickrate of all the operators in the long run... The goal is to keep the trend up so that one day Tachanka might actually BE meta, but your argument seems to just want to toss him to the hounds, which defeats any common sense ideology of balancing..............
---
No, people cannot clearly see.

If you look were I'm aiming it was a head shot, but head shots are broken

And yet ive never had any problem doing all that as any other op.
---
Thanks man

*thunk thunk thunk thunk thunk*

I have a pc account but i dont have a pc lmao. Still not giving it for free
---
Ahh yes.. 2019 memes where people barely even try
---
it's just facts, girls don't care that we're good at video games
---
Curb your Rainbow 6
---
Well it’s not random, there’s a 1/50 chance you get it.  There’s concrete odds
---
Who the hell would give some random ass person their account.
---
No dude rank is copper-diamond you said 166 that would be clearance level
---
right, because every keyboard warrior is an expert in balancing.....
---
Where can I get my free 600 r6 credits then since I had this game since December of 2014?
---
Convenient zoom in which cuts out where the symbols show when you’re lagging, the zoom was probably unnecessary
---
Well you cut off the clip so you cant really tell
---
*heavy breathing*

Im gold, idk why assuming im bronze means i cant have an opinion or something anyway. And I could care less if IQ counter my mains? Who cares? I adore challenge and counters, IQ does nothing against me or when I play as her. I can do anything she can do just fine as any other op, ive yet to have a problem.

Perfection in numerical form.
---
AHHHH
---
👌
---
I only ever saw reports that it was an IQ problem so.

Sexy

idk why people cry about bugs, then immediately after the offending item is removed people complain about it being gone. It's like an abusive relationship
---
I didn’t realize you had a reddit account, huh
---
Thanks brother

This guy also has a laser sight equipped, which reduces spread on shotguns and tightens the reticle
---
I have another app that I usually use for stats but I’m gonna switch to urs to show some support Chief 😎
---
Ooh fuck
---
Big. Deal. You knew I meant clearance level. My bad siege is the one game with a proprietary name for "level" it dosent matter.
---
This is some big dick energy right here
---
I have mixed feelings of anger and fear
---
Uh, nah man. It's because of your laser sight
---
P good, i like it
---
Shotguns would be entirely useless if they were any less precise than it is today on PC
---
The guns on console and PC are both different in a lot of ways to compensate for the fact that you can't aim as well on console compared to PC
---
One example is a reduction in vertical recoil on console compared to PC since it's harder to recoil control precisely
---
THEY'VE EVOLVED
---
You don’t know what you got till it’s gone lol
---
I did not know that laser sights do this. I’m pretty sure they don’t on console.
---
Not the outbreak Ash
