That isn't a reason for a rework it would make the community furious to take a fine map and make it different
---
---
---
I'd recommend Rook. He's a very easy Op to use and he's one of the few Ops in the game that has an ACOG.
---
HARD SCOPE
---
Why are there so many people downloading your obvious joke
---
Pretty large titties
---
Thanks for bringing this up, didn't realize that. Maybe they don't deserve an upvote.
---
You try turning it on and off?
---
Everybody with Hereford
---
Yeah, i think this was made by the Rainbow Six Universe team, a team made by Ubisoft dedicated to making story related content for the operators. They made the Hammer and the Scalpel video. I'm excited to see what else they come up with!
---
They didnt say story mode. They said year 5 will have an overarching story that will be told over the different seasons.
---

---
Its lore. Thats it.
---
MOST LIKELY FAKE/ REPOST! ACCOUNT VERY NEW!
---
Yea he did the same thing last go, and he complained about not being revived

1. Ping abuse hasn’t been a thing in siege in a long time. They’re at a disadvantage because their actions do not register as fast as yours. People just look to ping abuse as an excuse. They’re likely just a lot better and playing out of their rank bc of the different regional ranks as you mentioned.

2. I agree that MnK is a problem, but it’s not really unbeatable. I play at diamond elo and most of the players that are MnK are blantantly obvious but not that great. It’s honestly more of a frustration than anything, but I’ve found that if you don’t let it get in your head or don’t let it bother you that they’re MnK, you can compete with them. Once again, people typically looking for an excuse. I seem do to just fine on a controller against them, as do most of my squad. 
---
3. As a high plat-diamond player, I regularly get matched with low level/new players when I play casual just because I don’t play casual all that often. There’s not much I can do about that besides play a ton of casual to raise my casual mmr, which I’m not going to do.
---
I loved Grim Sky man. But I started playing that season and didn’t think they disappeared. :( I want the Police one so bad
---
WE NEED THIS SKIN PLS PLS MOMMY
---
Depends on your gameplay. If you want to be more supportive even after you die I'd say Lesion or Kapkan. If you want to roam more I'd say Alibi.
---
Valk is an amazing operator (no bias totally). She’s got team play with her gadgets and access to c4 really helps out. My only gripe is the mpx. The thinks a laser but it’s body-shot damage is kinda low.
---
As for Glaz I have a buff idea...
---
Completely change him and do this...

Sexual urges is human nature, going to commit a mass murder is not.
---
There is no excuse to view childporn and lolis are children or child like characters making them feed into pedophiles fantasies. They dont prevent pedophiles from acting on their urges just like watching someone smoke a cigarette will not give someone who is trying to quit their fix, it will only push them until they preform the satisfying act.
---
 Almost in everyplace they're shown they're sexualized. There are cases where lolis arent but anime like bakemonogatari and so much of the hentai and doujin out there depict young girls(as young as 3 I've seen) or "women"(shinobu a 7000 year old demon loli) with a legit childs body being flirty and innocent yet sexy. This totally plays into these pedophiles sick preference and even sometimes encouraging it. Some of the hentais go as far as to show people the best way to snatch children from parks and stuff. Watching it and seeing it will eventually continue to push them until they cant take it anymore and have to try it for themselves. Sexual urges are way stronger and common since almost everyone has them, its human nature. Not everyone wants to kill so comparing violence with sexual urges makes no sense.
---
So my only problem is that you are going to bring back the smoke plant meta, glaze will overpower warden because warden won't be expecting it.
---
Noted thanks man !
---
it depends on your play style. do you like to roam or do you like to anchor? P.S. Are you saying that you only have valk or are you saying you have year 1 ops and valk? im kinda big dumb dumb and cant read so plz clarify XD
---
You mean mmr
---
Bruh downvoted for a joke R.I.P
---
See, he gets it.
---
Alibi has great guns and is 3 speed. Her secondary is sick and if you use her holos right her ability is great. Good luck playing man enjoy.
---
No it would break on the first use and you would have to buy a new one
---
Dio is my daddy, so, yea JoJo is alright I guess

---
I would say about the size of a hatch.
---
If you like ops like Valk, Maestro, Echo, and Mozzie would be my picks. Maestro and Echo are a bit harder because they’re 1 speeds, but Mozzie is a 2 speed, his primary is better, he has a secondary shotgun for utility, and his gadget can act as intel denial, similarly to mute. I’d pick him up next, but he’s a bit more expensive. Totally worth it imo.
---
Better than what I can do
---
I’m pretty sure only it’s recoil got nerfed not the damage or spread. Correct me if I’m wrong
---
Of fucking course you main dokk
---
I bet you use the skorpion Evo. Cringe
---
Any guess at the two in the corner left of wamai? I think it's pulse and doc
---
I like the idea of giving warden smokes but idk If replacing fuze with cluster smokes would be good. I feel like it would change his whole character too much. 
---
But a warden with 1-2 smokes I think would make way for some clutches and good flanks.
---
Her hetting gunned down because she isn't recruit and is using the f0-12
---
A few year 1’s and valk but I’m a roamer for sure
---
Thanks dude !

Wow, more anime, because there definetly wasnt enough on this sub
---

---
I've carried super hard and been carried super hard. Just be as consistent as possible and you're good.

Okay thanks
---
That’s unlucky
---
But I mean 4-5 shots from a shot gun from like 15 feet away is bullshit.

got hate mail for saying not to reinforce kids room, we lost kids room.

What can I say: I love games that are punishing but also rewarding.

You mean Leroy Smith? I’m psyched too man. Harada and the Namco team are really going so hard for Tekken fans, and developers all over need to take notes.

Wait, what? What alert are you referring to? I missed your point.

That is true, yes.

There’s 2 Kung Fu fighters (not counting Ling and Law) already though and a 3rd  on the way lol. 
---
Didn’t know that about Ying though. That’s pretty cool.

It’s something I called a downvote bias, usually it’s with emoji‘s or some other joke I remember seeing something of a comment where someone used an emoji and everyone was like emoji bad and they all downloaded him and then there was the exact same comment except heavily about it, people are going to download just for the sake of downloading and then everyone keeps bandwagoning
---
Loli is a body type, and she doesn't really look young as it's just a manga/anime artstyle.

UwU vigil-San you’ve made a sewious fucky wucky

Ok then, believe as you please.
---
Man, Gridlock should be doing these exercises
---
He isn't in pro play yet, unless you personally get invited get to watch current pro teams scrimming we don't know what he is going to do at that level, most pros I've head say he is going to be crazy.
---
&gt; Impact his team negatively if used incorrectly
---
Yeah, that's what pro teams will really run into
---
&gt; Not used the same reason fuze is
---
For being a 1 speed attacker with not enough utility to be viable? That's a weird comparison. 
---
He has 3 shields with those crazy slits which can act as more stationary smoke canisters and deny areas for a long amount of time. Yes attack can get rid of his utility but that will often cost attackers their utility that they already desperately need for Maestro cams etc. 
---
So he can deny areas for a long amount of time and when that's over he can C4 the plant. 
---
I mean, I'm not saying he is overpowered, just that he has a lot of potential at that level of play
---
Nope
---
When bodies stopped bouncing in Halo when you dropped your Spartan sack all over them. It’s hollow now.
---
Sadly, no.
---
Because I uninstalled siege 3 days ago, and it's gonna be a month before I reinstall it.
---
I got almost the exact same clip except they were shooting at me
---
Based on ur comments, i feel u havent played enough to make it hard to make a dent on ur stats. Itll average out eventually.
---
This is actually wrong, on 2 speed operators it will now require only 3 shots to kill compared to the 4 it needed with the 36 of damage, so it's a bit more comparable to the UMP45 now.
---
By the community at silver and below, yes. Gold and above, I do see cap Bans. So I don't think he's underrated there.
---
uh... doesn't explain why he's drawn her face like a prepubescent child
---
Lmao
---
Fuck off with this stupid ass Ela nerf.  Even the reasoning sounds like a full of shit.  As if the nerfing characters based on pick rate wasn't dumb enough already.  I don't I see any of the nonsense they're talking about and im on console.
---
Yes you will!, Just keep playing and dont give up, nobody begin the game knowing everything, u Just gotta keep trying!
---
Yeah.
---
Still confused, but can't check the game for a while now.
---
Idk maybe just more disciplined or something
---
His bio says something along the lines of his body needing less oxygen. He might produce less lactic acid.
---
Ok
---
Mediocre guns, useless ability (especially as I believe she won't even be able to actively counter jackal's pings in Shifting tides, not 100% on that).
---
She is strong in lower ranked play sure, as she depends on mistakes on the enemy's part but an overpowered op? Nah.
---
This is solid.
---
Amazing!
---

It’s just one of those things. Being a solo player it can be difficult to be able to use Mira properly until you reach a certain rank. All you can do on your end is learn the best Mira setups for the site/map you’re playing on. You can’t control the shitty actions of others unfortunately. Don’t give up, continue to use Mira if you like using her. Use youtube videos as a study guide of sorts to learn how she works best on certain sites. Also find a group of chill people who won’t teamkill you. I’m on xbox east coast some weeknights, message me your gamertag.
---
Yo Gambit! Thank you! Appreciate the respectful feedback!
---
And yeah, I was trying to spoof a Marley edit but I didn’t do a good job explaining that. I was going to add a clip or something that said “watches one Marley video”. Then Cue the Marley bit.
---
Thanks Vaccination!
---
I refuse to support the game till they add cross saves. Why should I spend money on a game if I just loss everything when I switch platforms? It's just greed and I hate it.
---
Amy Sxhumer is F tier
---
Fucking hell im blind my bad but there would probs be a shit ton of spawn peeks as jäger and bandit have acog
---
F in the chat.
---
Won’t lie, definitely a huge Marley fan and the video editing is influenced by it!
---
As an addition, since I don’t know if any patch notes where it specifically said this, but I do have this:
---
3 years ago, when cav first came out, MacieJay came out with a video called [The Caveira Special](https://youtu.be/2YHf2hdL-fA) . In this video, it is clear as day what pre-patch interrogations were like, and nowadays, well, you know...
---
Thanks Alter!
---
Hey man I play on xbox and pc so if you want to hit me up sometime we can play my gamertag GhostRecon1706
---
must have miss typed it again * Worst
---
I don't know
---
Question: How do you not roam with Cav?
---
Lurk or spam her shotgun
---
Adding that bit would've been great! I get that you're new to YouTube but damn it's close to perfection.
---
If I didn't know any better I'd think this was a tuxbird or TheDoo video
---
I want a mode where everyone on attack and defense is ash with an R4c. I think it would interesting.
---
oh. that was anti-climactic.
---
I'm literally about to make the move please stop it hurts
---
tbh it gets boring to anchor as her
---
So defensive. Is there something on your mind you wish to tell?
---
Thats because of you, id say just play on a low level account (smurf) and dont go sweat. Thats what I do with my friends im plat 2, and I know it sucks im complaining about playing against plats and diamond kbms but its made all my friends uninstall the game since they are new
---
Was that a ace I couldn’t count
---
Remove all friendly fire from casual.
---
No
---
I think a big reason surely must be the actual platforms, Xbox and Playstation, not wanting you to move, thus wouldnt want this feature to incentivise moving to PC. they get a little cut of your purchases and they want as much as they can get
---
Alright man. Rocketlock27. Thanks for the invite

People were saying that she looked 13 in the drawing. And you were the one that said I was “horny and angry about it”. And also back to the original point how is this not sexualized? Her ass and tits are basically the main features of the drawing.
---
Let’s all stop with the nostalgia,
---
They will never bring back the old siege, it had A LOT of issues and we had many change for the better.
---
How come that when ever I see video of ppl using the red doot the dot is super small but in game its huge as fuck?
---
Leave them rare, we seen what happened with “skull ranger” or whatever Fortnite did with their skin decisions
---
Boo sang ching kwa ha lung
---
You click that thing that says Recover Password
---
You should stop maining mira because having mains is dumb in games like siege. You should instead be able to play most if not all ops so you can pick the op that suits the map/site/team comp
---
honestly it's not rare anymore lol
---
She looks great for a 40y/o
---
It's because you didn't switch it to wumbo
---
Bruh cowboy bepop is a good show and all but anime ain’t culture. That’s like calling family guy and all the shows like that culture.

Then why didn’t you? Why’d you put it in moon runes as the other guy so politely put it?
---
I'm 15 so we cool
---
Smooth.
---
Probably shadow play. I can surprisingly get 4k60fps with only about a 3% drop in frames.
---
I understand that it's hard to determine the team's contribution, but it is true that some players are not in the rank.  So I think mvp needs more points, and the worst players need to take measures such as reducing points more than other players.
---
I think a lot of people would rather useless shields rather than op shields like they have been for the last 3.5 to 4 years
---
Okay. Should we care?
---
Kinda is, but it's less impressive than it used to be. The OG black ice is the coolest skin in the game but you cant get it anymore so everyone is out of luck
---
GOT HIM!!
---
they need to recycle the all the AK vairents. They are severely underused.
---
He played the "no u" card, but intellectually.
---
She kinda looks like she’s gonna cry
---
Just ban him like every other gold shitter lmao
---
Ino it's instant down but I only just realised she left hooks the attackers and if they leave as soon as you down them it's an instant interro found that out the other day aswell
---
For those that maybe don't know, valk is based on a real female solider. They even took her posing and gave it to valk.

I could care less if he gets banned or not, I just remembered I had this saved so I thought I posted it, plus I mean all you need to do to counter him is just to chuck a nitro cell
---
That's glacier.
---
They would have to completely rework how points work then to focus on obj plays than simply kills. People would point whore rather than just play the game. Leading to even more toxicity for “stealing points”.
---
No official word yet.

---
This sub needs an IQ test as a basic requirement.
---
If only.
---
Thank you, I worked hard thinking of this
---
But why? They will still need to pick a gun with the stats they want, then create the model, do all the animation and sound of the gun. It’s as much work as a new weapon.
---
Honestly I don’t care about them, we already have nearly a 100 weapons, we don’t need more.
---
Omg it worked

---
Only good part of new Hereford
---
Upvote for the potato joke tho
---
How much time am I looking at for each op? And how much does each op cost (in real money)? Wondering if it's worth the grind
---
I’m not saying you’re wrong but do you have anywhere where this is stated?  I just recall shooting lots of arms of people peaking and feeling like it did like toe level damage
---
Motorcycle looks amazing
---
Wamai just chilling while valk is dying hahaha
---
I just switched to PC and I don't have a SSD yet. Every game it takes about a minute for the game to load. I'm getting one soon, but nobody has been able to tell that its me yet.

It is a shitty joke, people keep making it though, it’s like Jager ACOG and lord tachanka, stopped being funny a while ago

---
Probably on who's going to win the endurance test Wamai vs Valk
---
Well, valk looks like she’s dying
---
Eh too each his own my friend. I play this game each season to mess with NEW gadgets and NEW guns. Like I get what your saying but for me as a player it seems extremely LAZY and kinda bullshit for Ubisoft to be tossing around Fake ass excuses to like Licencing when they clear have gotten around that issue in the past. Those whole reused weapons just seems like a cop out so they can focus on adding more paid for features I.E. the battle pass and events.
---
Is he a real person
---
Of course the Kenyan is good at running.
---
Personally I went for the ultimate edition because I'm the kind of person who like having everything unlocked, and just been able to play what I like, but if you like grinding really any is worth it. 
---
I think the better question to ask yourself is, grind for the operators, or been able to play any at a whim, more important to you/more fun to you
---
It depends on how new the op is every season some op price (in renown) go down. For me i i spend about 6-7 hour in one day with a lot of wins you could get about 12-15 thousand renown
---
[patch 5.0](fandom.com/wiki/Rainbow_Six_Siege_patches/Patch_5.0) is when it was changed, 3 years ago
---
Noone going to mention Thatcher repping the Union Jack shirt on? I think that's the right name for it, sorry I'm a Bald Eagle, Hamburger Stuffer, Health Care paying, Freedom Having, American. Idk any other flags but ours. ;)
---
And how many thousand renown is an op when it releases?
---
Just has a bag of ammo hanging on her aide
---
20-25 thousand
---
Good point. I'm more wondering is the grind really worth it or would I be saving myself so much time that it's worth the price for ultimate.
---
DLC operators gets discounted according to the year/season they were released on. 
---
Newer operators are 25000 renown. These can be reduced down to 10000 renown. For example the year one operators are mostly 10000 renown now. 
---
Generally its 1k renown per hour if you play normally, and thats without adding in the weekly and daily challenges which gives around 250 renown. 
---
Credit wise, iirc its around $5 per operator. (25000Renown) not sure about how the discounted pricing affects the credit pricing.
---
Jager is literally already the strongest operator in the entire game on defense, why in the world would you give him an ACOG to make him even better.
---
I mean gadget over lap was pretty obvious there’s only so much they can do for gadgets. I remember when they showed the guns for nokk and warden, yes I was disappointed yes I was mad but at the end of the day guns doesn’t really matter, I prefer having a good gadget than a gun that would have the exact same stats as an other but have a different model. All those paid features are entirely optional tho so if you don’t like it you are not forced to buy it.
---
If it’s 3rd party then is very likely not

---
Why was this man downvoted?
---
It will be removed from the store at the end of dec?
---
he had a better gamer chair than me
---
i want mini episodes (video series) or single player/co-op missions with cutscenes for each operator (maybe a past experience before they joined rainbow or something else like thatcher got) but in episodes and they release them in batch and boom we got more lore :D hbi did say they want more story next year
---
Why do you not try and get a lfg?
---
Just-
---
The insugency games are fun and tactical like
---
That’s just bad luck and more of Capitaos fault than it is yours
---
Lol thanks!
---
maybe try play unranked or casual and get good LMAO. Make friends
---
I dont have set times I can play. Trying to find a group that can be ready to play at the random times I can play is never going to work.
---
A simple solution to a complex problem
---
Wamai look like robot wtf
---
I hope to god people stop banning jackal, and the other same ops next season. It’s infuriating tbh considering how many more options there are.
---
But the recoil... https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e0evi1/super_shorty_recoil_nerf/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Yeah tried that. Getting put into games against diamonds and plats is no way to get good. Casual is the most cancer mode in the game currently.
---
yeah because the year 5 pass pre-order will come out
---
I will definitely check them out. Thank you.
---
yo, WHAT IS THIS MEAN ITS NOT THE BEST.
---
LOOK HOW MUCH EFFORT YOU PUTTT!
---
Looks like I'd just wait for the winter sale. Thanks man!

Consept

I looked it up and piranhas are only native to South America and some small areas in Asia. Since Wamai is from Kenya, I doubt these are piranhas. They still could be some sort of predatory fish, though.

That's what an lfg is. Discord has plenty of people that are on.

I’ve always done Lone Wolf/ Squad Only T-Hunts, matchmaking T-Hunt has always been bad.
---
Pretty old and not that useful because of the long time it takes to move around but still not bad.
---
The only time I tried that I sat for 20 minutes with noone wanting to play with a bronze rank. Like I said I dont get a lot of time to play so waiting half an hour just to get started means I might get to play a single match.
---
that aint no murder hole, thats a murder tunnle

Stay out of casual homie if you don’t wanna play ranked play unranked they can’t kick you
---
And now you see what I'm talking about people just reinforce there so whenever I need to defend this room I have to pick castle to at least cover up some of the windows
---
Oh yes, i didn't remember. Can you even buy it after that?

yeah just know the year 5 pass is for..well next year stuff. where this year 4 is for all the year 4 ops right now
---
Please, Ubisoft gods, we just want a different meta besides "ban jackal, hold peak, cry in comms." :v
---
Now that makes more sense
---
Other guy said it wont be on sale anymore after dec
---
Actually playing against and with high skilled players is exactly how you get better. I started playing in the alpha and was shit for a few seasons. I was probably around silver or so. Then I slowly got better, got stuck in gold. Now I'm solo queuing to high plat 1 so far. You just gotta stick with it dude.

Will do!

Always someone from my team comes out early in the game XC

The shotgun barrell could be a bit longer, but that's awesome anyway!

Uno reverse card activated

Ban people who are constantly reported for trolling. CS:Go does it. Why can't Ubisoft? Why can someone load stall a game for hours causing 9 other people to not be able to play at all the entire time? Why haven't they fixed that? It's been years.
---
I usually use mute, op in those cases
---
That is actually really good 👏👏👏
---
What do you mean not the best this is great
---
Thank u!
---
:(
---
Thank u :)
---
Im just gonna put this suggestion here #*NokkLmg
---
They do that anyway. Why do you think you keep seeing "....banned for toxic behavior"? It's cause Ubi is actually listening. They even send confirmation emails.
---
But there are A LOT of players in bronze, and most are just bad at the game. You are losing not just because of idiots, but because of bad players as well. Your only solution is to **get a team** to play **a team game demanding communication**.
---
I don't see it to be a problem unless one has anxiety issues, which aren't hard to overcome and I can speak from experience.
---
Yes

Its okay game

I always love when spawncamping with him works...

I mean I don’t mind spawnpeeking that much but when you have one guy doing it all game long it’s annoying

What is that skin top left of the Elephant skin?

I have very very very very rarely seen that. I see battle eye bans and that's it. Load stalling is still rampant. Leavers and afks are still rampant.

Bandit over there in his thoughts

that's why she is banned from running competitions
---
Lesions gun starts at 31. I may have missed the first one, sure. Maybe even the second. That's 29 in a mag. 2 more bullets were for sure fired and should have dealt something. This isn't a one time experience either.
---
This has been happening the last three days. And not just for me. My squad mates are noticing it.
---
That's amazing
---
Fair
---
Damn looks like Warden is still trash
---
I loved the Claymore rank upgrade xD
---
it has an extended barrel and low recoil so you don't need to worry about a barrel attachment
---
then dont respond lol
---
I mean just don't get spawnpeeked. It's not hard
---
That would be balanced in my opinion
---
I wish I could draw like you
---
I think just maybe possibly that could maybe possibly be a bug but not sure
---
The thing is, it’s not hard. But it’s irritating af.
---
Thx
---
Ah
---
Everyone
---
Thx man
---
You want a flair because you're afraid what people will think of you? You're stronger than that
---
People have been posting loli in this sub? Wtf why. At least this post isn't loli.
---
No, they aren’t countering any rappels they are countering your spawning. And that’s what I call toxic. Robbing someone of their right to play a round as attacker.
---
Weird, this is the only time I've seen an anime pic at the front. But let me guess, all the millions of other cartoon styled (but not anime) pictures you have no issue with right? Is this some sort of culture bias against Japan?
---
Kapkan is fun, not sure how good he is in competitive. Legion and Mozzie seem like strong picks tho
---
Are the servers down or someting?
---
I drone relatively much but I don’t want to spend half the round droning, that’s not how the game is “supposed to be played”

No the servers suck

I do think that the crux of this issue lies within a fundamental disagreement over how Siege is meant to be played. Personally I think the onus is on the attacker to determine what rat strategies the defenders are throwing at you, whether that be spawnpeeking, picking an offsite, hard roaming etc.... It's on you to work that out. It's also entirely up to you whether you want to face check everything or just spend the 10 seconds checking it first.
---
I know how to avoid spawn peeks. Bank is easy to counter spawn peeks on.
---

---
My personal main is Mozzie in defence. If you play him good, he is fooking strong. His load out with a nitro cell makes him good. His gadget can be used to get informations and to prevent the enemy's information. Try him out
---
I mean neither of you are wrong
---

---
it’s worth selling but I don’t think it will get over £25 or 30$ because someone can just buy the game and all the operators (including wamai ,kali ,clash and finka) for around £35 and get the season pass benefits
---
1:1 is your Width &amp; Length being the same resolution. So 1080p is normally 1920x1080p. Well 1:1 would be 1080x1080, or 720x720, or etc.
---
It’s a perfectly square resolution, stretched to full-screen. It’s roughly twice as stretched as 4:3 is (from what I can see).
---
Well including the dlc's that i have i'd say around 50-60 usd
---
I wonder what the devs feel like. They made this game to be this tactical shooter where you go around cleaning rooms methodically using gadgets but instead it has turned to this "ENEMY DETECTED OUTSIDE-- *BAM BAM RUN SHOOT 1 TAP EZ EZ EZ GET FUCKED*"-fest
---
Easy to say but one thing a spawn peeker has over the spawner is timing, you can literally just choose any random time to peek and even catch someone who was clearing angles off guard.
---
'not the best'

---
not the best? that's fucking awesome give yourself some credit please
---
The thing about spawnpeeking is they're generally focused on 1 or 2 exits, if you do something out of the ordinary it's usually an easy kill.

Fairly sure they've mentioned trying to come up with ways to prevent it, but so far haven't managed to come out with a workable solution.
---
Do they know what push to talk is?
---
ok ill try that thanks
---
I mean, I couldn't tell you, I like it currently. 
---
However, I see a lot of complaining on the sub that her gun is unusable and I get downvoted anytime I defend it.
---
1) yes, there's delay of milliseconds, go on plane and do a long shot with a pistol, you'll understand.

2) yeah, it shots from the sight because it's how it's meant to be used.

3) ping still ruin this.

Your entire post is just simping to Ubi.

"Baawwww poor small indie studio Ubisoft can't afford to buy new guns baaawwww".
---
If that is so then WHY THE HELL THEY HAVE SO MANY GUNS IN BREAKPOINT?
---
Maybe it's because they were hoping that Breakpoint would be their new cash cow and to make it better they literally transferred almost 50% of Siege's team to it?
---
Male Twitch

they have rook chibi figurine use that as a condom
---
But isn't it getting removed next season from the playlist?
---
Lol pussies. Dont run out and take your time. Problem solved. Theres no penalty for spawnpeeking so its LITERALLY up to you if you encounter it. Play smart and dont run out in the open and you wont get spawn peeked. Stick to cover and you'll be good.
---
but the mp5 has zero recoil

Tbh his hobby is probably just pranking people

soon they will be dead, just like this meme

I like this so I left an upvote. Good job OP.
---
Yeah people who complain about spawnpeeks are the people who just run out of their spawns like it's cod and then cry because they're trash.
---
Ubisoft knows about it for years and they can't ban peoples for macros. Actually, it's probably a good thing they're doing nothing, the last time they took actions, they punished everybody by making the solo t-hunt stuck to 36 renown if you succeed it.
---
I pity the players who want just to get renown in order to unlock operators.
---
True but it still should be worked on, I always put her in spots to get shot but I feel it would be much more effective when I take her place as they look away when we look identical

This would be way cooler if you were on attack

Or just be quiet if you don't know exact calliut. I do t Wana hear he's over INNNNN THERE TO YOUR LEFT U Idiot. I want to listen to shit
---
So lesion, but it actually marks like Jackal?
---
Yes, they have alot of these things to make smokes worse, which just makes Warden even more useless.  He can deal with smokes, but not nearly as well as the people you had mentioned, as he has to stand completely still to see through it. If they have a Glaz, it's just a battle of who can stand still faster, which if Glaz had thrown them, he's probably already in position. Giving Warden smokes could possibly make him viable, as OP mentioned lategame he could block off certain areas of the map, making attackers blindly rush through, which means they'd die. Or they'd be funneled through the other entrance to the point, and if Warden knows they're coming, they'd probably die. 
---
Chances are, this would make Warden a good operator for the first time since release. I don't see why you're fighting against the idea of this.
---
Because you get either EED or Nanobots assist
---
Pretty good, good AR, help a lot the team, yes he already have Jäger but Wamai will let you put the ADSs in another need place, leting Wamai put the Mag-NET in the "old" one, may not be so efficient as that ADS that was there, but at least will take out enemy utility and you can maybe use it agains't the attackers that throw it in there the flashbang, frags,etc.
---
I just don’t understand why it takes so long to get marked when you run out. On maps like skyscraper you can easily run out, and get a couple of kills before you’ve been marked. I’m fine with the concept of run outs in general, but it should be riskier than it currently is.
---
yeah, but it doesn't do damage
---
Its amazing gj
---
Then where is the problem? Ez kills for you, right?
---
Don’t worry about it mate it happens. Sometimes I’ll have 3 games in a row where I struggle to get a kill or two. Then next game I’ll drop like 12. It’s not just about who you’re against, it’s also about who your team are too. Sometimes I’ll join a team that are so good and fast they’ll win the round before I even get in the building properly. 
---
Also confidence is key. If you start thinking oh well they’re better than me you’ll get bogged down or over think things.
---
I'm thinking you have multiple, but it doesn't seal damage, and maybe? the defender wont know they've been hit. maybe like a tripwire
---
No self promotion
---
16 year old virgins who play this game:

Girls? *REEEEEEEEEEE*
---
I figured they'd just make it so defender gadgets can still be thrown at the start of the round but if you have a gun out it keeps the red barrier up for 20 seconds after a round starts.
---
just another generic siege yt

look at those bullets, it might break through the walls. this will game-changer for him, but seems would not handle with a tiny step like shock-drone.

Why the hell do people still do that like it works 🤦‍♂️

That is what I said replying to him in one of the latest replies?

Wamai is Kenyan, so there's no beating him in running.

If your teammate left first round then how does the enemy team have 24 kills and between the four of you you only have you only have 19 deaths?
---
Thatcher is in the back wearing the Olympic uniform that was teased in the Japan majors

BTW who won

A truth we had to accept

It's like 4 nitros per map, something hint totally understandable even in a multiplayer game and you're afraid of that sound? Damn man, watch out when you call someone silver.
---
Do you need a website?
---
Acog is free lmao
---
We should team up and do something like this sometime, amazing.
---
tbh spawnpeeks feel like something ubi can't deal with. tactical jump outs later in the round are one thing, but the way some rounds start is an utter shitshow, and basically a toss up for who comes out on top.
---
STFU its not even OP it’s dumb to nerf it
---
that guys gets muted in the first minute. i'd rather lose than listen to someone take out their personality disorder on the team

Faxxx

Like bank alley whereif you don't have a SSD the load times ensure you can't do anything but die.

Somebody just died to  aJager main

As I understand, Kapkan EED's do varying damage dependent on the OPs armour rating.
---
1 Armour: 60HP damage
---
2 Armour: 50HP damage
---
3 Armour: 40HP damage
---
Yeah but is new players are playing vs new players they shouldn't be able to spawnpeek like a pro. Until they are smurfing, which is a problem itself
---
Consider R6 uses a modified assassin's Creed engine the excuse is valid

Ah yep I think you’re right. I play a lot of 2 armour attackers and I forgot I’d read that on here before.

Well Valk was (almost) an Olympic breaststroker and 200m is an event in the Olympics (and it is considered a sprint)
---
it's been there since E3 reveal
---
Bruh
---
Lol no. I just see the writing on the wall. The operator is constantly picked and let's be honest, because he has one of the best guns in the game. With Wamai coming out next season, it's just likely he will get a nerf to his primary weapon.
---
No he won’t he’s perfectly balanced
---
moral victory
---
It will happen. It happened to Ela when she had a really strong primary. It will happen to Jager.
---
I'm surprised nobody has actually provided the official Ubisoft answer. 
---
They have (to my knowledge) stated that they aren't able to do it (at least, at the moment) due to technical limitations. 
---
Take from this what you want, it could mean that we need a new game engine in order for it to happen, something that most people want for this game anyway. 
---
I assume that's why the elite animations don't work with other uniforms.
---
Explain???
---
So then you wouldn't mind his gun getting nerfed right? Checkmate
---
That tachanka one from your shop is sexy af
---
Yeah i do that too if i need to
---
It's not really rock paper scissors, some things do not have an effective counter and some are so situational that the game itself is basically the counter. Many things have the same counter but it also needs to be applied.
---
For example IQ and Thatcher are a hard counter to all deffers that use electronics which are a lot but many times they can't do anything about it because of distractions or other obstacles.
---
The map filtering only works for thunt missions. The best way to learn is either just play casual until yo feel comfortable with the maps or launch a custom game and go through each map getting a feel for the layout of each.
---
Doing as Mira says
---
I'm gonna be real with you all, the only time I use game chat is to try and be friends with a random teammate and then just stick with them the whole match
---
Because it's fucking awful
---
Well, the best way is to do a couple of T-hunts until you know it. Or you can just play and eventually you will learn them.
---
If you don't want to take time to properly learn maps in custom game...group up with people and play whatever the playlist you want, implying that these people will tell you everything on the go - from objectives that rotate in meta, rotations and lines of sights that are made and which walls and corridors to reinforce and where are killzones and chokepoints created
---
Montagne elite?
---
What skin is that?
---
It's an unfun and unbalanced map.
---
Bartlett has only one door entrance and every single window (there are lots of them) can be a spawn peek, it's an unbalanced larger version of consulate basically.
---
Dear lord forgive me for what im about to do...

It's a video game. Not meant to be hyper-realistic.

---
well, according to the lore, the scenarios we go through in Siege are simulated scenarios made for training of Rainbow operators
---
Lol I wouldn't really care, but I also don't see why it needs a nerf.
---
This happens to me all of the time as well.  I can never play untangled anymore.
---
He may use it on other toxic people....
---
Sheesh Cav I know how you feel about Nokk but going to Bandit for drugs isn't the answer.
---
That’s so cool!
---
Not on console lmao
---
Any new map is always going to be heavily defender sided when it is released as attackers do not yet know various elements and options the map offers for attacking. By know, each site has a very standard style of taking for attackers, but the longer a map is around and the more time players spend with it, the less defender sided it will become. This happens will all maps.
---
Kanal is barely a season old yet. It is a vast improvement on the original. It significantly reduces the tight and close quarter nature the original had and improves on a lot of issues both sides had.
---
I will admit, there are elements I do not like and will say it is not one of my favourite maps, but I feel that it's a huge step up from the original and with time and patience, it will become less defender sided.
---
Why wouldyou nerf something balanced?
---
Droppers... You mean hatches. Its important to know the words in english for better communication.
---
That soundtrack was solo cool
---
I know i want to start playing on pc but I’ve gotten so much stuff I am still debating it
---
Because there are people to help injured people (as speaker lady jels) and if terrorist would try to board it police would be forced to shoot him
---
Although all operators are have unique abilities/gadgets, the diversity of their role and behaviour is not as big as in overwatch where you have categories like "Tank/Healer/DPS". In siege, all operators have same health points, hitboxes and they all carry weapons that instantly kill with headshots. The beauty of siege is that the game relies a lot on communication, coordination and intel gathering. In Overwatch, you have teamfights where entire teams engage in one big combat which decides the outcome of the round/push/objective. In siege you will have close quarter combat where certain players will engage in combat, while others will support them in a way (droning, stunning, cutting rotation etc).
---
It's up to you and your team to decide, are you going to rely on gadgets/abilities more, or stick to the classic shooter approach of outgunning your opponents
---
There is more than 1000 mmr between diamond and sliver so it isn't possible
---
When silenced pistol gets nerfed
---
looks like she's part of the resistance lmao
---
Lmao, idk what you expect when you play a video game but the point of it is to be fun not to be hyper realistic. If it was the way you want it to be, it would 1 be less fun and 2 not exactly possible considering the AI in siege
---
If you’re running a stack and you guys are experienced at defending the site and communicating + remembering where 3 or 4 out 5 enemies are and where they most likely will go then run outs are essential imo. Any risky rotation or peek requires some mitigation in the form of communication but the reward is drastically higher for run outs, at the very least you get early man advantage (bc even if it’s 4v4 after the refrag your defense is (or should be) based around 4 players while the offense day  usually plans for all 5 being alive). and at best winning the round because a thatcher/hard breacher was picked off.
---
Spawn peeking becomes an ingrained aspect of the game at a certain level so the best thing a less experienced player can do is just try to remember which spawns are the safest on each map and go in slow (especially when approaching a side of the building with multiple windows). Then eventually learn all the specific run outs/peeks and have someone on drones there during last 3 seconds of prep phase.
---
What they mean is they wouldn't play him as much if they nerf his weapon thus impacting the utility because they won't want to pick him. I don't get people with this mindset. I play operators that are needed but have weaker loadouts all the time. It's called being a team player.
---
It’s more popular on US servers so I was saying the best even if there’s not much, the most of them are on US.
---
listen here you little shit...
---
Have you never played buck?
---
what happend? did you spawn the x button or something?
---
Which is weird. Ember Rise is about to be first operation where we got only 1 Elite skin
---
Yeah I know
---
What?
---
It would mean Echo has to stay on his drone for longer while someone else rushes. Or he would rush and possibly not make it in time.
---
Then just shoot him. Big 4head
---
But probably I ll be accept
---
It’s really not tho
---
https://purechaose.github.io/r6maps/ by /u/purechaose is a great resource for the maps with callouts
---
Club house rework is missing but everything else is there (kanal, theme park etc). The problem with the clubhouse rework is that that the assets have not been released by ubi. I made a budget one myself, including some 1 or 2 custom callouts I found more appropriate than the one on the compass

Good advice to bad he ignored it. Also do you use angled and acog on m760

Aim for the Head
---
There is no need to defend a gun which isn’t predictable. Just face jt.
---
No? I  didn't even say that lmao 
---
&gt;You can prefire easilly if you know someone is there
---
If you know they're there prefiring is easy. A good player checks that their spawn point is safe during the prep phase and reacts accordingly.  
---
The fact that you thought that's what I meant says volumes about how you play the game.
---
It saved their k/d (if they actually care that much). They could have also tried to leave before you started doing it.

Nice ace but that’s unfortunate same thing happened to me

Rip, I’ve never played on EU servers before

Name checks out.

Wow so you're number 1 champion I gues? Ki ggeorge has 5100 ish mmr

Well my uplay name is OO_mUrKy
---
Yeah, she’s kind of a hoss 😅

Thank you!

Okay! Could you tell me what was bland about it?
---
I'm missing the point here, idk what skin ur talking about.. Is it the Mira weapon skin?
---
Yes it keeps doing it because the instance is bugged. You will never find a game. There's a glitch/bug that basically as I see tells you you're looking for a match but hasn't actually added to you matchmaking queue.
---
This gets posted every other day. It's not new.
---
The shotgun is too small, but It's really good
---
I main Ela and besides myself I run into someone taking ela maybe once every 20 rounds.
---
Rebirth :D
---
I’ll add you next time I’m on
---
bruh thats a lot of info, t h a n k s.Although i mostly see finals being separated into a few days,which day is the actual end of the finals (aka the last match for the win)
---
Yes he is, the Vector skin.
---
Hiding like my dad :-;
---
Its literally just like watching marley / tuxbird without the text or belligerent screams
---
There was no reason not to considering how well put together it was. Also it had great funny moments your team is even funnier than Tux and his friends good job!
---
Indeed that's true but at least it's closer to it's origin than this new title EVER will be. I have an opinion and I am allowed to express it. I'm totally fine with changes to games especially if the game has been around as long as RS has but a total remake with a complete new approach, style and dynamics is just wrong to the community and die hard fans. As I said in the title: some may like it but I hate it
---
Predator vibes here
---
Just play the game and don’t be a shithead, don’t be salty because someone knocked you
---
PS4
---
Is he taking notes from my dad?! Is he my dad?! DAD?!
---
WOW
---
Yet when I posted there was no comments.
---
^(Proceed to become a reaction channel due to said compliment)
---
They don’t wanna hear it
---
Play the game A LOT yourself, find a buddy who wants to learn himself, watch twitch when you’re not playing, watch YouTube of pros/ pro games and watch how they maneuver around the map. Idk, just put a lot of time in.
---
No problem mate
---
I found this comment again and I'm still mad that I literally researched it for you just so you'd ignore me lmao
---
What type of milk do they drink in South Korea
---
First off most clips you see are likely fairly compressed while regular game audio isn’t but if your having trouble I going to tell you a few things which help me beacuse I live in a pretty noisy city so first if you can always have a decent headset second make sure the audio settings for everything is correct beacuse both for my pc and Xbox my settings just love to revert to default so make sure you have the correct settings and the best thing is to have max audio no matter what in game settings and as loud as your headset will allow you make get tinnitus but hay it’s worth it
---
Strange but you can see it since is top comment in this thread.
---
He took too really his job
---
Necessary.
---
The good version of the clone wars
---
No it's not strange, I commented when there was no comments, took a little longer to Wright it out as I'm at work.
---
Im not going on another thread just to repeat myself..
---
u garbage boi :)
---
Ips is fantastic, I love it so much I can’t give it up.
---
I love you too😉
---
You care beacuse someone with a lower level has done stuff I higher level player hasent I’ve played this game over 1500 hours on pc and Xbox combined and only have gotten maybe 3 kills with them well if you really need kills with it frost bandit combo is good
---
#*BIG THINK*
---
That shows how good the physics works
---
*throws impact*
---
 I commented to a guy that had same question as yours and so I answered it in this thread. I should have told you my answer since it would have been faster. Sorry for wasting your and have a good day at work.
---
Again, you don't need a full 5 stack to drastically reduce your chances of running into griefers.
---
*hourglass intensifies*
---
That’s why I haven’t seen a jager put down their gadgets sense I reached gold people do pretty much use him for the gun
---
Although it is an upset to console players (I only know this because I have console friends), I believe the nerf was necessary. At least we won’t have broken shotguns for now.
---
Otaku detected
---
So my friends are idiots
---
I can help you I’m copper 1 if you want to add me my nick is wrongcastlebud btw is that ps or Xbox
---
pretty sure they arent, never see them in casuals.
---
Looks a bit too op
---
I’m a console player too
---
Alternative*
---
I'm hippofun11 on ps4 silver 2
---
Xbox
---
Controlling shotgun on console is hard and also smg 12
---
Everyone would be able to change it so it would not be a advantage
---
I’m running it on Xbox, I broke my PS4
---
Ok than I cannot help you
---
Fair enough. I mean, the nerf isn’t too serious for me, but it’s nice to hear about shotgun balancing.
---
Dude look at his skin, It is darker. BB is Pasty.
---
Shout out to that one dude that I played with in casual who was just calling everyone trash and stuff. Then on about the third round he goes “well I guess o can’t really say anything because I’ve been kind of shot this game too” that’s what I call character development
---
Good gun but i dont like Gridlock
---
wtf
---
Not really putting myself in an inconvenience but you do you mate.
---
I find him very fun to play but i play Kaid a little more though
---
Is this proof that Tachanka does not in fact need a buff?
---
Because its a high risk high reward one. It, unlike Jäger's, uses attack's utility against them. Which is either just a phoof or a major set for attack.
---
Basically, from what I can tell with the limited time I've put into it, balance.
---
Bruh I hate when this happens. It's the most annoying fooking thing when you're in a 1v1 and trying to lay low only to have some high pitched metal screeching blasting through the map because you're standing on some small tiny piece of broken decor.
---
You would rather completely close the game, relaunch, and then queue into another match than let someone interrogate you. 
---
Hahaha bro, YoUrE sO FuNnY
---
Does playing on streched res give u an advantage or not. Been thinking of playing a few games streched
---
**knowing characters/abilities** is certainly an advantage though you'll pick that up pretty fast..  
---
Its not nearly as fantastical as Overwatch (which I played loads before Siege)
---
Cosplaying Who? No one looks like that
---
Yo tking is bad. There's no justification for tking, especially when you have a **MUTE** button, unless that idiot is a hacker.
---
He's an idiot kid. Not a hacker or a troll. Don't tk.
---
Naw he still needs it. There's like only 4 places you can do this effectively in the entire game.
---
How do you know??
---
Same just got random op’d onto her 😂
---
That's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it? Why *are* we here? I mean, are we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a god watching everything?
---
I don't know, man, but it keeps me up at night.
---
old lighting not missed but was beautiful and this seasonal skin that i missed because i started at velvet shell and didnt have time
---
Sadly I spent my savings on pilot program sets.
---
But I'm **terribly** disappointed that no pilot program skin was for IQ. LIKE, CTZN just dropped a crazy amount of kills with iq and there's no Navi skin for her. Silly.
---
No one knows for sure, but that's the meme.
---
Love the gun just don’t really like her play style.
---
Just as I said, you do you. And yes, I still stand by my statement, I'd relaunch my game over being interrogated.
---
I saw one person already dead tho. You killed 4 people.
---
I try to do that whenever I'm not caught with my pants down but sometimes I feel like there's no escape haha
---
Playing siege for the first time is like recruits everywhere
---
Jackal wasn't, isn't and never will be a low risk high reward op. He's like Cav on attack- he capitalises on bad positioning and bad site setups. He's just a fragger with some utility. If you can set up crossfires and good sites, he's nothing great. No wonder his pick and ban rates are WAY lower than  that of ranked. In ranked, people just comfort ban and don't want to learn to adapt.
---
Hello UncleSam50, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e2ij2q/fan_made_r6_operator_ive_made_and_done_a_lot_of/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Not culture.
---
This hurts me to look at
---
I'm laughing so hard rn. You're such a prankster.
---
I watched this like 6 times thinking it was the same clip lol
---
Yeah i waited untill i was level 100 to play ranked to make sure i knew maps operators recoil control and what not.
---
You just took over Ash's role lol
---
I don’t know why but i would feel bad for leaving during an interrogation so I would just sit there and let cav interrogate me then slam ALT F4
---
I see you’re using your education wisely.
---
You don't.
---
But for him taking away one of your drones, you just ruined his day by taking away everything. What if it was a misfire? What if he's a level 5 new guy? I had a new player who shot my Trax. I didn't tk. Teach, instead of eliminating.
---
There's NEVER any reason to tk unless it's a hacker or a consistent troll.
---
If cosmetics held no value to the user, they wouldn't be charging for them, they probably wouldn't make any at all.
---
I was meaning that with sarcasm that may not have come across but I 100% agree with you, Tachanka should have his lmg as a primary, jump to a three speed, throw in some impacts, and they make him immune to headshots. That would be a good place to start.
---
Only if cav has started the interrogation, if the rage quitter was a split second faster nothing would have happened.
---
“Remember, no Jackal.”
---
Also ubi please change his name to trackal.
---
Well the proposal for 4 bans is being supported vehemently. There's even a proposition for ban-save-ban system. So you might see some news in a year.
---
:)
---
He gambles for good teammates to carry him so he can brag on reddit about his rank.
---
They aren't level 5 in Play/Diamond bud.
---
Good for you I guess?
---
her smg is garbage on pc too, you can burst fire but even then its so unreliable or hard to control that i never bother with her
---
Still means you are doing too much per mag.
---
I haven’t played siege in a while but here warrants a buff? Or are you joking
---
[removed]
---
*Real shit*
---
Speed dial, hold 3 to call someone immediately.
---
Name one advantage changing the optic has.
---
That's me too
---
Then he's a troll, or misfire.
---
Misfire? Please don't tk. Just ask him not to do it again, politely. I can understand the frustration as a fellow Moz player, but it's necessary not to be aggressive right at the start.
---
Troll? Consistent troll? Get rid of him. As you please.
---
there is no other reason then pedophilia to draw a older female game character as a underage extremely oversized neckbeards wetdream
---
And Bandit has **Drugs**
---
what skin are you talking about?
---
Really, denying droning from the stairs in Oregon isn't really that useful since you  can just breach the hatch and throw drones from there.
---
Shes italian
---
Oh. Same here lol but spawn kills make me sad
---
why not both? fact is that jager is basically done at the end of prep and is a pure fragger during the round, and it's certainly an aspect of why he's so strong.
---
yeah im so sick of people trying to defend this shit, just call it what it fucking is its pedophilia
---
She’s from [Libya](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Alibi)

New chankykan elite
---
Maybe instead of getting mad at them for running out maybe be more cautious when exiting spawn by droning and rappelling in a safe position. Also Claymores and Nomad are a godsend if you want to prevent runouts.
---
Nice opinion, it is only an opinion though. Also it is false.
---
It’s like they didn’t want to make her to hot so they put the jacket on her now u can barely see the cool design on her shirt
---
vigil elite???
---
i would unload 2 magazines in him just to be sure
---
I had the same problem long long ago. Took a long break and came back when para bellum or whatever its called was going on. I missed so much and was surprised that I didn't have to buy anymore attachments and was confused that i had all the base ops. I met my current online friend on there very shortly after i got back into it and for that reason alone i stayed and got better. Met a bunch of other fun guys as well and we are all good friends now. 
---
Tldr get some friends. Find them somewhere either gamechat or that app that siege YouTubers are promoting ( sorry I don't know the like name, i don't use it )
---
in casual you have shit like favela and house where you basically have to peek and run out or you can just hand the lube to the attackers and bend over.
---
And it's not like it's op. if anything it's often free kills for the attackers.
---
It needs more ROF not damage
---
I used to play 4:3 but recently switched back to 16:10. Holo just fits my playstyle more than acog ever will.
---
She’s upset she’s getting nerfed again and I can feel that on a personal and physical level.
---
For me it's the opposite
---
She lives in italy, joined italian special forces there for shes italian
---
This was an incredibly dumb balance change, she is gonna be garbage because of this massive nerf
---
Dinners ready
---
No. He is in a perfect spot atm.
---
Okay, but she’s not Caucasian is my point.
---
Ruining Cavs fun by not allowing the interrogation? There are 2 sides just because you wanted to recruit rush and didnt think for even a second there would be a cav doesnt mean the other person should have to lose their fun.
---
Nope, play him right and he is a decent roamer, good guns, 3 speed, impacts, and his gadget athough hard to learn is very useful
---
Very Atomic Blonde, got mixed feelings about it atm
---
I only reach about 14hs on console but I played like two matches on tts on tower, which is a shotgun friendly map so yeah...
---
No lol.

Just add collision to dead bodies.

I am a platinum 2 on console and I see no Ela, at all. I pretty much just see Jager, Vigil, Bandit that’s basically it
---
I would say we play one Smurf per match, on average. That tells me that at the gold level 1 in 5 players are smurfs. I'd bet it's alot higher at low silver. This is embarassing for a organization. Ive played alot of sports throughout my life and all competitive leagues have some sort of rules to prevent top tier players and teams from playing low tier leagues / tournaments. Ubi doesn't seam to care, even tho thier terms say only one account per person
---
Where the button for report newcomers

Uncontrollable high sens = good

Anybody ever look at the german eye colour and hair colour? Blonde hair, blue eyes... exactly how a dead german wanted the german people to look like...

If you won’t come to us we will come to you
---
No, the reason the FO12 is picked is because Elas scorpion is absolutely 100% useless on console. And I never see the SASG besides on Finka, but I rarely ever see Finka. This was a pointless balance change, Ela will now be worthless on console since her shotgun was needed into the ground, and the Scorpion is unusable 
---
It’s difficult to aim on a controller but it’s not that hard
---
Shes just speed dialing the bomb, it's a feature on old phones.
---
You get downvoted because people in general hate smurfs because they ruin the enjoyment of others for thier own enjoyment, it's dishonest and the equivalent of using performance enhancing drugs in sports.
---
In your cause in PvE this doesn't really apply.
---
Plat 3, level 47. It's either a smurf or MNK or both.
---
You could argue this is the best way to learn.  Frustrating enough to make many put down the game for sure though.  I do wish there was a way to combat smurf accounts.  There just isn’t.
---
I'd like this, not for any balancing reasons but just so I could dogpile with my friends to block an exit
---
Silver 5 to copper 5 sounds more like a you problem m8
---
Im top
---
There is no auto aim because I don’t need it, I have no issues at all getting kills on console
---
Everyone here is telling you to get some friends to play this game and they are absolutely right. https://squads.tm/game-r6 and r/R6STeams can help you find people to play with. Also, play more unranked until you are comfortable enough to play ranked, as that is where the most balanced and fair part of the game is. It sounds intimidating but ranked is actually a lot less sweaty then casual is.
---
oh those were from the invitational event...that's gone forever now, I thought you would know that by now with this game
---
It is absolutely justified.
---
Because ubisoft balances at a cripplingly slow pace
---
I just got this but I haven’t played any ranked games yet
---
Stop being great by continuing this joke
---
Thank you !!
---
I agree.
---
But as Ela Main,
---
That design displeases me.
---
Well castle is apparently thermites friend and Mira makes everyone’s gadgets, and need I mention ela and zofia are sisters? Plus a lot of them are from the same unit(I.e gsg9 spetznas, sas etc)
---
we get the aug on defence, need i say more
---
Thenx random stranger :)
---
It's all about how you want to play, and what you find fun
---
I doubt spawnpeeking will ever be removed or punished, unless Ubi is gonna put unbreakable castle barricades on all windows and doors leading outside and barricade all exterior softwalls it’s gonna stick around and the spawnpeekers only seem to get saltier every day
---
Certainly better than anything i can do. Looks great!
---
Happy Birthday dude!
---
(       )
---
I was on a smurf, playing casual. (PS4)
---
Kaid
---
I play a couple hours a night ranked and unranked. Honestly see less smurfs in ranked more in unranked and constant in casual. 
---
 I also run a siege stats site siegestats.com so i pay attention to numbers. I don't record specifically ranks and levels of opposition but I can (just have to enter each player's name into siegestats and it tracks individual match's, PC players only at the moment)
---
I think I will have to write some queries to look specifically at possible smurfs per match (under LVL 20 plat rank)
---
Uplay is on offline mode ???
---
Hmm, must have been patched recently, I remember seeing draws but I suppose i haven't noticed. That said, there were still other attackers alive, so I feel like OP would have either died or at least been downed, not that he lived because defenders died
---
Stop stabbing my ankles
---
This page has hidden stuff: Olympic event Y5S1 on Thatcher and to the far left may be the new sprites for the Y5S1 ops or pulse and castle but with dreads
---
They are fixing it sometime in Y5, but that's all ~~we~~ I know right now
---
Only on console
---
soon™
---
why not?
---
I mean its fine, The MMR cap is annoying as hell, but i just don't see the point of it when players are goiing to the extreme to get around the cap or create smurf accounts just to play at lower ranks with friends because of the cap. 
---
This mismatch has happened more than once now. a few days before that we got match with 3 plat players, and none of us were even silver.
---
Well, anyway, there is no justification for Scorpion to be that much unpredictable.
---
You have to be pretty quick to mute in this game, unfortunately. People are irrational, vindictive assholes.
---
Silver V starts at 2100MMr and plat III at 3200. So I plat III (with 3200MMR) could play with a silver III (2200MMR)
---
Aww
---
:0
---
&gt; I disagree, I use my smurf to solo queue and get it to play regularly. But while leveling I wanted to spend my time help people
---
and also shit all over the other team. There's 5 people in the match having a shit time because you felt "helpful".
---
Goddamn, I have played on smurfs on both casual and newcomer and have never seen anything close to this. You found the absolute bottom.
---
At first I thinked what you see all with montagne-shield hud.
---
Probably a pain to code into the game and will only be used very rarely
---
Stop opening my reinforced walls
---
If you are going to buy it anyway then I don’t really see any valid reason to hate on it then. This skin fits her perfectly in terms of character. She’s rebellious and expresses that on an artistic level.
---
it would be used more than the protect the bank hostage event.
---
Stop making towers
---
right, but the issue was they weren't plat 3 players, and even so isn't that still above 1000 MMR?
---
According to the book, I believe so.
---
That’s not exactly hard
---
Ubisoft should use IP bans to prevent script kiddies from getting accounts. Its not much but it could help against the cheaters who dont use VPN's.
---
I dont think smurfs should be banned, but the IP should be scanned and newcomers playlist should be blocked.
---
If minecraft servers, some garry's mod  servers do it, and the players are fine with it, im sure ubisoft can
---
my friend is gold and when i was silver 2 i could play w/ him
---
Tattoo was done By Dave Shoemaker of Hi Octane Tattoo in Auburn New Hampshire
---
No it was a partnership IIRC
---
Stop zooming
---
Coz you are offline lmao
---
Why does that ruin your immersion?
---
everyone here complains how they suffer watching this but we all know that the true pain would have been Twitch leaving the objective in that 1v1 situation
---
You love to see that ?
---
When will we learn how to rotate the text in ms paint
---
Idk. Idr them announcing or stating a partnership.
---
Thanks
---
It was unranked
---
New game compared to console huh!
---
Nice repost from trending...
---
Newcomer caps at lv 50, which you can hit after like a good 10-20 hours of gameplay.
---
IIRC on console it's free and easy to make smurf accounts though so the level cap doesn't stop them.
---
[deleted]
---
as long as you're not beyond the 1000 MMR cap you should be fine. My issue takes with being matched with plat 2 players recently, i being a silver 5.
---
kaid
---
Ohh I see, thanks
---
Nice
---
You cant do newcomer after lvl 50, but let's take a moment to appreciate WaW, arguably the best CoD.
---
Well I do, but I just want to know why people hate him, no offense.
---
It’s sad because the same thing has happened to me, but the last one was doc and he self-revived after like 5 seconds and my teammates didn’t do jack-shit to stop him
---
I do and was confused. Thought mozzie got them.
---
Who jerk themselves off saying 'ez' in the chat like retards.
---
I never new that
---
Still have dbd tho that game trash.
---
I prefer the F90 over her LMG
---
Yes know
---
Sounds like a pretty easy fix to me
---
I bet a dollar you don't even remember an Obama slogan
---
Ps4 eu down for me.
---
Yh that’s fair enough but it’s definelty better than dry content or just boring talking so carry on
---
It's the layout changing, the font and that it looks like it's kinda badly cropped onto the lefts screen texture
---
What platform are you on
---
u/bikiniBodhi
---
No I’d feel bad for you because you don’t have armor.
---
Legally in Tom Clancy’s contract they can’t use counterterroist vs counterterroist combat and you can’t play as terrorists. Training was the only option in the premise of the game
---
And?
---
But it follows every other characters backstory
---
Yeah its probably because i was less than 10 years old when he first became president.
---
Plus, you're missing the point. MAGA is an anthem of hate and white nationalism.
---
This is fucking crazy
---
No youre not, you are trying to justify you being in copper while in reality throwers have very little to do with it
---
 Can’t either...
---
He is a dosser and mnk warrior. Im assuming youre seeing his past few matches (like 8 or 9 matches) and it looks like 1 because of r6tracker. He isn't gaining that much mmr per game.

One game my teammates did nothing but destroyed my gadgets and it was on ranked and harassed me through messages on ps4

Can’t connect on console

If you saw 90% of the elites you’d understand, did you expect the basic horny bikini set?
---
Ps4 servers are also down
---
There’s a reason I play casual

---
And? Youre looking too deep into it mate. If you see something that looks kinda like a swastika do you think its intentional and the owners are racist?
---
I play Ela and advise against this, just use burst mode and you'll be fine, as long as you know how to control the recoil. 2 bursts = dead enemies. 3 bursts for the 3 armour ops, because why the FUCK are playing Fuze on hostage you maniac!
---
This is completely unrelated to any games I just previously played.
---
PC WEU Down
---
Yes. Dumbass.
---
PC
---
Its drawn on a phone with a white background

It looks like it’s on a whiteboard.
---
Servers are mostly down, I can get in but it took very very long.
---
I have the same issue too, are they really?
---
No?
---
Can’t on ps4
---
I mean the scorpion is pretty easy to use after a bit of practice
---
Do you even know what ping is? Da fuq is "having a ping"? Do you play siege in one of ubisoft's datacenter?
---
I remember this leaking a long time ago, couldn't find the pictures though. Glad you have it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Unfortunately it might be another case of the missing vintage bundle. They just decided to scrap it for no reason. A real shame, too, because it looks nice. That being said, the lava skin leaked in this invitational too, and that was later a universal season pass skin. This could be, too, for year 5.
---
She’s an angel
---
Put the armour on a table, if they dont want to bend down to grab their armour, help their backs out
---
nice engrish
---
The 1000 MMR limit only applies within your stack.  But stacks/solos can be placed together so that the total spread is greater than 1000MMR.
---
I agree but several bullets come out every time you pull the trigger.  The shot gun is way better just saying jet other gun isn't horrible.
---
Reset game
---
Reload the game and itll be there, common bug
---
I’m having the same issue.
---
Lol. Mine isn't the greatest all the time either.
---
Tried to restart the game? This happens alot
---
Idts. To top it all off, he's donning that stupid american bandana like some sort of hillbilly trash. 100% maverick is a white supremacist. Lol
---
 Nope.

Can you draw a Predator next? It’ll look great if you use the modern cloaking instead of the first movie’s CG!
---
Last I checked every headshot bypasses armor, or does enough that armor effectively does nothing.

Not connecting NA East here

On xbox? Doubt it

Fuck, it’s being nerfed, its the only reason I throw my controller across the room
---
Yeah there down
---
Noooooooo way this is real holy shit
---
You dolt, games are played for FUN, WINNING contributes to FUN but is not FUN by itself
---
Down for me too
---
was this supposed to be a highlight or something lmao
---
Ah the typical ash main using a defensive action to protect itself from the predators
---
proud to help you good sir!
---
Idk man plenty of people could agree that winning is fun. Maybe you just aren’t good and play this thinking it’s cod. I’m sure getting picked off in the beginning isn’t FUN for your team when you lose
---
Same, I had a booster on too that’s about to end 
---
Fuze doesnt likes anyone except his Spetnaz mates
---
Same
---
New leaning buff?
---
I know what your saying and it might have been just me but I had a stroke while reading this
---
Imagine how bad the defensive team was...
---
happy birthday! guess we’re birthday twins 💕

Reddit said my post was too long. So I had to make a separate comment to write what I wanted to put at the end of my initial response:
---
Also, thanks for taking the time to make a thorough response. I saw your "lol jesus the weebs are really mad i don't like their waifu" comment and thought to myself "Wow. This guy is just going to end the discussion with that, huh? He has completely missed the point. Oh well." But then, I saw later that you made a different comment that went point by point responding to mine. I know they don't take 2 seconds to type out, either. So thanks again.
---
I think Mozzie and Wamai
---
Yeah, when somebody is downed and than disconnects, it should still count as a death and a kill for whoever downed him.
---
Nomad, Gridlock, Kaid and Alibi are definitely "good" operators, but the final decision should be based off which one would fit your playstyle the most. For example, on attack I play mostly gridlock because I like 3 armors and she's great at countering flanks, which I die to constantly
---
She's good if you want to have fun.
---
Gridlock, Mozzie, Goyo, and both S4 ops look really promising.
---
Nawww, I thought Ubi may have gifted it to me for being the most improved player this season.
---
Because the newcomer playlist is nothing but trolls abusing new players to boost their KDR and rank hence the low level requirement
---
*want to have no gadget because when you use it you die.
---
Yep go to Ubisoft support servers and you see that they have unexpected issues
---
Movie definitely,  his pest are extremely good if used correctly, both his main guns are lasers (commando 9 is much better for long range) both side arms are great,  his pistol is better paired with his SMG,  lastly he has Nitro cell.  Need I say more?
---
It's utilizing all the hatches, and destructible floors/ceilings in the map. It's used heavily on both sides in higher levels to cover objectives, entrances or vital camping spots from above (or below if you're skilled enough)
---
Ok I I can we just buff tachanka and make him be able to spin 360 I mean it’s an easy buff
---
If it did nothing then what did they do to it?
---
I'm sorry mate, but it's just a server outage :/
---
In all honesty if the tryhards really wanna play tryhards they should do that trend of Spawnpeeking the attackers with health stims. It’d atleast help their aim at long ranges and the attacker they hit actually gets to have fun in the round
---
your gf is really damn good, kudos~
---
Wait a few weeks for the new ops :p
---
And that's how you make a Russian Joker
---
Get good with it then.
---
in my personal opinion I don't think amaru is a terrible op it's that she is still new and people haven't found the proper way to use her besides rushing objective
---
aww, that sucks :/
---
That right there is some next level trolling.
---
Except you cant.
---
Im a new player and there were these very clear smurfing group of like 3 people on my team and they kept killing me at the start of every round and they'd spend a minute just shoot at my head and teabagging. Tbh I was thinking was it because I picked Caveira and she's a bad pick or something? I reported em anyway and just concluded they were toxic haha
---
Shit.
---
This just simply cannot be real....
---
I wouldn't say she's OP because of how loud her gadget is, and her time before pulling her weapon out again. But she's certainly an option if you like cheeky plays and the other team isn't expecting it
---
You have no control with it you can’t move or shoot while using it so it literally is terrible above copper.
---
Agreed. From the 9 nerfs and 0 buffs she's been given I feel like Ubisoft or even their small team of play testers even plays Ela in the first place. She's useless now and sadly I main her still.
---
You son of a bitch you did it
---
Restart your game, it’s a glitch that happens to me too but it should be there after u restart
---
Oh didnt saw that sry...
---
Just when I come back from a 4 month break
---
They should do it in the same animated style as the Hammer and Scalpel short.
---
That AK-47 better be modernized.
---
Yes! She has great guns and a great gadget if you know how to use it to get places fast and catch people off guard. In my opinion the gadget needs not be quieter.

I think Oregon is leaving for a rework anyway?
---
I see nothing but two casual pistol kills?
---
You should still get the elo
---
There is a server issue going on right now, so you'll probably get it later. Don'r worry!
---
Happy Birthday!
---
Happy birthday back atcha
---
Yeah they should also give me a few thousands dollars and a free car
---
wdym? i'm playing just fine
---
Is the simple solution
---
Ok thank you. I didn't think server degredation would glitch me a season pass. Lol
---
I saw a youtubr say that he is good so I think youtuber correct
---
Master of stealth.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah it’s just the servers shitting out and working hard but hardly working.
---
This would really help in Club House and Villa
---
me too lmao
---
No clue but I can get into games just my friends list has disappeared
---
Enemy team "Thatcher"
---
It sounds like you've been playing above the MMR where smurfs/derankers are a problem.  But it's a huge problem at lower MMR.  In previous seasons 2/3-3/4 of matches below silver featured at least one obvious smurf, but silver and above were generally smurf free.  This season, I'm seeing more smurfs in silver.  It's under 50% (of matches, not players), but not by much.
---
So you are saying the gadget is bad, not the op. Yes, the gadget is not the best but if you use it right it can be good. Instead of rushing obj, use it to catch people off guard by getting somewhere quick. You are just using it wrong.
---
finally somebody who understand what i mean
---
Well, Ash here was about to get 3-0’d in Casual so leaving is kinda understable.
---
That doesn’t change the point that the game is meant to win. You just feel safe when you’re outside but that’s the point of the detection. Part of the game is about situational awareness no? So do you need to really be handheld that much more that instead of listening for a run out or droning for a spawnpeek, you need to be instantly detected. Maybe they should give you a minimap too and aim assist
---
Ebay?
---
Badass!
---
Restart the game
---
Play games.
---
I CANT STOP LAUGHING AT THIS COMMENT LOL!
---
Doesn’t this blow it up or no?
---
She said point and shoot, so I assume PC?
---
Ikr
---
That was absolutely hilarious. What level were they?
---
We need a frost mat
---
I have it for this, M870, MP5, and Thermite's AR
---
i don’t agree with this tbh. i have bad (and frankly, i don’t care about it) k/d but sometimes i just don’t want to play on a certain map or be with toxic teammates. casual is meant for people to chill out and have fun, if i’m not having fun why shouldn’t i be able to leave?
---
yeah
---
And Ella’s grzmot
---
The first or second bullet without ads hit your head
---
I've been playing for about a year and have been able to solo queue to plat. I do not play any sort of support role when I solo queue because I can't trust my teammates to help me get my job done.  I don't necessarily just pick Ash and Jaeger every round either. It's honestly a lot harder because success really tests your ability to adapt. Every round the op I choose is based on the rest of my teammates, and what I do in the round is based on their positioning. Basically to solo queue into plat you really need to understand the overall strategy of a site from both attack and defense, mostly because at that elo the other team is making plenty of mistakes too and you need to capitalize on that to win.
---
fuck off boomer
---
If anyone is seen with the ash elite chibi or duck charm it qualifies as a copper session, nothing to see here folks. Just some big brain boys tryna reach silver!
---
Not really especially with the price reduction. I feel the initial increase to 1k per Pathfinder operators actually was a good idea too.
---
What is this subreddit for then?
---
cringe
---
A 3 day booster. Weak
---
Honestly at this point I've just given up so have my mates. All we want is a fun competitive game we are happy to lose but when its literally 10 games in a row with with smurfs rather is just no point
---
Honestly super well done
---
Its not leaving itself is bad, but more like leaving just to save their k/d.
---
Yep, I can play Casual but not with friends.
---
Um, English is not my first language but I think its called a 'pun'.Technically.
---
Not REALLY new, been watching Therussianbadger for a year now and I have IQ, Mute, Smonk, Kapkan, Thatcher, Thermite, Ash, Blitz, Monty, Tachanka and recently Buck
---
My other 2 options are either Dokkaebi or Lion
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
The pathfinders for 1k that’s fine and dandy, but from 1k to 15k to 20k and so on is a big jump
---
Very nice
---
A'ight then brother you couldn't let me proud for a sec?
---
A lot of the time, it completely changes the colour scheme. If I see a blueish colour I know it'll be French, If I see  muted greens I know Spetsnaz, Gray Casual GSG9, Bright yellow CBRN. Problem is when Kapkan is completely blue and I misidentify. 
---
It's not just not knowing half the time, it's thinking they're someone else and that can lead to a situation being handled incorrectly.

This is a really fast, tight shooter, I don't have the time or even the visuals most of the time to go over their uniform's features and minor details to figure out who I'm looking at.

And a gu

What’ wrong with the chibi? I payed big quids to get that bundle and fuck me if I ain’t gonna use it.
---
Bless you
---
Low levels, not even ranked probably
---
10k per most year ones at this point. And the price goes down every season not to mention its to give you a chance to adjust to older operators before throwing new ones at you. I personally think it's fine cause it's not much if you play a good bit a day or every couple days. Plus Christmas last year they gave I think 2 free ops away.
---
Sorry pc 😅

The EDD chain reaction the Vulcàn shield.

Oh I forgot about that damn that is a hell of a combo

Yeah, I know but that’s insane.

Start em off young
---
That's the point I'm making. Big brain bois spending mega renown on a bloody duck charm bundle..
---
Yes thats what i wantes to say. Everything is ok and working,the only problem is that we can't play with friends....
---
If you got put on a team with cheaters it makes sense
---
What changed with the lighting?
---
Imagine being a grown ass man and still throwing out the "THE GAME IS CHEATING!" excuse lol.
---
honestly though it sort of works out... should there be a warning to new players yes of course and should smurfs even exist nope but it keeps the smurfs away from casual which is good in a sense
---
put a scope on bruh. other than that nice job
---
How do you know that? Their financials are not public knowledge.
