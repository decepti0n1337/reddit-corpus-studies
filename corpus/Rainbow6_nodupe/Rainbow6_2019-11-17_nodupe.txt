by far the coolest and most interesting homebrew op I've ever seen. awesome dude!
---
It‚Äôs different for everyone. Im ranked right at the top of the bell curve and even at peak hours some games will start in 2 seconds and then it randomly takes 5 minutes the next game
---
Its already in custom games, doesnt recquire any effort att all plus it would Please those few people
---
It sort of works how certain camouflages work, it breaks up the profile of a person and your brain doesn't immediately recognize it as a person. If you're paying attention to your surroundings, then it's obvious. But, because R6 has you looking out for active threats instead of passive, stationary objects, you don't recognize it.
---

---
basically it works cuz ur brain dum, so that's why people do it.
---
Why would save them lol the one that was posted today is now lost in new

oh yeah, look at the gamer chair on this one

‚ÄúAn ACOG‚Äù
---
How'd you die 20 seconds into the round?
---
While I agree with what you're saying, I think people are angry because they feel like Ubi is pandering to brain-dead memelords by giving them the ACOG on the BOSG.
---
No. Have a good day
---
Great
---
I wonder what happened if everybody had a cock

Play SCP secret lavatory that is real toxicity

It's actually based off of a real life painting, actually pretty famous painting. It's called The Great Wave off Kanagawa if you are interested.

I do it all the time whenever I play J√§ger. Somehow become a drone magnet and before I know it there's a chat message, "ALL: wtf happened to our drones"

*but* with the right set of hands the time to kill is faster than you can say ‚Äúis that blitz?‚Äù
---
cares
---
That doesn't help
---
Those console players are most likely on M&amp;K to be honest
---
The only problem they need to fix with run outs is the detect timer. I‚Äôm not frustrated by run outs or spawn peeks but if you‚Äôre supposed to get spotted after being outside for 2 seconds you really should. It‚Äôs dumb for their to be a timer for 2 seconds when in some cases you can be outside for 5 seconds before being spotted.
---
You My friend, are retarded
---
*in the distance* what‚Äôs up brahs, today we have best new cam spots
---

you act like cs doesn‚Äôt have any problems and cs is dead. it‚Äôs been on the downhill since 2016.

Fuck It's so nice thanks for the reply been looking for ages.
---
What's M&amp;K?
---
Mouse and keyboard
---
I once saw a similar thing on a video. He went up on turret and his friend suddenly died next to him, to the turret in the kill feed. Also no shots fired.
---
Oh ok
---
SHOOTED down by ADS. No. No fuckin way.
---
Mozzie mains be like
---
Insta kills tend to get patched, bank run outs are the worse though. IMO, I know you said you don‚Äôt feel like the get gud just prefire mindset is the way to go, but to learn the common spots, and do them yourself. They do take a certain amount of skill, and if you preaim where YOU would run out, you are so much more likely to kill them. If you get spawnpeeked, just sit on cams, and ask yourself what you could have done to stop that peek (drone, be patient etc.)

i have the orginal disc on my xbox you think i can get it to work somehow??

Illl have a look , it's a amazing skin gutted i missed out.
---
To play devil's advocate: how do we know that? I mean, the vast majority of the people calling for this don't give a shit about balance and are just parroting what one Youtuber suggested because "lol, meme".
---
I don't actually believe this, BTW - I'm just trying to get into the minds of the complainers.
---
Nathan is a cheater, though, so two of the top three are invalid.

The only accessories are only third party. I've looked it up.

Dang, that looks amazing!

If you could play offline yes! But Siege requires internet connection so its nit possible atm
---
that's so sad
---
200IQ play right there
---
And what happens when you get lagged out or your game just has issued that hurt you. You get banned permanently for something you cant control? For an entire season? The current system is fine and those players got punished
---
U Might have set it for your controller settings if ur on pc

Go for it! I find it to be a lot better if you have some friends who play it with you. I also see it as it's never too late to join and you'll be heading in practically at the start of a new season.
---
I was just plat 3 today and now I'm lower end of gold 1
---
There‚Äôs always new players popping up here and there, it‚Äôs definitely worth trying out. You will need to invest a fair bit of time though to understand how the game works as it‚Äôs not your typical FPS. It‚Äôs *really* fun when you get the hang of it, especially if you also have a few friends to play with.
---
Sorry for the confusion. Have a good day!
---
Unless youre A) unusually lucky, consistently; or B) high plat-diamond, solo-Q is an easy way to throw away elo. The amount of trolls, team killers, leavers, people that wont communicate or work as a team, and just bad players, will negatively affect almost every game you have. 
---
An unpopular opinion alert, but ESPECIALLY if youre on NA servers. I dont know how other regions play out, but EU ranked players somewhat tend to play the objectives and try, whereas NA is just less competitive and full of dicks. Its just a difference in mentality and playstyles that you can feel after a few games.
---
Contact steam and see if they might give you a refund for the game and then purchase it through Ubisoft directly so it will be their problem if it happens.
---
Good job
---
You too!
---
It's 15 dollars more expensive now than it was before. Fuck Ubisoft.
---
I‚Äôm trash but not toxic, I mostly play casual for fun but would like to dip into rank. My PS id is DaMySt1CaL0n3   (That‚Äôs a zero not an O). Sorry for the letters/numbers, I was in my teens when I made my account name for PS3, so cut me some slack please lol
---
Never once have i had it ‚Äòfine‚Äô :(
---
Hey that‚Äôs not bad. Win a couple more and you‚Äôll be back where you were. Otherwise as far as I‚Äôm concerned you‚Äôve earned your plat charm already so I wouldn‚Äôt worry to much about getting back up there. Keep going at it though, the season is still live so you have 2 weeks or so to climb back up and go further possibly.

Thanks
---
Ok we can play some casual to warm up and than get into some ranked if thats ok with you
---
Sadly none of my friends play this game but I can always make friends while playing :) I'll probably get the game on black friday and check it out. In the meanwhile I can read/watch some guides and some videos of the game, thanks for responding.
---
interesting as it may sound but it may not work in R6S as this would directly buff all defenders when defender already have the advantaged.
---
Try~~hard~~ the all new Alt+F4
---
Uchiha Madara, is that you?
---
Yeah I was thinking "better to start now than never" and maybe in some time this will turn into my favourite game who knows.
---
Just wait for a promo at the beginning of the next season which is soon. Honestly its worth it. i have about eighty hours on the game and its well worth it when you start getting those nasty clips.
---
It happens if someone else in your game unlocks it, I believe
---
I will never understand people who complain about this. If the queue takes more than 2 mins, Restart The Queue. This will fix the issue almost 100% of the time. 
---
If the queue goes beyond like 5 minutes it means that it will actually just never queue you, it‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs taking forever to queue.
---
I wait 15+ minutes regularly, sometimes up to half an hour just to get 0-4ed
---
What platform do you play on? If we have the same one, I'd be down to play with you sometime but I'm not home rn.
---
Yeah I'll probably cop it on black friday and check it out and in the meanwhile watch some videos of the game to get me started
---
He was mute Look at the top of the screen, he died
---
This is a good idea but I feel like the operator would be really situational
---
Because GTA doesn't allow it anymore, it's been almost 2 years
---
Poor Jager :(
---
The hatches are very specific places on maps, whereas ledges like this one on house are just random ledges. If you could get up this ledge, then who knows how many other ledges she could grapple. You can play around her going up through hatches that everyone knows about; you can't play around her going up every ~10 foot ledge on every map, at least not nearly as well
---
Sounded like the explosions lasted longer than one cluster charge idk
---
Damn tried both, but neither resolved the issue. Well I‚Äôve done driver updates for my gpu at least if that‚Äôs what you mean. I‚Äôve got a 1070 strix and a I7-7700k
---
but we all know ubi well enough that they wouldn‚Äôt try for that much of a cash grab
---
I cant login either
---
Meanwhile, the've removed 165 MMR on my account. :-(
---
Lion is a really good operator when playing with a full squad where there‚Äôs communication but Zofia is more of a one man army with the ability to self Rez when knocked or fire concussion mines or the ability to launch impact grenades to soft breach and she has a 30 round mag (+1 in the chamber) good fire rate minimal recoil and 48 damage! Or if you‚Äôre more of an LMG person her LMG-E has a 150 round mag with almost 0 recoil at all and decent fire rate
---
He is literally the most useless op next to tachanka
---
DO NOT APPROACH THE HELICOPTER
---
i agree thisbis shit
---
Lots of run outs, congested areas, just much worse overall. If you‚Äôve ever played a ranked game on it, it just doesn‚Äôt flow as well as other maps. Also it‚Äôs almost the exact same play every time which is true with a lot of maps but I would say pretty bad on skyscraper.
---
you‚Äôre on a laptop :)
---
I dont use it:/
---
Outstanding move
---
yes, you are missing alot of toxic assholes that only care about themselves and take any chance to put people down. thats why i stick to casual
---
Well, he‚Äôs slow, his ability is not useful nor strong enough and only situational and his guns are not the best even if they are viable and are guns that we have already seen except the pistol
---
hold up lemme edit it
---
i‚Äôm just saying the development team on this specific game
---
His gadget never sees any real use. It's rare you have to opportunity to use him. I've played about 100 rounds as warden, and out of those, I used his gadget properly maybe 5 times.
---
Don't worry. The balancing team designed it.
---
It his account... you can tell by the end leaderboard the guy is highlighted. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs trying to get at here
---
But i know most of plats in ps4/xbox are MnK
---
strange how fast youre flicking when theres clearly button prompts on your screen.
---
Cav becomes the most useless operator in the game against opponents who drone. If attackers drone her out, it‚Äôs next to impossible for her to do what makes her good (interrogations). Her guns are garbage and can‚Äôt hold up against any attacking guns. If you want to roam, use Jager or Vigil. Both these operators have amazing guns that can hold their own in firefights. Jager provides some of the best utility for his whole team. Vigil can‚Äôt be detected by drones which makes him harder to find while roaming.
---
this isnt pubg dude.
---
Ever hear of a high sensitivity?
---
Lol I shoulda put misleading title instead sorry
---
Point?
---
it‚Äôs so annoying
---
I won‚Äôt be against the suggestion if ubi made the servers RELIABLE
---
;-;  i sowwy
---
Oh. Well what are you trying to portray here? That you can‚Äôt play with your level of players so you have to smurf? Sorry if I came off rude, I‚Äôm just confused
---
He‚Äôs to situational
---
If you dont want the new ops, she can be strong. She is focused heavily on flanking the enemy, a 1v1 gunfight is never in her favor.
---
Umm sooo confused
---
close, its dokkaebi
---
I know I just figured out how to make a smurf account on ps4
---
None of his guns are new. The pistol hes got is from clash.
---
That you did
---
no witching posts are allowed here, just go send it straight to ubisoft
---
His ability his purely for an older meta that had the old OP Glaz and Ying on most attacks which isn't the case anymore.
---
He's also slow for what he's got, faster now but not a 3 speed still. He lacks an ACOG and his main weapon is the MPX which is accurate but weak and fairly slow. His gadget also doesn't really allow him to move that much and still see through smoke, that it can also block flashes really doesn't matter too often outside of Blitz counters or the rarer(now) Ying pick.
---
I know these shitty players make me go to silver 2
---
Really? I'm new to the game and have played about 15 ranked matches with none of them banning her
---
pretend your playing Nokk with permanent ability
---
but it‚Äôs fun as hell
---
We just cant go more than one season where there's no exploit can we?
---
can‚Äôt even play against plat 2s without them using MnK
---
This game is weird but im addicted :(
---
Are you missing the part where I was prone?

Lmao sounds though

Welp they actually could try to implement a new cross save system but you would be forced to choose which account to maintain so you would lose something anyway. They could try to just compare which item you had on each account and then try to merge them but I imagine that would be really difficult and create a lot of bug and an overly complicated system. Am I right u/UbiNoty?

he shot through the glass tho

Yeah, didnt notice guess im just tried

ACOG on the meme cannon and ACOG on one of the best guns in the game are a bit different

Not really sure if this is a joke or not. If not: Do you explain to them why you do it, or just wack 'em? Your teammates might not be in the mood for TKs which may result them abandoning the match, thus putting your team at disadvantage.

What else choices do we have ?
---
High risk High return
---
im not sure what this is? like a butterfly or something?
---
Thank you.
---
thats not how it works. you encounter a cheater in enemy team, cheaters gets banned, his matches gets deleted by ubisoft so your match too. so u get your points back if u lost and if u won that match u lose the gained points. its like u never played that match. if something happens like on post that means a cheater got banned from the previous seasons, thats why your mmr does not change.
---
that's a total no brainer. Couldn't tell you why ubi decided against that
---
That dog on the right looks fucking nuts

Everyone‚Äôs like wow they listened to Bikini for putting an acog in the bosg but people aren‚Äôt celebrating this community achievement

It doesn't even show up in my Uplay library, despite me having played 6 hours on the account.
---
And support says they can't find an instance of me playing it.
---
But my Steam and Uplay account have been linked since 2016, and no one else has ever used my computer to play games. It's literally in my room, no one else lives here that plays games, and no one has touched my computer but me (except my ex gf who also does not play games) since I built it by hand myself.
---
There is a 0% chance that any other Uplay account has ever been active on my computer. There is a 100% chance that there was a bug when initially launching the game that didn't properly activate it onto my Uplay account, and now the support team refuses to help.
---
While I blast you in the fuckole.
---
Honestly don't expect to be insane right off the bat. Take time to find a nice sensitivity and work your aim in. I suggest a dpi of 400 or 800 once you work your way to it. Things will also be a lot more fast paced so be prepared for that
---
*Me in the distance*
---
**Just let J√§ger have Ash‚Äôs G36C it would make more sense plus it‚Äôs rarely used anyway to begin with!**
---
For example when someone is flashed and his hand is in front of his face . If you shoot the hand it will not headshot . But in Shifting Tides . If you shoot the hand in front of the face . It will penetrate your hand and you will get the headshot
---
How is it unexpected? the dude above literally brought up SCP by name

Let's be honest, how op is vigil really gonna be with a 2 shot shotgun
---
Oof

Shooted
---
Atleast this one is a High Risk High Reward
---
I know this Is all a joke and so on but I don't get why people seriously get upset about tjis
---
J√§ger is performing amazingly even without an acog, I don't want to imagine how far he would be of the chart if he gets his acog back
---
I thought you were a Blitz the whole time...

they don't listen to the community, only to Pro Players, which are &lt;0,1% of total playerbase

Give him frags instead of claymores
---
Oh whoops. That sucks.
---
They don't want full auto with acogs on 2 and 3 speed ops, they are just testing semi autos now
---
Dude the m870 is one of the best shotguns in the game and the range is absolutely incredible. Ever since the bosg got the acog, everyone wants there favorite gun to have an acog. Why does the m870 need a magnification site? The bosg and kaids shotgun has acogs because they are SLUG shotguns.
---
reread the post

Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump those up

If turning it off in settings doesn‚Äôt work then I think that may be a problem with either your console or pc

If you gonna give vigil his acog then give wamai his damn acog

I'm sorry I don't understand

Vector ACOG
---
Yeah that's fair I suppose.
---
It does indeed turn off *most* of the music, but just not *all* of it. 
---
I'd wager it's not an issue with the PC since my old one also had this issue, and throughout both times I've reinstalled windows on this PC it's had the issue. It seems like it'd be a different setting.
---
#VECTOR ACOG
---
I think you‚Äôre falling for a meme
---
I actually wanna see if you get there
---
I wouldn‚Äôt want to spend money on the same game again
---
The fuck? A ton of games allow you to do this lmao. It‚Äôs Ubisoft.
---
This is Siege. We shoot bullets from our sights at light speed with no mass. Using a zoomed optic to decrease spread isn‚Äôt the most unrealistic thing.
---
It would be a perfect castle buff.
---
Allows defenders to go in and out, open and close sightlines, etc.
---
I played in newcomer till I couldn't and by then I had a few friends to play with in casual. All I got is, go at your own pace
---
Wait he didn't actually get an ACOG did he?
---
Cod uses aim assist. R6 doesn't
---
that reminds me of the LBG from monster hunter
---
He‚Äôs just mad because no wants FO-12 Shotty that‚Äôs why
---
Honestly I hope it becomes a thing, doesn't the console version use Uplay anyway?
---
If Epic Games can do it, so can Ubisoft.
---
Its comical that the P90 has less damage than the makarov.
---
Also that suppressors reduce damage, are we all using PBS1s or something?
---
Jojo acog
---
Yeah no, Epic games managed it no problem.
---
As much as I hate Epic with a passion, this is the one thing where I will praise them for.

Being level 250+, it's very hard to find more "balanced" and fun games in casual, even if I queue with friends that just joined the game, it's really sad.
---
It's either 5 stacks or a team with a hacker and they refuse to kick him...
---
What you mean?
---
Guessing because he had 2 less deaths than you?
---
Anyways I started blasting.
---
Thank god we got that little hide and seek game mode tho!
---
All games made by Hi Rez. 
---
Destiny 2.
---
And those are just off the top of my head lol.
---
I have spoken directly to Ubi and Digital Extremes(the people that make Warframe) and both of them have given me this same response. What does Ubi stand to gain to leave you on a console you dont enjoy?
---
Actually, I have more kills and less deaths
---
Sorry, misread the table lol
---
Original video?
---
Neither is the BOSG tho. So aren't they still the same idea.

Doc gets 75 go if he gets himself up. You just hit him once with a suppressed pistol which is not enough damage.

Honest question :

Do you want to let the people abuse the matchmaking and let diamond players play with copper players just because you want to play with your friend ?

This exact thing happend to me when i needed heal from my lvl 10 friend
---
Do you play on PC, Xbox or PS4?
---
Absolut prophet
---

---
doesnt work for gta5 anymore lol
---
Ofc not. I think the cap is an incentive for me to rank up more than anything. Get good to play with the boys
---
Thats gridlock
---
Great stuff
---
You've earned my respect . the question was asked to OP as well
---
Be wary. This is close to being against the rules.
---
u like unfair games?
---
You could find a sensitivity best suited for you, changing DPI and in game sliders to see what‚Äôs perfect for you; just make sure to record your current settings or numbers so that if you can‚Äôt get used to the new sensitivity you can easily switch back. 
---
It might be that you‚Äôve already found the best sensitivity for you, which is great. It‚Äôs just working on your aim now. Choose the operators you use the most and your preferred guns to use them with. Just into TH or a custom match and test their recoil, effectively allows you to better understand your gun and results in you knowing (in a gun fight) where to aim and controlling your recoil. As it plays a big part in gunfights.
---
I‚Äôd also say shoot from the hip before aiming when you‚Äôre in a fight, at least when you can see all of your enemy at close range. As for long range, well... that can go both ways üòÇ
---
I‚Äôm hoping at least one thing here helped you, maybe not since you probably know so much more about the game than I do. Anyways, good luck bud!
---
thunt thats all
---
I think this would actually be a decent buff for bandit, his bio talks about just how crude his gadget is. Make it even crude by including duct tape
---
ok boomer
---
Get out of bronze then. If anything the MMR cap is too small. I dont wanna end up in whats basically a 4v5 because some guy brought his silver friend along to a plat game
---
same...
---
ubishit don't care about us :(

Maverick is one of the best ops in the entire game, and especially for solo play. He's a good fragger with his beat M4, he's a 3-speed, and his blowtorch is a multi-tool. He's a soft/hard breacher, anti barb/shield, anti Maestro, Thatcher junior, and stealthy.
---
Nokk isn't going to be good unless she gets better guns. The only good thing about her is the invisibility to cameras, but the silent-step is redundant considering she's a 2 speed and still makes just as much noise as a 3 speed crouch walking.

german man have no zoom scope xd
---
Lol what. Vigils ability is really good, it doesnt matter if they know youre there if they dont know exactly where. He definitely makes people think twice about entering rooms he's in (can cause them to take even unsafer routes) which is what he's supposed to be accomplishing as a roamer- wasting time.
---
Also the K1A is way probably one of the best SMGs, the BOSG is pretty mediocre honestly. Otherwise, it wouldn't have gotten an ACOG at all.
---
Ok if we are talking about this I WANT A BALLISTIC SHIELD ATTACHMENT FOR BLACKBEARDS DEGLE
---
Don't mind my shitternet
---
They come here, when they know they are not pure
---
Imagine needing to cheat in order to be good
---
They wont. As Long as ubi is getting that cash from all the Nike yo codplayers they wont
---
i think it was the magnet exploding. Even flashbangs do damage that way. (at least I think so)
---
A third party device to give you an advantage over other players. Where else have I seen that concept before...
---
It's also against Ubi's code of conduct iirc.
---
CoconutBrah has good hiding spot and camera placement guides and VarsityGaming I think has some guides on maps as well.
---
No, i dont think i will
---
high ping
---
that would probably make it more unbalanced tbh.
---
Well that‚Äôs probably why my thoughts aren‚Äôt high of him. I‚Äôm a defender. I defend the objective. I rarely ever roam, unless it‚Äôs a specific part of the map

I was asking what he meant. And since it was a question it was preeetttyyy obvious i didn't have any facts "right"

Gridlock

This are the ones I mostly play as
---
It's not the operators that are good or not. It's you.
---
Almost every op from year 2 is very good, Ela, Zofia, Vigil, Mira, Lesion, Jackal, also Dokk and Ying are good but harder to use.
---
From year 3 there are Alibi, Finka, Maverick, Nomad, Kaid, Lion, Maestro and Clash (I've put them in order of difficulty, from the easiest to the hardest).
---
From year 4 Mozzie and Goyo are pretty easy to use, the others are quite situational and hard to master properly.
---
My idea for scorpion is: capacity 40&gt;30, more vertical, much less horizontal like its stable not random
---
comedy btw

I get where you're coming from, but in the case of the F2 the sight is smaller, and even if part of the sight is blocked by the barrel, you can still see fine through it and around it. But mostly this change should be for defender guns, given the fact that most player use acogs on attack (even if i do personally use holo a lot of the time), and because on pretty much all defender weapons other than the tcsg , bosg, mp5, P90, and Alda,you can't use acogs on defense, thus literally making the choice between only 2 (out of the 3 that are in the game and that should be used) of the available sights.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a TK

Too far, mate. I tried EU. Ping goes crazy. Cause I'm in seas.

It improves by itself I guess. Are there any exercises for improving game sense?

Also that was the wrong person whom you were accusing of shooting a freindly, they are not OP

I bought the elite skin for valk and switched to PC not so long after that and it kind of sucks because i wasted 20 dollars
---
Perfect. Thanks.
---
Where do people go who abandon ranked matches and use that skin
---
You running to Maestro like: I DID IT!!!!
---
A story they had to rewrite to make the skin have any sense. They can rewrite any story they want and people will always go "it makes sense from his bio". Whatever happened with operators being just people with guns and gadgets? Every bio has to be bloated and have as many unnecessary details as possible. Smoke's skin is a 38 year old's voice in a 20 year old's body.
---
*Realism issue*, so not a big deal

Guns have a barrel so bullets go straight, without it the 12gauge would just explode in every direction like a bad grenade.

They dont, uplay is a program on PC
---
fair enough
---
It's on a 1.5 month rotation, you do know that, right?
---
It's not uncontrollable it just takes practice.
---
How i image this went, is that the defenders reinforced the outer parts and one defender made a hole with his shotgun went out as soon as the round started and reinforced it from the outside. . Then thermite breached the outer parts
---
Bosg acog won't do you and real good. His ol-n-reliable Kia is always going to be better than that zoomed meme cannon.
---
That being said, Vigil as a whole is a SOLID roamer. You HAVE to roam with him because of his gadget. Takes a while to master, as does the smg12, but he's very rewarding.

Hey, u stole my line lol

It came with Y1S1 in the Black Ice Season
---
I know that but why is casual on a map pool rotation ?
---
Rotation in ranked and unranked is natural, but we don't care about it in casual.
---
Now there's unranked, casual is just for fun, it shouldn't be on a rotation.
---
Discovered when it was leaked, actually.
---
And it's highly likely that it is Arsole, what's mentioned on his jacket, cause Arsole *can* be toxic to humans.

You could avoid any gamemode Back Then. by changing your mm prefrences. Little known fact was that it also worked for ranked matches.

Commando 9 irl its an SMG but in the game i think they said:Hmmm this gun its an AR but converted to 9mm its an SMG but lets say this gun its an AR

The mp5 isn't licenced in siege
---
Thx lol
---
It‚Äôs asked at least 4 times a week, the answer is always the same, it‚Äôs easily exploitable.
---
Still don't get why the description "AR platform customized to 9mm". Doesn't that automatically imply that it is an SMG?
---
Kaid's AUG's description says "Assault rifle converted to a 9mm submachine gun.". And his gun's an SMG.
---
If it's for balancing, then that's fine, but if it's unintentional then it should be changed coz as a Mozzie main, a little extra ADS speed won't be bad.  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

I know. I did turned off Hostage after like 50 hours of playing. I always played mostly Bomb. Sometimes I played also Secure, but it was too easy, people treated it like Casual.

Why does blitz have deagle

I'm sure Ubi kept safe the old maps files

Nice case

Ditto, I always found secure so damn boring, just rush site and have a mexican standoff. There was no strategy in it. It's good for lower elo matches where teamwork is next to none and everyone are too dense to change their way of playing, but other than that, Hell to the no.
---
Yes I don‚Äôt play it on my pc because of this reason I only got the game bc it was $7 at the time but only played it a few times
---
Omg
---
So a different fuze?
---
I mean yeah the "can" but 
---
1. It takes data space: what‚Äôs the point in having twice the "same" map when for most case the older one is worse.
---
2. It will be messy: player remember new maps, you will have to remember 4 more maps.
---
I know what you mean
---
This is why they should put back EVERY MAP and give us a 2 likes and 2 dislikes choice about Casual map pool.
---
I mean, it says that it's a "submachine gun in a compact AR package and caliber". So I guess they kept it as an SMG even though it's technically 'converted' and uses an assault rifle caliber.
---
Still, it's better for us that it's not an AR in game. Or it'd have a longer ADS time.
---
Skill and dedication.
---
Exactly. All what happened there was simply a mistake from Finka. When Hostage was on rankeds, everyone knew that you should not thow a grenade into room where hostage is kept. Now that Wamai can literally pull a grenade to the hostage, makes it ridiculously easy for the defenders to win.
---
Critical Hit!
---
Its super effective!
---
you bastard tell me what egg means NOW
---
Wow so classic.
---
i prefer the CZ75 over the SMG12 but yeah
---
One of the worst operators in the game. The changes to the pistol have been good in some ways but have hurt me in others. My trigger finger is much better than most so I‚Äôm able to play her efficiently and get a decent amount of hate messages from platinum and diamond level players
---
Use the sasg-12 my friend
---
All of the ops are good in their own way. There isn‚Äôt one op that is the best. Some are easier to pick up than others however.
---
Everybody gangsta til they plant the defuser

And kapkan is traps are better than lesion because it deals more damage and everyone listen them

yeah but when I win that match i received 3 points..

Thanos?
---
fuze should be 2/2 and have a faster deploy speed and reduced noise for the charge, but have a small AK-12 nerf to compensate
---
glaz will always be either very OP or trash tier, but his current state in the TTS is actually pretty balanced.
---
kapkan is kinda average, but he's not terrible either. he needs some small changes, but I'm not sure what he needs specifically 
---
tachanka is just... bad. hopefully his upcoming rework will make him viable again
---
Its damage decreased, harder to shoot without ads (bullets spread more).
---
is it a carbine then?
---
This is DOPE
---
Is not only the money, is the time, the passion and effort you have spent in years.
---
r/unexpectedbadger
---
Ik what happened to it I‚Äôm a cav main

since it's an AR converted to an SMG, does that make it a carbine or no? gun experts please enlighten me
---
 Thank you!

Damn right +1 updoot
---
Okay fine then, just I imagine OP said Destiny 2 instead or GTA 5. Infact, the destiny 2 one is an even better version since GTA 5 was one way one time, but Destiny 2 let's you merge your accounts (picking one as the primary which does mean loosing one of the two existing accounts) and then jump between any platforms you want at will
---
No I best flair
---
you checked his vibe
---
Kapkan is fine. Leave him alone pls.
---
Nice clip!
---
Just as heads up, though, the extended barrel really doesn't provide any noteworthy benefits, and you'd be better suited using one of the recoil reducing attachments.
---
If you shot it faster it would have died before it blew up that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying

Give me crossfader or give me death &gt;:(

So buying surround headphones is cheating too? And a better TV?

You say it happens, but happens far too often.

I think it was on a coreross (could have been someone else for sure) video like 2 weeks ago. Heard that most ops were gonna be 5,000 less.   I‚Äôm not 100% sure this. Just heard it on a youtubers video
---
It simply isn't cheating. Accept that not everybody needs to use the same input device as you do.
---
No those aren‚Äôt remotely the same thing lmao.
---
You have to buy an adaptor that circumvents how the developers intended the game to be played on console
---
It‚Äôs like buying a cheat on PC and then you saying ‚Äúso buying a better monitor isn‚Äôt cheating but that is?‚Äù

Instead of just claiming that, you would need to explain it. Because I see no difference: It is simply using another input device which is better suited.

You cant shoot it after it blows up..? So he obviously shot it before it did and probably died as a result of some freaky deaky lag

T-hunt, hard, single fire. Headshots only. ( also in options&gt;matchmaking preferences, scroll down to the t-hunt modes and turn off all except t-hunt classic). This gives you map knowledge and also helps you instinctively aim for the head.
---
I unfortunately didn‚Äôt record this because it was my first one and I wasn‚Äôt organized as well as I could‚Äôve been, my next one I‚Äôll make a well made well organized video for it. If you have any questions in the meantime feel free to ask! Sorry about that

You argue about paying money to get an advantage ...
---
No you don't. You can simply buy the official Hori Tac Pro directly from Sony.
---
No. It's like using a controller on PC. Don't try to push a ridiculous narrative because you think everybody not using the same controller as you do is a cheater.
---
While it would be great, there are a two issues:  
---
If you make cosmetics/ops uplay account bound, then the people who paid twice will now be in the "cheated" position as it will now be actual money lost, as opposed to paying once on each platform for the same content.  If they had cosmetics be account-bound from season 1, then there would be less of a problem, but at this point we're halfway into the game's lifespan.  
---
The other issue is just that ubi get more money the way it is now and so have no incentive to change it.  
---
If the change happened now, you'd have a bunch of angry people who ACTUALLY lost so much money on buying cosmetics giving ubi a PR nightmare, losing them both sales and prospective players.
---
I agree.. Ubi broke its rule time to add more acog defenders to the game
---
Or scim ü§î
---
I‚Äôm aware, this was just the easiest example to show you here. 
---
There‚Äôs quotes from the dev team, proleague, and ItsEpi. Do you need every example hand fed to you or are you actually going to look into this yourself?
---
Oh no
---
So you seriously believe mouse and keyboard has no advantage over a controller
---
Yes sir, cyber power makes one and I saw it at pax and you can‚Äôt buy it unless you buy the whole pc with it for like $1600. So I decided to make my own. LCD disassembled and then reassembled and soldered to make it usb powered. Add some bright lights to make it clearer and you‚Äôre good to go.
---
It will most definitely get you banned.
---
Yea I missed a couple shots but still turn on sound a and listen to the shots penetrating.
---
We are currently literally arguing about paying money to get an advantage. Where you say when you buy better headphones which let you locate enemies via sound is fine, but using a different input device better suited for playing a shooter is not.
---
But good to see that you are trying to avoid the topic.
---
Wooooooow MNK on console. What a loser
---
Sound tho
---
I don't get it, it's pretty stupid.
---
What
---
Yup the twich us obvious it's mnk
---
Ah yea sorry bout that
---
I will quote it again:
---
&gt; As long as they do not write it into their code of conduct or terms of service there is no rule against it. 
---
The social media team tells you what you want to hear. But if they are so against it ask yourself: Why did they never write it into the rules?
---
The answer is simply: Because it is not forbidden. They don't care about it. They accept it. They just don't want people to start a shitstorm against Ubi over it.
---
Laser sights.
---
I lost faith in Ubi's ability to have fun after Y3
---
*Hurr Durr* look at me i'm 200iq doc

No, I haven't stated any opinion, nor have you. We've both made fact statements the only difference is mine is true and yours is false. What are you talking about? That was the biggest cop-out I've ever seen result from someone getting proven wrong.

Let's hope op does

Difference being, their guns are good and usable without the acog. The BOSG is a shit gun, even with an acog.

Don't buy fucking skins then.

You just did it again.

Absolutely agree with you chief, every game is a new experience and with so many variables, it never gets old for long.
---
Ok... Anyway like i said before you're not changing my mind ans im not changing yours so have a good day

If I'm not mistaken, it's not possible for them to make console guns have less recoil than the PC guns because they're the same build.

No, its not about changing minds. Your made a false statement, I made a true one, you're wrong. Your statement is based in fiction.

Serious note; its because she originally had a different gun. Her loadout was switched before she came out because they thought she was OP.

there are a lot to tutorials on youtube. im currently planing mine but probaly wount do it since i dont what to buy a new case that has a die pannel with dimtentions where i can get a monitor for.
---
Nah just my janky magnifying set up
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking !
---
No. No he‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a 2 shot slug shotgun with immense recoil. He‚Äôs going to be the same.
---
If we give the C1 an ACOG, we'd have the first automatic sniper rifle in the game!
---
Seriously though, the C1 is pretty much an automatic sniper.
---
Bro are u using m&amp;k be honest
---
Nomad to watch your flanks
---
Bruh, hitboxes are fucked
---
DO YOU WANT TO GO BOWLING?
---
It‚Äôs going to be something... nice castle meme with iq
---
Son, you can‚Äôt give this away. As your father, I‚Äôm gonna need to take this. I need it for... work
---
Can't get kicked from uranked/ranked. Myb he's doing excessive friendly fire
---
Cool, but I feel like yellow should be slightly less
---
Pretty cool, I'm just waiting until someone figures out how to get onto the UFO.
---
Yeah nomad is class too
---
I havent been doing well this season. i normally bounce between gold and plat, last 2 seasons ive been going down
---
Ela and Zofia have been rivals for a bit. they don‚Äôt like each other but not every attacker hates defenders yk:(? ying and echo used to date so !
---
A yes another team of culture
---
Holy shit you sir are a DIY god
---
Im not in their heads I can‚Äôt know why they banned him, the best reason is because he‚Äôs the only real counter to electronics.
---
r/wildlypenis
---
Please refrain from licking the acog, you might smear the lens.
---
Glad you reported him man
---
Good god. What is going on here.
---
I recently built my own PC for the first time. I have 0 background in building electronics yet I was able to follow some tutorials on YT and build the entire thing FROM SCRATCH in a single afternoon. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short.... you can absolutely build it. Let me know if you ever need help, I‚Äôll be more than happy to point you to the YT videos I‚Äôve followed.
---
This is a licensing issue very few games are able to do this and a game as big as Siege will never be able too sadly
---
The best feature of the newest season
---
How much money, I want one
---
Bro that‚Äôs sick!
---
Per shot, not per second.
---
Okay, after I‚Äôm done eating my mac n‚Äô cheese bites and pirating Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, I‚Äôll make this a thing.
---
Everything you said except gauge like nokk. Because then you‚Äôd be able to activate it for a flash, deactivate, and reactivate for multiple flashes, making you essentially immune to flashes at all times
---
Clean
---
It was casual
---
Coming from a pc player. Yes the vigil change is pretty huge. Lots of Spawn peeks especially in villa now. It‚Äôs a pretty huge buff for vigil
---
‚ÄúHehey! Niko! It‚Äôs me Roman! Let‚Äôs go bowling one day yeah?‚Äù
---
Operators don‚Äôt hate each other because of attack/defense, it‚Äôs a simulation they are all in team Rainbow. They each have their disagreements for example doc and lion.
---
And yeah ela and zofia are sisters
---
WHAT THATS COOL AF
---
Damn cool
---
I hope he didn't die
---
I like those colors better than the actual icon, I love it
---
I didn‚Äôt know Parkinson‚Äôs was a thing
---
I think so? I haven't needed to touch those settings.
---
Ok well atleast im a console bot and dont have to worry about that üòÖ
---
Nah I go P90 suppressed with acog and elephant skin. For my boys rook and doc of course
---
Idk about you, but I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable getting on NSFW channels with that thing on
---
And? It‚Äôs better that than being flashed while your glasses aren‚Äôt up. Warden‚Äôs whole thing is countering gadgets that deny him the ability to fight back, so having downtime for his gadget contradicts his design.
---
I had a 3 v 5 and they were absolute sweats and one guy on our team had pretty bad connection so he kept leaving and rejoining. Basically 2 v 5, other team said pay me $20 on PayPal and my team lets you win. I obviously didn‚Äôt do that but it was really bad
---
Hey, Jody here, I‚Äôll take it instead.
---
u/Vredditdownloader
---
What disagreements do doc and lion have?
---
High field of view
---
i believe your pc is getting hacked
---
We call this an Ace
---
Creepio confirmed next op
---
Hereford? Even if it is, there really is no point to banning thatcher unless they go onto that one 1st floor room
---
Or a 5k, but thanks
---
Go to flairs and click edit flairs. Then you type the operator name in between colons. So :Nomad: or maybe :Frost: If you want Chibi do :NomadChibi:
---
*laughs in IBM Personal Home Computer*
---
Thats why you dont run blindly through corners uwu
---
And? Lemme answer. It makes him broken in a sense that no attacker utility can ever stun him. That‚Äôs bad imo. Being able to resist and fight back an all out flashing smoking plant or rush is one thing, being able to waste all attacker utility is another. I don‚Äôt like how it would force attackers to either ban him, pick Montagne for covering plant, or force their way in to kill him. That could potentially make the meta stale
---
I think is that they don‚Äôt agree with each other‚Äôs methods.
---
Bottom left fps counter says pc
---
His elite skin should just be him wearing a mountain costume. Maybe even put some snow on his head and a few climbers.
---
Lol, that's awesome. I've run across a few pros in casual, plenty in ranked. Casual is always a weird place to see them though. I know a lot of the Reciprocity players play casual a lot, especially Laxxing.
---
Nice wallbang though, I'm sure enjoyed that killcam!
---
Oh no... I think you saw u/i_Wana_fuck_twitch
---
If he is on this sub already... who knows when we all will die at his hands.
---
Proud of you but please never abandon a ranked match  it simply destroys the game.
---
Absolute DOPEabi
---
This is the most insane thing I've ever seen I need to do this holy
---
Here is an idea, do something instead of droning... Like play on your phone. If you don't like the drone phase then don't participate in it, even if you drag your team down from a lack of Intel.
---
This clip is the perfect representation for secure area players
---
Wait what, it actually has that range? Does it do any damage if you dont hit the head?
---
Saw a thermite do this earlier to a window. He died almost instantly.
---
Does this go for every op or jus Wamai
---
Yeah I‚Äôve actually ran into Laxxing quite a few times in cas! I‚Äôve also came along DZ a few times and run into maciejay somewhat frequently. Was definitely weird seeing an EG player hanging out in cas though!
---
a Private Military Company based in India named NIGHTHAVEN. the PMC is owned and operated by Kali. Wamai is one of the operatives of the PMC. both of the gadgets and kalis rifle are created and owned by NIGHTHAVEN.
---
holy fuck, do you have an art account for me to follow¬ø
---
Y E S
---
Huh? This particular dance is just for Wamai i guess..
---
Man thats legendary!
---
I'm going to start playing terrorist hunt on the tts so they don't flinch
---
I think I saw a Gridlock doing this if you hold her trax out
---
Doesnt really need a buff, maybe only a slight recoil Reduction
---
i see internet explorer plays rainbow as well.
---
Yeah recoil reduction would be a buff
---
You lagged out. Anyway it doesn't do 99 damage anymore, it's like 65 or something
---
J√§ger:‚ÄùWell I asked for ACOG‚Äù
---
T A C T I C A L   R E A L I S M
---
And also why are you droning for a minute you're wasting WAY to much time
---
It would make the game more boring, as you‚Äôd just be sitting on defenders‚Äô POV doing nothing. It would completely throw off the balance of the game. It would alienate any part of the player base that has been playing more than 5 minutes.
---
Do yourself it
---
That's insane!
---
Spider-Man pointing at other Spider-Man
---
Is it me, or he's moving like Ugandan Knuckles ?
---
++++ Respect
---
This post got removed because it was a meme
---
I love using the shotgun, just blasting people
---
If you killed a PL player, technically you're PL ready, look forward to seeing you on stage.
---
Im up in the trees if you need me (In the trees)
---
You should do this with Tony Stark and slap that puppy into r/Marvel they would love that
---
This is where I will respectfully disagree, and share my view. I don't think that would increase his gadgets usage; rather, I'm pretty sure that would simply make it more powerful. From what I've heard, the main problem is that he never really gets to use his gadget in the first place, therefore it is my belief that adding another flash immunity and increasing its uptime wouldn't solve the problem, because he'd still be using it against the same things. We need to give it another ability to increase his usage, is my claim. 
---
To clarify: not saying you're wrong, just sharing my viewpoint.
---
New or stupid playets
---
Hahahahha
---
Would a more realistic look of the guy be without the beard cuz wouldn‚Äôt that interfere with the seal for the mask?
---
That‚Äôs a good point. It was only a plat lobby nothing interesting.
---
Is prefer 6969
---
Yep I must say the audio is so bad, I legit can‚Äôt hear where ppl are coming from
---
I have a firm belief that everyone is like 5% jager main otherwise he wouldn't have a 90% pick rate in ranked
---
im not even that kind but im feelin good because of all these nice comments. np
---
And you‚Äôre a dokk main wtf, I‚Äôll give it to you
---
He did... I am a homeless follower
---
Make it triple.
---
who
---
They should just give us both. give one the 552s reticle and the other the xps2-2 reticle.
---
We really need better modding in this game anyway.
---
I mean yeah I can't draw a cav with a non consistent angle but that shouldn't matter me being shit at drawing doesn't make him any better
---
Thatcher kinda looks like captain price (aka bravo 6) from cod
---
Niceee
---
If the devs don‚Äôt change it not only will I buy wamai but I‚Äôll buy year 5 season pass as soon as it‚Äôs announced. Pls ubi!
---
thank you. u know whats also amazing? you. and the fact that i cannot fucking sleep and its soon 1am
---
This style looks really good!!
---
I was dying laughing. I don't know how it worked out.
---
I think the next operators should be Gurkhas that would be awesome. They could be in Singaporean army, Indian army or British army again.
---
It‚Äôs a TV in Study Room on Villa
---
Yeah itd be blitz but can shoot back instead of needing to run to you.
---
someone else also commented about this. but i dunno man. i dunno what ubisoft was thinkin. maybe thatcher has his own tricks how he can wear the mask without shaving his beard off
---
They should give a free interrogation for every player who leaves after cav downs them
---
Yeah I can relate
---
As (an) ocean
---
o okay, never played cod but i will.
---
That's true. The issue is, if you have that kind of aim, you're better off with literally any other gun with a higher fire rate. If you can guarantee that one tap, you're better off with more bullets for after that first one if you need em.
---
Why didnt you just run up behind Zofia and punch her. Then go for the interrogation before she has a chance to react
---
Let me guess,F2P?
---
no problemo
---
Bosg acog montage
---
Okay
---
Yes, I can‚Äôt wait...
---
thank you. i bet you look as good as this style
---
Facts
---
Then help support my YouTube lmao
---
Worst one is in Ranked where people will genuinely leave just to protect their K/D. 
---
Personally if you press the option to leave game, you should have a cooldown before you can rejoin it just to force people to stay in the game.
---
So that's why it's not a thing that looks disgusting
---
It's pretty fun, hope you enjoy it!
---
I could hear someone on the catwalk above, thats why i was kinda apprehensive about going for the interrogation
---
Yeah that or maybe their character stays for a while so you can interrogate or kill etc
---
Not to discredit your clutch but the other team was really bad.
---
The fuse was chasing you even though he had a shield, he could‚Äôve just stood still.
---
thx. cod stull gotta wait tho. i have 5+ games waiting for me to finish em
---
Tuxbird uploads like he forgot to pay taxes tho
---
Thanks üòÇüòÇ you too
---
I‚Äôm very disappointed, this is unacceptable... HE DIDN‚ÄôT KILL HIM/HER?!?!?!?!?!?

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros

Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.

Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

Because you have to aim.
