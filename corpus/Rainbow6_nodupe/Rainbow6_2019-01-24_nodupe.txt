this is so awesome thank you for making this

I forgot how terrible the lighting used to be 
---
Yeah, the map situation is another beast.
---

---
The Ranked map pool should also mimic what the pro's play.  There's way too many maps in the Ranked map pool that its very difficult for new players to learn.  Its just an overwhelming amount of information and its stacked so hard against you.  I know players with ~300 hours but still don't know all the map call outs just because there's way too many of them.  I think there's also enough players at this point that we should be allowed to veto maps but one step at a time, I suppose.  At a minimum, we should be allowed to only queue up for the 7 Pro League maps(Bank, Clubhouse, Consulate, Oregon, Border, Coastline, Villa) and in casual, open it up to the other 12 maps.
---
Aww, that's so cute !
---
Honestly if they made it like docs stim pistol but one shot down I would be fine
---
Course he does.
---
I'm not talking about reticles. I'm talking about sight frames. Like the Holo sight has a grey frame and I wanna make it black. 
---
What I hate is that I buy these skins, then can't use them on any new ops. So my skins from Y1 and Y2 are essentially useless...
---
People are cut from a different cloth these days. Everyone has feelings about something said online. Can't imagine what they'd did if someone stepped to them in real life
---
I understand stand they shouldn't but it would be cool to see the ones for the original 20 ops
---
They do ban waves. Just one of those days I guess
---

What do you mean, he put that thermite on a reinforced wall.
---
O M G i finally found someone that share my opinion ! I havent bought a seasonal skin since year 2.. (exept the Christmas 2018 one). There's no drawning anymore like it use to, now its just boring colours with simplle paterns like you said, nothing worth 27500 renown.
---
Fire your Art team and get an other one please.

Oh no baby what is you doin 
---
r/whoosh
---
I think she meeled your hand.
---
Because they only do 10 damage initially and Lesion has to slowly acquire them throughout the course of the match. Lesson's traps have indicators as he is primarily an Intel op, the damage he does is secondary. Kapkan's primary  goal is to deal damage and gathering intel is secondary. Honestly, the only other trap op that (maybe) needs indicators is Ela, and that's only because they've nerfed her smg so much. Glad Reddit doesn't balance the game lmao

Fuck I missed some good skins :(

*I'm making fucKING MAC AND CHEESE, AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME*

I would like both personally. 
---
nice anim but idk about this op chief...
---
That reminds me, I gotta go play Arkham Knight again
---
Or in higher ranks don’t because they’ll expect you to move. 
---
Oh god no he can't hear us he has airpods in oh fuck oh no Thermite stop!
---
Wow, a statute of an amazing player, you can be better than teammates you describe as useless and you can kill the enemy team who are other terrible players. Congrats.
---
Well it is a casual sooo
---
&gt; This is a Ubisoft club badge as a reward for completing all achievements and/or tasks in rainbow 6 siege. 
---
That is wrong. This badge isn't given to you if you complete achievements or tasks. You get ti by unlocking all rewards, as it is stated in the image above.
---
Trust me
---
That termite knows what he's doing.
---
Thanks
---
Why frost, I just use her shotty and stay near a trap with the other 2 in near proximity
---
Kinda looks like Fuze mixed with ela...
---
Kapkans traps basically only come into play below silver level. They are utterly useless and Ela only has 3 mines, so it's not exactly a mystery which one got hit. Not to mention both her and Lesion don't have to put their traps on doors/windows. They are both faster than kapkan too. Pretty much everything about kap sucks right now. They just need to give him an assault rifle or something to make up for his gear being useless for doing damage if that's what you consider his main use. As far as I can tell the only thing he's good for is making the attackers shoot the traps and give up their position.
---
i have no $$$
---
Why the hell do people so proudly maim recruit?
---
It’s nonsensical. 
---
That’s not hostage, there’s no fuze
---
Thicc, (I’m sorry)
---
I can't wait for cav Nerf 
---
Got me there 
---
Lol yeah I noticed that too. Happy sieging m8
---
They're like $6??
---
What I don’t get is how they spend time and money making content just to later remove it, I wish they brought it all back for those who missed them.
---
ah, a fellow chanka main
---
Why not a glock for a secondary? Either 19 or 18c? They’re literally Austrian lol. Great concept though I really like the idea especially with the b&amp;t 
---
"My microphone is stuck in my throat, please send help"
---
A god cannot die
---
I was so confused when it first happened for me earlier today.
---
I truly love the community as well, I loved every time I get team killed, I love being on match point having a random join and just kill everyone as soon as the round starts... love it 
---
It would be cool to have that brought back into the game, but ubi has waaay bigger problems to fix than to do this. 
---
Just made it kinda weird in here 
---
I knew it was Xbox when the drone got destroyed 
---
attach a taser and kill yourself
---
That’s why I don’t play shield fuze if I play fuze at all. The AK-12 with an Acog is very good IMO
---
yup
---
Glock is a bit finicky with their licensing (Smoke's FMG for example) so that's why I didn't include it.
---
But of course G19 would make for a cool secondary.
---
I like kaid, I because if you use the shotgun then people will get launched backwards if they get headshot, try it. 
---
Nice kill glaz 
---
No.
---
My buddy and I were playing I was IQ he was Buck I went to throw a nade and he shot me in the head... My name went off and killed him I got a 72 hour ban
---
I still get asked by randoms regularly how I got Aki no Tsuru. Really happy I shelled out during Red Crow.
---
I have lived in Canada my whole life and trust me yes you can just smoke it outside like a cigarette. You just can’t be a dumbass about it and smoke it in super populated areas, close to doorways, inside of restaurants etc but if you are walking down the street or in a park or even just off to the side you will not be hassled for one millisecond. My comment was more about getting access to it then smoking it. Last year it wasn’t “legal” yet but a traveler could easily locate some if they wanted but I don’t ever recommend that method due to the risks. Last year luckily I know some friends in MTL and was able to get some and trust me if you smoke it discreetly then you will be fine. At the invitationals all I would do is walk down to the corner and light up there and due to the cold not many if any people walked by when we were smoking. Didn’t hassle anyone, no one hassled us, nothing to worry about.

Then you haven't saved up enough for 200 then

Oof
---
Wait WHAT???????
---
Have u seen a real life operator that looks like that ? 
---
Wait... Do you play XBox?
---
Well, the base game ops are still heavily used, so I wouldn't go that far.
---
I'm more of a spray 80 bullets near the enemy team till i hit something kind of guy. The LMG with Acog is just so cash
---
The problem I see with this is that there already is a lot of times spent between rounds and this would just add an extra menu and more wait time just to play the next round. But that being said, a summary of a match like this would work but only once the match is actually completed therefore those that want to see it can and don't have to waste the time of those that don't want to see it
---
Curious do you have an attic as well 
---
It's nice and all, but I don't think this belongs to r6.
---
S4 skin for season pass 
---
Not enough draw to make me want to buy it though though the skin looks cool
---
Melee her shield and she puts it down for a sec shoot her feet and she’s dead 99% of the time she is easy to counter you just have to know how to do it, she is far from broken
---
we get a loud ass noise with lesion traps too.
---
No booli 
---
No argument there, you're righy. I play casual like a deathmatch usually. I just don't have fun playing casual checking every angle, droning everything, running actual strats, etc.. I save that for ranked. Casual is gunskill practice for me personally.

---
I think that's a good idea, can also be usefull for the random op selection, prioritize the favorite op
---
what about canister man ?
---
Not worth it for people like me who currently have maybe 1/3 of the operators but totally useful once you get more.
---
I thought my post was retarded but this is absolutely bullshit. Thats a no from me chap.
---
I would be pissed if someone stole my ace in ranked
---
Look at the titles of some videos, they include some R6 things.
---
Everyday in school I walk around a corner and just see the you’ve been spotted and think shoot it already
---
Jager isn't trap operator
---
Oh what the hell
---
Okay we all know that's a bullshit team to play against. Unless you have a FO-12 than you have a slight chance.
---
Chill dude , no one said it's not nice. But have u peek out your window to see how policeman looks like these days ? 
---
Sure.
---
Casual should have independent matchmaking that does not reset at the start of a new season. It should be a constant session and as you improve so do the opponents you face.  Resetting it at new seasons and content drops is the dumbest thing ever.  New players or returning players join and get stomped by vastly superior opponents.
---
Ranking... Sort it out. It means fuck all copper to gold is one rank and diamond and plat are another. It needs to take into account an individuals ability more then whether it wa just a team win or lose as well.
---
Then a forgive mechanic in matchmaking.
---
Yup, as I said, it all sounds easily doable IRL
---
I played 15 hours of Rainbow this weekend, and when I walked into school and saw a camera my first reaction was to think, “better shoot that out”.
---
And there are actually gameplays, some really cool ones, I got really confused, I also didn't know a better way to show this up.
---
It’s fun and games until your eyelids display “You’ve been spotted.”
---
Make a Reddit post to appeal. I'm not sure how you would go about proving that you haven't but you could try. It's basically your word against theirs
---
It really wouldn't have been though. I know the trick hes talking about, it can be useful but he made it seem like that's how you should always do it, and that's silly. 
---
That right there is a murder closet next to the doors behind the drone.
---
Looks great, but wouldn't fit in site.
---
there's literally a gun that revives you from death
---
I'm sorry but did you just censor the word frick?
---
It doesn't matter who gets kill credit in a team based game, all that matters is all of the enemy was killed and your team won
---
I was 1000 reknown from a red crow one, feelsbadman
---
You've been spotted 20X
---
So where exactly in real life do we have drones with ai that we can just give to soldiers as a single use delivery for paint.  Nowhere because they would be absurdly expensive and absurdly loud and obvious and do essentially nothing.  The fact that you just say yeah this is possible with nothing else belies your ignorance on this.  It's a stupid idea for the videogame and even stupider in reality.
---
You can buy skins for ops u don't own in the shop section
---
Isn't this a Christian subreddit
---
I like the gadget but I’d increase the range a little bit more idk how much tho.  But the operator as a whole seems like a good op to pair with Thatcher. 
---
 Also, it just puts you with random people. Never solo queue
---
I'm sorry, what? Lesion's SMG was so good they had to nerf it a patch ago. No way Frost/Kap have a better gun (even though I love me a Vityaz)
---
Change up the colour to be more unique and then switch out the Fuze face to be a custom design. This icon also captures the essence of the older icons. I suggest adding a darker splash shade to the background for the newer look. Check out u/MarcoPixel's [website] (https://marcopixel.eu/r6-operatoricons/), too. He has all of the new icons in multiple formats.
---
He was getting warmed up so he could continue to be stuck in gold bruh!
---
That makes more sense now
---
This is not a issue that needs fixing. Its a team based game where total kills mean jack at the end of the game. 
---
You play for wins, not kills. 
---
Also you can down a person randomly spraying a wall, using traps while on the other side of the map, kobing a nade, etc.. 
---
The person that goes in and confirms the kill gets the kill, the player that downs a player gets extra points for the kill than the player who kills em for the assist. 
---
my friend would do it on defense with vigil. constantly spammed the ability and he was top of leaderboard before the prep phase ended 😂
---
Blitz doesn’t seem as unbalanced as Monty though. Blitz you can still shoot his arms
---
Best part of playing this game since day one: friends being mad at losing their MVP because you were drone whoring
---
When this happens to me I just search for another ranked game and it puts me back into the match I was booted from. There is no acknowledgement that you will be joining the match it booted you from but just searching for a match again has always put me back. Hopefully they just add an option to reconnect in the future 
---
No i do not believe so or else i would've been kicked out a long fuckin time ago
---
Hopefully nobody is trying to headshot your buddy. Lol 😂 Tell him nice job though. Looks great
---
But does it stop 2 bullets before breaking?
---
Oh my bad
---
But after the glitch i get insta banned. Theres no option to rejoin :(
---
? Chill about what
---
Not seeing something every day =/= not possible
---
Also, where did you read I said it's "nice" or not? Dunno where you're trying to go with this
---
Idk, he said that there’s a nerf coming lol
---
They dont place you with randoms, even on solo queue its placement near your skill but it will consider the avg mmr of the team you'll be joining as well.
---
On the first round a player on the enemy team got banned for being boosted
---
fun fact: all cavi wick moments are actually just john wick playing from different accounts
---
Yeah they changed the point system before I got Echo so I was never able to do that
---
Because this game doesn't revolve around kills, but team play.
---
Remember that confirm kill gets you 50 points but kill assist gives you 75. You are rewarded more points for team play than just playing a colourful COD.
---
That was my very first legendary. And I got it about 6 months before I bought echo. 
---

I didn't have an attitude in that reply I was stating that I don't buy from people I do not know and I am a poor man and was wondering what electronic know-how is

lol ok. got any proof of this?

i very much do where is my R4-C?

But that's impossible on console and almost never happens on PC

No

I did that one time when I used to play COD multiplayer a lot. I saw a plane outside and instantly thought I had to shoot it with a rocket launcher, then realized I did not have a rocket launcher.

when will these reposts end. they clearly aren’t funny and are against the sub rules

It will be revealed at the RainbowSixSiege Invitational as per usual.

sure gimme a sec

I would but then realise it may be holding something dangerous inside that closet....

Incredible how people don't know this exist.

And the installing process feels clunky: sometimes, i look to the particular part of the doorframe, and the option to place EDD just won’t show up.....
---
The only place I’ve been able to change it is through the UPlay app on PC. That works without any issues.
---
Maybe that's what he was trying to say then since he mentioned sneaking in but he formulated it so poorly that I originally had no clue what he was trying to say.
---
see, nobody even fucking gives me a chance. The ban system isn't perfect you know, and why the fuck would i boost to gold?
---
I'm pretty sure that the book came first.
---
You won reddit today

F
---
It's like fighting fire with bigger fire 🔥
---
Ah, I agree then B U G I soft fucked up.
---
No surprise, fukin ubi 
---
Also the M E G A boosted was more of a meme than anything else.
---
I assumed you were boosted from a friend unknowingly the mega part was just a meme tho
---
2/4
---
This is mine now. Here's an upvote 
---
Ya i come across this too but i dont rlly think smurf accounts can be stoped especially on com because i pretty sure that they need to buy another copy of the game but console would also be difficult because what if it was a family console and the person playing signed in on the wrong account accidentally or just spammed the console whit multiple accounts so they could play on all of them not just his main ik it sucks major ass and its the main reason im stuck in copper rn but its just something that happens in competitive games it sucks ass and they stuck up af and annoying af but it just be like that sometimes :/
---
Didn’t even think about that.  I’ll give Alibi a shot.
---
Thanks bud!
---
Rip the Lazer beam
---
yes you can
---
I am also confusion 
---
if its on steam too

Jackel for ATK, or Lesion if you want a defender

You sound like you're 11

When you have to catch DETAILS at 4:00, but a parent at 5:00

my worst loss was a ranked 5v2...

At least they are distracted

Youre like those ceos of bottled water companies that think water isnt a fundamental human right

Go to documents &gt; My games &gt; Rainbow six siege &gt; (some folder with random code) &gt; open gamesettings.ini &gt; scroll all the way down and change "DEFAULT" to whatever data base you play on
---
It’s satisfying bruh... worth the -10
---
They're two different things.
---
That's just how Rainbow is get used to it 
---
Vigil, he has a great gun and had the ability to roam or anchor. His secondary wrapons are the best in the game. If you want an attacking opp go gor zofia she has one of my favourite gadgets and a great AR.
---
Proper response
---
Me irl 
---
THATS REAK HOT
---
I got the same issue.
---
First login and played a few games but the challenge progress bar was loading for ever.
---
Restarted Steam and Uplay and still the same.
---
Lion is underpowerd in my opinion
---
That's right 
---
this angle is as old as the map 
---
oh damn , i didn't know
---
Have you ever used xboxdvr.com
---
That is so meta! shooting the skylight and hitting you somehow... broken af
---
Ok, then.
---
I'll revert to you when this actually gets taken down for being against the sub rules, if it does, that is.
---
See ya around.
---
Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?
---
Of course people want to win in ranked...
---
Most gadgets kill actually, only a few are meant to
---
Seems familiar but then again almost everyone teamkills in casual.

Can you post the link here please.

Battleye is banning people that were bosses by cheaters

watch your mouth, you fucken wanker

no, not very experienced with that interface... why?

This is so new holy fuck

The kill cam is broken not the angle.... Ugh as you see he shot the window as well so he was aiming there... He didn't shoot you thru wall

I actually sued a kid (on behalf of my ISP) (he was 14 at the time) for DDOSing me on Xbox when I played MW2, it was neat since his parents went uncontested. Paid a big fine since they didn't want their kid to go to Juvie.
---
DDOSing is pretty harsh.
---
No probs.

Thanks.

Is that a mf FURRY profile pic?
---
Yup same drives me crazy cuz I'm trying to listen but cant hear jack at the worst possible moments then I lose all sound then it comes back acts normal then next match  it starts acting weird.  Its driving me nuts at this point .
---
oh yeah you’re on to them pal. they keep issues in the game just for fun. and glitches don’t even happen in pro league and i would know because i watch it regularly. 
---
nice witch hunt you got here pal 
---
Holy crap I’m dumb
---
Reddit wont help contact support.
---
In saying that I've heard support wont unban you if you've been queing with a cheater even if you didnt know.
---
Check out the latest TTS patch notes for some good news
---
Must have a bandit
---
Yep.
---
It's hidden.
---
I just told you, they dont fix issues because they dont have to, they would spend money to fix glitches, if the problems are big enough, then they will prioritize that problem, but if it isnt they wont, because they dont have too
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Lmao so since I’m not well-versed on the technical side of the issue I can’t complain about how AIDS it is when I consistently encounter the issue?
---
Makes sense
---
One of these days I'm gonna finish someone off with a Prisma to the face
---
why don’t you try speaking actual english and have something productive to say. enjoy downvotes on both 
---
Its casual. Still shit to get tked, but it happens often in casual 
---
It takes a little bit of practice, but at some point you will be able to controll that swinging shield just like recoil, making it face the enemy the whole time if it's knifed.
---
I can't really tell if the game just bugged or that dude actually kinda knew how to play shields tho.
---
What are ya high on, homie?
---
Ubi can't fix this game completely because with ever update there are new glitches and bugs.
---
Believe me if Ubi won't fix anything for a year, there will be a major backlash.
---
And by using this method it will seem like the community has a lot of influence in the game, even though they will only fix the biggest problems, the one person they have fixing bugs only fixes small ones
---
Er, what? His SMG is great, and waaay better than Frost's
---
Not true I played with a high plat who was a ddosser also... And yes he was good at the game. 
---
Secure is for fragging, IMO.  
---
Plus action is localized in a much smaller area and so it’s easier to figure out where people might be.  I personally don’t like bomb because the combined site area is huge and on attack I never feel the least bit secure in pushing, and then on defense I feel we’re stretched so thin.
---
Lol chill he didn’t say shit lmao 
---
then don’t buy it. you know what you get out of it all the roadmap tells you is the CTUs and which season is a rework or new map. 
---
SURF THAT BANWAVE, MOTHERFATHERS
---
They did nerf it, they made it do 2 less damage. That is literally a nerf
---
Even a neighbor changing their channel to something too close to yours could make a difference.  Wireless sucks for low latency games that use UDP packets.
---
I believe in you
---
ShieldMain-daline
---
invitationalsssss
---
how dull does one have to be to actually believe this. they have TEAMS of developers on patches and TEAMS of developers on new content. you know absolutely nothing about Ubisoft and it’s apparent

Just kidding my guy *finger snap*

I golded that man and would do it again in a heartbeat. He is a true MERICAN hero and he took a bullet for what he believed in!

Where did C9 go?
---
Dayuuum 70% her pick rate is still going up
---
*"But muh Castle is just misunderstood, he's in a good place, you just don't know how to play him"*
---
He's been in the same spot for a ~year's worth of these graphs, he needs a rework. 
---
Your too rich to hear the petty shit. You sound like money moving around. 
---
By that logic Siege would’ve died without operation health.
---
BRAVO!!!!!
---
Magic. Lol idk tbh you can remove the rail on the g36. Hopefully h&amp;k did the same for the weapon. Yo imagine if we had a g11 
---
That would be cool if you didn't repost....

I’m kinda scared tbh

I find it hilarious that Finka is back to being underused yet with a high win rate, just like how she was before frags were added to her kit!

They game probably lost its shit because you wouldn’t RELOAD YOUR DAMN GUN! 
---
It bothers me way more than I'd like that some operators from the same faction are next to each other and some are not..
---
Would be the coolest op in the game
---
Purge
---
Against which rules?
---
I can't find this update anywhere online.
---
Hahahaha lmao
---
:(
---
Can’t believe i missed a ban wave :(
---
I have two friend and dog. 
---
You had a dream
---
I played during theese operations but i never had enough renown to get a skin because i started in velvet shell so i had renown left after buying operators and attachments :(
---
Why nerf Spear? What’s wrong about it?
---
People like this turned this games communityto shit
---
Just leaving this here, kinda self explanatory 
---
It a toxic community, Players target New players as easy targets to be toxic too. When I made my smurf people would talk shit to me of course that didn't last long but heres some advice
---
Tips and advice
---
1. Use some form of communication when playing to help your team. Callouts are key to success in game so having a mic will allow you to help your team.
---
2. Game sense and map knowledge, I recommend playing t-hunt on random maps to learn them this will allow you to also work on your aim and learning your keys.
---
3. Aim and recoil control, gun fights are a critical part of siege so you want to be winning a lot of them. The key to having good recoil and steady aim is a slower than usual dpi and sens. This allows less movement to be picked up when controlling recoil and aiming. You want to be aiming for the head which is  a insta-kill I recommend going through terrorist hunt and just aiming at head level
---
Hope this help you if you have any other questions I would be happy to help.
---
So, you don’t wonder why all those posts are archived?
---
this is actually hilarious, the recoil on does guns are out of this world literally.
---
Calus hates it
---
Someone had to take the donut for this rip that guy :( 
---
On defwnce u should play a rook,and if u own them a echo/maestro is even better.
---
On Attack u can start with a thermite/hibana/thatcher,strong support picks.
---
That would be actually lucky, from my experience

Great first post, awesome ace 👍

I swear half the games I play are this

😂👍
---
I'd love to see an attacker / defender chart for every site on every map. Don't understand why they just release this extremely misleading general one.
---
Of course the consideration should always include how fun/fair it is to face a certain Operator. While Lion is not insanely strong, his gadget has a huge bullshit factor to it in certain situations where it is incredibly frustrating with no counterplay
---
original pic was made by  [u/TemperVOiD](https://www.reddit.com/user/TemperVOiD) TWO YEARS AGO, please ubi :c everyone will like this change (if its optional)
---
sorry, stuck at work today, cant really make a new pic :c
---
He stores things in his rolls of his meatball body
---
It's worse when you tk a friend and some white knight random tks you aswell
---
I am 99% that Cav and MP5 were nerfed for lower ranks, this graph is just for high ranks. I think it's a good thing, personally. Cav is very rarely picked at higher ranks, and Doc/Rook are a staple for aimbros. 
---
1:04 you missed both sides of fireplace
---
She's the only true entry fragger. Introduce another one and I guarantee her pickrate goes down.
---
Of course , but don't forget that aim assistance mod exists and by time they could do it easily while they don't deserve it .
---
Wishlist:
---
- ACR, 880 RPM, 37-39 damage
---
- AEK-971, 900 RPM, 35-38 damage
---
- AN-94, as u said

---
- Mk18, 750-ish RPM, 43-45 damage
---
I generally just want higher RPM guns on Attack.
---
Maestro and alibi, AA12 with shotgun pistol and alibis impacts should do it a bit easier.
---
What? Holding it increases the range for ying? All this time i never knew that
---
no, I was in his game, it was a ranked game
---
Hero !
---
Why would you put a suppressor on glaz though
---
Castle buff will be next!
---
Ash is objectively overpowered. Amazing guns broken hitbox and a useful gadget all make for her to be broken, especially among high levels. This is a fact shown by her pick rate and win rate. Trying to deny that fact is ignorance.
---
Finka is almost always useful (assuming your teammates actually use her ability). 20 extra hp, faster ads time, and less recoil for up to 60 continuous seconds is broken. Not to mention reviving downed teammates. Personal example, but my finka and ash win rate are about .6 points higher than any other operator, despite the fact that I don't play incredibly sweaty.
---
I somewhat agree with your last statement, but I don't think the anomalys of play styles (the pros) should be catered to. There are changes to the game that would affect almost any level of play style, but I don't think lion is one of them. I repeat again, lion is balanced as much as any operator. Having a coordinated team obviously makes him better, but so does every other operator in groups. Fucking hell, tachanka is useful or downright broken in some scenarios, but no one calls him broken. Lion is balanced. His gadget is fucking based around the fear of being a sitting duck or being spotted.
---
The game doesn't even have a color blind setting, don't expect this poor small indie company to be able to make such changes.
---
Are you trying to piss everyone off? This is how you do it.
---
That makes her kinda cute though 
---
I love that Lion is the most busted op thing in the world, yet nobody picks him because if they do, they know the enemies will next round. 
---
Meh
---
Just focus on what they can change: crouch spam lean spam
---
No. They just play without caring about the win making them have mediocre casual wl. You say that they play like they do in ranked, but they don't. I myself have been diamond for quite some time and even if you go into casual, you can't turn of your aim, your reflexes, your movement. You only think less about your choices and mostly don't use a drone.
---
Just because a diamond beats you in casual doesn't mean they are trying hard. That is the bitter truth, some people are just so much better then others that it seems unfair, It happens to everyone, even diamonds, but they just accept that the others are better instead of complaining and blaming the matchmaking.
---
For example, I myself managed to get two rounds against the full team of vitality in ranked, but I've been struggling hard this season so far and am stuck at plat 3.
---
If you never played ranked, how do you want to know how diamonds play ranked? 
---
oof... didnt know that, now that sucks a ton man wtf
---
In my opinion, for attack, I’d use Sledge. He is a great operator, and very simple. All you need to do is press your Primary gadget button and hit a unreinforced (soft) wall to break it. He is also good for destroying barbed wire, and some operators gadgets (even killing people if you want).
---
Feminine hygiene products
---
Damn fair enough nice
---
Still, that’s weird to hear about technical limitations from deva about prisma not be able to copy Alibi’s outfit.
---
I mean, something should be done about it at some point anyway. 
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
Haha, it's funny how people still have hope that ubi will give a shit about things like this. The matchmaking is still in beta after 3 years. If that's not a priority, giving you a black holo is way way down the pipeline. 
---
I play too much csgo......
---
A nice concept could be a good idea but I think it would be essentially useless
---
I think attacking is way easier. Imo... me and my buddy still rocking thermite/thatcher combo
---
I agree, such things are ridiculous for an AAA game. It does not make Alibi any weaker though as long as you stick with the default uniform, but can contribute to her low-ish picrate.
---
Its a Ban Wave called - The Players who cannot play for shit gtfo
---
He probably was gonna waste his breaching round on it like an idiot
---
One time I had a tachanka sneak up on me and knife me. He was quieter than cav. 
---
Mh.. I get bored quickly when playing her :(
---
&gt;How do you justify picking her over bandit, Jäger, ela or even vigil
---
No reason to pick Alibi in team environment, but in solo Q you cannot even trust randoms to create rotation holes between bomb sites. Impact grenades become a huge boon in this regard and only 3 roamers have access to them. 
---
Vigil and Cav are totally selfish and if you want to bring at least some utility on top of impacts the only choice left is Ailibi. Now, Prismas are not that great but not useless either - put it behind barricades, common prefire spots or in tight chokes and you can delay push fro few crucial moments and give your fellow anchors spot marks. 
---
Zofia is definitely a true entry fragger too, her guns and speed is weaker to balance her gadget out
---
Those skins look amazing, not sure what you're talking about.
---
Surely the AFK Echo helped in that regard. 
---
Oh ok
---
I did not, I keep mine at 1300 because that is what is comfortable to me using windows. I just change the in game sens down to play.
---
Ah, not me.
---
I know that feel: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/82srxs/isnt\_it\_a\_bit\_toxic\_too\_double\_rq/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/82srxs/isnt_it_a_bit_toxic_too_double_rq/)
---
She looks awesome and her gadget is very interesting. Wish to see her in game 😎
---
Personally I'd say Valk or Nomad. Valk provides good places to find where the attackers are and you can roam or anchor with Valk. Nomad is good for protecting your back and/or the objective once you are securing.
---
I would leave Kaid, he's pretty average and you already got Bandit and Mute around and Finka's okay but a bit average personally.
---
What if clash was able to extend her shield like monty (while still being vulnerable to close range knife), and in her unextended form, was able to close combat like monty does ? 
---
Thats because clothes aren’t part of the hitbox
---
Very epic
---
she's definitely boring to play without help, just try asking teammates for some traps around your area and watch the helpless enemies struggle
---
I personally really like Finka. U can help your team and the LMG has low recoil and you can easily run it with an ACOG. 
---
True, good point. 
---
Hey we share a cake day!
---
?
---
Guys I can but only cheap operators
---
Yay Jackal looks fly
---
Ha! Who needs the MP5, boring people that's who. I use the P90 and give them the Bullet surgery
---
So you counter throwing by... throwing?
---
But then I'd rather play the guy placing the traps and shoot the attackers as they struggle against clash. 
---
People like him? People that actually play the operator? Go figure. 
---
I mean, what's one more added to so many. :P No issues with them whatsoever, just the meaning of their existence, which essentially means "I clearly didn't read this whole message".
---
a definitely think shields and ying are also broken and unfun. Echo on the other hand is much easier to counter
---
Twitch and Ash there because people like using their guns and they are fun to play, not because they are op. 
---
Also press f for clash
---
Hes to expensive
---
Hes expensive
---
Jager is hairy, hope they will not give him shorts.
---
I was tkd in a ranked for shooting out a door. The craziness is real on siege
---
If people like him then surely they would want him to a useful operator and not a meme BM pick
---
If this counts as a meme, i'll take it down and repost with another name.
---
*RAAAAAAA*
---
LOL played against one of the guys who got banned
---
He also raged at someone insisting that the guy streamsniped him despite the video evidence to the contrary
---
He also used his discord server to initiate  a brigade on a thread about the incident
---
(a bigboy violation of reddit's rules) 
---
I didn’t mean gay as in sexuality 
---
Not to shit down your throat but I'm level 202 with about 13 black ice skins. None of which are pistols. 
---
Must be lucky cause I watched buddy open 80 some packs and he got 1.
---
I will be opening about 120 packs tonight as I finally reach 180k. Wish me luck :)
---
Yes exactly. Duh. Its like you've never played Ranked Solo-Queue before
---
That Thermite who goss around the map and geta interrogated by Cav
---
That Blitz who always crouch walks and never uses their flash
---
That Thatcher who never throws his tennisballs
---
That Rook who forgets to put down their plates
---
They always frusatrate me man.
---
I will but attacker after grinding next 12500 so maybe in July
---
No shade at all but what rank do you play at? 
---
I hate that. I have a friend I play with who does that often. He plays as Fuze, and j let him do his thing. I play as Fuze, and every wall/window I want to cluster charge is getting breached by him.
---
But recruit has no weapon attachments...
---
I hope they don't nerf Alibi because she's next to Caveira.
---
Just why 
---
CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK
---
My biggest hate is playing as a kapkan bandit valk jager etc then a twitch rolls up as you're placing your gadget and zaps you then gets shot. Like are you stupid help your fucking team! Lol 
---
I have no idea why I get tilted by this on the other team ( pisses me off more on my team lol ) but it's the does haha
---
Good luck! I dont mind others telling me about their rewards and all that, it gives me more motivation to play and get those packs!
---
The meme has shifted from taking a useless operator to people finally learning how to use him properly. Some of us actually enjoy playing him. If he didn't get TKed so often (its own meme at this point), you might even encounter him more frequently. 
---
Friend who still had both Echo drones in his pocket during the last 30 seconds of the round when it was 4-4. Hears the enemy plant and only when someone reminds him he deploys his drone, I was just laughing and slamming my head into a wall at the same time. 
---
Yes
---
Clash is trash
---
I have to grind 12500 first
---
Yeah those 75 Points or (potentually) the win..  Hmmm lol 
---
[I still feel bad about this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFw3NkeyU40)
---
Exactly 😂
---
It might create an imbalance of sight usage, most people already use acog, so if you want them to use the new sights there has to either be incentive to why to use these over the more simple straightforward sights that fit roles in game or make sights comparable to/better than acog which then brings about even more balancing issues.
---
Yes for all the benefits you get with it. 10% off anything in Store, renown booster, early ops, increased chance of alpha pack etc. Also it lasts for an entire year so its like $0.30 cents per day. Sponsor a starving child in africa or get that awesome lava skin. 
---
there is a red light on the front of the drone when it’s being used, but i do wish the notification didn’t flash on the screen so much
---
That makes more sense. He's kind of weak in that sense. He just kinda seems like yet another replacement for Thontcher almost.
---
@ 0:10 OH GOD MY EYES.
---
Does anyone else miss the old armour/speed indicator? I like it so much more than what we have now :(
---
+1 for shrezzers
---
Don't feel like it
---
Maverick has a counter: himself. His holes in reinforced wall can hurt the attacking team as much as the defending team.
---
But when you use him correctly the attacking team will be in the advantage mostly.
---
Yo obi add site pick to casual and ban phase to ranked
---
This is the moment he knew , he fucked up
---
This icon looks..inappropriate
---
The dev’s getting the attackers all nice and balanced.
---
Then there’s Clash.
---
he may work in casual, but in ranked you never see him and it’s pretty boring to never see an operator
---
The post is about not caring about stats and punishing the ones that do so if stats dont bother u why be mad if your kd gets lowered because someone accidentally or purposely kills you?
---
Sorry I have a twin, we can be triplets?
---
The hard anchor play-style is going away. I agree. I hate being killed by Mav. But really I just feel like it’s another level of difficulty added., I should be paying more attention to the reinforced walls I’m using for cover. 
---

Bad luck or bad aim
---
She is I believe. I think it was GET that I saw play her a good bit in one of their matches as well. If you can coordinate with your team Finka is a monster. I think I hate her more than Lion now. As the buffs she brings with her nano boost are insane, extra health, 0 recoil to all guns LMGs included, no risk to activating it, and really no downside except some loud noise. She needs a serious rework as well.
---
Actually my average is mid gold, but I do have some pretty shitty games from time to time.

Kaid was murdered.. Only fun pistol in the game.. I mean I’d rather they nerfed all his load out than the pistol..

Did not expect that.

Didn't those games have dogs? I'm sure you've killed an attack dog.

Oh ok, thanks for the answer!

---
I do miss those days. Everyone pushed together and tactically, none of the crouch spamming COD kiddies. Nobody had much map knowledge either and droned a lot.
---
I previously learned how to one hit vault barricades and i’m trying to get my ash main friends to learn how to do it so they can push faster and harder but i’ve never seen anyone get heated at a random person about a barricade lol
---
No thanks. The site being random forces new players to see which spawns are good and which are bad. Ranked isn't a tournement so no need for ban phase.
---
Castle would like to speak with you
---
The only reason i dont use this sight..
---
We are meant to go for headshots in a 1shot headshot game. BB is a fundamentally broken character. His guns aren’t good, and he’s still broken. The deagle has a lot of recoil still. 
---
In the right hands, ie. at Pro level she is still pretty OP, but it isn't that bad as it gives some form of counter to the 8 OP operators that attack has. 
---
Ok thanks
---
I hate her gadget so much. It’s hurt me more than helped me
---
Its removed
---
The cake is a lie! 
---
The game has been out for over 3 years and rank is still in beta, defenders still can't see their spawn location and attackers can't choose their spawn in casual, basically ubisoft take a long time to listen to feedback and sometimes it seems like they don't even respond 
---
Yea twitchs drone in theory is good but with how loud it is plus its only 5 tazers now its usually good to destroy 2gadgets tops before an anchor kills it i think ubisoft needs to pick weither she is frag or support because shes very fragger leaning right now
---
Time playing does to a point invalidate, older players learned how to deal with shit rather than them nerfing 
---
Castle and Tachanka are getting reworked so they're probably not getting an elite skin until that's done. The rest are probably getting theirs during the next year of content. 
---
Nice
---
r/Iknowitsjustmostdontsotheyuse2osandIplayalong
---
on other consoles melee, sprint an leaning is double bound on the sticks, so this could work
---
30 fps i think are more than enough for a portable system like the switch
---
I think it's time to nerf tchanka. 
---
Yep. Fucking lame 
---
instead of being toxic you could suggest buffs for ops AND in fact I did suggest buffs for ops and nerfs are a part of balancing. also don't be toxic spread positivity and seek discussion the siege community is already toxic enough
---
These stats do not reflect how boosted that composition is. I’ve run it before, it works. At platinum I played lion for a few games to see all the fuss, we raped them. As long as you time it for the push properly and drone out, you can know the exact locations of everyone, force them to either stand still and get rushed, or move and get wallbanged. 
---
It’s a no win situation when the EEONED goes off, sure every once and a while you may deny the rush, but it puts odds in the favor of the attackers 
---
Well said
---
*Best*. **Joke**.
---
#EVER

600 r6 credits, and 10 outbreak packs.
---
Pistol was fun but OP, buff the SMG and make it even useable and he will be fine. Or the shotgun, either works. Pistol is good for popping long range headshots but that’s it
---
Wrong lesion is super strong and without an iq has zero counters unless you scan every inch of floor he needs a damage nerf 5dmg a mine and 4per tick 
---
Try tagging Epi on Twitter.
---
Just imagine how metal Monty's elite skin is gonna be.
---
oof
---
Smoke buff really?
---
smokes are a very big part of his loadout imo. smoke off a hallway and scan foot prints is a pretty safe plan usually. 
---
His smokes make him super useful, that would be an incredible nerf. His C7E is already one of the best guns. Jackal needs no buff. 
---
Ash and Twitch don’t need nerfs. The only reason they are picked so much is because they basically don’t need to use their gadgets, just get kills. 
---
*shut your mouth*
---
Reverse spinaroonie. Booker T wants to know your location. 
---
No reason to disagree with you. It is still pretty interesting that for all the talk how broken Lion is Plat/Diamond players using him fail to break average winrate.
---
Too harsh on twitch. With the f2's fire rate 21 bullets is too little.
---
do you play in a coordinated 5stack with a Finka? I noticed it to. even in Plat2 if the finka is a random it could catch you off guard and you end up shooting an enemie's foot or dying to smokes. But if you manage to push coordinated then you win more gunfights than you should
---
motion
---
controls
---
Ayy I also live in Anchorage
---
Ash and Twitch don’t need nerfs. Clash should, under no circumstance, should be melee proof. Finka doesn’t need a buff. Lesions mines are fine.
---
Well, it makes sense for multi visage, since, in my eyes at least, it resembles the interference of Mute's gadget.

It’s like there is a mutual agreement that he shouldn’t be played by anyone

eat a dick cunt

I would say the one who stopped the defuse

Damn, you must’ve taken a while to do this. I feel like doc is in a good place rn. Clash change would be nice. Agree with the rest

How about skined attachments go along with guns skin
---
you don't agree? even with mute getting the smg11 making the shotgun and smg11 combo no longer exclusive to him and with mute having a passive ability where as smoke has to stay alive to get full use of his utility. also with the mp5 getting nerfed the mp5k has an indirect buff but the fmg9 still feels like a bad fun imo.

"trash abilities" mentions twitches drone. That it's self is delusional.
---
Maybe, but the weapon is soooo good currently. It would still have a similar DPS, but it would mean you’d have to definitely hit your shots. 
---
But again, maybe. Something needs to happen, and solely a damage nerf won’t be enough in my opinion. What would you do?
---
good idea 
---
Honestly these are all good changes, Twitch might be a bit overkill but her F2 does need some form of nerf; 33dmg would probably be a better nerf so it takes 1 more bullet to 1 armours to down. 
---
The Clash change would be broken, as she truly just wouldnt be able to be killed. Even at the moment with the melee mechanic she is barely killed. 
---
Well that's skill more of time tho imo. And its hard to tell skill level from reddit. I will concede tho skill usually goes up as time playing increases
---
All this shows is that 2FA did nothing and people who get boosted still don't get punished enough since they carry on doing it.
---
Twitch doesn't need buffing nor nerfing at this point in time.
---
He said in the comments: "as an elite skin", Reddit app is just too awkward to actually reply to comments.
---
Good crouch spams
---
Nah it was about a week ago on Hereford. 
---
i never use the mp5 p90 4 da win
---
I think finka is better for a map like bank or Theme park (people sneak out of nowhere on theme park). Skyscraper needs as many claymore possible so won't say she's a good replacement for Twitch over there. But maybe it comes to personal choices. 
---
Reduce the firerate and maybe reduce the damage drop-off range.
---
What’s your gamer tag ? 
---
 Imagine being a vigil main. Couldn't be me. This post was made by anti vigil gang 
---
You clearly never play blackbeard because his guns are still a large part why hes constantly nerfed because they are extremely strong when you're actually good at him even if you have no shields left.
---
Also if you think we are meant to go for headshots then ops like frost kapkan fuze and lesion completely defeat that idea. It also defeats the purpose of shotguns in the game. And all the grenades and nitro cells. The game is wholly based on skill not who can get more headshots.
---
What annoys me is that they'll look at this graph and apply changes to PC AND Consoles. 
---
Console should be treated separately. For example, Blitz on PC is weak but Blitz on console is catastrophically overpowered. 
---
Yet, they'll still probably buff Blitz regardless. 
---
Usually a sign of a lazy company with Priority of Cost over function. 
---
Totally agree, I enjoy it more when they are the ones on the comments 
---
buff her drone and make it quieter? I usually get 3 or 4 shocks at the gold 1 plat 2/3 level tho
---
Sorry but if you play plat or higher twitch shoots her shock drone once and is killed and the game should only be balanced around plat and higher gameplay 
---
Vigil=Korean batman
---
Maybe I'm just being a salty Cav main, and bitter over the upcoming nerf. As many Ash mains as there are, I want everyone to suffer (evil laugh intensifies)
---
Wtf??

Hello qxsin2000, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajdl7w/join_the_cause/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
***Breach of Rule #10***, namely:
---
###No Memes
---
Memes and Siege assets overlaid on other media are banned. Memes are humorous images, videos, pieces of text, etc., that are copied often with slight variations and spread rapidly by Internet users. If you are unsure if what you are posting is a meme, it likely is.
---
Yeaa no. Map is fine tbh
---
Your recording aint tho, fix that
---
The reason is because ubisoft is just a small indie game company, and even though they're going on year 4 of the game being released they have a \*TON\* of work to do, such as changing the damage slightly on the guns of ops no one really cared about changing in the first place.
---
ranked is still in beta ;) \*dead inside\*
---
\*walks away while spam leaning and crouching\*
---
Would be a funny joke if you hadn't tried to walk through the hole with the torch in your hands.
---
The skin on the far right is gorgeous. I really want it. The current Wind Bastion skins just don't do anything for me.
---
This spawn peek is old like my grandma and it can be counter easily
---
Why the hell would twitch need to be nerfed?  
---
How is Glaz overpowered? He can be annoying if you don't play properly against him, but if you know there's a Glaz, and you see smoke... Maybe avoid it?Even if he tries to push in to site with the smoke, it's generally obvious enough that you can spray through. You can easily bait the smoke and force him to peek you normally, plus he can be run out on. There are some situations where you can be forced to peek the smoke, but generally it requires alot of teamplay and coordination, at which point it's not overpowered... You just got outplayed.
---
Shotguns don’t have headshot multipliers.
---
Thanks. 
---
Doc is interesting. With the damage nerf on the MP5, that may do the trick. Obviously the ACOG plays a huge factor but the heals are not bad at all either. I think the heals play more of a part than people think, as it complements the ACOG aggressive playstyle very well.
---
Buff tachanka for fuck sake
---
Shotguns
---
My friend said shotguns don't have headshot multiplier, is it true?
---
I think differently but that’s ok 👍
---
FK Grapes 
---
I haven’t bought any of the seasonal skins in like a year tbh. And I agree with you, the far right is stunning. 
---
lol why is kaid so low
---
Yeah that could work as well
---
Hmmm... have you tried using a reflex instead?
---
-Ubi Support
---
P.S. That will be $4.99 have a nice day. :)
---
Looks alright except Doc, he seems fine as he is 
---
The reason the MP5 is so good, arguably the best gun on defence, is because it has that ACOG and no recoil. 
---
Both Rook and Doc are picked so you can use the ACOG and play aggressive with them. At high ranks, the ranks that the graph collected its data from, there is almost always an ACOG on defence because it allows you to frag easily. And in ranked, fragging is greatly favoured over using utility etc. 
---
FK Grapes
---
Outbreak packs? Why Outbreak packs?   
---
It is 60 dollars right? I just wasted all of my money on a GTX 1060 and a fan.  
---
I could always grind right? In my opinion and what my stats say I am pretty good.
---
that's a problem imo as this game is revolved around operators with unique abilities and using an operator solely for their gun feels like you're playing the game without PLAYING the game to me at least.
---
This should only lead to increased win delta, shouldn't it? Only the most sweaty players who "have no honour" would abuse him as much as they could. Blackbeard is in a similar boat and his win delta is pretty high. As for fun factor, Rook has the most boring gadget in universe and yet he is played more often.  
---
Lion stats can also have a very different explanation. You mentioned that he is unstoppable with coordinated teams. We assume that at high ratings most players queue in squads, but are they really? Random teams cannot communicate well and fail to utilize Lion to their benefit. Coordinated teams avoid him for the reason you mentioned.
---
I didn't like the concept so i downvoted 
---
If you prefer defending lesion
---
If you prefer attacking zofia 
---
I think this is due to the headshot multiplier for shotgun pellets being super low compared to normal bullets. Maybe the last pellet hitting your enemy was in the head.
---
A high pick rate does not mean that she's OP, and this is coming from someone who mains Thermite.
---
I accidentally shot a guy in the foot when trying to get a drone, he ran off turned around and ran back to obj then kulled me. 
---
Not even just on a whim.
---
Frost!!
---
I never meant to stop being friends I meant stop playing with them they’ll still be my friends in real life maybe I should have made that clearer
---
that doesn't really change the fact it's giving one player (potentially) an advantage that isnt skill at all simply luck or grinding 
---
No you were perfectly clear I'm just saying some people are so dedicated to stopping toxic behaviour they'd probably suggest this, I'm just saying if someone said this they're a dumbass 
---
Really? Clash? Clash is good though.
---
Glaz has a flip-sight. It’s literally the core of his gadget.
---
I understand but currently it’s only one on MnK so I can easily avoid having him on my team in ranked but in future I’m uncertain if more start to switch
---
Who said she needs a nerf? Her gun is one of the best along with her gadget.
---
He's a fag for smurfing but I think it still counts
---
So what prevents them for playing exactly the same with operators like Jackal, IQ, Hibana, Maverick, Nomad, Zofia etc? All these operators have good guns so they should be played by rushers as well. Yet only Ash and Twitch maintain such levels of pickrate and win delta.
---
I'm back hello! Looking pretty damn good! You have just sealed another really big fucking hole in my heart &lt;3
---
You mean the gadget ?
---
*LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED*
---
That's the good shit.
---
Yes and people have said they pick him for his thermal scope not his flip sight
---
Leaves a bad taste that most characters with the highest win delta are always dlc ops.
---
Like i said he is new to the game and he just having fun 
---
Hahaha. They don’t care
---
That’s the biggest issue, most of us have made it to plat with controllers, ones even diamond but the issue lies there don’t want to be one of those shitters on mnk at the top
---
Potentially
---
Prolly
---
Yep. Something tells me it won’t handle all the weight xD.
---
lol lion crouch spam 
---
Thanks for the support Bro
---
that argument, "shes 2 speed", the 3 speed was nerfed bcz crybabes, now they are more like 2 speed, meaning shes 2 speed doesnt say shit.
---
No? Good job using the exploit though.
---
could be extremely helpful in that case
---
guns i want 
---
\-tommy gun (with or without drum mag)
---
\-crossbow with regular bolts (if they do add it just make the fire rate low and the reload long
---
\-uzi (it would be cool if you held it sideways)
---
\-honey badger (most likley coming with austrailian ops next season)
---
\-bolt action rifle (it would be cool obviously it would be on attack and not have acog probably)
---
Hell yeah thats what this game needs, an automatic glock pistol with extendo clip. You should be able to bust it side ways while throwing up your set.
---
He is not way too powerful, he is just powerful. You guys really need to stop bitching about blackbeard, i am pretty sure people like you would still complain if his shield had 1 hp because he can tank 1 bullet... He is fine where he is. I don't even see him played that often anymore.
---
*bolt action
---
the only thing here that matters to me is the ***ass***
---
Report 'em. 
---
feels like it to me 
---
Lion has already been reworked, and they are waiting to release it during invitationals. Calm your tits
---
I keep seeing all of these suggestions for changing the optics. My thing is: why are you trying to fix something that isn’t broken? Each optic has its pros and cons and all are useful. Because of this, it is often a difficult choice on which one to pick. There are certainly much bigger things that need attention in this game and the optics are not one of them.
---
But we also don't need a sight on blackbeard and valkyrie's desert eagle 
---
Needs more jpg
---
Pettiness, trying to stir up a reaction from you, lack of attention to their surroundings.
---
This is probably the best way i can sum it all up
---
Yeah I understand
---
I don’t know about amazing SMG, but he’s certainly better than this graph shows
---
That’s pickrate. It just means the OP is fun to play.
---
Acog revolver
---
I don't team kill for no reason which is pretty rare 
---
this is very good and a cool concept keep it up man
---
Hello Vladimirshootn, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ajee4w/can_we_talk_about_this_annoying_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Sounds like you cursed him out in ching chong....
---
It’s got too big, my diamond mate plays go4s and he’s the only one on his team that’s using a controller. I don’t know if reporting would do shit.
---
 [**u/coreRoss**](https://www.reddit.com/user/coreross)

Blatant ambit, I don't know what these guys are saying, he was tracking you right through the wall and his crosshair was moving up and down with your head
---
Needs more kangaroo...
---
So no one's gonna comment about the Fuze in this clip? 
---
Most likely we will see the new elite skins come out in this order due to previous patterns;
---
Castle
---
Montagne
---
Smoke
---
Buck
---
Bandit
---
Tachanka
---
i think you gave me a stroke
---
Don't talk about weight in front of a women, she can kill you XD
---
Yo if it were a casual. I would have gone for the twitch kill too. Cant pass up moments like those. 
---
Because Twitch has a better gun than all of them, with the highest TTK and DPS out of all of them. And Ash is picked over them because of her combo of speed, good gun, and useful utility that aids in playing aggressive, which none of those others listed have.
---
Hate to break it to you, chief. But youre gonna need a new gpu
---
You do know that they don't schedule matches around their talking? lmfao
---
Im diamond on xbox with controller, people who use mnk are ez
---
telling lies?
---
Real sad boi hours out here :'(
---
Yes they did, in this exact interview. They were asked what the most common defender picks are, and when they heard cav they said oh, clearly your including casual and ranked players, they don't matter. Word for word. Watch the interview. 
---
I feel like it would blend in with the background more, rather than stand out like the current holo does, and I think it's good like that.
---
It is more about what Operator you dont necessarily need. If you can cut one op out then Finka can be a good pic. 
---
No he’s just good. Only the best players can track heads through walls. Git gud noob 
---
I understand that, but there is like a solid half hour between matches. Then they talk about stuff for the majority of that time. They dont have interesting things to say. All I am saying, is that compared to LoL casters and OW casters, these guys are pretty cringe.
---
Pretty sure he can just uninstall the drivers and reinstall old ones.
---
i am its not like we knew about it since almost a month 
---
People don't want to play him because he is boring AF, his ability is literally pressing a button 2 times, each one lasting for 5 seconds. Quite underwhelming in gamemodes other than bomb. Then you are a gadgetless PoS for the rest of the round. The more an OP interacts with his gadgets, the more fun they are. 
---
Finka isnt a must pick. She is a niche pick
---
Not always tho if you manage to get back to site and anchor for a bit you are safe, true you have poshed back a roamer but if you scan mirra its useless IMO. The problem is not in the OP itself its the coordination with him. In pl and high plat you se good use of him. but go to gold and he solo pushes you if you have a decent team mabey you can use him. His AR is top notch no nerf here and taking the smokes is a big no no. Does he have flashes? Cant remember... Mabey if he had flashes his solo pushes would be more effective. That is what i would do to him, but that would mabey make him OP should test this tho.
---
Jackals c7 has wonky recoil now and the alda is god tier wtf
---
In the largest sample size, with her picked in pretty much any situation (70% of games), that is a lot.
---
Everytime I see someone using tachanka and letting it go until click, reminds me of full metal jacket when the guy in the helicopter on the minigun is yelling get some!Get some!
---
Is that supposed to be a Magpul PDR on her back? Good work by the way!
---
I think I saw kix with fake beard once 
---
i bought the game and used mods just to make this video ;-;
---
These Charts are completely useless.
---
Good Player + *Operator* = "*Operator* is good, no problems. Ok maybe a little Buff or Nerf, but not really necessary"
---
Bad Player + *Operator* = "*Operator* is so shit. Its definitely *Operator* and not that i suck"
---
*Operator* = often criticized Operators like Frost, Mute, Castle, Tachanka, Vigil, Fuze, etc.
---
Kd doesn't matter tho so why even care
---
F2 is fine. R4C needs to lose some of it's RoF, a damage nerf won't do anything(Like they did before)
---
That’s my friend.lol
---
a lot of times hes useless in ranked. if you dont have good communication AND teamwork, he is basically useless. not to mention the strat for him even in high gold is 'use one scan at the beginning'(???)
---
In the same way, chanka is pretty balanced right?
---
They've always announced it with the season pass previously.  But year one that was because we didn't even know if there was going to be continued support.  Then last year I think they just wanted to tease Chimera.  But I think it makes more sense to reveal it at the big event and they're switching it up from now on.
---
wait what ?
---
Ectoplasm and Gingerbread have nothing to do with the Season. They are Seasonal Event Skins. 
---
Operation Wind Bastion only has 3 Seasonal Weapon Skins instead of each previous seasons which are released with 4. 
---
It's mostly out of respect, because the second they play lion, ops like BB, shields and global ops are all fair game. Lion especially I don't find fun to play or play against.
---
There's also the fact he's breaching a wall that is basically against the objectives and is a spot the defenders use to rotate around.  
---
Tunnel is easy to breach like this because few people play in tunnel because when it gets breached (it's a when, not if), the defender inside would be at a disadvantage due to not having any real cover.
---
There was also a really good one [posted a couple days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aimgyk/when_someone_asks_you_how_life_is_going/).
---
Tagging u/GauntletPorsche too, in case he hasn't seen it yet.
---
Dude, that was really fucking good 
---
I'd recognize the movement if he did control it, it just jiggled for a half a second before he shield bashed me. In the kill cam he didn't turn either, he just stood there and took it.
---
They were reinforced
---
What's your graphics card and internet speed?
---
So, its me they hate?
---
..You peaked when you shouldn't have peaked, as a result you got shot in the head lol
---
Shes just not a threat to anyone who isn't downed, which makes her kind of boring.  She doesn't really serve any purpose except being a minor inconvenience to attackers, who just nade or melee her. 
---
Well his win delta is -3%. That’s 3x the delta of ash and twitch so I’m not really sure what your point is?
---
Listen buddy you gotta risk it for the biscut
---
ROOK NEEDED THE NERF!
---
Explain what you mean because they physically cannot make your download any different to anyone elses. 
---
What are the specs of the laptop?
---
German
---
I know it doesn't matter. It's more the principle of it. The person who has been killed gets all the negative and (especially on console) nothing seems to happen for the person commiting the TK.
---
*Transcript:*
---
&gt;The “Designer’s Notes” series will provide you with insight into our Balancing team’s thoughts on Operator balancing around the middle of each Season. These will come after we have reviewed the data and feedback from the new Operators, and changes made with the latest Season.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;We utilize data and player feedback to make decisions on adjustments. With that in mind, we wanted to share some of the data they have been looking at for our various Operators. The following charts plot the power (Win Delta) and popularity (Pick Rate) of the Operators on Attack and Defense. The Win Delta is the average win ratio when an Operator is picked minus the average win ratio when an Operator is not picked.
---
&gt; Embedded media: win rate delta vs pick rate -- attackers https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/news/rainbow6/siege-v3/y3s4_attackers_342846.png
---
&gt; Embedded media: win rate delta vs pick rate -- defenders https://ubistatic19-a.akamaihd.net/resource/en-us/game/news/rainbow6/siege-v3/y3s4_defenders_342847.png
---
&gt; #Upcoming Changes
---
&gt;###Caveira
---
&gt; * Decreased damage from 99 to 65
---
&gt; * Damage falloff adjustments to make it more consistent with other pistols
---
&gt; * Magazine size reduced from 15 to 12 bullets
---
&gt; * Increased recoil (will be more challenging to chain shots at long range)
---
&gt; * Increased hip fire spread (reduce the viability of non-ADS spam fire)
---
&gt;We are trying to make her less frustrating to play against and reduce her power level at low to medium levels. Lowering the damage, the number of bullets that need to hit the chest of an enemy to put them in a DBNO state should be the same as before, but we reduce the penalty of being hit by one shot. Thanks to this, we can also normalize the falloff curve to be more consistent with other pistols, which gives Caveira increased ranged and versatility.
---
&gt;With the changes to the recoil and hip-fire, We also want to reinforce the hunter aspect of the character, force her to approach silently to her prey and be precise to guarantee the kill. With this in mind, we have made the aforementioned adjustments to the recoil and hip fire experience.
---
&gt;###Kaid
---
&gt; * ADS speed has been increased by 33%
---
&gt;Kaid is performing below our expectations; we want to take a deep look in the future to make him more attractive for the utility and creativity that he brings to a team. For now, the ADS of the AUG A3 was too slow, closer to an Assault Rifle than an SMG. This change should help him to win more gunfights.
---
&gt;###Rook &amp; Doc
---
&gt; * MP5 maximum damage reduced from 30 to 27
---
&gt;Rook has the highest win delta for the defenders, and Doc is trending the same way, with a win delta that increases Season over Season. We want to slightly reduce their power without changing how it feels to play them.
---
&gt;###Clash
---
&gt; * Changed SPSMG9 fire mode to full-auto
---
&gt; * Removed SPSM9 2-shot burst
---
&gt; * Adapted SPSMG9 recoil to full-auto fire mode
---
&gt; * Increased SPSMG9 total ammunition to 161, from 121
---
&gt; * Increased SPSMG9 damage, from 30 to 33
---
&gt;We are not satisfied with the current state of Clash: she has been underperforming, and the latest updates did not improve that situation.
---
&gt;We believe that she is the Operator that needs quality team support the most, which makes her too weak when there is no backup, especially when outnumbered. By changing the fire mode of the SPSMG9 to full auto and increasing its damage, our goal is to help improve her performance when encountering those kinds of situations. At the same time, these changes come with a new recoil alignment that will bring the SPSMG9 behavior closer to the rest of the machine pistols.
---
&gt;#Current Status
---
&gt;###Lion
---
&gt;Progress is being made on the Lion Rework. We have tested and validated the design changes that we would like to implement, and are in the process of tightening up the parameters, as well as UI and Audio feedback. We will have more information available for you during the Six Invitational!
---
That was some nice editing, nicely done! 
---
1- concussion effects do show in the killcams, flashbangs dont
---
2- concussion effects lower the speed of the player, but valk's speed was not changed
---
3- concussion mines don't have that much range
---
of course and interro is loved throughout the whole community. i watched some of the podcast but not the whole thing so i don’t recall what you are saying but he is sarcastic sometimes so maybe that’s the explanation. there is no way interro blatantly said casual and ranked doesn’t matter to game because that is what 99% of the player base comes from. 
---
Try Disabling Vsync
---
So.. is there no proleauge sets for this season?
---
Yes. 
---
should i return my RTX and get new one?
---
It could also be the CPU and the ram speed / amount. 
---
I have tried that already, I don't have it on to start with
---
He’s just better
---
if ur gonna comment that just get out lmao 
---
Do the black dots next to Ying, Capitao, and Blitz indicate their precise point on the graph?
---
Is whisper mode enabled on your graphics card?
---
Get a gaming router. Then you can do that too!
---
Rank?
---
You can try to define it however you want, it is clear ubisoft counts them as SEASONALS alongside the normal seasonals. They are still giving you 4 seasonal skins, even if they don't entirely relate to said season. Wind Bastion, as I just said, has Gingerbread alongside Baroque Exalted, Terra Cotta, and Painted Floral. This is no different than Outbreak having Ancestral Southwest and Rusty Trigger followed by Retro Steel and Code Red coming in outbreak packs. They clearly count these as seasonals and make sure they are giving us at least 4 per season (not including season pass bonus skins).
---
Could have been an internet thing on your end
---
Damn i wonder what my reaction will be if i had this happen to me. i usually plant and run to hold an angle on the defuser. am i going to hear the sound ? i sure hope i won't find myself in reddit someday 
---
I'll try changing that, how do I find that setting?
---
In that case we used to get 5 Seasonal Weapon skins now we are getting 4.
---
Pro league settings makes the game slightly more realistic compared to default settings, but not a bad idea. It would be pretty interesting seeing 2 types of siege Esports 
---
People meme about "small indie company" all the time in gaming.
---
I saw it more than once daily when I played hearthstone.
---
I hate kix I can’t lie 
---
My thoughts exactly
---
What the fuck
---
Because she’s not good lmao clearly 
---
Get this man a job at oobiisoft
---
He got that pretty soon after launch IIRC...maybe like Season 2?
---
That's a nice gaming chair
---
You damn fools!
---
Were you doing that crouch spam shit every round? I’d probably pay for some hacks to put a bullet in your head to make you stop too.
---
Thank you American university admission officer, very cool
---
What about the Kaid shotgun change for console?
---
Why is there so much shake when you enter the building
---
Ya I see what you mean idk how they would fix this tho because of how r6 works
---
Now, time for frost and alibi...
---
&gt; Spawn peeking is part of the game... Can't always expect to get a clean entry. Approach the obj with caution and kill the spawn peekers. 
---
So this is something shitty now? Toxicity exists in this game sure but spawn peeking isn't one of them. People pointing that out aren't saying "something shitty" to you
---
So Castle........ might need some looking into.
---
I've always thought of a mounted lmg, but it has wheels on the bottom of it like an office chair... So it can actually move around and can go 360 degrees around. It would definitely buff tachanka and make him a bit more interesting without changing the operator completely. 
---
true true. Shields in general many people find them boring to play.
---
I would definitely be interested in more
---
Right and ubi tries to balance that out as well. It’s why they gave finka frag grenades, because they couldn’t buff her, because she was already really strong, but they tried to get people to want to play her more
---
It’s not
---
According to the forums it’s a known issue. Can only hope it’s patched ASAP it’s nearly game breaking when it’s at its worst. 
---
Thanks my duder!
---
You can literally get all of what Rook can do in Maestro and have two camera's that can see through smoke 
---
Rook is just a gun
---
Maverick looks like a boat captain with the white hat. The white scarf looks ridiculous, it should be the same color as his uniform. The other sets look pretty good.
---
My friend started playing with me so we usually do casual cause she doesn't know any of the maps or any call outs. U fortunately when she speaks its like every video where a "gamer gril" talks. If it isn't that it's people who lose there mental in a game mode that doesn't matter. To say the least we are right there with you ranked or nothing, at least people in ranked have a brain and want to play the game. 
---
Dude, capitao? Iq? Even blitz can be a good entry fragger, although he does it differently.
---
They are just as good at entry fragging. They just have different secondary roles as well.
---
Obvi hit his shoulder. Try not flicking around like a maniac, it doesnt help you
---
He'll be more like Jackal
---
I need, but I m from Russia. It may be expensive to send.
---
Thank you I now have a lock screen background 
---
No nobody is gonna play with out an acog 
---
More rare ones do to barrels,but i agree
---
I can do $35

A bolt action sniper has no place in this game. If it can 1 hit to the body it’s op, if it can’t it’s useless
---
This would be an incredibly dumb change unless it was giving the option to have either. Tan eotechs are far better.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
That’s why you boost yourself before you peek and lean+crouch when you get shot at
---
This is why I sort by new.
---
Literally all your top posts are how you stealth defuse. Sorry, but to me it looks like you deranked to Copper on purpose or this is staged.
---
Why are there so many people with the word calf in their gamertag on console?
---
don't they mean Kaid's ADS speed with the AUG was reduced by 33%?   
---
e.g. (fake numbers) it use to take 1 second to ads. now it takes .67 seconds to ads  
---
they wrote "increased ads speed by 33%" which would make his new (fake) ads speed 1.33 seconds.
---
I think deep down he knows it’s terrible but wants people to feel bad so they don’t tell him. Let’s just keep it a secret between us 
---
go check my rank on xbox bib227 i’m gold 2 and these are not staged 
---
Plats and diamonds doesn't play rook all that much. Right now he is a very situational pick. He is very good in some specific situations, but mostly not worth picking (according to plats and diamonds). 
---
Doc is picked a lot and is performing well most times he do get picked, leading to me thinking he is probably more likely to be a problem.
---
1, I was dropping down on a hail mary in the last seconds of the round.
---
2, I got shot from somewhere in that direction and thought somebody was laying prone in the hole in the wall.
---
3, It didn't even register damage on the Doc.
---
4, I would've been dead either way from the Jager anyway.
---
Oh god that headgear is shit. But that skin. Fack. I was waiting for a pro league set for her. Didn’t even know one released. Fml. 
---
Yes you can get it from alpha packs
---
please fix the bug that wont allow us to bind "Q" to both "cycle camera left" and "ping", plz
---
This is the easiest question, make his guns op, make his barricades indestructible, give him nitro, 3 speed
---
My name was something else originally, but if you get reported too many times (angry kids in r6) they change your name to something with calf and a bunch of numbers. I had to pay to change it back too 
---
Ash is straight up a fragger though. Her gadget is inferior to those operator's gadgets. Hibana and Maverick are hard-breachers which are super important. Capitao's darts are really good in bomb and IQ can take a lot of gadgets from above and below (IQ is debatable actually).
---
Hmm Blackbeard looks perfectly balanced /s
---
His barricades  couldn't be destroyed at all
---
It was a lucky ass hip fire, you weren’t aiming for the first shot
---
Y
---
Crouch spamming and macro users are running rampant in the highest ranks and we're worried about the color of the plastic on the holos?
---
Only thing that can break a barricade is a thermite and hibana at the same time 
---
If you are on console this is a knowm issue for almost a year and ubisoft do not care about it...
---
 Literally all your top posts are how you stealth defuse. Sorry, but to me it looks like you deranked to Copper on purpose or this is staged. 
---
There are also 2 legendaries you can get out of alpha packs for the f2
---
Since she does help you win when she does het picked, I would say that it is likely she isn't overpicked. She seems to be picked that much since she will always perform.
---
10\*0=0 IQ
---
A doo rag. 
---
So cringy 
---
I wasn't 100% sure, so I hedged my bets and responded as if you were serious.
---
again, check my rank on xbox bib227 i’m gold 2 
---
My elo can rise and fall 150 in a day.  This is because if I get to play all day (recently I have been)  I will go on a win streak early in the day and a losing streak later in the day. 
---
I think my win steak and lose streak is because of a several different elements. 
---
1. The one or two people I play with in the morning are more at my skill level whereas in the late evenings when I play I am with my friends that are new two the game.
---
2. In the mornings when I play I am at most with two other people which means I am less likely to match against other five stacks. In the evenings when I play I am in a five stack so I often play against other five stacks. 
---
3. Matches feel easier in the morning. I don't know if this is because in the late evenings I am declining in performance after playing all day or if it is because the evenings are more competitive after people are getting off work. 
---
Either way, my W/L is not a result of being boosted by a cheater. How could it be when no one I was playing with was banned by battle eye?
---
Incredible
---
Fuck that’s OP I don’t think I would play the game anymore 
---
Ummmm wtf, his head wasn't even in your crosshair. Wonder what the guy thought when he saw the killcam, I would be furious 
---
Can I join ?
---
Isn’t in the crosshair though?
---
As a mute main and an elite skin owner. He goes unappreciated. This is really fuckin good. Try vigils next 
---
As far as I am aware yes because Sony distributes the codes and typical international boundaries don’t get in the way of online stuff. However, I will look into it a little more in a bit. 
---
Probably didn’t even watch the kill cam tbh there was someone in bunk shooting him 
---
Situational ops will have a high winrate and low pickrate. That's both expected and ok.
---

I am not opposed to this idea, but do we really want Hibana, Maverick and Capitao to become weaker just to nerf Ash? These ops are already not on top of the charts for a long time despite bring strong utility.
---
what? nobody does that with sombra lol
---
*laughs in MP5 magazine*
---
It still implies that at some point it'll be anything but a concept 
---
I dont like that they stick to this color scheme all the time. I know many people like it but its not a good combination for skins imo.
---
**F**
---
Have you seen the recoil on echo's gun? It's easily 2-3x higher than the mp5 
---
This is genius, its a great ability. A great fit for the recruit. A great fit for the in game universe. 
---
I love it
---
Try finding a squad to play with
---
Its a buff not a nerf whoever told you shes gonna be weak is likely ignorant to most of the changes recoil-Nerf Damage Nerf but it doesnt effect her because 65x2 is still a kill range-BUFF ammo-Nerf inside a building she will 2shot kill you from most ranges she can no longer one tap down you because shes 3 feet away 
---
you're a great detective
---
I feel there should be more 34 (and 26) damage guns on def and 52 damage guns on atk (preferably with short dropoff). That would be a big boost of the utility of having 2 armour. Right now, most guns will have same ttk against both 1 and 2 armour.
---
Apparently she needs time afterwards to shout out the intel she extracted . See, the animation is just the intel gather. Ha. 
---
You using mobile? Sounds like a glitch that sometimes occurs on mobile?
---
It means that the next challenge is available soon
---
This may be news to you, but there are a ton of things in Siege that aren't realistic.
---
You have an appropriate name

“We utilize data and player feedback to make decisions on adjustments. With that in mind, we wanted to share some of the data they have been looking at for our various Operators.”
---
It’s been in every update with the graph and the AMAs discuss that it’s not their end all be all of buffs/nerfs. No exaggeration and no contradiction my dude. 
---
They reduced her mag size so she has less ammo
---
Is there any hint of when these changes will go live?
---
What about the hologram being able to look crouching (you gotta throw the gadget while crouching) or laying down (you gotta deploy it while laying down).
---
It would confuse enemies even more, since you might not expect an Alibi holo behind a box crouching, and out of fear you shoot it, revealing you position
---
Shift the traps to be basically the same power wise but with some of the dynamic functionality and maybe some kind of gun buff. Keep her at the same amount of power but up her pick rate by making her more appealing to play w/ more damage or something.
---
How is Ash still not nerfed is beyond my understanding.  
---
Better nerf Cav or Glaz again,they seem to be the problem.
---
no
---
Rip to twitch. More incoming nerfs.
---
What about terrorist hunt?
---
Punisher mechanics, like lion, is ok if they are bad and we can afford to have an operator we don't care about (like how most players ignore castle). It doesn't harm anyone. Having punisher mechanics as a core part of gameplay feels shit.
---
Vaulting? Rappelling?
---
Pretty dissapointing tbh, I might just get clash because she looks good with a hat on and her shield gets a massive 6 on it.
---
Cute how you went out of your way to exclude Outbreak's photo which only shows 2/4 while the other 2 are without a doubt also considered seasonals. Ubisoft has never said that a seasonal skin for a season MUST be related to that season, and it is clear that they are branching out as they have broke this twice. You are applying your OWN definition and expectation to what a "seasonal" means and attempting to push it as fact when Ubisoft is clearly giving us FOUR UNIVERSAL SKINS LIMITED TO THAT SEASON which matches every other season. The fact that you questioned if Skull Rain had 5 seasonals based on a picture that included a skin that wasn't even Universal again further shows you have no clue what you are talking about. Sending me pictures of skins I have in my inventory does nothing to help your case. 
---
Coming from an avid Pokémon player, there was one line that didn’t exist (“It was effective”) and one that could’ve been changed: “not very effective” to “It missed”. Other than that, this was awesome to look at, great job!

What would you do when you really have to scratch your ass so you only have one hand free but then you realize the Mountain Dew next to you is cold and rather tasty so you set down your controller and take a swig while as you stop scratching your butt and smell your hand?
---
Itll probably look like of potatoes running around 
---
We're talking about high tier comp, most people have most OPs.... And if finka was as op as you think, people would have her.
---
She's very good in certain maps, in certain modes. 
---
It’s gonna be 36000 days smh Ubisoft 
---
THROWING A RIPPER....
---
RELOADING MAAATEE!!! 
---
That would require effort and work on ubisofts part.  Aint gonna happen.
---
Finka is only situationally good, not actually good all the time. If you want to win more, pick ash or twitch every attack and jager or doc every def.
---
BRILLIANT
---
I made it orange to match the sunset, I did the same with my dokkaebi wallpaper, but i used pink on her little demon because of the cherry blossoms. :P
---
RTX - Graphics reinvented 
---
I didn't include Chimera because there isn't a picture of all 4 Seasonal Weapon skins together.
---
no, its because i tortured myself because of this :)
---
Oh believe me I go for longer than two hours a day. I can usually get 10k a day if I try really hard and play the whole day. At least that's what I could do on console. I think I might buy the advanced, how much is it?
---
I don't see an announcement anywhere, will there be an AMA with the Balancing Team tomorrow to discuss these changes?
---
Why is that better than basing it on avg mmrs?
---
In place of regular barricades he just has castle barricades. Makes him a hell of a roamer who can just keep falling back and barricading to waste time
---
"I guess I'll die then"
---
Now this is a knife
---
Amazing smg is pushing it, to say the least. He is one of those ops that need coordination and communication to be good. Thus, not very good in ranked, a frequent pick in pro.
---
All I have to say is, enjoy your Frag grenade while it last, I have a feeling it won't last long on her.
---
regardless its worth buying the season pass to get the new operators you. not really a blind dropping when this year will most likely be a big year for bugs and patch fixes as you can tell they're balancing cav to make her more equal and such. i bought the pass when it first got anounced
---
It takes away their skill too. It’s difficult to aim when you’re pressing all those buttons, even if they’re bound to mouse buttons. It has been in the game since the beginning, and it hasn’t really been a problem until very recently when people started talking about it more.
---
I’m not against changing leaning and crouching to have some sort of cooldown at all, because that’d be fine, it’s just not as big of a deal as we make it out to be. 
---
Rook is just a gun nobody picks him for his gadget
---
r/enlightenedcentrism in a gaming sub?
---
It's just the blueprints of the building they downloaded before the mission, so they would be static.
---
Seems like a good idea, but how would this work when you can’t pull down the bipod?
---
Cause it's more likely for the post to be seen if it has a funny meme. I didn't have one directly related unfortunately 
---
Amazing. Why have a rifle when you could have a single fire bullet knife. Melee, so passee, you can stab and shoot in one go. Reloading might be a bit of an issue , but in that case you can throw bullets.
---
17/19
---
Or simply altering the damage reduction of certain armors for example making 2 armors take more bullets than currently. And 3 armors as well. And I’d say also slowing all armor types down would be good
---
Me and my friends play mostly casual with a hint of ranked here and there. From what I see, casual is very toxic and no one cares. From team killing to recruit rushing all the way to just straight up leaving before the game starts is casual in a nutshell 
---
If you like it and you have disposable income then yeah buy what you want dude
---
it slows you down
---
Hmm I wonder why? It is almost like they are saying they can introduce a seasonal later in the season. Reminds me of another season... But you are too ignorant to accept that they give us 4 seasonals a season because of your own definition of a seasonal. 
---
Uplay isn't supposed to work correctly.
---
W o a h
---
I feel like the time you waste looking at map on your phone you could be in a custom game learning it or just playing the game in general imo
---
Didn t see you were a valk main
---
Also the rank points are bugged or they removed showing your rank progress after the game the +2000 is just your current rank
---
I think twice as much
---
Next buff she gets hair
---
Agreed but think of the pun in there. "Welcome"..... welcome mats.... get it..... 
---
It was a joke lol I already knew that it would be too OP that’s why a put the winky face at the end 
---
I don't have much experience with other esports casters as rb6 is really the only pro league I've been into at all. I have a lot of experience with sports casters though, and I still hold that these two do a pretty solid job. I think maybe you just don't like their personalities or something along those lines because objectively they get the job done.
---
Good idea, it gives a map for new players to refer to, but isn't as broken as a heads up display that's always active
---
"Cav rotating to blue stairs."
---
"Where are blue stairs?"
---
*Gets downed, "Where are they?"
---
4 icons appear right in front of her
---
"Oh they're all blue stairs thanks"
---
Team TOXICITY
---
FTFY
---
Yeah I didn't know. I came from csgo after the f2p invasion.
---
There’s something that looks like a bomb behind her tho 
---
Mavrick looks like he made that cape out of a stolen curtain.
---
Why is it always playstation what?
---
aaahh oke, well glad I could help
---
No...a pun would be Blitz asking someone to say cheese.
---
She is getting a little buff. Her weapon is going from a 2-burst to full auto. Also pretty sure her reserve ammo is going up. Not sure bout the clip.
---
Don’t quote me me on this, might be a little off
---
But on another note, these are some cool ideas!!
---
Exactly. People only pick Finka in situations when she is a significant advantage so she wins alot. It makes total sense and is not indication of a problem.
---
Its like bringing in a left handed pitcher to only face left handed batters.

Exactly, so treat ya damn self and drink beer.

michael jackson?
---
I say a good way to make him OP like absolutely broken, is for him to have more castles. Immune to punching from attackers and immune to maverick. Also making his barricades tank up to 2 explosives before being broken. Oh and the ability to not just put it on doors and windows, but to completely seal off a hallway. Now you have a broken defender 
---
I mean, I rarely see Ela mains anymore and when I do, they run the FO-12. The Skorpian is just too easy to beat in a straight gunfight using someone like Thermite even.
---
a nitro cell could possibly help her.
---
She's not really OP. I'd just remove her acog and cement her role as a rush operator.
---
Audio has been in a bad state for years now. Muffled gunshots, footsteps being too quiet or too loud, Thermite chargers making zero noise, Dok calls making zero noise, etc.
---
Crazy considering how important sound is in the game.
---
No you don't. Don't listen to shitty YouTube videos and play the game like a normal person. You can get over 600 renown per win on ranked if you have a renown booster active. If you want to get 12500 renown or 25000 by extracting a hostage go for it.
---
SUB 2 PEWDIEPIE!
---
PlayStation master race

Definitely for casual. Maybe not for ranked and pro league

You're right, it does look like a bomb, I was wondering what that was. Still think this image doesn't belong on this sub, quality aside.
---
how times have changed
---
Support won't help either.
---
Pretty fun to see, honest mistake!
---
Btw it used to go from silver 1 to 4 with 4 being higher but they changed it at some point
---
That knife sound effect got to me for some reason lolol
---
Because the recoil is incredibly high. I switched from Ela during this season because I was tired of her recoil being increased. I mean Ela is still good if you can control the recoil (and I can) but it's easier to use someone else.
---
No, maybe it isnt their fault, but there is nothing going on when they are talking. It is just the camera on them, and they are talking for like 20 minutes straight. No one wants to see or hear that shit. Show a display, have a side TV where they can show and talk about team tactics or specific plays that happened. I dont want to see two guys sitting at a desk talking about a game that just happened for 20 minutes showing the same 5 replays over and over again. The whole production is just bad.
---
I think so it wouldn’t be a first and much of the community is upset so I dont see it getting out of tts in the first place hopefully 
---
As long as iys only "blue prints", and has no markers 
---
Buy what you want, but realize that what you are buying has no actual value and do not expect any kind of compensation if the game ever gives an item away for free, discounts an item, or developers stop supporting the game.
---
Too many people are opposed to a sequel to Siege on the grounds that they spent so much money on this version. It drives me nuts.
---
The reason why you're noticing it more now is that the previous better options have been taken away. People have always lean spammed ("Beaulo peeking"), but the lean used to be slower. Then they made it quicker for everyone and removed drop-shotting, so now people have gotten really good at lean/crouch spamming.
---
As long as there's no penalty in terms of your accuracy or anything when you press those buttons, people will abuse it.
---
Because that's too much work for a small low budget game 
---
I know,,, I just hate when people say “oMg yOur tRy hArDinG iN cAS” 
---
it's his gaming house
---
Idk but they had also yelled at me on defense for being a hacker since I saw lions drone in the prep phase and called it out. Clearly not the brightest tool in the shed 🤷‍♂️
---
If she doesn't get nerfed, very likely so.
---
She has no counters. It's not like a claymore where you can see it. It can be put anywhere a Valk cam can go. Even if you know it's there, you can't destroy it if it's placed half decently. And trust me pros are going to know how to place them.
---
Please.. I have been playing this game for two months now and I still have no idea where I am most of the time
---
This is also high elo. In low elo his win is much higher. He is a great pubstomp operator.
---
Dew.-, the "original name"
---
they could, just implement a way to simply customize the color of the sight, since the tan Holo actually fits with some skins/weapons.
---
no?
---
And he cooked it for too long 
---
theme park is a great map. i hate hereford because it is so badly remade. old hereford was much more fun.
---
Awesome 
---
Your complaint about Ash's "3-speed-ness" is relevant to every 3 speed in the game and consequently irrelevant to a discussion concerning Ash's balance. If you have a problem with tracking 3 speeds you probably ought to invest in a new mouse, monitor, or glasses.
---
The more crutches you have the more it hurts when they get kicked from under yah.
---
Her guns are amazing what are you talking about
---
Bird box?
---
True, on the upside he is getting nerfed as well (albeit a smaller one to reduce peek effectiveness more than anything)
---
And Tower cuz of the one Elevator that gets camped and trapped 
---
why does this never work when I try it
---
yeah man i getcha
---
Dude, I'm italian...
---
Pretty sure the website isn't updated. We are still in breakout according to the roadmap.
---
I have fun on both herefords but in theme park I want to quit instantly (i wont). It is too dark and hard to attack on. And tower was kind of a meme 
---
Broooooo
---
It’s like Pokémon Let’s Go...but better

Fooking laseh soights?

Wow such a self-awareness. Much of arrogance you got there. What a legend!

All I've ever heard them say was f*ck or sh*t
---
I don't think people want another BlackBeard.
---
IQ shotgun when?
---
There were only 20 when the game came out not 25
---
They have a lot of dialogue
---
I don’t mind theme park or Hereford but I see your point about taking them out of ranked. 
---
My man was smited by Ubisoft. 
---
Where is he playing it up? This is *literally the problem with shields*.  The 3rd person rotation is even close to what the blitz sees. 
---
Known bugs. I get I don't have a dedicated soundboard nor do I have some $300 headphones but those should not be necessary for hearing things like footsteps.
---
Yes.
---
I've been repeatedly suffering audio issues around Dokkaebis Mk14 and Mavericks AR 15.50, and couple others, where the gunshots reverb like crazy and sound far away, as well as footstep sound issues
---
This is a lowkey flex
---
Alda is great and the fmg9 is usable. Especially after the secondary nerfs
---
But where is the Lord Tachanka?! Lol jk looks sick though
---
Or learn the maps. 
---
Yea it's a felx
---
Ubi knows everyones locations
---
You did it while crouchong. You have to stand up.
---
Or blue shoes
---
There are multiple floors I maps, how would that work?

It’s like the spy from tf2 where they exist just to annoy rather than actually provide utility

Tf is going on with mutes eye?

Every stopped and wondered... What is going on inside their head?

Usually the pro league uniforms are designed around the ongoing season. It’s more obvious with older pro league uniforms as they had different designs based on season not just flags, but yes seeing vigil’s was released during Grim Sky, it’s probably why he got the union flag.
---
I just dont think they are fit for ranked. Dont quote me on this but coastline is the last fun dlc map they added.
---
i’m on NA 
---
Just show the layer that you're currently on and nei light above or below is shaded different, like dark for below and light for above

Ah the good ol’days

Nothing transfers so youll start clean at level 0 and uplay or steam are the best but either way youll still need a uplay account.
---
20 25 same thing. Don't worry about how that wouldn't even make sense just accept the fact.
---
What?
---
if this ain't me.
---
once killed myself and a teammate with an accidental c4, and hit detonate instead of pick up.
---
🍝 I am sorry sir, forgive me

I knew interro in highschool when his hair was grown out long. Trust me its not how you are picturing it.

They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM.

Doesn’t even use the LMG that was mounted and loaded!!!

Can't wait to see their gold play button unboxing
---
Smoke has good uniforms/head gears, bandit or hibana deserve an elite before him 
---
Castle Harlem Hellfighter!!!
---
What did you just say?
---
Yes! Give him a Harlem Hellfighter skin!
---
The only rework Tachanka needs is wheels on his turret
---
This passes as a joke today, huh? I got old really quick it seems. 
---
I just want the elite animation bruv. Let me and my smoke brothers have a second in the spotlight 
---
I have double the time played as rook as my next closest operator. I can't count the amount of times I wished I had armour, even playing as other 3 armours. Yes, his mp5 is one of the reasons I play him, but his whole kit offers way more than just the gun

The one where she does ash to mouth.

Something that I always notice in new players is that when they are in defense, they never leave the point (base) and they reinforce everything or if it is an offense, they follow each other until they get to the point instead of exploring other entrances. How can they learn the map if they don't explore it? It doesn't matter if they die, that's what R6 is about to learn, I don't want a simple game.
---
I dont know but it is in the patch notes. 
---
Thanks \~ *The enemies*
---
Trust me I don’t disagree but that’s why he won’t get one for a while because of the team liquid head gear or uniform. I’d love a plague doc uniform but it won’t happen 
---
I'm all for making more games like Titanfall 2.
---
Ok
---
I'd argue its more that teams in pro league demonstrate all the time how to use him correctly in his current format, so its easy to see why he isn't a priority.
---
You can zoom in with the torch?
---
Would u stop using ur main if he got that in an update
---
Depends on your play style
---
Maestro is the shit. 10/10 would recommend 
---
Nice.

Not only the devs, but the community as well. Last time I pointed this out I was -100 downvotes. 
---
I most definitely would.
---
Harlem hellfighter would be sick!! But I don’t see it happening more of a 1980/ swat theme to be honest but change my mind. ( we just see lots of WW1/WW2 elites I’d love to see something different)
---
A situational op with that low of a pickrate should have a better win rate, especially considering this is taken from Diamonds and Plats who should have a decent idea on how to use him.

Guess so. [Copied this](https://twitter.com/CursedVideos/status/1047465753203621889) because they're both ultra sad
---
Blackbeard looks so angery.
---
When will the person that got reported get told? I’m sure it won’t be a permaban or much of a ban at all but when do they find out?
---
I'm gonna be real with you chief...  Nobody likes these patch notes except you
---
I couldn’t agree more! But you have to think realistically. While smoke is a big player on defense, he hasn’t been in the Meta. So realistically I’d see a maestro or cav or bandit before him. 
---
Not gonna lie this is PERFECT!
---
Maestro use to be a god with his op hipfire lmg. Dudes still good.
---
we do indeed like that out here
---
Was excited to see Nomad until I realized the skin is for her AK ):
---
My b 
---
They find out if/when it happens. They're not told they've been reported, they just get banned/suspended if Ubi decides to do anything
---
Yeah they have voicelines for a lot of stuff like throwing grenades, seeing a player, losing sight of a player, stuff like that
---
I get the point that the mag capacity was to high with 50 bullets per mag. But ela had those 240 bullets before. And I dont really get it now why they took away those 40 bullets. I mean she does less damage with higher recoil so you need more bullets. And btw Ela is the only operator which I ran out of bullets with more than 5 times. 
---
Thanks my friend ill be sure to make more! Be sure to follow!
---
Soooooo good my dude 👌🏻
---
The trend of new ops being more well rounded made old situational ops look less enticing.
---
Do.... you know what toxic means
---
I’m assuming you mean rooms filled to the brim with C4? If that was the case, I’d be down for this.
---
His issue is the gadget 
---
Maybe only in Terrorist Hunt. Or like others have mentioned, if they ever add a training mode.
---
Agreed, remove Clash and Blitz, and rework Fuze's gadget, take away his shield, and make him a 2 speed. He'd be far better then.
---
*cries in ADS*
---
I entirely agree, this game needs to be slowed down before rushing is the only meta
