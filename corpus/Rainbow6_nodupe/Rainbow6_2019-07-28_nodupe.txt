I've left Newcomer a few months ago and while I dominated in Newcomer, I got spawnpeeked left and right, shit on and whatnot.

Buckle up.

not a cosplay lol

Plz don't bring maverick two

Plz :(

it IS a 3d model my dude ;)

Did you read it? I said that since Im living in Norway I think its weird that the NEU servers have a hinger ping for me than WEU.
---
Where is red meta?
---
Where my Kapkan + Tachanka + Lesion + Mozzie + Echo
---
and
---
Fuze + Glaz + Hibana + Ying + Gridlock?
---
*DETAILS*
---
Is it a bug?
---
That's true, would it be better if it only happens if it's a full squad matchmaking?
---
Your sarcasm would be funnier if it wasn‚Äôt riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes. Try again later.
---
The idea is that it covers too much of the screen in comparison to other weapons. For some people this maybe a problem as it can sometimes be distracting, and will not allow you to see people in front of you to the right hand side of your screen.
---
Thatcher and thermite can break into that, thermite can also be replaced by hibana
---
You could use like crayola markers and color it the correct colors and it‚Äôs a stamp!
---
Link?
---
Yeah. This seems like it would only be hugely useful against teams who barricade everything, and against Castle. But Castle is such a weirdly niche op that I don‚Äôt see it being crazy useful. Like often castles are for cutting distant sight lines anyway so Idk if it would even be great there.
---
Then use the other better weapon

yeah haha has a victory royale so it is a fortnite!!!! Dude, take your pills and go back to bed

Doesnt matter, should‚Äôve been a draw

You didn‚Äôt hit him once

I would say 3 like Doc and make them heal for the same hp as Doc gun and you can overclock your health for a a short time like Doc‚Äôs if you‚Äôre full health

I mean, atleast I have a profile picture.

I'm disappointed you're still breathing.

Fz Retweet, but i‚Äôm bad speaking in english, so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea play together if you wanted that

Not sure why you're being downvoted, this is hilarious. People on this sub must have never watched Spongebob.

I think you just hit him in the shoulder

Fz Retweet, but I‚Äôm bad speaking in english so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea play in a party if u wanted that

I have 750 point and 1.8kd so yes
---
Easy distraction and helps if you‚Äôre going pro or trying as you have to play with pro league settings

I would rather get rid of chalet and skyscraper
---
Oh, no worries. But if you do want to play then I‚Äôm down, just not right now.

A kill under wine barrels on your third day of play? A little bit of spicy in the making??

Little do you know if we just make as many operator ideas as possible and take all the good ones then they have to start taking ideas from the community

Proleague standard is no points, no hit markers(doesnt include the red x for kill markers). It forces you to figure out the situation without a crutch because points give a lot of information. Personally, unless you mainly play tournaments like that, it‚Äôs just a hinderance while playing ranked as you‚Äôre automatically at a disadvantage.
---
I'd say yes to those as well.  Hereford must go first, though.
---
stupid people show

Heartbreaking defeat

Gah damn that's sexily smooth!

Fuck now I want weappn deploy animations at the beginning of rounds similar to picking up weapons for the first time in APEX, etc.

I love how much time you had left yet you still rushed

Oh its beautiful

They don‚Äôt need more nerfs cause otherwise they will only be good as being bullet sponges.
---
The recoil on her AR isn‚Äôt bad and it‚Äôs predictable. Also don‚Äôt forget you can use her gadget to open of holes in floors or ceilings
---
You didn‚Äôt just do that, what a flex
---
I think thats god
---
What changes would you make to them?
---
I love the second weapon idea
---
Yea but look at the score difference
---
Just get rid of all 3, aren't they not in pro league? They shouldn't be giving us pro league settings without taking away the maps that pro league doesn't want to deal with. The maps are literally the only thing they didn't change other than the length of the games.
---
Jesus christ it was a joke bro. Go outside if something silly like that triggered you

Remove threads that bitch about Hereford from the subreddit.

Lmao you're such a fucking 13 year old, no matter how old you actually are. I'll save myself the trouble of remembering you even exist and block you

Russian Badger did this once in one of his vids

Thank the lord

I mean every game with a gas masked character usually has some sort a plague doctor theme or skin for them but not all games have this it‚Äôs just very common
---
Seems kinda op so it would be nice if there was a small noise of the screws/nails in the barricade dropping when he does that. Otherwise, very good idea I would love to see that in game ( I hope it goes in s3/4 of year 4 cuz I got year 4 pass) . Take my upvote.

You even got the kid‚Äôs biking helmet right

This is how you summon a developer. Quick ask for a bug fix.

Happy cake day
---
Docs a good choice, my suggestion is find a squad or friends to play w until you learn the game/get better. Rn the games super toxic you‚Äôll get TKd voted to kick and trash talked to a lot.
---
Quick question. How is this r6 related?
---
Bully
---
Hmmm, no I don't think anyone was accusing me that time :). Just the "wow" from the guy I killed and the LOL's if I remember correctly!
---
This is another just n√∏kk situation just take two defending operators fuze them together and beat them until they separate from there parents and join the attacking side
---
What
---
That‚Äôs a valid point
---
Fuck Joji. He betrayed all of us. I hope he gets what's coming to him.
---
Idk but both of us where lagging
---
We‚Äôre people too
---
If I‚Äôm playing casual I still want to play the game. What‚Äôs even the fun of randomly killing teammates? It just makes the game less enjoyable for everyone else

Do you see people get accused often even when there's practically no evidence

Where'd ya get the body for that FMG9

I personaly haven‚Äôt seen much of it but I don‚Äôt really play as wide a variety of games like I used to. Would you say it‚Äôs so common to the point of being overused though?
---
I don't see anything

How do i fix that one? Has windows just perma-fucked me?

Nah it's just a normal rook

I got this when it was like 1000 renown, I never use it

Yeah I‚Äôm playing newcomer mode ! &amp; casual I got TKd 3 times last night , I get about 3 kills a game so I guess that‚Äôs decent ! I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Cool
---
The pros already have shortened names for almost every room. I‚Äôve already gotten most of them after 250 hours. Most people don‚Äôt have a problem with it either, except for new maps, just pay attention each game and learn something for each one. For example people call the room with barrels in skyscraper ‚Äúbarrels‚Äù (or something of that nature).
---
Oh man. Caveira and Nook always make me scream.

It was a combo of his armor and missed shots

Also, apart from the Doctor theme, what else do Plague Drs and Doc have in common?

Not today ‡≤†_‡≤†

To bad it's going to be banned in ranked

Yeah...I thought so

u/sau-siege
---
I like Joji
---
The Auto-plant needs to be alot longer to be balanced.
---
Imagine being paired up with them
---
One thing about Finka was that Ubi couldn't make her like Doc since Attackers aren't bunched up together and often spreads out. That would have made her inefficient so they gave her a global ability that doesn't give perma health. 
---
However, I can imagine Remedy's power being more efficient than Doc's method since if she dies, she will leave her bag behind.
---
Bruh... You ruined it
---
Do you HATE walls? Do you want to be an unlicensed contractor? Well the ACS12 is for you! Just aim at a wall, and spam right trigger! (Kinda shit at killing tho)

He should've died an honorable death as Filthy Frank.

Instead he became a pussy ass bitch and flaked on all of us. Fuck him.

Yeah the trash talking is so annoying like stfu lol

Can't it be both

OTs-03 black ice here.  I mean plane casual it gets broke out past that not so much
---
The cheater doesn't have to be on your team if you win against a cheater you still lose the points.
---
Well it is if you play a lot of different games but from my view I‚Äôve seen the plague doctor concept used a lot
---
Its called aimbot, and yes its fully possible.
---
The gun itself is far from terrible, 49 damage with 21 bullets in the clip? I compare it to the commando, high recoil high power if you can get your shots off its a 3 bullet kill
---
so we back in the mine
---
If they put that much work in it why would they make it last 2 seconds
---
Outback
---
Got my pickaxe swinging from side to side,
---
Thank you very much! I hope you're having a good day
---
No offence, but how am I supposed to know?
---
Still cheating though
---
Not sure how the shotgun was at fault. His hipfire reticle was way off the frame he fired. The M590 requires 3 pellets to land in order to get the kill, he landed 2. OP missed, plain and simple.
---
You‚Äôre more than welcome. I am. I hope you are too.

Exactly

Thank god it‚Äôs sharpie

Again, not a doctor, just defeats the purpose of him being this.

Banned

Because it's a video game and while they keep things sorta realistic, they also have to balance them to make them enjoyable and fair
---
I have the fucking furry gun for him and i like to just kill people and have them relise i just killed them with it and accuse me of being a furry when im not they get triggered easily but hilarious at the same time.
---
I have an alibi uniform and headgear and tbh in my experience if the prisma placement is good enough, the enemy will shoot it no matter what. I would like to see ubi incorporate this tho and it  would definitely be a bonus in ranked matches.
---
The MW3 version is better imo

put it on the secure container and you can cap without being in the room

for hostage it ~~bites the hostages leg~~ allows you to use your primary while escorting

Aint that difficult to come up with some shit. Not like those modes are balanced anyway, lol.

I recommend kontrol freaks.

Put this on r/wholesomemes and you‚Äôll get a ton of upvotes

It‚Äôs the sad truth
---
I would have no issue if they were using server side anti-cheat software. But giving any program access to scan, and report on your files is just a bad idea. There are good options out there for effective server side anti-cheating engines.
---
Glock doesn‚Äôt notify you about upvotes.
---
You see, when censoring the word, it's best to put the first and last letter (or if it's a two worder the last word like this; s***bag) so I'd appreciate an edit but that's totally up to you. Also, I feel you, man, even though I haven't been in a *siege* situation like that, I have been in other games. Sucks real bad

Just came across a kid, he died in the first round from fuze, screamed f*ck this game, and left. Good times.

Jesus, you have some issues friendo.

Take the ban and get over it.

These toxicity bans have been in place for a long time, this is old news, nobody cares that another toxic player got banned.

He‚Äôs, ok. I roam with him, and I find personally that his guns are good. Once you master the SMG-12 and it‚Äôs recoil it becomes really strong. He takes some getting used to is say, but to be fair he isn‚Äôt very strong. I‚Äôve had quite a few moments where the glasses were very useful and saved my life, but it‚Äôs not always gonna happen. I feel like if they made the seeing through smoke easier to do and made flash resist as a passive ability rather than a active one would help him. Also consider making I‚Äôm a 2-2 operator for more roaming potential
---
Yeah but how is the icon NSFW explain
---
isn‚Äôt that his father

tbh, sometimes its smarter cause it can be harder to hit cav cause of placement or timing

Yeah that‚Äôs fair. Though I kind of just use Mozzie like Valkyrie- setting up cams in obj. All kind of depends on your favored play style.

If you are talkking aboout the flickk too the window behinde him .. if yoou are playing agaiinst people with 20IQ or higher he should have just killed him. Against 5 bots you might need to flick but in a high level situation yoou will not ace this easily

It‚Äôs not me being offended it‚Äôs guidelines most sites with social interactions keep an eye out for. I don‚Äôt make the rules I am just being logical. Read the guidelines

There was someone playing the smoke elite actually.

Holy shit
---
Background info: earlier in the game I was instantly TK‚Äôd by ash as soon as I spawned in. I waited the next round and his friends tried to kill me too, who I ended up killing. I spent the rest of the round running by ash in hopes of jumping into her bullets to get her removed.
---
Check my comment
---
Wait so enemies can kill her and use her medical supplies? that seems like she'd be more of a nuisance to bring if your enemies can heal right up after killing you.
---
This is beautiful | Rook main
---
Yeah, I felt like he would do better as a 2 speed. I've been using he's shotgun and the Smg-12 more recent and I feel like his secondary is good once you get used to it, his pistol is good to use and He's Mpx is good for headshots. I feel like they should adjust his ability where his ability doesn't negate the more he moves and it would be nice if they adjusted his cool down and make it more similar to how they did it for Vigils and Nokks abilities.
---
How did you get the weapon outlines? How did you design the logo? Why am i useless at artsy things?
---
Ya
---
Hmmm. Never thought of using them like that tbh
---
Hahahaha, I always thought the elite thermite look nothing more than the og thermite. I wish elite hibana was a little better, her mvp thing is weird and pointless. The only elite skin that I might get is iq because the mvp thing is pretty cool.

And I though I was toxic.

This is one of the few fan-operators that I see whom I am 100% on-board with putting in the game
---
So you were banned,  boosting, cheating or super toxic. You made the experience bad for others and the ban hammer came down.  Now because you possible broke the terms and conditions of the game your sour? Am I close here?

I like it but those are nailed in. How would a magnet or whatever turn it into, well, that.

Tbh, the way you're responding to comments and acting I'm glad that you're banned and gone from the community. Go play your other FPS games that " aren't going to die nearly as fast as this PC soy garbage dump of a game is." Nobody cares that you're banned, we can see the true toxic player that you are, lmao fuck off.

It was my first legendary too...

There's a few more ill be posting soon:)

That's bm to the max if I've ever seen it.... Funny tho, bravo.

In a game all about landing headshots, you want to shoot as many bullets as fast as possible while still remaining accurate. The M4 is very easily the better gun.

Thanks but just wanna add the memeing capacity of the yeet cannon

Let‚Äôs be honest everyone would draw dicks, that‚Äôs it every round dicks and more dicks...

I got that one too, it‚Äôs prolly one of the worst ones

Oh well, if that‚Äôs the case, don‚Äôt play maverick at all, either okay recruit, shotgun. Or Alibi AA12

Also he‚Äôs asking the wrong people for a refund that he doesn‚Äôt deserve anyway

Toxicity is part of online gaming regardless of platform

Please ubi don‚Äôt nerf it

No no no I didn‚Äôt mean it like that, I love maverick and his abilities

Ugh the aug is the better gun with faster fire rate and better recoil.If kaid has the same gun with a similar model why does he use it like a normal person unlike iq
---
What‚Äôd you use for the
---
I don't even understand what are these helmets for that we are even headshot with just a handgun bullet.
---
I'd say maybe reduce the radius of the rectangle there and if someone is moving within it, they will be highlighted to Lion for as long as they're moving. They'll also get a notification that they got spotted specifically by this drone. I'd give the drone a limited time to use tho.
---
Leave right before the last kill of the game if you are going to win
---
It‚Äôs almost too perfect in my opinion
---
This is especially infuriating on these new "competitive" maps. I know the sites on oregon or coastline, but how the fuck am I suppesed to find them on fortress, outback or villa?

I'd love for them to make this sight, Nomads reflex, and the m249 scope available for all guns (obv the acog would be attack/3 armor only)

I don't mind Fortress too much, but my gawd, I'm so tired of Hereford. Every other fucking match is on the map and it never gets any more fun to play.

I like it

Plague Doctors weren‚Äôt really actual doctors

Very cool

This one is pretty cool, with quite a few things that could be animated I think? like the sun and crows
---
SHOTGUN
---
Were  any doctors at this time actual doctors.  I give them the benefit of the doubt as they stayed behind and risked their lives while the physicians ran away to safer places
---
Terrorist hunt has ps2 ai I hate those random rooms with like 100 c4s
---
I hate when they do the super cool cosmetics for the special packs only. Not many people can justify the money put in for like 1 or 2 really cool items and a bunch that are kinda lame.
---
Oh, well I definitely didn't mean to count KDA towards your rank because then support players would be at a sever disadvantage while vultures would be soaring, like you said. I was thinking more so to mitigate loss of SR based on a lack of teammates or the presence of team killers. For instance, if you have a teammate leave within the first few minutes or so of a match and they don't come back within a certain amount of time it could soften the blow to your SR for losing since you were at a disadvantage due to no fault of your own.
---
I get it would be far too complicated to calculate MR based on individual performance without people taking advantage of it but I feel the least they could do is help soften the blow for leavers/afk players. Roughly half my matches I'm going against people who are partied up meanwhile the people on my team are blowing up friendly gadgets and refusing to reinforce anything or just leave the match at random and never come back. It gets pretty frustrating dropping so much because of this and not just because their team was better. It would just be nice to have even a little bit of a cushion for trolls and/or abandoners.
---
I meant age, like born. It‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôd rather not say.
---
You could easily have them work the same way as intact barricades - it's the strips down the sides that hold a barricade together.
---
I've seen this suggested before and I think the overall consensus was that we don't need another op who prones in a corner somewhere on their  phone all match.
---
Not every1 has access to these mods
---
Basically but it shoot bullet
---
Wait, what? Elaborate, please.
---
How much damage would it do
---
Look more like nokk to me
---
Now THIS is a much needed buff.
---
I think one of them is getting 20 kills with claymore
---
L hallways. As a Mira main I like the map, but L hallways complicate callouts in siege and don't work very well.

My boys ban fucking thermite when we‚Äôre attacking first or someone stupid like bandit

Are you saying you want either team to be able to walk up to a downed enemy and pick them up?

That‚Äôs way too OP, an auto mated turret where you don‚Äôt have to put your self in any risk and can 2-3 shot people

good this meme is fucking trash
---
I see where you're coming from and understand why that objective is sometimes not fun at all to attack die to the limited entry ways but  i wouldnt go as far to say it unbalanced because if your team can coordinate properly you can bait out the enemy team and kill half of them really quickly

oh yes im playing with hipfire since the beginning , but i want the ADS sens + does the aspect ratio and the FOV matters or feel different ?

Love the detail put into this! Looks identical to the one in game.
---
Even worse than IQ's and Ash's elite skins. My condolences go out to all Smoke players that hoped it would be good. Especially when you think about how many good ideas there have been for a Smoke elite.
---
Why is it cringe? What part of this is cringe to you?
---
Sure or just the pre existing reload from empty animations maybe?

Thanks

It could. But it won't. Unless Sony buys Microsoft or the other way around.
---
I think you are mistaking me for Jackal or Echo
---
i agree i almost always have that happening someone sitting on the camera not doing anything and not even moving the camera just like no one is controlling it
---
Magpul FPG, also know as in video games as the FMG-9. It‚Äôs a long discontinued folding glock.
---
Yes they should. And it's pretty dumb they didn't implement it from the start. It's not like R6 has a only small focus on skins.
---
Well either a reasonable placement or 360 movement. We can't have both
---
I'd instabuy her if she got MP5SD
---
fucking love that gun
---
Can you make on for me but it is nomad instead of Echo
---
What bubble???? Explain to me which companies do not do that? Because as far as I know, almost every single company with a game that is on top of the chart such as R6 does that. and we're talking the actual top tier games, not some kind of ring of elysium (that did it anyway but you get my point )
---
Every company that wants to retain its playerbase does it, better or worse, but does roadmap/dev blogs regardless. Its a psychological trick to show that company cares (that one is not a shot towards ubisoft but you get my point )
---
Lesion is great but I think mira black mirror are more effective than lesion gu mines since any defender can see through black mirror and take advantage of it.
---
Thanks mate. I thought they‚Äôd just taken it away completely.
---
Yea I think such as Echo, Valk should get priority with her Valk cams. If I‚Äôm waiting to do a run out. Last thing I want is to have to polite ask my team mates to get the fuck off my camera.

Hey, I was just watching one of his videos. Pretty cool that you were able to meet him in game!

OK link the one you want
---
ban noooerator
---
The problem with N√∏kk is is that people play her like an attacker when you shouldn't really play her like an attacker because of her guns. you need to play cqb battles and pick your fights like you're a defender. N√∏kk is pretty hard to play but in the right hands she can be really good.
---
What huh?! Is this an animation? Or a video from the game?!
---
Why? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to ban someone so they don‚Äôt screw you over?
---
Did you just assume thatchers economic status?
---
i said no operator
---
I really hate how they're balaancing ops around how fucking annoying their sights are to deal with. 
---
why can't they just be preference and balance ops on other less frustrating things?
---
Uhhhhmm he‚Äôs somewhere... :)
---
My old backup INI file says default XFactor is 0.020000, also make sure to not do the edits while the game is open as it won't properly save.
---
is he a magnet?cause thr nitrocell sticked to him after it hit him
---
Ok this is sick
---
I think nomad is cute...
---
Yeah, he's really good. It was, he was great to play a game with.
---
You can't /u/Its_Epi said they tested her with an AR and it was apparently too strong
---
Giving Nokk better guns would make her OP.
---
Black mirrors are meant to scare attackers, obviously
---
Sorry! This was actually the base used for the animation. Real animation is just posted!
---
I closed the game and for some reason it didnt save the multiplier sens , i have solved the problem , and thanks for your time (:
---
Note: I‚Äôm aware the attire doesn‚Äôt exactly scream ‚ÄúUS Marine.‚Äù I‚Äôll most likely be giving Pierce a little redesign in that way. But due to his weapons, I felt that it would fit best for him to be a Marine. 
---
Any other feedback is appreciated!
---
Yes I understood what you said but I still don‚Äôt get the point of not banning anyone.
---
no. operator.
---
so when the needles are aimed inbetween your legs and you move a inch... there goes something
---
Top floor is easy to attack if you have the right team and give callouts 
---
I prefer big maps tbh. Better ability to roam, and most attackers only push from like 2 locations anyway (stairs and basement)
---
She boosts alot more than ‚Äúrecoil‚Äù and ‚Äúreload speed‚Äù. Just wanted to point it out.
---
Really should ban no operator
---
Looks awesome
---
Hmm, I'll give this a try!

Thanks!

Why heal when he can get painted with bullets for you lol

That may be true, but standing on a up turned plug is pretty bad too, if it gets you right in the sole of your foot it's pretty horrendous

Every console has indy games these days. 
---
I used to game on PC and a variety of consoles.  I quit PC gaming years ago and my life is better for it;  No more configuring settings or updating individual hardware pieces.  No more hardware differences/ advantages in matches.  Best of all, no more PC elitists.  Since dropping PC, those people look even more silly now with all that "master race" garbage
---
Just games played the moment they're installed with no extra work or troubleshooting, on the same hardware as everyone else (relatively, PS4 Pro and Xbox One X kinked that a smidge).  Plus, significantly more of my gaming budget goes toward actual games.  I play more games and spend less, and I have zero reason to ever expose myself to that unenjoyable sect of gaming ever again.
---
If PC gaming really was clearly better, people wouldn't have to work so hard to tell others why.
---
I've made over 10+ reddit accounts, I delete them and make a new one whenever they hit 10k karma because I don't want to run the risk of any personal information I may have let slip get lost somewhere on the internet.

Did see that lol just read the title lol cheers

Beacuse it is a really good gun. Only because you think its the worst, doest make it the worst
---
You have to summon his 3rd account
---
Where did u get the model fmg9
---
Currently, everyone above Gold I've met all agreed that her stealth is actually too easy to counter in general once you know that's all she has at the moment. Gu mines, Yokai drones, Mozzie drones, barbed wires, barricaded entries, and even well hidden Valk cams can expose Nokk's position and render her stealth pointless. 
---
Yes, her concept is poor despite the idea looks really cool on idea. The whole stealthy Attacker sounds great until everyone realizes how it doesn't work well on an Attacker who have to go through so many obstacle to begin with. 
---
In order to ever really justify picking her over the other Attackers despite not providing any utility for the team, Nokk needs to be really strong on her own. Ash, Mav, and IQ are all pretty strong on their own while providing utilities for their team to benefit. 
---
Nokk needs to be strong enough to compete with those three that picking her over the them shouldn't look like a troll choice. 
---
The first step toward that goal would be slowly buffing her gun options as she's the only non-shield Attacker who is easily outgunned by every popular Defenders at the moment.
---
Mira is solid if you can learn where to place her mirrors. She can screw the team over if you place it in a wrong spot. You can roam around with nomad and hunt roamers.
---
I didn‚Äôt it‚Äôs an Airsoft Magpul FPG
---
It counts as an abandon which is a loss since you technically left the game
---
5 are to many 2 or 3 would be okay
---
There is certain ones where the cord sort of goes into the side of the plug rather than the back, which is flat.
---
Can you tell me how you make it good then?
---
The amount of people that don't have a problem with it is surprising.
---
Which one is the sasg again I only remember the bosg
---
Terrorist Hunt Realistic Disarm Bomb and Protect Hostage only. I get 30-40 kills per match and earn 300+renown for about 8 to 10(ish) minutes of my time. This is the fastest way I've found.

M4 is great in my completely unbiased opinion.

It has high damage yes but the accuracy is unreliable. Use the automatic pistol secondary as a primary.

If I remember correctly they‚Äôre reworking theme park this year

I miss alibi already... üò≠

She isn‚Äôt a true Russian
---
That's a connection issue homie
---
Haha that's the point!
---
Damn thought I had a real chance at commenting this
---
That's the way it is right now.  Outcome (W/L), likelihood of outcome (based on the two teams MMR at the start of the match) and uncertainty are the only factors.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It would make it more complicated, but factoring in how close the game was might help the algorithm be more accurate.  It would also feel more fair to gain/lose more for a 4-0 than a 5-4.  And it doesn't come with the same concerns that using individual performance would.
---
My biggest concern is that it might encourage more smurfing.  I see relatively few 4-0 matches (mostly 4-2 and overtime) and those that do are generally because one side has several smurfs or one extremely good smurf.
---
If you ban tachanka you can find him on the map as a npc looking through the window angrily.
---
Bruh cant believe they actually step on those, looks hella painful

Can't fookin touch this

Yes. It's likely they'll perma ban his account and then destroy your copy of the game via satellite
---
Dew Mine
---
The aug has the lower damage and statistically the lower dps because the fire rate is close.
---
Yep.  But eventually.  PC‚Äôs can emulate the best games of all time anyways from the SNES so who cares :p

oh no god please NOOOOOOOOOOO
---
If your aim is amazing, it‚Äôs fantastic.
---
Try the c75 auto as the secondary gun, it shreds in close quarters (don‚Äôt use the bosg in close quarters if your aim isn‚Äôt 10/10 or if you‚Äôre just generally unlucky)
---
Stop
---
My mistake. Well done!
---
That's my opinion on it too. His go to is "crouch spam and drop shot are equally op" (saying that the extra buttons allow that while aiming)

Thx this a actually helped alot

This is why I shoot out the wall where my Mira will be before I even put the reinforcement. 
---
Certain wall materials and wall coverings will do this more often than not. If you‚Äôre putting up a Mira in a wall made from that shitty wooden paneling (not the plywood like in Oregon basement) then you wanna blast the wall first. Additionally, ALWAYS shoot paintings off the before you put up a Mira. They do this like 80% of the time.
---
Yes, I tactically forgot and got lucky with the maverick

No, not at all.

Yeah I made some changes and her name is now vaino which is half of paranoia in Finnish which is vainoharha but that's too long

thanks but it keeps happening though no matter what I do

never seen a shell coming out of enemy's weapons a i had played a bunch of hours in this game so you don't have to go on me with these things how this game is detailed, this game is at first broken af and far from beign detailed how you said
---
Neat
---
The fuck ? This bug should be fixed immediately
---
This guy probably got sent to another galaxy. If that was me, I would've left the match and start playing witcher 3 that I enjoy so much lately.
---
Great shot btw. Have a great day.

WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU BROUGHT UPON THIS CURSED LAND!

This is absolutely adorable.

Oh I thought you meant the balcony on the side of the building, my bad

Thats a sick looking cosplay.
---
Things you CAN'T do about Mira:
---
Destroy the black mirror with X-cairos (Thatcher/Twitch can help you if it is electrified)
---
Destroy the mirror placed on soft wall with Zofia's gadget
---
Open the mirror with Twitch drone
---
Open the mirror with Sledge/Buck from below/upstairs
---
Blind anyone behind the mirror with Ying's gadget and push
---
Throw smokes/use Capitao's smoke bolts and push
---
If the mirror is on reinforced wall but there is a soft wall near it:
---
1) Make a hole in the soft wall with bullets/gadgets if there ain't one
---
2) Use Capitao's fire bolts/common grenades to eliminate anyone behind the mirror
---
Not to mention they didn‚Äôt think the game would revolve around headshots
---
I love you.
---
That's what I thought, it sounded strange.
---
And online Ubisoft says you can't virtually upgrade (though this was a page from 2017).

#UPGRADE YOUR EDITION TO GET YEAR 4 SEASON PASS AND YEAR 1 OPERATORS.
---
Put a ticket in with ubisoft to figure it out.
---
what was so special on this event, looks like normal mode to just...darker...
---
Welcome to the community, I pray that you don‚Äôt have to bad of a time dealing with the toxicity of some of the players. Here‚Äôs my suggestions:
---
1. This is a team game, treat it like one, and play it like one. Going Rambo is fun and all but getting yourself aimlessly killed for the chance at glory hurts the team. If a teammate accidentally kills you one round, don‚Äôt team kill them the next round on purpose. I‚Äôve lost too many ranked matches because a kid walked in front of my (or another teammates) gun while I was shooting and throws a hissy fit and team kills the next round. All that does is hurt you and your team. 
---
2. Line of sight is everything. This isn‚Äôt CoD or Halo that are 80% gun skill and 20% tactics. This game is probably 60% tactics and 40% gun skill. You can only look and shoot in one direction at a time, and so can the enemy. Get behind them or to their flank. When I‚Äôm on offense, I like to play Thermite sometimes because of his ability to bust through reinforced walls. This makes an unexpected opening in the enemy‚Äôs defense and can cause a lot of problems. When on defense, don‚Äôt all stand in the room of the objective. Makes it easy for the enemy to flank and for them to line up quick multi-kills.
---
3. Find what play styles work for you. There are a lot of options for operators now and not everyone is useful to every player. And if your strategy works, don‚Äôt let someone trash talk you out of it. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs stupid, but works. It ain‚Äôt stupid‚Äù. Refer to point 1 though because it‚Äôs important to make sure your strategy is compatible with the team.
---
4. Get good at aiming for the head.
---
5. This game has one of the worst communities ever imo. Don‚Äôt make it worse. R6S is an amazing game but all it takes is a bad community to ruin the experience for some people. Don‚Äôt cheat, don‚Äôt rage quit, and please refrain from telling others to kill themselves (I‚Äôve gotten that a lot). I live by the motto to always leave the place better than it was when you got there. Whether it‚Äôs a campsite or a gaming community, i think that attitude has some value to the world.
---
I hope this helps, but a lot is just gonna have to be learned while playing. Words can‚Äôt help you there. Good luck!

---
You got 60% epic I don't wanna hear it
---
The logic behind it is that, they don't want it to be cheaper to buy parts of a bundle than it is to buy the bundle. So a skin bundle cost 50k renown (without season pass), so if you were to just buy parts of it individually, it has to cost you more than a person buying the bundle. The person buying the bundle needs to get the better value. Therefore, the price of an individual cosmetic item must roughly equate to the cost of a skin bundle divided by 2.

---
&gt;you can do things a controller will never be able to do e.g leaning without ads
---
You cant lean without ADS even using a xim
---
&gt;also a controller can never be as precise or as fast as a keyboard
---
And a $200 headset will never sound as good or precise as those $20 headsets, nor will the mic sound as good, both are 2 huge advantages in Siege
---
&gt;You can say oh well i can buy a steering wheel in racing games, yes you can because it is allowed and the devs are fine with people using steering wheels
---
A steering wheel is natively supported, which is why people are more ok with buying and using them and seeing other people use them. Once kbms are natively supported it'll be just an afterthought. It only makes sense since a racing game is designed for a steering wheel and a fps is designed for kbms. The controller is just the most efficient way to get the most universal control medium possible so we can have 30 different genre of games on 1 console. 
---
&gt;but in r6 the devs are not ok with people using mnk on cosplay and do not endorse it.
---
Again, it doesn't matter if they endorse it or not. Sony and Microsoft isnt going to allow Ubi to cost them money. Its Sony's console, its Sony's rules, and if Ubi wants their game on the Playstation then they have to abide by their rules. Same with Xbox. 
---
Overwatch has a very similar problem with KBMs, but the head dev of Overwatch said that you cant report people for it even if it is cheating by the dev's standards, by Sony/Microsofts standards it's fine
---
&gt;They just don‚Äôt have a way of blocking the emulators.
---
Actually they have a very easy way. Keyboards can only move in 45 degree increments, if after, say 10 games and the player only moves in these 45¬∞ you know they're kbm, if they move in the full 360¬∞ it's a controller.
---
This is how Fortnite started banning Kbm users October of 2018, but suddenly they dont anymore and there has been no peep of it either

The majority of people don't have a super strong opinion on boarder.  Unlike Hereford.  Hereford is so unbalanced, it's almost like a glitch in the game.  People get frustrated then come to reddit to vent about it's negative impact on the game.  I don't see how there's anything wrong with that.
---
Why do you think we took Plane and Bartlet U out of ranked?  Because they were unbalanced and not conducive to competitive play.  Hereford is right there with Bartlet.  Might be worse.
---
Who does this!

What about Finka?
---
What have you brought opon this cursed land
---
Dis dude don‚Äôt know how to reply
---
I've never really played lol but I get the idea behind it, and it is both really good ideas you have
---
No it can‚Äôt wallbang, it‚Äôll know the enemy is there (somewhere) in the general direction, reducing the charge time before firing. For the clutch thing, since it fires 1 round per second in a 1v1, spraying it with an automatic weapon will be easy kill since it‚Äôs a bot/AI. In fact since there are no remaining players if Walker is out, it should just be game over. For the stat description change-Doing 3 damage pretty weak and over time makes it broken if the enemy is always showing itself then it becomes a fast 3 damage with 20 rounds/sec. Also I forgot to mention that it moves at a 0.25% of a 1 speed op and it targets and focuses on 1 enemy at a time. Plus it can‚Äôt target gadgets like mute jammers at all. As I said, weak slow support to give enemy‚Äôs a 2nd target to draw fire from you.
---
Ah! I haven't seen any recent south park and even then i've really only seen probably 30-40 episodes all pre season 10 i'd say. If it was on netflix or amazon prime video i'd have probably seen it all multiple times by now.

My main is level 335, smurfs are level 107, 110, 60, and 3 more below 30. My friends main accounts level is 350, and his smurf accounts are level 277, 250, 130, 100, and like 4 more accounts ranging from 60 to 100.

Nice. Needs a bigger belt to complete it!
---
They won't do shit. Siege brings the most money to them as it is and apparently everyone is happy with how the game is now. The moment it loses its popularity they will put it on life support and move on. 
---
People who have issues with the game and how Ubi treats it and its community is a minority. We can't do shit as long as the majority is happy to eat shit and ask for more. 
---
I lost all faith in Siege after it became super popular and Ubi started milking the shit out of it.

The commando does shit damage and the Roni has a tiny mag. There are way better options.

As for the M&amp;K question specifically, it doesn‚Äôt not answer the question of adapters, as they actually mimic a controller, and allow people to use M&amp;K with the game thinking it‚Äôs a controller, which in theory screws with the system and allows M&amp;K users to play with controller players.
---
However for everything else, I do feel you, they‚Äôd be nice additions, but limitations aren‚Äôt completely out of the question even though people have discussed work arounds. I‚Äôd personally love an FOV slider, but I think Sieges 60 FPS frame cap is limiting the chance for one.
---
Its just a clip damn. So judgemental

The idea of having vigil slowly fade away is really creative but mozie has more detail. And come on, it‚Äôs mozie.

like i said a few comments ago, a macro and a keybind are different, if someone binds mouse1 to scroll wheel in razer synapse or something, then how are they gonna be banned for that, it would be risky, i don't know all of them, i didn't make the anticheat but im **assuming** rn, as i have never ever seen a battle eye ban because of a macro
---
You misread his statement and are missing the point. He is talking about matchmaking based off the highest mmr in the group. In this potential new system.If you have a group of 1 plat 3 and 2 coppers, they will get matched with 2 other plat 3's. Now the random plat 3's are stuck with 2 legit coppers on their team
---
DART trap not FART trap
---
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not allowed!‚Äù
---
The commando does 36 damage that‚Äôs good for a defender smg. The p10 has a good dps that shreds people bc of fast fire rate.
---
Tbh native support would reduce the use of adapters bu a ton. Btw why do you think that FOV affects the frame rate? It doesn‚Äôt sound like an insane feature that should affect it that much
---
Sry next time
---
Why is he holding Wii Fit Board?
---
Yeah you can restrict them with ip bans if they have more than 1 account but that would probably be met with huge backlash

im aware about the message, but i have even played with people who admit to using macros for YEARS weather that be crouch, lean spam or shooting at the speed of sound, macros are cheating in my eyes too, but it's hard to differentiate a macro and a speedy keybind, i may be wording my stuff badly, i hope you get what i mean

---
Oh well still in pro league all players have to submit a full report from a program they use during matches that tracks keyboard and mouse movements. Ubi looks over these and if they find a button being pressed at an inhuman rate the team and the player gets banned.
---
Love it
---
I mean, Fuze is an Uzbek. It just depends on what member state of the former Soviet Union you want gone.

Yea I get it but again the battle eye we have is garbage, so it SHOULD be picking up these macros but I guess it isn‚Äôt.

Bruh, I‚Äôve noticed the same thing ever since they changed ranked. I literally always get attack and then when a game comes around where we start on defence I‚Äôm genuinely surprised. I always think to myself that some lucky bastards must be getting defence every ranked game.

This exactly why I hate hostage. I really feel like if you kill the hostage while the enemy team has them you shouldn‚Äôt get kicked. It pretty hard when they‚Äôre using the hostage as a shield.

Hey sir I would have loved credit you if I knew your username. So here's my part of the story : I generally download  wallpapers and similar stuff I really like because I save a lot of posts on reddit and stuff that I really like just disappears in the big mess of the saved list that I have. So yesterday I have seen some guy make an animated glaz wallpaper using pixaloop so I wanted give it a try. And made a bunch of them from the collection that I had in my phone. Since it was pretty much impossible to credit you I couldnt do it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Finka is Russian

---
it's a laser once you play a few thunts and get used to pulling down hard enough
---
It‚Äôs the fact that the more of the surrounding you can see the, the more the game has to load, which is limited to the frame rate, and it is dependant on the game. I believe that‚Äôs why the less taxing games visually such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Apex do have FOV sliders and games such as PUBG, COD and R6 do not. I believe this is the case however, it might actually be due to the game engine.
---
As for the native support, adapters aren‚Äôt completely out of the question, so people use mouse and keyboard, in order to gain the advantage over controller users so they can win ranked matches and gain elo. The argument could be made of why not just have it so that everyone just uses a mouse and keyboard, but people use controllers as a more relaxed way of gaming, and people would of grown up using a controller, so it wouldn‚Äôt not be fair on those people in an effort to try and sort a problem.

yea im aware we have the shitty battle eye, but this may be on purpose, as this could falsely ban thousands of accounts which is very bad news, i completely get where your coming from, i've been against full teams of lean macro scum back in the day too, but i'd rather 10 people get away with macros than 1 false ban

That measure is usually taken when there is blatant cheating occuring like using external software (Ubi doesn't even use it for "hackers"). There is no way to differentiate a smurf from someone who is new until they have a few hours of playtime. The only thing that can be done is put tighter penalties on throwing/abandoning so deranking is not as easy. Alt accounts are not inherently bad, but when allowed to derank so easily it becomes an issue

Why didn't you just use the PS4's recording?

A someone who has being playing warden exclusively for the past few days on console, I feel like he‚Äôs a good roamer. But I feel like if they made him 2 speed it would help a little bit. Also, instead of having to activate the glasses to remove flashes, the glasses should function like ying does, where you are immune to the flashes. And make it easier to see through smoke, and possible be able to slow walk and still see it, not sprinting though.

Higher fire rate means a higher chance of landing a hit, that means more chances to land a headshot if you're aiming near there.

His hazmat suit does not feature an active filtration system smoke is the only one with an active filtration system. Not all filters can filter the air to the same level.

---
&gt; If that's the point of it then why does a third of the community smurf like shitlords to dunk on low skilled players?
---
You just answered your own question.  It‚Äôs because they want an easy (i.e. not fair) matchup.
---
Smurf accounts in general are a whole ‚Äònother topic altogether.  Unfortunately, there‚Äôs not an easy solution when it comes to it.
---
&gt;Also if the point wasn't to try and work your way up there wouldn't be rewards for higher ranks including this game and every other modern ranked game.
---
This game doesn‚Äôt reward you for being ranked higher.  It just rewards you for being ranked in general during the season with a charm.  I wouldn‚Äôt characterize it as an incentive so much as it is a participation trophy.
---
A little bit, but more intense. Approaching the door and around the door, the attacker would still be able to hear into the next room but a medium to loud hum would make it significantly harder to hear. The device itself is called HDSD, which stands for highly directional sound device (I imagine she shouts something along the lines of "Deploying HDSD"), so the hum is mostly outside of the room the device is deployed in (but still barely in the room where it is deployed).

That was the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. I think I lost a few brain cells watching that Kapkan do nothing
---
Looks great! It‚Äôd be dope to see some usage weathering on the casing itself. Some scratches with bump mapping, instead of having it be super clean. Maybe even some smudges on it.
---
Great job again!
---
I can really see Ash's hit box here.
---
Where‚Äôs vigil???
---
I feel your pain last night i got and ace and still lost the round...
---
Plastic straws, Elmer's glue, chewed up gum, ball bearings and used needles from my doctor's office dumptster
---
No. I don't think I will
---
Yeah I‚Äôve done it with C4 but killed my teammate instead
---
T O W E R
---
It leaves you so vulnerable though, that door next to there into train is usually open and you have no chance of returning fire if someone is there
---
To go for vertical plays. She has just 2 impacts and usually i waste them on shields and barb.
---
you don‚Äôt get the point
---
bruh üôåüò´üí™üí™üí™
---
That‚Äôs a unique idea. I like it
---
I reported the auto mod for that
---
Well deserved upvote!
---
this will make you want to play r6
---
Art, you just watched art
---
I once got teamkilled for reinforcing a wall that a Mira didn't want reinforced and then they did that.
---
You trust your friends not to hit you in the balls.
---
Lucky
---
Staying aliiiiiiiiive!!!!!
---
Damn that was a good shot. Gg
---
So you hate the wording? Because at its heart it‚Äôs simple one handed weapon manipulation, sorry for the tacky name to attract views, next time I‚Äôll be much more boring so you dong get your ‚Äúcringe‚Äù set off. If you hate the entire point of a weapon and it‚Äôs conceal-ability then that‚Äôs you I guess.
---
Okay, and what‚Äôs the problem with two stealth roamers in the game. there are multiple hard breachers and multiple trappers and many others that fit into a play style. And honestly this would give more diversity to team comps
---
Lmao, you are a legit moron xD
---
No it‚Äôs the new 100% accurate hipfire
---
Meaty Marley is the best lol
---
nah i just run and die
---
From the start I'm thinking this is going to be some stupid shit then the headshot hits the kill feed and I'm like "well... shit" lol
---
You‚Äôve fallen for one of the classic blunders:
---
Sorry man, I've been having computer problems for a while now. Thought they would be fixed sooner
---
Attacker or defender?
---
Could you do Thermite
---
Idk maybe put the reticle on it lmao
---
Omfg
---
dont lag ez
---
Defender

This is good IF you place the window at crouching height.
---
What is this game, if I may ask?
---
Does any have gold to give this man this pretty DaNk
---
Where's my recruit :(
---
Red dot is too small, I feel like I miss shots with reflex and recoil is amplified. Holographic is the perfect one for me, if in being honest I use it more than acog ATM.
---
Cav has the addition of silence and interrogation. Makes this guy obsolete from the get go
---
Nn- Nut
---
It started to bother me that the gas mask is clearly not air tight with the beanie under it.
---
Where could one place these? Would they be like Maestro‚Äôs ‚ÄúEvil Eyes‚Äù and how visible and hard to destroy would they be?
---
Agreed.
---
No matter how inept the team is, there's something to be said for wiping out a whole team dolo
---
Well that‚Äôs just graphic no need to insult America like that. So you hate a simple motion? The fact my hand left the weapon for a 100 milliseconds? Are you having safety issues with it?
---
Not really because this guy can instantly kill 3 people quickly in complete silence
---
For my next magic trick I will turn this grenade into c4 .....
---
I mean obviously you wouldn‚Äôt want to do it to broken windows, why would you? On the other hand who really pays attention to a window on the other side of the map that someone may have spawn peeked at. Use some common sense man.
---
Roasted, toasted, packaged up and posted, my guy!
---
they can‚Äôt do anything about it
---
Lmao, I insulted you and based in on school shooting that happen in america ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you really are unable to understand what people write lmao xD
---
Stop. I can only get so erect
---
Yupp
---
Mood
---
imagine a stimmed up to 140 doc rushing you without you being able to see him on your drone, a blitz shield flash on his chest, a fuze cluster charge, and a completely silent rifle
---
Again, why would you try to use this on objective windows? Use it far away or upstairs to flank on the enemy. Sneaking into a building is hard right now, if you can do it without making the noise of breaking the window or door it could be a game changer.
---
I disagree, I think it‚Äôs going to be used very often, for example when cap is used often: planting. You‚Äôre on site planting and want to block off an entry, do this, defenders will have to wait for smoke to disperse or push blindly and die.
---
This is beautiful.
---
Hey nice ace, I main Zofia too and I always miss cams. Btw what gun skin are you using?

Snoot

Hero‚Äôs never die
---
Oh shit wrong game
---
Yeah I am offended by unnecessary violence and you likening me to it. Although I use replicas for my cosplay I try to differentiate myself from the ‚Äúschool shooter‚Äù bullcrap.
---
Bro he shot him with glaz's rifle
---
But then you would still be stationary. And instead of ripping his character of old stuff loving russian apart. Why not just give penetrating effect to his ww1 gun?
---
I mean it would be literally the same Ability but for your suggestion you had to change him and make a different character.
---
I prefer the Holo because I feel like the little circle allows me to kinda figure out that my targets are in my gun sights while not sacrificing vision. Idk that's just kinda how I thought about it
---
Ironic because he‚Äôs the one spectating you
---
Oh boi, you have to hate r6 which is an unnecessary violent game ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The turret are not controllable and can be placed by either throwing or placing. They can be placed on top of doors or walls and are slightly smaller than the Evil Eye but the shock turret does a bit more damage but a slow fire rate that the Evil Eye
---
I‚Äôm sorry I didnt know siege was fucking Roblox on pc
---
It‚Äôs a video game, at the end of the day video games don‚Äôt cause violence.
---
Yeah it was pretty funny me and my buddies had a laugh about it.
---
I can't even see them until they're already dead. Nice shot!
---
ash is overrated
---
she is such a garbage op if your not rushing
---
Your scaring people
---
Because sometimes being silent when roamers are around is the better option.
---
I always aim at the front for this very reason. I don't see this as being toxic. Nice shot though!
---
Boosting???
---
'member when IQ had frag grenades? i member.
---
Noice.
---
Doing this in 0-3? Such an idot
---
Congrats, what's the last trophy you had to get?
---
tf
---
One day my team got aced by this so I've been paranoid ever since lol. Thanks
---
It's a work in progress so I didn't at first think about more guns, but, I'll have an updated version out soon.
---
You and I have very different play styles and it‚Äôs clear they wouldn‚Äôt mesh lol. I like the guys idea for this, it‚Äôs different. I prefer silent entry‚Äôs when possible. Or being as far away as possible when I enter the building.
---
Meat wall (blow a guy up with breach charge)
---
I kind of feel bad for them xD
---
How great was this event though.
---
Now I have a reason to use N√∏kk
---
[https://imgur.com/XP8CVbV](https://imgur.com/XP8CVbV) I did it for you comrade
---
Amazon next day shipping it
---
Bucket for you bucket for me buckets for all
---
That‚Äôs the idea. But ubi don‚Äôt like my ideas.
---
That is the same as my connection and the game runs fine. Hell, I used to play on a mobile hotspot, and now having 10 down 1up DSL the game runs much better.
---
Leaked elite rook skin
---
I‚Äôve just posted an updated one if you‚Äôre interested.
---
I was in a game and someone put a Mira in between 2 reinforced walls. I posted it here if you wanna see it.
---
Gadgets as well. Does this op have any breach? Does this op ge grenades? Does this op sneaky sneaky thru smoke? How does the support aspect of this op work. How does he play without his special. Think of someone like rook. He drops his special first thing and then the entire rest of his game play is a shooter. How does snake work without the bow?
---
My hero
---
The bow would definitely take skill to pull off but I feel like 4 arrows is to op. Probably just make it 3 and add a charge timer to it and it'll be fine.
---
member my callout
---
nothing wrong with not sprinting around as ashe when it's 1v5
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/CkBBaok](https://imgur.com/gallery/CkBBaok) I did it for you comrade
---
They need to give nokk an actual attacking gun. And if they feel like reusing they might as well use one that sees no attention
---
I bet you‚Äôre a gold 2 talking shit about people‚Äôs ranks üò≠üòÇget a life virgin
---
I feel the trap would work best as a loud sound that doesnt distort but does deafen and alert defenders. Also deployment would be better as something similar to mozzies or nomads devices where its a free place device.
---
"The Bad one" is no longer available. Though with the Edition changes that happened in February the base game ops are no longer free and must be unlocked with Renown, But they are super cheap compared tot he DLC ops.
---
It's cool to see more of your stuff on here man! I subbed a couple hours ago. You've definitely got potential. Your editing is on point, and you and your friends are pretty funny. Keep it up!
---
Alt enter twice maybe
---
You can crouch in CoD?
---
That‚Äôs why i chose the C8 SFW. It‚Äôs also a weapon used by the J√¶gerkorpset in real life.
---
Why are you using a holo on G36?
---
nah we dont do that around here
---
the fuck
---
is this r/softwaregore
---
That‚Äôs some cool background lore for the world that Ubisoft created.
---
 T H I C C B O I
---
yeah, it was found on [youtube.com/jollypiratedonut](https://youtube.com/jollypiratedonut). what a hack
---
Because that‚Äôs what I like to personally play with and I do good with it.....that‚Äôs the reason anybody should use any gun and put any attachment on it.
---
No it‚Äôs me photoshopping my ideal n√∏kk loadout.
