I was playing when it dropped, stopped when dust line dropped, came back when skull rain dropped, and because of the toxicity i stopped playingg until grim sky cause the ultimate was 6 bucks on xbox so i said maybe its better and it was. There will always be toxic assholes in this game, but i feel its been slowly getting better than when it first started.
---
---
---
Thats intresting actally
---
Don't forget Cav
---
Are you wearing any type of outfit or just default valk?
---
shes actually a really powerful op she can hack cams and call the enemy which is great at clearing roamers and she has a great dmr and two good smgs (i prefer the c75)
---
Use it as you are about to push a room or plant a bomb. Then you can hear where they are or they have to stop holding an angle to turn it off.
---
Yeah, i just got the idea and thought this could be a well balenced usefull opp!
---
Would be very op
---
So I assume pairing her with jackal is great at counter roaming.. good to know:) anything else like strats you know
---
Black Ice without the blue makes me think of some of the old pro league weapon skins. They were basically just that

Smh happened to me too. Ubisoft needs to actually look at the chat
---
I hop on my smurf when i do inevitably get banned( my irl team is called the heathens and we tend to defend ourselves against toxic people even at the result of a ban) but i use it to try and teach players the mistakes i once made and hope they learn from theirs as i once learned from mine( like not standing in a door way to drone or peek a hallway)
---
I think they could balance this pretty good
---
I just do something productive and come back to this
---
Run away as fast as possible
---
Nothing wrong with Asian servers, but nobody here uses Xbox, so I wouldn’t be able to find a match
---
A lot of operator ideas on this sub are crazy but this seems like it could make an interesting operator, maybe not exactly this but the idea is cool
---
bring dokkaebi jackal lion blitz and finka for ultimate cancer mode
---
hey no fair, i've been placed silver before due to solo'ing (i'd consider myself a plat+ player) and silver/gold is pretty much the standard for the majority of the community anyway.
---
and i'm stuck in low gold right now on my alt, and am I a smurf? no. i'm actually trying to win. maybe gold players shouldn't be gold and should be actually silver.
---
I just want jager acog back
---
Thx, and yeah mabey some things are to op about this but this is just the idea, if it gets really populair ubi has to work this out.
---
My fingers are just double-jointed, don't mind that.
---
maybe just don't be toxic &amp; turn off your chat
---
Can this be done on console
---
yes you are a bad person. those poor newcomer kids dont even know what to do yet lol you bully
---
I reload it then it’s work for a game or 2 then the same thing happens again
---
and what'd you type? lol
---
This is the best siege clip I've seen in a long time.
---
is it bannable tho?
---
Thermite for me
---
me too, congrats on your first karma lol
---
That’s an interesting way to look at it. I’ve barely played with or against him since his rework so I’m basing my opinion off how I think he is now in theory. Still, I don’t think the scans are more powerful. A full body outline is just ridiculously strong, even though it stopped outlining if you stopped moving. 
---
In a coordinated team then sure, I could see the new scans being quite good. But in solo queue and mid tier ranked, he’s basically worthless. I feel like half the time, you’re barely even gonna have time to find where the ping is before it goes away. That can be alleviated by communicating but overall I still think he’s in a weaker state, though I’m curious to see how he performs at higher levels and in pro league (I assume his ban will be lifted next season if it hasn’t already, I haven’t been following).
---
Why would it be bannable lmfao
---
"Enemy drone spinning up" and "You're being hunted/You've been exposed."
---
FBI Swat intensifies
---
You realise it would have had to have been repeat offenses or some seriously fucked up shit to get an immediate perma-ban, yeah?
---
Monty Shield, Smg-11, Breaching Charge, 3 Speed

yea it does match, problem is when there are diamonds and plats duoing coppers it takes the average and they end up in gold...this is literally 5/10 of my last games.

&gt;way that's still incredibly stupid of a system for a perm ban
---
Its pretty fucking hard to get a perma ban due to toxicity. Normally you get a few hours of a time out. You need a history of toxic behaviours to get a perma, telling someone to kys once doesnt even get you a ban anymore. 
---
OP repeatedly broke the games ToS and got a perma ban, thats on him.

Everybody just to let you know she is holding a 1911 in her operator picture and not the P12.

I don't get why they try and shit on this balanced spot when right around the corner glaz can pixel peak ruins and completely shut off the pool table rotate.
---
A normal season last around 3 months. The next season will be around early June ish.
---
Ah so it’s Normally each season new ones show up
---
Xbox or PlayStation
---
Yeah its cancer was at promos (was gold4) got matched agaisnt 2 diamonds
---
Unranked players are low gold to high sliver when they start the placement matches. 
---
So Op whos 149 thats ok with the game and has a gold 3 rank can be matched with a player that literally just got to lvl30 and started playing rank. 
---
This is a issue with how the system works with new/unranked players, not a issue with OPs skill.
---
Smoke Main?
---
I don't understand either, I don't know why they can't just make tarps officially accessible, it would make the map that much more interesting
---
oh yeah sorry, each season comes with 2 new operators. 
---
Normally you get a new map as well with the start of the season but this year the season releases will have updates to existing maps to balance out the sub par maps to make them more competitive.

I’m guessing you’re a rather low rank? People in low ranks tend to ”copy” other people and try to play like them if they get kills. Instead one should focus on their own gameplay and play the ops and strats that work the best for them. Trying to adopt someones playstyle is always bad.
---
Xbox
---
:c
---
Makes sense to me, 3 operators I basically never choose.
---
Holy shit
---
Don’t... don’t smurf if you aren’t a newcomer. That just ruins the game for new players, meaning less new players put many hours into the game, not buying the DLCs. If this happens on a big scale the game could be abounded earlier than wanted because EA won’t update a financially terrible game
---
I'm stupid how do you get the thing next to your name that says what you Maine

Yeah ikr, I joined a discord squad and a member in my party kept provoking the random for no reason but then the same person complains about r6s toxicity in the discord smh.

Yes and everything adds up to the status of numnuts. Let’s go through the list, shall we? 
---
1) a 30 min teamkill ban with friends 
---
2) getting baited into tk’ing someone twice (oldest trick in the book) 
---
3) Teamkilling twice even if one was an accident
---
Edit: 4) you would like tk bans to be removed from the game 
---
All checks out
---
Ah
---
You can see his lips move on the close up. Lol pew pew pew pew
---
A big fucking edit coming right up
---
It honesty does never happen. I don't think that's a bad idea but I can't see Ubisoft implementing anything close to that sadly. I would just get more people to play with, it makes the experience a lot toxic and just more enjoyable overall

This is basically the equivalent of avengers endgame now.

As much as I hate to say it, it's Casual.
---
I got kicked the other night from a 1v2 I lost, because I was stuck in a corner and both enemies rushed me from opposite sides. Obviously I could only take on one at a time, so I died. I didn't care, because it's casual. But some dude turned on his mic and claimed it was an easy kill, could have meleed one and shot the other, and all this dumbass stuff, along with "I'm kicking you." I responded back saying it was ridiculous. (Should have just left it there, but..) I also threw in right after that perhaps with dumb ideas like that, there's a reason he died (first even) and I was still alive (with kills on 2 of 3 dead enemies.) Guess they didn't like my smartass comment.
---
Really though, it's just a game. And it's fucking casual. So who cares?? Not everyone is going to be the best at the game. And honestly, I still stick by what I said to the other guy. When it comes down to you being the last one, and everyone is yelling at you on what to do, There's a reason I'm alive, with kills, and they're dead. But I still get kicked. Even if I win or lose, I get kicked. If I'm the points leader or trailer, I get kicked. If I'm on a camera, kicked. If I choose someone else's main, kicked. If I join a match, kick. 
---
It's really fucking stupid, and I really want to know why the others chime in to kick too. I only kick for a valid reason such as purposefully Team killing, or clearly the person is AFK and just holding a spot from an active user. I don't kick if someone blows a match for us, even if it's fucking Ranked. It's a goddamn game. You're there to play it just as everyone else is. Stop ruining their experience.
---
I didn’t have anywhere near the mental capacity nor the pieces to make it functioning, but someone with the mental capacity and the pieces definitely could, thank you for your kind words
---
Also rubber bands for the slide to move forward after pulled back

Came to this comment lol

Are you sure this works on all walls? AFAIK if you place a breach charge outside the area covered by the circle it won't be jammed. I've breached many improperly jammed walls this way, by placing the charge at the very extreme edge of the wall.
---
Heeeeres THERMITE!

Have you seen people on YouTube like mydifferentusername and people like him because all that is bricks that match and that would be on par with them

Honestly, I don’t. This is my first recording gameplay. As soon as I saw the ragdoll glitch I pressed my hotkey as fast as I could.

I agree, this is coming from a Thatcher main

I have had good times with this and bad times with this. One game, I am queued with one friend and we have three randoms. Person on the other team says the N word so my friend and I instantly report. We ask teammates to report and they willingly did (which sometimes they refuse for some reason?) Anyway literally 10 seconds later he gets banned for toxicity. This has happened at least 4 other times in my games for just general, consistent sexism and homophobia. Now other times we can have someone straight spamming any and all slurs in chat and have all 9 others report and still no repercussions. The report system is a fickle beast...
---
I knew it will happen, that's why the comment. :D
---
Well while I find him very frustrating at times, I also feel that there are plenty of times where he just gets wrecked. I think that the cooldown change is a big step in the right direction, and makes it so he still excels at what he was meant for, up close fights and pushing. From personal experience, I think the best way to counter him is shotguns. Obviously the higher in elo you go the more difficult this would still become but with some of the mechanics on how blitz raises his shield, if you cam try to bait the flash, it can become a hard fight for the blitz if you try to like straddle shot them, meaning sway the shot towards their back and like swipe by from the side. If hes sprinting his shield will rise and leave him vulnerable. Until ubi does more there is not much you can do, but I do feel shields in general dont exite high level players as they dont have the same frag potential. I personally feel that the way to fix shields is take away the one hit kill. Make it so maybe it knocks down like an airjab, and maybe also does a finite amount of damage that could kill if met. Just a thought idk.

Use shadow play or medal so you don't have to record the whole time

Those who were fucked by pengu down voted

Im so happy i jumped over to pc there everyone including me abuses mouse and keyboard
---
It helps for reaction during fast movements, but it wont improve ur gameplay "significantly". Map knowledge, aim skills, game sense still required. U wont appreciate it til u go back to 60fps after few weeks of 144.
---
I know a lot of players with 144 who are still bad in the game.
---
This reminds me older days of youtube
---
They removed the acog on ash because she has too high pick rate, and 99% of ash players used R4C, and removing the acog actually worked because ash’s pickrate dropped massively and people are actually starting to use the G36c
---
Wait there is other maps besides Outback?
---
1300 hours played. Only have 1 Black Ice. And it's on Ash's R4C... I hate playing Ash, and have the least time played on her at something like 32 minutes.
---
A long time ago they used to be able to be purchased, but now you can only get them through the packs.
---
Can we please get a +4 card charm?
---
I usually get stuck with Villa and Fortress
---
IDK what rank you are playing but Ela mines are really strong and her smg is still good in the right hands
---
That's good to know, now I can look forward to it... though the 900 hours worries me. Thank you for the quick response
---
r/bettereveryloop
---
Dude, this loop is so seamless. This was great to watch in confusion as you constantly got kills and were never found.
---
Thank you Kanye! Very cool

Something tells me to find out if he is paying to stay in the group, like some silly membership fee or to provide 'resources'. I can't substantiate this feeling, but that's what came to me.

---
And Kapkan's traps actually kill. Thermite charges make massive holes. Blitz can flash rapidly. Smokes canisters can kill people. Fuze doesn't hockey puck the hostage. Glaz has actual camo. Tachanka can shoot through concrete.
---
Only black ice i ever wanted
---
It was match point on ranked 1v5. I’d lost all hope, but they just kept pushing the same door 1 by 1 and I won with 100hp left.
---
1,500th subscriber lol. Good video dude!
---
That's a lot of time....and a lot of cheaters.
---
Wish Sony and Microsoft did something more strict!
---
Hey man, what timezone do you play in?
---
I just think of the alpha pack. Even if it’s 0-2 you probably just have to play one match to increase your chance of wining it next match
---
No the true one doesn’t have YT in his username

Nah they should just add ned kelly

"Watch for the blast!"...in your heart...

My first time playing cav I clutched a 1v4, the round started with a team kill so I think I redeemed myself but my fight with Monty was pretty tough, eventually he had to plant the diffuser and i got him before he could raise his shield
---
plot twist i actually have m &amp; k adapter because my brother is a pussy i actually tryed this in one casual and i wanted to throw it off the window

See my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b1tm21/what_the_fck/eio3d9w?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). People often think glaz has bad hitreg issues because of how his  scope works. People think that yellow = hibox,  so when they shoot while aiming  at yellow it should register as a hit, but in reality yellow just highlights the whole player model,and the hitbox  is smaller than the player model.
---
It does nothing on console
---
I know. But that doesn't absolve them of the accusation of cheating.
---
If they wanted to play on MnK, they should have thought it through and gotten a PC.

Yesterday this one dude on my team got peeked every. Single. Round. It was literally a 5v4 with a spectator. Ffs.

You do realize she is meant to be a cqc op and i can control the recoil up to 15 meters but the dmg is a bit low but she is a very good op (team empire use her effectively on oregon roaming so i would say she is a good operator and not that underpowered
---
Isnt level 72 pretty small, like under 200 hours In game?

3 leavers is boosting not ddos what the fuck dude

I assume you haven't either as you didn't provide any soruce. Microsoft as well officially via chat and other contact methods suggest Razer Turret, or an xim apex if the game you try to use mnk on via console doesn't not have native support for mnk.

Yeah, saw this 2 or 3 years ago but it's still funny how smoke holds the shotgun in recruit's face

Had a ranked match on Oregon, soloQing a couple months back, in round 1 two guys left and we were 3 v 5 in plat elo, I have a few callouts but they kept silent. It was at 0-3 that I started ranting about how nobody ever talks on ranked and suddenly headsets awoke, we then played a perfect defense with lesion, kapkan and mute with some of the best callouts I’ve ever witnessed from randoms. I then clutched a 4v1 on attack waiting patiently outside killing greedy people. Second def same as first. As it was 3-3 we lost the second match point def to a finka push and then clutched it to a 5-4 because our alibi player in last defense was a beast and on the final attack the dokki player sniped 3 guys who tried tomspawnpeek. Those guys were the best randoms I’ve met so far.
---
It dond go down like dat

I’m more of a dry wanker myself why do u use lube?

A while ago i was in a 4 man squad and we asked a random level 9 to join us. We had a great time and only lost 3 out of 4 games we played
---
I think the main point (that often gets overlooked) in the “MnK on console” debate is time.
---
I invest my time into a game and I expect that game to be fair but invariably it’s not. No one likes losing, it sucks but it’s one of the two outcomes in Siege and it’s going to happen. I genuinely don’t mind losing to other console/controllers players who are a better shot, smarter player and disciplined at executing tactics. Hats off to them, they deserve it.
---
What I DON’T like losing to is the knobhead bronze smurf solo player carrying his silver-at-best buddies to platinum because he’s a dab hand at mouse and keyboard and isn’t ashamed to shake his mouse at you on the end of round cam.
---
If you take these factors out, a lot of players could be a rank or two higher at the end of the season which they throughly deserve.
---
If you have to have a third party adapter to make shit work, it’s cheating. No excuses or debates can change that.
---
it says hibana main though
---
I am playing since VS and i don't get it.
---
FUCK I AM SO STUPID

She's so cute. Just realized I've never seen ash or any operator laugh in pics or videos

Why does this matter?

“Use of third-party hacking, cheating or botting clients.”
---
MnK is not native, it requires a THIRD-PARTY piece of hardware to get it to work. The XIM tricks the R6S client into thinking that you’re using a controller when you’re using MnK. Ubi have stated many times that they consider it cheating but they can’t do anything about it because the PS4 OS supports MnK for accessibility.

I don't get how gamers hate Favela. It's a beautiful map if you learn to master it. The attacker-defender beneficial might be a bit unbalance but it's a fun map. For me at least.
---
In casual it's a bit try hardy if your spawn peeking but ranked is fair game
---
Yes. Yes she has it.
---
By that logic, they may as well take battle eye off then as cheating is against the TOS but it’s not legally enforceable 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
*bullying*
---
I honestly wish i could play newcomers, my skill level of playing varies so much that sometimes it seems that i’m actually just starting the game.
---
and seriously, everyone crying about no spawn peaking in casual. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Isn't casual the place to master your tactics? if you are learning spawn peaking, to use it or defend from it better to learn in casual than ranked.
---
There is an app called R6 Guide. I used it when I first got into the game.
---
Hitreg is client-side in Siege. Ping doesn't effect gameplay /like that/
---
It takes 7 seconds to reinforce and it would roughly be a 15 second round trip to get from the window to the hatch and back, so you're telling me that you didn't see at the start of the round the live pinged player on the roof for about 17/18 seconds, the big wording "ENEMY DETECTED OUTSIDE" on your screen, or hear the announcer voice or hear them reinforcing? how do people get a way with these stupid strats
---
New Elite Tachanka - Thanos confirmed?
---
Your teammates will call out blackbeard as soon as they see or hear him. He really shines on sites where he can rappel onto a window and cut off a whole area, as his body is not exposed. To be able to do this effectively, BB's teammates will have to be on the look for runouts, so you might have to sacrifice one other operator to protect blackbeard from outside. 
---
He can still be killed head on some ocassions, but even though it is very possible it might be too risky, so it is best to ignore Blackbeard and play numbers inside the building if the runout is impossible, since it would be a 5v3. The attacking team would still have an advantage, but it is nowhere near impossible to win the round. 
---
However, if the site is not favourable for him and has to go into the building, he becomes a below average operator with pathetic speed and weak guns. He is extremely susceptible to flanks and an easy target to hit. He might be able to catch defenders by surprise, but it would then be a problem of the defense gathering intel and communicating.
---
So I would describe Blackbeard as being strong, but situational, and I feel more operators should fit that description. He is very annoying to deal with in the right circumstances though.
---
I totally disagree but everyone has their own opinion.
---
If tou say pros ruin the game you're so wrong you wouldnt have all the strats without the pros you wouldn't know if something is really a broken op or a bad one without them and playing ela smg isn't that bad you can easily get kills with her by comboing the mine withe the rof and you forget roamers job which is to waste time instead of getting kills and ela is really good in that  since her mines make the enemy think she is near and start going slower or backup giving you a chance to get a jump on them.
---
Specifically, because OP is higher that the Blackbeard, if the blood spawns at the place the hit was registered, and because it's server validated, there's a delay, then the only reason it looks like blood comes from the head is because it's actually coming from chest height AND a little bit further behind.
---
Forgive them, Lord! They know not what they do!

Exactly what I think.

You wouldn’t take it drastically changes the look of the game for the small benefit of fatter enemies. I don’t know if I just can’t relate as I mostly play casual (I got plat way back, like white noise I think???) but this game is gorgeous, and again the Benefit you get it so small; it feels like you’re reaching to crazy lengths to get even the smallest up. Also, why do you play on lowest settings?
---
Posting it there now, thanks.

Agreed. Joining ongoing matches sucks but it has to say. There should definately be renown compensation

My first black ice was for Twitch 417 that’s why I’m so happy that finally I get one for her main weapon
---
Correct. Tick-rate is server-sided and has nothing to do with hitreg which is client-side.
---
Time to get serious!!!
---
My opinion
---
Best: House, Chalet, Yacht, Skyscraper, Coastline, Kafe
---
Worst: Hereford Base (New), Theme Park,  Tower, Favela, Plane.
---
If rainbow six become VR
---
That would be great, but it’s a shame that black ice are only available for the vanilla and Canadian operators
---
How so?
---
can echo still control the drone?
---
I understand sarcasm, you sarcastically imply that Pros have to be garbage if they pick an operator that's not top 3 or top 10. Which stated in the positive sense, you basically said "pros just pick top 10 operators" or precisely they overpick top 10 ops. Which I showed you is false, there are very underpowered operators that pros pick a lot, as well as overpowered ones that pros won't pick almost ever like Blackbeard.
---
I'm trying to argue for the other guy that in fact no, Ash isn't the best or top 3 best ops in the game, because her kit isn't that special and your argument that pros picking her doesn't imply the OP is strong, it just implies that Pros can make her work, like Smoke, like Castle or Clash. Pros pick a lot some very underpowered ops because they synergize with their strategies and all sorts of reasons, they don't just pick the 5 most powerful defenders and the 5 most powerful attackers over and over.
---
I'm not saying Ash is weak, she's just average, there are more useful and more powerful ops. Why is she picked and is she performing, that I explained in the comment above if you cared to read it.
---
If you want to give me a reason why you think Ash is top 10 go on, other than stats. Caveira is considered bad across the board but her stats also show otherwise. Frost and Kapkan are supposed to be bad but somehow they always seem to perform well. What's the deal here? Maybe sometimes stats are more about how an op is used rather than its intrinsic value?
---
Didn't this get posted yesterday or something?

yeah man i think there is a blog post on Ubi's site that says it is literally win/loss and thats all that is involved. pretty disappointing if you have done really well and lost by a round because one of your mates DC.
---
Ash in general, the fact that she has like 5 health left, that her left hand is glitching through her foregrip or she has that look on her face? Or all of the above?
---
Gas him
---
Pretty much all of it

Literally Capitao and IQ are both really good for anything above silver, they both have amazing guns and useful when used right. Especially Cap now with the rework

You might have in game overlay off in the settings of the client
---
It definitely did
---
Well that explains the helmet
---
Are you saying the power of Tachanka comes from a pistol!?!?!
---
Yeah that might be it, usually in plat playing in any rank higher then you gives you more MMR if you win
---
I don't have a very good PC, and I'm not really wanting to go dump a bunch of money into one, either. I've been playing since launch and after 4 years, I'm just burned out. The game has reached an ultimate stagnant state.
---
They are not. I‘ve seen the concept of the new ranked structure and it‘s fanart unfortunately.
---
lmao ok have fun on your console plat 1 which is pretty irrelevant and being butthurt about the recoil and the gun  and why do you think smgs are supposed to be for long range  like the  avarage kill distance in siege is about 10 meters which is really easy to control and btw did i mention getting plat on console means nothing compared to pc
---
10 meters is 10.94 yards
---
Good

What rank are you just wondering

Honestly. It wasnt the worst thing for me because it was my solo account and I had gotten a decent way into plat 3, but my team surrendering dropped me out of plat 3. I got it back the game after but it was still annoying.
---
The fact he's a sloppier lesion doesn't mean he's bad. It's just that why would you ever play Kapkan with lesion on the board? Lesion banned or already picked, Kapkan is...viable. He's not great by any means but not even close to worst

It means something to the players competing? And the fans of those teams.

It's on Ubisoft, since EU comes to our servers because theirs are bad, and then we get unfairly matched
---
Bad idea getting Mav, then. If you wish, then by all means, get him. Else, get base ops first. Thermite should be you next target. You NEED Thermite and Hibana. Those are the two that will work in 90% of the objectives, and while mav is effing brilliant, he isn't a full fledged hard breacher.

I’m not sure that’s correct. I don’t think EU players play NA because EU is ‘bad’. I’ve played countless NA players on EU. Does that mean NA is bad?
---
I seriously don’t understand how so many people can be unaware of the basic concepts of this game. This game is built on 1 shot headshots and destruction, so when you have an operator that fundamentally goes against one of those mechanics it’s always going to be broken no matter how many times you nerf it.
---
Clash is the most annoying thing to attack. Great moves though
---
Glaz's sniper can penetrate 2 surfaces at once, reducing the damage by 25% in total, so that's probably what happened.

The surrender doesn't really work unless you're in a group either. You can easily lose rank by simply losing games and quitting a game every time it looks like your team is about to win, and playing a casual in between abandon penalties.

This is Bartlett university. The reason why you haven’t seen it is because Ubi took it of of both ranked and casual rotation. Bartlett was known to be the most hated and unbalanced map in the game and a lot of people was happy that it’s gone

Huh. What’s sticking with me about this clip is that soft wall angle Mozzie tried (and failed hilariously) to exploit. I’ve played the map many, many times, and shredded about it with a shotgun in a custom match to find vertical angles. But this semi-vertical angle never occurred to me.

---
What's in the gas mask?
---
How so? I can’t see any difference. If there is it’s probably because this clip is old (based on the hud elements) so it may be before they changed the pistols to not go upwards when they shoot so you can aim
---
Guess they figure something out quick, else you'll continue to have lower ranks getting frustrated by him and making weird complaints.
---
Again i dont care you don't need 4K 500 fps too see what's wrong
---
I play on xbox, and its gotten worse over the last couple of weeks.  I am not too great, so I play ranked a lot just so I will be playing people with a similar skill level and to avoid all the TK and toxicity in casual.  I have been seeing more and more TKs in ranked that before.  2 nights ago I was playing and played 3 games straight where some random person would start TKing, and I am not including accidentals here.  We desperately need another metric to attach to players to measure toxicity.  TK or injure teammates? Your score goes down.  Leave a rank when your downed so they dont get a kill and jump right back in the game? Your score goes down.  Vote to kick in casual over and over just so you can hurry up and play?  Score goes down.  If they start matching people based on how close their scores are, pretty soon all the assholes will be playing together and the rest of us can enjoy the game.
---
Imagin putting down a ads when bandit places a battery and you replacing it you see a buck yeet a grenade by you

Or like the april fools event cosmetics

MnK has been OFFICIALLY declared cheating by Ubi and ESL
---
No offense, but your argument has been officially invalidated by the creators of the game itself as well as the organizers of it's tournaments and go4s.
---
What’s hecc
---
Elites definitely give an advantage but Ubisoft hasn’t said they are cheating, therefore I won’t complain about them. However, MnK does give a direct and clear advantage and is deemed cheating. Therefore I have every right to complain about it. It’s especially frustrating, because there isn’t a solution to it at the moment. While hacking is arguably worse, most hackers get banned sooner or later. MnK users, however, get away scotch free every time. You telling me to grow up just shows your ignorance on the subject and lack of understanding on the topic.

---
Here is part of a comment u/its_epi made a while back confirming blood is served sided. 
---
&gt;1.	⁠The fact that you see blood means that the server did receive and accept a shot. If the blood was client-side like before, there’d be a lot more ambiguity: we’d have no idea if the shot information even reached the server let alone if it was registered. To the clear, the blood is server side now, and has been since Y1S4. All blood that you see is the result of the server sending you confirmation of a hit being accepted.
---
&gt;2.	⁠You won’t see blood right away, so the blood can correspond to shots fired from way earlier.  It takes one full round-time-trip, since you locally detect that you hit someone, send it to the server, and wait for the server to send you back confirmation: the higher your ping, the longer before you see blood.  This causes a bit of confusion because it can become difficult to understand which shot the blood corresponds to.  In this case, the blood from the shoulder shot appears as the OP is firing above the head, which may mislead him into believing that it was a headshot.

I think it could work. My only worry is there really isn't much risk when you use the drone aside from the drone getting shot. I guess you could say being on the drone itself is a risk, but I'm not to sure. 
---
Ps, started watching your videos recently, they are lots of fun to watch
---
No it doesn't. If you're not sure don't guess when someone's asking for facts.
---
Suppressors have no effect on recoil other than the opportunity cost of not using a different recoil-mitigating attachment. They can, however, improve the perceived controllability of a weapon by eliminating blinding muzzle flash during sustained fire. 
---
Neither of these are a factor on the TCSG-12, though.
---
Also just saw your name, are you a furry?
---
Make sure to have a good portfolio
---
It sucks but the best thing you can do is put another Mira window next to it and make a kill hole.
---
I'm not sure if it does, but i've had so many frost traps blown up by kapkans. AFAIK it always destroys it(or no kapkans have placed them high on the window). I've actually died a couple times trying to move my traps and getting the window sprayed :(
---
Kapkan and Frost are both close to the 0 delta on the underpicked side.  That means that they have perfectly fine stats.  The reason they don't get picked is that their gadgets rely on the opposing force to uncoordinated and relatively low skill.  Yeah they both work every once in a while in Pro League, but tbh they're both useless against a team with comms.
---
Once you've spotted a single Kapkan trap the odds that you're going to hit someone with one in a coordinated team is low.
---
Frost is a little trickier because she has a good gun and she brings barbwire.  The problem is again, against a coordinated team her gadget is garbage and you have to decide is it worth sacrificing a better gadget on the board in favor of barbwire?  Her ROF is low enough to put her in line with someone like Pulse and he has a tremendously useful gadget/secondary combo.
---
Cav isn't viewed as bads from a stats standpoint at all.  She's firmly in the underpicked too strong delta.  The reason Cav isn't picked is danger.  It is ALMOST never worth it to go for an interrogation against a coordinated team.  You push together and a Cav against two is just a gun in a fight.  If you're just going to have a gun in a fight there are better operators that again, don't sacrifice their gadget.  Valk is the arguable direct replacement for Cav and I would rather have Valk on the board than Cav in every game on the planet.
---
It seems like your operator picks are based on low rank games and casual games.  Look, I suck at the game so I play at a level where Kapkan and Frost get kills.  But I also spend ridiculous amounts of my time watching high level players play, where those operators are a waste.
---
His pistol still does crazy damage
---
I feel like flying drones would give a lot of vertical information gathering power to the offensive side though. What about pulling the drone from Apex's Lifeline and make it to where you have to keep the drone in close proximity to the person being healed?
---
My favorite place is actually below hatches(into obj) or at the tops of stairs. If there's a Hibana blowing the hatch, then it usually obscures the trap, and stairs are the best locations in my experience, they catch the most people.
---
That looks really good.
---
The problem though is sometimes they just rush and take 20 damage instead of getting downed. In casual at least, people love to run the clock down to the last 10-15 seconds.
---
Kind of situational. I would like a drone with a nitro cell taped to it though.
---
I'd been thinking of a Doc-like attacker for awhile, someone with a crossbow like Capitao's which had two kind of darts -- a poison dart and a healing dart.
---
Poison would probably need to be AoE though since, if you can shoot someone -- why not shoot them with your gun? But that's probably too similar to Capitao's fire, then.

Why do these get upvotes? Why is it on my homepage? How do i make it so i only get Rainbow Six Siege related content and not this bullshit
---
lol I was waiting for someone to call that out XD
---
I hear mixed things, some say he’s now useless, others say he’s better because most people don’t have the reaction to stop moving in time, so anyone not already standing still gets at least 1 ping, so he like a safer Jackal. I haven’t played him yet personally since his change. I should try him out and see how well he works for me.
---
lol this happens to me so often.
---
Inspired by a conversation with a friend, I decided to take a shot at imagining what a new GIGN attacker would look like. A brief description of the gadget goes as follows; The R.I.C.B.D (Remote Initiated Circular Breaching Device) is a deployable single use remote activated gadget which functions as so. When standing upright and applied to a soft wall the device will silently and instantaneously cut out medium sized vault-hole. If deployed on soft wall while crouched the device will instead create a regular sized crouch-hole and if deployed on a soft floor the device will cut completely through the surface, essentially creating a man-sized hatch to floor below. Fissure has three of these devices. An alternate version of this image can be found here https://imgur.com/a/PSdP0Gj.
---
I mean yeah that's the thing, you would essentially be in a 4v5 when \[Ambulance\] is on his drone.   
---
And you also sacrifice having another gadget that can push into site if you pick this.
---
Everyday we stray further from god
---
thats extremely unbalanced, if you send the dog and he dies its so easy to kill the person who killed the dog. plus if they're in an area the dog would chase the person and lead you right to them.
---
And his name is Mario, he has a red hat and is a THICC BOI
---
Ty!
---
So you are saying that the enemies literally having bigger heads is placebo? Nice. The rest is preference
---
Agreed. I don’t think her drone should be nearly as translucent as the current iterations of Yokais and Gu mines. But still rather difficult to see unless you are specifically looking for it/wary of its presence. Giving her only one drone would also balance with her stealth functions.
---
Also agreed that I think the iteration of her being spotted and her image fragmentation would probably be the most difficult part to add to the game.
---
I also like the thought of having thermal cloaking. If this were to be added, I’d say 3 armor only. Both for balance and lore purposes.
---
There is a lot of intel being thrown around on both sides of the game, and it’s time to add more disruptions to their gathering. Cav, vigil, and to a different extent Dokk are good starts, but more should be added
---
Feels bad, any op you’d recommend on defense for someone who likes to play Jackal/valk? I tried Mira for a while but never really liked her
---
I've done it before. I died because I'd recently changed sensitivity and went to go change it in the settings double hit X and I'd accidentally left the game. Obviously I rejoined instantly. Shit happens
---
As buggy as this game can be at times, I don't think it's a good idea to take the reconnect option away if someone leaves the match intentionally. Audio or visual glitches happen, and sometimes you've got to leave and rejoin to fix them. 
---
Besides that, stopping someone from rejoining after selecting leave game won't stop true idiots from favoring their K/D over the team. You'll have people closing the application after stepping in a frost mat, which would be costly to their team (who may not even know the guy who quit).
---
but can I use a Maz shooter one and a cronusmax
---
I'm considering it the way this game is headed.
---
FOOKING LAZER SIGHTS
---
When you die randomly but the kill cam shows the other person seeing you for a solid 5 seconds before turning the corner when in reality it's not much like that
---
i still deal with the bug of falling through a hatch forever. this has been a thing since before health and the only difference its that the transition is somehow smoother
---
You just described capitao's first concept

There's a new mode, it's called "no noobs". Lmao
---
That must mean that losing 1-4 is above average for you ^/s
---
It happens, don’t know how but it happens. Plus kills don’t exactly matter. So long as you get the guy out of the round is all that matters.
---
Everything will bounce if you throw it hard enough
---
Definitely a one stim per drone kinda deal I think. Multiple drones if you want though.
---
It’s like Ubisoft knows
---
He took out the air filters and replaced them with tea bags. Now whenever he wants tea, he just sucks in some boiling water and shakes his head a bit.
---
You should win a spawn peek battle the majority of the time.  Every now and then you might be caught off guard from a spot you didn't previously know or something, but it really is your own fault.  Learn from it and adapt to it.
---
Smurfs are destroying casual an console. I can’t tell you how many level 18s play like they’re plats, which I know because despite being a fucking bronze casual decides that plate and diamonds make the game fair.
---
Haha good one :P
---
Oh yeahyou are right, that's what I meant to say actually.
---
Are you actually facing players with MnK or are you just being beaten by players better than you
---
In game, the slide moves so fast you can’t see it, the difference is very subtle
---
THAT HIP FIRE THO
---
Nope
---
Ubisoft needs to take notes from Overwatch and clean up their community. The team killing and voting to kick to make the initiator feel better about their own incompetence is getting old.
---
I cant tell you how many times I've solo queued, been and defense, and my entire team dies so it's a 1v5, and I just get kicked.
---
It’s still beta... **hes still overpowered**
---
Ubi keeps taking it down cause its technically a bug ill post it on the tts reddit
---
I can confirm what he's saying, it's happened to me a good number of times.
---
These are sign of ping not connection.
---
Gary Webb, investigative reporter found with two shots in his head and his death was ruled a suicide.
---
I would want to TK so bad
---
I still miss the Ol’ SMG11 ACOG...
---
Haha 對啊
---
Taiwan NO.1
---
lllllllllllllllllll has been banned by BattleEyeTM
---
Not even on console... all they do is give your position away
---
is he using windows insider Programm  it fucks with battle eye and can keep you from playing
---
Just abuse the Kaid bug.
---
Maybe this guy can also revive teammates back to 50hp? (Not with the drone of course)
---
This is the first time it's ever happened, which is sort of why I'm here posting about it. PS4 Slim, been playing since White Noise. It's not like it was just me, I was with a few friends, we all had the same situation, full freeze.
---
People saying it’s because you’re on WiFi could be right but are mostly incorrect. I play wired (always have) and stay around 9 ping with no problems until last update. Now I lag non stop and have this yellow plug constantly on my screen. Same for my friends we believe it’s the siege servers.

Same with me on Xbox I solo queued to gold 4 and I’m level 200 because of mnk and booters

this is old. like really old
---
I really don't know why the UI interface starts giving me micro stutter after some games or going in and out of every operator loadout.

shitter

I don't have any plans to sell these right now, but you can find the STLs to print them yourself on my Thingiverse account: https://www.thingiverse.com/miking/designs
---
Yea it was a pocket sniper
---
This looks like one of those game demos, where a dev is playing but moving in slow motion and looking around everywhere to show off the game
---
Thank u just have to finish make my 3D printer from chrismas
---
Anyone else from the Alpha/Beta days?
---
Are you eu? Also yeah it did start getting worse around the time of the update
---
Thx for the tips, will try them out for sure
---
Lmaooo idk if that's a bad thing
---
What/who are u talking about?
---
Nah cos my ping is grand. It’s just the yellow plug and a bit of rubber banding
---
I'd say Omega soldiers from Blood Dragon
---
Why u phone record?!?!
---
*3 piece* 👀
---
Jk nice clutch
---
how tf do you join back in? anytime I leave on purpose or because of some lag/Internet issue it bans me instantly for "abandon sanction" 
---
The game has never given me an option to rejoin
---
Ur just shit commando is really good and the things u said have been fixed for a while
---
Still fairly new at the game and haven't done a lot of PvP, aside from a few casual matches. Twice there were some teammates on voice chat giving me a few tips during the match and I was thankful for it. Other than that I've been team killed, cursed at in chat and yelled at in voice chat, which is why I'm reluctant to do PvP. It's not that it I feel bullied, but that I actually want to have a fun time and chill with some friends in casual and the amount of insanity some players have makes it awful
---
It was literally nerfed in January
---
I kinda feel like you didn't... I kindaa feel like you don't know what a shitpost is. you see its not a literal shit-post, maybe look it up again I think you may have spelt it wrong
---
Damage drop off has already been done and adjusted. The pistol already has been adjusted with recoil as well. Don’t let them sneak up on you and it’s really not an issue
---
One second
---
You need to get fairly close with cav to kill people, so if you cant roam well you cant get close due to being caught out, decent cavs are scary though
---
Reload animation is so cool though
---
She’s not a healer. The only heal she does is when she revives someone. Every other instance is just a temp 20 hp.
---
I don’t like the points system that r6 has implemented because it would happen to me all the time. I’d win 2 games and get to say gold 4 from silver 1 and the lose a game due to bad teammates and be back where I started. I gave up
---
Im not talking operators, im talking about the bugs in there game that need to be fixed and i'm trying to bring attention to those and put a little more priority on fixing their bugs instead of the new ops.
---
There are rifle shields for semi-automatic rifles and sniper rifles, however there is nothing like the plexiglass lookin shit BB uses, most rifle shield are too heavy to walk with so that why they are used in these Semi-automatic rifles

You should play ranked, you’ll get destroyed in your first placements but after you do you be matched with people with the skill as you and you’ll improve much more than just playing casual
---
I’ve been getting 5 points and losing 25
---
Yep. Get used to it.
---
I have the same question, got mozzie a day ago and i’m just switching between the guns not knowing which one is better. Currently I like the Roni because it’s so simple and the sight is cool, but all my friends say to use the Commando. Any mozzie mains out there to help me out?
---
I’m nearly level 300 but I haven’t had matchmaking this bad before.
---
I can deal with TK and toxicity in casual. It’s common but not sustainable, so it’s not really a game ruiner for me. Plus The amount of stupidity in casual (usually by platinum MnK smurfs), occasionally warrants the TK. Also if They are MnK without a doubt, I TK them. MnK smurfs on the other hand, I encounter every game, and they absolutely ruin the game. Pretty much every casual game I play is an MnK, typically smurf or boosting.
