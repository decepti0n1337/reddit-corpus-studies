---
It's not a realistic scenario for a group in a custom game to mess around and kill hostage? Have you ever played with friends before?
---
It’s funny bc butt n jojo
---
Because putting a laser on someone's head and then quickly ads and fire isn't string at all. They basically became the equivalent of BB with a better shield and shittier guns.

Oh that’s a good idea. Never though about that
---
And then your teammate leaves, forcing you to pay a 4v5. That shit pissed me off the most.
---
This is why I stopped playing Ranked on Xbox.
---
But even yesterday, we were DoSed in both Unranked and Casual. One guy even had 'destroying servers since 2003' as his name if you clicked on his gamertag. 3 of them had Guy Fawkes masks as profile picture, absolute fucking losers.
---
Sort of. I also forgot to mention watch out if its opened by a teammate becuz you can get killed from attackers
---
Why would they do that tho
---
legendary bait
---
Why would they do that
---
Yeah I viewed frame by frame.. you shot from his left shoulder across to his right.
---
His operator icon.
---
I know. 
---
But I just lost my shit about being DDOSed in goddamn Casual (who the fuck does that?!?!) so I posted a long complaint on r/xboxone to try and draw a bit of attention to the issue.
---
Oh
---
Yeah, that was until Burnt Horizon but were only up to Velvet Shell headgears
---

Are you a moron or did you just bang your head really hard today?

Do u Play with mnk? Or is it just high sensitivity?

Ok I guess I’ll get both since they are only 10000 renown

Sometimes they have an angle on someone and die or the enemy leaves as they open it

With how much of an issue mav was for being silent, you'd think people would be okay with loud gadgets.

Why waste 25 seconds of our time on you running around? Trim the clip.

That spot is always funny for claymores kill though.

I don't mind when it's mere seconds. The problem is when we're over a minute and there is still loading going on.

---
Same thing happened to me with kapkan. This I like the new pop socket
---
It could be worse

The real question is who detonates nitro cells as soon as they land? The point of using them is to wait until the right time to get a kill.

---
Oh i havent got the update
---
People are banning them in ranked too. F for season pass owners.
---
After 3 minutes your chances of getting into a game is the chance of pewdiepie losing 50 million subs
---
Excuse me what
---
Thanks!
---
Yup. I mind less about the banning at least it's not just pure stupidity.
---
High sensitivity
---
What are you on about? Lol
---
I respect you opinion however here's my take. 
---
&gt;They're abilities are overall useless and more of a disadvantage and a nuisance than anything else to the team. 
---
I disagree
---
&gt;Amaru uses her hook to go up to a window or hatch and just die instantly
---
Those people are using her wrong I've taken teams completely by surprise with her ability she's so quick at scaling buildings that she is a perfect counter to run outs and peakers on some maps because she can get to the roof before the defenders can.
---
You have to use her smart and it's going to take people time to learn how to do that.
---
&gt;and almost all the time she takes the defuser and ends up being the reason the team lost.
---
This is not a problem on hostage or secure area plus the defuser can be dropped and handed off to a new person.
---
&gt;Her ability not only makes the game more annoying to play, but also does not fit in with what Rainbow Six Siege is generally about.
---
How is this the case? This is a tactical shooter game, grapple hooks are a very believable and useful gadget compare that to the near magic tracking of Jackal or the silent step abilities of Nokk and Cav. Just because you don't like it or because people don't know how to use it does not mean it does not fit in the game.
---
&gt;Goyo is also another liability that should be removed. His Volcan Shield is just more reason why playing hostage is horrible, along with fuze being notorious for killing the hostage, now we have another operator that does it more effectively and with no consequences to Goyo unless he himself shoots or melees the shield.
---
He's only a liability if played wrong it's simple don't use him on cramped hostage maps, also don't place the vulcans sheild any where near the hostage. Side point if the attackers are trying to recover a hostage alive booby trapping the hostage adds a new element to the tactics see it preventing attackers spraying in the rooms since doing so could kill the hostage.
---
&gt;In unranked and ranked playlists I almost always see Goyo get banned and when I play casual, anyone that picks him is either team killed or vote kicked, or they end up killing one of his teammates or himself.
---
This just can't be helped. The same happened to leigon. 
---
&gt;Overall I think the general idea of Goyo and Amaru were neat, but they need to be removed or at least nerfed.
---
This is never going to happen tbf.
---
&gt;but they need to be removed or at least nerfed. Given, I don't know how you would nerf Amaru
---
Some people are asking for a buff to her to allow her to grapple to more locations or to draw a weapon faster after grappling. So I doubt a nerf is coming anytime soon.
---
&gt;Goyo needs to just be removed without second though. Give the good people that got the season pass some renown in compensation for the changes and just do away with them. 
---
Why? Just because you and some people don't like him/can't use him effectively doesn't mean other can't. Deleting a character that people have paid real money for just isn't gonna happen.
---
I'm sure Amaru and Goyo will be deleted from ranked and unranked untill the next ops come out and are subsequently banned for a season.
---
Because it was stale. The sites were all held/attacked in the same way, hence why it was removed. It’s not like the map was bad or uncompetitive, it’s the most competitive map in the game.
---
Grenade ashcharge zofia if you knock someone into it with a nomad charge lol multiple ways
---
Had this happen to me the other night on PC. It was a high silver/low gold game so I can't imagine it was anyone in our game. I don't know much about servers so someone please correct me if Im wrong, but I assume that the servers Ubi uses host multiple matches at once, so if someone starts stressing the server like this would it affect all the games taking place on it?
---
Explosives innit
---
Impacts and shotguns are for making holes. Nitro cells are for damage, or for blowing a hole in a wall while you hide around the corner.
---
Hope they change it back
---
Chalet is big bad.
---
The song got me disappointed. Why you gotta do that to roundabout?
---
I think I read the same thing 4 hours ago already
---
You can buy it in the shop but its like 20000
---
No I got that update yesterday. Early this morning there was a small patch I guess.
---
Only if they actually buff him like they promised back in Y2
---
Kinda lol
---
I have never met someone who likes new Hereford
---
When I get ddossed, they stress it only just enough so that we cant move on attack and cant prep for the round. We always lose elo and they gain it. Really sucks
---
First day of the new season I was doing my placement games and I was on coastline. This random picked amaru and instantly grappled into penthouse (which was an objective). We somehow won that round but I can’t say it went well for him
---
4
---
Your first comment doesn't make too much sense tbh. Just don't get banned?
---
Cool, you’ve been bad since the beginning
---
Mouf fuxk* FTFY
---
Honestly I think the map is way better than before and the defenders have to run further to get an angle on you. So you have more time to pre-aim the spots once you know where they are.
---
I enjoy it, might also be nostalgia value as it was the first map I ever learned well.

You should try the kids dorms on oregon. So few people sit in there (maybe 1 or 2) so if you can get up there then you have good control instantly if they are defending top floor.

---
Yep
---
Thank you, at least someone gives a shit about artist's effort.
---
Its painstakingly annoying. If you really want multiple ops, you're going to have to copy and paste the little logo multiple times over until you have as many as your heart desires.
---
He could have taken much more.
---
It's mostly subjective, but I've found it easier to land them
---
Get dunked on 🤣
---
:O
---
1) Buy the Season Pass
---
Or
---
2) Don't play Ranked for a week
---
Either one is a viable option is it upsets you that much.
---
Removing RNG like elements only helps a competitive game.
---
The majority of people wanted these nerfs and I think they're right with doing it.
---
i know they can be shot safely but I'm sure i wouldn't think long enough at that moment.
---
From what I know, only orange tier headgear's are exclusive to alpha packs.
---
A map selection could be a bad idea as you might have people playing just one map constantly and honing their strats to a razors edge. Maybe the ability to deselect 2 or 3 maps would work better.
---
ah I never noticed that.
---
If you look closely between some of the screen changed,you see a garage.
---
Pretty sure it’s been known for a while tho
---
I was wondering if Ubisoft was going to continue making those. The ending seemed to be left open.

Wow

The level designers be like hey watch this...

Is your monitor vsync compatible?

Instead of running away, you’re approaching me?

Yeah second your on attack, idk how they can’t tell this is going on when everyone’s ping shoots up by thousands

Why do i hear meglovania?
---
That's a load of shit. Just when I bought a season pass too.... This is bullshit.
---
If you don't wanna buy the ops don't, nobody is forcing you to, I have enough renown to unlock both of them and I'm going to because I want to have all the operators whether they're strong or not
---
Cav do be having a phat ass ngl
---
You realize that's not ubi doing anything? all they did was pay a production company to make a video.

They COULD do that again as many times as they want?

Have you tried locking your game to 60 fps in the game itself?
---
I'm glad I wasnt the only person who thought this!
---
I like to drone where I'm about to yeet into. One match defenders were at bunk and kids room on Oregon and I droned B site and only smoke was trying to peak out. I quickly got him then flung into site. They were not expecting to meet an enemy when they came back into the room. It was great.
---
Spanish Civil war. Her grandmother fought for the republican side of the war, which were loyal to the queen of Spain.
---
Those are the TK penalties not the abandon. Also they no longer do the 15m, it starts at 30m.
---
It's been bad on PC too! The game just lags horribly, when I played at release it took 3-4 minutes to find a game, first casual match never loaded to the point everyone in the server had to force quit, and the menus felt horribly sluggish too.
---
Those are the TK bans, The abandon penalties details are not released.
---
It’s sooo annoying . What’s the solution here? Are you on Xbox too?
---
So when old Kanal was still a thing you saw a ship with containers (found in west spawn) leaned over, almost about to fall. If you shot an explosive into the crates, you can hear someone inside it.
---
Ah yes

Fuze and Jäger
---
Ok

How do you not understand it? Weapon skins, uniform, charm, elite animation and black mirror skin

You want him to explain how a bug is in the game?

lmao

But the shotgun why does she have it twice? That’s the real question
---
I really hope Zofia’s pov isn’t around this sub...
---
We cant get rid of RNG completely. Nerfing shield hipfire cone didnt intend to get rid of RNG, but they just adjusted probability.
---
I call her female Rico Rodriguez becaise grappling hook.
---
You must not winned a lot of matches 😤
---
/s
---
She's basically like another Maverick. Maverick is best played as a flanker. I've found the most success flanking with her then using her grapple to escape when needed.
---
Woah my friend mains fuze and I main jager nice!

Or or orrr... t-t-today junior!

Secondary and primary, I get it’s the same model used there but that’s what they meant

I didn’t know, thx for telling me tho
---
I mean, he looks like a DDoser since you cannot be in Diamond with stats like that unless you got carried by a bunch of other diamonds.
---
They reduced solo renown because people were doing that AFK exploit where they left THunt on and went to bed etc. So instead of actually fixing the issue, they punished everyone
---
You didn’t mention the keyboard and mouse players in every lobby
---
yeah if you just try to rush into the obj room any operator will die. 
---
Amaru is there to get into other rooms thats near or even on the otherside of the map to quickly get into and take control over the room or cut off rotations while the team tracks down the deep roamers.
---
I can’t tell who this is directed towards
---
If me:tf I do
---
If op:yes
---
Maverick and Doc
---
imagine being a cav main
---
The Super Nova because when you connect people go flying after hit. But the SAS is in my opinion the best shotgun in the game currently.
---
Oh that's great. It means I can keep an eye on a blitz or Monty from a distance and not get headshot within an instant.

ngl that’s pretty spooky to just turn around and have someone fly through the window and kick you in the face

Ha
---
Oh i get ya. Yeah, only half read your comment.
---
Just googled it and realized I missed something
---
I feel like half my amarus forget they can go up hatches
---
No problem,have a good one :).
---
Good for you man, I rarely ace
---
Yea, only seasonal uniforms
---
why would you say something so confidently about a game you haven't played in years
---
My guy’s flexing the night version of the lobby screen XD
---
I’m going to agree that the LMG is the way to go. It offers a large clip for preferring after rushing / flanking. Her secondary shotty works great for hatches and or opening walls up.
---
Tough question. I recently ran hibanas supernova and I thought it was great, but bc of the SAS m590a1 it’s a hard decision to make.
---
You're not alone, I can totally relate to scenarios like these.
---
April fools pack skin.
---
Once you get a solid playstile you will get many kills
---
Ah a man of culture
---
Love that you noticed it!
---
My showcase ops are Blitz and Mozzie, just because. But my mains are Zofia/Nøkk and Rook/Smoke
---
Keep loosing matches, the matchmaking will match you with and against people who also tend to loose matches.
---
You can't really expect the matchmaking to instantly adapt to your "new" skill level.
---
This game is not going to last 10 years
---
When did they say that? I hadn’t read any backstory since release, but I thought that was nokk’s whole thing, not knowing what the gender was
---
I always main Ash on defense!
---
Blitz is one of my top operadores on time played, but i suck with smoke
---
I guess the variety of Ops I play us the reason why haven't got my own style. I main those who I mentioned but I play most of them, except the Lord and Pulse, I suck with Pulse haha
---
That means someone on your team is doing it lol

Goyo Shield is broken when it comes to kill credit

Are you talking about Echo? Or lesion? I can’t tell!

Holy shit props to you.  Cant even imagine playing this with a Wii remote

They only really needed it for blitz. Monty you could tell he was getting ready for it. Blitz was a cunt because you have a headshot lined up and you could still get headshot by him before your shot was available. 
---
I even started prefiring his head when he went for ads and still lost. So yeah.
---
He's a lot of fun but the problem with key operators is that if you make a mistake you'll pay a lot for your mistakes.

Yup. I once argued that atomic and nuclear bombs are technically a moral item (ironically) because it alone prevented WW3 during the Cold War era and any other direct conflict between major powers. Sure they still fight indirectly, through proxies, or small scale (ie. India v Pakistan) but that's still less war than another world war or 2.
---
And ya Hiroshima and Nagasaki are bad but if the war continued the death toll would've been much higher and still include some civilians (albeit obviously a lot fewer). Not to mention the Soviets getting part of Japan would've caused a huge problem and even more deaths (+ another front to spark up an actual war)
---
Ps4?
---
Me when Hibana or Valk gets banned
---
Apart from Black Ice, yes it definitely is. 
---
Atleast in my opinion.
---
that is mostly because the majority of hatches are against a wall and you have to aim the grapple at the non walled side of a hatch which is rather awkward and exposed when in a building already.
---
Great job!
---
Turn that frown upside down

I think it is an Considerable idea, especially looking at the possible new meta. If the Deployable Shield meta is gonna be a thing, vertical play will be more efficient so having someone denying that (so the meta keeps on evolving) is a neat idea. But I would make changes to your loadout. 
---
Weapons:
---
I would not add an Auto shotty, these sometimes no other option when it comes to vertical play because of them having a spammy style of play (looking at you ela and alibi). A pump shotty like smokes one seems to fit perfect because i feel those are more balanced and require more skill for vertical gameplay. As an SMG the operator should need something balanced between RPM, Damadge and Recoil. I think a Gun that kicks a bit would balance things out. I even would consider a new gun like the SR-635 . A hefty thing like the 416-C or Commando 9 but higher rpm and less Damadge. 
---
Speed: Conrtoversial. Could fit everything really, that’s a all ubi decision but 3 speed is to much. Also depends on how you want to be this operator anchor vertical play counter  or Roaming verticalplay Counter. Due to rainbow adding many 3 armors lately i would go for 2 speed 2 armor. 
---
Now this could be an interesting operator and a good addition to team six. Now the most unimportant thing: which country gender and so on. So this should be a girl from Scotland knowing sledge or so, this could add up to some funny lore actually.
---
Aren't they out now? I saw them in the shop today
---
I believe the original plan was to have headgears and uniforms for a year set to only be available for that year only --- that's the route it looked like they were taking. I kinda wish they'd stuck with it, because I agree it's a cash grab now, and I really think uniforms and headgears should remain until the season pass year is over to be honest.
---
All good, its good to be skeptical about stuff like this. My friend has a loud keyboard, I was using Discord.

I agree

Nice shot

for real? imma go check

[Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/UyfUhIY.png)

Regardless the gun still has great range. I find that i can kill a target with like 2-3 shots from ranges that other shotguns would struggle at

Having the same issue too, no solution yet.
---
Using anything on Console except a controller is cheating. 
---
And using anything except M&amp;KB or a controller on PC is also using third party software and therefore cheating. 
---
That’s why most of the people that make those videos use a new/fake account to avoid getting their actual one banned.
---
Then that's all they need to do to fix it. I don't get why they even allow killing the hostage.
---
Nor microsoft. If people can DDoS one xbox game, whats to stop them from doing this in any game? Is R6S uniquely vulnerable?

***( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)***
---
Finally a legendary charm that is actually good
---
The defender sounds like a super overpowered operator with a global ability, not gonna lie
---
I made points bc it wasnt readable
---
 maybe you should play more r6 than the other games (I know, it's the opposite of what I said before)
---
• try solo q it's a very hard and atrocious experience but try it, and try to keep cool bc sometimes you'll have great mates, but most of the time you'll have toxic guys who can't understand that you want to improve your skills and scream or insult you (solo q is hell at low levels), and there is unranked mode now that's great to solo q without losing rank
---
• if you play with your friends ask them what is/are your weakness(es), ask them what could you do to change these.
---
• try things : rushes (use your brain, not "oh I'll go on obj as fast as possible without droning etc.), angles, position...
---
• write or memorize why you died, why your team lost this round, and if you lose a round or a game, don't think about it, think about the next one
---
Same here man!!
---
If they made an example out of a few people it might help. Being banned doesnt stop many people from griefing, but a felony charge certainly might.
---
Must be a widespread issue, not seen it mentioned before, apologies

Why not ? Doing scenes like this does not have to be CGI all the time . Plus , I would also do that if comic style saves money and does the similar artistic effect at the same time .
---
Yep, go to ur favorite op and at the bottom it says showcase operator
---
That's why I went broke I had to buy lots of blood orchids before they stopped that some ops look so good in black, Kapkan, IQ,. Bandit, Call ect.
---
i was using it all night but idk if i can use it well since im not that well of a player haha. still extremely happy about it though
---
Re-uploading tomorrow.
---
Same thing happening to my friend. Came here to see if it was the new update or not. Seems like it is
---
whel shes loud and has a ferry long ads time that gives enemys enough time to react if they just added more places for her it would be good enough or forget aboit that and just speed up the ads time

Yeah, honestly would be much better without random flashing/movement, just the two pictures.

My game has frozen twice at the beginning of the two ranked matches I have tried once at op selection and once at the spawn point selection. I had to alt + tab out and end siege then rejoin. I want to play more but not if it will cost my team to be a man down at the start of the game. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also it has only happened in ranked. I warmed up with t hunt and then played an unranked game first and had no problems. I'll try t hunt and casual tomorrow.

Dammit! Not you too

i think impacts give him a lot more utility as an anchor added with his evil eye, but having a shield would be nice

There's something else to this story then cause when the servers lags as per above vid. It is because some one is attacking the server, that someone would be in the game and deliberately sabotaging it for an easy win

*pillar men theme plays*
---
Only for fun usually play holo on him i usually play aggressive with him
---
What are we supposed to be looking at
---
I upvoted for kenobi
---
Sometimes
---
His ability seems like for really coordinated teams he could be great but for normal play he’s a bit of a liability to his own team. No one else has a gadget that can be used to kill their own team this effectively besides Mira, and for Mira you have to be behind the shield, with goyo all you need is a grenade
---
Everybody knows you run faster with a knife
---
Sweet
---
Oh wow, how did I forget Rook? Thanks for pointing it out. It seems Ubisoft doesn't care about balancing anyone. I get there shield rework made them "OP", but seriously? Why take them from the main anchors?

Castel would be ez buffed by just simple nor allowing the drones comming through the ground so the barricade hits the ground
---
I'm definitely not getting that in casual and unranked.  I haven't played any ranked yet cause I want to get the reworked Kanal down first but it could make some sense in ranked since higher ranked players are going to be back down closer to your MMR to start the season and it'll be a little before they're back up where they belong...  I guess if unranked has its own separate hidden MMR then it could make sense there too since everyone would be starting at the same MMR right now.

No. Reverse planting is a known part of the game. I’ve placed it further outside the obj than this guy did and I had no issues. Reverse planting has been a thing since day one

Of course The DDOSer is so bad all he knows how to do is abuse Monty 😂
---
I actually agree. Ranked is UNPLAYABLE on PS4 atm.
---
I usually spray from left to right. But hey, to each their own.

"Lots of options" I think there's a lot of other operators I'd rather my team mates take than Montagne or Blitz, it's effectively  a 4v5 with them

Quality meme.
---
ACOG abuse? And QE spam was used by ALL the sweaty blitz mains?
---
I was (I'm assuming) DDOSED two of my placement matches in a row. Pretty salty after that. What really got me was being DDOSED 45 seconds into the first match of a casual.
---
I mean, I can understand the dirty incentive of DDOSING when you're losing a ranked, maybe even a casual... But doing it before a match even kicks into gear makes no sense to me.
---
exactly, it sucks, my game has crashed for 4 out of my 6 placement matches

I thought I comment on this topic I normally wouldn’t go a head and teach people this but sometimes you need to fight back.
---
If some ddoss the server your best trick is to ddos the server to crash.
---
The simple way to ddos is the following:
---
-Download an arp spoof - 100s out there spoof your ps4 arp address to your computer - important to ensure it’s cabled to your router. You can do via wireless but can be problematic
---
-download wireshark - filter via ps4 IP address - there are ip pullers that make filtering easier but wireshark is perfect packet capturing tool
---
-proceed to a stress test website
---
Run a test using the ip and port pulled this will stress the server
---
If you do this whole they doing it should stress the server enough to crash it
---
As an Ela main I’d say Ela
---
A looooot of losses, trust me, I’m an expert
---
My friend has long load times like 15 sec but it doesnt seem to matter to anyone and thats good
---
I mean, I'd  rather a capitao or Zofia rather than a Montagne, brings way more utility ?
---
Cuz he didn't realize it hit glass fast enough cuz most people just kinda spam the nitro cell button and its usually to late if u mess up
---
yeah, its unplayable rn
---
Nice
---
It is now. They are awful. Completely unusable.
---
Ubi punishing people for allowing someone to cheat against them actually seems pretty par for the course.
---
Ah damn wtf
---
I get that, but you should be level 120+
---
I've never paid for cosmetics but i would give my money for this
---
I’m really new to game still under 70 hours. Why is this skin always talked about? I received like 3-4 of them already, they are not Legendary or so super rare.

---

This is insanely cool I want to run around kanal as the predator!!!
---
Wait for the coppers to come in not realizing a well placed mira can ward off an entirety of an enemy push and access to the obj, even if no one is there.
---
I still can't get over the assbackward positioning of red dots vs magnified optics on guns in this game lol...It almost makes the left side look as ridiculous as the right. 
---
Almost.
---
Get the Ella flair.
---
Montagne is the operator who is designed to draw fire from his teammates and can act as an essentially a reinforced wall in doorways he has utility but he and other shield operators need support
---
QE spam needs to be removed from the game. Screw whoever uses that crutch.
---
Phantom sight was pretty cool, but let's not forget impatient Mozzie in burnt horizon, and his finger gun
---
Never said Attack Weapons sucked.   
---
However most of the time defenders gadgets are placed during prep phase where you anticipate the enemy. Attacker gadget get more freedom, more opportunites to be exploited compared to Defenders.
---
  
---
take ying and fuze. place their gadget in a specific position then rotate and possibly get a better angle on your opponents.   
---
Defender cannot do that kind of flanking when attempting to regain back control. Prizma cannot really be used here nor Evil eyes if not placed in good spots.
---
You do have good weapons on defence, with Echo MP5SD or Vigil K1A.
---
It’s starting to think
---
It just happened to me too

I see what you’re saying but it was my solo queuing that got my to gold 4 last season and to gold 3 this season. My friends don’t really enjoy ranked as much as I do which is why I find myself solo queuing so often.

Ying is fun, but is normally hated (you know why). ela is fun but her smg is booty. As a Hibana main I would say Hibana. Already have her? Make a new acc and get her again
---
Absolutely but it's  way better than what it used to be, crouch spamming was arguably worse just because how easy it was to spam that
---
I would have to agree with you there ela is insanely fun and useful and can make getting to the objective insanely terrifying.
---
I havent been playing much recently. But I don't think Ive had that problem unless I have something like Discord open. So normally I play with Discord closed.
---
I like Smoke's night owl headgear with the corresponding uniform. I love the glowing eyes, especially in the victory screen.

Great, now go to ubisoft support and if they confirm thw highest playtime on both defend and attack is recruit, they will give you the flair.

Wdym? They nerfed her smg into the ground a while ago, unplayable for me to kill anyone past 4 meters.
---
Why tho
---
r/unbiigbbiitita fuck I give up
---
I mean theres aspects about it I like but it looks too gothy in my opinion, if she looked more like she does in OP's art I would love it.
---
It looks a lot like the R6 Invitational skin but it’s obviously not that. I’d say it’s an exclude Raleigh skin.
---
Going with a realism element here:
---
- you blew open the hatch, and the game audibly gives you a deafening blast to your ears (as evidenced by the high pitched sound post explosion) 
---
- even the gun shots coming your way are muffled
---
I get you want to be able to hear footsteps, but if this is actually happening there’s no god damn chance you’re hearing a Frost coming. There’s also potential she was crouched and moving slowly before encountering you.

I chose those two, except the exact opposite skins! Gave bb his play time skin and the lord his Russian Tsar skin!
---
People say blitz is for supporting teammates, so they say hes finally at the good point. But ironically the reason ubisoft buffed him to 2 speed was to be aggressive, as you can read it from Op Chimera patchnote.
---
Not to my knowledge
---
No because i play with full five stack
---
He might’ve been there to watch, I mean, you immediately attacked him without any sign that he was going to attack you.

I love it lol ive always hated shields in this game
---
ah right. i keep forgetting about the destructive potential in r6. coming from a background in minecraft, fortnite (back when it was good), and apex legends, it's easy to forget that a pulse can see and shoot you through the floor
---
Looks like that guy in the film full metal jacket
---
yeah just saying if the explosions shot forward, would make more sense for a defense op... rather than blowing inward where you and your mates are holding site... its a bit dumb.
---
I do read the patch notes and dev blogs for your information, my problem is how vague they can be when they release stuff like this. It could be 1-3 months before they release another post regarding this which is ridiculous
---
Ubisoft: we have disabled reloading.
---
I wish they also changed the music on the op selection screen, it's so nice this season.

ight thanks

Oh nvm, must have missed it

---
I tried to shoot goyo gadget from side angle it didn't work whatsoever. Has anybody tried that yet ? Please enlighten me
---
Im not saying he is hacking dude and im not talking about the hipfire did u see the ADS shots ?
---
I think it has its own.  I've been looking everyone up in some of my unranked games cause I was curious and if it's using ranked MMR then it must not be very populated today which I highly doubt.  I finished Phantom Sight gold 3 but have had a lot of platinums and some diamonds in my unranked matches.  I've got seven wins, two losses so far(with a 1.74, hey maybe I need to find some higher ranks to play with lmfao) and the higher ranks are getting even more common so that again makes me think it has its own.
---
Of course this is all speculation based on my experience so far, I don't know if they ever actually said whether it goes by casual, ranked, or has its own.  So take this for what it's worth, which is diddly poo if Ubi has said how it works.
---
after 26:46 did it and it's on 3 and a half now

Gotta love the attacker having a platnium charn from last season too. Doubt he got that legit.

"You was poppin off that good shit a second ago! Then you got KICKED IN YO CHEST!"

The even worst part is that those same people are not hacking but are using mouse and keyboard which is cheating anyway.

Wish to see such a ban wave on consoles too...
---
God I loved Chimera. The soundtrack was the best imo, so dark.

And just how the fuck do you plan on finding out whose doing it to drop a felony charge on
---
They have dedicated servers. Hell, when you launch a custom game it's a dedicated server
---
knifed a blitz the other day and he knifed me while his shield was back
---
*laughs in black ice and white noise*
---
Cant find anything for it that they have dedicated servers, Im sure they have not, as always a client is the server.
---
Never heard about it.
---
Hol up, you dont get them?
---
Wayyy too much editing and special effects
---
I get what you mean the mouse and keyboard players on console are just ridiculous but my mate got high ranking last season and everyone called him a hacker and cheater but he did it legit, I'm talking about the players that do everything completely legit, these cheaters just take that away from them.
---
Same on PS4...
---
I always forget that was the season name. I simply refer to it as Outbreak lol.
---
There no easy pay money get ddos protection service. It's a highly advance system that needs to be compatible with the physical server, game server, why the game works and other networking setups.
---
So you didn't see the operation Health screen. By far it was the most eye-watering, life changing loading screen.
---
*pours one out for Tower*
---
Better then the brain dead bans you usually see. I people are so fucking scared of Jackal and Echo but people forget we had to deal with them long before pick and ban we all survived with them on the field, so if anything ban based off of map and personal strats and not because of comfort or even personal vendettas.

There's a magic place called [Google](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/313863/new-rainbow-six-siege-patch-expands-dedicated-server-support-custom-matches-voice-chat-terrorist-hunt), try using it.
---
It happens to me 247 and needs to get fixed
---
No since phanthom sight the mmr resets on a soft reset rather than a hard reset method.
---
The mmr resets to a middle mmr value between your last MMR and your last seasons ending mmr.
---
This system makes helps the system find your main rank much faster than the old everyones a 2500 mmr player system
---
That was quite the pro gamer move
---
I regret not buying blood orchid for frost
---
No unfortunately. Ranked on consoles is literally unplayable. Is full of ddoser and lagswitcher...
---
Happened to me after I won an unranked match, somehow that counts as abandoning a match :/
---
Kinda the point of my vids :/
---
Shield?
---
Don't you pay for Xbox live too?
---
Yeah this is happening to everyone, some of us on PC can't even launch the game anymore.
---
T\^H\^O\^T #GONE
---
I'm sorry. So very sorry. That's 12 seconds. But, because I'm not trying to be mean, let's just round it off and say it's 10.

Suspiciously knowledgeable on the subject

And yet they live in a society, how interesting

Nah twitch drone can’t ignite goyos shield boys

Damn I thought Tachanka was already THICC tf is this shit?

i Loved the spawnpeeks but Not the map
---
I’ve never heard Kermit say “fuck” but I hear that clearly in my head too... 😂
---
Network engineer by trade lol
---
THICCER TACHANKA?!
---
We should not judge goyo  everyone has their own interests.
---
Because it’s only up to the operators that were available in that season

She once killed me with her animation because I stood too close to the window and didn't react fast enough
---
I can’t even find matches I spent 20 min finding a match on the first day of ember rise than gave up
---
You can't pre-order season pass but it will be available as soon as they reveal the Year 5 season 1 .
---
Im sorry who is the third? Am i blind or something?
---
Holy shit this is amazing. This looks so much nicer than normal 4K though. 🤯🤯
---
I like your name for it better
---
I’ll be sure to look into this. I actually use a 32 inch tv as a monitor rn (surprisingly you get used to it) so I’ll look forward to switching to an actual moniter. Thanks for the heads up on the specs too, I’ll look for those on the builds as I continue my hunt.
---
From your perspective. You. Thicc Tachanka and Hostage Lover 69 (Fuze)
---
It was a link to a website called become the meme
---
Oh, thanks.
---
Man I miss ranked. I play on console and the first 5 matches have all been ddos
---
Amaru tried rushing oregon upstairs 3 times with defuser yesterday. At least she dropped it on site everytime
---
And even the best music!
---
A really small hole coming right up!
---
The game was fine between the Ember Rise release and today's patch, but this afternoon I've had more crashes than the previous two months combined.
---
Did EA throw millions in prize money at pros etc via competitions? Word is Ubi made 1.1 billion in revenue off Siege alone and has tons of cash to spread around.
---
That sounds awful man, Ubi really needs to take time to focus on console just as much as they do PC. Hopefully they fix the issue soon brother, f
---
because people are annoying
---
I think that you can not upgrade your acc. If u buy deluxe it will be like u just got new acc
---
I love the noobs who kick me because I play amaru and goyo and I'm always top frag
---
Then you should've done the entire thing with a siege song instead of blueballing us.
---
Also, it is illegal to play the ending culmination of the clip after the "to be continued". I have reported your IP to the FBI.
---
Gsg9 and sas are 3/1 fbi is 2/2 and high and spetsnaz are 1/3
---
thanks man I appreciate the thought
---
It aint that hard to understand...
---
thx
---
Well No if you play with a ddosser you’re getting free elo without doing anything which is boosting dafuq? ‘look into it’
---
Np
---
How many will he have and what is his speed
---
Bad kda
---
Me too, it’s ridiculous
---
Because mmr is good
---
I personally prefer to buy headgear and uniforms for ops I like, it also serves as a way to keep "progressing" like when unlocking ops.
---
Fun to do in Halo 2 through 5
---
Meanwhile theres me that every time I bring thermite I use him to shotgun rush which is pretty often.
---
Kdr
---
because of your rank last season
---
Not kda
---
I thought the mmr was based off actually winning?
---
It is with an adapter.
---
only one way to feel about it.
---
Not if it's to the side, and i'd sacrifice a drone for that much damage on a defender.
---
2/2, 1 Molotov
---
Yeah I use angled grip on that gun on ps4, there is basically no difference in recoil
---
The amount of mmr you gain is based on your kdr
---
I don't think the guy who makes maps has anything to do with that.
---
I honestly do not care about his nail color it could be orange for all I care let him do what he does I have not played him yet but am ready to kick som ass with him
---
Please note this is not meant to be rude or insulting
---
True that
---
My condolences
---
I played my placements yesterday 3 losses due to server stressers and loads of 3-0s where they crash it coz they’re losing
---
I'm on PC
---
I just wish mnk was the only issue
---
Amaru should be able to grapple onto ledges in certain maps like house or consulet
---
I'll try upload the clip later but I got a sweet ace by going in clearing window on sky scraper and rushing the drum room. I was just too fast
---
yeah but both ps4 and Xbox are making new official keyboard and mouse you can check the video at YouTube where Microsoft revealed their keyboard and mouse for Xbox.
---
You use it exactly the same way except that you aim it at a soft surface. The crosshair changes when it's a valid place to put it.
---
Sounds alright but it means buying a new game it kinda sucks cause money's tight right now. That's one of the reasons why I still play Siege so I can play with friends without having to spend money on it.
---
This is why i ban frost now i kinda relate to bikini bodhi with frost mats
---
Dude you got some peanut butter on your gun
---
As a defender the weapon is fine as it is but as an attacker who’s already in a disadvantage those extra bullets would even it out
---
It’s just a post for fun, it’s obviously that the most important is the power of a operator :D
---
They did not, it says a problem that looks like ddos but is not
---
Holy shit that is the best one I’ve seen
---
Yee
---
Awareness is spread already. Go home
---
It’s your individual performance on the team
---
You have to line up with it like on the side of the shield
---
You’d have to be retarded to bandit a hatch and even more mentally deficient to fall for it
---
Roaming with ppm works
---
But like dont you think that if enough people have a brain  and enough people know about it is so fucking ez to counter. I mean like Amaru makes more noise than an jet engine.
---
cool, this is still happening. see you guys next season
---
Not post related but when did Hibana got Under Armour cosmetics (the gloves)?
---
#OOF
---
Nope!
---
ah yes that was such a beautiful loading screen. it set a great tone for the game. dust line's was also good but not better
---
Fuze :
---
#Am i a joke to you ?
---
It also break the window before she even takes off, but for that strat, you need a buck to go under and make sure there is nobody in the room, and somebody to watch the main window, the only angle that the defenders can shoot her is form kitchen so it’s an easy W if you can pull it off right
---
I Agree, I personally couldn't try out the showdown event and would like to play again the ones before it. Hope it's getting added one day!
---
Ah someone else who had the luck to get the lords headgear.
---
This is so glorious, both of the most hardened men in this game wearing pink with with rainbows and unicorns

Hol up

you can choose who you want to put on the front screen, i just chose my mains

Hibana: into the hibana-verse
---
To be fair, those operator cards are to make them money, since now the elite skin cards look comparatively better than they used to.
---
🙂🔫
---
I have no idea dude. Maybe it was the hot fix for no new ops in operator menu. Maybe it did fix it. I don't know though since I haven't played much after I downloaded it.
---
Well damn
---
I intend on buying the PC new from a retailer or a store such as Best Buy, but regardless I can’t speak to the risk associated with that. For me, it’s more so the fact that I need direction in choosing what to buy, more so than fishing for offers on reddit. Thanks for the tip.
---
But it is important to note the reason they did this, to allow for easier bug fixes and further changes. It's in the name of a good cause.
---
It's unranked
---
It should be under interface.
---
Killed my AFK friend so he wouldn't get kicked
---
It's unranked not cas
---
Would you also happen to have unreleased uniforms? Some of these obviously belong into packs with uniforms.
---
The risk of turning off your phone is someone showing off while you are at it, since it covers a huge part of the screen.
---
Now you can see your surroundings while you turn I off.
---
She absolutely should NOT be buffed. Can you imagine what would happen if Amaru was a strong operator? I don't want to die every round to an operator who can silently and/or quickly get into site and wreak havoc.
---
What do you mean in game it’s more pinky? Surely this screenshot was taken in game? Lol
---
Tachanka as an alternative to Intel operators
---
Honestly, just give Warden a nitro and that's good enough for me.
---
I mean in a match :v
---
There are... *rules*.
---
This is why you play PC
---
I like operation wind bastion loading screen more, same with chimera
---
Yeah I got skull rain glaz
---
Does a gaming laptop still carry the same specs needed to run R6 at high frames? Portability isn’t much of an issue for me personally, as I intend to use this more so at home, as for work/school tbh I largely use my long running MacBook. I’m generally looking for a more expensive build during the next little bit, but if seems to carry the specs I’ve been advised to look for, I’ll look into it. Thanks for the tip.
---
Maybe try different headphones?  Maybe run your audio through an EQ if possible with your set up?
---
xD
---
When they are focused on you, sure. But a lot of Monty's killing power comes from being able to take advantage of distracted opponents. When that distraction could only last a small amount of time, the speed at which you can take advantage of it is important. I've mained Monty for years, out of all the recent nerfs this one is already affecting me the most.
---
Frost op best op!
---
What do you mean you've seen it? It's brand new.
---
Not my fault that people can't handle losing
---
As long as just a tiny portion of the defuser is outside than you lose. You can see that the corner of the defuser is outside the doorway
---
In a match I constantly came through the same window in a match, I could have been completely destroyed with 1 trap at the window.
---
I countered a different Amaru with a trap there.
---
There was someone else who did it with him
---
Nope,Champion.
---
Truth is,I think it would be good if they banned all Champion players on Console.
---
Lord knows none of them deserve it.
---
It's worse. It somehow gets worse every season.
---
Who cares?
---
I feel the same way
---
And lose. No matter what
---
I'm signed up for it
---
Epic

You’re missing a letter. Add a T to the end and you will be forgiven

How do you even get started with something like this? Looks great!
---
Fair Fair

Doot
---
Yeah yeah jojo reference and all but DAMN they lookin thicc
---
maybe casual mmr has a hard reset instead of soft and all skill players are in the same lobbies, usually happens at start of seasons
---
Pretty sure its ur connection to be blame here.
---
You might as well try to update ur router's firmware...if you havent done that for years.
---
If you hit your shots tho I’m sure you guys ain’t no on point pros... all it takes is 1 miss click and most likely your mag is either dry or you better hit that headshot so the room for error is massive plus she’s hella loud and considering she’s almost useless once in the building and even then you grapple the hatch without a weapon and 7-10 times the anchors hear you coming. I see your point but it pertains to a smaller group (pros) instead of the larger fan base. Again my opinion I like her for what she can bring to the table but she brings massive potential but ubi restricted her to much.... that pistol idea is good but the smg11 takes a fare amount of skill to control a burst, nevermind a full mag. With all that said my last bit is that there are many windows and doors to worry about while your moving at a decent speed and even the best of flickers will have trouble trying to nail the shot while grappling at a decent speed. Goodmorning and hagd fellow gamers.
---
Wait, they actually released it?
---
In several spots that’s a solid choice. Not in that spot though.  Drone it out sometime and you’ll see why
---
Thank you for the detailed answer. At the moment I've had my eyes on 3 in particular: Lesion, Vigil, and Maestro. Who would you pick if you had one choice between these 3?
---
I’d love to experience the chimera outbreak event
---
The real question... is New Zealand there? Because this could go on r/mapswithoutnewzealand
---
You have to stick your teammate...
---
Damn.... Now the hostages will die at hands of defenders when attackers are running away with her.
---
PROFANITY

My friend opened 50 packs the other day and at least 15 of them were blood orchids.

First rule of toxicity : establish one's own rule and believe it is legitimate
---
Usless for you, but a good monty knows that they must balance out options of what they can do. Know when to ads, when to hipfire, when to melee or when to just stay extended. This nerf just means people who don't play monty much can't do as well with him against lower skilled players.

I agree. I miss his impacts. But to be fair i wouldnt have clutched this if i didnt have the fmg and smg-11

I dont play too often but I've bought all 4 new ops with renown and I'm almost at 50k again to buy the new new ops :/ apparently I'm not average

Elas has already been leaked but if cav gets one im on that shit, same with capitao

Outbreak all over again

Supernova is straight up ass tho

Cuz he's a 3 armor. Goyo is a 2 armor

I was wondering how you survived any of that and then saw the hold x to defuse and understood. Good you random entity on the internet!
---
Capitão
---
Will never beat the one in Villa, that Easter egg is amazing
---
It’s a ddos issue. It only happened when they were on defense and we had winning potential. Plus if you had this amount of lag in a game and it was a server issue then everyone would be kicked, it’s only ddos where people can lag this much and it keeps everyone in the game.

Oh man that’s sick, keep up the good work :)

Not his gadget damage but his gadget mobility
---
Buying for abilities and who not gonna be useless in 90% of games.
---
It's not immersion. It's just a trend that's been happening to every game for a few years. CoD is a great example.
---
CoD had clowns and ice cream cosmetics in AW, then BO3(?) had an entire map set on a picnic table with giant ice cream etc...
---
Games start to cater to younger audiences with rainbow and colorful skins to drain tempt them into draining their parents' credit cards.
---
Not every game has to pander to younger audiences with rainbows and puppies. Siege proved it by going 3 years without it. 
---
It just doesn't fit the game. The colors stand out too much.
---
The Roni is a fun gun to use. And has way less recoil. But the commando is an absolute unit of a gun
---
I don't see any big brain out there
---
When you don’t get rickrolled
---
##”jammers deployed”
---
Just play the game lmao
---
How?
---
This isn’t the fault of the server itself, this is someone ddosing the server in order to win.

I got one for Fuze yesterday
---
Jager,..
---
ACOG...
---
the season 1,2, and 3 player on average has mostly every operator and earns over 80,000 renown per season which gives them enough for seasonal camos and the new operators(most people have season pass so new ops are free) 
---
I DO AGREE THAT ALL PLAYER SHOULD HAVE A RENOWN BOOST UNTIL THEY HIT LEVEL 75... ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE 1K HOUR ON CONSOLE AND SWITCH TO PC
---
Dunno bro seems low gold to me
---
Lol frost is so op
---
Ironic.
---
No fuck off. It's hundreds of posts like this a damn day.

Bruh it's nice but it kinda looks like an orange crayon got fat and cant get out of doc's barrel

His name is mute but he yells everything

This post made me buy the faze headgear

It’s the elite skin

Doooooooot
---
Later this season we are getting a free mini battle pass as a way of beta testing the system, Then next season is when the real battle pass arrives.
---
You look badass
---
No shit? That's really weird
---
It’s been happening at least a year now, possibly longer. With champion rank out this season, it seems worse. People will do anything to get it.
---
This picture is a paradox! 'Glaz' is fuzing a 'Hard' wall and killing 'Thermite' WOW
---
Bruh she’s been a waifu
---
I mean monty was op before now defenders can atleast switch guns or use secondary gadgets without getting domed. It's not fun being locked out of a room by monty. He can take soo much damage.
---
I did the best ducking clutch with amaru and everyone got wet
---
It's part of the update. If you get banned in the ranked game modes, the other modes will be blocked too.

Choose an op and look at lower left corner

Ah, I love Red Vs Blue. Can't wait for next season.

Pulse has a fucking man bun lmao.
---
so unfortunate this is happening with no end in sight. :(
---
And Kaplan main
---
Okay. Must have been a server issue for me , both teams had a few members who were kicked and everyone was lagging
---
For Defense get Lesion. He is pretty easy to Play, very strong and you can even go a bit aggressive sometimes. Other good ops for a supportive playstyle are Majestro, Echo and Goyo. For Goyo it’s the same like Lesion But he depends more in teamplay and Communication.  
---
For Attack Zofia is an allrounder. You can Pick her pretty much always and she Will Be useful, no matter if you Play her passivly or aggressivly. Capitao is a bit more situational, But since the changes to his firebolds he got pretty good. Also Dokkaebi and Nomad work very well.  
---
A tip from someone who had to Buy all Y1 and Vanilla ops back then: on the Testserver you can use every Operator. Try them there Next Time it’s up. Noone But yourself can say the best which one makes the Most fun and suits you the best.
---
casual clip omega
---
100% agree. The fact they didn't event mention it in the patch notes (from what I saw), means they are Hoping nobody notices. Either that or they changed for all shields and didn't think of Monte. 
---
I loved the challenge of Monte as it's hard to master but very rewarding once you do. Now Monte is just good for trolling with the shield up and not using the gun.
---
you have to save yourself
---
I actually never got to play Mira in ranked - alway banned.  
---
As a Mira and Jackal main I don´t really like this

I liked Blood Orchid too....but black ice....still the best
---
Thanks! I can definetly say this is oc!
---
It was a joke
---
This is Amazing! Nice work!
---
Frost will always be my favorite op. The loud snap when someone steps in the trap never gets old.
---
Adapt and overcome
---
I would rather change the damage dropoff.  
---
But the acog is intended. And I don’t think they will take it away from him, when Kaid has the same gun
---
Pin this post!!!!!!!

That's Ying. Ying throws her Candelas which are basically flashbangs on steroids. They deploy a ton of flashes that Ying herself is immune to, so she's good at rushing.

Well damn, I haven’t played the new season yet, but I thought he was lying to me like he always is.

thanks

Exactly, &amp; I will definitely stick around for those moments &amp; to see the game (hopefully) become better with time. But I still wish to point out the fact that a lot of the time, moments start off good, then end badly. The n other times, the good moments i have are because someone else had the same problems I do.

That's what I have on mine. Best bromance

Havent experienced this on PS4 this season but I know how frustrating this is. it did it two seasons ago pretty bad.  then it's worse when nobody's talking about it on Reddit and you assume it's your home network so you go crazy diagnosing and resetting routers, checking wires, etc.  only to find out three days later it was Ubi.

damn... didn't even notice... he did it just for the meme :(

I thought ur head only sticks out when u aim down a little. When looking straight at me I dont see any of his head poke out from the top.
---
The youtuber PriesT has many game modes on his channel. My personal favourite is "Border Patrol" but with the Kanal rework it looks like you'll have to find a different route.
---
 Also a different mode, my friends and I play on theme park with the brightness at 10 (go into settings and go to calibration) and then it's a 5V1 game of hide and seek where the 1 is Caveira and 5 can choose whoever they want. (Here's a little cheat, IQ has "night vision" when she uses her R.E.D.)
---
The health is set to 50, and Caveira can only knock people (using silent step and melee) and the attackers can only run away until it's 1v1 then they can melee back. No gadgets, no guns, no abilities, (unless it doesn't hurt Caveira like an Airjab or Finka's boost or Nøkk's silent step, Ying's Candelas, etc. JACKAL, LION AND DOKKAEBI ARE PROHIBITED). Another thing is we put the HUD settings on realistic, so we don't have a compass or ammo count or stuff like that. And Caveira can interrogate up to two or three times depending on how many players there are (2 for 3, 3 for 4 and 5). No shields, shotguns are allowed for breaching but the goal is to stay hidden and avoid being killed by Caveira.
---
If you have 7 people, one of them can be on Caveira's team. Make them Echo or Valkyrie or Maestro, but they can't disorient or shock people, only spot them. They're like the spotter for Caveira. If this is the case, interrogations are prohibited. Cameras can not be destroyed by attackers. If there is a spotter working for Cav, then Lion and Jackal may be allowed on the other team, but not Dokkaebi.
---
Remember, to turn the brightness down to 10.
---
You can twist the rules around if you want to.
---
not when your team all dies in 30 seconds and leaves you in a clash + X situation.
---
Tbh, this is exactly the reason they removed it.
---
Doubt it. From my experience unranked is more of a mess around game mode.
---
What does this even mean
---
Astonishing
---
Why did you just lay the bomb lol
---
Bro when are you gonna come set up my WiFi router?
---
What do you suggest should be changed
---
I thought that’s what casual was for?
---
You are still gonna hear her enter and she can still be shoot down before she can take her weapon out again.  
---
IMO she needs to break the barricade when "kicking" it to enter. But I can see perfectly why they did what they did: bugs.   
---
I can PERFECTLY see her going face to face with the barricade still close but enter anyway for some strange bug, leading to 2 weeks of people rushing with her abusing this bug.
---
Theres screenshots like this all over the place because they were promotional images from when the game was going to have more customization rather than the hero system we have now
---
Thought the same thing and was left with 26 hp
---
But atleast i didnt die that wouldve been embarassing
---

---
No problem mate
---
Gold 3*
---
Both
---
I'm level 323 and I'm so unlucky that for thermite i only have the seasonal skins 😂😂and the birthday skin.
---
Another thing we did was on Club House where we all picked defenders and we had 45 seconds to hide, and sledge or blitz came in to find us and epicly destroy us. It was very fun
---
Me too
---
Well the beta for the new Rainbow 6 game that's based on Outbreak is coming out next year I think so you will get another chance.
---
Man let's not talk about skins, I lost plenty of em. :'(
---
I'd say as a rushing operator she is useful. You drone at prep phase and pick a window that is not near site and away from roamers. You then enter building faster than anyone else. This is great for gaining map control early to stop roamer rotations
---
That's the point lol
---
I also play on Xbox, so if it was a but it very well could have been an isolated thing. Part of me feels like it was around the time we got the JTF2 ops though, but it’s been too long to say.
---
Yea and it's a thing that had been in the game for almost 1 year
---
I have a 0.9 even tho I go positive cuz I played ranked on a laptop at like 30 FPS a few years ago
---
That’s just bullshit Thailand should be able there
---
Yeah, NA. I assume. I live in Midwest USA and haven't manually changed anything.
---
The amount of people I've gotten from that locker room window on defence. People need to start prefiring it right away.
---
I like the feature but agree everyone posting screenshots is pretty boring. But... I would LOVE to see this feature expanded to the operator selection phase for each match. It would be a pretty cool way to show off everyone's kit while we wait for the slow guy to load...

If you just got her use the shotgun.
---
Global warming is taking effect
---
I think only male ops have an advantage. For attack if you look at gadget removal Thatcher does a pretty ace job. Twitch is a bit harder to use. An IQ could be used but that's a little more risky than both Thatcher and twitch.
---
On defense however the males have a huge advantage. They have bandit, kaid and mute to block hard breaching as well as jäger the only op to deal with projectiles.
---
A little sidenote while I understand this is just a little thought experiment it's important to keep in mind that it's not about segregation but this woman's League is to allow woman to get a foot in the door and move onto bigger things. Not accusing you of anything just something to keep in mind.
---
Much like he game it works a lot better with both men and woman together instead of apart.
---
Great question though. Really killed the time for this train journey
---
They said they dealt with spawn peeks. Run outs are apart of the game...
---
Na not recording just noticing that i hit people and they dont take any damage and that happend quite often this season.
---
No I agree with this. I have been bandit tricking since it became a learned trait. I hate when randoms decide to play him and dont trick.
---
Yes
---
I didn't crash, but I was queued with two other guys and one of them crashed twice in an hour. I'm betting we'll hear a lot of that in the next few days.
---
That's quite a bit of renown.
---
Dang, I now feel motivated to play Dokkaebi
---
Yes yes yes I love that idea
---
"hurr durrr runouts bad". People need to accept runouts are part of the game and once you learn them, easy to punish.

*gets shot* aaaAHHHHHaaa
---
No one understands ur post m8
---
Its the first week of the season so we ban the new ops
---
You do realize if your team actually is of equal skill you should be winning those defending rounds right
---
Where did you get the majority of this outfit? I've been trying to get a cosplay for a siege character but don't know where to look for the best value for my money.
---
Not sure why people downvoted you lmao, I am on Xbox and I tried the angled grip on amaru’s lmg, it is pretty easy to control, the vertical grip is a bad choice on the gun now that the angled grip is available to it because the ADS speed is horrendous without the angled grip.
---
&gt; Just think rather than the space, how much fun it will add to the already good game.
---
I played all these modes for a combined total of around an hour i'd rather have the space than something i will never touch and even if i did i would rather have the space and install something i would enjoy and play more. 
---
Even if released as an optional DLC you run into issues with these game modes being old and deprecated so likely wont work in the current build of the game unless everything these modes interact with has remained untouched or a rewrite of the mode. 
---
its a good idea but it would be too much effort to execute properly on what is likely already stretched team (TTS being up to 3 weeks)
---
Sick dude. Really good job.
---
Isn't that how you play fuze. TKS and hostage kills
---
&gt; but this woman's League is to allow woman to get a foot in the door and move onto bigger things
---
There have been women in pro teams...
---
And attackers do almost always have the better weapons
---
I agree that she isn't super tactical. Just pretty fun to use
---
He’s not playing fuze tho.
---
Yes multiple times. I doesn't count as a loss or anything
---
Yes I know. But they are vastly underrepresented
---
Super late on this, but [here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/t67CUeg.jpg) in case you still need it
---
He isn’t cool enough
---
Shhhhh. He's using his charge. Fuze possessed it
---
Lol if you look at me it’s plat 3 then just copper and bronze after that
---
Smg-11 is too new for him is my guess.

Holy shit fuck lol this can't be right?

.95 isn’t bad. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. I’m usually my team’s entry fragger and I think I’m rocking about a 1.6 K/D, but I’d kill to have the game sense and overall skill the rest of my team has. At the end of the day I usually just exist to snag unprepared roamers. My teammates are the true champs because they’re the ones who push the defuser to site and plant, which is way more important than kills
---
Good. Now spread the word.
---
Praise Talos

No one wants release ela
---

---
It's not on the sidelines. It's a place for orgs to look and hopefully pick some of them up. I'm very excited to see where this goes and I hope to see some new names really make it far. If you don't enjoy the premise don't watch it
---
Ela doesnt have a highcap, thats a 30 rnd mag for the scorpion
---
Opening the ubisoft club challenges and colleting them, might crash the game for ps4. I don't know about xbox and pc.
---
that is the worst hacker in existent
---
&gt; It's not on the sidelines
---
It's apart from the main competitions in siege. How is that anything but other than sidelined?
---
&gt;If you don't enjoy the premise don't watch it
---
It's unecessary and, looking at cs, potentially harmful to (their) scene.
---
Nice man, I started about two weeks ago and I am climbing through Silver. I got ranked last season at silver 2, and now im doing my placements again! I am currently 2-0 hope I can get to gold as well bud!

He is gay because the game is not correft if no gay char

Goyo shields are in a fucky position. I think he's like Fuze in that you shouldn't play him on hostage. Or at least not use his shields anywhere near the hostage. Though it is shitty that you got banned for 30 minutes because something your ally did. Which can't happen with Fuze's gadget. 
---
When you think about it. There's just a lot of problems with Goyo on hostage.

It’s a bug. My games been crashing at the most random times. Doesn’t matter if if in a gunfight or just sitting at the main menu. Only been happening since the release of Ember Rise
---
187 Ban Tachanka and Castle
---
Banish,begone you piece of shit map
---
There are various other problems tho... Such as how will you handle the MMR Gain/loss (since it's based on your team avg vs their team avg), will you count the avg MMR 5 stack as the highest rank for gain/loss?
---
If yes, it will create a reverse unintended boosting effect to the opposing team. If you have 5 players split evenly from Plat 1 to Copper 5, and they go up against a team of Plat 1s, they will be crushed. And will move people out of their real rank/mmr range (on both teams) creating less interesting matches for everyone in the future.
---
If no, it will make the none-5-stack team gain 1 MMR from the match, and the 5 stack will lose 1... And on the odd chance that the 5-stack acutally wins, the MMR lose/gain will be enormous based on the math (&gt; 500 mmr if early season for sure). In the first case the match would feel wasted (why spend 30m for 1 MMR?).
---
I don’t know why people make these posts. Get what you want. It’s literally your money and game.
---
Old hereford is better
---
Mine for sure went down, I was left with one from each category at 2000RP each and then I bought them all for 1000RP each when the season changed over
---
What is the server called?
---
https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri
---
Iseems that for everyone, Blood Orchid is the Black Ice of uniforms and headgear
---
I have every operator apart from them. But should I buy frost before dokkabie?
---
He need acog
---
Except new players aren't paying 60 dollars for that version of the game. The base game is down to 20, 30 dollars gives you the year 1 DLC. 60 dollars gives you Year 1 and Year 4. 
---
So people spending 60 like you did are still getting 16 operators right off the bat, which is more than Y1 players got. That's not even taking sales into account where the prices often drop substantially.
---
"You own everything!"
---
You "save" 20% because its 1 click versus individual purchases.
---
Ubisoft is compensating for time, not effort
---
Why does it look like when DIO stops time?
---
Oof sorry
---
Well the layout is sort of the same, unlike Hereford, but yes, I can agree that this map shouldn't have been added immediately because there are just TOO MANY angles to watch at any place except the museum/map room corridor place and that other place in the same hallway before the lower bridge, which are basically lock down regions if you defend from one point.
---
True.
---
Yeah everyone that complains about blitz being op obviously hasn't tried playing blitz recently
---
To sell the account
---
Bro, you're insane. Take my upvote. You put in so much work. You deserve a platinum (I would give him one if I had money).

How do you guys get it to say your main next to your name

That's the joke.

I agree. I'm loving this season so far, especially since it's missing that game-breaking glitch that it normally comes with haha

Excuse me . But you meant to replay to someone else ?
---
Everyone that complained that blitz was OP A, clearly didn't know how to communicate and set up crossfires, and B, had bad aim and didn't know when to aim where.
---
None.
---
Ideally, never main.
---
Alright lets talk about your cosplay . Just don't hack my phone while i am browsing reddit
---
Lol that's what they've done with every new map addition and rework since I can remember .
---
I agree, it kinda sucks it goes straight into the competitive mode with very few people having map knowledge, much less having any idea of strata. This is doubly worse for console players since there's no TS to even begin to familiarize. But, just as you have no clue what's going on, neither does the enemy team lol. So it works out initially I guess.
---
Honestly though, the way I preferred it happens is it goes into ranked mid season. Especially now that we have the unranked game mode. Players can practice and familiarize, on top of build strats in the competitive ranked settings, but still be doing it outside of MMR punishment. So that for half the season for everyone to get used to it and have an idea, than cut it loose in the actual ranked atmosphere.
---
What is your Ubisoft account name?
---
Damn, when you're right you're.
---
Uplay: Splitsec
---
I ended last season in Plat 2, lost 6/10 placements, and got put in Plat 3, so I’m not sure I believe it.
---
The exaggerated butts makes the whole thing so much funnier.
---
100% this. It's just an option to not see other people's ridiculous costumes. I'd like siege to look more like a classic tactical shooter on my end.
---
Ah a man that of culture
---
Thanks for information i hope buck s one will be worth it
---
Damn you handle the smg recoil so good
---
Nope you get a goofy ban too?
---
There is a playlist where you can play exclusively Kanal on casual, play it, learn the map. Problem solved.
---
Cute
---
If you die to anything you must always blame the game and say that it’s broken
---
Well done
---
spoiler pls
---
Ahh nice for the correctness of the game lmaooo
---
&gt;To be honest, Blitz and Monty are just plain frustrating to play against,
---
Yes they are.
---
&gt;Clash on the other hand feels fair in my opinion so I don’t know why she gets banned so much.
---
I agree. Clash is deadly at mid range, you can't escape her and he smg is deadly but you can easily counter her stay at long distance, outside the range of the shield or close the gap one mele is often a death sentence.
---
This balance of op lethality and ease of counter is rare among shield ops. Blitz 1v1 is deadly at any range monty being completely unkillable unless they make a mistake.
---
Oh shit. Sorry. Saw it earlier didn’t know
---
disagree. her weapons are strong. timed right with a well coordinated team, she can flank the defenders without them knowing. Hard to hear when there are bullets flying.
---
no one rlly asked
---
That would be god tier dude
---
Buck and Montagne should get skins
---
Maybe lower, again I could be wrong, these are very rough estimates
---
Wow! Only thing that looks less than totally realistic is the shape of the blood. The edges roll beautifully, but the overall shape is a little too rigid.
---
WHY NO MONTY WE WANT MONTY

rank? region?

Have you solved this yet?
---
Mmm, console.
---
Wow so cool 👏😮
---
That's tight
---
What does that have to do with it?

All siege themes sound in some way familiar. after all,they have to sound similar to the base game soundtrack.
---
Picture?
---
Honestly no other legitimate reason, Uplay+.
---
I love this menu when it doesnt bug out and go into a blinding white state.
---
Thanks, but 12 seconds is way closer than 2 minutes.

I remember there was a glitch where you cut a hole in the soft wall next to the hatch, then you could place the battery in the hole and then reinforce the wall so they can't see the battery.

I agree it’s better than the original and maybe I just need to play it more. I’ve just been having a bad time with it in ranked idk why
---
6: That you are 0 0 3 but from the winning team doesn't give you premission to use "ez"
---
Ali is just useless that’s why I put her last lol the other two are good in their situations
---
The real one
---
Just got on today, happened twice to me already
---
This happened to me awhile back and it fucking sucked. I ended up losing the entire roster I had unlocked to begin with.
---
Uplay+ upgraded your game to Ultimate edition
---
Give Warden killstreak rewards.
---
Good idea for dok first?
---
little bit late, but to be fair, i don’t think many people look for kapkan’s anymore due to how little he’s played. that and the fact that unless your on your death bed, they only give you a mild tickle.
---
Loool that is magic at its finest.
---
She’s good at hunting roamers if you have a good headset but meastro is good at countering plants. Just up to you based on your play style

I actually use clash and dominate, Nokk and Tachanka are a little harder but I’ve managed aces with their suppressed shotguns. Warden I can’t get the hang of period

Hello SatansTits, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d3uxx9/server_connection_error/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
you can just look up your rank after playing one... i can confirm you dont reset to 2500.
---
i was 3500 at the start before placements.
---
I've had it six times since the new update three just today
---
I know, but doesn't Ultimate only include the previous year passes? This is really weird, I didn't get any "current" season pass reward, I did get Vigil Alibi and Mozzie who I haven't bought yet, and those were "kind of" expected, to be honest, but this wasn't, at all
---
you only gain like 60-70 per placements now. maybe thats why. i could have sworn it was 100+ last time. so now losing a few placements doesnt fuck up your rank.
---
Oh for fucks sake I hope that won't happen to me, that would be abysmal as someone who bought the old Starter edition and have grinded my way to where I am now
---
The most probable answer as of now, yes
---
East US.

Me and my squad is gold/ plat level.

Nope, what I'm currently trying is to download the TTS (another 65 Gb, ugh), it's kinda a last resort. All the suggestions on the Support site lead to nothing and my ticket isn't even being worked on... Looks like there's more people having a problem with the update.

Is console even real? ￼

Of what? My operator screen of all operators?

I’m done with this for now

OP had 31 milliseconds before  the DDOSing started though?

Pro Tip: Switching to your pistol is always faster than charging for a Hadouken.

It was mostly DLC, but yeah, it was a major blow to the head. I have no idea what happened or why, as I was on console, so doubt it was hacked.
---
Take your upvote and get out
---
Fuckin beat me to it.

(And no that’s not a play on words)

I’m gonna be Jäger

Are you serious?

1.I had to go eat dinner the first time

2.I left because I had to get off to do chores

Me want

Sorry i lost the source but belive on me its true
---
Oh a hacker gave me hacks now let’s post myself using them.....
---
This is new
---
Don't leave then

---
Alright kiddo, time to take a nap.
---
What is that trigger finger
---
Why were you playing ranked when it was almost dinner time? That sounds like poor time management
---
This feature stops people from ditching games on maps they don't like, and for that it's great
---
_SLICK_
---
Mira
---
Probably shouldn't leave then.
---
When you nut and she keeps on sucking
---
Acog. Those were the days
---
I’ve only had sound glitches
---
Unranked retard
---
bro this is cringe
---
Its really not. Look closely at the material of her sleeves and leggings its like a leathery especially the leggings material. She doesn't even try to get any of the other parts of the outfit right, like the beanie she just slapped whatever she could find, her hairstyle and color doesnt match etc. I could go on.
---
It’s a sight
---
Why ?
---
Shh working as intended
---
Speed doesnt fix wifi lag spikes
---
I usually finish every season around plat 3 or gold 1, went 7 ans 3 in placements and got placed silver 3
---
What a god
---
Shut up fucking silver
---
His impacts where good
---
R.I.P. drone
---
That’s how it’s supposed to look
---
LMAO HE JUST REPOSTED MY PICTURE
---
Apparently I have a crush on mute...
---
I don't know how to fix it but it happens to me. (Might be because my computer is bad)
---
Of course you cut out the connection indicators
---
I have both but I think Mira is better 
---
She has a great ability for intel and there are loads of new strategies coming out with her, also her gun has a high fire rate so you would get headshots all the time.
---
Mira if you want to be competitive, but she’s not very fun to play.
---
Maverick is pretty fun to play but doesn’t have as high of a skill ceiling
---
I prefer maverick
---
I’m still new at the game, so I get nervous when I see two ops shooting at me
---
I don’t think sights need WiFi
---
i want this to be all mine seu miseravel
---
When u think rank actually amounts to something lmao
---
"Friendly"
---
Holy shit yes - I want a lesion.
---
Rushing her is the only consistent way to win. Kick the shit out of her shield and open fire, or hide and die.
---
the whole game feels different.. and it takes me 5 minuites to find a match.. they fucked it
---
Normal t-hunt
---
You could always kill/be killed through there
---
Because mute jammers jam radio signals. Sights use batteries or tritium rods in case of the 2.5x sights.
---
Literally what every shit player says.Rank does matter and if you can’t make it to at least gold you’re shit
---
You don’t lose mmr in matchmaking time like that
---
Sick Play bruther
---
Doesn’t her gun have a ton of recoil
---
Needs more jpeg
---
No. It doesn't. It's specifically against the rules to post accusing people of cheating.
---
Back to bronze? Thats a lot of ddos
---
Depends on your taste. They can both be fun.

Soooo... i was searching for a ranked match and it took like forever to join, so my friend and i requeued. His game crashed and when he got back in he could reconnect to a match i tried to restart my game and i could also reconnect, but it has just been searching for a match the past 20 minutes now...
---
Thx for the MMR Loss ubi. :)

Did you try setting the ThrottleStop - Options - Timer Resolution (ms) to 1?  This can help with some odd issues like you are having.  If that does not make a difference, try some different GPU driver versions.
---
Check the Log File option in ThrottleStop.  After you are finished gaming, exit ThrottleStop and upload the log file somewhere convenient like [www.pastebin.com](https://www.pastebin.com) so I can have a look.  When logging make sure you have checked Options - Nvidia GPU so GPU temperature data is included.  Also post a few screenshots that show how you have ThrottleStop setup.
---
XD sorry
---
So, when you see someone using a legendary in game do you start screaming at them, too?  
---
WOW PICK ANOTHER SKIN THATS SUPPOSED TO SUPRISE ME AND ONLY ME, OPENING ALPHA PACKS IS AN EXPERIENCE JUST FOR ME, IM GUNNA TK YOU BECAUSE I DONT LIKE YOUR GUN SKIN IM NO LONGER SUPRISED AND IMMERSED

Get the fuck out of here, you self centered piece of shit.

You usually do...

Hello sjonny29, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/d3w1w9/clickbait_or_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I recommend Mira even tho i like maverick more. Mira has a faster firing gun, which is very advantageous in a one shot head shot game
---
Nope
---
So what do i do??
---
Good find.
---
FUCK
---
THIS
---
MAP
---
It is a practice zone. Same conditions, same heat, just no ranked.
---
So you can experiment, but you can't leave the way you can't leave in ranked.
---
"Just don't join" has worked for me over the years. I'd rather sacrifice a few chuckles than my IP address, but I get your point
---
Scam. Stay away from it.
---
The last season thing is a system where it moves you closer to a certain beginning spot (like gold something) depending on how far you were last season. For example, if you were plat it would move you to say gold 1 range for next season, but a diamond would be around plat 3.
---
G
---
The game has been alive for four years and trust me when I say they have to make new ops every season to keep up with their set standards plus it is a lot harder to deal with glitches and plan for new stuff. And with everyone wanting new things after a week of the new ops being released I was surprised they had so many ops at the beginning of the game being released so their ideas for new ops were limited even more.
---
When she was first released her arms didn't even fit in her player model. Bitch be thic
---
how
---
Her silent step ability was changed in phantom sight to allow her to activate it when it wasn't fully charged, but decreased how long it lasted.
---
I got a duplicate of that one 2 days ago
---
If you won 7 and lost 3 there is no way you got placed below gold, you’re either lying or confused
---
Nice!
---

---
This neato
---
Tell that to my mmr
---
Ever heard of black ice??
---
Just you
---
What did it say?
---
The first time someone actually used his gadget with success
---
This thing is beautiful
---
1. If you are  t bagging with an enemy and they kill you call them an asshole
---
what res?
---
If you're on attack or you know you're not fighting Blackbeard, you can also just use a low recoil/high RoF weapon and headshot. I find it far more reliable.
---
Like, if it's a high-skill situation, why set aside the effort to use a weapon that is just as effective as others with the added difficulty? Also lacks an ACOG, which on attack can be invaluable.
---
Also keep in mind that it's a machine pistol, so its damage fall-off is is also very punishing, so the low TTK is even further less accessible unless you are, like I said, right in their face.
---
At that point I'd honestly just rather use a pistol. Only takes like 2-3 bullets to down anyone not wearing rook plates, and its infinitely more controllable.
---
Okay..
---
Use him when a team mate is planting so if they want to stop it they’ve got to risk being pre-fired
---
An actually nice legendary skin for once
---
Ah, I see a fellow man of culture

I used to main Lion until I realized everytime I load up cas people think I am trying my ass off.

They said something along the lines of “I hate kanal, matchmaking” etc

1080p
---
Ah
---
I think double tapping the L3 and R3 buttons should make you lean without ADS. But ADS is just normal L3 and R3
---
u thinking of niggas in the shower?
---
If ur already asain ur cheating
---
Maestro, you're a fool if you disagree with the fact that he's beautiful
---
What the fuk
---
like 1080x1080? or 1440x1080
---
My issue is silent footsteps when enemies are near me now

To be fair this is highschool shit.

To be fair, this sub is mostly in highschool so it’s kinda cute. Young love
---
1920x1080 60 fps
---
Are you playing from outer space
---
*upvote because girl* 🤣
---
I don’t think they said it released with the season
---
Wait. So it's hard to deal with glitches because they are working on new stuffs? How does other developers could manage to do it?
---
Alright dude lmao
---
Shes a 3 armor so they make her bulky but she doesnt have as much equipment to cover her up
---
I was plat 3 last season. So far have won 5 lost 2. My MMR according to R6 tracker is currently high gold 1. Each win/loss is about 115 MMR. So if I win the next 3 I will be plat 3/plat 2. If I lose I will be about gold 3.
---
Nope, I just have xfinity.
---
Ohhhhh I see what you mean. I play in 4:3 in siege so its rendered at 1920x1080 but the image looks stretched because that's my in game res. My bad
---
i thought that u guys where playing 2v2 knife and ur friend accidentally exposed his hacks lol
---
that would be the worst way to lose a friend holy shit
---
Definitely isn't termite after that rework
---
Out of the faces that have been revealed, I'd say Thatcher. I don't like Goyo very much. I don't know why.
---
obviously tachunks
---
Tachanka
---
Cause she’s an Australian wook
---
haven't seen anybody playing as her so never seen her in-game.
---
Before the dark times... before the empire
---
I feel you.
---
I'm gonna look this up. super curious about that lol
---
10/10 would bang again
---
There will probably be a free test version in this season. The full version will come in season 4
---
definitely lion
---
That's gay
---
Exactly, and this guy is complaining that she takes just two seconds, which is already inhuman. Like seriously you would need enhanced limbs to pull off what Amaru does, give the lady a break
