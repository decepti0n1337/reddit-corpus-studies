waits, thats illegal
---
Very recently
---
Oh god no
---
Play unranked or quick match then, I find it more fun than ranked unless I'm playing with a whole squad.
---
I guess all I can do now is complain how that's a wack pool of maps, it seems to favour the gigantic maps over the smaller, more tightly designed ones
---

---
I remember playing the Beta when it was just all House all the time... what a dream it would be to go back to that
---
They really REALLY love giving Hibanna red and white coloured content don‚Äôt they. Mix it up a little ubi man
---
Link your channel if your thinking about making the vids cause I‚Äôm hella down
---
House, Hereford, and plane aren‚Äôt in the ranked map pool. Chalet and Oregon are though. 
---
As much as the classic maps are cool for older players some of them are not really representative of what the dev team thinks of as ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù maps. Basically your options for carrying out strategies those maps are extremely limited and don‚Äôt allow for flexible gameplay. The bigger maps that have been added in like villa and clubhouse offer a better variety of potential strats. They‚Äôre a pain in the ass to learn because of their size but once you know the layout it‚Äôs not bad
---
Look in the observation tools section of keybinds you may figure it out
---
Oddly enough that only happens to me in casual
---
Not so greta for ms. Thunberg bro
---
Or you know, actual guns lol
---
Well i play fair so i won't just wanted to ask
---
*peaks through window on objective seeing Jaeger* OwO what's this?
---
No it doesnt.
---
We all get lucky every one in a while... some more than others though
---
Since there‚Äôs no acog on jagger gun can you put it if you ever make it.
---
Just was curious don't worry i play fairly even if i am bad haha
---
Hhhmm will consider haha
---
You should make a niche out of this man, call yourself CardboardArsenal, CardboardArmory, something like thag
---
there is one
---
Clubhouse is okay, I think I can say I actively dislike Villa
---
Also like... I totally get that for Ranked, but it's straight up stupid to not have all the maps in Quick Play
---
Even if a map is SO broken it shouldn't be in either, it still makes no sense as to why Chalet and Oregon aren't in Quick Play
---
Of course youre not allowed to play the game the way you enjoy it you annoying fuck
---
you missed. even if you connected the arm you would not have downed him.

I never said you sat behind your screens too much, all I said was that you people need to stop being such jerks and screaming at me for making a simple mistake, I had no idea I‚Äôll do better next time just stop resorting to such profane terms.
---
I fully get what you are saying but I wish the stereo type of "toxic spawnpeeking j√§ger reeee" would die already. Ever since his acog removal I rarely see him used to spawn peek I instead see more doc or rooks spawn peeking
---
It is never too late
---
Why not include kill camera? That's all I wanted to see.
---
They‚Äôre just trying to make the map pool smaller for new players. The game has changed a lot, there are way more operators and maps to learn. There‚Äôs just way too much for a brand new player to jump into. It does kind of suck for some of the older players who want that nostalgia kick
---
A long year? It took me a few seasons *without buying a single one.*  
---
Not really worth applauding for since it took you that long while also having the ability to buy them shouldn't have taken that long.

aw yeah

dont tell me that you didnt filmed that opening

I see, you also included Bartlett. A man of superior intelligence

I don't get it

That‚Äôs a little more than rough

They just want to work on something else. You gotta remember they‚Äôve been there throughout the 4 years of siege being out plus all the development time before that. So most likely another 5 years. Almost a decade on one game. They want to do something different now and with the success from siege they can probably do almost anything they wish and get funded.
---
Too bad that Sony/Microsoft can't do anything about it.
---
this left me so stressed
---
On what? If you're talking about the patch it was made by Jack Ryan of FEindustries.
---
Needs to be the bomber. Gadget becomes self destruction.

So u are this kind of guy with over 120 lvl in mid Silver that I always get in enemy team on rankeds
---
Yes

Omg my son would love to do something like this, he's obsessed with that game! Xx

He instantly spotted objective

I found the Objective instantly

It was more a joke bc I'd never buy one myself but dang this dude is on the grind. They look official and well done too.

Glad to hear it! I‚Äôll be waiting to see more from you.

The concept art for the uniforms from outbreak were actually really cool looking.

What specifically are your quarrels with siege? I'm actually curious, cause from my eyes it's grown better with almost every update in the 2.5 years I've been on it

And to buff thatcher. I mean just let him kill all the lights inside also for the whole duration of his ability.

Are you fucking with me?

I played Unranked and someone was recruit. 10/10 game. 10/10.

The furious typing

Yea but I still want to get an opinion from a player who can see the viewpoint of the players who find ash/Jager mains to be toxic

For those saying he missed. This is the frame right before the trigger was pulled. [https://drive.google.com/open?id=19HtfvYHOw00DOujC-NG173jqLcCt0mMX](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19HtfvYHOw00DOujC-NG173jqLcCt0mMX)
---
With that said. OP if you look in the top right corner of your screen there is a red plug icon. Which means you had a temporary ping spike/lag. You could of had what would have likely been a DBNO or atleast a 97 damage shot.
---
Not really. I would like the option to not join matches that are ending. Has nothing to do with me imposing my beliefs on someone else.
---
It‚Äôsretarded best guns in game and the gadget is basically mozzie+Wamai and the name is magnet really you can do better

Who are you talking to?

Capitalization matters, does that help?

Wamai doing?

I like how he dodges the humiliation then just suddenly dies

Lemme check

Sill annoying
---
They just crack it every time they try and fix it. Its out of ubis hands yet people still cry about it to them lol
---
Glacier Skin, like Black Ice but way more beautiful

Custom game tactical realism. Gets rid of almost all HUD, and you only have a set number of magazines, and the bullet count is actually assigned to each mag. So if you have 3 magazines (1 in use, 2 spare) and fire 10 rounds, then reload, mag #1 will have 20 rounds in it (if we ignore a +1), mag #2 will have 30 (is now in use), and mag #3 will have 30 rounds. You can reload again, and it will switch to mag #3, and you will have 30 rounds. Reload again, you will have mag #1, and only have 20 rounds
---
If only the game didnt kick you could have gotten 7 kills in one round!
---
Nice
---
Yes, it just so rarely saves you
---
You realize that means nothing right? A 1.0 in diamond can still easily have a 8.0 in copper. If you have a high kd you‚Äôre playing the game wrong and should be in a higher rank unless you frag and immediately die after without helping your team.
---
Very annoying
---
lol oh jesus he looks so confident!

How‚Äôd you get it? Is it in the shop?

All hail smg-11

It's based off of your casual win loss mate

It‚Äôs hard with any game transitioning. Once you‚Äôre used to it and can aim fairly decently it‚Äôs amazing how much it pays off though. After transitioning went from copper first season to silver, to platinum.
---
(:
---
We have these in the Giant I work at.
---
Look only at the tip of the acog triangle, and you missed the shots... add the fact that bullets go through jagers headphones on his sides, and you realize why ya lost... nothing much you as a player could have done... unlucky

Yeah, I've had the same thing happen before-the knife animation finishes, blood goes spurting out, you're standing back up, and you get killed and don't get the interrogation.  It sucks.

Ah ok, thanks for the help! I will definitely try out ur suggestion

It irks me a bit you didn't cut them a tad at the beginning of each one. It would have looked more smooth since you can see the acceleration from the start of the fall each time.

What was his ping? He may have already been dead before his shots were fired.

It‚Äôs from the compression of the video

Whether or not this single clip is a miss, theres been so much of this shit with a lot of people, I have an entire folder of clips of me doming people with blood coming out of their heads, as well as them even flinching and it either records no damage or headshot its ridiculous
---
Well that sucks
---
Just a weird angle. Most people look bad when they tilt their head back and look down into a camera.

Fuck it I'll attempt to board the helicopter.

---
You should invest in a 3d printer. I feel like you could make some really awesome stuff with those skills and determination.
---
For me it stacked as the round progresses
---
Sure sometimes that happened. In that instance the vigil did well to recognise that it was safe to push the window. When he did that he created a closer engagement which favours the player with a holo sight. If you can pick a gunfight make sure it suits your weapon. Zofia+acog favours longer distance engagements. In that instance backing off from the window would give the defender less advantage if he pushes and you even more advantage if he held the first angle
---
U do not sound old enough to play this game

Yeah except i dont have r6 credits, speaking of, the feck is reown

Practice tap firing with Maestro until you get a feel for the recoil. It can take some time but it's worth.

Yes, in competitive, that would be a joke. Because those are competitive rankings.

Dont want to play similar ranks? Play casual.

Why does the quality of this photo look like some ARG photo

Worst thing is when you hit the first shot but it's followed up by some unnecessary "control" shots

Cuz I wanna waste all my ammo trying to shoot you

For those that are curious, this was not the first que that I was in, so I waited roughly around an hour and 15 minutes for a match with no results but the one run ended at  around 57 minutes when the game disconnected
---

Where did she get those gloves, they look awesome

2.0 or so is possible, I‚Äôve had it for a while until it declined to 1.7. 8.8 leads me to suspect he leaves games before they end not to incur the loss. Played against a guy with a 126 w/l ratio, they just leave before the end screen.
---
Disconnect and connect your PC to the internet again.
---
I tried but I‚Äôll try again
---
This player deliberately jumped into my nade to get teamkilled and steal a kill just so he could grief and abuse the teamkill pentalty. He's been known to do this several times. This is the problem with griefers in siege. They destroy team equipment. They jump in direct fire of your nades and guns just so they can play victim and abuse the teamkill penalty. You can see this clown being smug about it in the chat too.
---
Praying right now for you to get the alpha pack, and doge charm!

seems like your crosshair was on jagers head between shots, but wasn't when the gun fired

It takes time you won‚Äôt learn over night just try to learn callouts have fun and try to learn where people commonly play at

r/foundthehondacivic
---
Using real money, yes.
---
His K/D is only 1.7, that's not enough to solo carry to an 8.8 W/R.
---
This guy is probably just very good at playing the objective, and plays with a team who knows how to play the objective with him.
---
The high level also suggests he either has been getting away with it for a long time or he's not a DDoSer. He's probably like me and loves his Echo/Capitao objective stall strats to cheese wins.
---
I think it got delayed so they could finish it. Haven't heard anything else
---
He must have a year pass discount
---
Thats what ranked is for. Casual is random matchmaking not intended to be taken seriously, and ranked is competitive matchmaking against similair skill level. If this bothers you, change video game.
---
Hold this L.
---
I almost exclusively play ranked these days and legitimately forgot a few of these maps exist. Man I wish the ranked lineup was more comprehensive.
---
The new Crysis doesn't look as good as the last
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs a reason she doesn‚Äôt have the option.
---
People can be quite toxic to new players but youll eventually get to a point where youre a high enough level for that to stop and you get used to the rest of the toxicity that comes with a competitive fps. If youre in the aus region its way less toxic than what ive heard about the other region cos most people are chill cunts.
---
Lol
---
Mmr deducted
---
How old is this screenshot? Your team has a Clash

Dunno about jackal but blitz is realistically connected directly by  wire so theres no signal to jam.

You wanna know what you do with people like this? Upload it to YouTube. Make a Ubisoft support case under player reports and bans. Put his name and video link and Ubi will slap his shit with a 5 day toxicity ban
---
Well you‚Äôre supposed to only use those ones on cheaters or squeakers. Or if you‚Äôre playing in a school.
---
For sure dude! I love it!
---
No official information. If you want updates on everything R6 Siege news I‚Äôd suggest joining the R6 Discord server. Every small update and announcement goes in that server first
---
remove ranked entirely
---
Have 7 so far
---
Castle and mute?
---
Wamai is good as both his primaries are good he has barbed wire which goes well with kiad and is like j√§ger
---
I think even in Lv100, there will be still a lot of idiots in low rank. The proportion will decrease but you will still meet them unless you clamp. I know this is hard as it is basically my situation too as a solo rank player.
---
You‚Äôre about *checks watch* 4 years too late my guy.
---
Can I get a link to it?
---
Please do. Mute is amazing and provides a utility not many others can provide. He‚Äôs incredibly fun imo.
---
France is always to scared to shoot just in case the drones shoot back
---
Naw dog just get gud
---
Some people don't want to play a whole game where their teammates leave
---
Maybe dont get triggered and try to help them by making call outs.
---
And seriously who wants to grind to lvl 100 to finally play ranked.
---
It would feel so weird not having G2 at the invitationals. Hope they get in.
---
Do you have the app installed on your console/PC/mobile?
---
Russia wouldn't give a fuck I feel. They use grenades to take our drones. Civilian casualties is in Russian is pronounced "Promotion"

I sure did!

Not really, I hate shields but all they have is a pistol that once they use they are easy kills, or the one shield that you melee once quickly and then shoot/stab. Shields may have the advantage of blocking bullets but  any other defense sucks

I appreciate the proper representation of the console gang in this subreddit, hell of an Ace my dude.
---
Thanks
---
Its hard to tell Mozzie drone against attacker drone in a twitch reaction.
---
Dissapointed in you.
---
No Acog.
---
Shotty / SMG 11 / Shield
---
Okay thx
---
Smg 11 is the better smg out of the 2 he has.
---
So Smg11, Shotgun, BARBED wire
---
But you can connect late enough to play 0-2
---
Play smoke as the last resort anchor, use shotty to create holes on top of soft walls to throw your smokes through, aim for common plant spots/entry points. Ideally your smokes are used to prevent plant and/or last 15 seconds to prevent a push.

Steam charts don't show players owning the game on uplay only. There are dozens of us!
---
Same I have done that but it was from bronze 4 to gold 3 but of course without having a full team it gets difficult to at least hold your gold but if you want to play with us we both have a 1.0 kd and a 1.0 w/l
---
*Mouse and Keyboard feelings
---
Stop asking this shit
---
Both are fun to play because they are different, but kali brings more useful utility, so.
---
Kali imo is really powerful/ borderline op right now so I would get her. Amaru is just a character to mess around with once in a while so I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs that good
---
Kali

How long did this cartoon take you to make?

Just save it bro. I wasted like 300 credits on some stupid skin and missed out on stuff I wanted later by just 200-300 credits
---
Agreed
---
I‚Äôm over level 200 and I have one- bucks dmr
---
No, the Mozzie drones are highlighted white and have a blue light instead of a yellow one
---
I‚Äôm talking about the dirty flick at the end of this clip btwüòÇ
---
imagine using a laser on your gun
---
Watch
---
So this is what CardboardIV looks like.
---
He's flying over the screen, that's why You don't see him
---
Whenever I play Mozzie, I'm always on coms:  "That's my drone coming through X, please don't shoot it!"
---
Nice, good luck! Aiming down sights is a huge part of this game!
---
Why are you so mad? Hahaha just stating facts. Sorry you don‚Äôt like it bub.
---
I just wanted him put in the naughty corner. RFF will activate if you shoot a DBNO team mate. He even shot other team equipment when I wasn't looking. He made us lose the match. The report system is a placebo.
---
My crowning achievement as Mozzie was when I injured a Twitch, then used her previously captured Shock Drone to kill her. Yeah, not so funny when it happens to you, is it?!?
---
Definitely seems like it
---
i understood it in a different context
---
Wtf is happening to BB
---
Thanks for the fast responding
---
‚Äúspawnpeek‚Äù
---
Impressive...
---
Ez solution, never die first or last, just be the most mediocre player on your team. But for real, I always do at least a two stack to avoid this entirely... but then I spawn peek with alibi strats and my friend initiates the kick anyway.üòÖ
---
That's when you throw in the GG3ez
---
worth the wait
---
If we r on different servers we will lag more on the other person‚Äôs
---
I'm from Brazil tho, probably will lag, but add me anyway, let's see if lags so much
---
Good point, I assumed they were in from the start. In which case I suppose the rarest skin would be a function of total players with a rare skins X the active player base.
---
That dirty flick was nice ngl
---
Wait, you seriously don't know how ratios work? You know that a 1.0 win/kill ratio is 50% right? You do understand that concept? As in, if you get 10 kills and die 10 times, you have a 1.0 K/D? Similar to how if you have 100 wins and 100 losses, you have a 1.0 W/L? Ratio is literally a different way to express division, did you not learn this? This man has an 8.8 W/L which is to say 8.8W:1L. So on average, every 98 games is subdivided into 88 wins and 10 losses, do you actually not understand that? It's not that hard, you should've learnt this in grade 7.
---
Edit: I thought I was picky, but it sounds like you might have some hardcore Asperger's mate. When somebody tells you it's literally raining cats and dogs, do you tell them they're wrong because it's actually raining water? Jeez
---
This - I get if it wouldn't reward any renown in offline mode. I just want to have a playable video game without internet.
---
I agree
---
I use the shorty to put down naughty mates. You looked at my drone for 5 seconds before knifing it. You deserve the death
---
then stop complaining
---
¬°T O X I C! Vote to ki... oh... he‚Äôs already left... well always next timeüò¢

Idk I think people hate her hair and the fact she isn‚Äôt wearing tights any more

that mira and pufferfish died because a knife
---
These enemies are total bots.  This would be like if the bots on normal difficulty thunt had been huffing paint thinner all day.
---
That isn‚Äôt possible
---
Idk
---
with how op defense is right now it shouldnt really matter
---
Damn, is it fun getting dropped?
---
It is Impossible because of the amount of skins combos you can have it would take space
---
Oh Okay, thanks.
---
Glaz with an AR? Fuck no
---
You're the man Boberto. I always enjoy your Siege Tales!
---
Dont. You dont belong into ranked until you know the maps.

Warden should be the referee. That‚Äôs about all he good for

MIBR, Wildcard, Aerowolf, NaVi, giants, reciprocity, darkzero, team liquid, empire, SSG, TSM, FaZe, NiP
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest chief... I miss this map... and Fortress... and Bartlet every once in a while couldn‚Äôt be too bad could it?
---
Perhaps
---
Way to over explain how wrong your usage of the word "literal" is.
---
And fun to play, I love seeing people panic running and shooting and all while flashed and it‚Äôs funny what they say in chat so even if he is a bit annoying to play against he is fun to play as
---
They speak french in some parts of canada so its ok i guess
---
No. Kaid is quite well balanced, and extremely good on certain objectives. He doesn't need an ACOG.
---
You are good
---
Mate there‚Äôs a big difference between the mp7 and aug A3 . Bandit is a three speed with a beast of a primary whereas Kaid is a 1 speed with a pretty underpowered SMG so it would just make sense for him to get an Acog on his AUG A3.
---
"Y u knife, y u knife"..."knife again"
---
Can we get nokk for defense then because that would be fun
---
Those pmm headshots made me hard
---
That's the thing though. Be efficient with your movement, don't waste unnecessary time slowly moving the mouse when you can move it to your next potential crosshair placement a lot quicker.
---
Yeah lets give ACOG to Clash , Mira and Tachanka as well to balance things out /s
---
I am pretty sure its immposible to keep your account after transfering to another platform but correct me I am wrong.
---
It‚Äôs a low recoil, medium damage, low ROF SMG. I‚Äôve used it extensively and it‚Äôs fine without an acog. And he wouldn‚Äôt need one on the SMG since the .44 mag has an acog, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying they should buff the .44 mag to make it better at long range.
---
Honestly i bought warden for his cool running animations just like how i got mozzie for his reload animations
---
But you‚Äôll die bro
---
AUG A3 would just make perfect sense for it to have an ACOG tho and would just make the AUG A3 a more fun gun to use and would have a higher pick rate .
---
You can't. Please use the search function on this subreddit before asking questions such as this.
---
How many times did Tom get squashed like a pancake again?
---
Same thing happened to me I lost my ranked game because of that
---
If the game starts round 1 in the prep phase with less than 5 ppl then the game should be canceled. How would that be abused nobody would intentionally leave the game in the first prep phase.
---
This is the new knife fight duel. Twitch and mozzie so you each get a shock drone and then you do battle bots
---
You are complaining about playing a random champ player but you are going to swap over and most likely run into PL players. It is to you to judge which is more annoying, but the champ seems far less scary in my eyes.
---
Seems cool but I got some changes.                             
---
He's a 3 speed                                         
---
Gadget can be thrown anywhere, like wamai                  
---
The further you are from the gadget, the less effect it has                                                         
---
Can only do a max of 2 damage, but can slow you down (not your sensitivity, but just walking speed)
---
Doesn't ping                                     
---
He only gets 3 of them

Ive experienced that except i was the one who got knifed in the face

Thanks lol

Was it buffed?
---
I do it 12/5. No spawnpeeking on weekends.
---
Just buy an ugly diamond for 100K if you want to waste renown that much.
---
Drives me nuts people are still complaining. At the worst you've got a 3 speed, impacts, and a balanced version of ela's scorion.
---
It was just one match, and probably just bad luck. The MMR lock for matchmaking is big enough to let plat play with low gold
---
I don‚Äôt think Mozzie is a better mute, nor do I think Mute is a better Mozzie. The SMG-11‚Äôs DPS is ridiculously high and the M590 is one of the best shotguns in the game. Mozzie is a great roamer because of his drones whereas Mute is more of an anchor/lurker. They both do the same role, but both have advantages the other doesn‚Äôt. Either way, both are incredibly good imo, especially Mute after all the buffs he‚Äôs gotten.
---
I‚Äôve solo qued up to plat 2 this season, it‚Äôs a lot of luck, but not impossible to push past if you play often
---
2 days ago i played with a hacker twice in a row. Fucking retards aimbot was locking through the wall when i was spectating him...

You can copy them from a website called battlefield emblems, there‚Äôs a way to copy them so search on YouTube
---
Why are they all French?

Peter is a -5 speed. Meaning every step forward is 5 steps backwards at 1 speed
---
Am I the only one that instantly thought of the doctor who episode?

The game is still kicking bro, even the DLC servers are alive as well

Sorry for the slow response time, I wanted to show the video I **just** made, which I think is better than anything I've done before.

Hello Codsworthyy, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ee9gla/side_mouse_button_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

theoretically it should work
---
Thank you

Ikr, all they need to do is not equip the skins? It‚Äôs not like you can see them anyway lmao
---
Buck is fuckin perfect
---
Don‚Äôt fuck him
---
Should have made meg clash since everyone hates her
---
There are a few reasons.
---
If you ask me, the shotguns are only good use when you play Defense.
---
Shotguns are mostly short ranged, medium range at most (like BOSG) so;
---
1. When playing Defense you will be mostly closer to the enemy, which decreases the range and makes the shots more effective.
---
2. Usually you will find a spot to kill enemies, and shotguns can deal more damage closer you are, which makes them a great camp weapon for Defense again.
---
3. Your playstyle. When attacking, if you like long-med ranged combat then the shotgun probably will be worthless, but if you like fast-paced, close range and quick gets the kill type of combat, then the shotgun will deal more damage in most cases.
---
If your problem is not only about the shotguns, it may be technical such as ping, FPS, bitrate of server, or just the problems everybody deal with throughout the game.
---
Hope this was useful, I tried to help based on my knowledge and observations
---
Yeah, he prolly has 2
---
And a console is not as expensive?
---
I am one of you.
---
Been playing since Nomad, been playing _A Lot_ and I'm still aweful. Kinda. I can get 1-3 kills If I'm going John Wick Mode and are lucky, but you can bet your ass I won't Ever get out of bronze at ranked.
---
I don't like finding teams for 5 stacks, I have paranoia, lmao
---
They all speak french
---
I reported him already but idk if he is going to get banned..
---
Kinda hate her. In a 1 on 1 scenario, she is so annoying, and they just look right at you and keep on shocking you, with no way to escape.
---
Okay, this one might be a bit too shitty.
---
A console is like, R$2.000 reais Make the change with dollar and you'll see the dollar here is  R$4,20. Yeah, this is so fucking expensive it used to be 2,00
---
Why they all French
---
Shit grammar police, am i under arrest?
---
Out of spite
---
What platform are you on? We could maybe play together
---
Turn on advanced drone deployment it wont happen again. (When you throw a drone you dint automatically hop on cams if its on)
---
Omg not the precious points that make literally no difference.
---
He was safe to assume that as if you don‚Äôt get sweats it‚Äôs low rank. Just word your comments differently
---
r/nononoyes
---
It also says in his bio that he is French-Algerian, born into an affluent family.
---
I'll be on in about 2 hours. Gold 2 Eu gold 3 US
---
&gt;great pick even in high ranks
---
That chart is from plat and diamond ranked games on PC.
---
It seems so rare I see aces on defence
---
Dude you still have time to approve. I‚Äôve been playing since black ice (granted i kind of stopped playing for most of year 3) and didn‚Äôt get my first ace until like a month ago. I‚Äôll get a max of 3 kills a round. You‚Äôve got this. Just keep playing
---
Bandit already got his animation,so why tf it should be for bandit?
---
I love how Brain is Buck
---
This is the single stupidest shit I've ever seen
---
Same thing happened to me for jackal... I don‚Äôt like playing as jackal.
---
Soo can't you sell the console and buy parts a bit above the minimum requirements of r6? I mean you'd have to play on pretty low graphics but you can improve a lot on pc
---
Me dying or just in general ?üòÇ
---
All of it
---
Swap Finka for Lion, THATS the real cancer strat!
---
So do I. When I heard and saw her trailer on year 3 I thought she would be so cool and have cool sentences to say but she started to be so loud and annoying every time she shocks someone
---
As far as I know your casual mmr and ranked mmr aren't tied together. That said, if you play reletively the same in both your mmr should end up putting you against similar quality of players in both modes.
---
Why do you think Ubisoft is bad at handling these problems? They put everything in place and they ban and suspend people for cheating, toxicity, and being an asshole. You just need to take the steps to ensure it happens. The responsibility is as much in the community to keep itself clean and call out those who do and say things wrong as much as it is Ubisofts responsibility to ensure real punishment for those who do and say things wrong. It‚Äôs a two sided fight. Sitting back and expecting Ubisoft to slice the slice the problem overnight with no help is unrealistic is more ways they one. Step up and be a better member and fight for a better game and it will come your way. Sitting behind a screen and whining about it isn‚Äôt going to solve the problem.
---
I know... But I got the PS4 because the most of my friends play on it, and I like to play with them
---
For real?
---
Lol nice
---
Ok, maybe I didn't express before... The short term punishment should remain. This could be a reward tha somebody gets after days, or even months, of the cheaters is actually caught... It's not instant!
---
hehehe sorry
---
Have you try turning it on and off again?
---
thankuuu
---
Drinking game.
---
Show pictures of siege skins and you have to guess the rarity. If you don't guess it right, you drink.
---
its,, just.. pulling down.. you just need to train the recoil pattern, there is no special skill to it
---
How old is he?
---
Everytime i try to do that i slip and fall then proceed to cry on the ground
---
He never panicked. It was all calculated.
---
Real men spawn peek with the magnum
---
That's what gets em so wet
---
Remember, it's called quick play.
---
Lots of people higher than about plat 3 use mouse and keyboard on console. It's a plague on the ranked system.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt they be American Operators?
---
Why is meg finka? I‚Äôm triggered
---
Honestly, I would buy the game again no question if they remade it with a dedicated engine.
---
Remove the kebab

all french

There's loads in newcomer

Been there, done that. Got a 30 minutes ban

Sledge mains- We will watch you progress with much interest

I cry :(

I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
Only Ubi knows for sure, but it‚Äôs probably to prevent too much data from going in and out of the server
---
*The greater good*
---
Nomad good ? Did they buff her ? Her ROF sucks
---
Does it give u 100 xp if u catch a shock drone? I thought it did that im not sure
---
I cry :D ??
---
This is so sad :( 
---
Hey Siri play Madagascar
---
Lol love it
---
What are they meant to do? They cant detect mnk users because the adapter tricks the game into thinking theyre on controller. Trying to update the game to detect it isnt monetarily viable nor feasible on a reasonable scale either. Epic tried with fortnite and withing 48 hours the makers od the adapaters had gotten around it. If epic with all their money can't stop it theres no way ubi can. They also cant do bans off of reports because it would lead to too many false positves. The only surefire way to know if someone's using mnk is to get them to spin in a perfect circle for 40 seconds but good luck getting your enemies to do that ever, let alone in ranked.
---
If they add native mnk support it will almost certainly put them into the pc matchmaking pool since they officially consider mnk on console against controllers to be cheating.
---
There are no reasons to avoi....... never mind
---
No?
---
OWO what‚Äôs this
---
Yeah Deren does sound like a little shits name.
---
Dude, you'd be lucky if anyone want to play with you, let alone meet your requirements. What are ya, eSports recruiter?
---
I havent noticed the mnk issues as much as everybody says.. I cant tell if I'm lucky or people are misinterpreting what is mnk and what isnt. Or maybe I'm the one thinking somebody is on controller when they're using mnk, who knows
---
I feel your pain. Level 30s into a lobby of 150+ on payment matches. You can get unlucky, other team have a lv 30 smurf, and you get a genuine level 30 as 'balance'
---
I tried reporting a glitch that wouldn't let me play and recorded it had 10 ping was outside the map .... they did nothing

They can add an overwatch feature like the one csgo has so they can see played games and analyze their movement and their sensitivity so its more obvious to spot them

I think before the bio reworks for all the pathfinders it said his father was Algerian.
---
"so anyways, I started spawnpeakin"
---
That's true
---
I agree to all of that except the arabic part 
---
All my friends are not mnk

I think the best solution is to allow mnk like fortnite (i believe) but make mnkers queue against each other
---
I wouldn't mind one... hopefully ps4 gets it.

Console players are just as good, they just have less tools to work with. That's why gameplay isn't as quick and accurate, even though the skill level is just as high.

Blitz should have died but it's okay.

First they team kill me and then on atk or def I steal their operator or if they go ash I get in front of the breach charge and when I can team kill at last round with 1 friend so I don't get kicked

Breathes quietly with visible upsetnesd

Well welcome to siege! You will meet some toxic people, like there are in all online games. But this game is worth your time to get better at. So if you have any questions don‚Äôt be scared to ask, we all used to be newcomers too

No, lets be toxic.

Every R6 siege player
---
Ok but what would happen,  would it just go back to random op?
---
According to R6Tracker he is rarely ever out of gold/plat 3. That isn‚Äôt an absolute beast.
---
But if they got banned for looking like theyre using mnk why would they get unbanned since theyd still look like theyre using mnk. And dont you think most mnk users would try to appeal as well?
---
Castles gadget is plenty useful
---
Have you ever seen his gameplay dude? When he actually tries? Most of his content is customs and whatnot but he 100% can contend with mnk players

truly I believe nitro are the best weapon of the game, I used to be known as the nitrogod because of the massive amount of kills I got from them.

‚ÄúWtf are you doing? Do it again.‚Äù

Same , I  built my first ever pc last weekend, haven't bought r6 yet , but I'll buy the edition which gives you every op (forgot the name lol) , cause I'm not unlocking them all over again. Thus far the games I have are for honor ,which I put into my library when it was free and I downloaded it now, and man it feels good to finally be able to play fh with more than 30fps (I've been playing it on ps4 since the Alpha) and also bl3 which I already had on ps4, but it was a reward for buying an amd gpu soo yeah hahaha I'm replaying it with 170 fps this time around....
