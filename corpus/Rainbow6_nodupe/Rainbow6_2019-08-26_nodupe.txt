I didn't say he was op or game breaking. He's just a very good anchor between his site destruction,  area denial, and his 2 primaries.

No, they aren't diamond and plat bans. They are PRO LEAGUE bans. Pro League operates on a completely different scale than diamond and platinum ranked does. They are all incredibly strong aimers, are unmatched in map and operator knowledge, have a consistent ability to gather / understand intel and perhaps the strongest part of pro league is the team coordination. Team Coordination, which COMPLETELY shuts down the strength of operators like Jackal and Cav removing the need to waste a ban on them. Ranked is, for all intents and purposes, a different game than pro league is.
---
The win rate / pick rate charts that goobisoft releases are an aggregate average of every site on every map in the ranked rotation. The most recent set also spoils the numbers by including ban rates into pick rates. If you legitimately think that the two charts are the same, then you are critically misinformed.

Well I mean R6 is such a close range game that a scope more than 2.5x is almost unusable in some cases

People already buy the season pass, so they won’t add more to it beyond maybe a discount or maybe increased progress. Battle pass will be like $10 and act as a middle ground for players not ready to go full season pass but want more rewards
---
Probably just people being shitty.

Probably on his way to kill some Hong Kong protestors.

Stop lookin at the CAM-RS am I right

Gotta agree. Nokk doesnt need a buff, shes 0retty well balanced.

Clash is really some of the ops who need more cosmetics. I mean,even Maverick got some more cosmetics,even was part of the showdown event,so why can't Clash get some more outfits and weapon skins.

I would love buying  a skin which dresses her up in a vintage British Lady style,a dress as uniform wouldn't be bad considering she has a shield which makes her loud and slow already so bright colours wouldn't give a disadvantage to her.

---
Nah, i've played conan so i guess it something similar, but it's not competitive and have no ranked play. Don't get me wrong i really like this game and enjoy it a lot with my friends, but pretty often ppl in my or enemy team  just...well u know :D Often ppl dc from my or enemy team because there is no real punishment for it too. It's kind a stupid.

Go curl up into a ball in piss into your own mouth you racist

you can't know the difference between losing connection or just disabling internet connection so i don't think there's a way to change this penalty.

Word. Well if you do play rust you will see ultimate levels of toxins.

wait, that's illegal

Even if that’s true, Glaz’s gun does not need special treatment

Oh that’s funny ! MICHEAL !

if it was the same case in 3rd person,that skin would be a p2win in certain maps lol
---
When your hip fire is better than your actual aim
---
not scientifically possible
---
It's pretty much personal preference. I put a laser on my pistols and shotguns. Keep in mind that when using a shotgun you should position yourself to where the laser can't be seen.
---
And why is that? I'm mid gold and I have never found when I was matched against plats that there was a severe skill gap? Mabye your just not as good as you think you are?
---
I agree, but rainbow is a much more condensed experience, which makes all the toxicity feel like so much more. 
---
Plus there are literally nights where I get team killed the first few matches of the night, and it makes me shut off the game and load up something else.
---
lesion?
---
At least then offer me the chance to reconnect immediately, but they don't do that even
---
 That Blackbeard looks like he was cropped in from the actual game lol
---
You must be really desperate

how about you fix your internet instead and it won’t be an issue
---
Ubi can't do anything,it's all on Microsoft and Sony.

Nice picture! I've never seen this many cosplays at once.

I wish there is something done. This ruins my siege experience.

The guys just trying to find new people to play with grow up man

Looks great! Nice operator choice :)
---
Oh hahah look guy it’s an office reference!! See guys I watch the office just like y’all. Hopefully o will get some upvotes because people that Watch the office will get it :) hahaha the office
---
yeah, that's a solvable problem.
---
I know what you mean. After 10p is when the real cancer comes out on R6 I got TK’d 3 times when I was playing yesterday, because I wasn’t in some peoples squad I’ve never met discord
---
24 hours is ridiculous. I payed the sixty dollars to play the game. If I want to leave a match because of a NUMBER of reasons then I will.
---
I'm less concerned about your aim, more concerned about thiers.

This is the ultimate repost

Lookin fresh

You waited 1 day before stealing someone else's post

Man, that shotgun looks like its straight out of tf2
---
Im posting this because the original cheat code I had wasn't working anymore on the latest update.
---
They probably changed the models or hitboxes
---
Idk why but the 1st thing that popped in my head is that it looks like spongebob t-posing, while wearing a big 10 gallon hat and wearing boots.
---
The fact that Ubi already made 1 billion dollars is not relevant. As a for-profit company, they will always find ways to monetize content to earn more - that's the entire point of a company. I'm sure you also work or have a business and would always like to earn more? Or do you say to your boss "no, I already earn enough".
---
That's just a dumb argument.
---
The only thing I wish is that it does not affect gameplay - that's it!
---
Yeah lmao I don’t get the joke
---
Why would you think that would be overpowered when MP5SD has the same damage output as FMG and how MP5K also has nearly the same damage?
---
T o T
---
oh shit you right
---
The loot box mechanic is shitty, but the logic behind "They earn enough" is dumber still.
---
Nowhere in the world do you or any other people do not want more money. Do you say to no to a raise? I doubt it.
---
 Or they don’t want to wait for you to load in?
---
I hate blitz, but tht cosplay is incredibly detailed
---
I think Tachanka's enjoying it more.

why the doubt?

I would love a casino map

I checked his twitter and it says he’s located in the land down under, and Im pretty sure it’s pretty hard to get a mpx down there

Well that actually good point.

Oh I do quite often. But I’m saying like I’m looking for like live criticism or something like that.

And you will be able to play.

Just not ranked.

I don't agree, it will make fuze even less picked because right not it's one of the only advantages he has

Does that make Kaid Raichu?

I see more of a Ron Swanson but okay

Hmmm, I like it but not now at least.

The mask makes you look like the soldier left behind in Resident Evil

Maybe it would be 4 dots right?

Cosmetics. Who cares. You like something enough, you buy it. Otherwise, it does not change your gameplay experience one bit.
---
in order to get better recoil cont., fire off a magazine at the start of a match and try to control it
---
im sorry did i hit a nerve or something?
---
 or why am i being insulted?
---
i simply stated that i agree that Nokk should get better guns, and i also added that Warden should aswell.
---
i bet you think your clever as hell thinking "yeah they wont change their guns what is he stupid?"
---
Great job. Shame he's such a shit operator. I really wanted to kill people with a sweet gadget quote Ned Flanders.

Fan made. Imagine a group of 5 people with warden glasses on

Thanks for not being a dick like the other guy 😂

---
I'm just going to leave this here and let it speak for itself.
---
Right. The problem with the MPX isn't necessarily it's DPS, but its attachments.
---
Lol its a shooter not a rpg. Get over it
---
Only on consoles
---
I wish heroes didn't go into the shitter.
---
I think he meant put the operators from the update in the pass. You could either play the pass and try to grind your way to the new ops, or save up the renown and buy them. Add different ways to earn the same operator
---
This isn’t a problem, this is just you trying to find a reason to complain. Plenty of studios use the same voice actors for the different characters. Look at TF2 they have 9 different very distinct characters, and several of them are voiced by the and handful of people
---
Yeah because kids arent toxic at all.
---
no please. I just want to spawn peek 8 yeah olds.
---
Undertaker with the steel chair! MAH GAD
---
Well I don’t see a problem with that so long as they’re put near the end.
---
I just check the G8A1 stat, it is nearly the same as the r4c, which is my favorite weapon, and now it has better ads than the r4c. Maybe next season i will use it on IQ instead of the 552
---
Looks great...cocaine Ying.
---
Yeah, last guy disconnected and the round ended super anti-climatically.

The 8 yeah olds aren’t ready.

That’s fucking badass

I would've agreed with you if we're talking about map reworks. This is literally a bonus story of operators that has nothing to do with core gameplay. Your statement that "it should be available in the game to begin with" does not make any sense to me, as the game was always marketed as a competitive shooter.
---
It's not an RPG with a story. The fact that they introduced a way to deepen the lore with a battle pass is a brilliant idea for people that are interested in them, but does not affect people that do not care about them.
---
you can’t witch hunt here.
---
Honestly, yeah. I'm pretty happy with the battlepass in its current state. Cosmetic only, and even if they add in the ops, as long as we can still buy them with renown, I don't care. Ubisoft might fuck up a lot, but it does seem like they're actively trying to keep Siege alive
---
Yea you got lucky. I was playing yesterday and got team killed because I wasn’t in the discord
---
This guy gets it
---
That would still create many of the same issues as just adding a new gun
---
It would take much more than a simple ACOG to make her OP when she was the second worst Attacker according to Ubi’s data. 
---
With Amaru coming soon and Glaz buffed, I wouldn’t be surprised if she hits the 1st spot at being the worst Attacker in her current state.
---
good for you man. you found yourself a good group who were willing to help and be supportive. Thats huge for newcomers. In casual its more common to find that but i strongly suggest holding off on any plans to play ranked anytime soon for ranked people have less tolerance and patience, no offense intended. Keep at it and if possible keep with that group. its better when u build a bond and understanding amongst teammates. makes callouts, game knowledge, and just general comms easier.
---
Casual clips
---
My friends and i ban each others mains every game. Maybe thats what they did
---
Jackal I understand, the rest is unusual though
---
It varies on the day 
---
Sometime you’ll get super cool people and other days you’ll get memers and trolls.
---
The devs have pointed that out themselves. They want people to be able to use older weapon skins
---
From what I personally tested in the TTS, that will definitely be a viable setup now, although the 552 will still be somewhat more flexible since it will be easier to use at longer ranges due to the recoil.
---
Very toxic but well done, nice 4k
---
Kermite

First siege montage, starting up a YouTube channel @ Mistr Gaming. Would appreciate feedback on the vid
---
Fuze is that person who sits on the back of the classroom and never talks. This is the one thing that he says.
---
yeah lol
---
The siege team consistently goes against the “cod strategy.” I mean alpha you can’t even spend money on and they only have cosmetics. In cod you can buy packs for a chance to get weapons, I am 100% they will not give competitive advantages to battle pass owners.
---
How can u complain u have to plats on ur team and the rest are golds they have a diamond and plat the rest are bots
---
Actually you’re right. Make sure you put Jagers gadget directly on the windows as well to make sure you don’t get Killed by Grenades. And use fuses gadget on to clear out the enemies before you secure the hostage.
---
BootedYoAss is a heavy Lag Switcher please be cautious in your Ranked matches. We talked to the other team and gave up the match so they could win. It's really unfair that this happens but we managed to solve this with minimal damage.
---
you still can’t witch hunt here.
---
Not witch hunting nobody
---
Should we tell her that blitz is right there preparing his melee?
---
It's still 1/4 because we agree and support you shooting the shit outta kids
---
The jager knocked both teamate
---
Yes, I understand where you are coming from. But I really think that using his gadget for kills and suppression is certainly viable. At least it was viable. He just doesn't seem to be living up to his full potential with a loud blowtorch and a slow switch speed. Yes, you can certainly do all of the things you just listed but, his blowtorch is still noisy, and his switch speed is slow. Surely, you'll be in a situation where you're doung one of the things you mentioned and this comes back to bite you in the rear. Also, you can just tell from his voicelines that he was designed for stealth. "Quiet before the storm", "they won't hear a thing","quiet as a mouse". His voice lines, character, and original design all contradict the current state of his gadget.
---
A real 200 IQ play, let the enemy rush you and then clean up
---
I think you're right.  Spend 4 years talking up how they don't have pay to win. Go from shit game to hugely profitable on cosmetics. But fuck it up with pay to win battle pass. That just doesn't make sense.
---
[removed]

Nice spot, can grab it after the first half or so of the match if it's not useful

110 ping seems odd for a ddos.

Lmao that one too
---
&gt;Defender has advantage on pretty much every map
---
No they dont. Some rooms are defender sided just like some rooms are attacker sided. 
---
Just cause you are on attack doesnt mean its an automatic loss.  
---
Also regarding the spawn peaks, you have a drone to drone out the windows near the area that you are  spawning. Drone it out, use the second drone to check out before getting off the spawn cover to double check if you are not sure.

To recconect you are supposed to clixk tge icon to the left with 3 lines (it is a bug and ubisoft said they are working on the fix)

Can you do one for the other Germans?

---
Use that logic for EA, I'm sure it will get you far in Reddit--- better yet use that logic to Mylan Pharmaceuticals the ones behind the price gouging of Epipens, I'm sure that will win you favors too!  
---
Point is your argument is beyond stupid and it's counter to the views, wants and needs of the end consumer to price gouge them no matter the business you are working in.
---
what most siege players like to look up, IQ's Ass.
---
This is more pre firing  than blind firing.
---
Bruh you look Paul blart

Perhaps, even a grenade launcher
---
Theyre good drawings but blitz isnt that fat😂

I swear they just keep shaving away everything great about him with these nerfs

Nah it’s a CZ P-09 in Roni configuration
---
Blitz be thicc
---
That's why you got ddos
---
10/10 nailed it
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
i just draw dicks

I find it funny how most people on siege get ddos are on console. Is console easier to ddos or something ?
---
Record and send it to ubisoft . Not using phone of course

years of academy training wasted!!!

But if this dude is riding his bike, wind is gonna mess his communication pretty bad, + all the dust flying on it

Is there like and email or how ?
---
Hey great point, my game just went 3-3 because the game is definitely well balanced. Defenders won every round GG.
---
&gt;I could name a dozen competitive shooters that don't force you in every way it can to buy more
---
Are we going to be forced to buy the battle pass or did I miss something?
---
How do I send it to them?
---
The point is to notnreward the afk guy whem your team wins. It might lead to people getting carried by sitting afk.
---
wArDeN iSnT aSiAn
---
Jokes aside, great cosplay!
---
fmg is good if you hit headshots.  and impacts are amazing for quick flanks and surprising people.  shotguns take too long for that.  all 4 of his guns are good solid, idc which one we're using, i like all of them in any combo.
---
Ahaha yeah

&gt;don't @ me

"Ok, guys here's my opinion for everyone to listen to. And now that you've heard it, I'm going to shut down and pretend like theres no other arguments to be had."

Listing the benefits of something and then just ignoring everything else is so stupid.
---
And this isn't a unique idea. These are all things that would be beneficial to it, but there are other things that make others cautious of it that have also been discussed.
---
send the video through ubisoft support
---
This was on iFunny
---
I’ll get back to ya
---
The article he flashes when saying that siege made 1 billion dollars last year is the same one you linked, which literally says it's made a billion since it came out in 2015.
---
He either didn't read the article and made an honest mistake, or maybe he is just playing into the current outrage in an effort of get views on YouTube. Who knows?
---
Legend says till this day that Ash is still screaming friendly fire
---
I could have never survived that
---
Oh yea true then
---
Man this looks really cool. Good job on the cosplay.
---
Im more of a ironsights/ red dot guy
---
&gt;They can't detect it since it's at Microsoft's end.
---
Going off this logic, then how do all other game devs find cheaters?
---
It was nothing significant to me (and isn't now) but I was able to see it in the reflection of some weapon sights like the NATO ACOG and the polarized side of Glaz's Flip Sight, you just need to zoom in and it will be there
---
I only use it on shotguns and jackal's pdw
---
Not even lying, I thought this was an in game image but really high def until I saw the caption. Great cosplay!

Yea it might be. The cheapest version comes with no operators and I think its 20 dollars.

We already have season pass, paid or 30+ hour grind operators, lootboxes, timed lootboxes, paid-only cosemetics, and shit. Ubisoft already has a future proof revenue stream, it's called "Fill up the game with microtransactions, but not give players the same amount of free content such as maps."  The "Free" stuff in a R6S battlepass will be charms and skins for operators you don't own/newly released ones. This game doesn't need a battlepass, nor should get one. I don't see Fortnite charging $5 for every new item they release. 
---
This post is worst then the other tweet that said "Siege doesn't need new guns!"
---
Its just obvious Ubisoft shilling. Downvote me if you must, but this is how Ubisoft will gladly take your wallet, and you will have nobody else to blame but yourselves.
---
You all do know he is getting reaorked ans is gona be killed of soon tho?
---
Huh, haven't seen this before. Was about to comment about how we've all seen it... This is odd
---
yessir!
---
Ahh that’s hot, that’s hot.
---
RAH RAH RAH!!
---
Nice, what rank are you? Just curios
---
i turned it off.That means i will have kore fps right?
---
The 552 has a lot of random horizontal recoil, otherwise, it is easy to learn. Actually 552 is the first gun i learnt in siege.
---
I love to wait for it to be still and cancel the ability and melee right after to jump scare them :)
---
Heres an idea; give the potential free stuff, for free already.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not that hard. We still get "free" stuff, Ubisoft still has ways of getting money. Lots of em.

Dude imagine a blitz with a acog pistol rushing you,or all the jager mains cuming instantly in the first 10 seconds after prep phase,they also said they are gona rework sights.
---
Sure she counters people, but when. I play her, 90% of the time it's underwhelming, I'm not saying she doesn't counter anyone, she's just underwhelming
---
But that's just an opinion
---
A bad opinion
---
How??
---
When have Ubi mentioned ACOG on Nokk in general though? 
---
If you look through their comments on Nokk, the only statement given was “Nokk had an AR and she was too strong”. 
---
That was the first and last statement on Nokk I can find said by Ubi.

Maybe likely, the battle pass will have a free portion, where you can grind to get skins, even if there isn’t, it’s not like ubi is shoving it in your face saying “Here buy this to continue playing our game!”
---
The bp will be an optional purchase to get some cool skins. I don’t know why everyone it b****ing and moaning about it like it is the end of the world.

---
I’m gonna contact support in the morning about it thanks
---
yeah, and most days you’ll get absolute asshats for teammates unless your lucky, which fortunately you were. when i first started playing i had a few friends that already played it so i had a solid squad, but they didn’t really “teach” me. they preferred to use the ‘learn by experience’ method, and honestly i feel like if they would’ve taught me better in the beginning rather than just letting me fend for myself (or even if i DID ask questions they would give me super stupid or dumbed down answers that weren’t helping at all), i honestly might’ve been a much better player now, who knows. but it’s great that you found some not super toxic people to help you out in the beginning, just remember to soak up as much as you can on the game as a newcomer ;)
---
“I call this ‘Bold and Brash’”
---
Love when people on siege aren’t toxic

It’s all fun and games until cops show up to ask wtf is going on and so you interrogate the police

You’ll get the dlc ops included in the gold edition right away base ops are still only available after purchasing them with renown

If you have questions, feel free to DM me.  I used mnk for a bit so I have some experience with it if you’re legitimately considering.
---
He means bad. For real.
---
Let me elaborate. Your main, Finka, was initially designed to give you a speed boost. She proved **too frikking broken** in alpha test that they dropped it to barbed wire boost, which in itself was broken so they dropped that as well.
---
All in all, speed boosts have been tested to be broken and won't ever make it to siege.
---
As for stationary stuff, extra armour beyond 100 health is also broken which is why doc and finka have it temporary, but are  only effective against guys with bad aim. And have sh*t guns to go with them. Now being stationary in siege is suicide which is why lion was, and still is broken. Any speed loss is a huge disadvantage in siege and gaining not much of a an advantage since this game has 1 shot headshot is a waste. You lose whatever you have for nothing.

I know what intrusive and exclusive mean. The ways they monetize their game are in no way intrusive to the most important aspect of the game and that is gameplay which is why it is monetized well

---
There are elements of the game that are far more futuristic than both of these ideas and the body suit idea isn’t even that closely related to those games.
---
Honestly when a map and the bans make a game heavily favored to one or the other it seems like it ends up favoring the team that goes down 0-3 a lot of times in my experience. Especially if defense is favored. You can throw them off by going with the third best room first since you have to win all three anyway and then when you make it 3-3 it’s a lot more demoralizing to blow a 3-0 lead than it is to go down 3-0 and now get the chance to switch to the side that just won every round.
---
its just like that one simpsons episode

Out of all my years of playing this game I have never been in a hostage game where dude killed the hostage. I’ve only seen people make jokes about it. Maybe one day

Oof

IT just pulls stats from a public site and compares said stats to everyone. Average W/L and K/D and MMR is how they get the percentage. I believe. I looked at their API for the Overwolf app.

I abused her when it was broken and i think the nerf was well deserved. Shes still fun but recoil is nothing like it was

Ok buddy cool your jets I’ve played since before black ice and yah maybe your rank suffered because you somehow can’t handle different objs then bomb but anyone with enough skill/experience in this game can appreciate enough options and when they take game features out to make people feel like a pro then that’s just alienating a laaarge portion of the player base.  Oh and maybe the skilled players prefer playing “unbalanced shit like hostage” actually like the game modes and think they add a little twist that makes people change up their play style.
---
You sound like a 12 year old who just got  his ass handed to him and sent back to silver- my main point is just that everyone whose played wants something to show for their skill without needing to ditch 2/3 of the game content

Hey I dont really care about ur rank/age but you clearly assumed mine had something to do with my opinion and the whole point is that just because pros don’t like to deal with the objs doesn’t mean it’s not enjoyable for the rest of the player base
---
And I truly cannot understand why competitive games enjoy when the roles stay the same for 3/4 rounds- I really doubt there hasn’t been games like the 3-0 scenarios in ranked
---
And why does that matter?
---
Yeah but what Monty doesn’t know here is that Jim Gordon’s gadget actually is a direct line to the bat cave for backup, not the special glasses.

Refering to a post made abit ago, two in progress games joined, both ended up with me leaving. ( first post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cvkjji/this_shit_happens_way_too_often_for_it_to_be_okay/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share ) Solo queue players have NO ptroections from abuse like this. Ubi NEEDS to do something. STARTING WITH PUNISHING PLAYERS THAT DO THIS.
---
People defending this shit will defend anything Ubisoft does to this game.
---
When Ubi adds a FOMO-style time limited daily store to the game, these guys will defend it, when they add another digital currency to confuse people even more into buying shit, these people will defend it.

Whenever this map comes up in cas, my team and I give up objective and have an open tea party for whoever wants to join in

You need to report in-game, Sony won’t do much of anything if someone is exploiting in-game.
---
That’s not an epic gamer move
---
I think if got P90, he would have been a great operator. 
---
He could replace Doc or Rook as someone slightly more selfish but less gun-power Anchor.
---
Because the time to kill is incredibly fast and dependent mostly on who gets to shoot first.  Positioning and intel plays a much larger role and in organized play a significant number of kills come down to prefire.  You can't purely aim your way out of situations like you can in other FPS games.
---
Thems the ones.
---
You also probably need a squad.
---

Battle passes are the reason I quit cod and other games with battle passes

“DUDE THAT WAS A HEADSHOT!” 😂😂

maybe not the best place to ask but how do you get the thing next to your name that says "blitz main" for example
---
What is that skin? Looks nice
---
And deleted all the comments lol
---
I wonder if that's the same guy I was talking to.
---
You are right in that the games strength is that every game is different. I think the games core is so strong that the other modes aren't really needed, especially as new ops come in and maps are updated regularly. 
---
Limiting the modes to only bomb also makes map balancing an easier task. Only having to balance for bomb is easier than having to balance for bomb and secure. 
---
Repetition in strategies is exactly what pick and ban is supposed to eliminate, at least in theory. As for the 0-3 games, changing the order shouldn't change the outcome. If anything repetition should allow you to better understand the opponent and counter on the spot. Outside of that the only real issues are maps and matchmaking, both of which have been issues since well before the ranked changes. If anything the ranked changes only further highlight those issues, not the other way around.
---
lmao that's amazing. can't really blame you though, tower is ass

I buy it to " support" , the value it has is nowhere worth of 30 bucks. so yeah i buy it but that doesn't mean i am happy with the contents i get! im buying with a different motive!

Tbh I get where you're coming from cause with the p90 his gadget would be in full use imo like a site that came to my head, penthouse on coastline its notorious for people pushing in from main window with smom3s and flashes so he could help out alot with the plant denial but thinking about it you bought a moment of revolution to me cause I thought he would be a pretty good close roam operator like smoke or vall, but anchoring is the way to go

Its okay...

Nice

No way you’re “almost diamond” with no map knowledge.

Not trash. Well the current season isn't to hot. But I guess its popular to hate on the popular games which I feel sorry for people who do

I dont have this I just have 4 stacks kick me out of the game as soon as I join
---
Wow nice
---
Yep.
---
&gt;You don’t have to play ranked during that week plain and simple.
---
So you're literally admitting I'm right.
---
&gt;you play with 4 other people who can have the pass.
---
Same thing.
---
&gt;there isn’t ever an operator who can change the game because you don’t have them, when someone else does.
---
Ela and Lion say hi.
---
You’re already the face of the subreddit, might as well
---
I used to mainly play casual and sweat in ranked. Then they made casual sweaty and toxic with mm so I only played ranked. Then they got rid of maps and modes in ranked. Now I'm looking forward to Modern Warfare and dropping this stale old turd.
---
Whyyyy.... You seem like a person to care about the gameplay and battle passes have 0 effect on gameplay. Its just cosmetics behind a paywall... You quit games cus of cosmetics behind a paywall. Give me a break from the stupidity.
---
Yo, did you Play Casual that day on 3 am? Was that dude you?

Idc about cosmetics behind a paywall as much as you do ig

It’s not it’s an abundant meat too

Good god I wish I was there for her to interrogate me.... Wait did I say that out loud?

who the fuck grinds for cosmetics in a competitive fps
---
1. you die so much faster than in other games
---
2. in this game you don't only need aiming to be good
---
I would  tk that dumb doc every round if I had the chance, god what an idiot

The next attack operator should have a new weapon because fuck this reusing bullshit

Imo Nøkk should not "spill it" when being interrogated. Kinda fits her character and also her gameplay style as she usually enters the building alone.
---
Calm down mate 😂
---
I’ve been seeing this happen to me too when I’m spectating someone else too.
---
F2 I believe is the best gun in terms of dps and difficulty to use, the recoil is not crazy as c8-sfw but it is enough to a point where you consciously need to control it unlike most guns like ump and r4c. Even though L85A2 is the defining gun for average in siege I think the overall balance of Famas is the best.
---
Nøkk should get a buff where she doesn't "spill it" when being interrogated. Would fit her character and also her gameplay as she usually enters alone
---
You got bamboozled look at you
---
LOL

But that's nothing on Ubi's side. M$ and Sony is the problem, as always.

&gt;yknow whats the difference between a critic and an internet troll? a critic gives a subjective opinion on what he doesn't like about it, and what the person can improve on it. an internet troll instantly starts slamming his keyboard just because he doesn't like it for god knows what reason and chooses to flame
---
Badumm.....you don't even know the difference between subjective and objective. It's the other way around. So maybe you shouldn't call out people on obvious typos when you don't even know the meaning of words. Bitch.

I don't think it would make everyone happy. This game is trying to be competitive with evolving/dynamic meta and by adding new contect, you're attracting new players. Without it, we would have stale meta. I personally find it really cool to see how are teams adapting to new operators and how many teams have completeley different starts and approach to the game

Shhhh no one else has noticed and also if you want zero effort put into everything ok

The animation is super crisp and the skin itself, although plain, is very polished and looks good. Overall it's just a really clean elite, but I can see why some people think it's boring
---
I will be honest and say that the paid packs in siege are absolutely horrendous, I don’t like how it’s a chance to get something that you may like. But I would rather the battlepass be there aswell just because you know what you can get, I know it’s greedy but no one really suffers from it. I do see what you mean and I mostly agree with you, the pay wall thing is not healthy as a whole. But that is how Ubisoft makes their money, it’s a business and there main goal is to maximise their profits. But if they do put any pay to win features within the battle pass everyone will go apeshit (including myself). But I will give ubi the benefit of the doubt this one time.

No, I'm not talking about CS Dust 2. I'm talking about the great Rainbow Six Siege of the first two years.  I don't want to take today's Rainbow away from anybody either. Only an additional Classic Mode for fans of the old Rainbow I would like.

Thanks, I try to (not always sucessfully). I don't have anything against ppl who did this as i used the tactic myself multiple times. I also know that some ppl want it in the game and this is their right. I simply believe that the game is better off without it.

Just remember what else is in the Clancyverse here. SkellTek, Third and Fourth Echelon, so on, In the Clancyverse, these aren’t unrealistic operators, in fact they are more realistic than say, Buck or Sledge, because they are High Tech in harmony to the Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell series’. They are all linked, in canon, too.
---
Yes. Next.  Do you know what that means? Not right now. Not yesterday. In the future.

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Nice ace. They were very potato but you played pretty well. My only question is why do you use the extended barrel on buck? I've always found the muzzle brake to be the best for him since he has so much first shot recoil.
---
What are they?
---
Don’t keep that cup at the edge of the table where your hands are, I learned that the hard way
---
Well i got the same issue in the TTS.
---
&gt;I will never complain about cosmetic-only monetization systems
---
so i guess lootbox gambling is fine as well.
---
yeet
---
Well, only time will tell. If the battle pass does well, it means that Ubi knows about business more than you do at least.
---
wAlL HAcKs
---
Valk - great intel gathering with mediocre gun (great if you have good aim) and valuable C4. Desert eagle is also decent for some soft destruction, you will rarely use SPAS. 
---
Frost - great for lower ranks where people don't drone or against teams that take too much time to attack. Her traps are easily destroyed but useful in specific scenarios. Her SMG isn't actually bad, really stable weapon but with below average rate of fire. She brings barbed wire + bulletproof cam as her additional gadget.
---
tl;dr - Valkirye, great intel gathering operator always gravitating close to meta of the game
---
That's a beautiful black ice, pretty old as well counting it was one of your first packs!
---
Actually, I think Warden may be more useful now as the new shields and op will probably bring anchoring back somewhat. That said both he and Nokk suffer from the same problem... There's always someone better to pick.
---
As a jackal main it hurts that I never get to play one of my favorite ops because people are annoyed by how good is ability can be
---
Because what’s the point of posting it
---
bruh they need the money to support the game bruh, they dont make enough they need this pass bruh /s
---
What's worse is that if your tower is under that.
---
Anything for you son &lt;3
---
It doesen't show my team's rank to me. How can I fix it?
---
But didn't originally, hence what he meant they learnt from.
---
He also can't move around as freely as his gun isn't as good as a long ranged sniper that can two shot and highlight enemies at any range.
---
You gotta use your drones on attack homie. I know it slows the pace down quite a bit but it's worth it.
---
I once had 2221 renown
---
What does this mean to those of us who do not speak like a moron?
---
Excuse me?
---
Badger did that during a show match lmao
---
True, it only gets posted repeatedly throughout the day, every day.
---
Now you have to get 6969!
---

---
She doesn’t look like a wiry Emo girl who stole her dads motorcycle helmet now
---
Gone, reduced to atoms.
---
Tf u mean hes also makin a joke lol
---
Literarily no one told you their arnt ddosers, your just stupid
---
No it’s her grandma’s uniform, Mira is the one wearing it
---
But how is that a joke
---
Eyyyyyy Flynt Coal?
---
This is satisfying to look at.
---
i dont think so cuz twitch made maestros zap thing so they both do the same
---
I would highly suggest not using ur mouse keys for leaning since it can interrupt ur aim. You can assign new keys on ur keyboard for ur leans and practice them. I used to use my mouse buttons as well but it affects aim so switched to keyboard
---
#{-}7
---
Old but gold
---
actually wanted to shotgun him but then i realized what operator i was playing
---
Yeah it took some time getting used to it, but in the end was worth it.
---
Almost stopped reading when you said that Echo isn't OP. He is banned in &gt;90% of the matches for a good reason.
---
I agree, pick &amp; ban plays the biggest role in competitive settings with premade teams and maybe has a slight impact on high mmr ranked matches...but the idea is to improve the competitive environment and add more dynamic into ranked. I think in the end, it's not up to which operators are banned but WHY are they banned. Communicating with teammates is most important part. I often jump into soloq matches and ask people "why do you want to ban this operator" and in most of the cases they have no argument and decide to pull back their vote. Try to discuss operator bans with teammates and after you decide "ok, if we ban Lesion, we can easily play montagne" or something like that.
---
Also, no reason to ban ash. Gadget wise, there are operators that can fulfill her role of soft breacher. Fragging wise - there are other operators that can be played as fraggers. I believe that every good ash player can perform equally good on different operators
---
You would have the opposite problem with her being OP (Since Ubi said so when she had an AR, and the PDW9 is basically a stronger than average AR).
---
Not gonna lie, kinda jealous
---
Villa is a good map because it's fair. Feels really well balanced between attackers and defenders.
---
You’re the 4th person to point that out thanks
---
The lord giveth, and the lord taketh away.
---
Her gadget is already considered not so great, and weapons are bad, so, I doubt that it would be a problem.
---
It’s a one time use thermite
---
Whoever says Rook can't roam are moronic imbeciles who probably main Jaeger.
---
Battlepasses are always a fucking bad thing, especially in a paid game. The fuck is wrong with y'all?
---
yes, you can find it sonewhere on yt, shame he couldnt get a kill tho
---
Clash is annoying
---
Maestro is echo with a better gun and worse gadget
---
Nomad is annoying
---
Really though who actually plays T hunt in this game as anything other than a way to kill some time whilst you wait for friends to finish a match or as a way of just practicing mechanics.
---
Yes exactly
---
you bloody genius. this is great!
---
Just bought myself a steering wheel for F1 2019, guess what ill be doing tonight!

Eh well there is nothing you can do about team killing groups to next season. If there harassing you just mute chat

excuse me?
---
Hmm
---
Good idea
---
The brake is unused At the Moment:D
---
Don’t forget Blackbeard the noobs operator
---
That is not the point. It is free.
---
If you want those supposed cool skins then you can buy the BP.
---
Ohh
---
I mean.. it is kinda is true.. sure I'm no engine expert, but I write software for a living, and the same rules apply to everything..
---
Limitations are usually for the amount of information you can store in your memory, theres often different memory pools that get used for different things and yes you can only load a finite amount of stuff into them
---
However, WHAT you load into them can be varied enormously, you don't have to load everything at once... there's hardly ever any reason for having to limit your choices down unless you're doing some weird shit
---
Nice ace! Didn't you post this a while ago or am I officially losing my mind?
---
Pepega means you are a cutie
---
&gt;  Love the whole picking apart the comment, do me next.
---
&gt;Haters gonna hate... I think it's great and you're an asshole :)
---
I mean, that's how you respond to multiple point or big multi line answers, you're being kinda stupid here.
---
Dude pulse is so good, Play the shotgun and the pistol with 8 shots + c4 and you'll get ez kills if you're somewhat good on r6
---
damn
---
\- Familiarize yourself with common entry points.
---
\- Watch cameras to see where most enemies spawn.
---
\- Have an anchored teammate work with you on cameras to help you move.
---
\- Call out who (which operator) and where they are.
---
A battle pass itself is one of the fairest ways to make something like that especially since in most games you can earn enough in game currency to pay the next one (why do I doubt that ubisoft will do it?) but it's not the same in a game where a season pass and loot boxes and lootbox events already exist.
---
Let's play spot the incel

I see you've understood my name

I usually tend to roam on the opposite side of the map or middle of the map either top floor of same level as objective. Usually depends on which map and where the objective is.

i thought that too but i like beer so....😂

Unsure weather you’re going with the joke or just retarded?
---
i mentioned "Without saying the truth" . So the guy in the picture said the truth at least . I still don't understand , Being honest will get you lots of hate instead of lying.
---
They are fixing this next season. They will be making it so if a player in a squad gets RFF then the whole squad gets it. I'm also hoping that with the addition of the unranked playlist that the players that do these kinds of things do it less in ranked (where it can negatively impact your rank). Also, posting the names of others on this sub is against the rules. It sucks that people are doing this and I wish you the best.
---
Cross playform is the future tho
---
Far from my favourite, just trying to show reason.
---
I understand it may be hard for you to get off the BP hate train because it seems cool to be part of it. But really you are hating something that literally doesn't affect you. You are criticising something like it is a mandatory purchase to carry on playing the game. 
---
"BP bad because big company don't need more money" is the main reason behind everyones hate towards the BP. Yet the company making money literally effects them only positively because they are getting free skins from the BP.
---
Good counter argument btw, shows why you're jumping on the hate bandwagon.
---
reverse back to you (uno joke if you didnt understand)
---
I don't see why it's an issue that there's simply more stuff you can buy.
---
You right I think I rember this video. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM but idk

you are correct, but the audio for the last clip didn't work

Pretty cool seasonal skin, one of the last decent.
---
Thanks man!
---
It’s fairly rare to go 3-0 on one side so you’ll get at least 2 rounds on the other side which seems quiete good imo. It’s like it was before but you can build momentum
---
Oh yeah definitely,  I can't wait
---
I tried this, I failed miserably.
---
Yes they're only called seasonal because you can only buy them for a limited time but you can use them forever
---
That hesitation to look to her right hahahah

Acog on defense...
---

I see, thanks friend!

^This. Kills are nice but if you peek a window and fail to get the kill LEAVE. Best to move on to another area, atleast you weakened them.
---
I thought she was in the commonwealth . Alright i'll ask the brotherhood of steel to lend me one of their vertibirds
---
Honestly it’s part of the game , no different than the gross noob tube from the cod franchise. Only thing think you can do is learn different spots to spawn/don’t run out of spawn but keep your gun up and wait. You’ll soon learn that there are just some bad spots to spawn from. On house it’s river docks, bank any of the spawn spots honestly, helo pad on skyscraper. The best way you can counter this is to not drone objective but drone out these spawn peeking spots and it helps give you an advantage that they’re there. I somewhat agree with the changes to maps but spawn peeking can be countered by droning, aiming better, and get some humility by not trying to out agro the defender. 
---
What system are you on? I play pc and can help if you’d like
---
The MMR works on the same principles, but I'm fairly certain that casual matchmaking is optimized more for speed of matchmaking (i.e. it accepts lower quality matches in order to make them faster) than ranked is.

Nuce. Now make a porn w/her.

Uh oh

Turn off V-Sync if its on

I like secondary gadgets on my mouse button so I can quick peek and toss a C4 or a flashbang. The enemy literally can't hit you and you're able to move freely with a gadget it hand.

keep in mind overwatch is a one time payment of 40 dollars

---
I use the 10 key mouse use front row for crouch and lean  2nd row is gadget knife and grenade
---
3d row pinging and camera controls etc and last few rows I have programmed but don’t really use in r6 other game like PUBG though every button is used to it’s full potential
---
That would buff Valk as well and Ubi probably don’t want that.
---
If you save them there's a multiplier that was teased that if you get a certain number of commons in a row in a string of openings you get a legendary or epic
---
Nah they should change the casual instead of adding unranked gamemode
---
I bought the season pass and I didn’t even know this skin existed.
---
You could only get the skin if you got before March 4th or something like that
---
Wait- casual MMR is a thing....? I thought casual matchmaking was practically random

Thank you!

I think the mp5k fits her better. She is perfectly balanced and don't need an acog(balanced in the meaning of her weaponry).

I play with a logitech g29 ahaha so I had to tweak with the settings so i could actually make the hairpin in Monaco

hey fellow red dooter!

This is some solid advice! I'll see about putting some of it into effect after work today.

DDos or someone on the other team force switched your server for an ez win
---
At a gamecon, I think, it makes more sense to search an unarmed guy, rather than one carrying enough ordnance to take over a small country... :)
---
I think that with his helmet you’d see less of his personality but more importantly it might make the skin too similar to Rook’s elite.

What i would do is take the defuser, tk, and just try to throw

Is this for the new console update? Finally there's a way to lean on console.
---
thats not youtube
---
i see what u did there XD
---
Yea I get that but some guns are good and underused. Like IQs LMG as I stated. So they might get people to use it more.
---
Youre basically calling the ops that op mentioned terrorists
---
Bro, had anyone been in that room you'd be dead

Those beaulo flicks man
---
This was a long time ago dude. I don’t think he cares
---
Oooh, nice Warden one. My person fave out of these. All great though
---
I hope this is /s
---
&gt;active
---
Exactly. It's always safer to introduce something less active and less "involved" in counter terrorism activities into a game played by almost all age groups.
---
I'm sure thats true but people can still notice that if they go from 230 fps to 150 that nothing happened instead of 120 to 40 and not be able to play because of fps drops
---
So?
---
you should set it up so pressing both at once does vault
---
If you just melee without cancelling it's a litte more jump scarey. They  don't see you quite as long
---
*Here comes Buck rounding turn 3 in the center lane in the Blue F1 McLaren*

:D the guy below me is so butthurt its kinda funny xD

I have mine at 5 each because a higher deadzone made the game feel clunky and unresponsive.
---
Although,I understand that drift causes problems.
---
Totally not a repost
---
This is actually what I’ve used for 400+ hours, I highly recommend it
---
Whenever you attack if you aren't using your drones I would recommend that. I see a lot of people that don't use their drones and die to an enemy that they could've spotted. If you want to work on your aim, going into a terrorist hunt and setting your gun to single fire can be beneficial. This will promote getting headshots and will teach you to aim at head level. VarsityGaming has a series on youtube called "Siege School" where he provides tips that are helpful to newer players. If you have any questions about anything, message me and I will answer them to the best of my abilities :)
---
Both Hibana and terrorists have hoodies, he might have not recognized you ;)
---
I know.
---
Sometimes the game will boot the DDOSers and their teammates though.
---
Time Crisis vibes
---
Imagine thinking that this very common play is map awareness
---
No. Not at all. even "basically", no such statements were made. I did not say "CTUs like Israel's" and also mentioned "fictional", turning the conversation towards fictional vs realistic to show that they want as less a link to real life (and it's related problems) as possible.
---
I am confused how you would draw such a conclusion when nothing even remotely similar was even intended, let alone stated.
---
My coffee is everywhere. This is why reddit is probably my favorite platform ever.
---
The first run out was spicier tbh. Both together makes this pretty juicy.
---
MAYBE??
---
Those are both cosmetic only tho
---
These all look great! My favorites are the Fuze and Warden ones.
---
Id guess that its not an issue with lesion but an issue with the hitbox on zofia while exiting the stand up animation

They are fixing it in Ember Rise, Leavers get a much longer ban

What kind of tweaks? So far I have my wheel at 290 degrees turning radius for F1.

Do you have twitch prime?

Is it a legit twitch prime?
---
Lava six is not a skin. It us a charm. A "6" numbered charm that is like a magma rock.
---
"Volcano" is the universal skin that was only available if purchased before the start of y4. All year pass specific gun skins are only available if bought before the start of the year.
---
Yep, linked to my amazon and everything
---
Yes
---
It's got good potential. Some filters, straps, paint and tape and you'll be set

Why the fuck can I see it?

Got’em
---
Reinstall didn't help?
---
Something thats helped me through all of my video games: Learn to survive first. Learn when to disengage, especially if playing a trap character. 9 times out of 10, players in casual will chase a Kapkan right through a entrypoint, catch that kapkan trap.
---
Umm... You are gold 4 with a 0.82 KD. Not saying thats bad just saying don't lie for a carry

Aren't Peacock and fire Beta skins, I have both and I know that peacock is but wasn't sure about Fire, either way, anyone with those two skins automatically qualify for a veterans discount.

Well yeah. It was a seasonal skin

When you compare terrorists to special forces which are the direct opposite of each other it just doesnt make sense, you didnt directly mention the israeli but thats what this Post was about so i dont know who else you would be  talking about.
---
Also about the fictional thing it isnt true because to this day most of the ops that have been released are from real life special forces not fictional so there is no truth to that point.
---
Was I?! Was this for Raleigh? Cause unfortunately I wasn't there! Im Australian based so could fly over for it :(
---
I'm pretty sure that there aren't any packs or anything. It should just show up in her cosmetic inventory
---
Thanks mate 😁

You may have used a wrong Ubisoft account like I did or you may have forgot to claim the actual skin.

It’s an alpha pack isn’t it?

No, they go on middle mouse button and Q button.

I'm not complaining there is nothing you can do.
---
I'm complaining that it is a poor game play mechanic. It remains the most piss-poor part of a round of R6. What is compelling gameplay about it? "Ah attackers have to watch their approach" - but it isn't about awareness, or anything other than muscle memory and memorization. There is no tactical or strategic layer to it. You just do it, like a robot, every round and then move onto the decision making process once you're at or near the structure.
---
I was playing on the test server

&gt;my go-to for any game that has leaning

Only Siege for me. In other games melee and prone are there.

it’s not
---
&gt;I start out with almost default except a couple keys I have to change (Like I can't reach left ctrl on my keyboard) with plans of changing it once I get a feel for the game. After a little bit of playing, I change them up
---
What, why? Doesn't make sense. The first thing I do in ANY game is change keyboard settings to my fitting. And it's always the same in any game.
---
Did it happen while you werent dead too?
---
... relatable comedy?
---
yeah
---
dude you forgot that 98% of this sub are silver or below. Everything a plat does is high IQ for them

yes we testing the aimbot with teamkilling and it worked just as well
---
Reminds me about the censorship of Sex and Reproduction but heavily promoting violence and killings and robberies in movies and games.
---
Who cares if someone swears in a 18+ game who cares if two people kiss on Television. Everyone cares when there's a shooting or bombing near their place of residence. 
---
DDOSing is an illegal crime yet Ubi doesn't give 2 shits about it, now if we were talking about the infamous "N-word" that would be a different story.
---
What a pointless post then

It just seems like you’re clicking when it changes, not the other way around.

Sure. Why not?

Haha honestly the Genuine can be had for as little as £500. It’s not 1000s at all. That’s more stepping into the Titanium and rarer visored versions.

They should make this a skin
---
My first ace was with Hibana on Oregon. The site was basement and I ended up opening a hole above the stairs and got a 2k. The other 3 kills were from people rushing me while I sprayed them with a Bearing 9.
---
Facts it doesn’t equate to skill
---
You on the TS or?
---
This is how Warden can see through smoke...
---
Shields now down rather than kill outright, I forget the reason

You said you died four times to spawn peeks in one match.  You said the only way to stop it is the memorize all the peeks and prefire them.  Now you say you're not complaining that there's nothing you can do.
---
It's not really much more than a test of how smart your opponent is and if they're paying attention.  It's giving your opponent a chance to make a mistake.  I just don't see what you want here other than to cry about how you got spawn peeked four times in one match and then refuse to admit how stupid it is to let that happen when everyone thinks that's a ridiculous and inexcusable mistake.  Obviously your opponents thought you were awful and an extremely slow learner for them to keep doing it, and obviously they were right.

I use shift for left lean and alt for right lean. Feels the most natural as I have full wasd control while being able to lean with pinky and thumb. 🤷‍♂️

Wait so that's you in the vid? What language is that?

This is a PSA on why you never try to run in a door with a teammates claymore outside of it.

Alright, thanks for the help

Were you able to figure out the problem? I used all base Ops again in ranked wins one by one as well, but haven't gotten the trophy. It's the last one I need for 100% completion.
---
My first ever rank was gold 4 but I got super lucky with my teams
---
I think you need to OWN all of the original 20 ops.

Hello Olloolol! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:

Also, watching the g2 esports skin reveal said the skin will be available on the 10th. Assuming the skin us available in the  new season, that's when it will be released.
---
What device
---
PC
---
I kinda doubt she'll get nerfed. The delay between grapple and readying your weapon really limits her options. From what I played on the test server hot insertions are pretty much suicide.
---
Any r6 community just ask around
---
I own and have played with every single operator in game. I've actually atleast won a round of ranked with every operator in game as well (besides possibly Clash).

you are obviously 12, and probably shouldn't be on the internet.
---
When someone kills the enemy you were going to interrogate
---
Possibly, but it seems like you get more epics when you buy them in bulk with renown then earning them
---
Why would they? If they’re default skins (they should be) they’ll sell for renown and credits.
---
Does your gf own....a foxtail...buttplug?

There’s a similar bug where you hear ela pull a grzmot mine over and over

That’s neither here nor there

Maybe don't step on any suspicious rugs in there, just to be sure
---
I love how Tachanka was determined to watch that hallway even though they were already on site.
---
I can understand that changing the system this late into the game and that yes it could be easily exploited, but to be honest it already is, just run a 4 man and kick the random for no reason, I know people get banned on PC for throwing, and I can't speak for PS4 players but on xbox you report someone nothing happens, they don't get banned or penalized for it and if they do it's very rare
---
lol OP is in a custom game.
---
how bad is 350 - 400 miles away?

Now now, brother Bradley, let's not get too ahead of ourselves......

Just like irl

I'm confused. In phantom sight it shows Nokk and Warden, while on the TTS it shows Amaru and Goyo.

Yeah but I can't take direct control of them and make them kill people

You don't need to download anything from the website, open the ubisoft app, click on games, click on siege, click on challenges, click on either weekly or the other idk its name, and collect what you want

I’ve seen this strat here too and I’m pretty sure a Sledge died in that clip too which is why it seems like a repost... if this is you though then good shit, been meaning to try this out with Maestro
---
Still looks better than Cav without face paint
---
You’re so freaking lucky.
---
Look at the kill feed :)
---
Lion doesnt have one either and he's GIGN
---
and?
---
Mind you, that's just a replica. I knew a guy on FB who'd export real ones for some $250-350, but I fell outta contact with him.
---
i guess they could add a punishment system if they kick people too often.
---
but i long term solution would be very difficult to make unless they opt to remove kicking entirely which is highly unlikely
---
I ended up getting 2 more this game they weren’t very good
---
A Lion elite is my dream. They could do some crazy stuff to the drone in the sky
---
this is too relatable
---
Grey Shop also has Kapkan's vest and plate carrier. SSO Smersh w/ VOG pouches and some extra pouches and a Defender II, respectively.

She's even more terrifying.

Yo u/SAU-SIEGE

Nope, that's most likely a replica. Grey shop hasn't sold the real one since atleast 2017, AFAIK.
---
Oh, I see what you mean now. I've heard some people say that it looks like Nokk and Warden's but just foggy. I personally think that it's the image they use for the reflections on Jaeger's visor, Warden's glasses, etc. For what it actually is, I have no idea.

Still looks better than without the face paint

I guess most people consider killing all 5 to be an ace but I don’t see why it wouldn’t still count
---
It’s not that it’s in the rewards, operation phantom sight fan kit and fan kit burned horizon. 
---
They’re both free and when I click on it it says I need to go to Ubisoft website to download it and it shows a link so I copy it and I’m in the website but when I go to my rewards to download it just loads a blank screen
---
Zofia's in the upside down. Now Ela is the superior sister.

Coulda set Yackety Sax as the background track.

She has been with those bedroom eyes she gives me every time I pick her

Oh fuck the bomber turned off its lights

It relates to the first thing he says
---
No. An an ace is 5 people, not 4.
---
are u hurt?
---
Practicality or memes, super 90 for memes, lmg for practicality
---
Well I just wiped point a team of 4 but I still did not get the same feeling as killing all 5
---
r/softwaregore
---
An ace is killing the entire enemy team so yes
---
Sledge great gun low recoil or jackal or lesion for low recoil as well
---
If they add a punishment for kicking too often I think that would slowly solve the problem
---
An ace is technically killing everyone on the enemy team, but people think it's cooler if you kill five.
---
Still killed the whole team
---
Technoblade
---
Zofia can be fun, so can Mozzie.

Too close, buddy
---
I want this for PS4! Those L3/R3 presses aren’t fluid enough
---
Yeah I didn’t get the same sort of rush/energy killing 4 instead of killing 5
---
It’s an ace. It might not be as badass as a full squad wipe ace, but it’s 10000% an ace.

I think i should become a "credit goes to X" bot
---
Awesome!
---
I think my reasoning behind it is that obviously its a more underutilized weapon and as of recently Ubisoft have been giving the newer ops more rarely seen weaponary. Also that would make her into a silent sniper archetype and I think Ubisoft did think of that as in one of her promo pictures she is seen holding a sniper rifle. But that's just my two cents about this situation
---
Twitch or Jackal have a strong primary.
---
Buck is decent as well
---
This had to have been casual.
---
Yeah what? That literally makes no sense

Well isn't he supposed to be a good reinforcer i think he should get one more castle and wall reinforcement probably not a good idea tho

this would be a lot better if a weren't a custom game

Though I have seen games where the loading times take up to 30-40 minutes. I think that's a bit excessive and they should be removed.

i posted mine over a week ago. i killed a ying. and this sledge had a chance to break the cams.

Sledge mains coming out of the woodworks for this post, figuratively and literally.
---
This is epic!
---
It took me about 400 hours to become moderately alright and place low gold
---
I am at 1000 hours now and I gotta say learn your maps and your operators. Knowing is over half the battle, then make sure you get practice. Also don't set your sensitivity too high
---
Gridlock has an amazing LMG and gadget but is a bit pricier than older ops
---
she had an ar and not an sr, and with a sr she would be probably even worse (unless the sr is op ofc) when you really want to give her a new weapon she should have a good mp or a solid ar
---
So you're whole thing is that you had some stupid teammates while solo queueing and you want, what?  Attackers to be invincible until they're in the building?  Attackers to be invincible for x amount of time each round?
---
And again, you don't have to counter it to the point of killing them in order to prevent them killing you.
---
That's even more impressive. I bet you made quite a bit of mistakes xD

By any chance did you mute the voice chat of your team? Sometimes when you do that the yellow ping of teammates dissapear because reasons (tested with a friend)

---
I think that when she uses her gadget on a window, it should only break down when she actually impacts the window. Having it break when she activates her gadget is really idiotic cuz it gives the defending team a substantial amount of time to prepare for her breach. A breaching charge is already much better because doing the jump breach gives debris/smoke from the explosion to help cover you on the way in.
---
Is it out right now?
---
Hilarious meme, my friend, truly original
---
YOUR SO LUCKYYY

ESL rules are vague and say "subject to approval."
---
Don't put them where there's already a trap ie frost and don't put them close to where an anchor may be positioned onsite. Apart from that randomness is good.
---
I found the timing funny how it took only 4 bullets to kill her
---
please uninstall then. less people complaining about everything in the community is what we need

Ah this is legit lol

I think I have a clip of me doing this to a poor defender.

Cav has seen things worse than you could imagine

Just words mate and the contest he was using it was not directed to any particular person. Basically meaningless.

Ubi: Don't lose it, that's Ash's ACOG.

Needless to say, he lost it.

FMG9 works fine but I think Echo's gun fits the character
---
It’s all fascists to me
---
I know it’s staged but damn it made me laugh anyway
---
Literally the rushing ash mains and spawnpeeking docs have been in the game since beginning and its one of the playstyles that can be easily countered.
---
Siege still is and will be a tactical game and it will always stand out as a game that has its specific playstyle among all competitive shooters
---
I guess it’s a good way to un-ADS and make sure your crosshairs are always gonna be around head level, so just Incase you have to ADS you have a higher chance of headshotting your target. For example in console, high ADS sensitivity is very hard to control so when you’re looking around with high horizontal and vertical sensitivity, the target will be within your crosshairs and if you read my comment you’re probably saying I don’t make sense cause I have no idea what I’m saying and I see no benefits besides hip firing either
---
High IQ plays happening here
---
Am getting AC unity flashbacks
---
If you can't aim well from the hip with shotguns or pistols (me) it's helpful. Any other way to use them, I don't understand. Ex: Laser sights on any primary rifle. I don't get it.
---
I believe u. To be honest.. I just used your comment as a springboard for my joke, my bad.
---
Finka doesn't need a buff, she needs a change that makes her more fun to play without making her stronger... Or maybe even while making her a little weaker.
---
I hipfire all the time. Sometimes you don’t have time to aim and you take the chance by using a fookin’ laser sight. Especially used on shotguns.
---
I don’t see why
---
Do you think you have knowledge of the game for ranked? Sure!
---
Do you have a full party for ranked? Then hell yeah go for it
---
I believe Finka is in a good place right now. Her ability works in a way, that even with barely minimal communication, I can usually use the boost in a way that benefits everyone on the team pretty well, and people get to the cue to take action once I boost.
---
Have you seen the leaks for his Halloween skin? You will love it.
---
So Microsoft and Sony can’t do shit about it?
---
Apparently Ubisoft can’t get any new weapons anymore, it has to do with either the games limit like the limit with maps or the licensing so I guess we’ll just have to see for now.
---
Ok thanks 😊
---
Looks like my math teacher
---
Because it's all one game.
---
If you play on console, Alibi or Maestro. PC, I would say Maestro or Kaid. However, it is mainly based on how you like to play.
---
Take my upvote
---
&gt;God, how slow can you be?
---
&gt;Read the comments you reply to, so you don't look like an idiot the next time. Come back when you've learned to read.
---
Damn, you're a fucking dick. I feel sorry for people around you. 
---
&gt;How is that relevant to anything?
---
Because we are talking about default/ custom keybinds under a Siege subreddit and how you first "check out the game first with default keybinds before changing them" so I assumed we are talking about fps/ tps games and not Company of Heroes or fucking Limbo.
---
Damn, I would have never saw that
---
I have all three alibi us the best if u roam maestro if you check cams alot and laid if you wanna make kids brake there monitor
---
Are you trying to make me hate caveira more or what?
---
Really? One of the highest DPS guns in the game that has long range capabilities and you want to give it to a defender? If they do that the defender should have 0 speed 3 armor and always have a 5 second ping on them.
---
tomorrow
---
An Ela would be cool! Do whoever you want though :)
---
Yeah, they need to bring VR to F1 2020. It’s getting to the point that you can’t be a serious race game without it. Once you start racing in 3D from the cockpit you can’t go back to 2D racing.
---
I fucking snorted
---
You just described a Battle Pass. The missions are designed to be as boring as possible, forcing the player to repeat a playstyle to complete the mission.
---
Apex Legends and PUBG Battle Passes are like "Deal X damage with Y weapon/character". They wouldn't be a nuisance and would be completed naturally during gameplay, like the UPlay Challenges, if the required objective wasn't so overinflated. Then it comes the excuse "the missions must be harder to last till the end of the BP period", but we all know it is to abuse from FOMO and \[force players into buying EXP Boosts\]( [https://cdn-pubg-season-4.pubg.com/static/details/pubg-tix.png](https://cdn-pubg-season-4.pubg.com/static/details/pubg-tix.png) ) to skip the grind. Basically they force you to pay to unlock something you already paid for.
---
I don't like missing out, especially if the devs decide to cut the amount of cosmetic packs available for purchase with Renown to shove the sweet ones behind a double-paywall, but this is milking the money cow down to the bones.
---
I will be nice, elite or non elite?

---
Ubi took that on themselves. We got the skin anyway.
---
Laser sights decrease the hipfire spread by like 20% or 25%?
---
This is useful on shotguns. Dunno about shields,used to be somewhat helpful but now they nerfed shield hipfire again.

True. I didn't because holiday and bust pc

Bro your thatcher cosplay is really fantastic
---
Welcome to rainbow six siege the game with one shot headshot unless the hitboxes are glitching (again) or the servers are lagging (again). Engage in competitive online pvp unless the servers are lagging (again) or you get teamkilled(again) or you get votekicked (again). But most of the time it works fine so yea, a few bad glitches now and then but i've personally not encountered a single hitbox glitch, pov thingy or bad server. 1.5 years, not a single glitch for me

May the Lord bless us

Fuze 1.01 K/D

I'm usually mid gold, may not be very good but I'm enjoying the game
---
mmm. Maestro on PC is very nice and fun to use. It’s also really funny to pull up cameras in ranked, and see normal cams, Maestro cams, valkyrie cams, echo drones, mozzie drones, and bulletproof cameras literally everywhere 😂😂
---
this scares me inhumanly much
---
The fact that ppl still bother to complain is beyond me
---
You look so much more polite telling whoever it is to wait while you finish your phone call than ash does lol
---
Why hoarding all that renown?
---
SAAAAAAAAAME my one friend never plays with me

Since it’s an Ubisoft game, it will come back anyways no matter what. 
---
It is inevitable to appear in an Ubisoft game.

damn homie

i’m indifferent i would say gold cuz shiny but could give away location cuz shine
---
actually fire

Haha... Nice

Also great information for new players
---
&gt; Why not buff the scorpion back up? 
---
Because her scorpion is fine. 
---
&gt; But, counterbalance with an even smaller magazine size, and possibly even increasing Ela's armor rating? 
---
So you acknowledge possible balancing issues yet you still propose these changes?
---
&gt; Right now, at least on console the Scorpion feels practically useless in most situations. 
---
Sorry, console alone shouldn't dictate operator balancing when that operator is completely fine on PC. The only exception was Kaid's shotgun that was literally bugged. Ela's recoil is bad on purpose.
---
&gt; The shotgun is main pick 
---
Then use her shotgun. People don't use Cav's SMG for similar reasons and primary her shotgun.
---
big sad :'(
---
You you're unable to connect your shots then maybe.

I didnt notice my phone was on 69 percent also yeah im just trying to help 🤠😁

is that pokimane without makeup?

Mine only has info and contact mods

Alibi and Lesion have the best and easiest guns to control. Mira's gun and gadget specifically require practice. Ela is the most difficult of the 3 to master and she is very unforgiving.
---
I got u
---
Yep it’s nice seeing nontoxic post in the community
---
yep
---
Really?
---
Yah I would agree
---
Neither
---
Yeah, that's what I've been hearing. I'll probably get her and then Amaru and Goyo.

damn monte be -iq

It’s like the people from caravan palace’s “rock it for me” music video

What! How??

Ela!
---
Yes. I’m a plat 2 and she is almost always a must pick for me in solo queue. I usually play nomad or gridlock just cause I don’t trust teammates

Her gun has an above average DPS and TTK with little recoil and an extended barrel that can carry out her damage to further ranges, so yeah, its fair to assume you're aim is bad if you think her gun is terrible and I'm assuming you'll struggle with any gun with a low ROF.

Idk why you're emphasizing the loudness of her footsteps when her gadget has a silent step component

I also don't know why you'd consider the P10 to be such an upgrade. You said it yourself, an extra 16 dps (or 4%) is probably not gonna be the difference maker. Especially when you're giving up a more consistent 30 round magazine. Like you said simply buffing the FMG9 would probably be a better option for the same result

Her SMG does 412 dps, which is HARDLY above average.
---
Her gun also has an EXTREMELY low firerate which is a killer in this game.
---
Also I like how you're accusing me of being bad, I wonder what rank you are?
