You pick that shit up quick
---
---
---
If Ubi could make it the real Elite Animation. That would be perfect for it.
---
We'll never see him in game anyway #HostageGold4Player
---
No. As far as we know, R6 and Ghost Recon share a universe since they had crossover DLC for Wildlands. Also, anyone who is a true fan of the Splinter Cell series would know that it could never be Sam Fisher.
---
Actually all of ubisofts games are in a single universe. For honor, for example is a video game they have there.
---
Yeah I’m just going to see what looks better on my mains
---
What were you going to suggest, just out of interest?
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
Yeah stuff like stopping exploits would not even be possible a year ago. You don't know you lost something til the moment you lose it. It's kinda like managing money, the more pay you get the more your used to spending. Ones you get a problem and money runs dry, it's hard not to spent money and let go of your previous lifestyle.
---
Omg yes. Noobs, please learn from this.
---
Shit I didn't even know I did that sorry
---
I see. I tought they were different universe even tho they are all in Tom Clancy. Thanks for the info!
---
i personally dont wanna say they are lazy until we get an actual response
---
Nah too many legs
---
If twitter has shown us anything, it's that it will come sooner or later.
---
Coppers the nicest one lmao
---
ohh. yeah, the MP5. and the mp5SD (echo) and the mp5k (mute) all have the same damage model. I've heard some people talk about the fmg's recoil as being worse than the mp5 tho. personally its whatever
---
Hopefully because it would break the game frl
---
You’ve confused content for creativity. We get two operators every single season; they’re slowing down on making new maps because so many of tge older ones have have serious problems to address.
---

---
There’s two different sides to sieges player base.
---
 One side is the casual player base that only plays this game when new content comes out. They play for two weeks and then don’t play again until the next season.
---
The second side is the more hardcore player who plays pretty much every day and understands and cares about the game far more than the casual player. Undo that the core of the game and gameplay in general has to keep being nursed and is far more important than constant new stuff just to appease the casual player.
---
Ubisoft has a hard task trying to keep the game competitive for the veteran players but fun and appealing for the casual player. All things considered they do a good job of both. Put all the game breaking bugs aside and Ubisoft does a good job of maintaining a reasonable balance for siege. As a day one player I don’t give a shit about new operators or weapons. I care about the crappy maps being more competitive and bugs being fixed quicker and stupid op operators being more fun to play against.
---
First time I've hated new operators being added.
---
What do you like more roaming or anchoring
---
I understand your point of view but platinum (the metal) itself is literally the color of silver so I don't understand the change. It doesn't have the consistency with the other ranks anymore.
---
every season they let streamers/youtubers play the new season at a event same time as proleague to kinda promote and tell people about the new season
---
*more popular overall everywhere
---
In Ghost Recon Wildlands, they’ve had two crossover operations. One that features Twitch and Cav, and one that features Sam Fisher
---
As bad as the Skorpion balance was on launch, it needed to be balanced but as a gun the gun is really unique, with its high fire rate high kick, Ela would probably feel really different if she just had an Mp7 or something else, when you think of Ela you 100% think of her gun.
---
Lesion has his T-Shirt Cannon, Ela had the Laser, The R4C Ashe Run gun, The M870 pocket pick, even Jagers Accog is a meme, you can clearly see the guns aren't as background as some people in the comments here think, Jager, is 99% his gun, give him the UMP45 and the meme wouldnt have developed.
---
depends on the circumstances. But i lean more toward roaming.
---
I've always found the FMG recoil to be great, or maybe it's just because I've been using it over the shotty since day one
---
Honestly I’ve stopped playing siege that much since blood orchid, I’ve personally moved to for honor after that and I have never felt that there is a shortage of players, its player count gets bigger and bigger every season
---
People have become pampered with this 4 seasons a year system, this game is complex enough that it could stay interesting and fresh with less frequent updates. Look at counter strike, game has hardly changed at all from its original form for 20 years and people are still crazy about it.
---
Probably alibi then but that final decision is up to you
---
Well you have to tap fire with it at medium range don’t bother using it at long ranges, the smg 11 has a crap ton of recoil but when you get used to it it’s quite good. And it’s lethal in close ranges. But I wouldn’t rely on the smg 11 on sledge unless you have to reload or are in a very close range fight the L85 is a great weapon.
---
Claymores cause invisibility
---
Deployable shields are bugged
---
Clash shoots while covered
---
New breaching animation
---
Ubi: Oh yeah, it's all comin together.
---
Git gud
---
Oof
---
Good lord those are some ugly ass weapon skins.
---
This is sick as hell. The other's in the gallery are as well. Out of curiosity, how long would it take to do the combined wallpapers for the remaining CTUs?
---
Exactly. Hopefully once it launches people will warm up to it
---
when the other team are a 5 stack all on 150+ ping it’s highly unlikely that all their internet is bad
---
So i did some digging. Sam Fisher had a girl child named Sarah Fisher. But they don't have any history in denmark.
---
You might be right, sadly lol
---
A camo suit... Not sure how i feel about it
---
Iunno what you're saying about the rework, it looks like exactly what kafe needs without pulling a hereford.
---
Warden nor nox need good guns. The game is ran by an intel meta, and both operators are looking to shake up that meta.
---
You can't give either of them good loadouts because they're so mechanically strong. Besides that the mpx is honestly a great gun, and the fmg-9 is a bit of a laser.
---
Yes, we've seen the abilities before, but we have 3 hard breachers that have similar abilities, ash and zofia, every trap operator accomplishes basically the same task
---
The only BS thing about this is Nokk getting silent step, *and* vigil's anti-cam ability
---
They are airsoft.
---
Please please please ubi
---
emm, no
---
What rank do you play at, alibi some times struggles at higher ranks because players can avoid triggering the decoys. 
---
Kaid is like bandit on steroids so I’d chose him but it’s your choice.
---
Yet he has the lowest win rate on attack. But he does feel really strong somehow.
---
I'm personally no fan. I like to play with all 3 modes activated, just to have a bit of variety and fun. Sure, i can play casual, but we all know casual can't be compared to ranked, where people leave after dying 24/7 f.ex..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We already had the option to disable whatever mode we didn't like. I'd like it to stay the same way. By all means, implement "pro-league" into bomb version only, if it doesn't suit the other modes, but i'd love it if we could keep all modes for those who don't wanna do bomb-only.
---
But a big plus for actually doing something with ranked mode (Y).
---
huh, i thought it was a mask like vigil. TIL, thanks op!
---
maybe this could be the pro league skin for next season, but idk
---
The previous armor system was fucking awful. Newcomers to the game didn’t stand a chance against higher level people because they had specific armpits which gave them an unfair advantage. The new perk system ensures that the only way somebody has an advantage is by skill and not stats
---
ok?
---
I'm not a true fan of the Splinter Cell ceries but i did some digging. Sam fisher had a child called Sarah. But she never got involved any military thing other than kidnapping by some villians etc. And she surely never went to denmark.
---
I get what you mean but personally I have no problem with them reusing guns if their gadgets are really good (which in this case I think they are)
---
Exceot hes the one defending so he can just hold and algle and force glaz to push
---
How does his ability work? I havent looked at gameplay
---
My man looking like a Gundam pilot right there
---
As a computer scientists: those programms only could check editings on JPEG files, due to the compression.
---
If you take a screenshot of the game with a lossless codec (eg. PNG) you couldn't detect any editing in that regard.
---
Exactly. Bunch of entitled bitches.
---
do them for starter renown and to get a feel for the game
---
Ranked is literally coming out of beta next season. They announced that at the invitational in Feb. They have said many times that they are worrying about the long term health of the game. I.E all of the map reworks this year. With all of the reworks the map pool will become better, they'll have more time to fix issues quicker and general game balance choices. This year alone they've made necessary changes to ash, glaz, ying, blitz and lion. All of those were very strong and contributed to the ranked toxicity. They've changed the game a lot recently and almost all are for the better(looking at you twitch buff).
---
he was on the Pro Potato a third time, idk if you've seen it. If you have he agreed they were playing badly but he also said they hid as much as possible before six inv. They played oregon every other week just for that.
---
Which platform are you playing Siege on anyway?
---
They'll hopefully be able to use their sidearm to defend themselves hopefully.
---
Bro you enjoy other videogames
---
Bro that's kinda cringe bro
---
They’re working on possibly making his gadget louder when using it.
---
It’s going to be in alpha packs :(
---
(I may be wrong but I don’t think there is a legendary headgear that you can buy for any character)
---
Me
---
Wow great post man
---
I love it. They look simplistic and realistic.
---
if you are just sitting still wide in the open and you are in a position where smokes could be thrown on you then youre already dead from being in a shit position. You talk like a gold. It's really not that hard to wrap your head around and at this point I just suspect you're more interested in being right and "winning" the argument rather than finding the truth.
---
they removed they because they are literally game breaking and was fucking with the ranked results so they took them out to fix them
---
The comment I was responding to literally only mentioned BB, I was pointing out the others.
---
she's holding a gun she doesn't even use damn
---
is Nokk the only operator we don't know their name?
---
I play on pc and I didn’t even know you couldn’t hip lean on console 😂
---
Hereford, outback, and fortress still staying in the ranked playlist *sighs* 
---
Just because it’s new doesn’t mean it’s balanced or even fun, cause those maps are pretty much shit
---
I WANT MY FUCKING EXCLUSIVE LIMITED TIME EVENT SKINS AND WEAPON CHARMS!! I REMEMBER WHEN THEY HAD ASH MEDAL 🏅 I NEED THAT BACK TO ASSERT MY ASH MAIN DOMINANCE! ALSO I WANT MY HALLOWEEN HEADGEAR BACK, ALSO MORE CHARMS LIKE THE BIRTHDAY ONES AND THAT REALLY COOL CHARM THAT WAS FROM THAT ONE CHALLENGE BACK IN YEAR 1.
---
It’s been over 4 years now and I’ve had a lot of good memories playing siege on my PS4 but now all thoughts hard earned memorabilia will be forever on my console. Please give us the option to transfer the gear onto our PC account. Or perhaps switch up the accounts? I have my PC and PS4 accounts on the same email so yeah.
---
because the bug was only a problem on clash since it allowed her to shoot through her shield, and none of the other defensive ops have shields
---
I know I was just joking about how fast he made this
---
But letter means it has to be tied to an alphabet, fucking blueberry. (My imaginary racist term for blue people.)
---
That is actually exactly how it works and also why it's such a hassle for Warframe for example to migrate profiles.
---
the MP5SD2 is a good fit for her too
---
Anything doing better then fortnite puts a big smile on my face
---
I mean they did when they weren’t expecting to be in combat (like climbing stuff)
---
Seriously though.  It is sad people can't take the game seriously enough to play fair all the time. Cheating and glitching is crap. This is an esport. It's supposed to be a fair game to prove who has more skill not who cheats better.
---
Awesome thanks for the input and info!
---
Fortnite also has crossplay and it made the news that Sony saw themselves forced to allow it.
---
Lol all of them...
---
Agree with all you said on Warden. I think Nokk is also going to be good for that sort of solo flank as well or just flank watch in general. Like I love the idea of baiting out a Valk runout with Nokk.
---
You are making a BIG statement by saying Spitfire is the only good seasonal skin (excluding the skins you didn't see prior to playing)... Just to list a few: Ancestral Southwest, Retro Steel, Ancient Marble, Renaissance (Certain guns have insane details), Whitehall 1212, Baroque Exalted, and Board Cove are all very detailed and decent looking skins. Compared to previous seasons they have really stepped up their wrapping of the skins on guns and the detail put into it, just look at Azulejos and Onami to compare (interesting skins that often look very crunchy on weapons and ruins the detail).
---
The other day, I messaged someone to let them know they had been reported (just to be petty), and the response I received was “It’s a glitch in the game, it’s not illegal or cheating, because it is part of the game.” 
---
This type of thought process is the problem. Glitches happen, be a decent person and don’t exploit them
---
Okay first. Sorry for yelling caps lock is a bitch. Okay 1st: Fuze is perfect on small maps in rooms to clear put the enemy, the cluster charge is awesome at clearing rooms. 2nd: His guns are spray and pray and usually you hit a headshot most of the time. 3rd: Good speed and good armour operator.
---
Blame Bandit
---
okay? ive been tkd right off the bat and then kicked
---
They said they expect this week but they’ll have something to say Tuesday.
---
The bomb only decision will divide the playerbase. But it will be played choosing not to play siege at all because it will be either the option of casual, and let's be honest casual sucks, or playing a game mode that they don't want to play. A new playlist will divide the playerbase, but it will keep players in the game.
---
Warden has a massively strong ability... He doesn't need a great kit
---
It's only fair If all your characters come over and skins. But not your level.
---
I know they will get more renown and buy more skins but it should be about customer loyalty now. Together this game has come so far
---
Or put him behind the new deployable shield with eyes on default plant spots
---
Nah, this is sims status indicators.
---
I see your point, however; i believe you can acknowledge something happening without showing how it's done. Granted some show you how to counter it, that's all fine and dandy, but to go out of your way and showing others how to do the glitch itself is something different. They could show how to detect if a glitch is happening and how to counter it, but to go step-by-step on how to preform it isn't needed. 
---
Take breathing for example, everyone does it (except my aunt, she's on life support and a machine is doing that for her), but I'm not gonna take out my lungs and show you that the oxygen is being put into my blood stream, converted into CO2 and exhale. Put a small mirror by my mouth and it'll condense from the exhale, that's all you need to prove I'm breathing.  Whereas, DBL doesn't need to show people how the glitch is done, just prove that someone is doing it, and how to counter it.
---
They can just play causual until they arr comfortable.
---
Montange in S tier
---
Ela Jackal and Blitz in A tier
---
Hibana Smoke and Buck in B tier
---
Lion and Thermite in C tier
---
Valkyrie and Blackbeard in D tier
---
I think this tier list speaks for itself really
---
&gt; Bomb is inherently more competitive than the other modes. 
---
Is being less competitive a problem for casual play?
---
&gt;At any point, the balance can swing from attack to defence. The fact that only one attacker can complete the objective adds more options for strategy on both sides. It means that both attackers and defenders have an objective to defend, both before and after plant. 
---
Bruh that can be said about any game mode. One person can plant the bomb. One person can stand in the room. One person can grab the hostage. 
---
&gt; I'm sure someone else can explain the depth of why bomb is more competitive than secure better than I can.
---
I’m not trying to say secure is more or less competitive, i just want to know what people have against secure area. It’s a fun game mode.
---
Welcome to Siege 
---
Hope you stick it out tho man, really sucks
---
Rpd?
---
That’s not a computer that’s a huge phone
---
Pretty bad IMO, Twitch is no where near close to S tier, yes the F2 is one of the best weapons in Siege but her gadget in it's current state is very lack luster. I'd make a separate one for Attack and Defense as well.
---
nice boxers
---
I play bomb only OwO
---
A couple of suggestions:
---
Shockwave's speakers would only play footsteps and movement sounds; also the location would show up on her team's HUD to reduce the chance of them tricking her own team.
---
Firebug has a few issues; if he gets under obj he could light the entire floor on fire, which would be op. My thought would actually be to make him a defender, obviously balancing his guns appropriately, and to make his utility just shotgun loaded with dragon's breath, it could be used in a shock and awe way, similar to flashbangs.
---
Placeholder seems a bit weak as a defender, as you would probably still need to anchor, my though is to make him and attacker instead, as three speed attackers seem a bit underpowered, and a speed boost would make him more suited to attack.
---
I personally think ballerina would be better if her flack vest had health like Blackbeard's sheld, and started with a 50% reduction from explosives,and as it lost health that precent would go down to zero.
---
  
---
I love all the new maps and ops and think they would be a great addition to the game,keep up the good work!

F
---
boxers wouldve been funnier
---
Shit. Well i'm pretty accurate with the fmg. So i will be running a fmg silence deagle prolly still wreck
---
His guns are pretty good, and his ability is great. It takes about half health away from any op, requiring no input from the player except initial input. What I'm saying is, you dont have to be good at the game to be good with kapkan
---
Unfortunately, this community is far from decent. Just read the comments.
---
I know a guy that started on console during the time when the black ice skins were on sale and he bought them. Then he moved to PC. 
---
In UE4 yes
---
Boxers it is then lol
---
I agree it's more fun playing 50/50 on my life.
---
lmaooo
---
Skorpion  vz 61 has a forward folding stock like that. Its a real design  lol
---
I dont get it, is this a good thing or bad thing?
---
That's hilariously incorrect. There was ALWAYS a 100 rpm difference, and even today the mp7 does more damage!
---
Yes I agree this would be a great operator that would contribute greatly to the game balance. I think they should also make it so that only I can pick that operator, that would make the game much more balanced
---
I honestly like all of them but secret star, im not saying i hate it but i also don't like it
---
Her hitbox went subatomic
---
Flynn came in as a temporary replacement for mzo, who was having health issues
---
Theirs really no shortage of modern fire arms that military units/police forces use. I agree though on there weapons that are pretty much just that, reskins. I thought new weapons would be released with every new operator, I believe that's what was in the old season pass description aswell
---
KiX best Siege waifu.
---
yeah and thats why they gave out steep and assassins creed unity for free
---
UBISOFT
---
why not play it again?
---
Oh jesus christ that looks uncomfortable
---
I meant the mp5, not mp7
---
Hopefully, this will be my first season I actually get ranked
---
Dont really have a problem with re using old weapons for new Ops, as long as they introduce new weapons also from time to time. My main concern about new Ops,  is not to be OP (like Blackbeard, Ela when they were added to the game) and not to be frustating to play against (like Blitz, Lion).
---
Depending on the line up, map and your personal skill with each operator practically any operator can be S class. Siege is a team based game that’s part of what made it great.
---
what micro transactions? there are so little in the game.
---
Go watch the Lesion Elite Skin Trailer. Looks nothing like this
---
Echo and mozzie get the static effects, which in my opinion almost negates the being invisible part of it. The others I can see it being a good counter for, but still fairly situational
---
Just like we should get something everytime we level up to compensate for our work, not have some shitty random alpha pack that not even at 54% get anything and when you do it's another duplicate.
---
Sorry for my ignorance are seasonal charms and skins only available during the season or remain in game forever after?
---
They're putting a silencer on the deagle? If that's the case that should be very interesting and intriguing
---
From what I’ve seen in videos, it’s noise reduction is good when crouched, but it’s quite loud when standing and running. Not the same as cav’s I’d say.
---
same man ;-;
---
okay, edited
---
But its mostly situational. jager is better most of the time (and he's a 3 speed, with the 416). warden will be good for plant denials
---
ash hella **G A Y**
---
We seriously just passing over the "Equip to All" option?
---
I'm assuming it's the cams that nøkk tricked, similar to how the lights on drones are blue if vigil has his ability turned on
---
Yes
---
Well the argument can be made that killing them really wouldn't because they aren't that valuable if they're flashing and killing their own teammates.
---
 F for John Wick he doesn’t deserve that kind of torture
---
This has happened to me three times, this glitch is not just Twitch, it’s for any general drone. 
---
I think the cause could be if Mozzie and the attacker who originally owned that drone get on drone cams at similar times (obviously both not on that one drone) the glitch activates
---
I may be wrong but it’s how I’ve interpret the glitch, hope it gets fixed soon
---
That is part of the balance ya fucking genius
---
Alright
---
Boo hoo
---
I know I'll stop playing because of this and the amount of keyboards on console playing bomb only
---
i mean like in ranked. someone could be salty and want to take them down with them, costing them the round
---
He's probably just using a backwards recorder. Like OBS's replay capture or just shadowplay.
---
i wish.. those tennobitches get all the good cosmetics
---
Sprinting?
---
r/sixthsub
---
Does for Honor even have a big following and is it fun?
---
can you plz write "im a faggot" anywhere
---
If you collect all of them, you get the option to attach them all at the same time. When the match starts you can choose to kill hal the players on the map, friendlier included.
---
Then move along. Nothing to see here.
---
Breaking the 4th wall
---
Poo eyes
---
It was leaked like a week or so ago. But yeah it’s gonna be available for Nøkk and Smoke now.
---
Just a heads up. You're using the word "Investigating" incorrectly. When there's undeniable evidence of a hitbox issue shown, and you announce that you plan to correct a problem, rather than using the word "investigate" you should be using words like "fixing" "correcting" "adjusting" "repairing" etc.
---
It's normally 2 weeks on the TTS, so 2 weeks from the 21st?
---
looks great!!!
---
Dress up, it’d be cooooooool!
---
Everything's being reused this season, that's my whole complaint. People disagree tho.
---
Should David Attenborough narrorate this
---
I mean I liked the idea of eSports when I was like 13 but now it's just boring as hell and annoying
---
Clearly a joke but ok
---
Didn’t it say that she did in the leaked video?
---
You're putting words in my mouth, which makes it difficult to have a discussion with you. 
---
Either you smurf a lot, or "fuck you" was a very out of line comment from you to me. Rather explosive for something that is a minimal issue to you, no?
---
Like gta lol
---
Im sad, I cry and i feel like nokk is gonna be the clash on attack
---
Uh, no. We know them both already. ...which means you found a secret! Good on you!
---
By that logic all shield operators are broken.
---
You missed finka sasg
---
Didn't they already do this during the Villa season where Nomad's gun is basically a reskin of Hibana's Type 89? Nobody complained then.
---
no because the glitch was only a problem with clash (since she has a shield) and they were already taking out deployable shields so that would leave some ops with no secondary gadget.
---
Daz hot
---
Bartlett
---
To me i think mira should be S tier
---
But are you a blonde-haired blue-eyed STUD like Blitz
---
The only think Fuze needs is a buff to 2 armor 2 speed. He has one of the best guns in the game and a gadget that if used right can be really good.
---
well for starters you don't put your God tier on the bottom row
---
The job description maybe. But the dev is probably the same dude.
---
TLDR: one dev can wear many hats.
---
I think they changed it to 3 weeks after burnt horizon but I'm not sure.
---
Yes but would you rather have a op new gun that literally shreds like ela’s used to it ones you already know are balanced.
---
Shit
---
There are a few issues
---
Why are people fans of liquid, faze, secret, rouge, ssg, fnatic, Nora....... not everyone is going around winning everything
---
[removed]
---
Looks like the doom guy
---
if you wanna do that dont use the holo sight or any sight, the iron sights are decent and it makes that a lot easier
---
Yeah, Xbox One.
---
I got Alibi out of the Christmas packs and have Maine’s her ever since. The Mx4’s RoF is probably what’s getting you right now, I mean 970RPM isn’t always easy. 
---
Just learn the pattern and do the opposite of what the gun naturally does. I recommend using the compensator for her, it will probably help you with focusing on pulling down more than trying to compensate for the horizontal recoil.
---
Once you first get it, it’s super easy to hit long range shots with the Mx4.
---
Worst season by far
---
Wow these are better than the shit ubisoft is pumping out
---
This list. Are you a high rank do you play in a coordinated team if not I can see why some ops are low or high. also if ur on PC no. Way bb is that low
---
Ok I mean the mpx that’s fine it’s a decent gun but not the lesion shotgun that thing is absolutely terrible maybe if it was An American weapon like the m870 aa12 m1014 or the m590
---
It was saying that that was one of the things she could do *without* her cloak glitching
---
I cant make a joking comment about EG because i really feel sad that they lost again ... they were their own enemys again ...
---
They did move the test server phase to 3 weeks
---
Not trying to start so something but shield operators don't have a fully Automatic rifle with them
---
Bakinibohdi released a video and it shows that you can plant with the Hel presence reduction gadget in use.
---
Ed*
---
Top tier is Montagne (even the Pros fear the Monty) followed by Blitz.
---
Lowest tier is Gridlock - have never been fragged by a Gridlock since her introduction till now - she usually dies very quickly.
---
I'm salivating just at the sight of that

There is so many things wrong with this list it's unbelievable, the 3 operators you put in S tier, should be there but you are clearly missing Mira, Lion, Blackbeard, Nomad, Valk and maybe Capitao due to his recent adjustments. I'll explain quickly why, Mira is a heavy intel gathering operator with a strong arsenal, fast smg + shotgun secondary and a nitro cell. Lion is a duh, global abilities are busted and his gun is nutty, blackbeard is blatantly broke due to the fact he can tank 1-2 headshots (literally a primary mechanic of the game), Nomad renders you useless for a few seconds, preventing you from doing literally anything, Valkyrie has access to the best defender gathering intel gadget and nitro cell a fantastic destructive gadget along with the powerful D-50 and an adequate MPX. Capitao is debatable though, he has an extremely powerful LMG along with 2 smokes, 2 asphyxiating bolts and access to 3 flashbangs, with the recent buff to his asphyxiating bolts he is far stronger now and can really cause some damage to the defending team.
---
I'd hope nearly 4 years down the line they can balance guns properly.
---
Yes please !
---
Don't know if she plays it offstream but on stream only rarely. I do remember her streaming Siege games with subs/viewers. She is mostly a variety streamer with Owerwatch being the I-don't-know-what-to-play-today game
---
Yeah Lion is wayyy to low. Is this just for casuals?
---
When I joined there was like only a week left of the event and I was so glad I got to play it while I could. I got fuze’s headgear, Bucks weapon skin, Finkas weapon skin and the weapon skin for tachanka’s and Kapkan’s msg weapon skin.
---
You don’t need an acog. I love how people think it’s this all powerful too. 
---
Fact is when you don’t have the tool in your hand it forces you to be more aggressive and generally works out better.
---
Isn’t arm supposed to be better than wrist anyway?
---
David Hayter and im sold
---
Maybe that means I might return with a continuing story.
---
You tried Alibi
---
the top floor of kafe was near impossible to attack and the first floor was near impossible to defend, literally all they did was rework those 2 floors to make them easier to play and practically left the 2nd floor (which was fine already) alone. if anything this is a amazing rework and im looking forward to kanal next season
---
you took my fuck you as a insult. thats on you buddy
---
What do you mean SCP? That terms keeps appearing in manga and webtoons.
---
So June 11th would be the best bet
---
You’d think that
---
Recipe for awkward/muted reveal: new host + everything leaked
---
Damm
---
Operation Pet . . . Left: Dog / / Right: Cat.    Do u like my concept?
---
What else is "go fuck yourself" supposed to mean, exactly? Pretty sure that's a textbook phrase used as an insult
---
Just browse around on the scp wiki it's basically just a bunch of entity's that are contained and its stories about it
---
ya know like, dont death grip your mouse. only your palm and fingers should be touching it
---
Me too!
---
K
---
Yay, Ubi fixed it... wait nvm they just cucked up.
---
I'm about to get so much shit for making this but here goes I hope you read this
---
That is the lamest excuse I've ever heard like she originally had a carbine? So what it could have been nerfed and not had access to an ACOG, I have a feeling with Year 4: Season 3 we're also gonna get pre existing guns also and ubi should have lowered the price of the operators for non season pass holders especially for Nokk and Warden, Nokk could have gotten a machine pistol as a secondary and I'd have been happy, or the P90 without an ACOG as a 2nd primary instead of her shotgun, After the hype dies down literally nobody will play as her or Warden again unless on different rank levels.
---
Wait, is lesion elite skin leaked? Where can i find this?
---
I'm not talking about the maps I'm talking about the gamemodes
---
Owen Wilson is second place
---
I’m slightly disappointed, but still interested.
---
I’m just waiting till I can them to make a fair judgment.
---
Yeah I know I just want to be able to pick and ban and maps
---
They shouldve made his elite look like a Dad who put on tactical gear on top of his everyday clothes! Oh wait, it would look exactly like his default.
---
Can I say that you have been the only comment that hasn’t dissed me. I’ve had over 20 comments of pure pain.
---
idk I'd honestly reward someone for staying in copper all season, I'd think it's harder to stay in copper ranked than bronze
---
Every makes a big fuss over black ice, but I really want dust line skins back in the alpha packs. I only got them for the MPX and M1014 (auto shotties were OP in dust line, especially pulse since he could hot swap his gadget to his gun) back in the day and I would love to get more of them.
---
I have 20 thachanka spawn peeks
---
Correction: ash is a bullet bender
---
I also don't see how this makes him "immune" to those rushes. It levels the playing field of course, but it's not like those operators are useless without their flashes. The three speed itself is still a relevant disadvantage.
---
I think it did too in the official one
---
Wow, Silver minimum. You really have low standards if I am high enough rank to join.
---
Yes I believe so
---
When does the season actually end?
---
Sorry that you need at least some kind of skill to talk about balancing. It's kinda cringe to be talking about something you don't know anything about.
---
No they can’t, the game engine simply doesn’t have the code to do that. That’s why Tachanka has no ACOG: the code is something a kin to each gun having a line that goes “has ACOG=“ you can either make that true or false, but you can’t put an ACOG on Tachanka’s SMG without also putting it on Kapkan’s. Same deal happens now: the only reason Castle’s guns aren’t buffed is because it would make Pulse overpowered. Sledge can’t have an ACOG on his SMG-11 because it would mean Smoke and Mute also have an ACOG on their SMG-11s.
---
Actualy, if you ain't from gold or more, it's impossible tobget out of copper 4 because of all of the smurfs...
---
I thought that was Nitro Cell/C4 only
---
Okay, heard some different answers about how you needed to buy it at a certain time so I was unsure.
---
Ranked and Pro-league are 2 different games dog
---
Baroque Exalted was nice. Apart from that, ehhhhh.
---
Wifi pribs
---
no seasonal skins have to be bought
---
Lol that poor guy
---
You dick 😂😂😂
---
Just because you have good ping doesn’t mean you aren’t suffering from a server disconnection
---
What? Maybe he just doesn’t care too much about his ranks and would rather have decent players to play with
---
I don't believe I got the Season 1 skins depite getting the Pass
---
details
---
True. But if not then add SI back with a ranked like system to make it more competitive.
---
You don’t get seasonal skins
---
Now you’re thinking with Portals.
---
It feels like they just drew existing weapons from a hat and went with them.
---
Thats literally what ranked is gonna be next season
---
Was thinking of BO IIII. The Villa map which is very similar to Fortress.
---
Very disappointed with how they continue to keep bad maps in the rotation.
---
I'm also disappointed that they didn't implement the 7 second plant/defuse timer.
---
https://youtu.be/6GO8DZPT6Ig 33.40
---
How the hell do people do this shit the other day I tried to draw a house and got so angry that I had to take a nap.
---
Now I'm getting different answers
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
This is true that it wasn't done, but it is possible to do it. https://youtu.be/0EWi2DnDoaI
---
Im fine with the old weapons. Its fun and makes sense for multiple people to use the same weapons.
---
As long as I doesn’t take as long as the attachments to load
---
The seasonal skins? No.
---
Hah, I remember how one time a guy was threatening me with a kick and how he's in a 4 people pre-made with friends.  
---
What he didn't know was that the other 3 players were actually a 4-stack with me.  
---
They quickly clicked "no" and once we made him realise his mistake, we swiftly dealt with him.  
---
People are stupid. Completely stupid it seems.
---
Yes please I had a lot of good dlc skins and black ice skins and I really want them to be transported to my pc
---
Thanks dude
---
So that's 3 saying I will and 2 saying I wont.
---
Link?
---
Not just any any rectangles, chocolate bars!
---
Yea I know, which is why I've been hoping for it in Alpha packs, but would love the option to buy it, because (IMHO) it's the most unique gun skin in the game and Lesion is one of my favourite ops.
---
The floppy fish emote
---
Hit hard shit harder
---
Eh i dont care about that portion I just how fucking big her hitbox is. It’s the only turn off to playing her
---
Same thing with Frost, and probably quite a few other operators. Probably some stuff changed during development after they finished the art, or there was a miscomm *shrugs*
---
If they would’ve got new guns they would have probably been worse than the current load outs they have. It is disappointing
---
Memes get deleted and this shit stays up. Thanks mods
---
Or it’s making tutorial on how to slit your wrist, but saying “don’t kill yourself”
---
I see this as I'm watching infinity war. What are the odds
---
Are you sure? I like the skin, but that's what they did for Burnt Horizon. Moz and gridlocks Season Pass uniforms we're just reskins with the seasonal camo. Whereas Lion and Finka had totally different uniforms, Clash got a baseball cap and Maverick got the headband...
---
"The Operative codenamed Nøkk, assigned to Mobile Task Force █████████ is something of an anomaly to all but her immediate peers, and even to many of the foundation's administration outside of the MTF's internal command structure. However, despite her reputation as a lone wolf, she is nonetheless a highly capable and competent addition to the MTF and can be relied on for intelligence gathering and counter-surveillance operations, as evidenced during her vanguard deployment to secure an anomalous object in terrorist hands in ██████, Russia.
---
Thanks to her technical aptitude and competence in the field, her use of the experimental HEL ██████████████████ apparatus has been shown to greatly assist in covert operations, but due to its classified and experimental nature, knowledge of its development and deployment is not common. Due to this, her ability to mask █████ and dynamically render herself immune to ██████████ observation has sparked an unfounded rumour amongst junior mission support personnel that she is a sapient SCP entity pressed into service with MTF █████████. On occasion, Nøkk has deliberately exaggerated this, either in an attempt to play to up to the rumour, or simply to amuse her unit."
---
I think we'll see some experimentation with old guns that don't see much use because the other option is super strong, and a few new guns with something unique (probably sights) sprinkled in where appropriate.
---
Have they changed it recently? Because otherwise, saying something is worse than another thing infers other thing is better. Haven't played in like 2 months btw.
---
Marvel vs capcom has different colors too but no. The colors are almost the same I think
---
I have everyone except dokk. The perfect line up
---
What 3D printer do you have?
---
bcoz 7.62mm is 0.3 inch
---
How long have you been playing?
---
&gt; Footsteps are quiet like cavs silent step
---
So she's not completely quiet like csgo's silent step, right?
---
The post title says it's the Seasonal Skins, and they look like seasonal skins, so I'm going of the guess that they are.
---
&gt; while Vigil has one of the best.
---
High debatable.
---
It’s not just the guns,  Nökk is vigil and cav combined, and Warden has glaz’s ability to see through smoke. The only difference is that warden is immune to flash’s while he has his glasses on, Nökk can be seen on the cams, and Warden has a cool down.
---
Ok, so you got 2 new ops a new attachment for the deagle, and a map rework. OP health way back in year 2 added nothing. This argument is asinine as additionally all this content is free. If you are talking about the season pass then you get 8 ops, 3 map reworks, 1 new map, a skin and the knowledge that you dont have to grind for the ops. That's all the pass has been for 4 years.
---
Maverik isn't three speed cunt
---
It has to be Jäger, IQ, Blitz then Bandit, the right of IQ is Blitz because he has his visor mid/fully down whereas the left of IQ has to be Jäger since it is almost identical to his helmet.
---
Wow I’m my opinion that is disgustingly ugly
---
They're changing it with the new season.
---
From the sound she made during the reveal, I assume no.
---
*Eagle noises*
---
Unless they updated the bombers after White Noise, they can't prone. I know because I took advantage of them not being able to do so in order to get the "Master" trophy (Complete any TH mission on realistic).
---
You can shoot .308 from a gun chambered in 7.62x51. They are the same round. 7.62 is just the NATO version.
---
How do you know it'll be worse
---
You sure about that bud? I will buy you 100 platinum if he isn’t.
---
Why do we need an honor system? Even if they go straight in to ranked they will still reinforce, place utility, make callouts etc. They wouldn't be as detrimental as a compete noobie.
---
Nøkk? Did you mean Cavigil?
---

Not so sure they should be literally fucked for this.

I’m bettin that this is one of those things where ubi tries to tie ops together. I’m putting my money on, since Warden is secret service and knowing who Nokk’s father is would be extremely scandalous, Nokk’s father is president Baldwin of the United States.
---
Eye cancer. No. I. Can’t. Unsee. This. Please. No. Dear. God. Make. It. Stop.

Ay right there with ya man. So many awesome weapon skins and elites. So many cool headgears. I hit plat three seasons in a row. 1000+ hrs
---
Converted to pc, no skins, barely hold up in gold(new to pc gaming, not great with m/k yet). It's a whole different experience. People treat me like trash and I have none of the cool stuff.
---
*Kill la kill flashbacks intensify*
---
I’m fairly certain she is a half sister to Ela and Zofia. This 
---
Facts we know:
---
Ela and Zofia’s father was former GROM and became Minister of Internal Affairs after the assignation of the Polish president. 
---
The father died “under suspicious circumstances” and ruled a suicide in 2017 (we know this because he dies right around the same time as the birth of Zofia’s daughter who is two years old. 
---
Zofia is really emotional about her father’s pocket watch. 
---
The father was socializing with two former suspects of the Polish President’s assassination at Zofia’s wedding, much to Zofia’s dismay
---
Zofia left GROM for team Rainbow because “everything about GROM reminded her of her father”
---
Ela still wants to live up to her father’s standards
---
Zofia is highly protective of Ela
---
Nøkk has high respect for her father’s name and it’s unexpected
---
Knowledge of Nøkk’s father to the general public would cause a high scandal
---
Nøkk puts her country above all
---
The game bio refers to Ela not as the younger daughter of Jan Bosak, but as the youngest
---
What I believe happened:
---
Between the birth of Zofia and Ela, their father, Jan, went on a mission within Denmark. On this mission, he got a woman pregnant and would father Nøkk. Later, Poland’s President was assassinated and Jan stepped down from GROM and became Minister of Internal Affairs. During this time, Jan became intertwined with some very shady business and got involved with criminals and corruption. This involvement became a bit too much and so the Danish government decides to send in a ghost operative to assassinate Jan, and make it look like a suicide. Zofia gets her hands on her father’s pocket watch and finds a picture of Nøkk’s mother (that part may be a bit stretching it, but the next parts not so much). Zofia then spends her maternity leave in the months following Jan’s death (before Ela is accepted into GROM) finding out the truth both who her father was, and who killed him. However, while she does learn who her father was, that he didn’t commit suicide, and that he fathered Nøkk, she does not learn that Nøkk actually killed him, instead finding herself wanting more than GROM could offer. Then Ela is admitted to team Rainbow and Zofia follows her.
---
This explains why a scandal would emerge if Nøkk’s father was revealed (a Polish operative and politician impregnating a Danish woman is not something that would just blow over), why Nøkk should have resentment for her father, but also holds respect for him (now that she’s exacted her revenge, she only looks back on him with respect to what he has accomplished). Her Darwinist outlook is rooted in her father (the same outlook he instilled in Zofia). And it explains why Nøkk is so protective of her mother (Nøkk May or may not be the product of less than consensual reproduction). Finally, it explains the comment made about Nøkk’s resemblance: he’s not talking about the resemblance Nøkk has to her father, he’s talking about the resemblance she has to Ela and Zofia. Without knowing they have the same father, the director would have never been able to connect the resemblance between the GROM ops and Nøkk. 
---
So that’s my theory.
---
I know right. I personally like the new ops (Warden more so than Nøøk) and know that Ubisoft will do something creative the next patch.
---
Yes! It's on his head. Thank you.
---
Holy moly is that reddit clickbait?
---
The new girl is a little odd. Her overall performance wasn't great and it kinda seemed like she was flirting for a good portion of it. Her jokes were horrible too. In time she'll get better so that's all we have to wait for. I'm sure we'll come to love her as much as we loved Justin.
---
Why you guys didn't remind AA-12? Is it OP? It is unbelievаble trash can. In 9/10 ways people use NOT shotguns (Not Vigil and not uncle Mustafa).   
---
P.S. Any weapon is OP when you know where your enemy goes.
---
“Your opinion is part of the problem”

I criticize ubisoft almost on a daily basis, but this makes sense if you get your head out of your ass for 2 seconds. I swear you people are so entitled, grow the fuck up. If you dont like it then dont play it.
---
Don't forget that nokk is also silent so I guess it's a vigil cav mix
---
The both new operators are recycled ones too... One Caveira-Vigil and one Ying-Glaz...
---
you mean the Japanese 6News channel? he usually does, And I bet Kormora will start leaking the Year 4: Season 3 operators from resetera. 
---
I'm going with the next elite to be for
---
- Smoke
---
- Castle
---
- Montagne
---
- Caveira
---
- Buck 
---
- Capitao
---
I'm likely wrong but still.
---
Dude what a ridiculous claim to make about me lying about this holy fuck , I just wanted some god damn insight but I guess my eyes have played a damn funny trick on me by showing me things on video game that weren’t really there even tho I have been playing this game of both pc/ps4 for years.
---
Actually you can't mod games on Xbox one yet, you can use a USB, but since the servers store save game data, if it detects you are messing with the files it either gets corrupted or you can get console banned since it violates their TOS. If you actually looked into stuff like this you would know it isn't possible yet, only reason I know is I am following modding on XB1 closely since I am interested in it.
---
Nice find!
---
Personally some of my favourites are for attack: Lion, Hibana, Ying and for defense: Lesion, Mozzie, Vigil
---
Its a survey of a few thousend Players (mostly PC) as a ps4 Player i can tell you that the Majority of the biggest playerbase of all 3 plattforms plays secure just Check Match search Time and Check the Search for Teammates in Communities + there are stats of op. Chimera that show that the Majority of Players Play s. area
---
Can year pass owners get the new ops already?
---
I’ll put it this way: what determines who wins in a pro-league tournament? It’s not what team gets the most kills, it’s what team wins the matches. You could get plenty of kills, but if you are unable to successfully defend/attack why should you be rewarded over the opponent? It’s bomb, or secure area, or hostage, not team death match, you feel me?
---
"A mouse plugs in with a USB" That doesn't make it a USB stick, you do know that right? USB Sticks are external hard drives essentially, Mice are nothing like USB sticks which is why you can't run hacks on them. Maybe you didn't know that, but you certainly talk like you do which is mis-leading.
---
White Noise: ‘Everyone is OP man!’
---
Chimera: Everyone was actually OP
---
Para Bellum: ‘Maestro needs a nerf!’
---
Grim Sky: ‘Clash is OP!’(Maverick was actually)
---
Wind Bastion: ‘Nomad is broken, she needs a huge nerf!’(Shes completely fine)
---
Burnt Horizon: ‘They’re too good’
---
This dude stole the meme from an Italian Instagram page that stole it from American ones
---
Well, I totally forgot about the seasonal skins in wind Bastion since I didn't play at all. Gotta get them when I log in.

Possibly an upcoming summer-theme event? (For the mid-season event)
---
Ubi is trying to reach 100+ ops so they want to get there reasonably quickly, so it's not really a community request but rather a dev wish.
---
No proof as of yet of people hacking on console, I see posts everyday of people complaining about hacking, but never providing evidence of people actually hacking. So no, they can't be hacked, not yet anyway.
---
[Here](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-302840/jager-covert-set)
---
I see what your saying.
---
Why? He’s fine
---
Like I’m not sure what sort of game manipulation was used and I just defaulted to saying aim bot on my post for the sake of laziness but my god man My whole daily rainbow squad has seen it with our own eyes for gods sake , what a ridiculous thing to claim I would be lying about it , and my post on this sub with one upvote isn’t turning anyone away from this near 5 year old game my man , take it easy
---
tbh I don't see anyone using the MPX for Warden. I see people using the shotgun + SMG-12 with him.
---
Ok that looks cool
---
I said SEARCH IT UP
---
Being invisible to cameras for a brief moment gives you some advatage, but for me the odd ball is that usually Ubi is all about teamplay but this OP seems to be more suited for a single player plays, rather than team plays. (Speaking about EU as many usually don't communicate in Voice chat)
---
E.g, IQ can shoot out cameras and other gadgets that benifits all team... Being invisible is only advantagious to the player, not the team.
---
Maybe there is something else that I don't know about the new OP but as it is now, atackers just got themselves vigil+cav within a single OP.
---
I rather would like to see an OP with some EMP abilities. We have two hard breachers plus Mav. Kinda wanted a new thatcher OP with maybe 3 speed and ash like emp gadget.
---
But destroying cameras lets people know someone has been there. Walking past a camera someone is on while being Cav levels of quiet will be very strong. People always over hype new things, look at Gridlock, people were screaming nerfs and she’s average at best.
---
New baywatch season leak?
---
I'm hyped for the season, it seems this year we've been getting balanced Ops compared to year 3 where all the attackers introduced were OP.
---
Cause no claymore atm
---
Well anyways, I did some snooping on the internet. They all say it’s possible(Albeit difficult)
---
I too have been playing since Launch on Xb1 And Pc and I know hacking isn't possible since I researched it extensively trying to find out if it was possible. All of you say you have seen hacking on Xbox One, but can you give proof? You can easily clip things on console, yet you never have clips of people blatantly aimbotting like you claim? Yeah my claims are ridiculous, go preach your bullshit to another subreddit instead of lying and making people think twice about buying this game.
---
I mean generally. People don't like this map.
---
Yeah but denmark is a monarchy
---
I'm uninstalling rainbow
---
Your mentality is that it should just not be viable to go on balcony?
---
Hey fucking dumbass, here is just from a quick google search. [https://youtu.be/kyM9HQO0Chg?t=74](https://youtu.be/kyM9HQO0Chg?t=74) Even here someone who reports on this stuff says it isn't possible, no one has any proof so far of hacking and people have been claiming they have seen hackers for years, maybe don't complain about someone killing you when you clearly got outplayed.
---
I said you were probaly a good person and left you alone and yet you come back, idk who hurt you but just let it go man let them go live your life be the man you always wanted to be
---
They'll be uninstalling rainbow like me.
---
She does?

Basically it's to balance them out look at the comment
---
Are you high?
---
Depends how you attack and defend. Do you like to anchor or roam? Get frags or be a team player? High armour or high speed?

I have all the operators and have been playing for a while so if ya respond I can give you a little insight :)
---
Wow feels like I got sucked for buying this years pass -\_- thanks though
---
But like. It's not confusing at all... And if it is, then you low-key retarded.

No they don't "all say it's difficult" if you look it up almost all the results say it isn't possible as of now except one hacking website who is scamming.

Yesno

 Personally I think castle and iq should be swapped. Castle is extremely situational unless you're in a 5 stack with strats
---
Yes babe
---
I think it's pointless to keep creating new weapons which are only marginally different than others. What is the reason not to reuse them? New content for new content's sake isn't really beneficial. Reusing and combining ops is smart and fresh enough. We've all be asking for some Jager substitute/compliment and they experimented with that and ended up with Warden. Less team oriented maybe but a very interesting take. And combining defender abilities and using them on attack makes it totally different as well.
---
You’re very talented, I’d love to read their profiles

Get some friends to play siege with, ez?

For real I don’t understand super flashy skins, it’s so much easier to see you.

an acog alone won't make a gun better IF it "sucked" before.
---
Are u sure it will be tagged 707 in the release version?
---
U don't need to outgun anyone and everyone for example finka is a supporting operator with a weak ar but still useful. I think they made the right decision on Warden because his gadget is potentially very powerful
---
That would actually be pretty dope
---
can get well over 200 iirc. Ela killing zofia with a headshot whilst flashbanged and on tachankas turret through a wall. Zofia has to be rappelling, and disoriented by an ela mine. 
---
this is obviously not going to happen, but pretty sure this would give you the highest. Maybe frost mat, barbed wire would be better than rappelling idk.
---
that looks sick dude
---
Yeah but is that the problem of the op or the player? For me they are good ops with a high skill level but ur different classes make it look like they are overall bad
---
never seen anyone call bartlett a good map. It has one fucking door hahah
---
Why is there insistence that they can only do one or the other.  If they made the argument that they could only rework Ops by skipping making new ones for a season, people would lose their shit.  This game has, [by Ubisoft's measurements](https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/05/15/rainbow-six-siege-rakes-in-a-billion-dollars-the-division-2-fails-to-meet-sales), made a billion dollars so why is it asking too much for them to make new maps and re-balance old ones at the same time?  Why is it too much to ask that they introduce firearms used by the actual CTU as opposed to just reusing old ones and rework old operators?  And now we have the bonus in that if Nokk under performs and either of her primary weapons get buffed that also buffs the defenders.  Shit it took 5 days for them to block out game breaking bugs and they still haven't fixed them.  This made a billion dollars and they pulled the team off of it to go help develop the 2nd Ghost Recon game since the last R6 or Splinter Cell game came out.  They can't even bother with two map reworks a season and people will still call them generous, for trying to entice people to keep playing and keep giving them money, for doing their business model.
---
I was gonna talk about brand loyalty but what does it matter, downvote me into oblivion, it is too much to ask that they treat their customers like they are the ones that paid them all that fucking money.
---
But echo isn’t as thicc as doc
---
looks like octane from apex legends
---
"After all these years... I have them all"
---
That’s very wrong. 
---
The Mx4 is a high fire rate, low recoil and low damage weapon while the Kaids AUG is low fire rate and low damage weapon and Mozzie has only 1 SMG you could probably compare to the Mx4
---
I am a fan.
---
nah but the dot was much larger iirc
---
He can tank up to 3 shots, and this is assuming we, for the moment, don't consider his Shattering animation infinite bullet absorption glitch. 3 shots on an average take 200 ms. So his head tanks 200 ms. On his head, extra shot after the shield shatters, so make that 250 ms. On his body, considering 0.9 multipler, another 164-220 ms depending on gun. So on an average, he dies in 200 ms.
---
His gun will kill you in 205 ms. 1 ms for head.
---
So, regardless of where you aim, you are dead.
---
BB mains are crutch players, but all have understood that you need to aim for the head to win. So, a BB main will kill you, even if you have practiced for thousands of hours to aim for the smallest hitbox of the body.
---
BB punishes skill. That's why pros hate him. he is fundamentally broken.
---
Their own greed was pumping out endless content which meant that they couldn't sustain a healthy build. New content is flashy, drives sales and keeps the more casual player invested. Lack of a stable build kills this game more than anything. 
---
2 new ops, a seemingly amazing rework of a map, new ranked ruleset. Seems like a proper way to start a new season. I support their idea of 1 new map and 3 reworks every idea. Having so many mediocre maps in the build that could do with some sprucing up is a waste.
---
But he has a sexy voice
---
/r/wallpaperengine it pls (if possible and it's not too much, dual screen)
---
She should say "Going ghost" when activating her ability.
---
U knew the game is ment to be bomb and your crying because the game gets better but u missed out something. That's a bit childish even though I understand ur point in the end iam happy about a more streamlined game that will improve through the changes
---
?
---
I'm sure Ubisoft had something in store for the reoccurring bug, besides that I wonder which season they'll be added, seems like fun.
---
Like playing Kapkan or lesion and winding up with 3 or 4 kills, 5 deaths but 10 kill assists and taking first 😂
---
But then the elo decrease wouldn’t be that bad because of the ratio shit
---
I mean, the first is a granted, because we haven't seen it released fully into the wild. But it's not hard to be pessimistic given the loadouts.
---
Re: 2. DMG/RPM
---
Kaid's AUG A3 - 33/700
---
Valkryie/Warden's MPX - 26/830
---
**For reference:** 
---
Mozzie's Commando 9 - 36/750 &amp; P10 RONI - 26/950
---
Rook/Doc's MP5 - 27/800 
---
Echo's MP5SD - 30/800 
---
Maestro's ALDA - 35/900
---
Kaid's lack of ACOG on what is likely his better weapon is probably a design choice regarding using him as a roaming fatty, similar to how Bandit lacks one now because it is too much advantage after gadget use. They probably want to confine him to site. The MP5 is arguably better, while the MP5SD and ALDA are pretty much definitely better.
---
I DO see how Warden would be powerful with an ACOG given that minimal movement holding an angle through smoke would obviously be strong, but compounded with his bad kit and overall unimpressive first glace at his gadget, it looks like another tick against his strengths. Seeing through smoke is strong, but at the same time, smoke isn't a total safety net - even with the Glaz change I'm skeptical it would make an impact against him so harshly. Never mind the fact that a lot of high use operators have nitros and Maestro's cam is a thermal (for smoke planting rebuttal.)
---
Re: 3. Nokk Nokk
---
The invisibility is decent, even with Echo (if I recall) being able to sense her presence. But she takes aspects from Caveira and Vigil and absorbs the opposites of their strengths. Vigil can run while invisible, Caveira still makes noise but can run during Silent Step. She cannot. Vigil broadcasts his existence toward drones and cameras, including an intensity meter, but Nokk makes her exact location known if she is inconvenienced by many of the things that would likely give her pause in a live round. Her guns are worse than Vigil's for outright killing, and she can't capitalize on the kill once she starts firing unlike Cav's interrogation ability (though that is obviously not the strongest thing ever put out due to having to do the actual interrogation.) Her weapons are without debate not good, she might not be dumpster tier, but I doubt her intended strengths will really shine through. She's not actually invisible. Someone just has to see her, which is more likely than you think.
---
What page?
---
because she isn't like the other girls
---
yeah
---
the edge is real
---
Yeah I wish there was more low tech gadgets like EMP grenades and portable trophy systems
---
That’s what they’re doing minus the 6th pick
---
new operator spooky, very cool, much ghostly
---
Well, it's definitely ready.
---
Haven't a clue, was having some connection issues before it happened - maybe something to do with that?
---
Too add to the mystery aspect of her character
---
Jeeze, what assholes.
---
I really liked the police from grim sky one and the new wooden one from burnt horizon.
---
It got the middle wall
---
On the default skin there's still a 707 yeah.
---
Yeah but it's a core anchor operator for a defense, for him to see trough a smoke, he already has to stop moving for some time and I can see that + the slow time to kill of the MPX being very frustrating for me and a lot of people. They don't need to give him a high damage assault rifle, I'd just want something a bit better than this one. Or something more pleasant to play, but that would come down to personnal preference, you couldn't make everyone happy. He will just end up being the default guy behind a Mira, I don't like it.
---
idk about 6th pick, doesn't give US much advantage in ranked, considering you will not always play 5 stack vs 5 stack with full-strats. If it was 5 stack vs 5 stack, sure why not. But in the current way of matchmaking it's just a waste of time tbh.
---
Regarding map-pool, fuck yea. Maybe even add the new seasonal map IF IT DOES NOT SUCK BALLS, like hereford, fortress, ...
---
You can Bandit trick sure but if it's not garage it's not worth doing so. You are better off going to roam. And if you don't have a direct counter to the ads and you can't shoot it (which Jagers should place ads in good places) then you can't use projectiles, while if you don't know about the ads you may waste them accidently. I'm not saying Bandit sucks but in some objectives he can be replaces by Mute or just not picked to give different utility. It's the only reason he is not S tier. If he had his 3rd barbed wire, 100% S tier.
---
True
---
Strange I didn’t get a pop up or anything. In the match I could just pick them. And customise them in the main menu too. As if I bought them
---
Just shoot Maverick. Just shoot Lion. Just shoot Dokkaebi. Just shoot Lesion. Just shoot Bandit. Just shoot X, then the Y that they do will magically disappear.
---
The holes he leaves in the wall making another angle you need to watch are still there. The fact that he is immune to Mute, Bandit, and Kaid when he wants to take a look at reinforced walls are still there. You can't keep out a Maverick through any means. He can easily make a site unsafe while taking care of wall problems.
---
Is your solution to Blackbeard "Shoot him" too? Is that why Blackbeard is balanced and has the counter of shooting him?
---
Zofia and Ela are sisters. I believe
---
Ela and Zofia when kill one another you get extra points for sibling rivalry
---
If you want to pronounce the name badly, sure.
---
ø is not o

Why is that a link to a soundtrack to a game I've never heard of? Am I not understanding a tier 11 meme?

i really hope so! and im pretty sure ur right

I'm glad to see that elites are just a popularity contest.

repost

r/woooosh
---
Maybe use less lines, make it minimalistic?
---
I played rank up until not so long ago. I can still watch youtube you know? If you don't like the tier list don't comment if you can't be nice. No one likes people like you. If someone is wrong about something will you charge at him with your bad attitude? Retarded is not a curse. By far you are making yourself look like the unintelligent here.

1. Stop being a terrible person

Inspired by Ghost Recon Future Soldier it seems. Epic.

That’s an idea, I can try that.

YES PLEASE IT IS DOPE!

Skyscraper isn’t that bad
---
He's more youthful looking. I love it. It also looks like the suit is influenced by mgs a bit (i could be way off).
---
was my favourite map for the longest time, but it’s definitely time for it to go as much as it hurts to say. 
---
I hope it’s the next for a map buff though, I don’t think it needs ridiculous amount of changes, maybe a clubhouse level buff or slightly more.
---
use the fucking search bar it’s not new
---
To each his own – I think it’s the worst map in the game.
---
I barely play him, just thought the design was cool
---
splinter cell?
---
&gt;i disagree with you
---
WOW YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PERSON YOU KNOW YOU HURT MY FEELINGS RIGHT
---
The problem here is that we did have seasons where we only got map reworks but still got new weapons and ops. Look at Grim Sky for example. A complete hereford rework and two new ops. Don't get me wrong, Cafè needed the rework and I'll take that over a new map, but I still think modeling at least 1-1 new weapon for each op would've been nice, and then give some old weapons too.

Karma fishing.
---
Red is a very aggressive color so they always get destroyed by attackers. Blue is more pacify.They changed color to save money for buying new cameras.
---
It's hard to not know about an ADS due to its size and glowing properties. They're also as predictable as batteries as to location. If you're unsure, you can really just check with a flashbang which most people's favorite top tier operators come pre-kitted toward. 
---
You can go up and down about twitching it or thatchering it, which is the same argument for why Bandit has to trick in order to reach maximum gadget efficiency. There are going to be people who are going to try to get rid of the gadget, but Bandit in a situation where his gadget isn't being hunted down per se (e.g. the same situation where a predictable ADS isn't vulnerable to Twitch or Thatcher) he's leaving a gigantic impact on the site.
---
Being replaced by Mute (who, by the way, I'd never ask to do Bandit's job in terms of wall guarding as opposed to window or door locking) is essentially being picked for different utilities on the site. The same thing you can do to Jager, and the same reason I locked him out of S tier. The thing is, when you pick Bandit, you are getting the complete package. When you pick Jager, you aren't getting "everything" because he is not "everything." He is a roamer who can shut down grenades - a legitimately big deal, but Bandit can do everything he needs in the situations you pick him. Jager is a lot more "formless" to being picked, his site defense is *general* and not *specialized.* You can bring him to any site, but who is to say that you have to or should in every situation? His performance always differs, but when you pick Bandit you know why and where, obviously his performance can differ depending on the conflicts during the round, but he's never bringing less. Those outside walls are getting shut down for the meantime.
---
Ah yes. Very good. Your wit astounds me.
---
Ø is NOT prounouced like knock knock. Its proununced like a Danish Ø.

Same lol

That doesn't mean new guns either way lol

True, but never hurts to make suggestions and see what works and what doesn’t
---
Im right with you pall but when i was at a convention me and my friend talked to a r6s developer and He said it's to complicated 🙄
---
amazing cosplay . are you gonna make a really big fucking hole ?
---
Same on pc. I dont think ill ever find a game of it 
---
:(
---
It's been asked for over a long time, should be in, but in the hit breach podcast where epi was on as a guest, he was asked this, I can't remember his answer, but definitely look it up
---
Looks good, good luck with the pod
---
Even thought they arent like the gameplay works. I really love those to set a mindset to the new operator. With all the kindergarten going on in casual/ranked this is a mindset boost before some 12 yr old yells "F U i will F up your game" -proceeds to tk because madkid. 
---
I am with you but ubi spared new weapons on the next gen operators i heard. 
---
Less effort but same money, Ubi knows how to be economic.
---
I think that his friend saw you with a drone and called it out and also said when you stood up. Luck is annoying but it’s there
---
the attacker's side of breach is not lethal , but the other side of breach charge is the lethal one
---
The thing is,  he had also wall banged two others that round and even his team mates watching him on kill cam were suspicious.   They tk'd him the next round 😬
---
CTF is actually a competitively played game mode in CoD but okay.
---
I made this because I don't like the \*Rainbow is magic\* and \*Sunsplash\* events.
---
r/twentycharacterlimit
---
so does ubisoft hate acogs?
---
Oh sorry sorry lazy typing. I mean they have been impactful for me so far, especially mozzie. Gridlock only for niche post plant scenarios, but is still effective.
---
I don't see how vigil cav combo with shittier weapons is creative enough. Wish nokk literally froze or looped cam feeds or even gave false cam feeds. Would've been better, but sounds hard to implement.
---
Warden. Feels like a shittier glaz with a weak gun. Wish he could still see thru smoke and flash while moving. Prolly not whole sprinting. He will lose to glaz in the theoretical through smoke encounters he will be going through.
---
Imo very weak conceptualization. Weaker load out choices.
---
Ok thanks for the extra info. I just try to think of every other way he could have known so that people stop saying hacks every time something suspicious happens but this does sound like hacks
---
But what is the point of a new gun then? I honestly do not understand this desire for new gun if it's just going to be the same as older weapons. There so many weapons in the game already, I'm absolutely fine with reusing older weapons. 
---
Why does she NEED an AR if it's stats are similar to the FMG9? Why does it matter whether it is an smg or ar?
---
Also, writing "lazyyyyyyyyyyy" doesn't really make you sound all that smart, it makes people dismiss your point instantly. Rather have Ubi focus less time on gun design and possibly more on map design, if there is overlap between teams there.

Which makes getting this particular achievement much harder. Putting one down on the floor for someone to walk over doesn't work if they aren't already damaged

No. People still meleeing throught shields. Fuck them.

ok im cool with that soo wheres my gridlock buff😭
---
Tried uploading to reddit but it wouldnt take my file even tho it was the right one
---
Reminds me of the breach animation from the game's reveal trailer.
---
And you didn't own them before? Cav and Hibana are year one operators that come with certain editions of the game, I think all editions on console actually.

Doc on attack means the hardest push ever

Dont forget the bandages!! Keep it up!

Well lesion just proved your wrong by wearing solid detox armour.
---
With the IQ elite yoga pants, definitely not just you.
---
I definitely will! (:
---
He's being dumb AND sarcastic.
---
It doesn't matter that much, I'm just saying it's boring having one each for every single operation. Also, as I have said, CTUs are different from Operations. Ela came with Ying and Lesion in Blood Orchid, and Zofia came with Dokkaebi and Vigil in White Noise. Every operation before and after has been one each.
---
Really isn’t I use it as a primary for Dok
---
That’ll be hard considering I’m about sledge height
---
Reverse friendly fire can be activated just by damaging your crew not just killing them. When you get too much - red points u automaticly get reverse friendly fire, but in that situation u can get + red points to disable it.
---
I wondered why she glitched in so many circumstances. Being able to shoot while it's on explains it.
---
Looks good, I bet it will feel better than the old lines where you had to scroll all the way down to see what you might like. If that would even work (loading was a mess, sorting was a mess)
---
And this is also a way for Ubisoft to push the sales of certain cosmetics; they put them in the big boxes up top
---
Someone else already said it but as a secret service op Warden should at least have had the FMG, it fits better.  Also if they were going to emulate movie characters why not from Olympus has Fallen or White House Down (whatever it was called the one where Magic Mike saves Training Day), movies with Secret Service protagonists (or in Magic Mike's case aspiring)?  I like James Bond and everything but you could have saved that for an MI6 Op.
---
417 is the worst dmr
---
When you say game cap size on console do you mean a number that ubisoft decided?
---
Fairly good change, allows them to focus on one game mode even more, makes map design a tad easier as you don't have half ass try and create competitive spots for the other game modes. also going to be amazing for queue times. There still is casual.
---
I get that it's unfortunate for those who play secure only but I honestly think it's for the best to focus us all on game mode. And trust me, bomb offers a lot of fun as well!
---
Issa knife
---
I was so hype when I first heard this at the invitational!!
---
"*yup, case closed, diamonds are definitely blue*"
---
Sony dislikes this, they are a part of the problem.
---
Warden's Elite skin will be Ryuuko's skimpy battle suit.
---
I'm gonna feel real bad If they change the design
---
New controller is 60 bucks already right? I would think it's worth it
---
He did the math
---
I would love to have this permanently in the game.
---
Bring the hacker accusations!
---
Do reload, weapon swap, crouch, and ping
---
Wrong clip?
---
Like "ea" in "Search" or "u" in "Burn".
---
You do realise they're trying to keep the size down right? Why do you think we keep getting less and less maps each year?
---
There isnt anything like ø in english..if it helps you eould pronounce it the same way you say ö in german.
---
Nah man that will take away teamwork and make people throw round to “save the k/d”
---
They get invited out by Ubisoft to play on an early access version of the game.
---
They could just borrow hibanas voice line and change it a bit so it sounds more like nuuk nuuk (like everyone in the comments insists it’s pronounced)
---
Of course warden is a good counter to her. But that doesn't mean ying was invincible all along.
---
I can assure you, I would welcome that shit if it means I get this. Just get a bigger/extended hard drive. No issue, dude.
---
I like the idea of ops being more situational. It leads to more diverse team comps.
---
Muzzle break?
---
Hell yeah!
---
I wait two mins before i start que again
---
He says “he wouldn’t have known the family resemblance, but it smacks you in the face when you find out why the father is” that makes me think that it has to be someone on team rainbow, my money is on someone in one of the Russian units, doc, or lion (who had a kid when he was young). When I get home, I’m going to dive into everybody’s bio.
---
BTW: 
---
But why were they dedicating a full Polish season with 2 female operators before it got cancelled for operation health back in 2017? They can be a season with 2 male operators at any point, it could be next season or with Year 4: Season 4 or maybe even the beginning of Year 5.
---
Although like in the past with 2 operators of the same gender 2 males they might have to be related as cousins or brothers similar to Zofia and Ela as sister.
---
Well enjoy whatever you want buddy :)
---
No clue why people keep missing this point.
---
Idk. In the vibes just don't feel right
---
Likewise, bruv. It's a free world!
---
No I managed to get the build back by downloading the depot through a steam console command and running steam and uplay offline to avoid updates, it's the same version
---
depends on fire rate; high rpm=holo and lower rpm than 1000=reflex

i’ve been looking for one, thank you

Good Luck!

Lesion so good that Ubi had no choice but to give him some super soldier suit
---
Cav, STFU, u sneaky b*tch, if u had that, they couldn't even see you!
---
RIP r4-c acog
---
No. Because those are different operators. Also the 552 commando is fucking terrible. The fire rate is way to slow.
---
Oh yeah I noticed that I chipped some health. Nevertheless, good explanation. 
---
Thanks
---
I would love to do all of them but the way some operators icons are made, I am limited to what I can do otherwise they would look like garbage...
---
He gonna get you
---
so u would like to keep the fmg6 over a 552? Can i ask your rank?
---
They didnt do it in for honor, they wont do it here...
---
I misspoke a little by saying they would keep the male/female combination.  The main point I was trying to drive at is I don't think they will do a male/male operation.  I think all operations at this point will be either male/female or female/female.  There are likely to be more people offended by a male/male operation due to the movements to have females included in everything than there would be having a combination including at least one female.  Yes, Ubisoft can pull out any combination of genders at any point, I just don't think they will because the backlash is probably not worth whatever is gained by having two male operators in a single operation.

Its pronounced NUH-K. NUH-K NUH-K is definitely not as funny.

This is a fucking joke. It took them 3/4 DAYS, that's fucking lethargic. Any comparable game, in fact most BIGGER games will have this shit fixed or disabled in hours, or, yknow, *not have it happen in the first place*. Siege is a development joke compared to any other game

Just wanted to say that I don't want my comment to discourage you, it was just my first impression. Hope to see you stick around and improve!

ESL-Mappool + new seasonal map is it is actually viable, ez

No worries it's not related to my question.

Reading the comments on the bug posts or the server issues was hilarious. People take this game way too seriously

Hey she might steal it from Hibana. Never know
---
what game modes are you playing?

Wher is ur hed

wow ok i guess you like rpm over dpm
---
Yeah. The faster it shoots the faster it kills.
---
just mental thing on your and your enemy's side

Best Elite so far. At least for me. I hate WW1 and WW2 themes, I hate retro themes. Bandit Elite was First one I liked, and now Lesion is one I like the most.

Why?

No sights but charms and skins would be great

How are you getting downvoted. You are saying the truth
---
Can I get that for my doorbell?
---
So teamkilling makes a right? Wow your so cool for teamkilling
---
I dont know why are you so agresively defensive? Its just a clip of a video game and youre calling people bd words for disagreeing with you
---
He had a crazy one for Rainbow is Magic :p
---
Bomb is going to be the only mode in Ranked. Both Hostage and Secure Area is being taken out. 
---
It’s understandable, if it’s more like Pro League, it may get more people to try out Pro League or at least feel like they are.
---
In my opinion though? It’s going to force more people away from Ranked because not everybody WANTS to play Bomb 24/7. It’s guaranteed that Casual will see a rise in player count because of it.
---
pretty sure its gonna be day one of Phantom Sight
---
I'mma save this Post, this is golden XD.
---
Yes to thatcher's vs warden not to mute vs nokk.. nukk... nakk w/e
---
1. giving warden an acog will contradict his gadget, youre not gonna get flshed and smoked on far engagements, he was meant to hold a sight cause he has the right tool to counter any incoming attackers who are using flashbangs and smokes, giving hin an acog would make his gadget pointless.
---
 
---
2. i kinda like noc's weapon to be the r4c like ashe's but putting an acog to her flanking playstyle is also bad.
---
conclusion
---
i believe warden's in an ok spot but i wish he couldve been a 2 armor instead of a 3, and i would prefer the r4c as noc's primary. but they do not deserve/necessarily to have acogs.
---
I think they should lock the rank you can play ranked with.
---
A diamond should never play with people lower than plat, for example. I would allow a 2 ranks interval at max, like that:
---
* diam and plat
---
* plat and gold
---
* gold and silver
---

If you have a diamond and a gold in the same squad, you can't go in ranked. It's basic stuff to have a decent competitive game... But we are still waiting.
---
If it was my call, I would also create three queues (solo, duo/trio and 5 stack) to focus people on the same environnement and chance. 
---
Right now it's a fucking mess.
---
Neck minute. Customer killed by a cup of coffee holding a gun
---
And "Knock, knock" is already taken anyway.
---
Wait what? Suppressors dont magicaly increase Muzzle Velocity. The Bullet actually reaches Max Velocity after 1/3 of the Barrel or so after that it stays there until it leaves the Barrle then with every Milimeter of travel trough the Air it gets slower. I am open for any dicussion.
---
I think he downed him right before the breaching charge detonated so it counted as a breaching charge kill
---
God damnit am I going to have to wait that long to see the elite animation on YouTube
---
Pog as fuck
---
Yes! Hopefully I'll get around to making all of them one of these days.
---
Jesus christ you kids need to learn to get along
---
i don't like stupidity
---
My boy Kapkan looking really #THICC
---
No problem!
---
Thanks I’ll remember to do that when I play today
---
&gt;the ranked map pool should consist of all maps that give both teams a reasonable shot at winning in overtime
---
thing is, apart from the ESL maps, the others aren't balanced/viable anymore. Meta/rules/...
---
***E G G***
---
Literally just ask any pro player about Fortress (You don't even need to do that actually, just use Google), they will tell you the exact same thing I said.
---
When the most elite of the playerbase (The ones that are actually playing this game as a job) say that something is bad (Many said it's one of the worst maps ever introduced in Siege) chances are it's because it is.

Ok I agree with what u have just said 
---
I wouldn’t be upset with that if it came out
---
No no no. Somebody already says knock knock when breaching. So the next logical step is when she is on the team she replies "Who's there?"
---
You planning on doing wardens gadget  too?
---
Very nice, that pistol shot was straight brutal lol
---
Tachanka would reine supreme.
---
What are the yellow things on the map entries
---
Tbh redacting everything about her is just straight up lazy
---
I think we need even more content tbh. This game would get boring if the wait for new ops/seasons was any longer than it already is
---
Holy fuck Maestro with a full MG42.
---
&gt;Not everyone wants to play Bomb or hostage ranked ffs 
---
jokes on you, hostage is gone too.
---
But hey, at least there will be less players claiming to be plat and understand the game while playing secure the area.
---
*Details* 
---
Love it btw
---
It said he was influenced by "Mak 哥", which is actually a well known actor named Chow Yun-fat.

I see why they are doing it, i just hate it. I tried Bomb during the last week and I had no fun at until i switched back to secure area.
---
They hopefully have a huge loss in total players, even through they probably won't do anything about it. Ubisoft keeps getting shittier with every season.
---
I did :)
---
Is that a leak? Year 4 season 3 operator! Can slide really fast on his belly...

###Caps lock title

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.
---
Please re-post your submission using standard letters.
---
I understood that reference
---
So to pronounce Nøkk, it's similar to 'knuckle'? Just without the 'le'?
---
peekers advantage is very much a thing, so yea you are to some degree right.
---
Ooo good idea. Would you have the operators right in the middle?
---
Thank god those were starting to get annoying
---
Casual modes are specifically made to be played without consequences. Ranked has a ranking system, alongside the title. It's a clear indicator which is the one you're meant to "tryhard" in, alongside the leaver penalties.  
---
Casual isn't even a "You can just fuck around" title, in a lot of competitively focused games it's seen as a practice area before ranked play.
---
Yes I do
---
they did not qualify for the lan-event
---
I'm the elite
---
They did not qualify in EU to play at Milano. The top 2 from each region get to play at the finals, and Lestream and Empire made it through. G2 are currently chilling from their win at the six invitational, in terms of money.
---
I'm guilty of this as well they think you were afk or someone new. That makes them think you're an easy target. But oh boy that spetznaz recruit dunked our team harder than anyone in NBA could
---
They did qualify for the finals because they weren’t in the top 2 positions of EU ProLeague this year. They came 3rd behind LeStream and Empire
---
1. Empire - 32 Points
---
2. LeStream - 29 Points
---
3. G2 Esports - 21 Points
---
Yeah this is a good direction but we still can't get her name in any of this lore ideas.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/8uMyfgr
---
These aren't perfect (the Warden one has a bit of a weird edge) but it's a s good I've got them.
---
I'm a solid Gold 1 ranked and I don't care much about my rank. What i care about that secure area on casual is boring, on Ranked it's pretty much fun. I don't consider bomb fun and I don't understand why they are cutting out a whole mode, it wouldn't hurt them to let some ppl play secure area ranked
---
Splinter cell for nokk
---
im level 151 and i have 5
---
It also removes the noise indicator from the enemy screen, don’t forget about it. I think most people don’t know that about suppressors though. But I prefer flash hider for that same reason, then I get no damage reduction.
---
So happy my main finally gets an Elite skin, as I have it for all other ops that I rarely play :S
---
You rite
---
That will be awesome! Hope Ubi gonna do it, also i want new bundle for Tachanka:D
---
Oh thanks , was wondering why i didn’t see them in the finals Lol
---
A sight. Lasers can give you away if someone sees it
---
Why so toxic?
---
joystick lol
---
Yes. Exactly that.
---
&gt; only been happening for a few weeks and seemed to start after a recent patch
---
Yes, the last one. The red made me jump a couple times too.
---
Well we have a surname at the very least.
---
N-uh-ck
---
They were deactivated it because there was a bug with IQ that they’re working on
---
Nothing at the moment. They are temporarily removed till a glitch being done with them is fixed.
---
Sight
---
It looks awesome! Hope we will get more things like that
---
I love that you have a glass that says “Break When Lesion Elite Comes Out”. I need to get me one of those
---
Because he’s a big guy. Just because you’re fit, it doesn’t mean you’re a fast runner. Most built guys are slow runners. Add on a bulletproof vest, a gun or two, ammo and a knife. That slows you down considerably.
---
I mean those clips aren't used for serious gameplay it's just some devs showing off the new toys trying to get people to either buy a season pass or just the new op in general (they already sold me on warden that's the main I'm bringing out when smokes or flashes start to annoy me)
---
No, I searched all of them up on rainbowsix tracker. Which said they were the 12th highest elo  ranked player and the others used to be plat and gold but were in copper 4
---
Level 234 no legends
---
What region are you? You say your connection is “great” but nobody I have ever talked to takes longer than a minute or so to find a match. Maybe a couple minutes in *high* diamond.
---
Can’t agree more as a native Hongkonger
---
That’s what I mean, he is boosting his elo, skill wise he isn’t the 12th best.
---
I'm the same, although a little clumsy at times
---
Second hand could be a good way to make it more reasonable - obviously making sure it's from a trusted seller, and in full working order
---
yeah but people dont care what publisher want...
---
They said the vortex scope will be available for the FMG-9 so I imagine Smoke and Nøkk will have it.
---
Watch this people: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsSNbAgLD2wzW3I_wJevUm2bgrCmhjgGI
---
Check out the link down below mate
---
Holy shit they were biased against G2 lol
---
I am however glad to see Empire win yesterday, it was one hell of a turnaround, and they played a great match against EG
---
Well full set cost me 79€ with 20% ubisoft discount which is 13€ per chibi, I’m satisfied
---
They can't do elite for the recruit as well as recruit is an operator that can be picked by multiple people. You couldn't have 5 elite recruits running around. Ubi does not want that and they have straight up said they don't condone people playing recruit over other viable operator choices
---
Just come to pc anyways, I was level 150 or so on Xbox with all kinds of money spent on it for elites pro sets and other shit. Do I miss it? Absolutely.. so I regret leaving it behind for pc? Definitely not.
---
Hello Hstuff-, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bqw0tw/saddest_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I freakin love the spas but she doesn’t have a long range. Maybe adding the .44 or .357 desert eagle would make it viable.
---
The MPX can't be save, honestly it's just plain bad if you don't take the recoil in consideration. The smoke SMG yeah it's good, but it's not fun to play / visually appealing. I heard a lot of people saying it's good but strangely very few said they liked it.
---
Full video, (with more memes)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Gf-8bp77Lo&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gf-8bp77Lo&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
That’s boosting tho, which isn’t allowed and to play that many matches to get that much elo battle eye/ ubi would have band it, if it was boosting?
---
That isn’t a one tap. That’s just semi fire and you hit a lucky headshot.
---
You'll only be boosting your enemy.
---
Thanks, nearly done!
---
*esports ready*
---
I like the purple for diamond. That’s sick.
---
Not really. Majors offers much more recognition and a higher prize pool.
---
Lets be honest, people saying ø isnt said like o may be right, but if they went "nuk nuk" with an accent it would be normal anyway.
---
But I can expect an artist to make something original. Not just highly referenced photo.
---
I could settle for that
---
I'm already watching both Bikini, Tuxbird, Jay etc. but I didn't know if they were valid to say that they're "teachers" xD
---
Nah boosting isn’t against the rules my friend. Just being boosted by cheaters. 
---
4 coppers and 1 diamond while incredibly annoying isn’t cheating 
---
3 golds being boosted to diamond by a guy with hacks. That is against the rules.
---
If you look up during the name and shame bans, It never says banned for boosting. It says banned for being boosted by a cheater.
---
This old suppressors used a rubber "wipe" at the end of the suppressor which came into contact with the bullet slowing it down, it was there to help hold the gases in longer, but modern suppressors don't use this as the baffels are machined to be as close to the round without slowing the round down. On average a suppressors will gain about 18feet per second to a unsuppressed round
---
BB doesn't get picked until matchpoint or overtime where all hell breaks lose.
---
Besides, I don't intend to ban is about any ops. I ban broken ones. I need the "useful" ops. It's the broken ones that need to be out or reworked. Especially "fundamentally broken" ones like BB.
---
Just have to do that while concussed, as ela, against zofia while on a tachanka turret.
---
20 dollars for a meme? Trust me, nobody is that silly.
---
P.s. developer (not publisher) decides what is introduced, and devs have said time and again that they don't want a liability to be a worthy pick.
---
MPX with acog would make Warden OP, he has a shitty gun to counter balance his ability. Maybe Nøkk could get the MP5SD or PDW9
---
Hibana?
---
I agree Nokk might not Need an acog her utility is good and she seems strong on tts. Tbh I kinda wanted to see the fmg-9 with an acog
---
Yeah okay
---
I don't see anything wrong here, you see head from upstairs you shoot. that's just how it should work.
---
Not a bad idea, but doubt they would buff her in anyway.
---
This was crap anti thetic to R6
---
Go play left4 dead
---
Like vigil, his ability will be unused 9/10 times but unlike vigil, he doesnt have good ass guns to fall back on.
---
How? I'm banning for him as well.
---
wait..... is that an actual "Ø" in the titel !!!
---
That makes sense she is supposed to be stealthy character I guess an acog would make her too op
---
A light blue tie would have made that pure epicness, but it is pure epicness nonetheless.
---
Yeah I meant like a miniscule amount, the game didn't get any traction till late 2010
---
Ye
---
Ubisoft collectables.
---
I pre-ordered back in March for the latest set.
---
maestro: can put 2 bottomless pits anywhere on the map and kick people into them during the round.
---
You’re seriously gonna try to take my ex girlfriend like that
---
nah i meant mutes mp5k that one doesnt have an acog but yea I dont doutbt that the ops will be decent its just that the weapon choices are disappinting thats all
---
My allegiance is to the beefy rook, the true chunky !

---
That’s basically his elite skin
---
(On mobile) go to the subreddits home pages press the three dots on the top right of the screen and there is an option called change user flair
---
I don't think that lore between Nøkk and Cav should have any impact on game balance.
---
Hibana would be a pile of fidget spinners
---
The Ubisoft store has the latest set for pre-order and some of the others, but the first set are sold out.
---
I remember the old recoil. Ive had rainbow since it's release but I took a break over the summer in year 2
---
What a noob, don’t you know the new operator Juice Glass??
---
He’s getting an acog in the next operation
---
The new uniform reminds me of the movie Wandering Earth
---
Amazing cosplay, however you should probably make the guns have an orange tip for safety reasons, unless they are real, but I know doks isn’t
---
Probably should’ve left the first one out.
---
Adobe Premiere Pro CC
---
Thank you! Didn't have a spare car battery to use so I just grabbed jumpers
---
Fine for 1v1s, not for team games. The Elo system was fine-tuned for years, and trust me, it makes sense. It determines individual skill and awards rank accordingly.
---
No dude thats fucking cuthulu who strikes so much fear into everyone they instantly drop down and shiver
---
That's on his forehead...
---
I’m. Nice try my capitao has that covered
---
no, should be "Rød grød med fløde"
---
Alibi's icon is an octopus not a squid.
---
stop :(
---
Did you even read the title
---
You have noticed the Hammer and Scalpel cinematic they just released a few months ago, right?
---
Had same thing happen with a Razer Naga and now a Logitech G502.
---
Doesn't seem to happen all the time, but it's definitely noticable when it causes you to lose gun fights because you're suddenly hipfiring.
---
what are the Finka changes?
---
Did you even read the post ?
---
Bror du udtaler fuck forkert hvis du udtaler u som ø.
---
When I first started I thought Jäger was a shield op
---
Zofia can self revive because someone tried to drown her as a kid, this is an example of lore impacting game balance
---
It didn’t say that Spartans were Italian, it’s just based on the spartan helmet you dingus
---
Where is the joke
---
And the reason is....
---
Everyone knows you run holo on a knife.
---
The frames are currently listed on my Etsy. I only supply the frame, the rest like the glass and straps is up to the customer. Camcamzoro did an amazing job with hers.
---
But it's not a Spartan's helmet genius. It's a Roman helmet.
---
Wtf you mean have you been paying attention at all? Ranked is coming out of Beta with pick and ban, new Ui, and also do you want no ops and for them to say It’s Op Health 2 when they can give us ops and still do Improvements to the game like in health...
---
Np man! Have a good one.
---
I hate it when ash mains do that pisses me off when anybody does
---
Yeah I don’t see anything
---
&gt; I don’t see your point.
---
Clearly. His smoke vision only comes up once he's been stationary for about 8 seconds,and even swivelling his aim counts as movement. At least that's how it is on the test server right now.
---
Ye ik, I was joking about how Nøkks symbol looks like a fingerprint
---
CLOAKER THERE!
---
I agree with fortress and hereford but Skyscraper is one of my favorite maps and I think Chalet is a lot of fun
---
Ok sweetie well either way it’s not like this post is serious
---
Alibi should have 7 holograms because of the 8 legs of the octopus. Or 8 holograms if she is the head
---
I have this skin and it's beautiful
---
Other changes are 3-round swaps, and bomb only. I’m not entirely sure though.
---
This would most likely be a good change for the game, but the problem is that half of the community is a bunch of picky assholes who refuse to acknowledge that Ubisoft is working very hard on this game, so it would be good for game health and instead of what we have now, being people bitching about reused ops and shit matchmaking and such, we'd have people bitching about not enough content and that the game is boring.
---
this too haha https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
Neither was my comment babe. Maybe stop calling people out unless you know what you are talking about. Have a good day.
---
Mnk can't fix lack of awareness
---
It's going to be amazing. I'm still a little upset we have so many poorly balanced maps in rotation (Hereford, skyscraper, chalet) but pick and ban will be a big help to make them a bit more bearable.
---
Also fuck Monty. He will never see the light of day in my games. Take your moving wall of "fuck you, you cant kill me, also my other 4 teammates know where you are and are coming for you" bullshit and go fuck yourself.
---
Sorry, I had a moment....but seriously fuck monty
---
Have a shit day nigga
---
Thanks for your input, I was hoping someone from Denmark would jump in!
---
Got it within 2 months of buying the game
---
Lmao stop fanboying ubisoft they were just lazy
---
Isnt lesion like 50
---
You don't seem to understand.
---
If the enemy team does not use BB, then you are not banning BB for them. You're not even banning it for you as you don't use him either. It's a _wasted ban_ that could otherwise be used to mess with the enemy team better.
---
I never go up against BB, maybe 1 every 10 games has a BB but they're not a threat - I'm in Gold.
---
I use my bans on operators dependant on the map. Versatility.
---
Yes.
---
So does this mean we get cargo shorts Ying, or will she get an even superer suit? Ying Mech??
---
I mean I wouldn’t say she’s garbage i think every op takes practice
---
44, actually
---
Ive been playing since release and didnt get it until last month when i did it 4x in 1 day 😂😂😂
---
The actual danish troops aren’t trying to be in a balanced fight with their enemy under threat of a screaming community. I think they rather prefer being overpowered.
---
The new ranked screen shows your rank fluctuates based on WIN/LOSS and MMR Ratio between teams. Therefore, boosting should become obsolete
---
Sorry about earlier I accidentally got side tracked so I deleted it and gave my reasoning for this post in the comments.
---
Unfortunately too poor for a PC build rn 😭😭 I honestly want to so badly.
---
you have my sword
---
Tomorrow i think
---
Good. Secure and hostage are not competitive.
---
So, Ranked was basically made worse in every way. 3-round rotation is dumb in pro-league, worse in actual play. Hopefully they'll change it after the number of games that go 4-0 significantly increase. There's no reason to limit bomb when you can already do that if you want. I don't think I need to waste time further explaining how disappointing these ops are either. The update just kinda suck.
---
I don't think Y4 is the last one. They want to support R6 as much as they want but this
---
What are you using for a helmet
---
Oh, ok.
---
Isn't is pronounced like road groad med fload
---
[Benny Hill](https://youtu.be/MK6TXMsvgQg)
---
I thought if you got 2100 it goes to 2300 because that's in the middle of 2100 and 2500, the 1500 minimum i think just so people cant get negative mmr and start on like 500 and start low copper
---
What happens in this case tough?
---
r/subifellfor
---
Mg age has nothing to do with I was just saying that 12 years olds don’t pay very close attention
---
It’s actually a Splatoon and For Honor crossover.
---
That's what i thought but i was a bit worried cus i have dropped quite low recently after being higher up.
---
Well, can't say that it's unrelated, it has a rainbow on it.
---
Extraordinary
---
Yeah and it's 4 to win, so one team will have three easy rounds and then they have to win once to secure the match. This is a terrible idea, honestly it's dumb in pro-league, but practically idiotic here.
---
I just messaged someone on the enemy team if they’d let me do it lmao
---
Wouldn't complain if the P90 became the main gun of another defender, or a custom P90 at any rate.
---
This is an off topic question but how do I get that little tag that says “bandit main” by my name?
---
Monetization through overpriced content. Come on: A year and 4 new maps and 8 rehashed operators for 40 bucks. In that time frame completely new fames can be made.
---
Great for you. But that does not exactly change that there are more dlc ops than base ops and a lot of ops see very little usage.
---
it’s been 50 min already, where’s the CoreRoss video at
---
Thank you bro this is just Beautiful
---
What car is that in the background?
---
When the season starts?
---
never seen it. but if its covering her head thats a no no
---
No smokes playing bomb?
---
I see that mustang in the back. You apart of r/ProjectCar ?
---
I just got this game yesterday so excuse the dumb questions but: how much do the new phantom sight skins cost? Do they all come in a bundle and are they universal? And how long will it take me to get enough renown to purchase Nokk? Thank you.
---
Happy cake day
---
the name is icelandic it is pronounced nook, thats the way the devs said it is, good night
---
I see the rainbow, but no 6
---
Lucky I got that before the rework. Now it's hard af
---
You want copper to be ghetto for console players*
---
Green dot sight instead of red dot would be nice
---
The biggest issue for me is that this is pointless. If you only want to play bomb there's a setting for that. There's no reason too force this on people and reduce the amount of content available.
---
i wonder why
---
The problem for me is that I don't have time to learn any operator. I have a few favorites but that's it. I can't play a sibgle one especially good simply because I am missing time. So I would prefer them making their base stronger and better, more fine tuning and polish, over new content.
---
Fun fact, Ubi somehow turned the Arabic word Qa'd (leader) into Kaid. Just let it go man, people will pronounce it the way they can remember it. It doesn't matter as long as everyone in the team understands.
---
Wonder why what
---
Funnily enough I introduced a new friend to the game today and he got it very easily. The achievement might be bugged. 
---
You know they added the concussion effect right? So when a breach charge goes off people on the other side get concussed in quite some range. Killing someone after that whilst they are concussed gives you the "breach charge" bonus and unlocks the achievement.
---
Yep! Uhh... totally meant to do that! Yea! Gotta aim for crotch if ya know what I mean
---
Does he really TK randoms though and not just his friends? Since "Subility" is another R6 streamer who apparently plays with this guy so unless he's actually known for being toxic, I'm just going to assume that he messes with his friends for donations, he wouldn't be the only streamer to do so and I don't see the issue if they're just palling around.
---
I mean with a name like “I am toxic” it is usually what you see on smurf accounts. I can see why they wouldn’t wanna be on a team with someone with a name that suggests they are toxic. 
---
If you joined my game with that name I’d be very scarred of getting team killed or vote kicked by you.
---
Besides the name tho ps4 is very toxic yes.
---
What you said would just be even more reason to allow it...
---
Mira on her best maps is almost certain. I've seen a lot of ying bans and maybe hard breacher on some maps.
---
Thanks cunt
---
Oh look at this bio, it's gone with loadouts creation team!
---
Just want to play the game and you do that
---
Well I mean I don’t main her for tentacle porn xd
---
More like the friendly team, tbh.
---
Im a hibana and lesion main but got no money to be the elites but still cool
---
But she doesn’t have the white bars on the camera for most of the cameras (excluding yokais and mozzie drones) so one could argue she is more invisible.
---
True, I have it mostly turned off unless my mates want to have it on.
---
yes
---
He's obviously queuing with his friends and I would assume the TK:s only apply to his friends.
---
Yea but you said I "stole the Idea".. Yet I didnt steal any Idea. Thats like saying someone posting mozzie is a good op and someone else stating that mozzie is a good op too. Your logic makes no sense.
---
walter
---
The second knife should have hit
---
STOP FLEXING ON ME PLS I DONT EVEN HAVE BLACK ICE AND IM LEVEL 107 AHHHHH
---
As usual, console was likely not even considered when making this change...
---
"Quickly and easily."
---
Going into a but of psychology and experience here, but if a lot of people *think* secure is easier, they play secure a lot. But really, because everyone is trying so hard, it actually evens out.
---
Pair that with a lack of balance and really, secure diamonds are just as valid as bomb diamonds. Assuming we're seeing rank as a measurement of skill, which it definitely is not.
---
Wait what?
---
So many conflicting reports on how to actually pronounce her name..
---
Nøkk, like how you would pronounce book, or nook and cranny, seems to be the front runner. Can't remember where I saw this, but I swore it was from Ubisoft directly.
---
"My age has nothing to do with this fact that I'm basing on my age."
---
UBI: can i speak to your manager

WHAT MAKES IT WORSE I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS BLACK ICE WHOS 20 LEVELS BELOW ME :(

Isn't Lesion Chinese? Why is there Cantonese?
---
Still though, those things are realitively realistic.
---
Am I reading this correctly. Are we gonna be playing 3 attacks 3 defenses in a row? Man, I hate it. It makes it possible I’ll have to play say 6 attacking rounds in a row with only one defense inbetween in case we lose the first game 4-0. Maaaan I’m so not happy about this one.

They removed them temporarily

---
U got to love the bot moves.
---
Don't pick Claymores or Deployable shields. They have recently been removed but instead of being given the other equipment, they just rip you off and give you nothing.
---
Reminds me of Takeda from Mortal Kombat X

Grey store AM-95. I can get you a link when I go on lunch

68 mustang coupe in Pebble beige
---
1. secure area
---
2. you body shotted fuze with an awful smg that’s how bad the players are
---
3. nobody cares if you got an ace
---
Claymores, Deployable Shields and Clash have been disabled for the time being due to bugs and exploits that have been found across all systems.
---
don’t forget about the helicopter on Border
---
What the... I have no idea how that happened. Must've shared it someplace and then hit ctrl-v when I was trying to copy the url I was going to place here...
---
EDIT: fixed
---
Nah, it's running. A 68 mustang that's 99% original and in Pebble beige
---
Aw, come on Ubi, fuck off with the nerf. His weapon is totally fine.
---
At least add new weapons to Nøkk and Warden before trying to nerf the balanced ones...
---
I thought it was Dokkaebi
---
You would be correct. I do not just go around tking randoms lol
---
Holy shit he just pulled the Ol’ 360^o on him, absolutely fucking bamboozled
---
Claymores are quarantined due to a glitch that allowed to do some invisibility shit, but not only the claymores are temporarily deactivated but also deployable shields (a shield infront of the head glitch) as well as Clash (she could shoot while her shield was activated).
---
Can we just ban him if he posts stuff like this again
---
Call it, You Won’t
---
I just took a look through your Etsy. Holy talented.
---
You've got some pretty freaking neat stuff there, friend. That Thatcher EMP replica might be in my cart as I'm typing this. ;)
---
Alibi is obvious
---
As a Lesion main and someone who doesn't buy skins, I will be making this my first Elite Skin purchase. Only thing I'm sad about is no futuristic cargo shorts :(
---
what they meant was in silent step she can only use her pistol
---
Dokkaebi developed the glove.
---
Is alibi not obvious?
---
Umm not really chief
---
whut?   
---
I thaught thaht the only ones that existed were thermite, smoke, IQ and tachanka...
---
Also Mira is a Spanish op and mira means look or see in Spanish
---
Thatcher shits down electronics, and thatch is a caveman tool, maybe thatcher symbolizes that?
---
Not that kind of rainbow
---
No more blitz and echo, fuck yes.
---
There's no reason the number of 4-0 matches should go up in a balanced environment.
---
If one team completely outskills the other, sure, it'll be a 4-0 but it would've been under the old system too.
---
This is better because you can adjust your playstyle to counter the other team's defense (or attack) instead of having to change your mindset for each round.
---
Probably but idk
---
Why'd you switch from PC?
---
Tbh I think skyscraper might just need a slight buff and yeh remove chalet
---
What’s this about losing skins
---
Which is stupid. Suppressors make guns MORE accurate irl and actually increase bullet velocity so WHY in this game do they do the opposite?! (I know it's for balancing but still)
---
OvO boo yah! You sir, made me laugh a lot!
---
you people can’t live without acogs. i’m sorry but that’s the way ubisoft are taking it
---
i think they're exploring more reversals of roles. like clash having a shield, cav/vigil offense (nøkk) and glaz on defense (warden). Also warden is a counter to Blitz, which we've been needing for a while now. 
---
we'll see how operation Recycle unfolds
---
I switched from ps4 to pc
---
Are you sure people can use this if the head shot on ash doesn't land
---
They are temporarily disabled until Ubisoft can fix the IQ and shield head glitch.
---
Oh, nice
---
Their was a giant exploit where you could put the sheild infront of your face and one where iq was invisible
---
Maestros ability sounds like a good scp
---
It's about switching your platform without being able to transfer skin
---
Listening to the game devs say it. Its a Nook sound like "book"
---
Or we could create an extra sweaty try hard playlist called ESL which is, as the name suggests, ESL rules and playlists.
---
i’ll go 75/35-25 or 100/37-20 or anywhere near that. dead zones are always 5 for the right, 7 for the left stick ghost touch
---
As long as you didn’t pull any hard Rs
---
Do you mean useing the oparetors or fighting against them ?
---
Big fan of watch dogs so you have made my day! Been subbed to you on ig for a while so I can't wait to see it there,too!
---
Fixed – Shotguns do not reliably destroy wooden beams in walls
---
Aha! That was a quick fox after the stream yesterday. But omg thank you! Best fix imo as someone who plays mira a lot.
---
But that's just it. Similar size completely different measurement and name
---
RIP ash acog
---
There’s a reason why the golds are gold.
---
Yep, its a real number...Daniel (Not saying last name)
---
What will your channel name be?
---
Too much unnecessary fragmentation. I would prefer casual to be changed to play like current ranked, just with the casual map pool and backfill retained.
---
I think you mean: Why do I even play House?
---
no. That’s what ranked should be but less rounds. Casual should be what ranked is but no ranking system.
---
Pretty sure it was normal round scores in the playlist even.
---
In lesion bio it says he joined CBRN Threat unit
---
Noek noek
---
I didn't know what ND was. Looked it up. Then found the reference you talked about.  
---
Treat it like nothing more than an easter egg, unless confirmed by Ubi to be part of the universe.  
---
In fact treat everything like this as nothing more than an easter egg unless specifically confirmed by Ubisoft to be proof that the games share their universe.  
---
Also, don't forget split timelines...
---
&gt; most
---
Some people definitely still go potato every once in a while. Sorry if it sounded like a blanket statement. I was trying to be general, not all encompassing.
---
&gt; coffee and socks
---
Me irl
---
Exactly. Why wear white on bank for example. Grey and black will blend almost anywhere
---
reading a donation vs. posting prices
---
Maybe clarify that they're all your friends first, and willing. thats completely different and at that point its not toxic.
---
How am I an idiot? I scrolled through the comments and saw 3 people actually played on pro teams, plus the one caster but he doesn't count considering he doesn't play professionally. Oh and I don't complain when people call it stupid. I just tell them why I like it. It's to trigger people like me, you, Danny on PC, randos, Everyone.
---
They said those fixes will probably take a long-ish time in thread about the exploits. So I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re not ready by S2 launch.
---
Yeah his bio explains that he joined the CBRN in Hong Kong
---
Awesome! It's still such a fun game, with around 500 people daily. I am so incredibly lucky to have a great relationship with Splash Damage (heading down to the studio for the fourth time in July) and they have supported me doing my prints from their game. Several of my pieces are present in their studio which is just...wow.
---
Nah, nah, THIS is what's going to get everyone crazy  
---
"Fixed – Change the TAN Holographic to a BLACK Holographic for all weapons."
---
Does it say anything about iq, clash and shield glitches?
---
Concs lead to kills. So do interrogations. We can make an argument about Interrogations being too strong even,but nah.
---
About that,Warden takes away Glaz's advantage of smoking and peeking at what only he can see. That doesn't remotely make Glaz weak. By the same reason,Nokk being untrackable by Caveira does not make Caveira weak,especially when she still has 3 people to onetap.
---
It's because all new maps and ops are designed and balanced for bomb mode.
---
Here before trending
---
Nice move, but I prefer the go fuck yourself and YEET!
---
Last rank, its the most proved measure of skill. The more matches you play the more accurate your real rank becomes.
---
It's called Stark, and it has a wolf minion?
---
I was like this is probs fake, then I literally see coreross has a vid on it. I am sorry for doubting you, I was wrong
---
You opinion is wrong.
---
Ahaha, stay salty.
---
yeah, this happens to me all the time when i'm joining 'a game in progress'
---
I'm usually in a 4 or 5 stack. The only times I'm not are at the start of stream when I'm waiting for a spot to open up, or at the end of stream when things are dying down and people are going to bed. But I definitely see how the wording led to all of this, and will be making adjustments for the future.   
---
Can I be toxic? Sure, I think everyone has their moments. But I try really hard to not be a toxic person in game or out; and I'm sorry I've given you all the wrong impression of me.
---
*New Movie Coming soon!*
---
*Siege Has Fallen*
---
yeah I noticed this playing as rook over the weekend
---
Does 18 damage because this game said fuck calibers.
---
I really don't care what Pro-League thinks. Pro-League is such a small subsection of the community and they don't matter, nothing makes me more upset than when something is balanced with mostly them in mind like how Lion recently was. The argument: "But Pro-league" is nonsensical. I have no idea why they don't play those maps, but it's largely irrelevant. I'd like to actually know why on earth this opinion exists on these maps, because I really can't comprehend it. I've laid out some of the issues with Bank and Coastline, but I can't think of them for Skyscraper or (New)Hereford. I can see Fortress because it's overly complex in places, but me and my squad have always seen Skyscarper as a favorite and (New)Hereford as literally the best map currently in the game.

Listen with sound on, slow it down, and zoom in. He definitely hit AT LEAST 3 or 4 shots on her side towards the end.
---

---
I retract all previous statements made against the inclusion of PL rules to ranked. I thought about it and see how it would benefit and grow the game. Sorry.
---
because all the devs are working on ghost recon

No

It's more like a place holder for nøkk

No... read before you judge it
---
Also "container"
---
Kinda
---
Since February every new player has to unlock the base ops
---
Yeah, no. This would be so unbearably op and would be too easy to use. You’ve designed an op that counters about half of the defenders. That’s a big problem.
---
what do I do if I’m inside a room with no windows
---
Too bad Takeda couldn’t make main roster this time
---
They said it will be addressed, Tuesday.
---
EEEEEE
---
Yes, but defenders are usually camping and not moving as much. It's a silent, one shot kill anywhere on their body. Imagine Maverick making a hole and then Motswi shooting them through the hole without making a sound.
---
No point in a lesion elite.. You can't see the gadget skin, uniform looks boring and animation is probably crap too..
---
Ubi is giving up on siege lately.
---
The new ops this season are literally combinations of existing gadgets with reused existing guns.
---
It hurts to say and hear this but this is the truth...
---
Exactly the kind of shit my friends would say lol
---
Still lame af, and encourages other people
---
0:10 when you throw an EMP to it
---
nice work! can't wait to see maverick's navy blue
---
That is true, their design team is busy; I was imagining they’d take an “old” map, rework it, reskin it, and boom “new” map.
---
Personally, I like casual because I can votekick or leave if there are griefers. Instead of being stuck in ranked with a party trying to derank and taking turns team killing me, I can leave the match without a suspension.
---
I also play games to relax and have fun, not get sweaty. Granted, if I had a clan to play with, I’d probably enjoy ranked more.
---
Like Lesion? Yes, but it's a ranged shot that instantly downs. Boring weapons? What do you want them to have? Laser beams and flying shurikens?
---
BabyRage, cry about it

there kind of is... the trailer of them

---
As a fellow salter, this would be both good and bad. If the kill was legit, yeah I'd be impressed. But if I didn't actually get shot in the head and it reg'd a HS, I'd be even saltier.
---
Oh this idea is so cool
---
It's the same with cav and other Ops so yeah nothing new
---
Didn't have any spare ones sadly, jumpers had to do
---
yeah, another leak for year 3 said 'defenders will finally have a reason to reinforce the floor they're on'
---
Clancy himself was incredibly xenophobic and pretty racist. Spoke once at a friend's high school. "Back in my day, we called homeless people what they are, bums!"

Op
---
The defender is a President, he loves to build walls.
---
I don't think she should have an acog but she should definetly have some other gun, I made a concept for some of her guns but fanboys really seem to hate it when I call ubi lazy
---
Eh, fair enough xD
---
Kkkkkkkk KID!!
---
It's missing the hit plate so it's for show...
---
Well maybe not the first two guns that show up on google images when you search for assult rifle
---
They should’ve either have gone with the C7/C8 with ELCAN optic or the suppressed MP5. I’m cool with them not giving her an AR if it makes her OP, but if you’re trying to stick with weapons used by the actual operators, they kinda messed this one up.
---
More like Warden, Trump and Harry.
---
Based on? Guesses? The ubi tweet?
---
That’s not a half bad idea to be honest.
---
And the griefing goes away at the higher ranks, soloquing is brutal unless you’re in plat tbh. In my earlier seasons I’ve played down there at silver and low gold and that shit is tough. 
---
The sweat and grind is what makes this game fun for me though
---
Or you know, headshot them? If they arnt moving you now have to switch to your gadget and aim, and shoot, and you’ll probably have the worlds shittiest sight unless you can attach an acog onto that thing. And that means this character will need someone to help him or her create hidden sight lines, if maverick dies, welp he’s on his own, gadget is now useless as you need to walk into defenders line of sight to shoot them. Better yet, have the pistol be laced with poison that deals additional temporary damage like the guu damage, it slows them down and disorients them slightly, lasting for a few seconds. This would be most effective at longer ranges in a gun fight where you HAVE to switch to a secondary with a chance to kill them even after they kill you from the damage over time.
---
Amazing, Lesion doesn't have to Break-Dance to release all the energy he stored.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Kkkkkk KID!!

What’s hgc? 好9 something? I know the others you mentioned. I’m disappointed that they didn’t use a better location for a map and weapons. Theme park is ok but it would of been more awesome if it was some super urban place like mk or something like the convention center. I know most, if not all
---
it was like talking to most reddit users on r/rainbowsix .annoying. exhausting. a lot of "haha and git gut" "u just beeed" and nothing a normal adult would actually say.
---
Holy crap dude wtf
---
I really can't see any correlation...
---
Plot twist and a half right there
---
actually, i just got some news. nokk was too powerfull with her gun. it may have been reused but thats why they switched im pretty sure
---
It’s ether a problem with your closest datacenter or your internet throttling your connection to it
---
Are we not going to address the fact that they misspelled rappelling
---
I already explained how it does and how it breals the game. Also it does hurt me because instead of flashed out operators and content we get cheap rehashes. I explained that in.great length. I explained this in the very post with which I started this thread.
---
Maybe... look for a game you like then? Because when the only thing which keeps you playing is new content, then i kinda doubt you are interested in the game itself. Only in the new content.
---
Even Titanfall 2 still has players.
---
Dude you sound depressed... you good bruh ?
---
Clutch or kick.
---
Play ranked. No kicking, problem solved
---
Fine night
---
I just mean how did he go about bragging over using MnK?
---
All for it on defence, even in ranked (Though I don't really play ranked). MP7, C4 &amp; wire. Bandit and/or Mute with 3-4 of those recruits is actually a very capable team.  
---
Offence I feel differently, I'm all for M870 rushing but that's about it. There are usable guns, and the frag/smoke combo is valuable, but I feel the attacker abilities are more valuable. Plus everyone can have an ACOG without being 1 speed.
---
K bye
---
Depending on how many tripwires the operator has, it could either make Kapkan useless or your operator useless.
---
If he has less that 5, you might as well pick Kapkan for the full damage and potential kill.
---
If he has more, then by quantity, the new operator is more powerful.
---
IDK how to fix that exactly
---
no, it was supposed to be either a galil or a scar with a fixed scope based on preliminary leaks. the galil has been moved for next season, as it was just discovered in game files
---
Honestly, I’m going to try solo q ranked with the new patch. Fingers crossed
---
lol
---
Сука, блять. I can do the same.
---
Enough with the fucking trap meta
---
Lemme guess, they use already existing guns as well?
---
Bye 👋
---
I feel like a carbine would fit for her or yägers carbine would work
---
I think that operator would be underwhelming tbh
---
Lol, dance some more for me pea-brain.
---
I think one that can be hidden behind Mira’s would be pretty cool, but just that, it’s like when you wear coloured glasses and look at words of the same colour but now they become invisible. Anythign else would be overpowered, there’s now warden who counters smokes and flashbangs
---
I could see that, or some other GSG9 member
---
Love u xx
---
First off, splitting the community into 3 different game modes already makes the playerbase spread out. As it currently stands, high plat/diamond queue times can take up to 30 mins or more. This shouldn't be the case with the current player population.
---
As for a secure diamond, the best way I can describe it is that it's like going through the express checkout with 100 items to skip waiting in line at a regular register. You're bypassing the waiting in line (grinding mmr in bomb) to get out of the store quicker and easier for only yourself (getting to high plat/diamond). It's unfair to those who only play bomb, the true game mode for ranked (supported by the fact that's the only game mode played in pro league), as it is a more difficult, team play reliant, strategy driven game mode than secure.
---
*These next paragraphs are optional, I blather on about technical details of why secure shouldn't be a ranked game mode*
---
I'm not saying that secure doesn't have it's own skill set and gameplay style. It definitely brings a new twist into a game like siege, but it doesn't fit into a ranked setting. It's too imbalanced to be considered a ranked game mode, and that goes for both attackers and defenders. Defenders only have to hold one room so all of their utility is used to hold that one room down. This makes it harder for attackers to push said room as it's heavily defended by almost a whole team's utility and the operators themselves. On the flip side, if attackers gain control of the room and start securing, it's a panic rush for defenders to get into the room to stop the secure, and for most sights this is extremely hard to do if you're facing a competent attacking team. They'll usually have their utility down to stop a push onto sight (claymores, airjabs, lion and dokkaebi drops, glaz with smoke, etc. etc.) All while holding the few openings to sight pinned down. It makes for a very short and chaotic gameplay experience that doesn't have a good balance to justify it being a ranked mode.
---
Roamers have to rush back to sight recklessly in an attempt to help regain control of the sight, and if the attacker team knows this they can hold angles on them and wait for them to Sprint around a corner for an easy pick. How quickly the power shifts between the two sides is too chaotic and unpredictable that it makes it too RNG to qualify for a legitimate ranked mode IMO. If you have a cooperative team with good map and game knowledge you can face roll the enemy team easily, securing an easy high rank early in the season while the rest of the players that grind legitimately through bomb have to climb their way up through the ranks.
---
Old asf lol
---
What is it?
---
\^yep
---
Can't say I'd ever wear it outside of my house but its cool
---
Thanks Obama
---
The additional clusters do damage?
---
This would be amazing.
---
Every game still has players. Still didn’t explain how it hurts you. I think you think that you are but you really aren’t, you’re just saying why it’s bad not why it affects *you*. Also I’m not interested in the game only for new content, as I play it all the time, but it definitely brings hype and makes it a lot more fun. Warden isn’t a rehash
---
Make sure your NAT type is open and if it isn’t, port forwarding is your friend. Also make sure nothing else is taking priority on your internet, like downloading or streaming.
---
Either I don't know of a app to easily do this or this is insanely impressive to make...
---
It's still bad (compared to other games).
---
It's #1 on my list of things I want improved in Siege.  It's rare that I go a night without problems--mostly hit boxes not matching visual or hits being registered well after they occurred (both for and against).  Maybe this is worse on Xbox than PC?
---
It’s stupid, but this has always bugged me. A regular melee breaks the windows, but a sledgehammer doesn’t!? Glad to see it’s fixed, best season rainbow will ever see now.
---
It was meant as a pun because she’s part of the Jaeger corps

There’s been glitches where even with your shield out it’s not actually out and your actually ads’ing. Or hacks.
---
"fresh" hehe... yeah

(Between you and me, I'm not even Norwegian. I just speak the language) o, haha du hadde meg godt!

Hello SoIidSnack, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/br287i/help_fps_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

And on the victory screen she sings mahna mahna
---
Yet they released The Division 2.
---
We're the glitches fixed? Will we get back our shields and claymores and clash?
---
I have a document containing all the information about them. I could send them to you if you'd like.
---
Damn. Yeah maybe but I’ve always just shot them and I’ve played for a while

I can't ~~beat the shit out of you~~ transfer your bodyguard to rainbow without getting closer.

Nerk?

First of all, Bloodhound isn't trans, second of all, the exact same thing happens with straight characters 'oh they have a husband/wife' , and nobody cares. For the sake of argument I'm sure someone will say that they care about characters in their FPS game having a wife, but we all know they don't.
---
Untrue, but it's fine.

Zofia got downed......didnt withstand......o k a y then

The politics were really what ruined Anthem.

Wtf is that Black Mirror

Those aren’t politically correct though. Remember, this is Ubisoft we’re talking about lol
---
Boy you need help. Funny how all the players who try to work as a team and not shoot their people aren’t having issues. 
---
No body is struggling with this system other than people like you. Aim better, stop shooting your teammates, and the system works fine. Now that I’m thinking about it, this game is probably too mature for you. Don’t like it, stop playing. But if you’re coming to reddit looking for support in this, you’re just going to be called out as the kid with bad aim who wishes he could still TK.
---
Thanks. Getting the game now. Wish me luck!
---
Quality shitpost

In the Rainbow universe he is szill serving.his second term.

Why do developers need to make the sexual preference of characters known?  It's just weird.
---
I actually got kinda excited cuz that always annoyed me.

Thank
---
Native Hongkonger here, fuck China. fuck ubisoft for including shitty chinese memes in a hong kong based operator. Let him represent Hong Kong &amp; our culture.
---
Mate you must be new here lol
---
Not enough his leg is still amazing
---
It's not only about female characters, the problem with the trailer is that there were Scottish Amazons waving Katanas in WW2.
---
No we won't. The game doesn't have DLC weapons.
---
Almost all my games have teammates and enemies + or - 2/3 ranks? No diamonds ever turn up in gold
---
I was willing to give you women in Battlefield 5 since they didn't fit the setting (even though I'm fine with it, myself, but it's a legitimate point, still), but gay characters in Overwatch isn't politics, for the very same reason revealing that a character is straight by introducing a heterosexual significant other for them isn't politics.
---
I’m silver 1 and was playing against 2 Diamond 1s and and 3 plat 1s. The rest of my team were bronze and copper
---
Which has no forced political message? They said themselves they made a world and it’s up to the player to interpret things in it.
---
#ETIAM!
---
Then they have to redo old dlc operator videos too. If you take a look at year 1 and 2 operator trailers, it's more like of gameplay trailer and not the cinematic one like year 3 and 4 trailer. It will cost money and time, thats why it will never happen.
---
Nice.
---
Pretty sure bush would’ve loved that
---
I know, and i’m just justifying your viewpoint...
---
Very quality shitpost
---
Some developers had spoken with GetFlanked, they said that it was necessary to remove the ARs because of balancing and replace them with mediocre guns :/.

New Operator leak: Tai Lopez
---
Still no mention of players who are DDOSing the server if they're losing (on Xbox). It's a huge issue.
---
The newbie playlist was made for new players (hence the name). This is not about putting people with different ranks together like in Battlefield, Call of Duty and the like. The playlist is for those who want to learn how to play the game.
---
Still a SJW mental disorder.
---
No. Not making fun of anyone. Hell if a game was 300GB on PC I would be fucking  irritated too.
---
Really, i sad competitive hostage, not casual. xD
---
Oh dear
---
I have a question @UbiNoty, because there are now 3-round rotations, does that mean the round count will increase?doesn't seem fair for one team to get 3 defense round and then have to only attack once. Unless im misunderstanding?
---
Ummmm. No
---
Smh at all these fake bionicle fans cant even tell the difference between a hero factory and a bionicle
---
&gt; the problem with the trailer is that there were Scottish Amazons waving Katanas in WW2.
---
How is this forced politics issue, exactly?
---
^^ This
---
Yes, not promoting and condoning mental diseases ought to be a point NOT to do this.
---
Maybe not interact with thatcher, therm and hibana
---
He means make a gay character. Not randomly come out and say “oh yeah, this guy is gay”.
---
Or y’know, just ignore that subject entirely because it’s a video game and it doesn’t matter.
---
That's what you get with all these people wanting Ubi to pump out 2 operators every 3 months. And here I am alone with my.opinion that 2 a year would be more than enough.
---
And I'm talking about every mode being so sweaty that people have to smurf where they can to get a normal mp match.
---
Ok
---
If genders were loafs of bread I could make exactly one sanwitch.
---

---
See in hindsight if definitely is, I was just thinking abt the Mira idea and felt that it was too situational seeing as it only works when they have a Mira. So I added the other abilities as a suggestion without thinking of how absurdly goofy that would be
---
Because it's apparently anathema to feature the current sitting President in media.
---
&gt;she should have a better gun/ACOG.
---
 she should have a better gun/ACOG.
---
In that case they also wouldn't need to waste time on all these operators with recycled abilities either.
---
Not entirely. Even skilled players have gone as far to miss things.
---
TY!
---
Thanks for telling us the joke
---
Ugh, reloading at the end of round.
---
^(My ptsd against the mainstream habit of reloading at the end of round is kicking again.)
---
But how did echo shoot himself
---
Thanks for admiring that SJW retoric IS leftist politics, at least a somewhat honest commie soyboy.
---
I literally have nothing against this operation but I do understand other people’s opinions
---
hahahahaha
---
You’re welcome
---
The point with the Overwatch example is that they had no intention of making Soldier 76 gay until there was some pressure put on them to do it. It was a retroactive thing and in my opinion does a disservice to the gay community because it essentially paints them as an afterthought. Like I said previously while it really shouldn’t be, sexuality has become very political and to say otherwise is being intellectually dishonest. Also I have no issue with women in any game so long as you don’t insult my intelligence by saying it’s also historically accurate when it’s clearly not. You can’t have both.
---
If this was added to the game it could really make some different team compositions happen
---
How so? you're getting a fair shot at enemies, in which situations, they shouldn't have been alive.
---
Plus, the spread only gets bigger and bigger. After 8 meter,s they're almost worthless
---
If you're in a low rank to get a "normal game"you aren't smurfing. You're just a low rank player lmao
---
In a team based game how is it sensible to limit queuing?
---
One of them is not like the other, one of them is a mental disease and it's not the sexual orientation we biologically evolved for.
---
I like it! But, there should be a way to counter them, like thatcher should be able to disable them, or they could be blown up, etc. in addition, the defender should get some sort of indicator that he has the bits attached to him
---
Welc
---
So youre either just slow or dont play this game lmao. Tking has been a problem in this game since its release, and this is not the way to fix it. If I still wanted to TK people without consequence why would I be suggesting that the person I TKed be allowed to remove me from the match? Seriously re-read this post, your arguments make 0 fucking sense. This has nothing to do with my aim, you sound like a typical siege nerd that calls everyone gold for having a legitimate issue with something in the game.
---
Are you really telling me it's okay to pick on new players and ruin their experience just because a player doesn't manage to perform well enough in casual/ranked?
---
True, Obama was involved in far more shady shit than Trump so far.  Would definitely fit a TC universe better.
---
The center pellet is the first line at the top. The middle is there. I should have edited in as that, and will do.
---
Exactly my thoughts, I just felt that relying entirely on that wasn’t a decent operator. He’s highly situational, and that’s IF they have a Mira. I couldn’t think of anything that would accompany that ability in a fitting way though. The trap idea is broken, but maybe something along those lines.
---
Where do your stats come from? Source?
---
i like how when you aimed the knife it missed and then you yeeted the fuck out of it and you got the kill
---
Mental disease have to be treated, not condoned and aplauded. That's how we ended up with Big Red and other SJW crap.
---
No map buff?
---
For one, I wouldn't talk about it unless I felt a relationship between two characters worked well or if their sexuality is a driving force for their actions. I really don't give a fuck if they are gay or straight I don't need to know unless its necessary. I just find it retarded that people buy into blizzard's low effort to including diversity. How people can't see it as a ploy to garner attention is beyond me.
---
Just rappel back in, it will fix it.
---
It all depends. Considering you haven’t tried everyone I’d lean towards getting the gold. But it all comes down to what you can afford.
---
"Oh no, he's hot!"
---
Then bitch at them about it. And TONS of other streamers already do do this. That's where I got the idea.
---
I think you didn't see the deleted comment
---
@lightskinmonte on instagram it will be there
---
Feel free to add me, LiberDBell. I'm 260 something usually Gold 1 can sometimes get into plat. 20 y/o.
---
Bro I'd wear it everywhere
---
They'd make you gamble for them, no worries.
---
It's not a real rat
---
dam, an elite i might actually get
---
The cluster bombs are being planted on your house as we speak
---
Sick spot!
---
Female soldiers, smh my head 🤷‍♂️
---
The foam could also work like it makes soft walls/floors bulletproof, and need explosives likes breaching charges, grenades and such to open a wall.. would work great as protecting bandit from iq and such while bandit tricking
---
P30L
---
In-fucking-deed. Cheatus Deletus
---
I have a bad feeling that this might be another alpha packs only uniform
---
That title pretty much sums up my entire R6 experience
---
for real tho
---
NERK NERK :D
---
Unfortunately I didn’t
---
Joke's on you! It's made out of concrete.
---
My best guess is it's for queue times and to increase the number of people in gold and silver, so that gold's don't queue against plats and silvers don't queue against gold so often.
---
I've noticed that on my screen they soon as they peaked I die, but on the kill cam it shows that they was peaked for alot longer and I have no idea which is true, if they had peaked for that long and my client hadn't caught up, or if the kill cam was wrong
---
you’ll never know what gun you will come across

Hello VovaDrakul, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/br320x/nøkks_identity/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
There was a clash glitch?
---
I'm going to play tonight kinda late. Hopefully either my buddy. You gonna be on. I'll add you when I get off
---
Still looks like a dumb box gun tho
---
Yeah its free in game money
---
Looking forward to Nøkk as a chibi!
---
Precisely. It feels like the servers are degrading and clientside gameplay is becoming more prevalent
---
Yeah, but in game where lesion, echo, jackal, alibi, pre nerfed lion, and finka are thing its not that bad
---
It's not a real rat.
---
I thought that was Hibana. I had to take a closer look to realize that her hair was clipping through her hat with some other things clipping through layers.
---
Did you use an AI to get rid of the background or did you cut her out yourself
---
The fourth line in the main fixes lists the shield rotation as a fix.
---
&gt; Fixed – Discrepancy between 1st and 3rd person perspectives when rotating with a shield.
---
Yeah I'll probably be on in a bit
---
 I feel like they should give us asset reworks for these map reworks too. Hareford base is just the most plain looking boring map in the game for example
---
I don't think you can blame Smurfs and de rankers for being copper lmao. It won't really matter that much if you play a bunch of ranked games because they aren't decreasing the mobility of ranked, just the starting point. That's kinda the point of MMR/ELO systems anyways.
---
FMG9 looks awful, MPX is awesome tho
---
the new season rewards, it says right there
---
Lol people like you are the reason activision and EA get away with this stuff. Ubisoft is testing to see how much they can get away with and you’re falling right into it
---
It's my reason to try hard extra this season.
---
I know, it's hard to tell which I should trust to learn from, and I'm sure it's not my connection I normally play at 9ping, 450mbs down and 200mbs up
---
Lol
---
Power of gravity assists chonks on the way down, but they have to fight it on the way up.
---
Rank charms. If you land on a rank (e.g. Gold IV, Platinum III, Copper IV) for a season by playing 10 placement matches, youll be eligible for a rank charm of that season. (e.g. Gold got Gold Charm, Platinum got Platinum Charm, Copper got Copper Charm) Of course you can gain much better charms by ranking up, thats why people wanna get to diamond.
---
So no update on the console look mechanic. Aw well.
