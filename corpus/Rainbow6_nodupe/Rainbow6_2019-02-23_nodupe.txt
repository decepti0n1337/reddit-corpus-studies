That's a glitch

---
---
Selfish
---
but the test servers are going to three weeks now
---
I just saw someone else post the same thing (but different video. I'm not saying anyone stole anything). It was the same window and with blitz. I wonder if it's just a blitz at this specific window thing?

i’ll explain it for them. you missed. plain and simple. git guud 
---
Tbh it should be the new ranked
---
Wow
---
ZA WARUDO - nice touch haha
---
This is untrue, most special ops are young, like under 25 years old young. While there are plenty of older guys they tend to be in admin positions and not go on missions.

27k for a headgear...

True but still soothing

Because he’s a Maestro main. 
---
I thought cav was way older than 29
---
How do you get the _____ main next to ur name
---
it would be a severe disadvantage. in a game with one shot headshots, accuracy is key and there is no accuracy with dual wielding 
---
WHAT?! :o 
---
S A V E D
---
Yeah I guess that’s true
---
reinstall 417.71

It is not just you. I can confirm that.

Steal the plug for his PS4

Didnt crossross report the Dane is a female? I hope they go with this. But something gives me the feeling  if it is a feeling theyll show more face with a woman. 
---
&gt; **The point is we just need him to think that our internet just fucked it and that we had nothing to do with it so that he would stop abusing us.**
---
At least it was fuze
---
Doke-Ka-Bae
---
I use flash hider as often as possible. It is great for burst
---
Teammates can troll/throw without shooting/damaging you though. Or if they're just a liability.
---
Could easily be airsoft
---
dont worry about it, people send threats just to wind people up. 
---
Ok

---
Someone else suggested that it lets the player be kicked if they destroy friendly gadgets or harm teammates which I think could work too
---
in the first pic they look cool and the second one they kinda looked lame.

"Serious".

White lines means tension but not dislike.

Seems Dokk has a problem with how the other Team Leaders handle things and thus, it might play into the supposed upcoming event (Dokkaebi's trinket signifying "The end of the world" in April).

Awesome! An insult that adds nothing to the convo! I love it.

You spelt buff wrong

i dont want that loading screen at all, burns my bloody eyes

Thanks

I love this

Also early 30s in combat sports at least is generally considered physical prime
---
Nice shot? 
---
What is wrong with Mozzie?
---
Surely you heard the loud-ass breathing?
---
Theres no point complaining. They can't undo it and its your own fault. Besides if you have an issue you have to go to ubisoft support. Nobody here can help

You need my IP to dedossed lmaoo 
---
Most people take the descriptions of the attachments at face value. In reality, the attachments are a lot more complex.
---
Muzzle break - -45% first shot recoil, -45% centering time
---
Flash hider - -37.5% first shot recoil, -30% centering time, 5% smaller diamond
---
Compensator - 17.75% smaller diamond
---
A smaller diamond means that each bullet has less recoil. Centering time means the time it takes for the gun to center to the point before you started shooting. 
---
A flash hider is the middle ground between the other 2 attachments.
---
Out of the 3 attachments, the compensator does the least to reduce muzzle flash. The muzzle break usually does enough to negate the negatives of the flash.
---
I use muzzle break on most guns. The only exception is compensators on guns with really bad left and right recoil(like Ela’s smg). A faster centering time helps lower the gun between shots and on automatic weapons that most often reduces recoil better than a flash hider or compensator. One semi auto weapons, the muzzle break is always the best choice of the three.
---
Wait till next week
---
Its because they are on dfferent servers. Can u not see their ping? lol 
---
There better be a mozzie thing in Rising.
---
I just hit 150 last weekend
---
He's the progidy
---
what is
---
they are on different servers guys, look at their ping, thats why they are showing as unranked, probably because they havent been ranked on the servers they are playing on 
---
Operation lose bastion
---
*I'm sorry*
---
I still don’t see anyone diamond in the lobby it doesn’t matter if they are diamond on a different server
---
Yeah the audio alarm gadgets were days mined back in para bellum
---
Lol I did she survived
---
What if they're just dicking around? Doing shit like closing up rotations you made, randomly shooting at shit during prep phase, situational stuff like locking someone in the cargo hold on plane, etc?
---
I tried my best to understand what made you go on this crusade, and you only came back with sass and insults. 
---
yea even glaz rushed in with scopes off they even got the smoke down...
---
You might be able to lock the PS4 off the router without it using an admin password, or maybe disconnect it and change the password so then you can use it because you know the password and just sign out whenever you leave it. 
---
Back in my day we used candles to bandit trick
---
i got you
---
render scaling is on 50 da whole time, T-AA-Sharpness on 100... but nothing rly changes when i set down this one... 
---
i got MSI afterburner too, how and what can i boost with it ? 
---
Nah we were winning 3-0 nothing and they booted the game 
---
New blitz buff.
---
Killer7 was like peak Suda. Weird and crazy enough to be super unique, yet still accessible and fun.
---
It’s more gored then dead
---
Probably check under operators instead of in the store
---
This is witch hunting pretty sure against sub reddit rules
---
Probs some random criminal like prison program
---
totally not justified.
---
No it's not. 
---
The entire implication of this idea is retarded
---
So, instead of finding another match, you're getting salty on Reddit. Casual is Casual mate. 
---
Hah, coming to comment this.
---
Thanks!
---
Cthulhu nooo!
---
I mean, if it's with friends or it's an accident...
---
This happens when you and someone click on an op at they same time but you don’t get it it sends you to a random op but still shows the op art.
---
Got to try this strat

The cav fire rate is a bug, not supposed to happen

I think a significant number of the gadgets in Rainbow could be argued as being war crimes

The top guy plays for empire, pengu plays for g2 who beat them in the finals at invitational. That is him lifting the trophy after they beat them.

That's why I stopped following those accounts

---
Incentives for joining midgame won't work because there's nothing for us to really care about. It'd have to be a serious buff to the rate you get alpha packs to matter, but then the communtiy would just feel cheated that they either have to choose between a quality game or alpha packs. 
---
It doesn't make any sense not to punish leavers. 
---
Are you missing an uh.... certain bulkier optic on our favorite operator? xD
---
Are you implying that Tachanka is not both God and the lord?
---
It did 😂
---
why would there be a punishment for leaving casual. that’s ridiculous. 
---
It's software from a soundcard if you have one or whatever audio solution you are using. If you search whatever you are using for audio you will likely find out exactly what it is then can turn it off.
---
You spelled your wrong
---
You could try logging into the router and blocking the ports Siege uses. This will be slightly different for each router.
---
They're listed under the Port-Forwarding section of this troubleshooting page: https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/Faqs/000023138/Connectivity-issues-in-Rainbow-6-Siege

Some scopes are like this
---
Suoer high eye relief can cause this look. 
---
It allows for clear vision outside the scope and inside but backs you up from the scope
---
Second question is ghost recon any good? Use to play the old ones and have wildlands in my library but never bothered to play.
---
Cool. 
---
It said that she and ash had a good relationship 
---
Nerfed Ela, bad Ela. RIP my baby Elzbieta.
---
My favorite ops are all CTU split so this is ki da hard...
---
Gotta say I'd most likely go with GIGN for the utility it offers on both sides 
---
I mean, sans abuse, I don't see anything wrong with a kid wanting to play games all the time. People have different hobbies.
---
You/the parent can take the console or pc away completely. It's that simple. He's still just a kid. If a 13 year old kid is a threat, you're being a pushover. Force the kid to go to his room. Force an intervention with a school counselor/licensed therapist. It's not rocket science.
---
My point is he only got two kills with the sausage and then praised it 
---
That's one hell of a lean
---
You're openly admitting to tking for no reason, and admit to purchasing 14 siege accounts, the only reason for doing so is because you've been banned nearly a dozen times. Yeah, at this point wow is the best I got

Because there's no reason not to and it drastically improves the quality of games. Nobody wants to play from the middle.
---
Ok?
---
I belive its an Nvidia sound thing, i had a similar problem, but mine was blue and on the other side of the screen :p look in ya Nvidia settings 
---
The issue sometimes is that people sometimes can’t just “invest in better internet” some of us live in the boondocks where internet is scarce and we work with what we have. Cable isn’t everywhere and isn’t cheap either FYI
---
It's a baby monitor in the form of a 6-inch blade. No one would expect the knife in the baby's room to be a microphone.
---
Fr just give him a good smacking and he’ll learn, that’s how I learned
---
Honestly the only thing I care about was why the fuck did you waste your hologram?
---
Ah
---
SAS
---
They should implement a forgive system. However, it is your fault for tking
---
Try knife-cancelling with clash, which is to say, when they knife your shield it pushes off to your right, so you turn to your left to prevent them from shooting your feet. When I started doing that with clash it really made her a much more powerful operator
---
The video is messed up, it cut the end.
---
Seriously. If it's such an issue, eliminate the source. Remove the problem, solve the underlying issue with the kid. 
---
Look the last guy used male prononus so how the fuck should I have known
---
smfw no g2 flair
---
Blitz DansGame
---
Why are all the weapons just a miss match of other CTUs? Also the ideas are awful, being able to stun someone for a long period of time in siege is uhhh, pretty powerful, just ask lion
---
How the fuck is Rook the same age as Finka and Cav
---
No to what? Shields are next to useless past melee and as someone who uses shield ops a lot, they lose a majority of melee engagements because of their slow melee speed. That and ubi making their already low crap potential even worse, ubi needs to make them look even remotely interesting.
---
 The fire rate
---
What did you uhhh... What'd ya do?
---
You should make a big wall with all the ops the formatted the same way they are in the menu
---
Thanks I got it with kaids shotgut 
---
If you are interested in the entire Jack Ryan universe, go by publish order and start with The Hunt for Red October. But Rainbow Six stands well on its own as well.
---
What song is in the fight scene?
---
It's a glitch that happens when you own the outbreak skin for Ash and change characters. Occasionally the outbreak symbol from the Ash outfit doesn't disappear after you switch off of her during selection. Doesn't matter what character it appears on, the person just must have selected Ash for a moment in the operator selection screen before making their final choice.
---
The titles are always the worst, too
---
Yeah
---
Why you get banned?
---
I remember getting a ton of long toms  and Turning the Germans to slag 
---
I installed mod menu coz I was too late to grind 
---
Base game now costs 20 dollars. Year 1 operators are currently on discount but will become even cheaper over time.
---
lol that was his fault for running out
---
Yep only problem is is that it's hard to find guys who aren't assholes to girls
---
Even if the team only has 2 players? Ace = 5 kills in a single round
---
I'm only counting the operator specific gadgets, to make things easier.
---
On the luison ?
---
Yeah, I'd agree with that. The rest of the operators had a more muted color set. More annoyed I had to order this pink just for these.
---
I was on probation. A misdemeanor d.u.i and possession got withheld... (really good lawyer named james may took care of me) then while on probation I got in a fight at the bar over a pool match[guy still owes me $200] he banked the 8 ball and tried to collect... here in the south. We call our shots
---
 Call bank... it's the 8 nonetheless. 
---
Yep. That was my first thought too. It will basically make accidental kills nearly impossible. You'll need to down them and hope they're cool enough to crawl on it.
---
*HYPERdansgame
---
😂😂i’m a terrible person because i understand logic. alright buddy maybe that’s enough internet for you today. i personally don’t leave games of casual because i only play casual when i’m alone. 
---
there’s also a HUGE difference between being purposefully toxic and leaving a game. if you don’t understand that then we can’t have a conversation about this. “why not just allow aimbots and teamkilling” i’m not even going to address this because that’s ridiculous 
---
there is backfill in casual for a reason. so when people leave, more people join. if i want to warm up my aim why should i have to sit there through longer rounds on unbalanced maps. if i join a game and the 4 stack on my team teamkills me the first round why should i have to sit there and continuously get teamkilled instead of finding a new match. 
---
back to how terrible of a person YOU are by pretending you know me and saying i’m a terrible person, try being a little mixed to people. casual does not matter. there is no benefit in staying in a game if you don’t want to. you lack some sense so i’m not responding to you anymore 
---
Those Ash Face posts are funny and uncommon
---
Not for long!
---
I just wrote everyone so yes, 5 kills
---
From what I've only seen one keyboard and mouse before on ps4. I dont know if its a bigger problem with ps4 and started playing around operation white noise so idk
---
stop reposting these. 
---
They're annoying to play against and shouldn't be in the game basically. I don't think there should be any operators in this game which fuck with its core aspect of holding angles and aiming for the head. 
---
Wait, I'm confused. Are the Year 1 operators dlc? If so, that explains the ludicrous price. Otherwise, did I just get completely ripped off?
---
No more school for me. I'm an arborist. Certified through ISA. I'll get back on my feet. 4 months. Is my projected scale. Then play medal here I come!!
---
thats why i always use it over floors and never over barricades.
---
Liar it's 30 min
---
GSG9. Gotta have my IQ, and Bandit's MP7 is pretty damn good.
---
Ah. A true recruit to the end, I see.  And what a noble end it is
---
GIGN for efficiency
---
Navy Seals for fun
---
First question: Yes. Those operators were released during 4 operations of 2016.
---
Second question: No. No edition comes with 20 starting operators now.
---
lol bye then. bet you’ll be back in a week. nobody cares if you quit especially if it’s for issues Ubisoft can not do anything about. 
---
I have 150+ hours on Xbox one and I haven't once come across either MnK or DDoSing...? Did you have just a terrible string of bad luck?
---
I dont know what that means... 
---
oh a joke about Gridlock’s size. how funny and original!! these posts are just annoying 
---
Its best you don’t ask...
---
Tama Impala Elephant 
---
Blocking it is just displacing the problem, not absolving it. There is something wrong with him, and honeslty it sounds like an authority figure needs to get involved, and needs to come down on him. 
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Okay. How much would it cost to get all the non-dlc operators from nothing but sledge, smoke, and caveira?
---
Umm... Montagne?
---
I installed a menu to give money and level because I was too lazy to grind level and money legitely
---
I stand by what I did.. I'd even do it again. I'd punch that man in the face to this day if I had the chance
---
 . 
---
not only is it a garbage meme but it’s a repost. nice 
---
wtf 
---
This boi kept tryna argue politics in my last post. Enjoy my OC everyone!
---
nice witch hunt 
---
Ok my top 5 is probably 
---
1. Oregon
---
2. Bank
---
3. Skyscraper
---
4. Coastline 
---
5. Border
---
(For ranked at least)
---
Which type of recruit are you going to cosplay?
---
This whole thread is embarrassing.
---
No you can’t
---
Wait so I'm sure that this is how is going but its them saying that to you right because I was thinking about it and thought it was just as funny if you meant you're just gonna dominate and go try hard now and teach them not to smurf
---
prepare yourselves for caveira but on attack. Or maybe his gadget would be to create fake footstep sounds? 
---
read one of the 10000 posts about this. there’s literally nothing Ubisoft can do. 
---
Facts
---
Hide the remote lol
---
He went to my most recent post and started talking shit so he wouldn’t have “the last word”
---
of course
---
posted thousands of times. 
---
Best is kinda subjective and comes to down to personal preference. It's interesting that you picked, as it's a map with only two viable sites and everybody and their mother knows how to attack the other two. There's very little flexibility and it can become stale after a while. That's just my two cents though. 
---
I dunno I never liked bank. It's too large and some of the sites are hard to enter but maybe that's just me. Oregon though is my favourite map as well and I hope it doesn't get reworked by ubi soon since it's one of the few actually fun maps left. 
---
not sure if this will help but something similar happened to me a while ago, instead I had a blue circle on screen which was a 'sound tracker' or something. I used either CTRL+SHIFT+C or CTRL+SHIFT+S to enable and disable it, forgot which one.
---
Again I'm not sure if it'll work for you but it might be worth a try if you haven't been able to fix it. 
---
Good luck.
---
This makes me sad. The game is special and unique, there is nothing to compare it with. But it has soo many issues, players who supported it since launch, with thousands of hours of playtime, leave it. Not bc the game is bad, bc there is nothing done against the problems a „minority.“  
---
But hey, when Bikini is frustrated he gets instant treatment 
---
I like how I posted the same thing months ago and they say how its not a bannable offense and shit.
---
Play non-stop Monty for a few months, like op, and then come back. You won‘t have a better k/d.
---
everyone knows this is a repost genius. 
---
Then why do I have 10 upvotes already??
---
That's a pretty good list. 
---
Mine would be
---
1) Coastline
---
2) Border
---
3) Villa
---
4) Oregon
---
5) Clubhouse
---
I think there was never a time where Argentina leaved the claim. In fact. In fact, "Tierra del fuego" has a secretary dedicated to this subject and i think that we used to have, until a cupel of years ago, national autorities for the islands (Even when Argentina recognize that they are under british administration).
---
You miss -9979 of the shots that you don't take.
---
I agree, Coast is personally my favourite map to play but for both maps all 4 maps are viable, have sufficient capability for soft destruction, whilst not being too good. Every map going forward should take notes from Coast and Border. 
---
have 2 friends that religiously play monty, they are insane with a pistol.
---
its a prawn ya fuckin seppo
---
Clubhouse might actually take my number 5 spot I don’t know how I forgot about it. Can you also explain how you enjoy villa? I despise villa 
---
I watch a lot of Pro League. So when it comes to playing the map I just sorta do whatever G2 has been doing and it usually works out. 
---
Haha I would love to have a ranked KD of 0.7 right now. That’s something that should be implemented for sure! Glad to see your KD is positive now :)
---
Then you just lied. You just said you got booted in ranked.
---
So, you salty, cause you lying about getting kicked in casual.
---
Fuck outta here.
---
They have to be with how hard they leanin.
---
wHaT hOw???
---
idek
---
Can I still get it? 
---
You should definitely open an Etsy shop. You'd make a killing.
---
There’s just a skill gap, not some sweating diamonds. plus leaning ain’t hard chief
---
Nice
---
OmG tHis IS SucH a SexIst PoSt!!!!!11!
---
69 hours a day, makes sense. But your parents really should do something about this and not let him act this way.
---
If u don’t like the aug use the shotgun
---
You talk too much and you don't understand the problem if you still suggest shield ops
---
I completely agree with your statement, I truely believe ash’s pick rate would drop if they reduce her speed, I also think a hit box rework would have been even better! 
---
But that being said I think if they solve the crouch lean spam problem I think we would see ash’s pick rate drop on its own as well. 
---
I also have to say I don’t see how people can enjoy this game if there sole purpose is just trying to frag, the satisfaction of out playing a ash main is so much more satisfying!
---
If i saw that team in ranked, immediate surrender.
---
Cool
---
How come I don't get opponents like dis?
---
Hahaha I feel like your talking about valk;) she has an op gadget in the cams but carries a pea shooter:)?
---
Hope you guys are able to find a solution :)
---
why don't you fuck off and go troll elsewhere if you don't like people talking about terrorist hunt go somepalce else I didn't ask you to be here like why comment bitch.
---
We have enough shields tbh, SI playlist showed majority of people's opinions towards shields. Blitz and Monty were in the top 5 most banned.
---
While fuze shield isn't used that much, we still don't need another shield.
---
Yeah, when a gay pride month comes around. 
---
Yeah casual is fucked. I’m a silver/gold player but in casual I’m constantly facing plats and diamonds. I hold my own it’d be nice to face more players closer to my skill level 
---
You're fighting a losing battle, friend.  Unless it's a hetero relationship it's just grasping at straws, I guess.
---
I do understand the problem. I understand the problem is mostly with monty and blitz because their gadgets are thier shields.
---
Fuze cant sprint at you. Fuze cant protect his whole body in a corner. He cant blind you and headshot you. He also has 2 other equally viable and good primary weapons. Hince why I based it off him because his shield isn't bullshit because it's not his gadget. People look at it as the whole of shields are broken but shield recruits and shield fuze play completely differently from monty and blitz and I've almost never struggled to kill them
---
Considering most special forces members don’t graduate training for a few years, stands to reason some will be at least mid twenties when they start out. Most of these or even all I guess are considered the best so that equates to years.
---
She isn't just desensitized, though. She relishes in it. Have you heard her interro lines?

aye, lmk when you start selling, that mozzie looks nice
---
My first online game was COD4, and we honestly weren't that bad. I mean we noob toobed to piss people off, but we weren't as bad as kids today, with team kills and mic spam and shit.
---
Yikes man.
---
Dude, I started in Chimera and am still at lvl 92. 140 hours of play. My friend got himself a second account in September and has 300 hours played on it already...

Definitely area denial.

? Was being serious?

Agreed.

*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** 79914022! ^(hug)

Who’s Kaid
---
I get around 100-130 losing and 250ish on winning. Games vary on length I'd give it a day. I believe it's dependant on how well you do in the game. Also renown boosters and challenges help get them up. Do the weeklies and dailies and you'll be cruising along
---
i love you, madly.

These cheese fries are gangsta

Some sort of Korean spirits/mythological creatures.

Omg iq is 40
---
Amen
---
I‘m pretty sure the Lord also has a soft spot for the weird french guns.
---
Yup, this is exactly right considering at their prime joining at most legal ages of 17-18 then completing all their schools then special forces selection they’d be at least mid twenties. Judging by u.s. sf selections, then being the best of the best will tack on years since you need experience. Very easy to see how one can be old 
---
Well now I can’t either
---
I once tried the japanese snipers too
---
I was refering to the text behind the question. About Cav.
---
How did you get that damage log?
---
So casual is not real?
---
Do you forget the core of the game? Ranked isn't the only gamemode .
---
Used the wrong shotty, yes im gatekeeping recruit rush
---
Wtf man lol gave me a good laugh at 3:42 in the morning
---
Chupinazo from velvet shell
---
I really really really hate recruit
---
Yeah it is fabians and joonas mum are tryhards :D 
---
I thought most of them were younger 
---
Nah, you’re just bad
---
She even has a signed jersy from him ^^ 
---
Yeah to my knowledge the pvp is training and terrorist hunt is like actual ops.
---
prolly wrong tho
---
No dude I shot him in the head 
---
Capitao isn't white and neither is Kaid
---
why did they go with another American operator? That could have easily been a Greek operator.
---
I think they'd have to entirely change the operators ability to make him even somewhat balanced to other ops. Standing still for too long on defense will get you killed. You need to be able to quickly adapt and reposition when compromised. Even when anchoring. 
---
people like you and him need to fuck off then
---
You missed. Helmets and visors don’t exist for bullets
---
Nah hes fine, maybe a slight buff to the aug would be okay though. If you want to give him another electroclaw i think it should only be able to cover one wall, otyerwise thats 6 walls you can eletrocute
---
I had the reflextriangle on his head 
---
Or maybe I felt like shit and drew something to feel better? 
---
Bullets hit at the top of the triangle. You shot over his head
---
Figured that out now thx
---
I do.
---
Why can't he just play casual if he doesn't want to sweat?
---
Sounds like you're a console player in that case just break the disc
---
Not realistic. 
---
They all should be diamonds. :D
---
"He's not in the kitchen, stop looking there."
---
Really good job man.... The amount of times I've died to bad callouts.
---
An actual bot
---
So first it was gingerbread, now unicorns?
---
Hmmmmmmm *big thonks*
---
Tbh, if I refer to asians in Germany and look on live TV from Japan (or commercials) I dont see any similiarity between them and hibana ... :/
---
Nah it's pengu so he must just be an asshole. Did you know pengu eats babies?
---
Map knowledge all day long. A decent aim can only get you so far.
---
this, most esports title top-top competition are so little people, they know each other by irl names. If you go to other big titles while on stage the picture of fierce rivals is painted, in reality they all hangout with eachother.

Any on the seas server?
---
At first i was hyped about getting an aloha pack with 2%
---
why couldnt her in game portrait look like that...
---
"Siege on the next console gen?" by Rogue-9
---
I think the reason we find this short so insightful and introspective is because we really don’t know much about the Ops outside of their biggest accomplishments in their fields. This shows a background to Thatcher as basically a civilian which gives a much more personal side to his character. 
---
In overwatch, all the heroes’ shorts show some sort of backstory off the bat, or if they don’t, you can see what kind of person the hero is because OW heroes are easily identifiable by how they act on purpose. Tracer, for example, is cheery and giggly, which is an easily identifiable trait in her character. The characters in siege, however, are there for their mission and are almost no nonsense, save for a few (looking at you, Mozzie). This makes their biggest differences in their appearance, voice, and the gadget they bring to the table.
---
So in the end, a short like Hammer and Scalpel shows us a really interesting view into this world that hasn’t been explored in this game yet, and one that I’m very excited to see more of, no matter what Operators it is about
---
All are equally important 
---
We'll see...they still havent patched the killfeed icon that they use in China, (and I hope I didnt get anything wrong) despite them saying they want to fix that issue
---
A thirteen year old should not have the power to hold his family hostage
---
Wouldn't be surprised if these people genuinely believe that. Would not surprise me one bit.
---
The fuck you say to me little shot?!
---
Eh, misunderstandings sort of allow these situations to happen. I doubt anyone had any ill will when this occurred. It's better to try and fail than to not try at all. 
---
Which Hibana? Live Hibana doesn't even look Asian(Japanese to be specific) where as TTS version does.
---
Why? 
---
Dm me , id gladly buy these two . I hope your selling looks amazing 
---
Not sure what version of OBS you're using, obvious first step would be to make sure youre using the most recent.
---
I found a video saying that when you add the "game capture" option, it will bring up an options dialogue (same dialogue where you choose your game). If there is an anti-cheat hook option or something similar, tick that. Apparently some games anti cheat software checks OBS as a cheat software (because why not) 
---
Otherwise, see if monitor or screen capture works ?
---
it says 1997 -2017 .... like literaly just the numbers that are under it, its a normal Barcode, you cant get any informations out of it outside of numbers, like you could with QR-codes.
---
Yeah but not even a full blown weeb is **this** pale
---
Decent weapons though. Vigil can be a good roamer. 
---
reporting does nothing, ubisoft will only ever do something if you put in a ticket. 
---
Ik lol thats why I put it it that format 
---
Black screen in OBS 
---
Game capture - specific window (rainbow six siege)
---
This video is fake, secure area does not exist.
---
Pray to Satan and whatever god resides over ubi. 
---
Then you got an ugly legendary xD
---
&gt;* Setting graphics to minimum (even though I already had stable 60 FPS)
---
Doesn't help. As long as you have enough graphics memory, you can even run it at high. You start lagging when you cross your GPU memory. Your ideal scenario is to use 100% gpu to ensure 0 bottlenecking (actually, do this and check if you suffer bottlenecking). So lower your texture quality only if you have heating issues.
---
&gt;* Setting R6's priority to "High" in the Task Manager
---
Big bad idea. This supposedly gives you more fps but in reality can cause stuttering. Many of us found that setting it to low allows windows to do it's thing without siege interfering with it, so it stays the f**k out of windows way. Set it to low. I do too. Helped solve my mouse stutters.
---
You can't see if someone's banned unless it's a BattleEye ban, which is for cheaters not inappropriate speech
---
Nothing like some good ol' live fire training exercises.
---
I like to think of it as TacOps is actually moonlighting as a mercenary contractor and we're all just his mercs when we're not terrorist hunting.
---
No
---
I don't know how what you mean by taking it seriously. I'm trying to play a normal game and these tryhard idiots who died in 30 seconds by rushing vote Kick me either because I can't clutch a 1v4 or because they're no life basement dwellers and can't wait a single minute for the match to be over. 
---
I'm using: 22.0.2
---
I can use monitor and screen capture, and also game capture with other games like Apex without any problems.
---
&gt;They honestly should be banned completely from market since psn made it clear they don’t want m&amp;k use on their console

I only have one question. Were you on the TTS ( technical test servers.)
---
because it's not real and the artist sucks
---
Look at her skin color, then look at her hands.
---
Can't even blame her, Cav is insanely scary.
---
Eyebrows on fleek, dafuq
---
Idk maybe im the problem. But i really like her operator pic face but not the in game one.
---
10 years ago, no one would have imagined what game this was.
---
Especially Tom Clancy.
---
We're not speaking on behalf of Asian women we're saying she doesn't look like any Asian women we've ever seen.
---
If you want to dispute that show some dam pics.
---
I dont think ill ever understand what i do wrong... if i were to do that id run in and get headshotted instantly 
---
*Slow your roll Brony.*
---
Smh all the other operators bulli me all the time and they wonder why my behaviour is so sociopathic?
---
Okay there Thatcher...
---
Tachanka\`s age is irrelevant, gods live forever 
---
Well youre not wrong on the tts build... But I think the live one is caused by shadows
---
Thanks.
---
That one
---
 Thanks.
---
All, and more.
---
3/17/2018 according to xbox live 🤔
---
Thanks! I play high too and it’s never High people who try to kick you. it’s, for real, the guys hunting challenges for a reward ASAP and when they die and don’t win get toxic and sweaty and hate everyone who is like trying to play slow and tactical because that’s not their style. But when they get killed They write „ why u tryharding ... blablabla“ you Know what Iam sayin
---
If you play SnD mode on CoD you also don't respawn during the round.
---
That's how Ash became an official operator
---
[New Hibana looks like this.](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2013/9/13/1379071935264/Blobfish-voted-worlds-ugl-008.jpg?width=700&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5c1476122a2dd23611610612db2421f1)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_29 lil bit of reading, but it says even early Rome recognized leap days
---
enough is enough
---
**February 29**
---
February 29, also known as leap day or leap year day, is a date added to most years that are divisible by 4, such as 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, and 2028. A leap day is added in various solar calendars (calendars based on the Earth's revolution around the Sun), including the Gregorian calendar standard in most of the world. Lunisolar calendars (whose months are based on the phases of the Moon) instead add a leap or intercalary month.In the Gregorian calendar, years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900 did not contain a leap day; neither will 2100, 2200, and 2300.

---
I think it works with any key
---
Probably one of the most satisfying ways to kill someone. 
---
None of that would improve the game, nor is any of it relevant to the post. 
---
Lol this is so stupid haha
---
I felt guilty
---
Gave my physical disc to a friend and bought the online version.
---
Just wait to see the new caveira...
---
To add to what Danila said, a laser sight will also make your hip  fire spread tighter.
---
No, I don't think that would be a very good idea.
---
The fact that all attackers have access to an ACOG, but only a few operators have access to one, introduced the meta of attackers having an easy time holding angles (which is a problem for retakes)
---
The BOSG is a really powerful weapon on close range and pretty decent long range if you can connect the head shot. Putting an ACOG on that would make it a completely broken weapon.
---
The other problem is, that Dokkaebi doesn't necessarily have to enter the objective/get close to it, to get full use of her abilities.
---
If any roamer dies she can hack their phones and call the attackers while holding pixel peeks with her BOSG ACOG, making flanks almost impossible.
---
Console clips are just something else.
---
Your source?
---
The most known special forces guy in my country, Trond Bolle (he is known because his story got leaked after he got killed), was over forty when an ied got him. That is not an admin position.
---
Most, if not all, special forces educations are long, and the selection is typically from already experienced soldiers. So, that they start their selection process at 25 is not strange. But then, they have several years before they can go into actual field ops.
---
And then there is still years until they are good enough to join a group like rainbow.
---
Wow solo to supreme. Rare breed. 
---
It works best to trade out. Plus Echo could be on his drone, so only two guns available in Armory. We tried it and it worked so...
---
Question, how do you get those ____ Main tags next to your name?
---
A nomad among recruits
---
That is because they don't want Thatcher to be fresh off the selection and education process. I would guess most start selection in the mid twenties. But that is the start date, not the age you are an experienced veteran at peak performance.
---
ACOG bosg sounds pretty cool
---
devastating
---
Is that an LMG tho, that's the real question
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
It's annoying as fuck putting reinforcements up, and having it switch off. It should remain on when activated...
---
Might not be a good idea to occupy an important role like thermite, especially if someone on the team is better.
---
He can’t, he’s already dead
---
Same reason why the US doesn't call the M3 just AR-15. Designates a specific build.
---
A personal favourite of mine on consulate is being on 2F and roaming to 1F with Valk cams in the room, then just playing budget pulse (teammates May be dead when I'm needed for plant denial so they can ping when they plant) 
---
I would not rely on him uploading like ever... if you "take a break" once, come back and then leave shorty again shortly after, it's pretty obvious that it didn't work out
---
Triple dot on the top right hand corner when in the main subreddit mate you’ll find « tags » and you’re good to go 😉
---
Let me in LET ME IIIIIIIIIN
---
Maybe they count only his birthdays so in reality he's about 200 years old as he gains one year of age every four years. That would make him the oldest operator in Siege, if I'm not mistaken. 
---
i play on 1900 11/13 fite me 
---
Thank you börther
---
I wish this was done on bomb
---
Dokk looks 20 
---
Hahahahaha I hope this turns out to be canon 
---
I can unsee it, because it's fucking retarded and bares no resemblance.
---
3 and 2 speed defenders can't have acogs in any gun. Even in a slug shotgun. It's a rule set by the balancing team
---
To be fair, it’s much easier to punish stuff like that when you have video evidence of it like with the streamer. Many reports for voice chat abuse are gonna fall on deaf ears because they are basically basing it entirely on the words of the player(s) who sent the report. 
---
Damn, Hibana-banana looks malnourished. I hope her face can be improved D:
---
People on this sub want to think they're like the second fucking coming of Einstein.

---
I can agree that some ops like Ela and Dokk are obviously rather on the more fantasy side of things, but the majority of the year 2 and 3 ops are rocking actual CTU related fatigues and body armour for the most part.
---
Im use nvidia experience software. Works good
---
All she needs is a darker skin tone (japanese-style darker I mean) and a little bit happier face.
---
Not my proudest fap
---
Allí know is it along with the rest of his body is NOT in bed with me and that's a problem.
---
Even if you send your clips to Ubisoft, no action is taken. Speaking from personal experiences as well as that of others. 
---
Wow, I'll try that 
---
TIME FOR SOME SERIOUS PROTECTION!! 
---
Well that's too bad I liked the old one a lot more.
---
This is not acceptable. It’s just irrelevant to her new portrait picture.
---
It's mentioned in the patch notes, stop misinforming.
---
Me too it’s such a pain and feels way too long 
---
The prequel to what happens to his crotch in Outbreak. 
---

---
Like a faithful smile?
---
why the downvote, really?
---
She watched too many animes recently...
---
I hope they keep him, although you’re right about him getting stronger. Me and my buddies have noticed that you almost always need a thatcher to get rid of all the gadgets, electric walls, and traps that are constantly added with each new operator. 
---
I think his ability is in a good place, but buff the Aug just a bit.
---
I would think a new op should have that tech but that would be a huge hit for Thatcher and the only way I can see them (Ubi) balancing it is to buff Twitch giving her back all those taser shots she lost a few years back. I'm just spit ballin here btw.
---
“No lag there.” His British accents makes it sound like “that”. 
---
Got a teardrop 
---
As if she couldn't hold a pixel peek with her EBR far more effectively anyway, with less recoil and about the same damage mid-long range, 20 shots instead of 2.
---
If you want to make the argument that the BOSG would be too strong with an ACOG it's probably more so because it could make landing 2 consecutive bodyshots long range easier with it, headshot really wouldn't be the issue here.
---
ONE REALLY BIG FOOKIN' HOLE COMING RIGHT UP!
---
That’s like the best legendary.
---
Oh, well that sucks then. I suppose part of it is probably the amount of people that watch the streamer then, so it’s good publicity to ban those people. I’ve heard Ubisoft is pretty hesitant to ban based on clips also, because they can be edited, even if it is unlikely. Again, it sucks and there’s probably better ways to do it, but it’s the safest option as of now. 
---
Old Hibana &gt; New Hibana

Her hitbox is fine, her head hitbox is fucking annoying tho. Popped that bitch in the head yesterday, and it didn't count it. Ubi is revamping all the operator models that dont need revamping. (Hibana, CLAPitao, etc.) But an easy opportunity to fix something the community has been bitching about forever, and they dont take it? Smh
---
Someone else suggested (or it may have been me, I can’t remember) that if a person is reported in one match of over a certain point of time, then they have the kick option outlined for them.
---
So if a person is being abusive over the mic and three or four of his teammates report him during that match, then the option is automatically unlocked for them. Now,I do not know if Ubisoft can track report spamming like Overwatch can, but hopefully that could work.

What sucks is that gender is truly a determining factor in how much support you get against toxicity. I mean, take a look at this sub and how quick they are to spring into action the moment a female posts about being a victim of toxicity. I have 3220 hours in Siege but I have yet to touch the game once Apex Legends launched. The community sickens me to the point where I no longer feel comfortable playing, especially since there is very little progress and changes from beta.

I mean I like it because it's something a little different from the core game. Instead of trying really hard to frag and play objective I can now just mess around and parkour and have a small victory. It's fun because it's a thrill ride for me.

It's a huge buff for defenders, and is one of the reasons I think Finka should be re-focused as a healer as opposed to a "buffer." Remove the recoil/ADS/Reload benefits and improve the healing aspect. Her remote revives should heal at 50 and anybody already up below 75 should shoot straight to 75 health. You can even remove one of her charges, but Finka IMO should just be a team medic, especially after these changes.

Population is already an issue on the TTS and Australian servers are famous for having population issues in most games. Australian TTS server would result in insane queue times for probably not a lot more feedback.

I asked the same and got answered so I must pay back.

I see the people trolling fuze coming already
---
Okay but that's not a problem with matchmaking. The players left. That's on the salty player base that can't stay in casual. Not matchmaking.
---
For the sake of the game time doesn't pass the same way it does outside the game (our life). Maybe they add a couple years to the story in 5-10 years, but that's it.

Since it comes with her new face it's probably coming out with Burnt Horizon live release

##NO RUNNING IN THE HALLS

Ahhh I feel what you mean now. "Just to see if I can" kinda thing. I totally get it playing this game since 2016, it can get a bit boring and skull-numbing. 
---
Ying the entire OBJ and then walk in taking 2-3 with you before you die. On the small, close rooms of hostage that’ll be pretty easy. 
---
I didn’t even know maverick was a 3 speed lol thought he was 2

Macie said he hung out with him at the invitational and that he is doing well, has a beard now.

No woman wants an ugly neckbeard as a sexual partner unless there's money involved, whether they're young or old.

I got every pass, 1,2,3,4, and it never said it to me. Goobisoft, WTF?
---
Ash isn't just used for rushing.
---
She is used as an entry fragger, that uses her gadget to assist in pushing and getting kills. Mavericks blowtorch is used in the same way. 
---
In the semi-final between G2 &amp; REC, Kanto showed how you can use Maverick in a very similar way to Ash while still entry fragging. 
---
Yes
---
they had doc? I still doubt that I made exactly the same amount of dmg than the doc healed him... 
---
No because wind bastion ends March 7th.
---
You don't get it, he has already selebrated 49 time his bday, so he is almost 200...
---
TTS, and it will arrive soon so be happy!
---
Prophet too
---
I laughed harder then id like to admit
---
Where is there anything about Doc in the top right?
---
Prophet and Twitch
---
March 8th as Wind Bastion ends on March 7th and the new operation always comes the day after the last event.

What about SR-25 ads time on TTS?

The new style actually looks asian so I like it a lot more. 
---
Wow, if the TTS has faster ADS, I hope they keep it in the live game. I currently run it with angled because the ADS is painfully slow. Of course I sacrifice recoil as a result.
---
Did you get an extra 600?
---
Good point
---
I can understand that to a non-Brit this is confusing, I also agree that both "that" and "then" make sense. 
---
But this isn't a matter of opinion, he says the word "that" and it's annoying that I had to explain this twice to people that clearly haven't lived in England for as long as I have and they still think I'm bullshitting. 
---
Wrong.

This is just an Idea I came up with, when I hear Secret Service Operator coming to the Defender Side next Season.
---
Well sorry for your troubles then, have a good day mate.
---
Honestly, some of the historical ones look really good but I lore inspored Elite skins fit the game way better in my opinion. One of the best looking ones imo is Thatcher's, being a mix between the two.

👍

No referring to just this specific comment. Look at his other replies.

Not to shit on you, but the aim difference between console and PC is crazy and I'm honestly surprised that you got to Plat with what I hear that many people play with m&amp;k, so congrats man.

There is a hole made by maverick in the right, try to see it 
---
&gt; On the other hand, that opinion itself that you can simply reduce women to their looks is extremely misogynistic. 
---
You're 19 so I think you have some growing to do on this matter in terms of developing logic, but just because someone posts an opinion about a woman's age/looks doesn't mean that they're "reducing women to their looks." It's a comment on age and a woman's looks, that's it-- it's not some profound statement against women like you're making it out to be in your mind.
---
You're making it into "misogyny" because I posted a valid opinion about how women in their 30's are past their sexual prime. Get real my man.

theres literally a maverick hole on the right side

Maverick hole, on the right side? :)

I think it happened to me as well once, but the next round it was no longer the case. Odd bug at any rate as I have no idea as to what triggered it to happen in the first place

Team killers in ranked? Squad up with friends for a full team.

Yeah your right

i think at least i have 3 days to collect 10 k more renown

I second that statement. Really after you put the time in, your game sense starts to kick in so to speak and you'll just instinctively know what to do.
---
You, sir, have made my day.
---
Map knowledge, half the game is holding angles and aim doesn’t factor too heavily in that. Knowing the best angle to hold in any situation does.
---
I've tried that and removing all attachments and skins/charms while standing on the prisma and somehow I still get killed
---
So make it check if you're in a party. If not forgive. The odds of being matched with a mate without being in a party is so low it makes no difference to 99.99% of players, it's only slightly possible in higher ranks but i think thats a pretty good trade off.

There was no reason for you to post this. Ubisoft is aware of the toxicity and there's the reflected damage feature coming soon.
---
I played R6S for around 300 hours so i can say there is 3 ways to learn and play:
---
Learing:
---
1) Play normal terrorist hunt. Try new oparetors and try every map at least 3 times. When you start likeing an oparetor start usin him/her. If you don't like his/her gadget than pick some one else with the same gun. An example: If you like Fuze's Ak but you don't like cluster charges than use Nomad.
---
2) Play with friends on custem matches. If you have even 1 more friend who playes R6S you can play with him/her so he/she can teach you how things work or show you new tactics. I would advise you to play with at least 3 friends if you can. 
---
3) Finish every situation on realistick. After i did this i knew every oparetor's ( in the situations ) guns recoil and fire rate. Beliave me this helps you so much.
---
Playing:
---
1) Play intel oparetors like Maestro, Valkery, Legion ( he counts ) or Echo. This will mostly put you in 1 v 2 situation if youre team is not that good. I think you should use Maestro or Valkery at firs to master secondery wepons and get a good recoil control. By the way you can use Twitch, Iq or Lion on attack as intel oparetors.
---
2) Use a shotgun on defence and a good damage making / hige rate of fire rifle so you can learn maps and don't die. If you go with a damage making rifle you will learn how to aim, if you use a hige rate of fire rifle you will learn recoil control. Useing shotgun on defence will help you on making traps or making / finding new peek spots.
---
3) I would advise you to use:
---
Maestro, Rook, Mute on defence.
---
Twitch, Nomad, Montagne on attack.
---
Maestro: He is a 3 armor oparetor, with an acoged lmg and he has cameras that can shoot AND he maybe can't turn the cameras when he dies but if you make them stay right they can be usefull after death.
---
Rook: He is a 3 armor oparetor with armor plates that can make everyone 3 armor to 4 armor / 2 armor to 3 armor. You have to remamber that a headshot is still a one tap. Rook has a good shotgun and a acoged smg AND a nice revolver. You can practise and learn everything with him and be helpfull when you die.
---
Mute: He is a 2 armor oparetor and he is good with the same reasons with Rook. His jammers are the best and he ahs a shotgun / smg as primery and a smg secondery.
---
Twitch: She is a 2 armor oparetor and her drone can be used to destroy equipment or if you want to you can zap defenders to get assist points. She is the only oparetor that can use a rifle / lmg, a shotgun AND a long range rifle at the same time. She also has the classic French revolver.
---
Nomad: She is a 2 armor oparetor with an obsession with traps. She has a claymore and "air jabs" that make you jump back. Her Ak is pretty good about recoil so you can get used to that and she has the Han Solo pistol. You can consentrate on one position knowing that you are safe from roamers. This will help you on youre refleckses.
---
Montagne: He is a 3 armor oparetor with an extandable shield and he can use the Freanch revolver. You can help youre team mates and learn how to hard breach. When using him on bomb get the defuser if you can. Use his gas to help Glaz if you have one in youre team. Then plant.
---
I know that this is long but it is a full advice.

They will be Year Pass exclusive items for 8 New Operators released during Year 4.

Ok but the error sign tho

I think he’s parodying the complaints about mnk on console.

You don’t think Ella could be male? I don’t know why you’d want to limit cosplay like that, not sure if I can agree

Lesion is the most fun, but it depends on your playstyle
---
gottem 👌
---
Lmao I thought that looked odly familiar 
---
Actually did not know this, appreciated
---
Yes I'm so sick of their massive disadvantage
---
Other than being the only full body shield operators in the game, yeah, nothing alike.
---
I thought OG ops were free now?
---
Wtf just happened
---
*big pp
---
I see more golds lean and crouch spam then I see diamonds. I also see way more golds pulling out strats and droning like crazy then I do diamonds in casual. I'm pretty sure most diamonds are like me in casual, our extent of trying in casual is just shooting people in the face.
---
And the Italians onward have much cooler pictures in their bios.
---
that’d explain all the times i’ve gotten fucked by her in game 
---
Spawnpeeking is taking advantage of a mistake. Pro League players can make mistakes.
---
I don’t see your logic.
---
The board says they enjoy hunting each other.
---
This could actually be a cool operator desogn
---
It's very easy to record on console if you're wondering.
---
Her live model looks horrible, she doesn't look Japanese, and instead looks like Adam Lambert. 
---
Jesus everyone on this sub is so nit picky.
---
No. Pretty much every spawn on a competitive map has cover, besides one or two on Chalet.
---
I like that we have a mixture of historical and “lore” Elites. Hopefully Ubi keeps that trend going. 
---
Cab and echo apparently respect each other.
---
That’s a pretty cool note actually. Is there a link to a picture of the board on this subreddit or is this from everyone’s personal analysis? 
---
Base operators where only free during year 3, When the game Editions changed for Year 4 the base operators reverted back to the old unlock system.
---
Yeah but it’s not going to solve toxic 4 stacks. A solo queue separate from a team queue could solve this and probably wouldn’t significantly increase wait times, except for 4 stacks. 
---
Wtf lol, he new portrait looks really good, what a contrast
---
Placebo effect

i’m glad you noticed 🗿

Not for everyone though because Vigil's birth year is 1984 and his age in game is listed as 34. If only they could be consistent.

---
I follow the pro strats on defense.
---
Bandit, Mira, Jäger, one acog/smoke, last flex.
---
Cash: one Mira in cash facing CCTV, rotation hole as well. Next one on stairs facing cash and watching workshop. Acog watches garage entrance using pixel peek on the rafters. Bedroom hole important, bathroom toearfs workshop makes for a good angle but a kill box. Attack, depending on op, I either go for bedroom site push, or breach main wall, or if I play finka or buck, I go for garage push.
---
Arsenal: one Mira window either in arsenal watching blue or church watching blue. Next one also in church, watching double door stairs. Rotation in front of church main entrance in the hallway. One acog dude must watch dirt tunnel and keep rotating 180 to watch blue, while hiding behind the cupboard in front of AKs and RPG wall. Smoke below the kitchen hatch, uses impact trick to take out Hibana charges. On attack, Hibana must breach kitchen and bar, and Mav must breach supply hatch to blue hallway. Need one smoke op, preferably cap, and a cancer op like jackal or Dok. One other must push dirt and distract while others push blue.
---
These are of course, jists of  my strats, not much different from pro league. You need to work out your own.
---
u/DefuzesAnimal is a brilliant dude who posts 5 man strats on this sub. I suggest searching "5 man strat". You'll find it all.
---
Maybe high Elo Plats against low Elo Diamonds 
---
Cuz fuck balancing rite

I think you’re 100% right

I was thinking it was there just so Ubi could say they care about toxicity on console but I was hoping that someone here could give me some evidence that I'm just biased.

I was hoping a Mexican / South American prison since we're getting a Mexican/Peruvian season but it's a rework of Kafe/Kanal instead..

They’d probably need to add some plywood and make it look like it’s been renovated or something to give flow paths and utility for attackers.

I don't know of any consoles with a #3 button

This is honestly what it feels like. Especially on console.

Pro league players generally don't care about ranked, hell I played against retro and he was a plat

It was more a reference between the problem ash and do have with each other, ash is too serious and dok is too young/immature for ash.
---
Thats you trying to find an excuse. Peekers advantage in the way you think of it doesn't exist. Higher ping does not increase the advantage of the person peeking. That is a fundamental misunderstanding of how netcode works.
---
I think Fuze takes it by a bit, but I agree Finka is pretty bad too. The health boost is usually not that worth (due to OHKO headshots and all) and she's in a weird place (in terms of pro at least) due to the recoil often being more harmful than helpful
---
That's number of stims mate. Check the vault prompt.
---
Yea it does and that is why i was on the right side of door frame so my arm would not be as exposed. The killcam seems to show me get shot at and my shield does nothing.
---
But wouldn’t you agree this is the best possible option?   
---
Ubisoft can’t just remove him because it would be a nightmare to reimburse people who I bought him and cosmetics with real money.

You have to go into the settings and turn Vsync on/off, which ever isn’t the default. That will fix your problem 
---
That would be crazy op.  Imagine going from 10 drones to 15!   In higher levels, drones are a crazy piece of utility, the kind you live and die by.   Giving attackers a third drone would be a nightmare for defenders.
---
Stop posting this nobody cares about how u got killed as blitz and now crying

I'm just saying it's typical of the Rainbow community to trash talk afterwards lol
---
So can I not hate map design? But I do enjoy Villa, Plane, and Sky Scraper. I just don't like most of the maps in the game because the layout of them is absolutely horrible. Maybe that's harsh for some maps but the layout makes no sense on most of them. I enjoy the game occasionally most of the time  I get bullshitted in to a match where I face against diamonds when I'm a gold. But I love the game for what it is but it needs a lot of improvements.

I've found more success actually reporting that person for Unsportsmanlike Behavior or whatever on the profile report.

Also with gridlock! There is a skin called gridlock

The lore to their elite
---
That's what I am saying! Like i got shot and it should have done some damage, but from the killcams point of view it shows that my shield is literally useless?

Other operators: hardship and lots of work

Bandit: drugs

Shields are glitched currently, Ubi is fixing it in the coming patches
---
The view of your death shows the tracers hitting your shoulder. The kill cam shows them hitting your shield. I've learned not to trust the killcam. It just pisses me off.

Ya, it looks incredibly trash. Nothing like the smooth criminal we all know and love.

If he messages you you can report him via playstation network (xbox probably has a similar option) and Sony isnt really tolerant about this.

Got team killed and after that he wrote me some disgusting stuff for no reason. 
---
I usually don't report people but this time it was to much, few days later I got a message that my report was successfull which means hes banned for at least a week I think. This goes higher till perm ban.

There isnt even sound in this gif and i can still hear it

I mean it’s better than IQ’s but come on this is just odd I’d rather just put on one of his 45k renown bundles then spend 15 bucks on this shit
---
His smoke bolt right now is the best part of his kit, until his reworked firebolt comes out for the new season. Right now his smokes ignore Jager so thats huge by itself but it's also the fast that you can place it exactly where you aim so you also have more control. 
---
Your client shows bullets as if they hit it but they'll go straight through --- unless, as I previously stated, he sees the shield in the same position by a slim chance.

I managed to fake being a hologram twice in one game in the same place and that's it. I laugh when people try to trick me though. Can't trick an alibi main.

This might be one of the stupidest things I’ve ever seen on this sub.  And that’s saying a lot.

Ela was released with Blood Orchid and Zofia was released with White Noise. B/c of Operation Health in Y2S2, no operators were released in that time, so the ops that were going to be released for pushed back. So in Y2S3 &amp; Y2S4 we got 3 ops instead of 2. That's why they don't have the same colored '6'
---
Love to see some WD2 references like Marcus’s RC drone being able to be hacked by mozzie and it behaves the same way as it does in WD2 (minus the explosives) or his actual drone. Hell even wrench’s mask would be nice
---
no need to control automatic weapons! Dump a frag into a trench, then use one hand and let the recoil do the aiming for you to clear the trench!
---
Yeah, "walking away" that's cowardice, buddy. As soon as I made a point, you just stopped responding. I'll leave now, and hopefully you'll learn not to randomly attack people who know how to stand up for themselves. Don't dishonor the memory of my Cats again, they had a better life than you are having right now.
---
wait what? What was the joke?
---
Angled grip would be op on alotta weapons
---
This is General Hummel. Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!
---
This is definitely not how I imaged Bandit to look like....
---
I loved that AR game
---
I’ve wanted this since the game came out having been there many times before, but it could be hard due to the concrete nature of the prison, though it is a lot weaker now in many areas, and it even was somewhat weak in the 60s. Size might also pose a challenge, but there are plenty of areas with smaller rooms around the main cellhouse like the administration wing, hospital, and dining hall. They could have it take place one of the industries buildings instead. 
---
I'd go standard and see if you like it no sense in going all in without knowing, it's leaning curve isn't too bad it isn't like trying to get into LOL or Cs:go , though I have been playing since the beta so you might wanna ask someone who started recently.
---
I agree his aim was good enough for that to be the case, but when you watch before killcam I receive damage that was being dealt at the timing during the killcam where he was shooting my shield head on. At least that is the impression I got unless the killcams are so broken that are showing perspectives of gameplay that doesn’t exist.

W...wait a second...

Is that...Ace Visconti?

I found a pile of dust in my laptop's fan assembly when I disassembled it.

Found out the cause of the overheating.

Welp, Ash and Rook got leaked. We getting OG packs for those who only got helmets. This gonna be great.

Looks good, but now when I look closer, your hair looks like the scrubby think on the shower wall. No hate, but I can’t unsee it.

No they aren't, they are just uniforms. What are you talking about?
---
Bandit's undercover biker background specifically is referenced in his base uniform.
---
Picture is slightly mis leading because this is the OLD Twitch model. Ubisoft re did her entire character model to look more clean around Year 1 Season 4 I believe.
---
Evidently Thatcher.
---
Probably also Sledge. Imagine Crocodile Dundee, but instead of an Aussie with a dagger, it's an angry Scotsman with a giant fuckoff sledgehammer.
---
YES
---
Agree to agree to agree to agree to agree

More stable than i thought it would be lol

&gt; try not to be a coach on the loose

This is so far over my head Elon Musk's interested in it, what does that mean? I'm usually alright at weird colloquialisms but that's a banger
---
It isn't bad but somethimes i have have a lagg spike and my ping drops from 9 to 1570(that being the highest i noticed) 
---
That's interesting thank you
---
I need that
---
You trully are a Doc Main &lt;3.  Thanks for the heal and not spawn peeking me ;)
---
Anyone else verbally speak the words "Oof" three times?
---
FPS is super low in T hunt. Probably what he means.
---
I like the TTS more, but here eyes and neck need to be...changed 
---
Did you calculate that from the year it is ingame?
---
Ahh yes thats right, forever loops op
---
Then get an aftermarket controller with better sensitivity, like I said quite a few of my friends have made it to plat-diamond on pc with a controller 
---
Im stereotyping your average coach into the 40-50 yrs old category here. They don’t use social media as much right? So thats what im tryna say. Don’t go about giving free in depth lessons on the internet my good sir
---
Nomad is  so fucking annoying can't wait to insta ban her when pick&amp;ban comes out
---
You're welcome &lt;3
---
Also, fuck spawnpeeeks.
---
Yeah, but despite your good point about free renown, let me restate my original complaint.
---
P90, Ela’s scorion, any smg secondary, any fun with a fast fire rate. Those are are headshot machines.
---
Nope 
---
I believe there is still the promotion which gives you free r6 siege with the purchase of playstation plus on ps4, so that might end up being cheaper, and I've used both consoles and the PS4 community is much less toxic, in my experience, anyway
---
Mine has been consistent though, before it was consistently 9, now it’s consistently higher 
---
Damn that was disrespectful... 10/10
---
People are really defending ping abusers? Smh. It just doesn’t make sense to let them play on different servers in the first place. They could be plats and diamonds but they come and play against golds on our servers. Idc if they “don’t have an advantage” with high ping. They should be playing on their own servers.
---
Hmmm
---
Looking back at his uniform, I see what you mean. I thought you were just being pedantic, my bad.
---
Thank you
---
"please stop running in the hallway".
---
Monty is a beast if you are playing bomb ;)
---
Plus the extra defusing time is less of a concern when you basically need a c4 to stop him if it's smoked up..
---
You know why they started to tk me? Because I didn't protect him. Why do these assholes always come in groups each round I was getting killed then I had enough.
---
First thing I'd do is stop lowering the price every free weekend, holiday season, invitational, etc, have the standard and deluxe versions of the game be sold for $50, the complete edition be sold for $60, then when said free weekend arrives and what-not, lower the standard and deluxe versions to 10% off, and the complete edition to 15% off, that's just the 1st part, the 2nd part is a bit more complex, but, essentially, a player is reported for smurfing, their IP is looked into and if they find that, that IP shares multiple account(s), they completely wipe and remove the lower leveled smurf account, that's just my idea on what should happen.
---
Judge Dredd helmets would be awesome
---
It's free renown though.
---
Nice job man
---
sorry, assumed he was our representation
---
They're actually quite balanced. It just depends on what mode you play the most. If you play a lot of PvP then you probably already completed PvP challenges and you'll get PvE ones for a while.
---
I love playing THunt and for me it's the other way round. I see mostly PvP challenges there since I complete THunt ones often while playing. Sometimes I even skip pvp challenges for a chance of getting new challenges next day, so I could get something new for THunt.
---
Nice, my laptop's been acting up too recently.
---
can't normal bullets do that?
---
perhaps
---
I dont get how they connect
---
I have it as well, but any of the 3 Spetsnaz bundles are superior imho. Especially the urban &amp; snow one.
---
Ik some people are using it. But you can’t be a 100% sure in game when spectating someone that they are using it. 
---
Wouldn't change his outfit that much, seeing as the units deployed there did use Smersh bandoliers, Defender II bulletproof vests and Gorka suits. The only main difference I could think of is swap the Gorka for a KLMK suit and give him a ZSH1 helmet.
---
*Tries Terrorist Hunt*
---
*Gets 18 minute queue for normal difficulty*

*Finally gets in match*

*Article 5 forty seven times in a row*

r/fountainpens wants to know your location

He will get one eventually, it got leaked not too long ago.

---
It probably wouldn't be added just because it would massively extend the length of a ranked match and a decent percentage of people wouldn't even bother using it. Not to mention the fact that rounds often require quick adaptation after prep phase to deal with a variable defense. If it came before prep phase, attack would just have to sit and wait because they can't plan an attack on no intel, if it came after prep phase it would be useless to defenders and they'd just have to sit and wait for the attack to start for however long the planning phase is.
---
If you still want some way to plan your rounds, Ubi has a ["Tactical Whiteboard"](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/whiteboard/landing.aspx) app that I think has actually been updated in the last 6 months, surprisingly. Alternatively there's a community developed ["Battle Planner"](https://battleplanner.io/) app that I think is actually being actively developed. But I wouldn't expect this to ever come into online play, it's just too much padding on any one game.
---
You can tell, but yeah sometimes people cry wolf
---
&gt; GSG9's plain clothes doctrine.
---
If you're talking about IRL doctrines, then you're looking for SEK, not GSG9. Ubi just dun goof'd up.
---
This makes no sense to me. I understand this premise and rightly so but we both got the last two attackers to win the round, who cares who gets the diffuser? Better yet, let's throw the round!
---
I already have a pen kit set aside for the vertical gradient blank, but I could easily get a fountain pen kit for the horizontal gradient

Yeah I go either extract hostage on house or protect hostage when I play THunt

Why is this downvoted to hell?

That fucking achievement... "camper" or whatever. I hate it. 
---
"Win 100 rounds of terrorist hunt as a defender"
---
Fuck that dude. I'm like 37 rounds deep, and I e had the game since launch. Wayyyyy too much terrorist hunt. 
---
This is the last achievement inhave to get before i 100%

Thanks for the comment. This is why i posted this. So players can put in their learning proces.

Wow the fanart on this sub has gone from shitty to turbo shitty

The Originals from Ubisoft Store look better and you get a inGame Charm with them.
---
What you bought is the low quality Gamestop ripoff that you cant buy in the most Countries (EU) because of Brand and Copyright Laws.

Totally agree but I actually do like ela icon for some reason

Needs more thicc

I think they look great

I think ive died and gone to heaven

Ah! I see someone has seen The Russian Badger!
---
This isn’t Rainbow Six
---
Echo and Nomad?
---
I completely agree they look great, but I think the operators icons should represent their gadget like the non-DLC operators
---
Well i guess the new update shows their gadgets in game. Like Bandit has a car battery icon while Buck has a shotgun icon. I think they putted those to make the icons look better. If you ask me it was a nice idea.
---
Could have been on the other team
---
Well alot of them follow the lore of the operators, and many of which still are somewhat related to the ops abilities, like lion is both the machanics of the ability where it makes you deaf lol, and how he has a very very very loud voice
---
It doesn't look great, but at least he didn't get it because he wears tight jeans.
---
I agree 100% 
---
Come on ubi
---
Lower the mic volume. You can test out how it sounds through sound settings --&gt; properties on the microphone --&gt; listen tab then check the box and apply. If that's on and you don't hear anything, then there won't be any white noise in your recordings. Then you raise mic volume on the separate apps (discord, etc).
---
Just switched from Xbox to PS4 during free weekend and can't agree more. Less toxic and more willing to help out noobs
---
Except favela has so many walls that you _need_ to reinforce. Skip 3 reinforcements on a map? There probably won't be too much of a difference unless it's favela
---
Mr.Homeless?

hahahahahahaha so funny lol lol lmao

Zofia is a Phoenix due to her ability to survive hardship, and the ingame ability to revive herself

Ask "who do you guys want to ban?" during Road to SI.
---
They wanted to ban me, I guess.
---
No, ping abuse. It's when someone from another part of the world jumps regions to play on another server with ridiculous ping. These people have an incredible peeker's advantage over those native to the region. Did you mean ping spamming like scanning on drones?
---
Yeah, if you read his bio, Twitch made it, or at least worked on it, and is pissed about the fact the Maestro made his own name for it instead of the name she gave it
---
So the guy I talked to said " most stable driver that nvidia has released is the 411.70 driver". I'll try and find this driver when I'm home and try it out. (without VSync). Currently I do have the latest driver which I think released like yesterday.

Reflex sight

Yeah you must not play the game

Big Rhonda

After bandit lost his A cog he had to resort to using drugs to cure his depression
---
Technically, they could have their gadget nicknamed the Stegosaurus
---
Just follow rainbow on twitter mate. They always update on new info. And no it has not.
---
You contradicted yourself. Do you get upgraded to standard or do you keep your legacy ops if you had starter before the changes?
---
Color = the Operation the Operator is from. (Red = Red Crow, Purple = Velvet Shell, etc)
---
Star = Season 1, 2, 3 or 4 when the Operator was released (has nothing to do with the Year)
---
____
---
There is a Bug right now that all Legacy and Year 1 Operators have the Operation Red Crow Symbol next to them. (Not the first time)
---
They are until white noise
---
on console? I don’t think so, maybe 65? it maxes out 
---
No, they shouldn't. They should represent the characters themselves. Now there's a separate gadget icon for gadgets.

Imagine thinking your rank in a video game is worth caring about.

Some people actually like playing certain aspects of siege that arent a crouch spam hacker hell and appreciate getting extra renown. Take your entitlement and shove it up your ass.
---
Yeah i have that too. I think i will try that driver out. Thanks a lot!
---
LEGO leaked it before Ubisoft leaked it
---
Man you must have some next level free time holy crap 
---
Depends on your playstyle
---
Thats a bit of stretch. Most people who play casual do so because they enjoy the fundamentals of the game but want a lack of the competition ranked brings to the table. You're ruining the fun here. 
---
And you must be a really fun person to hold a conversation with
---
i’m not saying it’s a piston, when she pulls out the trax, she pulls out a handle attached to a rod, which looks exactly like that
---
That would be nice but then if you don’t like an operator ubi will never get your money
---
But that's true I'm talking only about Zofia, cuz that's pry self-explanatory. But Kaid for example... I have no idea
---
Ye they you can be kicked for just joining the game in casual lol, in another match i had capitao i shot a fire bolt and then 2 geniuses in my team (super trolls) just run towards the fire and stood there till they die and then I got banned for 30m for team killing. That's why I'm just playing ranked because you can't be kicked for no reason
---
i like em fugly

Alpha Packs' contents are determined when you acquire them.

Maybe try turning V-Sync ON
---
Shit my bad 😅
---
I need you to spell it out for me.
---
&gt; flashbangs are incredibly inconsistent in this game
---
it is unbelievably inconsistent. honestly i have never seen a flashbang this inconsistent in prior FPS games. 
---
&gt; If a flash bang is very very close to you it doesn’t matter where you look, you’ll still be blinded.
---
but how close is close, metres?
---
In what elo does this happen? Am i safe in copper 4?
---
there isnt but you can spawn peek all the spawns from 2-3 deffirent points
---
In siege the pvp concept is that operators are in simulated events that will train operators for a real threat while pve is the real ops v terrorists in action
---
I had the day of my life yesterday but today is just no. Just played another were it went 3-5 but my team didn’t say a word
---
Why.
---
THANK YOU,
---
That was the first thing that came to mind. horse. WTF.
---
Never heard or seen anyone play by this rule. It doesn't matter who defuses it, as long as it gets defused.
---
i have come from Battlefield. flashbangs are rarely used over there. my last experience of seeing plenty of flashbangs being used was MW2, but at least it was consistent there.
---
I’d like to see them put more focus on the situations.  Perhaps they put some new challenges to them or create some new ones focused around the new ops.  
---
I know most will get upset if Ubi puts any focus on single player content...but I’m with you, sometimes I just feel like doing something quick without any stress.
---
And here we have the wild Jaeger, after getting his acog removed and placing his ADS on the objective he now retreats to his den and lies in wait for a recruit to run by
---
All of these can be answered with “it’s casual, nobody needs to care”
---
Basically you can mix guns from different CTUs so you could have the LMG-E (GROM) with the D-50 secondary (Navy SEALs)
---
I deleted all the "win a terrorist hunt" challenges but if it says"play one terrorist hunt with the x ctu" then i just play the hostage defence and i kill the hostage and boom challenge completed
---
Fokin Artist Sights!
---
Ingame model was fine, they could have just changed the art imo.
---
Neither look great
---
You're right. Silly me.
---
Bro its just casual.+ its not toxic to do runouts its part of the game.
---
Yeah, it is.
---
Well yes but doc is an anchor it's a fundamental aversion to his role in the game 
---
Don‘t lose hope :) Siege Community is a lovely one once you get to know the right ppl :) 
---
Yea, this is Xvideos 😂, great drawing of IQ
---
This is true...but the screen tearing is pretty bad.
---
Professional player banned for cheating 
---
Are there any non-universal charms
---
How would he know that he didn’t say anything to his team then?
---
Just depends on the play. I personally like the 'ol switchero. Let them hit the prism then maneuver in over the plate and get 'em when they peak again, because they always peak again. Kind of throws her skins out of the play on something like that.
---
Absolutely not true. I had a friend who played FBI shield recruit and he came in clutch more times than I can count
---
