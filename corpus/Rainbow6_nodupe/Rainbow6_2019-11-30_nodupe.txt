Obviously he read the post because he suggested going somewhere else or playing n√∏kk, both would make an annoying valk cam useless
---
13,000&gt;12,800 so it is correct
---
Because you can't stop a shields' melee attack once it started, the timing looks good for you but on the server he already had it going (as seen in the killcam too)

So why don‚Äôt you go and do this in casual if it‚Äôs not impressive at all. Can‚Äôt be that hard can it?

That complication is probably more kills then I've gotten over all of my playtime

Right. But I have 13,429. I understand it is technically the truth, but why wouldn‚Äôt it just say ‚Äúmore than 13k frags‚Äù the second time instead of 12,800
---
You don't have 100 friends being a shitty recruit
---
No, I understand your frustration; you don‚Äôt get much of a warning when you‚Äôre peeking a doorway and a Cav comes bolting past only to get domed by your bullets aimed at your enemies. Honestly at that point I think it‚Äôs just an ethics thing for them to toggle the ‚Äòit wasn‚Äôt an intentional TK‚Äô switch after they‚Äôre killed. People do need to watch where they‚Äôre going though, myself included lol, but I agree.

Alright, let's get technical up in this b**ch. 
---

---
A few things work according to a client, others work according to a server. Smoke grenades, body ragdolls and debris (barricade breaking) are calculated from the client which is your your own computer doing its thing on its own.
---
Other things, like hit recognition, flash grenades, player position for example are calculated from your computer and sent to a server which is comparing things with all players and adjusting those among them.
---
Sometimes, there is a difference between players so servers are going to adjust these descrepencies and it takes time : that's your ping.
---
Client sided elements are unavoidable because it relieves pressure from the servers. Most of the time, it's barely noticeable.
---
Other times you get shot through a barricade that you can clearly see on your screen. Or through a Mira that clearly was ejected but got stuck. It sucks but there is no way around it.

A common mistake people will make is linking their PSN and such to their social media, and very simple google search of the username will find their Facebook insta etc. If you have ever shared a PSN video on Facebook, it‚Äôs linked to it and super easy to find. I do that shit all the tome to get obnoxious little kids to shut up. So just be careful what you link to what. Especially if you‚Äôre toxic!
---
yikes üò≥
---
Alibi is more fun, mozzie is better tactily imo
---
'Better' is bad word, since It highly depends of situation.
---
Alibi is a roamer.
---
Mozzie is some kind of character that you use to play around the point, some roaming etc + provide amazing info thanks to your ability.
---
Both characters have good weapon.
---
I myself would pick Mozzie - I just like his weapons, gadget and shotgun :) 
---
I also find Mozzie being more useful most of the times.
---
Even ik ranked?! You're a beast my dear sir!
---
I want to see a full Danish Targeted Op
---
Of course! we're doing gods work.

Every kind of moment is toxic when you're the only one random in team and full premade kills you after you get ace.
---
What's up fellow console player
---
You're all mine,
---
seu miser√°vel
---
Your not giving evidence either beacuse where is the stats saying that nobody uses it on console asides new players or that there is no way to control the recoil at all uh so don‚Äôt get all tuff beacuse someone points out things against your shoddy argument
---
I loved every bit of that! Keep it up!
---

---
can you do Cav animated?
---
I am trash at this game and will never get an ace so i will never experience this moment lol.
---
Mr Ditkovitch wants his rent BUT HE'S NOT GETTING IT
---
just play the game, watch some YouTubers and streams to get comfy on the maps. and play in a speed that works with your aim. spam some terrorist hunts. it's gonna take some time before u know the game but that's how it is.
---
Well I really enjoyed T-hunt when I first started playing. Others not so much.  
---
Try it yourself for few hours and see if it works for you.
---
All the people that sent me toxic messages because I didn't do something right but forgot that it's casual mode
---
Hmmm the fact that console struggle with recoil management, plus random recoil. No I don't think anyone would use that. And plus me at plat and high platinum I rarely even see Ela being played. Plus when I do it's never with a scorpion. Because there's no point in using a gun that's random and does one of the worst damages in game.
---
I‚Äôll say 8/10 I die or watch someone kill without even aiming and that‚Äôs not always at CQC distance ( -10m).
---
I know how a shotgun works but when the enemy is able to spam while hip firing above 10m that not normal, this gun has the biggest mag capacity and the highest RPM whit decent damage between 12-18 m being 29 per pellets.
---
I looked with different shotgun and with the extended barrel ( which is the goal of the attachement) it has the best damage beyond 10 m, like I said I agree that in CQC ( -10m) it has less damage but like I said it has higher rpm. The F0 is at 400 while the SAS shotgun is at 85, the SAS shotgun requires more aim/ skil to use because if you miss your first bullet you are more likely dead but with the F0 it doesn‚Äôt matter if you miss your gun is shooting at 400 RPM with 11 bullets in the mag. 
---
The difference between a pump shotgun and a full auto ( in hip fire) is that with the pump you are less likely to hit them because you can only shoot one bullet, you are pretty much required to ADS if the enemy is between 10-12 m. With the F0 it doesn‚Äôt matter you can easily spam it while hip firing, yes you may have less pellet that hit  but you shot a whole lot more bullets so at the end you have more pellets that hit the enemy ( between 10-12m).
---
That‚Äôs my problem with this gun the extended barrel you add 5 more damage per pellet so 40 more damage in theory, you have a high enough mag capacity and rpm to just spam the enemy and you only need 4 pellets to hit instead of 5 ( for 1 armor) that theoretically half of a shot ( each shot has 8 pellet). 
---
So if we resume, you need 4 pellets to kill a 1 armor, you have decent spread while in ADS and hip firing, you can add a vertical grip ( helps more on this gun compare to on a pump) you have 400 RPM and 11 bullets in the mag. Something is this need to go and that‚Äôs what they did, they increase recoil and the spread.
---
Thank you sm!
---
yikes? i prefer being unranked. games are for fun  and seige really isn't a very well balanced or competitive game. its good for pros however.
---
your rank means fuck all to anyone else.
---
if i see a diamond in my casual games, i don't fear you, at all. you probably ain't shit without your 5 stack really anyway, contrary to the meme.
---
Shut the fuck up boomer with your old words

What's up

Do you like console too? (I &lt;3 it)

I'm prolly switching to PC when Halo Infinite comes out.

Tachanka because you have to be standing still to use his gadget which is never good in siege. Castle is good if you have a strat and/or know what youre doing. Bb is and always will be fundamentally broken since siege revolves around headshots and he can prevent them.
---
Russian reddot is more precise
---
thats great and all but if your in a ranked game with a diamond ur gonna get shit on bud.  Also siege is well balanced, ur just ass.
---
For a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù YouTuber, he‚Äôs not very funny. Relies far too much on being loud or making funny voices.
---
It's obviously talking abot the anicient Germaner, an ancient race known for their creation of the Acog
---
I would honestly recommend dropping your sense. 
---
I used to play higher and dropped it down and I have seen a drastic changes in how many fun fights I win. 
---
I started at 20/20 83 800dpi 
---
And slowly dropped it down, currently at 4/4 35 800dpi, and my aim feels crisp and on point now.
---
Hmmm I don‚Äôt struggle with recoil on a game pad nor do my friends hell not even my friend with half a fucking arm most people who are even silver now bow to control recoil even with the scorpions random left right recoil by two firing and also why did you say both plat and high platinum you don‚Äôt need do have both just one or the other
---
Im sorry he doesn't tell your favorite kind of jokes. But i happen to enjoy it
---
This made me so mad
---
yea actually on closer inspection can see that was looking at the wrong barricade still very much disagree that the systems unhackable though
---
I know right? it's actually decent that time
---
That sounds awful, but, regardless, the Xbox One has a manual setting to change the layput by going into the controller settkngs. I'm not sure if it's the same.

Are you on Windows?

If so press the Windows key and R. Type in %appdata%. And click enter. After that open up .Minecraft. then saves I think. It might also be called worlds. Then find the world your looking for and copy and paste it to your desktop.

Theres been some issues in the past with this. Basically if you buy a better version sometimes itll say that you already own the game (to prevent double pay situations), in that even youd have to uninstall, fully delete the game from your account (same area as refunds I think), and then buy the better edition. Since ubi accounts bind it all you shouldn't lose anything but that part inparticular would be worth looking into
---
No fucking way man that's my account

I love Alibi and the MX4 slaps, but Mozzie is probably going to be more useful in most rounds, and his guns can also put in work.

I've had the same experience I've seen written a thousand times on this sub in posts about console or PC. TKs, racist kids, vote kick because a pre-made party, vote kick for not picking recruit, vote kick because, well, who cares?

I'd let you join, but the rest of my team would accuse me of trying to get a carry. Sorry man.

Hellllll no

First of, they tried nokk with an AR ( you can see AR magazines on her character) she was too strong.

Secondly they tried with acog again she was too strong.

We know you are nostalgic about Jager and bandit acog but this would never happen.

Yea if I didn't his videos on Siege and just try to have fun, I'd probably just shrug off Siege after playing it once because I sucked at it and assumed most of its players would judge me and be mean to me.
---
I mean, I still suck at Siege. And there are still some people are absolute sweaty cunts.
---
But you get the idea though.
---
All because the auto pick wasn‚Äôt what they wanted...
---
What's the point of frags or smoke when she looses gunfights
---
I have one friend that plays the game and one that will be getting it I‚Äôm pretty sure. What do you play r6 on?

thats just how minimalistic it is!

I think it would be worth it. The fmg-9 just isn't the play. An operator that's entire purpose is flanks and unexpected rushes should have guns that compliment this crazy style

What about Mathew?

More ad-hominem? I haven‚Äôt even insulted you. I have not done anything other than disagree with your opinion and you are telling me to die. Bit of an over exaggeration ain‚Äôt it? As for the for honor posts, I was fairly angry at the game at the time, but quitting it has made me way more happy. But I guess it‚Äôs impossible to change right? There‚Äôs no possible way a person can change? Ah whatever. If you are trolling me, you aren‚Äôt doing a good job at it. All it seems like is you trying to make me angry and failing, meanwhile I haven‚Äôt insulted you once and you seem to be angrier than a bull.
---
Trust me, just use glaz and rook ( glaz is being buffed), they are the best ops in the game
---
In one video he refers to it as "semi-clickbaity"
---
Hate to be that guy, but technically since you shot twice it wasn‚Äôt a one tap even if the first killed him, cause you tapped twice.
---
It ain‚Äôt bots from what I hear, actual people will be doing sweeps of the videos.
---
Still with the passive aggressive shit lol, and yea you certainly did get pretty triggered by a video game. But good on you for changing big man! I bet you haven‚Äôt thrown your controller in days! And even if you don‚Äôt follow my advice on a quick death, heart disease and obesity will get you soon enough. I‚Äôm glad that you don‚Äôt get mad at video games anymore though lol, what a big step!
---
For ps4 siege, find yourself some teammates, it's not that hard

Well thats good

I respect people who have the courage to not use the recording feature on the console and still post it online

Kudos to the ace btw! I know your heart was pumping!

Mallet not hammer, but I still got it!
---
aaaaaand they say console players are bad o_0
---
The percentage at which your speed is penalized in movement, pretty sure. Pistols and primaries have different mobility stats, as does Fuze's shield from his rifles, and Clash's two secondaries
---
Not necessarily. Do you think they have time to watch every goddamn video for the content? They might just be basing it off of the thumbnail and title so the fines might be issued even if the video‚Äôs content isn‚Äôt directed at children but the thumbnail and title appear so.
---
where is the Google Drive link?
---
Yeah I was thinking that too. I‚Äôm suprisingly good with semi autos even if I‚Äôm console and glaz looks fun
---
Ok thats what i thought for the longest, but wasnt sure if there was something i was missing since i only bought it like 3 or 4 days ago
---
I do but they don't always wanna play and so I play in like 3 man's not being able to register that Randos usually don't have a mic and lack common sense but it's mostly my fault for not learning my lesson
---
I dont think its worth the risk. Best to move them into a USB or something, or maybe buy a "clean" PC that you never use cheats on to avoid any potential risk, not just for Siege.
---
When my ps4 party isn't ready to play I go to Unranked mode,try it.

Didn‚Äôt they nerf the damage on her gun like two seasons ago? That along with the machine pistol nerf was what made me stop playing her as often.
---
On the dmr? Nope. Just recoil. Negligible though
---
Being able to watch the hallway both ways and being able to see in to the archives room. Having my rotation holes to go where i please. Surpriseing the enemy after hitting them with a blast and shotgunning them.

I do it everything and people normally dont care about the corner im in.
---
You‚Äôre right it was the recoil. That was all the dmrs though right?
---
Oh God Bajur you wholesome motherfucker

i haven't gotten a good alpha pack drop in so long.

---
use m4
---
Get level 10 and start playing unranked. All I can say
---
It works well with some guns when enemy is too close.
---
this game is just toxic. if you get higher level, it gets very fun and way easier. stick in there
---
That‚Äôs just simply how toxic console community is. Just keep trying and learning from every death.
---
I dont know what to fell you other then, stick with it. There was a large portion of my playtime where i was just god awfull, getting lost on maps missing 80% of my shots, getting shot from obvious as hell angles. 
---
And after sticking with it  and  leaving and coming back multiple times. Its just  i dno clicked ?   
---
One day to another maps suddenly made sense and i knew where i was  in relation to everywhere on the map, which was making me more relaxed  not being lost all the damn time. Then my aim started improving  and everything else started falling into place. I went from being the absolute worst in my playgroup to being one of the better ones and still feel like i am constantly improving.  So yeah.. stick with it  is all i can say.

No it wrecks I use it all the time
---
It will just like ranked

FBI riot shield squad or m870 rush is the best

I think his content is good. Maybe we are not the target audience, but he uses games and movies to segway into science (for example: He uses Pikachus lightning attacks to explain how electricity works). If his stuff is a fun, harmless way to get kids interested in science then I don't see why anyone would be against it.

But tbh it‚Äôs not their fault cause both the champ and the dia are at a 100% winrate so nothing they could have done there

That‚Äôs so cool. Great job!

PMM stands for Power Move Machine change my mind
---
I feel like they should make it a thing that you don‚Äôt lose mmr when losing 4:5 in max OT. Cause it‚Äôs really frustrating to spend half more than half an hour of your life just to lose to who got def first

Watch braction and aust1n on utube if u havent already. If u have then just practice more. I started on gold 3 and now for the past 4 5 season ive been climbing up to plat 1. I remember a time where I just coulnt climb past plat 3 for a while and I was losing confidence. Then started practicing on my aim and positioning and broke through that wall. As I said above austin's vid helped me alot. Hope this helps. Good lucn in ur future endeavors

Non-roit confirmed. Boo this man.

If you want to play like an idiot then carry on. I don‚Äôt understand the need for wanting everyone else to play like a dork!?
---
Usually casual is for trying new strats, positioning, learning of maps, better vantage and rotations without being penalised. If you want to fuck about as recruit, leaning side to side with a c4 in your hands then do so. Just don‚Äôt complain when no one gives a fuck and brains you
---
All shitposts why do you are so much if you didnt when you could've got it.
---
The best option it to get someone already experienced to play with. If you have at least one teammate in party you won't be kicked.
---
Also start watching streamers and youtubers (I can recommend Macie Jay for quality gameplay and Rogue9 if you want to know mechanics and numbers) and then pro league for strats and team play.
---

Make sure to aim at the third leaves cross from the right, then a little bit lower. Now you've got yourself a really hard to see cam that watches the map room corridor. (:
---
Also, the spot is pingable, so you can ping if you really need to.
---
With no context it's a cute simplistic picture. Art style is minimalistic and really gives a slice of life feel.
---
But deep down I rage as I see idiots reinforce it and stay on site as fuze charges start to rain in.
---
I agree, but it's classic Siege, so we can give it a pass.
---
That Smoke elite is so fucking bad. Jesus Ubi. Whatchoo doin'?
---
Non roit bot confirmed

I don‚Äôt really have any friends who play unfortunately and don‚Äôt have a mic either, but yeah Ima check up those videos and follow their advice
---
Nice job! I recognized it before realizing what sub this post was from.
---
Is enough to make a grown man cry
---
Holy shit lmao
---
Haha racism and stereotypes funny
---
They are trying to fix that but their whole system is built like that. So they need an entire new destruction system
---
Not the only thing you didn't do right.
---
As a counter for why thats a bad idea
---
At high levels, people used to look up your stats during the lobby phase and would back out if you was really good or recognisable. 
---
Thus Siege got rid of the pre game lobby - however allowing the game to cancel if a player left in the first round would just reintroduce this back to the game
---
That's a long way from Russia.
---
Too bad rn there isn‚Äôt any alternative to yt
---
You guys really downvoted a man for not liking an objective.
---
yeah he can be possible
---
Yeah hardly anyone plays it
---
It‚Äôs really not hard to get to gold. I solo 99.9% of my games while trolling team8s who squeek cry.
---
I could easily get gold every season. Plat can depend but it‚Äôs also very reasonable but not going to lie, teammates in solo tend to be very dumb. It‚Äôs a situation for EU servers because this is further divided between language barriers.
---
Then you get people who don‚Äôt understand good level communication skills.
---
People get mad you call out info, others get mad you miss one shot, etc. A lot of variables and the real solution is just go in with a 5 stack if your goal is quality games.
---
If you like it, get it.
---
If you actually play iq a lot and just want the "feel good" factor, then it might be worth it for you.
---
Personally, no elites are worth it as you barely see what you wear, and the gun skins that come with it are poop anyway.
---
As for my opinion on IQ elite, pathetic. You don't just go into battle wearing yoga pants.
---
I get that you want to make a racist joke, and honestly not much else can be expected from modern world humans, but why though? What's the purpose of this post?

---
Is it bad that I once did this
---
hyperx cloud2s yes but you have to change the adapter cuz the adapter makes sound a bit quiet
---
You missed key info, premade vs solo. I would guess most people can not solo plat. You are talking &lt;5% without even looping up the statistics, easily could be 1%
---
Why‚Äôd they mark points off?
---
I mean the hip fire with Alda used to be amazing but not it‚Äôs huge
---
Well I have friends on other servers so personally I like that it has no region locking and I play 60-139 ping on cross server play and I lose a lot to people because of delay

The wood work was kinda shit
---
Late reply when you've probably solve it, but should you not here's how.
---
Press Delete, F2 or F12 after you turn on the PC which should promt you into the BIOS. Look at the memory speed, it's usually below or beside the CPU clock speed. Then you can see the mode it's operating in, either it's single or dual channel.
---
If there isn't anything abnormal, you need to open up your PC case and find a battery cell on your motherboard and take it out for 2-3 minutes before putting it back in and start up. This will reset the BIOS.
---
Ah bummer
---
Shit still looks awesome though. You should revisit it and touch up the woodwork later if you don‚Äôt like it

Don't blame the victim, that's just bullying too.

I think it came into argument for primarily why warden couldn‚Äôt get an acog as a three armor that they didn‚Äôt know how to roll out and block off attachments besides making whole new guns in the code just so an attachment wasn‚Äôt available(obviously the argument is void now), and then other people also built it up that every new gun is a whole new variable to balancing and so they‚Äôre holding off on doing it because now they can do sort of catch all balancing of guns and also to have the option to swap loadouts around if a gun proves to powerful in one ops hands but perfectly fine in another

BOOM BOOM CIAO, BOOM BOOM CIAO

I did the same thing the other day, took 75 rounds to get the kill.
---
Id assume clash lost due to how easy it is to knock her shield away with melee and shoot at her toes.
---
You remind me a guy I met while smurfing in copper that was plat 3, he couldnt couldnt win and was blaming his team for everything, instead of accepting the fact that he just got outclased by a better player. Nothing wrong with this matchmaking, its the player.
---
Doesnt seem like that. Not s single enemy has left recently. Or if they have they came back immediately.
---
But my teammates leave on 0:2 or 0:1
---
The main reason is licensing issues.
---
There wont be until the platform goes under. Itll be like when vine died. Everyones gonna flock to something new and itll be chaos for a while as everyone is going to be going to where the content creators go, scattering everyone to the winds. Some will probably take this as the time to get out and go get an irl job. Eventually, theres gonna be something new and big, but theres still gonna be a massive power vacuum for that spot that youtube held and a whole lot of competition to fill the most of it.
---
change vertical and horizontal from 11 to 12.375 which you obviously can't do so use 12?
---
Just mute everyone as soon as they do anything even a little irritating. Then play ops that dont require synergies to be effective. Do you best, and hope the team doesnt completely fuck up.
---
I disagree with the m4 having huge kick, granted that just takes time
---

Well it depends how it works if console players only fill with pc players if they have a pc player in their stack it would work fine

Mah main man Badger!

i always aim behind them on the ground but sometimes it clips the shield and does at most ten damage

I usually keep voice off. Between me and my brother I can usually pool more info than the other three together. Plus he keeps his voice on, so he has relied vital messages in the past. This is more of just a humorous joke ;)

Mouse and keyboard. Some people will use mouse and keyboard on console servers to win easier and cheat.

Ai, good of you to say; my points are far less for the artist and more so for anybody pursuing the arts; I remember some 20 years ago picking up corrections to my own forms and drills from sources other than my instructors, helped me out a great deal.
---
With regards to the "Wrong Way" you mention, I would suggest viewing Martial Arts as I've done over the years: the 'Martial', the practical and the 'Art', the expression. The energy of the 'Art' will naturally express differently through different individuals, but the core, the 'Martial' should never be ignored - a good example is the forms aspect of the Wushu sport, which pretty much borders on gymnastics: expression is paramount, born from the individuals strengths, but never at the expense of the Martial, the move being performed must remain functional at all times.
---
Yeah, everyone on my team started to slowly die and then we had second thoughts, after that first round we decided to pick whoever we want.
---
If you dont restart the queue after  3-5 minutes you're special
---
Bruh.
---
Pc is better than both fuckin scrubs, kerp talkin
---
I doubt it will ever happen.  However, I'd love to see it happen with specific criteria.
---
I think Siege should have cross-platform play across all three provided they have a separate uniform-settings queue and a non-uniform-settings queue (across all modes allowing cross-platfrom).  In order to allow true cross-platform gameplay, Ubisoft should enable native keyboard and mouse support on console so players who want to play against PC players with keyboard and mouse from console are able.  Players who are using a keyboard and mouse on any platform will always be forced into the non-uniform-settings queue.
---
The uniform-settings queue is the default queue for console players.  This queue will not allow text chat.  In order to queue for this mode, every player in the squad (or the single player if solo-queuing) has to meet the following criteria:
---
* Using a controller
---
* 60 FPS
---
* 60 FOV
---
While in the queue or in a match with these settings, the game will not allow any PC player to switch any of the above settings.
---
The non-uniform settings queue is always available regardless of the settings the player is using.  Players are welcome to use any control mechanism, FPS, or FOV they want.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There are two elephants in the room that I want to address because I know they will come up.
---
1. Players using keyboard and mouse on console via adapters will likely always be an issue because Ubisoft is powerless to reliably detect their use.  The suggestions I made shouldn't make the issue worse and might even improve the situation a little.  There are sometimes legitimate reasons (usually medically related) players would use a keyboard and mouse instead of a controller if they have a console already.  Some of those players may not be trying to gain an unfair advantage but can't or are unwilling to get a PC yet already have a console.  Some of those players might very well use a native keyboard and mouse in the non-uniform-settings queue, taking them out of the controller population.
---
2. This would expose console players to hackers on PC.  Personally, I think expanding the player pool would be worth the relatively low occurrence of hackers in the game.  However, I would be amenable to potentially having a third console only queue, though I definitely have concerns about spreading the player base too thin with a third queue type.
---
Don‚Äôt worry with the new acog on it you will be just as OP as all of us.

If that‚Äôs glaz‚Äôs scope at no level, what‚Äôs the enemy‚Äôs glow at full level?
---
we've already established that they aren't providing anything positive.
---
Ok so entry frag is the dude that runs in and tries to get the opening frags and continues to frag. Basically, the fragger. Often also involved in roam clear.
---
Support are supporting dudes. They hoard utility, put down the plant, hard breach, support Breachers, drone for fraggers, watch flanks and so on.
---
Refraggers basically support the fraggers in fragging and return frag when the fragger is killed. So, the defender that kills the fragger/entry fragger is killed by the refragger.
---
Flex players are flexible. They adapt to the situation, play what the team needs, assume support when necessary or frag otherwise. Or just go Thatcher, help Thermite and Hibana, and frag out once their utility is used up. Basically, muti role. Jack of all trades, master in one or two.
---
On defense is more of anchor or roam. That's basically it. Amidst that, you decide who brings Intel, who traps, and who hard anchors, and who has breach denial like bandit or kaid. There's also soft roam and deep roam, where soft roam roams close to site or right above site and has an off-site hold, and deep roam frags out by holding on the far side of the map (like holding small tower when the objective is in the basement of Oregon) to catch people off guard and/or go for late flanks.
---
Holy f. I didnt expect that. But that was funny as hell my dude.
---

So did other people

They would have to leave before the first round started if this was implemented, and the person who left would still get banned

Thank you!!:)

It didnt look that bad to me
---
Ash and Jager
---
No probs. Glhf.
---
I‚Äôm a Monty main, and even though the changes took getting used to, and he‚Äôs not as good as before he‚Äôs still a viable option, but that‚Äôs only because of how his shield covers him and teammates, other shields are kind of obsolete now.
---
Dom is fuming
---
And this is why siege sucks
---
If you‚Äôre aggressive I‚Äôd say ash or sledge
---
I threw the game because I'm not going to knowingly win because I have 4 cheaters on my team if there's something I can do about it. The idea that I'm thinking about reddit at the time of doing it is just silly.
---
Eh, losing the skins don't really bother me and it only takes a week of grinding to get one of the newest ops
---
Agree, in my 4 years of playing siege I've never muted the music until this season because it made my ears build with that escalating music shit.
---
Need to make a system like mobas have. If someone is gone too long it‚Äôs considered an abandon and the match is nullified and the abandoning player is penalized. This system can be abused with sacrificial accounts, but that occurrence should be low enough to justify an overal benefit to everyone else.
---
I smell some meat

Yea as u/Kechioma we don't. It is cheating. That is the whole point of this clip.

Bots are entirely different from what you would experience in the real multiplayer gameplay. Don‚Äôt base your game experience or skill on the bot gameplay.

Not that easy on console. It's literally impossible to control the smg 11 recoil.

Exactly, which is why ST won't release anytime before next Tuesday or Wednesday. 3 weeks TTS ends next week, and Ubi has kept their word.

The only cool thing they'll do is release some charm. That's it.

Cheaters are literally uselss in this game, as you get your points back, my post was complaining about a very specific cheat which completely ruined the game.

Trolling, in your case, does not give back the points, it ruins the game for 4 people, you acted out of your own assumptions when you had no right to, then went to reddit to fuel your justice boner even more

Also, imagine stalking someone's profile after a comment, i cant see the reason and im not gonna be an armchair psychologist, but its just funny.

It doesn‚Äôt cost that much to build a pc that can run siege well. You mostly need an i5 which is about $230 for the cpu and MB. Then a Rx 570 which can run a lot of games well at 1080p and sales for about $110. Then the rest is up to you so for about $500 you can build a really solid PC.

is there a minimum or like a cap on how low it can go? because theoretically you could get stuck in a rank forever, if you played enough games.
---
For casual, this is fine.
---
GG EZ
---
I did
---
It‚Äôs meant to reward players more for playing the objective and supporting team play rather then just going for kills. Likely that person planted and carried the defuser a lot, reconned and droned well and used their gadgets to assist the team.
---
Legit cute.
---
Well 1 can u control the recoil.2 is ur sense to high.3 r6 is a game when of u hit 1 shot in the head they die so as thanos said u shouldve aimed for the head
---
https://www.lifewire.com/the-xx-best-rainbow-six-siege-tips-of-2019-subtitle-please-add-4584632 I just sent this to a few of my friends. I feel theres some decent stuff in there for new players.
---
Cavs other ability (other than her silent step) is she can go up to downed enemies and ‚Äò interrogate‚Äô then. Takes a couple of seconds so it‚Äôs risky but if you pull it off you can see the rest of the enemy teams icons, so you can see where they are. Big risk, big reward!
---
Oh, I see the confusion. You get points back from cheaters __ON PC__... That doesn't exist on console. Cheaters never get banned or caught because the 3rd party device they use for MnK isn't detectable by Ubi.. so we're forced to just put up with rampant cheating that goes unpunished.
---
Think I've seen some streamers get it down to the single digits late in a season.
---
I went from Plat 2-ish to gold 2-ish. I havent really put a lot of time into ranked on PC yet. Im sure if I grinded a season out I could probably hit it.
---
Droning? Planting? Defusing?
---
Is this for airsoft Cruz that's dope
---
Mp5 has good rate of fire,  damage and of course the acog
---
I really like the 416-c cause its fun to use and has good recoil
---
Fuck that I had 10 kills
---
fair but not valid because of a PMM on PMM peek
---
I meant graphics card
---
The the leaderboard has a single pixel wider section for one box
---
[removed]
---
yeah sorry
---
I don't know why no one has yet mentioned Tachanka, it seems pretty obvious to me.
---
Probably glaz. I can‚Äôt think of a single situation where I feel like he‚Äôs a better choice over someone else.
---
Dw
---
Because good players don‚Äôt need to be carried by their teammates.
---
Defending will be far too easy, jager acog, bandit acog, lesion acog, mute acog, mozzie acog. The list goes on and on. All those operators are strong enough without acog. Defending will be a game of spawn.
---
r/unexpectedspongebob

Edit: wait no r/unexpectedpatrick
---
Do you play with Marley or are friends with him? What do you think about his video titles
---
Serious question
---
I run holo on every op acog feels nasty and hard to aim with
---
üò®
---
Honestly I prefer acog on just about everything
---
Gridlock and tatchanka
---
The Badger Way
---
Warden and Vigil are the two that come to mind immediately, but after more thought, include N√∏kk and Amaru.  They‚Äôre all incredibly niche and just not that great solo.
---
The f2 is great, the revolver sucks.
---
Good ops for attack : Sledge, Finka (Easy to use, and while team ability)
---
Good ops for defense : Rook (MP5) , Kapkan (His AR). Kapkan has great traps that can still get kills and make a difference if you die
---
Deagle because it has a high rate of fire, no recoil and high damage
---
glad kaid is getting buffed again
---
I used to when I played battlefield 4 a lot then when I switched to siege I go pretty much holo on every game it's available on
---
And you get more points for it than a Normal kill
---
Literally years late to the party
---
thanks for the input man
---
I do understand how XIM work. The reason why they won't do anything about is not because they can't it's just they won't because there is no incentive for them in developing a solution to prevent XIM.
---
Cans and comp in are training missions. While T hunt is the real thing according to ubi.
---
I use the holo basically for a faster playstyle on Buck's AR, I think it makes it also more controllable, but could be just my imagination and I suck or something.
---
I mean, all evidence point to they can't because the only comment we have from them is them saying as much, but believe what you want haha. Not worth arguing about.
---
Normal Sunday
---
Meme gun=the best gun
---
Agreed. Not arguing losing a person doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs just a very complex problem, and I don‚Äôt really think there is a simple solution.
---
No I totally get that, different weapon sights are psychological
---
Hate to brake the trend but I rum red dot on all primary guns
---
This is just a idea but make it so you can fuze through reinforcements but can be bandit tricked to not make it overpowered.
---
That was it. Yeah that one
---
If I provide a btc address will you donate? I work for ubi.
---
Who cares. Ppl always say if u get spawn peeked ur bad at the game anyway and who cares if defending will be easier it‚Äôll be an event not ranked
---
Woah buddy, let‚Äôs not start name calling...
---
I mean, if that‚Äôs what you like
---
Sometimes its laggy for everyone, game not end or not start or can't start another round....big delay before even match starts. Its fine for you ?
---
Better balanced than before though, where you could legitimately hipfire spawnpeek people with the Alda.
---
Hell yeah, ***brother***
---
Right he honestly should be 2 speed 2 armor. How else are you gonna look cool running around in a suit? Also his run animation with the mpx is not that exciting and very annoying to cover up the right side of my screen.
---
Honestly the solution is get better. Then you'll understand how it feels when retards do stupid things and cause you to lose.
---
I remember when we were losing a match and I was playing cav....
---
I potatoed a whole mag of my pistol and 2 shotgun shells.....
---
I got yelled at by teammates so....I haven‚Äôt gotten back into siege for a while now.....
---
UP.
---
Fucking hell his laughter is annoying
---
Did you play back in the day of jager and bandit acog? They were going back and forth between 4 windows in like 3 seconds you can‚Äôt possibly watch 4 windows by yourself, it was hell. 
---
Even if it‚Äôs and event, it should be balanced.
---
[deleted]
---
That‚Äôs nothing pfft. Buy it
---
This happened to me too, i didnt even got to a match so i just quit the game...
---
I don‚Äôt think it will run it. Macs and stuff aren‚Äôt made for gaming
---
Yeah, normal usbs won‚Äôt give you good input at all, xim‚Äôs are designed to mimic controller inputs to a tee.
---
Maybe he originally recorded it on his phone and then uploaded it to to his PC.
---
fucking Finka
---
Ash and Thermite on Attack. 
---
Jager and Doc on Defense. 
---
Guns are very good with slight recoil only.
---
The system should be able to detect you‚Äôre in a 2v5 and make it so you lose much less elo than you would regularly.
---
Well time to stop playing now
---
You lucky bastard
---
Idk
---
Exactly
---
Ight. Have fun man

When you‚Äôre on the R6 subreddit page you go to options and select ‚Äúchange user flair‚Äù (at least that‚Äôs how to do it on mobile)

Teammates are so weird. You just don‚Äôt know what they are thinking half the time.

Oh you weren‚Äôt lying

Or just a movie about what they do on their free time

I learned not to be mad at that anymore if you get kicked before you join in they are doing you a favor in a way who wants to play on a team with a toxic meme 4 stack

Don't check ops' posts

So when are you gonna uninstall?

How tf you finding all this
---
What season did you buy it in? The baseline operators have been free some seasons then paid the next.
---
nice :)
---
lol dude after seeing like 4 videos benchmarking the 1660ti, the averages ARE 120-130, and sometimes going 160-170~ probably due to a better cpu

That I believe! Under no circumstances should it have ever worked, but it was absolutely hilarious when it did.

You know that everyone already found those right?

Last season but it gave me renown which was enough to buy all the ops.

Well its a bit hard for people to help you when you havnt given much context or what you have tried or pictures
---
These are my kind of teammates in casual, man. Everything is okay, we're about to win, barely any time left, all they need to do is not die for a little bit. So obviously everyone swarms the last attacker hoping to just get the win immediately. And obviously that's thr best way to get killed.
---
Aight so which is which for my future reference?

Ight guys, thank you but I think I found it.

Why the fuck do you have acog on it

That‚Äôs messed up, I didn‚Äôt realize it was like that.
---
Cav has three abilities 1: excellent downing potential with her pistol and her silent step melee  which makes her put her knife away to down opponents 2: silent step makes her silent 3: interrogation which reveals the enemies locations to ur team
---
He activates a device that makes him invisible when drones look at him

That would be me üòÇüòÇ

That‚Äôs messed up, didn‚Äôt realize it worked like that:

Open window + bad laptop mic + traffic outside does that to you :p

She‚Äôs a very deep voiced woman which gives some diversity instead of the OwO kawaii girls but changing a voice actor will always be disliked especially if it‚Äôs been years but I personally don‚Äôt care I just like mira for the gameplay
---
what's wrong with it?  
---
  
---
it's the only microtransaction purchase I'm actually considering buying, and I've played since day 1
---
Huh?
---
I never play ranked and last time I decide it was time to do my placements. I played dokaebbi and hacked into defenders cameras. Their valk placed a black eye in the objective and we were in a 2v1 with 15 seconds remaining. I called out where the last guy was and told them that Im watching the cameras if hes gonna push. We had an easy plant and a secured win as it was match point. Instead, my teammates decided not to plant and just run to the guy and the timer went off. And thats why I never play ranked
---
&gt;What the fuck made ubisoft think elas fo12 was okay??
---
The fact that Ela's win rate was poop all along until this season?
---
dont know if your teammates are nearby or not, as soon as you start the interrogation, they can see their teammates outline rolled over, so they‚Äôll just shoot cav through the wall, or accidentally take cavs kill in the process
---
Some people hate it, I'm fine with it
---
What the...
---
I need to try that
---
Nailed it
---
He activates his malarkey and can‚Äôt be seen by enemy cameras/drones for a limited time. After it‚Äôs duration has expired there is a short cool down before it may be used again. When a drone/camera is close you will see white lines sort of like you would for a stereo mixer at the bottom of the screen. All of this is a great argument for why he should be an attacker instead of a defender. I‚Äôm not bitter at all.
---
and the EE-ONE-D can't detect him when it's active
---
 I actually like this idea more, let's just make her able to bring a garbage can and almost snake-style hide under it wherever.
---
Hmmm guess your call outs were too good

Yes comments pleassee

I checked my stats recently and it turns out, tachanka's my highest K/D out of all operators.  He's definitely not bad as long as you're willing to abandon your turret if necessary.
---
I'm trying diffrent things. Holo us better in my opinion but ACOG isn't realy bad on him. if you like to hold long angles of course
---
The FO12 is OK...

The sound it makes however scares the literal Shit outta me

How could it be a new meta? You could do it with Monty and still call it ‚Äúa new meta‚Äù lmfaoo.

How much does Siege require? I think that Destiny required 5 down and 2 up to work as it should.  Ping just tells you the delay theres from server.
---
Oddly looking into what it comes with it says " It includes the instant unlock of 20 base operators (without grinding)" along with " All 24 Post-Launch Operators from Year 1,2 and 3". Maybe you are ment get them and it's a bug?

Play ranked it's going away in there not cas

Definition of low effort post
---
I'm fairly certain I saw this glitch on youtube once.
---
I paid ‚Ç¨60 for the year one gold edition in August 2016. It came with the year one pass and it was just the release of capitao and caveira, having to wait for echo and Hibana. The edition didnt come with the base operators and the unlock system was the same, you're complaining about $40 for all seasonal operators to date and the inability to unlock a few base operators which are easily achieved by PLAYING. 
---
Pick two operators, play a few casuals and unlock a base operator, rinse repeat. Be thankful not hateful.
---
I've had this happen it's an irrecoverable down
---
Its actually a very...very rare bug

I've had it maybe twice in 2500+ hours

Where is the Kaid's Cla.. oh wait..

no

remember when her scorpion was good?? Mhm. Elas fo12 has been nuts since it came out. Remember when it first came out and had NO damage drop off and you could snipe people at 15 meters plus?? still happens it just takes more bullets now which isn‚Äôt a problem because she has 60 of them :) fuck the fo12 make the scorpion great again

New message from Ubisoft: Delete this
---
Firstly why did you downvote xdd secondly I usually see bronzes get scared and shoot somebody
---
Now I'm confused, because you seem to be contradicting yourself. You seem to be saying that good players don't care about a DMR's higher damage per shot when they aim for the head, and also saying bad players need a higher cycle rate so they can get lucky and hit their target in the head.
---
I was under the impression that luck was generally bad in a competitive game, which is why Hostage and Secure aren't treated as competitive gamemodes.
---
If Dok's DMR was as bad as you think all DMR's are, wouldn't the reaction have been "hey, Dok's guns are trash" instead of "hey, Dok's MK14 is busted?"

---
@ the artist?

I believe he put down a claymore and it blew up and killed him but didn‚Äôt kill an enemy
---
Do you see pro players use dmr in pro league or even when they are playing rank? ( other than on dok because it‚Äôs the only option). It‚Äôs not about luck, if you shoot more bullets you have more chances to hit the head, nothing about luck. 
---
Dok dmr is not bad nor broken it‚Äôs okay, it does the job. But like I said if she had a full auto option people would play the full auto weapon.
---
Dont know

Oh no! I don‚Äôt have the validation I seek from a fellow redditor! Whatever shall I do?

Cav in casual training gear with an animation that doesn‚Äôt involve her knife or gun isn‚Äôt what people wanted

4v5 is not that much of a disadvantage, especially in bronze play

They have already put Glaz his grave as well!

Hmmm the thing is the Fo-12 is a balanced gun already. Them nerfing it now is complete bullshit. It is the 3rd lowest damaging shotgun at CQC. overcomes some shotguns at mid range and long range after that though.But... Big but here. Has a wider spread than most shotguns, meaning you're doing less damage at range compared to the other shotguns that have tighter more accurate spreads. Combined with higher recoil compared to the other primary shotguns the FO-12 is the most balanced shotgun in game. The only positive trait it having the highest fire rate of all shotguns asides a double barrel compensates for the low damage. The recoil and spread though countering it for range. it is a balanced gun already. Ela didn't need this 9th nerf.
---
Which ones would you class 'P2W'?
---
I would do anything to get the old Glaz back!
---
I don't have a problem with someone playing cav, but if you're playing her on 2-2 match point, not even trying to reinforce, and going across the map in two seconds then you are the worst type of person
