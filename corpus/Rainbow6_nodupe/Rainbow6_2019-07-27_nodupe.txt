I'm pretty sure clash and mozzie have Glocks? Unless clash has a Glock ripoff. But I know mozzie is using a Glock with a Roni carbine kit on it
---
---
---
Trick shot finial kill?
---
No I ain't wrong, and no one's asking for 1 site between me and site, but having a map with too many rooms are just generally bad. Hereford, Theme Park, Fortress, all of these maps are good examples of just being way too big for their own good.
---
Yeah sex is cool but have you ever killed someone with a evil eye?
---
Sorry I'm new to rainbow what is the gun name in game?
---
I've been seeing this a lot more since shields got nerfed.
---
Tbh it sucks, but its better than the two front spawns. Either hug the wall to your left and hold the angle or run behind the truck to the right.
---
Opinion: I personally think that Endgame was a little too long as a movie
---
Wheres Ark on this? Ive met some real special kinds of toxic on there
---
i thinnk theres a hidden mmr like ranked but that we can‚Äôt see it‚Äôs either that or rank but idk
---
This was the last thing I expected before clicking on this.
---
Skyscraper is full of run-outs. Even with Nomad seems uncomfortable to me
---
Love the unique idea, I feel like it could really fit!
---
hahah my bad dude ahaha
---
fortress is perfect, theme park and hereford need a rework
---

---
fortress is perfect because it really requires you to play strategically, rather than just ‚Äúrush into site‚Äù
---
Just buy better headphones 4head
---
But rly where can i get that key chain??
---
Yep
---
How long have you been saving?
---
It's just toxic
---
I feel like this would be better on defending tho.

Very nice idea

---
It's a ingame menu background from Y1S1. The game used to have these and they were great!
---
I'd say for almost a year, probably, a while ago at like 300K I bought 50 alpha packs and dropped, haven't bought them since
---
Sorry Im already in a clan
---
Don't worry about it xD
---
It's fine :)
---
So here is a thing: Cav and Vigil are Defenders.
---
As Roamers, they can be anywhere in the map and attack from many different angles. Their stealth mechanics help them to flank/hold angle against oncoming Attackers.
---
Now let‚Äôs look at their strength.
---
Cav‚Äôs strength doesn‚Äôt really come from her being quiet. It comes mostly from her interrogation which exposes everyone‚Äôs location and give a massive advantage to her team while that‚Äôs happening. Vig‚Äôs strength comes from having a pretty decent guns. K1A is very reliable. Attackers who rely on drone to enter rooms might decide to go other way just by his presence. 
---
Nokk might have a similar gadget as those two but she‚Äôs an Attacker. She‚Äôs the one entering the map and going to obj so her position and angle options are far more limited. 
---
If you want to compare Nokk to someone, you have to compare her to the other Attackers, namely the flankers.
---
Ash, Mav, and IQ are currently far more efficient than Nokk. There‚Äôs very little reason for Nokk being picked over other Attackers in her current state.
---
Clutching doesn't make an operator good. 
---
Clash is just bad.
---
If you want to contact me add me via psn TheMenaceTrickz1

Hereford or skyscraper(ik not on the list here)
---
There is a hidden mmr. My casual one is shit so I‚Äôm a high gold going up against low levels but in ranked I am going against people my level.
---
I‚Äôm a noob
---
IMO:
---
Top 3 that should be removed:
---
1-Hereford Base
---
2-Skyscraper
---
3-Fortress
---
We are getting a rework for Theme Park in Y4S4, so they should keep it, even though it's not my fav map
---
Oh my a acorn for a head elite skin gonna be good! &lt;:3
---
What if you could put them through walls to rat out the ones in the corner? Do you think putting them in reinforced walls is too much?
---
It's always an accomplishment to get your first ace. I still remember mine.
---
Why does frost have an underarmour sponsor deal
---
I have honestly been thinking of buying a xim apex just so I‚Äôm not at a disadvantage to everyone using an mnk because in the higher ranks there are more people using it then not.
---
Does this mean that her face has a larger hitbox than most of the other ops?
---
Now they can not use it because you can sue them legally for taking your idea without permission
---
Patch notes my friend, patch notes
---
Goddamn that‚Äôs unlucky hope that you get good teammates so maybe you could get diamond.. Who knows?
---
is great.
---
Warden and clash use a cz p10c. It's an actual gun, not just a renamed glock
---
I ban blitz 100% of the time. No exceptions
---
We won't be getting new weapons anymore, 
---
https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/gaming/rainbow-six-siege-phantom-sight-isnt-adding-new-weapons-find-3764329
---
Literally all of us are trolls.
---
Less canisters would play
---
totally agree, with a terrible report system.
---
Thanks! How much does the operator‚Äôs dlc improve the gameplay? It‚Äôs very pricey. R6S is only $11 rn tho
---
Interesting
---
F
---
It seems heavily tied to rank. I'm new to PC but on Xbox I'm a plat 2 and there's basically no toxicity up there but on PC I'm around gold and the amount of toxicity I've experienced from people who doesn't even know basic mechanics is unbelievable. I honestly have avoided playing PC unless I have a full stack because of how toxic it is. It's also a lot easier to communicate on PC so it's easier to be toxic. If I'm on a smurf on my Xbox I'll get some toxic messages but it easy enough to ignore but on PC I have to mute a lot of my team and the enemy if I want to avoid it.
---
That would put us at 0% toxicity.
---
Hm. TIL i guess.
---
It's not just a renamed Glock, it's a CZ P10c. It's designed to use the same holsters as Glock, which is why they look similar.
---
Better for me
---
Oh no... It's retarded...
---
Precisely
---
It's a game, the goal is to have fun. When your play style sucks the fun out of the game for other players, it is toxic.
---
I like the new one, she actually looks Japanese
---
And I strongly disagree on every point you've made here.  
---
Frustrating? It's your fault for getting spawnpeeked, there are many ways to avoid spawnkills so you have 0 excuses.   
---
Cheap? How is it cheap? Requires 0 skill? Excuse me? You need timings, you need aim, you need recoil control, and you need game sense, when to stop and when tu rush. We both have no idea about how the game was meant to be played, so Imma just gonna skip that. Who are you to say how things are intended anyway?  
---
Toxic? Nowadays people call everything ''toxic''. It is not toxic, it is not toxic that you got killed and you're the only one to blame.   
---
And finally, it angers me that so many people are upvoting the noes that call this ''toxic'' ''asshole'' etc, and downvotes the ones with ACTUAL facts about why spawnpeek is ok.
---
Awesome idea. Maybe a shotgun option as well?
---
Sounds like more war crimes üòÇ
---
Should be an orbital laser that obliterates the whole building
---
I‚Äôll probably get a bundle then after that bundle I‚Äôll probably just save up as many packs as possible
---
The only thing i would change in casual it the timer, maybe like 20 seconds lowered.
---
Opinion: you're\* the reason that reddit is filled with retards.
---
too much good things on an operator, make that ops op.
---
speed is god in this game, nades are the best addons, you can't give a speed 3 every tool in the game
---
Sooo basically mustard gas without the rapid death?
---
[I mean it basically is one of those, just tougher](http://b.bimg.dk/node-images/512/3/620x/3512030-svrnets-frmandskorps-rs-jubilumsarrangement.jpg)
---
If it could work like fuze and not just be a grenade that would be awesome
---
Pair him up with lion and dokkaebi and you have perfection.
---
Gears of War would be top 3 if it was more popular on PC lol
---
Another Geneva convention violator. Nice
---
as dota2 player with more than 6kh timeplay , i think you're wrong .
---
Ha
---
Me and him play together quite a bit and we never fail to hit a clip especially him though
---
These comments be getting spicy.
---
Spawnpeeks aren't toxic, you should preaim and prefire the most common locations for them. You not doing that is being unprepared and your fault. And I had a guy tell me spawnpeekers "don't have skill" even though you literally must have fun skill to kill a person in the minimal amount of time you expose yourself for.
---
You leave your team with 1 less to prepare the objectives, you make everything slower and you risk yourself to get killed, leaving the game in a 4v5.   
---
It is fair, you're just mad because you probably get spawnkilled a lot.
---
I‚Äôm basically his hype man at this point
---
Immediate run out indicators would help.
---
Its worth the time. I also like to buy bundles if they interest me. But dont buy them that often, but saving to like 25 and buying 25 is great
---
Thanks man, I just played a game and now I‚Äôm in plat for the second season in a row. I have a five stack of plats so we‚Äôre all carrying our weight lol.

In all reality... lion should be completely immune to smokes gas clouds
---
Good idea, Too bad they‚Äôll probably come up with something useless and just rehash guns that are already in the game lol
---
Neat idea but honestly seems rather useless. Its basically a super sprint and nothing else. Also kinda lacks a "hunting" feeling, since well, you probably wouldnt want to encounter anyone during it.
---
Well damn, would that include the van vault into balcony for Oregon aswell???
---
Im not saying I need acog bc I rarely play anyone on defense with an acog but I agree with you. I get angry when ppl deadass only use acog to get kills.
---
Exactly spawn peekers aim at head level
---
I understand it's hard to differentiate. But if you can't tell me who it was I was playing with that was cheating, I can't do anything to avoid it. I can guarantee I didn't play with the person many different times, more than likely it was just one set of many games in a row. Like I said, I play in the official rainbow six siege discord. I can't do anything about it if a cheater joins and we play 10 games together. If I know they cheat, I leave. But it's not that easy to tell, especially if they are a closet cheater. It's a team game and this just makes it more difficult to group with others. If I had to play this game solo, I wouldn't play it. 
---
Overall, I'm just disappointed in the support I received. From what I've experienced, it doesn't feel like Ubisoft actually cares about the community and you are taking the easy way by banning people without the opportunity to reverse the ban. If Ubisoft actually looked into my case, I can guarantee I didn't play with the cheater many different times.
---
And here I was thinking a tinker's advice pays kindness twice
---
They get annoyed because they refuse to accept they're the only ones to blame for not paying attention, or simply for being bad, that is a real fact, what you are giving is simply excuses of someone who gets spawnkilled on a daily basis and refuses to adapt and accept that you've made a mistake.   
---
Now go commit neck rope and stop wasting my time.
---
Not year one but the free ones.
---
Your cousin is an absolute piece of shit. The single reason why this community sucks.
---
Rewatch that and TELL me he‚Äôs not hacking
---
Hackers have literally killed this game
---
Sorry! üôàü§£ Thanks for your patience!
---
Huh
---
Guns‚Äô performance compared to in-game ones?
---
*thunk*
---
whos going to buy an op who gets nerfed? that's why the waited on ela.
---
Oh yes. Can‚Äôt think of any more comebacks so I‚Äôm ‚Äúwasting‚Äù his time. Just go try to find a ranked match that doesn‚Äôt ban echo. That will really waste your time dumb fuck
---
Mute was the only Op that it didn't affect; it would cause damage to all other teammates.
---
He constantly TKs for the dumbest reasons
---
Yep, so much so that they wont a soloque mode
---
So like an attacker smoke?
---
What's supposed to be wrong with us?
---
Also, idk if it‚Äôs been said, but you should submit this to r/r6OperatorCreator as well.
---
She probably did not play one of those days
---
Low rpm, great body shot dps, low recoil. High dps, average weapon. If I was to say what its closest too, picture a slow firing maverick m4
---
Me
---
This sounds too overpowered tbf. It's pretty much Dokkaebi, Ela and even a little bit of Lesion combined.
---
no, I bought standard edition on disk
---
Add this and tenno. Those are my favorite community made fan ops. Also (just an idea, probably stupid) it would be cool if it like, if you threw it at a soft wall or barricade, it attached and deployed out the other side.
---
all original year one ops come with the game free now
---
Maybe we should make it so they can‚Äôt kill anyone cause if they can kill people they‚Äôre ‚Äúop‚Äù 
---
They didn‚Äôt need nerfs to begin with and the nerfs they‚Äôve gotten just make them less fun to play as.
---
I literally just wiped the floor with you right now, and the only think about is, HUhhum, lEts waTch hIs Tag nAme, oH! iT hAs EchO!! lETs lAuGh HaHaHaHa111!!1!!  
---
Stop wasting my oxygen, please.

---
here's the thing ,those games has more toxic people because they have more players. indirectly,more nice people too. but we have very little players compared to those games ,yet almost every encounter is toxic.

So basically, Smoke on Attack but with no hostility of a smoke? Non Lethal smoke nades?
---
Didn‚Äôt know that. But I would recommend lesion. Solid op
---
Oh yeah
---
no, I was just installing the new patch, it stopped, then it uninstalled the game. now my game is digital for whatever reason
---
Ok then i don't know what to tell you then
---
She‚Äôs like the Heisenberg of Terrorism.... I like her being the ‚Äòbad guy‚Äô but loyal to her team. She‚Äôs smart, but she‚Äôs angry
---
Is that Swat?
---
Agreed. Console is hella toxic. Played year 1 on XB1. Yikes
---
I am offender.
---
Agreed
---
Yes! I also like the idea of deploying it through a melee hole ( kill hole)
---
what method of faeming are you using?
---
Just an idea but it should make whoever in the smoke randomly fire their gun, since it causes involuntary movement
---
If I‚Äôm wasting your oxygen, please, be my guest and go hang yourself
---
I love it.
---
Thank you!
---
.
---
Ideally shouldn't gas mask operators like sledge, mute, Thatcher, finka, and lion be immune to this also? I know they aren't immune to smokes canisters but wouldn't that be a neat addition?
---
Hmmmm maybe :)
---
Sounds like a g idea
---
First, you must coming to yourself if you want to embark on this long journey
---
Second, you must make a pilgrimage to the Holy City Moscow and find the upside down R
---
Third, upon finding this upside down R you must sit and pray to the Lord for 28 days and Nights
---
Third, Upon the morning of the 29th day the Lord will come down and give you his blessings to touch the 3 dots at the top right of this subreddit and allow you to change you user flair
---
Yeah but those are glitches that Ubisoft patches out this spawn peek has been in the game since day one, and you‚Äôre not tricking the game into giving you an advantage
---
a defensive op w 3 speed cant have acog bc they can change postions/ angles quickly and they can have advantage of range. and spawn peeking goes hand and hand with that, so they got their acog removed to balance out power
---
Yes, I too would like this, but being completely immune could imbalance pick rates. There should still be some negatives
---
I like it. I‚Äôd use this op. I‚Äôd replace one of the pistols with an R8 though
---
This is really a great idea, I doubt Ubi's gonna do something about it, but overall a great idea.
---
Give him 3 and make the area of effect and rate of spread similar to capitaos arrow
---
Doesn‚Äôt that give Tinker an advantage? Lol, cuz Warden will run into it unknowingly.
---
Most spawnpeeks are runouts now at this point. If your team has multiple people dying to spawnpeeks then theyre just bad or werent paying attention. It isnt hard to counter them at all. You die because of a lack of info and rarely die to "he has an acog reeee" Skyscraper is just a bad map. If people runout on coastline youre most likely not in a higher tier of play. A spawnpeek on coastline? Sure but a runout will not happen very often. Idk what youre rank is or what you play in but from your arguement it seems you dont play in the higher tier of players. Maybe youre going against smurfs etc that are just outright better than your team idfk.
---
My god the prophecy is true, thank you fellow Russian brethren
---
Congratulations on missing the point entirely.
---
Now don't get me wrong man, it's an excellent idea. And the fact that you're so open to criticism and willing to make adjustments instead of just writing everyone off is awesome. I don't typically comment on these operator concept posts because they're usually too ridiculous to actually implement in the game, or they would be incredibly broken. The reason I made my suggestions was because this is something I actually would really like to see in game, and I hope the devs pick up on the idea. But if we're going to talk about implementation, then we gotta discuss proper balancing and how the overall meta would be changed based on her kit. Truth be told, you don't have to take any of my criticism, and maybe I'm entirely wrong. But I'm coming from the standpoint of how I would feel if I were killed by a team running Sledge, Buck, Finka, and Tinker. 
---
But overall, you have an excellent concept here. That's obvious based on the amount of upvotes and comments you got. Keep up the good work buddy. :)
---
He can see through it of course but I still wouldn‚Äôt advise standing directly inside
---
This says you're A HERETIC
---
You got it
---
i thought this was an ad for an app that helped you find a gym partner. that icon looks like a barbell chief
---
Jokes on the guards once castle barricades them inside with the aliens.
---
What the Blin....... Another believer?!?!!?!
---
More like Montagne/recruit/tachanka
---
And what would that be?
---
Thank you! And it would be no fun if I didn‚Äôt include everybody, if everyone likes it and it‚Äôs balanced, maybe we could see it in the game one day! There are more reworks being brainstormed, and an updated version is in the works.
---
I have heard more slurs in a R6S match than i'd hear at a KKK rally. I've gotten TKed, sworn at, insulted, vote kicked, etc.
---
great idea, but the amount of yellow whistles seems a bit much. i also think that for a secondary gadget, instead of frags, maybe barbed wire or a smoke to go with the theme.
---
I mean Nokk Herself Is Lazy. She's just an empty character with Vigil x cav abilities with reused guns. No bio or any background.
---
Because people hate people in siege
---
Always make sure in drone phase that you drone out your path you will be pushing in from. Also redrone before you push that as well. What operators do you main and how much game and map knowledge do you know
---
I‚Äôve... walked into a smoke cloud as a teammate and I was fine?
---
~~I think I was mute I think and I‚Äôm quite new to the game so don‚Äôt quote me on that~~
---
That's such a cool idea like lion and Nomad you could get object!
---
1 question could you defuse with the effects active?
---
This would probably kill you more often than any gadget
---
His ‚Äúmale child‚Äù üòÇ
---
Bro, that‚Äôs awesome
---
Of course, and the lean mechanic was removed, the only mechanics are listed as of above! :) 
---
The primary is a custom made Lightweight M4, Stings unique weapon. It has a slow RPM, meaning low recoil, but a small magazine, with high bodyshot damage, it averages out. 
---
The secondaries are a police Issued Glock (type unknown) and a USP - 45. Exact damage and stats cannot be determined as there are no way to test it in game :)
---
yeah he is trash but good thing he you did not learn him to play the most shit game in the world fortnite
---
Honestly siege is full of the loneliest dudes I've ever met. They don't even use virgin as an insult because it's too sensitive of a topic.
---
Oh shoot. I didn‚Äôt see the new changes.

Hello MeW777WeM, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cicg5k/blitz_shield_glitch_will_ads_instantly_if_aiming/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You could, but you would be making a lot of sound doing it :) I think saving the vials just for blocking the bomb would be unfair, since the effects last so long.
---
You a troll boi
---
Thank you :)
---
Lol rip we were about to win.
---
Yes for me, everyone in my game just disconnected.
---
Why is a 6 year old playing a video game like this anyways?
---
Can they trigger traps through walls
---
Same
---
We were about to win my dude.
---
Ash, ying, blitz, gridlock kinda
---
Now we can finally take our jager acog bacc. Good job xdd
---
It was 3-4 in mine
---
Its beautiful
---
Any device that takes away either sight or movement is an instant no and taking away something as integrated into movement as leaning is being questioning.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right.
---
so just iq but with an op ability that serves exactly the same function as twitch but poorly?
---
What map?
---
The rework was recently updated, thanks to community input. Check it out! :)
---
Eh. It's not exactly money grubbing either. It's a game for adults that tries for the most part to be realistic.
---
That's like saying the airbus A320 being in a fight simulator is money grubbing. It's just realism
---
Clubhouse
---
Omg were u in our game? I was ghostn07.sppg
---
Sense of humor &gt; any sense of decency for most guys
---
Yes, as long as he is within a certain range. So he still has to be really close to the trap
---
placenta pastry
---
Just not so large ;)
---
Typical Ubisoft changes
---
Another reason why im thinking about not playing anymore
---
Especially those Over complicated Operators getting suggested by the community
---
but his gadget shouldn‚Äôt just give him a free kill, there should be some skill that goes with this gadget, i mean he already has 4.
---
Because Fortnite is dog shit
---
I saw tinker and my Dota mind was thinking, can this operator shoot lasers, missiles and rearm his gadget.
---
Where can I sign up
---
Yea. Like maybe a new gamemode with no renown or ex rewards but all operators are unlocked. That wpuld be really cool. I bought dokkabi a few days ago and she fits my playing style horably so now i am down 20k renown and have an operator im never going to use. Also i know i spelled her name wrong i just dont remember how to.
---
Perhaps in overtime ;)
---
OMG IT WAS THE SAME GAME I WAS ONE OF THE 3 CHICKEN GUYS
---
Then maybe she should start  banning Lesion and she won't get hit by gu's every game
---
Reminds me, on a casual outback match one of the people on my team was an 8 year old on his dad‚Äôs PC (he was voice chatting)
---
He went 8-2?, survived all 3 rounds, got the ace
---
Yeah i thought since we had defuse that if i gu'd it would mean that they would have to waste time removing the gu in order to plant. :D
---
Lmao dude rip.
---
Woops
---
LMFAO.  Maybe it was a contained issue then
---
Fr
---
I didn't know German WW1 soldiers were in Seige
---
When these kids hyper focus and try very hard they can do work on careless players^
---
Would you like to work on making this operator? I can help you if you like.
---
Thing is if you tell people not to do this, then you yourself get ridiculed for being a ‚ÄúNice guy/ White Knight‚Äù. Like, no, I‚Äôm just a decent human being with common fucking sense. Jesus.
---
Clearly not, but they are some fine examples of situations that the game isn't aware of and so the penalties should not be laid down as such, there should however be adjustments to the mmr won and lost in matches where a team had less than 5 players.
---
I think it was just our game
---
I think this works great as an attacker, but if this ended up as a defender it would be extremely overpowered
---
I thought the icon was a barbell and the operator was just ripped
---
That would be ideal. Just jacked. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the ‚Äòbuff‚Äô :)
---
Idk I might get a lucky black ice
---
Are we talking about the same Famas?
---
Involuntary movement? That seems like a potentially awful game mechanic?
---
OP, very.
---
It was removed. The rework was uploaded not too long ago.
---
Damn i watch Marley and he gets black ice for each handgun after like 20 packs
---
I think some do it just so they aren't accidently shot again. Others just want you to die.
---
Rework was uploaded not too long ago :)
---
Very toxic, but very cool
---
Since his gadget is frequency based, Mute will be a good counter the operator.
---
To me it looks like you shot right over his head. Nice kill btw.
---
Depends on the situation. Peeking? Yes.
---
and since when did kids start playing r6
---
"Why were you screaming last night?"
---
"Fucking Ash!"
---
You‚Äôve been exposed **( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)**
---
well, I'd say hibana imo since she can open walls by herself and push from it. Also she has a great gun though low on ammo, but the bearing 9 smg is there when you don't have the time to reload.
---
Probably cause you had the game from the start like it says?
---
Here's my point of view. Spawn peeking doesn't work against highly skilled players. But its highly effective against noob players who don't know the map well and don't know how to counter it. If you spawn peek you are essentially try harding against noobs. The new player died without not having much of a chance to react and has t koi stare at the screen for the rest of the round. 
---
I used to hate spawn peekers, but i adapted and learned how to counter and how to spawn peek myself. Now spawn peekers are just a free kill to me if im on the attacker side. However i still don't like spawn peekers, because for reasons mentioned above it does nothing but enrage new players and drive them away from the game.
---
H-65
---
V-50
---
My friends think I‚Äôm crazy playing with that low of a sensitivity but I feel like when I crank it up I miss a lot more.
---
Yeah definitely, I feel like mutes getting better
---
Reminds me of the Brooklyn 99 episode where Holt got the mumps
---
I guess his gu is mined
---
Well Ubi has a long to-do list and stuff like this isn't a priority, which is fine, we can't have IQ sliding or Clash shield baiting rampantly. I wonder if siege will ever be exploit-free.
---
[removed]
---
Opinion: your part of the problem
---
Because it was a poll with weak parameters. If the survey doesn't specify what counts as X you'll get people attributing to X things that shouldn't count and not attributing things that should. These polls are left way too opinionated to be any good.
---
Ex. Someone say ""GG 2ez" after a game? Someone could consider that harassment.
---
I feel like if you're roaming it can have some advantages, but if you're an anchor and holding an angle I think the enemy would be able to shoot you first (unless they have bad reaction times).
---
Difference is IQ can detect all electronics while this op can only detect electronic traps (and yokai drones). Also IQ can have her pistol out when using her scanner.
---
oh and btw it dosent help you with the hipfire its the same thing and plus it gets in the view when you aim so it makes it harder to aim too i really dont see a reson to use a laser sight
---
Dude I think you‚Äôre in tuxbirds new video
---
Soooo... no head?
---
I don't think so
---
Do you solo queue? Or play in a stack?
---
I know right. I mean if the person is genuinely trying then I wouldn't kick, I'd just throw an advice for future rounds. 
---
I think the kick should only be there for toxic player who would ruin the experience for others. Also the people who just call you out for not playing the way they want you to cuz they died first.
---
Horizontal - 90
---
Vertical - 35
---
Ads 17
---
Dead zones 7
---
I'm surprised they didn't spawn peek you considering it's plane. Nice ace though!
---
Not a lot of damage but if you stand from start to finish it would only do like 20 total. Otherwise somebody like warden will just sit in it.
---
well on rank, you'd find a lot of people who just want to tell you how to play and just curse because you're not.
---
dude same i get like plats or golds and whatever but im stuck in bronze bcz i always like always get trollers toxic temmates and a enemy team that is full of plats and that thing and always get like bad temmates i always get more kills than them and people call me smurfer blalal
---
Yea
---
None are called glocks.
---
Correct but on some maps you lose lots of time to a pixel peaking spawn camper
---
You really want to be putting them in hard to see spots where the enemy team are likely to push through. Also hiding them in plain sight often works at higher levels as nobody ever expects a random frost Matt out in the open so they don‚Äôt look. Also try to double them up under windows to prevent them from just being shot on vault.
---
... "we did it guys, we're not toxic"
---
I mean... the joke is pretty obvious. Just because Siege doesn't appear in the top 10 in a survey would mean it's decided, Siege isn't toxic?
---
Dead by daylight Clown main I see
---
love it!
---
always wanted an attacking op that was like smoke.
---
maybe someday later we can get lore that smoke and her worked together on the gadget.
---
im pretty sure the beginning of y4, but i could be wrong
---
I dint know the reason but rainbow 6 needs a patch update I headshot a guy then knife him and then it rendered
---
I mean polls are only as good as the actual questions and the variables considered to possibly affect the numbers. And the honesty of the poll as well, both from the participants and the ones carrying out the poll (to not just seek validation of their preconceived opinion).
---
Wtf legit copied siege
---
Ight, I'll show you how to 3 minute Sprint a terrorist hunt
---
Neat. Make it a 2 speed though.
---
Too many 3 speeds and will need the extra hp incase they get shot throwing the gadget.
---
They should have a wind up so you know when they are going to melee and it would take like 2 seconds or something
---
Maybe it could quietly destroy EDDs? You‚Äôd hear the sound of it hitting through the EDD but that‚Äôs not very loud.
---
the issue with flashlights is that they give you away. they‚Äôd never be used in higher level play. it would be nice to see some kind of level-ution tho
---
Your operator is being uploaded now!
---
THE FIRST KILL TONIGHT
---
Ah yes the classic 99% point blank miss
---
I only hate because EVERYONE and their mother do it, leaving one or so people to defend against more attackers, and because of the fact that it's a defend obj, I don't consider offense to be defense
---
(SAY GOODBYE, SAY GOODBYE)
---
I wouldn't necessarily say that. IQ's scanner can be on while she has a pistol equipped and can shoot any electronic gadget.  This op can only scan electronic traps (and echo drones). Has a very short range for his scanner. Not to mention, he is super vulnerable when using his scanner. Also, mute counters his scanner unlike IQ.
---
K it doesn‚Äôt look like a joke at all
---
Aiden Pearce, special ability prevents DDOS and over all fixes the servers hit reg and connection. M1911 and weapon of your choice. Also can do the black out thingy
---
Im roaming more than anchoring, defending
---
That's what he/she gets for playing Clash
---
Dustin?
---
Don‚Äôt really have a name, but I have a gadget. 
---
Basically it would be a defender with four posts that he could place similar to Kaid‚Äôs claw. When to of them are within line of sight the create an invisible laser that pings when it is passed. So when a person passes it creates a marker. I‚Äôd probably make them a 2 speed 2 armor so that they can move during prep but are more focus on holding an area than roaming.
---
Give it another 75 hours until you figure out your drone doesn't need to jump to get up there. Literally just drive up the door.
---
Does the effect deal more damage to nano-boosted attackers, similar to smoke?
---
I'm sorry some people just have a hard time with sarcasm it's nothing to worry about.
---
It doesn‚Äôt deal any damage :)
---
Can confirm this is why I choose to stay silent and watch my teammates get slaughtered.  They‚Äôd be distracted anyway ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
fr? i legit had no idea lmao
---
*Geneva Convention, prepare to be ignored!*
---
Is Live/PS+ free for a month if you sign up or something?
---
I‚Äôd even go so far to say if you get downed with cav alive regardless of who hit you, you get interrogated if you leave.
---
 It really should be removed, it brings more harm then good.
---
The way I'm thinking is it's only equipped for the gun you have out so say if it's on your primary you could switch to your secondary and not worry about you light giving you away
---
Hello Buster197292, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cida9s/need_a_bandit_helmet/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
No server hitting? This was a fair game all things considered
---
Tinker bell
---
I feel the need to memorize where they are every time I see them. R6 is russian sleeper agent brain washing tool confirmed.
---
It really did make Black Ice feel a bit more special though.
---
Your operator will be uploaded soon!
---
Exactly why it should be r6s playerbase is toxic and they give the community more power
---
Fuck you Monty
---
Thank you very much
---
It would look really silly having characters running faster than their normal speed. Also, how would this affect noise produced since 3 armies tend to be louder
---
It‚Äôs very old, but probably my favorite skin in the game. Far better than black ice imo.
---
Okay, then you would have a serious disadvantage in a gun battle. also, if you somehow manage spot an enemy with your flashlight before they saw you, the time needed to switch between weapons, the shot could be gone.
---
That'd work better, just set a proximity to Cav condition when they are downed. Could be exploited though.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a few years now and have never used a mic for the fear of these reasons. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt want to deal with any of that!
---
No STD‚Äôs for me!
---
How would you make these?
---
I actually love this op idea
---
Haha, funny number 69 haha
---
Am I the only one that dislikes boarder? I just find it really confusing and it‚Äôs the only map I haven‚Äôt yet memorized
---
I was wondering about this, interesting. I wonder if it was an issue with all of the cars in every GTA game since III. Some of them look damn near identical to their real life counterparts.
---
Oh yeah, the increased melee length could destroy edds, barbed wire and other things from a safer distance
---
I‚Äôve never seen such skill and aim
---
How so?  The only way it would be exploited is if you ddosed while they are down or something, in which case ddosing everyone at the start would be just as easy.
---
He almost shot me and probly was like, "Oh, almost triggered the hologram!" Buahaha
---
No jokes allowed I see

so because it has the crappy version of a song this is suppose to be funny? or am i missing something?
---
[deleted]
---
I feel like 10 seconds would be too long, is there any other effect that last that long?
---
I don't have an answer for that one xD
---
Isn‚Äôt that like an attacking smoke?
---
Who ever did this is the worst
---
It‚Äôs uploaded!
---
I don‚Äôt know why you would say Siege is dying. The game has some of the highest amounts of daily players  on steam and the devs are dedicated to this game.
---
I will make this now! Expect it soon.
---
Sick.
---
Get better internet lol
---
Haha! Yes! Thanks
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I‚Äôm glad to be on console tbh

Attacker "Cerdita"
---
Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela

She is a 2 armor 2 speed, with a specialized M32 Grenade Launcher  (she only gets 6 shells whenever she is pick) she carries smoke, temperory liquid foam, and low impact grenades for it, that she can switch out at any time until all her charges are gone, she uses an AK-12 primary and an SMG-12 or PRB92, with a claymore or a stun grenade for her equipment.
---
Maybe I'm just oblivious but how do you get harassed in pubg? I've never even talked to anyone in that game ever, let alone had someone be toxic?
---
sometimes when i play for a long time the next day ill see one and immediately think ‚Äúyouve been spotted‚Äù
---
The model had two textures, one without skull paint and one with, for this concept headgear i used the one without.
---
What.....the.......fuck
---
:( trying to make it a whole meme
---
I can hear this image
---
Thx
---
r/dontdeadopeninside
---
This meme is as old as 1.6 shame
---
Very cool meme YOU MADE i KNOW ROLLDOG WOULD NEVER STEAL EVER CAUSE HE IS THE BEST
---
So... Smoke on attack but non-lethal?
---
Like sheep to the slaughter
---
Plot twist. You‚Äôre the one hitting on her.
---
Thanks Hero_mann I love you DIDNT steal this from you nono
---
New Beaulo on the rise
---
i could see this working but rather than a camera or scanner it would have to be a deployable device like a mute jammer or j√§ger ads so that it isnt mobile, with an audible frequency or just being huge to spot, and i‚Äôd say the range of a mute jammer x2
---
Maybe call him Tinkle and have him spray this fluid across the map like a rope
---
d&amp;d nice
---
Guess I‚Äôm old school. Think kids should play outside and use their imagination rather than screen time.But hell ya socom was the shit, loved that game
---
Yeah but that's damage.  According to this, Tinker's smoke wouldn't do damage.
---
Your 6 year old cousin shouldn't be playing this game.
---
I have Never once seen a game like this on pc the 3 years I've been playing it.   I'm not talking about the 6yo playing,  but the opposing team.
---
Each one has their benefits
---
Ela is my personal favorite, her scorpion, although heavily nerfed. Is still nuts at close quarter combat and the horizontal spread is manageable with proper recoil training. Her shotgun is also VERY good for close quarters, and since her pistol has a red dot on it by default you can use it to tap from far away-medium range if you have the shotgun. She has barbed wire and a deployable shield. Her gadget is very good and almost incounterable when entering a site without a thatcher, because even if you know where it is, it could be unreachable.
---
Alibi: Gun is basically a pre-nerfed Ela scorpion,  plus she has a good ability but is easily countered. She had a good pistol kit with the keratos having little to none damage drop off range and a shotgun pistol to make holes and rotations if you decide to not use impacts
---
Vigil: Really good for roaming way off site, however very selfish, if you don‚Äôt pick up a kill or trade off someone your only contribution to the team is possibly a rotation hole. His shotgun is a meme but his carbine is one of best guns on defense for the amount of damage it does added to the minimal recoil it brings, his secondary the CZ has terrible iron sights but has less recoil than the SMG-12, however the SMG-12 is the universally used gun, and its what I prefer too. 
---
Overall Id choose Ela, great for helping the team get a pick and great if you can manage her scorpion recoil.
---
You do realise his gadget is not just about plant denial right?
---
Sure not 100% but around 60-70 for sure
---
Thats pretty good , another cool thing it wpuldve been if the affected op placed his hand on its mouth tryna prevent the smoke getting in its lyngs and thats why he would have higher recoil , but I think that would make ADS impossible
---
IMO the best way to improve warden right now would be to give him the same buff as the just gave glaz, they didn‚Äôt make as powerful as he was but not so bad that he barely had an ability. Making it so warden can move a little more freely while looking through smoke and flashes could give him that little extra boost he needs.
---
Yes I do but why use his gadget when you could j have a good mozzie drone spot with 1 more drone
---
An operator designed to just win 1v1s is a badly designed operator.
---
I have good internet. R6 usually doesn't lag for me but now all of a sudden it starts lagging
---
This reminds me of that one guy who said "We should make all of the divisions be 300 to make the divisions be more representative" So I stacked all of the ratings, noting that 4500 would then turn into Plat 3.
---
Suppressors are terrible in general. You get worse recoil and less damage
---
No, there is just a bunch of games more toxic. But I'm surprised that cs isn't number one.
---
It's pretty shit. The spread is terrible (especially hipfire) and if you run suppressor, because N√∏kk, it deals such low low damage it appears to heal your enemies. Long range is impossible, it's better to use a pistol. 
---
I understand Ubi's decision to get rid of ACOG, but not to give her this gun specifically.
---
It's still pretty bad on Smoke, hence people commonly running shotgun.
---
Have you tried looking for a team through looking for group at all? I've found a few good groups that way and now have a regular squad that I play with.
---
Cuz Yokais are hard to spot and they can stun already, that's already a ton of utility, there's no critical need for plant denial
---
Also it's incredibly infuriating to lose a round cuz echo hid God knows where and just stuns you at the last sec, that's why he gets banned
---
guide? the guide is to outplay the bandit thats tricking it
---
I feel like every operator with a gas mask should be immune to smoke of any kind
---
Idk i was playing lone wolf
---
YOURE NOT ALLOWED TO ONE TAP SPAWNPEEKERS I TOLD U
---
I don‚Äôt think that would help too much. His main problem is his gadget not his weapon. If the turret could shoot through reinforced walls though...
---
Well it‚Äôs not hard to counter a plant deny you just don‚Äôt waste all your time if it‚Äôs a 1v1 and he‚Äôs hiding across the map j start planting it decloaks when disorienting so shoot it
---
Bro ur level 152 and asking a dummy question like this
---
Why shouldn‚Äôt they? This new idea that attackers shouldn‚Äôt have acog is not a good idea. Look at nokk. One of the worst, underused operators there are. Primarily cause her loadout is trash for an attacker.
---
Sure your six year old. I totally believe that.
---
That looks sick!!
---
Ball don‚Äôt lie
---
Mission compeleted
---
+respect
---
Ooooh this looks cool, i think it'd be cool if they could put it against a soft wall and let it fill the other side air or just throw it, kinda like Ying?
---
Wait how can you guys know he is. I'm not doubting I just dont know where the proof is
---
They need to make more ops that affect the map not players
---
I mean, im a 34 year old male and regularly get hit on by people in siege lol.
---
Hello soccer-ball, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ciejhu/too_late_to_go_pro_would_it_even_be_worth_it/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
That happened to me but I was completely upside down.
---
Usually plants are executed at the last few seconds, one Yokai blast is all it takes
---
If the attack planted with 30 sec remaining then it means usually that the defence team is already ruined
---
All we need now is the defending op to go with this one but I would love to see this in the game
---
Honestly, real white knights are pretty rare in this game, because to be a white knight the girl needs to actually be doing *something* bad for said white knight to ignore, like teamkilling, being toxic, etc. In most cases they're just not talking or they're making the rare callout, when one of these wackos comes in and chases her like a wild hyena with the restraint of such.
---
You have to kill 3 in the first round and then kill atleast one per round and try not to be last standing when you can't ace it. Then all the toxic behavior will never hit you
---
Someone or everyone even, send this to Twitter , a community based operator, bruh , if we can make 6-8 operators , thats a whole nother season we can add to the game
---
Nah
---
Ok they‚Äôre sacrificing a player pretty much for 5 seconds off the clock sounds like a fair deal to me
---
Lol as u can imaging I got kicked out of the match
---
K
---
Good job little guy!!!
---
I think color should be changed too. Just because smoke is also yellow. But I like the idea. Nice editing btw

Dota players already hate him

I see you forgot to take the boys off non hostile mode.

Why did you cut the picture? I bet so that noone sees you placed it yourself.

Yes if you read the patch notes :P

Remember when a good gadget was "this motherfucker has a hammer?"

Friends
---
I mean I‚Äôm plat 2, can‚Äôt deny my mmr. So let me get this straight, first your going to hate on my clip, then call me out for apparently ‚Äúacting like I‚Äôm good‚Äù even though the title says it‚Äôs a lucky shot. And after finding out I‚Äôm a plat 2 your now gonna say get a life? You‚Äôre trying really hard to hate man, keep it going
---
I always figured a lost connection should have an ai take their place. Ai are much worse than humans as seen in t hunt, it makes it so you can still get an interrogate and gives the team who lost a player for whatever reason a very slim but fighting chance. 
---
Dbno would notatter because as soon as you leave an ai takes your place and you have a downed ai instead.

You forgot to add the ‚Äú*.....*‚Äù

Exactly. We need more of these community made operators.
---
They have fixed it tho, im on xbox and when you start an interrogation and they leave, it still continues as if the player never left. Ofc if the player leaves before you start interrogating there is no way to interrogate him but I see it rarely since you cant join back ranked games ATM on Xbox so idk

Yea seems about right. I don‚Äôt play overwatch much at all but during my placements gold players who think they are good were the most toxic while silvers didn‚Äôt really give a shit

Spawn peeking is a part of the game dude
---
Is that a kap-45 as secondary?!
---
I gently open the door...
---
True but it doesn‚Äôt hit numbers like the other games do. It‚Äôs very popular but it‚Äôs a tier below the LoL, Overwatch, Dota, Fornite games. Those games have 500k+ active players at all times and games like LoL and Fortnite probably has like 5 million plus
---
Um, what does that mean...? Genuine question.
---
My only problem why I absolutely hated OW is because people think they're such hot shit when they pick DPS over everything else and they do shit at their jobs .
---
Like PLEASE feels like I'm literally the only healer in the entire "community"

I was saying the same thing the only people that can counter spawn peaking is our selves 
---
Just don‚Äôt go to where the spawn peak is or wait till there gone and drone
---
Ya spawn peaking is a strat in the game.
---
I had a 13 year old or something in one of my matches and he was calling me poor because I didn‚Äôt plug a mic in lol. I mean this was on apex but kinda the same thing with the toxicity. 
---
Oh and I got a purple armor and he was like halfway across the map and kept saying he wasn‚Äôt going to pick me up because I ‚Äústole‚Äù it lol. 
---
It‚Äôs probably one of the only times I‚Äôve been toxic to a teenager who wouldn‚Äôt stop singing some annoying song in the mic lol. He went down so I just t bagged him and ran off, I promise I don‚Äôt usually do that.
---
Oh shit , time to buy Warden
---
You know there are more than 2 types of operators right?
---
Quality post. 
---
Glad to see another example of our fine moderators at work.
---
Actually good idea but ubisoft is recycling
---
Played from gold 3 all the way to bronze mmr and haven‚Äôt experienced much toxicity either. I would say gold is the most toxic. I‚Äôve also noticed there‚Äôs more toxicity towards the other team than your own a lot of the times
---
I just got -20 on my satirical post. Im new so I guess I have to put /s. Im very saddened by this and I feel you.
---
Placements this season was messed up big time. The amount of players who were in Bronze last season who got placed on gold was too much.
---
I think a good way to nerf shields is to not allow shield ops to hipfire. They would have to ads first to shoot.

Nomad is an attacker, nomad is a trap operator

Or ya know. Just actually think and instead of running out into the open, cautiously peek the usual spawnpeeking spots. The only times I've ever been killed by spawn peeking was cause I just wasn't thinking and wasn't expecting it

can you ddos on xbox? because last night i was in a game and my entire team had a huge lag spike where we were about 1000 ping and the other team was completely fine. we still won the round but it was for a good 30 seconds
---
Hang in there buddy!
---
Well I guess I'm recruiting you now.
---
So its kind of like a bio hazard operator? To be honest you should make it so the gadget deals damage so that way people wont run into it and the attackers could get inside and plant without being rushed and is the operator immune to the gas of smoke and its own
---
For sure you hardly ever get killed that easily it‚Äôs mainly you kill them or no one gets killed
---
So are you saying it's showing literal MMR of players? As in John over here might be silver two, but his MMR shows him as Gold 3?
---
Should also be a 2 speed
---
Does it work? If so that would be suick
---
I love the original and I love this one too! Is there a dark version of the mask?
---
Sadly not. But the basement people have experienced a real one!
---
It is waaay too op, too many different effects...
---
Version with .

Point being this is not a Siege problem. It is an online multiplayer problem. A problem that will not be solved ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Bugs bunny : NO
---
Darker as in color or scars and blood?
---
Lmao
---
This is more dangerous than a real Frost mat bro.
---
‚ÄúInvoluntary movement‚Äù should be changed to inverted controls
---
Send them to the ubi dev team amd ask for opinions
---
Imagine having your selfmade operator in the game
---
Weak.
---
Lmao console is a joke
---
Then people should watch out. The pain is huge and terrible
---
r/r6operatorcreator is where this belongs, but it's a nice idea
---
If you hadn't told me it's frost mat, I would of never guessed it.. Sorry, its that bad...
---
Great play
---
Oh thanks, didn't know this sub existed, sorry
---
You would like it with your foot fetish...
---
Of course
---
Anyway i only had 3 colours and a limited amount of lego to work with.
---
&gt;Woe that's great. Literally saying do not give us ideas or we will steal them. Well, a least they're honest.
---
Mmmmm don't like this post
---
Console siege is a completely different game.
---
I was a payday god
---
Your feet wont either when you step on it.
---
Haha. Bloody hell. I realise it's not a siege problem bud. 
---
That's pretty obvious. 
---
I play this game ok. 
---
I've experienced this in this game. Ok? 
---
Therefore reason for my post. 
---
Got it?
---
That could be the problem, cuz it would be easier to see details if it would be bigger and there would be more depth
---
Maybe use a program called stud.io if you are into that
---
Yeah I‚Äôm kind of sad to see that any pasting effects when leaving the smoke was removed
---
&gt;only Smoke is immune
---
literally every operator with a gas mask: Am I a hostage to you or something?
---
I make no profit, it‚Äôs perfectly fine. I don‚Äôt claim they are real, and state that they are concepts.
---
I know but i didnt have that
---
I domt own any sort of pc or have the time to use it.
---
Didn't say its dying, asked a question
---
How did you do the icon art?
---
Its a question
---
haha oh my, ikr? fucking side of the map cliff wards, telling your carry not to farm alone etc goddamn what a chore to play against him
---
Anyone who quits because they die was going to find something else to ragequit for regardless.
---
Says the guy with a big gun as an ability. It‚Äôs called innovation, it‚Äôs fine if you have an open mindset to how easily counter-able it can be.
---
I see your point, I think it‚Äôs dumb that all the SAS have gas masks but only Smoke is immune to his toxic canisters. That‚Äôs the reason Smoke is the direct counter to this concept I guess. I kind of like it.
---
Why isn‚Äôt mute immune?
---
Maybe later you could get more legos and try again...
---
I loved this feature so much! I second this
---
Mute doesn‚Äôt wear a virus filter as high rating as smoke. Thats my smoke is immune to hot canister, but mute can still die.
---
How should I contact you if I have an idea/request?
---
I imagine something very similar to Smoke.
---
I once saw a community made operator that her ability is a Bob that releases sound waves that reveals every operator location within a certain distance from the said bomb. I think that with some tweaks here and there that operator could be a really good one
---
Don't know the name or where to find but I know that the operator is Portuguese and the symbol is a bat
---
It's not because you'll develop violent tendencies or something. Kids exposed to gore might get really bad nightmares etc. There's all sorts of reactions a kid can have you never know hence the rating. Plus in online games there's always toxic people from whom your kid may feel bullied, pick up some swear words etc.
---
You can message me on reddit :)
---
As if Nokk isn‚Äôt just Cav 1.5?
---
Ooohooo were halfway there
---
LMFAO, any competitive game(wether it‚Äôs a video game or a physical sport) needs to be based around the highest tier of competition to survive. So having updates being based around PRO PLAY. Isn‚Äôt something to complain about. 
---
#2) I‚Äôve already stated that 70% of the operators in this game are broken. Low level scrubs won‚Äôt think so because they don‚Äôt comprehend how actually broken they are(not calling you a scrub, just generalizing people‚Äôs views) I say this from firsthand experience, when I first started on this game I thought BB was balanced. LOL he‚Äôs broken asf too. 
---
Now a question for you. Why do you think that patches shouldn‚Äôt be based off of the collective thoughts of the best players to play the game? How would you update a game where your slowly growing a competitive scene, around this scene, without inquiring the pro players?
---
I genuinely like the idea maybe not a 3 speed tho.
---
Your plat 2 because your lucky, I've quit console due to MnK users actually being able to flick on me and due to ddosing happening every time I reach plat 3. Not my fault your toxic ass gets lucky while I don't.
---
I have one question if teammates were to walk into this will it still work on them like a enemy and if any character has a gas mask shouldn‚Äôt they be immune to it as well?
---
Thats rly cool only if ubi would see this and you it because the oporation fatol sight is shit and last where is she (or he) from.??
---
i mean according to this, you have 3 seconds upon entering the smoke to do whatever you wanted before 'engulfed' takes affect, imo the operator is next to trash tier useless.
---
It would be better if the knives just downed and give the operator the ability to interrogate but just with pings instead of real time location
---
You can tell OP is under 10 years old because he put YT in his name.
---
100% yes! So many better choices.
---
HAHAHAHA IM ‚ÄúLUCKY‚Äù? wow you‚Äôre a fucking loser dude, keep blaming your inadequacy on other people and hating on those who are better because you suck. I knew you were a Gold just like the rest of these trash talking shot stains. Get better you guys fucking suck, I play mnk all day and I beat them
---
FFS WHAT 3 seconds is long af before you start getting any effect. Thats enough to mow down the operator and their teammates as soon as you see the smoke.
---
Did you mean frag grenades? If so, I would make them a 2 speed, as no 3 speed in the game has frags. It's one of Sieges rules, like the defender acogs. Also, seems a little op, would recommend nerfing the radius, and removing the insta down. Should do 40-50 damage MAX.
---
No u
---
The only fear I have is that R6 would turn into a COD like game 360 knife throws :D
---
Dead serious. I watched this clip 5 times and clearly they‚Äôre using mnk. Literally 0 recoil, snaps to heads/bodies almost instantly. It‚Äôs textbook mnk. I saw a lot of PC aces today with almost the same reactions.
---
Ur smurfing ur a cunt and fucking up the mmr system you twat!
---
IMO he was close to being balanced as he was a 1 speed, that was the only blitz I could play with.
---
Pistols on console are actually so hard it‚Äôs ridiculous
---
I'm driving in a traffic so I will make it short and point only things of top:
---
- why he grey
---
- tf is this double colored outline
---
- what's wrong with glasses
---
- flag
---
Also - icon reminds me of these shitty Jojo/Initial D memes what is pretty funny and matches cartoon operator
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm stuck in Gold because I‚Äôm unlucky‚Äù no you‚Äôre just trash. I wouldn‚Äôt be getting toxic towards you guys if you‚Äôre dumb Gold asses didn‚Äôt start it yourselves. This was a simple didn‚Äôt meant to do it but it happened video, and all you golds took it as an opportunity to hate on someone who‚Äôs better than you. Fuck outta here
---
Money would be nice Haha
---
Nah it‚Äôs because Doki thinks Mr. Lazy has that fire dick and gives him a break
---
So be it...
---
Never should have come here.
---
Dun... dun Dunn naaa.. dun
---
Clearly you fkin are lucky if your reacting like this ü§£. It's quite funny people like you think their good because they don't know the real toxic side of siege. Oh right, you are the toxic side of siege being this cocky and think your good just because your plat 2? Bruh I bet I could still beat your ass in a 1v1. If you want to I would even actually 1v1 you just to prove you wrong.
---
My god this is awful, why would you post this? The only redeeming factor to this dreadful meme is that it include.
---
Love it
---
Hahaha no I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm good, I think I‚Äôm decent, I still get slapped around by diamonds and plat 1s and I‚Äôve said that already in this thread alone. So lemme get this straight, a trash talking gold who says I‚Äôm toxic for defending myself now wants to 1v1? Kick rocks üòÇ
---
So another op that can create new rush meta no, 10m is alot maybe only behind wall also radius of 10m is to much, like sites are not that big.
---
That is the point. Shields are always going to do well in 1v1 fights.
---
im quitting. Its official
---
Wolfffear's edits gave me way too much hope for the impossible.
---
Ah I see you, your afraid of losing a 1v1 to a gold and now your backing out, sorry my bad your highness I forgot you toxic plats are also pussies. My bad.
---
I love Frenzy, although I'm not sure about it being a drone
---
Tear sounds really cool
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ someone‚Äôs desperate for attention
---
Gta isn't toxic just full of hackers
---
Well, i like it but the name could use a change. It sounds way too much like Finka which could cause confusion and misplays. But other than that a really good idea ‚ô•
---
Not really, casual will always have low queue times no matter what the map selection. If anything, a compromise would be to have a map pool of the fun maps like pres plane, house, kafe, consulate, kanal, oregon, bart u. The actual enjoyable maps to fuck around on and have fun, not like Theme Park or Tower or Skyscraper which are dogshit and not fun to play.
---
If they don't add this I'm going to bring jackal and caveira to track them down, and interrogate them to get this made. (Without the throat slit of course)
---
pretty sure they were wehrmacht.
---
Eh personal preference is jewelry, you can drop into sewers within a second, go to 1st floor and really fast access to first floor obj. Unless obj is basement that‚Äôs the worst place to spawn they always wait for you
---
The newest re work is on my page! Thank you ;)
---
I like the actual changes to the operator but I prefer the previous icon.
---
gypsies arent a race. therefore cant be racist
---
Were they playing with their feet by any chance?

i never used reddit...how everyone have his main op image?
---
Once while playing some t-hunt with friend we were protecting the hostage and there was 1 enemy left. after like 20 minutes of searching the entire map we still could not find him.
---
To say that ms/sony don't support it in general is just wrong.
---
Ya probally
---
Nomad
---
I think that frenzy and boost should switch teams. Frenzy could have special barbed wire, which does more damage, causing blood trails and maybe a bleeding effect. Boost could have a syringe or stim gun like doc.
---
Idot
---
Holy hell. I dunno if he/she's a God tier player in the making, or they found a lobby full of first-time players...
---
The real ending of the game is so hard to get so I‚Äôm just warning you there.
---
Who would've thought that Tachanka only used a huge helmet to hide his missing forehead/scalp. 
---
A genius strategic move made by our god as bullets that enter the top of his helmet will just fly through it, leaving his godly head unscathed.
---
Certain gun appearances can be used without licensing if you change the name. I believe Glock is one of those

---
I used an app called pixaloop which lets you do some flow i pictures :)
---
5 min's later, thats the result.
---
Not sure if you are being sarcastic or not to be honest.
---
I also shared it on ssophiaxx post and tagged him/she before i thought, "hey it will probably get burried under the comments i might aswell make a post out of it."
---
Yeah they were all just standing around a hatch. I don't play t hunt often so i had never seen it, thanks!
---
The good thing is that they‚Äôll go to pc now that he told them to!
---
He is wrong about that but Microsoft (Don‚Äôt know about Sony) specifically say and give developers the ability to allow or block MnK. Ubisoft chose to block it but people still manage to use it because of adapters which trick the console into thinking it‚Äôs controller input.
---
Why would i lie?
---
What isnt real here? Lmao
---
Guys, Epob
---
Toxic, just stop. It ruins the game. I‚Äôm new, only just got ranked and in one of my ranking matches, I got spawnpeeked every attacking round by a 2 plats, a diamond, and 2 coppers, all of whom were smurfs. The coppers played like diamonds, and it was ducking ridiculous. If you play like this, you shouldn‚Äôt play the game.
---
I'd say he's more of a crowd control op than an entry denial op. He's a really good op.
---
It never meant that. It can either mean "Semi" or "Safe", and in this case, I think it's the later, as this gun doesn't have a full-auto mode, so it clearly means "Fire".
---
Are you fucking kidding me? PLs add mroe cancer side effects as if increased recoil wasnt enough. Why no DBNO state while engulfed, discord microphone doesnt work while engulfed, keyboard doesnt work while engulfed. Fck off with these cancer traps

That‚Äôs a very poor example imo. Every person you encountered there just rushed at your shield with zero strat.
---
If anyone is salty it‚Äôs definitely you
---
what
---
I like the idea of a operator who has a really powerful gun and can shoot through reinforcements and Mira windows but only has like two bullets
---
It's a repost from 17 hours ago
---
So is this going to be in the game??
---
Why not switch to PC if you dont like the controller?

I thought this was areal person for a sec

It's more than 15$ for a goddamn elite skin that half of the time isn't even that good.
---
Thank you ! :)
---
So stupid I got that from an alpha pack
---
Wallbanging reinforced walls, wouldn‚Äôt cause a hold big enough to shoot through again but could  go walls until it hits an unbreakable part of the map. Limited shots means you can just wipe the team from the safety of a reinforced wall.
---
Sounds pretty not good. 3 seconds before it does *anything*?
---
Ikr
---
Texas
---
I'm pretty sure this works in that case without sarcasm. Because of it being the truth.
---
Not at all, but I don't think anyone under the age of like ten should be virtually, graphically, killing other people. 
---
Some games like halo aren't as bad because you're fighting a fictional enemy and not your fellow man. Other games like fortnite make the game more cartoon like and gore free, so even though you are shooting at other people, it turns it into more of a paintball match or laser tag experience.
---
But more importantly, it's the online aspect of it. The audience for tactical shooters, as rated, is mature. A six year old should never be exposed to the type of language the majority of us use in this game. Not to mention, especially with this game and how tactical it is, it's not fair for the targeted end user to be stuck with a six year old. 
---
Again, all this goes out the window on local play with family (and preferably a less violent game), but if they log him online and give him a mic, it is downright irresponsible and, in a sense, selfish to put the rest of the team through it
---
Yeah and then when you call for teammates another defender comes and it puts you down like 3 operators
---
Fuck this is some cringey shit. The signature at the bottom is the icing on the cake.
---
what about the emote? how do i get that?

I have seen lvl 200+ in silver. you are a 'good' player when you have reached plat 2 and can stay around there with out 4/5 stacking all the time. kind of depends aswell because being a ranked hero doesnt make you that good either.

no games are exploit free, unless they lack detail. cant count on it :[
---
Well I lost internet 6 months ao which that point of time was also Grim Sky, Now im back. Here are the things I i noticed.
---
  
---
Everyone's banning Jackal, Blitz, Cav, Echo, Clash, Legion. Jackal, Clash, Echo Are the big three.   
---
Nokk pretty good what I've heard  
---
Outback Has alot of plently rooms, I still havent memorized it yet  
---
Kafe is pretty easy to memorize.  
---
Ash acog's removed in the R4c  
---
And I heard rank is harder this time.  
---
Shop got a new facelift  
---
Smoke elite skin is leaked  
---
So yeah
---
And it‚Äôs already been 3 updates since they added it to the test server. Ubi always takes like 2.5x longer then necessary to test stuff just for people to find glitches with it as soon as they add it into full game üòÇ
---
No, there is no way to get them because we are no longer in that season.
---
i just got it when i saw this comment
---
yes i do
---
I once was in a 1v4 clutch situation on this map too back when Ash had her ACOG, I had 4 insane kills and was about to clutch it out when I died *to a Frost*. So I know what it‚Äôs like
---
thx m8
---
No I‚Äôm asking because I‚Äôve seen people that open up packs and get red crow headgear and I know that was only for that season you could purchase it
---
Where‚Äôs the charm 4 years of development
---
Probably because the entire mask isn't the head hitbix, so there is a slight gap between where you shot and the actual corner of his eye
---
This glitch happens way to much.
---
Reee
---
You used to have to spend that much for all the DLC operators and honestly as someone that‚Äôs played the game since the beta 25k is a joke to get. I‚Äôve created secondary accounts that I have almost all the DLC characters unlocked.

It's not a spectator glitch-try it out yourself.  It's an exploit-tap sprint, zoom around the map full speed while being completely silent doing it.  It's been in the game forever, but it's gaining more traction lately.

Go to the main subreddit page, hit those three dots in the top right and change your flair.
---
In what fantasy world are you living where getting headshots in gunfights is equivalent to a spawn peek run out. 
---
There is a lot of strategy and tactics that lead up to that gunfight where someone gets a headshot on you. Did you drone them out? Did you try a grenade but have it zapped by an ADS? Did you try to go around him but find it Castled off? Where you getting spotted by a Black Eye that gave away your position and made it easier for the defender to know exactly where to aim? Did you have a teammate with you to trade out the kill and cover your flank? THAT‚ÄôS the stuff that this game is all about and that‚Äôs fun. When you get ambushed 3 seconds into a round you get none of that.
---
I personally don't like some of the maps in ranked, skyscraper is shit and I never have fun playing on it , I also don't like Hereford, fortress and theme park, it's all personal preference, I could play on coastline and clubhouse And always have a good time but I know some people want variety
---
You have to go to those three dots on top of the page and change user flair

no more i yield i yield

That's literally the only thing you buy in this game though?

Is it different for mobile?

I don‚Äôt even have to watch it. If you care about alpha packs, you‚Äôre super virgin
---
Yep. Very aware of that
---
That was for mobile, well android at least.
---
After 14 common pack in row im actually pissed
---
I feel the same way about those maps, the new base is the worst. But that's not what I meant, I would like to play some maps that are only available in casual, like favela and canal.
---
I thought there was only one Texas ü§î
---
Damn that's sick, if only there was one for echo
---
Tom Brady is in Siege?
---
Elite skin
---
Yeah one dude that left just befor the game started needs to come back into the game this hapend to me about a year ago
---
You can‚Äôt put skins on it, that‚Äôs from the elite skin that you got for free from outbreak
---
Is this related to the chamo or did texas do something stupid so people act like it doesnt exist?
---
Worst part is I might actually end up buying this. Because why not.
---
That's Ash's elite skin . You can only apply skins to gadgets through Elite skins only
---
Today i opened a duplicate for the mp5k i was sad
---
oh right I forgot, thanks
---
im really new to the game and it happen to me about 3 times before like is this game broken ?
---
I was about to say, "it's the ELITE skin" but everyone beat me to it ü§£
---
Thanks
---
Nah just ubi troling us
---
Nice!
---
You'll be glad to learn that (I think) one of the incoming attacker will have a grappling hook or clibbing ropes, only through hatches IIRC.
---
Ok I'll keep that in mind
---
She is Smoke's outbreak skin
---
It‚Äôs probably a 5 stack and since there were 2 coppers it balanced out with a bunch of golds
---
These Amazon Prime delivery drones are getting out of hand...
---
Would it be ok if i made this my screen saver?
---
Ok
---
Lol
---
When a smoke or flash bang happens his glasses automatically activate and then had a cool down period
---
they should fix this already lol
---
Pick rate + 1%
---
It's an interesting idea to dim all other footsteps exept those you scanned! I'll write that down, thank you! I think the ability to scan the same operator manually every 10 seconds (time can be changed) 5 times in a row is pretty much what we have now. It just means that now you have to commit to it, use all of your gadget to pin down one roamer. Isn't this better/balanced?
---
Please
---
Thank you! My idea is that it'll work both ways, but travelling upwards on the zipline will be a lot slower than going down. Also, they won't be able to fully traverse the zipline if something in the way
---
No no, you don't get a charm for 17500, you get the entire state of Texas
---
How about we try out some new gun ideas to help ubi?? I know there's gotta be a subreddit for gun experts to help give out some ideas that maybe they'd like in a gun. Maybe mix some together. Idk just a fun idea since I dont see those often.
---
What in invisible cosmetic over infation?
---
Well my gameplay is pretty out here f my hand as I can't just make a pact with Satan to make me do extremely well out of nowhere and I'm on console
---
Welcome to rainbow 6 seige the same thing happened to me took over an hour for the other team to forfeit
---
Cheap
---
That could work, the problem I had was with button mapping on console, this would solve that problem
---
Ok Ill try that thanks
---
Cool, and yeah I saw that the minimum level for ranked now changed to 30, so that and the picknban thing changed ranked alot
---
cursed
---
Don't worry, it'll bend right back.
---
Thank you
---
Man looks like one of the Club Penguins
---
New Update: Ela's weapon only straightens out when the sexy operators are near by.
---
That's awesome! I think in practice a climbing rope through hatches is easier compared to a grappling hook, and it's not as easily exploitable. Having a proper zipline would be cool though.
---
Shit I missed the know
---
Yeah so his ability button he deploys smoke grenade that are a different colour to the normal ones so it is easier to decipher if there is a warden on the team
---
Oh baby an ace oh yeah. Yeah I can see where your coming from lol

They're being saved to my videos folder, also i would copy it to desktop and it gives me the same error... but funny enough the issue goes away after restarting my computer, like right now I can edit them and save. Maybe it doesnt allow editing when game is running? IDK but its annoying
---
I guess
---
Lmao, that's what I was thinking.
---
HAHAHAHA FUNNY
---
That's neat.
---
wDyM, thErE IS a cHArm thErE

I think they can run an animation on barricates without running physics to solve this issue.

But yeah sneaking in and setting foot on a frost mat would be hilarious :)

---
Boosters and grinding are the best ways to get ops. Always do challenges for easy reknown. Never pay money for ops when you can get boosters instead. If your friends use boosters simultaneously, it increases your reknown even further. I had a four stack with boosters active once and we were getting about 1000 reknown per win.
---
Yep pretty much

But it‚Äôs TEXAS!

---
That's what I thought too, that's why I thought this sniper would be nice as its slow rate of fire would allow only one spawnpeeking shot. Two operators next to eachother can easily trade the kill and gun him down, or he wouldn't even land a kill if he shot a shield operator.   
---
It's also worth mentioning that his secondary is a taser so there is a certain range in the middle that he cannot easily handle. I think of him as a "High risk, high reward" kind of operator.
---
I‚Äôm working up some anxiety over that picture! Really well done though
---
why did you do that? im so sad atm.

That‚Äôs a real copper 4 thing to say. Hibana is brought on maps like bank and clubhouse because there are a lot of hatche she can open. Thermites better for big walls like server walls on bank or the Armory wall on border or the Master Bedroom wall on Villa. They have advantages and disadvantages.

It was funny for like a week or two but now you so much as mention "Lord Tachanka" and you drown from all the upvotes, it's fucking stupid. Shit becomes unfunny the more it's used but it's essentially the only meme this fucking sub uses because nobody knows when to quit beating a dead horse.

I came here for good plays, operator art, and cosplays, not dead memes.

i think when theyre first uploaded it takes a while for the higher quality options to appear. is it stuck on 360 or something?
---
Honestly I think its half of the problem. Iv realized xbox is the problem a lot of the Times. Usually if I get booted more then once I do a hard reset and  usually goes back to normal. Problem is this happens way too often for a game that has been out for 4 years
---
Oooh that would be cool, I‚Äôm a sucker for face masks tho like when that added the Mira w her face covered I was all over it, same with jackals I love face masks
---
I feel bad for y'all on console, I haven't gotten DDOSed on pc at all. Ubi needs to fix this shit asap, it's a disgrace.
---
https://trackercdn.com/cdn/r6.tracker.network/ranks/svg/hd-rank20.svg
---
I think this is the highest quality one available right now
---
well your friend is fucking right
---
Everybody knows this...
---
Oooooh! So does that mean that we can think of every possible operator ever, so Ubi can't make any more operators ^and ^instead ^is ^forced ^to ^fix ^their ^broken ^game
---
That's why you don't use shotguns lol.
---
This was perfectly thought out, and the tachanka rework should definitely be put in
---
Cool, so let's just nerf everyone until no one does any damage. What's the point of a shield if you cant tank into a room and annoying and pull focus? 
---
Shields are fine how they are.
---
I really like finka because of her lmg and that she can res teammates without being with them.
---
nice fanfic
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Tachanka's model doesn't need a brain because its too small for a lord like him. He directly use his spiritual power to perceive everyone's location, and empowering his LMG at the same time.
---
That really makes me wanna pass out
---
GLOCK!!!!!! YEEEEEEAAHHH
---
Instead of requiring 2 level authentication they should have microphone required for ranked

Who's thiccer ? Rook or IQ or Chunky Chanka

Apparently similar.

Am I am saying you should report them to the authorities? No they are just dumb kids. You should make them aware of the laws so that they dont continue to do idiotic things in the future that can really mess up their lives.
---
Lower sensitivites allow you to control recoil more finely, but higher recoil guns can become much harder.
---
With a 50cm 360 I can easily control buck without an ACOG, but with an ACOG it's almost impossible past the first 10 rounds without hurting my wrist.
---
You may hate to hear this but its the truth, nokk isnt a good op her weapons are a joke except for the deagle and her ability is a bigger joke, so just find a character that has a good gun so that you can improve your aim. Nokk is a high skill op so if you get better aim itll help you out a lot since her guns deal barely any damage

Ash's hitbox on Tachanka
---
Why is this being downvoted?
---
Try using sledge more, he‚Äôs a very balanced operator, with pretty good guns
---
If he had used black text, it would be easier to read
---
I thought that for a while, but at the end or even by asking it turns out that's not the case. Lots of people choose the end of a game to complain about teammates and yell at each other before leaving.
---
You can go all-blue on attack too! But we'll have to wait some time for another "color squad" on defense unfortunately.
---
Clash main and I have no idea what any of this means.
---
If it's a site that has a garage or a good wall to open up I recommend a Thermite / Hibana. I've been playing a lot of Zofia because of her ability to open soft walls and concuss enemies.
---
Hello.

I would if console had push to talk. No way I'm sitting there with 5 open mics.
---
300 IQ Plays
---
Peri is quite popular and you can reverse search images
---
There's a difference between map control and Lion pressing a button.
---
But the problem is shit like Nomad, where you have no possible counter and will die every time.
---
Hard CC doesn't belong in a game like siege.
---
Shit like Ela mines will always cause me to die, because I cant do a 90 degree flick with a 100cm 360.
---
I see it flop out and kill nobody most of the time for me.
---
"maybe is ya phone" if you speak like that, it saids a lot about your education. Also im on PC reddit on phone isnt the best
---
Could be reverse image searching
---
Ah, I see your a man of culture as well

Me too, but only when I'm not himüòâüòÇ
---
I've seen many pictures of ubi's stats messing up like this. He more than likely isn't lying and this is just a glitch.
---
Shame it‚Äôs for a gun that‚Äôs not too good lmao
---
yeah the damage thing has sorta baffled me when ive had gun fights where i was adamant i should have killed someone with how much i hit them any ideas of good ops? I like playing thatcher, kapkan (who's gun is amazing), i hate mutes gun but i play him occasionally, as his ability is quite useful.
---
Very cultured
---
These are just standard bans though?
---
I can‚Äôt even afford a basic year 1 operator with renown.
---
It would take me 2 weeks to make that lmao
---
Please explain why bullets can go through door frames
---
and grenades
---
&gt;Cool, so let's just nerf everyone until no one does any damage. 
---
Oh look a strawman because you haven't got a better argument.
---
&gt;What's the point of a shield if you cant tank into a room and annoying and pull focus? 
---
Unfortunately that doesnt always translate well to gameplay. However if they want to maintain that the need to further limit their ability to be offensive.
---
Clash is arguably the most balanced shield op because she has to choose between her gun or shield and she can't melee with her shield. Her slowdown ability is dumb though.
---
There is a happy middleground somewhere between Monty and Clash that shield ops should be be brought to, where they can pull agro and be a nuisance but they can't reliably win 1v1s.
---
&gt;Shields are fine how they are.
---
No they aren't, even the Pros who use them regularly say they aren't.
---
also he zooms in probably so we don't see the connection icon that appears on the right side, use your brain
---
Btw ubi tries to make the game feel realistic... This just looks like someone trying to make a clickbait yt video for 3 year olds
---
What the hell does this mean
---
Yes we noticed this afterwards too!
---
Kobe from way downtown
---
I'm typing fast on a phone I'm not proof reading anything on reddit for a gaming subscription don't worry about my education I can tell you are upset by that comment so I already know you lack it in general. Besides I make more money lmfao
---
Preach
---
Honestly i dont like the idea of this operator.  Perhaps it just needs more explanation of its purpose.
---
It sounds like a non-lethal smoke who only increases recoil of those affected.  I cant think of a reason to use this person over smoke.
---
I will say a nice buff to this would be a smoke than denies plants.  Perhaps they are so completely affected by it they cant see the keys to type in the codes.
---
It's you

---
Exposing this guy is kinda childish
---
I like that drawing circle part...the most dangerous part.
---
Defend side: Hmm...nails are kicked out, maybe I should shoot that barricade. :D
---
I would stick that in my veins
---
Love the idea! It'd be nice for the attacking side to have a medic.
---
You probably did but he killed you first
---
&gt;and my reply was simple
---
I asked why you use the setup, and tried to be helpful and explain why it's not logically a good idea..
---
Your response is an aggressive 'oh boo hoo sorry to disappoint' as if I've personally attacked you.. just a simple question and attempt at giving good advice, bud. Not to mention that's all after completing the original post.
---
&gt;To make yourself look better
---
Absolutely no clue what you think I'm trying to gain from this.
---
It's not my fault you're overly sensitive, defensive and take simple conversation as some sort of insult.
---
Anyway I'm not trying to hurt your feelings any further, I'll just stop replying. Hope you have a good day.
---
All send boys
---
Perfect.
---
Whats thatüòÇ
---
I can give you my p.o.v. on how I will do it technically:
---
* Nothing transcendant while he's popping the nails, some vfxs behind the window
---
* I'll use an animated decal while he paint on the door (this one can be tricky)
---
* When he vault, I hide the window and disable his physics, swap it with a custom mesh animated the window/door barricade to follow his body.
---
* (If someone shoot it while he enters, I destroy the barricate)
---
* and finally when he passed (assuming that he has not being frost trapped) I change the texture on the window he vaulted
---
Not saying that's easy just saying it's doable :).
---
I‚Äôve seen single players destroy a squad by destroying team gadgets, blasting open walls and hatches with a shotty... Toxic people can ruin it for you.
---
I love backing my R6 superiority by reminding people that their state didn't get a R6 charm and mine did. Even if you can't see it.
---
this will be added to the ways to defuse
---
dont try to clap back and spell ‚Äúshield‚Äù wrong üòÇ
---
Well, we can still try. If you don‚Äôt want to, that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm just saying that we can try.
---
Yes father ü§ß‚ô•Ô∏è
---
because it's bad. the old was bad too, but I still prefer it over this crap
---
I don't hate the actually layout, I just don't like that it completely replaced a classic og map.
---
Yikes
---
Thank you for you‚Äôre upvotes random 2 people üòÅ
---
Makes sense
---
Well currently Frost isn't a counter to anything, and she is countered by anyone looking down, so it would actually be good that she served more strategic purpose like against magnet.
---
Of course you can, and it will make a difference, but toxic people suck.
---
Then the warning shots in front of them or near should have been enough.
---
Great idea but doesn‚Äôt sound balanced tbh
---
NO! Just NO. You get NO PUDDING tonight cupcake. Lol
---
That killcam would have been awesome!
---
Great Ace btw
---
Indeed, they do.
---
Œô would buy it too if I played Hibana.I prefer Thermite though...
---

I guess so, they do have more important issues, but still.
---
I thought this was a real charm... Disappointed
---
What is it? Can‚Äôt see anything.
---
This season is pretty strange. I think it's due to 2 reasons
---
1. Boosting is rampant. I'm low plat and face a team consisting of diamonds and coppers a lot of the time
---
2. The changes to ranked at the start of the season. Maybe you/your teammates are an echo jackal main who's now been displaced onto ops you/they aren't as strong with. The soft MMR reset has put you straight into competitive games at the start of the season. Every secure and hostage ranked player is now playing bomb with preexisting bomb players due to this you're either placed with teammates who don't understand how bomb works at their rank or you're placed too high as you're basically new to the game mode.
---
Tldr: boosting is scummy and ubi made good ranked changes we're just in the displacement period and it should sort itself out next season/the season after
---
"Is that a motherfucking Jojo reference ?" Stay away from me you Sticky finger ! :D
---
smart idea
---
I can't see half of my screen.Look I find the aug superior to the commando.But the positioning is a deal breaker
---
Is that hidden blade from ac in the hands of cav? (in pic 1)
---
I'll check it out
---
There should be an r/Rainbow6Console subreddit. I hate coming here just to see people using a Pac-Man joycon to play.
---
I dont care if they are my friends they deserve to get banned/suspended.
---
Tell me why
---
Tachanka: "Now this looks like a job for me"
---
Thank you bro it really means a lot üôåüôå
---
Console players are people too
---
The new Hereford sucks ass
---
Haven't lurked this subreddit for long but of the maybe 10 fanmade operators i've seen so far, this is definitely my favorite. Looks the most like an operator you'd actually see in Siege.
---
?
---
And I'm the abandoned child
---
Not the Matrix, console.
---
That‚Äôs not an aim it he just got lucky with his bullet spread lmaoo
---
It also changes the basic principles of the game. It would cheapen the game to now not be able to relay on visually checking doors/windows for entry/intel
---
Perfect heads hot thru the wall?
---
I wont lie the led√§r or whatever it is called is TraSh
---
pls dont ask to see my rank btw, this season has been tough and it ruined my gold 1 streak i had :(
---
I pump water out the ground and make it safe to drink.
---
Yeah, but at the same time it's hard to recognize a warning shot from somebody screwing around or shooting at a drone. At least me putting myself in their shoes I would probably think that.
---
Pc only counted the amount of times I got defense which is 3 says amount of games in guide
---
Damn I just discovered a new level of disrespect curtesy of the lord.
---
Not a fan of Ash's specific G36 but maybe Remedy could have a different variant of the G36 just to make them unique? I know there's a bunch!
---
Prepare well, friend.
---
I've left Newcomer a few months ago and while I dominated in Newcomer, I got spawnpeeked left and right, shit on and whatnot.
---
Buckle up.
---
not a cosplay lol
---
Plz don't bring maverick two
---
Plz :(
---
it IS a 3d model my dude ;)
---
Did you read it? I said that since Im living in Norway I think its weird that the NEU servers have a hinger ping for me than WEU.
---
Where is red meta?
---
Where my Kapkan + Tachanka + Lesion + Mozzie + Echo
---
and
---
Fuze + Glaz + Hibana + Ying + Gridlock?
---
*DETAILS*
---
Is it a bug?
---
That's true, would it be better if it only happens if it's a full squad matchmaking?
---
Your sarcasm would be funnier if it wasn‚Äôt riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes. Try again later.
---
The idea is that it covers too much of the screen in comparison to other weapons. For some people this maybe a problem as it can sometimes be distracting, and will not allow you to see people in front of you to the right hand side of your screen.
---
Thatcher and thermite can break into that, thermite can also be replaced by hibana
---
You could use like crayola markers and color it the correct colors and it‚Äôs a stamp!
---
Link?
---
Yeah. This seems like it would only be hugely useful against teams who barricade everything, and against Castle. But Castle is such a weirdly niche op that I don‚Äôt see it being crazy useful. Like often castles are for cutting distant sight lines anyway so Idk if it would even be great there.
---
Then use the other better weapon
---
Master of strategy
---
yeah haha has a victory royale so it is a fortnite!!!! Dude, take your pills and go back to bed
---
Doesnt matter, should‚Äôve been a draw
---
I wonder if his monitor is bad or his memory.
---
The Lord joined the GIGN
---
You didn‚Äôt hit him once
---
I would say 3 like Doc and make them heal for the same hp as Doc gun and you can overclock your health for a a short time like Doc‚Äôs if you‚Äôre full health
---
I mean, atleast I have a profile picture.  
---
I'm disappointed you're still breathing.
---
Fz Retweet, but i‚Äôm bad speaking in english, so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea play together if you wanted that
---
 This is reaper
---
Border
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted, this is hilarious. People on this sub must have never watched Spongebob.
---
I think you just hit him in the shoulder
---
Fz Retweet, but I‚Äôm bad speaking in english so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea play in a party if u wanted that
---
I have 750 point and 1.8kd so yes
---
Easy distraction and helps if you‚Äôre going pro or trying as you have to play with pro league settings
---
[Redacted]
---
I would rather get rid of chalet and skyscraper
---
Oh, no worries. But if you do want to play then I‚Äôm down, just not right now.
---
A kill under wine barrels on your third day of play? A little bit of spicy in the making??
---
Little do you know if we just make as many operator ideas as possible and take all the good ones then they have to start taking ideas from the community

Proleague standard is no points, no hit markers(doesnt include the red x for kill markers). It forces you to figure out the situation without a crutch because points give a lot of information. Personally, unless you mainly play tournaments like that, it‚Äôs just a hinderance while playing ranked as you‚Äôre automatically at a disadvantage.
---
I'd say yes to those as well.  Hereford must go first, though.
---
stupid people show
---
Heartbreaking defeat
---
Gah damn that's sexily smooth!
---
Fuck now I want weappn deploy animations at the beginning of rounds similar to picking up weapons for the first time in APEX, etc.
---
I love how much time you had left yet you still rushed
---
Oh its beautiful
---
They don‚Äôt need more nerfs cause otherwise they will only be good as being bullet sponges.
---
The recoil on her AR isn‚Äôt bad and it‚Äôs predictable. Also don‚Äôt forget you can use her gadget to open of holes in floors or ceilings
---
You didn‚Äôt just do that, what a flex
---
I think thats god
---
What changes would you make to them?
---
I love the second weapon idea
---
Yea but look at the score difference
---
Just get rid of all 3, aren't they not in pro league? They shouldn't be giving us pro league settings without taking away the maps that pro league doesn't want to deal with. The maps are literally the only thing they didn't change other than the length of the games.
---
Jesus christ it was a joke bro. Go outside if something silly like that triggered you
---
Remove threads that bitch about Hereford from the subreddit.
---
Lmao you're such a fucking 13 year old, no matter how old you actually are. I'll save myself the trouble of remembering you even exist and block you
---
Would taking out the nails not cause the planks to fall off?
---
Gay
---
That‚Äôs not hitreg then. That‚Äôs server stability
---
Sorry for hurting your feelings dude, didn't know your skin was that thin :(((((((((
---
