---
Depending on you rank but:
---

---
Gadget 
---
Lesion: Alright across ranks especially lower ranks (no one sees it in lower ranks)
---
Vigil: Good in high ranks, hardly anyone drones in lower ranks or casual 
---
Guns
---
Vigil: Great
---
Lesion: Decent 
---
It‚Äôs up to you, I prefer lesion as I am a lower rank because I don‚Äôt find any use for vigils gadget even though he has good guns. 
---
Except I upload ü§™üòÇ but srsly how
---
Thanks! The makeup was a lot thinner irl, I spent about 2 hours making every smudge look perfect lol. The person that took the pic for us decided to take it upon themselves to edit my ‚Äúmistakenly smudged‚Äù makeup lol. Oh well! I‚Äôll try and get some better higher quality pics up tomorrow. Thanks a lot! Nice to know I didn‚Äôt do too much of a bad job haha‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Maybe you should put in a feature that picks an operator for you.
---
I'm in silver hell
---
That would be cool, but I dont see how the hunt for Red October could be used unless the actually Red October was in a museum somewhere and the map was part of that. Maybe kind of like the train room at Kafe. Pieces of the sub in a room. Or something like that.
---
The only other way they could incorporate it would.be an event similar to outbreak. Maybe a mission similar to the mission from MW2 where price launches the nuke? Just spit balling a little.

Oh, god-damn cameramen...

Or you know, it runs on a single player game engine, because ubisoft never expected this to turn out so successful. It's basically Assassin's Creed: Siege.

Imagine: 5 castles, 5 tachankas, 5 lesions

Or worse: 5 Lions

I'm not gonna wait all day for you to kill someone that's downed - all it takes is one Doc stim or a Finka boost and now there's a threat.
---
yee
---
IDK why bit it says fluff on under the title why is it there?
---
I like how people say Mozzie is short but Ying is like what about me?
---
I hear you. I just started playing again about two weeks ago. I‚Äôve probably been killed by my own team more than I‚Äôve been killed by opfor. But I remind myself that it‚Äôs just a game
---
Ying female
---
Tbh if you want to start playing bomb (or ever move to it) gridlock is actually a good op for that mode, along with being able to use that lmg of hers
---
I‚Äôm just imagining how happy ash mains would be to kill you wile you can‚Äôt even shoot back 
---
Bra I saw it as soon as you entered the room/ destroyed the 1st one, when you walked around the counter, and when he was backing up into it.

What was the most annoying was a person ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù while I was interrogating them during a rank match. After a round or two, they joined the match back as if nothing happened. I‚Äôm in the same boat though. Just be a good sport and give me the credit for it.

ExCuSe mE... Why did you changed the facial look... she looks too human on that cosplay

You could add a forum for tips and tricks for new siege players. This game has a hard learning curve so it may help the game get more players. 
---
Red 
---
But to continue to nerf him he‚Äôs been nerfed too many times just let him go.
---
On what platform
---
Sad it's gone
---
I dont think he will find a good team like that
---
The only way to have a game balanced at every level is to balance around the highest level. Siege is a competitive fps, what do you expect?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also you are totally wrong in what you say, the pro community barely gets listened to. They have always asked for many common sense changes and they almost never come through or take a very long time to do so, mainly due to the casual community. That's the reason lion has taken a year to balance or that current blitz is a thing, because of the casual community.
---
If you actually knew what the pro community asked for you wouldn't be writing this post.
---
How do you ad the character like J√§get main
---
I love red and black combo uniforms. You get an upvote
---
J√§ger
---
You shot through two surfaces. You basically reduced the damage to nothing.
---
he hasn't not been nerfed in a year or two? Last time they changed him, they buffed him
---
it‚Äôs the least expensive one üòÇ 
---
As all thing should be
---
Thought the title was "I suck tities" was very thrilled for what was going to come, then saw the clip. Was not disappointed. 
---
100% Real Proportion Mozzie
---
I agree, but have you seen an fps game where head glitching wasn‚Äôt a thing? If Ubi would manage a solution somehow I think it would make r6 much more enjoyable than it is right now
---
You are so lucky.
---
That would be op as fuck 
---
It would not be fun to fight something that slows you, it would not be fun to find the damn thing. And that‚Äôs 4 charges if the attacker has 2 of them. Then on top of that he has grenades.
---
Have the slowing effect or the mobility not both at the same time. And if you do have both then only allow him to have one drone. 
---
Secondary gadgets could be breaches and flashes as they would compliment his primary gadget.
---
Guns, make them average. So they have the same power as the sas attaching guns 
---
And yes I would love to see a Swedish op added to the game. 
---
Then IDK, all I know is that sucks
---
Here you go....  F
---
Oh...well good job on that. I feel bad for liking this 
---
Oh yea I'm sorry I completely forgot connection effects bullet damage

Mozzie is Ant-Man confirmed.

Stop upvoting these threads. This person deliberately deranks their accounts to mess with new and returning players. It's a level of toxicity that's hard to fathom and it completely ruins the game for a lot of people who are just trying to learn at their skill level.
---
ez clap
---
you probably are just as accurate with automatic guns but you don't notice it because of the sheer number of bullets.
---
If your on pc, the official discord is filled with peeps 5 stacking in casual. You can easily do that if you need it ( for any pc players who are wondering )
---
Yeah their automatic rifles have a bit of kick, but their Semiautomatic rifles are fairly easy to use with the muzzle break. You could try firing in bursts, or pausing to aim back at your target. Bucks rifle is probably one of the hardest to control because it doesn‚Äôt have a foregrip. I usually substitute him for sledge or ash or even Zofia because they all breach similarly and have different rifles. Twitch could be switched out for IQ or possible thatcher if you want easier to use rifles while still keeping the anti-gadget abilities. Blackbeard unfortunately doesn‚Äôt have a real substitute unless you use a full shield operator, but his gun does high damage so you should try only firing when you have a shot, then stopping to change out the shield or reload and aiming back to your target.
---
Her teeth are nice.
---
No one has ever done that, ever
---
Your opinion does not constitute a paradigm shift on what I think.
---
Out of the two new ops she is the weakest. In my honest opinion she fine where she is maybe a little weak, but ok. 
---
5/7
---
Run the C7E with a reflex sight and angled grip, is what i recommend. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been using since he came out beginning of year 2

If you're good with recoil, the PDW has great stopping power, but the C7e is more reliable and rounded. At least from my experience.
---
"How's it going Bros, my name is *PEWDIEPIE*.

Every single time there's a Valkyrie on your team expect a window to be popped. They're too deficient to just go up the a different doorway to through their stuff out

Popular opinion: can we stop upvoting this kind of content? A screenshot of this stupid situation that hits hot every other week?
---
What happened to quality, man?
---
Where‚Äôs my barbed wire &gt;:(
---
So wait... I should run the PDW9 for long range?
---
If you got the map knowledge and the timing right on when to flank and from where for an objective, you‚Äôll do fine with her and cause the enemy to take their time.
---
Honestly I'm fine with the recoil... it's basically an MP5 with more upward recoil rather than horizontal. 
---
Attacker: Twitch
---
Defender: Pulse 
---
Would smash
---
Does whatever Caveman Blackbeard does
---
In trash where it belongs 
---
only for DMR's except glaz's dmr, and dmrs are never used, like at all, so it wouldent impact, like at all
---
Where's the meme cannon, the m870?
---
Even worse than at launch? Damn
---
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. Ok here I‚Äôll put it this way. 
---
C7E - Long/mid range with acog. Close range with reflex. 
---
PDW9 - only close range (I use the reflex or holo)
---
There's only so much you can do with a 64x64 canvas
---
You could say that for literally EVERY operator in the game lol
---
legit takes like 4 seconds and exactly one canister to make a crouch hole. just under one if you're good enough, but i usually use a whole canister to clean the edges. it's a really fast, relatively quiet entry. 
---
Logan Paul is in the background
---
Ok, this helps a lot! Thank you. I‚Äôm definitely a solo player anyway.
---
Actually now that I'm thinking about it... I could have just put the m870 sideways
---
But dmrs are used a lot.
---
I always close the barricade back up 
---
Ok gotcha. 
---
People who pop miras at the start of a round are mentally deficient. In casual I tk.
---
I'd very much have this face for hibana, really nice!
---
I was emphasizing the ace I got but yeah, I wouldn't want yacht on ranked.
---
Theres literally no drawback to this. Ubi gets to sell other people's skins that they volunteeringly make. Rust does this. It's a flawless system.
---
I'm still sad about the smh nerfüò•
---
really? i only really se it on glaz, and dokkabae.
---
Going into a custom game and walking around really helped me
---
Make them not slow you down. That's all I want. She could have fucking 10 of the things for all I care. Just remove the slowing 
---
I usually have a fine time learning maps by watching Plat players play them. 
---
Either gun is kind of a personal preference, I use both it‚Äôs just whatever I‚Äôm feeling like to be honest. I run acog on both but use an angled grip on the pdw instead of a vertical grip. Pretty lethal ctu.
---
I reduse to tk but i need soft wall next to my mirrors 
---
Most balanced maps in the game imo. Good job trying to learn them
---
Play terrorist hunt on those maps, it will force you to navigate the entire map increasing your awareness 
---
Yeah I did, that's the only legendary that was easy to get 
---
I bet he couldn't even see you, you bounced back because the hatch was still intact on his screen and you were just simply standing on a still existent hatch shooting randomly, for him.
---
Haha you earned some worthless game points douche have fun with them
---
"Everyone hated that"
---
And these nerfs and buffs are to make the game more competitively viable. There are still tons of changes that happen for the average player that aren‚Äôt just all pro league oriented. A good example being the recent MP5 nerf because of the over abundance of spawn peeking doc and rook players. Trust me when I say that the pro players know more about this game then you and I could ever imagine. 
---
can you stop posting these. it was cool for the first few but now its just repetitive. 
---
This is the most simplistic beautiful concept I've ever seen. I hope the devs take this idea and make it real. Keep it up! &lt;3
---
She is so annoying to play with!  That boost makes the whole team completely deaf.

I gave on ranked because I get either garbage teamsters who do jack shit and when I scold them for it , team kill me until the match is over

jk but actually, i think gridlocks gadget needs a heavy nerf.  Nerf its deploy radius and possibly compensating for the nerf, ubi could buff its sound making it a little quieter. 
---
What do you think Ash is 
---
No one really plays some of the new ops
---
Solo custom with sledge and break everything
---
As mentioned:
---
&gt;The gold looks patchy and pixelated on most guns except a few carbines and the 552, and others are just straight up meh.
---
I‚Äôve seen people use it if they have to leave the window if the site is being taken by attackers, so that it can‚Äôt be used against them. But popping it as a strat off the rip, no not really. 
---
I remember getting lion scaned for the first time after my return (I left when hibana was added) Panic was my main feeling with confusion on the side

Alright. Go to the Xbox store and look up "Year 4 Pass" click on the one for siege, and make sure it's installed.

Go custom game, first figure out where all the default cams are. Take notice of what rooms there in. Then figure out where all the staircases are. What rooms they lead to, what side of the map they are on. Use the compass a lot. Then try and remember which rooms the objectives are in. 
---
That should be a good start. Try watching Varsity gaming or King George map guides and running around in a custom game. Play a lot of terrorist hunt. You can turn off all but whatever map you want to pick so that you can learn each map one at a time. 
---
I'd rather Nomad be able to pick up her Air Javs.  
---
Ahhhhh yes, the shit that happens to me everyday
---
oh look another person posting of people leaving ranked

you are wrong. i have 10+ videos when the people kill me through the shield  with my shield on my face. i posted here but the reddit excluded because the problems need to be reported to r6fix. 
---
Really dude. Really? 
---
I just came back and played the last 3 days. Man im playing like a newbie, many things have changed and added since i left. I jumped at ranked immediately to learn again and im getting stomped. Im gettig pissed and enjoying at the same time
---
We should be able to put multiple traps on one door so it will be instant death.
---
There are issues with sheild sync but to me this looked fine. Other than the replay. She sprayed into your shoulder from what I assume happened. 
---
Name?
---
Ah gotcha now 
---
you play with high ping?
---
Because that'll make it such that you could kill your entire team and not get kicked.
---
Consider this. Two toxic people. One guy shoots the other 3 teammates a couple to times. They're all left at, say an average of, 50-60 hp. The remaining toxic person could kill all three of them and not get kicked coz he didn't do 200 damage. 
---
Bro i need to stop reading "lesion main" as "lesbian main"
---
There's no way they can fix it, if they banned people for leaving people who occasionally have connection issues will eventually be banned and be pissed off. It'll be a constant back and forth with nobody being pleased.

Is there a limit to how many times he can do it? Also does it take awhile? I feel like he is op. There has to be a catch

Swinging a sledge since siege was released will do that to ya

Didn‚Äôt think of it like that. I still think it should be changed in some way shape or form.

---
Feels bad man. I have no skins for the Ops I like.
---
i think shields in a FPS game is a ridiculous idea, even more so when its this broken. i have tried countless time aiming precisely for Blitz arms as he charges me and i have never managed to kill him that way. its not like my aim is bad, or that i cant get kills. in Battlefield for instance i am normally around the top of the scoreboard for kills and my accuracy stats are good. so it cant be aim that is to blame. if a shield is charging you and there is nothing you can hit even with good, precision aiming then he is that shield operator is broken as fuck.
---
Friends have told me that they changed it so if you leave the split second after you die your kd stays the same
---
Agree. Especially with the ability to choose the height of placement having been introduced some years back. Being able to stack them is logical, and beneficial to Kapkan.
---

I have a fairly high success rate for countering blitz as lesion. Shallow roams coupled with trap operators are a must. 1v1 learn how to fight while flashed or try to get out of their and flank or ambush him.

I had a team, I was dead and it was 3v1 defending on secure area. One of the 3 decided to take a walk through gridlock‚Äôs traps outside the objective and died, the other two decided to roam while the gridlock just waltzed into the objective and took it. When they got back they both decided to peek the same murder hole one after the other and both died.

So this is the 4th season I've done a road to plat, most recent being the [revolver](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ar47x2/the_road_to_platinum_revolver_edition/). This time around using the SASG was definitely a challenge, I fluctuated constantly down from gold 1- gold 3 for like 25 games until I finally got to plat, which is why this video is so damn long compared to my other ones. It is probably the worst primary weapon in the game.

my brother downed that guy and he left before my brother could reach him. i think one solution is that if a guy leaves a game while DBNO then it counts as a death and the guy that downed him gets a kill, and it leaves his body behind as DBNO till it dies or round ends. that body cant be revived and its clear to that person's teammates with a special symbol. if someone shoots the body before it dies then he doesnt get the kill because the guy that DBNO-ed him already got the kill. this body can also be interrogated before it dies. if a guy leaves a game while standing (not DBNO) then it counts as a death, and his body can disappear.
---
agreed 
---
You died because a small part of your head is exposed whule crouching and thays what she probably shot. Ignore the kill cam
---
I hate it too but it's because leaving has no consequence imo sometimes u have to go they should just make it if it's been 1 round no one can join in the second round
---
Hol‚Äô up!
---
I understand that it's, horribly designed and very one sided but which map would replace it? 
---
The same. 
---
Fortress should be the one leaving. Hereford is in my opinion one of the most balanced maps. Every objective is viable (Even Loom Room). Outback should be taken out asap as well.

Oh what a one tap with miras vector

Tachanka certainly needs to be buffed
---
We dont need to replace it, we have enough even if we get rid of Chalet, Fortress and Kafe too
---
Whats up bros it‚Äôs pewdiepie 
---
 I‚Äôd like for it to be added back into casual because in my opinion the new Hereford is basically a new map so why not bring the old one back in as a separate map 
---
Fortress is the worst ranked map in the rotation after Kafe, and Outback is the best map since Villa, how could you think that lmfao
---
Both are only good for casual, at best

Yeah probably, but it‚Äôs a pretty dumb reaction. If you don‚Äôt like it then you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt bother others with it.

OI! You got a loicense for that scope?
---
I want defender acogs to be removed as it takes away some of the strategy needed when operators such as doc have the same long range effectiveness as attackers who are having to push up onto the defenders
---
it appen wen you don't really open the trap and everyone see you standing on it shoting nothing like a retard
---
I think it is down to the game not working but I like peaking as it is a mechanic to helps distinguish high and low level players 
---
Tell that to her hitbox. 
---
And... no, rook, doc, etc have no such as big hitbox bc they r wearing armour, so if u hit the armour he get no shot, BUT gridlock has no armour.
---
Also I imagine that the "stupid gamer dudes" knows at least 1 or 2 girls who are into fitness. I mean I probably know more bc I go to GYM but DUDE, a lot of girls go to gym. Girls tend to do things like running, squats, etc. I know a lot who do lifting but not too much.

And for me bodybuilder women are not attractive (I'm talking about me).

Saw them on Reddit,But as most of my viewers are Japanese and not familiar with Reddit thingy, I just decided to put them in my video

Pfff, I (and a ton of others) shelled out $50 each when they first came out...
---
It's not me, but my friend who was already dead.
---
That's correct. Those toy soldier uniforms most likely won't be buyable as they're kind of "pay to lose". They're gonna be game mode exclusive, just like hazmat suits in Article 5.
---
About the game mode: &gt;!it's probably a hostage rescue kind of thing with a couple of new rules and with added narration like it's a kids fairy tale book. As far as I understand from the voice lines, you have to find and rescue a teddy bear who can be downed, killed and moved around the map. There are also voice lines for people being spotted on various floors etc. And for some reason they've added unfiltered announcer voice lines in the files (the ones like "Five seconds until insertion" etc).!&lt;

Nice
---
A very large percentage of the changes that happen in this game come directly from people bitching about it, in a roundabout way OP is right. The lean spam, fixed. Lions getting reworked, ash got nerfed. All those things were issues people had with the game last season, and they were vocal about it. So I fail to see why you have such an issue with him saying it? 
---
Lucky motha 
---
Yeah but kapkan was a fat shit and everybody saw the lasers
---
Looks like Damascus steel 
---
I would just alt-f4 there.
---
That is the case for some of the rappels, however because of the frame rate of the xbox one capture feature (when saved to one drive) it looks like I am releasing the button before completing the action.

I need the CBJMS it's my favorite gun from battlefield 4 not to mention the ak is also amazing

He wasn't 5'0?

Oi! You there! Where's ya acog license!?

Nothing is new it's been like this for a long time they changed hitboxes with operation health so you couldn't get hit in the clothing and still take damage

Thank you (rip I dropped to copper)

i mean echo cant be hacked by dokki but why twitch

Skycrapper is the first one that needs to go right followed by hereford

And I care why?

Is it Kalinka?

No, I just think Australians are funny :)

Apparel is not part of the hitbox, and Blitz got some of the bulkiest apparel in the game. Just look at it:

---
Only if you'd hit the actual arm of the operator you score a hit. Blitz has like 10cm clothing and padding on his shoulders. The hitbox is perfectly alright. 
---
Can confirm, did it 2 nights ago, in suburban map there was frost in tunnel entrance behind barrel, I just storm in and killed her instantly. 
---
Aah, general reposti! 
---
Yep. It's pretty crazy. Getting 180d is the worst feeling ever. 
---
You should really look at mozzies chibi
---
I mean, it's on his concept art and everything.
---
Would probably offer too much versatility 
---
Sens is the last of my problems rn tbh. I have a long way to go before I can complain about not being able to 180 someone lmao. I edited the post to include current Sens. I'm very comfortable playing this and I found it after a lot of trial and error. 
---
I do too lol. It really is a good gun honestly 
---
Lol what

Already seen 
---
Feelsgoodman. Yesterday I killed a Hibana by barricading the 2 doors from Chalet's main lobby to the dining room and EDDing both. She ripped through both of them, died, then left the game lmao

Hey, that's pretty good!

Very nicely done

It's a mess on galaxy s5. Probably just what font size is used

Rogue 9 was talking about this recently.

It's the parallax effect combined with the kill cam not being an accurate representation. 
---
I dont like the shotgun on him
---
It does too little damage
---
They got Ela on defence for sure. 
---
Or he is downloading 4k. 
---
Hammering intensifies 
---
Those people are exploiting some kind of bug to force the server to disconnect everybody; it's not an intended mechanic Ubisoft put into the game. Thus, the game server thinks everyone just left the game since it isn't coded to look for the exploit occurring (since if Ubisoft did put code around this exploit, they would likely just fix it rather than code around it.
---
Thank you m8 
---
Oh true, maybe they could add a balancing feature. Idk I just saw it and thought it would be a cool idea plus it encourages player to use cams more 
---
They are just funny clips, that's all, my squad and I lose every game. And we aren't the to stomp out anyone. The only teams we've beat are the other people that derank just so they can beat the shit out of coppers. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just content creators who edit that in 
---
i‚Äôm being rude because people like you love to complain about the game and get upset that you got a headshot when you really didn‚Äôt. you hit neck or shoulder. accept it and move on

Also, how much RAM ?

Yeah can we stop upvoting reposts please?

I'd rather have a HK416 like DEVGRU actually uses. Yes the MK-17 has nice damage but it could be better. Gimme a longer version of J√§gers 416 with the 416 stock and I'll be happy. With acog just to flex on Jager mains
---
....that‚Äôs a picture of old Clubhouse 
---
Alt accounts are fine. Smurfs are purposefully deranking to play with bad players like that Tachanka. Anytime I see BullyingCoppers, I give that man a downvote. There is *nothing* impressive about his stats, since it's the equivalent of putting the hit stick on a 10 year old as a 23 year old grown man.
---
the destroyed Mira is the problem... :) 
---
I see a problem here, about a year ago I gave my Xbox to my dad since I play everything on PC and he really likes playing Siege, the problem is that he's 60 years old and can only play for a few hours a week at best, so he's a legitimate bronze 4 player, seeing him have to play against sweat nerds like OP, even in casual, actually makes me feel bad for him as well as the tens of thousands of players in his shoes, players that can't sweat for several hours a day and shit all over casual players they shouldn't even be MMing against.
---
He tried to provocate you. On Twitch side, parts of your body/head was visible and he shoot it. On your side, your body was fully hidden. Problem with synchronization in this season is worst since Operation Health was released (I didn't played before Health, so I don't know anyway)
---
the worst map in ranked is Skyscraper. this Hereford is a hundred times more balanced than old hereford. it does need a couple MINOR tweaks but it‚Äôs pretty balanced 
---
I have the same problem. (PC) My sponsor skin is gone on Mozzie's AR.

I do have that and 8gb, four two gb sticks

Only mods can do it

Omg you‚Äôre right. I actually didn‚Äôt notice that

Vigil 100%. Ela's recoil nerf is just to much to play effectively at anything other super close range

At least for pixel or voxel maps there was some work on it. But flags were just "lemme take the magic wand in gimp and add this flag picture found on google image to this random op", and this here is just a hue change

I don't even have one black ice skin :(
---
Who needs the fucking cat 
---
Okay, can you tell me which version of Windows you are running?
---
I use [maps.r6guides](https://maps.r6guides.com/) It has more maps and is basically the updated version of r6maps.
---
Once you reach a point where you're in a cycle of winning and losing, then yes. At that point the system feels it has you placed pretty well, which does make sense if you really think about it. If the ranking and matchmaking systems worked perfectly (I'm not saying they do now), every match should be a 50/50 proposition in terms of expected winner. It's only when a team is consistently winning or losing that they can show they belong in a different rank.
---
I think you mean the csgo head shot sound which is edited. 
---
Still, theres no need to be rude to someone you do not know. If im complaining then thats my problem, not yours. Have some respect and have some manners. 
---
Hey bud i was like level 130 when i got my first one on this account and on my Alt i got like two before even hitting level 50
---
This game is rigged but i believe in you one day you will prevail and get a juicy black ice skin
---
Damn, Lesion, Cav, and Mav all look great, and Cav didn‚Äôt have face paint!

cool

Windows 10, 64 bit I believe

Funny because this account got deleted from Twitter, now I'm just asking you to delete this post because I didn't give any authorization to repost my work .
---
Skyscraper is good tho, not the best but I would take that over new Hereford any day, this is one is such a maze and it isn't even Hereford at this point.
---
I like the other pistol more but i feel like i dont have a choice but to use the PMM as otherwise it would just go to waste. But the black ice for the OTS is really sweet aswell
---
*when you want to ree but slowly realize it was just a guy asking for a backround*

definitely not

pc
---
no. quit complaining about the game when it‚Äôs actually you that‚Äôs the problem

the face looks awesome!, not like the abomination that ubisoft decided to put in

They disappear from the store, They should not be disappearing from peoples inventory after they have bought them.

Only mozzie. She hacks the drone, so she should ID the op. But make it like doki where she had to stand next to it for a bit hacking to get the I'd after hijacking the drone.
---
You answered your own question. Work on your aim, if you can win those first gun fights that‚Äôll help the team. 
---
Fair and balanced
---
I feel the pain brother 
---
His smg has almost no recoil if you use vertical grip and compensator
---
You were peaking enough to see the cart in garage so you were most definitely peaking enough, the only problem is the killcam
---
Sens?
---
Both methods allow for boosting. Boosting is made possible by tricking the ranking system into allowing a better player into a lower rank. That can be done through both methods I talked about. 
---
took with an sas gun 
---
Yes I saw one yesterday smh
---
1. Do you have a comfy setup?
---
You don't have to feel any pain, uncomfort. Have a comfortable mouse and keyboard.
---
2. Do you have good headphones?
---
Sound is one of your best friends
---
3. Do you main a operator?
---
2 defense operators and 2 attacker operators are very good to main.
---
4. Learn recoil control
---
5. Instead of aiming for the head try aiming for the chest. Recoil should work its way up to the head
---
6. If the enemy knows your location change your position.
---
7. Warmup. Play some casual or terrorist hunt before a ranked game(best tt is lone wolf and try working up the difficulty)
---
Do you need a cast after that?
---
Practice man, do aim taining drills, record yourself and pick aparent what you do wrong, tell yourself what you gotta do right and then go practice doing it right
---
I did this and managed to go from silver 4 to Gold 1 after a season

the question is here , why you want to spoil the people's gameplay ?

There is already a roadmap for year 4 available showing what country each operator is from. If you want a Thai Op then Maybe year 5.

What if this is my main? What if I can't get out of copper

No, but you're being a dick. If you want to troll/mess around do it in casual. Ranked is supposed to be competitive.

It was something very similar to that

It's not that big of a deal. You still two shot people and you can actually do it more consistently across longer ranges now. The big nerf was honestly the mag size nerf but it's not that big of a deal anyway. 
---
Why does rook have an Fn9
---
I only end up throwing if I realize my team isn't contributing. Else I always go tryhard. I firgure if my team isn't gonna help me, I might as well have some fun.
---
Most games I wait until r6 chooses a person for me randomly (I like the variety, showed me a new love for twitch and IQ) but every time I get tachanka I get team killed the second the round starts, even on ranked it‚Äôs happened a few times 
---
Thanks for the credit!
---
This is how he ‚Äúsaves lives‚Äù
---
The same could be said for those who are in ranks too high for them. I only throw if I realize my team won't be helping me win, so I just have some fun while losing.
---
Same
---
That's fair then. But yeah you really can't get banned for anything except for hacking on pc, boosting with hackers (boosting with coppers though is permitted for some reason), and typing stuff you shouldn't type in chat. 
---
Okay
---
No idea I just met them at comic con

These mags are actually pretty close, and I dont have $63 to spend on 3 mags xD plus I'm pretty dang sure they dont let you take real mags to comic con (my local con is real funny about that)

Thatcher + rook + duct tape

That‚Äôs tight, I‚Äôd buy it

I only play with 2-3 friends and it's nice cause we'll kill the TKer at the beginning of every round with out getting banned, the messages I get are great. ( We always watch the kill cam to see if it's a legit TK or accident)

I will admit i hated Ubisoft for the shit i have experienced. I thought, "well yall made this shit at least fix it" until i realized something. I dont make video games. Never have, maybe never will. I dont know how to fix it globally. Who am i to trash someone for something i know nothing about? I watched a video from Get_Flanked as well which opened my eyes to Sony having some responsibility with server issues. Ubi just unfortunately is the messenger being shot. Im choosing to stay my anger towards Ubi, and instead keep enjoying their creation in my own way. If someone ruins it, they have small pp. But ill keep smiling cause im still having FUN. Thats what the game, community, and video games in general is all about. Preaching over i apologize

OH MY GOD, THEY WALLBANGED KENNY, YOU BASTARDS

Don't forget Airplane either! I pick one side of the plane and put all 5 traps down a hallway. More often than not, someone tries to rush through and gets themselves killed in seconds. It's hilarious.

This is awesome!

what's so bad about it being PC D:
---
You'll get downvoted, partially because Reddit loved South Park, and partially because of the wall of text.
---
You're right though. People act like South Park has intelligent commentary on issues under its comedy, but it very very rarely does. South Park is a show that does nothing to challenge the beliefs of its viewers. And that manbearpig episode is fucking stupid to this day.
---
Oh but it was. He PERSONALLY asked me to post it here for him.
---
Legendarily bland helm 
---
That's true but I usually end up picking Clash on Plane nowdays. She basically wins the front of plane singlehandedly, and is alright at basement and middle too
---
Um, what? No. You misunderstood me. I was talking about hitbox issues. Who in their right mind would blame developers for their game's community? You wrote an entire article and probably down voted my post for nothing. GG.
---
What if you were Tom Clancy himself????
---
Damn, what did you buy to make this cosplay?
---
&gt;youre retarded

Ok

You are so welcome :D good luck on your next cosplay ^.^

I laughed.

It's just typical ubisoft

That would be fun. Like an April fools joke for people who are known to be toxic trash.

Depending on what platform you play on there are a lot of ways to practise it, good luck mate, if anyone can do it it's gonna be you.

Same bro. Been playing siege since it came out. Played on every platform. (currently play PC) never gotten a black ice. It‚Äôs the only other cosmetic I want at this point

I just thought it was kind of funny

Except on bank ur fucked at every spawn 
---
Maestro or Lesion
---
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN! Do you know how many times I've gotten this exact headgear duplicate? 3. So far. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to play Thatcher (Black Ice L85) and Twitch (Requin F2)...
---
The points go away after a certain period of time. I suggest you use them now
---
im not the only person that thinks Kaid was nerfed too soon, pretty sure there are pro players that have shared this view, and i know that youtubers like Get Flanked and Matimio feel similarly
---
Kaids SMG is the worst in the game, his shotgun, while pretty good, is a very niche weapon, i like it, but its not an objectively great gun (not to mention that it took like 2 months for them to fix the recoil bug for the shotgun on console, making it pretty much impossible to use) and hes a 1 speed, he has a fuckton of traits that make him weak, so him having a really good gadger makes sense, him having 2 electroclaws makes him unable to be a reliable pick for keeping walls secure, meaning that if you choose Kaid, you will basically NEED to still bring Bandit or Mute, and why the fuck would you still hring Kaid if you already have either Bandit or Mute, hes no longer his own character, in fact, hes more of a trap operator than an anti-gadget operator now
---
in most cases youll be putting 1 electroclaw on a hatch, and then with 1 electroclaw gone, now you can only protect 2 fucking walls, its pathetic, not to mention that making barbed wire traps are where Kaid is the most fun, now you cant do that if you want to be valuable to your team and get walls
---
hes weak right now, they shouldve left the 3 electroclaws and nerfed them differently, maybe make it so each electroclaw can only electrify 3 things in its radius, not anything it touches, there are other ways of nerfing him without taking the 3rd electroclaw, and making him useless, Ubi jumped the gun by nerfing him, Nomads nerf from the TTS was completely justified, but Kaids was way too much way too soon
---
I basically only get common dupes now. 
---
And the best part is because of wonky servers and her own broken hitbox its entirely possible she'll trigger a trap but not take full damage from it. 
---
It was one of the road to si skins
---
Doc mozzie or echo
---
Facts
---
Thats pretty balanced matchup rank-wise. Stop complaining, accept ur own deficiencies, and then learn from ur mistakes. Simply, git gud.
---
Kapkan 
---
Kaid 
---
Similar in either "trap" or "acog" op
---
Except you only had three so you could never properly cover enough entry ways with it, the laser was obvious to anyone with functioning eyes, and there was also a giant red spike you could see coming through the wall that gave it away if you somehow missed the laser. 
---
Kapkan is much better now. 
---
Saw a whole lot of these from all types of games in a book/game shop yesterday. R6 ones were about 1500 RUB (~$25) each. 
---
But are you a 3 speed?
---
Yeah not hard enough flexer i guess i let my parents down
---
So bad 
---
You have never been in a ps4 lobby nobody puts their mic on. Besides im in EU nobody speaks english. And i solo queued to plat 3 so i think im not that awful for someone that doesnt play a lot.
---
And ur pathetic assumption just proves how stupid you are. Ur the one agressing me for no reason since the beginning of this thread lmao get a life loser 
---
Rank and skill are two completely different things 
---
Ahh the majestic pillow sausage. Listen to it sing as it unloads all 88 pellets into a group of 3 opfor.

Dang that is kinda crazy

how many lasting strats are made on the TTS? its often the case that a new operator wont have even settled intonthe keta by the time the TTS is complete, its just not enough time to know how OP an operator will be, Kaid wasnt broken overpowered on that TTS  he was a little strong, but he wasnt broken, Nomad was, so sure, nerf her,  but with operators that arent BROKEN, they need more time to settle into the mera before being nerfed into oblivion, drastic changes like that shouldnt be out into place so hastily, and thats why i think Kaid is considered so weak right now, hes basically a trap operator and hes not even a good one, you cant place him in the same category as Bandit or Mute because hes not NEARLY as effective at that job as they are
---
there's really nothing bullshit about this game imo
---
Yea, there's plenty out there. When I started, I watched kingeorge vids on YouTube. Think he has good attack and defend strats on all ranked maps, although might be a little out of date now
---
Fuck the pest they reinforced kids!?!?
---
And yet there are still hundreds of people on this subreddit that will defend to the death that hit reg is fine. 
---
Many of them Ash mains, unsurprisingly. 
---
People do care. Ubisoft obviously cares. The people who will knock you out for saying it care. And not only are you using a terrible word, not a ‚Äúmeany bo beany word‚Äù the worst word in the English language, you are using that word to imply the black people are inherently bad. Why does doing something ‚Äútoxic‚Äù in game mean they are a black person?
---
We need to extract the groceries 
---
Same. Nobody wants to work for a win even in casual. So what if it‚Äôs 0-2? A win is still possible even if you‚Äôre short handed 
---
So how do i prove this isn't fake to one of my friends?
---
Now THAT is a proper cosplay.
---
Yes.
---
''nice place nigga''
---
I cant control all of the recoil but i usually control it long enough to kill
---
Yeah. This message (which u prolly already know) was supposed to be meant for certain situation that aren't  like that. Like u said teammates are holding all angles in obj and decided to go and yonk the other kill from ur ace.... that is where it's a steal, but it depends if it's ranked or casual. Ranked, there is no such thing as kill stealing, because the whole point is to win; however in casual, it's definitely a kill steal. 
---
I just got number 20 the other day. All my friends hate me. I just have really good luck. Level 265ish
---
What's wrong with it, if you don't mind my asking?
---
Gimme the Ash!
---
I think your face is a bit too big for the hood. It makes it look like you‚Äôve lost your neck in the journey, to me. But this and more like this in the game would be terrific.
---
I could see this as a secondary ability like how ops have red dots and such sights on their side arms and so on. You could do the switch thing like with capitao and his cross bow while you are aimed in.
---
That's crazy
---
They should put this in game!
---
so then why are you taking it so seriously dumbass
---
Buy the ultimate edition comes with all dlc from 2016 and all dlc for 2019 plus Ingame discounts
---
no neck lol

---
Two of my favorite things combined. Well done
---
Well fix his hitbox for a start, decrease ADS time, the time you're flashed for and maybe make him a one speed.
---
Yeah I prolly should have done that but I was thinking well there‚Äôs only one entrance may as well just block that with my pests
---
Luckily they were generous enough to give us a knife round at the end, we still kinda lost..  
---
Oh and don't ask me how I got 5 kills, I have no clue either. (I'm level 30, most of them were level 100+)
---
It doesn't go well with my skin tone, and it just doesn't look good with the whole look imo (on me at least). Promise you Haha 
---
I find it funny that a dupe legendary doesn‚Äôt even get you enough renown to buy another pack. 
---
Increase ADS time*
---
What con did you do this for? I've been wanting to get into cosplay myself, but never really knew where/how to start.
---
what if i but the cheapest??7
---
buy\*
---
You just described glaz with extra steps and no thermal sights
---
Sorry Cav took my neck 
---
There's not a perfect place to start. Just pick something you like and run with it :) 
---
I live in the city Barstow üíÄ
---
Why does rook have the fmg
---
Why does it matter what your rank is?
---
Where?
---
You will only get base game 
---
Yeah I always thought it was that my friends were unlucky but then I see on the Reddit that it‚Äôs more common to have 0 than it is to have more than 3 
---
Dota2 added this as an option for ranked matchmaking, that you can set solo queue to match you in a lobby of no parties. It of course has the obvious drawback of longer queue times since it still calibrates rank involvement but it generally leads to more fair games. Seeing as how r6 is getting a steadily larger playerbase it should be something they consider now, as it overall makes solo play feel less of a mess getting stomped by stacked teams or assaulted by stacked allies targetting hate on you
---
You are correct. It‚Äôs been a while since I played, and I don‚Äôt play Glaz that often, so wasn‚Äôt really thinking about operators that are in the game already.
---
Yeah, letting Blitz run with his shield up actually made him perfect. Making him a 2 speed was actually terrible
---
Same problem here
---
Dammit Carl!
---
BARSTOW GANG
---
On a military base
---
Yeah 
---
That looks more like kapkan than kapkan. That's amazing.
---
Dude, it‚Äôs ok, not everyone who makes a post is plat. But you can‚Äôt have Kapkan above echo and list two causal maps for Mira and then claim plat. This sub is full of 14 year olds, not kids born yesterday.
---
This looks like it would be in the real game. thank you wide_white, very cool!
---
Is that a camera flash? Lmao
---
After a player‚Äôs first validated team kill, all further damage inflicted upon teammates or the hostage is reflected back to the player. When a player uses a unique operator gadget to deal this damage, reflected damage will impact the gadget itself.
---
in other words nothing changes team killing ppl can still get their one kill in b4 being punished in casual
---
Would have been better if you added the song aswell.
---

Show them my Instagram Lilpooly

I see this pic all the time on Instagram on those "knife" accounts with no credit

The standard is gonna give you the base game with the launch ops if im not mistaken, if youre willing to grind a bit to get the other ops it wouldnt be too bad, itll take time but wont be bad.
---
Bro I actually feel for you so bad. I was at 3297 last season and lost two in a row to not hit plat for my first time. 
---
I‚Äôve reset and still don‚Äôt have em, I bought the pass today should I contact Ubisoft 
---
If you buy the normal one, you get 20 free characters and the game functions as normal. The more expensive editions just give you more characters, but you can unlock these characters later on using the in game currency you get for playing matches. 
---
I'd say buy the standard edition
---
Dokk
---
After playing for 3.X (I forgot when Siege Beta came out exactly) I can say, emphatically, this is not true. At all.
---
Or often has *worse* results than if you just keep quiet.
---
I had made this when the sisters came out but I didn‚Äôt have reddit at the time so I just posted it now
---
Of corse it‚Äôs a Tik Tok
---
The user.
---
buffed rook to 3 speed and 1 armor?
---
R6 wiki
---
Not really considering that buying something that expensive for a cosplay isn‚Äôt justifiable 
---
Okay thanks
---
Contraversy 100
---
There is so many things wrong with this list. If rook is a S tier than Doc should be too. Ash is an S tier. IQ is an A tier and so is Alibi. Ying, fuze, and pulse are B tiers. Vigil is a B tier. Kaid is an A tier. Jackal is also an A tier. Mira is a C+ tier. Tachanka is an SSS tier.
---
Okay, I used to play on pc, now ps4 since my pc broke, gonna stick with my answer on this one. Maybe people just don't like you and throw every game they get into with you?
---
All jokes aside, really don't think it's that bad AT ALL
---
Sounds like his knees creaking
---
Who asked?
---
Impressive! 
---
Yeah, I guess it depends on where the impact was thrown. It looks like it was thrown at the wall. I still don‚Äôt see how it could get there so maybe bad throw.
---
Jagger's gadget won't protect him this time

True but I was so mad at the time

Say's it was mate and it ain't showing up anymore.

*downvotes*
---
Greetings Br√∂ther
---
Sadly, no.. once you get removed there's no way of going back and seeing their username/gamertag. I'm hoping they fix this myself.
---
Yes and no if it made an explosion that would destroy the corner of the map that would be pretty badass 
---
First time a cosplay has looked realistic.
---
Did rook steal smokes gun? And the man lost some weight!
---
I feel like they should do it like they do in halo, who ever gets team killed gets to choose if the person who killed them gets kicked from the game
---
That makes sense. paint.net isn't very intuitive to say the least haha 
---
brother you act like he died just last week
---
Or when people use the other pistol and not the pmm. Seriously I wanna deal damage not squirt a water gun at the enemy
---
In over 150 levels between all accounts I have never gotten black ice and yet all of my friends have it. My level 30 friend has it. 
---
Did the grocery store have ACOG‚Äôs?
---
"i" should be capitalised whereas, "Teachers" and "Students" should not. "im" should contain an apostrophe. "Question" should not be capitalised. I feel really bad for your students if your patronising and poorly formulated rants are a common occurrence in the classroom. 
---
Fto
---
Oh ok. That makes sense. Sorry for being so blunt :)
---
Actually, if on pc, all recent players will appear in the friend suggestion tab of uplay
---
Ah thank you, my mistake. I wasn't thinking properly :)
---
Maybe, I've not noticed any more fuckery than usual, I just don't like people blaming the camera change but it's not the cause of people shooting invisible people and getting killsa
---
I can see why. I haven‚Äôt played R6 since I think before December, what operator is that and what does he/she do if you don‚Äôt mind me asking.
---
That makes sense, thank you.
---
FYI
---
I mean yeah, but it'll be as bad or worse than usual
---
Get rid of your dumb shield and I will
---
I didn‚Äôt take it that way at all, plus you had a solid point to it, the idea of the flip-to-side magnifier really is pretty much Glaz‚Äôs gadget without the thermal capability.
---
She will always *scare you...*
---
Apparently it's being removed next season but I'm not sure
---
How
---
Your right. If it was the camera change you would still see a slice of his head on the corner of the Mira. That makes me think desync is more of the cause. 
---
Mozzie is a boy and he puts pests down that jack drones so that he can use them against the enemy team and it‚Äôs fine I took a break from siege for a long time and when clash was electrocuting me I was yelling and shooting everywhere bc I had no idea what was going on. Lmao
---
Stop adsing after you peak reeeeeeeee
---
Thought it was another operator card remake, awesome job!
---
&gt;[Check out the R6 video on my channel, totally worth watching :D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4OsKSv4UP4)
---
The song sounds very familiar even though I have never watched PaR, didn't E-Dubbble make a free style friday with this beat? 
---
playing r6 in window mode?

The trick is to close your eyes when you shoot and pray Tachanka guides your bullets.

smart people spend it on s1 pro leauge skins. similar pattern, better excecution.

It‚Äôs a different issue, I have a 1080Ti and get the same issue from time to time, started happening since they fixed the Fullscreen issue

The only one i have is for gsg9 pistol :'(

Thanks for listening and for being receptive! Cheers! 
---
That happened to me once, I bought an Alpha Pack and got the smg-11 legendary (for the 4th time) so I had enough renown to buy another one and from the other one I got the Deagle legendary..
---
Keep in mind that the majority of people playing the game are like between copper and gold. That they are struggling with certain operators doesn't mean they should be. 
---
I never said most people have no difficulties dealing with Blitz. I said if you know how it's relatively easy most of the time. 
---
Blitz isn't banned a lot in pro league because when teams tend to use shields (G2, DZ) the Monty can be harder to deal with, so their opponents ban him. And in general using shields is a very niche tactic, but when a team focuses on it it usually works rather well for them.
---
I also find it quite peculiar that you blame this sub of being the minority. Minority compared to whom? The road to SI playlist players? Those are mostly the same actually. If anything this sub is representing the casual populace of the game perfectly. If you want the die hard players who really will often times hold a minority opinion you need to go to the pro league sub. And you know what? Despite being in the minority they are right more often than not. Don't rely too much on majority decisions. If the majority is not qualified to meet a decision the result can't be good.
---
I got that but i have never liked it
---
It was such a steal back when too!

---
Best cosplay on this sub. No shitty green wigs and yoga pants will make do anymore 
---
You still have to credit the cosplayer
---
I used to get anxious in ranked. Now I don‚Äôt. Honestly the more you play the more comfortable you feel under pressure. Now I love when it‚Äôs 1v4 or 1v5 because I know they‚Äôre gonna get greedy and rush me for some free kills. 
---
If his comment was complaining about console it would have been removed by now too. Biased mods lol.
---
Can we not repost something that was originally on this sub already?
---
Man, the karma farm is real.

I love suppressor. I don‚Äôt know why, because I use compensator on almost every other fun. I just love the sound

That‚Äôs pretty good

If you look up you can see the joke fly right above your head

Ah I didn‚Äôt realise it was already on here. Just happened to me while I was matchmaking.

Apologies friend
---
Wait, is the black ice thing what the cool kids use? I think I have one for a 1911 lol. 
---
Alexa
---
On ps4 its pressing and holding share by Standard 
---
Yeah I was thinking these exact thoughts around a year ago lol
---
Ready this thread made me realize how lucky I am I got the 416 carbine black ice before I hit level 50
---
Yeah us cool kidz use them blackises
---
Welp... [This](https://2eu.funnyjunk.com/pictures/Rainbow_9aa766_6476315.jpg) is all that I have to say
---
i cant handle the controller, hence i need m&amp;k. microsoft and sony endorse me to do so.
---
They had us in the first half
---
My friend is 209 and still hasn't got one
---
This looks amazing, like wallpaper worthy. 
---
Yep extremly lucky, But maybe i am the one who is the most lucky as i am the one getting all of this karma :P
---
So, how's about IQ Elite or Ela? Green hair would be sick with your beautiful face :D
---
Neat
---
Ah shit, I've been messing up. I will use nothing but my 1911 from now on. I won't get any kills, but I'll sure look cool doing it. 
---
Don‚Äôt let those internet points get to your head buddy lolol 
---
Best comment I‚Äôve gotten all day
---
Fuze holding his gadget then you crop in post
---
Yes 
---
Buck threw grenade(s) too. Notice how some grenade icons stay there for a while, I was confused why impacts didn't explode immediately until realized they were frag grenades.
---
I like bandit with his nitro and 3 speed
---
Ya sorry but it's that way now stupid they only did it for 1 year. But the og 20 should be cheap to get. 
---
ah thought there was replays :(
---
Well we can't all be perfect. 
---
Replace "mouse" with "controller". 
---
Game is better than it has ever been right now
---
That's the S12k lol
---
I thought I was the only one trapping that spot. I‚Äôm not that genius after all...
---
Can you show me some evidence of that?  The ultimate description on the Ubi site right now says the following:
---
"THE ULTIMATE EDITION INCLUDES:
---
The game.
---
LEGACY OPERATOR BUNDLE
---
PLUS
---
Instant access to all 24 Operators from Year 1, Year 2 and Year 3
---
YEAR 4 PASS CONTENT:
---
8 new Year 4 operators
---
8 exclusive headgear and uniforms
---
R6 Charm
---
600 R6 Credits"
---
in your pants?
---
get it? mozzie short!! XDDD
---
but does that drop off curve affect gun fights that occur at about 5 feet apart?
---
&gt; Keep in mind that the majority of people playing the game are like between copper and gold. That they are struggling with certain operators doesn't mean they should be.
---
&gt; I also find it quite peculiar that you blame this sub of being the minority. Minority compared to whom? The road to SI playlist players? Those are mostly the same actually.
---
clear contradiction. if the majority think that Blitz is overpowered, while this sub doesnt, then this sub doesnt represent most people. 
---
&gt; Despite being in the minority they are right more often than not.
---
no, this sub is just filled with a lot of the game's fanboys who defend its flaws to the death. same shit happens in every other forum for every other game.
---
Boy are u playing or recording on/with a patato?
---
That‚Äôs the default camo for the Commando.
---
I love the bay blade spin out when kapkan comes back through the door
---
Is it really rape then?
---
i agree lol i wanna uzi rush someone
---
yeah i was level 100 when i got my first one and i got 6 more in the next 40 levels
---
I thought they updated the Kapkan card before reading the title.
---
Low quality bait. 
---
U gay 
---
He‚Äôs more of a shallow roamer but yes, he is a very good op for slowing down pushes and giving good sound intel to your teammates to where the enemy is.

Yeah but the artist is actually making the character cards they‚Äôre not just taking a snapshot of the model.
---
They actually draw in little things like even the lighting and contours
---
Eh, there are some pretty annoying bugs but I guess? I just dont play ranked cause I dont have 4 other people to play with regularly so it just isnt something I bother with.
---
Depends on the gun tbh, and at the same time body shots and limb shots do have different damage
---
Probably just port it.

but how when its all tk'ers throwers

Being 1080p it's gonna negatively affect the way things look compared to a 24/1080 screen, but 144hz could be worth it.

Thanks for the tip, I used to play CSGO everyday on PC but I quit about 2 years ago, now I‚Äôm trying to switch over to PS4 and play R6, I have games where I drop a decent amount of kills and then I have games where I do absolutely trash, just trying to find tips on how to get better, none of my friends in real play R6, so I‚Äôm stuck solo queuing in ranked.

I did this too, but it was with a shotgun, on a downed monty
---
Tower intensifies
---
I totally get that. I've played R6S since the beta. 
---
Just seems to have been a real noticeable increase in the vitriol a large number are spouting. 
---
Hmm I‚Äôm not sure, feels like it‚Äôs linked to the sensitivity and stuff like that.
---
The final seconds where the bank shows up as the city hall like the beginning of an episode makes it *perfect*
---
I‚Äôd pair her phone calls with an operator like Fuze for maximum devastation, and use the MK12 DMR with ACOG, Angled Grip and whichever muzzle attachment helps single fire. Also use the SMG 12 if you‚Äôre a fan of spray-and-pray, and CZ if you like suffering.
---
Also use the BOSG-12.2 whenever you‚Äôre not going 100% serious in a match. It‚Äôs a blast to use and can be sooooo satisfying to get kills with.
---
Rank, there are more ways to contribute to a victory than kills. Unfortunately most people disagree 
---
Are you a fellow southpaw or is the image flipped?
---
I don't see any ejection port or charging handle on this side of the gun so I'm assuming you are part of the left hand gang? :)
---
My first black ice was bought, there was a bundle for frost, also, you wanna really flex? Run jager with the elephant skin and the recruit chibi
---
COD and Apex have aim assist, Siege does not.
---
No you‚Äôre not. You clearly do not understand the game 
---
I would usually say that rank is more important than KD, but if he is going like 0-5 playing against the plats.. 
---
My photographer wanted me to hold it left-handed for the picture, I‚Äôm a righty 
---
Definitely rank, your KD doesn't mean shit if you had a pocket doc or were constantly using other people's equipment 
---
So I found thi new website 
---
*intensifies*
---
Doc is a team player imo so I think it's useless to do that but I know his statistics say otherwise.
---
me_irl
---
Ok thanks man this helps a lot
---
I can actually see that happening 
---
Actual video of me dealing with a breakup
---
Despite needing a connection to play solo Thunt, you aren't actually playing on a server.
---
Might that suggest there is a problem then? 
---
No problem 
---
When they mention him joining "the Unit" they were referring to Delta Force.
---
Nice shitpost mate
---
That was my thinking imagine how stupid it would be for the defender to be able to make attackers fall to there death 
---
hahaha I did what I could xd
---
Muzzle Break helps with single shot recoil
---
Lucky
---
The video maker only said it was an alpha pack exclusive as speculation, there‚Äôs no confirmation on that yet
---
Are we still down on that theory that Monika's nickname is Ick not aykyoo?
---
Why would the Acog have dual rendering? 
---
This might be an occasional bug that happens, as it happened before to me, however, I have a slight feeling your music volume is all the way up, but your sound volume is down. The music volume affects the menu sound for some reason. Check in options and if not, then it's unfortunately one of those things you have to deal with.
---
Oh look another person posting on Reddit without understanding the op. 
---
If you read the opening post again you will see no comment is made about the type or impact of the toxicity but just the fact there is more of it.
---
I agree
