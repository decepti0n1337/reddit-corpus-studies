Ok

Welcome to Siege.
---
It's been happening me the last few weeks as well. I lagged out of a ranked game. I played over 100 last season and that never once happened to me
---
Next shroud
---
Do y'all not have a calendar on ya phone???
---
Finally found a clash counter

---
Seriously guys I am a noob and have no idea how to tackle this bitch

Dont respond to him, hes a troll account. He just says dumb shit to get people mad.
---
Once again, been playing for over a year
---
That’s what the OP on IG said, and I kinda agree it’s a bit of a reach but to be fair when I first saw the Fortnite skin IQ elite came to mind so
---
Those pics were exposed to be fake
---
You seem pretty new to me ;)

Reduces Centering time, see? Forgot it also reduces first shot recoil as well
---
She’s obnoxious and is sleep inducing to play against. It just pointlessly slows the game down imo. She doesn’t really fit with the other ops either. And her voice is annoying
---
I don’t know what I think is worse, the fact that I laughed or the fact that I upvoted.
---
You know all jokes aside Clancy was a amazing writer (R.I.P Mate) ,and how he did it was well amazing as well it was helped a lot by his sources (note that his sources were the real deal ,but their identities have been concealed) ,so he knew exactly how things went for example the Splinter Cell series oh boy were they something ,and he knew what went down. (Splinter Cell series is the best on please @ me)
---
Why did you do this when you could have done that one fortnite skin where it is litteraly just blackbeard
---
No I don’t think I will
---
Why did everyone get  friendly fire warning like that? O.o
---
update?
---
It do be like that bro. I got kicked once at the end of first round after getting 2 kills and an injure. Only thing I can think of it that a few of my shots on the final kill cam missed.

There has been some server degradation lately but it should be fixed soon.
---
Maestro too
---
this isn't even from siege originally, this was inspired by chun-li
---
looks like another FORTNITE BAD GIVE KARMA post
---
I already knew I’d see this down here🙄
---
yes if they do it like modern warfare
---
input based cross-play  matchmaking 
---
would be great
---
I cry anytime I have that one :'(
---
Sensitivity seems a bit low but good job man
---
Thanks
---
monty looks like a classic Thomas the tank engine train
---
Honestly man, this game has one of the most toxic player bases I have ever seen.  People TK because they like to be assholes, constantly leave, are blatantly racist. It's honestly astounding.
---
Which is the most lethal?
---
Can you two not be super nice to each other? This is reddit. Nice things don't happen here except in r/wholesomememes . Rip each others throats out.
---
yes
---
*Every Rank Game During Burnt Horizon And Phantom Sight For Me*
---
Typically on console it's filled with mouse and keyboard... Oh wait... Thats all modes
---
it would be great, but there might be a few problems that would need to be sorted out
---
Have you been able to connect to an unranked match today? I usually only play that and ranked when I have friends on and I haven’t found an unranked game period. I’m on WUS if that makes any difference.
---
[uh dude, it’s called salt](https://imgur.com/a/EPbiYYb)
---
Seems like a typical thing for Ubisoft, For Honor is the same, I just expected them to have put some stuff in place to penalise people that leave and act toxic
---
#thanks
---
Find a team of players who are on your own level. And only play ranked with them, just play unranked or casual eith your current friends.
---
#yes
---
I expected to knife you while going for the wire.
---
The default keys Q&amp;E
---
When people ask for crossplay they're wanting console crossplay. Nobody in their right mind wants mkb and hackers in their lobby.
---
I am a jäger make, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE his uniform. I'm also an automobile enthusiast, so bandit's is amazing. But I'm one of those dudes that doesn't believe in buying what I can't see when playing unless it is something like a pilot program skin that supports a team, so personally, I would never buy an elite. I'm currently saving up for hibana's Nora rengo skin. Lord knows they need it, cause earning a livelihood as a professional in Japan is hella hard.
---
Prep phase, just wait a little
---
Native K&amp;M detection is already a thing and r6s uses this system to disable native K&amp;M on r6s. 
---
They can follow the cod system of, Controllers play together, K&amp;M players play together, Controllers can play on K&amp;M lobbies if you want to as a option.
---
Naw dude, they have a warden on their team, so it has to be somewhat resent.
---
I saw you blow yourself up at the end there buster
---
Lol
---
I like russian reflex cos other sights suck ass even the acog, plus its better than regular reflex.
---
But isn't the problem xim? Because they always release scripts that make it hard to detect xim?
---

---
Martydom: drop a grenade when killed
---
!remindme 1 week
---
Oh yes, I'm aware of that. I'm just putting the point of that one advantage of crossplay across.
---
(Though I can find at least 5 posts of people wanting crossplay because their friends are on PC but they don't have one).
---
You're the type of person who says I'm 6'0, when you're actually 5"11 aren't you?
---
I can only activate ultra instinct on my friends when they spook me, never on the enemy.
---
*initiate lion roar*
---
Oooh that's some good bait my friend
---
Who doesn't?
---
In the case of a three way tie, I'm pretty sure it comes down to round differential. Same with the head to head being two draws or a loss and win for both teams.
---
Nothing with native K&amp;M or crossplay will fix the Xim issue. Its two different features/issues. 
---
Xim just converts K&amp;M input into controller input. This crossplay feature will allow non cheating players to be better matched with other platform players. Xim users will still cheat on controller lobbies.
---
It didnt wanna

Cooked to perfection!

He is supper annoying but a nerf is uneccessary.
---
lol?
---
Good I thought no one would watch that long
---
Huh. That way. Well in that case, it's fine.
---
And then you win the next round...
---
Invisible traps, that can technically kill you doesn't seem a *little* ridiculous? Not even a tiny bit?
---
Although I want that o also just want to see acogs gone already
---
It depends on your playstyles, if you have a consistent team that can work together, then ying definatly, but if youre more of a solo type then lesion is probably stronger, he can benifit you and the team withoit any conversations or strategy
---
at first, I was excited, then I saw it was a tk and was sad then I saw it was a tk on clash and I was excited again.
---
Make it so we can cross play but only for custom matches
---
Oh but that was the best part, especially after watching you throw it 8 times.
---
Give me That Wiimote
---
But monty
---
Iq can spot em, thatcher can emp you can shoot them if you drone or get close enough. They aren't lethal unless you don't remove it at all for some reason.
---
Cargo shorts guy.
---
Yes.
---
Daddy ***needs*** that renown.
---
What do you mean he stuns?
---
Just the type of toxicity you can expect from a 13 year old I suppose.
---
Not seige not same level of respect
---
I also have Xbox but don’t really play it that much
---
How many times is this going to get posted! And it didn't even originate on this sub! It came from the WoW or LoL sub.
---
There's plenty of end game situations where you would be unable to remove them, not only as Monty, but as any other operator
---
Just save it or buy a lol more  credits.
---
Supressor...
---
What?
---
So he is both delta and green beret
---
Is this video sarcastic? I hate to break it to you..but, this might be the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen. Not even trolling.
---
#MMMMMMMMMMMMM
---
I wish I could draw
---
Okay
---
Maestro is tons of fun. Gets countered by twitch pretty hard but I’ve had a few matches where the cams have literally won my team the match. I’m only in gold though so he might get progressively worse as you rank up.
---
Bikini Bodhi aproves
---
Yep
---
I know I shouldn't, but I guess they just get to me
---
Was in genuine shock I didn’t get popped
---
Tf u say bout my spsmg
---
WELL YOU CAN брат
---
It offers visual cover against attackers while giving a vantage mira shield position. I do think it's great.
---
?
---
O  O  F
---
The most infuriating part of this game. I'm almost always killed behind walls, or before the person comes into view. It's always by some little trash talking pube with an edgy name and nothing better to do than be a a R6 version of John Wick. Piss bucketing poop socking gamer fuel drinking, bath water snorting cocklocker.
---
I was playing yesterday and it triggered after one, unless I missed one
---
Nice one man!
---
L
---
I want to say it's either a month, another week, or permanently.
---
That's Brother in Russian but Im saying you join in and try your best
---
It looks better than my IQ drawing. Nicely done.
---
And it doesn't need to be in this exact spot, it's the technique that's important. Alibi's use is for visual cover and this does it very well.
---
My issue with spawn peeks is that I’ll still get outgunned by a doc who is peeking some obscure kill hole now and again. I’ve never been mad about getting shot when I’m lazy but I swear doc with acog is getting real annoying.
---
If was a video I recorded from my pc lol
---
Ok, I'll tag you if I make somehing
---
Reported for hacks.
---
You seem very mad I’m sorry to hear about this
---
Then use shadow play or the game bar, just for the love of god no vertical phone
---
That spawn peek on the bank map comes to mind. Runouts from the front door can catch you before you have a chance to even ADS.
---
You can buy some cosmetics with skell credits (in game money what you get from missions) and other cosmetics you can unlock just finding from the map, there are only few cosmetics what are real money only.
---
So i don't see why people are mad about micro transactions, you can still have full game experience without paying anything after game.
---
not sure but if you keep on doing it, its for sure gonna result in a perm ban lol
---
True, there are definitely some spots that could be fixed
---
who really drones in casual tho
---
That was like a three stooges routine
---
LMAOOOOO
---
THANK YOU COMRADE, AND STRIVE TO BE THE BEST
---
:)
---
Should definitely work in copper through bronze. Above that though you're just gonna get rotated on from stairs and 90 and then you're pinched and dead...
---
This is my second attempt at using premiere pro for a rainbow six video, let me know what you think and what I can do to improve.
---
Wrong
---
Yeah, no text tho
---
I will admit it's fun when you actually do it. But getting spawn peeked in the beggining from a 100% vulnerable position is just broken.
---
Still doesn't explain why you'd want to shock wire when A, he's meant for walls, and B, if you want to stop drones use mute.
---
......as a pulse MAIN you can't do that? maybe you should switch mains
---
You'd be denying entrance at the cost of what? A wall that can do much more harm being electrified?
---
Nomad.
---
A seasoned player relies on audio and peripheral vision is supper important. Those are the main complaints Finka gets. How are you trying to brush those things off?
---
I think it'll work great
---
Pulse forgot the glue on the C4, rip
---
I think his barbed wire and electroclaw combo is harder to get rid of then Mute’s jammer and also does damage to Ops. Obviously Mute is a better option for drone denial because he has 4 but Kaid is still good. And you don’t need to use it for just walls and hatches
---
Nah the cut off was perfect.
---
It's all in how you use it. I always run pulse with the shotgun and have gotten many aces. Spray and pray is my friend with that thing. Keep firing until the mag is empty or they are dead
---
And here I am lvl 230 and only 1 back ice for a shit pistol
---
That's just seige for ya buddy
---
he doesn’t play console he just bought it to test it out lmao calm down it’s console bro there’s no pro league just play the game for fun. no need to get upset about things you can’t change.
---
[i edited it with joji's slow dancing in the dark](https://streamable.com/gutm7)
---
This is why I don’t play ranked at the start of the season on console.
---
The realization afterwards lol
---
stfu
---
I was waiting for an epic clip of you destroying the other team, but I got something better
---
If they banned all toxic players they'd lose 90% of the player base. That's just how siege is
---
The cameras in my school look exactly like that
---
are you dumb or what lol because you got trolled by your teammate once the operator needs to go like what are you saying.
---
Finish the top of his head haha
---
Coolio tho
---
I like your enthusiasm.
---
Big anger
---
Now do a Fo-12
---
I must be lucky then cuz I'm only lvl 93 and only really been playing to game for 4 months even tho I bought it about a year ago. Wish you luck on the next pack tho
---
You know I find red dot more comfortable on some weapons like the carbine.
---
Ye
---
okay cool i don’t really care
---
Not necessarily. If you are playing against a good player they will just prefire you and and insta hs.
---
It’s a slow burn until you get into the flow of it again. A year is a long time to miss. New ops, new maps, new strats. All you can do is keep playing until it you get the flow of it all. This game is in a better state than before, the new ranked, and now the unranked game mode. 
---
It’s gonna be rough but it will all click with time
---
Hello kengo19, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dclw55/i_just_opend_102_alpha_packs_and_still_didnt_get/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Esl is played everywhere... I used play esl on weekends here in Australia. Pro League is also played everywhere in the world. Beaulo (or however you spell his name) couldn’t play pro league until he turned 18 or 21 (I can’t remember) so it must be dependant on the country you play in, just like the classification.
---
Considering this is something that gets fixed on every reworked map because it’s a broken design choice from the days before aggressive sweaty COD style rushing was a thing... 
---
Been playing since closed beta. The maps have changed because the style of play has changed. Telling someone to deal with it is an asshole thing to say, and clearly not what Ubisoft believes. 
---
Remember when you use to be able to run around outside for 10 seconds before being detected? 
---
Yeah.
---
In your copper lobbies sure, in high gold and up he's instabanned.
---
not really say with the outside bottom run of alley, the electrical closet run out. if you see someone opens that door you just prefire the white generator and you easily headshot them. you can’t accurately prefire a open spot because someone could be behind the truck on the left or right side. by the ladder or out in the open but the defender on that spawn kill will always be behind the generator. and for all of the spawns you can just wait in cover and wait out the spawn kills if you’re that much of a shitter.
---
The team had 3 assists too, so those 6 kills may be a little inflated lol
---
I am referring to the jewelry front. That spawn kill you immediately spawn in a vulnerable position.
---
They are everywhere, can't stop it
---
No, I play on PC. Probably should've cleared that up on the post.
---
Outstanding play
---
West Virginiaaaaa
---
Give an example for what you mean by “defusing the Bomb” 
---
What answer is it looking for?
---
Oh no,  I got a quote wrong from a show I watched a few months ago.
---
Who shit in your cereal?
---
[removed]
---
Grind
---
I can agree with you on that for sure. It's up there with Villa for me, unbalanced but team focused and hard to master. Although I would never want a full rework, an entry way from the garage area on 2nd floor would be amazing and the windows on jewelry should be reduced to 4 instead of 6. My advice to you is to heavy roam. Roaming as vigil or cav will completely decimate a team in bank and the map is made for roamers to shine. 
---
Sorry for coming off so negative lol
---
 get your friend and just do something stupid only have shotguns atk and def only 3 armor try something like that or just take a break if you are not finding the game fun anymore then you should fined something else if you keep playing then you will really burn yourself out and end up hating the game
---
Dude im trying my butt off to get up there. But everytime I get 1-2 games away I go on a mad losing streak.
---
I actually really love villa, lol.
---
Mountain mama
---
I want to say I'm disappointed by your name/flair but I'm really not
---
okay then don’t spawn jewelry but you can still prefire that and put a drone out there to watch for the runout. you being lazy and not checking the spawn kill is completely your fault. you know about the runout.
---
don’t miss this map
---
There is already a Hibana a Vigil cosmetics from that show leaked rn.
---
I don't think it's an event but maybe just some promotional thingy.
---
I always stare at this kind of security cameras in real life and wanting to shoot them down. I think it is a common mindset among Siege players lol
---
Thanks for the new lock screen dude, it looks rlly cool
---
Much better tbh
---
Lmao
---
We get posts like this ever other day.

I like the mental image of a whole 556 casing and all being just thrown at people

That is the first time I heard someone call Lesion "Lesbian" but I can stick with that
---
He’s my favorite Asian lesbian in R6 :P
---
Oh got it. I would say Maverick if you can learn how and where to blow.
---
Basically all of the operator bios are full of stupid and silly things. The devs didn't even bothered to google for more than 5 minutes before writing the bio for a character.
---
Finka doc lesion and bandit are the drug lords. Why on defense? I have no idea. Hibana sort of but shes more of a user. Smoke is a kind of.
---
My mains as well!
---
For those who don’t know, DO NOT USE A VPN ON THE DEEP WEB ANYMORE, VPN companies are ratting out their users for illegal activities

Biggest OOF
---
Alibi Prismas - Not the only way to use it, but I enjoy it. Don't meme with them (stand on top of them). Use them as a block and only on windows with no way to rapel near them. They will have to use removal to get rid of them such as nades, twitch drones etc. This acts as an early warning mode to entry. Personally I like to keep one with me, that I can drop and pickup depending on where I am trying to go. As most people treat them and expect them to be "set and forget."
---
Compensator a flash hider are pretty much the only two you want to use on automatic weapons. Compensator if you like just holding down the fire button for long periods of time as it decreases overall recoil. Flash hider is for mostly short birsts, something like the first 5 shots recoil are reduced at a higher rate than compensator, then nothing after that. Muzzle Brake is for single fire weapons (pistols, non-auto DMR) Don't use a sepressor ever, unless you are memeing.
---
Most of the operators you are choosing are support with a pretty straight forward playstyle.
---
Zofia - go for vertical play up or down, make sure your team clears ADS' first. Very useful on skyscraper when apartment is being played. 
---
Mira - Locations, basically just watch what other people do. A lot of is is just opening up long angle walls and placing a mira window with a lot of play in it. People despise challenging it, just having them placed well can make teams waste time.
---
Dokkaebi - Just send out your gremlins when people are making a push, avoid playing when the enemy team is playing mute. If they are roamer light it's less useful, but still good. Super fun if enemy team runs a bunch of vision (like Valk).
---
Hibana - I switch between Thermite and her based on the hard breaching needs of the maps. You just play support let the team do the work and mop up. After your gadget is done, do what you want, her guns are great.
---
Ela - Not really a fan, someone else will probably talk about it. Maybe try hiding stuff in holes, not sure if it would disorient but you can do that kind of stuff with Nomad and I find it funny.
---
Other then that, just play and have fun. You will learn as you go no one will be amazing when they first start off.
---
even harder to one tap it on console
---
You can crouch and aim and flick all over the place with a controller also. You probably just suck
---
We europeans dont have this problem
---
Task failed successfully

I wish I could combine jäger's last year spooktober headgear with his elite outfit

Need proof he has a skin AND you can mix and match shit. Like you can customize it how we customize our ops

It was 4-4  and i clutched a 1v5 in the 9th round too

Clearly you did

wow

Different wording please your giving me A fucking aneurysm trying to understand what you said

Intergalactical OOF

You need to slap some flexglue on that sum'bitch
---
Took you 30 minutes to spell "siege" wrong and put a G above it instead of a 6
---
I don't believe in aim trainers since it's hard tomatch your in game sensitivity. I've been laying 2 thunt games before i start my ranked match and i've been doing better every day.
---
Stole this from TheRussianBadger
---
Same thought.
---
I am mostly going solo into matchmaking and 8/10 matches i have a team which can't communicate, then dying to lack of droning and corner checking. Leaving me alone and the match ends with 2/4 while you have 12-16 kills and your mates 0-1 kills and might even beeing salty/toxic to you because you didnt rushed it after they died. 
---
Please if you behave like this, there is a mode called casual for you. 
---
In ranked we need communication, combo picking and teamstrats!
---
Ranking up and down daily between gold1 -silver 1 and getting sick of uncommunicative 4 stacks or salty 14yr olds.
---
nice 360 trickshot wallbang across the map
---
None. Give me new maps, weapons and useful operators.
---
Sky*craper* only imo.
---
There were still 15 seconds in prep phase lmao
---
I have a question. If you wear your cosplay costumes in public doesnt that count as impersonating a LEO? I mean if youre in the fitting country for the operator people could really get confused.
---
How old are you?
---
Lesion main.... 
---
Phatetic
---
It is very easy to tackle her. Get close to her as fast as possible and bash her. One little bash will knock the shield sideways and then you can shoot her easily.
---
Ehh a bit overrated joke and kinda cringe but hey it’s your comment not mine.,.
---
I mean isn't slowing down rushes and slowing people down literally one of her jobs? As far as I can tell she only works in a coordinated team and is a great support for winning a match instead of getting a kill. Although she really is annoying to play against when all she does is bully everyone attacking.
---
Love the flair
---
When I do..It’s to the black lady with Chemo
---
It's always quiet till you start playing against Eastern European kids screaming into your ear.
---
hmm okay? XD your comment was cringier XD but hey its your comment not mine
---
How so?
---
Not if they don’t know where it is, and you can also in some places electrify a wall and deny the area above the wall
---
I’ll take your word explain
---
That’s what I loved, the creativity his kit brought
---
.
---
During the six invitationnal I was hoping to have his headgear, nope
---
That was the dumbest clusterfuck I've seen and the recruit flying out the smoke was amazing
---
Smoothness is the no.1 tell, you can see it's controller movement when the aim is short jumps.
---
1. ur aim was extremely horrible maybe rethink ur sensitivity.
---
2. u did hit him three or four times can’t tell exactly from the sound but the dmg listed is for center mass hits but you did hit arms and legs that’s the explanation.
---
Eu, na, asia?
---
It’s either that or I check another angle just as the peek the one I was previously watching
---

NA

I will check out

This cunt gets it
---
What platform do you play on good sir?
---
Land your shots noop
---
My pistol aim isn’t very good, but then again I shot him the brain.
---
look at where hes standing. Hes not at cover, hes way behind it. Hes not also sitting at one of the windows, but him not knowing the better spots arent something to chastise over. He put his team downrange while he wasnt aiming at anything. And if he wanted to prefire he should have def been going from another angle. Just like real tactics, never put your team downrange of your gunfire
---
Please tell me you at least got plat in the end
---
*insert Zack Galifianakis wheezing meme*
---
Same happened to me a week ago
---
he wasnt holding the angle tho. Kap needed to be able to rotate behind van. He shouldve been pressed up against van for proper cover. He forced kap to go in front of him. Ill take the karma hit here, this guy caused his teammates death by not giving him room to move around, this is on OP, whether you guys want to agree or not. It was pretty unlucky yea, but at the higher levels of play this kind of self unawareness costs games. Its the little things that make the big things
---
Yeah I agree but I’m pretty sure seige is set in the 2020s. I could be wrong, but I’m too lazy to fact check myself
---
I want to fucking charge into that door not matter what and destroy it just for then realizing it was really a damn door

Get a load of this guy

We’ll behave this time I swear, just let us have our ACOG back
---
I find it absolutely hilarious that people are legitimately mad about this
---
The doorbell needs to be the sound of the barricade being smashed.
---
Grtz u actualy landed hs, most of the clips here dont.
---
That’s unnecessary just quit being a dick and get on with your life. He’s enjoying the game u didn’t buy it for him so let him play and keep ur comments to yourself
---
I don’t think he needs it, but if they wanted to, remove the impacts. At pro play, it gives him too much utility
---
bit more aim based, bit more confident
---
Well, you can lean without aiming, just aiming in general is a lot more fluid and just feels better. Your aim will feel a little less "random" if that makes any sense. But also on PC prepare to get absolutely booty clapped on the first few days, it happened to the best of us lol.

I swear every time someone plays rook, they place the armour when I'm positioned off site REeee

Nice

I try to place them on high places for some reason

Never thought about this. Makes sense though.

I visited a while ago to try out Ember Rise, their office is so cool!
---
it gets blocked out automatically. they removed it due to people getting banned for saying normal words that contained bad words in them like Cus"tard" etc.
---
Lmao my team gets mad when I do that (In the rare occasion I'm anchoring.) But the best way to annoy a teammate is to throw gus at them so they're at 98 HP it didn't do anything, but it feels like it did lmao
---
My sledge hammer is becoming a hard breach.
---
Not really, she would have still had to go through the training GIGN have to go through. They would have just ignored the "5 years in the police force" part.
---
There would be a little more risk at the start but you would be able to tell rather quickly in training if she wasn't %100 cut out for GIGN
---
It's good, nice tracking compared to the other CQB optic sights available. I personally run it for that very reason.

The scope has nothing to do with the weapons damage that's just not how guns work. That being said I use different scopes depending on the gun including the red doot it's just a matter of whatever you feel comfortable with

# Hi everyone,
---
as there was a lot of positive feedback on my original post and since it got a lot more, and I do mean A LOT more attention than I ever thought it would get, 
---
I decided (from popular demand) to make a neon logo for each, and I do mean each and every single OP in Rainbow Six Siege.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For this to not seem like I'm milking reddit and for you guys to get these wallpapers as quickly as possible, I will be uploading them daily in groups of 4.
---
I'm starting with year one and moving up to the last season and will continue to make them as future OPs come out IF the demand is high enough.
---
Please upvote this post so everyone gets to see it and use it.
---
After this goes up I will be uploading all the wallpapers on my instagram story as free wallpapers for your phone!
---
If you wanna support me in any way, that would be greatly appreciated.
---
* My yt channel is [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5bA-ByEc3FJfdj1aYerv4A?view_as=subscriber) Ping404, and I do put a lot of effort into it.
---
* My insta page is @ping\_not\_found where I post more art
---
* And the imgur album is [here](https://juratefanovi.imgur.com/all/).

It's simple people should only buy the elites they like want to, I like the IQ, bandit and hibana elites so I own them, I don't like the thermite elite despite the fact that I play as him a lot so I didn't buy it 
---
Not all elites are going to appeal to everyone
---
That was great, I couldn't have done better myself!
---
Tbh why doesn't six-12 and the suppressed varient have the same camos? That's big dumb.
---
This has me curious, are the wall reinforcements based on a real thing! Can I buy something similar in real life?
---
At least your aim is on point!
---
They have less points than you top teammate, how could they be hacking and not be top of both teams leaderboards?
---
This is not the shitpost I expected I needed. Take my upvote.
---
Generally our police don't go out in full TACOPS gear, and we only can suit up during closed door events or conventions which allow Milsim/Polsim cosplays.

no it will just completely cancel the whole message and you'll get a message saying that inappropriate language cannot be used

May i ask what pizza did u order?

Nope, just did the GSG9 team, brits are next, then russians, then americans and then I'm moving up to year 2

There's room behind him, you don't hold an angle close with an ACOG because the whole point is the zoom. It's generally a good idea to NOT run into friendly LOS. Within a certain distance he can't react to your movements fast enough to not shoot you, it's not humanly possible.
---
Favela, Airplane, Skyscraper, Tower, House, Yatch, Hereford

And the 1 speed says "let me open that up for you bud"

No you will not you will have to start over and buy the game again.

Why is nobody talking about the Guy in the enemy team that is named nik-ger

Why isn’t the welcome mat a welcome mat?

---
Ye but the devs mainly care about the pro science which is on pc, so u console players are unfortunately not as high priority.
---
Can y’all stop being bitches about how I play the game? I’m not that new to this game but I don’t know all the diamond peeks and angles.
---
Then the renown won't be there. I think it also depends on whether you buy it on steam or not but I think it's a seperate account.
---
That name pops up and it can only be one question.
---
There are other offices in the building, so those lead to those. It seems like an odd reflection though.
---
They moved one or two floors up and the other side of the building. Place looks even cooler now. The toilet indicators (male/female) have names from Assassin's Creed Odyssey I believe. Overall, pretty cool dudes/dudettes.
---
With that vertical line on the net it reminds me of the bounty hunter from darkest dungeon. But other than that its looking pretty good!

how about he just adds doors. doors that creak when opened.

This reminds me, there was a weekly event for a Predator  charm. The challenge was to win 10 rounds in multiplayer. I did that and I collected the reward, but I never saw the charm anywhere when trying to put it on a gun.

Thanks for the clarification, and yeah I get that your head sticks out past the corner. I just had to train myself to hold farther into the corner than before.

Some commons can look good though
---
Wow! So much sKiLl !! Teach me how to Trace him, PLEASE!

Your hands are gonna be so fucking greasy bruh. Just wait to play after you eat. Please.

i do that all the time

Ok, thank you

At least wash your hands between rounds. And please dont spill the sauce on anything. It would actually kill me
---
&gt; they can’t compete with other PC players so they come on console for a significant advantage
---
In this exact case would OPs solution not solve anything
---
They would still use the adapters to  go against controller players

Shoulda made it a castle barricade to be extra protected

Not very secure tbh. 3 hits and you can break in.

Lol cool

this game has female spetsnaz (finka). and mega fat ops (roadhog? forgot her name).
---
dont look in too deep, its silly
---
This ............... What have u created?
---
I did, but then I learned that it's pretty easy to do this one lone wolf on House in the workshop as Alibi. Placing the Prismas at the top of Side Stairs, between the corner of the railing in the Upper Hallway and the eastern wall of Workshop, and the last one about 10 feet outside the window in Workshop that faces Front Porch Top covers pretty much all the ways enemies could approach. You can use the windows in Workshop to kill about half the enemy each round, as a fair amount spawn in Construction site or by the Garage Entrance. Besides those approaches, the enemy is most likely to come through Side Stairs, Kid's Bedroom, Master Bedroom, and Bathroom, in roughly that order.
---
No rainbow six siege it came out in 2015 1 month from 2016, that's just the very first rainbow six game made, unless this is a joke, then nvm.
---
That's why every bio feels like a poorly written fanfic since year 2 started.

It's not a Ubisoft problem it's a Microsoft problem... Just saying...

Imma new to this game pls explain

Good job

Guess I gotta Wallbang

Not really, it's kind of bs to get spawnpeeked one second into the round.

Aight I’m gonna stop replying to people in this thread because it appears everyone has selective hearing.

**NOT ALL PLAYERS USE IT FOR AN ADVANTAGE, TOTAL NUMBER OF XIM USERS WILL DECREASE, DECREASE IN XIM USERS = GOOD”**

To put it into an equally simple analogy for you to help you understand better: 
---
*You have 10 serial killers in custody, is it better to:*
---
A) Sentence 3 of them to life sentences 
---
B) Release them all back into the public and take no further action.
---
But the bigget question. Do they have broodje kroket there?
---
Not hard with the new ranking system lol
---
That's amazing
---
Make sure your team members dont shoot you I in the back beacuse you're a rooky.
---
Smoke as a pest doctor is so nice! Great work
---
Log out if Uplay and then back in. That fixes it for me. Not sure what the root issue is.
---
Surprisingly no, it was all done on defence while he played as lesion
---
#F#
---
Are you being dense on purpose? i'm not saying votekicking should be removed, i'm just saying people shouldn't abuse the system, but you seem to be in defence of people doing that.
---
You think a 4man should kick people just for finding them annoying or any other minor reason.
---
&gt; To kick anyone the rest of the players don't want to play with for any reason. 
---
 whereas i think that's fucking childish. its a different story if they're actually being disruptive/toxic (destroying team gadgets, afking, blocking doors or shooting teammates on purpose) 
---
but just kicking someone because 4 people happen to not be very fond of them is beyond retarded like "i don't wanna play with him cos he make me sad :(((" like grow up dude.
---
Sledge mains wya
---
Oh this is gonna sting a lot
---
Probably during halloween
---
I see that maya in the back... (Nice)
---
&gt;i'm not saying votekicking should be removed
---
from OP:
---
&gt;votekick should be disabled for parties of parties of 3+
---
read what you defend before going ham
---
&gt;:(
---
How are you supposed to counter him? There's no counter
---
Elite bois
---
He's hacking
---
Same thing here, I'm one match from plat rn because I played with friends but when I solo queue I'm gold 4. There's not much you can do about your past games, so the only option is to keep working at it and hope for the best. On the bright side, the higher you get, the higher you'll start next season. And the more you lose the easier your opponents become!
---
i wanna punch it

Oh and he was also using wallhacks; while playing Unranked of all things

So... usual casual match, picked IQ, and there you go. I have shot, look around (the compass shows that I'm turning), the silhouette shows that I am moving, but I cannot move the camera other than panning.
---
My apologies to the dudes that I played with for the match.
---
The clear answer is to get a pc
---
That's the dialog volume isn't it?
---
Why is ash still in game? Lol
---
Probably around the 28th October is my best guess.
---
Best way to figure out any ceiling that you have doubt about is to go into a custom game as sledge and start breaking all the soft floors from above. Going in yourself and getting hands-on will help you remember it more than any video will. 
---
Unless you’re just really good at memorizing what rooms you need to be in based on the site.
---
I rarely get DDOSed now at diamond on PS4, all the people who were doing are scared now, pretty rare for people to dos now

This is actually me but against my friend AND teammates
---
Hear your surroundings, you can easily hear the torch
---
twitch.tv/kyledemort :)
---
i had before that is why it's so werid.
---
come on...
---
That's not a counter dumbass
---
Yeah, I'm the same way, one game I'll get 8 kills and a bunch of headshots and the next game I'll shoot between the legs. I think some people are naturally better at fps games but you have to just keep working at it in terrorist hunt and whatever. In the meantime, if your aim is off start playing ops that are bigger assets to your entire team
---
Tell me how to counter caveira then
---
They can’t really do that anymore. There’s only a certain amount of guns they can have in the game
---
[deleted]
---
He's beginning to believe
---
As artks said, when he uses his torch, he is really exposed, the fact that you cant notice when he does, doesnt mean everybody can't, you need to just pay attention
---
Yes it is you fucking idiot it’s called have a clue what’s going on around you plus his holes are two way and it’s a easy headshot just don’t be bad
---
We literally are already getting a scream fortress this year, what are you on about.
---
Yes, yes I am
---
For a moment I thought that valve was an EDD.
---
It still has a pretty large player base, yes.
---
This is sick
---
Cash Cunts
---
It is never terrible to be a 1 armor, speed&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;armor. The advantages of 3 speed far outweigh the disadvantages of 1 armor 
---
That being said he shouldn’t be a 3 speed. But he does suck ass so I’d be fine with 2 speed or add ACOG
---
Not everything has a hard counter. Sometimes they just nerf the op or the ability. They nerfed him by making his torch WAY louder than it used to be and he's pretty easy to kill if you spot him opening a hole all you do is point your gun where the torch was and shoot when you see movement. 90% of the time it's a headshot/kill for you as a defender.
---
Well you see the mp5 and the mp5k are two different guns requiring different licenses plus the only reason why game ssuch as battlefield have so many guns is beacause they call guns different things and change there models a lot something Ubisoft won’t do beacuse they want to keep a few things accurate
---
I personally really enjoy his commentary, he is very positive and enthusiastic. He’s not quite as experienced as other casters, but I loved hearing him in pro league. My only complaint is occasionally he gets a bit too fired up about memeing. I recall one matches where he was rooting for EG to play Tachanka while the poor guys just wanted to play. Besides that, I think he adds a lot of personality and enthusiasm to the table.
---
Yes, they both shoot .308 irl and they are even using the same style of magazine, the [X-91 drum mag](https://www.xproducts.com/product/x-91-50-round-hk-g3-hk91-high-capacity-magazine/).
---
Kinda what I expected, everyone has there preferences, continue being good at the game lol
---
This
---
Bro... this looks amazing ! Thanks a lot dude
---
“Not my fault you’re being killed by cheaters, they don’t need banning”
---
Not me. I expect it’s something they would like to add but I wouldn’t expect it this year
---
Yup just wanted to throw it out there. None of the changes you are requesting are broken except warden in a place where his gadget and him being an operator is useless.
---
How did you get diamond this season, with all the ddos madness???
---
Couple of points to note here:
---
Twitch: acog removal doesn't do anything. We saw that with ash; her pick rate was back up after an interval. Her problem isn't range versatility, it is 980 bonkers rpm. Drop the rpm or replace that gun with a slower gun. acog removal on a gun that is used for closing the gap to under 10m only gives people the incentive to do that on a more repeated basis.
---
Nomad- I agree.
---
Fuze- you drop him to 2 speed he'll replace twitch as fragger supreme. If you want to do that, drop the ak's damage to under 43 to make it a 4 shot, and take his smokes away. and his shield.
---
Cap- his speed isn't the problem, his gadget's versatility combined with it being uncountable is. Give him a counter and problem solved. His guns are too slow to even try to capitalise on his speed.
---
Glaz- he's fine. People don't play him because they don't have any patience. In his current state, he can actually be used as a entry fragger Because of the low charge cooldown.
---
Moz- balanced. Needs no changes. I see no pro or streamer asking for one, and I watch most of them.
---
Ela- take away the swing. Kick is manageable. The horizontal swing is bad.
---
Bandit- for what Joy do you want to touch a balanced op?
---
Jäger- again, for what Joy? He's overpicked because he's the only anti-projectile op in the game, and attack has an unnecessary number of projectiles. He needs  a buddy, not a Nerf, and that buddy is coming next season.
---
Jackal- he's fine. He counters a bad roam/site setup. Don't roam alone. You rarely ever see anybody roam alone in PL unless it is a late flank or a vigil. He is his own counter thanks to the 5 second variation ping. 
---
Lesion- are you hell-bent on making him useless? He's countered by SO MANY ops.
---
Valky- they are exactly like how you want them to be. changed the  mechanics of cams to make them follow c4's trajectory, which already reduced her distance DRASTICALLY, and then changed the camera core position so you can't clip through stuff. She's fine.
---
I hear you. You're saying there wasn't enough data. Even though a conclusion was drawn from the data given, which was never falsified and found to be true. Not enough data though.
---
if anything she needs a buff. at least her SMG should get buffed.
---
Have u ever walked on a floor a hard floor with wet shoes, you can hear the footnotes for miles lol
---
Oh yeah. Don’t get me wrong. He is obnoxious. So is echo. But every op is obnoxious in the hands of the right player. I’m not calling you out or anything.
---
I don’t know how long you’ve been playing siege, but there was a point Montagnue and Blitz were super OP for quite a while. Especially Blitz. Then Ubi overnerfed them to the point where they were unplayable. Then buffer them again, and then people bitched enough here we are today. Where they are at this moment is virtually unplayable. But they will become balanced out again. They’ve been through many ups and downs since launch. Montagnue is still good for Bomb plants and protections, but even then he is bleh.
---
I did the same thing and have returned about a week ago, watching YouTubers play and other things like that made me desperate to return - I’m having more fun now that ever before
---
&gt;If it isn't broke, don't fix it. 
---
Finally.
---
that's not the point, your points are all unbalanced and based off you (probably a gold or below) dying in casual. If you want to discuss why you're wrong, feel free to PM me, because I don't think anybody with a sane mind agrees with your post.
---
Yes they do, the problem here is that the actual size of one is almost half the size of the other despite both being essentially the same magazine.
---
but it's not inconsistent. You're just shit at countering bandit or Kaid.
---
I think it is popular, I’m on EU and the longest I’ve waited is 2 mins.
---
&gt; Even though a conclusion was drawn from the data given
---
Where are you getting that that was all the data Ubi used from?
---
She's a good artist.
---
Yes it fucking is inconsistent. Jesus this subreddit is fucking retarded
---
Dokkis secondarys are impossible to control.
---
What sensitivity do u use? And what ops are Ur Mains?
---
Where is this elite skin?
---
When did I say all players use it? I just said majority. If you want to expect this to drop in terms of xim users, maybe like 10% would decrease which is nothing.
---
Your analogy makes no sense as there is an option C) Keep them all in prison for life. That is the action. In Rainbow there is no option C) It's either play controller or play with xim as a controller.
---
sometimes we could win out on defense to go 3-0 and they would hit it off, though we had so many games lost to DDOSers so idk how honestly 
---
After ubi announced the DDOS thing it’s reduced exponentially, almost non existent now, made it way easier tho rank up, also diamond this season was 4400 as opposed to 4500, making it a little easier
---
Since they changed the defusing from bashing to using an electronic device
---
I started a month ago and would say I'm somewhat alright at the game. Also play ps4 so is there anything I can do to improve?
---
Caveira and Glaz! She makes them looks so crisp!
---
You can actually use the valk cams not going out to your advantage in some spots. There are some sick bank lobby cams you can do because of it.
---
We need more DMRs
---
Marry her
---
I’d say she’s pretty balanced. Most cav players don’t even interrogate anymore (even when I’m attacking it annoys me that I’m not interrogated) the fear of cav is her main ability, just seeing that icon at the top of your screen prompts caution amongst the attackers but she can be dealt with pretty easily, especially if you stick together.
---
I love his elite skin
---
Nice👍
---
We'll see you tomorrow buddy
---
Had a guy leave an unranked game while I was interrogating him the other day, came back 5 minutes later. Just laughs in the all chat.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;FIXED – Fixed an issue with Attacker side logic bias during lobby creation. Attacker and Defender side assignment is now completely random.

Main operators this season are thermite, maverick, hibana, capitao, doc, smoke, bandit, and jäger

My most players operators of all time are thermite (240hrs) and smoke (230)

also think I have like 180hrs on doc and 130 on thatcher

I've said this and got downvoted so just reassuring you if you do get downvoted you aren't retarded Reddit is

No it isn't. Show me clips of Hibana's gadget being inconsistent this season. Because her gadget doesn't crash the game let alone does it fail to detonate. If you want to get better r/SiegeAcademy is that way.

Thx, your welcome.
---
I like the filter
---
I wonder if their locksmith is just a guy with a sledge hammer
---
Ela - since when do you play r6 - have you ever met the no recoil ela headshot laser beam?
---
Fuze - Fuze would probably becoman an even better gunner than Twitch, with his gun having almost no recoil - so I think he is good as a 3 speed, or make him a 2 speed and nerf his AK
---
Warden - sounds good to me he definitly needs another buff
---
Thank u
---
Ah the good old Amazon.com/products/ssd
---
Ye I played then. Now her gun is useless after 5-6 meters. The horizontal recoil is ludicrous.
---
I guess, but he seems to seriously lack knowledge on strategies.
---
now shoot down lion's E-E-ONE-D
---
ubi servers catch fire
---
Got it! I totally forgot pros use impacts on hard walls to destroy hibana/thermites charges. I’ve only watched a few games
---
Had a match last night where my team was just me an 1 other guy and it didn’t even say anybody left
---
no your right, his ability is too dog shit, even if he did get acog (I would want the MPX acog, p90 is shit) doc/rook/ is still the better pick
---
Idk what they’re gonna do, its tricky because he could be too good if they make his ability too strong, I personally just wanna use MPX acog would be a laser

Bandits mp7 is fine, OP is making a lot of Nerfs for the sake of making Nerfs, the valkyrie idea is absolutely shit as the whole point is that she can place her camera almost anywhere

That’s so fucking cool :(

After switching to PC I actually believe PC has more brain dead players that are all aim and no brain. The amount of ash rushing dumbasses at plat 2-3 is ridiculous.

I don't like Velly, however, he just needs chances. Yeah I know the casting isn't anywhere as amazing as our current four, but at the end of the day, it's better to let siege expand rather than stay closed off if we want the game to grow. We need to give them time, idk how long though, because I never clicked off with Milosh but now he's my favorite so I cannot complain at all.
---
Right 😂 i didn't even think about it i was just hoping it was burned up
---
r/GhostRecon
---
I see you have it now. Nice man
---
Yoooo
---
Did you mean the soft floor? Or IQs gadget?
---
Both have been around for awhile, but the electric defuser was added when the animation changed
---
You’re awesome
---
Now i can delete this lol
---
In my experience, french will talk french constantly, even if its only one player and nobody else has even said a thing in that game, germans will talk non stop if there is another german in the game, eastern europeans are a mystery
---
It costs $250 for a 2TB SSD. Why in the hell would I ever do that when I could spend $50 for a 2TB HDD?

They can make it so you can't get an abandon penalty after getting kicked out of a match for poor connection.

Hello MicrowaveMmmmmmmmm, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dcuuon/oof/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

You have dropped the defuser

Buck and Frost or Smoke and Mute
---
play ranked or get in a multiplayer thunt game and at finish of it click keep the team button or sth you see next to find another match button and choose a little map like house on settings when you repeat that you'll be alone at some point and you're gonna play like lone wolf but you'll get 130 renowns instead of 30 by yourself

Your arm 360’d

what happened

Sorry you got killed by such a nonsense death *PYSSY_HUNTER69*

---
oh no
---
Let's also mix a bunch of toxic hatred into all those
---
A full, electrified shield she can spam AND a machine gun, the only shield op with one.
---
These are sick as fuck
---
If you could make Buck that would be 🥴
---
$$D
---
Valkyrie would be almost useless on any map that has a roof as high as fireplace on chalet
---
Attack: blitz
---
Defense: recruit
---
Defence changes a lot for me, right now it's between echo, maestro, bandit and valkyrie 
---
Attack: Zofia
---
Yeah, marry your wife dude!
---
Yeah! I just showed him this one and he really liked it because he’s a Cav main!
---
Jackal : don't get banned 3 times
---
Cav, too. I've tracked cav through an entire building before from the roof xD
---
Sorry forgot to put /s
---
no you can buy devices such as xim to trick your console into thinking your on a controller
---
I've tracked cav before on her gadget.
---
Same
---
Wait what
---
Because not everyone has the ops
---
It's been 17 hours. I haven't eaten, my family are worried. I'm still waiting. Please come home
---
Console is how, change my mind.
---
Or taking it away in my case, let’s go.
---
I feel like it is pretty much what you could expect from such a video.
---
But at least I now know I will most likely never have to shoot a dog in Siege.
---
Watch for kapkan trap
---
Look it up yourself
---
Microwave.
---
#MMMMMMMMMM
---
It was only one person, so whatever it was, it was only effecting him and not worth my time.
---
No because you brought it up. Don’t make a point if you can’t back it up
---
Naked fried chicken, lumpia, honey sriccha sauce, soy sauce and lemon.
---
I'm not so sure SSD's are the problem. On either my hard drive or SSD this game loads the same, my issue was actually something with my nat type I had to change.
---
So you're either a ten year-old or a moron. Only two possible explanations given you have wide access to the internet.
---
Probably ddossers that got banned
---
Sadly, I can't do it in console
---
decoys lmao after two days everyone will know what they sound like, and its gonna be another shitty op like warden
---
Ah I see it's just because I've had a similar situation on console.
---
TIL there's a Ubisoft Netherlands headquarters. And i'm dutch myself ffs
---
Better than I could ever do
---
Angles and perspectives are the weakness of this game
---
lol weak excuse? retard go and interrogate the developers about it
---
You can stop worrying about grenades now.
---
Lmao someone’s salty. You upset that you yourself  are downsyndrome retard? Lmao
---
It depends.  Can you hit his week spots consistently while he rushes you?  I can't so I'd much rather face a Monty.  An aggressive one can be a nightmare, but most people play him conservatively, allowing me time to maneuver him into a disadvantageous (for him) situation.
---
\^This.
---
:Smoke:*
---
Yea is that not smokes symbol?
---
a very strong ability that's the crack talking, the pros don't like Nokk and even said she's weak and brings nothing to the table, her pick rate in pro league is the same as Finka's
---
Probably passively farming renoun.
---
I’m sorry I didn’t know there was a single piece of the Berlin wall was still up, and on that piece of wall there was a painting of a handshake on it. How could I not know that incredible small detail of history? I must be a moron!
---
Can you make Blackbeard?
---
I actually think the p90 pretty good
---
But Nøkk is my favorite op... there can only be one favorite op lover here
---
I just checked my online stats because I’ve been seeing everything about this, and I dropped from a gold 3 to a fuckin silver 2. This is bullshit lol
---
the S is capital
---
Thanks!
---
Ah thanks.
---
Hey u wanna go bruh....? Let's take this shiz outside...
---
This may be a console thing then, I recently moved to Europe and so far the voice chat in R6S is pretty much the same, with no clear stereotypes.
---
Since the goddamn iPad was added dude come on
---
They play Rock Paper Scissors
---
is that not what he was going for?
---
Looking for group post?
---
Nah. Im recording every time i saw one.
---
Check this vid:
---
https://youtu.be/00Cdn0aO7CA
---
Yeah It’s just one of those tricks you have to learn from a video or from someone, because it’s not what you’d think would work well, but it does anyways. Siege do be like that sometimes
---
Which you should be able to do
---
Personally, I would say Rook. He gives all defenders a slight advantage in gun fights.
---
Tachanka
---
I personally choose Cav
---
Last I knew was that it originated from babe, as a fast spoken babe easily becomes ba/bae. Before anyone else became a thing later on.
---
Right now either Lesion Masetro or Echo.
---
When the fuck
---
Actually the 3rd October isnt the day the wall fell (9th November is the actual date for that) so the charm doesnt fit 100%
---
Maybe i do maybe i dont ;)
---
Source? I thought the whole reason console PL died was because of no aim assist.
---
Aoutocad is a very usefull app.Its wood isnt it?
---
Depends on the site and game mode
---
But Cav, Valkyrie, lesion, jager and mira are pretty good as well
---
Put maestro's evil eye on top of the yokai, it's foolproof
---
Ok your correct it is not illegal but is basically cheating, want proof look around in YouTube for a bit the people there are not lying sorry for being PARTIALLY INCORRECT even though third party shit seems pretty fucking illegal, fucking pc player
---
Yes
---
Hey and PULSE, the more ya know
---
Oh no you’re back to Copper V
---
It plays the animation for collision but bullets actually go through it
---
I never said it’s not cheating, I was saying it wasn’t illegal, there’s a BIG difference between the two.
---
And you’re mad at me because I actually play on a PC?
---
Is it considered a flick when they walk into your sights?
---
I'll take 5 for me and my boys
---
I’m assuming this elo is for this season because the ddoss problem was rampant in the first weeks
---
Jäger
---
Put a C4 on it and make it a RCXD

#JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE
---
Elite skins are based on the operators past
---
I want to make  something like this but with iron(i cant work with wood,aluminium is my fav)
---
Brain:
---
Blow it up
---
Me:
---
Why tho
---
You gotta
---
You're an ass
---
Hi big dumb I’m dad
---
Placing cluster charge
---
Yeah me and my friend were discussing it and we thouroghly agree
---
It’s something with DDOSd attacks I think
---
it did get posted multiple times
---
But if people think video games causes violence . It's because you play the game wrongly
---
Doot that’s amazing
---
oh sad
---
I did the math. 
---
He got 400 Elo from the match and an additional 20 from the Season Pass bonus.
---
400 + 20 = 420
---
420 is weed number.
---
Now laugh.
---
Its a bigger percentage than you think, from what i hear high golds are starting to use xim too now. Its not a disadvantage, the logic here is that anyone can now use mnk to even the playing field.
---
Please give Bucky boi his elite as well while we’re suggesting skins
---
Makes sense but punishing non cheaters for this is not a viable system. They punish players who were on a team with the ddoser / cheater but were unaware, I know they cant determine this but is a suspension for the person involved not enough? Or track and retract the mmr for those in a squad with said cheaters. 
---
I win 55 points per game yet i only played a total of 11 matches. So that means all six of my games that I won were removed from me with a total of 11 losses if the calculations work out. Its a shame, especially for those that try to work towards diamond. I was plat 1 in previous season and had only started my placements on USA after achieving plat 2 on eu. Oh well
---
Like I meant it 100% and didn’t tell it ironically get r/woooosh
---
New operation: drones bitch.
---
 Operator terminator:
---
gadget. Fuck all of California: gives all the shoes and close of the operator. Till the enemy is scared into a fetal position 
---
Granade: litterally molten lava in a can
---
I actually kinda get it with the Vector, such a ridiculous RoF and recoil.
---
This hilarious
---
it means that someone from ubi is watching you
---
How will you know if you injure someone through a wall and like you not gonna be a pro if you use it so why use it
---
Probably his elite, as it has to do with his past life
---
This is great news! ddosers we're quite literally destroying the game for everyone
---
But im also Mira main on defense :P
---
Im still new to R6 can someone please inform me of what is happening
---
Yes must annihilate him
---
Welcome to copper.  Ohhh my god.
---
Okay so I see your downvote but I don’t see your reply, maybe it’s because you fear being wrong, but here is the product that Sony licences: https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/accessories/specialty-controllers/ Sony fully supports the use of keyboard and mouse in FPS games on ps4. Now I’m aware that this may upset you as even though it is hard facts, it’s not what you want to hear, unfortunately sometimes the truth hurts :(
---
I like the smonk elite
---
They need to revert the fire change, i mean its proper when enemies shoot it and your teammate dies rff doesn't trigger i don't know why that same logic can't be used for hostage.
---
Also jager ads needs to counter the damn capital bolts.
---
spooky scary
---
Fo real or..
---
You know the bandit trick? Placing the battery just in time to thermites charge gets destroyed. That's kinda the same with Mira.
---
Can you do Lesion next?
---
Imo it's really meh, and the headgear is a reskin of the urban smog headgear.
---
It never had a red eye in-game.
---
Guess what I don’t care about what ps has to say it is different on Xbox
---
I believe this is completely correct.
---
Here you go!

Damn bro. still haven’t memorized the link yet

bro 😎💪
---
Wtf LMAO
---
Fuck off bot
---
USA Reganomics if you're looking for a camo otherwise the chrome one the one you gotta buy with irl money.
---
New map is def better and more balanced that old kanal but old kanal was MUCH more fun.
---
There are some websites setup to match your CS Sensitivity, you can try using those.
---
Thermite on the other side is placing his explosive charge, but you can actually hear him placing it so you can place a bandit battery just in time so it destroys the change, witch is called the "bandit trick", people use it cuz if you place them at the beginning of the round, attacker will just destroy the batteries or thermite just won't use his charge on that wall and use it somewhere else. But that way, you can destroy his changes. The same is possible with the Mira windows, like in this video.
---
I believe that in most situations, Kaid is a good operator to have.
---
Well duh. For some reason they thought the ops were cavemen
---
Or just a giant dildo since he fucks this game so hard 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Not only are you a cav main, and you also rick roll.......
---
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD MEET SOMEONE LIKE ME
---
Worth noting too that the actual connection symbols that apply at any given point in time are about a second late; OP has cut this video in such a way that we cannot see if they got any red symbols.
---
It was chaos.  We obviously coped but Nomad was a must in a ton of situations.
---
a hacked one will always be blue, and a normal one will only be blue when it's scanning
---
&gt;all companies who make consoles have fucking stated that it is illegal
---
Sony is one of the companies that make consoles, and Sony support the use of it :)
---
With a good team he's still just as good, you were never meant to frag with monty, he can still block doors and he's wayyyy to good on post plant.
---
Kill all five enemies each round I suggest
