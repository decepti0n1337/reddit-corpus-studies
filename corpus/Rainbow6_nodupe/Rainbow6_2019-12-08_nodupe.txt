BRUGH

It is New Zealand. Notice the size of Japan, the UK and Ireland?

So in reality, why are we even talking about it if it wouldn't be added for these reasons?

Now that I look at that I could buy that actually. Why are they so small ? Lol.

for those dog lovers out there, what if instead of an actual dog, it was a robot dog?

it could look something like Boston Dynamic's Spot, or LS3

Wow...you're not really smart, are you? Can you swear on your life that you've watched every movie and played every game that came out 3 years ago? Can you ask someone who was literally born yesterday if they did? I'm not sure you'll understand, but I'll try: just because you've seen something doesn't mean other people had. Your experiences don't mirror other people's experiences.
---
Try out the in game benchmark. It should easily tell you the amount of fps you should be able to hit on most maps.
---
Wait a minute
---
Alright tnx ill give it a try
---
Not sure how playing Zofia to kill an Ela shotgun is a good example of using her passive. She has a passive just like how operators like how Dokk can hack camera's; not just call phones, how Echo is immune from her calls, how Cav doesn't leave footprints, how Doc can revive himself, Ela is also resistant to grzmots, smoke immune to his own gas despite other ops having a gas mask.
---
You can look at videos, play the discovery playlist or custom games to learn the new maps. It's only your fault if you don't know the map.
---
What's your laptop? I got an MSI GP63 8RE, it looks a lot like yours.

It's not Vreddit, unsure if it'll work. You can also yoink it off youtube if you want.

Not gonna lie I like this idea but give him like a skoprion msg as the secondary maybe
---
Thanks, I love it.
---
Agreed
---
I disagree. I think having glaz as this middle of the road more close quarters friendly DMR type is fine. No reason to make him more like her. He has frags, good rifle with a recent fire rate upgrade that is reallllly good. He gets conditional thermal scope, which is certainly helpful if you choose to play that playstyle with him (and using smoke grenades). Or you can make less use of the gadget and take the frags for more entry fragging. I think he's in a good spot vs kali. 
---
Besides, I think the days of adding new weapons on a whim like that are long gone thanks to licensing.
---
You guys all complain about realism until it involves assholes. Now you don't want it.
---
Glaz's sniper has been buffed before and he always ends up being way too overpowered and then nerfed the next season, there is no they would add a new secondary no matter how much anyone wants it. Kali and Glaz are both quite different, Glaz is more useful for defending teamates planting the defuser while smoke is down. Glaz after the buff this update isnt great but he doesnt need to be touched, if hes used correctly he can be extremely deadly with any team comp as long as you have smokes and good communication.
---
Yo holy shit its ree kid
---
Leave him alone and let him do his stretching in peace damn.
---
Should've done the skrim meme instead
---
Why
---
Operation dancing tides
---
This would turn blackbeard into the worst operator by far. Seriously, this seems like a joke or you are salty from dying to a blackbeard.
---
Let's start with the fact that blackbeard has a pretty bad rifle. With a slow firerate, high ads time, and high recoil, he relies on his shields to kill people.
---
By only making his shield take 1 bullet (I know you said 2 from more than 25m, but most gunfights are going to be less than 25m), his ability is more of a hinderance than a benefit. Especially if he can't see while moving if aiming and moves slower with a shield.
---
You said in the comments that blackbeard punished people who can headshot. Perfectly reasonable, but blackbeards shield can be broken in 2 shots from most guns. This means that if you shoot 3 times in the head, he will die from a headshot. With a 1 bullet break, blackbeard now dies in 2 shots. If anything, this encourages players who get lucky headshots to kill bb, rather than players who can consistently hit you in the head.
---
So, this is essentially what you are promoting. Blackbeard loses a shield, his shields become weaker, he becomes slower with a shield, and he can't see while moving and aiming. In exchange, blackbeard gets a claymore...
---
This would turn blackbeard into an operator who's gadget will be gone on his first gunfight (if he even wins it), and after that he only has a terrible assault rifle.
---
This is by far the worst operator "rework" I've ever heard of. You nerf an operator in 4 aspects and instead give them a different gadget choice.
---
Nah do i need to flex with the black ice
---
Mozzie and Gridlock replace Ornstein and Smough.
---
There are plenty of ways to learn the map and the situation will be the same when the map is eventually released if people havent gone to the effort to learn the map.
---
I kinda did this üòê for emphasis
---
It's not as bad as it was like 2 or 3 seasons go. I had this happen last season. But like 3 seasons back it put me in 10 different ranked matches at once. Went from gold 1 to sliver 3 or 4. But yea they really need to fix this.
---
Wait, that doesn't stretch the picture right?

They generate a decent mount of heat, and because of this, thermal paste can dry out. If it dries out, you need to replace it, or heat generates faster than it cools, thermal throttling, etc.

Learn the maps, and operators. This game is team and information friendly. It will improve your gameplay immensely. Don‚Äôt play newcomers, because it‚Äôs mainly smurf accounts.

They fucked the lighting like Kanal and made it all bright and removed all the Shit from the rooms like Kanal and took out train. 
---
Fucking pro league is runing this motherfucking game and I'm sick of it they literally killed the ambience of both of these maps because they said all the textures/ stuff on the floors and walls was distracting and the darkness make it hard to see enemies which is the same goddamned reason they removed night maps. 
---
I'm over the 18% of the playbase plats,diamonds,champs deciding every change in this game it's total bullshit. 
---
I have 40% vision in one eye and I had no problem seeing enemies in the dark but PL and high ranks wanted training wheels put on the goddamned game. 
---
Over it after 2500h TBH every season they ruin perfectly good maps and content

It might work, but the rule is there's a timer between each distribution...

...and this operator has no guns.

You are just unlucky unfortunately. If you go to https://squads.tm/game-r6 and r/R6STeams, you can get yourself some friends so you can avoid any toxicity further on. Trust me, this game is more fun with friends in general.
---
My friend as I said you idiot that they have a average ping of above a hundred and the increased packet demand when stuff like getting shot puts even higher strains on their internet
---
Probably partied up with lower rank players

yeah all g, just takes some practice

I now have this on all my guns

I don‚Äôt have this issue but I mean come on. If you have a solution for this write it in a comment so everyone can see it.

I‚Äôll show you de wei
---
because ubisoft hasn't fixed the unranked boosters. fyi unranked people can queue up with anyone regardless of the elo limit, so they exploit it
---
feel free to go report it https://support.ubi.com/en-US
---
I mean, they were unranked though, so shouldn't that queue them up with the highest rank in the 5 stack?
---
Damn he kinda vibing though üëÄüí¶
---
Yeah for sure. But I think when people tend to be unorganized (not stacked) or uninformed they're going to lean towards banning blanket problems vs specific things. annnnd here we are. lol. It's all good. The time of the jackal will eventually pass, and they'll be concerned about another op soon enough. Things are cyclic like that.

I really like the concept. A Jackal operator on defense would be pretty nice.
---
But 2 critics here:
---
1. Emotional.
---
 Having to shoot a dog is just too evil, dude!
---
2. Realism.
---
 There's no such thing as "Attack dogs". They are used as drug finders for EXTREMELY small ammounts of time, as they easily get tired and lose focus. They also aren't effective at tracking down humans.
---
 If we still want to mantain the original realism of R6, this concept should stay away completely from the game.
---
Annoying right, I was trying to prove a point
---
If pewdiepie was a character in rainbow.
---
Yeah, I lost 0-4. Ended up losing 82 elo :(
---
Lean, check corners, and listen for footsteps.
---
The more I've been thinking about this idea and the countless other K9 op ideas that will very likely never make it in the actual game.
---
what if a K9 op gets in R6 quarantine?
---
I think that could be more interesting in a PvE environment, and would fix problems that people have with the idea like having to shoot the dog.
---
Doesn't matter. Most games cancel the match if it starts off with a leaver. 4 years in and people still have to play 3 v 5s from the start
---
You didn‚Äôt even make a point . You just decided to act toxic and ‚Äústfu retard‚Äù.
---
Look at dis dude onohohoh oo ·µí·µí ·µí·µí ·µí·µí ·µí·µí
---
He knows de wey!
---
It would make longer queue times. There‚Äôs no mmr restrictions cuz it‚Äôs casual bruh lol
---
Nvm you're hopeless lol
---
yeah, but maybe think about playing the league. Its gonna be a lot of fun
---
Damn big rip you should get a 5 stack going
---
Family friendly icons?
---
Yeah same here
---
It literally uses the same mmr system as old casual
---
First quick match is causal but renamed second imagine how many smurfs will be made if there was skilled match making so there will be no difference

---
Yeah that literally happens to me all the time. I regularly have this problem. It's just part of solo que
---
Seems like you just wanted everyone here to agree with you lol. Are you even ranked or are you unranked? If you're unranked then no shit you won't have good match making. I agree with everyone else here, the match making in quickmatch doesn't matter at all. I don't understand the people who literally only play this game to play casual. If you don't want to get shit on either get good or go play a single player game. Literally no one cares about beating anyone in a "quickmatch", the only important game mode is ranked.
---
Nah, they changed that feature this season. If Goyo places the shields near the hostage and they get destroyed they give goyo the kill, but if an attacker picks up the hostage and places them next to a goyo and then shoot it, it's the attackers kill
---
Tl;dr: Volcan shield near hostage bad
---

---
I think it‚Äôs a good idea
---
Dude calm down
---
Silence retard
---
Much better.
---
No trains, so that's great.
---
No longer seems like 2 sides joined by a sh*tty rotate.
---
Gargoyles and dining replaced by dragon is definitely better. I can see dragon being the most favoured site.
---
Drugs is the same as before. Barrels also same.
---
Now here come the problems imo, but they are still initial impressions:
---
1- upper arcade has TOO MANY hiding spots. Too many arcade machines.
---
2- while the bottom floor is much less of a maze, the top floor is complicated maze. They removed trains and replaced it with a couple of rooms, so while the 2 top floor sites are similar to the old ones, what's between the two just got a lot more complicated. Which means, you'll need a very solid roam clear, which basically means attack will be wasting more time, and that's a plus for defenders.
---
3- it's like the whole of Cafe and drugs side of the map is almost the same but the work office and dragons side is different from the previous version. Recognisable, but with many changes.
---
These are just initial impressions. Map's good because there are still 3 viable sites, and no trains. But we'll have to do something about upper arcade and the junction between top floor sites.
---
Go somewhere where your opinion is wanted
---
If you only have the 635 folder it means you own the game on¬†Uplay¬†or on the¬†Epic Games Launcher. So delete the 635 folder. Then follow these steps -
---
- Start Uplay¬†in¬†ADMINISTRATOR MODE¬†and¬†DISABLE THE CLOUD SAVE OPTION.
---
- Launch¬†Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege.
---
- Once in the game,¬†customise an operator's loadout and complete a¬†Situation¬†to allow an autosave to be created.
---
- Exit the game, and¬†RE-ENABLE THE CLOUD SAVE OPTIONS.
---
- Launch¬†Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege¬†again.

You should receive a prompt asking you which save you would like to use.¬†Select the local save option¬†- this will also update the cloud save.

I mean they do keep tabs and escalate bans? I think it's about as good as we're ever going to get with friendly fire on, friend. Outside of a stack, a guy can't kill you more than once after you flag him?

Long ago they talked about flagging full groups and working that in eventually. I'm sure they are still working on that bit in the background. It's really not a big deal though.

---
I know this is said a lot, but firing in 1-2 second bursts really helps you get consistent accuracy. I use flash hider on all my guns because of this (reduced recoil in bursts), suppressor will work as well. As for peeking, you can lean the opposite direction from an angle you're holding to minimize exposure and suddenly switch the other side for a quick peak, preferably with a pre-fire if you know what angle the enemy is holding. Listen for sound queues to determine what elevation the enemy's head is at (going prone is typically very noisy, but most will be either crouching or standing). Try going for wallbangs if the enemy retreats behind a soft wall, but no so often that it becomes predictable. Use callouts with your team, preferably with a ping so that your teammates can flank the enemy.

Yeah but I haven't bothered binding them to anything, it's a good idea though, I never thought of using them for that purpose.

Ïã† = god Î®πÎäî = eating ÏÇ¨Îûå = person , so literally it translates to god-eating person (god eater).
---
i started at Op Red Crow, man i loved the lighting and darker maps and night maps, now its a joke, the game looks too cartoony and boring to play the same maps over and over without night maps
---
Definitely try it
---
Sorry :(
---
No I am playing active since 4 months and I am already know everything

Whichever one you think would be fun for you. None of them are anything special

Hello Fec_DYS, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e7r142/where_is_that_guy/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
So what is your answer? I should get it or should not get it?
---
If you exit the save clip  page too fast it will only save like a couple seconds of the video. To save the full clip at what time you have it set to, you actually have to press save clip in the screen
---
Yeah for sure
---
She is good on certain maps, but she's really fun to play.
---
Lol how did you do that
---
It‚Äôs always worth learning. It‚Äôs not going to get any less complicated so you might as well jump in sooner rather than later. There‚Äôs a bit to learn when you first start, the learning curve is very steep. But once you‚Äôve picked up the basics and a general idea of what you‚Äôre doing you can start improving a lot more by focusing on the detailed parts of the game that you want to work on
---
Vibe check
---
Kali brings more utility to the table
---
You are gonna get them all eventually, so it doesn‚Äôt matter too much.
---
Yokai can handle this, probably
---
I joined the game a little late (Ps4)and I had to stop playing, even in casuals every game I was getting voted to be kicked no matter how good I performed either that or people on my own team calling me trash Just because my map knowledge wasn't that great , I was fine at the shooting and gadets and won a lot of rounds/games but the toxicity is to high for me
---
It all depends on personal preference, but in my opinion I'd go with kali because of how OP she is at the moment, also amarus weapon choices are subpar at best.
---
Interesting. Thank you
---
You cant make that your username.
---
If u think the word dude set me off, u r more retarded than i thought

i wish i could say the same to u, but i dont wanna take pity on someone who is so small minded that  doesnt know how the world works, id rather enjoy ur miserable, mere presence and ruin every minute of this moment in ur life
---
The metal arm along the side of the screen snapped at the base and took the screen with it. I'm never rough with it either it was just a design flaw.
---
Spoiler dude
---
Hmm I still can‚Äôt decide, thanks tho
---
Only after hostage is moved

Isn't that the watch Big boss has?

plz dont fix ubi

Sooo... Why then in csgo if you kill 4 in 4v4 it displays that you've earned ace? In League if I remember enemies wouldn't be aced in mode hexakill unless you kill all of them, I mean 6.

---
So perfectly timed.
---
Yeah im well aware of that
---
So your proof is that you spend a lot of money ingame, a 4 sentence screenshot and a link to your profile?
---
So you used cheats and got banned? Yeah not unlikely that new accounts just keep getting banned. Could be a hardware ban / ip ban.
---
Nice. When Grim Sky came out I was wondering if they'd do this.
---
Welcome to rainbow
---
Okay but the files of siege are not edited because it was a fresh install of siege and havnt touched the cheetos
---
No I didn‚Äôt. I fucking hate that people repost the same fucking memes to farm karma and for some goddamn reason it works.
---
AMaRu iS a GoOd OpERAtoR
---
He is Kenyan not Ugandan
---
I mean the other shit in the screenshot is just out of the topic,
---
The 2 other proofs per say are to back up my reasons as to why I didn‚Äôt cheat
---
Yeah but im surprised im getting crossbanned, becuase i have never cheated on my main which is lvl 236, that would be a waste of the acc but it got banned anyways, do u think battleeye could get rid of the hardware ban?
---
Yes, clearly this is my fault...
---
Rip
---
Then perhaps they have flagged the ip or device.
---
There isn‚Äôt any point in arguing for the account back you were once a hacker and therefore should be banned in my opinion
---
Btw that was 2 years ago they have removed it..
---
Leave
---
Woahhhhh random people online were mean????? That must be a first!
---
Report them and move on?
---
I like the idea
---
I hacked one 1 account, the account i got for fucking around, therefore its unfair to ban my main. But i accepted it as an additional punishment, but what i dont get is that my new acc is banned then. Cuz im not a cheater, i dont need cheats to play well
---
But why would they? You cheated so your accounts get banned, that's the penalty for cheating.
---
Spending money ingame doesn't prove you didn't cheat, just that you spend money
---
But you have cheated that‚Äôs the point
---
No . There is a cube that Lok has seen during the "dinosaur" event
---
Fair enough, i cheated.. thats an offense but why woukd they not let me play the game, i have over 2000 hours in that game
---
Yep that's the one
---
in total there's 20 female operators but idk
---
Man what is it with you and acogs
---
Mine has a cooling boost (which you can probably hear) and I have a laptop stand with a fan
---
I have seen this before, I think it might have something to do with the fact that if you check the damage of her gun it only does 97.
---
Cooling boost baby
---
Uh, you do you mate.
---
How'd you know he was there
---
And im not asking for the account back on which i cheated, i accept the penalty for that one, i am even willing to accept my non cheater acc getting banned because i broke the rules, but not allowing me to make a fresh start is like after someone stole something from a store giving him the death penalty

Sounds like a small latency issue on Sony‚Äôs side. For me PC was exactly as I am used to.

Casual has a monthly rotation where some maps are taken out of play. You can also see that Fortress, House and Plane are missing. Oregon amd Chalet seem to be missing as well, buy those are definitely in (un)ranked play still so I don't know why Ubi wouldn't have them in casual.

Yes it does. Why wouldn‚Äôt it? Then anyone could get any rank by abandoning

I mean 2 leaks i saw on youtube mentioned the attacker is a male and the defender is also a male.

it can happen because recycled guns are a thing now, They might have even ditched female operators all together.

A sequel would mean same type of tactical multiplayer gameplay R6S currently have. R6 Quarantine is more toward a campaign story based game.
---
And that's not even the first time. 3 games that I played before was always 4v4
---
Hibana mains, assemble!
---
That‚Äôs what already happens man the ban time increases the more times you leave ranked games
---
As usual with most popular multiplayer game, you're probably playing on an underpopulated server, at an underpopulated hour probably...Something like "2 AM on a weekday on the Oceania server"
---
Oof
---
Have you done the door frame exercise? It was in an old Youtube video that showed you the height to aim for headshots.

I know who she is, but the fuck is wrong with someone who says shit like you just said?

You got downed before the impact got the enemy, and you didn't have rook armor. How did you win?

It‚Äôs been a terrible siege experience since moving to Europe.

This is a great edit!
---
I‚Äôm on NEU and it hasn‚Äôt been bad for me

How much more is it increasing? I know that you get 30 min ban if you leave but after that?
---
Block the network connection in the router software or unplug the console after starting.
---
That sucks man, I feel like the server quality this patch has gone really down :(
---
Thats the point, its not a competitor to r6 since its story mode, so it wont change the money flow for r6s

Well yeah, that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs used for. Just don‚Äôt try and contest with a Blackbeard, and flank him or wait.

I increased by x2 every time so it goes 30 mins 1 hour etc

how do i get gridlocks' insurgent livery

You can not play T-Hunt offline. But if you get disconnected from the rainbow six servers while in a solo T-Hunt, you can continue playing.
---
You were the first person to mention a sequel
---
Did you record it? I kinda wanna see how it is to play 30 rounds of a game lmao
---
But what color is the boathouse?
---
1 v 5 is also fun. Its tense fun even if you dont win and I refuse to quit match because Im scared of a time ban.
---
It‚Äôs out because it‚Äôs not even a PvP map so it‚Äôs bad
---
Getting hit in the arm or leg only deals like 90 damage. A torso shot is a one hit down, and a headshot is a kill of course.
---
yeah, and they put yacht ........
---
Bartlett got a special kind of removed.  I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll add it back until they rework it.
---
There‚Äôs a clash glitch?
---
I miss old Hereford ;-;
---
No, the game need a building and rooms for the defenders. This won‚Äôt work for siege.
---
Also TDM would be pretty boring in siege.
---
how to solve this in one simple step:
---
1. Move your cursor a bit further down and click "Unranked"
---
Wow! Never backfill again! Ubi hates him!
---
You get banned for abusing glitches so gl buddy :)
---
We die
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs a trash tactic
---
damn thats pretty nice
---
Top 10 anime plot twists.
---
I domt have glash
---
But it at least provides the option. Many people won‚Äôt use it because you can yield a greater RoF by keeping it semi auto...however for some people who don‚Äôt have a good trigger finger, this is a way to make them more viable and consistent. 
---
Would help console out as well, whereby DMR‚Äôs are harder to use due to the lesser accuracy overall. 
---
Again, it doesn‚Äôt negatively impact anything so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad change. I agree though that it won‚Äôt have any serious application at higher levels and rightly so
---
Someone is gonna tell him about the Halloween event?
---
I guess I just wouldn‚Äôt mind the option. Ultimately it doesn‚Äôt negatively effect the game and has a few benefits, making them more viable overall. Not by much and maybe not to everyone, but it certainly makes them more accessible for more players
---
Hearing TWANG while roaming would be terrifying lol

the red dot's view issue got fixed a long time ago. I see tons of people use it now, but there are still a bunch of people who still think that it's the old busted and keep telling new players not to use it.

It really just boils down to them not wanting to give the players anything but absolute bare minimum in hopes that people would spend more on MTX.

Haha my guyüòÇ

Uhhh no I see almsot no one picking red dot in ranked

Contact support
---
Duh you cant. Im trying to get directions to a video config file where I can change things without getting auto banned.
---
&gt;  Majority of the siege community who might be around Silver or Gold want it removed.  
---
I'm not sure where you got this from. I doubt most Silvers even know that Zofia can withstand. The only defense  I need for Zofia's ability to withstand is simply that's how she was made and it seems that you're more concerned with her gadget then a quirky ability that is ever so rarely used and even if out of 200 games that 1 time it had influence on a match, that doesn't strike me as an issue after 2 years of the operator being in the game. Also, that video of Zofia withstand against G2 when diffuser was planted in garage breach and 2 full HP ops where outside holding cross angles against a lit Alibi.
---
Anyways, we aren't changing each others minds here.
---
Interesting. Verified?
---
It reminds me when I played 1v1 custom with a friend with a rule to play all rounds with different operators, some form of after pick ban phase. It is really fun especially in the end when almost everything is already picked.

I started right at the release but put it down for a while when my daughter was born. Imagine my surprise when I came back a few months back and there were 60 operators to learn.
---
The point of a shooting range in games is to practice your aim with a 0% chance of being hit, so that you don't have to worry about it that and can just peacefully practice your aim with the ability to quickly switch between weapons and ops.
---
Nope sorry u cant turn off the blood. Maybe if you play on PC, you can go with Low Settings in order to hide the blood, but 99% it wont work
---
I appreciate your flair.
---
Apparently there's an fps glitch (like the castle one we had some seasons ago) that makes them drop and sees Mozzie involved in it. I know nothing about it, I only heard about this. It happened to me a few times on Villa in the same spot and I thought it was a map glitch, but then I heard it is a Mozzie glitch. Idk, it only happened to me in the same spot on Villa but there was a Mozzie on the other team..
---
If you change stuff in the config file, for which I say good luck in finding, you **will** get banned.
---
Thanks

Every day we drift farther from Tom's light. (I read those as miles to Rainbow 6)

He‚Äôs sooooo good now. I agree that I wouldn‚Äôt nerf him yet. Watch and assess data and decide from there.

But if they want to nerf him, I don‚Äôt want them purging him back to useless, which he quite frankly was before. Nerf other aspects to reduce his impact but in more subtle ways

It will not. As of now there are more male than female operators in the game, adding 2 more males will only strengthen it.

For some reason they also are keeping the trend of adding female attackers and male defenders for 5 seasons in a row.

I remember doing the math for the most points you could get in a THunt kill, but now that bombers are gone, the math is super different.
---
headshot a bomber with bucks shotgun while you are rappelled, conced by zofia, flashed, and through a barricade while the bomber is also conced and flashed and hes jumping out of a barricade. I don't think I'm missing anything on that, but I could be, and it should total over 180 points.
---
You have the option as he‚Äôs driving away

You haven't to make sure the settings are saving and that they are not macro or on the hyper setting. Or whatever it's called. I had this issue and it took me a while to figure it out. It's the software of the mouse Logitech is shit. I soon after this switched over to razor.

Logitechs drivers gets gitty over any minor changes.
---
Make sure your language on windows is english

Check if game detection is correct (if you have a specific profile for siege, make sure siege is actually selected)

Close Logitechs driver software using taskmanger fully. The relaunch see if that works

Idk if you tried redownloading drivers completely, that sometimes works for me.

I figured, not enough foresight or forethought coming from your brain to understand why the changes are good, only worried about what you like.

For ranked the large majority of the playerbase is completely fine with a restricted map pool. In fact most players I talk to still want an even smaller map pool, mainly because of Chalet. 
---
While this particular rotation of quick play maps is odd the rotation itself is not at issue. They probably should just leave ranked maps and fan favorites on always.

Your bitching about anti-toxicity changes is irrrelevant and talking about self-reliance in a team based game is suspect. 
---
Ubi has left maps for casual that is why that they have not bothered to rework tower, favela, house, plane, and other less competitively viable maps. Ubi only works on maps they believe can actually be successfully reworked like theme park and Kanal, hereford was mistake but also their first full fledged attempt at it.
---
Same story for me. After playing a bunch and watching some videos, siege has become one of the games I play the most now.

You can find them on amazon

He shaved it off i think
---
MY LOOOOOOOORD!!!
---
I am sorry , lad . But YOU ARE LATE
---
I thought they fixed that
---
And the most mind numbing map on top of that to play repeatedly lol it‚Äôs so small!

The way you draw vigil always has me laughing harder than I should
---
As far as gameplay is concerned yeah they've done but quality of life and reporting wise I don't see any concern... Maybe I'm wrong
---
People who dont use bandit irons are actual apes
---
Good vs Evil
---
no it's pretty bad, and intentionally so. kali is a pretty decent op tho.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten anything good in months opening these legendaries
---
You took it out of the box and now its worthless
---
Holo gang
---
I call it the TF2 equation, the longer the game lives, the more likely you get bunny ear hats and pink outfits
---
I think it looks like shit lol, holo is my go to for the aesthetics
---
who tf says nomad is bad
---
I haven‚Äôt had a chance to play it yet. Can‚Äôt wait for finals to be over so I can dive
---
Those triceps still blows my mind
---
Well, even on PC, reporting doesn‚Äôt work. Quality of life is kinda a toss up, what do you mean by Quality of life personally.
---
Hmm, I can only imagine a R6 x Band-Aid collab where they sell Band-Aids with R6 designs on them and in they have a special event (kinda like the Money heist one) where they have a standard game mode set up with the only difference being every time you revive a downed player, a small bandaid is put on the model
---
I like house because I don't try hard to WIN as much as I try to be creative. It's kind of a blank canvas. Make stupid configurations and try to take the enemy team by surprise.
---
She is beautiful, the 1 shot down is amazing

Well done keep it up. Champion Rank is next

The only reason every single skin isn't universal is to make more money off the playerbase. Change my mind.

Well it may seem like takchnka has died but in reality he has just fed on the arrow

Kali vs Gridlock
---
Eh who cares just keep on playing anyway you hit a season high. Won‚Äôt get anywhere if you don‚Äôt keep playing
---
I want someone to see your comment without context
---
Its a shame we can't buy these...
---
It wasn't so goddam complex at the beginning for me, the controls of them character, of their drones, and learning the maps was difficult, but that's in my opinion why it is so fun
---
What am I looking at here
---
Name checks out...
---
Thats some good dedication bro

I am kerchoo

yet it gets reposted every time in this sub

I use the red dot when I'm roaming or rushing because im not looking to PixPeek, im looking to move fast and land a lot of center

mass/close range headshots. 
---
If I'm not ding that, holo and reflex see equal use. Im dog shit with ACOGs so most of the time I dont use them. That, and I always subconsciously stay back when I have too much magnification so to stop myself from doing that I use the close range optics.
---
Changes the meaning of: "Big fucking hole coming right up..."
---
&gt;Montagne is already the underdog in 1v1

bro what are you smoking? one of the reasons monty is so strong is because you have to actively try to lose 1v1s with him

I don't see it, Gridlock looks more like Pierce Brosnan than Kali
---
I don‚Äôt see anything wrong it‚Äôs perfect

When they get around to adding Oliver Queen
---
Lol
---
Lmao like I blocked them to hurt their feelings.
---
Actually . 4 matches cause there are 4 pictures
---
Gotten this before and trust me it‚Äôs 10x funnier when they have an acog
---
Didnt say you did
---
I find that I end up playing Favela too much and not enough of anything else, not to mention that Coastline is too frequent in Ranked
---
Hacker! I‚Äôm reporting this to ubi immediately you scum! /s.
---
yes the ‚ÄúbAlAnCiNg IsSuEs‚Äù are why they make most changes in this game. The sights each have their perks and disadvantages. This sight would literally be used 100% of the time.
---
Was it a custom game?
---
The Japanese line didn‚Äôt change it because it‚Äôs not grammatically incorrect, it‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúThe dragon consumes my enemies‚Äù vs ‚ÄúDragon! Eat my enemies‚Äù. Both are grammatically correct and carry different meanings (ones a statement the others a command)
---
It honestly wouldn't surprise me at all. Then why be Alpha packs in the free battle pass and you'll also be able to buy them with Renown or money but I wouldn't be surprised at all if the percentage rate of match thing goes away. One thing Ubisoft has proven is that they will do anything they possibly can to squeeze every single penny out of the players, and battle passes by chance is just too generous in the keep doing. I'm just waiting for them to add a monthly fee LOL:p
---
Yes but it has to be unanimous. Intended to prevent griefing but typically used by people who expect you to be pro and want you cut if you dont clutch an ace
---
She‚Äôs not
---
I think the actual dot is too big too otherwise I‚Äôd use it more.
---
Are you actually #2 Chank jesus
---
I mean trying making playing on console feel better Idk how to explain it ( graphical settings maybe try to boost fps...  Leaning from the hip etc..)
---
Noice  
---
That doc's gotta count for two
---
Less windows, more doors, smaller hallways, library needs to be redone, as well as study. Outside needs more cover to get closer to the building
---
They should just stop being goofy and implement more site customization options.
---
Like Russians having unique sights is what they should have done to add more variety to ‚Äúnew weapons‚Äù instead of recycling old ones.
---
Here is an upvote for condolences my dude. Damn. That's rough. Reddit shows no mercy. Lol.
---
The AA-DD style causes more quitters and in my case, probably not others, quick play has been some of the least fun I‚Äôve ever had on this game.
---
Maybe inactivity? Idk.
---
Thinking about it, I don't think I've ever not killed someone with it in a round either... save maybe a couple times where I got prefired through a barricade on a window at the start or something lucky like that.
---
Kinda reminds me of the snow cone yetti from monsters inc lol
---
Well i don't think people eating meat balls would make effective operators
---
Or a little ass kid
---
Yeah. My buddies hate it, but secretly I think they're just jealous üòÇ
---
Why did it get deleted?
---
Make a follow up comic, where the arrow is stuck in the visor and chanka flexes to not only rip away his clothing, but the arrow darts right back out the helmet going towards her.
---
Shes really quite nice people Sometimes Just dont know how to Play her
---
Well that looks painful. But it also doesn't tell me a whole lot of the story. What seems to get you so many losses? If you recognize it anyway?
---
Isn‚Äôt master of trophies a trophy, making it impossible to achieve?

They're almost as annoying

Gave the gift of gun. Keeper of peace and object of fun.
---
I have Rarely had what could ostensibly be labelled a 'fun' casual match. I either get tk'd or have such shitty teammates/high skill opponents that playing becomes pointless. 
---
I prefer unranked because, I can't get ranked despite knowing full well my ass won't get out of bronze, never have despite playing pretty well imo. I have low self esteem but i can say with a little pride that I'm 'good' at siege. Unranked feels aight because it's mainly people too afraid for ranked or are dudes probably trying to savor their precious silver, I have had plenny a fun matches on That moreso than casual. Ranked is just a shitshow, tk'ing galore or idlers/griefers.
---
I haven't even played THunt with other players because goodlord is That probably an abyssmal shitshow.
---
Grind and if that doesn‚Äôt work hacks
---
I broke one of these irl

You get em

I want him to be the first def with smoke grenades. I think that shit would be **MINT**

Fuck that. Give red dot an acog. #reddotacog

I own the season pass

I would like unranked except that it seems people try harder in that because they‚Äôre ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù

Usually my teammates just start killing me just because I shot at them once, like what the hell is that?
---
Unlike now when holo is used 99% of the time?
---
I just got it recently too, noticed they removed the terrorist hunt trophies (thank god).
---
Wasted a lot of time trying to get those, though.
---
It isn‚Äôt though
---
Why did you shoot at them lol? I laugh because honestly in my early days I probably would have TKd you too if you shot me. You can see teammates through walls. Sure, accidents happen, but most of the time that happens it's the person shooting's fault.
---
No they changed that like a year ago
---
Yikes can i change it?
---
I made an alt and I made it to number one in the world! I will be at the pro league invitational! Thank you so much!

Oh yeah i know this

Cuuute

Idk who got it but have fun with that!

Im still waiting for new guns

Think about what  your doing wrong, like why you got killed, then think about what you could have done different
---
But new black ice would also be nice ;)

How to you get who you main beside your name?

What the fuck? Are the roles reversed or something?

Awesome, good job üëçüèª

Skyscraper isn't in ranked. What's wrong with Oregon? I think it's my favourite map
---
N√∏kk?
---
Ranked is when siege is at its best. So what if you go on a losing streak? It happens. Play ranked and enjoy the best siege experience and don‚Äôt worry too much about your rank. It doesn‚Äôt show how good YOU are, just how good your teammates have been. I ranked in plat 3 and now I‚Äôm gold 1 but il still play because I enjoy ranked the most

Ngl i get why some of you see it as bragging, i just said oh i got an ace, I‚Äôm kinda used to ranked where people go oh cool u got an ace. Rly its more about how people responded to it to me, instead of getting on with their lives or going oh congrats they decide to tk me
---
Happened to me while I was trying to queue with a friend. Gave me an abandon sanction later even though we never played
---
Thank you!

Got triggered ü§£

Not up to Fallout Standards huh?

√Äh okay, started playing a few weeks ago and think they look really cool. Guess I'll grab em whenever I can for the ops I like, and rock white camo till then.
---
What about mute tho
---
No he killed himself and his team mate watch the feed properly.
---
Sucks u didn‚Äôt get it on deagle
---
New game mode. Escape the building.
---
Wait, you had it recorded on pc, but uploaded it on your phone instead of just uploading the original file to reddit?
---
About time they replace it with a Bulletproof camera or something
---
it's not finished yet based on one of their recent tweets
---
Looks awesome!

Yeah and they have overwatch snipers and will rapell onto a roof to a avoid window sightlines.

That would be good. I often use reflex since it's rather small and doesn't get in the way as much like holo. Aug A2 with a holo is a nightmare when compared to Aug with reflex.
---
Did you read the post
---
Oh dam i dumm
---
I had a temporary down in my internet, spiked from the usual 20~ ping to over 2000, I was kicked, and then I tried to reconnect after some McGyver-ing, I reconnected to the match, and lagged out bc I hadn't connected fast enough. I got penalized.
