have you ever considered making it the most recent rank you achieved to keep people from deranking after hitting plat or diamond. i personally do this after hitting platinum for a more fun experience but it does take the competitiveness out of it
---
This is probably the easiest way. After the patch you can just plant next to a soft wall and put the charge on the other side.
---
Amazing Job!
---
Why would you vote kick a fragger? 
---
I did not know this was normal, sorry
---
i mean, they are making a whole new model juse for the deployable barricade so why not? 
---
Does that ash not hear that diffusing? 
---
? I got vote kick against me because I took ash. 
---
I’ve figured it out guys it’s her teeth. Her teeth are her hit box you just have to wait till she opens her mouth
---
I'm guessing you're talking about casual there, and I have to personally disagree.
---
Not only is casual stake-less, (as in, no one is risking their ELO/ranking during a casual match) but we also have a "join-in-progress" system to fill holes in a casual team. 
---
I understand the frustration with having to play at a disadvantage, but I don't think that forcing a player to stay in a casual match by threat of punishments is the way to go — why would you want a player who has already completely given up on the match to be forced to stay when you could get a new player who probably actually wants to *play the match.* 
---
Forcing players to stay just seems like an invitation/catalyst for toxicity to bubble up.  
---
 
---
Like talking about the other people. Like why would anyone do that 
---
Glad I'm not alone! Just started the last week of February. 
---
I don't think I'll ever unlock them all, after ~20 hours of play I have around 14,000 renown. I wish I could test all of them out before purchase as to know whichis a better fit for my playstyle. 
---
yea change your location to wakanda on your ps4 and you can update in an hour
---
If I reacted quickly enough, otherwise I’d have died like the guy in the video
---
Was going back through some of old R6 clips from a year or so ago, when I stumbled upon this gem. Basically, my team (rightfully so) thought the round was lost as there were .3 people alive, including 2 shields - one of which was a Montagne blocking the only entrance to obj - but a nice little cheese came in clutch to help us win the round. Enjoy!
---
That is so cool 
---
I wanna know why people leave when they WIN a round
---
Would pay 
---
I'm not sure if they've thought about changing that system. 
---
I get your point, but I also think it's good that the system recognizes your best, rather than your last, placement. It lets you feel pride in the highest point you were able to climb to, rather than where you ended up at the very end of the season. 
---
I’ll change it to your sisters ass 
---
so they dont need to try to wreck kids
---
😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 
---
I was just about to comment
---
Also... 
---
First: Reducing hp from 50 to 20 is gonna nerf rook since now  the effect of being downed and pick up while wearing armor is going to have less impact in the round, which is good since he is really strong according to the delta/win. Also is going to make sure Doc is going to use his stim pistol more carefully since picking up and applying a shot is not gonna be a thing anymore.
---
Second: Ubi said they change the animation in order to implement more game mechanics in the future. 
---
Same
---
It's much harder for a troll to walk infront of somebody deliberately, causing a team kill than it is for the troll to just kill them themselves as they do right now. And even if they do, the first kick could not incur a temporary ban from searching for a game due to this reason. Bans would be handed out for repeated offenses.
---
I feel I may be wording my point poorly.
---
Currently a troll will avoid being punished by not committing another team kill and possibly having a buddy in the match with him to avoid vote kick. This allows him to teamkill somebody once continue playing match as if nothing happened.
---
When you add damage reflection, a troll will be sanctioned immediately but that sanction does not change anything about how they behave because as far as they are concerned, they are still free to kill somebody before something happens to them.
---
Because functionally speaking, the game could: 
---
- Kick a team killer if he shoots another teammate
---
- instantly ban hin for a week if he shoots another player 
---
- crash his game for a year if he shoots another player
---
- blow up his PC or Console if he shoots another player
---
The severity of consequences put in place after they continue to hurt other players when they have already teamkilled is irrelevant because all they have to do is not shoot another player for the rest of the match.
---
So long as nothing actively discourages or prevents them from teamkilling a player in the first place then teamkill trolls are "free" to teamkill at least one player per match. 
---
If you do not want to institute Halo's "press X to boot" system (which is the only to target smurf accounts created to bypass an account ban because it allows for proactive counter toxicity) 
---
You ought to implement a blanket ban for any player who incurs two or three team kills twice within 6, 12 or 24 hours (whatever fits best) across all playlists.
---
This would at least limit how many teamkills a player who goes out of their way to teamkill troll every match can perform regularly. It doesn't solve impromptu teamkilling like when don't get to pick an operator they want but it would have an effect on compulsive team killers.
---
Really want a pro league set. Just not a fan of the 4 operators available rn. 
---
Looks so good. 
---
I’m glad I got the only thing I cared about from the packs: Road to SI weapon skin!!!
---
Their heights are essentially just flavour text in their bios, for balance purposes they're all the same height in game. Ying is about Mozzie's height while Sledge is about a foot taller than either but they're the same height once you're actually playing a game.
---
Or if something happens and they get a ban. 
---
That's how it used to be but that just meant people abandoned rank entirely after getting what they felt was their highest rank.
---
Leaked
---
Hmmm. You’d swear that it might be because it’s cheap to have MnK on console. Nah. That’s not it. Devs totally intended for people to be able to use a device that’s well known to be much better for aiming, and is easy to pick up on. 
---
Stupid. How is that fun???
---
Ya
---
Because people don't want to ruin their stats
---
Ok cool
---
You’re right. Let the chaos ensue. 
---
It was because I had dust on the keycap and the press wasn’t registering. I cleaned that specific key underneath and melee now works as intended 
---
I guess. I expected us to lose badly.
---
I *knew* there would be a typo somewhere... Thanks, I'll fix it in the next update! 
---
the question ive been asking for 2 years
---
Tactically put played 
---
It’s better than controller
---
\^ nah but i got like one hundred commons and uncommons in a row so i think its good karma
---
It was because of dust underneath the keycap not allowing me to press. Works as intended now
---
Ubisoft tweeted it was having issues earlier with purchases, I'm sure it'll be fixed in a day or two
---
it was an epic (black ice) but i basically consider that legendary
---
It's been around for a long time now but near the beginning the charm you got was based on your current rank rather than your highest achieved rank.
---
I believe it was changed before the first year was done as lots of people left rank after getting the highest rank they felt they could get.
---
I did as well was so happy. First time ever for me 
---
I never said he was...
---
Shame you didn't listen to the part in the presentation where they said this was 1 of many ideas they were going to test and nothing was set in stone.
---
I did.
---
But what's the point when it clearly doesn't resolve anything? It's a waste of their time.
---
Is this patch gonna make Ubisoft win the largest game patch size for PC FPS games or even for PC games?
---
Here's a comparison between this skin and one you can buy for cheap right off of the skins screen.  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/aEaJcfP](https://imgur.com/a/aEaJcfP)  
---
(Obviously I think that the leder skin is LEAGUES better. Maybe I do just have bad taste)  
---
Because hostage is shit.
---
Why not praise them? Ditch the circlejerk. I haven't even played the game that much but it is polished. Give credit where credit is due
---
When they were first reduced I spent 50k on year one ops the day before they released. I just spent another 30k on frost and buck and you're telling me they're 10k now. I want to commit ash hitbox.
---
The shield desync was a large focus of the TTS and is mentioned in both the patch notes and addendum patch notes. Ubi has been pretty vocal about their efforts to fix the issue.
---
Daaamn they did you dirty 
---
Only coppers and memers play hostage and secure area. Bomb is the best game mode for a reason 
---
You’re correct my bad
---
No but that’s a very happy coincidence 
---
it's not awful. But I'd take Leder or Short Circuit over it any day
---
It needs more stuff to really carry any attention but its a neat idea and I hope people run with it.
---
You should only ever focus on unlocking the newest Ops first, since they are almost always released in an OP state to incite people to buy the Season Pass. 
---
Hey no worries my man, i was just sure I had seen it in there, and wanted to be sure i wasnt thinking of something else lul
---
When the fuck will they fix this shit? Tired of being nice about it, frankly...
---
Probably by far the least balanced gamemode. I have all gamemodes enabled and hostage comes up maybe 1 in 50. Seems like many have turned it off.
---
Because maybe it is a step that was easy for them to implement and get some feedback using while also reducing TKing on some level. The other solutions they have in progress might take more work and they want something in the mean time.
---
I'd let him cluster my charge, no homo
---
Cute animation lol
---
There's plenty of hostage in casual PS4. 
---
I personally dont think that it deserves to be a legendary skin. That's the main reason I'm salty about it. Would've been fine with it if it was an epic or a rare.
---
For me it's the most boring mode. You don't need to fight. Just yoink the hostage and run away.
---
At the end of the day it's a multiplayer game and everyone has a right to play it how they want so you can't really force people to not sweat in casual or make smurfs etc. The ones who are actually good and have some pride don't do it and the ones that do probably have little peenie syndrome so they have to get an ego boost by beating lower ranks. Just use it as an opportunity to play against some higher level talent and improve yourself cause eventfully the ultimate goal for MOST gamers is to have fun through improving and challenge..right? ...RIGHT??
---
The matchmaking system is already shit so you're already bound to play against people way better than you anyways. Besides you'll only play against them once probably so it's not that bad. Also to get better half the time you have to play against better players. Final point is that it's just a game, just take the L and move on
---
Well idk about that because i have this pic as my wallpaper on WhatsApp way before the six invitional 
---
its better with shock wire

---
Russia **STOOPID THICC.**
---
We’ve come a long way boys
---
&gt;Because maybe it is a step that was easy for them to implement and get some feedback using while also reducing TKing on some level.
---
But it doesn't do that. I explained specifically why it will not do that.
---
&gt;The other solutions they have in progress might take more work and they want something in the mean time.
---
Or they could just focus on making better solutions that would have an actual effect.
---
^ he gets it
---
Casual has its own ranked system that is hidden from you
---
Casual and ranked have different mmr systems. Just ranked shows theirs, while casual doesn’t.
---
I have all OP Dog tags that theyve released, considering we dont have Lion, Finka, Maestro, Maverick, Clash, Kaid, Nomad, they might not do anything for this year
---
I’ve gotten vote-kicked for not telling a joke in the first 10 seconds I was loading in - literally
---
lmao, i can promise you would've caught a tk the next round if that happened to me 
---
Great! This is exactly the needed platform for anyone who is actively on Siege. Definitely joined and added to my favourites on Chrome.
---
Yeah a little bit but still really neat background
---
Casual used to have no matchmaking, and bumping into a good player was extremely rare. But reddit complained about that rare occasion, so we got hidden matchmaking that is similar to ranked. So now if you win a few matches you will find those high golds/plats/diamonds. 
---
The issue there is currently that his guns are in damage ranges where a slight buff would not change the ttk at all. Both guns are more or less dmrs. The MK17 being an AR-DMR mix with comparably slow auto fire rate and good damage (there has been a buff recently btw) and the other being a true dmr with comparably high damage (almost 10 more than dokkis m14)The damage falloff could be altered to account his weapons being long range weapons tho.

No, I really don't play much Cav. But if losing those two bullets is that impactful then good, sounds like an unnecessary crutch.

10/10 would fuze

Nothing villainous here, you educated them, maverick exists and is a threat to be reckoned with on favela.
---
the real question is why do people play hostage? lol
---
No cause the game is bigger than 54GB 
---
Lol
---
Do people actually care about their stats in this game? It doesn't even show up in ranked anyways. Many pros are around 1 k/d , all depends on the competition you play against. Easy to maintain above a 2 playing bronze and silvers lol
---
rip glaz, rest in peace man
---
You make a good point 
---
Currently when you TK the second time you are auto kicked from the game and no more data is gathered, I actually think this idea was designed to get feedback from the second kill (which is now self damage) and see how games play out when someone cant use TK's to auto fuck games even more by not only killing another person a second time but auto removing themselves from the game. You are looking at this solution as a fix to the first TK and I think it was designed to measure behaviour when you can't use the second TK to fuck 2 people.
---

Thanks a lot good sir! Really appreciate the position e feedback! Hope to meet and exceed your expectations.

Smurfing is not against the terms of service of the game. Reporting smurf accounts Will not get them banned.
---
Hostage is so one sided for attackers, seriously, all it takes to win hostage is blitz, finka, thatcher and either a lot of smokes or ying. We have destroyed for about 10 full matches and never once lost attack. It was fun, but we can’t do that too often, people will drop their elo if they play hostage or secure for too long.
---
Unlocked near all y1 dlc except bb and just unlock all GEO op well
---
That was clean 
---
oof
---
don't worry ash will get her acog back after 40 days lol jk
---
God I wish that was me
---
How is losing around 13% of your ammo an unnecessary crutch? Firefights arent always clean and when people start running to back up their friend you dont really have time to walk away while reloading. losing those 2 bullets was huge.
---
I've never heard that one, do you know of any other maps.

It's only 20 seconds into the round. I can sit in the middle of the hallway...

I specify pistol. The bonus to choosing a pistol should be speed and accuracy where as an SMG sidearm bonus is more overall firepower. Going from primary to pistol should always be faster than any reload, unless the primary is special.

In my book Smurf’s are there for one purpose (for non streamers) and that is playing ranked outside of the regular team, so you don’t drop your rank because of shitty bad random teammmates. Streamers use them to avoid stream snipers often. People who use them to “club baby seals” are bad and have to create new accounts fairly often, as a smurf will find no more newborns after about 10 to 20 games of pure winning. Also don’t forget all the other smurfs. I got rekt with my smurf in the first 2 games because I got several 3-5 stacks of smurfs.
---

Honestly I would have liked to see her gadget require perfectly timed button presses, kinda like an alpha pack spinner. Where you gotta nail 3 in a row to get the call to last the full duration or something like that. It would take more risk and skill possibly.

There’s a piece of the garden with a barbed wire fence, you can’t vault it and it can’t be crossed, so yes, that is outside the map.

I suppose your friend didn’t launch the game before they changed the edition, right?
---
If so then he can unlock each operators for 500-2000 renowns. 
---
One of my friends had purchased the game during that period, &amp; didn’t launch the game until recently. Now he has to unlock all base operators for 500-2000 renowns.
---
Another friend who had played for some time didn’t have few base year operators, got those operators after they changed the edition.

wtf are you even talking about. did you even read what i said dumbass

This was my immediate thought. Possibly the most wholesome thing I've ever seen come from the R6 community.

no, unfortunately not :(

I liked this. Thats why i said good. So yeah, i really like this one.
---
Hey man, you said you got the skin right? Just bought the pass and all I'm seeing is the charm. No biggie, just wondering 
---
Not only that but a 5 second animation? So they get shot the attacking team knows where that defender is for 10 seconds and anyone around that defender for 10 seconds just to stand still for 5 seconds to take a cam out. It really is too strong in a time sensitive game, this is just lion for one person that lasts 15+ seconds

Your right that might be too long, earlier someone suggested 7 second wait and 3 second animation

Most mods in most subreddits are either toxic/bias or just don’t do anything in general. That’s why the “ mods are gay “ memes are popular

To be THAT know it all, the fmg9 primary is just a Glock in a fancy folding stock

I mean there are good console players out there look at ImJustTooGuud

Yeah. Over that. Was just telling you that it's for good reason is all.

No.
---
It eould have to be unused.

Honestly, he could replace no utility ash
---
Yeah, but read the conversation.  That mod basically just evades his question entirely, and answers it by copy+pasting a rule over and over again.  That's pretty douchey, especially since, if you read the entire conversation, the mod is clearly in the wrong here.

Hello Creeks01, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/axuav8/hostage_bug_that_must_me_fixed/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Ash's hitbox is about the size of a thumb, so you got that right

From one know it all to another, the P226 Mk25 is mislabeled. That’s the SEAL designation, SAS would use an L105A2?
---
Lion, the new Fuze
---
I loath having a team that does so little that I can drop 10-14 kills and still lose, like my teammates most have to do genuinely nothing
---
Like i said, most mods are toxic lol. So when they get proven wrong they get upset and ban the person who proves them wrong. It’s unfair but that’s how reddit works. 
---
How long between seasons usually?
---
Im still new to the game
---
*THUNK THUNK THUNK*
---
pretty sure that was through a wall... and Ash
---
I would like to know which mod it was tho
---
Yeah.  But you read that conversation, right?  He basically just stopped the mod dead in his tracks and the mod had no counterargument available.
---
If u didnt know the laser tightens the spread of the shotgun giving it more range.
---
He is much worse imo. I mained him before, and he was slow, but with patience and mind-games I got up to 91% win-rate in duels iirc. They took away the things that made him at least sometimes ok, nerfed his damage all around (even though he's supposed to be a heavy hitter), got rid of the only good guaranteed punishes (headbutt for stamina damage isn't guaranteed off of anything, can't punish splats with demons embrace and it wouldn't be worth doing anyways) and made sure that embrace is super easy to react to and has a massive whiff animation so you're basically fucked if for some reason you try it.
---
It's like they wanted to change what he was supposed to be (a slow, heavy-hitter), but forgot to make him into something else. He's just faster at being boring. 
---
A bit of both.
---
I had that happen twice and both times i got black ice
---
Idk.  I don't like how it hides the moderators' usernames.  It basically allows them to be complete douchebags like the one in this conversation with no consequences because their username's hidden.
---
...and a gun.

Which is faster:

Shopping Cart Tachanka or

---
The fact people don't have a problem with this is the problem. Sadly there is no way to hold people accountable in this game I've been playing since beta I've only seen the community get worse and worse. It pains me to see this game I love be this toxic everybody thinks they're pro tier players but honestly they are misleading themselves so they feel like they have a right to talk down to people.

At least the Y0 operators are cheaper.

Time to give the other boi  ( G36C ) some love guys

Shouldn't mozzie's size compensate a bit an make it a smaller download though?

Ubisoft needs to add more passive abilities and operators that have somewhat of a past relationship 
---
They should make him throw shopping carts at operators

THAT USED TO BE MY PROFILE PIC. I was named HoboTachanka.

Was playing with these guys earlier as well. I didn't see that happen though.

My team has a rule that if someone reinforces next to you, you can gun them down like a degenerate. Tis’ a good rule. 
---
mmmm, LMG's...

I have 65k renoun saved up right now. I wanna try and hit 75k before the ops are released for non season pass holders next week.

Ah yes, the uncountered counter. Fantastic.

You press your xbox button and then Y. It's as easy as it gets.

It happened also with Para Bellum, it came out on Finka’s birthday
---
Fair enough, I'd still of thought abit of reverse engineering from Sony and Microsoft could put a stop to it or they could threaten legal action on the manufacturers of said device. I dunno going off top of my head here. Just seems weird to me that Razer would go through all the loopholes to become a supported partner to Microsoft if there is no benefit outside of marketing.
---
Depends on what you mean by "modded" controllers. If you mean one with buttons on the bottom that simply give you easier access, no that isn't an issue as the same advantage can mostly be gained by using the accessibility settings on either console and moving buttons around. Or even a claw grip style on a default controller. 
---
The argument against mkb isn't just that it gives you a slight advantage (which modded controllers do, they make it so you don't have to move your finger of the right stick as often) it's that you're no longer limited by aiming with a joystick. The main argument against mouse and keyboard isn't the keyboard part, which gives you the same advantages a modded controller does, buttons are easier. It's the mouse, instead of aiming with your thumb on a very small space you are now aiming with your hand in a very large space. 
---
These "modded" controllers aren't the issue imo, they give you a slightly preferential button lay out. There are unlicensed modded controllers which also allow no recoil scripts, those are just as scummy as mkb as a large part of the advantage of a mouse is the superior recoil control, whilst recoil control is quite difficult on console. 
---
Tl:Dr modded controller slightly changes how someone plays whilst keyboard and **mouse** is a completely different input, not meant for console play.

---
Breaking news: Plat Smurf isn't bragging about skill at all, only showing off "fastest ace" of his life.
---
The problem is that the extra buttons interfere with how you grip the controller and therefore whenever you hit one of the paddles you inadvertently move a stick or hit another button. And plus the main advantage of mouse and keyboard is the aim, you can crouch spam easily with the default button config.
---
Ok so I have some questions I guess pretty much every PC player is having right now-
---
1. If I update the game(54gb) what will be the total size of the game after installation?
---
2. Will updating the game remove the obsolete and unnecessary files to reduce the total size of the game cause that's what some people are saying. And if 'Yes', what will be the total size?. Can someone surely confirm?
---
3.  So what should I do? Do I update the existing game or should I uninstall it and then install it freshly? I am short on Storage.
---
Well, he is a jew...
---
Doc should charge for healing his teammates otherwise ben Shapiro's wife will be a slave of communism
---
You do you obviously but I don't like politics when I'm just trying to check up on my Siege. Get upset all you want, it's just not my thing.
---
I would say neither, just earn everything.

and here i am not getting a single legendary for the last 2 months
---
Im on pc so i dont know a lot about console tos. That said this is the first time i heard smurf accounts are against xbox tos. Cant you link the microsoft tos that says smurfing is against the tos. 
---
Marketing is a huge deal. Also native support is completely different from emulating a controller. Native support let's you button every action separately, whilst if one button does multiple actions on a controller an emulator can't assign multiple different buttons to those different actions. Native support is great. 
---
- reverse engineering: easier said than done. These adapters companies show the console controller input with an official signal. That's all the consoles see. They receive the signals of a joystick moving, of the default controller buttons being pressed. 
---
- sue to manufacturers: what are they liable for, they never signed the terms of service with Xbox or Microsoft so they aren't liable for breaking those, that's on the users only. 
---

Inappropriate or inappropes?

Am I being wooshed? Update isn't out yet
---
They're "fixing" it by giving a forgive or don't feature like back in halo 3. After a tk any damage they deal will be dealt back to them instead of others. So imo its like a bandaid fix. The true issue is people will play as a 3 or 4 stack and just find tking funny and its complete shit.

Oh my god IT IS A 50 GB download. It’s REPLACING CODE. The 50 GB would be replacing 70 GB or so of code. 
---
You asked: how much will it be after patch, I only got 20 GB left on SSD
---
I replied with a link that said your OVERALL GAME SIZE ON YOUR DEVICE WILL GET SMALLER
---
What part of this isn’t making sense to you?
---
Whilst I agree more options is better (I want to press and hold on Monty and Pulse for example, currently that's impossible no matter what setting you use), bandit is a perfect example of why to use toggle deployment. You hold the battery in you hand and press the activate button to place it once you hear Thermite/Hibana going down. 
---
chubby. you will never see someone capable of running a 9 minute 1.5 mile and knock out a 100 push ups and sit ups with that much fat on their body

Y’all made me get up from bed and turn on my fucking Xbox for nothing. Cunts. Got me excited for nothing 
---
I'm down for ranked tomorrow. I'll add you
---
I'm sorry, but I don't trust Ubisoft on this one.
---
Maybe try to change sensitivity, it helped me a lot.
---
Accept your fate. Welcome to copper.
---
Not necessarily shooting them out, but I always have to stare the fuck outta them like "I see you, I may be walking with my friends to  my class *but i know where all your friends are"*
---
I didnt make sense to me because of lack of sleep and that i foucsed that it said patch size and it didn't say replace
---
It very much is.
---
If somebody reinforces next to me then I'm just going to keep my second reinforcement in my pocket. I have things to do other than look for a second wall to reinforce.
---
But Microsoft and sony do have a officially licensed mouse and keyboard adapter. And it is cheaper than a Elite controller. If its available for everyone, why not use it? 
---
And my mouse broke on my promo yesterday in the middle of the game...
---
:(
---
Yup
---
Nah
---
Ill try that
---
Oh ok, sorry for getting frustrated. Hope I was able to help clear it up.

There are cameras all over my barracks in Korea and they look exactly like the ones in seige.

Yes I have a strong urge to shoot the cameras
---
Reinforcing next to somebody is frowned upon.
---
If you see somebody reinforcing and you can reasonable guess that they're going to reinforce the wall next to them after this then go find a different wall. Otherwise you're just wasting everybody's time.

Why is his helmet so small?

Its okay, it really did help to clear up and much thanks for dealing with my unhealthy sleep schedule and shitty english

All you gotta do is wait for them to light up red and rage at them.

Love the old logo wish they would use it more, I've only seen it in jager's solar flare headgear and its horrible, I dont like the colors on it, nice concept could be an special event like halloween, six invitational, summer, etc nice concept keep up the good work

Yeah i agree. The fact that data caps still exists in 2019 is just unfortunate.. especially in my country where they ask you to pay 147usd for the cheapest unlimited data package..
---
If you got it before the cav berf you get the ogs and attachments. On PS4 I was too late and I had to grind for a couple of hours to get the original 20
---
Seen one for shield penetrating to counter Monty etc 
---
Speaking of which, I wish I could find friends in the gold 2-plat 2 ranks on PC. I just want a team, all my friends are on console or play apex :(
---
I had to grind on a free weekend got them all and then bought the deluxe (or whatever has the year 1 pass) still fun dunking on people with fuze though
---
This is super clean! Great work Joey!
---
You will get it 4 years after it is due.
---
I see them at Work. Literally look exactly the same, even my mates and girlfriend have expressed wanting to shoot them out. 
---
You literally missed 90% of your bullets and no, you did not hit his head once.
---
It's not the hitreg's fault, it was your aim's
---
Play other games when you are on tilt- me personally I switch to rocket league or league of legends. Play t hunt. 
---
I don't even know if this measure is gonna be that effective against new players. Its know that you gotta put in lots of hours in order to master the basic of this game as the learning curve is quite steep. I think most people at 20-30 aren't there yet.
---
You can play at a high level with a regular controller it’s not game breaking 
---
U missed his head, and hit his shoulder/hand. Not ubis fault ur aim isn't on point
---
Wait... that’s so good for once.
---
Now you mention it, it *is* pretty fitting :)
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
I really wish the map was this big, so many more options for roaming and for flanking to the objective.
---
That is indeed big facts
---
With a name like that I would not be surprised if you were using an ESP overlay 
---
ok.... This really doesn't have anything to do with siege....
---
He is gonna be my main, as a 6.3 male, but that doesn’t matter xD
---
Again man, it's a grind. If you want teammates with mics, check out some lfg apps. You can usually find squads on their
---
How? Even with good aim, i can't carry my team every round. 
---
In casual i mostly win fights and such, in Ranked its kinda on and off. Some matches feel easy and i get a bunch of kills, others i get maybe 1 or 2 kills
---
Like the other said u need a team. Furthermore I think CS is giving you the basics skills for R6. U need to watch for spots where most people hide, use weapons u can control. Also ur play style, defense: if you are more on spot u should play the higher armored ops if you like to walk through the hole map take a fast op. The 2 speeds are the best for looking which type u are. Attack: take op of any speed or armor and look to take someone with a weapon of your choice the gadget isnt that important especially in casual. Hope that it will help u. If you have any question send me a pm here on reddit.

Or it might be because he wants to keep them beautiful, and the exothermic charges would cause him pain

Was thinking to try out a app i heard of on youtube, how much grind is normal for getting to Gold-Plat? Last season i was in a match where i got destroyed, but most of them had 1000-3000 hours
---
“EZ CLAP”
---
Yes please 
---
when you can't get to plat 3 with good aiming and game sense you are doing something wrong, i can't help you than probably
---
It would take more than 21h to download the update... I think it's time to visit a friend :D
---
Play supports like rook and thermite. As long as you stay alive to use thermite's ability, you'll help your team immensely. 
---
54 Gigabytes! You didn't want to leave them a chance, huh? They were downloading slowly, begging you for smaller updates, but you gave them big operations, AGAIN AND AGAIN!..
---
The grind from gold to plat is fucking long. Took me about a month of non stop play, and back then I had a kd of like 3.2. It's really really long. Gamer link is a good lfg app to try

Yes! Me too lol. It always makes me smile when I see them

He's gonna be my main too, due to his sick commando reload animation. Wow I'm short af compared to you 😅
---
It's so boring 
---
joined at 2-0 got my highest kill game ever with 12 kills new record for me i was so happy and i still won the alpha pack
---
Read the title you blind
---
This is the most fake shit ever or this is literally the rock bottom of siege.
---
A really big fucking hole, coming right up.
---
Thats actually fucking cool
---
I think I chose the name Zibal because it translated into the word Scavenger
---
Wears a shirt and a small bullet proof west, 3 armor. Okay...
---
Every gun is one shot headshot.... how is that an upside
---
Or Texas Dynamite
---
I'm not blind this just doesn't have to do with siege. This gun isn't in the game and has nothing to do with the game.
---
You were within the effective range of shotguns. These enemy’s don’t look to be trying very hard lol.
---
nibba is offensive, but this isnt
---
Please yes
---
Because she still has the acog advantage over most defenders. She's been OP for too long. Easier to get a headshot with an agoc so less worry about gun stats in general 
---
When you mix fuel, metal oxide and metal powder in just the right way, it burns at 2000 degrees Celsius. Hot enough to cut through nearly any barrier known to man. Throw some C4 into the mix, and you've got one hell of a combination.

ouch

Ok i will, 3.2 KD wtf tho, avg is like 0,8 in casual and bronze-copper...

terrible scale

K thx

Finally! Upvoted.

Diamond player. I've actually never been lower than silver but I've heard it's pretty bad
---
Sounds about right
---
For attack i have mostly been using Blackbeard, Hibana and Twitch
---
Defense its been Rook, Doc and Echo
---
*slightly legit*
---
In reality he probably 1v5ed u
---
So every attacker is overpowered? They all have ACOGs, so what's your point
---
Yeah that animation is naughty. Don’t worry, everyone is short af compared to me :)

Yeah I will not be able to play it today anyway, why not drop the patch yesterday...

The amount of autistic players who want to get the last kill in this game is truly remarkable!
---
That’s why you always hold right trigger, and that sledge lol
---
The Lord is 6'0" so he truly is looking down on you. 
---
I thought it was designed for tanks, not planes /s
---
Then just get into and let your mates tell u about the basics of the game. Most of your game knowledge will come while playing it's a lot of trial and error tbh and its important to watch the killcams because like that you'll learn quite a lot of spots and angles
---
Well, ironically he died from frag grenade when lying behind the bar after i've destroyed his gadgets with emp lol
---
So Seals, Brazilians and Japanese will be more expensive after the patch?

even worse

At my old house we only had 5mb available, in reality I never broke past 300kb and if anyone else was online (which was 99% of the time) I would get 200ish kb. Its rough.

Pre loading only works for games that are yet to be released or if the DLC comes as an expansion. Thid update is a direct upgrade to the game. If you updated the game before others it would cause problems. Craig (itsepi) explained on a podcast on Monday night how patches are pushed and it seems like a long winded yet difficult process.

Thank you for bringing this to those who didn't knew, i hope we get a response for what is now planned as they already said it would be done, I really hope Ubi Adress this and give us a Timeframe

Yo is this on ps4? If it is im pretty sure i was in this game. We let him win by us jumping off the roof. Not completely sure but the name sounds vaguely familiar. I was the twitch.
---
For example when you're roaming, it's really important that u know how to "use" sounds. For example: You hear enemy player moving somewhere, you immediately know the location/whereabouts by the sound.  Same thing works vice versa. 
---
It's also very important to learn the maps well. Know the callouts and therefore help your teammates by calling out the enemy locations. Here's a website what helps A LOT: [https://www.r6maps.com/](https://www.r6maps.com/)

Yeah it's still cool to know even the "leave us" sign is recreated from the real thing though

Tbf, it's great for roamers to hide down there, so many hiding spots and angles. You can really stall the attackers
---
Thanks!

Great pass!

if they allowed people to choose not to late join, we would never have late joins.

I feel that a lot of Doc’s that repeatedly stim themselves are just new players trying to be medic for the team. That’s what it’s been in my experience anyway.

---
You must not get out much. 
---
I mean i do have 800 hours playtime. May not be much for some Hardcore Gamers but level 220 is still a lot.
---
But seriously try and stick with the game. I tried getting 3 friends of mine to play the game. They all quit on me after 2 or 3 games. Not even sessions just Rounds. If you are not able to accept defeat or your death and get frustrated easy it will be hard to accomplish anything. 
---
Check my edit, I did put another link there which is really useful.

That maybe Lake Baikal.

Goddamn lake gets several feet of Ice during the winter.

It hugely depends on situation. I usually dont place mats in the prep phase. I got so many wins, just by killing the guy with the defuser and then place a mat inside their body or directly on the defuser, people dont expect that.

Oh my bad, good luck

Enable ping etc so we can see if the issue is on the opponents or your side.

His shotgun and bloody big revolver are pretty fun. Haven't had much experience with the miniAug because I deemed it trash within minutes of trying it. I play him as a soft anchor cos of the impact grenades and wire.
---
He's fun and I'd probably have him higher on the unlock list then a lot of ops of for no other reason than sometimes I get sick of playing Bandit when no-one will pick him on Consulate or House... or Favela... Or Chalet. Villa. Hereford. Jesus, no wonder I've been getting better with Bandit.

I’m almost certain I saw this exact same post, word for word, a couple of days ago. 
---
Wut?
---
I’ve noticed they slowly like to make the game uglier and uglier for the sake of it being competitive and simplifying the graphics. I still prefer this game from 2016-17 more than the shit we have now because it was a billion times more fun and it looked good imo

Good idea but for me I just rotate to a different angle entirely.

Or prone into the barbed wire and march on even though that's a really dumb idea.

---
I know it is easier said then done, and this is rich coming from me (I rage hard at myself and struggle with motivation) but you honestly cant play it thinking its a ranked game. You get into this mindset of "I'm better than this, I am at the least a gold player" and then you struggle and overdo it or take risks you dont need to and end up losing, which only further dumpsters your attitude of "Am I for real right now? I *KNOW* I am better than this!" and then the cycle repeats.
---
You gotta remember the system sucks, games are unfair half the time, you get unlucky in many ways. I've been going for Plat for like 4 seasons now, only just this season did I hit gold 1. Im actually pretty sure every single new season since I started playing I bumped up one more level, not like silver to gold, but like gold 4 to gold 3 etc. I had two separate games that if I just won this one I'd be plat, then I went up against a guy who I can only describe as "Plat 3" with the biggest air quotes possible. Dude went like 18-2, entire enemy team was plats or high golds, my team was low golds and 2 unranked players. Shit happens man you just cant let it get to you. Next season you can do your placements and get placed in gold right away and go from there. Find some online buddies to play with or team up with anybody that communicates even, you dont have to be friends with them you just have to have them on comms.
---
Keep a level head and go out there and get some dubs my guy.
---
pretty sad if that was the most wholesome thing the community could come up with...
---
his gadget is insane, like was lion
---
It's not terrible. It's a good map. I don't say we need it in ranked... Casual would be fine. 
---
When you’re at school so you can’t play it. The feels man 😪

Hopefully it's got ubisoft's attention, coreross just covered it on his channel...

The same thing would happen what is currently happening to tower. Everyone would just leave as soon as you load into the map. It’s very disliked especially among people who played when it first came out in red crow
---
Ahhhhh, that's hot, that's hot
---
I don't think he'll buy it chief
---
I still see your shadows in my room...
---
Can’t take back the love that I gave you...
---
It’s to the point where I love and I hate you...
---
Do you have the UHD texture pack ?
---
Wtfff
---
In high gold/low plat its just people spawnpeaking or staring down a pixel angle for the entire game.
---
No, it doesnt even show up in twitch drops inventory.
---
Love you both.
---
As a Muslim.
---
But that's gonna be an extra 20gb or so... Isn't the full game around 70-80gb in size?
---
Lmao , F
---
Better do that, instead of downloading 54gb and waiting for patching for another hour, i am doing the same. 
---
Much of the 54Gb is going to be better optimized game files, So the game as a whole will be smaller after the update.
---
😬
---
ty, i will try to contact them
---
54.74GB without ultra package for me
---
Just speed up action anims during prep phase honestly. 
---
They changed some stuff to make the overall game size smaller and reduce the size of upcoming patches. That's why the current patch is so big
---
Mine is also 35.7 GB
---
Then either you weren’t signed in or you were in the wrong account or don’t have them linked
---
He probably has Comcast. I do and the issue is their monopoly. I pay an extra $50/month for their unlimited. I could switch to ATT who is unlimited. But since they own the phone lines while Comcast owns the cable lines I'd have to cut my speed from 400mbps to 45mbps.
---
God damn lumberjack 
---
82.69 GB download for me via Ubi launcher. Tha fuck?
---
my man did you read my post? its was a ploy, im not asking about the games update.
---
Just restart steam and you're good to go
---
Thank you just sent one then
---
yeah because a fist has never been used in anything but siege 
---
Yep, I've had downloads that are predicted to take 2-3 days take up an entire week because I'd have to pause the download every single day to use the Internet. Could only download overnight while I was asleep. 
---
You'd think a resource as required as Internet is would be treated as a utility as much as Water &amp; Electricity is, but unfortunately it's as much important as a HD TV is to the living room, not important but nice. 
---
i've 48 gb without uhd
---
[Great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BppZP5Ns7zk)
---
ah ty mate 
---
only 6 hours to go
---
No you don't get the year 4 pass, The Gold edition was only for the Year 3 pass.
---
No?
---
Any competitive multiplayer game you will have that CS: GO, LoL, Dota, RB6. it doesn't matter which game it is there will always be a toxic community. 
---
uplay its like 54gb
---
am i fucking downloading the whole game again or what?
---
Siege invented fists.
---
I don't have the Ultra HD pack and its 49.3gb

MOUNTED
---
82.68gb on uPlay for me.
---
nope - you?
---
Ihih 😊 anyway its still my fault for following the official artwork which no longer features the cigar, I did notice something was missing but when my friend told me what it was it was already too late
---
I need this for Kapkan to more effectively skulk around like a crocodile.
---
The question is , why you post someone's post that doesn't belong to you ?
---
On Uplay or Steam? If steam that is quite weird indeed
---
Mine is 82.69GB on uplay. Might have to do with me having ultra textures installed
---
 this has been the image they use for patches and updates since the release of destiny in 2014. So yes they are copying finka. 
---
Got damn just downloaded this game because im new and boom 3 days later 40gb update nice
---
Lol that's the truth my man 
---
I edited it, forgive me
---
i cant download yet

i linked my accounts last year when i watched the stream, and right before watching this years livestraem just to be sure
---
Same. wth.. ;D
---
Barp.
---
wtf mine is 83 gb wtff
---
My steam download is 49gb instead of the 54 they said
---
Agreed.
---
Didn't expect that ending. Respects F
---
well, is the soviet union copying siege?
---
Yep. True but why though.
---
What why is mine 83 gb wtf
---
He's new to reddit guys dont be mean
---
Clothing Items are not a part of the Character hitboxes.
---
My best spots are on the end of stairs going up and putting barbed wire in the middle of stairs to distract the enemy and then they think their safe and rush up the stairs works pretty well. Also putting double frost mat and having a barbed wire with a bandit battery or electro claw right next to each other is also a good team combo 
---
when i would get halfway decent players in my team i would get diamond soloq easy, but i have the same problem
---
Well it's technically not wrong. Just odd to see it written
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
U aint getting the new ops with y3 pass
---
35 for me !!!
---
Mine is only 5.8 on PC
---
Mines 30gb, probably depends on whether or not you use the HD texture packs or maybe have some files installed from the test server. 
---
I have almost the same, but the *worst* thing is, that I could have 1GB/s (so 100-200 when downloading stuff) but it'd cost me over 35 000€ so that's not happening.
---
I got Xbox early for some reason at 40GB
---
Same wtf whyyyy
---
Takes 10 fucking hours to download
---
Its honestly not worth arguing with someone like him.  He is a hater regardless of the facts, so he will spew BS to make his POV the correct one in his eyes.  Desync is a non-issue in siege unless you are playing in OCE or on a ping above 180, so you're just wrong there. Hit Reg issues are rare at this point in siege, record your gameplay and watch it in 0.25x speed and I guarantee 9/10 your aim is just potato.  3-4 mins in NA Ranked? I havent had that since the first month the game came out, I hardly ever wait more than 1:30 in NA Ranked and I play every day.  Yes Siege has a issue with Peekers advantage, but every game does.  Siege's was the worst for a while due to the advanced leaning mechanics and camera positioning but they are actively trying to fix that, read the patch notes about first and third person camera location.
---
no this patch is shrinking the full games size, this update should make your game file smaller than before the update
---
Downloading right now on Steam, 35.7GB.
---
Without crediting, it's wrong.
---
It might be in the image, and it might even be very obvious, but that doesn't mean you don't credit it.
---
Mine is 83 gb aswell wtf
---
Haha, yes
---
Oh, that's good news! I'm hoping I won't have to clear space to fit in this update.
---
Steam, a friend of mine is using also Steam and he has to download 35gb. I think its cause of the TTS 
---
Man that sucks! I'm *lucky* because I *sound white.* (Hispanic.)
---
Just an FYI, it actually did work, my update was 6.58 GB
---
Confirmed siege invented fisting
---
He credit sau_siege.
---
That's ok. It follows the rules of the sub.
---
⭐
---
You mean red faction? 
---
I’d say yes, but then I’ll cry when it gets removed again and half the player base will be playing that instead of ranked or casual. Also i miss smg 11 acog ;-;
---
E
---
Mine is only 82 gb lol
---
83gb of funnnnnnn
---
It’s older than finka, bet ur a one eye mask user 
---
Ah, you mean if you have the TTS downloaded you have to update less? I do have the TTS downloaded
---
There's no such thing as a bugless application, they will always be fixing stuff, until they're not. If they added it, I wouldn't be upset, options are always good, depends how much work it takes. 
---
why tho - it doesn't look that much better and in a competitive game like siege you should focus more on good fps than visuals in my opinion + you'll save around 10gb of disk space / update size. But if you do care about visual then you can keep them of course :)
---
in the ubisoft account information it says that my account that i watcher the steam on is linked with ubisoft. Last year i got the charms when i watched the stream with that acc.
---
I literally have no idea tho.. what about your update size?
---
op is not doing to well in the head
---
It’s not a true ace if you don’t get the hostage as well
---
And I stuck with a 60hz monitor ATM so it's no difference if I have 100+ fps or not
---
nice
---
Your friends r gay
---
**Bruh!**
---
I didn't realize exothermic charges were sentient and had a sense of humour! 
---
(I ugly laughed in front of the in-laws, god help me.)
---
From what I have gathered asking a few people, if you have the TTS installed it's only 35 gigs, without it's 50+. Not sure of course but that seems to be the case so far. 
---
Don't do that
---
aye most people say that unless you are playing 4k its not worth the time to use it.
---
Gay isn't bad
---
the runout timer *IS* 3 seconds lol
---
Is it coming this update? 
---
From what I have gathered asking a few people, if you have the TTS installed it's only 35 gigs, without it's 50+. Not sure of course but that seems to be the case so far.
---
Yeah, I was taken back when I saw the file size.
---
Download just started and it shows an estimated completion time of 20 hours. :(
---
Siege isn't an Xbox Play Anywhere title.
---
I have the HD pack and mine is downloading 49.5 right now.
---
Why is it 36ish GB for two OP's. What have I missed?
---
It's the update... 
---
Rip mine is 1hour and 44 minutes 
---
Is that so? I really hope so tho since i have a capped internet 😂
---
Thanks but I'm already running a hyper-optimised version of windows. Also the loading times I'm complaining about are 15-20s (especially when late joining). I can't imagine you could go 5 minutes without being kicked.
---
Steam compresses the files. UPlay does not. 
---
Both have their up and downsides. Steam puts a larger load on your CPU and has a higher chance of corrupted files during install. But UPlay takes longer to download. 
---
It's been a rought time for the ash-jager mains. I think they're getting a lot of flashbacks of jager losing his acog
---
To download only atm
---
lmfaooo
---
Same man!!! Also bought the pass for the first time. Super hyped good luck to us aha
---
No. Just for one game mode. Everything else is the same but it’s just so newer players can experience og r6 and so that older players can have a bit of nostalgia (if you could even call it that)
---
Don't have the TTS installed and mine is 35gb, so not sure that it's that
---
it went live five minutes ago, and the download size is 35.7 gigs
---
I always thought thermite was ugly af. Now I'm confused LMAO
---
damn console is painful to watch, nice one tho
---
Thanks man. I was worried that my game would be messed up
---
On my way to the trains, I could get 30 points from cams alone
---
I dont know why but it says 35GB on mine
---
It's the update...
---
The fact that you think Hit Reg is a non-issue just makes your opinion invalid. I record all my games, I have hours of footage and I regularly upload videos on my channel exposing the embarrassing hit reg in the game. 
---
The para bell in to me the best Y3 charm this is just some ms paint looking shape 
---
Wasn’t it in his bio that he *accidentally* killed his family? 
---
Maverick he has great guns and his gadget is really useful 
---
This is the size of the update.
---
It would be awesome if Thermite was Matt from demolition ranch
---
Z
---
where do you get the sizes ? my pc patch was 35.7 gb .
---
That’s probably the best edit I’ve ever seen. 
---
It's 35.7GB for me, wot. 
---
I had them linked and i was logged in, the only thing that could be the problem is that i synced my accounts again before watching the stream just to be sure.
---
I know BUT WHY!! so much!! its like, I am redownloading the WHOLE game
---
[I see yours and raise you...](https://i.imgur.com/a9pO8lb.png)
---
Shit. What could it be than?
---
Let's go!!!
---
Its su fcking big 
---
It’s a fresh download of the game, it doesn’t add on to the 80+gb already installed
---
Iirc they've already confirmed no pro league outfit will ever be returning. Besides, Buck with the beret and Rogue outfit is hands down the best looking Buck get up you can wear. 
---
he’s also better in game probably got a clip against me. best player i’ve ever played against.
---
This has happened to me with frag grenades, and sometimes even my own gun. 
---
I’ve apparently shot myself in the head in this game before. So fucking weird.
---
Ah interesting to read, if not that I'm thoroughly confused what it is. It's not steam versus Uplay, from what people say it's not UHD or non UHD pack...
---
Mine is 83.69gb.... why am I reinstalling the whole game
---
what? really?
---
game got restructured, has around 26GB less on PC now. from 80 to 54GB.
---
The fuck
---
Could be the hd textures
---
They're handling the files differently now, and with delta updates that means redownloading pretty much everything again.
---
Admittedly they could have used some smart-ish programming to copy existing data instead of downloading it, but Steam and Uplay are most likely not suited for that.
---
im player C that cries on discord to my mates
---
yes...
---
But i don't have the tts installed..
---

Please use /r/Rainbow6TTS for any discussions about the Rainbow Six Siege Technical Test Servers. For reporting issues with the TTS, please visit [R6Fix site](https://r6fix.ubi.com/ "Click here to be redirected to R6Fix"). Thank you.
---
*Your post has* ***not*** *been removed from /r/Rainbow6.*
---
Do you have TTS installed? or HD texture pack?
---
I think it's the whole game. They are improving the way future updates will be delivered. They certainly need a whole update to get it right
---
hd textures?
---
and i dont even have the ultra HD pack!!
---
Cries in ISP hard data caps..
---
This update will guarantee smaller update sizes in the future and optimizes a lot of the game so it will actually be a smaller size on your hard drive.
---
Neither. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It is 60 GByte for me. What irks me the most is that ubisoft servers are not fast enough to saturate my connection. Only getting 35Mbyte/s, which isn't even half my bandwidth.
---
Hmmm more like finka copying bungie since they’ve had that design for years now 
---
Strangely when I played Ash I usually just ran Holograohic anyway, if I’m pushing site at close quarters the ACOG makes my job more difficult lol
---
The joke is the person who killed doc was playing finka, your tag says finka main. Queue laughter.
---
go look at the patch notes
---
You sure it's not the texture pack?  People were saying that there's was 80ish with it downloaded in another thread
---
For &gt;just&lt; the new map though? Idk man, that's crazy.
---
Hello anakinchoo, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/axzkvt/when_devs_release_a_couple_of_bug_fixes_and/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

god imagine doing no leg work, I mean not even looking at the top post on the "hot" tab and just expecting other people to give you info that you could have had faster if you just too 3 seconds to do something yourself.
---
Press F to pay respects 
---
Probably a bunch of Swedes.. :)
---
20 gig for a whole map and two ops?
---
Luckily i never downloaded the hd pack 😂 hopefully that is the case tho
---
NO FUN ALLOWED, ONLY SWEATING
---
Leke Electro!
---
My friend is like way bigger that kiad standing a 2.05m
---
Lmao 
---
Pre-season Maintenance. Basically they are loading the update to the servers so it becomes available for download.
---
Then I suppose that theory goes out of the window as well! weird. It's not steam versus Uplay as people have the 50 and 35 gigs on steam. It's not UHD or not supposedly as people with and without are reporting to have 35 and 50 (people without UHD reporting download sizes of 50 gig update). 
---
Shots 1-5: clearly missed.
---
6-10: close, but still missed
---
11-15: bad recoil control, missed.
---
16-20: would've hit but you were already dead serverside.
---
Well I don't know how long you've been away from the game but this is the topic of discussion right now.
---
https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/game-info/seasons/burnthorizon/index.aspx
---
&gt;35 gb
---
##YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
49.9 GB Here. Steam.
---
Thanks
---
Woof
---
You welcome 
---
I never played tts tho dam
---
another downvote
---
I know these were leaked but are they real? If so, i want them
---
Doesn't work with dedis.
---
I also laughed really hard of joy when I remembered she loses her acog today! 
---
Are those stats msi afterburner?
---
Please get the servers for us south Africans we have been waiting and waiting we have finally heard some good news and now its up to you guys to make the dream come true please ubi 
---
I'm pretty sure you'll still get the plat charm if you hit diamond so I'm sure that's not why stay in plat
---
Idk too, was expecting a dead link.
---
0:04 “I’m pregnant” YEET
---
No. Once you're loaded, drive speed doesn't matter during a match. Just loading the first round of a map, and to a much lesser degree subsequent rounds.
---
He's a dumbass alt-right troll.
---
Do you have the ultra hd pack installed before?
---
The superspeed internet placed in Germany?;D
---
It's around 50 for Uplay, but 80 with the HD textures. Steam size should be 35. 
---
1st Don't rush developers
---
2nd COD is way less complicated than siege is so it's a useless comparison 
---
I'm on PC in Europe.
---
Thank you
---
I don't think you fully understand what a Denial of Service is or how severs work. If it were a true DDOS, none of us would be playing at that time. There are more than 1 or 2 servers facilitating this game. Probably hosted in an AWS/Google/Microsoft environment.  They have security provisions in place to catch them before they are widespread. Most likely just users quitting. Only PC players complain about DDOS attacks in general. 
---
Dont u get the charm for the highest rank you get?
---
Nop.
---
I’d actually buy 
---
I’d commission you so fast if I could
---
Thanks for the question!   
---
So we're running the platform under the guidance of coaches, as such we think it would be unfair to decide what each coaches charge. This is partly due to the fact that some coaches have vastly different skill ranges and experience. So we let the coach's charge whatever they think they are worth and if customers are happy to pay this, then that coach will get business, if not then the coach may need to consider reducing the price. 
---
Brutal download speed haha
---
But why is the steam size smaller than uplay since the game goes through uplay anyway?
---
aye alright you got me with that past tense, so I apologize however, sony knows they will have to play ball soon or else what happened with xbox this generation will be what happens to them in the upcoming gen. you don't want to be the console with less features.
---
also its not just for one game fortnite (as trash of a games as it is) is cross play with sony. and more games are planned on using crossplay. sony isn't denying cross play like they were
---
Downloading mine now although its [82Gb](https://i.imgur.com/ck34iAv.png)
---
It's good for some maps, but the meme is starting to get really annoying. 
---
Me neither
---
It wouldn’t be possible.
---
Do you watch timeless, or did you rather? Because this looks similar to [Wyatt Logan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5511582/mediaviewer/rm2542077696?ft0=name&amp;fv0=nm1782667&amp;ft1=image_type&amp;fv1=still_frame)
---
That's how they bring the server instance down is it? By a few players leaving...
---
There's a playable build already as demonstrated during the invitational. Regardless how does it take over a year to nerf an OP operator reasonably when CS took care of the R8 within a week?
---
damn haven’t seen raptor legs in a loonngg time. thanks for this 
---
Gridlock?Pathetic Mozzie is da best
---
True, but she becomes less powerful on distance hopefully. Also, the ads time of the R4 is rediculous for an assault rifle and "abusing" quick scoping with the acog is abolished.
---
Why draw her caucasian
---
extended barrel REEEEEEE
---
It's actually reducing the size of the file afterwards. That's why it has to be so big. It's reworking the entire code of the game so they have to put the whole game size in the update.
---
Elaborate?
---
Besides from this obviously being a joke, you actually only get the charm of the highest rank you hit in the season. 
---
Explain how crouching in R6 is more complicated than crouching in COD please.
---
Mine sat on preallocating for 20 min with a SSD on steam wait for 15-20 min it's a big update it should start
---
when it's so easy, you can work for them and fix everything, wanna see it soon man
---
Put the middle east in there please. I've put up with crouch spamming Abood_q8 for too long in EU. 
---
Yeah, a lot.....but it's their job. 
---
In Engineering, massive amounts effort goes in into making a product. 
---
The customer doesn't give a damn how difficult engineering is, if the product is not satisfactory/unreliable the customer will of course complain, not that I can blame them. 
---
Nope mine is 35 
---
35GB???? What's in these files??
---
These R6 credits bout to be dropped!!! That is sexy as hell
---
Every button is already used. Unless you have a pro-controller, it wouldn’t be possible. Now that isn’t fair for everybody now is it?
---
&gt; There's a playable build already as demonstrated during the invitational. 
---
Doesn't answer the question.
---
&gt;Regardless how does it take over a year to nerf an OP operator reasonably when CS took care of the R8 within a week?
---
You think changing a few numbers on a gun is remotely comparable to rewriting an operator?Well that answers my first question.
---
Thank you! hopefully there will be more to come
---
Glad youre enjoying my attachment choices. Extended barrel is the best attachment
---
wouldn’t say that, it is possible but the controls would be clunky as it would have to be hold the analog sticks for example 
---
For me, it just slow downloading, nothing about haven't too less space (I have a game in other disc than system, however on system I have only 40 Gb left  - maybe that's the problem?)
---
&gt; Yeah, a lot.....but it's their job.
---
So that somehow means it's quick and easy?
---
I'm consistently Diamond with coaching experience. Lmk if you're interested once things are further along
---
Alright, that's what I thought. Thanks.
---
It's. Not. Just. About. Crouching.
---
You can't just change one thing about the games code and expect it to work flawlessly. And there's no doubt that siege has wayyy more complicated code than in cod.
---
The update is around 50 gb so that may be it
---
Absolutely crazy. 54GB was bad enough with my 5mb/s lol
---
By Grabthar's hammer, what a savings.
---
the game is more complicated, not that specific aspect of it
---
Players leaving at the same time won't bring a server down. If it does, then it's a flaw in the Azure environment. You might just be experiencing what the first world describes as 'Bad luck'.
---
Look like they forgot to end the old sale :D
---
wonder why the difference between uplay and steam though still?
---
Meanwhile the few times I play glaz I either miss my shots cause I panic or my shots dont register. ._.
---
However, it's the second time they've done that. Almost like the first time around doesn't matter.
---
Fam it’s a high definition CSS model
---
I personally think Nier Automata is Platinum Games at it's finest
---
for real though, that's a big oof
---
They didnt change it, is a issue
---
I asked for this literally a year ago on Reddit and one of the community managers responded and agreed it would be a great idea saying that it was one of the things among many they are working on and which would be coming soon. In case you missed the first part, it was a year ago, if not more. So yeah.
---
Well, atleast it's open now  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
&gt; Players leaving at the same time won't bring a server down
---
No shit. Quite clearly not what I was saying.
---
Well obviously they don’t care about “being fair to everybody” because it is only on mouse and keyboard lmao. You could double tap the lean button or something, could definitely be added somehow. 
---
Yup.
---
The only way to use it beneficially would be to have a controller with paddles. Means that you would be forced to buy an extra controller to not be disadvantaged. That’s why they won’t do it. 
---
Hi that's great! We'd definitely be interested in having you on the platform. If you're interested in being involved, the best thing to do would be for you to email us at [admin@akolyte.pro](mailto:admin@akolyte.pro) so we can take some info from you and have you featured on the website at launch.
---
this has to be a troll. no body give him an answer make him use his eyes
---
A dumb question does everyone get this or some few players Wind Bastion was my first season 
---
When I was allocating and appeared the download size was 36.6 Gb. Then I paused and returned the download and became 49.9.
---
Yeah i'm still waiting for a reply on that one since the game still goes through uplay eventho you have it on steam..
---
Yup, was complained about day 1 of the test server and they did absolutely nothing about it.
---
They explain it in the patch notes/addendum I think
---
It’s not on mouse and keyboard on console so it’s not unfair 
---
https://prnt.sc/mu4k95
---
Final size after update.

It's not quick and easy, but there's no excuse for it to take that long. It would be excusable if they were students who's learning how to code. But not a triple AAA company like Ubisoft. 
---
You just couldnt take the pressure anymore.
---
Jason Bourne it’s Jesus Christ
---
Yeah. I'm getting the same thing. alt tab used to basically be instant, now it's taking a few seconds of a black screen to get back into the game. Kinda annoying.
---
But people already play on console with mouse and key so this argument doesn’t make much sense. Just add it for the people that do have the controllers, wouldn’t be that hard.
---
Like?
---
hey, i'm just trying to stroke your technical ego. I've been doing high level IT as a career for 10 years or so, so I'm good. 
---
Its about 60% MnK 40% controller.
---
I understand all of the outrage about how big of an advantage it has but I just bought it to see how I liked MnK before i make the switch to PC which will be soon.
---
Seems like the same problem.. you use ring or middle finger to lean left and pointer to lean right, occupying those fingers from WASD positions
---
I downloaded 35 on steam only
---
*cries in 160*
---
One bolt is all I need
---
Can this plz be concept art for a actually good Elite for him instead of the one he has now
---
Question is, why don't we just nuke the town? 
---
Thatcher has frag grenades that look like his EMPs
---
Doesn't matter. Ubi set a rule that 2 and 3 speed operators can't have an acog and it's not going to change. Regardless of the weapon.
---
Yeah, I’ve made a mental note to always destroy the original if that happens to me
---
Read the post my dude. He mentions these things hypothetically. Also, you can already use MnK on console

---
I’m on the opposite sid rod my house from my router, in my room, it says it goes 25 mbps but it really goes about 2.
---
the time it comes out lol
---
this big update is going to make the game a lot smaller for example on Pc the game is 79gbs but after the update it will only be 60 gigs and it should make all future updates size smaller 
---
You haven’t played against finka, ela or smoke then
---
Lol yes and warming up a little bit
---
Frost ace huh. Don’t see too many of those around here. Good job tho!
---
The engine: renders tons of breakable floors, real explosives, holograms, and laser cameras. 👍

Also the engine: just a bipod👎
---
Literally how Ubi

---
Nah not that much of a problem I think. The weight helps with that massively. You can find plenty of videos of people firing rifle caliber LMGs from the shoulder. I don't say you can control the recoil as well as with an assault rifle, but spraying down a bit of covering fire will be difinitely possible.
---
If you watch the hot breach podcast its_epi discussed the issue 
---
I mean dude, what kind of pill is that, of course we don’t want you to paint Tachanka
---
MOM GET THE CAMERA
---
Looks like the Blood Orchid uniform
---
But they are, this sub won’t agree but they are just fundamentally broken. Especially with Blitz’s flash and sprinting, and the fact Monty can unshield and melee you in less than a second. 
---
And people always say things like just crossfire, just use trap ops and just use C4s. But the fact is most of the time you can’t even get a crossfire setup for the shield. 
---
Or that most of the time a shield will take a max of like 2 Gu mines a round in most site pushes. All Gu mines do is slow the push by ~5-10 seconds like they do for any attacker. Also Smoke grenades do the same, they only slow the push for ~8-10 seconds, like they do for any attacker so to say he’s a good counter to shields is the same as saying he is a good counter for any other attacker.
---
Then finally the fact Monty only takes 25dmg when looking at a C4 is just stupid and Blitz taking ~35dmg. It is very hard and inconsistent to get a C4 to land and kill the shield operator, making it a mostly unviable counter to the shield operators. 
---
At the moment shields can walk into a room without their brain and they aren’t punished for it, because there is next to nothing the defenders can do to stop them pushing in and claiming the map control, completely for free with no utility used.
---
😱🤯
---
I think this season is going to make people realize just how valuable their drones are. Too many people waste them or leave them in the open after the prep phase. 
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Sometime soon probably. Maybe when the ops drop for everyone, which is a week, if not today or tommorow
---
You hit diamond you get diamond, regardless of your final rank. You can even derank all the way to copper, if you hit diamond at least once, you get diamond.
---
Lion reveals your teams position 
---
what? the main spawnpeek operators are doc and rook who are both 3 armour.
---
That kind of peek is difficult to fight and I understand what you're saying. Very frustrating.
---
Had me in the first half not gonna lie
---
It’s going to be imperative! 
---
This is just a repetitive news item from buying the season pass if you already owned the pass from the previous year. Pass no remarks on this!
---
try restarting client?
---
Before thenerf you were a fool if you used an ar or an smg
---
What rank are you? This is prettt average aim in plat, UNLESS EVERYBODY IS USING MOUSE AND KEYBOARD 
---
At higher ranks there is almost like a gentleman’s agreement at the start of the game that if one team doesn’t pick the cancer ops then the other team wont either. 
---
these Ash face posts are so funny AND original. they aren’t posted 5000 times a day or anything 
---
Gracias amigo - es workeeng now!
---
We heard that one last year, yet here we are with another giant update. 
---
smoke/mute's shotty is still incredible
---
Same but the seasons go by so quick now that it won't feel that long.
---
Have you ever heard of this thing called punctuation?
---
I wish they'd get headshot multipliers again, tbh. Just divide it among all the pellets.
---
Our roamers are also planning to try out suppressed secondaries to clear the new attackers traps. 
---
Thoughts on this? 
---
Yea, especially near high gold/plat and above.
---
very gay
---
Thanks, here's a version without the face paint if you're interested:

I have 82 GB and it's downloading at 1 MB/s :)
---
Just follow rainbow six siege on Twitter they give out useful info or just use core Ross on YouTube that we’re I get all my info you shouldn’t have to scramble through random posts on reddit to get basic info 
---
ACOG SMG-11 pre-recoil nerf omg omg
---
Imagine how terrifying it would be if K1A had ACOG 
---
How about saudi servers. EU servers is flooded with people on 150ping especially in high ranks due to the nature of how easy it is for a 5 stack to hit at least plat 2. Having to play 5 stacks teleporting everywhere and qec spamming on 150ping every second game on maps such as fortress or hereford ruins the competitive integrity of ranked.
---
\- Juliet, DUCK!  
---
\- Why??  
---
\- Cus I said so...
---
37gb update on xbox, good God, guess I'll dl it while at work just kinda sucks for those with data caps (thanks comcast)
---
There we go bro
---
If there was a game mode where every character was in their prime it's basically battle of the gods at that point
---
that is strange, wonder how that works?
---
But now it's the opposite side completely. Now you are a fool if you use a shotgun as a primary.
---
I don’t remember anything about ubisoft changing the way the data is stored and this giant update is literally making the game size smaller so if anything you are only gaining storage space oppose to loosing 
---
this is literally not true at all 
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again breaching charges and thermite charges are cursed. All they want is to kill their owners with trickery and deception 
---
Someone doesn’t know how big a centimeter is..
---
Has the central time zone Xbox one update went live?
---
More like, “sorry, I didn’t see you there.” But it’s normal mode, so we have like minute long standoffs grinding eachother down to zero health before we tbag and kill “oops sorry my bad.”
---
That could be fun lol... pickrate over 9000
---
They need to do the same for middle easterners too. Them fucking Arabs with their 200 ping and mad toxicity can take that shit somewhere else.
---
Always that one guy
---
Have you found the answer?
---
I'm somewhat lucky as Canada deemed internet an essential service up there with water electricity and phone line. They started a fund to help provide the infrastructure for these companies and have landed on 50mbps down and 10mbps upload as a minimum for all houses by 2021. In the meantime I'm stuck with xplornet which is slow expensive capped at 500 gigs a month and the only option in our area :(
---
Yea this is like trying to break a rock with your hand for my internet 
---
Gotta love background downloads/updates. Should download by the time I’m home from work. My connection roams around 110-120 mbps 🙂
---
They said operation health would allow them to do smaller updates with more content. 
---
oh shit i got bodhi on here. fucken' famous. nah but how ya doing?
---
Insert Donald Trump here saying "Worst trade deal in trade deal history, maybe ever"

It has been out for almost an hour now. But it'll be downloaded when I get home
---
That's only if you've already teamkilled recently...
---
You must be reeeeal fun at parties huh
---
The first image is from OG Siege the lighting looked a lot better but blinded you whenever you looked outside and was also super dark inside.
---
When is the price reduction coming about?
---
you’re completely missing the point. your argument is that the acog is a *more* important factor than firerate. I’m dismissing that by saying that kaid would then peek more than jäger, he has higher magnification but slower fire rate after all. you can’t then compare doc and kaid, because the mp5 has both mag and a higher firerate, comparing doc and jäger is irrelevant. You also disprove your own point here, because , as *you* say, Doc peeks a lot more than kaid. THATS BECAUSE ITS FULLY AUTO. Kaids pistol and shotgun both have higher damage per shot than the mp5. 
---
you also say that damage is more important but that people go for one taps? every gun is a one shot headshot, so if everyone is getting one taps then body damage is completely irrelevant. you contradict yourself so many times. And firerate isn’t important for long range? errrrr, yes it is, it allows you to fling bullets down range and therefore increase your change at getting a headshot. 
---
I’m not advocating adding an acog to this gun because what you say about being a 2 speed is true, they shouldn’t have acogs on defence. your statement about spawnpeeking however is just straight up wrong. 
---
Still downloading.
---
I just forced it to update and now just taking an hour break from Xbox so it can download as fast as possible 
---
It's a pro strat, don't judge
---
well you can’t really compare that to this update anymore since this update is literally giving you back space
---
Okay I’m central time zone, hopefully it’s out for me. I’ll head home on lunch and start download 
---
They can certainly control which devices can interface with the console via USB (or any other port), and to what extent. The reason they’re allowing mnk isn’t because they can’t solve the issue (it’s not an issue for them at all actually), is to increase the player base.
---
I think we need an IQ type of defender....
---
can u suggest another song so i can make another video?? not necessarily a r6 one though
---
Sounds like something I've used in modern warfare 1 campaign before.
---
Pick and ban isn't enough to bring ranked out of beta. The road to invitations really should be the new ranked. I don't see as many people bring up the massive issue of ranked not being solely bomb. It makes comparing ranks next to useless when one person could be playing solely bomb while another is grinding our secure area. 
---
I'm supposed to be in South America but I got placed against North Americans. 150+ ping for me.
---
Servers are super slow with this download, I'm at a quarter of my usual download speeds compared to other games on Steam...
---
It wasn’t really needed on console idk about pc tho 
---
Absolutely
---
because it wasn't a problem. but now there's 3 years of patches that add extra baggage on to the client so it's good idea to clean shit up once in a while. The problem is that you now need to repack everything again
---
i fixed it with google dns
---
How is it possible to get a copper charm? I was under the impression that even if you lost all 10 placements miserably, you'd still be at least bronze.
---
5% you won't find a better deal
---
I’ve had it happen a few times where I try to aim in and lean right at the same time but the ADS animation isn’t finished so it just knifes the air and I end up looking like an idiot.
---
Curious to know this as well.
---
Patch size does not equal download amount....... why is this hard to fathom
---
No
---
That was is good yeah, I was joking for the most part when I said that.
---
Makes him an actual sniper now and not some guy who throws a smoke and run in killing everyone
---
I think its frost u r right
---
Yeah, that’s what prompted the post. It doesn’t really matter that damage will be reflected on the second attempt, because people will leave after the first, and most who join midway leave too.
---
You will not be refunded, no.
---
manually install the y4 pass and it should work
---
My PS4 is literally saying 10hrs left..... Wtf? 
---
I can only guess it's optimised textures.
---
No. Same goes with buying bundles.
---
How?
---
I was really looking forward to being a capitao main too smh 
---
Note: Steam vs Uplay sizes will be different. Steam patch size is ~35 GB, whilst Uplay is ~52 GB. This is expected and is not because you have the UHD texture pack installed. Steam's download compression is far greater than other clients, and this is the case for many games. Check other Ubisoft patch sizes to compare and it's the same pattern.
---
Yeah thats just an option, its not neccesary, even tho i though false reports are still a punsihable offence
---
C-C-C-Console
---
Do you need to activate it or do they immediately start upon redeeming them?
---
steam or Uplay. I have the same issues on steam. it will download the full file but not launch properly. it will still be running in the background. I've tried reinstalling validating files checking for programs that might interrupt the launcher and battle eye. might have to wait for next patch or they might have to install a hotfix
---
Agreed. A little weird that they wouldn’t update it. 
---
source? i've been trying to figure out this too but saw they're ending the discount and keeping year 1 operators at their original launch price. i'm still holding out on a few operators in hopes year 2 will get a similar discount
---
I do even though I like to play Glaz, I think people need to use Glaz as an actual Sniper.
---
alright, you can tap fire for a whole two bullets, massive that. you then have a slow reload. you have to hit both of your shots to even down operators at range from body shots, so again- you have two attempts to hit their head or no kill for you. 
---
I agree with what you say about how you spawnpeek, for example I regularly break all the windows to police line on consulate despite having no intention to peak (death trap let’s be honest) but it can waste a huge amount of time for no risk and no utility being used, win win for you as the defender. However, I fail to see how again, this has even a remote link to the bosg, which you stated would be picked 100% of the time and used to spawnpeek 100% of the time if it had an acog added. I’m not going to reply to anything else, you just keep talking about other things that are unrelated to the statement you made and that I contested.  
---
Yea kind of sucks that the only solution is to make it easier to use mouse and keyboard. But I'd prefer that than to need a 200$ adapter.
---
His right arm looks like it's being infested by the zerg as we speak. Somebody call doc.
---
Or Kaid
---
Less recoil? Have you ever tried using the smg 11 or smg 12 on console?
---
I'd love to see that
---
The defenders??
---
Hello microgroweryfan, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ay1tbq/is_anyone_else_having_an_issue_where_i_cannot/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Wtf I fucking knew I should've thrown to copper
---
Looks so damn good
---
because they want Capitao's bolt to be used to clear out an area, not to be used as a granade. 
---
It’s called a hyper dash
---
Good
---
What kinda calculator mate?
---
How about, use your drone? Always see teammates blindly walking about just hoping to shoot anyone they see, when they have a drone and can find out if anyone is there beforehand - just like you would have done if you droned the area first.
---
We actually don't, he has a starter version purchased about 2 months ago, mine is a base version from 2 years ago. If so may I ask what extra stuff am I downloading? Or maybe just replacing?
---
Yes, I want this. For all of them. I like the style of the game and how they make the ops from different CTUs look unique and stylized. But the real outfitting of CTUs and SF is so much cooler.
---
Thats not how snakes work at all
---
You release a snake in a space it doesnt know full of weird loud sounds and it would nope the fuck out of there
---
His is an Owo/uwu free Zone. Any uwu or owo’ing will get you executed by DP-28 firing squad. Have a good day, comrade. 
---
Anyone else buy the season pass but don’t have the new ops unlocked? Or is it just me 
---
For why this happened: 
---
I couldn't decide what Operator I wanted to buy at 25k so I decided to wait while I decided, instead of buying then regretting my decision. I then got to 50k and couldn't decide between which 2 to buy, so I decided to wait while deciding again. I got to 75k and had 6 Operators in my head I wanted to get, but could only get 3, so while I decided I waited. 
---
It kinda just spiralled on from then on. At around the 150k point it started to become a meme for my friends on how much Renown I could save up without buying a single DLC Op. How I could be the first player to reach 1,000,000 Renown without using it. I wanted to see how far I could take it, so this is the result. 
---
For how this happened: 
---
Lots of T-Hunt, lots of Casual, some renown boosters too. I grind T-Hunt for hours a day to train my aim so that when I jump online I'm not rusty. I'm a very momentum based player, if I wake up and jump straight into multiplayer I'll get destroyed because I don't have the aim to play that day yet. This causes me to lose, and I spiral downwards and lose the majority of my matches. If I train in T-Hunt before jumping online I can get some momentum going and get the aim practise in, allowing me to take that momentum into online matches. Because I play so much T-Hunt I happen to accrue large amounts of Renown without even realising. I earned roughly 20k Renown in 1 play day combining a Renown Booster with a Double Renown Weekend, and I didn't even realise till I went back to the main menu and looked when I went to log off for the day. 
---
“Nothing else to say”

Good thing to spend your Club points on, given that they will start expiring next month.
---
Have u tried changing the server
---
Yes I did :) Any news on when year 3 operator bundle will be available?? Thanks
---
Who’s offended?
---
hehe back in open beta / early seasons where everybody where running silencers XD
---
Did you see Kaid ?
---
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐+⭐
---
Those fuckin controller pack things are 10x worse
---
Thaks

How do I do it again 
---
That's a perfect last kill... What the problem?
---
the female operator is comically large, looks like a cartoon character
---
Omg you are that guy who killed another guy while hiding in a body and then the other came crying on Reddit
---
Not just you... I’m waiting too
---
Idk am in class lol
---
Yea and there is less recoil on console than there is on PC look up a comparison video if you dont believe me.
---
 Look at this asshat using a mouse and keyboard on console 
---
😭😭😭
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I could have swore that Ubi said that they're going to be phasing the Ubisoft Club out this year? Or something about the points. Maybe I'm thinking of something else but I was sure that I would have to find something to use my points on before later this year. Hmm I'll look it up.
---
U are late
---
What do you mean by changing the server? You can change download centers?
---
might be if you bought from different platforms like steam and uplay 
---
oh yes because everyone thought you couldnt hear them if they used silencers 
---
Why shouldn't they release the patch notes as soon as they go on the tts? They need people to know what's new so they can test it and get feedback if they need to change anything before it goes live. If there were no patch notes until it went live then no one would know what's new besides the ops and map.
---
cooooooooonsoleeeeeeee

It's most likely an old notification from the 600 credits you already received when you got the season pass. If you didn't get them prior, send in a ticket to support.ubi.com!
---
Im getting 130, Im in Australia. But SEAU is the seaver.
---
Crazy man. Only reason I buy it every year is to play all the new ops. Waste of money if it’s gonna glitch out like this. 
---
your logic is the same with "global warming isn't  real it snowed yesterday" ,like i shouldn't watch blue when i have no teammate covering my ass because that always work like a charm.I don't know about ya ,but we don't all queue with best squad and it is really risky trust that it someone will have your back.
---
Just checked, it’s only available once, which makes sense, but it’s still a little disappointing 
---
Wasss
---
Oof
---
I don’t think so, for the most part the devs seem pretty keen on keeping the controllers on consoles the main way of playing since I’m pretty sure they consider MnK cheating, I could be wrong though
---
u may be right, to be honest i have never thought this way. as the community we dont have to think about details. we just tell ubi what we want and they work on it thats how it works
---
I said "BosG with Acog would be good" 
---
You said "No becuase uh...Kaid is bad!" 
---
I said "Kaid is bad because he has no close range options, not because of his shotgun." 
---
You said "Uh...well, that has nothing to do with anything! Spawn peeking is bad!" 
---
I said "Spawn peeking isn't bad, here's why" 
---
Then you bring out "You keep changing the topic!" 
---
In that regard, I'm glad this conversation is ending. 
---
A split second before drone phase starts you can see Kaid do the T-Pose and I tripped out. I told my team immediately that they have a Kaid before we started scanning anyone and they’re all like how the fuck did you know lol. 
---
when i got home i just clicked on the game and it prompted an update.
---
Proof?
---
Yeah, I think so...
---
Dam 50gb... Gotta savey bandwidth for division 2 next week
---
*puts it on your gun*
---
you’re crazy
---
they're the same thing right? so it's faster to download it via steam?
---
Gonna be a long week bro😂🤘
---
Except when would you ever waste a reinforcement on that wall
---
Okay?
---
It’s cause they didn’t have the lord in the corner with them 
---
To my knowledge one shot from the launcher only shoots one of those little four-legged "spiders" out.
---
Bug or not, it's weird
---
Power move. 
---
When is is coming out??
---
Bless
---
I got this, but no credits! :(
---
There's always the R34 version.
---
Are there a lot of cheaters on PC?
---
I play a lot of Ash (about 100 hours and for sure more than 1200 kills on her), and I prefer the Flash Hider, to be honest.
---
Gets rid of the first shot kick, and since there's not ACOG option anymore, I don't  even think the horizontal is that bad in 1x scopes. It's much easier to control. Although, I've always ran reflex on her anyway.
---
That's still a problem when your disk is full, means reinstalling.

In r6 the average kill distance is around 10m and the drop-off starts around 20m.There is a reason the extended barrel is the worst barrel attachment.

This is not the console. Just the graphics settings in the files. Anyond can change them.

Hey, just wanted to say thanks for the new op! I got a message saying i'd get an extra 600 r6 points for being a long time player - which i hella appreciate!- but they havent been credited yet! Is ubi aware?

I have that glitch all the time. The first time I got it was in Grim Sky. Restart your game it fixes it.

Looks 100x better than it did before.
---
Could be worse it could be from gridlocks my 600 pound life 
---
I get a little giddy whenever I see this reference.  Time to watch Galaxy Quest again
---
Csgo is not open source. Its made on the source engine. 
---
This is not the code of the game or the console. These are literally your graphics settings. The settings you make/change have to be stored somewhere right? This where they are. 
---
It gets more expensive haha
---
She has to appeal to the male fantasy
---
I think Console is better because you can focus more on actual strategy than relying on aim, but if you’re better at aiming than game strategy PC is probably better. 
---
She looks uglier than before the update..
---
Well good luck sir
---
To me Skull Rain had the best charm by far
---
Shut up and take my Rainbowbux
---
Nope, needs one more shell to be okay.
---
I have no clue then
---
I though dokkebis calls were reduced to 12?
---
I hate they are charging us to advertise for UA. 
---
Encouraging them during a match I’m losing benefits anyone right there in that moment considering I probably won’t play with them. All you can do is be frustrated and send “delete game” so hopefully you’ll never play with that trash can of a team mate again. 
---
Nah man, I’m pretty sure thats recruit
---
I started in operation health :'(
---
I’m not sure but you may need to install the pass, that’s what happened with the previous year 
---
It was never intended at all, they reverted it really early in the TTS phase. It wasn't a nerf, just an error. 
---
Yeah I heard about the driver work around, but using a driver from 2017 doesn’t seem like a great solution.
---

---
thank you for your help, just found out it wasn’t installed. usually other seasons it would be.
---
100%%%%
---
Don't know why it does it on PS4 but it puts the dlc onto siege. I'm no sure if it does it for the physical game but I know it does it on digital
---
Supposed to be free
---
I want to know who on the dev team is from the North Dallas area, because Plano, TX in his bio is very specific. 
---
“I grew up where Frito Lay, Dr Pepper and Thermite are from.” 
---
Same for me. I dont understand
---
Nah you have to deal with it. It slows down if you switch screens, but make sure do that after you accept challenges
---
And still not getting the woosh... I must be dumb. 
---
Don't worry, at least for now... you won't believe how stupid people are as they are still destroying owned drones. 
---
in a 1v1 to trick the enemy
---
#Seinfeild music plays.
---
Cant hear anything
---
HAHA OMG SO FUNNY REPOSTED MAYMAY LOLOLOLOL
---
You gotta throw your placements to get placed in Copper. Then never touch Ranked again.
---
EZ copper charm
---
they teased all the good stuff and dunked on us with a season 2 release date..... so we got one more season of pain 
---
I was gonna say the same thing, but if that didn’t work, I would have recommended just doing the entire game from that point on
---
But hey
---
this would make the BOSG pretty balanced
---
because its got only 2 shots anyway. If you make the reload time slightly longer, boom a slightly balanced gun
---
HAHAHAHA sorry bruh
---
lol your welcome this confused me a little as well
---
I already do
---
I'm sorry I don't play TH a lot so why is this a big thing?
---
Apparently they are supposed to be in ur ready to install as for some reason aren’t installed automatically this time.
---
Not op but I don’t really like it, I thought I was gonna get it but it’s too bland looking for me, it’s not bad overall just not something I want, guess I’ll save my credits for another elite skin. 
---
I suck at mouse and keyboard, but I always get abused by it when I go on ranked. It sucks
---
Could you imagine if updates just *added* to the space a game takes. Some games would take 1TB of storage by now. 
---
How much? I want a pair
---
it's not hard to use one finger to press multiple buttons...
---
Increased ADS time
---
oh... sorry i didn’t know thought i’d share for the people that like hereford

In other posts people suggested to reinstall the Year 4 pass, but idk how u can do this

Hello InfectedxHD, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ay3nom/i_bought_the_season_oass_about_45_minites_ago_and/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Zofia and lesion are 2 good bets, especially if your looking for 2 speeds
---
Kapkan and tachanka have no gloves
---
Am I the only one who has the wait 5 hours for the download to be finished 
---
Looool it's been so long, I don't even play the game anymore 
---
Those are exactly the ones I have considered! Was lesion not nefred too much?
---
It’s not an elite. Ops with have both Elite, and Legacy sets.
---
bro i used to love kapkan my go to defense op before all the dlc ones first operator i bought with renown was  maestro trying to make defense fun it’s my least favorite part 
---
All the extended barrel does is reduce the damage drop off at long ranges. It's not very useful except on frost's SMG.
---
No it clash is looking at her feet
---
What about with the Ultra HD Texture pack?
---
Why are you getting downvoted
---
Just spend it all on cosmetics for tachanka 
---
So many things happening at once
---
Next time cut out the baby photos
---
And yet, our ops can't jump 
---
When’s the release date?
---
fucking driving wheel controller lol
---
Ahahaha i know why     
---
#SOON #trailee
---
Just like the down with the sickness song, original vs. karaoke version
---
Are all of the operators discounted or just frost? 
---
i don’t care about size i just care about download speed third world country internet is pure and utter garbage and then there’s australia 
---
It was supposed to compress the files so that future updates wouldn’t be as big
---
That is definetley an option.
---
But aren't 3 maps boring? 
---
Thats just your inner ape instinct saying “ay that brightly colored thing is probably poisonous”
---
Nah the only difference is that he now does 4 tick damage instead of 8, it's still 10 when they first hit it anyway plus lesion is going to be used more of an Intel op not damage so it really doesn't make any difference I hope that helps you a bit :)
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 
---
Recruit should never get any cosmetics 
---
Same. Before I was barely able to play a single match as the game would "validate and update playlists" indefinitely. Now I can't even launch it.
---
Sheet.
---
Anyone else not get their R6 credits for buying Year 4 Pass?
---
It’s nothing like it
---
Wait, thats illegal
---
Yeah, thanks!

Blitz is fine as he is. Learn how to counter him

Buy more ubi games.

Clearly this has nothing to do with sensitivity it ads difficulty.
---
It's just Ying and Echo having couples issues.
---
I would recommend Zofia and Valkyrie
---
That was some nice fucking gameplay
---
It was never a problem in the TTS for me only now it is after the update had been released
---
Holding guns in hot weather is a sensation I don’t miss. Let alone doing this in Australia. 
---
Same here
---
same
---
if u dont want to play casual cause it ruins ur playstyle from ranked and having to learn the new map mid match as u try to not lose a placement is annoying 
---
Do more you very good artist!

Three good maps 
---
The two fingers is a british insult which comes from when English bowmen were threatened to have their firing fingers cut off by the French they were fighting, the English won and shown the their two fingers, now days it essentially mean up yours (except 5x ruder) 
---
but both are equally insulting but one is more british than the other  
---
I would love it on Valkyrie but I would definitely abuse it, so no
---
*crys for an hour straight*
---
Wouldn’t ever show their face, especially this one because Rook is in the GIGN.
---
NVM
---
They should be there after a restart
---
who hurt you dawg
---
hmm, that's weird. the sound issue in the TTS is the reason I didn't play. But interesting its only happened to you after the update
---
the hand sign Doki is using is a old version of the middle finger that is really only used in the UK. It dates back to when the English and French were at war in the 17 hundreds or so.
---
my update is 35gb do i have another update after?
---
No more pen scribble sounds in the background when choosing an operator. 
---
Called it
---
here in Australia we don't care about safety. Doesn't bother me
---
Educate yourself kid
---
It's a skill many fail to master. The auto lock
---
Yeah I started in operation skull rain. I thought I saw this on a previous patch notes, just couldn't remember. 
---
I know how to counter him. I'm not here to argue that he's overpowered. I'm simply asking if there was supposed to be a nerf.
---
Read better.
---
Navigate to the game's install directory (not sure if you have the Steam or Uplay installed) and delete the game's executable.  Should be something like "R6.exe".  Then attempt to uninstall, should work properly then.
---
🤢
---
Are you able to get on the servers? I played one game and after that it’s telling me the servers are unavailable. I haven’t seen anyone else reporting server issues so I think it’s just something on my end :(
---
Fuck nah ima pick them every round
---
Cool Table. I thought the prices were going to be broken down based on what year they came out but this works for me.
---
Did that come in a recent patch or was it this one? Don't see it in the notes
---
If you download through steam it's 35.7 GB. At least for our group it was
---
This is big. Even for it being once I will be getting and using this. 
---
seems like it's down can't start uplay
---
Haha wow that's an unfortunate waste of money
---
Can the boosters be bought more than once?
---
At least she actually looks Japanese now. Before she looked like a white chick wearing a kimono. 
---
Lmfao honestly, rip 
---
Oh sick! Looks like I'll be playing sometime next week. 82gb *dear god.*
---
I was honestly really upset when I saw how bad she looked after the update. 
---
BUT THEN I REALIZED I WAS BUYING THE ELITE SKIN AS SOON AS I DOWNLOAD THE UPDATE
---
oh yeah waffle is cool, but never mass produced for 5.45
---
Wow
---
Copper charm is nicer then the plat one smh
---
word bro this guys retarded lmaoo
---
yeah i dislike the magpul hand guard
---
The copper charm is nicer then the plat one lol
---
My internet speed is 1mbps as I'm in the Middle East. Your case is hard? Think again mate lmao
---
Platform?
---
S2
---
Triggered much jeez
---
God I hate how toxic R6 players can be. Not just this vid but like in general it's ridiculous
---
Correct. Good job :)
---
How much did they pay you Ubisoft
---
Literally one of the only good legendary skins
---
You have to sub on twitch then link your account or something like that if you go the streamers channel you want the charm for they probably will have better info on there.
---
Thank you! Was just looking for a solution. 
---
According to leaks we saw what looks like present wrapping on thermites primary and on blitz's shield. It looks like theyre switching up the way they reward us for club challenges this time around. 
---
And all I wanted was a really big fucking hole, either distraction or crossfire.
---
Same here in fullscreen mode.
---
Xbox one. No 600 r6 credits and the Ops say they are locked.
---
Nah they need to fix her face first 
---
These are my favorite Tags. I wish they did this.
---
That’s what she said 👍 
---
look at his turn on the last seconds toward the door, it's perfect. I get your passionate because your worse than he is on keyboard but he's legit.
---
WTF This is literally my favorite headgear ever!
---
If the eyes were darker like the first one then the current would be terrifying. 
---
Yeah it’s a lil over top I’d recommend checking Ubisoft website and twitter for more details hoped this helped
---
My update was 48gb, but two of my friends had 35.7gb. None of us have the ultraHD texture pack thing.
---
f
---
It's just that I don't see anything about the charm when I go to subscribe. Just shows I get the 1 month subscription badge, and some emotes for chat that is all. I have my twitch linked to my ubisoft account all ready to go.
---
Reported for accusations of cheating,exploiting etc without proof.
---
Yep happened to me last night with 22 ping, and there wasn’t a yellow connection sign when it happened. I watched the kill cam and it was exactly like the good ol pubg d sync, peaked and went back behind and dude shot the air where I was before
---
This is so well done it deserves so much more than just my little upvote. But take it anyways
---
I'm just rambling about my personal experience of who uses emojis around me, this most likely won't apply to anyone else cause they're all different
---
&gt;because your worse then he is
---
Ignoring the hard grade grammar mistake, yeah he is. I never said he wasn’t, retard. Maybe instead of trying to be a little smart as you should retake third grade English.
---
Do I have to redownload ultra textures or the game will keep them as it is rn?

Oh btw u can prove. Most ppl that use mk are bad and shake a lot. And this shaking is so minuscule it’s basically impossible to replicate these small shakes on a joystick. I’m this clip look at how small the shakes are and how repetitive they are.

No, but my CPU usage has been outrageous since updating

i forget what potential leak... but early on there was a ladder operator rumored.

So like on king George’s stream he had a command that you can type in and then it will give you a link to the website you need to link your ubi account and your twitch so they can get you the charm. Which charm do you want because the streamer might have a command for that as well.
---
My Siege experience is telling me to shoot them, my Payday 2 experience is telling me not to.
---
If it makes you feel better, the people that do it already suffer from mental retardation.

I have proof so gl with your report.

Shame it isnt happening

Well alright👌 then 🙄 Go ahead🚶 and feel ❤️ superior 😎 to us 👬 plebians

Oh I had no idea. I was going to get Shroud's charm because I am a fan of him, I was going to type in his chat and find out but 1 his chat moves fast as hell and its also in sub only lol big RIP.

Not sure about everyone else but Macyjays charm was only available for like a month or so last year around March-April

Anyone know what the new Ranked Map Rotation is?
---
Wasn't damascus the reward for the Y3 season pass? So it 100% should work on nomad. Obsidian is a gem skin and required no mapping. So there's that. 
---
How many times are you going to repeat that. You're obv as fuck btw 
---
So you more money to get a higher chance for the item you actually wanted cause they would only let you gamble for it and *now* you decide to complain about it? I wouldn't have done it in the first place cause it definitely isn't worth $10
---
This is primarily for PC. To adjust for console, try attachments that reduce horizontal recoil a bit more, and run 1x sights instead of ACOGs on most guns.
---
Nah man that’s the type 89 lol
---
The struggle between saving renown for a new operator or buying attachments
---
Ubi dont ever redesign good characters cause new once suck

So they nerfed bastion?

I'll leave now.

Right? XD

My update has been downloaded twice at 35.7 GBs and then there was a random 57 GB download.

Has one else have this kind of thing happen to them?

And gods save the people on metered connections.

lmao it just looks like she was crying a lot
---
who’s the one that broke her heart
---
i got like 600 club points yeet lmao
---
Policies change
---
Best - Holographic colour.
---
Worst - havent found a worst yet.. 
---
Best : casual changes
---
Worst : Hibana picture and face remodel
---
Yeah
---
Yea I think you could go to George’s stream he’s streaming right now and you can type !charm or something and a link will come up
---

In TH hunt there are entire rooms with C4 that auto explode, and some rooms with so much barbed wire, a snail would outpace you

Kaid asserting his dominance.

It tends to show up late.
---
If something like that happens I like to go and cook something nice, sit down with a nice hot drink, watch some Youtube and relax. By the time you're done a couple hours have passed and you'll have relaxed
---
Yes it's a really niche item for sure
---
Yep, i have been raging about this ever since the TTS was launched. 
---
Ubisoft shouldnt change things that arent broken. 
---
Fuck now i need to start shipping operators. Ok ok.... lion and cav. Make it happen ubi!
---
It's 30ish gb so a while depending on you Wi-Fi. 
---
i buy the all year passes and only ever bought elite skins, pro league skins or seasonal/event skins (halloween) so i never had much use of renown
---
This game can be very rarted sometimes 
---
Absolute midget
---
My update was 82 GB and my install is now 88 GB total. No HD textures. Fantastic.
---
This looks like it could be the cover for a Cav standalone comic 
---
Ahhhh okay. Thats what i wasnt getting. And the r6 site didnt explain it that well either. Thank you!
---
Nice
---
Nah it’s staying up so maybe you can learn how to play 
---
Why do they need to change the faces I don't understand
---
GG wanker
---
I’ve played sledge shotgun in Thunt before Burnt Horizon. It is the pose OP posted. Sledge pose isnt new
---
It's y4
---
Thank you for trying to get this tiny adjustment fixed even though I don’t own the headgear
---
Probably mid season or start of next season 
---
The 3 slots are your buffer, you get one daily mission every day
---
cool opinion bro.
---
Anyone know if and when they will release the year 3 operator bundle? 
---
Was tha badjer? Or maybe Tux? Wait, no, it was jameski.
---
Uh no, both
---
Yeah, i had that turned on, was presented with a 83GB download, probably because of that.
---
Indeed
---
Still need to clear 54GB to download it. As someone who lives somewhere with slow internet speed, re-downloading all the shit I had to delete to clear space for this is gonna suck :/
---
I hope you’re being sarcastic if you’re not then you need to chill. There is no need to be so negative just don’t play her. I hate clash with a passion but you don’t see me cursing her out
---
This looks like a comparison for PS1 and PS5
---
In his bio he did break all the sad speed records 
---
How'd you get multiple flairs
---
So I subbed an hour ago, my account is linked and still no charm...hmmmmm.
---
You have to download the season pass
---
Its just purchasable alone for like 16k or you can get it in a bundle with one of the seasonal skins, Crocodillius I think.
---
When you lose a 1v1 on match point.
---
Like is said it was the first time playing this map. Unlike you I guess who played the TTS so much that you know every inch of the map. Sorry that I have a life and can't master the new map a few hours after it was released. Sincerely copper scum (My highest rank last season was plat 3 btw)
---
It recognizes the shield desync in the patch notes. Read them before you complain. Thx bb
---
Man i would love to have a chance to scoop that skin up
---
LEAVE HIBANA ALONE!!!
---
Ain't that the truth
---
I like both but I think the black matches almost all skins better
---
Won't be corrected this season? What? I'm sorry, it's probably because I don't understand, but how can it take that long to fix this?
---
Its an old clip and it didn’t happen yesterday, you karma whore.
---
That's on you, not Ubisoft.

Its cuz he’s on console lol

They perma banned you for one offense? That doesn’t sound right. I think you’re hiding what you really said.

---
Hello Toxic_OP4, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ay5ozp/mk/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Perma ban means you did more than just say that twice, it means they manually reviewed your account and found enough offences to deem the ban to be permanent.
---
Either one.
---
Just because you missed it doesn't mean it wasn't communicated.
---
Wait. That’s illegal. 
---
I think they said in the first half of year 4 (meaning season 2, it's their way of saying that it's delayed). 
---
thats annoying .
---
No I just needed to put an image
---
They weren't good anyway 
---
Did they give you a warning or something, or did they just do it?
---
I’m sooo sorry I didn’t know. Mr Sledge main us protects his beloved smg 11.
---
No but got elite skin anyway lol :P
---
Doka-BAE

Until then, you should think about tossing some ducats at the people who owned her previously so they can get something less ridiculous to express themselves with.
---
Thanks. Lol i was about to want my 30$ back.

^^^
---
I just bought the charm alone cuz the gun skin really isn’t that appealing to me.

Yeah that’s true, hopefully there will be an option of choosing either one

Burnt

Xmas noob here. How long do we have to wait to buy an operator if we don't have a season pass? Thanks.
---
Ben this this I like
---
1 armors get zero damage resist, 2 armors only take 90% of damage (so they block 10% of damage) and 3 armors only take 80%.  This resistance does not apply to twitch drone zaps and lesion mines, but it does affect kapkan explosions and all bullets.

No cause people shock others just to get higher scores and an assist

I however am on the side that actually likes the change, so fite me.
