Classic Ubi fixing wallbreaches that dramatically change the attack strategy on their new maps.

While I agree with you entirely. They're  just gonna go somewhere else though

Herpa derpa, you're right. XD Well pretend it's biohazard lol.

It's amazing how many people forget you actually have to kill the defuser, even I do if I'm distracted...

What’s that lava skin and how do you get it

I just started playing Siege and it’s pretty fun so far. We got it as a go to game after we burn out from Overwatch and Apex. Comp seems fun can’t wait to learn how everything works

That will just turn of everything just call twitch to find the jammer

I reported this challenge not completing for me like 2 weeks ago when it came out on console but got no response

Did you lose? If so you lose Elo regardless how well you did. 
---
If you won though it's 100% a bug
---
I'm hopeful this will help the problem. Griefing is far worse this season than I've ever seen it before (PS4). I can't seem to find a match solo queuing where my team mates don't grief to intentionally de-rank.
---
I know it's partially my own fault for soloing, however I used to really enjoyed ranked. In its current state it's almost unplayable unless I find 3/4 friends to play with.
---
People in this game are so toxic it’s not even funny
---
Wait, a legendary drop that hasn’t been posted here hundreds of times??? You must be at the wrong sub. 
---
I don’t really, so how is the matchmaking 
---
Oh it does he "ubisoft" -ed you.
---
What do you mean
---
Xbox and playstation have a screen capture please use it. I used to take pictures of my TV also but it kinda make the picture garbage. Ps just trying to help
---
tried both
---
Finally black beard got an actual black beard lol
---
Yeah it’s casual... it’s not based upon rank. Diamonds can be put with coppers in casual, if u want to play against equal skilled people play ranked. This is true for all games, not just r6s
---
Molly’s gonna love this!
---
I fucken love you guys
---
Console platinum probably.
---
Like are the people usually serious about the game, or do they just purposefully fail
---
That would be ridiculously OP
---
More like bronze 
---
Pulled a 1v5 clutch on attack. Next round match point 3-0 our favor our clash was 1v1 an ash. He started teabagging in obj and missing ash on purpose. Ash stepped on a frost mat. He impact naded himself and left for good measure. Rejoined in time for next round. Tkd me and threw another 1v1. We lost that match.

Hop on the R6 Discord and pray that none of the 4 party members you'll find after 30 minutes of waiting suddenly "has to go" or straight up disconnects...

yo why tf is your font all messed up?
---
You hold up the mentality of "just one more minute" until either your mind or body gives out. I can still run about two-three minutes usually.
---
Depends what you play on
---
Ok. Ya I’ve just been thinking it looks really cool, and for sure might be worth getting
---
R6 has one of the least toxic communities i’ve played in. Its just people complain more cause more people with less experience in other gaming communities play this game.
---
Is it only me or the hit reg has also been awful
---
Idk
---
I’m a game off of play 1 on console and I I’d kill to play against someone like. 
---
Like afk or trolling? No not as much, though some people complain about toxic teammates in ranked and smurfs ruining ranked. Tbh it hasn’t been that big a problem for me personally, but then again I’m around high gold - low plat. Smurfs aren’t a problem and normally people care too much  about their rank that high. So yes, it may be a problem at the start with tking for reasons I don’t understand, but no as it gets better
---
I personally prefer Leon furioso, the purple/pink and blue seasonal that came with jackal, but they were all nice skins

Operation health was not a development period to stop DDOSing attacks.
---
Yes they do and it's mildly annoying 
---
We will see what happens with the testing. Definitely message ubisoft about this, this is a good point.
---
Not busty fat
---
Hey OP, this happens because all of them are queuing into your data center from a very far location. In small words they are purposely queuing into wrong servers to screw around with people. As your rank is linked to region, they have nothing to lose when they shift to different data centers and throw games. Quite irritating, of they are in your team though.
---
Same here 
---
&gt;. We will continue to track team kills, and we may issue appropriate sanctions after multiple offenses.
---
I get yall are Canadian but asking nicely for people stop isn't a fucking sanction. have yall ever banned a single person for team killing? they do it in this game because they know they can get away with it because yall have done a single fucking thing about it.
---
I think I'm just gonna start lighting people up to test if you actually have the balls to do anything not like this shit community doesn't deserve it.
---
The thing is I can't find it in the store
---
I love how everyone is discussing a way to circumvent a problem that has been a massive issue since day one. Well done guys, and you wonder why at times Ubi probably throws up their hands and say to themselves "these assholes will look for any way to get around shit" and you all wonder why they take their time to fix shit. 
---
 Ngl if ur silver rn  I doubt I’ll hit plat, no offence but the difference in skill between gold and plat is huge. It’s not just a case of grinding, you have to contribute and top score often to hit plat. I’m not being toxic I’m just saying it’s really hard
---
Are you 100% sure you shot her? 
---
&gt;Intentional team kill?
---
Isn't obvious that everyone will choose "YES"  
---
What's the point of choosing "NO" even if it is not intentional?  
---
They should activate the "Reverse Friendly Fire" at the START(not after the teamkill) 
---
Toxic player will just keep shooting teammates to depletes their HP. 
---
The issue my brother ran into today was team mates shooting at him until his health was super low, but not killing him. 
---
Not sure how to deal with this..
---
I need it.
---
Didn't the update say that gadget damage reverses to the gadget itself. So wouldn't that mean it just kills the charge?
---
ah, didn't know since I have retro steel and code red but no operators past y1

Please comment your platform (pc/ps4/xbox) and your country/server region you normally play on.

I know it's hard and I'm willing to push myself to be better. I wanna stream Siege one day and be proud of my rank so I can feel like I've accomplished something in my worthless life  
---
Nice job! Definitely try ranked more. It's a better siege experience with your friends than casual. The best feeling is knowing that your friends are willing to coordinate with you and it (sometimes) works out well :)
---
Oh thx cause I’ve been playing since chimera and it just seems like some times I body them at three feet away and it doesn’t do anything and others I hit em and it don’t do shit

Thanks

You’re welcome

I recently bought skins for mozzies guns specifically the sponsor racing skin and they’re gone? Please tell me I’m not the only one.

nah i’ve been at work and have a lot of assignments to do, tomorrow night for sure tho

You’re very lucky. PC is of course the best platform and it is the best platform for siege. You won’t run into too much problems because people have mics on PC and actually use them

When you get on use the Newcomer playlist because bomb is the best mode to learn FIRST

Awesome then

Why repost u/sau_siege? They post them all here?

It’s almost impossible for me to play solo without going through getting tked or votekicked .in the beginning (on PS4 year one ) you would only really get tked if you tked someone but since the game has gotten more popular it’s taken in a lot of the old cod toxicity .
---
I'm pretty sure they made this game just to start advertising this cereal all along!
---
He is being sarcastic. This has been posted 5-6 times that I know of. PLUS 2 animated versions. All since the season came out. 
---
Hate this argument. Some people prefer ranked to casual and sometimes the other way around. 
---
Has had enough of what?
---
Where’s the spawn peaking doc
---
Firstly, if im in casual, what really stops me from leaving.
---
Secondly, if i see the team does not understand basic calls and/or does not even speak english, or dosent understand the basic mechanics of the game despite you trying to help them, im leaving and with no questions asked
---
Thirdly, if i die and the rest of the team is hard clutching casual and pushing to the last second of the game, im leaving, im up for some quick fun, not to sit around and watch people sweat casual
---
Its the only reason i dont play ranked.
---
defenders seem awfully peppy when their about to fight for their lives
---
*Siege in a nutshell*
---
Btw that’s mozzie 
---
[removed]
---
honestly, this game is kind of a trap like that. The influencers you see have a great time playing the game because its a nearly toxic free environment because high rank. And first impressions wise, unless its a free weekend you dont often see people of a low skill actively try and be toxic. Then you drop ranks and its all downhill from there. IF you cant stay ABOVE silver this game is unplayable. 
---
I thought the same. What the fuck are me and my owe friend gonna do??? Lmao

If you buy the game on steam it buys the game on uplay, there is no such thing as "steam version" all PC versions are the same, you cant connect to friends using steam, you need to add them on uplay to be able to play with them

The point of ranked is to play people of the same lvl of skill, thats why theres such thing as rank, by queueing with a low rank friend you nullifying the whole point of ranked.
---
I always find health callouts to be useless. As long as they have their gun drawn, they should still be handled as if they're at full health.

They do it in ranked as well

Don't relate this to pewdiepie. It's not fair to blame him for what happened and it's not okay to make that joke.

You can only down 3 teammates in a match in ranked or you get kicked 
---
Y Bc ur salty that people leave in casual lmao
---
Alibi and Maestro are the Y3S2 defenders. She has three portable holograms that trick and ping attackers when shot. He has two mountable bulletproof cameras that fire lasers. 
---
Maverick and Clash are the Y3S3 ops. Mav has a blowtorch that goes through reinforced walls, Clash has a Monty shield that shocks and slows people rushing her.
---
Nomad and Kaid are the Y3S4 ops. Nomad is an attacking trap operator with 3 nonlethal proximity mines that push defenders away. Kaid has Electroclaws that can electrify reinforced walls, hatches, deployable shields, and barbed wire. Kaid has a Shotgun/DMR combo with ACOG available.
---
Mozzie and Gridlock are the Y4S1 ops. Gridlock is a three armor attacker that can deploy spiked traps that slow and damage enemy defenders when walked on. Mozzie is a defender with the ability to override and take control of 3 attacker drones.
---
Personally, I love Alibi and Mozzie, but Maverick is pretty good at surprising enemies. The choice is yours. Good luck!
---
I'm pretty sure you prep it like that so from then on it will take a second to reload like shown at the end of the video.
---
Reverse FF should only work in prep phase and few seconds after that.
---
Nice job stealing art and not giving credit.
---
When I was playing on Xbox I was getting team killed for no reason. All the time. I just left. Apparently this one guy didn't like people without a mic. Even though 2 other people didn't have mics.
---
Tachanka: LOOK AT MY ASS 
---
Too bad newcomer does fair you any better. Siege is 4 years old. Everyone knows how to play by now and are very good in many cases. There will always be good players everywhere regardless of level or game mode. And more often than not; in your case in particular, could be running into 5-stacks warming up for ranked or a scrim or tournament. 
---
OP was the one who chose to go for the interro as well lol

pretty hard to mess up landing a single bullet. Low health callouts are good
---

---
Yea, they are funny.
---

---
The toxicity on console is a problem Ubi NEEDS to fix. If they dont theyll loose a huge chunk of the community in the long run.
---
great it's what's the communities been asking for and I personally will really like it because me and my friends like to screw around in casual a lot and if we TK there's no way to say it was just a joke so I guess we can now use this feature as a way to kind of cover for that
---
How about just let us have custom settings? I'd rather have more freedom to choose my own settings than a pre-made one to be honest.
---
Ik. Just playing around.
---
this sounds great, it keeps that piece of the game intact while combatting the current toxicity. the only thing i’m worried about is toxic players starting to just run into people’s shots so that they can’t be killed in future, but that’s much harder to pull off.
---
Karma. Duh.
---
Bruh that’s gay

Out of all of the comments, this helped the most. I’ve actually picked up Maestro and he is really fun to play. But thanks to you, I’ve realized that as long as I can track someone and make sure they end up dead with Jackal, or make anchors reposition with Fuze, or slow down and gain intel on the attackers with Lesion are what the operators do, not get kills. Thank you for this. Also after I posted this, I went 12 - 3 on Border, probably my best game, so I should just be more confident in myself I guess
---
That seems better than the forced killcam idea. If you dont watch the whole killcam or at least up to the part you get tked then you dont get the option to forgive 
---
This is so true. I play on PC now and I've come across way less toxic people. But I guess it may have just been luck.
---
Im on PC and never have an issue but i mostly play ranked. There has only been one time where i remember being voted out of a casual match.
---
It would make them worthless
---
Doesn't really matter to me as long as they cant pre lean like on PC.  I enjoy clapping MnK users who get exposed cuz they copper level talent. 
---
To all of y’all who are complaining about me not giving credit to the artist, I’m sorry that I did not give him credit, but I could not find who drew it. 
---
True but I just don't play as him because I feel obligated to be using the drone and that just causes me to do bad with him, especially once they start coming into the objective.

---
The standard area of an American Football field is 110m long by 48.8m wide. This gives us an area of 5,368m^2 
---
Since the depth of a football field technically reaches to the bottom of the earth, the height of it could be 6,371km deep, but to make my calculations easier I'm going to cap the depth off at 1m deep.
---
so you get 5,368m^3 worth of dirt. The average weight of a 1m big cube of dirt is accordingly [between 1,200kg and 1,700kg](https://www.reference.com/science/much-cubic-meter-soil-weigh-e48660fa83d913ab) so I'll use 1,450kg as an average. 
---
Multiplying 5,368m^3 worth of dirt with the weight of 1,450kg per cubic metere of dirt, you get 7,783,600kg worth of dirt in the average football field.
---
So maverick is 0.00000874ths of a football field, and Gridlock would be 0.0000131ths of a football field. 
---
Please correct any of my maths if it is wrong.

I’ve never met someone that plays MnK that actually plays the game with intelligence or knows how to properly use advanced strats. They’re all aim and no rain. Most of them are just trash cans who got stuck at Gold IV and had to resort to cheating in order to feel better about themselves.

cav has a low recoil, high damage smg that takes an extended barrel. she also has next to no passive utility so she's only here for kills, which means spawnpeeking as her is probably a better call than spawnpeeking as doc. if she cant make something happen before the attackers reach/start taking site, cav is honestly being wasted.
---
spawnpeek as cav far away from objective. if you whiff the initial burst, run off and let them waste time figuring where you are. you've basically told them, "we're all over the map", so they'll have to focus on flanks until you die and make life easier for your anchors. she can get spotted by drones but her silent step means that you can rotate really quickly all over the map with relative impunity to soundwhores.

Gridlock should eat her vegetables.

If you have 200 ping, picking a 3 speed and running around you are ping abusing. If you have 200 ping, 1 speed and standing still you will be ping abused when someone peeks you. So yes, calling someone a dirty fucking pinger is still true. 
---
No. Just no.
---
Totally agree with u, even if u clarify the reason they just **keep trash talking** (always happen with people with high rank) In the middle in the gunfight anyone could get killed, even worse if u are using an explosive (C4, nade, etc).
---
What? Thunt is better for practicing aim, more gun fights
---
You have to play a lot more offensive though. Holding an angle with high ping will get you killed 9/10 times because you receive the enemy movements after a delay. But if you peak a corner on a stationary target holding it. You definitely have an advantage against them. Because they haven't moved it doesn't matter how long it takes for the data to send and receive. Because they're still sitting there.
---
My opinion is high ping does give an advantage if you play aggressive. 
---
I mean, when the punchline isn't "chanka lord lole eggs deee" they can be fun.
---
This post, kinda funny. 
---
I would highly recommend! Also would say that the Jack Ryan series is one of my top recommended :)
---
Yeah but it’s just too easy even on realistic.
---
Rainbow 7 cheese
---
3v5 (or whatever it is) is more “challenging” so I enjoy it
---
Well they are
---
omg where can i find this
---
Yea because you’re doing it to win, you have to do it to better your aim, go for headshots only, one taps
---
It removes too much of the risk in the risk reward equation, imo
---
Exactly, this will lead to another abuse Meta,for example, if the team has Fuze, the rest of the team wont be killed (if he use the first TK) and Fuze wont take any reflection damage but his gadget instead. This doesnt make sense for me.
---
Why look at different solutions when you can just play casual
---
But will it really help with the level of toxicity in siege? Players can simply not forgive someone even if it was truly an accident. I never solo queue in siege because toxicity is a mess in SEA server. 
---
Because casual isn’t good
---
How captos aim should be 
---
I get what you're saying but I totally disagree. I started playing last summer and from then to the recent patch I've probably died to Cav less than 10 times. Unless she was a foot away or I potatoed hard, I always killed her. Since the new update I've already died to Cav at least 5 times and she actually worries me now. I've been killed by her and didn't even know she was there. Her damage may have been reduced but it doesn't really matter because it still takes the same amount of shots. Now you may say that before the patch you could spam fire and kill them, but now you're able to kill from a longer distance so the RoF doesn't really matter as long as you play smart. I don't mean to be an asshole, but maybe you just aren't good with Cav. People that are good with her seem to like the changes and the only people wishing it'd go back were the people that would rely on as you said, hipfire spam. 
---
You alter the way you play so you ultimately don’t get anything from playing it.
---
Yes it is. for warmup it’s just ok.
---
For the damaged coda-Blonde Redhead
---
They will come when The R6 Devs say that they will come.
---
I have also faced this. The reason was me and my friend got queued with the same team mates in a row. And we were playing quite bad because we have been playing apex for 2 weeks. This was on casual, mind it. 
---
Guys GUYS Fiverooni is cheating and just TKd me 10 times, everyone report him !! ^^^^^/s
---
This is why
---
Oh no, not exactly. My friends use it too and they aren't Toxic. Some I've met use him because they got frustrated from 2 losses or facing hackers and are confused what to do.
---
But it just isn't fun and worth the time anymore.
---
OP: I dunno where to ask so I'll just pick a random sub...
---
It’s perfect 
---
She was OP then she got nerfed a ton. After that though they balanced her a bit (mini buffs).
---
Is Thatcher underpowered? He is a good operator 
---
Try get a squad here... r/R6STeams
---
Yea again, what mini buffs
---
Just let me dieeeee
---
Let's be real, this is all coming straight off of the sponsored Dolan Dark video where he team kills nopeify like 83 times accidentally.
---
Fuck Ela fan art
---
Except you have no proprioception of where your head is in a video game. I understand its realistic but not a good design choice still.

Your right, not "mini-buffs" more balancing kinda things.
---
Debbie downer here,
---
-It’s not difficult to stop shooting once someone is dead
---
-Decently sure the impact was both a distraction and to do some damage 
---
-Not a single player in that room was watching the door he ran through. The IQ was looking god knows where, the Ying was behind the table, and the buck came sprinting in with his pants around his ankles. Just overall poor post-plant positioning on the attacking team’s side.
---
-Hype man is good hype man
---
Sorry, I hate fun. 
---
Yeah it's odd, but like the camera used to be at the very edge of the head, so that was an unfair advantage for those holding angles
---
What are they?!?
---
You are not supposed to bring recruit, noone needs a viable recruit
---
The memes are toxic. Play the game instead of trying to humiliate people and make them angry. 
---
Shotguns don't have a headshot multiplier 
---
I’d say start with Without Remorse by Tom Clancy. Really good read. 
---

It's the next best Doc/Rook skin after the black one with white and gold roses
---
*You're*....
---
Ok thanks
---
&gt;During the kill cam, a team kill victim is able to validate whether they were intentionally team killed. If the player confirms that the kill was intentional, Reverse Friendly Fire will stay active for the offender.
---
well, that was a waste of time. with the way people are in this game the toxicity is going to make this pointless
---
Hahaha... I hate it when I do the `He is like one shot`, but my teammate dies without even shooting him and sees that I lied about his health...
---
Imo the recruit has outlived his usefulness
---
nobody is going to use it, trust me. people act like the toxicity is only on one side, but in this community...
---
This xd
---
Can u give us the Original Link or a link to the full Quallity Picture
---
Think you should multiple by 10 just for playing hostage
---
You could always use it ?
---
I had this options for a while, but I myself ain't colorblind so didn't tinker with the options.
---
Also applying the options will make your game take a hit of performance, but its a small hit.
---
Recruit will never be viable enough because he doesn’t bring something other operators can’t. An extra drone or reinforcement simply won’t cut it
---
Nah
---
And they always using acogs, lol
---
Also kanal and tower

Hello NotAHomicidalRobot, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b39oh8/game_chat_glitch_has_been_happening_for_months/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

Best skin for Jackals weapon is the Ghost Recon Wildlands skin... Discussion ended.
---
I have it, kinda garish in game ngl 
---
Dissagreed, i use recruit plenty of times when i have to do a challenge. Happenes too often that 2 teammates pick both defenders or attackers of a ctu that i have a challenge on.
---
Would love that for April fools, but it would probably be too much work sadly
---
Doesn't work lore wise. Echo uses a wrist communication device unique to him. Even dokkaebi has no access to it. Only way mozzie or anyone else can use Echo's drone after Echo dies is if they rip off the device from Echo's arm

When did you kill a recruit? Did you mean frost?

Wrong, ADS speed is determent by weapon class.

---
Alibi please
---
Sure, I’ll have a go!

Sorry it was mute right after i killed frost

---
Didn’t know that but it makes sense I guess. Still feels like some rifles ads slower then others, maybe it’s just me.
---
Because, as I said, the Season is broken as f*** 
---
Also, the boosters were planned and advertised with a Ubisoft Club Update. Long before the season, so they are infact not related to the new season. 
---
Dont try it now, i have seen a guy getting banned doing that. He got to around -40k points when he got removed for teamkilling, eventough the hostage wasnt dead.
---
When someone says hes like one shot and I play to shoot him literally once prefiring, AND HE LIVES COZ HE LIED.
---
that person dies next round from literally one shot.
---
Send me a pm when you're done. This year I want to build an alibi themed bike. Would like to put this on it as a sticker if you're ok with it. Credit would go to you of course.

At least they’re still trying to fix it, they just released a patch that fixed some shit, they could’ve just given up and just release money shit

That’s really cool! I don’t mind you using my work, just don’t use it for commercial purposes, and please do credit it!

This is a perfect revenge. They did you wrong. I don't think is is super toxic
---
vro you would be more then fit you would be a new all might by your 4th game on this kind of regiment 
---
I was bouncing between 20 and 400 the other day because my internet was acting up, i even got kicked from a match for bad connection
---
Awe, True to Caesar.
---
It's for me and I'm not in bike business or sth else where I could use it for advertising. Thank you very much!
---
This guy is threatening to boot me off line I meant 
---
Yeah that’s shadows, get rid of em. Or lower them.
---
Its a shitty charm anyway...
---
No problem dude! I’ll see how fast I can get it done! Would you like me to texture it with a picture of Operation Para Bellum?
---
Try communicating. If you pick Thatcher and see no hard breachers have been picked change your pick? 
---
I'm level 137 and my reaction time is still 250ms
---
What's it in a fraction.
---
Sounds good, yes. Do not stress yourself first I have to finish another one. I just had the idea this week and didn't want to miss the opportunity :P
---
IF their TKs were uncalled for, I would be ok with getting them kicked.
---
On the other hand if you would, I don't know, reinforce next to a mira window while all of them are shouting at you not to, I would blame you for everything that follows.
---
My friend plays death metal in the background while playing pulse. Who needs sound intel when you have wallhacks right?

Oh yea, PC EU Server
---
Brawlhalla if your in to that kinda game
---
Absolutely not! These trolls need to learn a lesson or just get what they deserve. 
---
I had that happen to me a ton and at first I thought maybe it was because they wanted to skip placement games but as soon as I start playing after placement the same keeps happening. 
---
I actually think R6S community is one of the worse on console so toxic but that's probably because you can team kill the other games I play you can't team kill so maybe I'm being a bit unfair idk.
---
Then this shouldnt be a problem 
---
The panic is just hilarous xD
---
maining is a pointless and damaging concept- play ops who you are comfortable with and who are advantageous for the site you are picking

More of a problem with 3 speed I can crouch walk into site with Maverick or IQ and do the same shit I do with Ash.
---
NOW GIVE ME YOUR HAT MAGGOT. THIS IS WAR NOT TEA TIME WITH YOUR EDIBLE LIFE SUPPORT!
---
I am using Unity, you have to be a pretty big studio to actualy make your own engine that will be usable for anything.   
---
OOP is my jam, I have no problems with it, really. Ofcouse I sometimes have problems while solving something, but that is what programming is about. I like OOP and I find it very easy to pick up on, ofcouse sometimes its better to do something functionaly but that is usualy not a problem even with OOP, you just make an object as a wrapper and make the functions call each other in that object.   
---
I am very bad at doing graphics, I have very little experience with it. I am more of a programmer, less of a designer. 
---
I hate python because of the block indentation, I have never really picked up on it. I could, if I wanted to. Its an easy language to pick up, I just dont like it.   
---
C++... oh boi. Its the most complex language to master, frustration often jumps from everywhere. Mostly, I dislike how crude the expection system is. Its very hard to debug anything big, you really need to debug very small parts individualy or you will never find the problem. The thing with C++ is, if you want to shoot yourself in the head, it will let you. Pointers and so on, thinking about references and destroying objects... It is very hard to make something correctly.   
---
What I dislike the most, though, are iterators. I find them hard to use and clunky, another useless barrier between me and using my data structure. The bad thing is, though, you cannot really not use them. As many std functions want iterators as their arguments. I would just prefer to use indexing instead, but what can you do.   
---
What I like to use the most is C#. Its very easy to use. Ofcourse, it will never come close to the freedom of C++ and the performance of C++, but very often, you would like your program to run correctly rather than fast and you would like to write unoptimal code faster rather than optimized and optimal code but slow.   
---
Every tool has its use, C# is for something, C++ for something else and a good programmer knows that.   
---
If you want to pick up programming, go to a university and study there. Its so complex that I truly believe that just studying by yourself will probably make you a bad programmer in the end. Feedback is very important and experienced people can look at your code from whole another angle and point out things you would never have thought of.   
---
Give them a break, before this season it was better to revive then stim them. Now it's better to stim pistol someone but people need to adjust 
---
Hence another reason why voice communication is key.
---
This isn't bad. This is smart.
---
It’s not just Ash that is silent all 3 speeds are 
---
I bought a radio pouch and 2 single pistol mag pouches en put them on the radio pouch 😁
---
not on Reddit, no
---
Worst idea. Please try again.
---
Before the change it was better to revive then stim, people have to get used to the new change
---
First her hit box is the same as other 3 speeds and she isn’t faster than other 3 speeds lol
---
Its close to carrera now.
---
Kapkan crunch is better
---
I always do, cuz I'm a friendly doc 
---
Go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/R6STeams/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) to find people to play with
---
But Ash still reaps the benefits of this. And as ash is picked so much more than any other 3 speed, the problem is extremely exaggerated.
---

Bro, same... lvl 166 on my main, not a single black ice. Lvl 115 on my second and recently got black ice for glaz. It’s so unfair. 
---
&gt;No they’re not, jackals AR has an smg ADS.
---
Fixed. Rogue 9 tested it.
---
&gt;And Kaids SMG has a AR ADS. Ubisoft decides what they are.
---
Also fixed.
---
Only the commando 9, despite firing 9mm, has AR ads time, probably for balance given how good the gun is.
---
Champion
---
Nice wallhax
---
Not wallhx just using twitch gibes you wallhax
---
what green 
---
Not Bartlett U tho
---
Yes I agree! But do you think there are any other ops that need a fressssh look to there icons?
---
So what you're saying is that there should be greater rewards/sense of reward for synergizing with your team? Also, man, that's a nice explanation! Eye-opening.
---
That makes sense coming from a Hibana Main, I wish more people were like you, normally I have to go Thermite or Thatcher because no one else will, thank you on behalf of the community!
---
Ubi i don't need friends for that my Toxicity will be enough to do it by myself 
---
Yes, but Black Ice is not that hard to get tough as said i got 6-7 of them, prop more like atleast 1 for every third OP and i have around 390 hours on the game, soo it does not seem like such a big deal
---
I just put  owo everywhere

In the case of gridlock a body fat percentage would be a more accurate way of seeing if somebody is fit. Do you think that body builders have low bmi? They don’t because they are primarily comprised of dense muscle. There are different kinds of fitness. Take me for example, I swim and have a bmi of about 20.1. This does bot mean I’m in peak condition because, although I do not weigh very much and I have muscle, that does not mean that I do not have fat. Somebody with the same bmi could have more muscle than me and less fat. 
---
Also since when is this about fat pride? I don’t remember the devs saying anything about all that SJW shit. Send me a link if I’m wrong and this is about fat pride. 
---
It's always about luck. Don't assume it's easy to get it cause you got them earlier.
---
Heck. I've seen people who've played almost thousands of hours with not a single black ice while first few hour players get lucky and roll a Black Ice.
---
So basically you're moaning because you're shit ?

There's always that one Ash

Literally no one said that

The possible movements are the same yes. There is an unfair accuracy advantage using mnk, and it’s pretty obvious. 
---
Here’s a video talking about the issue. 
---
[MnK on Console](https://youtu.be/rRIYhAnI6RA) 
---
I know our new strategy: team mate TK’s to activate reverse damage, then when we get defuse down or are securing area or just pushing into objective room we 4 man rush while he fuzes the room. So many possibilities with this to be abused. 
---
Ubisoft, stop screwing around and just enable punish or forgive!!!  Someone TK’s you, you get the option to punish or forgive them, if you pick punish, the next time they TK anyone else, that person gets the same option.  If they pick punish the offending player is kicked and banned. There are too many occurrences of accidental friendly fire or even just your friends screwing around. Your guys’ “fix” is just another way for people to exploit the system.

---
As an Italian I'm offended by your statement
---
Theres plenty of YouTube content to watch like "best tips for beginners" or "why you are attacking wrong" videos. Best thing to do to get better is play a lot to learn maps, watch kill cams to learn how ppl are killing you, and maybe watch the said YouTube content. Recommended channels for siege are "get flanked" and "matimio"
---
Operators are not that hard to learn imo, map knowledge is important to have, also aim for the head.
---
There are basics like what wall types are there an how sound works but other than that, I just watched Siege videos from big youtubers, streamers or 'proleague tips &amp; tricks' videos.
---
TBH that is probly me
---
I’d like to see you take the time to do this then

Great artwork but alibi's complexion is way off she is libyan not european.

---
I kind of thought the same thing about improvements over time with patches, but I've been experiencing this since I built the pc in January of 2018. R6 has seen a lot of patches in that time, and yet the game just refuses to play well with any overclock to this date. (my drivers &amp; bios are always updated the day those release too). My ram OC'd to 3200 is about the only thing I get away with.
---
I also realize that with the newer hardware these days, R6 gets more than enough frames. I just hat the fact that any time I want to play R6, I have to go into bios &amp; load a softer profile, &amp; run my 1070ti @ stock (which defeats the purpose of owning a 1070ti because @ stick, its just a 1070).
---
Thanks for sharing your experience. at least now I have *something* I can reference to try &amp; figure this out with.

Laser cut, not laser print

Map knowledge, aiming at head level and to be unpredictable to your enemies. Be quiet, don’t make too much noise.

Take it from a Platinum 1 player who joined in Operation Red Crow, Y2S1.

What matchmaking?
---
That's it???????
---
I think you misread.  
---
What we're saying is that if you accidentally TK someone, mind you it's a complete and total accident, and that person doesn't forgive you just to be a troll.  Now you have to play exceptionally careful so that you don't self injure yourself or destroy your own gadgets.
---
When had that person just hit forgive, because it was an obvious accident then accidentally hitting a teammate wouldn't be that big of a deal.
---
Imagine if I accidentally TK someone, they decide to troll me by not hitting forgive.  The next round a teammate is about to get interrogated by Cav so I try to shoot her to stop it, unfortunately I miss and hit my already downed teammate in the foot, which kills me instantly, Cav gets the interrogation which is another death and the other three players on my team are marked.  When, had he just hit the forgive the first time we wouldn't be in that position.
---
Looks like they're straight from a Mountain Dew ad campaign

Can we get an F in chat?
---
Its a hit or miss IMO. I used to play quite a bit and only climbed to silver a while ago. I only got back into Siege recently(forgot how fun it was) and first game of casual was...a little unexpected.
---
Sometimes it can take a bit for me to load into the match. And everyone makes a big deal spamming “SSD” in the chat. And since i haven’t played in a while it takes time to adjust to the gameplay and ill make a mistake which just sends my team into an outrage. 
---
My point is that even in casual, the game(or rather the community) is competitive.  Honestly any community will be toxic. Coming from a League of Legends/COD background you learn to deal with toxicity after a while. The important thing is to not let it go to your head. 
---
Worse here in India IMO but yea siege is Bella toxic to the point I avoid text chat and usually voice chat as well. Thankfully due to the slow pace of the game it is possible to win if you play smart esp at the lower elos
---
Holy shit now it's really time to stop with these 0 effort fucking "edits" reEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

---
that's beyond greatness
---
Sadly my friend, coming from a level 308 Platinum 1 player, the community is very toxic right now. This isn’t an exception. But keep playing the game! Play the newcomer playlist. Play custom games! You’ll get better.

Oh no argument that toxic players will be found on every console, however I am finding it that PC is more welcoming and nice over console. Like when you find a nice person on console its a fucking shock being honest. PC just has a nicely knitted community Im finding

They also did it because it wasn’t realistic. The thought of “lemme shoot your toes then pat your back and your healthier” just wasn’t realistic.

we don’t want people to pick recruit, therefore we don’t want him to be viable. Yes, currently people pick twitch and ash primarily for their gun over the gadget, but I don’t want teammates picking recruit just so they can have the f2 and the super shorty, that’s just stupid. at least ash can breach soft walls, clear barbed etc, and twitch’s drone can be invaluable
---
This happened to me every time I tried to play ranked on console last season (I don’t play ranked anymore)
---
Finaly a meta i can get behind. Who needs gadgets and attachments when 5 bullets or a knife is all you need.
---
I have 2000 hours of gameplay and i agree
---
Oh damn, I've just killed a Maverick main.
---
And there's nothing wrong with Maverick, I favor him myself (when I'm not busy playing Thermite for the team). I just remembered the "X main, big brain" formula. And since I play Maverick myself, I know you really have to play smart to get maximum value out of his gadget. 
---
We made a nest of barbed wire in the obj room and just threw down 5 deplorable shields and camped 
---
And what's wrong with not being Dokkaebi? 
---
so... it’s a skill thing?

you cant move the joystick faster, but the mouse is as fast as your hands

F for Doc

But theres no way im cheating, i didt nothing lol if u see a replay of my rounds it would prove it

Yes sir next season pick and ban is coming also Kafe rework

I didn't see it on front page so I assume it was unknown, but going back a few pages, I've noticed others have reported it too. My apologies.

i lived through this once. It was beautiful.

That isn't an excuse and you should know that, almost every damn game has this. Ubisoft is just too lazy of a company.
---
Wait really? I’m not home so can anyone confirm? I need my Maverick and Kaid pro league sets. 
---
That is lucky I've only had docs toxicness in my playthroughs, till i start to main doc as my defense operator
---
yeah if you see the SAS as flat grey, you're colourblind
---
I initially started saying "lol" or "lel" to annoy some friends but i ended up adapting it as a general expression of being surprised or hearing/seeing something funny. But only if im talking to people of my age and not in serious matters and especially not in job interviews.
---
i’m just excited for the new ranked UI and the teamkillig rework.
---
How do I activate this?
---
You’re not Dokkaebi that’s what’s wrong
---
probably a PC silver 
---
Yeah Ubi has been randomly demolishing tgeur servers but some people (like me) aren't getting kicked out of the game but lagging REAL bad.
---
im pretty toxic as doc not gonna lie, if i down an enemy ill usually stim him back up and knife him on his way up

Props to you for beating them on a round at all given what you had to play through.

I started playing on the computer then something around Thanksgiving I got the game for Xbox One. And have been playing ever since.

The only time I have experienced something like this was on EU servers, this barely happens even in ranked on NA

Even better

It's actually the worst part of playing on counsel. There's just nothing you can do.

You can link your accounts, but I don’t think anything you have on console will transfer

Source: I have the same ubi club account (same completed challenges when I hadn’t played pc in a month) on xbox and pc, but I have exactly 4 non-base ops on pc and basically all of them on console
---
put a pancake on the mag, and an acog on his DP-28
---
It wouldnt match any uniform tho, unless im the only one who thinks like that
---
I’m of the bad opinion that r6 should just go FTP 
---
Adding a rotating free units 
---
Would be something that has to come with it 
---
And having FTP players start with 0 ops makes it work 
---
Wooosh
---
id rather feel uncomfortable and live  
---
Wait does that really work i never tried it before i have only been keeping the stims for myself to spite the teammates that shoot me at the beginning or try that group nitro cell team kill thing
---
Sure my name is the same on uplay
---
His DMR works fairly well with his gadget if you sneak in a tight peak and have to do a lot of damage with just a few shots
---
i’m talking about starting 
---
yeah, you can heal and revive enemies with the stim pistol
---
It’s casual it’s not important 
---
You have to win a game lol. Get a better squad?
---
38 kills an hour. Are you on crack when you play? Jesus hahah 
---
You need to have a squad. As in 4 other friends to be in the same squad, if that makes sense.
---
lost by greed, well played.
---
I have 4700 hrs and I fully agree.. 
---
Spend $20 on an Elite or Season Pass. Buy the ops using Renown.
---
Looking at the 2 non plat members in this match, the only one that seems smurf to me is the one on your team, who has been plat or diamond every season except this one. Whereas the other guy's highest rank has been Gold 2.
---
I do think there is an issue with ranked, but this ain't it.
---
Oh aighr, been playing since operation health  
---
Add me on uplay, I can help teach you some of siege, I've got around 400 hours. Uplay:Imagine Laggin
---

---
Level is indicator of time played, ranked is indicator of Wins vs Losses. It really is as simple as that. A player can be as good as Pengu or Fabian, &amp; still have more losses than wins, which would give them low ranks. The ranked system in Siege will ***never*** be an indicator of Skill, **unless** they make ranked for 5 stacks only (which will never happen).
---
The shotgun is overpowered it doesn’t need an ACOG at all

Yes we are.

Same. He’s picked a lot already but for all the wrong reasons. He is basically a glorified recruit 
---
Save all your renown in the season and you'll have enough, it sucks trying to catch up I've been playing since release so I make like 75k renown a season and buy them when they come out. Except I got the season pass last year, I have all ops but some of them I don't touch

Who cares when you can use the M4 instead?

It’s because they have to have a animated short film on the home screen in every season.

I agree, I think operators have gotten too complicated. The og ops all have a simple ability. The new ones all have weird abilities that you have to explain to people instead of just saying like "thermite blows stuff up."

Explodes into 5 smaller 100 pound 8balls, kills through unbreakable surfaces, reveals positions and concusses the whole map, Gu mine effect on attackers, and kills the hostage, blames it on the defending team. Makes a mean pot of tea

No. You came into a post just to say "he's only plat 3" to try to make yourself sound better and downplay the video. Now you're trying to play it off as a joke. That just SCREAMS insecurity.
---
*That's* pathetic.
---
What does that say in freedom words?
---
Yeah it is interesting that these new operator's icons don't really represent their abilities like everyone else's.
---
Why
---
I have always played casual since I got this game at the end of Operation Chimera and up until Wind Bastion have never played ranked. When I decided to play it with my friends it honestly was much more fun than casual. It felt like people sweat way too much when it came to casual and by going to ranked it was more balanced in terms of skill which made it fair. On top of that toxicity was almost non existent in ranked. I was getting spawn killed more in casual and the enemy team was less likely to TK each other. 
---
Plus in ranked I don’t have to deal with shitty maps like Kanal, Favela, and House.

So for the last charm that had this requirement I got into a group of 5 and won one match, but the progress was stuck at 1/20 for that one. Did that get fixed?

I call him Mozy just to annoy a friend, but it's okay because he is horrible at pronouncing anything in any language.

I also have to add, don't look just at stats. There can be extremely good players with low kd's and win/lossses. It doesn't seem to make sense on the surface, but mathematically speaking everyone's kd will average to 1, so if you have a high kd, someone else will have to have a low kd to compensate, and if the ranking system matches you up with people your rank, this is true individually for every rank. Meaning for all the people in diamond with kd's like 1.4 or 1.7, there's also people in diamond with 0.6 kds and 0.8 kd's. Given what you said about getting better and callouts, I'm sure you fall into the category of a great player who's stats don't fully reflect their ability,

I'm pretty disappointed with the Lion rework. Mainly because they just messed around with his shitty ability to nerf it. I always thought rework meant they'd scrap the dumbass drone and give him a more interesting gadget, like sonar grenades or something.

I always wondered why I get scanned even with ERC-7 turned on. Now everything is on its' place.

Mute, is that you?

He was joking about not having friends

Hell yeah bro scorch is the best

This would be amazing

I don't think Vigil needed a buff, I think they added it as "fanservice" which is a bullshit decision but honestly I'd take this version of Lion over the current one anyday.
---
He doesn't track you in real time with outlines anymore, that was one of the biggest issues with him.
---
And as I said there's room for improvement so they might nerf him even further if the data they gather tells them it's too strong

If you dont know who its from DONT upload it to reddit claming its yours. Or just ask your brother.
---
That’s fine and all but we already have operators that do the basic tasks. That’s what the vanilla ops are. I guess we could have some more operators with lethal purposes, but we really don’t need more hard breachers. And with Buck, Ash, Sledge, Maverick, and half of an attack roster with breaching charges, how many different ways do you want to breach a soft surface? 
---
They add straight forward ops like Gridlock and everyone’s like “her gadget sucks it’s ma’am haha” and then make posts like this complaining about gadgets that involve electronics. 
---
might just be because it's the beginning of the season. I'm level 150 gold and when I played with my girlfriend and friend (level 30ish and 50ish, both unranked) in the second half of last season it was fine. tried playing this season though and it was sweaty as hell
---
Emblems should have been flipped upside down
---
sometimes you just gotta reinforce walls 
---
The only thing I don’t like about Mozzie’s gadget is you need to hit dead center to destroy it. I’ve hit just off center or on the legs and it’s a miss. 
---
The most satisfying thing, i have ever seen.
---
Thanks for the offer and the vote of confidence dude. Im interested to take up your offer :)
---
Just delete lion from the fucking game stupid fucking operator 
---
It's a personal thing i don't like to betray my teammates by giving their positions...
---
That's true.
---
But it works both ways. You can punish this who kill you as well.
---
Intentionally, that is.
---
The world is well... fucked. In every sense of the word. Politics is a mess that no one can even come close to compromising on (at least in US), the internet is mostly composed of angry people raging about stuff, and with all online communities there are the people who just want to watch the world burn. I've turned one troll into an almost friend but it's barely worth it. It's their outlet for all the shit in thier lives. Just get involved in the positive community and man it's fun. 
---
As far as the need to do good, yeah that's also hitting me a bit, and friends will help loads because consistent friends like you for you. They want you to get better but wont hate you if you fail. The best thing you can do is learn. As long as you intend to improve you will. Honestly you sound like one hell of a player if you solo queued your way to gold, and not to be racist but asians are freaky better at most if not all videogames (could be wrong), so if that's on Asian servers damn dude. If this is your first fps even more so. Also aimlab is free on steam and is awesome. The discord is hella supportive and informative. Helped my aim by like 200% in a week. Staying calm is hard dude. Adrenalin kicks in and it's hard to focus. A friend to talk to makes a world of difference. The outgoing people on the internet are usually really chill and friendly dudes. If they make the effort to reach out, they're prolly chill.
---
Also you are something like 14 hours ahead of my timezone so depending when you play I might still be on cause I become nocturnal on the weekends. Plus you have gotten a mostly positive response on reddit. A good sign.
---
 
---
Yeah there are some sound glitches right now. Turn on night mode, which makes gunshots and explosions quieter while footsteps and other sounds stay the same making them easier to hear. Should get fixed sometime soon. 
---
For attackers the best advantage they can get is by opening as many sight lines everywhere. They can just peek from long distances with acogs. So rebarricading a window will only give you a disadvantage. And for flanks you can always put someone to watch your back or claymores or nomad or so.
---
I have approximately 3 kids in this game and I agree

Great.

---
100%
---
I’m so confused lol
---
I definitely agree with your reasoning. But lesions a 2 speed, Kapkan’s a 2 speed, Frost is a 2 speed, valk is a 2 speed, and ela is a 3 speed. So there’s no rhyme or reason to operators gadgets (except cav, montagne, and rook and doc) and their speed/armor. I feel like Ubisoft just randomly picks speeeds half the time for operators and when they don’t know what they should pick the jus take 3 speeds. Which definitely have a huge advantage in just about every category: knifing, strafing, peaking, rotating, gadget usefulness(ex. Hibana compared to thermite, bandit compared to mute most of the time), and especially weapons(jager, hibana, ela (atleast pre nerf), ash, pulse)

There is no trade system in Seige, and any place that is selling the pass cheaper is either a scam, or is abusing exchange rates to undercut Ubisoft.

No. I just play games with a 5 stack and they... well let’s just say they aren’t pro league ready yet. So... I have to clutch up a lot, which is how I get mostly 4ks and aces. I average 1 ace every 2-3 games.

Definitely disappointing and imo a slap in the face to the people who have been around since day 1. I understand they are trying to get people to buy the new editions of the game, but that doesn't make since for the people who already own it.
---
I unfortunately had to step away from the game during year 3 due to college and what not, so I was hoping there would be an affordable way to get the operators I missed. It costs 4,104 R6 credits to get all year 3 operators right now. That's a minimum $35 microtransaction to obtain all of them, which is ridiculous.
---
Here's to hoping Ubi realizes a decent part of the playerbase would be willing to purchase a year 3 op bundle...
---
People that leave rank need to be drawn and quartered

---
not a fan of this despite my hatred for lion. one op shouldn’t negate another imo- with every other ‘hard’ counter there’s counterplay (thermite can go round, shoot a bandit battery and go back and open the wall etc). This is literally just ‘fuck you Im vigil’ 
---
Should be new loading animation 🤷‍♂️
---
Foockin lazer sights
---
You got what you deserved
---
Couldn't it be argued that the lower ranked players that pick him and don't utilize him properly are dragging the win rate down though? Afaik he gets much stronger as the players in the match on both sides get better due to how much more consistent people hold positions and how much more important droning is.
---
I could be totally wrong though.
---
Yo I wish these were in the actual game tbh. I love Frost's especially. (May be biased as I am Canadian)
---
I know that, but I'm talking about now

Nah, it's perfect as it is.

Speaking of charging through walls, they should totally have Montagne do that when fully extended. Just make it something only able to be done at barricades so that he still can't melee people with it.

Better than the pink shit. Pink is just so out of place, it's horrible.
---
Yes, this should happen. All these people down voting are just way too stupid to understand the frustration of being solo with a 4 stack in your team. The moment you fuck up ever so slightly, every single bad thing happening in the game is on you and you instantly have +4 reports. And they be acting as if you wanted to remove 4 stacks entirely, refusing to read the "in ranked" part. Ranked is supposed to be fair, if you want an unfair environment, bring it over to casual and have your fun there.

Straight to the head!
---
he could have been global in outbreak and not in pvp though, don’t think anyone would have complained about that. 
---
lion rework is retarded, hes useless now. instead of actually 'reworking' him, they nerfed his ability to be pretty much useless
---
nice work
---
Agree
---
OP above said all maps should be in casual rotation. Someone responded not Bartlett.  I said yes even Bartlett should be in rotation
---
Sure, let's make Alibi worthless by making her holos detectable. 
---
It’s just photoshop right now. I want to get them made but the minimum order is like 200 :|

Username Checks Out

Maestro and Finka without doubt. An attacking healer is always needed, and maestro is just and all around good op

I got you fam
---
Jager is definitely a favourite
---
Bro I specifically said that i saw yours and i liked it. And i thought it looked nice so i went to the Ubisoft page and looked at ela for a reference pic but I wasnt tryna copy bro.
---
Whst's that weapon skin? 
---
I get a saints row vibe from that
---
That’s why i just say the room/rooms which contain our goal that as a team we must accomplish over the team that was selected to oppose us  for the duration of the round that we are currently in.
---
It’s faster trust me
---
Why not :D
---
Same
---
Ja. Just thought it was a funny reference.
---
Their logo should be like that when it's the operator's birthday.
---
Yes definitely. 
---
I bought the robi, shotgun and the saw ones just because I got sick and tired of having the volcano skin on all of them
---
Solid. 
---
Thank you.

On the right hand side under create post, open the community options drop down and there should be a user flair preview option

Only took 10 months for them to do it. 
---
I'm on the Xbox unfortunately. Is it possible to just uninstall the season pass? 
---
If that’s the case then why do pros use the mp5 over the p90?
---
Not many know this but the reason Fuze hates the hostage is because they got the last bag of semechki.
---
You can try uninstalling and reinstalling it. It happened to me in year 3 it usually fixed though if I fully quit out of the game then re launched it 
---
Xbox 😔

I got asked if I am donut once 😂

Unpopular opinion: Theme park is a good and balanced map, you just have to learn it first

The only problem is that using people as shields is a war crime so doubt ubi would add it

otherwise looks great

It workes great in LoL, so why not try, eh?

yes i agreeeee

Not a single kill with the DMR, lol. Dual-primary-Dokkaebi
---
Sure, just don't be the guy who never has any boost left when needed. Always save at least 1 for when teammates go down.
---
People who do the little damage shit are so annoying either go full cunt tk and get banned or quit being a dick, we don’t really see why he’s mad and even if he was being a dick why feel the need to agitate him.
---
I'll do my best
---
Are you ok?

Were talking cosmetics not attatchments....

I know I would ask immediately

I loved this Titanfall trend and I'm excited to see the results of the migration.
---
Imagaine interrogating a cav feelsgoodman
---
Thanks :)
---
Alright, I will take that into consideration 
---
Oh most definitely.
---
Yes
---
These are awesome mate
---
Seriously? Mozzie can hack drones, gridlock throws spiky stuff on the floor, Clash has an electrocution shield, maverick can blowtorch through reinforced walls, doesn't sound that complicated to me.
---
You did good with valkyrie imo 
---
Maybe I've kick-started this trend on this sub :) I loved these memes on r/Titanfall a lot so I hope other people will do this here
---
my pnly complaint is if you hadn't made the colors overlap on maestros and just had the helmet as the white stripe
---
Bruh maestro is so outer space thicc he has his own gravitational pull
---
I'd also love a trading system, that way you can have the option to scrap a duplicate or trade/sell
---
the game itself doesnt give you much of a chance to do it unless you get to casualy know those people and invites are sent one way or the other , i stack up with randoms a lot of the time as i mainly solo qeue, i could have 500 friends from the invites i received since i started playing , but what for if i dont know this people from anywhere?  for that i prefer to qeue solo and meet a lot of different people not getting stuck with a bunch  that could potentialy have to carry me all the time or vice versa.
---
5 stacks are fun with friends , with randoms it can be too but its not as easy to get a good connection between 5 players like that.
---
Sweet! I just found one in KC. Production just became a reality. Thanks for the insight. 
---
13th season\*
---
It's really a good idea. Just keep it to maybe 1 or 2 ops that are free for a week or month.
---
I don't see how that works as it doesn't exist, but USSR existed for many yeaes.
---
Echo now has 2 drones. Since ela we have had around 10 or 12 new ops added. Rook hasnt had any changes from what i remember other than the mp5 getting a slight damage nerf. We have like 3 new maps and hereford got entirly overhauled. Ranked you now need 2 factor authentication and lvl 30 and soon will have pick and ban from pro league in it
---
The reason I'd love this is my friend constantly gets black ice and many times duplicates, and I get a lot of skins he wants, but we cant trade
---
In a way it feels like a sense of "Tradition" is being taken and the Devs need to focus on the Fun not make it "Safe" (taking action on toxic) Environment? Is what im concluding from you. Correct me if im missing the point
---
Thanks Too!
---
I'll see what it can do. If it doesn't solve it ill check in with you.
---
I see what you mean. Pretty good idea. Might edit it soon
---
Got Nades, global one click health boost gadget, access to an 'ok' AR, decent LMG and the games best shotty. Yeah, she is worth using. 
---
Give me merica thermite or you're a dirty communist
---
He definitely is. I have everything you'd need for him in my garage right now
---
Finka is the person who coordinates the rush. You use it when your teammates start the push to objective it is used
---
I prefer ranked over casual. Longer games, shorter rounds, and I generally don't care if we lose. I try, tryo to enjoy myself. 
---
Doing that would then ruin the experience of the friends they try to queue with that aren't as good, as they'd just die constantly.
---
two seconds
---
Okay I'm just confused because on their website it says test server update just wasnt sure if it meant the full changes that were made in the test server were in the new update patch
---
[Screams in panic in french]
---
Calm down there bucko, the m870 is a better meme cannon then the sausage 
---
Yet true
---
I like
---
this looks so good!
---
They changed them to reflect the personalities of the Operators as opposed to the gadgets, because each one needs to be unique. I agree that they could have made Mozzie's a spider-like creature, but then that would mean making Gridlock's a web, and Jäger already has that. It also means that if they make similar gadgets in the future (because there *will* be overlap at some point), the icons would be near-identical for all of them.
---
Personally, I like the way they're going. Mozzie is a daredevil and so his icon, with the helmet and pointed tail, shows that off. Gridlock's is a piston, because she's a gearhead and is always tinkering with something. The only two I'm not 100% sure on are Ela's and Zofia's.
---
UMP45 still doesn’t have an ACOG does it? :( 
---
Sledge please 
---
Yea I forced quit the game twice and still having same issues. It says I'm VIP next to my gamertag and whenever I'm in the shop I get the discounts so I'm assuming I'm not completely insane and have for sure purchased year 4. Thanks man. 
---
It still boggles my mind people still use the SMG-12, I mean it’s a P.O.S. fun with horrible recoil, I use the Cz.75 because of its ease of use and low recoil
---
They wont give acpgs to anyone faster than a 3 armour
---
-Ash lost Acog
---
-IQ Lost nades
---
-Echo got another Yokai and the whole team can see them
---
-Ela got nerfed to Oblivion
---
-Lion is getting reworked for next patch
---
-Glaz is getting reworked soon
---
-Mute got smg-11
---
-all secondary machine pistols got nerfed to Oblivion
---
-Hibana needs to hit 4 pellets on hatch to destroy
---
I made the game and I agree
---
Sure, I'll do him as soon as possible
---
This is so good
---
frost an maestro are pretty metal imo
---
Ppl change colors of pictures and get thousands of upvotes lol. Gotta love this subreddit.
---
Meme cannon, yes. Weapon, no
---
I respect you, I'm guilty of sometimes going down ranks just so I can chill and have a good time, I dont throw or anything, I just have fun.
---
If you like acogs try maestro out. He has a gadget simalerish to echo(same counter plant roll and info) plus he has a nasty 80 rnd lmg with an acog. Alsp ela got nerfed to the ground
---
Thanks I'm really proud of that

They come with the game but still need to be unlocked with renown

cuz you a Broke boy
---
cry me a river little bitch

Would love a legendary for the MP5.

More chance of winning the lottery.

Cool idea

Very cool. Could you do the polish ops as well?
---
That was my view for attacking 
---
this needs to happen
---
Maestro’s looks amazing 
---
Pretty!!!!
---
I remember when they first did it. I bought every op and attachment. I didn't get a single point of renown refunded
---
Nope. If I que with 2 friends with alt accounts, they can kill me if we are gonna lose and keep playing until I win. So I could have 100 win rate if I had 2 friends with alt accounts.
---
Gotta say that I really like maestro's
---
tachankas flag is wrong your missing some farming implements
---
I use muzzle brake and acog

This would never work only if the game goes FTP but even them why would you want this to be a thing? 
---
I've got like 4 legendaries this season already and everytime I've almost shit myself. I got the new Ela gun skin the Hibana one the Shiba charm and this one and I feel like my luck is out and I'ma die tomorrow.
---
yea that's a very unlikely scenario.  I agree with OP, ranked blows if you get throwers on your team
---
Rofl,  you loser
---
What’s fun about this 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/b3gy84/apparently_a_lot_of_you_wanted_to_have_this/
---
Focused gun play or just fucking off? Usually recruits are assholes and kill me for not joining in their cult 
---
Melee is the same between both of those, and the knife is a normal melee, with no non-operator obstructions, but you’ll get the gun smack when you would have hit an object like a barricade. It’s why those out of place animations like knifing a barricade or buttstocking an operator happen mostly while moving.
---
Doink
---
can confirm every match my team has at least 1 thrower.  i was a copper as well, its not fun to even play tbh as you don't get a "legit" match
---
The colours are a little harsh, maybe turn down the saturation a bit? But I love this concept anyways 
---
You’re thinking of armadillo my dude
---
Most of them just surrender on the third round. The ones who tk are griefers, ran into one yesterday, he made 2 of our teammates leave, it was a 2v5 for most of the game 
---
I use them to stop fuze
---
haha. It was posted on reddit a while back by u/MrManatee111. I made a minor addition, and put it on Twitter. Just posted to IG. 
---
Funny to see it circling all the way back.
---
I’m not so sure. Ranked is full of sweats and cheaters. Plus, almost none of my friends play Siege so I can’t squad up to play ranked anyway 
---
Last 2 look dope
---
It’s nurf, or nothing
---
Can you do Mozzie for me
---
U r ez elo
---
It's a WWI German/Austrio-Hungarian outfit.
---
Holy shit that’s sickening. Motion sickness kicked in lmao
---
Lol, didn’t know it was posted before.
---
once i hit 99999ms and my whole house collapsed
---
Really good but why does Alibi look stoned as hell 😂
---
No.
---
This is a lot better. I guess the country's colour scheme should be respected so it give a better indicator of the identity of the operators. 
---
They'd probably use it at key times such as immediately after the plant then periodically afterwards to see where the remaining defenders are moving to. 
---
I used to have beyond potato internet, and the highest it has ever been was around 21,000. Needless to say, I was kicked from the game.
---
Or just play ranked 🤔
---
Also maybe you would like lesion? For me a lot of the time I sit in a corner then run out when someone hits a gu mine near me
---
I'm working on it!
---
This would be so useful!
---
They only get to try it out, they don't get it for free.  Also what do you mean "pay extra," all you did was pay in the first place, there's no extra.
---
Truth can be harsh
---
What might look good is for example making Meastros helmet white and on each side in the back have the green and red. Whereas you have the red and green overlapping the helmet.
---
Some operators it doesn't matter, like Jager. I also don't know how my idea would work on flags like Canada. Just looks odd. 
---
If its on comsole sometimes people can accidentally hold down the trigger to dire amd if the have a decent fire rate gun they can kill two people as soon as the round starts by accident 
---
How about no
---
Only maestro
---
Honestly some look better than the originals
---
I like being in lower ranks, it’s usually quite fun
---
Why would this be bad?  It gives people time to see if they like the way the operator plays before buying, since lots of the ops are expensive.
---
So fucking good
---
All good, as long as you enjoyed it is all that matters to me
---
Ranked is too long
---
I thought it would be a gnone
---
SUPER DOPPPEEEE
---
Oof
---
Ah, I see you’re a man of culture as well
---
Keep excusing the hitbox changes my dudes, eventually only the skeleton will be part of the hitbox. I am still against it, no matter how many people will try to convince me otherwise.

Feels bad man. Though it must feel a little bit good that you and your friend killed it. Your enemies must know they’re trash. 
---
No I kinda liked that, in a weird way
---
We know.
---
and that moment when they doesn’t hit a one shot on and they see that 50hp laying down on that health bar the enemy got...
---
These are actually really cool!
---
Exactly. As long as you are having fun and not cheating or hurting your teammates, you’re playing the game right. You can’t say “you’re playing the game wrong” when the guy is literally memeing around. Not his fault the enemy team had the skill level of me trying to play Siege on LSD. The people on here are wack af sometimes. 
---
Don’t be, i didn’t know either
---
How do you do this method?
---
I MADE DIS :)
---
I personally dont get packs that often but I have a lot of renown with nothing to spend it on, and theres so many thing I wish I could get but its all RNG :(
---
My friend rushes sledge shotgun., funniest thing ever
---
Uuum yes please
---
These are, as the rest of my generation says, "lit" and "fire"
---
It was (is?) available in a bundle, together with an eyeball charm.
---
Is this better?
---
?
---
Ah, but is one of the fixed bugs the infamous window on Outback?
---
Bitch be shooting through a mega man arm cannon
---
  that allowed Attackers to spawn kill Defenders.  (O\_o)

Shame she doesn’t look good in game, unless you have the elite.

Is there any way to edit the game files so the icons change to these similar to dead by daylight 
---
If it has rails... is it a rail gun?
---
Ye, it makes more sense now, but punching takes forever to get anywhere with and makes so much noise
---
It's a mind game
---
It already happened to me, there was a tie 'cause of a crosskill at the end of the overtame rounds
---
Yeah spending renown on alpha picks really isn't fun or motivating for the grind, I think a shop is a great idea to not only make it better to spend because you know what you're getting but also to bring players back consistently on a weekly or daily basis to see what's available. 
---
Yeah it happened to me. It was kind of cool though. Just restart the game. It happens if you alt-tab during the start or something similar.
---
she used to have a banana head and now shes just some emo attractive thot

R6 horror playlist, no lights, no drones, no cameras, just flashlights

The Spanish and maestros are badass

Well now ur just blatantly showing that u r toxic, and couldn’t care less about being a good person if it means u get “good content”.
---
Can you do one for buck? The one for frost looks sick and bucks will probably look just as badass
---
Big fucking holes made:1556
---
Completely agree, especially if you are waiting on a friends match to end and they dont even have a full team in round 1, you should be able to join in by invite. 
---
Blitz, but with 25 shotguns instead of flashes
---
An operator that you can smell
---
IQ, but with a Google Pixel XL
---
Thermite, but every time he swears, he apologizes; that sort of thing
---
Started happening yesterday. Only happens in the menus (ex. as shown, operator pick screen, etc). Not sure if its a local occurrence, or if others have experienced it too. Has anyone else had this happen? Or even fixed it? If so, how?
---
How so? He’s invisible to drones, which is what lions scan is.
---
I think I’m one of the few that loves Tower. Nice to see someone else likes it 
---
Noooooo

Do black beard’s

amazing, i need more, gonna go try to use reddits awful search function

i agree cuz i got a black ice but i didn’t immediately equip it n i forgot what gun/op it’s for

I love how Frost's looks bloody, the same way it would it someone actually stepped in one.

Mira is from the country of Legoland
---
I've actually been trying that out idk if I said anything about him in the post and I'm in a bit of a rush atm otherwise I'd check but I like his smg with a surpressor which some people don't like surpressors but it gives you even just a couple seconds advantage sometimes and sometimes that's all you need to win. I'll go between valk and lesion see who I have more fun playing with as well as decent success 
---
Not all games are family shared, siege is an example

35 rockets in a magazine, that's gonna be a huge-ass explosion

Nice

hmmm is all i think of when i see this

That's because you are offline
---
Nah, she looks like a generic preset for “Asian” in a bad character creator. Her elite looks good, and the Halloween will look good when they fix it on console (though they claim it already was, it wasn’t).
---
Restart the Game or your Computer and it should be fixed.
---
Yeah split up into sections e.g uniforms 
---
OOF
---
p90 with suppressor will always remind me of cod4mw. such a cool gun! wish it had a bit less recoil in siege though
---
Been playing for over a year and I have 1040 hours in casual and 85 in ranked. I have to play purely solo and got to Plat 3 at least, but it's not fun; I find myself in a state of wanting matches to be over instead of actually enjoying playing. 
---
Now that the rounds are shorter in cas and you can pick spawns on ATK/see obj on DEF, my desire to play ranked is diminishing even further. 
---
