Okay man, you do you. I was just trying to show a cool possibility that could happen.

U haven’t shown any possibility u were just bitching about skins in a round about way 
---
Hahahaha this made me go to like the Dee crevasses of my brain to remember who Bong Lord is 
---
Amazing
---
Sorry did you just call an operator who can heal his teammates useless? Doc is literally all about team play and allowing teammates to safely engage in another firefight they would otherwise lose due to their low health. That’s the difference between winning and losing more often then not by getting an extra pick that round.

What is the point of this?

yeah and be storing piss bottles under my deluxe gaming chair by next week... think I'll stick with potato aim

1). I do not believe that cav needs a nerf due to the weapon drop off beginning at 1 meter, something that takes most other hand guns 5 meters to hit. I aim for the head, so although this change won't affect me too much, I believe that most people forget how much communication you need to counter cav. When she was introduced there were no global ops, leading to high team work and communication to push the objective. She's also never used in pro league for this reason; pro players (and anyone playing competitively) are in VERY tight teams. Now, most people frag hunt, and go alone making them an easy one-tap target. Because of this meta change, I agree that this game is almost a more glorified BO4 experience. I think that everything started going down after operation health, as this was where most of the meta changes really took hold. No more ACOGS on defense, and a LOT more broken ash-style ops. This trend towards low skill ops really took the game hard.
---
2). This, combined with the buff to pistols, and Blitz buffa really accelerated this game to not being fun competitively. Maps such as Theme Park or Tower being ok map experiments really added to the game almost being purposefully frustrating to try and rank up in. The Cancer meta was limited to Blackbeard in season 2, but now with all the global ops on offense, and all the intel gadgets on defense, this game has heavily strayed from its roots. I think Ubisoft should've​ really focused on quality ops, as opposed to their circus act of juggling how effective an operator is by making them almost impossible to counter.
---
3). Ubisoft has been molasses slow with updates, and is the reason I think they should bring back mid-season reinforcements. They could have something on the TTS every 2 or 3 weeks, and finalize the good changes in the mid season reinforcements. I think they also should really change the season pass model, as I think 8 operators every year is too much considering the direction the game has gone. I think they should stop changing the UI every other day and focus on more pressing issues. Also, I think they should region lock accounts, preventing smurfing on other countries. This is also a major issue with seige, and has made ranked a serious shit hole. Overall, Ubisoft really fucked the only game they really had going for them, and as sad as I am to say it, this game isn't going to live to 100 operators, and with Ubisofts behavior in recent events, may die before reaching the 50 operator mark.
---
Rainbow 5, panty siege. 
---
Jackal. He’s great for solo and group que, has great weapons, and great secondary gadgets. 
---
In practice maybe but realistically Doc runs around the map being an ACOG warrior healing himself to take more engagements. Most Doc's just heal teammates when its convenient for them.
---
Are you a roamer or anchor kind if person. For roaming, especially in lower ranks/levels, cav would be one of the best. Lesion or Mira are great anchors. You can keep saving for ela bc she fast af, and her shotgun is good. Dokkaebi is also great aswell (perfect for being cancer while playing bomb, along with lion and jackal). Though, her secondaries are a bit, underpowered at times. Take everything that anyone says about ops with a grain of salt. It's always up to users preference when it come to them. Good luck, hope you do well.
---
Perfect!.mp4

Way back in Y1 I made it 50 points from diamond. Then went on a losing streak because of idiots and was gold within a day.

Oh my god, guys. This entitled little shit was doing the things that HE wanted to do, in HIS house, on the game that HE bought. How dare he? We can't let him get away with this.

If you have tried rolling back drivers, tried everything possible with your nvidia geforce experience app and nvidia 3D settings, uninstalled and reinstalled the game, verified local game files through steam, this video might help https://youtu.be/KzxmLDam-wM. I was having trouble with throttling and this helped. You may also have to try undervolting your CPU. You can find videos on how to do that online. 
---
Depends on how u play. Personally, i love maestro because if they don’t bring explosives or sledge, they are powerless to resist your zaps. In a similar vein, clash’s shield can do the same thing. Maestro’s Alda is really good but has floaty recoil while his aa-12 albeit with 32 rounds, has a very long ttk (think 1-2 seconds of continuous fire at 10 feet) and is really just a meme gun. I don’t have nearly as much experience playing clash but she can do area denial similarly. If you have a sneaky streak, hide the maestro turret by a reinforced wall and zap all the thermite and Hogan’s charges. From my experience playing maestro, after zapping someone they don’t really expect you to push so going from passive sadist to aggressive miser machine usually catches them off guard. I’d get maestro bc I’m something of a sadist but clash can also function similarly.
---

---
In respect to the upcoming clash buff, keep in mind it takes a very long time for her to stow/deploy her shield so you’re going to have to disengage for a sizable amount of time if you want to whip it out. Or you could do the xXxMLGxXx 180 and turn your back to face them while you switch, allowiwing the stowed shield to block damage. This has like a 50/50 chance of working every time I’ve tried. 
---
so many toxic runouts
---
His weapons are solids, ability isn’t the best, isn’t the worst. Handy for identifying people you haven’t droned or scaring roamers. 
---
cuz it basically a reflex sight anyways
---
:)
---
This gave me a thought of what if instead of a number of panels he instead gets a square footage of material to work with. Choose one corner then the opposite corner to deploy a barricade size of his choosing. 
---
Obviously would be hella hard to implement so it's just an idea 
---
I was worried cause my girlfriend’s pc gets 180 FPS but that’s probably because the cpu 100 bug thank you though.
---
If not that would be a problem.
---
Is- is this an intentionally cringey copypasta?
---
Yay, more retarded kids in RB6. Just what we need.
---
Yeah you should get very good frames
---
It works but only at a certain range, which sould be over 3 meters. Also for some reason it doesn't work at all with blitz.
---
Good job Interro, one of the best commentators  in my opinion
---
So it only screws you over when your team isn't playing right in which case it's your fault as a team and not Cav's fault in design. That's like saying that Ash needs to be nerfed because good players like to play against bad players with her. I'm generally around Plat 3 on PC, far from the best, and very rarely do I get screwed over or have my team get screwed over by Cav even when I'm solo Qing and when it happens even my solo Q teammates would just say "yeah we screwed up there let's not make that mistake again." I get that she screws over teams a lot especially in silver/low gold but then again when it happens it's not Cav's fault as an operator but your team's for not being coordinated. 
---
Don't want to be racist but...
---
Dunno why you're the only one who's mentioned this
---
People dont realize that the castle barricades are made from polyethylene, a plastic that is not electrically conductive. Physically it would be impossible to electrify like a reinforced wall
---
Maestro.
---
He's the dude who can really be good in almost all situations.
---
lvl 354 and got my platinum on 16 Jan 2016
---
That’s my problem with this game you’ll put half a clip in their chest and then somehow in the killcam they potato, hit you with one bullet and their health bar is still 3/4 full
---
It would kind of conflict with the game to much I feel. Siege isn’t as run and fun as most console shooters so it usually isn’t a problem if you are decent
---
Dust_2 was made with Morocco, it even has the word "Maroc" (Morocco in french) when you're to B, im not so sure about mirage though

Flashbangs so he can burn out the ADSs for his teamate with smokes.

What do you mean put it on?

---
It's never not on.
---
Yeah I knew that I just want to know why some people think that the game should be balanced for level 60 bronze players. Were people say "just stand still" is a viable counter for Lion.
---
Seems more like a blitz dawg
---
No...Just console plebs. 
---
Guess they were trying out a frag heavy strat.
---
Umm they were all recruits. Pretty sure they went into the game wanting to screw around
---
This. Nothing like walking for 15 minutes to the AO, just to get headshotted from 1200m.
---
Ugh 
---
You sure he’s not named Kaid? He’s got the sniping pistol and the electric plungers right next to him.
---
you look great by the way
---
The game is 3 year and old. Get over it. This is the way the game is.

I always used it in CS cause I got a nice skin for it.

Thanks buddy for the clarification, as if you didn’t drive home your point earlier. 👍

I don’t think reaction time is different since you know that’s a human thing, I’d just say PC players have an easier time aiming

Before the R4C nerf, she had and lost smokes waaaaay back in the day.

His armor panels are now grafted FROM his skin.

FTFY
---
A true MVP
---
It was a buff if anything. She can now 3 shot from spawnpeeking range, for a roamer based around close range engagements that's crazy good.
---
Flaring is broken
---
1200 dpi, 21 horizontal and 17 vertical in game with different multiplier so it's like 9 and 5 ingame. Ads is 72 just because it feels nice
---
That’s not what he meant... an indirect buff as though making changes to the map... like new doorways
---
Aus server is cancer tho 
---
Did Vigil get buffed? I can't even see his white lines anymore... :/
---
I love Elżbieta Bosak. Or Ela for the game. Her ability suck for the most part but her shotgun... oh boy her shotgun is amazing.

How is this budget?

For pointing out that he's blatantly copying posts for karma?

Just saying even if it were to get more skins Ubisoft's design team ain't really great for that stuff.

I play rook almost exclusively as an anchor, mainly because I’m not an awesome fragger and I feel like giving out armor is my way of contributing to the team whether or not I’m getting kills.

They do work, but a gas mask without a proper air supply won't protect from all lethal gasses. It will protect from gasses like CS spray and the like.

This is good

You’d still probably be able to take them out as Zofia, unless her impacts don’t still work on electrified barbed wire. 
---
I cant say whats good or bad anymore to be honest, I spend 90% of my season in low leagues. The only time I get to play the "real" game is at the beginning of the seasons. 
---

Very cool, Kanye. Very cool.

I’ll try my best on whatever project I do next
---
Toxicity in this game is team killing, and vtking solo quers with a 4 stack, things of that sort. 
---
 
---
There's nothing toxic the enemy team can do the the other outside of hacking/glitch abuse and smurfing. The community loves to throw the word toxic around at anything they have a hard time dealing with. It's a 5v5 objective based TDM. Spawn peeking, wall banging, crouch walking, etc aren't toxic, they're just techniques to get an upper hand. You're playing to win, alls fair in a fire fight. Just because you lost to someone doing it, doesn't mean they're being toxic and abusive, it just means you lost the fight. Learn from those that bested you, watch what they did and use it as a tool for future fights. 
---
FUCKING INSTAGRAM NORMIES, I AM ACUALLY MAD AT THIS PERSON
---
Ubisoft said previously they didn’t want to nerf her because she’s fun to use. honestly how can they nerf her without ruining her. making her gun worse makes her useless. taking away a breaching round makes her useless. making her 2 armor makes her useless. they can’t do much to her without reworking her entirely which is something they’ll never do 
---
if you don’t require after 3 minutes then you’re wasting your own time. 
---
u/BigBootyKim has 1/4 votes to kick
---
nice job wasting your own time. require after 3 minutes 
---
Yeah I do understand that. I feel like it somewhat losing the meaning of "casual" when there is an MMR for it. I checked my winrate on r6tracker and im at 67.1%, Top 8%. I just want casual to be casual and there has been so many times I get into a casual match against a full squad of plats and diamonds that use PL strats and its annoying. 
---
"why tryhard in casual" dude's literally chunka on his throne... i love this community

For a second there I thought it was ketchup and mustard.

She’s really a  balanced operator she’s good at killing with no global ability. 
---
However she wouldn't be allowed to have camos on the holograms as it would be impossible for the developers to keep updating them.
---
Missed chance for Mute to have/offer tape.

I feel you, I got close to a vigil a knifed him but it didn't count, he knifes me a meter away and I got killed 
---
I honestly expected surprised pikachu
---
that’s exactly right. she’s good at what she does which is frag. that’s what she was made for. she’s perfectly balanced as is 
---
Same lol
---
I wouldn't know, but I doubt it. 
---
I mean it’s hard to find these entertaining or impressive if the enemy is like bots and you shoot them ADS the whole time like a shooting range 
---

If you're wanting to pick up a copy of the game but willing to wait about a month or so, you'll be able to get it on sale. There is normally a good sale before the new season launches. 
---
Well it has the legendary icon
---
Personally when that happens to me I try and look at the positive and just tell myself “at least I got a legendary”
---
I remember my first ace... it was a 1v5 and well... lets just say my team was alive, in a tactical postion around the enemy... and i was playing fuze...
---
its okay, i doubt posting it here would get me unbanned anyway, just wanted to know what caused me to get banned even though i didnt cheat
---
Rude
---

---
I'm in the same boat as you on the issue haha I'm on console as well
---
*mission failed, we'll get 'em next time*

The thing is im not sure if this was 100% sarcastic .-.

Ps: happy cakeday :D

---
Ametuers.
---
Thanks! Yeah, this post is compeletly sarcastic, but some people didn't seem to catch that...
---
Yeah that would def be hard to come back from. What monitor do you have that's 16x10?
---
He’s not wrong 
---
Lol tell me about it. Imagine this but being in solo queue. But I normally get matches of my own skill level after a couple of matches getting wrecked
---
And, as we all know, the person with a pink-scaled selfie and dog snapchat filter is the finest of intellectuals. Fortnite is so incredible, we apparently copied it a whole year and a half before it existed.
---
This is v funny and all however I totally agree with u/astrokittieh I’m tired of the shitty people
---
I wouldnt considering he voted "YES" to kick himself
---
No, not at all. It actually is a very annoying problem that should be fixed. Vote kick is used for 95% toxicity and 5% legitimate kicks.
---
Lol. Well, I did start playing rainbow siege waaaaay before he did. But for 2 seasons now, we have been playing together and I'm his so-called mentor. He has operators that I do not have, and I have operators that he does not have. So it's kinda like balancing our playstyle with the operators we have, which leads me to trust him when he said Maverick sucks. But thanks anyway for the advice. I'll get Maverick this weekend.
---
Why is this not implemented? All it would need is a few tweaks. I deal with so many toxic people who teamkill as a squad and left powerless in a match I either can't leave or just play the spectating game.
---
my post wasn't shit it was literally ahead of its time by 10 hours
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also the community lol, a couple days ago someone posted a video about rb6's community and it makes me cringe at how these degenerates act
---
castle is #ashy 
---
(love you op)
---
I doubt all Cav players will be religiously counting meters to their target. Yes, the Luison is more reliable, but it’s also less forgiving. Overall, she is kinda in the same place.
---
Hibachi and 200iq has noticeable head headgear. So you can very see them easy on gun fights. Ash wears a small ass cap, not the new era style but the Nike baseball caps. And I guarantee many people have problem gunfights with her than with Hibana and Iq. Plus their guns are balance. Like hibana has a low mag ar with high recoil but high damage and high fire rate. IQ with mostly low fire rate but high damage like L8 used by sledge and thatcher. Also iq Lmg has a high recoil even with a grip. Oh and jackal and twitch guns being op. Naw their main guns have high firing rates but you obv play pc so recoil is never an issue unlike in ps4/Xbox does. With ash’s gun, not the g36c, high fire rate, decent mag size, obnoxious low recoil for high fire rate and decent damage. If you wanna talk about op look at Ela’s shotgun. The thing has both range, mag size, and damage. And with a trigger finger, high fire rate. 
---
And you saying new players picking ash because she’s simple to use. What new players?! Majority of them always pick the sas operatiors. Those good ash players arent useful dead. Yea after picking off like 2~3 teammates until one of the defenders pick her off with her 20&gt; health. 
---
So yea I agree with the masses that she’s OP. But not because I’m following their words. I keep experiencing her bullshit so that’s why I agree. 
---
Maybe tell your cousin that you can do other things than make one obvious hole and peek it until he dies
---
very cool
---
I think it’s from sau siege on Instagram, he makes loads of r6 art
---
Lol. Wait till he sees this reddit post. I can't wait to see his reaction for this.
---
Maverick is great has good weapons and a good gadget the only downside I see is he’s not that good at hard breaching like thermite or hibana but that honestly doesn’t matter 
---
i have a viewsonic 24 inch its 16:9 i just choose to play on 16:10 to make enemies slightly larger

24.0 inches ≈ 61.0 centimetres ^(1 inch = 2.54cm)

On second thought, maybe you're right. MAYBE my cousin is not playing him right. Thanks for the advice Capitao Main.... But WHERE ARE THE MAVERICK MAINS AT?
---
Plot twist, he still stands in necessary doorways
---
Can he open up hatches and walls big enough like Hibana does? If he does, is it efficient as Hibana?
---
Yeah, vote kick should honestly be removed

At least show both in game screens 
---
Thank you!
---
Dude you are so right with 1v5 and I've been in multiple some I clutched some I didn't but straight up after that round would be over I could hear my heart beating so hard in my chest
---
I insulted Maverick all of Grim Sky before I realized I mained him thanks to Ubisoft. he’s an amazing operator, just make sure you get used to his weapons more than anything. also, make unpredictable holes with the torch, rather than long, obvious lines
---
Yeah. Its funny how you’re always the one who gets vote kicked when you were the last guy. Really you’re better than your teammates for surviving longer you they’re hypocrites 
---
just report those messages
---
Its basically only this game. And im fine with some glitches happening every now and then but, i guess i didn't explain how it works.
---
On average:
---
I start a game
---
I pick my operator
---
I spawn
---
At this point its either a glitch, long load time, or next...
---
I see someone, i shoot him, either; 1 - i shoot him before he shoots me (for like a whole second), he shoots at me and i die, his hp bar 3/4 are full OR i shoot someone, headshot, they wont die, i die im sad :(
---
EVERY TIME, i wanna enjoy the game, not have this... it turned me into a -10 speed ash main and i always get low kills and in other games i get high kd and its just very unfair for me. This is great
---
Thanks bud. That's lot of information right there. But I usually solo Q, or duo with my cousin ( the one I mention about in the title). IF Maverick is still as lethal as a lone wolf as he would be with a good communicating team, then it's a bonus. But don't worry, I'll get Maverick soon enough.
---
 And ... when you dead you could even see a Sledge use his hammer trying to break the surface which “was reinforced” 
---
I don't wanna sound dumb, but what does triple A mean? ._.
---
Also i would prefer ubisoft not releasing ANY new operators for an operation or 2 if it means the game will be fixed
---
Nice art :)
---
It is for the first offence (15 days) not sure if you get a perma for it but i suppose it should be

I feel your pain man, there’s no chance of getting up once you get this low.

As Russian, sometimes i feel shameful for gopnik "culture" is what foreign people take interest in. Mostly because people may start see every slav as gopnik and this is sad.
---
While I agree that these operators needs balancing/changes, increasing mute jammer's range and making vigil invisible to lions drone wouldn't change anything. 
---
1-2 trappers and castle. That's pretty much the best way. Nothing to do with Ubisoft fixing anything except for a Castle buff. That'd be great 
---
Don't forget blitz, the main character of "Run and Melee everything that isn't your teammate" simulator
---
Was waiting for this.
---
Why not? If you get increased range in being able to hide, wont that massively change lion and dokks power? 
---
One round I played Kapkan the only of my 5 EDDs that detonated was a Window EDD on Ash.
---
The community has been the same ever since a month after launch. Most people are just toxic assholes really.

Hello number_92, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ah8n01/why_is_ranked_still_broken/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yes.
---
where is RECENT? You aren't listening. 
---
Screen recording a YouTube video instead of just using a link... And then skipping bakc and forth in time on it while it's recording.
---
But y tho
---
Vigil being immune to lion wouldn't make sense. Lion's ee-one-d uses sonar to detect movement, vigil's ability wipes his image from cameras
---
December 21st is pretty recent i'd say.
---
oh this is OLD, like year one kind of old ... there are two versions of that skin in game, the old one and the new one. the new one is the one everyone gets with the season-pass.
---
only a hand full of people has the old version.
---
I get that but lore re writes wont kill anyone 
---
Counter : Scissor man
---
Thatcher?
---
Ah Scissor man... My Old enemy. 
---
The fact they are using "Global" ability. Roamer will rarely have mute jammers next to them and dokka/lion Combo is just too strong against roamers. Add few flashbangs/grenades/softbreachers into the mix, and the roamers are doomed. Before Lion and Dokka, attackers had to use drones (that takes time to deploy, send away, gather info and then switch back to operator to approach the roamer) and now they just use their gadgets on the move and save too much time on roam clearing
---
They made the statements months back, but some of the said things came to effect in Wind Bastion. They don't need to make statements every month, if they've announced the fixes that are coming already.
---
True, but that still doesn't solve the fact that lion is cancer. You can't balance lion by making a single guy a counter to him. You need to fix him by fixing his broken aspect.
---
And besides, lion has been reworked. Pengu announced it. He will be released next season.
---
Neither would standing still for a few seconds but here we are
---
Lore and game mechanics are very different things 
---
Because of their general broken concept. 1 button press = freeze/fuck everybody who doesn't sit in the mute jammer's range? Yep, still broken. No skill involved on their part.
---
Wow great game 
---
You mean compensator
---
Probably what it sounds like in Japanese 
---
Shouldn't this be cav? ;)
---
Fuck
---
Pls
---
Also a good point 
---
Nice idea, protects from Jetpack Hibanas
---
Ditto 
---
She’s fine how she is though
---
Will try that with her today, thanks.
---
This. Same thing happens with "gneu gneu casual tryhader go ranked".  
---
I mean, isn't it the point of a game to WIN?
---
It’s extremely annoying when you aim through a small gap and it sticks to your cover, i think it would either pass through holes easier or as a stop gap be able to pickup
---
Actually I think this is happening. Unfortunately they arent in a great resolution but I think they are saved locally, considering u didnt clean this folder it could take you a heck of a time to find the one youre searching for
---
Soft roam. Doc is a nightmare to deal with when locking down sites near the objective because the combo of acog, 3 armor, and the ability to heal himself is super hard to deal with. For example Doc is a monster at holding down the 90 hallway on Villa. I hate the new maps mostly outside of Villa, but he is very good for these big ass maps they keep adding. 
---
IRA?
---
Gopniks are like chavs in Britain, right? I don't think anyone in their right mind believes that every single person in Russia is like that or that this sub-culture is a good one.
---
I should have the basic weapon and gadget setup within around ten hours. I plan to keep you guys posted about it.
---
However
---
Here's what I have so far
---
Jameson MacMassi- (codenamed Jameson)
---
Armor-xxx.     Speed-x
---
Weapon kit-
---
R57-Pyro flamethrower: damage ( 6 a sec) ignites wooden objects (walls and barricades) as well as players. Burns no longer than 10 seconds, however, players can hold prone button to roll and put the fire out. (Ability)
---
BULL .500 mag- single action revolver that does 75 damage, only holds five rounds. Very slow to for, in order to balance the damage.
---
Choice of Molotov Cocktail or claymore.
---
Molotov Cocktail- does 3 damage per second, burns for 10 seconds, has a 5 foot radius.
---
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
---
Maerk "Lucky" McManus (codenamed Lucky)
---
Armor-xx      speed-xx
---
Ability- "Leprechaun"
---
Magnetic propane tank that is attached to reinforced walls, Lucky drives the nozzle through with a mallet (also his melee weapon instead of a knife) it pours gas into a 3 foot radius on both sides of the wall. A 100 damage explosion will be caused on both sides of the wall. (Unless it is shot from a distance in which case it does 50 damage to either side) can be disabled by melee or by shooting from a distance (sledge's hammer included)
---
It is ignited by any and all open flames (gunfire included)
---
Passive ability- Masochist:doesn't flinch when damaged.
---
Choice of:
---
Sawed-off side-by-side shotgun or .22 cal compressed air "needlegun"
---
Sawed-off: double barrel shotgun, does 90 damage, has poor range (max of 5 meters) slow reload time, low capacity.
---
.22 Cal "Needlegun": compressed air "SMG" that fires sharpened metal rods the size of a .22 bullet. 30 damage, semi-auto.
---
BULL .500 mag- same as marked above ^
---
Choice if Molotov Cocktail or impact grenade.
---
Because it wouldn't make sense for sledge and feel niche.
---
A hammer charge(he has 25 uses) means whatever he smashes gets destroyed.
---
Now, swinging 2 times to destroy a wall will make sledge waste a lot of time and be in danger , in that case you would prefer already planting a breaching charge instead of sledging it.
---
Summary:
---
Shots 1-3: Clearly missed.
---
Shots 4: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
---
Shots 5-7: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
---
Explain?
---
Yes sir, and all the booze implied
---
^Daddy
---
Why do you make every first letter capital?
---
The dudes who blew up pubs and are labelled terrorists? Don’t think that would go down too well.
---
Completely fine xd

Irish Republic Army
---
Most of his enemies were unranked, you are correct.
---
oh

Its Just The Way I Type
---
All Diamonds go to lower ranks to dunk on people. Source:ima Diamond. I mainly play with lower ranks so i can play with my friends cause no one of us will have a good time i. Higher ranked games. But i dont get why you get the same team or enemies thst you just versed.

That's how the movement started, but recently they're trying to set themselves up a functioning army

Based on my experience of going from XBOX to PC, I think it's a no unfortunately

You play a game console with a controller, because that's what everyone uses. If you aren't using a controller then you are seeking some form of advantage elsewhere which takes you off the level playing field with everyone else. At that point you are a cheater or bad at the game, or just generally weak. They should be irrelevant but somehow there's so many of them that they aren't a minority anymore. And don't bullshit me with "you get peeked and go straight for the MnK" because people don't tend to shout M/K unless the get fucking up down left right 180 snapped to at 100/100. Cheater sympathisers everywhere now. Imagine actually having great game knowledge and sense and then plugging in your mouse and keyboard on your console cos you are a piece of shit that can't hack it. I can literally smell a mouse and keyboard player in this game now, it wouldn't be so bad but it's pretty shameless now and they take the piss with it in the killcams and end of round shots. Like "ha look at me, I'm actually disabled" 
---
Is this on pc? I’m on Xbox and it only happens here there when people have a scuff or some type of device to aid them🤣
---
Ok thanks

Mutes a beast

Either this sniper^ or Cavs shotgun

Holo- Good reticle but thicker frame
---
Reflex- Bad reticle but thin ass frame
---
Red dot- Good reticle but thick frame
---
ACOG- Zoom in in those pimples mate.
---
Clunk clunk clunk of blitz
---
Enemy drone dropping for scan
---
Needs an agog the super 90 lmao
---
Yeh regular reflex is the budget Acog, but the Russian reflex is much better than a holo
---
Imagine the scenes hahaha
---
Tcsg
---
No
---
This is a very misleading and counter intuitive tip. Almsot every monty I face is too passive, and ends up just being a free kill. After enough experience playing with, and against montagne, you'll lesrn when it's best to drop your shield and when to keep it up
---
It’s really clear. 
---
So satisfying to look at
---
Should we worry about you? 
---
I think they are suggesting a deployable shield type of castle barricade that has a spot to fire through, almost like in a tower of a real castle, that also can’t be penetrated by normal gunfire or destroyed by grenades
---
Im sorry, but who the hell do you think you are using a reflex on the M12 instead of the RDS???
---
Probably
---
!remind me 2 hours
---
Got confused about which sub I was looking at for a sec.
---
My first match on house, I was getting yelled at to not reinforce kids, I was like, WHYY?!?!?!?!
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I stopped playing after white noise. Map and operator design has always been hit or miss, though. Remember OG Blackbeard? Yeah, that was some dumb shit. Yacht and Favela had terrible balance issues. 
---
However, they NEED to sort out the issues with ranked and casual. Teamkilling, toxicity and vote kicking is what drives players away from the game, especially new ones. Back in year one, when the community was still pretty small (you often met the same ppl in games) there were some assholes but there were also lots of friendly people. You could actually have fun playing solo or with a friend. I played a shit ton of casual back then and had a good time mostly.
---
Lol to lazy to edit it that much. Just enough to trim it.
---
I'm gonna do some more tests if I can still get a headshot. How far left of the ladder do you have to repel to avoid getting headshoted

Pengu said the rework for lion is done and dropping next season.

There’s always time for punctuation. When you have some feee time, try exercising on weiting dfast while also using punctuation, you’ll end up writing quite fast, while also being grammarly correct
---
You can jam finkas surge
---
Guess you meant Nerf, and I guess you may be right, forgot about cav being faster since all 3 speed were slowed down a little, but also using a pistol kinda compensates that.
---
No. I honestly think Alibi is the lost balanced op in the game.
---
[k](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

And? If you want a fair game play ranked it's casual for a reason most people playing dont care if they're playing against lvl 4000 or lvl 2

Khajiit? Like UpIsNotJump’s cat owo

It seems like it would be, but I can do this pretty easily with a normal controller, you just need to know how to and get some practice at it

woot! ... woot! ... WOW
---
Yeah but frost and smoke have different types of traps, don’t compare ops just because of their weapons. Frost is a viable option because of how good her trap is at defending points and windows
---
That's true but in a lot of scenarios the ones who have died first have died from being retards
---
Xim
---
STALKER bandits pretty much based on gopniks. STALKER games developers are Ukraine company. I think they know more about gopniks rather than chavs. Or did you mean gopnik/chav "culture" in general?
---
They defend upstairs because the defender can destroy the floor above the site to cover from a safe spot the most usual plant spots. If attackers manage to plant the bomb they can easily drop the hatch instead of rotating down by using the stairs
---
insane
---
I feel that's more of a new operator, not a buff
---
Lies, austalians aren't real
---
and? you still have to bind to two separate buttons. macros are so easy too, practically all keyboards these days come with software for them built right in. i tested it out in terrorist hunt and in less than 2 minutes I'm agent smith. using my own hardware from my corsair keyboard never had to download anything.

Why would you ask retarded irrelevant shit that has nothing to do with the subject?

Think of it like fancy barbed wire. Even if your enemy shoots it out successfully, you can still see when it gets shot out. And playing tricks on people never gets old.

True

Tbh, I actually prefer the old one over the rework.

Nah they complain they cant see me I complain They missed yet I still died I think its fair xd

If anyone sneaks up on us, J'zargo will smell them coming. Or he might not. We'll see.

That’s what I was thinking. I don’t really understand why they would reinforce heavily upstairs though or in random parts of the map. Is it because they’re common entry/push spots?
---
5 seconds until insertion

I don’t think this one is better than the old on(I don’t even know why they reworked the old one) but I’ve come to actually like it

Mad cuz bad

Really tho

thats just the icon with a pixel filter.. smh
---
This is super well made, nice job!
---
Shields are broken and inconsistent sometimes they get shot through sometime the use himself shoots through it... Sometimes they get knifed but nothing happens and sometimes they flash u dont look at them, and even out of range yet get flashed...
---
I actually agree with this, she should be better for actually tricking people. Though if this is done she should probably have the amount of pings she gives reduced.
---
I love this sort of thing. 
---
What about spetznaz next?
---
I wanna tell you to wait for year 4 reveal for season 1. I have a really good feeling 
---
It's retarded. He pushes a button that is (99.9% sure about this) hard wired to the fucking flash shield but somehow the radio waves fuck him over? Bull shit. I don't even main him anymore and it's stupid.
---
ifit makes you feel better I am pretty sure chavs (and bogans) are much more known than gopnik, first time I ever saw the word gopnik.

What’s the song **i want to listen it on loop**
---
To my knowledge they said it will be revealed at the Invitationals
---
A lot of the time you can't save an injured teammate in a frontal assault because of explosives or because they think it's smart to move. You should always have 1 person with you when moving because then that almost forces the defense to fall back. You can easily hold people out of OBJ or pinch them into an open area. His Magnum is a 2 shot from most ranges and his P9 is also very strong. You can play him any way you want but no matter what you'll get your ass clapped by someone sometime. I play very Passive-Aggressive with him so ultimately my (slightly biased) opinion is to play Passive-Aggressive or at least try it out.
---
Great shot kid one in a million

Wow

He’s fine he just tripped and fell on some tomato sauce

Put on Low reflections this only drain your fps.

Cav's greatest weakness (the Lusion at a distance) was buffed with this latest "nerf" improving her long range effectiveness. 
---
Play with friends. I don't think I've ever been random vote to get kicked, but then again I usually play with at least one other friend.
---
They have definitely said it will be at Invitationals but we'll see. It is Ubi after all.
---
It's easy to look at one shot every few hours of gameplay and complain that the hitreg doesn't work properly. But from this clip there's so many things that are more likely to have happened. Filming the clip on the phone, low framerate footage, spectator lag. Hit reg issues are not common, the issue however is easier to spot when a player is doing movements like this since it's so fast, any issue connection wise is going to look more extreme
---
LEAVE ME ALONE!
---
You mean you work for the Russian government.
---
yes?
---
Lol I wouldn't play with mouse and keyboard 😂 I'm only gonna be playing casually hahah
---
Wow these 2 operators was my best played attacking operators 
---
Sounds like Super Mario.
---
Wait what the fuck
---
Sure, and what is the real harm in that? Apparently all those people who upvote it hadn't seen it yet, so it's just more people seeing things they like. Karma is just internet points.
---
If you do, I would always request to at least include a link to the original artist. A link to their instagram or whatever is good enough. 
---
ngl I'm new/a complete trashcan and I never would have thought to do that. Especially since I'm still mastering caveira. But my point is I should've won anyway because I hit sooo many shots that didn't register.
---
I've also seen RTS players go up to 400 actions per minute in high intensity competitions. It's not unlikely that someone can use their movement keys that fast.
---
Where do I insert my money cards?
---
Looks pretty dope
---
Shut up back there!
---
*Slide to the left!* lol looked like he danced into those crosshairs
---
Earrape warning!
---
There's something called drop-off. So lower damage on longer distances.
---
Defenders can get in through 4 windows and 1 door. Once they get in, the attackers can only go back in the room through the single door or risk running out the master bedroom window.
---
Yeah you're correct. I'm just upset. There needs to be a better way, maybe make it a majority thing instead of needing 100%. Idk
---
Like an elite controller 
---
Well, depends what you call directly. But yeah, there's a page where you can report a player including evidence. I do it every once in a while when I run into a genuine toxic player. 
---
The recoil is randomized so a simple script wouldn't help that much with the recoil
---

LOOK AT HER FACEEEEE

Reduced damage of MP5 from 30 to 27
---
Congrats, you're the problem with the siege community
---
People are being upset over a whopping 3 damage? 
---
Nice..
---
Ain’t nothing wrong with that. 
---
Mute them. Problem solved. Tking is the only real form of toxicity in this game.
---
A lot of players _are_ there though. 
---
Yup lol even the Cav change is more so a buff imo
---
Lol thanks

Hello iz357, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ahbwyw/first_ever_black_ice_xddddd/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Elas
---
It's been almost a year since I last played siege and I remember this kind of thing happening all the time.
---
Every time I see some 12 year kid spasming out lean + crouch spamming while aiming at 3 different corners and pre-firing them at the same time, I die a little inside.
---
But, people will do whatever it takes and abuse as many game mechanics as possible to gain an advantage. Ubisoft responded to drop shooting a while ago with a game mechanic nerf, and honestly I'd like to see the same thing done to crouching and leaning - or at least make them slower animations or something you can't blatantly abuse with no penalty just to make your hit box move.
---
lol
---
My point was that it almost never happens to me to play casual with three other friends and it is even more rare that we kick the random 5th guy, but I guess nobody here thinks with their head.
---
u/kingcals

What'd he say?

Thought this was a sharingan for the longest time

Does it really matter? It is just a cat.

Lol yea.

Yeah that commentor clearly didn't play from S1 you could do it oh so much worse then but partly as you say what was the point when you could also legit drop shot. God do I miss that game.
---
Not a bad price either. I saw the 150 and thought wtf, googled the conversion and it's like £17

Someone else said they made them, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Thank you

Ash wasn't able to point out the hidden cav player 2 seconds after being shot at?  What a fucking dumbass!!!!

In case you missed it, top comment has a link to it - it's from Etsy.

Pulse duckin and dodgin

It actually has recoil and a decreased mag size (12 from 15) now

LPT for those of you that use Discord or Teamspeak. Bind your “push to mute” key to the same key that you use as your push to talk key in game. That way it will get rid of the echo from hearing both Discord/TS &amp; game VOIP at the same time.

So after I dropped down T-AA from 4x to 1x I'm getting frame rates in mid 2's to 3's. W/ bloom and zoom and all that shit enabled
---
I dont reinforce when i play kapkan roam
---
Not everyone has issues with balance.
---
I really don't understand the hate for that kind of map though. Though very high level, coastline penthouse site is just dominated by 1 single window almost every game. It's not fun to have 1 single point be the only possible way to enter a site. 3rd floor takes teamwork and coordination. Lots of info too. The roof drone hole is SO useful for info you can have a drone up there watching almost the entire floor.
---
Definitely cav especially when she’s hiding in some obscure corner 
---
Blitz. When you die from just about any other operator (even Ash) it's usually because the other player outplayed you with some combination of aim, crosshair placement, recoil control and positioning. None of those really apply when you die from Blitz, you die because he can sprint with a shield and blind you. You're dying due to the nature of the operator as opposed to the skill of the player. That's what frustrates me.
---
No Homo
---
Since you already know about casual mmr then you should know that people who play at a higher level will have lower casual mmr because they dont play casual.
---
I thought this was a cs post because I have them both up at the same time
---
Why do you feel the need to nerf? All guns are decent and the gadget really isnt op. There are worse global gadgets.

It looks like he's taking a cartoon step, one of those really exaggerated long steps

If you lean/crouch spam and you still die you need to actually just delete the game

Maverick. 
---
I read it with no issues. Screw that guy. 
---
I'm not 100% sure. I mostly play Console and rarely play PC but I would assume in the graphics between the lowest and highest. Possible that the sights are just wonky due to a patch note and you never realized until now.
---
Hah I love these, I had no idea the 556XI was such a trainwreck.

That works too! I just set a noise gate in discord and have my mic channel always open.

I believe it is already in the game files. Shows up as

---
Globals don’t belong in Siege that’s why most of them are getting a rework.
---
You forgot the goddamn drugs
---
No, it was through the shield at least from this perspective. Probably just client-side /desync issues. The defender likely didn't have the shield facing him on his end and so he shot him. Would like to see if there were packet loss/ping indicators on OP's end when he approached the window but the video is of the killcam, not gameplay and atrociously zoomed in.
---
It might just be that maverick was the only character I picked though
---
Are you referring to the “snapping” peak? 
---
I think it would be needlessly complicated since when you shoot through a wall it makes a ln actual hole unlike csgo
---
Cause dink’s is for people who aren’t cheating cucks.

Blitz. Just feels like no skill was involved when a Blitz kills me
---
Lol
---
Обычка, что поделать
---
Ubisoft inadvertently caused this when they took out the input/output sound options in the uplay launcher. I've had a lot of friends have problems all of a sudden when using discord and uplay. I wonder if starting one before the other in a particular order would help?
---
It's typically not those that run a coordinated team or that play at high-levels that hate it, it's the lower skill or solo-queue players. I'm not a high-level player, but I play with a coordinated squad and I've noticed that it takes a coordinated squad to attack that site, but it doesn't require one to defend it.

i think he might be saying that he sees people using no recoil macros. but who knows i just read a cav post and I legit want to put a gun in my mouth rn

Yes because R6 definitely made up all those things and didn’t base them on anything existing

They need John wick in Rainbow Six his special ability is killing everyone automatically at the start of a round.

Mwahaha I got it while it was instore &gt;:)

It's illegal to use a recoil macro and will be punished. BattleEye isn't flawless but it's one of the best anti-cheats out there. It'll happen in due time. 
---
This post is cringe. 
---
You’re bitching about an overpowered operator getting nerfed and then calling out everyone that has an opinion on the matter. 
---
The MP5 nerf sucks for body shots sure, however I’m not sure if you realize but in this game, it’s one shot headshot and the MP5 holds 31 rounds. 
---
You realize parabellum is a type of gun right? I doubt the name was taken from siege
---
They need to stop doing that! It's pissing me off! Even on console they do that with fucking scuf controller! Fuck these people

All I'm saying is that it's hard to imagine that the movie would have still been called Parabellum if there wasn't a proven entertainment financial success story right nearby doing the same thing in another medium.

WTF was that! I love it.

Not the only, my friend!

Alibi: Why you bully me, everyone asking
---
Yeah but it was rarely done in S1 cause everyone played much slower. Maps were new. People were far more defensive.

No it isn’t, John wicke is much bigger than R6 and parabellum is just Latin for “prepare for war”.

P.S., the first thing that shows up when you search parabellum is John wicke

Killcams take too long to give out callouts. If you got killed through a wall you have to wait for the killcam to come up, then watch it to give your callout

was this before or after Cav nerf?
---
It was absolutely ridiculous when these guns had no recoilC the game was no fun, vigil mains forgot they had a primary weapon, dokkaebi did the same, sledge was a SMG11 character, hibana was a bearing 9 character. Was not fun to play and I’m glad it’s gone 
---
Thanks, I made them myself
---
Ya it’s even worse on console with the mnk users 
---
Use the extended barrel and grip with a holographic. That's what I use and it works most of the time. Shields exist sadly. But I find it godly, but it does take a little time to master, but just aim for the torso and recoil will either take you to the head or for me I can usually just drop em on the 2nd shot. And if I can handle the recoil on a PS4 very well than you probably can too.
---
If you already have someone playing wine cellar, which you fucking should, they can hold all those angles from a pixel peak under the barrel. Problem: solved
---
I personally enjoy being able to leave casuals randomly. I also play league of legends which does punish you for leaving a game even a lobby you can’t leave. Imagine you can already tell your team will troll you but you can’t leave because you get punished. (To be fair the punishment is sort of minor but still a nuisance if you don’t have a second account) I think they should maybe introduce a new game mode type that has a ranked system of playing (ranked maps, choosing of spawns, etc) but not be able to leave it without punishment but no actually affect on your rank mmr. 
---
I can see you. There is a little flicker of black (probably your head) so he shot. He is holding a pixel angle. 
---
someones triggered
---
This logic of flawed because it doesn't take into account the fact that people are aiming for the head.  It only applies in completely random shooting occurrences.
---
r/prequelmemes is leaking 
---
Hmmm ok i guess.
---
ive done my job,welcome to reddit 
---
Yeah that's True
---
What did they say about it?
---
Never.
---
Still a dumb idea. I can see why they would not want to show the attachments so you can tell if you look long enough but all this is doing is preventing people from buying skins for her. They're only losing money from this.
---
High silver low gold is the average for the game, most people will get placed here in their placement matches.
---
Gold is average, the higher into gold you go, the better you are.
---
The SMG is just amazing and the gadget is very useful when you want to waste attackers time.
---
I get them to work really well (its harder but its possible) at uniform height, like i said it all depends on the site and the team youre up against, as well as how often you and the other team have picked kapkan. 
---
this gives me life
---
pass those plates around! 
---
Well I'm ~level 52 now and I'm about to the point of feeling comfortable actually playing ranked, even though I almost never play ranked even on Xbox. But I can't play Xbox anymore I suck too much now with a controller
---
I’m not a big fan of the sas-g myself, I think of it as a slightly meme-ish gun, on a similar tier to the m870 besides using it unironically with tachanka. Also, when not finka boosted it has a large amount of recoil, and I’m not very good with recoil control but I know some people are.
---
Fair enough you may squeak out a win a few times without reinforcing. But I would still HIGHLY recommend you reinforce, you have plenty of time to reinforce and run away and place your shit, if you prioritize you can place outer window and doorway traps first, and inner doorway and window traps next.

After some research I definitely came to the conclusion Ubisoft needs to rework the game to actually work. And I mean rework everything. Maybe they can bring in the Dice team since they seem to actually fix game glitches when they come out and sometimes the first week. Like if Ubisoft made a patch for something the first week it came out that'd be a record for them!
---
It's too powerful. People would see a clone and think it's the real one because of the outfit. Something like that IIRC.
---
This makes me SOOOO HAPPY
---
What does "Bulletproof" mean to you
---
Tried it for the first time, came up against a blitz and a monty. Got the blitz and left the monty on low health but I died. Seems pretty solid though.
---
Now there’s a bunch of downvotes from shield mains or people who think I am a bot

I was like what’s going on in this photo and then I bust out laughing
---
It still counts as destroying a team gadget and you see like -10 points to the right of the screen
---
it do be like that sometimes
---
I'm still a bit fuzzy on this. are the defenders "terrorists" or is a training sim canonically and we are actually just using rubber bullets and such?
---
Good fricking job my guy
---
I'm going to see this on amino now.  
---
Thanks me.
---
HEY GUYS IT HAS THE SAME WORD IN IT, GET IT????? PARABELLUM HAHAHHAHAH
---
You find me one, because i pretty much never use it unless its 3rd round defense, on like bakery on kafe doystevsky, but that rarely happens for me.
---
Spas 12 is probably my 3rd favourite. Especially combined with valk cams and roaming
---
IDK. That gun does 120 something damage so that could be it. You were a 1 armor. 
---
Would a low budget doc be a heroine addict?

Can you stop fucking down voting for no reason. There is no reason to down vote.

That’s not the problem, it’s that this guy is obviously not copper. He’s using a smurf account to play with lower ranked players and ruin their games for upvotes. Cancer. 
---
Yes.  My mistake.  Dots Per Inch.  Thanks for the correction.
---
Really because im not the one asking for a bullet proof tank for a defender cam so don't tell me 2 get good two run outs are a great thing its fun getting ur favorite attacker then some fag like u hops out and gets u in spawn 2 seconds into the match while u sit there and watch ur team ya fun

This is dumb. Putting the attachments on the hologram might make her a bit stronger because it would be harder to tell the difference between a real and a fake, but just using the default skin gets past the problem of her holograms not changing skin also. Ubi is just losing money from not giving the holograms the same skins, as having skins on Alibi leaves you at a disadvantage.
---
I want to thank you for your service 
---
Lol, guess we r going back to parabellum
---
Well it could be reddit's video quality but trust me. He aimed way to high to hit my shoulder and probably to high for my head aswell.
---
3, Super 90, GSH-18(garbage Russian pistol), and SASG-12
---
The spas 12 has slightly less fire rate and more drop off I’ve noticed, also I like frost as an operator better so it tend to lean towards that.
---
TIME FOR SOME SERIOUS PROTECTION
---
Smoke is revealed as part german. Gets gas chamber operator elite skin
---
Yep.. strange isn't it 
---
Oh god one shields bad but two? My god I'm sorry for you. But try it maybe not against a operator with one.
---
It's not bad, but it's not great. The top floor is really awkward and there are too many rooms. However, I do like defending and attacking the basement and first floor bombsites.
---
The new maps are certainly not ugly.  But they are confusing as hell and nearly impossible to learn for casual players.
---
&gt;I need to quit at least 3 casual matches before I end up on a map that I consider passable.
---
Fuck you OP.
---
I gotta disagree with your idea. It seems like it'd be nice in thought, but implementing this would pretty much make lean unusable, aside from holding an angle. It's not unrealistic for someone to quickly come through a door while leaning.
---
LOOOOOOL PARABELLUM LOOOOOOL GET IT??????????
---
You have nailed it. Tactically advantageous positions are put at a disadvantage to sprint around the corner and shoot. That's why I can't wait for Insurgency:Sandstorm to drop on PS4. 
---
incorrect. 
---
I think he hit you. You could be looking at the recoil but it looks like he was dead on to me. 
---
Ok this is the one time I'm happy I play on console.
---
I'm not following
---
Theres already a broken part of the roof that honestly I thought was openable. Maybe they should make it so you can open that.
---
I bet your the kind of player that tbags and tkills when they take ur op
---
What's the punchline here? I don't get it
---
You're a tool.
---
The other cameras get impacts of bullets in them
---
Dang. I had no idea.
---
When your roaming you should prioritize traps near obj first since youre probably gonna return to site late in the round, where itll be hard as fuck to get a trap down, or not at all cause you died. So site first, outer areas second. And thats how most people to traps when they roam.
---
It’s not actually that much of a nerf bc she’s gonna b batter at long range
---
# STOP
---
HAMMER TIME
---
Hmm then I think we dont agree with each other ^^
---
A lot of people seem to like the m1014 but having tried it I really struggled to get a kill with it, whether it’s high drop off or just low stopping power overall, it doesn’t really work with my play style.
---
Genius
---
It's more like I'm always in too much of a rush to precisely get uniform height and as long as I get it on the side and the general height I want, I'm good.  
---
The nice thing about Kapkan is how much you can vary your play throughout the match. The same site can have a dozen different combinations of traps leading to it
---
I DARE YOU 
---
I thought it was VR or something. The actual terrorists are in the PvE mode.
---
No I don't but I will do a run out and I will do a spawn peak because that is part of the game I don't care if somebody takes an operator that I want I don't care if somebody team kills me I'm not going to do its back
---
The c1 isn’t bad either
---
OP have you ever seen woman's leg? 
---
Yeah okay, what about the people who weren't the two involved in that kill?
---
One reason I’m glad I’m not on pc I suppose. Y’all are too hardcore for me. I’m trying to have fun

Reinforce, OBJ traps, run away, outside traps.

---

---
Lmao aight. Thanks for not being a toxic asshole. I enjoy actual conversatios. Gl with hitreg. 
---
Siege has been like this since release so not sure what you mean by "anymore." The peeker has always had an advantage.
---
Because they’re low rank
---
U r saying probably so you are admitting that you can be wrong. He held a pixel angle and hit you in the head most likely
---
Only when you die mid round. Not the end of round replay.
---
Can we get this cross-posted to r/prequelmemes 
---
nice i have it for mp5 too also the revolver
---
Unless the attacker communicates correctly/ pushes with a teammate. Cav is the solo crusher but kinda useless in a team v team setting.
---
yes he does, but you suggest any sort of change on this sub and people will whine about it 
---
Honestly they should completely remove casual as a whole. If everyone who plays it just leaves or tk’s it shouldn’t be in the game period. It’s not good for the game and I absolutely kills the reputation for the game. Keeps new players from enjoying the game etc. 
---
in my honest opinion if Ubisoft would revamp terrorist hunt, fixe ranked, take it out of beta, fix the game, and remove casual this game would possibly be able to revive its reputation. It’ll cater to the ones who want to take the game competitively 
---
But of course take leaving a match out of the game completely
---
Man for starters I just want the fucking sound glitch fixed. I’m tired of not hearing guns shooting, fuse charges are silent, everyone has cav’s silent step. It’s annoying

Right because changing this is going to make it harder. /s

If anything changing the current function or removing it would make it worse.

John Wick only gets headshots

This happens so frequently. Some ppl are just toxic. Idk why you haven't seen it but people will just kick you for no ***good***  reason. But even if you have a shitty KD (like me), you don't deserve this. It's Casual for crying out loud.

It’ll most likely be revealed at the invitationals next month.

and no ones going to because you dont put in that effort which is fine.

Nah I understood what you were saying I was just adding to what you said. Like just because you aren’t good at the game doesn’t mean an op is OP
---
And you haven't won a round all game, this season or even a year!

I love this SOOO much! My sister and I are are the types to flip each other off instead of saying I love you. (We also stick our tongues out at each other as a formal greeting.) I know this isnt exactly what they're doing but it made me think of my sister lol. Also, Ela main ftw. My sis would def. main Zofia if she played. (:

The second I saw that thing in Russian Badger's video I needed it.

100%. dying to an operator rather than a player is crazy infuriating

For those wondering, it's about 19.50€ / $22.70 / 17.50£. Much cheaper than what I thought tbh. Is it good quality op?

Disliked for toxic smurfing. Ruining the game for actualy low ranked players.
---
You can also look up r6 stat tracker on google, it's a way better way than in-game because it has graphs and other things pertaining to your skill with an operator.
---
That's why you name yourself this way i reckon, for this moment !

Should be banned.. His videos comes up once in a while.
---
Eh, the lore of this game isn't super strictly defined outside of character bios. It was never explicitly confirmed nor was it ever denied so I suppose it's up to the audience to decide.. Either way in whatever universe it took place, be it the real one or some bizarro timeline, it was something that happened in the "real world", not in training or some kind of sim, so my point still stands.

Well silver isn’t good. I’m not shitting on you, but ranked gets a lot better when you’re in high gold to plat. Just give it some time.

Video doesn't show if OP sat there for 1-2 minutes waiting to load.  Based on how fast the vote happened, I would bet everyone else was kicking him just to get the game to start.  They were ready to kick him before seeing anything about him.

Just stand on a mute jammer if this is a blitz issue

A Biltz runs at you, what do you do?

A Blitz runs at you and does that? Prepare to die twice.

Having hit Plat 2 and then been immediately smacked back down to Gold 1, I can say that this is accurate

Well played, however, it was your only option. I'm following your steps. 
---
I love the comics, however I don't enjoy all the crappy 3 and 4k clips that crowd out genuine content.
---
This dude really not giving up💀
---
Its no nearly as wild as you would think on their end, so that why they can still aim well. 
---
Shouldn't be happening either way
---
Sounds about right
---
Uhhhh.....wtf lol
---
Inb4 thousands of losers downvote and report you for posting a minor facial glitch you found funny
