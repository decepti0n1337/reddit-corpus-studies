Okei i just looked up pictures online and its grey, but i see how it can be interpreted as white. Its a good job nonetheless

Firstly just got caught up in the moment, and my friend recorded it on his phone to send it via snap chat to me. And as for me I could have record it from my pov, but nothing was happening from my pov.
---
Nah you were just kidding and the other guy over reacted
---
[removed]
---
well this is really the only instance where it's good because you were at point blank for most of the time
---
Sorry, I misread your question as first. But I've seriously done this many times and for some reason people just don't anticipate on someone going up that stairs. Especially within 30 seconds. So usually it's fine by just going up there yourself.
---
Oh he did, don't worry, and yes I said He purposely
---
Same people are actually banning clash now god forbid the enemy pick the person with the worst win rate
---
But it‚Äôs gotta be his codename. Sal Vulcano isn‚Äôt a very good op name
---
The thing is, lots of ppl don't use a mic
---
That‚Äôs definitely a women, and Dokkabei or whatever not vigil.

Okay so after the snapchat video was sent he could've literally pressed a combination of two buttons. It's not that hard.

Love it

Yeah, sure dude. Pm me.

Didn‚Äôt even notice them on the top pic lol

I can't tell you how many aces I probably have gotten without recording

Nokk has awful guns because if she had better guns she'd be broken, They tried her with an assault rifle in early testing and apparently according to its_Epi she was way too strong even when they removed it's ACOG.
---
Here's why neither new operator got new guns

I‚Äôm not saying she should have other guns, just saying as a whole she simply isn‚Äôt worth brining into a round

With 2 free packs, ive got uniform and headgear for Rook.

C'mon don't hate on us dude, I doesn't know how to record, and we just got caught up in the moment. I don't even know why I have to justify myself xD

A bandit tricked the charge off the wall when he threw the EMP. The Thermite killed Thatcher thinking the EMP destroyed it. So I *kinda* get it....
---
Fucking Shamans are everywhere
---
Last time I threw a nitro it 50cm and blue my team mate up. 
---
Yeah I'll stick to my deployable shield and my evil eyes.
---
Oops haha
---
Your clip shows literally nothing.
---
you won't be able to. *maybe* Microsoft will let you but Sony definitely won't
---
It‚Äôs the same chance as any other epic item. Most people just like how Black Ice looks compared to other skins
---
3* and some old guy
---
Yeah, you're a pretty unhinged.
---
Ironically, you're being this hardass "behind a screen".
---
No reloads lol
---
Nokk is strong against opponents that rely too much on cameras. You have to know how and when to play her.
---
Lol are you high? Have you never seen the IQ glitch?
---
r/woooosh ?
---
Unfortunately there is almost zero button customization on console unless you buy an elite controller
---
Nowhere am I hating or calling anyone out. I'm just asking why people don't use it. Its a funny vid nonetheless.
---
That's some dark plaguis the wise secrets
---
Nah bc there are people who are balanced with th gun they have, and there would be a bunch of people tking twitch for her f2
---
If only you could Crushing counter bullets.
---
AHHH ah bada Bing abata boom
---
Cool as hell, but how would glaz's gun or buck's gun work. Also, unbalanced as fuck
---
No you would probably get people tking to get weapons of their team
---
the guys u were fighting were garbage
---
As a literally anyone else in this game main, fuck you.
---
It's okay, we just didn't think about it, I'm sorry
---
Again, for losing your alpha packs or anything like that, restart the game, it‚Äôs a common solution.
---
I kinda feel like if u played playboi carti kid cudi over it it‚Äôll be a lil better
---
Well she clearly wasn't invisible, and Ubi doesn't ban for abusing glitches regardless. You're not going to achieve anything from posting this here.

---
Nice throw!

No r.i.p

Feel free to add it xD
---
PC gaming for the lose
---
You like to watch people burn? Use Maverick or Capitao
---
That's why you get a 5 stack. Posts like this are so stupid, it's a team based game and people are crying about soloqing.
---
Very nice
---
oof, this hasn't happened to me yet. Mav's AR15 is a pain in the OOF with iron sights
---
Play bomb only, secure area has all the toxic fucks
---
Nokk comes in handy for those who sit on cameras.
---
I‚Äôd preorder that instantly
---
Now my friend, this is how it feels to be a man

They're all born the same year, Joe looked old to begin with but he's aging the best now. Plus, that dudes got a hot af wife and giant dick energy

So basically the whole game was like this, when we were on attack there was no lag at all during prep phase and tons of lag during game while they always spawnpeeked us instantly. Then when we went of defense it switched up and this happened, I was skeptical at first that it was even possible to make others lag but there's too many coincidences in the full match for it to be chance. I have the full match recorded if that helps I'll upload it.

Both Next Gen consoles are already confirmed to be backwards compatible with current gen games. Likely the games will get a "Next Gen Enhanced" Patch so if the game is run on the new systems they get some graphical enhancements. Just like how many games got a graphical enhancement patch for the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X.

I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs good but I can‚Äôt afford her

Best of 1's aren't fair, and people would just cheat.

Okayy did that and problem solved dude..thanks everyone

tbh there should be an operator with a fukn wolf or German Shepard

I switched to pc from ps4. With roughly 250 hours on pc, I‚Äôve been once maybe twice for stupid shit like this. They just spam shit talk in chat mostly in my experience

I play on Xbox and this rarely if ever happens to me in solo que really never they only time is when there just loading into a game and you joined causing the game load time to increase

Knives too. They are literal spoons with the reach of planks length.

Honest to god, it‚Äôs a console thing. It‚Äôs happened to me on PC once outta the two years I‚Äôve played it, and I was on console for longer than that. Console is generally a more toxic place.
---
Its really not all that bad. It fits its niece of very close range well. Same can be said for the smg11 and bearing 9
---
Tight angles as in where you‚Äôre barely peeking out and you can barely see them?

XDDD

Its meant for point blank

That is fucking clean honestly

Sometimes I like to play casual without getting buttfucked by a whole team of plat 1 people. I understand it's caual but ffs

These guys about to drop the sickest album

Fr machine pistols serve their intended purpose of close range very well now

Excuse me where is your manager?

Your still doing a good job tho

He bought all season passes

But you flaired it useful so

Depends on what your problem is

Whenever I peek for a second to throw a nitro I immediately get gunned down. In my time playing this game I've finally reached the point of just not running nitro cells on anyone anymore since they never do anything. I'm around level 100 and I still don't even have that 10 nitro cell kill achievement.
---
I, didn‚Äôt do shit tf?
---
Well it auto did then üòÇ

It was a filthy slopfest but at the end of the day. I pulled a double ‚Äúace‚Äù comeback. Just saying

Sheriffs v gang

How can a meme be so generic
---
They should do what fortnite does, in mobile if you use a controller then it puts you in console servers and lobbies, and in console if you use mnk you are put into PC servers and lobbies
---
N√∏kk is the most recent addition that is perfect for this. Sledge is somewhat silent as well when he breaches. Maverick can sometimes enter in a sight undetected by going though a crouch hole made from his torch. Using a suppressor on his M4 (if you can handle the recoil) is really beneficial.
---
Oh thought u did my B lol
---
Try r6tms. But tbh id just play ranked until your stack can consistantly stay in plat b4 u start worrying about tourneys
---
That's really not how this works...
---
You don‚Äôt have to worry about grenades now.
---
Well every level would be too much. A new player would get around 10-20 alpha packs in an hour...  
---
Maybe if it starts out slow, and then as the player reaches level 100, the game would give an aplha pack for every level.
---
Great idea, but too similar to Doki
---
dude, use grammar so we can read it
---
Hey you ever heard of a period?
---
I have the same issue. Even tried deleted and reinstalling again. Still have the issue.

Iron sights are pretty useful depending on the sights(real life not the game)

Holy fuck that‚Äôs crazy ! Yeah 20 more bucks would‚Äôve got you everything. I had to purchase it directly from ubi
---
Because they're legendary. The entire point of legendary skins is so that the operators don't look the same as the lower tier skins.
---
When you're used to the completely superior gameplay of pc, seeing stuff like this and calling it a good play or clip is pretty hilarious
---
I don‚Äôt understand ):

I know you were level 4 in this and you're probably better now but this is cringe lol

That's okay, I'll just never bring back my computer at my parents place XD

Good shit my dude

You looked really calm here lol

Going back to Christmas 2015 I know the attacker was thermite as I always thought his ability was useful and I think my defender was Kapkan as I thought a cheeky instakill would be able to turn the tide then I know I got all 4 SAS ops
---
Good for you. have a nice night.
---
If you look at the buttons on the bottom it looks like hes playing on console so it would technically be pressing in the right stick

Of course not

If he ever brags about diamond, just literally laugh in his face and let him know how cringeworthy he‚Äôs being lmao

I got to level 100 on Xbox and now 143 on PC and I still suck ass. I don't know what to do to get better. My reaction time is awful and I can't control recoil for the life of me. To make matters worse I have a really hard time acquiring targets and most of the time I can't see someone cause they blend in to the background. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong and why I'm not getting better. I just want to be good at something for once.
---
Threw one of my little brothers toys at it
---
I try my best c:
---
That's a crock of bull and you know it it's been factually proven through research done by countless people that and and even skill level a player on console using a controller when they are experienced against players who use mouse and keyboard can keep up.
---
 What you are pushing is blatant misinformation because you are an elitist who's trying to  Pretend that playing on PC makes you better than anyone when in all actuality anyone in a higher skill tear on consul would beat you easily anyone even with you would be able to play on par and the only time you would ever really decimate someone unless you're having a really good day is if they were of a lower skill to people like you make PC gaming look bad.
---
 You're not worthy of the title of a gamer and quite frankly you just need to make yourself feel like you're better than someone for no reason whatsoever it's disgusting and you should get over such childish crap
---
her traps are pretty visible, but her traps are used to delay defenders and open up easy kills. so having them out in the open in general, is just stupid
---
Yeah, definitely seems weird if anything. Did the players wanted to leave or was the org just moving away from rainbow?
---
I quit that game because it‚Äôs trade fortress 2, and it can get very dangerous with the gambling

Nah I didn‚Äôt know how to do stuff Back than it‚Äôs aight

No big deal it's just I've been seeing it a lot on Reddit lol
---
K&amp;M users tend to have much smoother camera movements than that of a controller
---
Well not exactly I threw a toy at it
---
Even without the nitros this is in favour of the defenders. One just needs to defuse while the others aim at Monty and wait for him to drop his shield.

Me too bruh if it‚Äôs with friends sure

Thanks for letting me know!!!

Not going to source the original artist?

A couple days ago I saw a cheater that was literally running like a roadrunner. He had a 7.1 K/d diamond and level 45.... why the f didn‚Äôt Ubisoft didn‚Äôt ban him? I mean.... level 45, that means he has like 40 hours or more in the game..

Yeah I think ubi just assumes operators being on crack is fine

That‚Äôs absolute bs it would raise the toxicity to a whole new level. What we need is to queue 4/5 stacks against other 4/5 stacks

Tbh, i have no problem with smurf. The main issue that bothers me is the squad with 3 high ranks and 2 coopers. That boost bothers me, not the smurf

It doesn't do that, the worse it will do is add you in between rounds. It has never in my experience put someone in a game once the selection phase of match point.

I regret looking through your comment history
---
Tachanka and Monty
---
I thought they looked cool
---
My other comments are completely separate conversations that had absolutely nothing to do with this one.  Over half of them I was literally just messing with someone.
---
 The fact that you actually have to go check my other comments tells me that you are running out of arguments and you just don't want to admit that I am right and were looking for a way to insult me.  Everyone uses that tactic it doesn't work.  You could and should also stop misusing the vote system and down voting me because the down vote is not a disagree button.
---
 You're very clearly getting upset if you weren't you wouldn't have said that you weren't going to reply to me but then continued to do so or checked my comment history.  Telling him to up his sensitivity is not going to improve his game play experience at all it's just you whining that you don't like how his player if anything is going to ruin his gameplay experience

It‚Äôs not allowed. Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt own the servers that host our MP games. Microsoft does. All R6 servers run from Microsoft Azure Cloud data centers. Preventing DDoS attacks falls on Microsoft unfortunately, and doing that is incredibly complicated. You can‚Äôt just click an option that says ‚Äúprevent DDoS‚Äù and expect that not to have a serious effect on our ability to connect and play. 
---
That being said orchestrating DDoS attacks is a crime and eventually if you roll the dice enough times it‚Äôs going to come up snake eyes.

Yeah, don‚Äôt be the Ash that is ‚Äúall aim no brain‚Äù and use your information gathering skills to the best of their ability. Getting kills isn‚Äôt the only way to win this game so always have the mindset of playing the objective. If you can kill everyone before doing so, great, but if you are struggling to get some of them the the best bet is to help your team get the objective done and defend them. That is the beauty of this, the reality is you don‚Äôt have to kill a single person to win the round. Realistically you do kill some people but in the end focusing on playing the objective rather then getting all the kills will help you win.
---
Maybe a smurf? Or did they just use trait up hacks in the game?
---
Boy your enemies must be hot garage if you can snipe em with that thing. The spread isn't small thought, it's one of the biggest for semi auto shotguns. The extended barrel barely does anything though, you'd have to watch Rogue's video to see. It's partly a placebo. In the end it's a shotgun and sometimes you can snipe someone 30 feet away and other times someone survives a mag in the face. It's like that for all shotguns, not just Ela's.
---
meh i don't really care about packs, i don't even look at the roll or percentage usually and just notice it in the main menu.

it's just some neat free shit now and then, and mostly trash anyway. i think that's the main thing you'd need to realise, there's nothing in the packs that's worth getting frustrated over. but i do understand it.

I would say it's better to have help from your team if they are near the objective. Having 2 people on the other side of the map to kill roamers is pointless and waste of time. I'm in high plats/diamonds and rarely I see people go to the other side of the map to hunt roamers in pairs.
---
Black ice is good
---
As for tips from me, I advise two things with peaking. The first is to know when to peak at the right time. Using your intel to find out where enemies are, and understanding that they could come from other angles, and peaking at the correct one that would be best to peak. Don‚Äôt try to peak something that attackers could already be peaking. You can try to make them stop by using your Grzmot as a flash bang.
---
And the second tip is be patient. Hold an angle if it‚Äôs the only one thats there, and you‚Äôre confident that no one else can see you, and hold that angle, and wait. You may need to move, and you will know when to, but if you want to stop attackers from coming through a doorway, the best thing to do is hold it.
---
Now as for YouTube tips, I advise watching two. This one by [Coreross](https://youtu.be/1NTf2A0Y8dM), and this one by [Rouge-9](https://youtu.be/vfoztlTIyGE). They give insight to perspectives, and try to show you what the best way to peak is. It‚Äôs on the topic of perspectives as a problem, but they do say what the best way to peak is.

Agree, the worst thing in that is that you can't rejoin the match. So your saying that the problem might be linked to an obsolete version of BattlEye ?
---
Or just deagle. If you can use the iron sights, the deagle is a reliable two shot kill, and the added speed advantage is also nice

---
And that‚Äôs why you always go back door
---
What are you Talking about? You haven‚Äôt made this
---
This has happened to me a few times now, really annoying.
---
Right now I‚Äôm a Montaigne/Kapkan player so I don‚Äôt really know if that‚Äôll help with finding a decision on which of the 4 to choose. I‚Äôve actually been playing for a good while but I‚Äôm limited on how often I play because of horrible internet connections where I live. Right now I love both being a breacher and a trapper which is why I kinda narrowed it down to either Blackbeard or Frost. As for recoil over damage and such I‚Äôm aiming for a middle man between the two where I‚Äôm able to control the recoil to a certain degree while also having the ability to take out a player with less than 1/3 of my magazine. On attack I enjoy the idea of facing the unknown on objective while on defense I really enjoy the suspense of waiting for the enemy to come to you.
---
Bandit is much better at destroying drones
---
But as a defender you rely on your cams and call outs. As an anchor holed up in obj you wanna know where the attack is coming from and Nokk can throw that off because she can‚Äôt be seen on cameras. Sure she can‚Äôt rush you or storm in, but she can pick off unsuspecting anchors or roamers who can‚Äôt gauge her exact position. I feel she‚Äôs more of a support role, an anti roamer or someone who helps the backline of a offensive push. 
---
A good example is Thermite is placing his breach charge on the wall. The roamer sees it on cams next room over and goes to for the kill not knowing Nokk was standing right there watching his back. She‚Äôs best utilized as a support for your breachers or protecting the diffuser once placed.

Cops and robbers is the current event. It‚Äôz supposed to be a cops vs robbers shootout in the wild, wild west. I would love to see a ‚Äúboss fight‚Äù gamemode where one person is randomly selected(with preferences, obviously) and has increased health, armor, and cameras but has to protect a area from the attackers, which would have decreased health but be far more plentiful(was thinking like 1v8-10 or something to make it somewhat balanced.
---
Interesting choice to teabag that first kill. You basically got better RNG.
---
lol.
---
Oh yea
---
Alibi
---
I honestly don't consider her getting an ACOG a good enough of a buff , especially when your character is based around getting close around corners and lurking .
---
But the only reason why I want them to increase the damage is due to rook and the fact that she's an attacker , defenders have the advantage of the first shot therefore they get lower damage , since her weapon was supposed to be an AR apparently , Ubisoft seems like they thought it's too OP and they gave her this shit weapon as a last second act .
---
Giving Her the MP5SD seems like it's just the same thing over , yes it's silenced without consequences but honestly it's still not enough , it's really the damage , I get that she's anti roamer and not am entry fragger but once you have took against you that 20% increased damage resistance becomes scary , you need to shoot players like Caveira 5 (30-20% = 24)times at an 800 RPM with a gun that doesn't even have an angled drop to help you shoot first .
---
And if rook was in fact the way it was planned to indirectly counter her , at least make 3 speeds still be 4 shotable to make her effective against roamers at least , which can be done by raising the damage to 32 .
---
And if that somehow makes smoke powerful and even he needs a weapon buff , give her the MP7 which is honestly considered as a very great weapon .
---
Yeah basically me as well ...
---
It helps to just press random every round (casual) to force yourself to play all characters. I don't feel I have a main beyond the ones that have a well known advantage.

Unpopular? lol

If you really want to grind, play some T-Hunt and learn the maps just a little bit and learn to aim for the head well. Then you just have to dive in and get your ass beat a couple of times, it will get much more fun. Watch youtubers and their strats and learn what works and doesn't. Once you learn the map well, and you can aim, then everything will settle in.   
---
Basic tips though, are aim for the head, choose easy operators at first (Ash/Zofia or Jager/Rook). Make sure to use your utilities when necessary. Most importantly, communicate with your team, you can let them know you are new, and use callouts when you can. The name of rooms is at the bottom of the camera screens.

How's your cat doing btw? I followed your updates about him and hadn't seen anything for awhile.

Lesion is hands down the most powerful and oppressive defender in the game.

it's not getting funny dude

He should have the option to light it manually w zippo then

Have you heard of this guy called Thatcher?

They used to give a free 1 day booster at the start of every season why did they stop

Yeah. I don‚Äôt know anyone that says lesion is bad.

Thatcher dont need nerf he is ok its juat mute that is op af lmao

A persona meme on shitpost rainbow?? I never saw that coming.

I did something similar twice. One time he didn't blind me and I got the killing shot on his feet before he could melee me. The other time I knifed his shield while blinded and then again while I could see to be able to kill him.

Your next achievent should be figuring out how to take a screenshot

If its PC go to ubisoft acc settings and change the user name there and then switch your main to the smurfs name
---
Hibana in A, Capitao and Thatcher in B. I think they should all be at least one rank higher (Thatcher should be S).Hibana can open three hatches, only one operator can counter that and the counter itself can be countered. Thatcher is one of the most useful operators in the game. One real counter and to stop that just don‚Äôt throw them randomly. Capitao is incredibly useful for plant and post-plant. You can deny half of the fuse time by timing the fire bolts, you can smoke on a surface instead of having them land on the floor which means better coverage, you can completely cut off rotations while you plant and even outside of those times, you can flush out positions and even if you can‚Äôt see them, with coordination you can push them into your teammates.
---
Did you loose a ranked match again?

Bruh, you got me good

Hibana cause her guns are medicore and you need 2 uses of her gadget which she gets 3 of to breach fully. Beaides that she is just a flashy maverick

Nice one mate, normally my squad tosses an impact, or a Mira about there, and our 3 armors will try and hold that. Definitely a good angle not a lot of people are able to hit a pixel prefire so your relatively safe.

I‚Äôm gold II
---
Jager was just wearing his gaming socks
---
Glaz is indeed useless and iq is unusable rn aka useless. Loin isn't close to as good as he use to. Zofia is one of the best ops in the game and all the pros and casual pkayers would gladly tell you she belongs in s tier
---
He‚Äôs just the better player
---
With the season she becomes more powerfull, counters a lot.
---
adamcheshire14. Check my r6 tracker if you want details. Glaz is my most used and higjest k/d operator. Iq is there as a joke cause you litteraly cant use her so she is useless

Glaz is defenietly not useless, and you can't just put IQ on useless Because she's banned at the moment

depends on the weapon
---
Almost all of those ops are both very intelligent and excellent gun fighters. There is no way they wouldn‚Äôt be in team rainbow.
---
Also remember, the way the gadgets are used in game are completely different as to how they would be used in real life. For example, Fuze‚Äôs gadget would be used well before any other ops even entered the building. 
---
Also, saying ‚Äúall ops would have it‚Äù is not true. Real police and special forces units have assigned rolls. One person trying to carry all that equipment wouldn‚Äôt work. 1 person carrying holograms, Warden‚Äôs glasses, nokks gadget, Jackel‚Äôs headgear, Finka‚Äôs activator, and vigil‚Äôs gadget, on top of rook armor and two weapons and ammo, would crumble under the weight.

Pretty sure it depends on the rank of your opponents

Where is my boy Midget Mongoose Mozzie?

This actually looks good as hell and well made. Good shit!

I wonder now how many people are going to see this and try it

But you killed carrier? Did you end up leaving the defused?

I've already seen it in ranked multiple times. Last 20 seconds of the match trying to get a plant down and the enemy team starts doing it in team chat. By far the most easily abusable thing out there
---
Have you tried changing back the graphics settings to back to they were before you changed the refresh rate. And the sharpening might just be because the anti aliasing might also have gotten reset like the rest of the graphics settings.
---
These would be so nice but explaining it every time would get tire-some
---
Well this happened with Zofia and Ela, maybe next Operation they get their own counterparts!
---
Thanks! Here's a better look: https://imgur.com/LjX0XA9

I greatly appreciate this! Thank you so much! I got an ace yesterday so I can see how it‚Äôs like riding a bike but I still get kinda scared lol.

It's the game for poeple who aint speell two gud.

Thank you. :) &lt;3

It was probably just bad connection then from either you or the other player.

Annoying isn‚Äôt it, went into a game without even realising, and my ping was on like a 100 odd I was lagging everywhere haha

Consistently happened between him and I. So yeah guess it was probably him. Still shitty tho.

Thank you, friend! Negative Ghost Rider. I already mailed them to him. The material is wood PLA, so I printed with a pretty large layer height.

I'm the Vigil behind the Ela.
---
Haha, I'm not expecting an essay written response. I'm just sensitive about balancing in this game and took your post seriously.
---
When we are talking about "random recoil" every gun has random recoil, however the scorpion is one of the most severe for sure. When it comes to the scorpions other stats, its very average in terms of DPS, TTK and even range when you consider its ROF.
---
At the last position u were standing actually really valuable position, if you create a small hole on your behind u can see rotate of meeting hall
---
What kind of player are you? Solo/team | Fragger/support
---
Yikes.
---
It‚Äôs called casual for a reason, I‚Äôm not trying to be rude but you can‚Äôt be mad at this
---
Nokk or Mav. Don't know if there's any advantage over the others just like their abilities
---
This happened to me, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a joke calm your self
---
That one loser smh
---
I main blitz and i HATE when this happens. it makes me want to switch mains but OH IS BLITZ SO THRILLING WHEN YOU GET A 3k MELEE STREAK CLUTCH
---
Thottery shall not prevail
---
Yep
---
Is it good?
---
Do some situations, it will get to you, just play casual, newcomer is filled with smurfs that are tryhards
---
I have seen warden used effectively against Blitz once. A buff would be for it to auto active when it's needed but it doesn't shut off so it will stop the first flash or whatever but then you need it to cool down after the gadget time elapses. 
---
So a flashbang indicator comes up on your screen the gadget auto turns on for the 5 second period or whatever then it needs to cool down before it reactivates. But you can also do it manually for smokes etc.
---
Yeah that is crap but at least we need a matchmaking option to disable entering in ongoing matches
---
It‚Äôs just switching servers nothing banable about that, only banable if they stress the servers
---
It happens every single game though and it‚Äôs frustrating just to have a teammate dip just because he played bad a round
---
a hashtag for when you get nutty revolver headshots/kills
---
It you think that a game is not hard to finish just end the ongoing match that you joined, instead of complaining for it. A person could be busy, have a problem or something and could not rejoin but must get a penality? Definitely nah.

This isn‚Äôt Call of Duty or CS:GO... the point of siege is this dynamic of sieging a building, that is what the foundation of this game is built on. I personally don‚Äôt want to see this in the game for that reason alone, not to mention how the mechanics of this game would make that a nightmare, with the one shot headshots and all of that.

No place for a ‚Äúpeacekeeper‚Äù on team rainbow.

A spawn peak nightmare
---
People always complain about this but then as soon as pick and ban starts they instalock Jackal
---
Yikes.....
---
He revived in panic instead of shooting
---
Well if it‚Äôs the long range on attack you like any marksman rifle user works, if it‚Äôs ability I suggest warden or Ying. warden becomes able to see through smokes and flashbangs if standing still and Ying is immune to her own ability but can blind a whole room
---
Hate to break it to you. All though exclusive.  there are better skins then black ice.
---
I'd go into thunt to get the p90 recoil down especially if you use it often cuz it seems to have quite a kick when you use it. Also can you put a muzzle break on the p90 cuz I'm pretty sure that's the muzzle that reduces first shot recoil. Anyways good ace.
---
10/10 would bang that
---
Well no one is really like glaz, but kaid has a similar gun kinda on defense, and dokkiebbi has a pretty good dmr with smokes
---
Yeah I just noticed that in ranked.
---
But black ice, no matter how it looks, is THE SKIN to get from a pack
---
Thought you were gonna ace with that breach charge
---
This ain‚Äôt it chief. Already an op like this somewhat.
---
Ubi is still making money off of software sales, season passes, R6 credits, digital content, money only skins. They're doing just fine
---
&gt;There's nothing wrong with 40-50 ping Edit: check which server you are on when you first click the settings, if it's not your region you can go to the game files to change it but I don't know how to guide you to the file. Searching it up gets good results pretty quick. I've done it before so you won't mess up anything.
---
I am on the cus server
---
Well of course, but black ice is a skin that is considered rare and therefore is a way to show off a little bit. It‚Äôs not all about the looks anymore. For me I prefer the lifeline skin for Jager rather than black ice for his carbine.
---
Peekaboo
---
Same here, some gadgets will end up destroyed anyways, if I‚Äôm playing with my friends I‚Äôll mess around and shoot them but never when I‚Äôm playing with randoms, it‚Äôs just stupid and toxic to tk because of a gadget
---
Macros are a bannable offence if your asking
---
Because they have actual coordination drone decently so all it takes is a good position and you can still get easy picks as lion. (In pro league)
---
1. Get_Flanked is who got me off on a good start. Rogue-9 will always be good for statistical details of the game. VarsityGaming‚Äôs Siege School series is helpful as well. Beyond that, simply watching gameplay from creators like VarsityGaming and MacieJay can help you learn (just remember to play as well haha; simply watching the killcam after you get killed and understanding what happened is beneficial).
---
2. Didn‚Äôt really use site when getting into the game so I can‚Äôt help in this regard.
---
3.  I haven‚Äôt been as into Pro League lately, but I‚Äôve found TSM to be exciting. G2 has some great VODs to watch. Honestly, I would just recommend watching some current or recent stuff and find out who you like that way. Some players are phenomenal with specific ops. Necrox is great as Smoke and Redeemer is a great Echo.
---
Just remember that some of these tips that are given in older videos may be a bit outdated. But overall, they‚Äôll be helpful. Hope this helps and have fun getting into this game.
---
Zoom punch
---
Yeah for sure haha, as a twitch main I just laughed at the persons logic but oh well haha, it happens
---
Oregon and bank are the only sites ive seen him be good on
---
Perception üíØ
---
It's obviously a picture from your phone that you took of on your computer.

Agreed, plus we got a laugh out of it so all's good!
---
I‚Äôve been playing since velvet shell and I‚Äôm still gold 2 lol. Congrats tho, I wish I was that motivated
---
Oh my god they listened? I personally believe the recoil during chimera was good (and balanced) but it was the    Para bellum ( I think might be grim sky) was just too much for console players. But in cqc the things is a beauty to control because the player should easily be dead by the time 10 bullets are shot. I the gun is great if you burst it as much as 5 burst at a time at range but in extended ranges the gun suffers from too much per bullet recoil
---
We are glad to know that the issue is resolved.
---
Thank you for contacting us. Have a great day! :)
---
The one thing I'd say is that because the surface of most of them isn't very whole (eg, zofia's) I'd have said fill the gaps with an epoxy or resin of some kind. Still looks really fun!

When you still on part 1 of JoJo's and think the Zoom punch is the coolest thing you can do with Hamon

The difference is that Jackal and especially Cav require putting yourself at risk while doing so.

Huh

Omae wa mou shindeiru

I‚Äôll agree that he is ten times more effective in pl, but he is still strong in ranked.

Make sure your not hitting helmet ear muffs etc they don't count

My internet is pretty bad rn but I try to upload a video version later :D

peru and mexican

The smoke vision penalty for moving should probably be less severe, if not removed completely. It's already an ability with limited duration, a hard cooldown, and a 95% reactive-only utility (Because I suppose you could combo it with Smoke's gas, but that's a very niche use).
---
then it‚Äôs not too illogical. fuze is fun to play
---
I know, I just thought the username and op combo was funny lol
---
It has red dots for impacts and yellow dots for concussions
---
What i love the most about this mans art is that everything has a face

Yup, a few, but also a few black ice duplicates :(

like 10/11

Me too lol

I know, it's a joke
---
What your sensitivity at fam
---
I can agree with you on that, but words hurt...
---
If you land on someone it knifes them this time it was a bit delayed
---
Nah Jackal is very annoying tbh.
---
Are you okay? Or are you just unfamiliar with air jabs? Are you new to the game?
---
This is totally false. The pick ban works both ways for starters, and the pick ban does force people to adapt in new ways. Twitch and thatcher banned for some ungodly reason? Use IQ. Jack and Lion bans stopping you from countering roamers? Use Doke. Point is there are options outside your favorite and for the good of the community and game it‚Äôs important those ops are explored to keep the game fresh. Eventually the meta will shift and the current always ban ops will be played again.
---
True, but kd doesn‚Äôt reset every season, so you may have a shit kd from earlier, like my kd is 1.1 and I still hit diamond, it doesn‚Äôt really mean anything. There also other things to siege that mean more. Like I have games where I top frag but I feel the bottom fragger did just as much due to his calls, plays etc.
---
*Proceeds to shoot Mozzie's drone instead*
---
1. not diamond
---
2. casual has his own mmr.
---
They‚Äôre getting out played by a bronze 2 they‚Äôre trash
---
You keep the operators, skins and charms from the season pass but you lose the increased alpha pack chance and renown boost
---
I'll dm you it
---
Lion and Dokk arent? For both if them you literally have to stop what you are doing or be exposed either by pings, or by phone calls. Jackal can literally be lured into a trap easier.
---
To my knowledge, I believe there are no benefits. I always assumed it was designed to make gameplay more difficult.
---
Eh, they last a few seconds, Jackal lasts way longer.
---
I defend a company because they make great games that I love. My claim is common since. It wouldn't necessarily hurt them because as you said they make profit from other aspects but the way it is now does help them
---
Where is this menu? I cant find it! Btw. Congrats.
---
Thank you!
---
Dude if I knew how to play against a diamond I'd be diamond myself. Nice tips but not really helpful. Got clapped by one single diamond often enough to now it's just not worth the effort as it's also not fun at all.
---
Happy to help!
---
That‚Äôs like 5 wins if not more
---
‚Ä¢ yes, i support
---
- no, 2 hostages will be enough enough
---
-moving hostages is good idea, i support. But if hostage moved, both teams must know where is hostage. For example: cav takes hostage. Attackers don't know where is he. Cav dropes the hostage. Attackers know where he is again. So, i think it good idea.
---
- wtf? I didn't understand a word. Too hard. I understood, but it is too hard and illogal. It doesn't need change.

You press the right stick when you want to play ranked, and thank you!

False, OG Lion was clearly overpowered and needed a nerf, some guns are clearly monsters like the R4C or the mp4. When it comes down to it, if the player was clearly better then the pick ban shouldn‚Äôt matter
---
Thanks
---
What level are you?
---
I can‚Äôt play Ranked. Not because I‚Äôm banned from it, but because I fear me and my lag spikes will hinder and cripple my team
---
Thats like a free win my dude
---
Idk I was barely moving in this
---
You had final stand on
---
It used to happen every time I would sign on bout 2 years ago. The finally fixed it (I thought atleast)
---
Honestly, do you get your nut off to talking shit about him? I personally couldn't care if he died of an "OD". He played rainbow six siege and passed away, idgaf if it was substance abuse he still should be honoured and is honoured. There is no need to go around to every post about "BostonBearJew" and say "He DiEd Of A dRuG oVeRdOsE"
---
No. The defuser has completed the defusal cycle. The bombs are null and void. The attackers has won despite what casualties they have endured.
---
Yh I get that and anything positive in diamond is acceptable imo but if I saw a negative kd diamond I would rate him at all
---
You know you can download the clips right
---
Ela became a dude and iq was removed because of a big and is back in the game now
---
First off, I'm a low silver/high bronze open and let me tell you, jackal/dokk are better bans than lion for us nobodies. People at low ranks can't use that scan in a useful way at all, or if they can, I haven't seen it ever. And nobody bans him, so it's not like they never got the chance.
---
Secondly, what's the scoop with blackbeard at the high ranks? He's a pretty middling op ime, I'd like to know what the good strats are cause I play him from time to time, I didn't realize he was an issue
---
This is a game, not real life. (Or if you want to dable in technical hyperbole, real life does have pick and ban in the form of thing like the Lieber Code, the Hague Conventions, Genever Conventions, war crimes)
---
If you think pick/ban literally decides if you win/lose, then to quote you "thats on them, they need to ADAPT"
---
Besides, there is now multiple operators who have similar or transferable equipment, so pick and ban doesn't even deprive you of a strategy,
---
I didnt know they changed the ranked colors
---
When I get ops with new guns, I always flash &amp; vert. If I feel that it needs a smaller diamond I put a comp on it, if I don't then I usually switch over to a muzzle. Angled is rarely worth it IMO, but I tend to be an aggressive Mozzie and neither of those guns even seem to need attachments, never mind a vert grip.

I don‚Äôt know about PS4 but siege on PC is pretty fun, no hitreg and server issues besides ddossers. Also Monty and clash are kinda bull so watch out for that

I have it... On my old, rarely played XBox account. Pff.

They see me rolling.....they hate it.

For a second I thought this was r/dota2

But a lot of people‚Äôs first season were rough, so I don‚Äôt know. If the kd reset every season my opinion would be similar to yours

OR, so you can get carried ;)

And how's my English?

I've read several Tom Clancy's. Rainbow Six is actually my favorite
---
End game spoilers : Defenders plan backfires and kills all of them
---
Siege way more fun on pc. I had great aim before my break but it could be better. Siege is going to be the first game i get on pc
---
Yh but if you‚Äôre a diamond for example you‚Äôve played a lot and I mean a lot of ranked which makes that first season where you likely barely played irrelevant
---
Skins are a valid reason to use otherwise bad weapons. After all I use the 417 on twitch occasionally because I have a dope skin for it.
---
I have to be a Doc main now because I got a black ice for him....for the P90
---
I‚Äôd honestly be interested in a map or an event that takes place in the White House where instead of the default hostage it‚Äôs the president secretary of defense or something.
---
They said they have temporal fix for it, and I haven't noticed any glitch yet
---
Blackbeard can make sense for certain objectives the whole plan hinges on holding a specific angle, but lion is just about useless after the nerf
---
I've read that book but mine had a different picture on it

Yeah it‚Äôs about 900 pages and the font is smallish

No they don't lol. You can only get those skins by random chance since they're alphapack only. The point of them making a list is what? So you can be less suprised to actually get a cool skin?
---
Alright, thanks! :)
---
You might want to report their toxic behavior so they can get punishment. I don't think they will have immediate punishment if it's only once per game, even when RFF still isn't a thing, you need two or more TK to get punished (matchmaking cooldown)

Fuze would be a very logical choice on secure area

You scared the shht out of Doc man

I hear that a lot but I'm not sure I believe it, I queued with a friend that accidentally put us in EU instead of NA (I don't remember exact server) and it felt like the enemy was missing everything, I guess they could've just been bad but I really felt like it was an advantage

Where you at?

You would have to never play any fps game prior to legitimately be in copper 4.

Kinda wish you could trade in 3 or so items for 1 item of higher quality or perhaps a free choice of an item from the same pool of items of rarity

Lmao these people. Did you kill him? No. Then it is not a kill.
---
Terror and Confusion started as the enemy ash attempted to peek the opposing jager, The non clan member ran in front of them, killing the Montagne in one shot, the clan members grew confused and shot each other, the party leader left leaving the one non clan member to complete the rest of the game..

deplorable.....

Better, you could have a casual mode, ranked mode, newcomer mode and a mode where we get to play old maps like the old kafe and Hereford base etc
