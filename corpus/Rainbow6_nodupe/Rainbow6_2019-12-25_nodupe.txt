How?

---
---
Or Ying if you stun people a lot
---
Marry her
---
I saw this posted a few weeks ago, so it's not new, but it's still sleek AF
---
She’s frustrating but I think to solve this is to change her a bit, they don’t have to do that much
---
Yeah. I’ll admit my team does ban him often, but only on maps we really want to roam on (we have one anchor in our five stack, that’s it...) but at least we recognize he’s not bad on every map. 
---

---
And we certainly aren’t brain dead enough to ban him if we attack first
---
my friend got this around a week ago
---
You’re gay
---
But that does require stopping and droning people out so you don't waste stuns
---
Mozzie. He’s so much fun and useful
---
I really don't care what skin I get such as long as it looks nice and it's for a gun I use. So...
---
It’s a joke they made on account of wamais magnets
---
Europe
---
Also don't shoot out cams, if the enemy knows one is out then you have given away that you are coming. Don't sprint, you can be heard doing that.
---
Even as someone who is capable of getting aces with alot of headshots, I have moments like this too
---
Use her like a defender: roam around
---
I think it was 16
---
Oh! Sorry, I didn’t notice your tag in the picture before. Won’t happen again.
---
no im bi but 50% right is about the most a bandit main has ever got correct
---
yeah I got that too but I dont even use the 552 commando
---
The forbidden skin
---
Lesion. Easy to use, just make sure to anchor with him. Maestro is godly but takes a lot of knowledge to use, and sense you don’t have all ops I’m guessing your new and don’t have a ton of game sense.
---
Still gay
---
Unacoged shots fired.
---
get a ring. right. now.
---
The shotgun is fine but even with the deagle it’s a freakin joke, she needs better secondary
---
3000iq play
---
Well yes but actually... yes?
---
Yes
---
Caviera has a soulmate
---
He has 3 stims, and 5 people on a team
---
I ain’t a math major, but I don’t think that’ll work
---
A lot but I would switch up the build because that is a crazy bottleneck, spend more on the GPU less on the cpu and more in the ram, but you could still get decent frames.
---
So did I!!!
---
Yup should at least know how to play every op on base level but hey, it’s all about having fun
---
When you run out of breach charges
---
I remember the Hereford base rework everyone hated it and you would get it once out of 3 games
---
I sometimes play warden and let me tell you how many times I have been sworn at because it looks like I hack when looking through smoke.
---
BB is one of the better ops in the game so that's a pretty good pull.
---
Except he's the Germans and they're the Jewish
---
Your aim is so shit. Turn down your sensitivity. That video hurt my head.
---
He's Stalin and they're the common people.

Wonder what would happen if i blowtorch it?
---
Christ what have done
---
I think it was for the 2nd reason. People are impatient
---
Like you drive the drone to a certain place press a button and then it acts like a claymore
---
Can you give tips/strats/mindset for shogun play on console? I'm plat and trying to climb, but have less hours to play nowadays
---
r/angryupvote
---
You already got a free operator
---
Yall got ops i got a full fucking monty outfit where we lookin like a retarded elf. Fml
---
Aren’t you supposed to have high sensitivity your an ash main
---
Jägers ads
---
Fr? Lol big rip
---
That’s why I said it wasn’t a real idea I’m not that greedy
---
His gadget is was to niche to justify picking him over other selfish ops like say cav or vigil.
---
Personally I like being zoomed in so I like the acog that’s why I mean doc on defense
---
Oh thank god! I hated all of them
---
You are one of us now
---
I also got the angry malteser/whopper (depending on where you live)
---
It's just my opinion
---
and a knife
---
Thanks for the advice on what map he’s best on . I can honestly see why he would be good on Border .
---
The claymore part only deploys when the drone is standing still
---
Also,if you wanted to check for yourself,here is the order of all Elites since the "feature" got added. All Elites in order.
---
-Glaz(Release of Wind Bastion)
---
-Blitz(End of Wind Bastion)
---
-Hibana(Release of Burnt Horizon)
---
-Bandit(End of Burnt Horizon)
---
-Lesion(Phantom Sight release)
---
-Smoke(End of Phantom Sight)
---
-Mira(Ember Rise release)
---
-Capitao(Shifting Tides release)
---
-Ela(first few weeks of Shifting Tides)
---
-Caveira(Coming end of Shifting Tides or beginning of Y5S1)
---
Any other Elite before Glaz's has not have had that change. sadly
---
That's not thicc :l
---
More like dying. He's fine. Told him he sounded like a dolphin though
---
People tend to easily forget her gadget. That's normal
---
Rook was clearly on team GIGN
---
Wish I played oblivious opponents. 4 years and I've never aced a round because the last op always goes Eye of the Tiger and dunks on me.
---
Have you seen the Pro Team sets. They look amazing. The Pro Leauge weapon skins are well made. The black and red skin that come for all the guns new operators have looks fantastic and the seasonals have a nice design element. 
---
Siege already has 100+ weapons. Most of them require licensing fees from the production company. The only difference in new guns is a different model, the same damage and recoil and ROF still apply. 
---
Three speeds aren't being added because they don't need to be. There is nothing wrong with 2-2 or 3-1. Wanting more three speeds means your operators would have weaker gadgets. Ubisoft is tryinto bring the META back to OBJ style play rather than playing just for kills like it's COD.
---
If Bank has no bathroom, what are you meant to do if you need to make a deposit?
---
Coastline. Rent it out as a vacation and party spot.
---
His really good but he needs to take control of g2 and make the team good again
---
That's strange. Proper skill and utility is what I use to stop Echo and Jackal. We didn't have pick and ban when these ops came out, and I don't recall ever having a issue with these ops. Different strokes though I guess. Though it is sad that multiple generations of siegers won't get to figure out how to counter these ops easily for themselfs. Stop for half a second you will see the drone. Think for half a second and you'll know Jackal has to be where you were. These ops where never an issue before pick and ban.
---
It’s more like “an adequately sized hole, coming right up
---
Ah yes many ppl tried pacifist route and "accidentally" finished genocide route.
---
Everyone complains about siege tho it’s not just him .
---
Oh yes absolutely agree. Keeps saying how the game is shit and so bad, but is still playing...
---
is this a black joke
---
The bushes on the balcony are your friends in that situation

Uh...r/lostredditors ?

---

---
Im not saying its better you asked me a question AMD i answerd
---
A sniper rifle? Wow! That concept was stolen from Halo?
---
I said im my opinion i like elas weapon more
---
I remeber I read a post earlier in somewhere else, Ela got hurt, shoot feel bullet in front of Rook and ask for heal, of cause the Rook can do nothing, and that Ela TK the Rook for not healing.
---
I said ela is worse and you said nah bro
---
Yeah if teamates don't add anything to your gameplay, mute them. Chances are they will never help you. 
---
Also, solo queuing is the worst way to play. Go online and find squads of others like you on reddit, moot, etc.
---
Nice bro with all the action taking place no one knew where it was placed
---
I said they were even they are just used differently
---
I am happy that I did get something, I just wish it actually benefited people.
---
I had all the ops so I got Santa's little helper suit for monty which I LOVE and it goes so well with my p9 toy gun and my red SPQR shield skin
---
When you’re naked in the bathroom and you have a creepy neighbour.
---
Dude don’t worry the new invitational skins will be out soon so hopefully you could get one of those for Jäger
---
This is secure not bomb though so people will push from there. Also there's nowhere else to use all your reinforces lmao
---
Piper perri anyone
---
I enjoy ranked because it’s less toxic than casual but I play casual for clips 😂
---
Actual siege advice. Never play casual. Ranked sucks sometimes but people generally play to actually play the game. Plenty of toxicity still but at least with the squad reverse friendly fire and no voting to kick they can only stop you playing for one round at most.
---
This happens on PC too bud..
---
Same. But they changed it to "better reflect the multiplayer experience" i think.
---
Bot is credit to team
---
I got messages in ranked from doing this
---
 Asking why are you shooting random walls. I was not by obj I just do at random no reason behind it.
---
When you feel like you're on a losing streak, quit. Sometimes my reaction time and my instincts just shut off at night and I need to sleep before I can start again the next afternoon or evening.
---
Console 100
---
I like how this is upvoted only bcs ur a girl
---
Newest is Ela.
---
*ahem* Mumbo Fuze.
---
Merry Christmas bud, you found a keeper.
---
ok iselldrugsyo
---
Yea I’m not gonna lie I have absolutely no idea what’s going on and am very confused but I’m learning a little bit lol
---
I like that the usernames are somewhat related
---
I diagnose you with Juice Wrld
---
Go to the main part of the subreddit and it should be in the top right, there's a bunch to pick from
---
Holy shit how am i seeing fuze now???
---
I givth to thee, the suicide
---
On opposite day you play as a cluster charge and you place down fuzes on the wall, those fuzes fall down like this image and if it hits a hostage you win the round.  
---
also your pistol has an acog, vertical grip, and compensator.
---
Youza fishin' for some compliments, not critiques. Get outta here with that nonsense. Boo hiss.
---
You could delete some of it and put different flairs.
---
I got it from the holiday alpha pack, you might have to have all ops though because my friend got clash from it but I'm not sure
---
Point?
---
You should check out Get_Flanked on YouTube, he has a ton of videos that can help you learn the basics, as well as a bunch of more advanced stuff as you improve :)
---
dang. i already got kaid from mine
---
Laying a few welcome mats down now
---
Oh damn, y'all actually think that's intentional?
---
Its definetly worth buying both, they've both really good ops, however they play completely different roles in a team
---
I actually think it's useful... But on the other hand I am too poor for Spotify so I have to use YouTube to listen to music... and to keep it fresh I let YouTube decide what I should listen to.. and honestly, Its recommendations aren't too shabby
---
Toxins set
---
No need to extract the hostage if **there is no hostage**
---
First 450 to 520 is considered fast as you can pull the trigger minimum requirement in game hence why Maestro and Alibis shotguns were set back to 300.
---
Second I'm not feeling some sort of sight change on Iron sights my dude cause when the season first dropped I was still using it with iron sights vertical grip and comp cause I found it helped me best per season start and now I'm using holo comp and angled cause a ela main friend told me she got it buffed so I when I tried it I said holy hell and almost instantly swapped to the angled grip with holo 2 things I never thought I'd use on the gun cause I cant use ether with high recoil. So ether the sight deal youre talking about changed her SMG or she got shadow buffed cause theres no way my ass who cant hit the side of a barn should be able to control it
---
Why do u hate battlepasses? It's free stuff if u dont buy the "premium"
---
When you sneak a peek at the presents as Nokk or Vigil
---
I have this all the time. It’s not even EU I don’t think as it’s mostly Chinese or Japanese that the players are speaking
---
I play as fuse not to kill the hostage but to kill my teammates not with his ability but just his pistol
---
I wouldn’t say choice rather than suggestion. But I play pretty much everyone
---
God forbid someone try to get better
---
yeah   o
---
Find an operator that suits you, don’t just pick one because you like how they look or how they talk, try all of them or research them at least
---
Never aced in four years?
---
I don't want clash as my Xmas gift goddamit and I cant even play with her
---
Yeah as crazy as it sounds. I've gotten a few 4Ks but that is it.
---
Yes our lords savior
---
Calm down bro ur overreacting bro stop freaking vro
---
Lol
---
Would love to get a copy of siege.
---
Flair checks out
---
Compliments on what? It was pretty average gameplay, nothing special about it at all. Its not like he was out here 360 dropshotting everyone then going "AnY cRiTiCiSm gUiS?????".
---
Get outta here.
---
It is. Ubi released a video a while back detailing each operator, and they mentioned that for Fuze.
---
It’s Alibi, and she’s awesome. If you can learn to control the recoil on the Mx4 then you’ll be unstoppable
---
Our true lord and savior
---
Thanks I appreciate it !
---
Bruh dis some bullshit ubi should fix it so that only unranked can play against other unrankes
---
yesterday got tk'd because i accidentaly destroyed an ela and i said sorry and the guy just sprayed me 🙄
---
forgive me if i’m stupid but did u get 3 packs or how does that work?
---
The post isnt bullshit
---

Same boat here. Got her, tried her out; totally in love with it.
---
pmao
---
Dude, they're just trying to have fun on the same game as you with their free-time off, chances are most of the kids aren't dickheads and you only note the shitheads (because there's bound to be ones.)
---
wdym? Mx4 literally has 0 recoil
---
Why would it? Year 4 pass was released around this time last year
---
i've played 7 ranked games... all 7 i've been paired with 10-12 year olds with their mic at max volume... and where ranging levels from 45, 50, and even the guy with like 140 was playing dumb af
---
At least his camera works, unlike mine.
---
Make it an airsoft and I’m in
---
Idk. I don't remember or keep track of stuff like this.

No Far Cry 5? I am disappointed.

What platform are u on? Maybe we could play sometime, I can get on and help you out a bit if u think that would help you

Ughhh no. Kicked 2 times in a row. Almost every single game people team killing and kicking for no reason. (Most kids are 'dickheads' on online games). If you think otherwise, you're pretty damn ignorant.

Fortunately I lost the same amount I won in my placements, but there were some 9 year olds complaining that I was banning Mira and not Cav on Oregon. I think I'm done with ranked until I can get at least a 3 stack

If he’s going positive you can’t really say it’s boosting

Damnit, I'm on PC, but regardless, u can send me a PM on here if u need help with something

Sometimes the hardest part isn’t being skilled enough to win 5 gunfights, it’s more being able to kill 5 people before the rest of the team gets 1

---
I think they're pretty good choices for solo.
---
I normally duo que, but I think zofia could be quite good. Nice gun, useful utility. And can get up by herself.
---
I like mira, but if you don't wanna talk I'm not 100% sure on recommending her. 
---
She's really powerful but has a couple weaknesses. 
---
If someone puts a wall defence on the wrong side, it can mess up your strategies. Also careful about hibana or twitch.
---
Kaid or Vigil both sound pretty cool
---
I suppose, I AM going off of memory and can't be taken as fact.
---
Was just going to ask lol
---
Nahhhhhh P90 Gang
---
Zofia bea 10000%
---
Nozzle supports both an aggressive and cautious play style. And he has (IMO) the 2nd best weapon on defense (commando). It’s super easy to control and very powerful. Only downside is it’s lack of ammunition so you have to be conservative. He’s picked a lot though so you may not get to use him very often unless you’re quick enough
---
Kaid however is a great op to counter hard beaching. And if you use him and bandit together, you will be able to lock down a room if bandit places his batteries on barbed wire and two walls, while you can electrify four walls. He also has two great guns on defense however they are a little harder to get used to. 
---
Overall mozzie is the best way to go unless you want to main somebody, then go kaid
---
Been on both sides of that.
---
Sometimes it just ain't my day and my friend carries.
---
Other times I'm 1v5'ing with valk and good call outs.
---
Ironically Glaz counters him more than warden counters Glaz.
---
haha if that's what you want to believe then fair enough. Not sure why you're so mad at people trying hard to win though? I'm not sure what the point of a competitive shooter is other than to win? Maybe I'm missing something though
---
Zofia is the best attacker by far (other than jackal but have fun with that)
---
She's so fat
---
I got kaid. He's ight.
---
Peripheral vision: Side vision. The ability to see objects and movement outside of the direct line of vision.
---
Be advised, enemy RC-XD spotted
---
Solo queueing with mira sucks. I would do Zofia, she is an operator I come back to and frag with a lot. She also brings a lot to the team. Especially if you learn small tricks like countering bandit tricking and small stuff like that. Not to mention vertical play.
---
At least a lot
---
Looks great
---
A lot. You can buy the year 1 and year 2 ops in a bundle but the rest you have to buy separately. You can get all the year 4 ops if you buy the season pass but at this point in the year it’s not worth it since the next season pass is about to come out soon.
---
Stupid title

Ok thanks

Your right in that

Good eye to spot that

I got Mozzie.

---
this year is bullshit don't buy it. Save your money until y5s1 or y5s2
---
But most importantly, he Blocc
---
If you’re playing on PC uplay and get steam u should still have the ops. I have both steam and uplay and launching R6 launches through both anyways. 
---
I thought u were talking about console to PC my bad
---
The only advice I’d give is professional wording
---
Alright mate calm down
---
460 radeon
---
i5
---
8gigs ram
---
I don’t think it’s any of those because I used to be able to run the game perfectly fine
---
Competitive games bring toxic players, like overwatch
---
It's not even just competitive even in casual I tend to get messages from angry players if I do something they dont like
---
I'd say Siege is as toxic as any typical shooter community, but this game provides toxic players with more tools to be toxic than your average game
---
Stop flexing
---
*i stand wildly corrected*
---
I bet he was vote kicked to death lol
---
Then it might be a little too op for the game.
---
No, but there *were* a lot of "Thanks, Wamai"'s
---
Didn’t know that was a thing.
---
Question how can you tell? Just based on how fast their aim is?
---
I'm not going to leave the match after getting TKed. They would think people are afraid of them because they're in a stack and would do the same thing again. It's casual so it's just a loss but if you let them have their way they will do it again.
---
People buy adapters to do it.
---
Flick speed and 8 way movement
---
It takes a random lucky spin to get an alpha pack
---
Ok
---
I understand perfectly well how it works
---

I'm gonna go back to England at the 3rd of January will this still be available?
---
and hipleaning
---
They will do it again not matter if you TK them or not. You never get the last laugh against people like that.
---
Where did you lock fps?
---
Tbh if that was the UK. That would be.. 30-300 copies I think
---
Ubi needs to step up their game with M&amp;K detection on console. 80+% of my games somebody is using M&amp;K
---
Projectiles
---
Merry Christmas comrade.
---
if you play anything other than quick match, 90% of the time, he'll get ban
---
At least I'm not a punk that let them do it. I never get why they act like they own the room when they're with their friends. I'm usually very chill in casual if my team is bad I just leave and find other room but these dudes just had to do it.
---
This is old as the game itself, I played way too much t hunt, I remember I would play for a whole month, 4 to 5 hours a day, just this. And what did it cost? I cant touch the game anymore, I just want The OG days back.
---
I got him to. Wasn’t expecting an operator I was thinking about getting and well I got him. Merry Xmas to.
---
Wheres chanka
---
Are you on xbox? And whats your gamertag?
---
Why is this not a skin yet?
---
Yo wish i meet him i dont have the game but i realy like it i played it on free weekend events and thats it.
---
Those operators had a family
---
Cool shirt, might propose a choking hazard tho
---
But seriously nice ace!
---
How do you guys put your mains near your name
---
Fortress and Hereford were taken out of the ranked playlist actually, that’s why I’ve been so concerned as to where they’ve gone
---
They've implemented a map rotation now for most game modes. I believe the time frame is looking to be about twice a season for the regular Quickplay mode whereas Ranked and Unranked will change once per season. So if at any point you feel you haven't seen a map in a while, this will likely be why.

Hmm ok that makes sense, I keep doing people if they’ve been in those maps and they all say the same thing, and even if they weren’t good maps it’d still be upsetting for them to just go like that

Lies. Lies I tell you, lies!

SMG-11 is my favorite gun, but the P226 is an underrated hand cannon! It has good capacity and has 50 base damage with little recoil. It's a great pistol, and I wish more people would try it out

That’s racist

That’s the joke

You have until january 5th I believe to claim it. If you dont log in before that I think you're out of luck

I got clash and I cant even use her :/

I overread that then, my bad

We have never played unranked

200 hours isnt much just keep playing.

How many hours a day do you play and how old are you?
---
r/lostredditors mods defuze this dumb meta post
---
Its normal, they changed all the files about 5-6 months ago. Honestly, just let steam redownload everything.
---
What triggers me is the white theme thingy
---
Ubi gives it to you if you have all the operators
---
Ok boomer. Hail russia
---
I got Finka and honesty she’s not as bad as I thought
---
Nook, cavieara
---
Its because casual has a mmr system aswell

And since most high ranks dont play a lot of casual they get put in the standard mmr range

Moustache man and JESUS FUCKING CHRIST MY EYES.

We have to claim the pack before Jan 5th but can open it whenever? I'm trying to unlock all of the Y1 operators before opening it. I don't think I can collect enough renown if I have to open it so soon.
---
Warden and ying?
---
Yups.

After countless vote kicks due to toxicity like this, I think the feature should be removed completely, as in my experience, it has been used more for toxicity than its actual purpose. I have only seen it be used a few times for its intended reasons, unlike shit like this.

You have a pc but can’t afford R6?

Hopefully you can get to silver ;)

Everything is good if you use it good :)

I have never seen 4 randoms following each other like that, coming from the center of the building to the side, nomad clearly seeing you then checking the ceiling, playing without sound (for some reason common af on console). Highly suspicious of being some badly scripted shit right here.

So cute 💖

Who's the one talking to Blackbeard?

Where is recruit tho :(

Oh man i always loved pics like these, it feels so cozy and warm when everyone is together having fun and you can see cute little stories with every operator, such a nicely done, cute pic, great job

Of course gridlock is on the turkey

That’s why I just play ranked as my causal cause casual has ever worse try hard imo

No, everyone gets one for Christmas.

Use yours.

Oh my god... I love the caveira and nøkk underneath the table
---
Sledge is still coming for your ass
---
Where is finka tho?
---
Out of literally 40+ operators, I am a recent player and I got like 8 ops because I bought the starter edition, and what do I get, I get fucking clash
---
Did I tell you that one about the pope and his  donkey?
---
 Got it too on my second account lmao
---
Yeah g2 haven’t been the best recently like choking a 3-0 lead
---
Play her a bit like ash but slower. She's still primarily  an entry fragger due to her good gun and non-essential gadget, but your job is both soft destruction with breaches and removing gadgets like shields and maestro cams with her grenade launcher. She can also assist pushes with her disorientation grenades.
---
Probably a custom game with friends and lined up shots for YouTube fame.
---
Smurfing is a concept we gamers call a "dickhead move" its the concept of which a very high level and skilled player logs on to a different account that is newer so that they can ruin other peoples days for fun. ( p.s i hate smurfing with a passion ).
---
This ela is too beautiful!
---
When you've got them Ops, they give you a skin 😞 Wish they'd have just given us renowned instead
---
Can you make a background version
---
Chalet, dogshit
---
I got valk
---
Who’s between Kaid and Finka on the top left?
---
Santa on the left most?
---
Girl holding the claymore close to the screen on the right?
---
Where’s Hibana?
---
I’m loving this artwork btw, trying to find and recognise each operator was like a game of Where’s Wally
---
Wardens a bit site specific but not bad at all.
---
Hope you have friends lol, clash is great to annoy people if you have a friend
---
When you where over her head your gun wasn't shooting, duh
---
Cranky cus you got warden?
---
thank you i will try everything you said
---
You are right. That's what made me post it here, artist posted it on Twitter the 10th tho or somewhere around that
---
Its bad,VERY bad.Only good in rare situations.
---
I’m not counting the shells not intended to kill someone
---
It should exost an class above legendary for this skin
---
you are right, but Thatcher is on the right and goyo is on the left
---
He drew everyone with an elite skin in their elite skin... Except for Slesge ;_;
---
What’d you expect then?
---
Kinda surprised Finka isn’t spending some alone time with Tachanka or that Lion isn’t the one “helping out” a “jolly” Iq. 👀
---
The mpx has pretty much no recoil, you can prefire head height and delete people. It also has a decent mag to fire rate ratio, so you can prefire for a long time. That's why people call it a headshot machine.
---
I got wamai on Xbox and nomad on ps4 I ain’t complaining
---
Quick matches will probably provide a much better experience, regarding tram killing and other toxic things people do. Don't get demotivated to play the game tho. This game is a beauty besides all the toxicity and bugs.
---
If that doesn't work then ask r/pcmasterrace
---
They will probably give you crap for having a laptop so just ignore that. But they will probably give you more options to fix your problem. I am a fairly new masterrace person so I don't know everything.
---
no, i’m a good roamer (at least i think) andy teammates tell me where certain enemies push from, and i flank them. it’s just once in a while the attackers get to obj and defuse
---
Forget baby yoda. Baby Mozzie is the real deal.
---
Could be worse, coulda gotten Goyo
---
It’s probably a feeling of inclusion and allows you to feel like you’re part of something, it’s not really doing any harm so there’s no real need to worry it helps them and that’s ok
---
And yet you don’t provide any credits toward them or even a source..
---
Main'd Cav for awhile. Maybe like 1, might have just been a 4k. Getting all 5 in a round requires you the bomb to have been planted or playing secure area so it's a lil tough.
---
Honestly, far more fun to tbag and throw an impact on people you down.
---
Same
---
I want that to be an actual event of the game, where you can do a christmas festival with all operators in one room and interactive stuff. Just some peaceful wholesome festival without shooting each other for one day.
---
Visible confusii
---
Just. Crop. It.
---
I like how mozzi is the size of twitch's drone
---
Use the pound symbol then type in all capitals
---
That's literally Moroccan Santa and he's really good for making people not hate you
---
No, wtf. Chalet is one of the best maps
---
Hiding inside the tree with Cav
---
*best
---
It's a 7 USD operator. You got him for free, why are you complaining?
---
Fyi, because you are bad doesnt make a map bad
---
Actually it seems like they chose skins based on preference. Fore example frost and hibana aren't in their elites, neither is ash, and Ela is in her pro league skin, but not her elite.
---
Clash and Amaru: exist
---
Idk ubi just probably wanted to spice things up
---
You are obtuse
---
Wait, Isn't it monty who's with ehco and rook with kapkan?
---
Should've had capitao lighting the fireplace, with goyo and thermite being shoved aside for there more "volitile" ideas of how to do it
---
I got Amaru.  *heavy prolonged sigh*
---
I always confuse the breach mode with concussion mode on her weapon. Any tips
---
where are twitch and smoke?
---
If you want to see him miss his shots look at the post on my acc
---
Glad to see Blackbeard dressed up as Santa for everyone
---
You can look at the bottom of the screen, your toolbar will tell you what mode you're currently in.
---
Except Hereford isn't in Ranked either...
---
Where is recruit? :(
---
Also the crosshair changes between modes
---
Yeah your absolutely screwed
---
She's got a cold
---
Clash from the island of misfit toys
---
His weapons are below average at best and his gadget is one of the bottom five in the game. There is no reason for warden besides memes
---
I got loaded into a ranked with only myself and no teammates earlier this week. I aced an attack round, but I stood no chance against five people who were also above my rank. Stuck around for the renown, much to their annoyance, still managed to get like 2k points haha, horrible experience tho. Wish they'd fix this.
---
Epi pls
---
Hibana. She’s banned way less than Echo and she’s a great op overall, also a beast for solo queue if that matters to you.
---
Thatcher Elite
---
Santa-Chank
---
FYI, that has no relevance to this discussion.
---
So, since I already h as d all of the operators it said to was going to give me a full monty elf set, why!?
---
All I Want for Xmas is Chalet back tbh.
---
Yeah, but few months in advance and 1 day in advance makes no difference. You still get everything.
---
I think that's monty, because the plates on his helmet
---
Regular IQ is so cute
---
you are did it
---
*laughs in Mozzie*

Try to take the defuser as often as you can. You have the best kit for planting the defuser so be sure to hog it from the Ash mains. Try to keep at least one of your trax dispenser for the defuser, so treat the first 75% of the match as you only having 2 dispensers. Use the trax on annoying flanks, like Nomad, or to cover stairs, the most notable example being Red Stairs on Kafe from the roof hatch. 
---
For her loadout, use the AR and Shotgun with smokes. You don’t need breaching charges because you have the shotgun, the pistol is inferior to the shotgun, and the LMG is fine but the AR is better.
---
what?
---
Why are you reposting this?
---
F
---
There’s a point where increasing the level cap is just silly. 100 levels worth of casual/terrorist hunt sounds awfully painful that it would deter a lot of players from playing ranked anyway.  
---
Also “bots” get placed where they belong at some point. Don’t want bots at all? Play with a goddamn team.
---
I love how nomad is wine drunk in the corner
---
Clash is banned again
---
Be grateful. It's a life long lesson in how to manage expectations. lol.
---
Im am asking for a squad, but noone want to play with me, so im forced to play solo q. Maybe a solo q only playlist would be fine too
---
&gt; finally come up with
---
I don’t know what else that could have meant, man.
---
love how this reddit thread houses the most retarded players ive ever seen
---
Are you crazy!?!? I like playing siege, but grinding to level 100 just to play ranked, hell no. That would ruin any joy I get from siege and would make me uninstall it. 
---
but here is a much simpler solution: find a group of people to play with and stop solo queuing.
---
Those grenades... oof
---
its 100% preference.
---
Do you still get a pack with a skin or something if you have all the operators? I used to play on pc and play on Xbox now and I have all the operators on PC but if I can get a skin or something I'll log on real quick
---
He is the one taking to santa
---
I follow the "I expect nothing and I'm still let down" philosophy
---
People gotta humble themself
---
You're just setting him on the path to understanding why he never gets a black ice
---
Elite?
---
The lord in the back though
---
Tbh honest he’s one of the ops who very few can use to his full potential but when he’s used by a good glaz player he’s pretty dangerous
---
Must be why you're here
---
well shit
---
Thanks
---
Those look really bloody nice! What're they made out of?

Dont we all?

After playing default settings for a while, I just started using a stretched resolution (4:3 aspect ratio with 80 FOV) and I really like it. It took a couple games to get used to the look but I’ve noticed a huge difference in gameplay personally.
---
Ubisoft would never do that that’s nearly 400 hours  of gameplay just for a game mode ,and ranked is more skill based so it’s pretty rare for you to run into someone a lot worse than you
---
What you should’ve done was Alibai talking to her three prismas or something like that
---
If no one wants to play with you.. there’s something wrong with you.  
---
I’m not even close to a good player, yet I was easily able to piece together a group of friends that I can consistently play with, on both PC and XB1. Either you’re not trying hard enough, you’re really picky, or there’s something about you that people don’t like to play with.  
---
Also a solo-queue playlist would be nice, but the issue is that the problem in the OP still exists within it.

And who is the bearded man next to capitao

Thank you and merry Xmas 😁

Merry Xmas
---
Not much of an event really
---
same
---
I mean people in Diamond and Plat say it is bad but okay. Also after playing the game for a good amount most guns won’t really have much recoil. Also prefixing head height you can do with any gun and most guns having a 30 bullet magazine size means you always have enough bullets for preferring, but hey I can’t argue with people who haven’t played the game long enough, to actually even understand the points I’m making.
---
I know beard has the one you can buy just didn’t know if other ops had any
---
My friend got Clash as well. I’m just like, of course. They could have disabled getting her because it’s not like anyone can play her right now.
---
bruh
---
Yup
---
No Vigil is just L O N G
---
Glaz used to be so overpowered.
---
I just researched and yes all you get is that skin there are no others
---
Pick up sledge for attack, most balanced and easy to controll weapon with a good kit. For defences pick up either mute or rook. Rook has an acog. But hes a three speed. Mute has a great gadget and pretty solid kit with the SMG 11 sidearm. But that's just personal preference.
---
I spent too much time trying to find wamai and kali and they’re on the tv
---
Kinda disappointed that Vigil isn't silently hiding in some corner or something. Seems even he can be chipper at Christmas :D
---
Ela shotty is not top meta. Why do people still think that? It never was either. Maybe against players that cant hit their shots. So in low elo
---
I got Mira and hoped for an attacker
---
Just watch russian badger. I learned how to play from him
---
That’s true
---
How are you level 300 and in the same mmr as these "bots" would be my question
---
Just play it slow, drone in first dont just rush in. Play the operators that are useful to the team.
---
Exactly. I watched the US nationals and when they needed area denial or nitro cells they went Warden.
---
I love this... so much
---
That’s been happening quite a bit lately.
---
What rank is this?
---
Tachanka btw
---
Nice hacks lol
---
That's badass!
---
Cool
---
Gold 2, the dudes on the other team didn’t even reinforce
---
Honestly just buy a random one if you plan on sticking with the game for a while you’ll have them all
---
Zofia 100 percent, one of the best operators in the game
---
It is that or he has no friends because he can’t hold his anger back from his bad decisions and blame them.
---
How many c’s are in that thick?
---
I got Kaid
---
That’s fucked lol
---
You're dead wrong
---
Good god it's beautiful
---
Apparently I'm dumb and never posted [source](https://twitter.com/soritat07)
---
Did they u keep the receipt
---
I don't know what dude is talking about. Still seems as uncontrollable as it always has, the horizontal recoil is still there so don't get your hopes up.
---
He’s just fake
---
I got clash
---
I red this with... that voice... lol
---
With his most recent buffs, he’s pretty much a must-have operator and my defensive main for all of Year 4. 
---
A merry Christmas indeed!
---
I always do, it pains me
---
And his AUG absolutely slaps as well
---
Santa tachanka is the best thing ive ever seen

Best operator in game

---
Missing the flare

Seeing Clash happy is a strange sight to say the least...

More on uncredited which annoys me, I tend to look for the sauce on posts like these bc the creators work hard on em

Well hello Cyril.

Get echo covered in yokai drones

Where's ela
---
echo trying to hide from dokk is the best thing here
---
Whenever is Clash ban lifted?
---
That'd be... amazing...
---
Nope maestro is in the back corner 1st floor
---
This is just something ubi said they wanted to originally do and I’m not even totally sure they revealed what each CTU was going to have as their perk. Though I doubt the spectnaz would have those scopes since that was added to the game a bit later
---
*3 seconds after her mouth moves* CLAPPED

Kinda looks like if R6 was a hockey team. That’s dope

MOZZIE &amp; TWITCH ❤️❤️❤️

Haha I thought that was a floppy dog until I realized it’s Nokk 
---
Are you the artist? If so, this looks adorable, hope to see more
---
Well its ubi what did you expect. They suck at fixing shit and half the time i wanna just cuss out their community ppl on their official forums because they are literally no help and fillers to make us think theyll listen.
---
I did and it's downloading 100 game files ;(
---
Well you obviously don’t know me because I’m Fabian
---
This is awesome.
---
Man man man, potato recording bedoel je
---
I don't see anything in the box
---
How ? Very game file u mean ? Then it's telling to download 100 game files which are 70gb
---
Be careful of running and wear a good headset sound is key in this game I would suggest playing either Thatcher or thermite on attack Thatcher is the most useful operator in the game arguably try to throw your emps on reinforced walls that are electrified so your thermite can blow out the wall and then get the other 2 grenades into the bomb room to take out other electronics. Try rook on defense his name is rook but he's also one of the strongest operators in the game due to his Acog sight just drop his armor at the beginning of the round and boom you contributed to the team in a useful way. Find good angles were your not exposed alot and hold a tight angle angles are everything the 3 most important things to practice is tight angles listening for enemy noise and most importantly I can't over state this enough for new people on attack drone heavily don't waste your 1st drone if you already know we're the bomb is save your drone don't worry about finding out who the defensive ops are it doesn't matter as much as keeping your drone so that you have 2 after the prep phase. Good droning is the single most important and powerful gadget you have on attack so use it wisely
---
I got Echo, RIP
---
yup it's fucked, as long as you clicked "collect" before the challenge ended you're good
---
Gorgeous
---
He's next to Mira on the left, the one leaning on the wall
---
It might aswell be ranked
---
I wonder how did you main amaru in two season m8.
---
Oh that looked like Maestro.
---
It takes time to get used to things. I didn’t have a huge problem shifting because I was already used to computers (I use my side mouse buttons to lean) but I did change some things around. But what you’ll notice is that right now you can still play console siege. It was like that for me. 2-3 months down I was more comfortable on pc but could still kinda play on console. Now almost 2 years later I almost have a heart attack on thunt on console but pc is like second nature. Also taking online typing classes helped as well.
---
Zofia, the resident concerned sister.
---
Ok Boomer.
---
You told the original commenter to shut up...
---
On point 2 not really. With all the mnk getting a high rank on console is hard since you are at a huge disadvantage playing with a controller. If it was all fair then it’d be true. :P
---
did my placement games last few days and dokkaebi never got banned

Lmao u right

Me neither. I was super disgusted that he was running irons with a suppressor at first until he aimed down and shit
---
Mozzie is really good. He is picked a lot more in pro league now. He does dual role of drone denial and intel so its Mute and Valkyrie combined.

I don’t usually ever see her get banned even in unranked or up to my plat games

It’s beautiful

&gt; Also, is having more keys on the mouse considered cheating? Like macro? 
---
macros are not allowed

Kevin Smith?
---
Im not gonna argue with u but all im saying is that i play on both platforms and the two are not comparable
---
Ya I searched up mobile R6 and this was there and it’s not horrible
---
I post mine on YT and don’t even worry about being a non native speaker. I am a native speaker and I still don’t speak because I feel like it takes away from the clips

The MP5SD has the exact same damage and RoF as the FMG-9, but it has the advantage of being integrally suppressed without losing damage. Obviously you can't put any other barrel attachments on it, but it's already a fairly low-recoil gun.
---
Thank you
---
That's how siege works
---
That is awesome!! Ever since I started playing Siege, the Black Ice skin has always been desirable to me.
---
oh noo indeed ;o

I saw smoke and thought he was Hannibal lector

Never put a Kapkan trap on a castle! Ever! Everything except sledge that breaks the castle also breaks the trap!
---
Can't say I ever have either. Lucky I guess.
---
Frost not in hers.
---
whatchu talking ‘bout mate? warden is the BEST operator.
---
Lmao that’s a good meme
---
Good ol’ Kansas City shuffle works every time
---
It eventually can be, but fuck Tower.
---
It isn't second best. It is objectively better. Yeah the C7 has more accuracy but the AK is still pretty controllable.
---
Mozzie playing with twitch drone
---
A bloody Australian Christmas miracle!
---
That is the best shit ever
---
Mozzie is not
---
Wow i didn't know they could do that
---
Thanks btw.

Ahs: "The perfect ace doesn't exist"

Fuze: "Hold my medovukha"
---

I believe you refund the regular version of the game, but if you play more than a few hours you can't so I don't think you can
---
Poor jackal so sad
---
I wonder how long it took
---
There are to echos not smoke elite and other jackal is up hiden a bit
---
Fuck tower
---
I get 3v5 all the time most of the time enemy team gets super cocky and you can get a great kd boost but you’ll most likely end up losing
---
IQ can do the job quite well and has intel gathering for traps or if you need it. But Ash and Zofia are definitively better.
---
She's a keeper.
---
I hit two Hail Marys in that game mode. Threw a grenade from our spawn to the front door.
---
I don't have a gf. Can't relate.
---
I think autocorrect got your comment, i think u meant highest rank u've ever been.
---
On the spot
---
That’s awesome, I’m freakin jealous
---
It's not a fuze ace if your don't get all 11 kills
---
I plan on putting them on my wall above my monitors
---
Amaru hands down
---
*says, "I know you are but what am I" , dealing 43 damage and gaining 26
---
Nah I’m plat 2 rn
---
ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY. If you suspect someone is cheating using MnK, ask them to do a 720 degree turn. If they need to stop at 180 degrees, MnK and teamkill him. Using controllers you can spin indefinitely.
---
Where’s recruit
---
I'd trade my mk11, mp5k, and sausage black ice for bucks AR black ice
---
Good luck lol
