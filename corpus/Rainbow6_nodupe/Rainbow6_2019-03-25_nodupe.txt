I got that skin then opened a pack a day later and got it again that was the first legendary I got in 4 months

Why would you replace it on the soft wall why not the reinforced wall that ur peat just got destroyed

That poor Kapkan is just not having a good time

Thx I‚Äôll use the tip next time I‚Äôm in Skyscraper.

Well, didn‚Äôt your scope just block your view?

They don‚Äôt exist.

He's probably got some rock solid abs

My only black ice is on the sausage
---
That happen to me after I eliminated 4/5 in 25 sec of match time n is annoying.
---
Really though? The enemy team averaged more kills than his teammates.

---
Stop being a salty twat because you'll never reach similar numbers.
---
In my experience, no.

i like both pistols, but i one tap people with the PMM so often

Consoles have always been mini unique PCs in terms of parts but this gen they are pretty much PCs in terms of software if I remember right.
---
That combined with the big push for backward compatibly likely means the next gen consoles will be able to play everything from this gen right from the start either through hardware or software.
---
I love this game but the timing of looking away is what ruins the experience
---
Hibana and echos shot gun i believe
---
gridlock needs to lose a few hundred pounds
---
Gold 3/4
---
There.
---
shields.....
---
The fact that this happens so consistently to everybody is clear evidence that there is a higher power fucking with us.
---
Yes the supernova is hibana‚Äôs and echo‚Äôs shotgun 
---
Ubisoft has 14000 employees but they can't fix this.
---
Yes, it's a decent improvement if your PC can push the frames.
---
As it was already said it won't make it better at the game but it's a much better and smoother gaming experience.

So this is the 4th season I've done a road to plat, most recent being the [revolver](https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ar47x2/the_road_to_platinum_revolver_edition/). This time around using the SASG was definitely a challenge, I fluctuated constantly down from gold 1- gold 3 for like 25 games until I finally got to plat, which is why this video is so damn long compared to my other ones. It is probably the worst primary weapon in the game.
---
I had to trim out some clips and lower the quality to get it below 1000MB to upload to reddit due to the length, so if you want the improved version or have problems with v.reddit here's a [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZvqTDUf648) 
---
Why Jager and Bandit? And what would that ideally look like? Suppressors and flanks, or pincer movements with loud and heavy conflict. I would feel like if the silent route is the goal then a Caveira with an echo drone assisting, or really any camera operator would be more advantageous. 
---
If you got an Xbox I‚Äôd add you and I‚Äôd show you 
---
It ain't too bad, it is better than the AA12 legendary that looks literally like the default but green. I have it as well and, though not excited for it, it matches with a outfit i have set up for doc.

The laws of siege
---
This is actually awesome
---
nice to see you came back after 5 hours to **update**
---
If you can get a castle on top, and a bandit/kaid and a nite you will be able to hold that obj pretty well and no problem. Only pitfall is a maverick like me who will crawl into the wall and put a hole in it 
---
Well then youre fucked I guess. Dont know what to say lol. Play with friends that are gold so you can play in higher lobbies? 
---
The games not gonna be perfect for everyone, but its fun at higher levels.
---
Not Ubis fault, ppl will always be shits
---
Ping abuser
---
Looks kinda nice 
---
Yeah, i bet you feel dumb too 
---
Why castle? Mute wouldn't stop Ash, Sledge, Glaz, Grenades, Melee, or Maverick just off the top of my head, from getting through the underwhelming barricade.
---
Story of my fps career. It happens 10x more often in CS.
---
I mean check out the houndstooth skin for maverick it looks great 
---
These clips are sick
---
Of course. The first law of Siege: The amount of time you spend holding an angle is inversely proportional to how quickly you will get killed from that angle when you stop holding it. For example, if you hold the angle for 30 seconds, you will get killed in 1/30th of a second after you look away.
---
Finagle's Law: The Game.
---
(According to [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finagle%27s_law, "Anything that can go wrong, will‚Äîat the worst possible moment.")
---
Sorry I was wrong, god just hates you.
---
Well thanks for the insight, now I know what to watch out for!
---
+Respect
---
And now you murder as much of the team as you can.
---
See the thing is this would have been great 5 years ago but meme videos now are faster, more cut up, and way more ironic. It looks like your buddy tried emulating what was popular years ago instead of following ‚Äúcurrent meme culture‚Äù(I cant believe I just typed that)
---
I actually stopped playing siege since literalely every round I've always died like that. and even when Iv got 4 kills and im the last on my team I always stop for a second and then they appear. it's like they know. 
---
Yeah no problem and I meant mute btw not nite lol
---
Doc main
---
I'd say a 15 second round but 39 works nicely too.
---
They're like teammates, but somehow less helpful
---
Doc and Rook do sound like solid support role options. Valk and Cav also sound nasty and a little cheeky. Thermite and Thatcher sound a tad obsolete with a Maverick alternative. I'll be sure to take it all in consideration though! Thanks for the reply!
---
Hey mute! Oh wait, I forgot, ur mouth is....... jammed üòÇ
---
These are the heroes we need, but don‚Äôt deserve 
---
Even tho it never does anything...
---
When you go 9-4 and your teammates go an avg of 1-4
---
NGL, I jumped 
---
You‚Äôd think they would be more on top of this stuff though like, or turn off friendly fire in casual 
---
Cool story bro, let him have his moment. Not everyone can play as much as you. 
---
Unfortunately no xbox, sorry. But it's no sweat! I like finding my own way rather than just copy pasting a strat anyway! I'll be considering it in some planning phases for sure!
---
Probably not, but it's the future and it's a fictional game. There's also a lot crazier shit in siege, so I think you can suspend your disbelief on this.
---
What's mutes favorite sandwich. A peanut butter and...... jammed
---
Yeah it works good on other maps too even though your odds are lowered 
---
Siege should be 7th based it's 45m plus sales.
---
Literally just killed my friend in siege with a nitro cell but because he was killing noobs in newcomer. But I hate people that do it for fun
---
[removed]
---
ha ha video game woman fat xDddddd
---
The hell is wrong with you
---
Though there are tells to know it‚Äôs not real or if it is 
---
I‚Äôd say neither are important honestly. Obviously you don‚Äôt have to be good to be carried to plat, and you don‚Äôt necessarily have to be great to get a kill here or there and hide in the back of the map for the entire game to have a good kd. 
---
Me:*Holds angle for half of the round*
---
*Looks away for 1 second*
---
Enemy:*Hello there*
---
I know that supressors in video games are very unrealistic, slap one on this gun and it has the most satisfying sound in the game.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion here but I‚Äôll say it anyway - as cool as this might be.. and it is cool as fuck I sure hope there was some way to identify him as a cosplay...

Oh lawd she comin'

Playing Glaz on Clubhouse. Obj was bedroom. My team was assaulting the windows pretty hard. I decided to keep an eye on the servers window as it's a classic area for defenders to ambush from. I'm in a really good spot where my head is barely visible. 
---
I'm watching that damn window for 2 mins and nothing happens. I go to breach the window in the weight room and fucking Jager one taps me in the dome from that very fucking window. 
---
Love this game and hate it all at the same time. 
---
Lol! Siege

So glad when I saw the title and scrolled down it wasn't an Australian upside down joke..

Who thinks less than .001% of the population reflects what people do?
---
Lol people dont play siege quickly 
---
That‚Äôs the old Rainbow Six!
---
Wait was it a thing before and it got deleted or what
---
IIRC back in Quake 2 the killfeed or scoring system or whatever would use "frags" to denote kills. It might be even older but that's where I first learned it.
---
Some people in the siege community are just fucking stupid.
---
Not trying to be mean but you just potatoed.
---
Ranked is bad but now that I‚Äôm actually trying ranked I realize how much better it is than casual, just got kicked by 4 actual children playing the game shouting into their mics, it‚Äôs a goddamn nightmare, casual is a lawless wasteland and they can‚Äôt introduce reflecting damage soon enough.
---
ya its really good to have good community after having to feel getting toxic
---
yesterday i play with my friend at casual and the start of the round 2 guys kills me and my friend and they left with the 3rd guy too (dont know why, i recognize they just trolling because they just want to leave)
---
but after they left the players who replace them have a player name "whysotoxicmaboi" some kinda like that i forgot, and the good thing is this three guys make me win the game and make me feel better rather then having to play the entire match with that toxic player at the start
---
is now officially my phone wallpaper
---
TK if happen often, even if in different matches should be able to get someone temp banned. In in a ranked match someone kills someone else on his team befor the round ends, just for the fun of screwing with people, then does it in multiple matches in the near future should be banned for TK even though it's in different games
---
I sometimes TK by accident but ubi needs to get serious and be strict 
---
Yeah i was skeptical at first but after a few watches i don‚Äôt think you hit him once 
---
so you were playing siege with your pals the other deyyyy
---
(droning) Ash: Main lobby looks pretty clear, main stairs' good, I am going in hot.
---
(downed) Ash: What kind of scumbag must this guy be to put these fking kapkan traps here. Wtf
---
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt have done that, jus sayin
---
That's the point. This is a hitmarker you get when shooting a tachanka turret shield. Something blocked the headshot here and gave me the white hitmarker.

i like this idea

Rank doesnt mean nothing. Find people that are gold skill level not ranked. So if you have to play with people that are ranked above or below you so be it.

---
Oh yeah
---
1000/10
---
Also put telephones around the map that all go off when dokkaebi calls adding a nice layer of sound to mask your running
---
This is why I'd rather push to contest than hold angles while I roam.
---
Under Armor does make some tactical gear that includes thermal clothing and boots so it makes sense. They more than likely have some kind of deal with Ubisoft.
---
Lmao that's definitely not oil paint. No man in his right mind would use oil paint for this.
---
GSG9 often uses flecktarn. 
---
I took a break from Siege for a year or so. Then, spawn killing was considered peeking out from windows like on people typically do on consulate. Now, the defenders are becoming the attackers. 
---
I wish they‚Äôd stuck with the pseudo realistic vibe siege had at the start. 
---
I wish i had friends with gd morals like that . 
---
It sucks because I got black ice for the other one. Now I feel inclined to use it for it is my only black ice
---
Would you believe me if I said there's a very large portion of the community that actually plays Siege because its fun? And that not everyone plays just to sweat their balls off for 6 hours a day in casual?
---
Sweat all you want but do it in ranked, or at the very least do it at your real skill level and not on smurf accounts.
---
pretty sure I've played against you.
---
Lmao you only have cheats for this game, okay then
---
If you're holding an angle for a minute straight, you're playing Siege wrong
---
Oh wait I see what you mean lol my b, no I dont have any cheats for any games 
---
It happened to me so much i start intentionally looking away and flick back and ive gotten a few kills off it it's actually insane how often it happens
---
Decent, could be better. 
---
Yes
---
Wtf is a litoral 
---
I have never seen a mute spawn peeking 
---
OP, since you're a vigil main you may not know but that was a pretty bad strat when you're Caveira because obviously there are multiple people up there so you weren't going to get an interrogation easily plus your hand was covering your vision to the lower half of the stairs which meant you were also blind to that angle. 
---
You should play more aggressively or rotate to a different spot but try not stand in one spot like that especially as Caveira. If you're holding an angle like that one, maximise your use of cover by hugging the northeast wall of that stairwell and jest peek your head, you may have killed Finka with your 99dmg pistol if you hadn't been so exposed for the enemy.

---
If you had a shotgun, you could've also baited the lion scan and gotten a nice close quarters headshot.
---
When I mained this game I was a happy plat 3-2 player. And i can comfortably say that gold is the most toxic level of skill to get out of. No one plays as a team. And gets mad at the other players for all playing the same. Spawn peaking and running out with no call outs to help other people pick up for their shortcoming in aim. Even if you're good at the game you cant carry a team of toxicity through the trenches that are gold.

MEGA THICC
---
Depends on preference. I love Ela, her shotgun is one of my favorite guns in the game and her gyrzmot mines are fun as hell. I also love Zofia for her concussions and breaches. They're both great characters just depends on your play style. I recommend Ela if you're new and Zofia if you you want to start playing really aggressive.
---
Ela is great because you learn to play her differently as you get better. She's *adaptive*. When you first get her you use her as a kapkan and wait till the enemies get unlucky. When you begin to get better maybe you conserve your mines and use them more as grenades so you can tactically rush after enemies after using your mines on them. Her shotgun is easy to control and is high damage, it's my prefrence for the op. Her submachine gun has some kick to it but you can get used to it fairly quickly, her primary boils down to how aggressive you want to be. Her secondary is the same as Zofia's and is a pistol with a red dot sight. I love the pistol, especially when running the shotty with the extended barrel on it. I find it very useful. Ela is also a 1 speed which is a major advantage. 
---
Zofia, wonderful character too. She is also highly adaptive based upon your play style. She is similar to Ash but brings a whole new aspect to breaching into the equation. She has 2 concussion grenades and 2 breaching rounds. I love the breaching rounds because they instantly break the wall, the concussions also immediately concuss enemies. I use her rifle but she also comes with an LMG. She is a 2 speed 2 armor.  She is a great pick because she is more of a team player (unlike other rushers like ash). She is versatile and light on her feat. 
---
TL;DR It's up to you man, it's all preference. 
---
This is 100% true for me too
---
I love having Kiwis in my games, you guys are literally just us but so much nicer. Don't blame you for hating our accent though hahah.

This happens to me all the time

What's a recoil script?
---
Sick concepts I wish I could see a visual
---
One time I was holding a completely different angle and a blitz was trying to hip fire a teammate. He wall banged me through two walls and got a headshot. It was the stupidest lucky kill I have ever seen in my life
---
No recoil on game with gun 
---
you never heard tomato th Matt tho
---
You look more like Kapkan than Kapkan
---
Loooooooool that shit gets annoying. When your team all dies then they get mad at you for failing to clutch a 1v5 or 1v4 haha
---
Mmm like a macro?
---
Yes yes
---
Yes realism that‚Äôs how Ubisoft should balance a competitive shooter 
---
Any tips for improving call outs?
---
PS4 is pathetic rn
---
Bruh if it was me they still would have been calling me trash till I quit too lol. Super cool tho
---
I will explain this to you
---
First of all 1 person can only tk another person 1. On the second time they will get baned. Tho if they tk to difrent ppl they won't get band until they killed 3 difrent ppl. 
---
Second of all it's a mute button in the scoreboard
---
Third of all I can't see the reasoning to you tk them. They will anyways get baned if they tk you again wich would be much better right?? 
---
And last but not least they can have changed how many TKS it takes and on who and stuff to get banned/kicked. Cus you said you tk two different ppl. But I know for sure this was how it worked between chimira and grim sky. Pretty sure that it was like this in windbastion and I have no idea if they changed it or not in the new season
---
I heard of a friend before but friends? As in more than one !? 
---
I never wanted this image in my head.
---
It's because all solo q players are hardstuck in gold and there are some players in gold who would slap the shit off some plats they have some good like aim I can't even peek them

I have to use it though. its my only black ice gun

I dunno about Chaos but she looks like she's the shy girl with a crush on you. Either way looks great! Have an upvote.

This made me angry
---
The problem with the unforgiven offenses is what if these toxic people are running in front of their teamamtes line of fire to die and not forgive them to the point innocent players get in trouble and then ban?
---
At least it's not that legendary Lebel skin for the MP5 that I got. Might as well be a default gun skin smh ubisoft
---
They're all silver level players. We all roamed at the time so we didn't make a great team, which somewhat contributed. Either way, they still suffered as well, even when we played our best.
---
I got it in grim sky i belive. There are better common skins.
---
I wish when we reported a player for toxic behavior, Ubisoft reviews the match gameplay, audio, and text chat if your on PC to see the toxicity and then hand out punishments if necessary.
---
Both
---
Fair enough.
---
Or you know, playing with someone you played for a long time, suddenly they wouldn‚Äôt come back for a year.
---
i feel this video
---
Well... I‚Äôve gotten blind for echo 5 times in a row before
---
I'm John Rambo ...
---
They genuinely weren‚Äôt toxic, just incredibly stupid.
---
True
---
I'll be happy to see this everyone is abusing the ACOGs and never anchor so im left alone against blitz, glaz and ash + lion and dokkaebi as Jager on the objective, then they die while trying to take back the objective. Docs never heal you, rooks suck and honestly they don't deserve the acog
---
I seen people sabotage matches were they teamkill you or 2 people and then repeat it next round, they get kicked out the match and that team potentially loses 2 rounds in a row and then is down a person. This is why the report for toxic behavior button needs more options, I feel Ubisoft just made that a button same as a suggestion box and that suggestion box is emptied to the dumpster when it gets full.
---
Hi if you want I can try to help you my id is Gabri_Tremelli (I'm in eu) now I'm gold 3 but last season I was gold1/plat3 solo queue

I once had a group of guys I‚Äôd play with like this. We met in casual randomly one night while I was pulling an all nighter. First time I‚Äôve lost track of time like that. Before I knew it I looked up and it was 6:00 am. We played like that for a while but then I just kinda stopped playing siege and haven‚Äôt talked since.
---
And thats why we dont play with controller
---
yes?
---
Most player ideas for new ops are bad and will never be used even if they are good
---
holy shit thank you  conpletely forgot
---
Lol Nomad would be Ann.
---
Lol they even said the Ash acog is just the first to go. They are gonna remove it from the game entirely soon.
---
Yeah it sucks, but when your enemy does it and if its because you were droning and they were trying to kill the drone and kill their teammate you get so much joy, or you are in a gunfight and their teammate tries to join in and bullet sponges for you then dies from being shot in the back by their teammate which then either gives you the opportunity to kill the surviving enemy or have grace period to get cover mostly unharmed.

---
No worries my man I got you
---
Yea but you‚Äôre saying you should GAIN for losing, and just because you lose 4-0 doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt be there it could just mean you had a bad game
---
I'm well aware I quite enjoy flicking fools on MnK myself. That being said I swear I see sweaters on PS4 using MnK setups of some kind because I've seen ungodly 180s and shit. But I wish u luck in your journey out of Elo hell m8 
---
Supressor on the SASG-12... I can respect that
---
I'm not saying you should gain for losing. You should just lose less with super close games. And it doesn't matter if it was a bad game. If it was 4-0 you got smoked and should lose more. 
---
How did they have 2 round wins with zero kills lol
---
Hahahhaha They're good tho, hard working machines, I'd bet they could survive a 3 story fall or smth like that
---
Toile Bleue, it‚Äôs a legendary outfit.
---
U won, man, it means that u actually can)
---
I think you shouldnt lose rank when one of your teammates leave the game. Like still reward the other team but dont punish players who lose an unfair fight.
---
Just punish leavers way harder.
---
Always a split second later
---
Essentualy rendering burst fire nor any automatic weapon useless as only first 2 shots are accurate and the rest flies off, muzzle brake used to be better but that time's now gone
---
You know I was responding to a comment saying the rework was coming and it was clearly implied the rework would be the fix, right? 
---
Cheaters get only perma bans
---
I dont know wich rainbow six you're playing but mine dosent have a 5 minute intro, its about 1-2
---
Chat filter is trash... sometimes I type to my friends in my native language, which is Serbian. "3 times I died here already" translates to "3 puta sam umro ovde" which automatically raises chat filter because we all know what "puta" means... nothing ever happened so far tho...
---
You win/lose a lot more at the start
---
Usually they do it to make sure your team gets a ban, it‚Äôs happened to me once before
---
I might be wrong here but for my sitation that‚Äôs what happened
---
Plus everyone knows it's in doc's job description to spawn peek. It won't happen
---
big facts.
---
so true
---
The only reason its a laser is because its slow as shit, same goes for the Ump and cavs smg
---
I have to tk once every game because some dumbass isnt planting with only 3 seconds left  on the clock

This wont really help you from teammates picking off kills, mat activating is loud as it is right now, a simple onetap from 50 meters wont really stop people from picking off when you see an icon
---
&gt;flexing a skin anyone can get by sheer luck
---
I prefer 
---
&gt;flexing The OG pro league skins with Y1 S4 and Glacier
---
The other day I killed 2 people and my entire team died.  They started a vote to kick me and right after I killed another two and it was 1v1.  The last enemy gave away their position and I backed up and said 'you guys wanted to kick me because because you're impatient" and left the game.
---
It was more satisfying than any Ace would have given me.
---
How have you managed to convince yourself they're cheating?
---
Lol :D

Its still loud enough to distinguish, i'd say get a better headset? I mean i spread my mats litteraly to every single corner of the map and still know wich one went off
---
Unable to shoot while he's charging.
---
Just to clarify
---
never happening
---
Remember, spider man
---
yes eventually but should i go for it . 
---
No because you can't see the enemy as well when he kills you. 
---
Dont have a single one
---
Go to detroit i guess
---
BTW, if you encounter that issue, know that it is just a scaling error and all you need to do is press alt+Enter two times in order to fullscreen it again. 
---
I had a similar experience. One recruit frag grenade vs 4 white supremacists online.
---
The killcam is bugged, yes. However, not being able to see the enemy while they can see you (before you die) doesn't seem to be a bug as much as an unintended side effect of moving the camera. Either way, the system needs to be reworked again. 
---
read the patch notes addendum I think
---
20000 IQ
---
It's not about shaming myself, it's about not being able to enjoy the game. My entire day today consisted of disconnects, throwers (Not always on my team, sometime's it's regretful free elo) and general toxicity. Plus, it's not about skill level, as I'm pretty sure 50%+ of players in copper intentionally or unintentionally deranked from a higher rank, rarely anyone is actually bad enough to be placed in copper due to skill level.

To make it clear. 
---
\- You will lose ela as same as now.
---
\- And we just have a chance to roll alpha pack and rolling alpha pack isnt guarantee as all you know.
---
\- Losing like 5-4 means it was a really good fight. Both team deserve to win and it was a long match. 
---
\- Its just a consolation prize for losers. We cannot get an alpha pack even though we won 5-6 matches. So its not a big deal.
---
Just play situations my guy
---
The funny thing is my office chair broke so I actually decided to get a DXRacer and try one out. I love it!
---
125hp is good, the rest is spot on
---
Ah the Owen Wilson charm
---
So what you‚Äôre telling me is, 
---
regenerate 20x3 per 1 operator. That‚Äôs 300 HP possible regeneration on top of all her benefits.
---
Even doc‚Äôs DBNO state revive is 75HP. Thats 225HP possible regeneration at max, without Finka‚Äôs benefits, and he has to be in range of the downed player, whereas Finka can just tap a button.
---
Her gadget I believe does counter a Yokai blast btw, when you‚Äôre drunk and hit the boost it should go away.
---
You‚Äôd be able to just site if you were able to just revive from a frost trap too. Downed, boost, smoke, plant. Without droning just Sausage the way in.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the reasoning behind this buff, at all. She‚Äôd be so OP after this buff.

r u talking about how theres no maple leaf and no black on the "black ice"

To cheat the system, you flick off the angle then back on it to trick the siege gods to make the enemy push.

Did you spend 90k renown on it? 
---
Theres a spot you can jump there
---
‚ÄúM‚Äôgadgets‚Äù *tips fedora and throws EMP*
---
Thats not potato. Thats just controller.
---
They should do it like in CS:GO. Instead of how many teammates you can kill there should be a threshold of how much damage you can do to teammates before you get kicked.
---
With this, even if you keep getting downed by your teammates, they'll get kicked out of the game eventually...
---
Yup...:P it took me almost 100hours to earn 90000renown lol
---
Immediately pressed equip to all when i got mine
---
They restructured the game files to make future updates smaller, so your entire game is essentially getting re-downloaded
---
Finka doesn‚Äôt need a buff
---
And just when I thought I was done with siege... they pull me back in lol. Gott a get this charm lol

Crazy idea but we could just disable team damage. No no sorry

The community has been so creative with the drone holes.

First top west main on Chalet, then the window near landing on Villa, and now we have another insane drone hole strat on Coastline.

This is how Siege is staying alive. Credits to Coconut, DB and everyone of the players looking for better plays. Thank you

Why does that look like frozen 2

The subtitle seems.... off

*Visible confusion*

She is one of the inly operators in the game that is actually balanced. She is in a perfect spot, and had way too much utility with grenades. 
---
With Castle I don‚Äôt believe he is a priority for the devs at the moment, as they have/had bigger problems. Like Lion, Glaz, Shields, Dokk, Nomad and etc.

Same

Now think of the problems that would cause man

Doge!

you can, when starting a custom game select local instead of online and select your map and done :)

That was my first legendary in the game.

I see your point but when Lion calls out his EE-1D it feels like a lion‚Äôs roar on the map. But hey each to their own.
---
Why not? It's beautiful.
---
That's toxic.
---
Just to be clear wasn‚Äôt me that did it 
---
Yeah it can definitely take some getting used to but I‚Äôve been console all my life so I‚Äôm used to it

Look how they butchered my boy
---
Sounds like blitz+sledge 
---
I have like 600+ hours and i sometimes sound like that. I played solo in most of my time and never gave a flying f about names on locations
---
Advanced maybe? But with that you're supposed to only get 10 outbreak packs.
---
What did they do?? 
---
God, that you? 
---
It was and it was beautiful 
---
Understandable to be honest. I don't really play solo, but my friends (who have played for way longer) will call something out and I'll go "what" 
---
Im closing in on 1k hours and i still am like "hes in the kitchen" ans my friends just correct me like "no thats a bathroom" through shesr njmber of times i get it wrong
---
when I see you again, WOOAHHH OHHH OHHHH OHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Maybe it's because you literally did nothing to help and only fired one shot after round end?
---
Holy shit that face is menacing af. Can we please have this in game? üòÜ

Tbf he's on console, I would be even worse

The enemy is in the thingy where theres the boopy machine that goes pshh psh booOoOooozzpp

No u
---
We lost but it was a really funny game. I used to try hard last season and managed to almost get plat 1 but i was starting to get irritated a lot. I still try to win but i've been playing more relaxed so i enjoy it more, unfortunately that means i lose a bit more often :(
---
Game files, usually
---
ya know?
---
Was this Chalet and the valk cam being under the long, thing rectangular window in kitchen?
---
This sounds awfully alot like he is using his APU instead of his GPU.
---
go into a custom game alone, start recording, place the bullet-proof cam, stop-recording
---
would be the easiest way for you
---
I got the exact same glitch
---
The vote to kick system is flawed anyway.. all you need is more than one griefer and they don't get kicked.
---
I've got a mate that loved siege on my PC, bought it for PS4 and absolutely hated it.. kept getting kicked because he was new. He'd came over from cod, so had natural skill.. but the children just think it's funny.. problem is, they learn it's normal and do it to others.
---
Clutch or kick is the stupidist thing I've heard of in this game. 
---
Deploying a jammer 
---
It's typically ideal to incentivise the player behaviour you want instead of punishing the behaviour you don't. There's plenty of examples that can be given to support this. 
---
Granted, there is still a place for punishing unwanted behaviours, but carrot and stick work much better than just the stick alone.
---
can confirm, i have 1000+ hours and i only remember objective rooms or rooms with cool/unique stuff, like drum room in skyscraper.

Not gonna lie chief the left one should be acting as gridlock.  Maybe she didn‚Äôt ant to, but she‚Äôd sure as heck make it work.
---
"fix your mic retard"
---
Why rework a map when you can just make another. Call it Hereford 2.0 or some shit. I hate how ubi doesn't focus on what's best for the community, but rather focuses more on the eSports/Competitive side of the game.
---
The only reason they remade Hereford wasn't because it was unbalanced for ranked, but because it was too unbalanced for eSports.
---
Nobody I know likes the map in general, Barrel Storage is the only decent room that's fun to defend and attack.
---
that explains the main 
---
/s
---
Bro, not gonna lie, I still don't know like 90% of the maps and I know like none of the locations in each map.
---
What makes you think that? Honestly, I don't care what rank I am. If I'm so bad, at least let me be shit in piece. I can't enjoy ranked without my experience becoming collectively shat on by the cancer that is smurfing, throwing and any other general deranking. 
---
I'm fine thanks, but you don't know me, in case you were confused.
---
Love your art! 
---
Great clip!
---
There is a caviera in the building in one of the rooms
---
You mean 2F Taiko?
---
Yeah, and his hammer noise lasts for the entire game too, they buffed the living shit out of him. 
---
I do that all the time with frost mats, on the stairs when there's about 3 sets of them and only two have onr
---
Thank you sir!
---
it's really good but if youre coming from overwatch and console it will be an absolutely massive change of pace, both of those are quite slow. if that's what you want tho siege is amazing, even if the learning curve is kinda steep. 
---
Your kd means nothing regarding whether or not you cheat though.
---
Well it is the thought that counts
---
Thanks man! Haha
---
And perfect! For 16$ I think it'll be worth it.
---
Since we aren't getting a new splinter cell game anytime soon :(
---
Nice
---
do you have 2fa?
---
Well you can given as all modern gpu software has recording stuff built in.
---
ESL level callout
---
I play PS4, as such I'm always in a party talking to friends either when I'm playing alone or with a buddy or two. This automatically mutes everyone in game no matter how many friends I'm playing with. One time I decided to just not be in a party. I would mute myself and simply let my teammates talk and not care much hut try and win. I actually got a team who gave good call outs and I could trust them. Then the next game I kept the in game voice chat on and I was kicked immediately because they felt like it. The community in two extremes.
---
I'm in this post and I don't like it.
---
I can accept the learning curve. I really need to practice and perfect keyboard and mouse. So all games are welcome!
---
I understand that, but if I was accused of ‚Äúmultiple‚Äù offenses you  would think the person accused would be higher. 
---
Upvote for normal gloves (If I remember correctly, Mute have rubber gloves)

No. I've seen utterly fucking useless cheaters.

In game, Toile Bleue definitely stands out from the original uniform, it's a much different shade of blue from any of the other GIGN uniforms, and anything else Rook has.  That being said, it being a different shade of blue is really the only thing about it that you notice.
---
That sounds like me
---
That's the plan, or at least get a refund since I have less than 2 hours
---
Same here EU servers
---
I love Bnans! Glad she got a charm! 
---
That‚Äôs honestly a very unpleasant surprise, knowing that you were hacked and got banned on a game you didn‚Äôt own, and never knew about it until you bought the game 
---
old one is actually worse than the new one, but people hate the new one because it fuck up their PC performance with rain effect. Also the new one require more teamplay while the old one, you can just hold the main stairs, put a claymore in the red container's stair and then 1F and 2F is completely shut down from roaming.
---
As well as it still brought you through the intro and everything
---
Lots of the map is unnecessary and it never sees usage, the colora are dreary and hard to distinguish, none of the rooms feel distinct enough and the map itself is not actuallh balanced well.
---
Top floor is always defender sided, bottom floor is the actual balanced one, and everything in the center of the buildimg is easily forgettable.
---
I have it. 
---
This is some big fax
---
Lol, this photoshopped or a bug?
---
I have to be honest, the bots in rainbow are pretty trash. If this feature was set, the bots would be the first to die anyday. If they were put to be really good, people will kick their players for bots. If anything, make it so if you die and there is a player missing, you can play again to make up for the missing player, but that can also be pretty unfair. 
---

Good luck for trying to hit plat in solo, its hell. 
---
Whatever it is, as a shield user it's super annoying.

Exactly lol, I figure some dickwad had cheating software he wanted to test, but didnt want to risk getting his main account hacked. My email was flooded with account sign ins from Malasia, Japan, Germany, random places so I figure it was a VPN
---
It's up again now!!
---
Yes thank you, this is very useful.
---
You are bad.
---
I'm glad people do actually enjoy this style. I've never really been a fan of the crazy adhd edits that need to constantly zoom around adding overlays or memes every half second. It's way too much. I do enjoy fast edits, but usually only when stuff is edited to music and the song is fast.
---
Nothing scarier than hearing a warning not meant for you
---
New operator for Ash mains so that they actually do something when they just rush in to die.
---
Hey we can play on the banned server together lol 
---
r/frickthirdsub
---
Yup that why its in beta in what year 3 or is it 4 now lol. They should allow players to play rank within a margin like bronzes with silvers, silvers with golds, golds with plats, and plats with diamonds. Blizzard does that with Overwatch, they won't let a Top 500 play with a bronze and stomp on all the golds, plats, and diamonds.
---
Not for me :(
---
Yeah, this isn‚Äôt a new theme sadly. This has been their main way of attacking the game. Some hackers say that accounts such as yours would literally only cost pennies because of how many of these accounts there were, and how easy they were to hack. It‚Äôs sad that this was the case, but I hope that your case gets solved soon, the VPN thing might help you out. 
---
They could be like csgo bots with simple commands and dead players can take them over.
---
You aren‚Äôt using frags?
---
 Have been playing seas for the last 3 hours . Seems working for me . Well guess u gotta wait 
---
I would just purchase season passes from websites like g2a. It will be cheaper and you won't need to grind
---
Stupid fucking rule. I don't get why the mods here are so shitty about it. There are basic self promotion guidlines for reddit already and they work fine on every other sub that uses them.
---
I have this operator but i cant play them or buy them again
---
Such a bummer. Wish ubisoft would take more steps to prevent this but it's also my bad for never checking my account. But now with 2 step and a new password hopefully itll get resolved. Cheers for the good wishes

I guess that could work, but the bots would be pretty useless most of the time until they are controlled. You should also have more control over them, like assign their loadout/class or order their strategies (that is, with no denying unlike counterstrike) because in a ranked game order is needed and a bot needs to listen.
---
Honestly its really needed, and i know its not simple but keyboard and mouse on ps4 at least is a huge issue in high gold, its a real struggle to get above gold with a controller as you're a minority from gold1 and above. If they allowed k+m without the adapter thing but put you with other k+m players (like fortnite) maybe 
---
Its up, yea

In Siege, the camera *used* to slide to the edge of your head when you leaned, since holding tight angles and one-shot headshots are such integral parts of the game and the devs wanted you to be able to see anyone who can see your head (if you are looking at them, obviously).
---
Of course, everyone has his own way to play and that's a good one too

But medics are the first ones to get killed.

A campaign? Wow something that Siege should have since its charged full price and has a bunch of characters that are basically recruits since they have no development or struggle. Asides Ela.
---
F for old club too.
---
You are a man of intelligence I can see
---
OOF.. Nerf Incoming
---
why there are not both maps?
---
old and new hereford
---
I miss emo hibana
---
&gt;Plus small things could fester into big ones later on due to operators that may be over powered
---
Yes but if they haven't made those ops yet they're not going to know if it's overpowered either.
---
Came
---
Have you considered lesion?
---
I'm racking my brain trying to figure out what map/room that is and I've got nothing
---
Congrats man, also, no extended barrel on it?
---
Such beauty. 
---
Nicest way to comment about this situation
---
chill dude 
---
I mean at least he got the kill
---
That attachment really is just a way for masochists to punish themselves harder.
---
My favorite one from a guy that I used to play is "watch out he is in the corner, be careful" and then if the guy kills me he says "I told you so" :P
---
And it‚Äôs completely unreal how they use two arms to aim and shoot their gun at you and somehow grow a third arm to press their detonator switch with.
---
Can just imaging after 30 seconds of that just dumps this UNIT of a magazine 
---
I relate so hard to both of these situations
---
I don‚Äôt prefer extended on it 
---
shes a girl friend who you cheated on but regret it so much whyyyyyyyy whyyyyy did  I cheattttttt 
---
Add a copper 4. Doesn‚Äôt matter what they were doing prior, pull them out of their game and force them to be the replacement. There‚Äôs probably a 50% chance they won‚Äôt even notice it happened.
---
I miss man hibana 
---
They have a vault of ideas that they could use and maybe they are basing the reworks off that or where lots of people get killed from or wasted real estate
---
perfect that‚Äôs exactly what i was looking for!
---
i watch all 3 of these guys so it‚Äôs great thank you
---
old, just because it actually looks like a real face
---
im all for making her actually look asian, but the new one just looks
---
so
---
bad
---
like i have no clue how it‚Äôs so inconsistent, it looks so much worse than the elite skin‚Äôs face it‚Äôs honestly mindboggling
---
i used to be quite good at this editing style , until the ADHD generation told me to fuck off , now every video upvoted is reeeeeeee style.
---
Pffff. I dont understand what there is to complain about. You got a shit ton of skins and non-buyeble with real money loot boxes. Its not like the game is supposed to give you fun or work properly, not in Ubi\`s mind it is.
---
dont we all. it was much more funner than the new one.
---
screw prolegue balance. thats why you got 3 maps that are basically the same damn map.we want fun maps.  outbacks finally a good new map thats fun to play on.
---
bring back old hereford and just call it hereford us  then the new hereford uk or something. just stop ruining the fun.
---
Well u get what I mean
---
I got a black ice last night on my first ever pack, I didn‚Äôt even know it was rare. (New player)
---
Glaz would dominate if it carried over their abilities and weapons. 
---
Sure. I think there are other gadgets that should be implemented before the a 3rd grenade launcher, but sure 
---
*everyone disliked that*
---
2 OP for Ubi
---
If you don‚Äôt play with a squad then rank doesn‚Äôt matter really. You paid for this game to have fun and that‚Äôs what you should be doing. You aren‚Äôt gonna put that rank on your cv anyway.
---
I had the d2 beta I guess I gave me access I'm not sure but free charm
---
With that aim it probably would've never hit IQ.
---
What's your gamertag? I just started playing after a year long hiatus last week
---
Then buy boosters.. 
---
I have the issue on ps4
---
You deactivated the bomb when you hit him through the wall
---
Nah bro it ain‚Äôt the hit box. I emptied 2 and a half clips from IQ‚Äôs pistol into one‚Äôs chest and he still trucked me.
---
Or the right operator
---
I‚Äôve been here since Velvet and never seen it as an issue. Maybe it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt have to worry about buying as many DLC ops but the headgears and all aren‚Äôt issues. Just play the game. If you are that concerned about a headgear just buy it
---
Can we please stop talking about he old one? Seriously like we get it, you miss it, but just face the facts that it‚Äôs never coming back. I personally hated the old map because every round consisted of constant spawn peeks and runouts. And while many people fail to see the old map in the new one, I can clearly see where everything was and how everything has changed. I don‚Äôt get lost playing this map. I praise the current Hereford for being way more enjoyable than the old one because of rotation capabilities and the many ways you can enter the building. The current one even represents the one in Clancy‚Äôs literature more accurately. 
---
Hate me all you want, but honest to god that if you take the actual time to learn new one, then maybe you‚Äôll come to realize why it‚Äôs a significantly better version of the old one.
---
It's worse on battle royale games. People just expect you to know EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY SAY "HE'S OVER THERE" LIKE WHERE. IS OVER "THERE"????? 
---
Youre not one of those guys that as soon as they die they just start point out obvious things are you? It seems to happen quite a bit and its worse in a 1v1 situation where sound is important and *you* arent saying anything really meaningful or that the person alive doesnt already know like saying that theyre in the next room when the guy clearly knows.  
---
  
---
Just saying. Just because youre making callouts, doesnt necessarily mean theyre helpful.
---
twitch/valk
---
the hitboxes arent the clothes no more...
---
maybe if you hold the reload button
---
Of course there are buttons for it....
---
It‚Äôs the Jager face reveal!!!
---
New
---
Bomb?  It was standard TH
---
Not really. If you have a hard breachers yes you should assist them but think about all the other traps you can remove and make your own/and your team's life easier. Gu mines, Kapkan traps, Ela mines, Jager ADS, disabling pulses and vigils gadget to give you a warning ect. Once you've assisted your team, you can really play Thatcher however you want. Don't forget you have breaching charges for vertical play to get kills or drop your emp through the steel beams. 
---
Unfortunately on ps4 it is not possible.

---
Its about placement
---
Haha sucks...it's so lame when the other team doesn't wanna play along at least to have a fun win. Coz they're gonna win anyway, on a 1v5 they can't actually feel threatened. Might as well just let us have fun then take the win in peace and go about your day lol 
---
The only way this could be better is if he had tbagged IQ after he killed her, like he thought he did something awesome.
---
Rattle me bones!!!
---
i literally had the same problem i droned out the window and prefired without missing a bullet but still got caught. im thinking it could be to do with the new camera placement but im not sure  [https://youtu.be/tqtaHcgtiO8](https://youtu.be/tqtaHcgtiO8)

No no no nope nopedy nope

Whats with these black ice things? Why are they so famous?

For those that don't yet know of this bug, one player joined, yet is "loading forever". I don't know why maybe hes not even here he probably left during loading or something. 
---
Tldr; one person wont load and hes not even here
---
why is your language chinese
---
2 weeks ago I was forced to surrender because I had to deal with an unholy amount of stress and getting rushed by Finka booster Mouse and Keyboard users wasn‚Äôt helping.

Ya gotta call out East Stairs, South Stairs, Center Stairs, etc to be more specific. Not enough people use the compass for that

My call outs in a nutshell cuz I don‚Äôt know all the locations lol
---
That guys an idiot, there could have been a delay in comms. From what I know if you play on console there‚Äôs about a 1 second delay so he *might* have said that a bit too late
---
I started doing this more this past weekend and its insane how many more battles I win
---
I have some friends that do this as well.
---
I think having 2-3 different sensitivities is fine, its just harder to get consistent if every individual game has a different sensitivity.
---
&gt;Medics are the only ones to get healed.
---
Fixed it further
---
Directional is the least useful call outs. Everywhere uses some form of identifiable feature, mainly colours, to aid in callouts. If you use directional, the person maybe holding an angle has to glance down to check direction and potentially miss a kill as a result. 
---
For example consulate going upstairs you have spiral, visa and yellow. Using key features or locations to call it means everyone knows where it is. 
---
waste of time and resources for the game, how about adding something useful like, solo rank queue option or better sound in the game
---
Your point? I'd find it sad if someone with more capability for precision from a mouse and keyboard wouldn't have more rapidly precise aim than someone with analog sticks. That's why mouse and keyboard on console is a bannable offense for the noticeable step up it provides.
---
My point was that not all console players have bad aim (and that player may have just panicked, everyone does from time to time), we have our own parameters of accuracy and precision. Diamond and Plat' matches, for PS4 at least, you better have the shot, predict the angle, etc., or you're dead. There's a noticeable difference between PC and Console controls, but each have their own varying marks of skill if that makes any sense. Have a good day Chun'. ü§ó
---
Mans stole my joke
---
But Doc can heal himself
---
Like you said, you're new to the game, so I wouldn't expect you to understand how trolling in this game is. Like someone else stated, usually trolls are with a friend or two, which would make the vote kick option useless. Also, lots of people say yes to vote kicks just for the hell of it, even if they aren't trolls. 
---
You are the only platinum still playing against other plats. 
---
I climb a lader boom, head shot ny doc, right as it all starts
---
Almost impossible to play siege alone now without my squad, nobody understands callouts or anything
---
Neither?

Haha 
---
I am a 258 Silver 1. Some of my friends are high gold and some are copper. It is what it is.
---
Lmao 
---
Its on general, show statistics or data, something like that.
---
I've been waiting for someone else to say it. Same here. I've been playing Siege since beta - I'd argue that it's practically an entirely different game now, compared to before. I miss it.
---
i tink u spooked im good.
---
I think a unique idea would be to add another bridge thats a level higher or having the two bottom areas connect with hallways and more bomb site areas/connecting rooms. Definitely connecting the two buildings is Kanal's largest problem imo, as well as having very predictable bomb sites. Still one of my favorite maps as it was the first map I played on oh so long ago.
---
Just to let u guys know he is using a plug in adapter for recoil macros and no recoil...still a good clutch but wouldn‚Äôt of happened without zero recoil every bullet.
---
If you roll solo, Jackal or Vigil.

I would really like to have his view of the clip

Maybe could use more weapon gadgets

Wooooowwwwwwwww that‚Äôs crazy, I never seen that post until right then.

Its all good
---
The thing is there next to the stuff you know? East
---
Why? So we can watch a 1v5 with 2:45 left to go, *where the 1 guy left alive drones the map for 2 mins 30 secs only to die trying to* ***finally enter the building?***
---
 Just...... **NO**
---
If you're taking Casual so seriously that you feel cheated over teammates leaving, then you may want to question life just a *little bit more.*
---
If you want to be serious, Here's 2 *realistic* options:
---
1. Realize the **Fact** that one's rank in R6 **literally has no representation of one's "skill".** (*some will try to argue this, only because they want to "wave something around" &amp; justify telling all teammates they're "trash" whilst spectating drones. Ignore them).* By adopting that reality, you'll most likely have the balls to play ranked &amp; start doing so.
---
2. Suggest to Ubi &amp; the Dev team a 3rd "Hardcore" playlist that plays just like ranked does, but isn't ranked.
---
Smells like BS. If you kill yourself it is suicide. It doesn't tag a teammate as the killer.
---
He killed himself to frame you? I think this was a plot arc on *Downton Abbey*. 
---
Why are there so manny fucking Doc roamers?
---
Lol
---
&gt; A lot of people aren‚Äôt comfortable talking online &amp; some just refuse to.
---
If you cannot, then fair enough. If you simply don't want to, then you're a cunt for playing a mp game that demands communication.
---
&gt;This would allow for less toxicity, for example, as you could ping a wall and choose the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt reinforce here‚Äù, if you need it for a particular strat, rather then just shooting the teammate when they don‚Äôt do what you want.
---
or, you know, have a mic.
---
Room mine btw.
---
Who tf deleted vertical recoil on console?????
---
Removing his self stim (give him two stims in return for the nerf) would solve this.
---
They all look like Gridlock now
---
OH GOD. LORD TACHANKA SAVE US
---
It's am\* 
---
The day that happens i will quiet siege, need my acog with rook daddy
---
So give him some friendly advice
---
It's what I see when I have sleep deprivation. That's all that Blitz is scared of. 
---
Mira or Valk
---
Or the fuze ace where you kill 11 people 
---
*cough cough* fortress and Hereford 
---
Was this birmingham uk or us because if it was uk i would be sad cos i live there and couldve come lol
---
Time to bring back BC2 Medics with LMGs!
---
no, clash
---
When Kap put his traps down they also had a red laser for the attacker to see it and destroy it, though I see claymore as a deterrent from going through a window, door etc
---
Nope, I wouldn‚Äôt label someone a cunt for not wanting to talk. And what platform do you play on?
---
What a gamer
---
Oof. I think they changed something in your camera perspective. Matimi0 did a video with a similar thing happening to him. Looks like you have to take angles at a bit more of a distance now idk 
---
Can we just remove it from the game entirely?
---
It seems to be the opposite when I actually play blitz. My flash seems hit or miss. It feels like I‚Äôm using a disposable Walmart camera flash
---
&gt; Nope, I wouldn‚Äôt label someone a cunt for not wanting to talk
---
Not wanting to talk after choosing to play a game like siege.
---
&gt;And what platform do you play on?
---
PC, yes I know you have lobbies and all that stupid shit.
---
*skyrim opening scene*
---
"Fuck you my Dad works at Ubisoft"
---
I haven't played in months, why did they change it?
---
Inb4 not Sau-Siege
---
It‚Äôs more likely a de-sync between the players in the match. You were in a slightly different location for him is probably what happened.
---
Ubi likes it when you search through their shit menus.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to it. But at the same time a lot of operators wouldn't have voice lines to go with them
---
I remember emptying a whole glaz magazine into one's back and it didnt die. DONT MIND ME JUST TAKING 11 HEAVY CALIBER SNIPER BULLETS INTO MY BACK

Bikini will remember that

It used to happen without lag. Stupid windows wouldn't read as open on the server and the nade would go in on your screen, the boomerang back to your face. Nades were pretty useless back then, couldn't trust them at all.
---
It was not an accident
---
* Incoherent Swearing *
---
Fortress yes but I honestly live new Hereford as unpopular an opinion as it is. To be fair I never played old Hereford and it looked amazing
---
3 years playing on this map and I has no idea. Ty op
---
That was so console.
---
quit lying kid. that‚Äôs not how it works 
---
Best thing I saw today
---
Nah
---
They still do? They are the current Gold medal holders. 
---
Rework your title to NEXT year. Because the reworks are as follows Cafe, Kanal, Theme Park.
---
Yeah I wish this post got more traction I‚Äôd like an explanation 
---
Why do people whine about ranking down? You'll get back up if you deserve to be that rank by playing more.
---
Hes probably a ps4 player y'know
---
Yeah, but what do they gain from it, like honestly
---
I think they should only be online for a set time like 1-1.5 minutes
---
It‚Äôs called a technical ace
---
Otherwise awesome op idea
---
I know right. The obsession over ACOG is unreal especially with this. The ACOG doesn‚Äôt even belong on that weapon
---
I'm not Canadian enough to care about that.
---
why the fuck did you get downvoted lol
---
They seem to think it‚Äôs hilarious.
---
Oh it‚Äôs there, lol. I think they reduced it a bit for console because you‚Äôre using thumbsticks to control it, but it‚Äôs still tough to manage sometimes. I‚Äôve just done way too much practice on controlling it lol. Like, an unhealthy amount of time. 
---
Can confirm: I am costcopizza1
---
Have you ever played on console?
---
I miss old hereford, hate new one. Least favourite map of all time
---
You could play ranked, or just verify the integrity of the game files...

There's really no counter to being beaned in the back of the skull other than "just make sure your rear is clear". It doesnt seem like a hard and fast rule.

The laser is the only other one I can see a down side with. Mainly because the opposing team can see the red dot.

I would only use it on weapons that are going to give away your position anyways.

All attachments are an improvement except for certain guns where I like the iron sites better.

The reason it seems dumb now is because you are new and attachments didn't used to be free, you had to buy them with renown before.

If I remember correctly, during the Invitational they said they're going to add an underground tunnel. I can't remember the other changes, but that one stuck with me.
---
In general all attachments make the guns better but some attachments can be a lot better than others (compensater - muzzle attachment), and some worse in curtain situations (like the lazer sight - because other players can see it). Personally I recommend using a silencer on your pistols and use a vertical grip with a compensator on your primary (if you have the chance use a acog, but if you can't for that gun use a reflex or holo - it's your choice) 
---
Looks like Kapkan stole Fuze's AK

yeah its my first. liked the style of pixel art so I tried to go with one of my favorite operators and this was the product
---
Ur aim sucks

What are u gonna do about it
---
The people doing the animations are not the people in charge of the sound system or networking. One team could be twiddling their thumbs while the other is doing what the community wants for all we know.
---
Heck
---
Judge you
---
Cue saying the other team is shit and various insults
---
Thing about Rook, more so than any other defender, you rely on your teammates doing something for your gadgets to be useful (picking up plates). Blessing and a curse I suppose. 
---
CHEEKY

 I can kind of find my way around fortress walking around, but I‚Äôm still completely lost on my drone. Outback, however, I find very straightforward and easy to understand.

Wtf do yo u think this is Epic Games? No it's Ubisoft they are litterally doing things because they want they add new ops with access to ultra instict and then they nerf weak ass ops into Oblivion like look at blackbeard

I have a group of 10 guys that I normally play with. The problem is I'm at least in the top 3 (I'd like to think so), so when I have a bad game, unless someone else drops around 12+ kills, we tend to lose. This puts so much pressure on me that I focus so much on trying to perform, and less on actually enjoying the game

Shush cheater, you got banned because you have been HWID banned on previous accounts so when you play the game battleye picks up your HWID and bans you again.
