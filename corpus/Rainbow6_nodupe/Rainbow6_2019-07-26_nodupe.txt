he arched his back because he was trying to hit me.
---
Little did you know but rainbow takes place in the past and is actually a sim for new recruits and you just founds rooks grave
---
Oh I meant I hate as in I want black ice for the gun. It is bad on it though. Just want it for the rarity.
---
Fuze is so much fun
---
Like I hate the guy that got it.
---
You're lucky he didn't hit that...
---
you do 2 sets on a corner so you can crouch through it, the last one you can either make one on the other side of the reinforced wall like a mira window or get a hatch
---

---
if it's being bandit tricked, you do 1 set only in between 2 reinforcements at the bottom so you can scare away the bandit

Hey stop flexing with your 2+ plus black ice

That's actually pretty good. Even a 1.0 is above average, if you count TKs and falling.

Damn

Bruh, my bi-curious amigo and I were teamkilled the whole game and got messaged that we sucked, we were sucking that game but the whole team was and my bi-curious amigo and I single handed lee won the only round for us, the rest was them tking us and us tking them in revenge.  I can post a gamer tag of one who messaged me if you want to shame them.

*^(very weird)*

I was disappointed
---
Yes I have 1500 hours in game I know it‚Äôs a good gun, I‚Äôm saying I think the thought process is that new players see the gun has higher damage and assume it is better

Hey man, thanks for that. Headset just arrived today from

Newegg and it‚Äôs no joke best feeling headset I‚Äôve experienced yet.

She looks like a moped rider
---
I really like it
---
It‚Äôs even worse when people smurf in newcomer matches and scream/TK people who are still trying to learn the game.
---
Snapped right after he walked through the doorframe. Yep thats a poorly adjusted Aimhack
---
Account is lv 73 was never ranked. Only last season gold 2 and now plat 3.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The thing that he aimed so fast at the right spot without overshooting it or correcting the aim at all are clear signs of "letting the hack doing the work"
---
Just watch the video frame by frame. It took him like one frame for this.

Oh thank you! üòÖ I really appreciate it.

yeah your probably right

Oh wait there was more than one black ice. I commented w/o watching the whole thing.

Yea doubt they have a botnet or are using LOIC. That is what makes it so hard to control.

LUL i even found the hack youre using through comparing your mouse movemnts you did in the last 2 seconds.

Its the same movement you need to get to the aim settings in the R6S hack from Crazy Coders.

Near freezer there is a good corner to watch the freezer and back entrance. Near the bomb by bakery that window is a good place to peak and hold that room especially if you reinforce the walls close to the door. In the large kitchen area where the two sets of walls that need reinforcing you can hold in a number of spots. And I assume if your teammates are bad the enemy team isn't the greatest either so some hard breach denial should hold those. And a roamer or even a peak from the back entrance should hold the one side really well. You just need to find some friends that know what they are doing and you'll be good.

One of my inspirations was Ghost Recon. It also canonically exists in the same universe because it‚Äôs in wildlands albeit a prototype. The actual look of the optical camo could be similar to that of wildlands.

It's pretty simple, most languages are really easy when you know English as a base language, since there are enough similarities.
---
For example I know Russian, Hebrew, English and now also learning German, but took a break since focusing on other stuff, but it was pretty straight forward.
---
Easy way to start is to use Duolingo, which provides you a good start and foundation for it, but it definitely won't make you good and able to communicate yet, since for that you need other sources.
---
Duolingo is great for the vocabulary, but for the rest it's not that great.

---
Holding the top point was balanced in favor of defenders which is why they added a new hatch and more windows. It was nowhere near as meaningful as a change as reworking the bottom floor, which is why I didn't feel the need to get into it. Happy?

You do know that if you stand directly under somebody you can't hit his/her head right? That's the reason you had to shoot for so long.

Well I was unaware of that. Anyway, please can both of you things stop accusing people just for the sake of it? It is fucking pathetic.

Meme strat or actual strat. Meme strat for me would just be m870 rush ( yes i know its super lame, old, and unoriginal) but actually strat probably have two people pick off roamers while two more work the anchors and have one plant while the anchors are distracted.

Ok there's no problem there when a silver 1 plays like an actual silver when and is a liability on a match, they bring lower ranked opponents bc they can't compete with higher rank ones.
---
But then there's the copper IV plays like a high gold or even plat, because he isn't an actual liability like his rank tells the game, he is just there for bringing lower ranked opponents to have an easier match, if he was actually a copper IV and was a liability I get that ubi matches him with worse opponents for him to have a chance of winning, but when the copper IV is playing on a smurf and is moderately good at the game, it becomes a massacre, bc the copper fools the game to think he's bad but he actually isn't
---
We need more gameplay changing ops like Mira. A new hatch operator would change the flow of certain rooms.
---
his shield has like 60 health now
---
Never saw a need for it he's easy to deal with Monty is a different story if the enemy is good
---
Meatymarley  would be so happy if this ever happened to him

Geez you dont have to get so mad about it. I'm allowed to have an opinion, you know. It's not a crime.

Not very kind to call me a "thing", and yes I will stop because there is nothing to get here.
---
It was originally 800 and went down to 60 then to 50 but that is the joke of it all
---
Explain to me this then; why the living fuck would I post something on a social media page that has people who work for ubisoft if it was cheating? You aren't answering that question you silly little child. It's really pissing me off because both of you little kids are the most pathetic spoilt little shits I have ever seen online. It is a joke how you are not accepting this and how you are trying to prove something that is not true. It is pointless because it is not cheats and I will not get banned because I am not using external software.

What? You literally admitted to using cheats. I have reported you enjoy your account getting banned

Yeah there's no point only makes the have a better chance of winning

My fatass thought this was a pepperoni pizza

Well I agree with some of the new maps but some the strongest ops are from vanilla or shortly after, in fact the most recent ops are both pretty bad. Nokk is playbale and Warden is barely more useful than a recruit.

Take the Rose tinted glasses off bud. Siege is in one of the best spots it has ever been in right now. Not the BEST. But certainly better than launch and most of year one.

Nomad 100%. She‚Äôs pretty strong overall and her gadget can really hinder rotation or make enemies very vulnerable.

According to Ubi‚Äôs own data, Nokk is currently the second worst Attacker, which isn‚Äôt much to say since Glaz is the first one and now he‚Äôs getting buffed

Fuze is like uhh i didnt do that OH SHIT RUN

Favela is my favorite map and is well liked among most of the people I play the game with. Stop assuming your opinion is fact.

I miss year 2 season 2, like right around there was the sweet spot when vigil came ouy

Favela was taken out of ranked faster than any other map. It is a fact.
---
Yeah with Mozzie destruction is your friend, he's so underrated in my opinion, he can gather intel, deny intel, whilst also frag out with an exceptional loadout, and is one of 3 operators that can somewhat detect Nokk on his gadget, both Gridlock and Mozzie are excellent for any team.

I've had this 3 times in the last week.  With a drone ( have a vid somewhere )  Hatch was broken ( I was Buck ) drone would drop, hit floor, rubber band back above and drop again.  Teammates said hatch wasn't broken on their view.

I got a smurf to meme with 4 other friends in ranked and ended up getting a way higher rank then I should get. The system is broken

Don‚Äôt generalize all smurf accounts, I have a smurf account I don‚Äôt overdo it when I‚Äôm in gold and platinum. I make it a competitive and fun match, although I carry a lot there‚Äôs nothing I can do about that. I don‚Äôt sweat, I‚Äôm not toxic, I‚Äôm not throwing. I try to be the most positive teammate whenever I do talk, and I do my part even tho, I COULD crush players but that‚Äôs not fun in lower ranks cuz the joy of crushing a team is more intense in high plat for me. Cuz that‚Äôs my caliber. So pls stop generalizing all smurfs into a toxic problem. Ur being counter intuitive by doing that

So basically like his normal one (except you can see his face) right?

Black ice is pretty rare, and it looks hella sick.

Iirc it also has to do with your personal contribution

What‚Äôs a ‚Äúp**ppost‚Äù?
---
Prob send the videos and link them to Microsoft. By email or tweet and make sure you say that he is using MnK and that he doesn't deny it
---
You should've launched an intercontinental puck to hit the hostage in another map.
---
Ah ok, that would be cool and make protecting the defused and sticking as a team more serious. However, it would make interrogations more rare in high rank due to the increase of security and would consider a higher skill use of cav to pull these off.
---
Wooooosh
---
Yes and no, whilst switching ops can keep you refreshed and varied, practising a lot with one operator can help you perform the best with him, but I'd only recommend doing this with universal meta operators, those that can work no-matter the situation. At the end of the day its always best to work on your game-sense rather than which operator to main. I will like you use all the operators, but I will always default to Rook/Zofia because of the utility the provide to the team, and at the end of the day that's all that matters, what you bring to the team. So in conclusion always be prepared to vary your approach but its advisable to default to a universally beneficial operator.

---
I get 12 MMR per game... its not really fun anymore.
---
Oh god I totally understand. M&amp;K abuse is a huge problem on console and unfortunately ubisoft has no way to stop it. Trust me, with enough dedication you WILL be able to reach your desired rank. It just takes time and practice. I was hard stuck gold for over a year. You can look me up (Hippo.ZG). It took nearly a year to develop my skill to where I am now. You can do it. You just gotta put in the work.
---
Enjoy death faggot

I guess what I should have said is an opinion that anyone takes seriously. You can have an opinion, but no one cares about it because of how uneducated you are on the subject matter.

One of the seasonal skins during the first dlc (operation black ice) was the black ice skin. It has since became famous for being really cool and also rare since the game was no where near as popular then. The release of alpha packs meant people could get it who weren't around during y1 s1 but that's the only way. I started y1 s1 and every time I see someone get black ice I cry a little inside because I didn't get it when I had the chance (getting a seasonal gets it for all the weapons at the time the skin is released).
---
No it does not mean you play like a diamond, nor they play worse than a silver. It‚Äôs literally just their MMR for the gamemode, and they are matched with the same MMR range
---
I have almost the same experience. Had 14 days play time on Xbox. Took a year break and went over to PS4. Def alot of Smurf accounts.
---
Nobody expects the double claymore
---
Holly shit you actually spent all that time doing the math just to prove someone wrong props to you man holly shit now that‚Äôs commitment
---
Im blocking u cuz ur annoying byeeeeee
---
\*your
---
103 and only black ice for ashes pistol
---
Very goodüëåüëå
---
Shut the fuck up nigger who said you had the right to speak to me?
---
Ok Krash
---
What was that smoke doing???
---
U needa pipe the FUC down
---
I wouldn't call it overrated, it's just annoying seeing everybody who get's Black Ice go crazy over it on Reddit. Not like I have every one and I'm tired of seeing it, I have like 6
---
I guess Zofia couldn't withstand life anymore :'(
---
I honestly think smurfs should get banned,it becomes unfair for other players.
---
I hate the way it looks
---
Anyways you did well
---
but thats like so similar, I dont really see that as smurfing. They are both plat you know?
---
touche
---
I'm at work and reddit on the quiet... not so quiet anymore... I laughed so loud.  Def Gu mine though
---
You think it would have been like Thor hitting cap‚Äôs shield?
---
I mean I guess but still. Now its committing a crime, getting caught and then becoming a sponsored motivational speaker that tells kids not to do what he did. Still a murderer.
---
So are stick extenders and any other kind of controller attachment, but I don't hear you whining about how those are cheater because "it's controller". I think people just like blaming the fact that they're bad at the game on someone using mouse and keyboard because I've gone up against a mouse and keyboard user more than once and it's wasn't really that bad, maybe if your using all the crazy things that come with an adapter then it's cheating yeah, but if you just using a ray mouse and keyboard then no Its not really "cheating"
---
Sometimes it only shows in certain situations. Like I said it‚Äôs probably not that, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was that.
---
I'm not into alpha packs I just buy what ever I think looks cool
---
Ah yes when siege had life
---
Thank you man!
---
lmao that intro gives back memories
---
If it is a dude... not my worse fap...
---
Is it Ranked?
---
Montagne is a trans man (and is therefore goals)
---
Bring back mr bear you meanies
---
I‚Äôm saying himself in person skydiving while getting rappel kills in game.
---
What's wrong
---
It said full game access. I was guessing that meant starter ops plus the y1. My bad I guess.
---
Teams are very unbalanced
---
okay
---
They said on their blog that something is gonna happen next season with it. Some people think theyll prohibit queuing with someone too far below your rank while others think theyll do what you said and matchmake the highest mmr
---
Yes
---
Tink... BOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!
---
see u in hot 
---
üòâ
---
jokes on you, my surf is actually higher ranked than my main
---
Give them rook armor
---
I can only imagine Mira running while holding a Black Mirror.
---
I was gold 2 but fell to bronze 4 (just a streal of bad games and my own insanity expecting better games). I'll have good games people call me smurfing or bad games and people saying I need to be copper. You can't win with logic in ranked and I usually just mute people who are toxic as they're not providing any useful info most of the time
---
The first sentence says I've been playing for a week. Also my friends aren't high enough level yet to queue with unfortunately.
---
The racer skins sucked, cmv
---
Now two random people joined my game and made us surrender
---
Me, Im worse
---
Getting kicked from 20% of my games means nothing more than 20% of my games are with a toxic 4 man team. Are you really this dense?
---
Also thanks for the downvotes bro, really showed me
---
Honestly it'd be a lot more palatable if he did it from like "Gold IV to Diamond." No shit he's gonna be able to make it through Copper, but how many games does he ruin in as he does?
---
Just delete all you say. no replies.
---
We play on middle europe. And everebody in game has ultra lags ... not just me. In attack we can manage go to objective ... lags push as back ... in two round in line in ranked. And before 14 days the same problem ...
---
Stop Lesion abuse
---
And I forgot to mention, I think it will be a while for a response from pro league. They have some strats for it but because it's so new there are a lost of different tactics to use, especially with the addition of new ops like warden and supposedly the next one that climbs hatches.
---
it's not even just ranked, a buddy of mine got siege recently, and we played newcomer since I still had a handful of games til lvl 50, the number of spawn peekers that were under lvl 10 was legendary
---
Can frost's super 90 black ice still be bought?
---
make sure your uplay/steam/game is all on your ssd
---
Damn I could understand this happening around 3am to 6am but at 9:30pm that's ridiculous
---
SSD is the only drive I have installed.
---
Is it somebody else loading into the match? They should have an hourglass symbol at the top of the screen.
---
Title is correct.
---
You were team killed
---
You were vote kicked
---
You have arrived at Siege, enjoy your stay.
---
So that's how you feel about Tachanka :P
---
Nah it was my friend he sent it to me via snap
---
This is why Maestro is one of my favorite operators to play.
---
Maestro, he‚Äôs more fun
---
Its already been nerfed and it can‚Äôt hit anything at all and it is complete garbage now.

I'm sure you purposely didn't include why you're leaving in your text post so I'll be the one to ask; why?

Well it‚Äôs not supposed to be a laser, it was way to op before, like you have a shield in front of you you already have enough of an advantage

Before you go, should i buy Zof√≠a or N√∏kk? Help a noob at least one more time

A third Lesion main?

If it's a dude it has to be a very young one. Because those don't sound like a 20 year old mans breathing.
---
Double kill?
---
It wasn‚Äôt a laser or op to begin with and only was able to consistently hit shots really close up and then they ruined it
---
Yea, this game had a different community back in close beta and launch. Much nicer. A lot nicer. It was full of remarkably nice people. Dad.
---
Attack: Ash. Very good gun and easy to use. Has breaching charge that fires a grenades which will stick to wooden surfaces and blow holes in them.
---
Defense: Rook. Has a very good gun with an ACOG and a simple ability. Just drop your armor pack the second you spawn in, grab an armor plate then go do your thing.
---
When I was a noob I got like 3 ices. Didn't mean shit to me, still doesn't.

I love the Good Edition. Definitely getting your moneys worth. 10/10 good game
---
Can Clash deflect the emerald splash is the real question
---
Vigil is pretty good for run outs just in general because 3 speed, impacts and his guns do pretty decent at range.
---
1st of all, it‚Äôs not just in the Middle East, it‚Äôs everywhere bud and 2nd of all, the game is loading in the map and everything that will be used in the game because it‚Äôs the start.
---
Still lame. It doesn‚Äôt make it a win or lose situation. Especially in casual
---
He is kneeling ... That is FAR from a real Slav squad.
---
Can you not be the grammar police hell can a person write in peace
---
Yeah I got killed by a teammate for trying to tell someone to pickup the defuser. Next round I got killed by his friend without any hostility from me. Ended up reporting both of them and then reporting their position to the enemy team the entire round.
---
Okay but it was 120ms before update why now 180 ms ?
---
Real question is: why are you using red dot on thermiteüò≠üò≠
---
Ok, but I just LOVE the fact that the Rainbow is Magic Blackbeard looks like he was playing Princess Tea Time with his daughter, and in the middle of the roleplay, received an urgent message to go kill some terrorists and left as is.

More stuff to load in? Might just be a temporary thing that ubi will have an explanation for if so. Otherwise I‚Äôm not sure.

We call her the Full Monty for a reason.

Bro this guy is the kind of person to guess every answer on who wants to be a millionaire and wins
---
After situations, get her head on into new comer. Tell her it will be rough, but hype her up when she wins/gets a kill. It helped me stay in the game!
---
Also, for defender picks, Rook and Doc are easy to learn and great picks, whereas Ash and Sledge are the same. Try those four! Hope I helped a bit!
---
You‚Äôll get all the perks of gold edition and you won‚Äôt have to insert the disc because you‚Äôll own it digitally

I don‚Äôt think so ubi will do any thing but we‚Äôll see
---
So you saying cav should be nerfed that way aswell?
---
Indeed, they do address issues once every while though.
---
It makes you seem like damn moron but enjoy...
---
I‚Äôm never active in Insta because of that. It‚Äôs filled with entitled teenagers who takes things for their own Followers and Likes gain. 
---
I helped taking down over 20 (should be nearing 30 now but lost count) Insta reposters who think they have some sort of an entitlement to take things and suddenly own them.
---
I take too much joy in watching them say things like ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do anything to me!‚Äù Then I laugh my ass off as I watch their posts gets removed couple of times before being fully suspended or deleted.
---
If you find someone take your stuff, don‚Äôt ask nicely. Reposters don‚Äôt give shit about the original creators. They are using someone else‚Äôs work for their gain. 
---
A Siege artists gave up on drawing Siege meme art because of rampant reposters and one reposted called TB Choi (known for Dokk and Vigil series who now work for Ubi) a bitch for asking for proper credit. I made it personal by contacting 20 other artists whose works were reposted and they happily filed copyright infringement. 
---
Last year there was an account that reposted thousands of Overwatch fanarts and added his own PayPal or something so ‚Äúppl can pay him to post more arts‚Äù. Couldn‚Äôt believe that person had like a million follower or something and nobody contacted the artist. Talked to 17 artists on that one and took about a day for that account to disappear.

You know how hard it is to have those 4 operators unbanned in higher levels
---
What we are considered powerful now get the magical uwu cheif on the phone stat!!!
---
Happens more than I care to admit. Where I click to lean before the trigger was past the "aim" threshold, so it just knifes instead
---
I see your point. I‚Äôll cut this short why i disagree. Short pings, that‚Äôs lion‚Äôs rework. Anyone can be a selfish operator. Believe me, anyone can. That‚Äôs based on the player using the operator, not itself. I think the pings to jackal himself could make him play his role more as flushing out roamers. just less... aggravating.
---
How good or bad is new comer? I'm level 270 so I've never played it and I keep hearing about smurfs.
---
Doc is a good idea but I plan to play doc with her so I can keep her alive. Lol. Ash on the other hand... I'm worried about the 3 speed. Maybe once she figures out her DPI settings.
---
Thanks

There is any way to contact him?

Damn he even got them new gamer socks

Sorry you don‚Äôt look like a really big fucking hole.

Are you actually a valk main

chargutv is your friend?

Can I just say that barmaid was the best part of Shrek 2.
---
Yeah, this is enough reddit for one day..
---
Nah I‚Äôve used him not too long ago but I definitely played more sledge before so it might be a warped perception I have now.
---
Blackbeard trying to shoot through the drone hole
---
She‚Äôs good operator for it cause she can just put down her reinforcements and Mira‚Äôs then leave obj. She also has really good weapons for roaming
---
This one time our group's smoke in the furry gear was crouchwalking around, and he walked up to me and said into his mic, "uwu whats this"
---
I said to him that if he says that uwu shit one more fuckin time I'mma shoot him.
---
Thirty seconds later, when my back was turned, he walked up to one of the pubbie teammates whose usernamed had 'wick' in it and said "uwu notices ur thicky wicky" and without even a second of hesitation I turned around and one tapped him.
---
No regrets.
---
I'll be honest, my friends and I mostly do terrorist hunt, but yeah.
---
I never met anyone other than me who mains valk
---
Love the mpx and cams are always useful (provided they're placed well lol)
---
Well, try the flash hider out, maybe you‚Äôll like it better, it also help with the spread a tiny bit in addition to the recoil recovery.
---
Yea everyone hates the mpx but I love it and I love the cams
---
ARX as well, since they're basically the MP7 irons.
---
No. Each account is separate - because in their mind "Why would you need more than 1?" and smurfs and the like are most likely not an accepted reason.
---
You use to be able to see stats in game, definitely could during Dust Line, forget when they hid them on the scoreboard
---
I will admit I played carefully and methodical which can be seen as slow but I tried to play it as well as possible. As soon as my last teammate died, I ran into the area they were getting shot from and saw no one so yeah. I understand that sometimes you need to risk a loss if you have the chance to clutch, but I can't control not having any idea where the enemies will be.
---
yeah, fair enough ig
---
Also MnK, cursed video basically.
---
Now im just wondering why the guy is saying "Is this allowed?" in the original video
---
Flair test
---
I wo ld want this but with singular weapons.
---
Smoke elite...
---
You mean shitbox?
---
Am I the only one that bought black ice skins with renown is S1
---
Inb4 someone calls you toxic even though they agreed to it
---
It could swap either primary or secondary depending on what you‚Äôre holding at the time, yes, I like it.
---
It's sad that things have devolved so much. 
---
As glad as I am that siege's popularity is what keeps content flowing, at the same time I'd trade that popularity in an instant to go back to the black ice days of the community. 
---
No amount of policing the community will change the game. If there's one thing the past few weeks have made me realize, it's that siege isn't fun anymore. Whether it's the constant mid game leaving or the pub stomping diamonds in casual to the toxic teammates, it's all gone to hell, and it's too late to do a damn thing about it. 
---
If it weren't for a select few friends of mine who still play on occasion, I probably would have uninstalled.
---
Yeah...
---
Yeah but I used to be able to handle the gun in long bursts, they took that away so it just flopped for me.
---
Yeah great idea but make it so it can only be swapped with spotted enemy's
---
It's rather dull, isn't it?
---
not a good tip
---
I like the idea of adding more people who punish your team for you dying like with cav. I feel like we need one on attack first tho before we add a second on defense. Good idea though.
---
its plastered everywhere because people like it. I personally like less colourful skins.
---
not remotely dying
---
After you see screen of people not getting diamond because they land on the perfect elo I think this is actually helpful.
---
I don't really see how they can class it as ping abuse, if you play with your friends on American or Asian servers etc.
---
I'm on the weu server but still come up against lower ping players in the states than are on my own servers
---
I had this in mind, and I felt like defenders need more strong operators that bring risk, because defence in itself is an advantage.
---
Obviously it‚Äôs still popular but the game is broke, it‚Äôs even more messed up on PC I believe, it has so many flaws and issues
---
All the fucking time
---
I'm about he same level as the dude in the video and have around 800 hours but still dont have a single black ice
---
Thats the same way I play
---
#
---
Other positiv effects: 
---
-you get calls (its pretty rare to get calls from random players in gold at weu)
---
-you dont play this game too much so youre always happy to play / not bored -&gt; less / no tilting
---
Overwatch: First Time?
---
not really no
---
You may have just hit a block maybe a take a break for sometime, and come back to it and try and stay chill
---
Why dont ubi just remove tk from causal cos its so fucking annoying and there's no actual reason for it to be there
---
I only have pistol black ices
---
Same used to be a big fan am diamond a few seasons almost always plat then just started to hate the fucking game and realise how shit it is and i know it doesnt really matter for casual players and whenever i wanna play casual i dont care but when trying to play competitive and always dying from absolute fucking bullshit 24/7 is just not fun anymore so long story short i deleted it and dont regret it
---
What are you trying to say then? PC has a lot of hackers I believe
---
Exactly, I always have a blast with friends, and also calls, plus you can cut out any toxicity
---
Lmao
---
some yeah, like every fps ever made
---
Pretty good one
---
I was getting scared for a second
---
I might uninstall aswell tbh
---
Nice idea in some situation while light is blocking your view, but the it's useless and terrible, as a defender you could turn every light off and camp an angle, as an attacker you'd never shot to a lamp while peeking instead of the enemy.
---
Im not following you here?
---
Yea just have fun play cas for a few days go back
---
I think you should learn what a hoverboard is.
---
Hope you mean the "Hoverboard" from back in the future not the one they sell us as so called Hoverboards today.
---
You do realise that I'm not the dumb fuck here right? Movement isn't server-side. If you seriously can't see the joke I was making, you really do have no knowledge of client side and server side roles.
---
Love the slight Hellboy 2 reference in this.
---
Nice I have glazs black ice and iq and smg 11
---
No need to be resilient to my opinion, this game is really popular it has issues that really bring the game down, yes other games have hackers but this game in particular needs way less of that happening, there will always be hackers but they need a better anti cheat system
---
I think that goes for every operator
---
Oops sorry, just used the quick capture on xbox ans didn‚Äôt realize it cut off;  but you don‚Äôt see anything helpful anyway.
---
Eh yeah but that does take fro the core of the game. The core being a tactical shooter which needs longer matches for said tactical-ness
---
&gt;Then you should have planned ahead and not let them plant.
---
It's not about the fact that they planted. Retakes for defuse is a normal part of competitive bomb-play.
---
1v1, 1v2, .. against non-shield ops are most of the time not impossible to win.
---
1v1, 1v2, ... against a monty and his teammates -&gt; ez loss
---
The problem is the, lets call it unbalanced, environment this operator with his current design produces.
---
You simply can not kill a skilled monty player without special gadgets, if you manage to do so he made some big mistakes.
---
this would make it even worse
---
Idk man. I'm not one of the devs. All I know is that the exact same idea gets posted every once in a while.
---
üòÇ
---
So it's not rare, what's the fuss about then?
---
glaz, warden, occasionally castle

---
That's where ranked comes into play. The pointless mode should be about getting into gunfights faster, and not sitting around for 3.5 mins whilst someone drones the whole building, and a 20+ min snoozefest.
---
Ok thats why people always talk about how the game came back from the brink of death because Ubi worked on it continuously and the pro scene helped revitalize the game
---
It can't get worse.
---
I can imagine every Rainbow Six player pretending to shoot them out.
---
I understand if you are frustrated and dont feel playing Siege. I would say its even normal from time to time. However, compared to other games, both in current state and/or toxicity. It's not that bad. I tend to try out games that I find interesting, be that a free weekend or a big sale, so I have a little bit of context and really, Siege is not that bad. For example, BF5 has invisible soldiers for a month now. You can watch a video about a recent CS:GO tournament where during a live event the game didn't register a headshot, and this occured multiple times during that event. I'm not saying Siege is much better, i'm saying, Siege is not that bad actually.
---
They even proposed a solution for the ranked problem. Starting next season they will restrict ranks/levels somehow, so there will be no 5 silver against 3 plat/diamond and 2 silver. Or something like that, you can read upon that.
---
i'm sorry but it really bothers me that you didn't hold any angles
---
Um. No.
---
To start, that's too unfair for Defenders. Already some of them aren't done preparing when the action phase initiates, cutting that by more than half is ridiculous. 
---
A shorter round? I think the round is short enough. Sometimes you can rush a round, sometimes you need to drag it out. 
---
Casual isn't about being quick, it's supposed to be about being laid back, something to do when you don't want to get worked up, something for practice even.
---
If you want something quick like Showdown, then ask for it separately, don't take Casual down with you.
---
Place prismas right after prep phase, so no one knows where they are
---
I... Shit I can't say nothing, im stupid as hell
---
Sods law as soon as you peek with a grenade you get headshot

Hello Spacegorilla43, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ci1k4x/_/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What's the quickest/easiest way to see the skins I own?
---
Hahaha. Nice. I would have been the defender who had you in sights right before you turned that corner just to get shit on and lose the game. Love the game, not my luck
---
Kobe
---
Your not wrong that happens to often. üòì
---
ACOG
---
But that's part of the game. Its not a 'rush in guns blazing and blaring,' it's tactical. Gather Intel to figure out your course of action and execute it. Sometimes patience helps.
---
So basically [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYuobZLr7M)
---
there would be no fair way to balance this, this would be unbelievably broken. imagine a Cav with an F2, that would be so overpowered
---
defenders have worse guns for a reason, they have an advantage on most maps and sites because they can anchor and camp objectives while being relatively safe
---
No one should ever be dragging a casual round out. You can easily do basic prep in 10 seconds + the time for the attacker to get to the building. Sitting around for 3:30 whilst someone drones everywhere then starts roof breaching is why everyone leaves.
---
The only digital content bundle I got was the Year 1 pro league set for all the OG operators which is essentially black ice with a golden six slapped onto it. Seeing the black ice circle jerk makes me so glad that was the one I snagged while it lasted in May 2016

This vid made me hard keep it up

No I just mean that the frame rate is extremely low

that doesn't work on console lol
---
Fattest fuze potential

Ah fair enough. The only Siege YouTuber I‚Äôve ever watched is BikiniBohdi and I don‚Äôt mind his style of videos. I‚Äôm not so much into the over edited ADHD hyper random videos like OP. That stuff wasn‚Äôt even funny in 2009 at it‚Äôs peak haha.
---
I had a match where i was 24-2-4 and we lost 5:4, i was incredibly upset, but that doesn't give me the right to shout at them or let my anger out on them. My mates hat collectively 6 kills, but you can't simply argument that "I have kills, I good". 
---
If you do nothing the first half of every round, let your team die and then farm 2 impatient players that push you and then die yourself, you are at fault. Many players that play like this and complain about their team don't even notice that they didn't do shit to progress the round.
---
The best time to delete this post was before you posted it but the second best time is now

If you like meme-y but actually good videos you should watch basicallyhomeless. He makes really good videos. Watch his latest one he plays siege on a .94 inch monitor and the worlds smallest set up

too bad I have to wait until the area 51 raid before I can delete other people's posts
---
&gt;Basically what your saying is YOUR IDEA IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD correct me if im wrong but you are 100% right
---
The first "your" should be "you're" or "you are". Learn to read before trashing others for caring about something.

By the way, you are lackinf two of these "." for "propper formatting".

Yeah I‚Äôll check it out! Cheers mate!

Hibana was the first OP I ever played with. I did this in my first game and was lucky enough to have a nice guy smurfing around in newcomer ever so nicely tell me I was retarded and start to rage

If you get killed by somebody throwing an object (Valk cams, Alibi‚Äôs prisma, flashbangs, smoke grenades etc..) your only option is to uninstall R6. That shit is too embarrassing to live with

Smoke has a face model?

Because you can see parts of their faces, and they have helmet variants that reveal their face, and N√∏kk doesn't
---
Yeah, especially for the ones like op gadget as charms for the new years, they stopped at the Valkyrie's cam, the only one that I got back in the days.
---
That can be a sticky situation that is frustrating yes and I am sorry for the impolite attitude toward you but I thought you were being serious because of how anti-clash this subreddit is.
---
I got diamond on PS4 legit with a controller. If you aren‚Äôt able to get it without boosting then you probably don‚Äôt deserve it
---
surely harder than miecraft lmao
---
Friends clip, didn't realize how old it is.
---
Cuz they were probably running low on time when they finished with warden so they just decided to make a Jaeger Corp character.
---
You really want to spend your valuable energy explaining that?

You go potato man!

It's pointless.

Overwatch and TF2 are nothing like rainbow but I loved overwatch and I loved tf2 and rainbow is now my favorite game I‚Äôve ever played so I‚Äôd recommend it
---
I hit diamond last six season legit got up to 5500 elo I want my thanos charm hence but this season is fucked on ps4. So fuck off if you say I dont deserve it I've had 1.7kd for a long time you probably have 0.8 and use smurfs as well don't chat shit
---
Standard Edition, yes

***lets just say shit gets complicated with the other editions***

"map idea" - this is literally 4:3 picture of bootleg minecraft map, we can't see any room, any plan of builing. This is literally picture of ranom thing an have nothing in common with R6

Suppressors are good on attack
---
On Cav? I think I see a lot of Cav players use Supressors
---
Vigil has great smg - K1A and meme material double-barrel. His gadget sucks tho.
---
Lesion's gadget is a pretty useful rush-stopping and information providing tool. His smg is not bad too.

I'd like to be able to do it by my self so I can any time extract some models but I have already tried a couple times and I am not able to still open it :/
---
The video visually is really good but I think it would benefit if you introduced game sound as well as more varying sound like maybe a headshot sound whenever you headshot someone. If you don‚Äôt mind what program do you use?
---
No and k/d is irrelevant too.
---
There was a soft reset this season.
---
Well thanks for making ubisoft take a heads up for it
---
Exactly, thank you. Its kinda hard to explain but yeah with deadzones and everything its really easy to pick out the MnK players
---
imma be straight with you. i saw this on my dashboard and for some reason was under the impression it was going to auto play, and sat for about three minutes wondering when the fuck something was going to happen.
---
r/DumbAssPeople
---
I thought at first "why does that frost have a beard"
---
On the pistol? You don't have a choice.
---
On the gun? Their choice because they think they can "be sneaky", but it is hella pointless considering that the gun shots literal paper. And besides, most use the shotgun anyway.

Or play ash... Or zofia... Or jackal... Or buck...  Or someone with a primary LMG like Fuze. That is, instead of playing sledge every round and wondering why you can't safely breach the Coastline bathroom
---
How u do that? It's amazing
---
Try the tutorial, or you can hit me up anytime
---
Not really a soft reset when i am 4 ranks lower than i have always been, and K/D is just a measurement of me rolling the lower ranks. Mind telling me how progression works? how many games until i can hit diamond again?
---
No. Too much toxic kids below 13 years destroying the game
---
Lesion is bae
---
I posted a similar thing around the same time last night, got the same responses from the community.
---
‚ÄúTake a break‚Äù. How does that solve an issue that is only getting worse?
---
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know they are using it‚Äù. Yes I fucking do. People will straight up TELL you they are using M&amp;K, they don‚Äôt give a fuck.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not technically against the rules‚Äù. Yes it is.
---
If better aim/rank were behind a paywall within the game-store, people would be losing their minds on the subreddit and doing the same shit they did for BFII. But since it‚Äôs a console problem hurting only plat and above, nobody seems to actually understand the problem except those affected.
---
If you think gold/plat is bad, try plat 1-diamond. At this point it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúis anyone using M&amp;K?‚Äù It‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù
---
If it is real, it would make a lot of sense. But if it‚Äôs fake, whoever made it would‚Äôve done a lot of research. The new Peruvian operator coming to Y4S3 would most likely be attack, and it would maybe be based off of one of their previous operations. One of Peru‚Äôs most famous operations were the extraction of about 60 hostages in Japan. They blasted music and they dug/mined underground to get to the hostages and they ran in their, killing all the terrorists and extracted the hostages through the hatch on the roof. (maybe a link to the hatch climbing operator thing?)
---
go back to school clash. Go learn something in that classroom
---
Well if you‚Äôve gotten it legit the past 6 seasons which I highly doubt, then you should be plenty capable to get it this season. And I have a 1.6 K/D overall and a 1.8 K/D this season on my main, tough guy.
---
The disrespect lmao
---
I used to main people (as you can see by my flair) but now I just fill the roles we need.
---
It's summer time . So she is swimming
---
i work on programming on the side and all i can say is making a small icon change for a event is alot easier than fixing a bug especially a big game breaking one. ethier way this is not gonna happen sadly but even if they did do it another team eg the art would manage it not the bug fixers
---
Yeah i get where youre coming from and i think that if the shield either did no damage or didnt  slow you down it would be much more balanced
---
As a Mira main, my pressure canisters have just burst from confusion.
---
Real talk though, I‚Äôve been sniped by the Six-12 SD through Second floor red stair window of Kafe
---
&gt;and only lost on the new maps.
---
.
---
&gt;kinda weird to get placed so low,
---
There is not decay, Kd doesnt matter for MMR only the if you win or lose the match matters for the MMR. 
---
There is a reset end of every season, Starting last season the reset is now a soft reset so you'll start off from the middle mmr score between 2500 and your last mmr score.
---
&gt; Not really a soft reset
---
By definition it was a soft reset.

Yup

Zero recoil anyway, so angled.

That's a personal preference. If you have pull down issues, vertical.
---
Did you shoot him?
---
Right, but try clutching against clash. If clash player knows the map and has space to back out to, ur fucked. If she has one or two guys with her, immposible to clutch. U are around 50hp? Shes gonna fry ur ass before u reach her=ur fucked. And about pick and win ratio. Same goes for jackal, least picked and least win ratio, yet most banned. Why is that u think? Coz hes super annoying to play against and in certain (awfully lot reoccurring) situations he's unbeatable. Same like clash. If I'm supposed to clutch against her as an op without frags or claymore and hp lower than 100 I rather give up than to be fried like a fish...

Deja Vu - Initial D
---
Lmfao their is no rule against it other than you don‚Äôt like it.
---
If you were still as good as you used to be you‚Äôd have been placed in Gold 1 or Low Plat.
---
Is it like overwatch where the next few games are critical aswell, so i will get extra mmr for winning and lose more for losing etc?
---
I completely agree with that but if that were to be the case than just a little faster shied swap time or maybe a gun buff could balance that out considering the already is kind of a bad operator
---
Yessir indeed.
---
He‚Äôs so bad
---
My luckiest c4 ever was on border, some wall didn‚Äôt get reinforced and it was a min in the round I was so upset like the lil bitch I am that I threw the c4 at the wall to make a hole for the enemy and killed someone doing a breach charge I assume.
---
grey face no space
---
Casual still has a hidden mmr stat and a smurf can easily play on the lower mmr casual to wreck havoc.
---
It even has the same problem as ranked of a copper playing with plats, everytime I play with a certain friend on casul I get both teams being very low levels and when I play with another different friend is the way around and I get matched against constant high level players, usually plats.
---
Means you can actually see what you're shooting at now
---
iq pistol only.
---
U are the enemie of the people
---
MaTh BaD
---
I love breach charge kills
---
Good luck with that.
---
I had the same idea, but the controls r horrific. Siege just has tooany buttons to press for a phone
---
I love doc.
---
In my biased opinion you should buy it, although you should know that the game is a lot slower than other fps games and the time to kill is much faster than tf2 and overwatch. You'd definitely like the character based gameplay if you like those games, but you also should be fine with the quick encounters. Hope this helps!

FACE = REDACTED
---
And the stocks don't work like a mobile game, to the right of the circle and you turn right
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse, clash the character, or people who actually play clash
---
You know that clash doesn‚Äôt have infinite shocking capabilities right? 5 dps with a recharge time of 2 seconds and a .5 speed recovery after being shocked giving you enough time to rush clash melee-ing her sheild, making her easier to kill. Thatch makes her muda muda. Zofia‚Äôs concussions/impact make her easy to kill. Lion keeps her anchored in place making her easy to kill. Capitaos bolts render her useless. Ash is really good at rushing her. Frags kill her ez pz. Flash banging her is easy too and makes her much easier to kill. Claymore baits are harder but still work. If you‚Äôre not in an open space you can run around, confuse her and kill her that way. With teammates she‚Äôs really good but you also have teammates. She‚Äôs annoying to play against but you‚Äôre describing her as the best op in the game and how it‚Äôs absolutely impossible to kill her.
---
Can confirm
---
Nokk is killer bean?????
---
Dokiiiiii
---
Find something smurfs share that few (preferably none, but that's unlikely) other players do and segregate them into their own lobby.

That's about the only way I can see of making a dent in the smurf population.

I think pistols are in a much better state than they were before the update. You can actually see what your shooting.
---
Then I saw her face...
---
Lots of people suggested that, I‚Äôd say keep Mpx but give him the third option with p90. Also for me what ever you do to glaz should go to warden so he gets increase turn angles to 120 like glaz let him move more
---
excuse me what
---
Unless there are any mobile gamers out there
---
Ok, so quick story about this subject. 
---
My friends and I were playing a ranked game. My friends usually score lower in the ranks at the beginning of each season, normally they get either bronze or silver. I usually get into the high gold, so we sometimes get mixed in with some decent and really good players. Which we never minded, it was pretty fair most games. 
---
So we team together and our first few games go as normal, we win some, we loss some. We just have a good time because we enjoy the challenge. We get matched with this player who is bronze one. Now during the game he has his controller set up to where he can lean side to side super fast. It was a pain in the ass going against this guy especially since he roamed a lot. 
---
Now despite his cheap tactics and his constant spawn peeking we ended up beating him and his team. Guy ends up sending a request to me and my friends to join a party. We already had a party made so we sent him a request. Obviously we knew this wants gonna go well but we decided to see what he had to say and mess with him if he decided to be toxic. No suprise the moment he joined he started talking all kinds of shit. He said we were garbage despite us beating his team. He blamed his team for sucking and said if he was with his main team he'd beat our asses. We asked him if he was so good why was he bronze one. He got even more pissed off and said it was his main smurf account(which was obvious, he was like lvl 50) and that he was a plat on his main account. We ended up just laughing at him till he left. It was so messed up though how toxic he was. Since he had a mic i couldnt imagine what kind of toxic vile crap he was saying to the guys we was playing with. 
---
These kind of people can ruin the game for the new players. I cant even imagine how many smurfs use the special casual for players below level 50. If you smurf and "show off" to new players how good you are by stomping on them at a low level, you're a big problem with the growth of the community. Because it cant grown if all our new players feel like it'd be impossible to play and win.
---
Eurobeat strats &gt; all other strats
---
I cant remember what program but the reason it has no game sound is because I forgot to mute my mic while getting clips
---
Go home bot your drunk
---
if your talking about the water mark i used a free online editer software since i'm poor
---
Because of Mira
---
I don't know how to buff him besides giving him a better gun, I have a question though, why does everyone think the p90 is a good choice?  It's not even a good gun, the only reason it would be appealing for Warden is because it has an ACOG
---
Everyone says that but I feel like I cant see aswell. They also dont feel as smooth.
---
R√•tgr√•t med gr√•te
---
shots fired don‚Äòt add up anymore since op white noise
---
Maybe keep the center of the screen clear; don't get me wrong, I love dank memes as much as the next guy, I would just like to see where you're shooting. Overall though, a great video, keep up the great work.

Does anyone else see a [BMX helmet](https://cdn10.bigcommerce.com/s-6w6qcuo4/products/6394/images/11086/Bell.Local.Helmet.black__92453.1494083715.1280.1280.jpg?c=2) when they look at her operator photo? I can't unsee it.
---
You guys are saying this like Ubisoft uses their resources usefully, I think I might be getting r/whoooosh 'd
---
You sound super insecure
---
Im not a new player i just never even thought about using Echo before ive only used him 12 times by now you can search up my r6 stats (im not good with him obv) my xbox gamertag is ColeSlaw Lamma4
---
Can you do that with vigil?
---
Just got the game a month ago. I can say from experience getting all operators costs about US$100. So yes half off so it doesn't take so much grinding of renown.
---
The last sentence makes me so happy just reading it. 
---
I‚Äôd love for her to have a suppressed weapon just for herself.
---
Cobra Commander?
---
You get the ops from that year
---
How dare you insult the P90
---
Im not lazy i just never wanted to use echo before ive had him for almost a year i just didnt want to play him
---
He probably is if he has to bring up kd
---
Yes i can
---
No you dont
---
Tag NSFW please/s
---
Unless it‚Äôs a lot louder than the gameplay imo a mic can add a lot of personality to the clips and help differentiate itself from others like it. The reason I asked for the programs is I started using resolve for my edits and I‚Äôm still trying to learn how to get visual effects like yours
---
Tbh thats still not enough. Diamonds really should not be able to queue with anyone below mid-gold imo, and even THATS a stretch.
---
Theres no chance in hell that THIS is the season you cant get diamond in. Nokk and Warden did absolutely nothing to the meta and plenty of other seasons had massive implications with their operators.
---
I smell boosted, and I smell cheater.
---
Fuck they are smart
---
And Im a beliver
---
Also all the other operators with covered faces other than Vigil I think have head skins that reveal their face models
---
!#ItDoesntExist!
---
He has a custom one right? Also does his DMR has a suppressor?
---
It‚Äôs got a super steep learning curve, it‚Äôs full of selfish, sweaty and toxic players, but holy shit is it fun. Get it.
---
thats 1 round out of 100s, if there was more than 200 rounds played in EU PL on 7 playdays and only 1 round of ying then it would be 0% as it is.
---
Looks kinda like a turkey with a bycicle helmet on tbh
---
Haha if you only knew.  People love trolling copper and bronze. Fucking diamonds wanting to shit on people who truly belong at that level. Honestly bronze and silver is the hardest to get out of. Good luck
---
‚ÄúWhy the long face?‚Äù

What a way to get an ace, just cut his toenails off! Good job though

How do I upvote multiple times?
---
Really? Even though every other game works fine?
---
Does the pass on console grant more ops?
---
Yo can you try with tachanka?
---
Rottaraastin
---
I very much agree so I tend to not to use it to often but sometimes if ur in casual and doing stupid stuff like me and my friends try to hide outside of the map it‚Äôs my go to.
---
Aight. So let me break this down. As I was mainly talkin about clutching against her right. Which means its ussually later stage of round which means, emps have been used to help breach shit, cap arrows are usseles coz its just u and she wont let one guy corner her as im sure u know. Same goes for frags - prolly used already, or she does her turtle spin. I agree with ash as a counter, but lion? Srsly man? Never have I seen clash stopped moving just coz of him. All she needs to do is stand on solid ground so she won't get fcked from bellow. Thats like saying clash is never seen outside of building coz it gives away her position - eg like she gives a fck. Thing with that recovery is her reach. Which renders ur recovery bit usseles, coz all she needs to do is, zap, back away, recharge, repeat. If it doesn't kill u, it will cost u time and she wins anyway. Not to mention she's walkin shielded camera and gold mine for info...
---
Nomad is only 100% counter on clash.
---
I know of course its either that or... we're just talking about this drone.. from today.   Ya know... memes
---
Clash is the father.
---
Me, every single game. I don‚Äôt want to worry about a Shock Drone coming in and taking out Black Mirrors, Gu Mines, Evil Eyes, Batteries, EDDs, and Black Eyes. (For reference I do play console at a rank of Gold 3-2)
---
No, I was commenting on the 35 hours part.  Passive renown farming is impossible overnight.  Should have specified. my bad.
---
&gt;has AR Mags
---
&gt;doesn't have an AR
---
Yeah sorry, I was not in a good mood when I replied, I saw the watermark and that it is about an event 1 weeks.go and assumed it was a repost, sorry for taking out my anger on you
---
Right?
---
Exactly !!! 
---
Also valk has 2 radios and frost has duke mags etc
---
Well you did lol
---
That's working as intended . Nothing wrong
---
Nope smoke is actually a B teir and a very underated op nobody plays him that much because of it and ive been playing gridlock for months and only now are people finally starting to play her
---
Well let's focus on buffing the shit out of him first
---
I‚Äôm just pissed
---
Oh, I was just posting how long it took me with a casual 2 to 3 hours a night. Although I suppose if you grind thunt you might get renown faster than having to que for MP.
---
So firstly they should have heard you defusing. Secondly, you were being spotted whilst defusing and nobody called it out. Not your fault of course so good job on the ninja defuse. (I know console is a little harder if you don't have a headset or mic)
---
Valk is soo lonely she talks to herself and watches herself with her black eyes. :(
---
Very nice team names xD
---
Well don‚Äôt be

Thatcher only disables some electronics that Twitch can destroy. Twitch also has the ability to take out gadgets in prep. On top of that she can pop mirrors l
---
Basically you were in a game with someone cheating so ubi rolled back whatevee was earnt/lost because of how unfair those games were if I'm reading it right
---
How bad were they before?  I barely have the motivation to grind out another 25k for Mozzie.
---
Happened to me due to those chat glitches, silver 1 down to silver 3
---
Somehow a headshot, but good job bringing the game back and winning!
---
That turned out so well
---
I allready done it. I‚Äôll post it tommorow üòä
---
They way she got thrown like a puppet to the side just made me super happy.
---
The only thing I can of us to call ubisoft support
---
That was like back in halo when master chief took off his helment and had another helment underneath
---
I think one of two things need to happen to his gadget.  It either needs to something every teammate can pick up (like Rook armor) or it needs to be always on.  With how underwhelming he has been, I'm not sure either of those changes is enough, but I'd rather take incremental steps than make him OP and have to dial it back.
---
Warden should probably have access to some sort of magnified scope.
---
All the DLC ops were costing 25K . It was a massive grind
---
Tower t hunt on normal protecting the hostage in kitchen is the easiest way to farm renown.  That was a mess of a sentence but it‚Äôs the easiest way since you‚Äôd get about 60 renown a game (with the booster) in less time than you‚Äôd get 500 from a casual win with the booster.  It‚Äôs just mind numbingly boring to do.
---
That‚Äôs what your soft breacher is for
---
Anyway that's just my opinion, I don't play shields whatsoever coz I find them way too op and too "simple" to play (all of them, even tho I find clash still the worst of them  all). But then again thats just my point of view which is silver/gold/platin, depending on season and frankly I mainly play casul and mainly for fun now, so maybe it's just me finding her&amp;shields buddies really unfun.
---
not that it matters but i think it's his classes that need a buff not his ability. weak mpx, smg not great at long range, shotty is ok for close quarters but why pick him over doc or rook when they have acogs? even if u want a shotty you can still pick doc or rook
---
üòÇüòÖ
---
*Master Chief intensifies*
---
I think it should be like cav  like when she cancels her gadget
---
Destroying stuff in prep phase is no different than destroying stuff at the beginning of the round
---
I see that she had been circumcised
---
You might have missed the first shot cant tell, but the second one definitely should have at least downed her.
---
But RFF applys to destroying team gadgets with it active so it‚Äôs fair to assume that
---
Catch that son a gun

That was nasty my dude

---
It's some offbrand thing  adlink 512gb ssd.
---
I've got a new SSD and I'm hoping it will fix the problem (Samsung 970 EVO).
---
The issue, again, is the it's the only trap that actually immobilizes you and takes away your control. Taking a down is at least a permanent action that teammates come and help with and blah blah blah but nomads Airjab takes away any chance of fighting back, which no other trap does
---
If only Clayton Bigsby kept his face hidden...
---
The 970 Evo is fast.  A lot of the cheaper ssd's have weird read and write speeds for different file sizes.  Hopefully the 970 Evo does it!  Please check back and update!

I was a console gamer for a long time recently switched to pc, worth the investment in game quality of your the type to have hundreds of hours in a game.
---
Ninja ripper. And thank you
---
What other operators can you buy?
---
Well... you did miss
---
wait you arent supposed to do this
---
Every single other one besides moxie and gridlock
---
Nokk is really fun. She very hit or miss when she comes to team value, but being a sneaky attacker is great.
---
Alibi is also a great choice, very underrated roamer.
---
The bullet doesn‚Äôt shoot off the green dot
---
Why?
---
nokk is kinda low tier in my opinion
---
Everyone expect mozzie and gridlock
---
Indeed.
---
When bringing a knife to a gunfight works.
---
Uhm thats the entire point of having that green dot in your screen

Virtual sound mixer software combined with a preloaded soundboard, I used to use VB-Audio VoiceMeeter and some simple soundboard software I found online and it worked with a bit of tweaking. The idea is that you have the soundboard feed the output to your headphones (just like normal when you play sound on your computer) but also feed it to your microphone input which then gets played through game chat. Generally I'd advise against this since it can be very annoying for other players and you'll probably get muted instantly but that's how they do it.

Some people will play them off their phones while others will use programs.

New branch of Jump Street confirmed.
---
She's is simultaneously both versions of cobra commander
---
Opinion: dont spawn there
---
fuck you, this is why i quit the game because of people like you
---
Ok lol
---
ok? i anchor in solo queue so i‚Äôm the last line of defense so yes sometimes i‚Äôm able to get easy picks. however my team mates shouldn‚Äôt die every round without at least trading. and i don‚Äôt shout at them i just get frustrated by their incompetence.
---
She's just a single christian mother. Leave her alone
---
Then get good, tf? Don‚Äôt spawn in stupid position and get ready for spawn peeks and rushes.

Went 11-2-3 so I agree
---
No but if the audio didn't change whenever you flipped the headphones I'd see a doctor. You could be loosing your hearing
---
TIL
---
It's happened to me a number of times. The only way to solve it I've found is to restart the game. If it happens I usually send it as a 3 speed, try and get a kill or two and hope that I have time to restart the game before the next round

I‚Äôm guessing RFF. One downed their teammate and then RFF downed them.

That could be his ‚Äútop donation‚Äù of the month/year maybe even day. But other streamers receive donations of minimum $10 just to write a message that will be read by the streamer. And this kind of donating happens a lot.

Hello HaloOnMyHorns, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ci5yvm/ump_45_rof_600/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

That happened to me like a week ago to it was stupid

PM me when you get on.
---
My headphones are broken right now

1 million iq
---
Yes, cut down on assholes reproducing

Yeah that‚Äôs the thing I can‚Äôt get a squad cause my headset broke I still got to get a new one.
---
opinion:console players are worse then pc, its simply a fact, and i dont see how you didnt die.
---
fact:im going to get temp or perm banned for this comment
---
I restarted after we lost the match and it fixed it. I lost a 1v1 because I couldn't tell where iq was coming from and looked to the wrong direction.
---
Well played. But fuck you. Exceptional tactics on your part. But still fuck you.
---
Ela is fine.
---
Well trust me when I say the audio was more than flipped.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it does either as I‚Äôm at work but even so casual players wouldn‚Äôt know the files are different and would bitch and moan to kingdom come and I don‚Äôt wanna see the sub filled with those shitposts.
---
It never works for me.
---
So you HAVE to Kobe it?

It *is* xbox and consoles have fucked audio

Nah fuck him let him quit. He‚Äôs probably the type to report wallbangs

When you open up the ubisoft club app on xbox who is the blonde on the left with the yellow watch. I noticed after they updated r6s that the watch turned more yellow ans looked like nokks...
---
what's your youtube channel? i'll tell warden to subscribe to u.
---
Just buy it from steam. It‚Äôs just easier and safer.
---
The window doesn‚Äôt allow sound to travel through, unless it‚Äôs popped, but those dude were assholes for TKing you
---
That‚Äôs definitely 18-2-2
---
Yeah, but it's like 24‚Ç¨ on Voidu right now (which is a trusted Ubisoft affiliate).
---
You think that‚Äôs annoying I was playing cav yesterday and would down people and their team would Tk to stop me from getting kills it‚Äôs just a kill as long as you win who fucking cares
---
Needs more raptor legs.
---
Wait they just literally buffed him last week, now they're nerfing him?
---
Fine in a state of being very pathetic.

Every time my buddy pulls something off like that he always messages the victim ‚ÄúStop. Hammer time‚Äù
---
Kobra commander
---
Console players aren't worse, really, there's just lots of difficulties with playing a FPS game with a controller, and the gamers tend to be a lot younger/less inclined to cooperate with each other and play as a team.  Controller aiming difficulties are compounded by this spawn-you can't just blast away, because you're in a narrow alley with 4 other players around you, so you have to take time to line up your shots, which is hard on controller.  (If you doubt this, watch someone trying to shoot out a cam on console.)
---
Lol 0% ban
---
I've seen quite a few posts about this so its not just you. You can't control who you queue up with so that's stupid anyway. No-one that cares about there rank will leave a ranked game.
---
oh that‚Äôs something i haven‚Äôt seen before has this always been the case
---
Also a day one player, she always has said Savta, she's from Isreal a Savta is a sort of like Nanny. She always refers to her.
---
Was mentioning myself. My bad
---
Yeah that is true I remember that feels like yesterday. This season has been shit
---
Only buff Glaz should have is having grenades. Competition with the Smokes is needed, and it gives him a less cheesy way of having a little more fragging prowess and team utility if needed
---
As long as we don't get another american ops I'm fine with whatever country.
---
wait...im such a dumb fuck oml sorry carry on soldier
---
Nice. You do you
---
I never thought Glaz was good
---
Well you can control it by getting a better connection
---
Try OBS or OBS labs if you wanna stream
---
It would be better if you play with a controller
---
I'm disgusted, but *intrigued*
---
That aim hurt but I'm glad you're passionate about the game.  Only up to go :)
---
This is hard to control because you could abuse this so when you lose you just pull out your ethernet cable and it wouldnt have any concequences I think that if you leave and your team still wins the match, then their shouldn't be an mmr penalty.
---
Ok
---
I grabbed siege yesterday. Only done tutorials and some of the situations but I worry a little that there are gonna be a lot of people like OP.
---
Very nice, love the smoke effects

On attack I like Thatcher or thermite for breaching support so we can push the objective. On defense I like to use lesion for area denial and I recently started using jaeger for some soft roaming and anchoring depending on how the round is going. His ADS is amazing and holding the attackers at bay.
---
The *smart* ash rush
---
You can get away with it on the ump
---
Xbox and consoles huh
---
Operators arent picked purely for their weapons. 
---
You state Jager has the best weapon and then say except the Alda. So who knew, The 2nd best defender gun gets picked. Common sense. 
---
Jager is not a powerhouse that is ruining the game and it doesnt need to be changed.
---
Maybe if the bomb is dropped middle of the map the brain dead play is from the bomb carrier and not the defenders.  
---
Being down a few within a minute is due to reckless play. Not over powered defender weapons. 
---
gadgets are balanced based on power and qaunitity.  You start giving them more gadget numbers and all of a sudden you have impenetrable sites or attackers who can just clear out entire floors. 
---
You sound like you are sick of mobility operators which usually means you either are playing far to slow or you are on your own getting flanked.

Interesting find and I see she's the attacker version of Vigil South Korean defensive operator that is possibly born in North Korea.
---
It‚Äôs like that scene in Pulp Fiction
---
I bought the game like yesterday.
---
I dunno why this is bad.
---
Now importantly: what *is* it?
---
How are models pulled from the game?
---
I actually thought of someone doing this last night and here it is. I expected much.
---
as a person who runs clash during strats. you have shown our greatest fear. take it down /s
---
Nope, you should be fine otherwise reach out to uplay support, they  take forever but are often helpful.
---
Would have TK'd the moment you demanded "DONT KILL"
---
They didn‚Äôt show us because we were off the charts
---
gotta catch em all
---
dam nice
---
If it has eyes they ate the most disturbing things i have ever seen
---
He used to be broken. Now they removed his ability to be the best entry fragger he is bad.   
---
Who knew an operator who benefits from long range would be bad when you take away their ability to entry frag.
---
Absolutely calculated right there
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Yeah, I've died in that spot multiple times because I can't move away fast enough
---
He was never my favourite neither but rn i would rather pick recruit
---
Only other things I can think of are the obvious, check to see if it shows voice as disabled under controls instead of push to talk. And check to see that voice output is turned up. Other than that, if steam version verify files. RIP and reinstall, or if you are one of those who never reboots thier computer , do that. Also check to see if you need updated driver wise for for both ie: icue/logitech. Last but not least different Usb ports for both. If you moved your tower or added new peripherals sometimes the routing can get messed. I know my yeti stopped working because it wasnt a USB 3.0 slot. When I get at my pc I will so some more digging.
---
i dont lag but my internet times out when ever it wants to
---
Ubisoft just can bully glaz enough
---
Nokk is far from terrible lol. The meta on defense at the moment is intel and Nokk counters exactly that.
---
&gt;neat&lt;
---
OP I have some questions. I play on ps4 and do have a smurf account, my main account is platinum, smurf is high silver. I don't TK or act toxic, I love playing at lower levels because everyone is so much more friendly. 
---
\-is playing but not necessarily \*tryharding\* as a smurf still a bad thing for you guys at that rank? When I play on my smurf, its to get away from all the toxicity in plat, relax a little, and I play ranked specifically so I'm not with plats. If I go like 5/3 in a match, would you say I'm still part of the problem?
---
\-if I start tryharding and clutch a round in a, lets say, 1v3, is that still a problem? Anyone could do that, but is it a bad thing that I stole that round from the other team?
---
\-is it bad if I TK the toxic smurfs? I've been in a lot of lobbies with them and I absolutely despise them. TK is bad bc u just lost a player, but I did it to get rid of the toxic, and prob not that great player, AITA?
---
I've always had these questions and never had answers to them. It'd be great to hear from you guys.
---
!neat!
---
i would love to play as some Mexicans lol
---
Not a flick..

---
Based on your username, yes it is.
---
Its both slow and fast at points. The better you get the faster you can play. If you play it like COD however.... you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time
---
Not once the round kicks off, no. With maximum 3.5 minute rounds and a 45 second prep phase, things can kick off pretty fast. Part of it is setup and lurking/roaming sometimes, but it certainly isn't boring.

---
Nokk and nomad*
---
Yeah. The thing about buck is he is useful on every map which is really nice. Every one compares him to sledge but they are not the same AT ALL.  Buck is king and NO ONE CAN CHANGE MY MIND!
---
Ohhh, it‚Äôs secure area. I was really confused about how the barricades were deployed (I still think you‚Äôd want a rotate there, but less crazy not to have one in secure area). 
---
Those guys didn‚Äôt lose because of a bad strat, they lost because you had much better aim. I don‚Äôt expect they would have fairer better had they trooped in from a different direction. There‚Äôs still a choke point for you to mow them down.
---
I should be more clear, by "dragging out" I mean more of "taking your time." Not everyone likes to rush, and not everyone should have to rush if they don't think it's best. No, you shouldn't be dragging out a match just T-Bagging over someone or running around in circles as a troll move, but if you need to take a long way because it's unexpecting, want to make roatation after rotation to confuse an enemy, or if you need to drone out rooms before you enter, that's fine. Take your time, play the way you want. Perhaps I'm just a patient person, but I'm never yelling at someone to hurry up when they're in a clutch situation and still have 2 minutes on the clock. We don't all play at the same pace, let others enjoy the experience too.
---
And I don't know if you mean "recruit prep" where you do essentially nothing, but for others it can take longer, especially if you plan to work with other operators and combine gadgets. And Attackers don't always spawn at the furthest point away. Some spawn points have you right up on the room. So once they're running, you might get caught off guard when you're placing a reinforcement or gadget, and that's already sometimes an issue. 
---
And I assure not all leave because a round is taking long. And if they are, then perhaps there's a lesson to be learned there. If you are to be cautious and take your time more, then maybe you won't end up dead and sitting on the sidelines so early. Perhaps trying that will cut down on your barking complaints about others.
---
Extremely slow in casual where people drone the whole building and wait until the last second to enter the building. You'll have to grind that to unlock ranked at level 30, and ranked ain't much better.
---
Lol if you seen how he was after his big nerf and then how he is after his recent buff(couple days ago) he‚Äôs a lot more practical to play. Hence why I said that. Why would that mean I don‚Äôt know either ? I read the patch notes, clearly you two nut heads didn‚Äôt because you both thought I was talking about a NERF that happened way before that made Glaz useless.
---
They‚Äôre buffing him in next update
---
He was OP before the nerf
---
Life is old there
---
If you guys think this game is toxic yall are just trash. See me being good leads to no toxicity. It pretty simple imo.
---
True that. Yeah it was just casual which probably explains a lot. We still lost. Came down the the next round and basically the same thing happened and I killed 2 but they played a little smarter and some dude with a shotgun got me
---
What a fucking shame the two lord and savior are put up on the chopping block
---
This is happening to me as well. It can't be ddos, because it will lag for like a minute before it drops connection. I've made sure it's bot on my end, it has to be ubis servers

---
Got one
---
holy sensitivity
---
Leveling up is too easy, maybe if you rank up, it would work better, and if casuals wanted an easier way to get alpha packs, they would play ranked, making the casual-to-ranked player ratio balanced, as all things should be.
---
I thought the average player was Gold? Plus they know more about the game then the people that are legitly in Bronze or Copper. Everybody should have a say in it as everybody plays the same ranked as everybody else.

Reporting with video evidence of the DDOS and the players in the lobby can help narrow down who it is doing it. But I'd keep my expectations low, it would need multiple reports from different matches to be able to narrow down the list to the one.

Hey that‚Äôs fine, you do you, I‚Äôm just saying there are people out there that want more then just Pro League maps.
---
With the new change to ranked to bomb only it's gotten really sweaty. I don't jump into ranked without at least a 3 stack.
---
Life gets to you sometimes. 3 speeds become 1 speeds.
---
Mind you, it was a ranked game
---
I think that is the best idea I have seen on this sub in awhile. Something like what battlefield does? Try out the guns and gadgets. You could see how they work and see if it fits your play style. Great idea. I‚Äôm sure there is a place to send that to Ubi.
---
They aren't bad, they are just less fun, yes that's just my opinion, but it's also the opinion of the majority of our fine player base.
---
Look at gridlock, I hear all the time about how good she is but how people don't want to use her because 1 speeds on attack are a chore. 
---
I'm just echoing opinions I hear on the lfg server, I don't meet many people who express joy in playing 1 speeds.
---
Yea..what you said
---
i have like 105 lol
---
Yeah. Twitch's drone used to be a speedy boi but now even Rook could out run it.
---
All shields have been broken since release. They have never made any attempt at fixing them. However people refuse to learn how to counter them properly, so they just keep nerfing them because people keep complaining. Its why they have been fucking decimating blitz for years despite never being a good operator (statistically speaking).
---
ok
---
I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm usually more shocked than pissed.
---
When you wrote Ninja with a capital N, I was actually expecting a "the fuck did you say to me" joke... I'm disappointed

Don't worry bro, your English is very good. Better than many of the people on reddit. And I appreciate efforts done by you to learn English.
---
look at Sargent Stretch Armstrong in the back. lol
---
You have to play more passively and also your aim has to be pretty damn good. If you have that then I would say yes.

Wait.. you guys have renown ?

Please don't. This sub is not the place. You'll just be annoying people.

I wanna see chankas face plz

Nope, just tried it sadly

I mean im annoyed but thats the game.

Oh then my mistake

Stop

They can be really inconsistent with damage and pellet spread. They can feel like a liability sometimes. If you can hit your shots at close range, however, the time between shots doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
If you‚Äôre starting to enjoy shotguns, you probably want to try out the best shotgun on defense: Ela‚Äôs FO-12. Slap an extended barrel on that bad boy and enjoy wrecking attackers.

He is talking about his streams, not his videos.

You should expect run outs every time and everywhere you spawn.

Go to sub main page, click three dot thing, then add user flair.

Ya, something like a private firing range where you have different ranges, timers and stuff. Plus maybe a obstacle course.
---
yes, that is true. I agree actually, but from this little simple add on I fail to see how THIS in particular will add any severe bugs or glitches.

I'm back, you still having the issue?

Yeah i only know 1 person that play ranked a lot and i don't want to jump in to ranked with out being able to talk to people. I don't have a headset and i don't want to talk to randoms which might sound weird but some people are just toxic or ruin the game for me. I use to just listen to see if anyone had callouts but it got annoying cause all they would talk about was like "HOW DID HE KILL ME I BET HE IS HACKING I'M DONE"  and then the TOXIC team kill in causal. Some times i want to play ranked because i think it wouldn't as bad team kill wise but I'm not good so i don't know if i should play ranked most of the time. I don't want to go in and get like 2 kills and ruin the match for someone but GOD people are annoying.
---
That would be awesome
---
Queue up some casual, within a month or so I had probably about 3 full teams. I rarely encounter teamkillers, but I also normally have 3 people including myself on the rare occasion I boot up my pc anymore. Looking for discord servers is a common way to find a team as well

It is clear he has intentions of becoming what you know as a smurf though, and he's already "griefing" less skilled players, in my books he is a smurf. 
---
Regardless, you are correct in that a 95.5% win rate is absurdly high. This player was in my casual game earlier and although I can't say for certain whether he was a cheater or not but I will say he did have 1 or 2 deaths to his name and the MMR for the game was high gold to low plat.
---
Its in the top right corner.
---
She's underwhelming. She's not bad but there are definitely better options.

I'm pretty sure clash and mozzie have Glocks? Unless clash has a Glock ripoff. But I know mozzie is using a Glock with a Roni carbine kit on it
---
Trick shot finial kill?
---
No I ain't wrong, and no one's asking for 1 site between me and site, but having a map with too many rooms are just generally bad. Hereford, Theme Park, Fortress, all of these maps are good examples of just being way too big for their own good.
---
Yeah sex is cool but have you ever killed someone with a evil eye?
---
Sorry I'm new to rainbow what is the gun name in game?

I've been seeing this a lot more since shields got nerfed.

Tbh it sucks, but its better than the two front spawns. Either hug the wall to your left and hold the angle or run behind the truck to the right.
---
Opinion: I personally think that Endgame was a little too long as a movie

Wheres Ark on this? Ive met some real special kinds of toxic on there

i thinnk theres a hidden mmr like ranked but that we can‚Äôt see it‚Äôs either that or rank but idk

This was the last thing I expected before clicking on this.

Skyscraper is full of run-outs. Even with Nomad seems uncomfortable to me
---
Love the unique idea, I feel like it could really fit!

hahah my bad dude ahaha

fortress is perfect, theme park and hereford need a rework

fortress is perfect because it really requires you to play strategically, rather than just ‚Äúrush into site‚Äù

Hello The_RealTrickz! **It looks like your post is about recruiting players or looking for a team.** Be sure to check out these great resources for teamfinding:
---
Very nice idea
---
Ubisoft employee
---
It's a ingame menu background from Y1S1. The game used to have these and they were great!
---
I'd say for almost a year, probably, a while ago at like 300K I bought 50 alpha packs and dropped, haven't bought them since
---
Sorry Im already in a clan
---
Don't worry about it xD
---
It's fine :)
---
So here is a thing: Cav and Vigil are Defenders.
---
As Roamers, they can be anywhere in the map and attack from many different angles. Their stealth mechanics help them to flank/hold angle against oncoming Attackers.
---
Now let‚Äôs look at their strength.
---
Cav‚Äôs strength doesn‚Äôt really come from her being quiet. It comes mostly from her interrogation which exposes everyone‚Äôs location and give a massive advantage to her team while that‚Äôs happening. Vig‚Äôs strength comes from having a pretty decent guns. K1A is very reliable. Attackers who rely on drone to enter rooms might decide to go other way just by his presence. 
---
Nokk might have a similar gadget as those two but she‚Äôs an Attacker. She‚Äôs the one entering the map and going to obj so her position and angle options are far more limited. 
---
If you want to compare Nokk to someone, you have to compare her to the other Attackers, namely the flankers.
---
Ash, Mav, and IQ are currently far more efficient than Nokk. There‚Äôs very little reason for Nokk being picked over other Attackers in her current state.
