Yes it works in canada but its android only

---
Which sensitivity are you running?
---
You mean cesspool?
---
It’s not an F2 it’s an F1 FAMAS
---
According to Siege’s ranking system it’s based off 5 games so KDR doesn’t matter?
---
If you've ever worn one of these you'd know that this is not what Nokk would see. You barely even notice it after a while, in fact it just looks like a blurred color screen in front of you eventually.
---
"Due to abuse, we have disabled this service." Lmao
---
Lmaoooo yes sorry about that. Edited for being dumb
---
I know Valkyrie and soon warden use the mpx
---
Ive always wanted an option for custom games to allow any operator to be used on either team. Maybe even multiple of the same operator.
---
For Nokk I would use it over Lesion's shotgun,  but on Smoke i use the shotgun to open holes and such, and then the SMG-11 for combat.
---
ACOGs should just be available on DMRs.
---
Bandit and recruit can use the mp7. Rook,Doc, and recruit can use the mp5. Mute and recruit can use the mp5sk and Valkyrie can use the mpx
---
bro it's just a joke
---
Ummm dont wanna talk about how i waste i mean use my shots
---
What rank are you
---
Not everyone has shit aim get up to gold and you’ll realize that it isn’t a bad scope
---
It’s fun though. You do it cause you wanna be an asshole which is fun :)
---
This will never work as you reinforce that hatch to prevent that

I'd +1 Jackal, extremely controllable gun and fun ability. In defense I find mute's gun to be easy to master, but I'm not sure if you'd like his ability, same goes to Lesion. Maybe I'd even say Cav.
---
But Alpha Packs aren't bought with real money. You don't buy the R6 credits to open them, it's completely earned in game with the Renown. So I don't think it would fall under that congressional bill anyways. If they were bought with real money that's one thing, but you can only earn the packs. HOWEVER, I just though of this.. the Alpha Packs like the April Fools ones, those would be outlawed and no longer allowed to be done (since you had to pay real money for those if you wanted them all)
---
I didn’t say it was a bad scope only that so many peoplw’s aim suffer because of it
---
Ive gone 20 -5 in ranked before... but im not consistent
---
The problem with Cav is I need to be careful at all times. I'm exploring and I'm not the best at roaming.
---
High gold 3 lvl 70
---
What’s your rank?
---
Fucking jacket XD
---
Not when she’s ugly as fuck
---
That sounds like something you may need to see a doctor about if it's that bad.
---
Pffffft whaaaaat no that’s crazy, Tarzan just happens to be the coolest guy evr and he trained me how to shoot so I owe him a debt but nooooooo not an ad, that’s whew...that’s funny.
---
True. If fuze was a 2-2 he'd be one of the most picked operators in the game.
---
If you are only good at certain maps then you are bad
---
I wont take this slander
---
I feel your pain.
---
i swear if this happens imma lose my shit ash never deserved to lose the acog she didnt need a fucking neef by removing her acog her fucking hitbox needed a stupid fucking fix ubishit
---
I guess all pro players are shit then and you are the best player in the world
---
Exactly. That’s boring.
---
I also think about a time where Jager and Bandit had ACOGs and I wanted to KMS every game I played. Good times... good times...
---
Cool
---
Awesome
---
They did not just do my girl like this
---
put in a bug report, its the TTS for a reason
---
Honestly, twitch was my main.
---
oof
---
I Will do
---
Are you kidding me
---
Commando is probably his best weapon. Always run super shorty as secondary. Barbed wire over C4 unless nobody else on your team has any type of plant denial (in which case, Mozzie probably isn't the best op pick though). 
---
Don't stress too much about getting drones. Just put your gadgets down at the beginning of the round and then get busy on your setup. 
---
Whether you get drones or not, Mozzie is a top tier roamer and can make rotates for himself with the shotty. The better your map knowledge the more you will get out of Mozzie. Play vertically on sites that demand it, pre-place kill holes with your shotgun. There are basically no other operators that get 3-speed, info gathering gadget, high DPS primary and a shotgun secondary all in one package. You can basically do everything and fill any role for your team.
---
I'm honestly at a point where I truly believe that if the ACOG is so good that it can only be used by certain operators and certain weapons, then maybe it should just not be in the game at all.
---
For part 1 we all in there securing in the action while this dude is outside 
---
For part 2 we couldnt miss out this advanced peeking tutorial
---
More like beneficial for run outs and easy deaths
---
lol
---
This is fucking ridiculous.
---
is this legit?
---
i only managed to get into one last January
---
Overdone, ironically or unironically alike. 2/10.
---
get more ram for starters, siege is recommended at 8gb and bare minimum is 6gb.
---
Honestly, filters for all masked characters would be pretty fuckin' cool.
---
It’s a glitch not a trick. But I bet your post got removed when you put glitch in the title
---
Please don’t like this
---
If they want people to use something else then the F2 with her just give us a better option then the shit DMR. Getting rid of the ACOG just makes me not even play here then bes that is my play style on Attack and it's been like that from the Beta days.
---
No
---
YYAASSS I hate fortress so much 
---
I wish you could disable maps in matchmaking preferances
---
That Monty had a family
---
Just no villa it’s a nightmare on bomb
---
its only around 60gb. the burnt horizon update was massive because it included stuff to shrink the overall game size.
---
What do you mean the lord is a c class. There should be a L class just for the lord. he is obviously far superior than all the other ops.
---
Tbh I feel like he was trolling you guys or was letting someone else play.. He's plat 2 no way someone gets to plat 2 legitimately playing that lol.
---
Would be a cool feature
---
I think she gave up so they started walking
---
Pc mostly but i have the game on ps4 as well
---
either you won with a cheater on your team. or you beat a cheater that sucked
---
Maybe as a April fools?
---
People get banned on Xbox all the time for various things. Source I report people and get messages saying action has been taken.
---
Im on console, so Im assuming ur on PC?
---
I can see u
---
Yes! No Chalet. Hate that map
---
Thanks
---
I believe so
---
If you defend bar you always reinforce that hatch so you can hold sight on it
---
There was a disgusting glitch where people were able to use their gun while her sheild was up so no one could kill her
---
Nice man!
---
seems like an average take but i'd prefer a mav taking the back trench cause he can make sneaky holes on the side of reinforced wine closet so they can't hold in there even if they have a mira
---
I wouldn’t worry about new comers there is only three maps on that playlist and it’s not a very good way to learn the maps I recommend playing situations just to get some basic tips and then just play casual the rest will come with time siege can be a difficult game witch is why I also recommend playing with a friend it doesn’t matter if he or she is a vet or new to the game the experience is hundred times better with friends
---
*Sticks gun through forehead*
---
There was some game-breaking glitches people were abusing and ig ubi couldn't fix them yet so they just temporarily removed clash and claymores
---
F2 so op it needs to lose acog, meanwhile ALDA laughts.
---
because its casual..
---
Ah I get it lol
---
True that
---
found the Jager ACOG user
---
GOOD LUCK I'M BEHIND 7 SMOKES
---
Everyone asks "Where's Thermite?" but not "How's Thermite?"

Ok...Is there a problem with that?

Where is jaguar’s and Ash’s acog ( I don’t think I spelled it right)

I always thought the SMG11 was basically an uzi (MAC-11)

---
You don't even need to dos the servers. Leaving a ranked game gives you an abandon penalty but doesn't count as a loss or preserve your K/D from the game. 
---
If you go 0-7 and leave a game, none of those deaths are recorded. You will just lose ELO (hence why this dude is in bronze).

what the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land

Hello MFJ_Shotty, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bspx36/tts/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
If it’s meant to be funny, like a funny glitch or something, then I don’t care what game mode it is. But if it’s a clutch, I’ll instantly downvote if it’s casual. Casual clutches are fine, but I don’t like them because they take no skill. You’re playing an unorganized squad that probably consists of low rank players who aren’t trying. A 1v5 casual clutch means nothing to me unless it’s funny, like if all 5 people hit a Kapkan trap.
---
Sorry for the rant, just what I think
---
I did on the playstation but he was using the I.Q glitch that made u invisible so thats why...never legit tho. Crazy.

It frustrated me at a stage so I'm just more than happy to give what I found at that time. :) aint what we want but its what we have.

I disagree with you on that one
---
I'd like to see it/similar in the coming years too. It was a nice change of pace from the PvP, and even more so from the PvE. Though Ubi has said they won't do any other event like it, unfortunately.
---
Only weakness? Wood chippers.
---
same here I much prefer than the f2. for the life of me I can't control that gun.
---
It’s understandable, there are many things that need to be fixed
---
You can download the video as mp3, cut the songs out into individuals on your computer, and if you have an iPhone sync the songs first into iTunes and then your phone. Bomb you gotten on your phone
---
This is why I’m glad clash is gone
---
I am in no way saying it is better than the f2, i mean that if they removed the ACOG from the f2 I would have no issues switching to the 417
---
Why wouldnt you want that?
---
Honestly I really don't get how people pull off ninja defuses so easily.. you can hear the defusing sound so blatantly

---
*hardbass plays in the distance*
---
good job
---
The demons are back
---
There weren’t that many operators so it kinda made sense
---
yea I just a matter of preference really. just because a gun is better on paper doesn't mean its a must for players.
---
bum tss
---
Instant black ice for every gun
---
I just like DMRs, I use the dmr on buck and on lion. Love the crazy high damage and little recoil
---
Looks like just the right amount lol
---

---
I’m confused by this. Are Lesion/Ying’s shotty coded differently? One has a built in suppressor
---
Yeah, the removal did it's job, you guys need to stop obsessing over a weapon attachment.
---
I feel for all the teammates you had while you were throwing every match to get that
---
I assume so. Don’t they have different names? It’s why they had to give he muzzle break and suppressor to the Deagles for Blackbeard and Valkyrie.
---
Then give her an Ar
---
Haha, yes thank you. I would never have worked out what he meant until you said that, thank you kind stranger.
---
Yep this happens on a regular basis now. Totally normal i swear
---
Who else zoomed in on Ela’s ass just to make sure
---
Anytime your timer passes 2 minutes, restart it.
---
The weapon attachment made it fun, and the ACOG is a lot of people’s favorite operator. I would have preferred maybe a damage nerf like they did when they dropped twitch from 40 to 37 and dropped the R4-C to 36 from 39 and go from there
---
Thanks, restarted it twice and finally worked
---
Wow
---
Unplug your other screen when you play. Seems pretty obvious, but I mean.... are you really using it when you play?
---
Thanks, I usually wait until 5 min mark but will start retrying at 2!
---
I mean if it is fake, it’s a damn good fake at that
---
sorry for the &gt;30fps video, just found out the TRN r6 stat tracker app captures videos of your kills.
---
*takes whiff of scent aromiating off video* "Mmm...this is nice"
---
The fact you’re on console doesn’t make it easier to control, it makes it harder because you’re on a controller and not a mouse. There’s a reason the game actually gives guns less recoil on controller.

Both of those things are literally his gadget? If glad could get his flip sight on an AK 12 he would be a better/over powered character? Are you high?

Get the fuck off this sub
---
Castle probably locked them in. lol
---
Why are you booing him? He's right!
---
Yeah I do cocaine everyday I do have issues
---
Nah get jackal
---
play castle and barricade every big door in obj trust me people love it
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(no really tho)
---
\-Drone the fuck out of obj
---
\-Don't mark unless your drone can escape quickly and you don't have a mic.
---
\-Play like a bitch, You're running on limited hp. Nobody is gonna make fun of a 3 hp cav running from a full team getting surged by Finka
---
\-(If you have mains) tell your team about them early so they or you can adjust.
---
\-Don't autolock..
---
\-Make sure to figure out where traps (I.e. frost mats, EDDs, grzmots) are during the prep phase. The only trap operator not included here is Lesion since he you could only figure out where 1 of his mines are during the prep phase
---
\-Lesion doesn't punish people for rushers, he punishes late game pushers.
---
\-Drone out the room before tossing in a nade/flash/emp etc. so they don't get ads'd
---
\-Lobbing nades/flashes into a room mid gunfight is a viable strat that can actually win you the fight if you're lucky. I've won countless ranked rounds because I just Y E E T E D both of my nades at enemies during a full team gunfight
---
\-DO NOT BARRICADE DOORS. It slows down your roamers from getting to the obj during the last minute or so of the match.
---
\-If you get spotted, take out the drone and MOVE. Even moving a few feet can give you the edge in a gunfight.
---
\-If you have the health to spare or a finka, prone on a maestro turret to block the taser while the thermite/hibana breaches the wall. Also shields are good for denying maestro turrets.
---
\-If you're playing a shield op on atk and you're pushing with your team, you should be point man just by default (take the lead.) Your 1 armor breacher shouldn't be the one pushing into an obj or chokepoint, the literal human wall should.
---
\-As vigil, if a drone spots you (if it's alone) use your cloak, find out where it's going and just destroy it. Don't run away screaming bloody murder.
---
\-Make sure you have a good deal of knowledge about the map you're on before you place a black mirror anywhere. If you don't and it's definitely safe, you can run into that room and see if it's a good spot or not. Don't be afraid to ask a teammate either.
---
\-With 3 speed q u i c c n e s s and his crossbow's rapid aoe damage, Capitao is the best equipped operator to flush anchors out of/keep them out of an obj.
---
\-If you have killed the carrier, put a gu mine or place a prisma nearby to watch the defuser. If one of them goes off, get to the closest site to them.
---
\-Fuze and Dokkaebi combo great together. The second your team's dokkaebi finishes calling phones, fuze the room ONLY if you hear any buzzing.
---
\-Put grzmot mines on the direct doors/windows to the obj. They can disorient pushers just enough for anchors/nearby roamers to take care of them.
---
\-Don't roam in the last 30 seconds or even minute of a match. Most of the time the late part of a round will involve a final push towards the obj, and your team needs extra help for that last stand against the attackers, they don't need you across the map while capitao burns them to death,
---
\-If you're playing cav, try to use your game sense to decide on getting the interrogation or just finishing them. Alot of the cavs I play with die early since the moment they down someone they blindly rush towards them ignoring the other 4 attackers right next to them.
---
\-Sitting in a corner and just calling out enemy positions as monty works 11 times out of ten.
---
\-Zofia is really just a better ash.
---
\-In a 5/4/3 v 1, feel free to get a little more aggressive since the last player will most likely be panicking and trying to get back to obj/find a spot to camp.
---
Would not shock me tbh.
---
My hit reg? Nah I'm fine with that but the killcan hit the is what I'm complaining about,I was killee and watched the kill cam and the fucker was hitting the wall 2 meters away from me and somehow killed me
---
2 meters is 2.19 yards
---
No, stop romanticizing the past, Ash DOES NOT need the ACOG. 
---
It's been removed and isn't coming back, deal with that reality.
---
In game
---
this has been happening to me with lion and his claymores every. single. game. is this a thing
---
No prob
---
Mira absolutely changes the way sites can be played. Jackal is just a good operator. I feel as though Mira is has such a unique play style, that that’s the route you gotta take.
---
Hello there
---
No. Because the AK-12 is an automatic weapon meant for medium range. A sight like glaz’s would be unusable
---
Your right she doesn’t need it, but since the ops balance around win rate and it went UP with the removal one could say she was nerfed unjustifiably. We just want the game to be fun and if what was in the past was fun without being OP then I don’t see why we can’t speak up.
---
I still feel like for those that grinded for the attachments and stuff deserve to get their renown back.
---
lmao
---
I can confirm Mira=way to go
---
The problem is twofold. A: With no Acog people ran Holo or Reflex. The thing is the Holo sight, lacking magnification, is perfect for close quarters. So all the Ash mains who did nothing but rush objective suddenly found themselves doing better because they weren't limited by the Acog's 2X Magnification.
---
B: They used the Acog on the G3 rather than the R4. The G3 may have less damage and lower firerate, but it has little to no recoil. So the *really* good Ash mains who already were shitbags with the R4 became SUPER shitbags with the G3. Lower recoil means they can run angled grip with the acog, so those who could handle Acog in close quarters became horrifying.
---
In the end removing the Acog did nothing but help Ash mains. So now she's more cancerous and even easier to use.
---
Ubisoft fucked up and there is no going back. If they add the Acog back to the R4 all the G3 users are going to go back to it and we'll be in a worse situation.
---
Honestly though, Ash is in a decent spot right now. She's annoying as shit, but she fills her role. kinda the same thing with Blitz. You can't really do anything about it because thats what she is.
---
The DL-44 was based on a Mauser C96 broomhandle
---
Thanks for the insight, I’ll prob go Mira
---
Claymores have been take out temporarily to fix a glitch

Are you playing windowed fullscreen? If not there was a period where my ShadowPlay made games act like I was, try turning that off if you have it.

Hello Rainbowls, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bsqdid/there_has_been_a_consistent_mic_bug_on_pc_for/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
If they do BETTER with the holo or G3 then I don’t see why going back would hurt the game even more. It’s not like I’m a die hard ash main, I just miss the ash I used to love to play if I didn’t see another good pick.
---
Maybe.... Just Maybe

Someone got high and fucked fusion360

I swear if that is a pun...

You are the choosen one you have kabosu charm!

"Then I don't see why we can't speak up."
---
Cause you're wrong and the drop in her pickrate proves this.
---
This has happened to me believe it or not
---
The video starts at 0:50, nice kills though.
---
The drop in her pick rate proves my point, she was fun, this a game where you’re supposed to have fun. The win rate went up showing the ACOG wasn’t anything broken or OP.
---
sorry, forgot to trim it down.
---
I didn’t expect Sam Fisher even though I read it in his voice.

I like the idea of the F2 treatment, remove 3 or so damage and make it just that bit harder to kill.

Yes that’s very nice.
---
Killcams have been busted all season. They don’t show your character leaning, the killcam looks like people miss because your character is standing straight up and down, but real time your head was poking out. It’s been an issue all season idk how people still don’t know this
---
I feel like the easiest way to combat this is to just add a button to report them for MnK. After enough reports those people get banned or put into their own lobbies
---
thats why your silver /s
---
Probably another program doing that,
---
Truly is an amazing gun with that recoil

Holy fuck thats perfect

What do you mean it lags in yours? It’s a light filter it’s not using much system resources at all. If it’s lagging your game then your settings are either too high in game or your computer doesn’t have the specs to play
---
Go do something better than just complain bud

Nah this was a custom game and I just met them so idk.

Overwatch symbol on a rainbow card
---
I got a division 1 advertisement in a rainbow box
---
Yeah I know that, just didn’t know how to phrase it. Moira from Overwatch is a really good example of this - in first person she always has her hands out in front of her, ready to attack. However, in third person, she is always running with her hands behind her like Naruto and moves her hands up and forward when attacking.

Kaid and Bandit should at least be A+ since they can change the entire attacking team's plan.
---
Yeah I know that, just didn’t know how to phrase it. Moira from Overwatch is a really good example of this- in first person always has her hands out in front of her, ready to attack. However, in third person, she is always running with her hands behind her like Naruto and moves her hands up and forward when attacking.

Absolute legends many thanks man

Here you go, skip to the last 40 seconds

Idk what your talking about man this game is perfect no problems at all 😂😂
---
I understood that reference.
---
This is fair. I suppose maybe some TVs/monitors may have an option to adjust colours, but I genuinely didn’t think of consoles when making my suggestion.
---
Yeah because it came out after R6S. Every Ubisoft game had ads for their next big game.
---
It's working for me now

Hes gold though disappointing

I remember back when that was an original title

Yeah I know. I just found it cool i got such a old box

Hahah is that the fucking random dude from deadool?

I wanna know how you came out of the engagement with 100 hp.

Do you think i know ?

His name was Peter and he was a damn hero. Put some respect on his name.

I would love to have a drink with Montagne!!! Very cool

Where is Tachanka acog 😭😭😭😭😭
---
Right here 🤘
---
What In the actual fuck?
---
Those were the days
---
nice! thank you!

Ha i wish. Im like bronze 2 and im at like a .7 kd

There’s also the change of a blood thickener which could stop bleeding and reduce pain for up to 25 minutes

My ping defaults me to eas servers. Almost everyone either only speaks Mandarin or stays silent. I found out I can switch servers and went to seas. Thank goodness for Singaporean and Malaysian players who all speak English perfectly.
---
My appreciation.
---
That is fucking amazing, best siege momenet ive ever seen
---
they said that 3 armors would be the only ones capable of having acogs, not that every 3 armor must have an acog.
---
I don't mind, it gives me something to work towards. Plus, it only takes 4-5 rounds for me to get enough renown for them, so it's less of a hassle than a reward for an hour or two of playing.
---
Now prob. :D
---
I always joke about a gimp outfit with leather straps and a ball gag. when he extends it says something too the effect of "hit me harder".
---
Wasn’t intended lol
---
Fair enough. Thermite is a really fun operator though so hes worth it
---
Owch...That's a real RIP
---
Kinda like hacks we are constantly using to when we can't do it the normal way. Like looking at a normal image and figuring out what's relatively where.

remove tower for fuck sake. and remake bartlett
---
She was in a perfect spot win rate-wise, but ubi wants to show off all their ops and having 70% of all rounds having ash. Play g36c or just use reflex or twitch or IQ.
---
Nomad has become must pick since
---
Depends. You're comparing apples and oranges. Mute is better for drone denial. Bandit is far superior for hard breaching denial. Similar gadgets with 2 very different uses.
---
Agree 100%
---
nah cause he has the mpx, then that means valk will have mpx
---
Are you okay friend? Have you eaten? Are you tired? Because you seem tense
---
Good thats your first step to being good at rainbow. Hating the game
---
Fuck no. That’s a terrible idea.
---
Fuck you house is the Nuketown of Rainbow. No one wants to play it competitively but everyone loves it for casual and customs
---
Easily bandit, Mute's is nice to just place and forget about but it doesn't destroy anything so the attackers just have to deal with it and then they essentially get those gadgets back.
---
That music is so oddly familiar
---
No, mute can jam x-kiros,breaching charges, thermite charges, cluster charges, ect
---
You realize you can get skins for your favourite guns with that reknown right? Or buy alpha packs with the reknown
---
But... that would require new models and Ubi isn’t feeling that lately.

I love the operator icon. I want it as a keychain charm LUL

Wait until you get to high ranks and get clapped the moment you even breath on a barricade.

Itd be nice if they had like.. a Classic Operators only mode, thatd be pretty fun

Doc and Ela that low....

Nintendo switch
---
Which ones exactly?
---
Nah you mean wii?
---
Yeah that’s because Ubisoft have removed shield and claymore for the time being. Because of the stupid glitches you can do with them
---
I mean, I guess? Sounds weird to me either way
---
Up to date i see XDDD
---
Thing is people showing off strats are always fighting some sort of retards
---
If your go to secondary gadgets are claymores and deployable Shields they have been temporary removed due to game braking bugs
---
Can I get veterans discount on the attachments?
---
This is about gadgets
---
Doc I’ll give ya. Explain why Ela should be higher? IQ the only real/clear counter to Echo. Why she got A, plus great gun (552) and 3 speed.
---
Try r/R6ProLeague
---
Why is the picture taken so poorly?
---
I did it with ela in gold 3 never got punished
---
Spam the n word

What season?
---
What's the problem here
---
I been doing it with every op since operation health
---
W8... DID YOU JUST ASSUME NØK'S GENDER!!!!
---
I only now realize that every operation the 2 operators are always one girl and one boi.
---
How has nobody deleted you yet
---
Nope
---
Depends on map and area. Attack has potential the better weapons but st cqc these advantages aren't that big.
---
Mira costs just as much as the Season 1 operators (exept for Buck and Frost, they cost less)

do you use normal TAA? if yes use either off, fxaa or taa2x if you can handle it (I think TAA just blurs everything) 
---
also turn off depth of field on the sight if it's on.
---
Then it was most likely a ddos. The game is erased pretty much.
---
I'm going to get down voted, but I say they need to rework Coastline. That whole center courtyard could be reworked into a new bomb site.

Purely cosmetic. It’s ok. Better than everything else she has and a cool MVP

I've seen it before. I think it actually came from an interview of a sniper, not sure, though.
---
Ok
---
She ain't that thicc. She just has a FUCKED spine

Wasn't more or less effective, just blue. Only difference it really made is that it made whose smoke it was easily identifiable (if the bolt cue and the Para sound effects weren't enough) and added a bit of flavour.

What the fuck
---
[data expunged]
---
Its all these Ash mains getting salty over her lost acog so they all gravitate to Twitch, best gun, decent speed and a gadget that i havent seen used in ranked since she now gets instalocked by the entry fragger on the team who thinks she’s the new ash. What comes next is the nerfs, loss of acog? Less damage? More recoil? Then they all gravitate to the next OP with an acog, most likely Zofia and the cycle continues. Same with Doc on defence, first it was Jager then Bandit. The Acog seems to be a crutch to so many people.
---
Highly unlikely considering they just recently cracked it and there’s not much out there in terms of people making anything other than emulators for them. Probably just m&amp;k or bad kill cams.
---
Yeah but why would hiding her heritage be a matter of national concern though.  
---
I think her being the royal bastard makes more sense.
---
What about just for balancing reasons something like that?:O Haven't played with her yet tho...
---
That was the reason why I could never afford ACOGs.
---
Barely over a year, newfags gonna newfag.
---
Probably a bug.
---
Damn I remember buying ALL attachments for most of my guns, then the next day it's all free
---
Hmmm, thanks, btw did expect such a fast reply!
---
That pistol like a smg
---
You just "started" as smoke.
---
Experienced smoke players would tell you to not føkking touch him since he is "very" balanced and needs no changes, and definitely not this.
---
I don't think it would ever matter, since if you take out gadgets with it, you'll still be heard.
---
We have a game for that, it's Escape from Tarkov.
---
Yeah, I realised that after the comments.
---
Thanks tho.
---
Only bomb is going to be available in Ranked, both secure and hostage are getting pulled
---
Damn :( is that coming with the new update in a few weeks?
---
Sometimes I get 1000 ping lol
---
It doesn't give the directional arrows, and when there's other sounds on the map, suppressed gunfire is easily missed.
---
Does anyone else get giddy seeing a Castle barricade when you are Fuze?
---
Ranked is NOT PL, else we would already have 6th pick, which is never coming.
---
I said "extension". Use common sense, bruv. Right now, EVERYTHING except map pool (which was originally intended but was cancelled in the last moment) and 6th pick (unanimously agreed that it wouldn't fit) are based off PL's rules. 3 round swap, pick and ban, intentions to balance existing ranked maps, balancing ops based on pro players, etc., are all from ranked. Ranked is slowly becoming, as ubi intended, a very close mirror to PL.
---
Your either legitimately blind or have a serious case of glaucoma if you can't see that.
---
Yeah same, it always goes up to 1097 ping for like 5 seconds then goes back to normail
---
I bought every single attachment, for every single weapon...... then Ubi makes them all free, wtf...
---
How do you have so many flairs
---
Drone better if you don't already.
---
Learn common roamer paths.
---
Find perfect angles and quick peek corners.
---
If you know an enemy is there, prefire before turning corners and doorways. As you turn and spot them, correct your aim.
---
Set up distractions. Wall punches and breach charges are good for this.
---
Don't enter the same way each time.
---
And a big one I cannot for the the life of me understand why people still do this, but when defending, stop chasing kills when it is not necessary. 10 seconds left does not mean run out and try to snag the remaining enemy for an easy win. 9 times out 10 I see that person get killed and completely blows the match/round. Attackers are fighting the clock, defenders are not. Keep them out and at bay, make them come to you, stop going to them.
---
The layout doesn't allow for such changes. It might look easy on paper, but it has to be redesigned, re-rendered and recoded, which, A, requires a LOT of resources that could be used elsewhere, and B, can might as well done to create a whole new map.
---
It's not possible. So the simplest, and more widely accepted thing to do was to take it out of ranked.
---
This is from Macie's FGF vid isn't it
---
That just means he’s unplaced, when you start your placements you start with 2500 elo and it’ll then decrease or increase as he does his placements. He could be a much higher rank but still start in your rank.
---
You also had to buy your scope.
---
Ela is not thicc, its merely the leggings that give her that appearance
---
He’s grand slam master on the decks. Akin to mix master mike from the beastie boys. Trouble is... he takes at least a g of mdma in one bomb and well shit... look at him... mashed potats
---
Did you make this op?
---
Wearing chain mail over your face doesn’t obscure your vision that greatly because your pupils are about the same size as a couple of rings
---
Ubisoft should make matchmaking actually good, i got ranked in bronze 1 this season ( i usually get placed in gold 3-2) because all my teammates were terrible, ubisoft should use the ingame stats like kills and deaths from previous matches to put them with people  just like them, im tired of people going “0-4” and me having to go “8- 3”. Not to mention matchmaking should also take into account if people leave games often too because almost all my placement matches we had a teammate who left mid game.
---
Pure luck tbh
---
Done!
---
Hahahaha, I’m still waiting for my money, and there excuse of “we can’t tell who has it or not” doesn’t work because they gave us refunds for bandit, jagger and smg11 acogs.
---
Her elite's gonna be a thong
---
Why don’t you just try it?
---
The unranked is not who he's talking about it's the enemy team they have a plat 3, silver 1, 2 gold 4s and a copper or bronze 1.
---
I dont see this buff necessary, thou it might bring in some new interesting tactics. Smoke is in good place right now, and his biggest strength is burning attackers time by pacing the usage of his toxic babes, thus covering one important area like laundry stairs at Oregon for a longer time. Using them all in one big swoop would most of the time just be a waste of utility.
---
Never heard of that player, most likely just a self called G2 player. Definitely not a R6 pro

Holo is the way to go for all weapons, good for mid to mid-long ranges and works fine in close quarters
---
well ,the bundle packs were a thing with the old system of renown for operator unlock so maybe they are not coming back ,because previously you would get all 8 for half the credits if im not mistaken ,but now the 2 that came first in a year are not worth the same as the last 2,and if you wait one more  season all the operators cost less,so i am afraid you have to grind
---
hart times
---
i spent more on the attachments than i did ops
---
i kinda want a refund lol
---
I got one of those once and then I got my first legendary for getting it!
---
...and a Blitz coming right up
---
I have grotten one legendary Alpha pack on pc and of was the unicorn charm... I fucking love it.
---
And your dead teammates initiate vote kick for lulz
---
"oi fuck this, lets go grab few beers"
---
I dont care about looks, i think gadgets should be realistic. They have been getting more unrealistic as the game goes on, probably because they are out of options or ideas
---
He does have the SMG-12 as a secondary, while I agree it's not great for range it does have the damage and fire rate to back up, so I suppose a shotty + SMG combo wouldn't be unusual to see.
---
Yes I did ! &lt;3
---
Regardless of gadgets the sheer number of ops on defense would mean attack would have a very hard time even getting close to the building without being peeked. As soon as you can basically spawn peak every line on every angle then the game sort of falls over a bit.
---
This is ridiculous criticism... You can quite clearly see that the Bitumen uniform has *dark ash* sleeves, and the Reinforced uniforms sleeves are a *smokey white* at best. *^(/s)*
---
I remember feeling accomplished and happy once I bought every attachment for every operator at the time. 
---
Then like a week later the made all of them free :(
---
Cause you need two people to try it
---
Your name is a lie
---
if you bothered to use the search function you’d know there’s literally nothing they can do about DDOS and MnK. they’re both things Microsoft and Sony have to fix.
---
I'm in the same boat as you, I got it for no reason too.
---
I'm not. Fuze's usefulness drops harshly if he's forced to use his gadget horizontally. He becomes limited to barricades and any non reinforced wall the Defenders left for him. And most of the time nothing important is placed there (traps don't really count, since they're typically droned out and dealt with before/during entry), nor will anyone be there for a kill. 
---
If the barricade isn't a Castle barricade, shutting down a Cluster Charge is easy; the placement's loud, and Fuze is loud. The Cluster Charge has a huge spike that isn't hard to aim at, therefore shutting it down with only one-two charges going off. Jager is a typical pick on Defense due to being the only Operator able to destroy grenades, and hence counters Fuze well, especially if reacted to correctly.
---
He's a Speed 1, where speed is the best defense, especially on Attack. His gadget is highly dependant on site, and how open Defenders leave their weaknesses open if they can be Fuzed from above. His saving graces are his guns are all good, and he can take a shield. 
---
He's been in need of a rework for a while, just to try and not let him become the Attacking version of Tachanka.
---
Objectively, the F2 isn't the best gun in the game. The AK-12 for Fuze is either the fastest rifle to kill with against a certain armour rating, or within 38 miliseconds (two server update ticks) from the top *at worst.* Or to put it another way: it's almost always one of the three fastest killing ARs in the game against all armour types bar one. It has the best DPS out of all the ARs, best single shot damage, and third fastest ROF. 
---
There's not much the F2 has over the AK-12 in a gun to gun comparison. It has better horizontal recoil, but worse vertical. Both are fixable through attachments for the guns. The AK-12 has access to an angled grip, making it faster to ADS with. The reload times are 0.2 - 0.3 seconds apart, with the F2 having the better full and tactical reload times. But if you need to reload in a firefight you're usually losing anyways. The only real thing the F2 has over the AK-12 is the insane ROF, and the better ACOG.
---
On Twitch herself, the better anti-gadget Operator is Thatcher. He doesn't need to take himself out of the fight, Can get multiple gadgets at once , doesn't need to find the cloaked ones to do anything about them, is hard to stop versus just shooting a drone, his AR-33 is middle of the pack across all the TTKs, and the L85A2 is very controllable, if meh at killing through bodyshots. The Shock Drone is better for Black Mirrors and Evil Eyes, yes. But destroying either requires the Shock Drone to not be seen or countered effectively, which Mozzie has made so.
---
IQ's the weakest of the three anti-gadget Operators, but she's fantastic at finding the various easy to hide intel gadgets Defenders have access to, as well as hunting Pulse and Vigil. All of her guns are meh in terms of TTK, but will at least typically beat out most SMGs of the Defenders. Her biggest strength is she's a Speed 3 and small model.
---
Hibana was considered the strongest Attacker at one point due to her gadget being safer to use than Thermite's, her Type-89 keeping up well with the AK-12 in terms of TTK, having access to the Bearing-9 which combined meant she had (and still does have, if nerfed a bit) *great* fragging potential, had a claymore to cover her flank, and was Speed 3. And frankly if you're using her gadget, you're bringing an anti-gadget regardless.
---
In theory, Twitch counters most of the electronic gadgets, in practice... eeeeeeh. Shooting a Yokai off the ceiling requires you to fully understand the maximum angle the Shock Drone can shoot at, and even then sometimes you still won't be able to hit it. Similar thing can be said about Black Eyes. The remote triggered gadgets typically aren't used in such a way that the Shock drone can counter, but Thatcher can (throw in anticipation of a Nitro Cell, for instance). Mute Jammers and PESTs require a dance to avoid and get in position to kill, otherwise dead drone. You require a specific angle to shoot a bulletproof camera, and an Evil Eye can be taken care of by simply making it look up on deployment. And on Mozzie specifically, this'll be a short one: if drones are avoiding your traps, then you're frankly doing your job. Dorms on Oregon is shut down intel wise without the Attackers at least giving you something in return. I could go on but pretending the Shock Drone is this all purpose win button when typically it's dealt with before major damage is done is absurd.
---
Most of the time, I'd prefer a Thatcher to a Twitch if I'm the hard breacher. If I want to counter Defense's intel gathering, I'd want IQ over her. If going pure solo I'd take a Maverick, who I could argue is currently the best Operator in the game; 3 Speed, hugely versatile, can bypass entry denial on reinforced walls and hatches, great gun, claymore, can destroy every gadget in some fashion easily. 
---
But again with ***all of the above***, I'm still not saying the F2 or Twitch doesn't need tweaked. The ROF on the F2 means that misses don't matter as much in the race to kill, or means more lead down range for that headshot. 
---
TL;DR: Can prove through Rogue 9's damage weapon spreadsheet that the F2 isn't the best gun in the game. Can make the argument that Twitch isn't the best Attacker int the game. Don't disagree that the F2 could use some tweaks however.
---
Generally i play 60 fps but 45-50 fps is normal for me :')

I'm pretty sure they can't do that, if two operators have the same gun, if you edit it for one it'll edit for the other

also, it probably comes again, you could also try typing 'ipconfig/flushdns' into the command prompt. that way u maybe dont need to close the game

if you were educated enough you’d know that as soon as Ubisoft added something to detect then, the Xim company would release a patch that makes them undetectable again. you still don’t know what you’re talking about even though you like to think you do

They honestly can't do much more about it. XIM works by mimicking a DS4 Controller I believe so, to the PS4, It's no different than normal.

The same can be said about the DDOS-ers. That's just taking advantage of network and computer knowledge to interrupt someone else's service. It's illegal, but not too much can be done about it by Ubi.

Yeah, I know, I am constantly in matches with plats. A lot of them are try hards, but some that I have met have just wanted to have fun because they were tired of tryharding in Ranked.
---
It's all about those shoes
---
Games toxic I’m annoyed by people that can’t read the same sentence worded more specifically three times. Internet is toxic if he can’t handle some simple truth as to his illiteracy then maybe he should avoid talking to others on the internet.
---
both good points, i just say it because th concept seems so rational that i kinda triggers that it isnt like i said,just the logic
---
Well they turned Kafe from a B tier map to a C tier map.
---
Fucking hell! You have no idea what you're talking about. Literally no idea how things work.
---
I’m level 325, I’ve maybe received 6 legendary ever.
---
I have bought more than 100 packs by now. Never ever received one via winning an AP.
---
Gonna give them hell and then some
---
Looks great!
---
Slightly darker black turtle neck.
---
It's way way better than the old attack favoured mess on bomb
---
The only difference I see is the uncommons neck guard and shoulder pad look a little darker
---
I am currently using R6Tab.com (shoutouts) &lt;3
---
However I will switch to my own servers if the userbase increases. Did not need agreement from Ubisoft, just some programming knowledge :)
---
I still don't understand why they didn't make the other option as the default.. Ubisoft is not very smart
---
I was talking about the whole building a PC for $500 dollars thing...
---
I'm a *hackerman*
---
only when youre using an aimbot, if youre only using macro you have no reference on where to aim cuz shots go above your crosshair
---
if you bother enough to find out where to aim you probably had enough time to learn the recoil itself
---
I once got 2 consecutive legendary alpha packs and they were both the alpha pack charm. I was so mad i didn’t play for almost a month.
---
IQ could turn invisible using a claymore and (I'm assuming you don't know) some Operators could put a deployable shield in front of their face with another glitch.
---
I'm not sure what you're implying. Original comment "Castle probably locked them in. lol" just sounds to me like the enemy team was forced to stay there to begin with.
---
I'm looking this from "why they're all there" point of view.
---
Uh its the shoes. They make you run .00000002% faster.
---
I'm level 180 and haven't gotten fucking one so yeah you're not that unlucky ;-;
---
I knew about the deployable but not claymore
---
I think you need to avoid talking to others on the internet   You obviously can't keep a polite conversation without spewing insults here and there.  That type of behavior would get you banned on Rainbow Six Siege, you know? ;)
---
Most of Monty’s uniform differences don’t come from the armor but rather the clothing underneath
---
They closed up like 60% of windows. Also before you could just play secure. The thing is, my least favorite maps are new Hereford, fortress, Outback, and now new Kafe. And now I have to play bomb, which if you’re solo queuing like me is a total disaster and unfun.
---
Ah okay thank you very much. Hope everything goes well. Can you add like map blueprints as well. There isn’t an app for that yet.
---
you can clearly see the difference. the shoes on the right is darker! seems reasonable
---
The epic bullet vest is bumpy but less
---
If you don’t like someone block them. Ride behavior doesn’t get you banned. I’ve been teamkilled numerous times to prove that point. This is not my first rodeo.
---
When I first started, I had a lot of luck with packs. The legendary Hot Rod Skin for thermite's 556XI and my second was Black Ice for the AK-12. Now, I have terrible luck with packs.
---
No, I think it is you who are mistaken. What I specifically said is "Universal mouse and keyboard" and by that all console players will openly be allowed to utilise the any mouse and keyboard device without obtaining the Xim product. This will overall make the console player-base an even playing ground for competitive.
---
Oh. So that's why you liked old Kafe.
---
Thankfully I always played bomb only. So I am happy about the changes
---
Year 4
---
I love mute, he’s my main. For me he’s just easier to use because his gun is better imo and he is good at truly denying entry to obj whereas smoke delays entry of attacker.
---
Niceeeee stealing other people’s original ideas my dude
---
Most of your answers will probably be the same and its gonna have to wait until new season for all patches to come through
---
Both are good, it depends on your play style. If your gonna get yourself killed right away, use mute. If your gonna be alive in the last 30 seconds of a round use smoke.
---
Alibi clones don't affect defenders
---
My favorite are the terrorists who decide they want to be somewhere, and then aggressively rubberband-run there at above normal sprint speed while still being able to shoot at the same time. Bonus points if they do it while crouched.
---
You should try them both and see which one you enjoy more. They're completely different operators with completely different roles. If weapons are what matter to you, Mute's primary SMG is better than Smoke's. Their gadgets can't be compared, though.
---
Unfortunately your right
---
Don't be that mean to Clash, be mean to people that have done this :(
---
risky clicks
---
I bet Cav is into some freaky shit in the bedroom
---
Sledge and Mute, sledges elite is one of the top elites in the game and Kapkans is weak imo
---
You’re paying the difference for his eyes to be open I think
---
Lol
---
I’ve gotten my question answered and this was unnecessary
---
Last time no one answered
---
The shoes.
---
Then use the search bar like a normal person
---
Then how about you start giving some good responses back  , you have only been responding by calling me names , ignoring all the points I've been making.
---
Back in my day we had to pay for our Attachments!!!! damn kids thinking everything is free!
---
?
---
Thank you very much!
---
Consider leaving a rating on the store if you like it :)
---
They have a wheel of fortune at the office thats how they are so random.. 
---
welcome to Ubisoft, The place for all your gambling needs!
---
How does it translate to watching you? 
---
I believe it, but I’m a little confused.
---
&gt;Obligatory "To shreds, you say?"
---
Ubi Please fix the matchmaking seriously guys
---
Sony &amp; Microsoft licensed one, fortnite used it, people with elite controllers got banned for it, xim put out an update in about 4 hours and they continued to work as normal. 
---
That’s the problem is it’s way more complex then people think. The entire point of a xim is it fools your console into thinking your MnK inputs look like a controller. And even when they find a way to detect it, xim can very quickly provide another update
---
Get the epic, it's cheaper ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
should've shot the impact
---
I do believe it was at one point, yes.
---
Ah yes, general Reposti!
---
How much health did he have after?
---
Its year 4 and suddenly the F2 is considered OP and needs the acog removed? Ok...
---
Is there a reason to play these situation things? I thought they were just game mechanic introductions.
---

People use that to say the n in the n word. And that's literally the only way it was used so it was banned.

---
my main is being dissed, i've never had a problem with her elite i think IMO that it looks good as they are meant to show off who they are or their past both lesion and her elite look good
---
Ah thanks spooky

Happy cake day

U get them for free and 1 week early before others

Can't you spot the EPICNESS of the second outfit?

week and a half

I'm on my phone so could be wrong but it looks like you shot just above his head.

I like pencils
---
Yes. It will get fixed before the official rollout. It’s a “simple” fix
---
Thanks!
---
I was gonna say "back when people knew nothing" because of the UI. 
---
Then I saw coastline. It has to be at least year 2.
---
There is no excuse for this.
---
That’s not camping. You could literally go to objective and get an easy win yet you pushed a guy holding an angle who wiped you out. Sounds like someone has never played against plat players before. You’re mad because you pushed someone you didn’t have to and died what a damn joke.
---
Valk and finka or doc

As I said just give it a good 12 hours before you can truly enjoy the game

If you to the Subreddit page and click user flair. Go to the top right and click edit and then type in this :Jackal: :Bandit: :Zofia: :Frost: .But obviously change the names to who you want.

There's only 280 charms in the game but ok
---
All I heard is defender cams are now blue
---
Thanks man
---
NP
---
I want it so bad
---
I’m not the one who made a post about people trying too hard to win. Get on with your life and play a different game that isn’t an esports title made to be competitive.

Lion and finka. They are literally trained for this, its their job

depends on how many you have in total, it's different for everyone

Who are the 3 year 2 ops in bottom right

Oh ok

Bingo
---
Didnt played in over a year and a half( since white noise), yesterday a mate toldme to try again r6. So we joined a match and the other team was using blitz, dokkaebi, monty, lion, jackal, that was the firts and last match we played hahaha.
---
Looks like the op that will climb through hatches :)
---
yeah for me it shows about 350 in total
---
What is your sensitivity and dpi?
---
If you haven’t noticed already buddy, there is no multiplayer game out there that is popular and non competitive

well how much elo?
---
Literally unplayable

This is how their gonna nerf her if she gets too OP

Defenders are blue offense is yellow and if you are nokk and have you’re ability on cameras are white I’m not sure about hacked cams with dokkabi though
---
Def cams are blue and atk cams are orange/yellowish all u have to know
---
Then why are you crying?
---
Is that a show of some sort? That cracked me up.
---
Dude I loved the alpha version you some of us try I love the updated one as well!
---
Ur getting flexed on my dude
---
I feel stupid, i can't tell them apart..
---
Yes it is!
---
Uncommon has a lighter patch on the left of his chest. That’s the only thing different that I could find.
---
I mean if you’re paying for online, using an inferior interface (a controller), and only getting 30 FPS all for $500, while trying to take the game seriously, youre not exactly smart..
---
IQ has a great elite skin fite me.
---
I'm about 1790(?) If I remember it properly.
---
Yeah black ice was unique, I have a bronze one
---
i’m just saying, it could be for everyone, i really don’t care, i just don’t feel like spending another 50k  on some recycled ass ops, they bring nothing unique to the table

green recruit and the lord

The recruits had different icons during the Outbreak event

Is it actually an ar50? Damn I feel stupid

Red dead and GTA both have sweaty online modes. Battlefield isn’t sweaty per say but there are some no life’s that roam that game

Hello Skyeboy2, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bswmqw/is_anyone_else_having_a_glitch_when_they_play_echo/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
And Attackers is now orange
---
hager’s the most useful operator jackals just an annoying faggot
---
As far as I can tell, it's like this: currently in game, all cameras shine red when they're in use (other than valk cams) - this includes attackers drones, defenders using map cameras and placeable bulletproof cameras etc.
---
With this new update, the red lights are being changed to blue for defenders and yellow for attackers - as in, defender-used map cameras will now shine blue instead of red and attackers on drones will shine yellow instead of red.
---
(I think).
---
Yes! When he said "meme worthy" I took the print
---
how are you gonna defend ubisofts lazy habits
---
Sounds like somebody doesn’t know how to counter an operator
---
I'll let you know in 3 months time
---
Siege is 60 FPS 60 Hz on console dude. Controller comes with a console and older consoles are traded in for usually $150 at most places during buy back sales. Game is taken seriously as there used to be an Xbox pro league when Siege started. Honestly grow up you dudes live under some 1990 rock where the pc master race seems to be well and alive. The playerbase is largest on console might I add.

You're over thinking it way too much.

It would work the same as the marco.
---
So you’re saying a open world online third person shooter with auto aim is sweaty competitive gaming. You’re the most retarded dude I’ve met yet on Reddit.

woow wut, how did you get the objective thing and ping to be blue? did they add color blind options to rainbow?

I remember the good ole days of starting casual and think Fuze was god. Good times.

Can i just ask what rank you are
---
I hate the same message yesterday anyhow. I just loaded up the game and tried to join my friend and it says that I was in a ranked game. So I tried solo queue to rejoin but it just put me in a fresh game. However I didn't incur any penalties
---
I WILL KILL YOU
---
Yeah, but that weapon excels at extremely short ranges, not really counter push. 
---
I have no beef with the weapon because if someone is rushing you specifically you can at least switch to that.
---
But the Ts are perpetually ADS?
---
Lol I’m on mobile.
---
Yeah, I’m probably the only person that chooses the 417. I just really hate how much of the screen the F2 takes up, despite how amazing it is.

no u

For me, menu and lobby always fell to 60 or less when in game I have 135+.  Yours does seem low for the lobby but I assumed it was normal because it drops for me.

then gtfo

Heck yeah, I love when nitro cells have a blast radius that covers the whole map!

Ubisoft nerfs their developers too. Or worse they even fool their developers.
---
mav&gt;thermite and hibana and thats a fact
---
Yeah lol
---
welcome to ubisoft
---
Valk and Castle
---
Ranked does matter to an extent. If you’re a true plat going up against plat strats you’d know not to push an enemy off objective holding an angle. If OP thinks that’s camping and died to that situation he’s obviously not a great siege player nor does he understand that siege is about teamplay and winning. I guess you also think a guy not on objective is camping don’t ya.
---
Just Ubisoft
---
Alternative title: The True People's Elbow
---
quit with these moronic subjective lists. this one is clearly wrong and you must know that. this list might be one of the worst ones posted here
---
FYI according to the other responses rank seems to matter as they only complain about plat and diamond ranks in casual cheesing them.
---
😂
---
My teammate was quicker and took us out before I did the screenshot :/
---
You missed a lot, you might want to look up the changes because there are a ton since villa

Try buying it from xbox/PS4 store depending on what console you’re on (or pc). That might work

Simple, the uncommon uniform is obviously the most superior in terms of style and looks compared to the epic one.

If you activate Finka's boost as you get downed, you can revive yourself.

Not really, he can't make as much space as them and a bad mav can eate his entire ammo on one hatch

And they couldn't possibly have a smaller coding crew, since more art means more coders and programmers required to make sure that art is implemented and maintained.
---
Ronni is better for roaming and if you have decent headshot instincts, Commando is generally better for anchoring and if you tend to go for body shots. Don’t let the fire rate fool you though, the Commando has a quicker time-to-kill in almost all engagement ranges, even under ten meters
---
.
---
And Ubisoft says it takes roughly one hour to get 1000 Renown from Multiplayer. Terrorist Hunt is faster. But it's still way too long.

He may win a lot but his skill is still bronze lmao.

3.5 cause playing with low ranks, and w/l doesn't matter because leaving games doesn't count as a loss on the stats
---
But as a defender you don’t get detected if you shoot an alibi prisma.
---
At first how can different versions of the same outline make something more remarkable?
---
Yes black ice looks good but there is only black ice and no other skin with this hype potential because black ice is the only one available.
---
Weapon skins won't be a direct disadvantage but making something even more colorful and shiny is just annoying and distracts the player.
---
That's pretty simple because most skins ubi does don't require work so they can do useful stuff. The game should be made for the people who play it competitive and because of this only they shouldn't start recreating the skin wave a cod has. Skins are a nice extra and not the main focus. They can be something u desire but nothing ur rly playing for. U must compare it to cs go where the skin is nice but Noone cares at the end of the day.

Nice App OP! Just thought I'd let you know some of Nokks Gadget Description is in Wardens profile
---
Yeah 6'2 198lb
---
Use henna. It would look realistic
---
People don't understand the concept of "reusing guns", do they?
---
Ubi would do what you did in 3 minutes, so here's a better explanation on what REALLY lead to old guns:
---
Female Vigil was SUPPOSED to have an AR, and one of the more well known ones, but she turned out too powerful and utilitarian in testing so they swapped it out for a weak but balanced SMG. (Revealed by some pro or steamer, I can't recollect)
---
Warden was in the same boat.
---
Added to that, they have "data limits", and knowing how old this game's engine is, that shouldn't come as a surprise. (Revealed by  pro)
---
A third point to add is that you can't always get gun licenses that easily, and you can't find guns to implement in games that don't have licenses. So reusing old ones wouldn't cause unnecessary delays.
---
They have enough resources to do contless Google searches. They just don't have the means to implement your "dream weapons" at all times.
---
I love the appp but can you make a random operator page that would be nice
---
Right? XD
---
what would someone here know that google couldn’t tell you.
---
Classic r6
---
Dude he’s OBVIOUSLY the best.
---
If you have Ralphine skin you qualify for a veteran discount
---
Blitz bring the shield. We don't know If this is a prisma or a real person.
---
That would look nice when her gadget was active
---
The shoes are nicer in the epic
---
since i have this account just made today, i had a friend of mine a few month ago post my other Wallpapers i made but i somehow forgot clash. ive made a mediafire folder with all of my other wallpapers, im just not quite sure if im allowed to post a link there on this subreddit.

Testing
---
E: hehehehe
---
Same

Whichever pleases you the most.
---
Don't overcomplicate.
---
I was disappointed in the legion legendary when I got it but it isn't a bad headgear, it's just that its classified as a legendary.
---
these posts are so annoying. they did not “run out of gun ideas.” and if you think that then it shows your lack of knowledge on the game. making these posts won’t change anything so quit.
---
Well that's the issue, things aren't being implemented well, and are not being maintained well at all.
---
Are they afected by the real life physics?  
---
If not then i'll take castle and valky... If yes then i'll take Finka And Castle...   
---
My plan is to stay there a good time...
---
Wow, that's interesting, your logic makes sense to me, I just hope this post gets enough attention and you will receive credit for this, because people often just skip posts that link to other websites
---
I can't even get the evil eye set up to begin with..
---
LOL
---
Literally go to the universal tab you can just buy it
---
That could be said about any question here, or any question anywhere. There's always going to be a different place that you could've gone to gain  information, that doesn't change that fact that this is still one of those sources to get that information. I chose this one.
---
This^ i dont think glock gives put licences to use in their games. But people think you can just add it in super quick.
---
Maybe that would help with my insecurities...
---
Wait, i saw this word combination somewhere before
---
Lmao the actors are all in line waiting for a piss, not realizing they missed the cue for the intro.
---
Appreciate it.
---
wait if the ai isn't updated, do they run into walls?
---
In my mind both these things are pretty much tied.
---
Just add a limit to how long you can stalemate in obj, simple as that. Secure does not need to be pulled from ranked. It offers a lot of variety and the only people who like this change are the sweaty bomb neanderthals who wanna be pros sooo bad
---
Terrorists; aiming down sights
---
I mean he has arguably the best defender gun
---
Doc and Monty
---
I feel that
---
E
---
&gt;Also it's one of the most underrated guns in the game. 
---
Seriously, who's rating these guns? I want to headshot that dude with a deagle.
---
Not sure about desktop but on mobile you need to go to the main page of the Rainbow6 subreddit . When you're there you need to press the three dots in the top right corner. One of the options will be change user flair. Just go in there and it's pretty simple to change it.
---
If u mean flair and you use mobile just go to subreddit and click the upper right corner from there to flairs
---
It facilitates two completely different headgear you ungrateful wretch.
---
I dont get it, i only ever use bandit irons. You can basically see the whole map.
---
ping doesnt cause glitchs
---
They’ve been searching for it for a very long time and that was an expensive journey
---
So a 30 minute ban seems appropriate to you for what I think is a blatant oversight.
---
If they want to ban an Israeli operator because they’re Israeli, fuck em. 
---
While the defends gadget is a real tool and an interesting idea I do see the problem of dying to something you can’t see. By the same token you can die to glaz shooting through smoke, or to fuze charge, or to maverick with a silencer, or to a perfectly cooked grenade, or to a Mira with a good setup, or to a pixel peak. There’s plenty of things that kill you without you having a chance to fight back
---
Loving kafe and nøkk so far.
---
Send the footage to Ubi
---
He's been nerfed significantly already.
---
He doesn't need changes.
---
Then Ubisoft doesn’t offer the DLC for those Middle East countries or whatever if they ban it then they ban it. 
---
You can’t do damage to someone if they throw C4 around the corner and blow it up instantly killing you.
---
He didnt read the patch notes.
---
the ump has the worse dps

Ubi go home, you are drunk

&gt; but when finding out bomb was going to be the ranked exclusive game mode, I decided not to fight the change because the game is balanced/centered around this game mode, 
---
See now this right here is pure maturity and understanding the circumstances. Something a lot of people in this sub are lacking in.
---
Hats off to you, sir.
---
it is good content. and you didn’t have to pay money to get the new operators. you chose to. they don’t have to give content for free. you sound very entitled and it’s a bit sad. they chose to use balanced weapons for the new operators. get over it
---
And yet it has no recoil. Aim, Nibba, AIM!!
---
I disagree completely. Situational or not, seeing through smoke and being immune to flashes is pretty good. With the amount of times people use smoke to cover a plant, or flash before entering a room, Warden's utility will see plenty of use. 
---
You could also argue that most operators have utility that is situational. Jaeger's is useless if they don't use any kind of grenade for example.
---
...what?
---
It's too early to tell, but have thought about this as well.  One idea I had was an ability to see the red lasers on claymores more distinctly. I like your idea about concussion effects, but that affects senses beyond just the eyes so I don't know if the glasses would technically make sense.
---
Guess we'll wait and see.
---
Question, what about people who actually have to use the acog, my pc is shit so I have to play on 50% render scaling, I need the damn acog to actually see.
---
Nah they're just experimenting.
---
Supressor will always be extremely situational.
---
How did you make this??
---
No.
---
NOT the smg11. It USED to be the alda, but they fixed that.
---
Now no gun has improved recoil with supressor.
---
thank you captain obvious. but returning or new players dont have their sensitivity on lock and cant hit headshots
---
The uncommon is more than the epic
---
Why just post a spawn peek? Nothin special
---
Mr. Magoo
---
it’s a short animation about thatcher and dokkaebi that ubi released on ytube
---
I actually need the "crutch" of an acog, I gotta play on 50% render scaling cause my pc is shit so I gotta play @ 50% render scale, what about people like me who need the extra zoom?
---
The only reused weapon in BH really was the M249 but even that came with the change to a magazine and the release of a new scope. And on top of that they reduced the overall filesize of the game across all platforms during BH which should alott them more space to work with
---
Needs green.
---
I am not a pewdiepie fan, what's significant about this
---
Is that recent? I've never saw that
---
whats the fix?
---
I member spending over 3k on attachments and the next day they're all free
---
A: use the shotgun. B: I said FBI. Ash is literally the easiest operator in the game.
---

Uses 5 bullets on lmg, RELOADING COVER ME

the elite sets are the 1%

A+
---
Guess I should've clarified haha, Pewdiepie has a gaming chair for sale that's $399, and it's been a running joke among his community for some time now. Thought that Lesion might be promoting him, lol.
---
Ubi is a company, they want to make money. The middle east is a huge source of revenue for them. The only one of those thats actually not possible to do anything about is Glaz, whos also the only one of those thats getting reworked. You can prefire a Mira, push someone throwing a nade, shoot back to a pixel peak, see the wall being opened by Mav. That defender would instantly cut off an area.
---
I love to do this when I’m maestro and I have 180 shoot at an enemy then have 179 rounds left just to do the 1 million year reload
---
Thats so awesome, didn't know you could do that
---
Thanks, going to try it
---
Thank you! Maybe I will repost it some time. If you enjoy it, consider taking time for a rating on the store!
---
They could always make her barefoot like Lara Croft in Tomb Raider: Legend. I forgot if it was story mission 2 or 3 but still badass.
---
Thatchers and IQs are both solid if you’re totally against war themes
---
That's basically what I did. Just constant lonewolf-ing, used doc and hammered them out. 
---
There's not too much else you can do, because it isn't about skill or technique really, just about doing it over, and over, and over again.
---
You could try to do it with randoms, but that's usually just a shit show with someone blowing up the hostage at the end.
---
Yes. One of my hobbys.
---
Was the music edited in or did you sync it up. I know your mate reacted to it in the clip but theres no way I can believe cap won and synced it perfectly with the music
---
No but an unstable connection does.
---
before and during op health, getting close to players could raise your ping. you never really saw alot of successful knives, during that season
---
I downloaded it, used it, dude you did a fantastic job, holy cow!
---
one is beige the other is gray.....so your point is ? most costumes are repaint, its the masks that are different
---
Yeah its really boring, especially that i rarely play any thunt at all
---
uhhh. idk if that deserves a woosh or a explanation
---
u/CoreRoss did 4 hours before you lol.
---
But he just said he's blitz
---
Lion and finka, they were made for a zzombje apocalypse right?
---
If you pay attention you won’t get flanked, claymores weren’t always in this game, they are a crutch
---
It came out during the Invitational this year
---
you said op skin, so im going off that. valk has a full white skin, from halloween 2018
---
Tbh I TKed when making a face on it with bullets
---
the holograms probably won't have attachments on the gun even if the operator does so if they try this it might give them away? I'm just guessing never played her

Love it. I have been thinking there needs to be some Indian operators too. And I've heard ideas for a vertical movement style op for a long time too. Like the weapon choices too. Original and good change of pace. Though I don't quite see how Valk would counter him? Just as being an info gatherer?
---
Also, could he use his Panja on destructible or indestructible ceilings? Only one or both?
---
I think flashbangs are a good fit without being OP like a breach charge may be. I'd even consider giving him frags as a quasi-IQ counter gadget. He could rappel up to a ceiling beside a reinforcement that has a soft wall above it and toss frags in more easily.
---
Unfortunately I see some issues with trying to actually implement his mechanics (on the Dev side of things).
---
You're fucking pathetic.
---
Lord and saviour and Castle
---
Reason:
---
Tachunky got that DP-28
---
Castle can keep windows barricaded
---
I guessed it from the CBRN Threat Unit who cost 18.000, so I thought that because there is one season in between those the G.I.S ops would cost 18.000 as well. I thought there were certain grades of what ops cost. Lowest I know next to the base game ops is the JTF2 for 9000, the all the other year 1 ops for 13.500. I don’t know about the Spanish ops because I already owned them before the new prices, then up to CBRN they cost 18.000, and all the ops to SASR cost 25.000
---
I’m not sure about any of this tho
---
diamond xbox, deadzones 5, ads 38, sensitivity 48 x and y
---
Caveira Elite maybe... She has a very interesting backstory you know...
---
Louisville Kentucky
---
Wait Thats Illegal
---
They never said it themselves. They'll never do it whether your pathetic head can accept it or not. So stop being a laughing stock and go play in PL if you want. Don't let people hear you saying ranked is PL.
---
Yeah.. me too buddy. Me too. :(
---
The vector is beautiful!! Good job
---
thank you so much
---
Vantage points, move between bombs faster, etc.
---
kk bronze lmao have fun playing favela in casual
---
It’s so teammates can transition themselves faster between the two objectives, it also makes it easier to look for the refuser when it’s planted because it creates an extra entrance the attackers possibly can’t cover
---
I never play casual.

Maybe a Magpul PDR perhaps?

Are there Major ones that you think improved the Experience?
---
You mean... literally? Please, say no... ;__;
---
How would I do that?
---
Yep
---
The weapon she needs
---
Not that foldable submachine gun that is designed for the secret service
---
Literally
---
Load out is up to you, and generally you should place your gadgets near where they are pushing. Another tip is placing your gadgets in a way so it is out of the line of sight of attackers when they push a doorway

Alvin gets gunned down in the road chip

Doesn't work for competitive.
---
Your forgetting about staircases. Players start seeing red when a drone pings them, they don’t look around or see their teammates, so when a drone jumps down a staircase, they immediately fire. I’ve seen it happen a few times.
---
I agree. I hope it’s not a trend. Don’t mind the occasional cross over weapon but we always need a new weapon. 
---
Do it like Finka and Lion whereby they have a new weapon each but reused weapons for the rest (they can mix and match)
---
I think revealing who her parents are kinda defeats the whole “redacted” theme she’s got going on
---
2 Maps + 1 random map. Wouldn't be so bad imo
---
it's fine
---
Oh okay, I didn't know that. Thanks for informing me though
---
Rotation holes, lines of sight, long angles, foot level holes for plant denial, holes in the floor/ceiling for more angles, holes for impact tricking, holes for nitro cells, etc. 
---
Watch a pro team some time, they swiss cheese bomb sites during prep.

PEDOPHILE

I’m not talking about tts and season. They do that every season, so it’s expected. I’m talking about things such as clash (like I mentioned) where it took them days to respond to us and they told us how they were fixing it. That’s fine, but in addition you should tweet out something that at least let’s us know you are working on a solution in addition to the solution itself
---
That only works for Thunt
---
Can you share this to r/casualuk ? They will love it on there
---
Agreed
---
Kinda want to see a movie of all the ones listed here working together to try and survive and find a cure against the zombies while using their own specific gadgets against zombies or to help the team
---
They could have made a new smg... I sort of see your point but I think there’s no excuse for someone with a such a boring ability like warden to not have a new gun.
---
That’s the point of ranked. If you wanna get elo you need teammates or your gonna get stomped, if you don’t have any play causal or live in the lower ranks.

I had the exact same thing happen to me recently.  We were on Kanal, on the rooftop of the coast guard building, shooting into the windows of the control room.  I had been taking pot shots at a Doc, and so had one of my teammates.  He disappeared from view and after a few seconds I looked to the right into another window, and I saw him just standing there, not moving, so I very carefully took aim and shot him in the face, blood spattered the wall behind him, and he didn't move, so I assumed it was a body-and yes, I've had several instances of standing bodies.  However, when the round was dwindling down and it became a 2v4, I quickly realized that the Doc that I had shot in the face was, in fact, still alive and well.
---
This comment deserves a lot more upvotes lol
---
Zofia has great utility for pushing in the building, and clearing rooms/getting positions because her stun grenades are proximity. Ying is good for site takes because of the strong flashes. Zofia is less niche, and overall a better choice for utility.
---
You already have stats like this in game, right? I don't need more pollution in the loot pool, and I'd rather the devs spend time on meaningful improvements to the game engine.
---
Wow no shit sherlock
---
I was thinking of that too😂
---
Googling your problem and finding the answer quickly&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;making a reddit post asking a question because you’re lazy
---
I just use it because it instils a false sense of tacticalness to my mindless spraying with the SMG 12 or P90
---
Umm, it's called situational awareness.
---
I imagine it's either to help the other team in acting like a real situation, or for Hostage, it could be a senario where they have a VIP like a US President or Ambassador, and they have to hold down the fort while back up arrives or clear the area to make it safe for evacuation. As for bomb it's kind of the same thing. There's a place they need to destroy, perhaps like a terrorist hide out, and they're protecting the bombs so they can detonate and destroy the building.
---
God damn it the flair is amazing.
---
Well, i took the print, and wrote something that I thought people would relate

The bosak family makes many sense but it's just a theory

I see what you did with the F2 there...

It’s chanka doing a salute

Same, bud, same.
---
I wish this was real
---
Artwise: it looks like you made each line with short strokes. Try to make long smooth lines instead.
---
Otherwise: nice
---
yo you must be a troll. cav, i can see not being everybody’s first pick, still, nevertheless her literal ONLY purpose is to roam. but hang on..
---
lemme get this straight.. you just said #jaeger is the worst defending op in the game?  you gonna tell me his gadget is trash too? there’s a reason that there’s not a single pro game going on without jaeger in every round. EVERY round. lmao, sorry, but you don’t have the first clue as to what you’re talking about brother
---
and i read some of the other replies, would you happen to be in copper or bronze by chance? because yes at those levels vigil is useless because nobody drones passed the prep phase, OR goes to roam.
---
Oh, whoops.
---
I'll leave it to your imagination buddy 😉👍
---
I just wish that when you scan a prisma with a drone it would get pinged like an enemy, making it less obvious which one is you.
---
You still have a chance on getting the type you don't want which can still happen if everyone else does not choose the game mode but you at least know what objective you will be playing
---
It’s a game company, they have to go through a system, there isn’t much else they can do. A delay is sadly expected.

Then don’t buy it.

Did your team message you after? That was really ballsy play good quick thinking though

I don’t mind the map, I prefer old Hereford more tho
---
They are changing ranked to be bomb only in the next season (like the sixth Invitational)

The -1 is probably a representation of null (look up null island for an explanation), the timer is probably a bit flip in the 8th bit position of the timer byte (so a computer problem?).
