This is really good. Do you still draw?
---
---
---
Its either you talk or don't.
---
Christ I didn‚Äôt know I needed the Bizon
---
That is called witch hunting so be careful
---
I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with that shit.  I was playing with this girl one time and the second she said something two random guys were like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up girl‚Äù ‚Äúyou sound hot‚Äù and shit like that.  I couldn‚Äôt imagine the garbage you have to deal with.  
---

---
And I bet at least you don‚Äôt come on mics at the end and call your teammates trash.
---
Gotta love 93R
---
  Well if you dont get it shit talking is understandable üò©
---
Lol what‚Äôs funny is did one of the earlier rounds and won the 1V3
---
it‚Äôs on the ubisoft website for dev notes y4 s3
---
Can‚Äôt
---
The colors where completly broken, then at the end off the vid my game crashed
---
The guy who took that pic died a second later
---
It happened to me and caused me to drop back to plat
---
You can create a ticket.
---
Anyone played doki doki tho...
---
I didn't know they made her gun in real life!! There is absolutely no differences!!
---
[deleted]
---
maybe don‚Äôt include thunt clips?
---
thanks &lt;3
---
How long have you had the game? Been like this since day 1 my dude
---
Hit heads
---
Operation Health II when?
---
np
---
#MUDA MUDA
---
You are wrong, it is one of the most balanced maps in the game.
---
Clash 35h Maverick 20h but maining nokk rn @ 17h
---
It‚Äôs part of the game, adapt to it.
---
They probably don‚Äôt follow csgo at all
---
also how do i get the main things
---
Too much time before the original kill. But it is nice
---
Depends on how fast your internet is
---
I love how detailed it is!
---
Actually, pulse scanners exists irl. They r used for exaample by border guards to detect ppl inside trucks
---
I think jackal should get it before mozzie or any other operator to be frank. Jackal doesnt have shit but a pro league set , they need to show him so love even if he‚Äôs the top pick for banning .
---
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER
---
Wasn't hard to top the other events, apart from Outbreak. They were either reskins, or a sweaty crouch spamfest.
---
Thanks, I really put my all into it!
---
they would have to give one to all the other year 2 and 3 operators before mozzie, I agree with u that he should get one. *BUT* others need one as well
---
This whole design is just an excuse to get more hot babes in the game. 
---
( I'm not trying to make fun of the design, hearing is crucial in Siege and an operator like this can be a huge game changer. )
---
gUyS WhErE iS nOkK StOp tAkIng pHotOs oF a WaLl
---
yes
---
How did you get that maverick main thing beside your name
---
Be cool if she had an elite where the ability played dubstep ü§£
---
That's actually a great idea!
---
Yeah, I dunno. People are weird.
---
The guy who replied to you is actually wrong, his gun is a Russian Vityaz
---
It's not stolen if you voluntarily gave it up.
---
For Christmas have 1 attacking op be dressed like Santa and everyone else be like 3 feet tall, defenders are kids defending the house while attackers are santa and his elfes
---
A golden rule my friends decided to come up with is ‚Äúwhoever uses the word cringe, are usually cringey themselves‚Äù
---
Yea I reckon embroidery would look good as.
---
I'm really interested how the gadget would work, obviously is a range gadget the closest you are better you listen, but would work as a trap, you put it at the beginning of the round and activate it when you needed or like Virgil gadget or even like the Ying candela?
---
Honestly
---
Congratulations!
---
Reported, too sexy
---
They should have only seasonal stats. They're the only relevant ones. Your all time win/loss and KD mean jack shit.
---
Right I understand the theory. However Jackal got nerfed and is definitely not overpowered. Blitz is not THAT strong, he is a good operator. Same thing with Clash. Do you think she's over powered?
---
I refuse to ever click on a Facebook link no matter what it is I am loyal redditor
---
so you're trying to tell me this is what it would be like if the defenders had Blackbeard?
---
Finally. Some good fucking operators.
---
Plat 3 and Gold 1 are practically the same so don't feel too proud
---
Not in my experience and I‚Äôve had it for a while
---
Terrorist hunt and aim for heads, I originally did this for the achievement but got allot of practice.
---
Thanks man! It definitely has been a journey, went from a solid 4 stack of pretty dedicated irl friends who would play competitively and casually, to just solo queuing and maybe joining a friend or two occasionally. Most of my irl friends disbanded after I took a hiatus because of my son being born but still play casually every once in a while.
---
McNasty and his gang are fucking hilarious if you want commedy siege
---
I can already see the NSFW posts on this operator
---
The nerf to Jackal didn't stop him from being powerful. You want to nerf Jackal properly, you nerf his range. And Echo still is the strongest intel and stun op in the game.
---
Blitz and Clash are only banned heavily in the lower ranks where teamwork and game sense are a little lacking. Its also because people find them annoying to play against.
---
Incorrect
---
No sledge shouldn't. It's bulletproof glass that's somehow stronger than a presidential plane window. A good new counter would be maverick and glaz can damage it.
---
I think it would be fun for April fool's to do a discovery casual with any casual map, but you can pick the same operator multiple times. 
---
Also would love a shooting range. One team of shooters, one team of targets finding places to hide and seek around.
---
Hahahahah that made my day.
---
Cas shouldn't have its own MMR.
---
Alternately, if you've ranked, your ranked MMR should supercede a cas MMR so casual players can enjoy the mode they prefer without being a sweatband. That way, ranked players can play however they want since it won't cost them anything.
---
I really wanna play the money heist one, But I wanna see a 2V2 event where everyone is only equipped a handgun 
---
another would be assassinate the VIP where 1 person is the VIP and the defenders must protect them and the attackers must kill them
---
Gain 10-20 seconds of our lives
---
Oh yeah for sure . He does have the best assault rifle, and I believe lesion has the best sub machine gun in the game. With that being said if you ignore the gun classes jackals gun is the best. I reckon the reason they don‚Äôt add any more content to him is for that exact reason.
---
Bruh I don‚Äôt know what kind of solo queue experiences you‚Äôve had but getting Gold while dealing with randoms is an achievement in and of itself
---
i‚Äôve come to the conclusion that a possible update or glitch has done this
---
No
---
Wait is this real? I haven‚Äôt played the game in a while so I‚Äôm not up-to-date with the news
---
She's just chillin
---
Oh, thanks! This helps me so much in reforming my opinion!
---
Still gonna be proud considering I don‚Äôt have as much time as I used to to play. Lost that luxury when my son was born and only play once every weekend if that. Plus I‚Äôve been stuck in high gold for about a year so this was an accomplishment on its own for me. It was just a small goal I set for myself, that I‚Äôd at least touch low plat by the end of the year
---
No problem
---
Photoshopped
---

---
Did you get a elo loss penalty?
---
Why do you have to be a dick. Seriously if they were the exact same then they wouldn't be two different ranks. Don't come on here and be a dick.
---
Original
---
I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs significant here?
---
what are the sounds? moans?
---
way to fucking kill the mood
---
I went as Blitz, unfortunately half of my shield is cut out of the picture though ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Nice, it's very realistic
---
This would make it worse, derankers would destroy everyone. And what about someone like me who's unranked but low Plat tier? I'd be matching with mostly low Golds and high Silvers without even wanting to.
---
Odd
---
You can‚Äôt ‚Äúearn‚Äù more than two, but you can buy more with renown, even though it‚Äôs 12,500 for just one.
---
I had the exact same idea except the ability was a grenade and on an attacker
---
Where are fuze‚Äôs legs?
---
You should have run outside. My teammate literally blew the game because he was afraid to run out of the front door with 5 seconds left and got himself killed
---
He is optimal tho. 
---
His winrate dummy high.
---
Worth it though

I can't be sure but I reckon his winrate is boosted by all the plats and champs that play him
---
It‚Äôs only a game... it‚Äôs only a game
---
Ruby
---
It‚Äôs actually 11,250 for one pack
---
Here we see the exquisite spider-J√§ger lying in wait, an apex predator of rainbow six, he is capable of dropping like a stone onto any waiting enemy and then floating back up to the ceiling with his catch. There he consumes his prey and repeats his method....
---
I had this happen with a friend aswell, but for an actual ranked match
---
Hehe, peepee
---
*HATSCH*
---
Spot on. I have to say I really appreciate the face mask. It is just like the one in game. Also I can't believe you remember to add the glow stick to his gun. Like top notch stuff. It's so amazing I can't even believe that you haven't been signed to Ubisoft modeling yet. Did you take the picture with a drone? The details is remarkable.
---
Are they trying to force you to teamkill? I don't understand how cheaters try to get you banned.
---
the blitz main needs to be put down
---
While being chased by 3 hammer bois as the last one I screamed resulting in waking my roommate who I completely forgot about during my moment of true terror.
---
_Why do it yourself when a floating J√§ger can do it better?_
---
...which shows how strong he is. 
---
If he‚Äôs bad in the hands of a worse player, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre using him poorly. And ibis published winrate is only measured and charted across Plat+ anyway.
---
This is going to give me nightmares. A parasite furry.

Well sounds fun...

I just wanna fuck Dokkaebi in general

Why my PP hard
---
I see that little case that says BOSG Acog i see you, i see you
---
I have a job and that has nothing to do with you acting like a child because someone plays on console. Grow up
---
I think OP means while in tank mode
---
Fuckin hate that shit
---
I think it it‚Äôs a fun concept but ultimately would not last in-game
---
Put on about 100 lbs, aside from adding weathering to the helmet and gear it looks great.

"Hold F to interrogate"

***FUCKING MURDERS***

Yeah, i get that a lot, in my case its mostly because i say something in Spanish (server is latam, most people are from Brazil)
---
Nice!
---
There's a bunch of people who don't like doctors curse and find it infuriating because of how OP atttack is.
---
Since it's a halloween themed event it won't be staying but what they should do is give sledge the hammer and axe skins and have the hide and seek mode on custom games.
---
Solo queuing is so annoying I need more friends ;(

rolling sphere that has a high spectrum speaker capable of playing back high defenition audio tracks, mimicking footsteps above, shuffling in a room, etc

I would agree if R6 seige was more of a tactical game. but it‚Äôs a great idea I‚Äôd be ok if they put it in,because it‚Äôs only when she‚Äôs using the ability,

I see that bosg acog

When you were a furry but it‚Äôs now spooky time.
---
Why was he checking the Room for so long?
---
There's no mood to be killed. It's literally posted everywhere here. LOL.
---
Dont worry, im on it. Haven't stoped playing kapkan ever since ive started playing siege.
---
Which form?
---
Literally happened 5 minutes ago. Safe to say I‚Äôm done with R6 for the next couple days.
---
when people stop handing over entire paychecks to support this broken mess.
---
Yes, and also during unranked.
---
Bro. Calm down.  You need something better to rise up and fight against
---
That‚Äôs just EA punishing you for not buying it! happens to the best of us man...
---
Understandable I would be too. This and people who keep trolling by team killing get on my nerves.
---
You do realize how OP this would be?
---
Yeah thats fair a hide and seek mode would  be welcomed i think, keep it fresh and something different
---
Derankers can already destroy everyone of less skill than them. This doesn't change that loophole.
---
Yes you can lol.
---
Dude idek why it happens to me. I literally did nothing, never played with any of them before, wasn‚Äôt on mic, just wild. That‚Äôs sucks ass tho man, sorry u deal with it as well
---
Lol white boi
---
It‚Äôs hard to lose if you‚Äôre sending out a scan every second

---
They disliked a comment for a being a joke
---
Don‚Äôt spawn there then LOL every map has a safe spawn
---
PC is always easier to pickup at first due to a mouse being so much easier to aim with. Console takes a bit longer but with practice you can still have pretty good aim. Try and have the highest sens that you can have while retaining decent aim. Then do some T-Hunt aim practice and practice tracking objects.
---
That's the whole point of those operators and they serve that purpose
---
I see what you mean, these reworks have been good, but rework after rework after rework is gonna get so boring, new maps can add a lot more diversity and options, just gotta make it good
---
Imagine if these kids actually knew how to play they game..::
---
No no no no
---
If Ubi ads a defender that does anything with buffing their runouts by extending the timer or denying it I‚Äôm quitting the fucking game lol
---
She‚Äôs there, but her ability is active
---
Why would Hibana drop lol
---
Great minds think alike comrade!
---
The vest could use a little work but otherwise great job
---
Smh shaking my shaking head's shaking head shaking skating heads shaking heads
---
Me and my friend randomly thought of this in a game and everyone in the match starting to get mad üòÇ
---
No. It's not a gamble. If you know exactly where the defenders are playing, you know exactly where to throw to flash them. 
---
You just can't expect to chuck a flashbang through a door and expect it to affect anyone in the room regardless of their position. 
---
There needs to be some leeway for the defenders. If they see a flashbang being thrown their way, they should have the option to position themselves in such a way to avoid the effects.
---
I get that it can be frustrating but flashbang is a high skill gadget. If you can't use them properly, then switch to breach charges.
---
Where is the cosplay?
---
Chaos is a ladder
---
MOVE SCHNELL
---
Never realized but there‚Äôs are a lot of operators
---
SAS Recruit best Recruit.
---
Why are you so mad calm down friend
---
This was done in SourceFilmMaker, an animation software released by Valve. The models are taken from the game by various people and they are available in the Steam Workshop.
---
Nah
---
I try to play patiently when I play cav or frost and try to bait a teammate to come revive. Usually works if the other team isn‚Äôt communicating and it‚Äôs a free 2 piece
---
Because we already have a good amount of maps. I‚Äôm fine with 1 map or even no new map per season.
---
Yes it is! I'm glad that someone noticed that
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/7EP0WDo here is a second upload

You're welcome comrade
---
Angry much?  They say furries are emotionally-stunted man-children, and it looks like they‚Äôre right
---
This is amazing
---
Best headgear? Best headgear
---
Bruh
---
Yeah, its not a very pretty thing to witness in game.
---
Operator seams fine but the map will only be a villa 2.0 imo.
---
imagine if this is an employee leaking stuff
---
** shoves __all__ into bowl ** 
---
** starts mixing it with a mixer **

** combines with cookie dough **

Next day: OMG Betty these cookies are so good!

Betty: thank you! I really put my __all__ into it!!
---
I mean Rainbow has 21 maps and 50 operators. To be honest, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if for Y5 they just stopped making new stuff and fixed what we have. Can‚Äôt have busted ops like BB, Ela, Lion or Nomad if you don‚Äôt release new ops. Can‚Äôt have stupid maps like Fortress Tower or Meme Park if you just rework the maps instead of making new ones.
---
"Thats not how the force works"
---
They won‚Äôt give her new weapons.
---
They said they were thinking about it since her pick rate was low .
---
What about the weird thingy that should be surrounding the screen?
---
I have the exact same uniform/headgear setup XD
---
Dude how were you that lucky i never get dumb enemies just dumb teammates
---
Hahahahhahaha no...
---
SLEDGE SMASH
---
I remember one round i went ultra instinct and dodged all 5 for the last minute

r/thanksihateit
---
T-hunt, but only one taps (single fire, aim to the head) but before shooting, try to move your op while keeping the sight dot on the terrorist head.
---
You can also peek doors or angles, but keeping you sight dot at the edge of the angle and moving forward and backwards, trying to keep the reticle at the same spot all the time.
---
At last, whenever you kill a terrorist, follow his falling body with aiming stick till it hits the ground.
---
That' all i used back in the day
---
but yeah he still takes it slowly and then loses
---
Best fit
---
You can just see drax right next to her
---
I personally love vigil and especially messing around with the host but your call.
---
I feel so motivated now, thank you.
---
Lesion be towering over these fools as the superior operator.
---
Stolen strat from bikini bodhi
---
It seems like the Kapkan ones are common (but cool). I‚Äôve opened six packs and got his headgear, uniform, and gun skin, and one of my friends got his uniform and headgear in like 4 packs
---
I like this comic, but I do not know why people seem to hate it
---
I personally love vigil and especially messing around with the bosg but your call.
---
I made this combo and thought about posting it
---
Had this happen to me except I was on the other side of the gun.
---
Yo, that was kinda nutty.
---
Yeah I guess I'm super unlucky. My 2 free packs and first four I bought were all the charms. No gun skins, uniforms or headgears. Literally just the charms. I bought more and my last pack is the one that has the Kapkan uniform
---
Lol
---
God that charm is so blinding.
---
The original 20 operators were meant to bring in the core customer base for a tactical shooter. That done, they needed to expand to other demographics so now you have furry skins, Monty as a giant butterfly and a James Bond clone that runs in a goofy manner.
---
Musta been quite the surprise when you gunned them down.
---
It is? Idk, at first I thought it was too bright, but it‚Äôs very dim
---
Oh lord what happened ? Failed a test or something
---
Out of this I gotta go with Ela

---
for videogames, yes. but when ask like "is 15 legal" with a little less context the answer will probably always be no.
---
I think it‚Äôs the bloom setting you have on. For me it‚Äôs so distracting xD
---
Eliminate the blitz main
---
I could have sworn there was a Siege LFG subreddit.
---
Even in a game mode where defenders are completely helpless, you still played like a pussy smh
---
I hope her ass is still intact
---
No that's his 3rd mask, thatcher is actually under that
---
Whats with that wrist
---
I really like the helmet!
---
Thanks R6 :,(
---
oo okay
---
Fair enough.  Still looks like a sex doll with scoliosis though.
---
I mean I‚Äôm lvl 176 and I‚Äôm plat 2 with 1500 hours. I know calling it cod without the 1 shot headshot mechanic is exaggerating but I think it‚Äôs an important part of what makes siege siege
---
counter A. counter
---
Yes it does
---
Worth the buy just for the animation imo
---
Found Thad castle?
---
I posted em, if you can't find them on Reddit, they are still on my Twitter page
---
Exactly, on your own with no help from any other teammate you can lock down a gigantic portion of the map. You don't need to cover each other or having someone flank watching anymore.
---
yooo man thats sick!! how long did it take?
---
Why do I see so many people running reflex on Fuze's gun instead of ACOG? I get that it looks great and gives clean visuals, but isn't the added zoom super valuable on attack?
---
About an hour and half to print, 45 seconds to colour.
---
it's not just about being childish, many operators in the history of siege have had a low risk high reward playstyle. Like Lion, Glaz, BB etc... When the professional community agrees unanimously that these ops are ruining the game its safe to say they need some changes.
---
Smexy
---
Blitz main? Man of culture, I see.
---
Literally no one did it with Tachanka before or uploaded it, so yes, you're a copy cat mate.
---
Yeah you're inept at the game, but almost everyone is at 100 hours in. So you're probably average. [Here's me](https://r6stats.com/stats/90368edd-94ba-4761-a410-f6fc44c67dd6/), average or subpar for time invested

Kapkan with that win delta
---
Worse still is when they are nagging about it, while zipping back and forth. Questioning why you arent Healing them.
---
T_T
---
Bc you're not worth the risk. That's why.
---
Who defines "toxic"?
---
You encourage companies to do that you then get companies banning you for criticising governments etc.
---
We shouldn't encourage it.
---
Nice cropping shitlord
---
Just headgear? Bandit, cuz it goes well with almost any uniform...
---
But as a bundle, definitely Kapkan... bought the whole collection almost just for him
---
Neutral good or chaotic evil
---
It's a choke point for attackers everywhere. Just one door to entre from, and all windows leave you vulnerable. The only other entrance is a hatch, so if defenders lock down these, attackers are screwed.
---
The number of windows on that map make it so defenders can get a low risk peek onto the outside.
---
It's a PvE map. Not PvP.
---
Sadly it happened 5 times in a row. Went up to 30 minutes at one time. So I gave up waiting and went to have dinner... When I came back it was at the 30 minutes mark. Happened yesterday and today too in finding casual and the new event :(
---
oh no, trust me, everyone here has seen it all right, more than enough times
---
Wtf bro lmao
---
Yeah it's pretty darn bad. And people now want it in ranked. Smh.
---
bro üòéüí™
---
I've felt that, yes.
---
Ofc dude don't even listen to the little people that put you down for your platform because they need to compensate for their tiny peen insecurities. The reality is the console playerbase is far bigger.

Had this happen to me too! Free elo FTW
---
Did you throw the phone with a timer? ü§î
---
Its a fun bug, but holy hell, unless you had your hands cut off and are playing with your nose, how the fuck does that gameplay happen...
---
Wouldn't it be blurry if I threw my phone?
---
isnt Jaeger top pick
---
^yes ^^ma'am
---
even ubi mains Ash...
---
I bet the Cav was fuming.
---
Idk why people don't get this. Are they just new LMAO I've explained rhabon so many posts and in game.
---
Good bot
---
Screw those sore losers
---
this gameplay is painful to watch, my eyes are burning
---
I have played many hours and cannot remember a time that a cosmetic skin specifically gave away my position or cost me a gun fight. I think you can safely wear it and not worry about it.
---
Lol gg
---
Huh? Just create another account for uplay, log in with and buy the game?
---
These look really nice!
---
Huh
---
I‚Äôm not bothered by it too much, I find it more funny when people leave mid interro it still gives the full interrogation effect. So it‚Äôs their own loss for leaving
---
If anything in unranked or ranked its best if they leave and you get the full effect. Then they might not load into the next round screwing their team even harder
---
Still ain't got shit on my hit box.
---
Well it certainly is an interesting idea. Maybe not an acog, but let him have the good old PSO scope. Only concern is that people would spawnpeek with him buuuut they already do that with Doc, Rook, Echo And Maestro, hell i've seen people spawnkill with j√§ger still so i dont think it'd be that bad. Ubisoft could probably modell the damagr, reload speed and recoil from the AK-12 Fuze has. Or make it have a huge recoil pattern and a ton of kick but have high damage like Kaid's AUG smg. While i know comparing it with the AUG sounds horrible but it'd work the same way, only it'd have an acog and a bit lower ammo count in one mag
---
Hot.
---
this is epic
---
Tell the Ela main over in the picture to close her legs I can smell the fish from here üòÇüòÇ

Wait a minute, what do you mean blitz isn't banned???

Hm, I think the color on the mask is a bit off. But nonetheless amazing cosplay!
---

---
I love blitz with his container metal shield
---
NO
---
Yep, you do the "creative" flair Justice.
---
The smoke should have done something
---
r/woooosh?
---
We both had the unlimited health in one found the other rounds. Was just her one tapning us with the Twitch drone. How it this not registered by battleeye. That i cant get killd. Battleeye Should have auto banned me when it sees that I have that much health. But no
---
Wanted lesions headgear and got Frost‚Äòs body and the shotgun skin for smoke. I don‚Äòt play any of them
---
Its probably a terrorist from terrorist hunt :D
---
Luckily I have 3. Two of them pressured my other friend and me to buy it, and well.
---
Your a fucking bot bro
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
Ash because that's my main too and she zooooooomin'
---
A pink phone cover. MUST BE A GAMER GIRL!!!!!
---
I think i know what you are talking about and when i have a bad match that my aim is shit i go drink some water mabe switch a game or just play casual a bit and after an hour or so i come back and try rank again
---
Good luck keeping that flimsy icon together. Keep it safe till you print a white base or idk
---
Pc or controller? Anyway you should practice 1v1s 2v2s etc. Also try to stay calm and try to have fun :)
---
blitz just vibin‚Äô
---
How could you do this
---
but we had same placements
---
She could hold any gun like that. She's just being extra. Though I agree the mp7 or the commando would be a better gun for her.
---
I think that "SHOOT" is good because it's like the goal of a gun, but I can change that to something else
---
Yea I saw a post awhile ago from someone this happens to I believe it is a bug and not someone hacking I would say just report it to ubisoft
---
Lol budget but it works
---
Your rank soft resets every season. So your rank last season + your 10 placement games determines your rank this season.
---
The AK has only 600 RPM, its the same like the UMP. I dont think it would be OP. Even with an ACOG.
---
K/D means nothing as the game is meant to be played as a team with everyone supporting each other. The only thing that matters is enemy ranks, and the score difference, you get more for winning a 1-4 than you would a 2-3, etc. 
---
This isnt call of duty, this is a team based game so the ELO is ranking you with your team. That's why it's so annoying if you get garbage/troll teams because they will really hurt you and its completely out of your hands pretty much :/
---
Which op is in between buck and lesion

Blitz looks appropriately "I'm doing alright, I guess" for how he's gotten nerfed recently.
---
"Everything is just ok"
---
How many times will this post be repeated
---
Ohhh ok. I couldnt recognize him as he was kinda covered up
---
It doesn't consider in-game stats at all.
---
Bro.... what the hell did you just say?
---
Repost
---
Originally when I started siege I was like HOW AM I GETTING HEADSHOT cause it says in his description he has a bulletproof face shield but I didn‚Äôt use the turret that round so I never knew
---
The French royal skin and Black ice are my favourite skins
---
They should add Jason as rank op. Cross between cab and rook.

I don‚Äôt know what did you misunderstand about that sentence or two

*oil flairs up*

Ah yes blitz main
---
Ranking considers these things only: whether you win or lose, yours and the other team's average MMR, and your last rank in the previous season (only during placement matches). Kills, points and any kind of personal score are not taken into account.
---
I personally have mine like this
---
 (-deadzones)
---
Horizontal sens: 75
---
Vertical sens: 35
---
Ads sens: 26
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, and plat 3. (2 pts off plat 2..)
---
Default.
---
I love the blitz shield it's looks about as effective as it is in game
---
if there's one thing kap needs it's shortening the deployment time of the edd. it went from 3 to 5 but still takes the same time, and he was already low on time
---
This isn't exactly the answer you're looking for but it seems to have gone away for me (by not really doing anything).
---
This was after installing the newest Nvidia drivers (released around a week ago). It could have also been the newest Windows 10 update. Either way, it's likely one of those two and probably the former.
---
LINE
---
Here let me just elaborate on the whole concept:
---
Lmg is now primary, has iron sights only with shaky recoil, go prone and either toggle or automatically deploy bipod (in place of turret stand) which reduces recoil almost completely
---
Also his thicc helmet blocks headshots but only in the front of his face
---
Asshole downvoting shit
---
Sometimes my cpu temperature reaches 100c¬∞
---
Just in Siege
---
Keep in mind my fps limited at 70

If i unlimited it it reaches 150-170 easily

I have an i5 9300 and a gtx 1650

---
Does your cpu have a heatsink? Which is a cpu cooler. If not think of getting on, if your using your old rig obviously, if it's the gaming laptop then not much can be done, I suggest contacting siege support to see what they think.
---
everyone sees it
---
Which rank was you?
---
BRO I'M DOING THAT TOO
---
It's intentional. They made it so you wouldn't be sticking out through cover and preventing unfair kills
---
Yeah it's the gaming laptop
---
I'll contact them and see, thanks for your help.
---
I think giving mp7 acog would put it on all mp7s. Remover when ubi said the wouldn‚Äôt give anyone but a 3 armpit an acog but then goyo came with a gun that already had one and broke that mold. Maybe ubi could have just wanted to have goyo be able to activate his stuff from long range but based on previous statements it seems attachments are tied to all versions of a gun. Giving acog to one and not to another would make a ‚Äúnew gun‚Äù and at that point why not just add a brand new gun
---
New
---
I only agree on the mp5SD part like CMON GIVE IT TO HER KT FITS AND IT MAY BE PERFECT FOR N√òKK
---
Blitz and his cardboard
---
No problem. Hope it gets fixed.
---
or if you want old but not reliable you should go for the ppsh41
---
OR just hear me out, but just quickly leave the game when she interrogates you. Problem solved.
---
damn son where'd ya find this?

I spawned as recruit on defence and domed 2 guys lol

You bring IQ for a reason

Jason Voorhees is my op.

waiting for the change in next season reveal. I am pretty sure they will change her loadout during reveal of next season.

Dangerous, but maybe usefull to take the risk
---
Lol, you dont have black ice for the R4C.

That Blitz's face screams terror. I can see him running at me smiling ready to blind me and the bash me to death.

Okay, i will go through and talk about the rooms that should have destructible floors.

The same principle applies. If you take away the damage of guns through a wall then it creates a disadvantage for the lower damage person. If I‚Äôm playing valk and I use my cams or call outs or whatever to out-position an attacker and try to wall bang, he has the very large opportunity to see that I‚Äôm doing that and fire back to kill me first. The majority of wall bangs in my experience are that scenario, out playing or droning someone so that you know where there are to be able to wall bang. So if you remove the defenders ability to OSHS then you take away a whole facet of the game. They will be forced to peak into the open for every single kill, it would no longer matter how good their intel is, if the guy is in a soft room or behind a barricade the only option for the defender now is to push him directly, which will lead to his death. So if you want to tweak the OSHS I‚Äôd say it would have to be for every gun and without exception. I still think that is a bad idea because of the previous argument, your intel on the room next to you no longer matters, there‚Äôs no difference between a reinforced wall and a soft wall. Because now you‚Äôre unable to secure a kill no matter where you‚Äôre shooting through

I was actually thinking this would be a phenomenal spot for mozzie. If you got a couple drones and could scoot around on them while laying there, you could easily have one drone watching the garage and just lean out and shoot anyone that came through the main man door, while you drone the other entrance points with the second one. It would be a great spot for him on CCTV defense.

No cuz kd has almost no indication of skill whatsoever

Yea I‚Äôm wonder how they came up with that it would go like ok so how will we make kapkan how about a zombie no ela is already a zombie what if we made him all black ok but how is that scary we add a skeleton face but couldn‚Äôt that mean he could hide in dark areas now eh it‚Äôll be fine
---
Well it would be nice but also discourage team play. I think it is fine like it is right now.
---
Sounds better cuz on jah dude id become so paranoid if she just activates it as she moves

Yea this mode hammer range is outrageously broken.

Doc is probably the best sniper the defense team has besides lardex and kaid yet he needs to be at point blank to get his stim just right so his teammate doesn‚Äôt die from their own stupidity.
---
Last time I checked good players get more kills
---
It's back, been back for a little while too.
---
Never get the dream team
---
its kapkan/tachanka smg
---
Ranks really do mean nothing
---
Nope, if you get in a 1v5 and kill 3 people who were messing and throwing you're not that good
---
Not to mention, plenty of kills are calculated luck. The 1shs system allows people to get kills before an enemy can even react just based on lucky crosshair placement
---
If kd went into elo it would also further reinforce kill whoring and add more toxicity when you're down 0-3
---
Good stuff. Wonder if that debris is going to make a ton of noise though with every minor movement.

It's not floating, you can see the grey switch riser box behind it, and the conduit coming up to the ceiling from the box, because it's mounted on a cinder block wall
---
Play opps on defense like mute and kapcan so you can learn common ways through maps
---
Ok, let's do some simple math since your so smart. I aced the first 3 rounds(note: this is on bomb), so that's 15. We then proceeded to lose the next three on defense. One round I got 4 kills and the other two I aced. The only reason we lost was because I couldn't defuse the bomb. Sp you add that to 15 and you get 29(guess what? Were getting pretty close!). So, in OT I got spawnpeeked 1st round and died, so no kills. Then on defense I aced once again. The next round it was a trade so we went into double OT( Note: I got no kills that round). So now were at 34 kills, huh, funny how math works. I proceeded that round to get 3 kills and afterwards take the win. That leaves me with 37. Next time you tell someone there wrong try to think of everything before you look like an idiot.

This is a team game. Mindless Fragging doesn't deserve more importance than coordinated team play.

Same, I love them both. Thermite‚Äòs animation is one of the best and kapkan‚Äòs uniform looks really good. But I don‚Äòt like any of those weapon skins, they aren‚Äòt very special
---
Good teams win.
---
Regardless of the kill number.
---
well hes was always able to play but he couldnt hear anyone in game chat and couldnt talk in game chat he can now so maybe he got banned fr 24 hrs from being toxic like swearing and being racist? because we had these toxic tm8s and they were trash talking and cussing the entire time so its probably from that
---
Absolutely love them!
---
Dirty vs Not Dirty.
---
Clearly we need to nerf shield ops.
---
Love that skin, at least you got your renown back? lol
---
he may be fast but is he useful to your team?
---
You can ask the same question with Ash and Vigil
---
You could always just turn that off in the options
---
I got the same thing for smoke and it looks the same as the original
---
I wish all of them had the option between reticles. Dot, Holo, Triangle. I like the look of the reflex, but I hate the triangle. I hate the horseshoe/dot acog, but love the chevron acog.
---
It's weird, considering the triangle is just a filled in chevron, and the horseshoe/dot acog is just an incomplete holo. But my aim changes with them.
---
oh.
---
having the slight sense of superiority on my pathetic life is satisfying
---
maybe because the only 2 good things about t hunt are that you can practice aim and that it gets you a lot of renown
---
That hurts
---
L
---
well imo ash and vigil both have abilities that make them good as fraggers, whiles wardens ability is dependent on the attacker not really making him a good all around fragger.
---
That's how I shoot that gun too. I hate it.
---
They should get kicked for inactivity.

I don‚Äôt even know whether to upvote or down vote
---
He‚Äôs got a little support
---
Warden is a good fragger with the *potential* to counter a lot of attacker utility, but it's up to the player. Would you want to run Valk that has cams, same 2 speed with same MPX, or do you wanna run a op that may or may not be useful at all

Nah those extra 10 rounds makes it extra viable now

Instead of nerfing jackal again and again( not saying he does not deserve it, there is just a better way) just give jackal a hard counter, like you can‚Äôt be tracked if within range of a mute jammer

When you play 60 games of siege, get 3 alpha packs, and get this, a crappy charm, and a duplicate item

I think it‚Äôs a great idea.

I don‚Äôt know about the MP-5SD as it‚Äôs the same as the FMG-9 just with a suppressor (since the Devs said she‚Äôs not getting an ACOG).

Dangleberry btw. He collabs with CoconutBrah alot.
---
Copper 5 gang
---
Yeah, or you can erase the "______ Main" part and click the next operator you want, then repeat as desired so you just have icons
---
I agree it is a high skill gadget and I still think it would still be a high skill gadget if it were reworked. The defender still has plenty of opportunity to defend himself if deafened, nothing stops him from seeing and shooting the attacker, especially if the defender knows where they are coming from which is generally the case. The attacker is unsure whether or not the defender's sight is impaired. The deafening effect of the flashbang does not take away from its need for a high-skill operator to use well as the operator still needs to lob it just right to also impair sight.
---
Perhaps the flashbang also deafens attackers if they are within proximity?
---
Or maybe a separate kind of grenade like in COD, not that I'm trying to make R6 like COD, god no. But perhaps a concussion grenade that only deafens defenders (and perhaps attackers) and keep the flashbang as it is?
---
What do you think?
---
I don't like her because she yells a lot.

Siege is F2P?

This is why I love siege. Its clever, and creative, unlike any other game.

Man the differences are insane
---
^(tbh I use J√§ger whenever I really want to win so I guess I main him :P)
---
The attacker model is always Ying for some reason,  defender changes though.
---
Well most of the operators are hard to gain with only 250 renown per match  and I dont buy packs.Took me about 3 weeks to get N√∏kk and Mira.
---
I‚Äôm very confused with the maps right now because I played siege back in its first year on PS4 and then stopped. Now I‚Äôm back on it on pc and many maps have been reworked adding on top the time that has passed I just simply can‚Äôt remember and am struggling to learn. 
---
 basically just know the bank, boat, favelas, and the one with 2 buildings by the docks
---
Edit: I know borders and for favelas Im objectives but all the other rooms are a beyond me
---
Bosg needs ACOG, j√§ger needs to stfu

This game gives me the same feelings I had as a kids playing hide n‚Äô seek in my rich friends big houses.

I wouldn't say it requires *that* much thought. Just kinda, y'know. One of those things you'd just kinda figure. It's not like I took myself a sit-down and contemplated the purpose of the tape covering the magazine of the P90 in Rainbow Six: Siege.

I wanted to see 40 tachankas but this isn't bad either

Well first off he‚Äôs a high ranking member (Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental Sergeant Major)) of the SAS and that should speak for it‚Äôs self. But as for his personal achievements he‚Äôs a veteran of three wars and the oldest member of the SAS. He‚Äôs an expert in multiple CQC techniques and He has honed his expertise with protective measures and electronic counter-measures. He also trains other members of the SAS and Team Rainbow.

so my friend who is lvl 93 has there black ice primaries and I'm lvl 183 and have only got black ice on j√§ger's secondary
---
New menus shit, they need to completely overhaul the new menu, way to many sub menus and things to click on.
---
Idk about y‚Äôall but I love the blood orchid uniforms
---
There always is
---
How?
---
People who turn r6s male operator into female will never find their "the one" and will die alone. While also getting that itch in their feet in the middle of public and it will not go away until they get away from people.
---
more like "bottom-step" tho
---
I was hoping that I'd get the pack and I can have it kinda just sit there as a momento of the event, but I also wanted the final item so i was worried about it
---
People were shooting at you and you went for the downed player? You did not deserve that clutch at all.
---
I‚Äôm not seeing what‚Äôs so confusing. Jager was by the bar as you saw on your drone yet for some reason you aimed to your right as you walked through the door.
---
I hate blacks
---
I love how symmetrical the flying of the bodies is too.
---
Yeah I agree with that, but it may take ubi long time to fix this. I hope they'll fix this just like they fix the AR-15 .50 mag model.
---
I only dislike one thing of the new menu and its than they eliminated the ctu histories, before you could the history of the spetsnaz or the fbi, now you cant :(
---
OH WAIT YOURE SPECTATING SOMEONE LMAOOOOOOO
---
When you select the op there's an option on the bottom of their menu to set as the displayed character
---
Nah, he's right. It's just a bit cringy but still cool.
---
I disagree, the other way was simpler and was also way less laggy
---
Except now you can activate Cavs ability anytime without having to fully recharge it, so yeah, it is a hard counter.
---
'new'
---
I personally love the pro league skins that are added every season
---
then one might as well attach a laser too, the hipfire may be marginally better but then it will negate the benefit of the suppressor?
---
It‚Äôs not the same team(s) that deal with bugs and all that and the people doing the social media... it doesn‚Äôt take out development time. Let people do their selfies if they want it doesn‚Äôt change anything in the game.
---
There are 2 in gray.
---
Ikr XDD
---
Where the 2nd guy from the right? I only saw three  bodies flew 
---
Got kick for team damage?
---
Shield*
---
I'm sorry to hear that you don't like it but in my opinion the blood orchid and white noise uniforms are the best in the game so far. I'm very angry because i didn't know that they get removed after the season ends. I would've bought the whole set for every operator if i could. Best Uniform for Bandit/J√§ger imo. Still got lucky this month when i got Blood Orchid Uniform for Smoke tho üëå Pretty hyped when i get silver packs üòÇ
---
Yeah haha I was super confused when he did that
---
This hits hard man
---
Are there people who just run around the maps trying to find spots like these. Also, I wouldnt be suprised if Vigil would like to hide there
---
I get so pissed when people don't kick them either.
---
Yes, but you need to buy an expensive adapter for a game like this
---
shut the fuck up
---
Not a criticism just a fun observation. Costume looks great!
---
yeah i would say it was more of a feature
---
Prefire that spot every round now

Bruh. I was convinced this was an Easter egg and I swear I spent an entire day baked out of my mind trying to figure it all out. Thanks.

Ok so everyone should stop posting clips because they're all from the same game. Let's just get more art posts.
---
That's dirty.

jokes on you, i just take my shoe off and itch my foot while balancing on the other foot.

All the outfits are great I love your idea have a great Halloween

Part of the reason why I choose the commando over the roni

They‚Äôre body‚Äôs just become like 2‚Äô5 when getting into tiny spaces.

I love this fun, so good when u finally learn to control it

I remember the good ole days when it was a lazer
---
&gt; People using k&amp;m are using 3rd party devices to get around the block which isnt approved by Microsoft
---
It is, they asked MS support and they said Xim is just fine. Saw this in the xim forum
---
Fairly certain my idea would be much easier to implement.
---
Lol no. It would literally be the same as every other op being knocked off cams when Dokk calls.
---
SPEED
---
same
---
Congrats but unlucky on the duplicate
---
I‚Äôm a dingus and misread what you said! Thank you, you as well.
---
No, they should stop posting themselves getting recruit accidentally in the Halloween gamemode
---
It's not random most of the time. Pre firing standard parts of the map is skillful. Don't stand in front of common wall bangs. Same as CS.
---
Preventing the user from closing the application properly just seems like a bad idea to me. Personal preference I guess.
---
btw should i get kaid or maestro
---
Honestly all I want is a nice blue or green dot for my colorblind ass
---
Must be a sub reddit for people looking for ranked

Are you ok with unranked?

more like r/fuckhumanrights

*40+ Tachankas yelling "LMG, mounted and loaded!" as the Soviet anthem theme slowly intensifies.*
---
you aim in combat? i barely attempt to pull the trigger when faced with an enemy, as the sight of western Rook with an ice-cream-defaced personal defense weapon causes my enemies to scrape their eyes from their skulls with the butt of their puny rifles
---
I‚Äôm less concerned by the fact you spawned as recruit and more concerned that you still lost the round even though you literally had a gun
---
nope
---
Looking for ranked, sorry!
---
I agree. Colorblind mode is important for competitive game.

That‚Äôs not what i‚Äôm saying, what i‚Äôm saying is it should prevent you from accessing the menu that contains the leave match option. It‚Äôs practically impossible to prevent someone from closing the application.
---
The closest I've had to doing something like this was in a competitive match and the enemy just broke a door by shooting it down, so I yelled "PRO GAMER" ran towards the door while he reloaded and castled it shut locking him out of the obj and he ran out of time trying to break it.

Couldn't they use a non-transparent P90 magazine? I know they exist and this is more interesting.

Sorry mate

I get that lions and jackals abilities are different but they‚Äôre still built on their original ideas. Caveira is based on downing an enemy then interrogating the enemy to receive information. You can‚Äôt really change her ability all that much without removing the idea that it‚Äôs based on. They won‚Äôt change tachanka because they can‚Äôt really do it without changing the idea that he‚Äôs built on. Ubisoft wants to keep the abilities as close to their original ideas as possible.
---
Dude if you'd look at it, you'll notice that the MP5SD actually does more damage than the regular MP5
---
The only thing is it gives came
---
It‚Äôs funny cause you sound 10x more ignorant than him saying that ‚Äúkinda cute‚Äù shit lol
---
You could preview load outs and ops you didn‚Äôt have, you literally just hovered over and selected them.
---
People can tell where you are if they see your laser
---
Both are equally as useful
---
How dare you say the truth.
---
reinforced so no stray bullets somehow land on my head
---
Ready for extracting the hostage
---
but I feel Monty is very possible, but otherwise I agree with you
---
Realistically, most times tape is used in the military it is to distinguish between ammo types or to tape two mags together for quicker reload. I've heard it's also used for better grip on the magazines.
---
I doubt that the design team's goal is maximum efficiency. It is more likely a mixture of style and ease of navigating, wich does not only mean number of clicks.
---
Hawt
---
Just skill
---
Siege, there's several rainbow six games and my friends play most of them
---
Okay, on a wall with two sections, reinforce one side and put the window on that same side. Leave the other wall not reinforced so that you can shoot through it once you see someone through your window.
---
Also I like to guard a hall or stairway with a nitro charge that you can see through the window. It doesn't work every time, but watching a nitro kill through your window is awesome.
---
The odds of someone on this subreddit getting the same thing twice? High.
---
A lot are very possible and you should try and do research because Glaz's flip sight hybrid thermal is real
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll report back when stinger and then HijackThis have run through everything~
---
*Windhelm scream*
---
I find mid ranks to be less toxic. 
---
High ranks expect perfection from their teammates too much.
---
And really low ranks are usually either intentionally low rank smurfs, people who are low ranks because they‚Äôre toxic throwers, and people new to the game.
---
Mid tier players know they aren‚Äôt great and generally don‚Äôt throw when things don‚Äôt go well. So they‚Äôre usually more chill.
---
Not to be a shitter or something but you could've done it with cav since that's your title just put a bulletproof camera and that's it
---
Mine doesn‚Äôt do that. Check that you haven‚Äôt accidentally binded the button to something random.
---
Just MacieJay things
---
I would say it's for a better grip, but that's not where you grab it to reload, so no clue. 
---
I've never seen anyone tape their P90 mags, it seems like it would be more of a hindrance than beneficial in any way. As someone else said in response to another comment, people tape mags to differentiate between ammo, maybe that's what you saw. All my mags have tape with my name on them, just for convenience' sake at the range.  
---
In the case of the game, they one hundred percent added tape so they wouldn't have to animate the rounds cycling.
---
Clearly this is what happened lol. Any other circumstances he would have just gone to play Casual/Ranked or some other game entirely. But in this case, I'm assuming someone is fresh off a losing streak trying to get their free event pack with 13 round wins.
---
You get consoled for beating a cheater yet losing points
---
How would you abuse that lol
---
Care to explain?
---
That's not a glitch
---
People just reply to the top comment so that they can get more exposure on their comment regardless of how releveant their reply is.
---
That's great, but I don't see how that contributes to the discussion.
---
69 hp. Nice
---
It's all fun and games until the neighbor hears "Cluster charge deployed."
---
Wow lmao so salty that you're coming for my comments in other subs? Guess what, I don't play ANY of those characters so you just look dumb as fuck.
---
How can someone main Bardock and still be ranked so low? That's so sad. Imagine complaining about an s-tier team comp while main-ing an s-tier character. Imagine complaining about pro players' character choice while being garbage at the game. Imagine going through someone's post history to find them complaining about something in a completely different game in order to try to justify their own complaints, and still be wrong.
---
Pathetic.
---
I was meaning to say that I bought siege but can barely have a chance to play it
---
Yes
---
Go Ash, take defuser, rush, die on site, repeat.
---
He is the only operator who can counter flash bangs, smokes, grenades ect
---
Honestly nobody uses it so its better that they're not spending money on this and maybe just maybe they spend that money on ACTUALLY fixing the game.
---
Sure. 
---
If you build a system that has any potential for people to manipulate it, they will. You‚Äôll have people throwing matches just to get access to more alpha packs. These are the same kinds of kids who abandon a match when they‚Äôre downed just so they can artificially support some insane K/D. 
---
It sucks when you hit a cheater, but the second you start offering Alpha Packs, you could kiss any chance of fair matches and play out the window.
---
do you have the sauce want to share it with my friend
---
Chanda in unrealistic, glaz in realistic.
---
Also, Pluse in realistic.
---
Not at all, but if my 500+ hours of CS:GO have taught me anything, bullets are fuckin unpredictable.
---
It only seems to be happening for console players, from the three times I‚Äôve seen it happen on reddit. Maybe there‚Äôs some glitch going on, idk.
---
Your right but its better with drone
---
I have the originol image but i dont have the artist that drew it
---
the exact same idea was posted a few days ago
---
G r e n a d e
---
Yeah I'm replying to you. My point is that it's not like the MP5SD is just the mp5 with a suppressor and slightly different stats applied to it (like cap's vs cav's pistols) but that it's a completely separate entity - like the m249 between cap and gridlock. Easy way to know is if they share skins. As such the MP5SD doesn't suffer from having a suppressor on it vs a fh/comp/mb because the recoil is comparatively lower to account for the fact that it is suppressed by default. Not quite the same thing but also look at the six12 vs the six12SD - in that case, it *is* the same base weapon with a suppressor forcefully attached, but the damage is the exact same. In that case the stats don't change despite adding a suppressor
---
I think this is a fair argument. You are forgiven.
---
yeah but you don‚Äôt show it
---
At least I did lmao
---
I am remarkably shit at this game
---
I don't understand the fun in not shooting an enemy in an FPS.  I'm not disagreeing that people play games for fun.  That's obvious.
---
Wat?
---
I play on Xbox with garbage WiFi, this is about as good as is gets
---
Me and a friend queued for a ranked game but he ended the queue because it was taking too Long (as queue times are) and when he ended it we stayed on the menu as you would but I heard the sound that you hear when you enter a game so we re-queued and got into a ranked game when halfway through it what described in my post happens.
---
Male privilege
---
Yeah so far the bans have just been really annoying so I just stick to casual
---
The tape was usually used for keeping the weapon as quiet as possible, mostly for stealth but it's also easier on the mags from getting banged up.
---
na 1000 IQ
---
Oh ok, the title wasn‚Äôt clear about that, but that does kinda suck.
---
I love the skin I really do. I just wish that he had like a Van Helsing skin for the event. Like on his backpack is like a wooden steak, a cross and some garlic and just have the same headgear and give him a trench coat and boom we‚Äôre good to go
---
Because its staged
---
Hereford fortress and chalet im pretty sure is what was swaped out
---
This is the likely answer.
---
Ikr
---
Tape on a magazine is common where I'm from, at least within the army, it's to indicate the ammo type.
---
Haha, me too buddy but the game is fun anyway for me and you feel like a god when you impact a wall to shoot an enemy caught off guard or something.
---
When did this map come out?
---
I still remember when the smg 11 had an acog
---
this makes me feel good about myself tbh.
---
Honestly, I try to get all roamed banned
---
I‚Äôm making another one and I‚Äôm going to animate them to !
---
Lmfao
---
Level play isn‚Äôt a thing because there‚Äôs no correlation. Level just means you‚Äôve been playing for a while, but that doesn‚Äôt affect your skill. I‚Äôm a Gold 2. By your logic I could make a smurf and just continually play ranked with other people around my low level, regardless of actual stats. It‚Äôd be awful, and you‚Äôd have even less fun. The MMR restriction makes it so you are always playing with people in your skill range. And I‚Äôm sorry to say that if you deranked to copper than that may be where you‚Äôre at right now. Nothing wrong with it, it‚Äôs just the way it is. Worst case scenario just wait until the new season and try again.
---
#H E C K I N G H E C K
---
Makes sense
---
It's not a glitch, it's just timing. The animation was already in mid swing and part of that animation is when your cable disconnects, the castle simply blocked the path as that happened, works with regular panels too. I had that happen on house in a custom game once.
---
Your team has been humiliated.
---
The packs are a joke.
---
Real big boy move is suppressed 5.7 so you can get hitmarkers on cameras.
---
Only if you hit it twice before
---
Unfortunately not but yesterday was especially shitty so it was much more impactful
---
I‚Äôm unsure about the canister mode but the warmup mode was meant to be an aim training sort of map I think, not really sure what ever happened to them however
---
I had my game crashed on the last round of a ranked game. We were 5 against 1, by the time I relunched the game the match was over. And I got a loss for it. 
---
Love Ubi
---
I thought for sure it was John Carpenter. John does the voice intro to a song called Tech Noir by Gunship and this sounds just like him
---
Are you sure its not a heat based throttling issue? with you playing on your alt on times before the computer heats up
---
Is this true? I can‚Äôt find anything online saying there are rules on bullet caliber for use against people.
---
No, I just happen to know that movie logic regarding guns doesn't apply to real life. It's almost like people have hobbies or something.
---
Wait, destiny 2 was/is for free?
---
Yeah don‚Äôt know if it still is
---
I don't know what disgusts me more, the fact that you were able to pull that off or the fact you are using a reflex and not acog
---
Movie logic is dumb I will agree.
---
Is on pc or console? (im from pc btw)
---
I see
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pc  too
---
Haha I never thought of doing that but I will for sure try it, this is amazing if it works
---
I'd offer to play with you but as you can tell, you're better off without me.
---
Better find a way to do that without the bucket making a mess because that's a biiggg indicator
