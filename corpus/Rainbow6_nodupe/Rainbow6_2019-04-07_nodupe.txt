New player here. This is super frustrating since it stops me from learning my distances. Why is this game so old without a sequel to freshen it up? This year only one new map and remakes of old isnt doing much to help np experience.

The only buff he needs is his gun penetrating shields with some damage drop off.

Yeah but it definitely helped kap, because like I said, before it was a firefight that takes you down 20 hp then you hit a kapkan which is another -50 aka you‚Äôre at 30, then it was just a revive and you were back at a simple 50, now that one kapkan trap has a much larger impact I feel.

It would take minimum two for 2-3 speeds and three for 1 speed. This would be an indirect buff nonetheless

According to the leaks it would be an attacker which would be far from useless when you consider all the intel gathering tools defenders currently have. Currently there are the regular cams, yokai drones, valkyrie cams, evil eyes, Mozzie's drones and bullet proof cameras you have to worry about so adding a vigil-like operator to attack has huge potential to change the intel meta if done right.
---
What?
---
Was probably like 3rd game after placements and against diamonds
---
Idk what you're talkin about, I'm a diamond, and we have some decent respect for other players.  No wonder you're still in plat
---
Yeah - try going through the uplay launcher. Make sure your settings allow friends to join your game, then your friends should be able to right click your name in the uplay launcher's friends list and click join game.

Haha yes. Yesterday  I was in first place  with 3 kills/0 deaths. At the second round they let me 1 vs 4. I just killed one and then a mute shot me in the back.
---
They kicked me out for not winning against 4 guys at a time.
---
I play this shot since 3 weeks ago. Stupid toxic people.
---
One that's not smurfing that's just lying, second even if he was smurfing it wouldn't be cheating

Imagine echo's smg instead of valk thats what happened to me lol

aah how nice of you two! Thank you very much &lt;3 will definitely keep this in mind
---
They're also missing Tasmania
---
I already did unfortunately it didn‚Äôt really take off very well, I don‚Äôt think they got it.  
---
smurfing is cheating according to the devs, and if its not smurfing its reverse boosting (losing to make your rank go down to get easier enemies) like, whatever way you put it, if youre a plat or a diamond and you make an account or act on your account in a way that purposefully makes it seem like youre a lower rank to cheat the system, thats cheating, or at the very least scummy to the point it should be reprimanded
---
Not one shot, just too fast. Shield HP is like 50. 
---
No problem, I'm learning German so she's very helpful with stuff like that. We do have an 8 hour time difference though, so it can be tough to get an answer on short notice, though I do have a few other bilingual friends I can call on. 
---
Dude after 70 hours on Blackbeard I can confirm that sometimes that shield will block 50000 damage and next game it‚Äôll block -38. A few weeks back I clipped me one tapping a bb through his shield so I know it goes both ways 
---
The multiplier is for the ini file, you can choose to have it show an ingame number but unless you're really lucky it won't be precise. Think the multiplier is based off ther default 50/50 ingame, so set that and paste the multiplier to the ini file.
---
Who the fuck expected that lol

Looks like ela have a great time

Fetch me their souls...

Commenting for later.

I punched that out

Whatever man. If you are that easily impressed, good for you. Life must be a great adventure for you.

Dude, although it was 5v5, but I felt like 1v5 cause my teammate was bad, I ended up with 24 kills but we lost. Mind you, there was a guy with 0 kill on my team

---
Kixstar explained this on stream a few days ago, its because the cam is now in ur eyes and not forward of them or too far down, this change was added because vaulting gave u the maximum Peakers advantage, hence they moved the cam and slowed vaulting, but because of that we see this

What level do you play at where you care about firing modes. No one that is decent at the game ever switches their firing mode.
---
Also it seems you only play casual since you are talking about house??? 
---
The LMG has much faster rate of fire so it is definitely viable, in most gunfights you with already be aiming down sights so ads time isn't a huge factor here.
---
"Just spam them they panic" are you copper??? How can you say that blitz is balanced when it seems you go against people how have no idea how to play him. What level are you?????

You're expecting too much from this small indie studio.

But no, I'm sure the actual reason is far more complicated than just allowing it or disallowing it. They would probably have to restructure a large part of the back end and would that really be worth it for Ubisoft?

That could have happened but if you look after that visual glitch he still has 2 grenades.

I was playing a round of the new mode and I was fine the I played a match of casual and I kept lagging

Get the host to go to in game settings and set it to ‚ÄúOpen to Friends‚Äù, then join that person through the Uplay overlay. Make sure the host is not set to ‚ÄúDo not disturb‚Äù or else the option to join doesn‚Äôt appear.
---
It‚Äôs an issue Ubisoft is working to fix rn
---
I felt the need to take a shower after watching those two kills 
---
I say objective because OBJ just sounds like a weird blowjob
---
Obj because it‚Äôs faster and is sometimes better to hear over the mic
---
It‚Äôd be unique, that‚Äôs for sure. But I feel like rather than just rewarding you/your team for killing someone while their sight is turned off, maybe it should just give you 5 points when you successfully disable a sight as a little notification to say ‚Äúhey, someone was within range of your emp‚Äù so you get a little hint if anyone is nearby.
---
Unless Ubi decides to fix it no
---
Go 4 it?
---
Do y'all think enough people on r/historymemes play r6s for me to crosspost there?
---
God I just about puked because that was extremely nasty
---
Thank you I really appreciate it! I‚Äôve been trying to fix this for like 9 hours 
---
This shit looks like it was setup.. that‚Äôs how bad it is lol
---
It's not the game that's terrible, it's some of the playerbase. You get your good games and then your bad games. 
---
80%
---
Sounds right, what platform are you on? 
---
Honestly if the queue exceeds 2 minute just refresh
---
The ela shotgun is the best semi auto in the game, it has pretty much no recoil if you slightly pull down
---
I do that I just got board of doing it
---
Wallhack allow you to see through walls.. this.. this is more teleporting hack shit right there
---
I think it's success comes from the way its base gameplay functions. eg the way you move and shoot. You can be successful by treating gunfights in a similar way as you would in reality, like peeking from cover, staying safe, planning and communicating with your team and being aware of your environment. Other niche games do this but not with as much polish. I think this is what makes the game so successful. In cod you can turn your brain off and play on autopilot, sprinting around corners and trading damage in the open. In apex you run into someone in a field and trade damage in the open. In fortnight you peek from the right, most of your bullets hit the wall and it devolves into jumping shotguns out in the open. Another big factor is that its pacing is excellent. Action is usually constant without it feeling braindead and even if your holding an angle for minutes, tension is constantly building and your mind is active as you try to process what is happening outside you fov through sound cues and callouts. I think that sprint, shoot, die, repeat isn't the pinnacle of shooting gameplay and it seems like others might feel the same.

i actually didnt lmfao its not like the game made an announcement about it
---
What's wrong? Paid and random. Whether its optional is irrelevant. Paying a toll can be optional if you go out of your way to avoid them. They are annoying and unnecessary practice. Its not the action of grinding I have an issue with, its aimless grinding towards something I may not want.
---
oof
---
but if you are watching competitive siege there is much more to it than jus the 30 sec of action
---
and before that Germany and Poland both split Czechoslovakia and agree not to attack each other, so you rip what you sow 
---
change your setting to allow friends to join. Have him click on you through Uplay and join your lobby himself. seems to be a workaround for now

In game settings change squad privacy to ‚Äúopen to friends‚Äù then use shift+F2 click on your friends name and ‚Äújoin game‚Äù

Honestly, if you have a ping that high almost all the time you shouldn't play this game, doesn't matter if you want to. With a constant 300 ping you are making the game miserable for yourself and the other people unlucky enough to be matched with you. Even 100 is a pain in the ass for both sides, but 300 is no fun at all.

Everyone bitched about it being overpowered on such a good gun, truth is people are just salty. They talk like anyone could pick up ash acog and ace. It still required skill to use but obviously Ubisoft listens to bitchy kids instead of actual skilled players so.

Have you tried Installing the Year 4 Pass. That usually helps.

Actually a cool idea

IMO the stats should change if the mouse is over the differents attachment
---
It is definitely better anyway

It‚Äôs very vague, but it definitely implies that Cav‚Äôs a lesbian, which is a damn shame cause I‚Äôd definitely like to see a Cav and Tachanka relationship

Ah a man of culture! I use the LMG-E... best LMG in the game and absolutely underrated gun... 
---
M1014, R4C, 416-C, F2, P12, P9, SUPER 90, SASG, and Bucks DMR, approx 500 hours of gameplay
---
True. Good concept, though. I'd be behind it. 
---
Great do it for ubisoft
---
Only problem would be if you were on console. Right now you can just press down once or right to access all your attachments. Having to spam right to access each of them would be slower with already limited lobby time.
---
Agreed but this is just a concept
---
we spent the whole game tking each other.. I'm friends wit hall of them lol
---
Frost. Her guns are weak (Sterling is strong but super slow fire rate, her shotty is self-explanatory) and her trap is easy to spot and destroy WITHOUT her elite skin. I main her mainly because getting a down with a trap is ORGASMIC and she has my favorite Elite Skin.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm wondering the same thing... it happened to me literally 3 times last night alone... starting to get infuriating.
---
It's part of the game. I like them just fine.
---
Sony Vegas?
---
I honestly don't see the need to hide all the attachments though, just have everything visible so that you got time change stuff with 3 seconds left. 
---
Chunky's SMG is already a super good weapon. Plus Kapkan has the same gun, and we can't have any defenders faster then 1 speed with an ACOG, and as weapon attachments are per weapon, not per operator, giving one to Chucky will result in Kapkan having an ACOG.
---
Are you just salty you‚Äôre never able to type it yourself? It‚Äôs literally common in games, people are just being nice. I‚Äôve done it after 1v1s especially. 
---
YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!
---
I‚Äôm not sure. I think he‚Äôs complaining to complain as I‚Äôve noticed the new community does. Old siege community never bitched about this stuff. 
---
Idek anymore. What rank aer you?
---
Bandits was leaked a while back. Had a biker theme. Think he was bald and had a beard. 
---
I which they did this. Making the season Uniform camos available as Weapon skins would be great.
---
ultrawide 4:3 stretch has got t be the most fucked up resolution I have ever seen in my life
---
But it should get rid of the attachment you already have equipped to save confusion
---
Down to Gold 4 from Gold 2 today lol. Gave up and not caring now, just playing Solo queue from now without giving a shit.
---
Console or PC
---
Hell of F‚Äôs for this mistake 
---
Lmao. How is me saying something is toxic whining? It‚Äôs like saying team killing for no reason is toxic and then telling someone that they‚Äôre whining for being team killed for no reason.
---
Im a gold 3 but i only play ranked with a friend.

Big ole oof

They‚Äôre probably gonna wait on a Tackanka elite until after he gets his complete rework. Apparently gonna feel like a completely different op after. 
---
I like this, I'd also make it so that you can do this for every gun available to the operator in the same screen. I hate having to click in then out over and over again

Really starting to think a system needs to be in place for shit like this. Prevent people from squading up based on their rank.

This ain't just a problem with Siege. The extreme majority of gamers are disgusting, and its only getting worse. I almost exclusively play with private groups because of it.

Highest rank achieved

Fuck them boosters! Way to get that win 
---
Except I‚Äôm not lying? Dude are you alright or are you a bit fucked in the head?

The 1 hit headshot is one of the few things stopping this from becoming just a generic spray-and-pray shooter. If they removed it I would honestly stop playing.

hitreg, removing ACOG‚Äôs from all weapons except DMR‚Äôs, fixing all ‚Äútechs‚Äù, making time in between death and next round not so fucking boring, adding maps that mean something, adding interesting gadgets instead of just giving high fire rate guns,,,, etc
---
A good chunk of pro players aren't actually good at the game, they mostly just abuse the meta and even flaws with the game (like Ash's hitbox) to climb to the top. Actual technical skill or strategy is unfortunately not rewarded in the pro scene. 
---
I‚Äôd like it if they replaced the Operator Portrait in the select screen to a 3D model of the Cosmetics/weapons you have selected, and instead the menu would cycle through operator portraits in the pre-game lobby. 
---
Lmao what ranks are you playing in
---
R6 the only game that‚Äôll try to give u a stroke...I like it.
---
I use her AK with an ACOG sight and Muzzle Brake. Works nice for me.
---
That means the other team could figure a way in and you could not. üíØ on you for the L, not Castle. Evident your team was not communicating as well.

Around Gold 2 when this clip was made.

Yep, I believe it's 4/5, 3/4, 3/3, 2/2, and 1/1 needed to surrender

---
Outcome scoring is the only way to do it. 
---
Statistically speaking, with thousands of random match ups you would eventually see something close to a 50:50 win ratio. 
---
However, across those thousands of games, the *only* constant variable is *you*, which is why W:L is the best indicator of experience and skill. The higher your W:L the more your individual presence in a match can increase the odds of victory. 
---
I'd use it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really incompetent of them, no other game has this issue
---
They want you to play IQ, they took her jades away so they had to give her something.
---
No mask? ü§îü§®
---
My favourite part, except Blitz's sticker, is how just Kapkan's sticker looks completely pixelated
---
Serious answer-Fucking everything

Of course you're angry with IQ, mute main! :) 
---
That's fucking nice, I play on SA alot because bomb is a little too much for me on my own, and when there's 3 of us, still not enough. A 4 stack sometimes works and a full squad can take it, slow and difficult because everyone is a sweaty "gold" (probably silver 3, sweating=little to no skill) and they aids combo us all the rounds, and ppl in SA are retarded. It's fun IMO.
---
Hahahah it‚Äôs the same for castle (not on the case)
---
Its blonde, Australian, dirt bike riding Donut Operator
---
Maybe Tachanka is God: Lord Tachanka reference. 
---
Maybe they do some kind of bonus event where all the operators get costumes based on whatever character they have in social media.
---
My man blackbeard don't need another nerf k
---
Bruh wtf you were stood in that Claymore for the entire time you were outside then it finally detonates at the end and you take no damage.
---
I guess it could also be a security risk. If you were to store it in memorry and someone can add ACOG into it maybe so they have to read it from the server each time
---
Very true. 
---
Wasn't too potato. You're on console so it's harder
---
He was typing TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT enough times to reach the next line, and then typed my name to make people think I was typing it. And I wouldn't be pissed at that much, if he wasn't team killing me every round basically, destroying our gadgets and basically making us lose the game.

Extended Rant: Most people don't have all day to play a game, and sometimes we take out time from work to lay back and relax while playing a game we like. It's basically a matter of "I'll get back to work after a game or two", and when toxic kids (I don't believe anyone above the age of 14 can resort to being this no-life toxic piece of shit) like this, who have basically nothing to do in life right now waste our time and even more than that, spoil our complete mood - it leaves a sour taste in the mouth for the complete game and the experience that accompanies it. The team killing mechanic I heard about will do nothing against the other ways someone can propagate toxicity in the game. And unlike CS:GO, there is no way I can know that a person I previously reported has been banned. I tweeted to Ubisoft Support but it seems as if it's a completely dead account. This is not the first time my time has been wasted due to shits like these. I know it's not a perfect world, and there will be assholes once in a while, but I don't mind someone raging at me because he wants to win as much as I mind someone who doesn't respect either his time nor the time of 4 other individuals playing with him in some part of the world. 
---
A menu where I can easily change my loadout without clicking through three additional menu screens while the match is starting? Yes please!
---
When you vault through the barricade you can jump over the claymore since your feet are in the air.
---
There is a delay on the claymore when you trigger it. You get beep and then it explodes. So it explodes until he was already in, so he took less damage.
---
Thermite isn't the only hardbreacher
---
They added "Hibana" recently who can also destroy reinforced walls
---
Also "Maverick" who can even counter Bandit 
---
Rainbow 6 is fun but when it comes to customizing ops it‚Äôs menu simulator 2018
---
Just turn his shield upside down on the gun. Protects his torso so that you NEED to get a headshot on him. This gives him an advantage over potato aimers and means he is still balanced for people who can actually control their guns.
---
So. Fucking. Old. 
---
The saddest thing is, the guy that is complaining is probably in silver XD
---
More shitty op concepts in this sub
---
I'd definitely agree that when it launched into 1.0 it wasn't ready for 1.0. I think around update 24 was when it actually earned that merit. I know there are many other good Battle Royale experiences there which do many things better than PUBG, but there's a reason PUBG is still the most played game on Steam every day. I'd go as far as saying that the fact the game suffered such serious issues for so long and yet it's still got such a large and loyal fanbase is a testament to it's core quality of gameplay, which is difficult to dispute. Even folks from other games/other battle royales can admit that the gunplay in PUBG is unrivalled in the BR scene. There are many other places you could fairly criticise PUBG, but you'd be in a minority to disagree with that (inevitably someone will). Regardless, I think we agree about the original state of the game.
---
Obviously Rook eats them
---
What games had these kind of events? What Rabbids, AC? You can't name them, they came from Siege. Ubi is greedy, the community that defends these practices are worse. 
---
But he was stood basically in it for a hot couple of seconds, and only once he started moving away does it trigger, it didn't even do ANY damage, that was all bullet
---
Both
---
Can you elaborate how you made these?
---
was playing siege one day and heard a girl with a mic we played 3 games and i never said hey are you a girl, sent a friend request and we played a few more games then we ran into this 3 group and the first thing one of them says, ARE YOU A GIRL, grow up

This could work with cosmetics too if it was adjusted a little bit.

Coopers needed to help get ur rank up 2 needed 
---
Essentially the enemy team will send large amounts of data to your internet connection and overload it, causing it to freeze/shutdown temporarily and therefore disconnecting you from the game. Since you disconnected, you get penalized by siege for what the game thinks is you quitting. DDOS‚Äôer gets a win and you get a temporary ban from playing ranked
---
Yeah I thought they made all standard ops free 
---
No Cav :(
---
No, a desktop. Mid range one. 
---
The total download would be around 75GB. And the updates are mandatory. 
---
PS4. The PS4 community is really toxic when you get in the higher ranks.
---
Honestly, as much as I hate going against him, I don't have the hardest time going against him. Ive played him for a bit to see if he was really that good. Now yes on some of the more broken ranked maps like skyscraper and chalet, he will shred you, but on other maps, hes not as good. He has a slow switch time so you're at a disadvantage if they get the drop on you. Now I will agree I thoroughly enjoy playing maverick and hate going against him, He's much easier to deal with than other more annoying operators. I think hes only a beast in PL and CL but in ranked and casual, he's just another mediocre pick
---
I‚Äôm 13 and I still get yelled at or made fun of, even though I‚Äôm stuck in silver it still happens
---
My girlfriend has the same problem. The good part is that we usually play in pre-made teams so we TK the trash talkers every single round (usually we dont have this problem with the enemy team)
---
That was just a bad play on your part
---
Just be toxic back
---
Idk man might just be me, 25000 to unlock a new op
---
I personally prefer the AK with reflex and compensator, AK for close range and secondary for long range bc ya know, her secondary is a DMR
---
It will likely come out towards the end of year 4 in order to incentivise buying year passes in the future.
---
Oooh I like it 
---
I thought it was like 54 gb download and final size 75gb. 
---
you jsut cant handle the magic,accept it.
---
That‚Äôs not what that means dude, I don‚Äôt think you understand what your own argument is.
---
Yet yesterday I saw 3 diff dudes constantly dropping the n word through out the whole game. Nice job ubi
---
I can only imagine, best of luck to ya
---
Your gonna be using the car batteries for walls most the time so hust use nitro cell.
---
It depends on the season...but the updates are usually about 15 gbs every 3-4 months
---
I usually am, but I hate that it has to be that way. Everyone should be able to enjoy it.
---
I'm on PC.
---
It depends on you mate but I will say just don't buy Ela. Her guns are horrible asides her shotgun but have fun out ranging an Ash down a hallway. Her gadget is pretty shit at the moment and her secondary gadgets don't fit her playstyle in any way asides maybe the shield but that'll just be personal preference for when you try to hide. Her Scorpion has way to much horizontal recoil but the vertical is okay. I mean the horizontal recoil right now seems to be more random than anything so it's basically uncontrollable that way. Her shotgun is the best in the game in my own eyes but it doesn't do much for range and her pistol is...well it's a pistol which I'd still like to have some kind of recoil which it has none which can be good or for me who's played every other shooter his whole life it's not since I shoot slower and aim down more to compensate for recoil they have. But in the game they don't so it's pointless. 
---
Right now Ela is the worst trapper and the worst roamer in the game so I wouldn't recommend her anytime soon. I main her but that's only because I don't enjoy playing anyone else on defense asides from say Kapkan or Frost because for some reason I'm just naturally gifted with them. If you enjoy roamers stick with Jager or if you want to buy someone get Lesion since he's fucking annoying. If you like staying in objective get Maestro or maybe Echo since I've heard they're fun to play for that but don't quote me. Or if you like being support Kapkan doesn't hurt ya. But those are just my opinions so you can go off yours. Just don't buy Ela since she's also likely to get another nerf by Ubisoft even though she's never been given a buff and she's literally worse than Tachanka really. And knowing Ubi she's going to get her 7th nerf.

Looks like an interesting idea. Not sure how well it would work in game but it does look like it could be a pretty neat way to quickly equip attachments before a game.

Oh, this isn't 4:3? I', on ultrawide but i've never seen it so stretched even with 16:9 ratio on

In four months it‚Äôll be 2 years since Jager and Bandit lost theirs. In November it‚Äôll be 3 years since the SMG-11 lost its
---
No clue why some players are snowflakes.  Melting down at the idea that a girl can play the same game as a guy isn‚Äôt manly at all.  It‚Äôs being a whiny little 8!+‚Ç¨#.  Some dudes just need to grow a pair apparently :/
---
No, resolution scaling. It's different. If your scaling is low, everything will look blurry 
---
something is wrong with that bot
---
Has you switch to different options it should zoom in on that attachment. 
---
Think Ghost Recon: Future Soldier 
---
Teammates that fire their weapon when they aren't in danger or shooting drones are the fucking worst. Get a mic...
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to be put in mid game, because it‚Äôs easy renown if you‚Äôre winning and no pressure if you‚Äôre losing
---
There's different levels of darkness dude. Did you grow up underground? 
---
Flashlights wouldn't be anymore a must-pick than lasers are. You would have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of making the enemy more visible at the expense of making yourself more visible. This cost benefit calculation differs based on the map, operators you have already, your own personal playstyle preferences, etc. 
---
Shooting out cameras wasn't a strategy, until they added Dokk into the game. Now the team has to determine the costs and benefits of destroying the enemy cameras, or leaving them alive so Dokk can grant access to them and use them against the enemy. Oh look! A perfect example of how adding a new mechanic adds nuance to the gameplay. We see this again with the recent addition of Mozzie. 
---
You're way too hung up on redesigns anyway when people are just talking about what should have *stayed* from the teaser. Obviously redesigning will take work, which is why I'm saying that it should have been like that from the beginning. 
---
Also Blackbeard is already a menace on every map, but that's a different problem. 
---
I've gotten so many messages on PSN to talk on mic or they would throw the match. They want to see if my voice is "sexy" it's incredibly disturbing and grosses me out. I unfortunately named my PSN profile with my actual name (Kaitlin) so they know immediately I'm a girl. I actually made a new one so I just play multiplayer games on that one, so I could stop getting those messages.
---
 I play with some good friends though. I never speak on mic because I know ill get harrassed about it. I mean, I would love to communicate as a team but it's not worth the trouble if I'm just going to have people saying gross things to me. 
---
He‚Äôs not hard to counter. If he‚Äôs coming toward you, you will see there‚Äôs a shield on his face and you just flick toward center mass. If he‚Äôs holding an angle, don‚Äôt peek it and either flank him or use a nitro or something to kill him.
---
The guy I killed was in my party, the doc was just a solo queue probably in game chat and we were all in party. Chill out lmao
---
Well I'm able to get both of them I'm wondering if I should get them or go with other people
---
Not to knock you‚Äôre idea, but this is what lion should have been. 
---
Its 10 pm i am about to go sleep and i see this... i think i will have nightmares
---
That's awful! I play on PC, and I play a lot of ranked, so I have to communicate with call outs. Usually I just mute them or just don't team up again, but it's still so toxic for women and it's really unfair.
---
r/hmmm
---
Lmao you chill out. I was stating that I hate when people fire their weapon unnecessarily. If the doc doesn't know how to play doc then too bad.

You realize you‚Äôre taking a statistic fact and interpreting it in your own biased way right? Just because one team always wins and one team always loses doesn‚Äôt mean that the games are balanced.  That‚Äôs just how the game works. 
---
Just because a team wins and a team loses every time doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the best players are rewarded and the worst are penalized consistently. That‚Äôs the issue I have with it. Statistically yes everything should even out but that doesn‚Äôt mean realistically that it will for everyone, unless you‚Äôre comparing a single persons 10-15 hours of playtime a week to the entire community‚Äôs millions of hours of playtime for the entirety of the games release, which is exactly what you‚Äôre doing. Yes, theoretically if I played a million matches my rank would be accurately represented but guess what? I‚Äôm not, nor will I ever be able to play enough matches to be able to have my skill accurately portrayed by the ranking system as it stands today. There are WAY too many variables out of my own control for that to be the case.

So carefully orchestrated that operators actually signal each other, physically, in game! Yeah. There's no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the trailer was made in engine. Look at how immensely different the gameplay you linked is from this CGI rendering, it's like night and day.
---
For instance: Look at the way the main protagonist [skates up these stairs](https://youtu.be/J9p3vMcPVrE?t=291) as if he's just a floating camera. Or watch when he's shooting. A lot of the time it doesn't even leave bullet holes or affect the environment at all. The only time it does is when its relevant to the plot of the 'match'. How about when they breach the ceiling and the hostage actually picks up and throws a defender corpse off of her? Or how "Havoc" teleports from pool room to kids room in the blink of an eye?

Hell yeah

that‚Äôs not just on him. know your surroundings. you get banned after 2 TKs so it happened twice. it‚Äôs preventable

Isn‚Äôt it also because it needs to load the different models for each attachement in the preview

Shut up

He‚Äôs legit livid at you for not trying your balls off on THE MODE WITH FLUFFY UNICORNS, A TEDDY BEAR HOSTAGE, AND A GIANT PINK PLANE, even while only playing with your friends. Fuck that guy.

In my circle we call that Pokeballing.

Weird I have nothing to be salty about girlie.

Thanks

How is this solely related to console?

Hello GoogMastr! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**

You can't use text chat to ask doc for a stim
---
I've been having this problem a lot too.
---
He‚Äôs good at the game but that‚Äôs one of the most idiotic ideas I‚Äôve ever heard regarding this game 
---
Never thought that was possible. Tried it too but not with glaz i guess
---
Update the game with 4 major updates every year. Never gets old, but has a bit of a steep learning curve, and the community is pretty toxic, especially to new players. Get past that though, and you'll love the game.
---
/\/  /  /3  /3  /-\
---
It is still being updated, it comes out in seasons which is decent, it's best when played with others this doesn't have to be your friends it could just be other players both are good, it's way better with a headset too as you really need to communicate 
---
We seriously need this, both in operators menu and in customazations right before round start. 
---
Sorry AutoMod but I've already entered the hell and sunk my teeth into this game months ago.
---
No, yes, no.
---
Are you on console?
---
But it‚Äôs really most fun with friends 
---
Very good quality. What did you use?
---
Whoops!
---
Do you have anyone to play with so you can practice and get tips without being kicked?
---
Maestro has better guns but he is an anchor.
---
If you want to roam the get mozzie it‚Äôs all down to play style. But personally I prefer maestro 
---
I prefer people not using console completely .\_.
---
No
---
I am fond of 3 Speed Roamers but I like to Anchor once in a while
---
Idk what happened but it looks kinda cool
---
No because there are actual spray patterns for every single gun which take time and skill to learn unlike sieges method of spray and pray. 
---
Idk if ur EU but its been an issue over here server wide the whole day 
---
It was Illustrator and Photoshop. Used the assets from the R6 Fan Kit, and Illustrator to scale the logo using Image Tracing.
---
I have a friend who started with me, which is the only reason I still play at all tbh
---
but because hes just as bad as me he suffers from the same problems.
---
Hilarious Edit &lt;3
---
If you are, just two rules. First, through your experience of COD or BF out the window and learn about the map layouts and operators. Second, get used to ACOG because that is gonna be important. 
---
It's an impact grenade. As in an explosive charge meant to break things. It's not meant for just creating a rotation hole. And C4 is the exact same way. They are both used to deal damage to opponents. C4 has a bit more explosive mass to it, but they both still have killing potential. 
---
Think of it as a High Explosive charge and an Armor Piercing High Explosive charge. Both contain explosives  while one does a bit more damage. Both are meant to do damage but in different contexts.
---
 I dont see why you would remove the damage from an impact grenade. It's still a grenade that still uses chemicals to create destructive force. 
---
And breaching charges are different. Do you want them to not deal damage either since they're made to create a sight line and open walls? Or are they fine? 
---
IDK if this is possible with another weapon. But if you have a friends, you can check it in custom game.
---
Well no shit. He must have bought it back when it was a thing as did I. And I also had 6 operators but now i have 30 which is most of them(and I gotta say i totally did not love the grind, but whatever) while this pro gamer hasn't put in any hours since he got the game
---
Maestro, but that‚Äôs because I think that LMGs are overall better than SMGs.
---
What a better map than to use the old Hereford base as a firing range. Brings a little love back to the community and saves on resources.
---
Mozzi for sure
---
that's custom game, look at the time
---
What a legend
---
I'm down to play, although I'm usually on Xbox more than PC
---
**SCOUT INTENSIFIES**
---
Hope hes got a few stims left for that other guy.... RIP
---
I've seen them at my targets here in Cali too
---
Im trying to take a shit and now im fucking laughing to death 
---
Exactly
---
I love it. I love getting killed by people who don't even aim my head but just hipfire spray and pray around it. Veri unique, muh skill, we are esport bois. This plus the worst hitreg I've ever seen creates majority of problems R6 has.
---
I know that he ranks with friends, but also solo cues in casual. To be honest theres nothing bad you can say about him. First time i saw his stats i was like what the fuck. But watching him play showed me that he put thousands of hours into Siege to become such an amazing player. Hard work pays off. His aim is another level. I havent seen another player on ps4 that is so precise yet. 
---
I take it you didn‚Äôt read the edit
---
this is all good however they will likely add esports to the home tab no doubt as other games do this
---
I‚Äôm more memorized by your rank than the gun tbh
---
i mean if i tried to do that i'd somehow be the one dead
---
I know. 
---
You know I‚Äôm a big deal in the resistance
---
Nah, I read it.
---
LineKotsi : this is a work in progress
---
Someone such as myself: good enough to call finished

###Caps lock title

The title of your submission only contained capital letters and /r/Rainbow6 currently does not allow those titles because they impact the readability negatively.

Please re-post your submission using standard letters.
---
Like can the guy you killed really be mad lmao
---
they could have been better ops aswell aha 
---
It‚Äôs actually not. At all. You would literally have someone show you what to do rather than tell. And there‚Äôs no guarantee that the people on here know what they‚Äôre doing 
---
I mean, yea but then you could technically count any ace as a 1v5 even if your whole team is alive
---
Using fear to get what you want
---
Clubhouse (pre-rework) with frost. Hid on the balcony and got 3 in the traps and picked the rest off when they rushed in. 
---
How come
---
‚ÄúTake the stim, you earned it‚Äù
---
Or mute it and just play regular but yeah that would apply in real life situations
---
Oh
---
But now we have oversized stages thanks to updates that made the game smaller. The optimal way to play is 4 room 1 roamer for defenders and attackers open murder holes to hold angles until defense is in too awkward a position to cover room. Gameplay just feels cramped since it mostly takes place in a single room through peepholes instead of roaming an entire map plotting and trapping.
---
One time, MD invited me to Casual and a certain player in our team is really toxic to the others. This player TK'ed me on the next round because I failed at "easy" 1v1 clutch. MD immedietly pulled me out of the match and apologized for letting me see that.
---
Guaranteed to work against *some* humans!
---
Ewwwww red dot
---
Jk that‚Äôs a great costume
---
You have to give some more info like a map or operator. 
---
Whenever one of my friends get mad cus they‚Äôre doing bad I just tell them to click on the enemy‚Äôs head. 
---
lol
---
Where is the acog?
---
And this, children is why mics are important 
---
Exactly. They already have an actual range built and rendered. They could just have it launch that small portion of the map to reduce load times.

Hello oneCheezyboii, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bamet4/look_similar/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Bro. My hands were shaking. I do not like blitz at all.
---
Finka for the health or gridlock for the guns 
---
Pretty much my thoughts. Even with a mic, having this level of nuance with the ping system would help give verbal callouts a sense of space and location.
---
When retards pick doc and roam like dumbfucks. And use all heals on self first minute of a round. This is still a problem.
---
"JuSt ClIck oN tHe EneMY's hEAd" Lol
---
Yes replacing textures on a hostage game mode than just adding very few skins
---
Lmao tell me it doesn‚Äôt work though
---
Why does everyone just want ops to get nerfed and then when they‚Äôre useless you‚Äôll say they need a buff. Happens. Every. Time. 
---
Oh of course! Silly me! The mute button will stop griefing AND team killing, thanks for informing me!
---
What did it cost?
