no they GSG9 resemble SEK not the KSK. you honestly don't think Rook resembles these guys at all?

I’d say by the end of the season.
---
If you got shot with a bullet, would you flinch?
---
Then that is a slight overestimate by my guess. I think she could be back with the depshield v2 about halfway through this season or apon release of next season. Interesting thing is she is back in thunt.
---
historical but what about lesion?
---
Has to be ranked
---
Is he good?
---
Dank you
---
Console?
---
I get a lot of kills though walls. A lot is instinct and some luck. But you are also missing the other teams communication. It can appear they are cheating.
---
Plus hacking on consoles isn't easy like pc and I would argue no exostent. Ddossing can happen though
---
use reflex as it’s the small sight. and you need to ADS.
---
When I see old videos with this I immediately think it's fucking possessed.....and then remember, that's how they used to be. 
---
Ah. When something so normal soon starts to look evil...
---
I think so. Although i do enjoy a good battleeyeTM video every once in a while.
---
yeah I mentioned bug, I didn't know it was that bad that it caused the game to lag but thanks for telling me. Ubisoft should fix this ASAP but then again what do I expect when Clash and deployable shields still aren't in the game after a month.

---
Late night ranked I guess, I mean I've been diamond but I've seen plat 3s on my team since I was queuing at midnight so it just puts the closest mmr to reduce queue times from my experience. Whether it's intentional, I have no idea
---
its kind of like the g36 vs r-4c with ash, the g36 is not a bad gun, the r-4c is just better
---
Bit weird ngl.
---
Sorry i’m late
---
No bcuz im an epic gamer who takes bullets better than a trained soldier

So did I. But I'm a Hibana and Frost main

You can check my MMR if you want. Don't comment baseless bullshit.

Hacking is not possible on console.

Only DDOSing is possible.

You probably died to 3 speeds and got caught lacking so they droned you out and wallbanged you

Bernie is a mad lad for holding that angle without his turret shield

Are you on the same platform? You should wait until he queues and then try to get in his game. Then send him creepy messages.

Complete waste of dev time and an operator space.

My friend bought them off Amazon, he got an Ash emblem for himself
---
No, Teal is Plat now, Purple is Diamond

Hold up does your shit zoom when you ads?
---
I envy you so much. I don’t play Rook or Doc super often, but when I do I love playing as them. and I play buck all the time. he is technically my second main, behind thatcher
---
I trust, that this ceramic trauma plate that I’m wearing? Will protect me from a three-fifty-seven magnum round traveling at 490 meters per second.

God that's awful. Here in Spain we cannot buy beer past 10pm (from a store). It's just plain stupid and if you dont plan everything beforehand it ruins your night.

Part of me says yes and no, because aesthetically they look nice especially the marble ones on bank. But from a balance perspective it seems necessary as too many kills on railing are either from pixel peeks (which I'm fine with) or pure luck.
---
At least you have a fiance.

Why tho, plenty of other games have fov sliders
---
If you search up my username “epicfail40o800” I’m r6 tracker you can see I’ve been a steady silver but it’s been a bad week
---
I see echo / lesion banned more for defenders, and ying/jackal for attackers. 
---
But hey I'm copper 4
---
You could also get away with angled grip and flash hider since the flashhider is small and the angled grip dosnt change the look of the grip much at a distance
---
Being able to warm up with all operators on attack would benefit them aswell
---
Doc and rook s tier
---
And I’m trying to say ur not good
---
No beer past 10? Damn, who tf came up with that policy :D
---
Maybe they were in a party with one of the other plat players / queuing up together?
---
Honestly have no idea just throwing out ideas lol
---
That's not what an acronym is. RAM, NASA, NATO. These are all acronyms, the abbreviation is formed from the first letter of each word in the name, but is pronounced as a word, rather than by its individual letters, which would be an initialism (BBC, FBI, CIA).
---
Depends on your playstyle. Nomad is really good for denying aggressive defenders, gridlock has good Intel for attack, and alibi is a decent roamer I guess. Disclaimer, i am not a pro, and these are just my opinions.
---
Put up dead zone for stick drift it fixes it, I have it on my left analog (I put it up to 18) just to be sure hahaha.
---
I could have sworn I saw the guy moving a bit
---
Just wondering send it to ubi support they may be able to help
---
I’m stuff
---
If theres an opening to use these four i will take and grab it hard
---
I'm gonna go ahead and say it, you messed up when you used YouTube for an info source over -Google-, that's only on you and how you use the internet man. Plus shes only disabled until they fix the bugs on her, she was literally enabled a week ago before they took her out again because the bug was still present. Shes unplayable until shes fixed and even the slightest bit of research on her would have given you that info. With how much shit there is in this game, most of the community doesnt like answering questions that 3 seconds on any web browser would have, which is probably why other people are being so hostile

Overediting is just as bad. Did you really have to edit every single kill?

Nah, the only people who would care are kids too young to vote. And older voters would just resent it like most people over the age of 20 resent Fortnite for being too childish.

ew the arx has too much recoil and not enough ammo

DONT YOU EVER DISRESPECT THE MOUNTAIN LIKE THAT.
---
Welcome to seige
---
That may be it. I always play with friends.

If you get teamkilled just leave.
---
Isn't the video on fast forward?
---
it’s called POW or something like that. that’s be really interesting. I assume he’d have to have like raggedy clothes and rusty, beaten guns
---
Menus in R6 have great fps if you turn off V-SYNC. I play PS4 and my operator selection menu runs at 400+ fps
---
its part of a temp fix for the symbol chat fps lag bug people were abusing.
---
Bro, I haven’t gotten any of these in so long man the alpha pack system in this game is seriously a joke I get nothing but common and uncommon duplicates like wow fucking awesome.
---
I'm good I bought the game at full price and like to play it ya know plus free xp so i sit on my phone; they lost every round
---
Not enough ammo and too much recoil are excuses from someone who cant aim at heads

Like I could see that. I hate seeing those types of posts as well, but I didn't even ask anyone about it. No one had to respond to me and tell me things that I already know after the fact (that I won't be able to play her)
---
All I made was a request for them to make the UI more consumer-friendly, disabling a purchase for something you can't use. 
---
&gt; I'm gonna go ahead and say it, you messed up when you used YouTube for an info source 
---
I do it mostly because I'm a visual learner and I can learn the tricks and tips easier by seeing it in action and someone talking me through it as they do it. But yeah looks like I fucked up by not googling her.
---
But I did get some useful info:
---
1. Don't use the R6 Reddit.
---
2. Google a character before you buy it.
---
3. Contact support for any suggestions.

Oh yeah I'm so glad we have those people. I never said he was the sole problem. It's as much ubisofts fault as it is him and others who post it. I'm using him as an example because he's the most well known and gets the most views. Obviously there's always gonna be people publicizing it. But he is a major factor behind a fuck ton of glitches becoming well known. He's a cunt and anyone who publicly posts a tutorial on how to perform glitches like these is also... you guessed it, a cunt.
---
I do have to admit I love not being able to play ranked for half a season because someone uploads a video titled "Insane IQ glitch! Invincible, invisible" rendering the game unplayable on console. On pc it's fine because it gets hot fixed relatively quickly. But then you have to deal with the hackers on pc who also happen to be cunts. It takes for ever for glitches to get fixed on console. Hence why, I stand by what I said. I respect your opinion but I will continue to be pissed off with people like him because they render the game unplayable for others by doing what they do.
---
WOW
---
Those were the days
---
it’s recoil is too horizontal for me. the ak has higher vertical recoil but it’s easier to control for me because it’s predictable
---
Shoot. Is she unlocked in TH at least?
---
The Elites are a pure income method for the dev team since all the gameplay related content is renown unlockable/free, They will not make elites  a renown based unlock.
---
Ya you got it right. The scans wouldnt track moving targets only a single point in time so scanned people could move and change positions from their tagged hologram. The capture wouldnt capture a room but instead would just capture a very narrow field of what it was looking at.
---
Thanks for the feedback it means a lot! :D
---

I like em BIG

The AK just hops around wayy too much for my liking, arx reminds me of the mk14 which is why i love it
---
Cartinese is not allowed
---
kinda. yes. like lion but holographically 3d.
---
I have that charm too I love it so much
---
Probably to encourage people to use the other options available. It's why they nerfed Ash, to get people to use the G3 (and because people were bitching about her acog for no justifiable reason)
---
I'm plat on xbox and the only other op I see banned other than these is lesion

could be bad luck.  I got legendaries just yesterday.  It was a shitty charm, but still.

:'(
---
You should just practice your aim and if you feel like gunfights are your weakpoint maybe play something like doc or echo on def and thatcher bb on att since you dont need to be agressive with those ops, you can just stand away from the fight
---
Same
---
I assume you play on PC then my friend
---
I used to be a jackal cav main, but I eventually moved onto other characters and have become pretty good again. I believe in you man
---
Okay👌🏼
---
That's why I feel instead of nerfing its damage they should have pulled an ash on doc and took. Mp5 loses acog but p90 keeps it. Acog om defense is mostly just used for spawn peaking anyways which on every gun that has acog on defense except the mp5 and mp5sd is hard cause of the guns recoils. The p90 has low damage too on top of it but over all the alda tcsg12 and 44 mag semi all have recoils that can make it harder to hit targets over 20 meters with more the 1-2 bullets
---
Sledge crawling made me lose my fucking shit

What VM did you use?

Get this skin from alpha pack

In SEA server thatcher get ban more than blitz. Cuz most of blitz player in SEA so bad to rushing

Oh god

When Twitch takes out the default cams instead of getting the ADS.

It’s been tough for me because I noticed I rely too heavily on optics. Since Prismas don’t copy Alibi’s loadout, I run bone stock everything. No optics, no camos, not even a charm. And I’ve had a fun time with varying degrees of success and failure for playing Italian Roulette. My favorite was playing house and I had master bedroom with a couple of prismas. Ash blindfired through the window barricade and tagged a Prisma and before she could get in to the room I stood on it and just stared at me. It felt like a good solid amount of time and we shot at the same time, only she shot the prisma on the floor. Good times for bamboozle
---
I thought she was going to be gone until the mid season patch
---
I got something similar but it didn’t say it was going to be reviewed. With all the n bombs people drop in game in pretty sure whatever I said was pretty benign
---
I'm currently using 55 75 30 with the new curve and feels pretty good. 
---
Before that tho I ran 45 45 30 before I switched to higher sense. Might work for you
---
What did you say?
---
Just wow
---
I mean I just played like 5 games with her after the update today
---
Idk I havent played at all today
---
Reported this is over sexual
---
It's easy on console too
---
While this is true it still isn't that great to have them in the game in their current form.
---
My friend keeps hitting at 8-9% and rubbing it in Bc go up to 30-45 constantly and get whites (yes probably half the time I don’t get to roll but we all share the frustration right)
---
\-and is set to normal
---
Had a game like this, originally I thought it was the other team then the guys that I solo qued with starting saying stuff like plant the Bomb then boost the server. I uploaded the videos on youtube and reported it to ubisoft.
---
I would bring your horizontal up and keep your vertical the same just do it subtlety over a long time to get used to it

Problem is when those road to copper bunch does it with 3-4 people and surrender the game while fucking over the solo player
---
Thank you I thought I was the only one
---
Yeah that would be balanced. Thanks for the suggestion for the game!The game is at the lowest it has ever been so a cool update would be nice :)
---
Hibana But a trap
---
Which is which. Obviously cav is death but who is blitz or echo.
---
This is why I don't understand maining tbh (yes I have mute main flair but only because I like the character)
---
If an operator I feel like playing this match gets banned then I just play someone else, no big deal
---
Nah, that would be too cool.  We don't do cool elite skins anymore.
---
Honestly it’s the only gun I think needs a nerf.
---
Last time I got a legendary was a year ago. I swear I’m actually not joking. I got the legendary from the alpha pack anniversary which makes the whole thing even sadder:(
---
Running fo12 every game
---
There’s no surrender button on PS4
---
Lmg gang?

Big kid time eh
---
You made one on your own face.

The awareness is really what impresses me here

Jackal and echo are super easy to counter... I'm confused

I would kill for Black Ice on Glaz’s DMR/Sniper
---
I don’t have black ice on his shotty though
---
-Finka
---
-Gridlock 
---
- maestro
---
-maybe Maverick
---
 Those ops made me feel lame that they exist in game. 
---
Sorry UBISOFT.
---
Better than wasting that solo guys time with more rounds they are going to throw anyway. They are fucking him over more by playing out an inevitable and planned loss
---
nah.
---
I switch between ACOG and Reflex. Depends on the map and what I’ll be doing, it does look super clean though
---
I use a reflex actually. Mostly because I’ve been getting House a lot recently
---
I would’ve killed myself on the spot if I got a charm from a legendary pack that I got on 2 percent.
---
☹️
---
I guess you could say that's his highest point
---
Blindingly bright days actually
---
haha very epic gamer
---
I have that same charm
---
Also known as, retards.
---
#####I think you improved her elite.
---
I get so frustrated when my team surrenders when the match is  3 to 3. Why the hell surrender
---
Why hasn't anybody seen this yet
---
cus, you know...
---
;)
---
True but , that's how we got Rainbow is magic.
---
Since our purchases in-game go towards funding R6S itsself.
---
Very wow indeed
---
I wish the rest of the siege community was this nice
---
Why tf did you make them yellow? Aren't alpha packs only white?
---
Forward slash back slash 3. Jk hopefully they fix the issue with it soon
---
Who made these fucking things???..... my wife ......
---
Nah they won’t ban us for that right? Like they know that means love
---
Can you get uniforms from alpha packs?
---
Better graphics, a much smoother gameplay ( espacially with a high refresh rate monitor) and it feels much better to aim with a mouse. I have a Ps4 and played r6 about 2 years  on Ps4, last year i have build my own gaming Pc ( wqhd, 1440p ,144hz, and freesync  make a big diffrence in gaming experence). Since then i played only two times again on the ps4. Same with gta ... i cant play gta online on ps4, because it only runs with 30fps and looks awful (like a slideshow)
---
He is correct, you are pretty toxic.
---
I mean, if you genuinely want this and aren't gonna be back in time to get it, shoot me a message
---
When they say the EDDs are ineffective show them this
---
What do you play on?
---
Jk I like zofia cuz of her ability and her gun and for defense I main lesion cuz his ability and I like to roam with him
---
Agreed. The MCX is a pretty cool platform.
---
Whenever I fire the first shot with the Pro90 it’s a headshot.  10/10 best gun in Siege.
---
Agreed, if they add a skin that blends in pretty well, it could possibly be P2W.
---
BRUH just press the option button and you’ll see it lmao
---
Lol today I chose rook for once and aced with the p90 after being afk half the round
---
that looks so cool ngl
---
bruh 😜🍑👅👏👏
---
Did he win
---
🙈
---
This made me raise my eyebrows and say "nut" in my head.
---
Then they play recruit. What exactly are you asking?
---
you can’t pick recruit
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
---
In case anyone was wondering what was on my head, its actually dried paint we managed to peel from the bucket you see on the right.
---
Yeah, theres a gimp, and then theres Gimp, a image manipulating software.
---
Oh yeah. Clearence level.
---
A major part of esport or proL level gaming tournaments is reading and understanding the rules of the game.
---
This isn't a surprise gotcha ruling. It's a well known rule that you can't use those perticular uniforms in pro level games. Hell even your standard $100 over the weekend coms have these rules.
---
If you don't want your team to be at a disadvantage. Read the rules and foow them
---
Realistically, ACOG doesn’t actually have any magnification.
---
but if you choose to not buy an op then what
---
Bruh
---
Noice
---
Who the fuck goes like 40 levels without buying an op?
---
Dam bro is that a smurf acc or something? Lmaooo
---
30* and someoje testing this
---
TB completely honest it does suck but at least it is only acquirable thru playing the game, and not swiping you card
---
Okay. Let me know the results.
---
Stay calm, have fun. Don't push for every game to be a win, you'll just be disappointed. Don't squad up with people who can't do that either, because you'll just end up hating the game. It ends up like a nice grind to finish every side quest
---
Xbox
---
lol love it

not testing it i play console

The Tom Clancy games have crossed over with one another frequently, and share tech. Elite Squad also puts them all in a shared world. It's not unrealistic to believe they are in a canon shared universe.

That doesn't nerf the defenders ability to defend at all... Yes, when you're in base claymores, nomads, and teammates can help. 99% of defense happens inside, so, defenders aren't nerfed. 
---
I'm talking about the BS early game runouts or the ones where they run out from a mile away and have sooo much time to get across the map before it warns you.

Bullets can shoot outside still. Attackers aren't safe outside. People just can't exploit a broken system.

It’s toxic on PC as well.

it would’ve been next level if everyone had an elite skin and black ice

She’s back on ps4!
---
is he good
---
lol Valk didn't know what was coming.
---
Wholesome post.
---
a cold gaze from a cold operator, very nice.
---
the P90's main strength is its close quarters potential in my opinion, it has one of the tightest hip fire spreads in the game, i only use an acog on it because anyone at closer range than i need an acog for can be hipfired
---
don't really know about the mp5 i don't think ive ever used it without an acog
---
Oops.
---
*Lesion disliked that*
---
&gt;Didn’t give me the opportunity to rejoin match I progress.
---
Why would it? You were the last enemy on your team, the match ended as soon as you left,win by default
---
Lol, true true, lesion too, I should have made him splinter!
---
Every competition game has this happen when there’s some kind of social status attached to a rank or position
---
I was literally just watching spider-verse
---
His special is sniffing petrol that makes him 4 speed, and if he gets cut off the dole he goes into rage mode causing 20% more damage.

I’m not sure when this photo was taken but I just lagged out of a game too. I think the servers are just being shitty lately.

This has nothing to do about the post or what you or I said

New camo uniform for frost? 👀👀

It doesn't matter where it happened. It's tasteless, childish, hateful, racism.
---
They could also just be completely new to using a controller/first person shooters. I had someone in a casual match who was even worse than this, he took about fifteen seconds seconds to adjust his aim, and team killed me while I was sitting there watching him I assume because he thought I was an enemy
---
rule 9.
---
I actually never knew that
---
He TK’d the round before and was a dick afterwards
---
omg fucking genius
---
No, it’s just way I did the edit because this was ridiculously far away
---
What if he was trying to write "Night king is coming" and now nobody gets the warning they needed
---
Because I'm not okay with casual racism?
---
Stop defending casual racism
---
yes but i like to call him noop
---
I remember my very first alpha pack was a legendary. And i thought it set the standard for the rest of them. Only recently have i started getting black ice and other epic and legendary
---
cav not even a problem it’s should be lesion
---
same.
---
like he said
---
I assume you mean recruit so whatever.
---
It's because recruit doesn't have a gadget and that's seen a bad thing... I guess.  Plus he doesn't have sights.
---
Actually OP is on console this is just like that glitch with bandit shooting people with his batteries he’s not actually hip fire leaning hibana is aiming then leaning but it’s not showing the ADS animation
---
use your teammates as bait / meat shields - blind fire your whole clip - then run away
---
Amazing... Everything you just said was wrong.
---
Nice
---
I’m doing a challenge with friends to comment, but you can only look at the title
---
Nope. Level 150's+ always complain in Plat. They just refuse to learn the game. Their aim has carried them through Gold but they have the gamesense of a towel in the dryer.
---
I see you’re a man of culture as well
---
I never said anything about it being a "gotcha" rule. Only that the way the penalty was applied was a little bogus. I mean, Flack even called it on himself to begin with, most likely realizing that he forgot he had the skin equipped.

They are considered a threat for their stupidity

Gridlock and Mozzie can use it.
---
I meant in game, submitting an angle bracket is censored in game. And if you meant to search the subreddit, I found no such other mention.

When you see that you should just accept your fate
---
Definitely above.
---
I'm a simple ~~filipino~~ man, I see filipino operator ideas for R6S, I click and upvote
---
Wowwwwwww
---
If you encounter a hacker in ranked you get your elo back. Also ping abusing doesn’t give an advantage anymore because shots and movement is registered server side
---
Even among one of the most toxic communities
---
If you want obsidian skin, just get your weiner tattooed.
---
damn imagine that happening to you i would rage quit if i was the valk
---
Yo, that drone is PISSED.
---
I wonder if R6S matchmaking systems prioritize between rank matching and ping matching
---
so they'll sacrifice rank matching for a better ping match
---
what would you do for a klondike bar ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
its actually not that uncommen to have that urge after playing siege, me and my friends have the same
---
"laser beam" "headshot machine"
---
You're ticking all the boxes for something you don't know anything about. Almost all the 1x optic SMGs have recoil that is easier to control than the MPX. Does the MPX have little recoil? Yes. But most SMGs have even less.
---
The MPX is one of the worst defender SMGs. Valk is your main, so you might be a bit biased, but the fact remains that it's pretty bad.
---
Bit of a fun fact - old Dust Line release MPX had 975rof at 33 damage. It got nerfed down because Valkyrie was pretty busted.
---
If you scroll down in the chat r/alexthegame17 apparently has an original copy.
---
I like doing the same thing with Kapkan traps. Late in the round, attackers start moving around a little more recklessly, boom.
---
That would be nice but man, I can see so many peeps killing themselves with frags.
---
The hilarious cost for a potentially good QoL change.
---
Since it was through a wall the penetration divider must have made the damage less than 120
---
Summed up my teammates in R6
---
So... you looked for a ranked match and... joined a ranked match? What exactly is wrong?
---
That looks like copper II, but your monitor colors are not accurate
---
Look at the bullet streams
---
Unfortunately Ubisoft don’t have the ability to move content between platforms right now. You could try asking support and explaining your situation but it’s very unlikely

---
Ni
---
You would have. Talk to support.

---
The acog is the only zoom optic in the game that isn’t already attached to a weapon. The zoom allows for a better acquisition of targets at range.
---
Hibana main too, checks out
---
When I bought new phone I just submitted a ticket they will not give u any codes cuz they can't but they will disable the 2 step so u can redo it. I would recommend using email to get the codes rather than the google app. Much easier and when u get new phone there won't be any problems in the future.

---
that's so dumb. I'd get it if it was on the same strength as the spas 12 or super 90 but nerfing a shotgun that u already had to put in effort to kill with is rarted. classic ubi balancing I guess.
---
Yeah. Thank fuck
---
As an attacker your job is hard enough, your essentially going up against  enemy's that just get to have every peak advantage bc you have to push them, the Acog, can alloy this advantage to sometimes be fair and nulled,  however like another user commented saying a rant about the acog without ever using  it is a bit silly, try it out, even if you hate it. You need to understand it to make a discussion about why you dislike it.
---
I don't care about your fucking toxicity . I miss outbreak mode
---
Maybe its on read only

How much time you had to wait for a reply?

You should file a complaint with the internet police, maybe they will shut it down for you
---
Right click on the ini and press properties then there you should be a box to untick

I'd probably end up sticking with the MPX, even if I hate the bloody thing, the advantage of faster ADS times is more important to my playstyle with Warden.

---
That wasn’t hard to find xd, get help before it’s too late dude. Real life has consequences a little harsher than 7 day R6 bans. Also please look up the history of FBI actions against black organisations, because these statistics aren’t as infallible as you want them to be.

---
Last time on: *Essays Explaining Why I’m Not Guilty*
---
You can’t just say that a word has no meaning because it’s overused, insults wouldn’t be a thing, so calling you a racist wouldn’t get your panties in this much of a wad.
---
If you weren’t a racist, you’d avoid the use of racial-slurs as their very usage is treating an individual differently based on their race. You wouldn’t naturally call a White person by a slur (used to degrade someone) intended for Black people, therefore by your own “definition” of racism you are a racist. Societal norms make it obvious that racial slurs are faux pas, so it should be obvious to yourself that using them (even in casual conversation) is wrong.
---
I believe it was sarcastic.
---
Idk why they don't just make the broken parts have no collision with the solid parts so it just falls through it, Would be a simple fix for now.
---
This clip should be in the hall of fame
---
“I’m not racist cause nothing has any meaning anymore”
---
I'm really sorry and I don't condone of the actions of smoke in this video but I think you being offended is especially fitting coming from a capitao main.
---
Oh I’m dealing with someone who thinks FBI crime statistics are some how racially bias great 
---
I would get it if you said maybe 1 or 2% are racial profiling or some shit like that but,
---
13% commit 50%? Like wtf American cops aren’t as racist than you think dude
---
I’m not offended, I’m disappointed. But go off
---
Bro same here 1 every 10 matches they turn it on and off of course. Its a joke
---
He is joking mate

Reinforced walls haven't been changed. There are plenty half sized reinforced walls in some objectives but that's always been the case for balancing and has been since the game originally came out
---
I h8 it its easy to counter but sometimes you happen to be against a team who literally hold every window just to spawn kill you and its a bit hard to counter.

Well thats pretty belloni

I don’t have a problem with them dont giving a fuck about what I‘m doing. I can do whatever I want so why should I complain :p

They already released some preliminary patches in the last 2 seasons. It's a long and ongoing process.

Today I will show you how to defend your house against capitalists

Are you confused by the concept? Breast feeding is something that mothers do when they love their children.
---
When their child is a shitbrained homunculus though (a la you) she typically tries to drown it in a river, resulting in brain damage.
---
Then that child comes online and starts throwing generic teenager insults like "mental retard".

Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.

“Standard” you mean the imperial system? The system that the USA uses. The same country the PENTAGON is in??

So you mean all of the USA are common folk? That is disrespectful man.
---
Yeah, no repercussions so far, but it got me thinking since I got banned a few times for words I didn't even know had racial connotations.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
It’s Maestro, all u really have to do is put down your evil eyes, don’t touch them the whole game and walk around yeeting people with your LMG
---
I thought the exact same when I saw it, never really had the urge to get a PL set but I saw Mozzies and was like Oh Dammmnnn
---
You had a few games with cheaters. Either on your team or on the enemy team.
---
Whichever one fits your monitor's aspect ratio.
---
Yeah, I never understood why they reworked Hereford Base during Grim Sky but not this map or Favela.
---
Can you only play T-Hunt?
---
Do they have servers for playing PvP? Because I'm packing my bags already.
---
You played for 6 and a half hours? Jeez dude.
---
I'm going to buy the Mozzie one as well, because I main him and it looks good.
---
It's a sum total
---
if you play with a cheater and lose against a cheater back-to-back, the difference will be small when they remove both matches from you mmr history
---
Yup. This map has a great basis. Could be a great map
---
Yes I think we need a pulse buff to match the pentagon
---
Nope, you literally fall straight through it.
---
Seasonal Skins are not universal.
---
I’m an American. I use the standard system as well. My job does not require such precise measurements. 
---
Let me ask you this, what seems more precise? 
---
1/16 of an inch or .1 centimeters. 
---
1/16 of an inch is converted to an infinite digit decimal point. 
---
.1 centimeters is just that. Simple. 
---
It’s not about being disrespectful, it’s basic math. Lmao.
---
nice
---
Yeah but siege doesn't have a separate stat for penetration. All that stuff is just grouped together under the damage stat.
---
He just needs lasers, they don't have to do anything just look cool
---
Great thank you! 
---
I only play at night so I'll be hitting you up later today (its 11.00 am here, south America). Are you from the UK?

Better than my mates. We drone the fucker out, "Ok I'm buck, so I'll go below and make some holes underneath him, John and Mike rush from the left on the count of three, Pete and Tom from the right (Also on the count of three).

Everyone runs in, while Tom and Mike both through flashbangs, disabling my entire team but not the defender. So I'm stuck below trying to figure out how to get a grenade in at the correct angle.

Good one sir ! As long as it's not Kidsroom...

"You want a blackeye in bedroom?"

You too
---
Seeing what they did with the rework to Kafe I think they can do a decent rework to Barlett.
---
I recommend the deluxe edition if you're buying on steam it is a very good deal, you get all year 1 operators, all the vanilla ops as well
---
It only did 112 damage. since you have 100 +20 hp even if he just took the hit without stimming. He would have been able to revive himself to 75 (or whatever it is).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But yeah this is still better since now who ever threw the grenade isn't going to throw another one there. Probably.
---
It is actually easy to unlock the starter operators.
---
Theoretically, you would only need to play around 30 Casual Rounds (about 8 hours) to unlock 8 starter operators. (6k renown) (renown is the ingame currency) 
---
But since you'll have some Situation missions to complete, assuming that you'll get 400 renown each round, you'll probably have enough renown in just a couple of hours to unlock 8 operators.
---
AND you have weekly challenges
---
AND you have a one day renown booster
---
So, save your 2 pounds.
---
"""Small"""
---
Ohhh okay, the hipfire makes a lil more sense now too.
---
I knew it all along! That is why headshots never work for me!
---
Id like to know this too, i didnt like the feel of updated at all so i keep my setting “classic”
---
It's to keep people from spamming it and making the whole lobby lag it looks like studders but it's not your computer if people spam it
---
Playing and dealing with it &gt; moving onto another game because you can't deal with it &gt; becoming a cheater and justifying it.
---
and I don't want to coldly pretend like it isn't devastating to watch this kind of thing happening, I hate it too (in fact XIM4 straight up destroyed one of my friendships), but please just don't stoop.
---
I’d love to give it a watch, it says video unavailable though.
---
That's the reason. You answered your own question
---
You get all the year 1 operators is what I mean. And that is a lot more than 6k renown?
---
“This video is unavailable”
---

And I don't think that him roaming is a big deal, Ying's flashes never felt really fair. Attackers already have a great advantage on drones, better weapons and explosives.

You should start, yes. Also your casual stats are pretty good! But, as I'm a solo queuer too, know that the voice chat is the most important tool, communicating in ranked is the key. Even if you aren't very skilled, callouts surely are helpful for the team. If you are felling not playing well, pick an operator with passive ability (mute, bantit, jager) or in attack drone more before doing something. Hope I helped!
---
5th post within the last hour alone, we noticed

Your back is strong

Good job!
---
As Rook : "Who didn't take his protection?"
---
The person in this video. It was also fun because you could catch impact based
---
Damn. Never thought about that
---
Dude WTF is that
---
Well I only thought about the starter operators. Since each of them cost at the beginning 500 for each CTU, you can buy 4 ops with 2k
---
now, the second one of each ctu will cost u 1k renown. so, that's 6k
---
Both?
---
My first one was Infamous Second son, the game was really fun for me and you could do an achievement within like an hour unlike most platinums that are near impossible to get.
---
Lmfao. Nice!!
---
Then I'll just have to wait it out, I guess. It's not like I'm a complete noob, I've been playing for almost a year. I just think the main thing is that it's absolutely terrible being solo and on console at the same time.

Perhaps stretch the suspicioncount integer to multiple games and make it more than 3 suspicioncounts. And maybe also add something that lowers the persons suspicion count if that person does something that is clearly not cheating this pseudocode has more variables n shit so hopwfully this isnt tok complicatrd. There is an additional variable that will ultimately ban the player. (The explanations are in the comments i put)
---
So like
---
Int sample_text =0;
---
Int xd = 0;
---
Int laststraw =0;
---
//checks for headshot. If not headshot, xd increases
---
If(player kills someone &amp;&amp; !headshot)
---
{
---
Xd++;
---
//if consistently misses head, suspicioncount lowers.  
---
//and xd resets to 0, repeat
---
If(xd ==3)
---
Suspicioncount--;
---
Xd =0;
---
}
---
If(player kills someone &amp;&amp; headshot)
---
Sample_text++;
---
//if consistently hits head. Increase suspicioncount
---
       {If (sample_text &gt;= 3)
---
             {
---
                  suspicioncount++;
---
                  Sample_text = 0;
---
              }
---
}}
---
If(wallbang kill)
---
{Sample_text++;}
---
If (wallbang headshot)
---
{Sampletext+=2;}
---
If (sample_text &gt;=3)
---
{Suspicioncount++;}
---
//if suspicion count hits 3 laststraw goes up one. 
---
//Last straw will only decrease if player doesnt hit 3 suspicioncounts for the next 2 games. Once last straw hits 3 the player gets perm bannrd i was too lazy to write the rest of the code as my thumbs are getting fatigued (i typed this on my phone)
---
if(suspicioncount &gt;=3)
---
{Laststraw++;}
---
This one time, at band camp
---
I think the thing about the siege weapons is that as they branch forward with new ops it’s hard to bring a new gun every time as many guns are very similar or are overshadowed by a superior existing weapon. Lion’s vector could probably be made, realistically there wouldn’t be much of a point though. You’re super right there
---
Thank you!
---
What was always a thing? Throwing back grenades? They removed that in Grim Sky or Wind Bastion.
---
Improvise, Adapt, Overstim.
---
Oh okay well it is still an allright deal if I get the year 1 operators right? It sure seems like it
---
This is a fix to a bug in which if you fill up team or all chat with a character like &lt;,&gt;,\,etc it lags everyone on the entire server.
---
I know the maps really well, camera spots, all hatch locations, where breakable floors are, different routes to the objective, etc. 
---
Biggest concern for me is that I don't know if solo ranked on console is going to be enjoyable or not. It's really just the players that are my main issue, I've heard Ranked is not as bad as Casual, but still pretty bad in itself in terms of toxicity.
---
That last beam of that table, blocked Dokkaebi’s player model I guarantee.
---
Have u thought that the only reason u got that many kills is because ur teammates sucked?
---
I like your idea for the buff a lot. I feel like she's just fragging power instead of actual tactical use. Maybe instead of a Max of 5 gadgets she can do 3 and the gadgets won't be disabled but instead they are "turned against " the defending team. Like mute jammers would mute the defenders and bandits wouldn't shock the attackers. They would give some prompt that they are switched but it would make the idea more interesting. It would force defenders to be on their toes as IQ could cause a distraction with that kind of ability.
---
I think she is good as she is rn all i would do to her is give her impacts back instead of the barbwire
---
Could’ve killed him since he didn’t have rook armor no?
---
Υep my one has it as well you can play custom games and t hunt only
---
All it takes is one smurf to throw off the balance of a ranked game. Plenty of those around.
---
This happened to me last night! What happened the rest of the round?
---
I’m actually pretty sure it was due to team kills from throwing grenades, not from a confusing game mechanic. If it was confusing it would be in battlefield or CoD
---
like a champ?

Hello Ainsley_Harriott8, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c6mb6j/a_bug_or_a_feature/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
You know they were mad after that lmao.
---
I’m talking about atleast TWO kills in 0.5 seconds. That’s just impossible to achieve for a regular player, even when it’s instant click on head.
---
There shall be justice.

Oh oop, missread

we will watch your career with great interest

Hey what is this tracker? Is this in the game itself or something else?

Twitch lookin' mighty ***thicc***.

Rook looks like he is ready to spawnpeak 5 people out of existence.
---
why are people downvoting you lmao
---
They did something with the &lt;&gt; symbols, because people have been spamming them in chat and causes lag. Saw a post yesterday where someone did the &lt;3 in chat and they got some red message had been reported for behavior. I would just not use them symbols no more

Method no longer works.

WTF is that game mode

Then that’s their problem dw bout it then
---
“Old clip” literally April
---
What is that setup....
---
No, it doesn't. It's just a lame "prototype" made by a student and inflated to a level of an "actual weapon" by some C-tier journalists.
---
It was never actually manufactured, just forget this painful abomination of a weapon. Even weird V308 is not as pathetic as this garbage.
---
As a person who truly loves Russian weaponry I was hurt when I saw that Ubi chose this shit over the dozens of great, iconic and actually existing guns. AN-94? SR-2? AK-15? AEK? A545 family? Nah, let's just fucking make a toy gun from a dollar store, looks perfect.
---
Yeah I do a lot. I don’t have to worry about Blitz and Jackal anymore. The only downside is that my Cav gets banned almost every game
---
In game states, known facts, as well as my own and many others testings.
---
With the recent changes since April in R6, I’d say it’s pretty old. Just my viewpoint.
---
Due to the the 3 round rotations, where you will play on one side for 3 rounds, that side will most likely ban the most potent operator, such as Mira, to try and help them win all three of the attack rounds so they have the advantage.
---
Similarly, if you are playing on defence, odds on, you could keep a lesion or Mira depending on who the attackers ban, and ban an operator to help you win those three rounds. It’s about thinking and adapting to the system, so if these are the most banned, you might wanna think of starting to switch to other operators.
---
Nope. Ubi has a list of people who have a higher “Ubicredit”, the rating system designed to punish those that criticize the perfection that is rainbow six. To sum it up, Ubi hates you because you are a bad person and is punishing you justly.
---
It’s just the preference of the players they hate playing against such influential ops like lesion you don’t want to deal with or most often we ban Jackal because roaming and being tracked is bothersome so it’s more just bans on characters that make it harder for a team
---

if you press the home button, and press the select button, you can record the last 3 minutes. from there you can go onto your laptop, pc, phone, anything. and upload it into your hard drive, from there you put that into the reddit post and we don’t have to see your set up.
---
Doing the math it looks like the grenade did 112 damage because you over heal to 140 and have 28 left over, you do the math. Theoretically he could have tanked it, gone done (because of the 20 health Dbno threshold) and revived with the stim shot giving him more health.
---
Excusez-moi, quoi de niquer?

Ah ok thanks

---
Damn, what kind?
---
I'm going to make more. Which operator next?
---
Well, I got freaked for a sec but two of them had ragequit last round (one of them was the blitz, who left the game after I headshotted him with kaid's shotgun, lol), so it was a easy round.

The ones on the right could see him as soon as he started engaging his left. The could have killed him immediately. Just because they tried to knife him doesn't mean the entry was flawed.

Exactly. It's not like many other CTUs in game where developers don't have a wide choice of guns to choose from without ruining the "realism" (yeah, I know, they don't give too much fucks about this anyway but let's imagine they do). It's russian CTU, a country have a fuckload of weapons in any class. Need SMG? Take this PP2000, PP19, AS Val, SR-2, SR-3, etc. Assault rifle? Here's whole AK family for you. DMR? Sniper rifle? Choice is as wide as possible.

I know how to use other ops so I don’t really have a need for that. I have a fairly large pool. I just prefer my mains.

It's the internet grow up you ass. You think I'm going to cry after being told I'm a console pleb? Even though I do play both platforms. I'm not going to cry because someone thinks they're the center of the world. Because that's one idiotic and two you mean nothing to me personally. Your words have no intellectual background. They added nothing to the conversation in any way necessary. Grow up and learn to accept other peoples opinions, something that many people can't do which is the reason this world is as fucked as it is. Go learn a thing or two that isn't just saying that because you mainly play this platform which has more users, and support than another that they're bad at everything.
---
Yeah I agree I feel that you have to pick the same angles as if you are using a shotgun with her because of how bad the SMG is at range.

Then you don't know ubi

It rarely comes in useful, often she gets headshot or follow up tapped before she can do anything.
---
Breathtaking
---
This is a part of the reason why i kinda dont like the RFF system. This shit happens all the time no matter what mode u play. It used to be just shoot through the fucker and get the kill (usually this is the most effective because if u stop shooting in an effort to not shoot the teammate, the teammate 9 times out of 10 gets obliterated and then u die cuz u stopped shooting) but now if its already happened and you've gotten RFF activated, then they stand in front of you and you end up killing yourself and then the teammate dies and u lose. And yes, usually people who have no situational awareness and step in your way once, will most likely do it again in the same match. I have lost a couple ranked matches because of this.

I can't load up Unisoft club since about last Thursday so I can't accept any of the challenges. I thought it was the app but I'm the only person in my friend group who can't load it.

It's no longer possible to pick up grenades.

HOW DO I GET THESE

That's latency showing a "super bullet", enemy shot you maybe 3 times but the server may have hiccuped and as soon as it catches up it delivers 3 shots at the same time to you in what appears to be one bullet only, but of the combined damage of the 3.
---
Mind you this primarily is the case with high fire rate guns and when some internet problems occur.
---
Also, nobody plays Barlett regularly since it isnt in the map pool for anything except thunt, so they could be a bit more liberal with changes, unlike Hereford
---
May as well not be with all the problems it has

As an actual answer, try pressing ALT + F4. Failing that reboot your pc and try again.

---
Well, since Cav is getting banned all the time, I guess I might as well /s
---
Only problem is I'm on Xbox, and I have restarted the console and reinstalled the app
---
That makes sense. The only issue I have with latency is I’m normally less than 50 ping and use Ethernet. Baffles me why I have connection issues. Because it feels like I turn a corner and get instaed
---
Ranked just came out of beta this season to my knowledge I might be wrong tho.
---
Ping is just an indication of how far your data center is, a quick packet loss instance isn't accounted in ping usually.
---
Oh shit! is this live now? do I need to turn it on or does it just immediately go into affect (For controllers) since the patch?

But on those maps, if you start on attack and ban mira, you are giving yourself the advantage for the first 3 rounds, so you only need to win 1 round without Mira.

As a person who just returned to game play after a year off, I was surprised to not see evolution in characters, or more characters for countries like Australia, European.  I think it would be nice to see more Contractor or Operators that work in fringe organizations.
---
I interpreted it as the drone has to physically touch them and they just do a nomad style fall down get up animation, and I think that would be perfectly balanced personally.

You needa change screen resolution

Absolute mad lad

no one cares that you lost

Technically doc can do something similiar

They took that out? That's fucking stupid

Echo for plant denial but why blitz , i didnt even think he sees much play with the presence of the superior shield hero:monty

---
I read this in H. Jon Benjamin’s voice for some reason.
---
Cool idea but kinda useless since enemies never stand next to the disruptors and always shoot them out
---
I got into a match right when he did it so it looked like he put me into a game
---
It does matter since Elo is a system for ranking two-player games like chess and does not represent Microsoft's TrueSkill algorithm. These are two different algorithms.
---
i didnt check so idk. the ww2 style ones are the best ones tho

Hammer main bro

The mobile game youre thinking of is Tiny Tower, if im not mistaken

He's back to where he should be. The buff wasn't needed in the first place and only let to more problems. At the end of the day, Glaz really doesn't fit into the way the game is played.

Big spaghetti energy.

Yep, that and SMG 11 with ACOG too, as well as Glaz's original red scope and the old laser sight which makes you a walking target.

please consider using he search bar rather than being the 5 millionth person to post this. it’s really not hard to use the search bar.

That's what they did. Did you not see the two people that came in on the right side?

Thanks man the game didn’t describe it right
---
You can own semi auto guns that fire explosives. You need a tax stamp if they're over a certain caliber and then another tax stamp for each of the explosive rounds themselves. I've been trying to track down Raufoss Mk.211 rounds for a while now which are perfectly legal to own with no stamps or anything like that. You just need to be able to find them and afford them.
---
Ever heard of AA12?
---
I will now be changing my flair
---
Nobody needed this or wanted to see this yet here we are.
---
And you leave a camera pointed at your screen to do so?
---
I think they need to give him another sniper, one that doesn't rely on smoke.
---
Wat
---
Cool. Didn't know that. But how do they fit into a modern/futuristic game like Siege?
---
Maybe suspended but if they're actually reviewing the whole thing and not just that you might be fine
---
I don't need a stupid buff for see DETAILS
---
Most likely not. Just don't repeat it too often or you may get permanently banned.
---
Yeah, would've prefer the old broken glaz. 😂
---
Lion style
---
The FO-12 (Ela's shotgun) actually has a way faster firerate than the AA-12.
---
Make his gun remote controle. But you have less bullets and have to reload it manually. It can be destroyed by thatcher, explosives or shooting the camera( bulletproof optional)

What’s the other dead meme besides big Chungus?

Not if you cook your grenades, if it exploded whenever he checked and not 2 seconds later, he would be dead
---
Well that's the thing: why not another tier for no duplicates. The lowest tier pack but no duplicates guaranteed
---
Nah I got it all n a pack. Just found it a coincidence you posted about it. I wasn't sure if it's a good skin or not
---
oh shit.. i didn't realize that.
---
I mean this could be a ranked only feature. House isnt on that map. Also i do see where you're coming from
---
Lmao I absolutely love Warden’s facial expression. *Details*

God ubi nerfed shot gun dmg so hard.
---
Lol
---
Good point. Thats another thing i didnt think about. Thank you for the feedback
---
mods usually only delete templated memes
---
I haven’t played R6 in years. I thought dropshotting wasn’t a thing anymore? And I still don’t understand why people it when the enemy isn’t even looking at you.
---
Good point
---
Ela and Zofia's RG-15.
---
Why in the fuck is a BR game on this list. Totally irrelevant to the graph IMO
---
I have gotten 2 black ice in my 106 lvls. 
---
Both were the SAS pistol
---
No need to complicate the game more. Not placing your gadgets already places you at a disadvantage, and making people slow will only lead to worse gadget placement to get rid of weight. Big no from me.
---
👍👌 perfect
---
This man just got a five head shot ace he deserves a crown
---
I honestly believe that in a game where operators change, site location changes, walls can be destroyed, floors can be broken, etc., Rainbow Six: Siege has too many active maps in the ranked map pool. I'm not going to make an argument about which maps should stay, and which maps should go, but the map pool should be limited to eight maps. The maps could rotate every season, but as it is, the map pool is too large.   
---
Go ahead, try to say, "The game will get boring." Okay, let's look at CS:GO. The site stays in the same place. There are no different "operators" to choose from. There are no ways to break open different walls or create new sight lines. CS players have been playing the some of the same  maps for almost 20 years, and it is one of the largest pro league scenes right now. CSGO currently has 7 active duty maps. Siege has no need to have twice the amount of maps as counter strike.
---
I was looking for a while then saw the ping
---
i gotta say its one of the best skins i've seen so far it pumped me so hard i got 9 kills in a match lol
---
I love how Sony made it super easy to save and upload clips on a PS4 and people still take potato quality *vertical* videos with their phone lol.
---
That scoping in looks like eyes popping out!
---
And we still repeat maps in a 2 hour session. Any less and it would be a snoozefest.
---
Hol up.

oh gotcha kk np

Just adding games to the list. It has its competitve scene, so it got added.
---
Throw matches till your rank changes
---
I filmed all that needed to be filmed. It’s actually not that easy lmao.
---
I don't think it lessens the value of any operator. You would literally need to
---
1) Be able to safely loot the dead teammate which isn't always going to be the case
---
2) Forego bringing an operator with utility for an operator that acts a backup.
---
Also, it makes no sense for a teammate to teamkill you for your utility, surely they would have just played that specific operator instead.
---
and lastly, the weapons are not really the main point. They can be designed to be as weak or as strong as you want them to be.
---
Yep, and I'm sick of playing Theme Park, Fortress, Theme Park. It's less of a snoozefest when the maps you repeat are better.
---
I’d be happy with just legendary duplicates being removed.

I’m level 63 and I still haven’t got any black ice I’m so unlucky
---
So I slowed down the video and it shows that barely any of your crosshair was on the enemy when you fired because the vault animation pushed you out at the last second.
---
This happened to me and I went to the forums about it because their was a cheater on the other team. And they fixed it for me.
---
Thanks for the complement, glad someone can be optimistic with all the toxicity.
---
I suppose it's possible, but highly unlikely. I've run across a lot of hackers this season who definitely have wall hacks, but not aim hacks. So they'll prefire you everytime you get close to them, but because they still have bad aim, they miss and you can win the fight.
---
If I get black ice for the MP5 I will literally....be very happy
---
That trigger looks straight boo-boo
---
Pretty sure Glaz had an ACOG in 1.0 as well

Never played csgo, but if it's anything like cod where it's basic maps and bomb, it's more about playing the mode rather than the map. Siege is about the maps and how different they are. Also csgo is a pc game, where people play anything constantly. Most of r6 is played on console where I doubt people would be happy about even less maps.

Thanks

Squad up with random you play with. Assuming they're not DDOSing or cheating in any other manner; work with them. Learn what they bring to the team and find out what you do as well. Synergy is important.

That makes no sense, if they can kill Thermite, what's stopping them from killing this operator. So you don't want new operators added to the game to change the meta? At the same time you complain about it being useless as well. 
---
Lol make up your mind.

Yeah sound propagation is total garbage. Apparently they’re going to be redoing the entire sound engine, which is going to be great once done (hopefully). But unfortunately no idea when that’ll be done.

THIS SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME
---
I miss the grenade throw back option. It was always a gamble. Will I throw it or will it explode in my hand? At least give it back in casual or something.
---
You should have gone for the head
---
Keep in mind each bar is per 100 Elo increment... so gold is by far the most common rank
---
And now I want an R6 crossover for Gungeon
---
I bet that was actually a peaceful 2-3 weeks
---
Yeah.. how, it's a population chart of all players..

Because it's meant to make you think that there around the same amount of silver 1 as there are gold 4, and then it slowly drops off from there, when I'm reality it should be stacked.

At first I thought this was Sofia for some reason

Yeah, I actually somehow missed that part, it still seems misleading to me tho

What happened to it? I've been off for like a week and a half ok vacation. Did they rework it yet?

Gold has 2 bars for a reason.. they're telling you there's more gold, it's on you if you can't read a bar chart.

This way looks alot better than having some tall ass bars take up the whole screen.

Oh nah man I just play ranked :/

If I get a kill, and I didnt hack, glitch or otherwise exploit the game, I deserved that kill. Easy as that.

Damn you Stormcloaks, Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy. If they hadn’t been looking for you I could’ve stolen that horse and been halfway to Hammerfell. You, you and me, we shouldn’t be here. It’s these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
