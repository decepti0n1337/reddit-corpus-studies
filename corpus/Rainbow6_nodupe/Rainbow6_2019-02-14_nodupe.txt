Because you shot them

---
---
You could say that ubisoft, loved that dog to death.
---
On the official website it displays Mozzie as the guy and Gridlock as the grill.
---
Smokes gas
---
I shot below his waist and it was a headshot 
---
You're basing your assignment of his name on your assumption that he's the attacker. That's contrary to the one point that is clear from what we know: biker man is the defender.
---
IT'S SO EVOCATIVE
---
It's my life
---
Maybe try ranked you fucking idiot 
---
Grenade launcher would be under powered or super over powered it would be like a belt feed impact grenade launcher 
---
I love it! Looks great
---
Nice üëå Is the handle built around a PVC pipe?
---
Yes the setting under t-aa. You can leave sharpness at 50 while you are finding the setting that works for you. You should be able to play at 50% scaling or better. Once you find the scaling you can bump the sharpness to 100 probably or leave it, it doesn't matter too much.
---
Thankyou so much!!! 
---
with people like this if you record them doing it and send it to ubisoft support you could be able to get them banned. but if enought people spread this on reddit then ubisoft might find a way to implement a change to stop this from happening.
---
Not racing but chase action maybe.
---
That's the one thing that always gets on my nerve
---
I'm just happy I'm not the only one with a real crusader helmet

Seems pretty normal for someone who mains Blackbeard

No. Ubi said they hated Outbreak and don't want to waste resources doing it again.

its ok!

As a frost main, please dear lord

No you clearly hip fired lol

Why is it always buck

Situations like these are why the saucy meatball man is my defensive main.  These situations and the glorious ALDA.

Wait, did they really give Swags his own charm??
---
lol nice
---
color is super vibrant. looks really good OP
---
you sir are an idiot why would they release a 1 speed, 3 armor attacker for? are you dyslexic or something can you not see she#s a 1 speed, 3 armor no way is she gonna be a 2 speed/2 armor
---
also there's this leak how's it feel embarrassing yourself?

And it all started with worraz, cuz he's an asshole!

Never said I aimed but okay

i'm fairly certain if you filtered by unique IP's it'd be less than half. between all the banned accounts and the smurfs i'd struggle to believe the actual numbers are anywhere near these

The animation quality in this... His movementis soooooo good
---
Yeah agreed

You can definitely see the difference between anchor(probably) and pusher.
---
It's doing exactly what a trailer for anything should do, which is set up the characters in their own world, their dynamic, and, eventually, their role in the game, without giving away too much of the fun.
---
Loving every bit of it.

ignore OP they're misleaded or they're trolling

I swear the clunking sound that it makes is scarier than playing Outlast.

Mhh blackbeard and his papershield is really scary

Bandit, Smoke, Montagne, Tachanka, none have elites, all been out at the same time. And didnt ubi say they werent reworking Tachanka because of his meme status

Mockit full tilt after that
---
The hip fire is random, you may get a headshot, you may not, you never know
---
She is countered by anyone with a drone.
---
I still feel like that would be busted.  The developers have acknowledged that Lion was the biggest mistake they‚Äôve made, even Tachanka (their second biggest mistake).  From Lion and Tachanka, they‚Äôve realized that forced someone to be stationary, even for ‚Äúonly‚Äù 3 seconds (60% of the planting time btw), does not work in Siege, given all the information and destruction that both sides have at their disposal.  
---
TL;DR: Lion is busted, and the reason for that is because he forces people to be stationary in a game built around information and moving.
---
Oi fucking oathhhh cunt
---
Yup
---
There‚Äôs a reason Kapkan isn‚Äôt a one edd kill anymore as much as I loved him. The only possible way would be to make it have a beep and be able to be spotted by IQ

not quite, i'm just messing with estereotypes. in portuguese it's bruXa

That's my point
---
My friends and I were discussing how every new op is just a twist or idea on old ops. Mute becomes bandit which becomes Kaid. Thermite becomes hibana which becomes maverick. 
---
It infuriates me when I see others that are able to shoot frost traps as they are vaulting through windows. That's because when I attempt to do it I typically end up pressing the Right Stick on my Xbox controller at the same time. This leads me to trying to melee the trap and end up getting caught in it. 
---
Just thinking about it frustrates the crap out of me! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ Lol
---
Fuck off frost mains, how bout the fuck not is what I say, their traps are already annoying as fuck
---
A good Maverick with a BB and Glaz can make for a very terrible time... Seen him banned 8n PL a good amount during this invitational. 
---
I bought fuze as my first character, I remember thinking he was good during the beta 
---
I got it at a discount on ps4 and my friend recommended it to me (but he plays pc) and the gameplay looked my style. This sub is nothing but memes and gameplay. Toxic people are in all communities but there it a surplus here. 
---
Let me get this straight...you waited 20 minutes to load on your favourite map in casual...then you meet toxic teammates but refuse to leave since it‚Äôs your favourite map and you waited 20 minutes to load into it...then you proceed to teamkill twice and proceed to cry on Reddit about toxicity you endured when you had a choice...hmm.
---
Ubisoft should fix that asap. Meanwhile i hope you you break your fingers for playing that way. Spawnpeaking is one thing, this is another level of cancerous.

Yeet

Why did buck still sit in that corner after you guys exchanged fire the first time?
---
Mr X
---
by extremely disappointing you mean, dealbreaker for a lot of people. 
---
It got boring very quickly and ubisoft said they probably won't do it ever again. Imo ubisoft should focus on the current content and keep on improving the game rather than introducing new gamemodes.

that doesnt mean they can rework it a little .it could be a standard horde type mode and that would be good enough . There always gonna have a great competitive PVP game but ignoring the PVE market is crazy

Don't set your sensitivity to other people. It's an easy habit to get into but almost all of my friends do it and stick with it despite it obviously not being the best for them. You want the sensitivity that you can flick with as well as quick 180 with, so start at the default and go into a practice game. Do both quick flicks and 180s on a target. If you overshoot, reduce the sense. If you undershoot, up the sense. Obviously the end goal should be to have it feel as naturally as possible, which I think a lot of people know but don't really give enough credence towards. Take the time and effort, and you'll like your sense a lot more than somewhat liking someone elses but getting into weird situations where it's not helpful and you just live with it.

If we're only counting the last decade, that's two mobile games and Rocket League. Which is probably quite simple to balance.

Castle help me learn spanish
---
Dude, I hope your right.
---
I think they are fine, as they don‚Äôt kill or even injure unlike a claymore. Not to mention the placement of them is quite obvious with the loud noise and yellow lightsaber. 
---
I'd be a lot warmer and a lot happier with a belly full of mead. 
---
Who needs claymores?
---
I'd love to see how you would shrink an EMP into a grenade, shrink a tank's APS into a small platform, develop a cloaking device for GU mines and Echo's drone, build Maestro's self-contained high-energy laser, or have a real-time footprint tracker that gives you information on exactly who you're pursuing.
---
They'll still be garbage
---
He doesn't. His angle seems more focused on some pitiful idea of inclusion hence his excitement over a "husky" operator, my angle is female operators if included need to look the part.
---
Yeah, I got nothing. It's getting to the point where guns shots dont even make a sound anymore. The headphones are fine since they work on different games tho

They can't remove his name, it was based off of a book BY Tom Clancy. If they take the name out, and keep the game, ok pretty sure they'll have some copyright stuff commin' their way. Just sayn'
---
Operators named bob and vagene
---
Well along with my mosquito theory they say the attacker is in it for the glory and from what we saw in the CG trailer he seems like a high-octane in it for the glory kinda guy
---
Im not gonna jerk you off, thats p bad; but do you, my opinion aint worth a shit. 
---
Thats probably the direction its gonna head in, similar to kapkan.
---
Used to be that when someone gilded your post with gold you got the benefits of add free reddit along with access to a secret sub reddit. It helped and still does with the upkeep of the company, servers etc.
---
They then introduced silver and platinum. 
---
You can buy them for $ and use at your leisure and expense. 
---
They have something like mute that makes the drone their own
---
The problem people have with airjabs is that they're much more subtle than claymores but act like claymores since they usually guarantee a kill when triggered. In a vacuum they seem harmless but are in fact extremely deadly, and she has *3* of them.
---
HOO-RAH
---
Doubt it, considering how many skins we've gotten recently.  It'll likely just be the charm. 
---
Ah okay thank you

Ah yes, the ol' defenseless spawn peek. Thanks for being part of the problem, my guy.
---
Nah but first gold tho. kinda happy

Just the charm this year unfortunately.

idk what it is, half of the time I can do really well with the Scorpion even at long ranges and I can just go ape on people, the other half of the time it‚Äôs unusable and I die every gunfight

Hey man I do edits too. I can tell just by looking that this took you a very long time to do just this part. Just because some people don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt give up. You gotta find your own unique style and go with it in your edits. You have the technical skill. Keep up the hard work.

The guy who loves the game so much despite 100% of his games being filled with hackers and cheating trolling diamond alt players who manages to hit 328 lvl without putting his fist through the PC and the wall behind it is a fucking saint of a man.

I‚Äôd say go for an operator with a playstyle that your current operators don‚Äôt do. Like since you like to play cav a lot, maybe hold out on ela and take kaid so you can bolster down obj. Dok and Finka r both support but imo Finka can have a greater impact on the game when it matters
---
I agree, that's what I'm telling op. He's in the top ~3% of the population, not a lot to pick from at the top. 
---
Gridlocks can also have big cars and stop a lot of people sooooooo....
---
Time to get there 
---
The real laughing stock is those that belittle other players over their skill in a fucking video game.
---
He offers so much more than that.  Not to mention frosts gadget gives info too in that case.  If they shoot you know where they are, especially when on windows.
---
I can't say for sure but vigil might be able to use his ability so the claymore doesn't sense him and when it exploded it might have ran out
---
I would pay good money for my bois elite skin if that were it and if he even had one

Correct

3. doesn't compute, first time players in ranked are a falsity because you have to reach level 20 in general games before you can even queue for ranked so their saying they're a "new player" is in reality that smurfing douche knuckle who's there to troll the game.
---
Yep same..Im level 287 atm, I DO NOT play ranked either. That is all...casual and ALL solo games.
---
Ive maybe...done 30 games of ranked in 287 levels, just aint my thing I prefer to just play the game for..idk fun (which seems to be getting harder to have nowadays)
---
The ammount of times I join a game and get shit talked cause "Durrrr level 280+ and your fucking garbage...your stats are baaad.." ect.  
---
Like level really isnt an indicator of skill Its just how long youve played the game (sure yes after enough time you SHOULD have a general idea of whats going on but everyone fucks up sometimes so meh)

We all know there will be a super expensive head gear that shows his face

Heres an idea, if you want to play pro league go join a pro team. Im tired of seeing this stupid thread bring created. 
---
I dont think its a very good idea because her pick rate and win delta are already in a pretty good spot. She doesn't need to change. Especially since there are ops that have big win delta issues *cough cough* tackanka
---
You remind me of a friend. Is your name Ben and happen to live across the school we go to? 
---
You mean the alpha footage, yeah that ran like dog shit so they had to completely change the game so it can run a better frame rate.
---
I mean at least they got a character from Y1S2 when Border was added alongside them
---
Names not Ben and I don‚Äôt know what school you go to

The border is made out of Blackbeard‚Äôs rifle shield so it isn‚Äôt very strong

the objective with tweaking frost is to make her gadget more interactive and skillful. not buff the problematic aspect of it
---
think about it OP , in the teaser trailer hes shown running off. hes a defender so he needs to be on point before the match starts.
---
Ubi...........where can I buy this godly cereal

That appears to be glacier from Y1S1. My dude

Protip: Always make you Drone go the place that other drones havent. Example: If all the drones go downstairs, go upstairs, and vice versa it works every time.
---
lol why does everyone BM copper like its where bad players go? Its literally just full of failed golds that need to bolster their egos by picking on the very few actually bad players. 
---
I loved the Pick n Ban. But please add ALL the maps back into the rank rotation, except Bartlett because screw Bartlett. The S.I mode was fun but I quickly got bored of seeing the same few maps. such a shame to have all those maps and the only way to play them is in casual, which most of the time is a shit show :( 
---
Yeah make the space helmets 
---
So, I remember Neuro, a Starcraft 2 streamer, was once asked "how good do you have to be to have fun?"  
---
He said that doesn't make sense to him because you can have fun as a silver player, trying to improve and enjoy the game. Yeah it might not be fun to go up against a Masters but does that really matter since it never happens? Playing the game and enjoying it for what it is is what matters. Not your rank. Don't let it define your ability to have fun.  
---
P.S. Fuck anyone who league shames. people play games to have fun. let them do it in peace
---
swagger?
---
Sledge‚Äôs hammer
---
Am I missing a joke?
---
It's exaggeration. I'm not good at the game, i've only ever been in copper after the first few games outside of placement matches. Also I was super nervous to play my first ranked game because I had never played a fps multiplayer before. Also you can rank up through terrorist hunts and situations. Also, they are legit bad. Usually someone good playing bad is by trying to knife or mending. These people aren't.

Make a quiet beeping noise so you can notice it if you're careful, and slightly increase the delay when it goes off so you can take it out if it's not cleverly placed and you have quick eyes and reflexes.

Yeah I would expect that if Ubi does something like this, they would have the colors change based on color blind settings to make it more friendly for all. To clarify for you, I just have 2 colors for the lines. One to show either a soft wall/window, and another for hard walls/windows
---
I don't know ask AnthonyPit
---
is it a live feed or just a recording? 
---
I don't even understand why it's being reworked. It's one of the most balanced gadgets in the game, and we very, very rarely hear any complaints about it. 
---
The only issue I have with it is if you shoot it while vaulting through a window and it is confirmed to be destroyed, you can still be trapped in it...it's not always consistent. But this is a bug and not a fundamental design flaw. I just don't get why this is being revisited.

Hahah I didn't notice that. This game is a testament as to why I shouldn't be in silver. Problem is that I play with new friends :)

Thats why you dont balance a game around "noobs" they get hit once, twice, and they learn where to shoot......why is this even a matter of discussion
---
I don't think she really needs a rework though? 
---
Then she has no gadget since it's so easily countered
---
Honestly I think she needs a rework. She makes a no-go zone without any counterplay and can push people out the way by quick peeking regardless. We don't see a massive spam of her right now just because she's not allowed to be used.

Also fuck maestro. I fucking hate that fuck.

it's literally invisible, doesn't make sound and you don't even know if she's used it. How the fuck is that lack of gamesense. Even more, you can't do shit if it's placed near the bomb either way

Relax virgin

Thanks. I wish I had the heart to sell them, but I don't have enough free time.  Making a few for some friends and myself is good enough for me.  Feel free to do one for yourself though.  I know where I live my local library has a laser engraver in its makerspace and it's not too difficult to learn how to cut stuff.  Might save you some money, and I'll tell you it feels great making it yourself.
---
True, but I would prefer at least marking reinforced walls to show any team setup decisions and the like
---
its not mate
---
Owned it since launch
---
Close. 
---
Mozzie on the left is the new defender looking like a 1 or 2 speed
---
and Gridlock on the right is the new attacker and looks like a 2 or 3 speed 
---
I have a feeling nothing will happen. 
---
Balanced you say? Half the time you play Frost you would be lucky to even get 1 injure. Her gadget is incredibly ineffective a majority of the time. Sure you can say "it's a free kill" but again how often are you getting injures?

You will get access to the operator's a week early and will own it 
---
True, I forgot about that. Even though by the time he attacked he didn‚Äôt have the advantage. He would have made it a little more difficult for us.

Watch the operator intro. Reply back when you have. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu0YVhruZ5w

I mean he did get released with the map Border

how else can "you will own them" be understood? is there more meanings to "owning" something that I didn't know about.

The real laughing stock is always in the comments

Definitely not sarcastic

Yup.

Big reason why many people have balked on purchasing the season pass because of the lack of a road map.

For real, like what the what?

"Iceycat here"
---
Also ashs hitbox is a mystery that can never be solved .
---
Finka has a normal Holo on all of her promo pics and not the Russian holo she uses ingame. There are many many things in promotions and trailers that don‚Äôt really fit to what we get in the game. 
---
Ubi introduced a grace period to where operators can't be implemented in pro league for x period of time after release.
---
I don't think Nomad will be as busted as Lion, but I think she's going to prove to be the most banned attacker on maps without a buffer between the bomb and the outside. Think billiards on coastline, where Nomad can effectively prevent a retake of the room with virtually no risk. 
---
When we see the strats employed by professionals, I believe Nomad will go down as one of the most overpowered characters in this game's history in her current form.
---
Why is it even in beta?

Her Nintendo omg lol

So I bought the gold edition for PC but I haven‚Äôt bought my PC (because I need to get all the parts yet) so if I wait till next season will they give me the new ops or do you reckon they will find a way to stitch up both of us?
---
bearing with supressor duh
---
I would agree with that. I should have clarified that I didn't want an RNG component, more something along the lines of a very slightly smaller hitbox, mimicking that a helmet could cause a glancing shot to not result in death. 
---
I am not an advocate for it though. Rook is fine as is. 
---
They won't trash a new weapon just for balancing, and the issue with him is just the gadget. Even if he was restricted to just the dmr and shotgun he would still be OP because he can press a button to influence the game.
---
Nice helmet! Where did you get it? I need one for the crusade.
---
Gohan published a tweet saying that mockit refused the "gentlemans agreement" regarding wind bastions skins. Brazilian fans sent death threats to Mockit players and Gohan went with sarcastic comments/banter after the match, while shaking hands with Mockit players, "Nice caveira play" referencing to caveira silent step perspective abuse

Teaching me about breaching charge baits is probably the most fun thing the sub has done for me.
---

Had a match earlier on Clubhouse where my body dropped Moto hatch and moved to the the left of the door for cover, only to teleport back to the top of the hatch and fall right back down the middle where a now aware Jager killed him as he fell.
---
I'd much rather see her traps do 50 or so damage but still force a player prone inside of them and only allowed to use pistol, she would have 5+ traps, and to escape you would need a teammate to help you out of the trap. 
---
I think the main issue with frost mats is that it's do or die, u only get 3 but they can kill 3 players. I'd like to see her get more traps and have them function as a bear trap
---
a coordinated lion team isn't cancer against a coordinated defending team. so a coordinated lion against a group of solos doesn't mean he is cancer.
---
that's like saying "I seen fuze get a lot quad-kills so he must be cancer" like no, unless your team is stupid, they shouldn't know where you all are and you need to use that to your benefit, don't blame your inability to counter lion as him being cancer.
---
If the nuke kills Blitz permanently, then I will be ok with that.
---
Downvoted simply because of sad Lion
---
If anyone doesn‚Äôt rush in all the round, try to save he smokes for the last 30 seconds of the round (if you‚Äôre still alive obviously) to basically make the enemies try to enter from another spot

---
Quit that shit
---
Glad I could be a part of that 
---
You know it's free weekend when Jackal has breach charges.
---
I would say to help balance the hitbox of the mat since its like ash's in that pic. Have it make the sound of metal screeching  the springs on the trap close faster than you can click your fingers, so if it coubd make a suttle little noise like the metal springs would be under pressure it would be better to deal with because of its hitbox.
---
He 100% needs a rework like just getting the 417 and shotgun or giving him a completely new ability that isn‚Äôt as overpowered or make it that everyone can see him when he uses the ability
---

He's emblematic of the many reasons that I am rapidly losing interest in Siege.  Too often we've had incredibly poor design choices that go unfixed for absurd lengths of time.  They, along with a raft of bugs and client-server issues, are contributing to this game becoming increasingly frustrating and generally more stale.  
---
So, yes, Lion needs a rework, but he needed that rework a year ago.  His ability is just fundamentally unfit for the nature of the game.  The fact that he was even released speaks to how little testing new ops seem to get.
---
We need these IRL. Now.
---
I always use the metal/ stone medieval looking one.

Really ? So my account should be standard right?

Couldn't agree more!

I would like to pint out though that I go into the game mode with a more "Ranked" focus since that's the general feel of it.
---
Everything you mentioned unfortunately spoils that for myself and I would pay to see it introduced as the new "Ranked" mode
---
They are supposed to be discounted until March but Ubisoft will announce price changes for DLC operators on Sunday, might be worth waiting for that.

The thing is i just can't focus especially considering i play on EU Servers so i don't understand what any of these kids say it's just horrible then when you get into the game they don't even know what to do i'm very new to the game as well just bought it yesterday but i know what role i have to do but these kids i play with they just run and gun sometimes there are these kids that knows what they are doing but most of the time it's just kids screeching and yelling it's just frustrating because i want to get better but with these kind of players? I just can't

Are you also mad about clash misrepresenting the British? Besides, we see them acting like dickheads while sitting down having a beer. We haven‚Äôt seen them actually operating. From what I‚Äôve read of SASR (biographies and such) they did act like dickheads in their time off.

The thing is, when you are playing solo queue he is just useless because your teammates won't pay attention to the intels you are providing so what I do is just hunting roamers like jackal and don't follow the bus (thermite, thatch, shields) but yeah in pro he always has been a top notch

Dude thank you so much, the original video is like 3 minutes long and that took a whole month to edit. And yes, i‚Äôm really exploring ways to make my content unique, this is just the first video i‚Äôve experimented on. Just gonna ignore the hate and keep moving forward...
---
I hope your holy believe is still strong. 
---
An addition like this would be targeting the newer people or just people who don't really know the game well but like to watch. It would serve no positive or negative purpose to someone who already has hundreds of hours logged and knows everything about the game already. However it could make the maps a bit easier to understand to a newcomer.
---
IQ was not holding the M590A1 (S.A.S.'s shotgun of choice) but the M1014 (FBI-SWAT's shotgun of choice.) Also, her operator image shows her holding the M45 MEUSOC (another FBI-SWAT weapon).

Also pops up in Multiplayer, and it deducts and an increasing amount of points each time you down the hostage.

That's exactly what I would like to see added to ranked, an elo lock system so that Coppers cant Queue with diamonds.

Granted, they could get a smurf, but at least it makes it that tiny bit harder. Plus with needing 2-step to play ranked wouldn't make it easy.

Thats a cool find! Trials Rising just announced their DLC plans after the game launch on 26 Feb, and there is an track that looks to be located in Uluru. Nice little tie in.

40 million copies sold. Let's consider the average price per copy of $35 to make it up for the cheap starter edition and the ultimate one. That's roughly $1.4 billion. And we're talking about the base game alone not considering season passes, elite sales and other MTXs.
---
Now fucking tell me if they truly need all these predatory lootboxes to mAkE mOnEy SoMeHoW. 
---
Amazing, dude what the hell insane
---
Actually I‚Äôm fairly sure they nerfed the thunt thing a while ago. Best thing for renown is the situations if you haven‚Äôt beaten them already, If you have then focus on challenges. 
---
That Guy from the original video is considered a national hero
---
New defender op who can reinforce breached reinforced walls? Hmm
---
Cr√©neau for sure
---
Interesting strat btw
---
I know
---
PC: Kaid
---
Console: Finka or Ela.
---
The reason I say this is because even after the recoil fix the recoil on the TCS is pretty annoying at times.
---
Isn't ranked locked to 2-step only accounts now? Or has that not gone through..
---
If it is locked then the amount of smurfs/alts in ranked would drop i believe, granted they could just throw on their main but who would do that? Not many people i reckon. Unless it's a boosting service of course.
---
As it stands Siege, in my opinion, is the EASIEST game to boost in, there's literally zero barriers for a diamond to queue with a copper, they just join their lobby and go.
---
Meh, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as bad as everyone seems to think he is, I just don‚Äôt like global abilities

Can confirm from personal testing that even regular T-Hunt gives you much more Renown per minute than multiplayer.

I noticed it's water gun level damage, but yeah, it's easy to control but I like my guns with "umph". Vigil and Dokk's shotguns are some of my favorites, but I do like guns such Zofia's rifle.
---
I guess I need practice with Valk's.
---
Not necessarily, Kapkan traps still hum and people still get caught by them because they're rushing into objectives etc. So to have the charge make a sound would result in similar scenarios - you'd still get people rushing in so won't hear it, and those who do hear it will be distracted by it and might be vulnerable to being flanked if they're too busy looking for it. Also, compared to Kapkan traps, they can be anywhere instead of just on a door frame
---
must'd've
---
It won‚Äôt be for the P9, since that would put the skin on other ops.
---
Following what the rest of the team skins are like, it‚Äôll be for a gun that‚Äôs exclusive to one operator.
---
Im fucked
---
You're right that pinching from 2 sides would have been the right play. But since the smoke actively pushed 1 side and killed the bathroom guy, it's more of a clutch than a misplay from the enemy. He didn't give the enemy the chance to push from both ways by smoking of 1 way and killing the other side.

I don't like the RPM of the V308. Idk why but everytime I play him, it feels like I'm shooting with a Nerf gun :/
---
You do realize that it all depends on Internet connection. You‚Äôll have good hit registration in T-Hunt than you will actually playing the game because you have little to ‚Äúno‚Äù ping.  And considering you play on console you‚Äôll be surprised how many shots you actually miss by being off by millimeters due to analog sticks. P.S. T-Hunt is literally bots who stand still for the most part where as multiplayer people are usually moving.

If it makes it more impressive, I got two other kills after my team died before I made it to the face off against Monty in this clip. Figured the other two kills would have made the clip too long. But I agree, that flick up to the ceiling was fucking terrible, and the Monty was bad and should have just headshot me. Lucky for me he gave me ample time!

2 million dollar prize pool. Plus it is allowed, as it is not covered by the rulebook.

Plus korey didn't actually achieve the glitch here as he wasn't leaning spamming. Also Gohan would have still died as he peeked with a grenade in hand.

He's not fun to play against, that's for sure. I can only use him effectively in a 5 stack, but I still prefer finka for a global ability role.

Most likely on Tuesday. In the past they have always released the TTS for the new season on the Tuesday after the Final

Although I'm Australian, I don't know anything about what a "Billy" is. Just going based on the image provided, the one next to big gurl looks too mechanical. Also, Owen Wilson over on the left grabs a lil' crossbow, so safe to assume that isn't some form of pot, but it's her gadget.

It is a glitch and it is allowed? And no, you DONT need to leam spamming, just stay still with silent steps allowed and that's it you are invisible AND immortal :)

It's such b.s. that he's getting another rework

Oh idk if anyone from Ubisoft will see this or even care, but the sledge grenade glitch is back. You know the one that just blows you up without you even thinking about throwing a nade

r/globaloffensive

bruh, Ying's LMG was one of the worst guns in the game for a very long time, until the point where Ubi adjusted all of the LMG's. Lion's V308 on the other hand, needs 4 shots to kill a 2 armor opponent. combine that with his very low RPM and you get outgunned in 90% of all gunfights (if your enemy has decent aim), simply because your opponents have smgs with \~1000 RPM. Maaaybeee you feel like it's one of the best guns in the game and I am not trying to convince you otherwise, but I've played enough Lion (And trust me, I did - feel free to hate me for that if you want to) to know that his gun is trash and nearly every other "Main" usually favours the 417 over that crap.
---
He does need a nerf but it's just that he has too many gu mines 
---
Are you implying Lesion isn't a bit too strong?
---
Bandit is way more balanced than Lesion
---
Depends on rank. I‚Äôd say at gold like 15% max, but at high plat and diamond probably 60%
---
It could be an indication of a growing playerbase. Enjoy it. As an Eve player, our population is pretty stagnant, and it shows.
---
I just personally think having a wide range of operators to play is better than one or a few. Especially with the Six Invitational mode likely to be added next season, there‚Äôs going to be 4 operators banned every match. As I‚Äôm sure you know, some operators just aren‚Äôt nearly as good on some maps and/or objectives as others.

To infinity and beyond!

Sounds like you need a better teammates. 
---
cav has to locate the enemy,hit her shots to down,and then survive during the interrogation to gain the info,lion only has to press a button,there is no comparison here,the skill ceiling for cav is much higher than that for lion 
---
Ok. I will keep this in mind. Thanks!
---
This is creative im going to do this on my boyfriend's birthday! Thanks for sharing
---
It's still there for sure. In ranked you typically won't see them until you start to reach around gold 1 but when you do start to be matched with the people in that rank and higher you'll find it annoying how many people can't seem to be bothered to use their controller in a fair environment. 
---
That is a miss my friend

Still too long.

Gee, I wonder, were you the block boy? (I hate the blocks. I always set up wrong and then had bad takeoffs.)
---
TTS will probably be live after invitationals and then will be live on all platforms at the beginning of March 
---
That‚Äôs so true!
---
That's going to be redirected to Rook mains... Stand by.
---
BLOW MY BACK OUT I-
---
Hell yeah, I like those!
---
Finland, Israel and the danish frogman corps are my wants
---
Lesion is fine, to be useful you have to stay alive so...
---
The way I see it, we're getting a mesa map.
---
This is in group situation
---
I see so the recruit is Russian Spy interesting.....
---
I would say remove 2 Gu and remove his impacts. 
---
Yeah I know but wasn't there an update which made weapon attachments and the original operator to make it easier for beginners?
---
(I think it was last march)

Thank you for this *A R T*

Have you ever contemplated suicide after reflecting on your decisions?
---
Same with Finka's, just hard to read. I was wprried it'd be a trend but most of the ones after were fine, thankfully
---
I think he meant acceptable casualties
---
Smoke is wear some weird ass version of sketchers
---
Try r/R6STeams, someone may bit over there or join some friends (if you have any) that play the game. Not much else to help apart from enduring the toxicity unfortunately :/
---
Why would defenders want to pause cameras?
---
Also the first one is just stupid
---
Oh! So my whole team?
---
You realize how easy it is to just sit back and camp gu mines it doesn‚Äôt take much skill
---
I'm not a good long distance runner. I have a possibility of Cystic Fibrosis. It's unconfirmed but I could have it. So I don't risk the miles.
---
Oof on the flair
---
Pls give me a galil ;-;
---
For some yes, yet there are blatant issues with the game where it actually just doesn't work correctly. The game has an actual hit reg problem that has nothing to do with lag. Does it happen where lag is a factor, of course, every game has that. Sometimes it's just the Ubisoft servers themselves. Whatever the case, it still happens to much in general 
---
Thatcher is a good combo with Thermite because he can get rid of jammers or batteries so Thermite can breach a reinforced wall.
---
Oh, right.
---
That's a nice spot, I'm certain if I try it next time enemies will appear simultaneously from every other angle except the one in the video.
---
Give zofia her 3 concussion back
---
The first game one of my friends play he got TKed every single round so he rage quite and hasn't played since
---
i didn't know about it, but if it's old, then...
---
I was hoping the guy with a motorbike helmet would be an attacker :(
---
Australia NS are real cool people, Australia is not so friendly
---
Exactly, he's perfect. His SMG is in a solid place, his Six12SD is underrated, and his Gus are glorious. 
---
That too, fellow Zofia main.
---
Only real OG's knew this
---
have you not ever heard poggers before
---
Just grind through it. It gets better I promise. 
---
Coreross a year ago 
---
Wait people didn't know this and I could've gotten 2k karma if I just posted it? Damn
---
Being a Doc main, I definitely saw the difference in the nerf. Just cause you can‚Äôt see the difference doesn‚Äôt mean other people can‚Äôt. 
---
Now this is epic
---
On Ying one thing I think gets over looked is how easily she can burn a Jager ads. If you detonate her candela like a fuze charge (against a soft wall) it fires out more projectiles on the other side which will use more of Jagger's ads charge than just tossing the candela inside a room. 
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you enter my objective‚Äù
---
Oops. Need to change that bit. They're both supposed to be attackers.

Ah ok, Track no matter what event is intense.

OBS

No it‚Äôs 10
---
&gt;I don't think it'll do all that much on it's own
---
It won't be on it's own once the QEC spam fixes are implemented. Losing the ACOG and movement abuse make R4 rushes harder to pull off. And if they take the G36 for the ACOG it'll still be harder because it's a worse weapon.
---
Was it removed?
---
Stop spamming damnit!
---
I like it. Makes more sense to run Holo on her if she's entry frag anyway.
---
Yes it can, learn to play stop crying. There was people who conplained lion/blitz getting nerfed when he clearly needed it just because they mained him
---
I feel that they should have done the 18 seconds OR the mute buff, not both. Being able to hold a room because you don't have to worry about your phone, just having a jammer somewhere in the room is kinda dumb. Should have time or silent while in a jammers range so that you have to worry about your phone at some point
---
Ash mains don't have the patience to use a twitch drone lol
---
I smell tears, *salty* tears.
---
I think it was 
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd take anything to decrease her popularity. 
---
Ok, I get that, but when they took it away from the germans, it was ok. Why? because they were the only 3 speed defenders with a acog, theres a lot of 3 speed attackers still with the acog though
---
She will still be extremely strong in her role. She just won't be as good holding long angles. 
---
HEY HEY Reddit had a bug. When clickpost it says me.error so I continued to click
---
How about a Roof Korean?
---
So basically you only play her because shes op so your problem is you dont like a fair and balanced game
---
‚ÄûWalking into range of Mute jammers will hang up phone calls during the call‚Äú
---
I don't like this tbh. Defender will just run into range of mute jammer than hang up phone call and then go immediately back to his position. I would slighlty change it: If you are not into range of mute jammer during phone call and you will go into range of mute jammer then your phone will be just muted but if you will go out of range your phone will be ringing again (if you don't hang up it ofc). Just my idea.
---
P.S.: Sorry for my english
---
ACOGs are  considered the best  scope and  Ubisoft  has already  done it  in   past  with the  GSG9 defenders.
---
Its likely that other attackers will end up losing their acog in an effort to get more people playing obj instead of holding a tight angle for 2 minutes.
---
/thread.
---
For real though man. I was spawnpeeking (like a good Doc main) and lit up a sledge. He sprayed the window and killed me. I was so confused as to why I didn‚Äôt kill him then remembered the nerf. 
---
But a low pick rate. Which means people in plat and diamond pick her when they need her, cause if she‚Äôs not needed she‚Äôs useless. But ash is picked always whether needed or not because........ she‚Äôs op. 
---
Just looking at new, also just a bunch of screenshots of text from the notes
---
ü¶Ä *No more R4-C ACOG* ü¶Ä
---
Not too serious, just what she needed. It will slightly decrease her popularity, which is a welcome change. 
---
Quite the opposite, this is a step in the right direction, IF they do the same with other attackers.
---
Less ACOGs means less angle holding, more pushes, the meta will change and finally there will be choice between all the operators instead of picking one just because he has a great gadget and a great gun with an ACOG.
---
yeah i would have no problem with a nerf to her speed, thats something that isnt an issue, i use ash because her gun is good, not to rush in
---
What was it about tho? If u watched it can u sum it up 
---
I understand. Was just aiming to get your attention. 
---
Does that mean Y2S1 Glaz/Montagne meta is coming back???
---
Yep, check patch notes. Ash will be forever remembered
---
Looks like the ‚ÄúTrax‚Äù leak was correct 
---
Makes perfect sense
---
I think these are all great choices. Good job Ubi
---
Wrong password.
---
I had a crush on her
---
Ik and I'm just gonna miss it, but I still feel that she may take the Jager path pick and win rate wise but hopefully not
---
Member when ash had an acog? I membeeeeer
---
Bait thirsty people into pushing you.
---
I'm fucking rioting
---
I understand. But what I'm saying is that it is ridiculous that a certain type of scope can determine the balance of an operator. Not an ability or a certain weapon, but a type of scope.
---
Ash has utility that can be used strongly. And good players are still going to play her holo or acog. The devs are just trying to bring her pick rate back from seeing ash every game without a major change to who she is. 
---
Some of my personal thoughts on some changes:
---
&gt; Removed ACOG from R4-C
---
I disagree that this is the right way to balance her. Nerf the weapon directly- don't remove items from it. 
---
&gt; Increase swap time between SURI Torch and weapons
---
Good change!
---
&gt; After 18 seconds, phone calls from Dokkaebi will hang up on their own
---
Interesting that they chose 18 seconds. My friends and I were discussing this, and we settled on 20 seconds being an appropriate time. This will be interesting to see, although I think it's a good change. 
---
&gt; Walking into range of Mute jammers will hang up phone calls during the call
---
Not sure how I feel about this. 
---
&gt; Increasing area of effect size
---
&gt; Reducing damage per tick from 19 to 12
---
Seems like it will be more consistent. Much better!
---
&gt; Reduced Gu Mines damage per tick from 8 to 4
---
I can see why it has been done. and I don't think people really use Lesion to damage operators. I'm fine with this. 
---
&gt; Damage on Attacker‚Äôs side is reduced from 150 to 50
---
If this means what I think it does, I 100% disagree with this change. Absolutely unnecessary. I imagine less than 10% of the playerbase has Meat Wall, and this is just pointless and stupid. 
---
Solid changes overall to shake up the meta, but I don't agree with the R4C or the breaching charge change. 
---
Pro league strats
---
Gridlock is the attacker and mozzie is the defender 
---
[https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1096091961759539200](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1096091961759539200) :)
---
I‚Äôm grateful to Ubisoft. 
---
How is she OP you fucking idiot? Her utility &amp; Gadget is lacking behind every other attacker and her gun is barely better than average????
---
Twitch will become the new Ash.
---
Good changes but I feel like Dokkaebis guns need a buff now
---
Well using monty and glaz is still good. Plus the shield nerf will probably affect Monty a little 
---
Glaz, most of the time, extremely useful anyway. 
---
Its fantastic
---
Forgot to set my out of town message...
---
ANYWAYS, We are looking to only change the snoo around once a year rather than seasonaily. 
---
The snoo is one of the more direct ways people identify /r/Rainbow6 (*looking at you meme makers of the world*) and we want to be sure the snoo is a little more permanent
---
Jumped into coke window on theme park once after droning and I must've completely missed him, I turn to my left and there he is in the corner with his shotgun, scared the crap out of me
---
Plz tell what happened
---
I think its good that they are removing her r4c acog and questioning if all attackers should get one by default. If an attacker doesnt get the acog it's another game design/balance hurdle out of the way. Which could eventually lead to more interesting and unique guns for attackers.
---
Yeah, mozzie has the thing that we saw on the table in the teaser. And gridlock has a projectile that looks like it latches on 
---
I‚Äôm just gunna use the g36c
---
ü¶Äacog is goneü¶Ä 
---
Hell no I'm staying with the r4, that shit's op. 
---
ü¶Ä*crab rave* ü¶Ä
---
Well, if you really wants an ACOG on Ash, the G36 is still an option :)
---
On the future TTS server yes
---
Crying because its an unfair disadvantage to an already balanced / underpowered operator?
---
I didn't even see that in the game.
---
It‚Äôs to make the choice between the R4C and the G36C more interesting. The R4 is chosen 99% of the time and ash as an operator is played nearly every round in game so she is getting a nerf to bring her more in line with the other operators. It‚Äôs been coming for a long time now. Shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. 
---
No they aren‚Äôt, the video isn‚Äôt up but it said gridlock was the deffenser and mozzie was the attacker 
---
i already run holo due to the close quarters nature of ash, so no effect to me. not that i play ash, as is aid in my flare
---
That‚Äôs what you say now. But I can already see the post of outrage if it happened. Everyone‚Äôs always upset when their main gets nerfed. The game changes. Adapt and get over it. 
---
&gt; ‚ÄúWanting to add a bolt action‚Äù
---
What?
---
\*See too much European CTUs
---
Stop. 
---
Ok, it got my attention, thanks to you I saw my error
---
She can be annoying but that's because she just feels good to play she is such a smooth operator (and the fact that the r4-c is insane)
---
Is moments like these that make me love sarcasm.
---
Nice.
---
Found the ash main
---
I play lion and go out of my way to be friendly just to confuse people ü¶Å I also bought the pro league uniform
---
"noob" , as you're silver 3
---
Nice
---
ubisoft na deleted video lol. 
---
Oh my god, this isn‚Äôt satire...
---
Girlfriend sure.....
---
Wow thanks OP this makes my valentines depression just worse 
---
You are one lucky boi OP
---
I still just prefer the sight itself.
---
I image Ubisoft will just say fuck it and remove AcOg from the game.
---
Hmmm so she sucks yet shes the most fun? And her pickrate just so happens to be unbelievably high
---
exactly
---
It's from the dev's test server I believe
---
Mirror: https://streamable.com/bmdg6
---
Ah thanks. I read that it will be upgraded to the standard edition but when I still had the starter edition I got kinda worried.
---
Ubisoft imo as the worst balance team i ever seen,just add a lot off recoil and less damages (sorry for bad english \^\^ )
---
Its actually not that bad but statistically it's always been worse than the r4-c, I think pro players are just gonna Holo her and rush
---
Makes sense, thanks for the response.
---

---
Read this
---
did you not see the message above? 
---
Seems a but far fetched, seems lion like from what you're saying you want to have the operator confined to one spot for the 18s duration of the call. I get what you're saying just seems op
---
&gt;nerf Maverick instead
---
They are, right under the Ash info is Mavericks, they are increasing the switch time between his weapon and torch
---
No
---
There is a reason behind it, believe it or not, they are in charge of making balancing decisions and they have all the stats and feedback from proleague. Of course everyone (them included) was expecting an outrage from people who main her because she's very popular, but they won't revert the change just because people say "no don't do it I like her how she is".
---
The only way for them to revert the change would be if the feedback the get from pros and stats shows that it's a bad change, and believe me, it will not happen. I have nothing against Ash mains, but accept this change because it will not be limited only to her in the future.
---
Probably why Ubi is doing this. Like, Mute is essential but not popular, partly due to the number of operators with entry denial abilities. 
---
[https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:154-344176-16&amp;ct=tcm:154-76770-32](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-gb/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:154-344176-16&amp;ct=tcm:154-76770-32)
---
Look at how they massacred my boy
---
&gt; R4-C is insane
---
You just said the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù of this change being made. Ash needed to have a weakness when it comes to engagements. 
---
Boi 
---
They‚Äôre* and she needed it frankly 
---
Other than the F2, Twitch's kit doesn't lend itself as well to the rush playstyle. 
---
Losing flashes is huge, and while the drone is good for taking out traps before the rush, Ash's launcher can easily be fired into doorways to clear shit without pulling out a phone and ceasing momentum.
---
I really think that Ubi shouldn‚Äôt hit the shield ops too hard before fixing the shield sync. I like that they‚Äôre focusing on making the shields a more team oriented tool, but I feel as if they won‚Äôt be able to maintain that position in their current state. 
---
Re upload it with smokey boi
---
If you think people are gonna leave bc of an ACOG removal you sorely have the community wrong
---
That‚Äôs gotta be why lol I‚Äôm sure somebody watched it and said ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù
---
I saw the thing on the website but I‚Äôm just going on what I saw with my own 2 eyes
---
They could reduce the amount he gets to throw.
---
This works in casual too. Trust me I‚Äôve tried 
---
At the end of the video it clear states Gridlock - Attacker
---
Mozzie - Defender
---
Your link is dead at the moment 
---
But check this out. Ubisoft Thailand 
---
https://youtu.be/VammNESodCU
---
It‚Äôs just a joke 
---
so low effort you even got the operator wrong. 
---
This was a bad move. Ubi giving in to false opinions. The operator ash is nothing special. Her hit box has been fixed ten times over, her gun is good not great. Her pick rate is so high because of the stigma she‚Äôs acquired and she‚Äôs mainly picked because she‚Äôs a 3 speed. If her acog is taken away it‚Äôs going to worsen her for lower ranks and cause ash rushers to just rush with the reflex or switch to an op like iq or twitch which will eventually lead to them being unnecessarily nerfed.
---
Balanced? Underpowered? OMEGALUL
---
Go check Ubisoft's website. Mozzie is the guy. I thought Gridlock was going to be the guy too
---
Ahh
---
Im so sorry im not in touch with the copper community, Can you please elaborate?
---
The real role of high level Ash play is not soft breach. It's to destroy defender gadgets. Evil eyes, bulletproof cams, shields, Castle barricades, bandit batteries from below, etc. 
---
And she usually does it more consistently than Twitch.
---
Ubisoft- Here I go nerfing everything again.
---
Still, they make the game.
---
But stilll wtf
---
What's with this breach charge change though? Did people really have trouble using them?
---
I'm loving the new capitao. Boy, I want to attack basement in Oregon so much. Hi, Mira!
---
I see but I fucking swear it said that idk, I‚Äôm just not gonna worry about it anymore 
---
well 18 seconds means it‚Äôs ringing for most of the time regardless, you have 30 seconds to diffuse right? 
---
Nope.
---
Also has a projectile breach charge used to clear barbed wire,gu mines, frost mats, evil eyes,etc 
---
Make her call 2 selected people?
---
What happend with ASH
---
Nope. You watch when season 2 comes out and this change has literally done nothing
---
The ash nerf we deserved, she will finally be a dedicated aggressive rusher who fills that role exclusively. This will seriously drop her pick rate hopefully, since she will stop being a offensive Swiss Army knife 
---
I've had fun banning Ash because of people like you. 
---
It should be one or the other though. It's a lose lose for her. It should go on until you manually turn it off or walk into the jammer, this gives roamers a huge advantage that they dont have to worry because Itll only last 18s if they dont shut it off themselves
---
This is fucking stupid. 
---
1. Bolt action wont work in this game
---
2. 1 speeds on defense need an ACOG to make them way more viable 
---
3. Removing ACOG from attackers defeats the point of the ash nerf in the first place
---
Too big a change imo
---
Ubi giving us all a Valentine's gift.
---
Ahahahahaa hahahahhaha!!!
---
Hahahahah far from it 
---
Ok bud keep tooting your own horn I get it youre Ash God and everyone else is trash...im not in the mood for an epeen measuring contest
---
I have, lasted 2 hours. This was a while ago and we think somebody found a glitch and was doing it on purpose. Long story short. I won.
---
Why does ubi hate roamers?
---
Even if you don‚Äôt have someone to call a Valentine this day, we still love you! Stay classy all you muppets!
---
Here‚Äôs the template if anyone wants to make their own: https://imgur.com/m70HC4a
---
99% of people in Plat 2 and below. 
---
I'm aware that people asked for it. People also begged for Bartlett to be added to the map pool and we know how that turned out, chief. Just because people ask for it doesn't mean it's the best course of action. 
---
They should leave it up to the operator if they want people to spot on their gadget. 
---
Agreed though its not that they need to stop making them, they also need to balance the already existing ones.  There's way too operators that can punish you when you've done nothing to deserve it.  Ideally, a player makes a decision and the opposing player makes a move that punishes them for it.  But there are so many instances where a player hasn't done anything and just dies.
---
For example,  
---
1. 1 v 1 with Montagne is a scenario that should have *some* recourse.  Even if its asking you to thread the needle, there should be *some* way for every operator to deal with Montagne in a 1 v 1. I'm just spitballing but something like, give Montagne a meter for how well he can hold his shield up.  Shotguns, Grenades, explosive operator abilities and melee attacks can deplete this meter.  So if you don't have *any* tools left and you're left in a 1 v 1, you at least have an opportunity to make a play and have a 1 v 1 against Montagne.  Lets arbitrarily say, 5 melee attacks to his shield depletes this meter to the point where you can deal damage on some part of Montagne.  These are all variables subject to balancing but the idea is, there needs to be *some* way to deal with him in a 1 v 1 after the defuser is planted.  
---
And the same Pulse.  Pulse should not be able to get free kills by scanning you through some wooden floor and throwing C4 at your feet.  This one is easy to solve.  Just take away his C4, maybe give him a bulletproof camera or even Impacts.  But the fact that he can take someone off the map for literally free is ridiculous.
---
Thought this was an advert for fosters 
---
Terrible. 
---
You are supposed to engage in CQC with Ash, with her speed and small frame, the ACOG loss is not a big deal.

I mean they‚Äôll still be exposed and have to make a decision if you are within a reasonable range. This is more so that a defender no where near the actions doesn‚Äôt have to drop everything and hang up. It‚Äôs already bad enough that it‚Äôs a universal ability, so it shouldn‚Äôt force all defenders to do something 
---
45 i believe
---
Acog removed from the r4c
---
Lion is getting reworked in Season 1.
---
why did we need this
---
Because ubi would rather add new operators than fix the current 
---
Mozzie is definitely my new defence main now.
---
Leison needed that nerf
---
I‚Äôm a sucker for these kinds of edits 
---
maybe make him have to place them instead of just being able to chuck em 
---
I mean very few people use the ACOG on ash, it‚Äôs usually the holo
---
Her ACOG got removed from the R4 :(
---
link?
---
I don't agree with the ACOG decision. There's nothing about the ACOG that makes the R4-C superior to the G36 at all. What makes the gun superior is having a higher fire rate with lower recoil.
---
Increase the recoil and/or lower the fire rate would've been a much more logical change.
---
I don't think taking away her ACOG is going to do anything.
---
Finally!
---
And shoots rockets 
---
Yeah, completely worse than pressing one button to fuck whole enemy team.
---
&gt;reeeeeeee‚Äôs in Aussie 
---
Why... do you play jackal with breaches?
---
After removing acogs from defend operators, you guys are now trying to remove acogs from attack operators?
---
But I honestly don't get why she's losing it. He was a 3 speed defender. She is an attacker, all the other 3 speed attackers have acogs, this is just dumb.
---
Is it confirmed by ubi
---
Yeah, they wanted to have an operator like Glaz who used a bolt action sniper rifle. But because Glaz was already under powered (this was before his "thermal" vision) they scrapped the idea; they didn't want two weak sniper class operators when they were having trouble balancing one. I can try to dig up the thread... It might've been in an AMA with the Devs.. 
---
Yeah it said that. I think they did it wrong lol. They deleted the video and re uploaded.
---
G36C for Ash is still really good, I'll be using that from now 
---
Ash main bad
---
I don't think so. The aggressive defender meta has gone on for a long time, removing acogs was an effective way of reducing it and making runouts / window peeks a more balanced risk/reward.
---
As for players like Ash losing Acogs, it just pushes them back to their intended role as a fast entry. Other fragging operators still exist with acogs, she's just been weakened in the long angle fragger role .
---
Sorry mate, forgot you're hard.
---
I wonder if they plan to remove all ACOGS all together like they said they're challenging it, That would mean it would be like Wildlands and CS:GO
---
Never said she was OP. Ash‚Äôs Weapons (mainly the R4-C) should be nerfed quite hard, and then buff the gadget a little. Wouldn‚Äôt nerf her per say, just changes her strengths around a bit
---
https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-344176-16/y4s1-designers-notes-pre-season
---
your comments are just pure gold and the fact that you start insulting someone after losing an argument really supports the point you were trying to make &lt;3
---
What‚Äôs happening to dokkaebi?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs probably what ended up happening now that I think about it 
---
Yarp
---
I love playing ash but I‚Äôm okay with this overall because holo on r4c is till VERY good. I like the capitao change and as annoying as Dokki is, she is really weak now.
---
Was waiting for this comment
---
Choosing to wait still comes with the downside of having a loud-ass phone on you for 18 seconds. Considering all Dokk has to do to make this happen to every single defender is hold down a button I'm fine with it.
---
If Logic Bomb wasn't universal I would agree with you 
---
They arent removing ACOG from ash. They are removing it from the R4-C her other gun still has it. If you really feel like you need an ACOG, puc the other gun. 
---
I think because you fired the bullets directly after each other the inaccuracy increased
---
Read the notes 
---
I don't know if you realise, but Ash will still have the R4-C and will have a 1x sight on it. Making it better than the ACOG in terms of rushing. 
---
I‚Äôm genuinly surprised because a bolt-action simply wouldn‚Äôt work in a game like Siege.
---
Wait, Mozzie is the guy? AND he's the defender? wow okay
---
You did not read that correctly. GUs still do 10 damage, but only 4 more damage per tick if you don't take it out (down from 8).
---
I think that a good way to balance her as I think she should be close range and not long range.
---
Yeah. And I respect you for having and accepting different opinions
---
Of course they put his helmet as his icon lol, So he's the one who hacks drones and she's the one who puts down a web gadget: I'm guessing we're getting the first DLC 1 speed, 3 armor because no way is she gonna be a fast mover, Gridlock on the other hand looks like it
---
Yeah that was so surprising. I know a lot of people on console at least that run reflex/holo
---
Me too
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be better with jager since he actually lost his?
---
Ahhh I remember mine... There was a toxic Jager who tried to spawn peek on Clubhouse by the strip club... I managed to down him as Twitch. He saw me taking out my breaching charge and I had difficulty placing it around him but he didn‚Äôt make an effort to quit or leave. That was actually nice of him. I‚Äôd do the same thing actually. 
---
It‚Äôs no-nonsense and fits like a glove.
---
Ne we need an operator that can stack reinforced walls on already reinforced walls to make them require twice the charges/pellets to get through. And then an attack operator that has a doubly strong thermite charge, and back and forth forever.
---
I‚Äôm beyond speechless.  I‚Äôve wanted this forever and I think it‚Äôll be nothing but healthy for the game.
---
lol how do doc and rook have different footprints
---
WTF UBI, istead of fixing ASH'S Hitbox you take her ACOG... just remove it from the game when you have a problem with it. #acog4bandit
---
Finally I don‚Äôt have to hear my teammates‚Äô phones for the entire round 
---
Taken from the Y3S2.2 designer's notes
---
Kanto and joystick would like to say yes.
---
FILL MY BIG FUCKING HOLE with love
---
As I said in my reply to Mad-Observer, you're most likely going to be yokai blasted when pushing an objective which means you then have to back out of pushing, find a spot to hide/hold and angle and then stand still. The moving makes the effect more intense. It just seems too much.
---
Or a slower recharge maybe. Or maybe simply make his mines slightly more invisible.
---
You planted the defuser on that small piece of wood and the wood shuffled post plant. ANY movement in the defuser is an auto loss to the attackers. 
---
You can force exploit this in doorways by creating debris around the plant area after the round starts so client side debris is guaranteed to be on the attacker side as well. I also found that if you plant right on a door way, and the defender barricades the door, the bottom of the barricade has the potential to move the defuser and cause a round win for defense. 
---
It looks like a handheld crossbow that shoots a web
---
I just watched twice thinking i missed something bc there is no difference between this and the the other trailers posted like 1 hour ago. 
---
Yeah - I run holo on her too. I‚Äôm just saying it is hopefully going to slow down the rush with ash meta in the higher ranks.
---
 Ure not
---
"Also, her R4-C is currently picked 99% of the time, and this should help balance her weapon pick rate a bit more."
---
I am the 1%.
---
LOL tl;dr
---
Hello SarpIlgaz, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aqmo6l/ubi_how_can_you_do_this/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
qq
---
&gt;I might consider not playing anymore until ubisoft will fix the game and stop listening to cry babies
---
oh the irony
---
I don‚Äôt think crying over a game is good, it‚Äôs here for fun and you might want to take a little break from Siege 
---
You still have plenty of ACOGs on offense.
---
Fuze, Glaz, BB, Finka, Lion, IQ, Thermite, Ying, Jackal, etc.
---
I personally think all 3 speed ACOGs need to be removed, but spawn peeking has very little to do with speed, so even 1 speed operators on attack can counter any peeking.
---
Thing is the US accounts deleted it so all those video posts are unavailable 
---
What‚Äôs the problem with what you highlighted?
---
Does she still have a 60% pick rate. It‚Äôs lower isn‚Äôt it 
---
We know stop posting 
---
This is how we should all play Tachanka 
---
I knew it
---
Basically a gassy Molotov cocktail on a crossbow bolt
---
Well I just found out. 
---
They're not changing the stats of the weqpon, so yeah, it'll still be really good. I already use a holo quite a bit on it anyways.
---
Buffing the G36C while leaving the R4C alone would objectively be a buff for Ash, the same way that the P90 buff was a buff to Doc and Rook
---
This is an even larger AoE then i had considered. Interesting.
---
Mozzie is getting into my blood more when i discover more about him. Stop.
---
I Agree with everything, only F2 i think its size is alright, just my opinion tho!
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs not the op part, it‚Äôs that she has 0 recoil
---
Nah yeah 
---
Is this real? Im not an ash main by no means, but a friend is and if this is real i wanna be the first to break it to him
---
No.
---
if i recall right that sight if off, you should use reflex or reddot with glaz
---
I just bought my first season pass for this game after playing for 3 years and I have to say I‚Äôm super excited to see what these new ops can do!
---
Oh wow, two of my mains got nerfed recently. 
---
Where‚Äôs my valentine fun skin 
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right.
---
Why?
---
Ash nerf is like Christams for me!
---
shadowplay. if i did a great round i press a button and the last 3 minutes of gameplay get saved
---
What about changing gu mine like ela's concussion mine n nomad's air jab,where u can't the displacement of ur trap. So that the defender won't know which trap has been activated.
---
Ash loosing her acog ...I can‚Äôt wait for that patch
---
Sry I feel that people are smart enough to realize what I am talking about without having to specify. 
---
We better be able to drive to the map on that bike
---
Oh i see. i thought you were just saying "im assuming that's it's a reference", rather than "I know this is a reference, it has to be" 
---
Slower sprinting is too confusing, it makes the effects of gu mines even more complicated by adding yet another bullet point to the effects it causes to enemies. I say make them slightly less transparent.
---
Yeah but they re uploaded it like 2 min later so it's all around the youtube and twitter.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a pain in the ass but I‚Äôve been able to download Xbox recordings to my pc that way
---
Yeah it's real
---
Wait so gridlock, the girl, is an attacker?
---
Stopped playing siege for a couple of days and as soon as I check what's new :
---
Ash is losing an ACOG, lesion is being nerfed and dokkaebi is no longer waiting for you to pick up the phone anymore 
---
The developers know what‚Äôs right for the game and each update is trying to improve the game. So I don‚Äôt think this would be necessary 
---
Wat?
---
Is this legit?
---
people are always gonna hate changes like this, because it doesn't change the fucking weapon. the acog does not boost any stats. it does not reduce recoil, it does not increase damage. it is purely a quality of life attachment. am I bummed the R4 is losing the acog? sure, but doesn't mean the R4 is going to perform any worse. I don't get why ubi makes changes like these. it's not like people never spawnpeek with jager anymore, I know I still do, and his gun still will destroy anyone, even without aiming for the head. idk what ubi is trying to do
---
I think that would be a good idea.
---
Weak gadget can be compensated with high speed and good weapons though. You can't have it all. He'd basically be in the same place as vigil. 
---
That Clash one is a little weird, but yeah, I agree with you.
---
Lol @ all the dumbasses who were making fun of the guy who actually got it right. Mozzie is the dude defender, and gridlock is the female attacker.
---
Yo I know that guy he's an asshole
---
In what I am sure is also a reference, Mozzie is shown riding motorcycles and being very talkative, just like Goose. 
---
He said only 3 armor keep their ACOG, which is only fuze, that‚Äôs the only person who would have an AR ACOG, everyone else would lose theirs. 
---
Then the DMRs would keep theirs but that‚Äôs only including Twitch, lion, Buck, Dokkaebi, and BB. So we would have 6 ACOGs on offense, and 5 on defense. But the 5 ACOGs on defense would be on significantly better guns since some of the DMRs aren‚Äôt great in this game.
---
Bye!
---
wait so who is who. Is mozzie the one with the bike helmet? Are they the defender? A three speed defender this time? I‚Äôm so confused rn.
---
Decent idea, but I say why not just make them slightly more visible for everyone.
---
Crying is the best term for it... even tho i am crying a little :l but disappointed in ubisoft for making this hard for a lot of people is. You probably didn't read everything
---
I feel like this will help a lot, we will finally be able to play the game without getting hit by the R4-C for so much damage
---
Lovin the pre-season notes &lt;3
---
Exactly! This is what people seem to forget this, it's honestly an indirect buff to ash
---
"Joining Rainbow Six" you mean Team Rainbow?
---
And from the wording in the patch notes, even Ubi doesn't know what they're trying to do.
---
You probably didn't read the whole thing
---
Bet he mains nomad now
---
See ya!
---
Ash is an unbalanced operator and deserves a nerf for how long she has been broken.From a hit box the size a single bacteria to insane hip fire accuracy she has been broken for a while.Crying over Ubi fixing something many people have complained about is reasonable.Especially how long some of the ops have been overpowered.
---
Bye bye üëã 
---
He posted it
---
EVERYONE
---
Fuck no
---
If I'm being honest, I'm an Ash Main (also Cav Main) but I never used the ACOG on the R4-C. I felt the Reflex was much better, but I may use the G36C again because it actually has an ACOG and the R4-C doesn't. 
---
Actually though
---
Now it‚Äôs going to be everywhere 
---
Very true, and yea the hit box thing was mostly a joke, that‚Äôs the only thing people have brought up in fixing ash today. You bring up some great points, the fact that ash is so simple makes it difficult indeed. 
---
Hey Rook, pass those plates around
---
From the original teaser post on the Ubisoft website regarding operation Burnt Horizon:
---
‚ÄúOne‚Äôs a stoic Attacker who‚Äôs just there to get the job done, and the other is a quick-witted Defender who‚Äôs in it for the guts and glory.‚Äù
---
This would lead me to believe that the STOIC attacker would be the female based on how laid back she seemed in that recent trailer. The QUICK-WITTED  defender would be the male based on his lack of patience and fast reaction to the incoming convoy.
---
oh, I haven't read the patch notes, only seen posts on Reddy. what exactly did ubi say?
---
all I know is that if I never see Max‚Äôs leather jacket as a customization option for Mozzie, I will be royally pissed! 
---
better u dint play back on 1st year, smoke, bandit, jager acog, that was the best time to play this game.
---
Also the blitz nerf...
---
Just on windows people are known to melee and not shoot
---
This isn‚Äôt a democracy.  Sorry pleb
---
"do you guys not have holos?"
---
You guys are disgrace to all ash toxicans
---
Bro I got over -100000 in a ranked game as cav
---
ah yes the same thread yet again
---
Or, you big dummy, just use binoculars to play with an acog again. 
---
The defending side doesn't have too much intel. Attackers have drones which are objectively better than any defender intel gadget, and they have many ways of taking out defender gadgets safely. It's relatively balanced with the slight advantage going to the attackers when you consider their utility and general power advantage.
---
Is this going to be tested in the TTS? Or are they just gonna whip it into the game. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs gonna be implemented when the new season gets put into the TTS.
---
What about the other way and make current ranked the third game mode without a mmr system and give road to si the mmr system
---
fine but we still must rebel!!!! am i right???
---
You're making a few assumptions.  One of which is that you even know Pulse is on the map.  We aren't talking about Pro League, we're talking about Ranked.  So you can keep pretending your picking Twitch to scan me and get me, but I think you're living in a fantasy land if you think you pick the right operator to get me.
---
And if you're Buck, again, I've never gotten killed doing it.  The worst case scenario is you start blowing out the floors, even the hatch and I play out of the room.  
---
But again, I think you're missing the point.  Its free for me.  If you don't take all these precautions you're taking, I get the free kill.  If you do, I just leave.
---
IQ, Thatcher and knowing the normal spots they are put; all easy counters
---
 
---
&gt;ASH  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Removed ACOG from R4-C  
---
&gt;Ash is very popular, and very strong. Within the balancing team, we are challenging whether or not all Attackers have ACOGs by default, and feel as if Ash is a great place to learn what impact the removal of Attacking ACOGs will have. Also, her R4-C is currently picked 99% of the time, and this should help balance her weapon pick rate a bit more.
---
\*Laughs in G36-C\*
---
I've always used that one because I have Black Ice for it. I didn't know it only had 1% pick rate that's pretty incredible.
---
Ask jager and bandit...
---
Yee I see your idea now
---
But half of the problem is that other fraggers don't have the correct utility for the role. Twitch and IQ are greater fraggers, but how do claymores or breaching charges help make them effective fraggers. both should be given flashes to help with clearing out players. Not to mention that Twitch is a 2 speed and IQ's guns are far inferior to the R4-C, even without an Acog.
---
I agree but i think taking impacts was a step too far because the doesn‚Äôt have the frag power of Jager of Vigil and also has less utility  
---
cause that's how shotties work in real life duhh
---
Hell yes 
---
I love it how even Chanka's footprints are thicc.
---
Well its still on g36c and makes it more usefull.
---
that was a while ago but we could demand that
---
I‚Äôm diamond my guy. I know how to bait ringing. But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that if someone is decent at predicting they have an advantage on you from the start if they hear your phone. Specifically look at pro league, they use the ringing to cover the sound of the defuser. The mute counter is necessary to avoid these frustratingly overpowered usages. 
---
Na fam. 
---
All we know is that theres a confirmed Super shorty, other primaries are not confirmed yet.
---
As an attacker that doesn't even use Ash, this bothers me. I get balancing things and what not but realistically special ops of any kind would have access to whatever sight they want. Attackers or defenders should have that option for any gun. 
---
UwU whats this
---
Lmao you are actually a fag 
---
Same here
---
*reads patch note on ash* This does put a smile on my face.
---
Yeah but theirs actually people who unironically think she is OP
---
Just so you know, they're only removing it from the r4-c based on the fact that it had a 99% pick rate
---
I used holo for so long but mostly moved over to the reflex it has a smaller housing so i can see around it better. I've had people tell me the prefer accuracy so that's why they use holo or red dot but the bullets land at the very top of the triangle on the reflex so i'd say that's pretty accurate.
---
This happens in an game mode if you down the hostage repeatedly
---
they just keep fucking this game up lol everyone and everything is getting nerfed
---
But twitch is already used a lot over her in pro league. Shit, watching the invitational I really haven't seen much ash which makes sense since her utility is pretty trash
---
(Mobile)Go to r6 reddit front page press the three dots choose change user flare
---
That's exactly it. It's the same reason they took off other muzzle's for DMR's, because the muzzle break was the only one that was worth it.
---
If you dont "run and gun" then why are you so upset about the changes to an op whose entire kit is run and gunning? 
---
You never run out if you use Maestro‚Äôs evil eye. 
---
Is everybody anthonypit1 now
---
People are 10x more caustic is around windows, so they‚Äôre 10x more likely to notice traps on windows that on door.
---
Why they massacres my boye 
---
Lmfaooooo 
---
dont tell me what to do , buddy !!!
---
I run holo anywayü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
18 seconds is a kinda weird amount of time isnt it? 
---
Why not 20 seconds?
---
Thanks 
---
Same. Fuckin hate em 
---
All the noobs
---
No lol.  Literally everyone, besides people with an ‚Äúash main‚Äù tag, want this change.
---
Nice ACE, but c'mon is not really Ubisoft's fault...
---
I havent done it in a while but in casual and ranked you can constantly down the hostage with a pistol and that message will also show up. Honestly im surprised that this post is popping up. Ive known about it for years xD
---
Jokes on you, edgelord. I haven‚Äôt hit puberty.
---
cant wait for the Lean nerf too
---
Luckyyy
---
The kind of comments i like
---
I played a lot of them but i really don't like them as Ash. I'll say it again, ik siege aint about only fragging but thats my main role. 
---
I noticed how toxic this place is, i just report them and now i'll stop talking here with my ash main thing
---
cry about it.
---
Well by your logic we shouldnt even have operators that counter each other. If you are playing club house and you you think they are going armoury, you pick operators that are useful for an armoury push aka buck to ensure no one is in the back of armoury. 
---
"Slight" lmao 
---
Good point, then it's just the time limit. I assume you can't have unlimited time, at least I haven't found a setting for it. Max is 10 minutes I think.
---
Or is it actually a motorbike disguised as an Australian?
---
Some people just don't like the weapon cause they hate rpm
---
I seriously want to know who the fuck complained about breaching charge damage
---
The game without acogs sounds kinda shit 
---
Rip my Acog. Oh well, back to the reflex it is
---
Can Monty stop getting shot through the shield?
---
I wasn't comparing the two for being something defenders don't need and attackers do. I was comparing that it is something that had to happen
---
he rushes with his dirtbike huh, aim for the tires?
---
I would like the option for slug as well. haha 
---
i came
---
People went into a casual match and said that the ACOG was leaving the R4-C. Idk if it will slow ash down enough, since I run her G36C meme comp (although I think G36C is viable if used more as an automatic marksman now).
---
Can we appreciate that ubisoft is adding in lots of things that we have been asking for. It seems that though they have always listened to the community, they seem to have realized that the more they respond to the community with patches that are wanted and needed, the stronger the connection between the community and the developers will become. This relationship is what builds and breaks the best of games and I feel a lot of games are losing this relationship now.
---
Here's my suggestion to Ubisoft: the game is of course yours and you should keep on making what you want in it. However, also read the community feedback, think it over, and try to put in what the community wants. In the gaming industry, there has been a lot of trouble lately with companies and some of them I would say are just making honest mistakes. The thing is that if a game keeps seeming broken and a community feels ignored, they move on. So, use the test server to introduce minor patches modeled after community feedback. First try things you think may work, but also some things you think are a bit odd or ambitious. If the community latches onto a bad idea, explain that it won't work and say that you are looking into other solutions for the problem. The simple solution is the solution ubisoft is already taking, communication.
---
Honestly, everything ubisoft is doing seems to be going in the right direction. They seem to be talking with the community more and working to make the community a more welcome and open place. I for one am happy that they are taking these steps and hope that they continue to communicate with the community what they are working on and what problems they come across.
---
Dokkaebi is one of the strongest and most annoyng operators to play against. Nerf her until she doesn't exist for all I care.
---
How is there an advantage towards one side that just suddenly disappears when you switch that makes 0 sense? I try not to be that guy that says Git Gud, but that seems to actually be the problem here.
---
I‚Äôd argue the opposite.  I‚Äôd much rather right a vigil or a J√§ger in a close quarter map than an Ela.  Now on a map like bank, with it‚Äôs long sight lines, I think Vigil and J√§ger are more terrifying.   
---
The impacts for roamers usually coincides with roamers that have less impactful gadgets, like Cav and Vigil.   
---
(I only say Cav is unimpactfull because against a coordinated team she usually can‚Äôt get an interrogation) 
---
Console i can't speak to PC. I play both consoles and i play all ones i use mostly no acog. Jackle, doc, rook, and if i do which i hardly do thermite I'll use an acog. Ash, or Sofia i don't use them and those are my mains along with frost, mute and Jager. 
---
I prefer it since I'm terrible with recoil control. (I play on console with a controller) 
---
He'd be the best roamer, he could literally drone out his path while roaming.
---
Ash is still viable despite this loss. When blackbeard got his first shield nerf he became unplayable entirely until a later patch fixed the over nerf. Sledge and smoke lost their acog on the smg-11 aka your handy dandy pocket sniper. Shields were pathetic before their blast buff, and jaeger/bandit has almost 100% pickrate before their unfortunate acog incident. The difference with ash is that at least she has the g36 still with acog, and atleast she has a backup to begin with. The only backup weapons the previous nerfed has is the m870 for jaeger/bandit, but they certainly aren't for long range replacement.
---
The siege community has adapted to these changes, and it will adapt again once her acog is gone. If it needs to come back to restore order in the holy eyes of chank then it shall be so.
---
Probably not. It's written just for show. Though one would assume there is more in fiction that we'll never see.
---
I Don't have to read the comments to understand that people want  you to die. Horrible 
---
There must be one OP  you like. I was just thinking about IQ...
---
No, because pressing F signifies respect.
---
And yet my team continues to prefire the angle I‚Äôm holding from behind me
---
Everyone downvote so no one else will find this
---
It's hopefully going to cut down on idiots sitting outside baiting for 90% of the round instead of helping their team
---
May i ask rank because that may cause our opinions to differ
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
Rest In Peace Korean Wendy‚Äôs 
---
Well yeah ash certainly didn‚Äôt need a nerf.
---
Nothing to do with her
---
Extremely high pick and win rate in pro-league, casual, ranked and road to S.I
---
Multitude of glitches using the acog to shoot before you appear on enemy screens etc
---
Jokes on you, I always used the g36 because I had back ice on it
---
Regular games too
---
For me I get these weird ping spike where I go from my average ping of 9 to like 60-70 on a good day.
---
Hello Shadow_Shinobi89,
---
Please use /r/Rainbow6TTS for any discussions about the Rainbow Six Siege Technical Test Servers. For reporting issues with the TTS, please visit [R6Fix site](https://r6fix.ubi.com/ "Click here to be redirected to R6Fix"). Thank you.
---
*Your post has* ***not*** *been removed from /r/Rainbow6.*
---
Last year called, they want their card back
---
Still, there needs to be some form of punishment for not turning it off
---
Maybe because its a multiple of 3 sec? I dunno, it does seem like a really arbitrary amount of time.
---
Yeah without the ACOG I can‚Äôt see anything coming.
---
I hope they take this Acog change even one step further. I'd love to see Acogs only be available on DMR's to solidify their role as long range guns. To compensate both attackers and defenders would have access to DMRs and it would provide some more variety to defenders arsenal. Kaid basically has a DMR so it's not like they haven't thought of it.
---
Surprised to not see Ying's flashes being reworked. The fact that you can get flashed all the time despite look away and to the floor is as frustrating as playing against blitz.
---
They are also really hard to see. If you step in a frost mat or trigger a claymore or Kapkan trap, you were probably not paying enough attention or were going too fast. Lesion punishes you for not being IQ or not spraying the floor randomly. 
---
man I've been playing console siege since dust line and I never really experience half of the toxicity that most of the people on this sub say they do, either im lucky or people are lying
---
G2 and the team that loses to g2 in the finals 
---
I really do want to Finatic beat EG again because that match between those two teams was very surprising.
---
Plus her gun has only 21 bullets. With 31 you can frag easily but with 21 you have to be a lot more careful on how to want to approach and spend those.
---
But if it matchmakes you with people of similar skill, it'll be a lot easier for you to hit that 1000 score mark.
---
Sick shirt, I have the same one. :)
---
The g36c will not be used alot more. Atleast not by ash players. It's more meant for stayi ng afar and not really for rushing
---
Yes, even a after his damage nerf.
---
Oh i thought per second my bad
---
Jokes aside, i agree, bandit, jager and ash are still very powerful without acogs.
---
Imagine thinking this is actually how it works
---
OOF
---
Thats a slippery objective floor. :O 
---
Nah not really
---
Operation Burnt Horizon makes me ubi-hard
---
I'm just scared now
---
I can vouch for that.
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
The weird thing is that this is a default plant spot  and I have never seen this happen before. Probably just the one pixel where it does this.
---
wat
---
Uses the average.
---
Zero implication that ops came out broken because of acog, implication exists of ops being broken and acog having partial involvement on the weapon side of things. You see the gun nerfs for new ops come out fast enough to think that ubi pre planned them, and at the end of the day the nerfs these days are coming directly at either base damage or acog. Both of these options are usually on weapons with acog already, it seems like a one or the other sort of deal
---
The timer is like 18 seconds, if you haven‚Äôt turned it off by then, then you‚Äôre probably in a gunfight and you wouldn‚Äôt have turned it off before, beaides the enemies would already know where you are, it‚Äôs inconsequential really.
---
do you understand that G36 is only SLIGHTLY worse than R4C? Like 5% or so? There will be no difference for Ash mains at all, both guns are super strong.
---
Yep. The 18 second timeout really only makes Clash players lives slightly less annoying. 
---
I‚Äôd like to retract my statement of using Maestro, Cav is the efficient way to go. Got -1,000,000 in a single round. 
---
Well which one(s) do you have? 
---
What does Gridlock's gadget do and how does it work?
---
I have blitz and glaz
---
Impressive though considering the cord setup in my game room is ridiculously messy in comparison!
---
Not sure if this was already posted here or not, but I decided I'd post it here anyways just to be sure.
---
True. But i think the fun part of playing this game is not knowing who's next. And who you're gonna fight against, and fight with. If you're a bronze and everyone else is bronze, it's a 98% chance theres gonna be a smurf or two.
---
even with 300 ping, it should have still been a kill
---
Happens a lot. Breaks my heart to see someone break my beautiful armor plates. They're meant to be passed around, not passed away.
---
Already posted first page.
---
Is it for Ash?
---
They just buffed the red dot, it‚Äôs fine now.
---
Because I got ranked in gold 
---
My biggest complaint with red dot is that after a certain distance, it comepletely blocks the view of the enemy's head, and I frequently run into this indoors down hallways. I think what OP did is took the dot from the holo reticle and put it in the red dot cage, while also increasing visibility by reducing the thickness of the cage around it.
---
First season was Buck (Attack) and Frost (Defense), season 2 was Blackbeard (Attack) and Valkyrie (Defense) season 3 was Capitao (Attack) and Caveira (Defense) so no not really
---
Ash has joined Jager in hell
---
Spread buff, Damage nerf. So a Burf
---
Ay my boy capitao 
---
It's a dart gun not a dart drone
---
*running in the 90‚Äôs begins to play*
---
ahem, thats Mozzie
---
All those times people were frustrated the devs ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt listen‚Äù... All these changes are totally in sync with my experience in the game, and what I‚Äôve been seeing in the community. These guys totally get it. 
---
The Ash removal of the ACOG is the one thing no one asked for, but it was obvious to everyone that there was some imbalance with how good she was. She isn‚Äôt frustrating (and therefore hated) in the same way we Blitz, Doka, Lion or Legion, which meant that most of us could look the other way, but it‚Äôs healthy for the game that she be balanced out. Watch for Twitch and Mav‚Äôs pick rate to spike, as they have similar capabilities with the ACOG. 
---
Curious not seeing any mention of crouch / lean spamming. I don‚Äôt experience it as a real problem the way others do, but it‚Äôs odd that they said they were working on it and now it‚Äôs crickets. 
---
So this game is officialy dropping all the seriousness, now even with characters. This feels like a Borderlands/TF2 mix, which wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't for a "tactical shooter", nothing about this feels Rainbow Six.
---
I thought everyone knew that. If I knew that many people will up vote I would have done that a year ago
---
glaz would be way more useless without his thermal scope, i think he just needs to be a 1 speed operator with 3 armor, and they should reduce the damge on his sniper rifle.
---
&gt; It doesn't feel or look smooth on console unless you M&amp;K
---
Instantaneous 180 degree turns and quick, jerky aiming is the exact opposite of smooth.
---
Ellief from border lands 2
---
People didn‚Äôt know this?
---
Well the smurf will obviously have more skill than you, which means he can't be matchmaked against you.
---
I made it from sheet metal and a motorcycle helmet
---
It's not just custom games it's across all game modes and it's kind of an incentive to get you to not kill the hostage or hurt him/her
---
yeah lmao evidence that supports me?
---
I was playing Ela on Theme Park, I peek on a Dokkabei coming out of the bathroom from the stairs,  lock my crosshair and burst down her head, and somehow do no damage to her, with 40 ping no less lol.
---
So casual players don't deserve to have fun and fair games?
---
It works in every game mod even in casual and ranked 
---
Oof
---
2 step verification. 
---
Red dot?????
---
What kind of...
---
I mean, reflex yes, and the usual acog benefits, but with the most OP gun in the game
---
Only retards play this videogame after 4 years, I bet you're still a Goldie, lmao. At least I retired High Plat. Bye, cunt, keep feeding Ubicunts munnies.
---
Get a life.
---
If you overheal the hostage you can shoot him in the head with anything that's not a shotgun and he'll die
---
But you said by similar level and rank. I try and keep my smurfs below silver for extra fun when solo queuing on them. 
---
? sorry that you're an idiot go cry about it
---
Remember kids! suicide is not cool! as an example i will blow myself up!
---
They've mentioned castle reworks several times, there will eventually be one
---
yeah, claymores are huge on that map because all the runouts are windows. I don‚Äôt really mean toxic, I just couldn‚Äôt think of a better word. More just you have to be overly aggressive which isn‚Äôt fun for either team in my opinion. Maverick isn‚Äôt the problem, he‚Äôs just highlighted how flawed the map design is, but again that‚Äôs just my two cents. 
---
Get a better gaming chair maybe 
---
Ash is losing her penis
---
New operators gadgets are vehicles confirmed
---
Did you see the recent trailer? I was right
---
the hacker hasn‚Äôt done anything yet they probably found my account by accident
---
Why did you have to steal this and not give credit
---
Good point 
---
You‚Äôre getting confused. 
---
The hammer, in addition to stopping the attacker‚Äôs phones from ringing when in its AoE, will now ALSO stop Dok from MAKING the initial call before it even GETS to the attackers and makes their phone ring 
---
Nooo y'all are rivals SSG for the win 
---
Casual is ranked map pool + extras. 
---
Hello snottyhamsterbutt, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aqoc3v/game_randomly_crashes/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
?
---
Frost, Valk and Caviera were the defenders and Hibana was the attacker - in this order for Y1.
---
 Cue naruto sad theme
---
My issue exactly. I only use the holo sight because it has a dot that isn't taking up way too much space. Holo dot without the circle around it would be a god-send from Ubi.
---
I view it as a buff with the damage radius increase. This will make him even more viable post-diffuser plants. 
---
I actually did not remember the source and sincerely want to give credit to the OC
---
yep same hahah, and I thought screenshots of patch notes were banned anyway 
---
Nah, have you seen the recent teaser
---
you're the ... I can see me with you forever. to my ... you make my heart beat faster.
---
Uhhh
---
/r/dontdeadopeninside
---
How about the g3? If so I‚Äôm will be a ok 
---
You know it's Australia so it's upside down... Female names to the males etc.
---
Omg. I know I'm an ash main. That doesn't even matter. This isn't just coming from an ash main. This is coming from a player who enjoys siege. Taking off acog for ash? That's the dumbest idea goobisoft can do. Honestly at this point, I really think im just done with siege. 
---
I'm really at a point where I'm fuckin pissed off at goobisoft. Nerfing blitz and monty may be one thing, BUT TRYING TO SO CALLED "BALANCE" original operators AND year 1 operators are another thing. Taking off fucking Acog for ash is ridiculous. Nerfing Cav is also ridiculous. People pick her ash's r4 because it's enjoyable. Especially with the Acog. I even heard about a frost rework. If they even lay a single finger on frost. I'm officially done. Stop fucking with operators that don't need to be messed with. That's why you have a god damn test server.
---
I've been playing ever since before no acog Yager. I've been playing since the countdown from 2 seconds when going outside was 5 seconds. So to do all this with operators that are balanced, shame on you goobisoft. Shame on you. 
---
Then why not make the game more competitive and more balenced
---
Yeah you may be right about a slower rof being a better nerf for her by giving the 556. Thing for me is that I find I run IQ with the commando similarly to how ash would run the 556 and that's also seriously powerful. End of the day you might be right that having 3 speeds as fast as they are is the root problem. Another solution could be to reduce their health further so that they are more susceptible to body shots. That way the rush would carry a higher risk and 3 speeds would be more disadvantaged at blazing into 2v1 situations.
---
Ya yeet 
---
Thats why you don't play old school mario brothers before you play siege.
---
Her other gun is almost as good, it‚Äôs barely a nerf at all. Both guns should lose it if they want an actual nerf. But then again that would still leave no reason to pick her g36c.
---
Hold the phone. Man is pushing out
---
Nvm, new trailer dropped and apparently it‚Äôs her ‚Äúweb trap‚Äù
---
The maverick nerf is gonna suck, if someone is paying attention they will dome him every time without fail now. The ash change is just another change, like the one to kaid‚Äôs shotgun, that will affect pc and console in completely different ways. (Which btw we still haven‚Äôt been told when his shotgun will get buffed for console). The glaz nerf is just further proof of pandering to this sub, he absolutely does not need to be changed.
---
More and more backlogs of promised changes, yet we haven‚Äôt seen ones we were promised half a year ago or more. Not to mention the backlog of bugs such as the audio cutting out that have been around for multiple seasons. And even more bugs that haven‚Äôt been addressed such as the shield problem where on the player‚Äôs screen it‚Äôs fine but the enemy has a clean shot. Team balancing has gone to complete crap (especially on ranked). No toxicity changes for console either most likely.  Plus let‚Äôs not forget the plague that is MnK. 
---
O O F E D 
---
Wow, respect for these guys. 
---
And also, thank you. 
---
So what will they do when a squad has 4 people? Only do 4v5s?
---
Looks like Maynard James Keenan
---
Thass why mf blitz gets a nerf finally
---
As long as they don‚Äôt have those fucking awful first person psychological profiles, I‚Äôm fine.
---
I hate ash with a passion
---
I think you you're thinking of Lion, if you're standing within mute jammer then lion doesn't ping you
---
I wouldn't know about blitz, I'm a fuze shield main. I sure hope they fix the hitboxes,though bad hitboxes are nothing new in seige...

I've always been a lover of Jager and Glaz, so I've spent the entire lifespan of this game having my sights fucked with :P
---
Not to my knowledge. But how often do you TK 3 times in a single game. 
---
looks like some copper gameplay
---
ACOG are great in this game without a doubt. However, entry fraggers like Ash and Ying are mostly played with a x1 sight since their engagements should be close quarters anyway.
---
The other team must be really trash no offense that was embarrassing to watch 
---
you mean stolen from /r6g/
---
whoever cob is, he didnt make it
---
Please wait :5.0: seconds before sending another message (upvote if get the reference)
---
Ok
---
Nah g2‚Äôs gonna win
---
I feel you. Very disappointing they fell so early in the groups... and to immortals of all teams. Not saying they‚Äôre bad but SSG barely beat them on the third map.
---
Slashug said once that he wanted to see what his team could do in a showdown with g2 and of rogue didn‚Äôt loose in the group stages, they would be in SSG‚Äôs position currently. 
---
Really hate how team USN  the only NA team known to compete with EG really fell off so suddenly 
---
I'm obsessed with the icons and the cell shaded artwork, But what does his icon resemble kinda like how I'm confused with Kaid and Maverick's icons.
---
No she didn't 
---
It already has like 10k upvotes and 7 golds by default
---
The intel and defuser denial was the main benefit from the Gu mines. Damage nerf isn‚Äôt that bad. 
---
I thought it was purple tho
---
I knew something was wrong with Mira‚Äôs head hitbox
---
You are bad because you missed the shot and you missed the shot because you are bad.
---
Sort of a fat bastard complex you got goin there.
---
Ive never ran into that situation
---
Looks like an error than anything that has to do with the operator
---
Absolute POGGERS
---
Tiny but beautiful
---
They will be making adjustments to dlc operators prices soon. Basic concept is that the oler operator is the lower price will be.
---
If they don‚Äôt loose to EG that is. SpaceStation is a bit underwhelming to be going against g2 so early in the finals. SSG will need to make Rampy the best fragger ever to stand up against them 
---
Stop describing me. 
---
Nah, he is very overpicked both in pro league and high ranks. His intel is invaluable.
---
Can I just say, Gridlock (in the trailer) sounds exactly like Rimmy Downunder Gaming
---
Dude i agree with some of your points. For the most part though you are delusional and you should just stop playing because you do not know how things work and these balance changes are great imo, not even a huge deal you're making it out to be. Like damn man take a breather and just relax lol
---
I mean, it's been a year and all they needed to do is change his speed and ads time. The R6 balance team overall does a shitty job and takes ridiculous amounts of time for the simplest changes. Examples (Glaz, Lion, Dok,Glaz,Blitz, Nomad, BB). Now think of these ops and the changes they need, and how long they've gone untouched. 
---
I think area of effect is WAY too big, he can cover a whole room with 1shot.
---
g3 better anyway, nearly identical ttk fraction the recoil
---
ACOG if you can, IMO red dot &gt; holo, reflex has the smallest housing. 
---
No he/she is talking about when it says attecker and defender. Mozzie is the defender while Gridlock is the attacker.
---
Looks like it might be a jammer that sticks to walls and stuff like Kaid is. The Mute Kaid in a way
---
Epic
---
The real question is, where are you on the planet cause my night could be your morning
---
Majority of the player base is on PS4. 
---
When are these live in game?
---
Exactly. This nerf doesn‚Äôt change anything about ash rushers. Rushing with a 1x sight is actually better than rushing with an acog because you‚Äôve got a wider field of view and can react faster with peeking doorways and clearing rooms. As soon as ash gets in the building, the difference is negligible except that it hurts new/lower ranked players who aren‚Äôt comfortable without an acog on attack
---
What exactly do the developers want Blitz to be?
---
I find your lack of melees disturbing.
---
\*Hums the wicked witch is dead\*
---
4v4s
---
But the biker is the defender. Lmao
---
How this meta hasn't been nerfed for a whole year 
---
It's never been better imo
---
The ‚Äú#objective‚Äù
---
Play something else then
---
para bellum was my fav season, this one‚Äôs shaping up to be great as well
---
*cough* buff alibi so clones match her skins and attachments *cough*
---
So then siege is only 1v1s, 2v2s, 3v3s, 4v4s, and 5v5s?
---
Don‚Äôt forget they probably had on better gaming gloves as well.
---
You sounded like butthead at the end.
---
No I think I‚Äôll stick with siege, but thanks!
---
That is kind of the point though. A person with no real utility was being picked 70% of the time. That is a bit much.
---
I was just playing I just want to have fun not care how I play. 
---
That would be nice 
---
Welcome to Siege Newcomers 
---
Aside from sky's, what other competent players wanted this?
---
Ah yes I'm sorry, I looked at the post again. And other comments. Others are saying if she's in range of a mute jammer she can't call you. Similar to how mute can jam blitz's flashes. 
---
Except ash mains aren‚Äôt allowed to touch their drones. 
---
But why not rework frost?
---
Holy shit how did I not make that connection
---
Not enuf nerf.
---
She'll move down, but not drastically. This is just a quality of life improvment. It's still almost 20 seconds. If you know what you're doing that's more than enough time to get shit done. Her cam hack is still useful considering maestro, valk, and bullet proof. 
---
There's seriously a LOT there, man.
---
...but it would also make his Gu worthless. Kapkan and Frost traps are obvious but they‚Äôre balanced by doing big damage. What good would an obvious little mine do? That would destroy Lesion 
---
I have a crazy theory: Mozzie and Gridlock can be used on both sides. Mozzie can hack cameras/drones he can reach with his gadget depending on the side and Gridlock can use her trap as a trap or roamer counter depending on her side.
---
I say this because there has been way too many "errors" regarding which one is defense and which is attacker. Even the blog post today that showed them to us had a mistake since the video and text claimed different things about which is a defender and which is an attacker, and its not the first official source to be wrong about that as different country's Ubi site had conflicting info too. Maybe it's not a mistake and they are both correct. 
---
Hibana:

*chuckles* I'm in danger

Paul Hogan is prolly the only aussie alive to ever say shrimp.. We say fucking prawns mate and they deadset don't go on the bloody barbie.
---
Doesn't sound australian enough 
---
Just down them
---
They better be saying "check mate" when they kill someone
---
I don‚Äôt like this because then you have no idea if the Gu is still there. It could be destroyed by Twitch, Thatcher, or even a teammate and you‚Äôd never know. Sure you can say the sake for EEDs, but those aren‚Äôt really used for information in the way Gu‚Äôs are 
---
100 percent real ? When has something written in patch notes not happened lol I can‚Äôt remember if it ever did
---
I personally don't like how the icons have becoming less and less descriptive of the ops ability. 
---
Seems more like an ATK Frost
---
‚ÄúWtf is his wrong with his problem‚Äù. ü§£

What about Alibi and her octupus?

I didnt know this

Use the G36C.. It has barely any recoil with acog and does literally 1 Damage less with a slightly lower fire rate..
---
&gt;obsolete gun
---
yikes
---
Nothing further on crouch spam
---
video got removed, the blog post should be correct 
---
We need the tachanka lmg to be able to pierce the shields
---
I think they changed or posted wrong in the first time, in the official ubiaoft websitesite says Gridlock is the woman and Mozzie is the man
---
True. It will still be able to give away your position.
---
Maybe they should decrease the slowing effect when you step on a gu and the sound could be quieter
---
Anybody knows if these team uniforms and skins are seasonal? Or do they stay in the shop permanently?
---
I really appreciate that they gave an update on what they're currently working on.
---
The designer notes for Y4S1 at least do
---
You forget to zero the scope in? Yeah that'll do it. 
---
What they do tho?
---
I think they look great. The pink is a color we don't have yet and it matches the Burnt Horizon promotional material.
---
&gt; watching the invitational I really haven't seen much ash
---
i have seen Ash picked a lot in the few invitational matches that i have seen. for example, in EG vs Lestream, Uuno always picked Ash in attack and so did Canadian when they attacked. 
---
RIP Shroud's Blitz main. 
---
G2 is not in it's prime right now I think and the empire boys are definitely spicy. So I can see Empire winning the invitational so far. But it seems anything's possible rn
---
Thank you for the only sensible reply.
---
Wouldn't be too far of a stretch to suggest the reason they're pink is cause they're S.A.S.R (aussie S.A.S).
---
r/absoluteunits
---
Tbh I got sent this had not even seen the patch notes 
---
Well to be fair Maestro, Alibi, Maverick and Zofia really don‚Äôt have icons similar to ability and that‚Äôs just off the top of my head.
---
I try but i figured you had enough toxicity for one day lol
---
I thought that was white light?
---
Seems like his Gadget has a proximity radius to trigger on a drone, also I read that once hacked he can't control the drone but can check what it sees + the drone owner gets alibi style pinged once he uses the drone.
---
Buy credits
---
but nothing about crouch / lean spamming? 
---
I can confirm, having over 1,000+ hours on it, Xbox siege is so toxic compared to both ps4 and PC combined. Im glad I switched
---
All things considered this is honestly not that bad.  Should it happen? I don't believe so, but I've seen plats playing against  all silvers by having a couple coppers. These just look like some friends playing together. 
---
..but the area of the breach charge's explosion gets bigger, doesn't it?
---
Hi again 
---
iv'e re downloaded siege overnight and just went into the ini files this morning and fps cap was 0 also re downloading didn't fix still capped at 60 in lobby but in game i get 70ish but it still drops when it has to re-render something or i'm moving to fast
---
i don't know what to do at this point i might just contact ubisoft (it'll be fun seeing how long it will take for a response XD) 
---
cheers again
---
They're pissed
---
Sorry. Theres was much confusion.
---
personally i only seen twitch drone zapping people on console. on PC it seems to be destroyed immediately because people use a mouse. i think Twitch losing her ACOG would be great for console, because her drone is quite useful here.
---
Big oof. Ranked siege is fun to test your skills, but sadly, you really do have to be in a party if you want to consistently climb. Otherwise this happens more often than it should /:
---
*attack frost.
---
She uses a converted car wheel trap that downs enemies on walking over. Also no deployment time since you drop them and they setup themselves.
---
Almost like we didn't know until know and most times you came off rude
---
True , well it‚Äôs happening lol 
---
Well I'm out, between this and a the idiot from Liquid essentially antagonizing fans which resulted in death threats to Mock-it, I'm done. As someone who plays every operator, the Ash nerf makes zero sense, as everyone will use the G36C with ACOG now, and they will STILL rush in like they do now. Was fun while it lasted but I'm trash at this game. I'll be back if this ridiculous nerf is undone.
---
It may also be a buff

DID YOU WIN?
---
Like, I wish I was joking. I kinda am in that I'm trying to make this more light-heart'd but....this is the norm in Siege, even on PC, but particularly on console.
---
The number of end-of-game screens that wind up looking like this mess of stupidity ties, if not *outnumbers* the number of times you get an end-of-game screen that looks somewhat sane. You've got almost every problem in here;
---
- Plats (Diamonds do it too) exploiting low ranks for easy matches and easy points
---
- Multiple SoloQ vs. obvious Premade
---
- No Comms
---
- Gold rank apparently means goddamn nothing because of the wildly varying skill level
---
- Leavers
---
- Ragers
---
thats definitely something that crossed my mind as well...we'll see
---
A lot of people made this mistake, gridlocke is the female.
---
This document implies that the doc in question isnt playing him just so he can jiggle peek corners with an ACOG on defense. 
---
Seriously tho is it just me or have all the jager mains from 2017 finally settled on playing doc 24/7 ?
---
i don‚Äôt care about the ttk the gun is a fucking laser with no recoil and high fire rate
---
TaKe aWaY tHe oPeRatOrS gAdGeT

True, but dokkaebi true purpose of hunting down roamers is still a thing.
---
If that was my old gig, I would get severely yelled at for doing that. No cable should cross each other, and if it does, it crosses on a straight angle. Plan where your cables go beforehand and work from the inside then out.
---
\* Walking into range of Mute jammers will hang up phone calls during the call \* IMO it might be too much of a nerf to Dokkaebi, I think they should ring for at least 5-8 seconds when running for a jammer's area of effect, it should definitely take 2-3 seconds longer than holding the button to disable it.

When I play ranked with my squad my mates sometimes decide to have autism

What's your point
---
Gridlock is disgusting holy fuck
---
I saw her a bunch on border iirc. On other maps not so much.
---
I do think she's strong though, but I don't think she's overpowered since if you don't frag with her on most maps, her utility just becomes utter shit 
---
Getting rid of bugs isn't a buff... it's just fixing bugs.
---
More like a buff imo. 
---
Can we get some F for our favourite no hitbox operator
---
AKA Barnesy, a national icon
---
I've seen and been in those matches too; and that kind of problem is evidenced here by the Plat playing with the Silver - which either shouldn't be allowed or be forced to matchmake at the Plat level, not Silver/Gold.
---
Okay Ubi, just listen your players and try to not destroy this game. Enought change old operators now! I know that new operators OPs are good for business, but plis, don‚Äôt eraser our legends operators for that. And more, give to console comunity a TTS. We want a voice too!
---
That's how siege works
