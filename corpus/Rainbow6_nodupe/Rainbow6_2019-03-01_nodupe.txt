---
You can see it in the recoil control (which is damn near perfect), and the snaps. I‚Äôve played with people who have admitted it, and it is really noticable once you know what to look for.
---
Yeah I see what you mean. I started playing Seige in Grim Sky but I knew of the game before that because of YouTube. Nowadays I just dont want to play anymore because of tryhards in Casual and toxic team killing 
---
Jesus, how thirsty do you have to be to lust after a colored-in outline of a ridiculously sexualized caricature of a video game character?
---
TWOBAD CHARM DOOD!!!!!
---
I mean, you only get like 25 less points if they outright take the kill. I think it's the same points if the enemy gets injured, even if you don't injure them.

George and pengu's hours are close (kind of) with pengu sitting around 10,000 as he said and George is at about 7500 last time he checked I believe? Both players are extremely dedicated to the game and I think both of them deserve a charm and I'm sure pengu will get one eventually 
---
They don‚Äôt want their secrets leaked. 
---
F
---
No nerfs yet.
---

---
I think Mozzie is balanced but I personally expect Gridlock to lose one of her traps at some point. IMHO three is too much considering how few flanks you actively have to worry about in most matches.
---
A more interesting nerf to her that I've heard suggested is slow walking would allow you to walk over the traps, the idea being you are walking in between them at the cost of speed. With that I can see her keeping all three.
---
With how this game is balanced for the majority of items it always seems like you aren't actually "spending" them until you only have two, it always feel like the first is a freebie and only with the last two are you impacting your role if you use them wrong. Mute and Bandit would be the exceptions to this idea though.
---
i dont own a ps4 butbwouldnt waste my money on the game a second time. my name is Bent_On_Border_ look me up on r6 tracker if u need proof that im bad and or pc
---
Imo, there shouldn‚Äôt be an ability to use the usb ports to play then. If you can‚Äôt fix it, don‚Äôt make it an option. Everyone has dualshock controllers already, so you wouldn‚Äôt deprive anyone by making it bluetooth only. At least for competitive games like R6.
---
I can agree on the chunky meatball man point but not the hot Spanish teacher one. We get dokk harassing echo because he‚Äôs fat as hell and gridlock on the other side supporting him
---
I‚Äôm none of them :D
---
Hahahah. Its Mozzie!
---
I like her old face personally looked terrifying.
---
I‚Äôm reuploading the video as soon as the moderators reply
---
Not Ubi, but the Sony can. Just dont make the game playable through USB ports for ranked at least.
---
And sorry, I haven‚Äôt followed this thread closely so I didn‚Äôt know whether it is a really talked about issue.
---
Actually no sarcasm here, just out of the loop. Why doesn't Tuxbird get one if Bikini do?
---
This post was made by thermite gang
---
Its way at the bottom I told you what the question was in my other comment
---
You have Kansas and Arkansas! Explain America!
---
If they change my Mira... the consequences will never be the same.
---
Dang, I'm sad neither varsity, nugget, or matimi0 still aren't getting anything. Still, it's nice to see a non-English streamer get a charm! Feel like it's important not to neglect the international part of siege. 
---
thermite and habana do the same thing but one does it a little differently. If Ubisoft wants to have a hundred operators then there's going to be some overlap. bandit and mute do the same thing, mute is more passive, he doesn't destroy drones or breach/thermite charges.  
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Exactly, pc people tend to be faster at turning around and shooting the evil eye 
---
Exactly
---
The video is 30 seconds long 
---
Is this confirmed? If so, I‚ÄôM EXCITED AS FUCK!
---
yeah having a mixture or something. If Ubisoft wants to have hundred operators there is going to be some overlap.
---
thanks
---
Start it at the kill
---
Very clean. Bravo to you my good sir
---
if there is anything you want to add on or change let me know.
---
Thanks for your comment. Some people just got pissed because I didn‚Äôt know this. I hope that Sony &amp; Microsoft see that this pisses the majority of the players off. The thing is that it is very fixable, which makes me mad. 
---
&gt; badahonkedidilyblonkers
---
That‚Äôs a new one.
---
I unfollowed his stream because every time he got killed it was  from some "trash kid," and KG would scream "WHY IS HE EVEN THERE?!!!  WHAT A PIECE OF TRASH!"
---
Got so old, and annoying.  Just take the L and give respect where it's due.  Not everyone is trash, and you aren't above being legitimately beat.
---
"If she's 13 I'm 13"
---
But this would make many aces less than 30 seconds, Its just my opinion that aces should be counted from The start of the round 
---
What about the prep phase?
---
Exactly, even when its only 2v1 I tell the other person lets both go in different ways at the exact same time, but nope they decide they want to go in before I can get to the other way in, then they die

Here's the Mega Thread. scroll down until you see "Playlist changes"
---
For the record I'm not downvoting anyone. I'm merely disagreeing with your definition. Fooling around *passively* hurts the team, it means you're dead weight at worst but you're not doing anything that obstructs anyone else from playing the game how they wish.   
---
A Rook placing armour outside causing me to face armoured attackers, that is *actively* hurting my team and that's what I call toxic, and of course that's alongside all the obvious parts like bleeding or destroying gadgets, or writing your team's locations in chat.    
---
But merely being ineffective, that's passive, therefore not toxic.  
---
His name os GiantWaffle 
---
Don't count prep phase unless you want to as twitch. The ace time should be started when you can move around and kill with the enemy with a gun
---
I'm sorry people like the art???
---
I start it from the kill but, your call man.
---
Yeh
---
Running all the way outside to bait people and using your equipment 100m from the closest entrance to the building let alone the objective is pretty toxic if you ask me.... Not helping actual gameplay at all. Hilarious, and these kids are dumb for falling for it, but imo definitely a toxic move. And i don't tend to agree with a lot of what people call toxic.

It's a team game
---
Bug where you can use a deployable shield to cover your upper body while still being able to shoot
---
Level doesn‚Äôt mean shit in this game. You could be level 400 and be trash af. All that matters in a game like siege is your skill, how much time you take into learning new angles, learning the meta, and learning from your deaths.
---
Hibana? More like Dumbana.
---
You have to buy the original operators with renown (currency earned by playing matches). If you go into the ‚Äúplay‚Äù tab and watch all three tutorials (you can just skip them) you should get 200 renown a piece. That‚Äôll give you enough to buy the first operator from any given CTU. The first operator bought from a CTU costs 500 renown. The second costs 1000, the third costs 1500, and the fourth costs 2000.
---
Bitch deserves it
---
Yeah they're just mad cuz they know they'd fall for it haha. I've been playing since season one, it's videos like these that still give me hope. I just hate how misused the word toxic is. Great work though, this video truly is incredible. If i had any gold or silver i'd give it to you. I'm a peasant, though, so.... The upvote is gonna have to do üòÇ
---
But mute isn‚Äôt sledge. 
---
People say Fuze should be a 2 speed, 2 armor which is stupid because he has access to a shield and look what happened with Bliz when they buffed his speed, Finka has a terrible AR and Nomad has 2 awful guns even though the AK74 is the better choice. 
---
Also Mira is an anchor so of course she's gonna be a 1 speed 3 armor they just aren't fun to use on attack but defence is understandable.
---
My first thought was why didnt you rienforce that hatch lol. Bet it didnt matter though.
---
Maverick isn‚Äôt useful on every map but on say Clubhouse he‚Äôs banned a lot since you can‚Äôt Bandit trick
---
I need to do that honestly just after lsoing that much footage of good clips I couldnt touch siege for like 3 months haha. still getting my groove back.
---
If you have Steam then my name is EXE.EXE hit me up and i‚Äôll play with ya
---
The problem with that video is, that it is 1080p and has those cinematic bars at the top and bottom. If that is the only thing i get ill go for that, but atm id rather look for something better
---
Never thought I'd be envious of someone over a coaster.
---
Good luck, I'm just waiting for the new season to start and then I'll be back at it.

Also helps Buck's Skeleton Key, though one shot vaultable hole distance needs to be relearned

EOtechs lose zero if you sneeze on them. That's why they had to pay a [$25.6 Million](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/01/21/eotech-breaks-silence-over-defective-sights.html) settlement fee.

Side note for those interested in the topic of sound design; Sound is actually an area where ray-tracing is relevant, but it requires much less computation than using ray-tracing for graphics, so it can actually be done on existing hardware without any special RT acceleration.

I started playing agian about a month ago and that cavi triple was like the sign I finally am getting my groove back. I miss the feeling of carving through the enemy team like butter. 
---
I think you should see a Doctor right away regardless. That kind of symptom isn't a normal occurrance.
---
It might be from lack of sleep, caffeine, and too much strain on the eye; or all of the above.
---
Loosing 150 mmr in one match is terrible. When you gain 50 mmr in a win. Not sure why they punish a loss so much.  This gets really bad after a big sale and the game gets filled with Smurfs working thier way back up (on PC)
---
Try hard with recruit in casual 
---
Ultimate edition is misleading - it only unlocks the original ops (FBI, GIGN, GSG9, Spetznas, SAS). The DLC operators have to be unlocked via renown (in-game credit earned by playing games, or can be bought with actual money). Buying a season pass will make new operators that come out in that year to be free, and also allow access to new operators a week before they are released to everyone else. 
---
What placement? 
---
That timing thoooo
---
Not gonna lie. your playing against noobs on console. cool vid though
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I was screaming the entire time watching that attempt ‚ÄúJUST LOOK DOWN FOR LIKE HALF A SECOND AND YOU‚ÄôLL GET THROUGH‚Äù
---
The operator icon 
---
&gt; Regardless of toxic or not, it IS an awesome clip.
---
In that we agree.
---
    
---
Well, it's casual. Most people would go after the two, if not for kills, then out of curiosity. These guys just played like ass.
---
if you change your game settings it'll raise and lower

Basically the future of all games and now finally r6s is looking into it

Jackal must of been alive for like 147 years damn

These are amazing nice job

Smoke lookin F I R E

Thanks, glad you like em!

I'm not confused about what Maestro and Frost are doing.
---
I'm concerned about what the hell those morons on the other team are doing.
---
Literally all those frost traps except one are in the open. Maestro's cam had to open to shoot them, so it should have been easy to take out. Dokkaebi counters maestro cams simply by calling him. Buck has fucking frag grenades. 
---
How does the jammer break ongoing calls, if you are near one or if Dokkaebi is near one
---
It's a form of eye strain, give the game a break for about a week and if it persists go see a doctor
---
Did the other toxic streamers get charms though?
---
Just telling you bro or brah (no h8 2k19) you‚Äôd make a lot off Etsy I love coaster sets üò∞

Knowing how dumb I am, I would totally fall for this
---
Dont worry soon people will be allowed one team kill then will take damage after
---
&gt; I don't see anything positive with it
---
There's nothing about it that is supposed to be positive, it's designed to throw you off...
---
If shellshock wasn't in the game, then it 1) wouldn't be realistic at all, and 2) would make the game childs play and would break a competitive aspect of it.. Also, imagine being able to turn it off individually, how much of an advantage that would give you over someone that didn't have it turned off.....
---
Lol, noobs
---
It‚Äôs not a secret, it‚Äôs just a long animation.
---
That shouldn't have been the way to deal with team killing, a forgive option would've been way better

Chaotic good
---
I hate that you need to be subbed to them, abd I don't know if they made a Mr. Pit charm, I just wished yiu can link your YT account with your UPLAY so you can get certain charms 
---
Just a tip: always keep your crosshair/reticle at crouching head height or standing head height. You're aiming at the floor so much so when you get into a fight you will begin shooting their shins which isn't ideal.

Never seen console kids this bad. This is a new breed

Would've laughed even harder if you killed your teammate, you died from someone else, and then the hostage died.

But it makes it so much more satisfying when you counter spawnpeek and they immediately ragequit

In the past he struggled with depression, I think. I don't really watch him, but I'm worried he might be going through stuff again. I hope he'll get some form of break.

3 or 4 stack the guy had I bet. But yea toxic is here still. It was worst when I first started that was during the first season pass release time in nov I came in. I bet I missed it being the worst in the beginning.
---
Exactly. This isn't Team Deathmatch.
---
the way he was out of sight while killing your team and was only visible for an instant before you died was like a horror movie
---
Put traps in good spots, put barbed wire in other places. When people see barbed wire and they know there's a frost they immediately get suspicious. I'll usually put traps in their own places, and wire in common doorways to distract enemies for a second while they look for traps.
---
Weight. 
---
Yes and no depends on the situation an what the type of weapons the enemy are using 
---
give this man an award\^

You forgot the trash can

In it's current state, no.

But in its original state, yes. Perfect for a marksman.

Just found out why maverick is sad in his portrait he has no dou to be with :(

I'm not against this.

Unless you place them on the very first door the enemies go through

I think it would be somewhat effective irl but unlike the game if you take a bullet or two to the chest your either gonna be really injured or dead

Assuming there are materials strong enough to withstand bullets, projectiles, and shrapnel that are light enough to mount onto a rifle and not encumber optics...? Maybe.

Honestly, Tachanka's Ballistic glass and Mira's black mirror are more practical than Blackbeard's portable rifle shield.

Yah the lack of good headgears is astonishing

Yeah, but what's so special about this? You're telling me this is with this many upvotes?

I gave you an upvote for my trouble lol

10x better than the masks we get in R6. We‚Äôre getting fucking unicorns ü¶Ñ instead. I don‚Äôt even understand where this game wants to go anymore...

I did this as well, I had four people run into one trap.

When I started playing I mained rook without ACOG, I haven't played him much since being around lvl 30-35 and I have a 1.8kd with him still. They wouldn't be trash without it, you'd just play them differently.

Forwarded this to Rob. Maybe it'll bring him back.
---
Well okay. His ability is hard to master i know. But i still like the way it is. Maybe there shouldnt be any operators for beginners. If there is no operators for beginner ubisoft would have to rework mute, rook, ash, blackbeard, fuze, thermite, hibana, sledge..... these operators are easy to use but hard to master. Also why shouldnt there be few operators that fits for new players?
---
Heavily dislike border, if I‚Äôm honest I don‚Äôt think I like any of the Seasonal maps

The headshots don't register in that game.

Sweaty Caveira mains and claymores?

This happened to me in a ranked and I was so confused 
---
The old operator icons did look very epic, but the new icons suit better. Kind a like mix of both would be nice. The style of the old, with the pictures of the new
---
What I mean to say is that no operator should be balanced around low level players, this game revolves around high level tactics and teamwork. If an op would be improved at the cost of him getting harder to use for newcomers the op should get the change. 
---
&gt;chronic insomnia

Borders like one of the best maps in the game, why do you think its played so often?
---
Jacket lion
---
Cavs knife. My teammates.
---
Maybe. But eventually i dont think Ubisoft will be do a big changes to Mute. Lets just hope that if does it wouldnt become OP af or weak af. 
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
That be awesome,
---
but you don't even have him record new lines necessarily, a lot of this quotes can easily be applied to any situation in Siege

Let‚Äôs not forget about Chalet
---
I think making him a 3 armor while giving him an acog would be auto balancing, it gives him all the disadvantages of being a 3 armor while giving him a tremendous acog advantage. 
---
Cav in a bodysuit? Nut.
---
I want the old rank logos back 
---
That would deprive people of charging their controllers while trying to play
---
Well if i was that doc i would take a grenade of some sort
---
Nope. You can charge without communicating with the PS4. Charge transmitts through the ground and voltage pins of the USB, while information is sent through the TX and RX pins inside the USB (among others). Just disable the comm pins and leave the charging pins alone
---
Think this will become the new inside washing machine meta for people who wanna be lame?
---
yes please i want para bellum music
---
The only one I‚Äôm not a fan of is IQ. The other ones either fit the character really well, look good, or are historically accurate.
---
That was fucking hilarious 
---
Why is shroud getting one? There‚Äôs others that should have one way before him
---
Probably
---
Not gonna fly
---
He juat wants a beer man
---
I like how the Zofia and Fuse didn't understand how your Evil Eyes worked.
---
That ela hop out üòÇüòÇ
---
O have to get BikiniBodhi charm and put it on the frost
---
&gt;prematurely pregnant
---
What does this even mean?
---
I totally agree with this bc I think that bb is a pretty fun operator to play but his ads is unreasonable considering how slow everything else is
---
especially with the power of ACOG on their side.
---
thats the most toxic shit ive ever seen
---
Depends how hard you throw 
---
It means he wasnt ready to have a baby
---
Yes! I'm glad I've not had to see most of these things that others have described.
---
Lol too me shroud seems kinda like an off brand ninja.  He‚Äôs a big enough name that everyone wants to get on there game so they‚Äôll do anything for him   I mean I like him but I wouldn‚Äôt have picked him for a charm this early 
---
Sierra paradise , The hospital , and the nest . those are my favorite /s
---
*Delsin Rowe and the D.U.P would like to know his location*
---
Also look's like he is wearing swim goggles 
---
I would say go cry about it but you seem to have beaten me to it. Stop being such a pussy. I go through plenty of coppers every day who don't get harassed. Clearly you're doing something wrong. It's your fault.
---
Smoke and mute look really fucking good, thatchers mask is a bit big but looks nice. I dont really like the color for sledge, but thats just personal taste. 
---
Nobody likes big maps it‚Äôs just not as fun walking half the game just to end up either sprinting to the objective or getting raped by a roamer
---
Through the wind, and the chill, and the rain, AND THE STORM AND THE FLOOD. I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood

Hello llNabs, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aw1scu/hey_guys_and_gals_just_wanted_to_get_some/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
There‚Äôs no angled grip available for the SR-25, that‚Äôs what I main. Made sense kinda for when the damage was at 72, but that‚Äôs not the case anymore
---
Yes, 2500MMR
---
You could use lesion as well
---
Well the scar can have an angled grip. I dont think he needs a buff to the ads since that would make him too strong at peeking.
---
Yea I agree
---
Cav and Alt+F4
---
You can make it near perfect, but prepare to spend a shit ton of time running test prints and screaming at your machine
---
But doesn't Blood Orchid theme play from time to time? 
---
Yo that's dope
---
I think the d e t a i l s were a bit off
---
The end justifies the means. 
---
Idk how they could do it but I‚Äôd LOVE it if they added the option to ‚Äúshove‚Äù with the shield in a way that basically pushes the enemy away but still keeps the shield in front of your face.
---
This way you could have a safe but non lethal option to be offensive in addition to your melee which comes at the cost of your head being exposed from it.
---
Especially because right now dealing with shields is just a giant load of bumfuckery  and a good deal of luck for both players.
---
Why did 2 people leave your team?
---
You have the right to defend the guiding by any means necessary 
---
He's asking if it's worth it. I'm saying that the RNG is too high for me, personally. I've even received a ton of Black Ice skins (among other things I do in fact like) and I still don't like the nature of the packs. If he wants to get something specific then buy the bundle or a single piece- whatever. But with packs it *IS* RNG. That's all i was saying. No need to jump my ass for an opinion.
---
Please make a vigil one
---
He‚Äôs on the list for sure!
---
I‚Äôve been kicked before I even know the map or players 
---
That's a good idea yeah, and no biggiee!
---
I think he was also joking about how smoke is a defender not an attacker
---
Oregon and bank 
---
Uni is prob going to patch it now
---
quick question why does nomad have the most iconic koloshnikov ak47 but the russians only have the ak12
---
Nah the enemies could have easily killed him but they were looking away and/or proning. They are noobs and so are you.
---
Yea itd be cool if maybe after the first month of a new season, the menu screens would just cycle through the operator animations of each operation. Somethings that has always bothered me about siege is that there's never a default menu screen. Idk why it bothers me tbh, but I think something like that would not only be cool to see but would also make the beginnings of seasons more special since that's when the entire menu is dedicated specifically to the new ops 
---
What is?
---
KingGeorge is like the 2nd most popular r6 streamer behind MJ and like the most consistent one. I'm surprised it took this long for him to get a charm. 
---
&gt;because usually i ruin my own drawing when i color it haha
---
You proved yourself wrong, this is amazing work
---
Less tactical so if you meta rush it's easier to rank up + more of the "sweatier" players play bomb only 
---
So sad. I'm not at my ps4
---
Oof yeah, makes sense. The ‚ÄúTB‚Äù at the beginning of the names. They probably threw and right before they‚Äôd lose they knocked him off. Big boi oof right here 
---
Why can‚Äôt to be a tachanka main?
---
Notice me sentpai
---
Russian badger
---
i noticed the pig one is a purple seasonal skin, is there gonna be another one for burnt horizon? got any ideas?\\
---
???
---
If you go by average viewership, he's 2nd after MacieJay.  
---
Wind bastions look like someone dipped their uniforms in mac and cheese
---
You can stop worrying about kids now
---
King George got a charm but Matimi0 didn‚Äôt? That‚Äôs janky considering they‚Äôre on opposite ends of the toxicity spectrum. 
---
It will reset when the new season starts, as always
---
Just to confirm your point on them being ps4 codes is incorrect. 
---
These codes are universal, you put them into the redeem website and select your platform. You have the choice of PC PS4 or Xbox One. 
---
Yes 
---
You want to see me run to that mountain and back? 
---
J√§ger himself doesn‚Äôt, all his content is others peoples work, it‚Äôs a fact and you‚Äôll never find any evidence against it
---
Base operators are cheap and let new players get to learn them one at a time. Starting a new game and having to immediately try and learn like 20 different ops is a bit overwhelming.
---
You dont need to be either. Redeem-rainbow6 website 
---
I got dain bramage watching this
---
Retreat!
---
How you get points? No info yet.
---
Smurfs? No information yet.
---
It's changes to game format this year. At least, that's what we know so far.
---
Someone experiment and try to exploit this lol
---
Oh cool. I'm shattered that I can't choose Dokkaebi but i guess i'll check out everyone else. :)
---
Any tips?
---
No.
---
It just multiplies the sensitivity. 0.02 is the default. If you use 0.2 and your ADS at 5 then it will be the same sensitivity. 
---
What if we used 100% of our brain?
---
Take my upvote good sir
---
what about cav? i know she has
---
Nope 
---
1:1 is ADS sensitivity 83.
---
So, what people generally run is 10-20 x and y, and ADS 83, with DPI 400.
---
83 is 1:1 sens.
---
Paint it brother
---
Dokkaebi won't be very helpful to you since her ability is to make the enemies phones ring and well that requires sound unfortunately. But it can be useful to your team.
---
As for tips, just play the game a lot and play it smartly. That's all my brother does when he plays the game. He doesn't get too aggressive, he plays slow and relaxed. 
---
I sure do hope that was a joke.
---
WHY IS KAPKAN A TRAP?!?!
---
Watch the tutorials for a free 800 renown and you can get a base op, they don't give you any any more.
---
"Copper to Silver players are a gift from God". This is a comment made by a Gold IV (current rank). Interesting XD
---
We're not getting one unfortunately.
---
Oh, thats how its done. Here i was leaping straight down into the stairwy and downing myself like a pleb
---
Like most said, Thatcher‚Äôs head is too wide. Sledge looks a bit smaller than his original size. Probably because the shoulders are smaller and the neck is smaller too 
---
im going to touch it coz its already broken to begin with
---
Lower fov means easier pixel peeking, if you want info about surrounding, then you need better headphones 
---
Standard and starter are the same thing now.
---
Maybe on low setings in 60fps
---
Sorry to say but sadly that's not at all how the lasers work, with pistols. In the end the bullet can, and *will*, land all over the place of the hipfire crosshair.   
---
The only way to reduce the size of that, and thus spread, is by standing perfectly still, which can then be further increased when crouching.
---
Definitely not a smurf (TM)
---
What do you mean it is broken?? Just put it to 0.02 and leave it there.
---
0.02 is the default, it's not broken at all.
---
Amazing.
---
Plane lol 
---
Please?
---
all i want to do is keep my ADS sensitivity and how it behaves right now but when i go back to hip fire its too sensitive i want it equal to my ADS what should i do? my ADS is 50 my vertical and horiztonal is 50
---
i didnt edit my 0.02 stupidfactorX yet

This is great work!

Where people rotate at a moderate distance from  objectives, on the side of the doorway which is obstructed to vision when a dude RUNS TOWARDS IT, not when he looks around the corner, and at varying heights. Entrances to objectives are always checked, so don't bother with those.

I get 2-3 trips per round on average following these rules, and 4-5 trips are really frequent.

Mira looks weird rn

Why did they have to make her tan, and more dudeish
---
You can get moot for chosen teammates or something like that. They are way less toxic
---
I bought the game a while ago and I got none of the operators so I has to play recruit for ages. Attachments are free though
---
xD
---
Have you started using coloured acrylic instead of paint? I have been watching your career with great interest..
---
Just like CS, people have locally different callouts.
---
But it's easier to learn those if you learn the basic callouts, and adapt them to what your crew calls them, rather than not having a foundation to learn from.

As someone just an inch taller than mozzie, I feel his pain

Personally I like the black/white more. You do you though, keep up the good work.

The sub hates him because George trashes the sub calls it out for ruining the game with shitty suggestions like buffing shields

Yep, youre all alone.

ying is 160 mozzie is 162

No offense but offering up Frost and Cavira are bad choices...

I agree with Lesion, Mira, Echo and Vigil in this order however.

I can't decide if i like the coloured or non coloured! Awesome job! You defo do some more!

I restarted my Console and it is working now.

This game's netcode and hitreg is total shit. I see so much questionable and ridiculous nonsense on a minute-to-minute basis. I don't know why I care anymore, I simply don't know why I'm playing this game.
---
I gotta compliment your Hangul again, it‚Äôs well done! The coloring is also very nice, good job
---
So when is this exactly available?
---
Same... oof
---
Operation health 
---
Normally the shields function is to go in first and assault, because they have the shield which will guard them, but I also think they are too strong, so I would say, that a reduction would be the way to go.
---
For example you get a 20% damage reduction or just getting downed when the shield hits you
---
Hostage is like never played to much. I am shocked they still have it in the game. 
---
Prof: *show me your project*
---
me:
---
Thanks for the response! I have tried it as well and it didn‚Äôt help. I also tried resetting my router and everything. I can connect to other games, just not R6S.

Its nice and all and sorry... but that yellow kinda gives me headache.
---
Hahaha true. I just saw your comment on another post shit talking george, thought it was funny
---
*huh i wonder where i put those damn legs*
---
Fuze his ability isn‚Äôt that good but I love the ak12 
---
I dont like how rook and docs icon are in different places
---
Why does it matter that it's a drawing?
---
I give up. Clearly we are in disagreement and too stubborn to even understand each other.
---
Not what you meant but exactly what you said. I never said its not fun, but it is slightly toxic. OP even admitted it. We talked about it. It's fine to do these things sometimes. But it is under the umbrella of toxic.
---
You are right, but idk if you should be able to vault windows safely.
---
The sheer amount of desync is ridiculous tho. 
---
Checked Twitter and down detector also contacted Ubisoft support. No signs for the servers being down. 
---
wow this is so much better than the other one without color
---
&gt; Clearly we are in disagreement and too stubborn to even understand each other.
---
You're just not actually bothering to read though. That's the problem.
---
Pass those plates around.
---
They should add that sprint mechanic to all other shield ops, not remove it from Blitz. 
---
Look on uplay. Thats where the game will be on sale
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
r/itswooooshwithouttheH
---
It's because they are removing the Starter Ed. and dropping standard down in price permanently. As a result the base ops reset to the .5/1/1.5/2k system that it had on launch. All current starter ed owners are changed to this system.
---
&gt; This is about making the whole system a bit more stable
---
which it already is proving you've actually played a decent amount of games
---
At the start of Y3 they made standard edition unlock all base ops while not touching starter.
---
You better find em bro I believe in you
---
I tend to play with and against high level plays/diamonds. Everyone with mnk up there just runs around with 3 speeds trying to frag out while abusing every thing I can to get a kill. 
---
Well, at least they intend to fix that shield desync next season that Rogue-9 mentioned. :)
---

Nice work man. I could never draw something this could

Not really, I always used acog, and I tried the holo and for me it was even better then the acog

Wait, really???

Well, I play buck because of black ice on C8-SFW and I play valk bc her smg is so fun and good sounding
---
Lol this was great
---
Anne consistently pulls ~ 2.5 - 3k viewers whilst streaming the game (making her one of the biggest Siege streamers in general), so I don't think that's the case.

thanks!

Hehe I probably would have left it too

thankss!

Can you elaborate on why you think she's annoying?

Try a reflex sight with a vertical grip and flash hider. Drag down while shooting and shoot in controlled bursts. It works like a dream
---
Blitz. It's in his name. He's meant to rush. Hence his kit. Being able to flash get in fast and do damage. Monte's full operator name legit translates to mountain. Hard to move. Large and strong. He's meant to slow push.
---
yay!
---
id smash that
---
Thx
---
I'm not sure I understand. I need something to convert from and to. If I change the FOV to 74 the input doesn't change at all since I'm working with solely 360 distance in this case.
---
If I convert from his sensitivity to 800 it will change of course, but since he wasn't altering his DPI, it didn't matter what the DPI I inputed actually was (400 in this case), all that mattered was that the input/output DPI was equal.
---
The calculator is "[Mouse-sensitivity.com](https://Mouse-sensitivity.com)", for Siege you need to pay for the subscription.

I have a 2.0 KD with thermite. Supporters can absolutely frag.

Unplanned maintenace or an update maybe?

This happens to me with glaz a lot
---
In not sure you even play the game, her tits are like 100x smaller in game, whe tf do people draw over er rsexualised fan art.
---
i mean look at the phone. i dont even try on that one lol
---
Well yes but actually no. I just realized it since you comment
---
I think the drawing was amazing effort and looks cool but I‚Äôm also disgusted about the sexualization of siege operators. 
---
And with all the changes i mentioned Blitz will still be the strongest rusher and Monty will still be best at slow pushes. 
---
And G2 and Empire thought they would hold the "longest game" record forever after map 1. Little did they know /u/CenterOfaMiniWheat wanted otherwise
---
Play valkyrie, mira or smoke, they are all very strong operators.

Did you read anything I said. Obviously not.

I'm on EU servers ps4 but I also can't connect

Yeah but why are the old ones so.....mythological?

Why did I get 32 downvotes? I dont have a smurf acc lol.

Echo is very strong  if you play bomb, lesion is also strong

I like what you did with the color. She looks more ‚Äúcute‚Äù I think it gud  üëå

Let me guess you just fucking started and that recruit was afk outside so Mira rushed him and now your saying console is shit?

If I want exactly do I have to change my ingame sens to 4 or just my multiplier from game settings file?

Flashbacks to everyone rushing to pick Oddjob in Goldeneye

I want to play mozzie just because of the short ness

It‚Äôs cause lesion wears a helmet

i fuckin love it, hilarious and amazing at the same time. also, wow that was quick! youre amazing

Listen you a lame ass nigga for running a bullying subreddit

Thanks for the laugh, really needed it.
---
That sound pretty cool with all of them especially cause mute and thatcher are my main mans
---
Comic sans recruit
---
For roamers, Cav, J√§ger, Alibi, and Vigil are all great options
---
For anchors, Maestro, Echo, Mira, Mute(he can also be used to roam) and Valk(she can also be used to roam) are good options.
---
There are. Just because you own a expensive laptop and play with M&amp;K doesn‚Äôt mean that console players are bad. There‚Äôs a YouTube channel named Tactical Chaos gaming, they play on console and they have a M&amp;K episode on their channel. If that doesn‚Äôt convince you I don‚Äôt know what will.
---
Add more Americans there‚Äôs not even 10 of them
---
If youre bad at maths, what is the best way to improve? Using just a calculator? or figuring it out your self in your head? 
---
dope! i‚Äôll be sure to add ya when i get home
---
The logic is pretty straight forward. You need adversity to improve, but if your compitition doesnt know what its doing you qont need to know what you are doing. Creating a cycle of bad players. Throw in some actual challenge and if someone wants to win against it they must improve.
---
Plus the tutorials let you buy one for free in one minute
---
I had an idea regarding making Glaz capable of OHK's (well, DBNO's at least) to the body:
---
It involves giving his gun a DoT effect (so let's say he does 80dmg+6*5dmg over 5 seconds)
---
This way he can down people in one shot, but there's still a measure of counterplay involved, if you get hit by Glaz you can some times retreat to a safe position before going dbno.
---
The DoT could also make him deal more damage to arms/legs to punish people who aren't properly in cover. 
---
darn tooting we do ! Matimi0 is so positive and engaging with his community and plays with them everyday , this man needs a charm ASAP

Sounds alright.  I'd rather just have the 140 damage, but that works, too.  Anything that makes him a sniper is good

Yes. At the beginning you have a drone/electronic jammer and now you have a spiderdrone that can attack other drones to look through 
---
What happened to doc

You can still lurk at least. Shotty is still pretty good

God, no one has time to watch every single PL game while maintaining a life. I can just go watch a video of these glitches occurring without having to sit their and watch the livestream. I understand the complexity of the game but their are simple fixes that they don‚Äôt fix fast enough. Like the shield syncing problem we‚Äôre currently having. What I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs getting to the point that Ubi should see a bug and start looking for a solution and release a patch. It‚Äôs been years and it seems that simple problems are still relevant
---
Does that really matter?
---
Its not about realism but about having fun.
---
To be fair, the other changes are way more important
---
owo what's this!!!
---
T H I C C
---
No, I only play with players who are smart and mature, not those who call me ‚Äòscrub‚Äô and tell me to ‚Äòget good‚Äô. Unless your being sarcastic and there‚Äôs a intellectual side to you than No.
---
This is what‚Äôs wrong with the community 
---
No lag
---
I have the same problem since two weeks but no solution. did u fix the problem? i tried everything i found here  on reddit or other threads. I also opened a ticket but till now no reply. Every other ingame voice chat, discord and teamspeak are working without a problem doent make sence to me. i am pleased for every idea.
---
Pretty sure some dumbass at Ubi thought they were American servers. Probably flipped it right side up, right side up servers don‚Äôt work on that part of the world.
---
Nice. 
---
The game use to be realistic it stopped after op health 
---
Stop u don‚Äôt kno when I play on my Smurf‚Äôs and think cause I‚Äôm  copper I‚Äôm trash and try to run out oorush me
---
*"Fidget Spinner"*
---
Thats not what I asked, I asked if its important.
---
Thicc
---
what if i have 50/50 and ADS is 25 my preferred new setting 
---
how do i make my hipfire equal to ads?
---
whats the setting would be? 30/30 ADS 41?
---
Glaz's old icon was epic. Smoke's is the only one even close. Who put Medusa as Blitz's? SO weird. 
---
I would prefer to play in M&amp;K but I can only afford a console. The console community isn‚Äôt bad, but much less tactical and I can see that. I wish siege was less rumours and spawn peeking, and more tactical gameplay and teamwork. The plat console community aren‚Äôt bad, but I can see why you would think so.
---
Why does all the cool shit on this subj happen on console? I want to see the chat so bad. 
---
Britain wouls be proud
---
Yes I was just now checking my game files to see if that was my problem because right now it says the server status is fine.
---
I‚Äôm impressed with that potato, you missed around 20 bullets. Might wanna change ops since you can‚Äôt seem to use glazes DMR
---
Name a streamer that doesn‚Äôt want to have more subscribers on twitch. 
---
I think they‚Äôll change this if they find that Mozzie is performing too well. Tbh it‚Äôs not too big of an issue seeing as how its an intel gadget that is already balanced to a certain degree, but hiding it in electrified barbed wire could be a sneaky start to remember
---
Let me out  
---
LET ME OUUUUUTT!!
---
They used the same song in Watchmen ‚Äî it‚Äôs a Phillip Glass composition from the film Koyaanisqatsi.
---
he is doing the peek a boo
---
Thanks but it says the invite expired.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
*Kowalski, analysis!*
---
I'm not the actual person in the point of view in the picture. I was on the other team. This guy just demolished the hostage as soon as the round started and then the next round he ran over to the window and shot the hostage through the wall then got kicked from the game. 
---
He must have a thing against hostages.
---
I'm not 100% sure where to post this or even if this is known or unknown. But last night playing this map I noticed this exploit.
---
Using the map I made (sorry I'm shit at all things art/paint) if you are standing at the Red x not ADSing you can see though some of the train cabins (yellow circle). If you ADS it goes back to normal tho. 
---
Problems still persist. Got connection issues all day.  Saved games are not synchronizing and sometimes i get stuck in the first loading screen.
---
Whats the discord

Next Tuesday so I am pretty sure March 5 or the week after.  Correct me if I am wrong.

hes now a 1 speed 3 armor

i think it is tuesday, but thats just what my dog told me

How am i supposed to know. Some people dont want more, but they come, some people dont want all the fame but sometimes they will get it. It's not just about getting subscribers.

This is the face of god.

I have no problem with it. If anything, I love it. The fairly close quarters make shotgun rushing really fun, but the hallways leave room for ARs to shine. The top site can be annoying, but the little balcony you get to by repelling is usually the least guarded entrance and I Yeet myself through there most times

where's the map u made?

March 5th I think 
---
I was kicked after that btw
---
It's not for my benefit. It's for the 14/15 y/o black kid playing, or the gay kid playing, or the women playing. It's not okay to harass people verbally like this.

You're part of the problem if you have this attitude.

Oh nice

oh...that‚Äôs umm....innovative...

It‚Äôs glaz things

Your comments make you sound like a real asshole man, good luck to you.

He said that it came out when I stopped asking in a pretty snotty way
---
I really want an op with the F2000. Not Gridlock‚Äôs F90, I want the fish gun in all its glory, and a Belgian op would be perfect as I believe FN are a Belgian firearm company and provide the Belgian military with a lot of infantry weaponry

---
I just see it as some times you gotta have more brain over aim if you know the other team had a blackbeard use cams find out where he is and flank him I know its easyer said than done but still 
---
Wow. Nuff said
---
Well, I did read your conversation here and I must say it's not all. Afks and trolls are common thing in this game and more times than less they will cause the game will be lost. Same with smurfs as enemies. While if you will win the game, your rank will go highet, as your rank will go higher, you will play with and against better people, that are in these higher ranks. I think I am in lower rank than I should, yet I believe in words "if you can't 1v5 each round, maybe you do not deserve to rank up", so I do not cry about the lost becuase of afker or troll in my team. But if I can beat enemies on my rank 1v5, then probably I'm better, I will rank up and play against better players. While if there will be smurf in the enemy team, it won't look like that, because if I lose to a smurf, how can I say if I deserve a silver instead of bronze if I am forced to play against smurfing plat that is beyond my actual skills? Still, I am the one that do not have a problem with smurfs, but wanted to point it all out, because there are allways two sides of a medal.

Man I really wish I had a black ice skin, almost 300 hours in and no black ice ;(

Dont post any expoits here, always send to r6fix my dude, I know it's deleted but just saying for future ref lol 
---
So I guess he‚Äôs really shit at rainbow
---
Do you have an .svg form of this? I'd like to scale it to 1440p as a wallpaper.
---
No, they're rehauling the discounts completely into a tiering system. Y1 ops will be 10k, Y2 15k, and Y3 20k. 
---
Ok? Whats your point
---
This is how the base game is now which is how it was back in year 1 and 2
---
Disgusting...... I love it.
---
You're doing great keep it up!
---
r/THE_PACK icons
---
Oooookay? Any reason why?
---
Prepare 2nd controller!
---
I really like it, keep up the good work
---
It got canceled
---
if you are new the game, the grind is hard, esp without renow boosters. The season pass is worth it to me since i can play as often to grind. Take that into consideration, also there a few bonuses like renow boost/600 credits to spend towards whatever. but everything else you get for free. really depends on you and how much you play 
---
Prove it
---
Different units in different countries have different requirements - for example,  the SAS have no height requirements and e.g. a 5'3" gurkha could join them
---
Why wouldn't it? At the moment it isn't practical because of its weight. 
---
Cool ‚â† necessary.
---
Why
---
I've yet to read Mozzie's lore (console player), but how would being short be a detriment? I may be bias, b/c I love being short, and Mozzie might hate it.
---
To those who think spawn peeking is not fair: Don't expect to walk up to the mission location and not get shot at. "We know you guys are outside but we won't shoot at you until you are inside"
---
This is like arguing with someone that thinks lion needs a buff.
---
I've googled it once and it said March 13th but I think this information is wrong
---
What do you mean? He literally Streams every night on twitch. I'm not trying to be hostile or anything I'm just confused as to why you say he never streams.
---
That‚Äôs next season. Plus I can‚Äôt stand ranked solo queue. I play with friends more than often, we like to keep our ranks the same.
---
Reason for what
---
Just ran into him and one of his alts, VyncentWCopper4. They're still not banned. 
---
Who did you kill before BB?
---
Why lion is overrated 
---
Do you guys say the "g" in hitreg like in "game" or like "giant"
---
For pineapple on pizza.
---
*has black ice for every texture in the game
---
You can check it in ubi stats I think, it isn‚Äôt accurate though because the counter resets every season, I‚Äôm 99% sure unless they fixed it since I got it.
---
I would probably try playing with kill markers and floating friendly icons turned off in normal ranked but the hud options are so limited. You cant even turn off camera controls.
---
I think this game definitely needs a tac realism mode.
---
No ones claiming Apex invented ping. They‚Äôre just using it as an example for how they‚Äôve incorporated and improved on it.
---
Not cool man. NOT COOL.
---
...I need a life-size print of this now, you beautiful bastard. :P
---
Black parrot
---
Apex‚Äôs system is insanely in depth. For example, the character Bloodhound can see enemies footsteps from 30 seconds ago as it‚Äôs passive. They can ping those footsteps and tell everyone. This works for chests (open and closed), doors, care packages, attachments, enemy gadgets, and pretty much anything in the game besides terrain. You can also hold the ping button down to bring up a wheel menu to say where you plan to defend, where you‚Äôre looting, where you see enemies, etc. There‚Äôs a lot to it. So while Respawn didn‚Äôt invent the idea, they expanded on it to a crazy level.
---
Nice copypasta, but what did the original comment say?
---
Except it didn‚Äôt.
---
https://plays.tv/video/5a77808e9322ab4d66/um-what-?from=user yep, happened to me before

Nothing new bro...

His nitro is the nitro that will blow up the heavens?
---
Very good. Looks a little bit younger than the in game elite (to me, this is my opinion)
---
Psycho Mantis?
---
Has rinnegan
---
That when you plug in you m&amp;k directly into the PlayStation but if you use a device that hides it's or tricks the PlayStation in thinking you're playing with a controller.
---
No it didn‚Äôt lol just had a basic ping/mark items
---
Ah alright that's understandable.
---
Also, holy shit, it's you Epi! Just wanted to say thank you for all you've done for the Siege community. Hope to see you by the time we reach the 100 OPs mark.
---
I'll probably get downvoted for saying this but what platform do you play on? I'm guessing PC?
---
90% of these videos where people are clueless to their surroundings are on console. Console players aim with controllers, and on top of that, a lot of console players don't use headsets so they can't hear when people are flanking.
---
Lower your sensitivity brother you ain't gonna land those hit with the current one 
---
Dead horse
---
New liquid nitrogen op that freezes the floor confirmed /s
---
I‚Äôd say the normal use of tryhard should be positive but the way at least me and my friend use it is for a negative annotation because we use it for people who are kill hungry, spawn peek, yell at people for what they did wrong in casual, and worry about KD rather than anything else
---
Outstanding move
---
everyone say it out loud with me
---
THHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
---
I‚Äôm thinking thermite and doc, instead of healing you make them implode into a fiery mess 
---
I've got this glitch before and I also hear gunshots (for example) from the wrong ear in my headphones when I get the glitch
---
Imagine our lord coming around the corner screaming ‚Äúno running in the halls bruv‚Äù
---
So within the context of r6, you could ping a soft wall and it'll say "give me a breaching charge!" on attack or "barricade that wall" on defense? 
---
If somebody walks into my kapkan traps Im happy if my teamates finish them off, the only reason i care is if its a casual ace or a cav interagation, that pisses me off
---
Yeah but for what exactly? There isn't a lot of stuff to be pinged specifically here. Only things I can think off are reinforce and blow up. Maybe rook plates but that is only 1 operator 
---
You're gonna talk about dead horses on this subreddit?!
---
Zofia, mav, and fuze. All hard counters to maestro. Wtf did I just watch 
---
No? Maybe I should, but I use the default
---
Yes, you can only break it by shooting into the open shutter
---
Nice ;) I cant believe they didnt snuff you out hiding in laundry room like that....such a popular spot
---
No you‚Äôre toxic... jk well done
---
Wouldn't consider myself a Thatcher main but I have nearly 90 hours more play time with him that anyone else.
---
Verify game files?
---
you're that ninja!
---
This.
---
Pinging with context
---
Approved 
---
I can relate so much 
---
Almost definitely not casual. 7 rounds minimum (casual normally has 5 rounds excluding draws which are rare)
---
Yes please
---
Can I get this on a canvas please haha. Amazing!! 
---
The annoying thing is we've been asking for this for fucking ***years***, but Ubisoft is now only considering it as a mechanism to stay relevant in the shadow of Apex Legend's popularity - literally so articles like this can appear and say "Rainbow Six Siege is trying to be like Apex Legends!"
---
Just fuck right off with this shit. I'm not about to look a gift Ubisoft in the mouth and turn down any improvements to the current ping system, but to say Apex Legends opened their eyes after they spent years ignoring the community's requests for improvements is just disingenuous. 
---
a really big FOOKIN' HOLE here
---
Kewl. Thanks!
---
Assists usually imply Fragger who isn't playing well or twitch/lesion player
---
So peek to just ping an enemy? And imagine drone can do the Apex ping, thats kinda op? (When you down and spam ping enemys movement) 
---
I think Hugh jackman can pull of thatcher if they ever made a movie with these guys. 
---
Wow! üòÇ
---
Tachanka and Cav.
---
I‚Äôm a bandit main on defense. I tend to just mag dump. I‚Äôm not very good
---
I hope they put it in the game
---
1. He doesn't play fortnite.
---
2. He loves r6 he just can't play it as much as his stream prefers other games.
---
3. He's a chill guy, and when you have a chill guy, you have chill fans.
---
4. How is this desperate??
---
That‚Äôs an awesome idea but they should give it their own twist because of Apex‚Äôs popularity a ton of other games are doing it so it‚Äôd be fun if R6 made it more unique compared to the others
---
Well, I actually do run into my handful of professionals and youtubers, but the thing is I accidentally teamkill them. Then I watch on stream with the VOD and I hear their annoyance and I die a bit on the inside, because I look up to most of them. (I‚ÄôM SORRY MARK)
---
This is what peak physical operator looks like, you might not like it but here it is.
---
Really late reply but frankly it‚Äôs fun to fuck with people and if I can get 4K sledgehammer rounds, and hide in plain sight it‚Äôs a welcomed break from the stress of plat+
---
I panic a lot, but my aim stays fairly consistent. One thing that helps is using semi-auto, cos then you don‚Äôt have to compensate for recoil as much. Play some Glaz ;)
---
What‚Äôs with that audio 
---
How dare you
---
Yeah basically and there is also a wheel where you can do other pings
---
I like how blackbeard turned to you like "Hol up"
---
That has no correlation to the joke at hand. You obviously have never heard satire in your life. 
---
No...I was told your the best 
---
YES! It's honestly confusing sometimes. What do you want? Reinforcement? See an enemy? Do you want me to look at the cat poster?
---
I guess definition of wrong place wrong time 
---
what did he say that made him lose so much karma? 
---
Thatcher and IQ
---
#BOTTIE SHIELD HEAA --- LEVEL TREEE
---
These people hate you but I love it please keep it up. So much fun doing this shit, I also don‚Äôt think were hindering the new players, they need to get used to the game and use their senses and learn from shit like this.
---
Ideally
---
That‚Äôs one of the reasons, but I use the .- because my primary name was taken. So my IGN is MaelStrom.- but nowadays i‚Äôm too lazy to change it and i‚Äôm attached to the name now. I might have to think about that though, i don‚Äôt want to be giving anyone any ideas. 
---
this could really be an elite for me...
---
I honestly thought you were just going to fall off the roof and die lol.
---
I'm not one of them.
---
Recruit is best operator so no judgement here
---
Will it flash like the emp or is it stealthy 
---
Easy
---
FOOKIN LAZOR SOIGHTS here
---
Junkie alert!
---
Imagine getting interrogated by the lord himself. I'd just give up.
---
Absolutely tapped. Nice one
---
I‚Äôd also combine sledge and nomad cuz why not hit a home run 
---
Plat 3..in NA at least, (unless you're 5 stacking) a lot of selfish, overly aggressive, and greedy "plays" are made which usually end up with thrown rounds. It's really hard to escape plat 3 MMR when you're not playing in a full squad because randoms play exactly, if not worse, as the defending team in the clip above. Obviously not everyone, but a large majority of the people I get placed with when I queue around plat 3 MMR are dumb.
---
How is this spam?
---
Yeah that would be a good use of it. Or if you see an enemy downed can ping them and it'll say "enemy here" automatically. Or a single click ping onto a dropped defuser will announce "enemy defuser here". Friendlies can respond by clicking on your ping and it gives the appropriate response of "OK" or "Thats Mine"
---
Refreshing high effort comment
---
Swiss Army Op.
---
Has a little bit of every op‚Äôs signature, except each one is barely useful.
---
Because salt.
---
Yeah I'll try this, thanks.
---
That scream Blackbeard let out when he got hit by that c4 lmao
---
I've been able to fix it by closing and reopening the game(I play on console btw)
---
Glad that there are games like Apex that innovates and pushes the industry forward :)
---
# This isnt even my final form.
---
I dont think ive had directional sound issues, but to me that could be worse than no sound haha
---
I solo qued to plat 2 and I have to say in plat 3 at least there is alot of carried, toxic, losers
---
I'd love something like this just for the operator voice lines alone. Some of them barely talk at all, and even then in pretty generic quips. This would be a great way to characterize them more.
---
It would be a massive pain in the ass for ubi to bring in all the voice actors again, but one can dream.
---
I‚Äôm offended by that last statement. Retract it or I copy strike :) 
---
strafing *should* negatively impact your recoil....so this looks like working as intended
---
Happened to me before. Looks like we‚Äôre raving tonight boys
---
Casual 100

*boing*
---
Resisting the urge to open an alpha pack is quote hard 
---
It just adds to it though? I don't see how it reduces it
---
Mozambique is a shotgun pistol in Apex
---
*Stares in static*
---
What do you expect UBI to do? They are not Blizzard, Epic or Respawn. They are UBI, it took them 3 years to fix dropped shotting. It took them 2.5 years just to let you pick your defending location before Operator, it took them 3 years just to add another playlist for beginners and spread out the ranks, etc ... Dude, they are called UBItrash for a reason. Give them another 3 years, remember they are French Canadians. 
---
Ok but took and Chanka on anti roam? This don‚Äôt add up
---
Atleast she took it well lol
---
Ctrl prone gang
---
Nah man that was a triple kill 
---
Really? I always assumed it was just that a name was taken. But I due subconsciously judge people who use it because I'm also conditioned towards them usually being tryhards.
---
I like
---
H√°t ha van / lesz kedved, akkor addolj be Uplayen üòÅ
---
It is kinda weird that the majority of Anti-Roam operators are Defenders. Dokkaebi and Jackal are the only Anti-Roamers which makes sense but I also feel like Lion would fit this role too.
---
No hate as you're on console but when you were shooting at Cav, my inner demons were breaking free.
---
Grinding for alpha packs and resisting the urge to open one is impossible 
---
didn't say you were?
---
This is really cool
---
People will stop learning the maps and how to properly communicate. 
---
Been Ctrl'ing prone for 20 years, not changing now.
---
There is no such thing 
---
Ye me two but I gadget q
---
What ever happened to montages like these? now we have funtages or funny moments which are getting pretty old.
---
Has black ice but for a 6 inch blade that never loses reception.
---
So that‚Äôs contextual pinging. It‚Äôs going through my head as, left 4 dead, but you actually control the ping so it‚Äôs useful. That would be nice to see or a fallout system of a sort.
---
I can see her face in my head.
---
It's harder when ur not a full squad and in discord, and if you don't have a mic, and if someone muted you
---
contextual pings are a thing since league of legends year two or something or since heroes of the storm came along. but whatever, we get finally contextual pings!
---
GET YOUR GODDAMN PLATES
---
Fuze and Twitch
---
Jager and Echo
---
Echo and Tachanka
---
Now I'm not a huge computer person and I read some other comments, so I'm guessing contextualized ping allows you to connect to other people around the same ping.
---
Said he plays IQ but refuses to use her ability 
---
It's not even that they are slow about creating new fixes. There's been fixes in the works for a long while now. Remember when they said that there was a lion fix "In the works"? Why not just show us what they have and stop being so secretive. Keep the test server fresh with the new changes that they think are going to be implemented and I would be completely fine with the way they are handling everything else. There's little to no communication aside from mid season Dev notes. 
---
Enemy coming from where you ping
---
I've 12 but not one good :( maybe only twich f2
---
This is golden
---
the general ping will be replaced by more diverse ping options e.g. enemy spotted, somethings fishy etc.
---
God PLEASE
---
"every" fps needs this
---
Yep.
---
He desperately needs one.
---
2 speed, throw away his shield. Kaboom!
---
Ubi count on these free console smurfs for '50 million players'. 
---
No problem! Oh watch pro league too. You‚Äôll learn tons of nutty angles and tricks 
---
They should just add custom button mapping to controllers. Something i‚Äôve wanted for a long time. 
---
Thank the stars you aren't in ubisoft.
---
Lol rip time to uninstall 
---
I've been wanting something like this for years now because I remember how well it worked in portal 2
---
5th
---
Which should I get out of lion maestro and maverick because I don‚Äôt have any of those operators and looking to buy a new one 
---
That's why I said "After they are done boosting"
---
&gt; I just see it as some times you gotta have more brain over aim
---
easy to say, but when Blackbeard decides to stick his ugly face in one door or window out of many, the choice for Blackbeard is to shoot or not, whereas the opponent's choice is pointlessly shoot or just dont shoot because you are dead anyway. he is cheap operator and used by cheap players.
---
That last scale says 9 inches good job buddy
---
Lmao 
---
True I was thinking of getting as much as I can get in these last few days before going in for rank next season 
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/jolAEle   consistent*
---
I understand that it's a lot easier to do in League, but League has had these contextual pings since (AT LEAST) 2013, probably even earlier. It's good that Apex showed a way to do it in fast paced fps' though.

My first legendary was plasma pink
---

---
Lion+Thatcher = Storm: Disables traps map-wide.
---
Thermite+ Ying: Supernova: Hard-breach explosion causes a flashbang effect on the other side.
---
Twitch+Fuze: Martyr= Kamikaze drones
---
--------
---
Rook+Mute: Virus = Mobile mute jammer via vests
---
Rook+Vigil: Ghost = Vests that hides people from drones/cameras.
---
Pulse+Echo: Bloodhound = Cameras can switch to a secondary mode to see heart beats through walls.
---
Maestro+Tachanka: Sentry: Remote controlled machine gun/s
---
you Vigil main:) 
---
No I didn‚Äôt need sleep 
---
Fuze will never lose his shield because there are paid cosmetics for it (including the elite). Ubi would have to refund all of the players that bought skins for it. I think they should just give him frag grenades instead. He is Fuze after all.
---
This is adorable. 
---
My first was the rusted skin of doc and rook‚Äôs shotgun 
---
Lol
---
Average aim lol you must be a gold
---
ela's smg recoil patern http://imgur.com/gallery/jolAEle
---
I've never heard of this locker mode wth is that lol
---
So good, as always!
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve pinged something that needs reinforced and someone throws an impact at it
---
YES
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they began phasing out ACOGs on Ops who have a DMR as a second primary. For example, Twitch losing her ACOG for the F2. This would force a competitive decision to use either the 416 for long range or the F2 for medium range.
---
Here's an idea: #USE YOUR FUCKING MIC 
---
I can only see this hurting the community. If you have someone contextually pinging and you refuse to do the action they want I guarantee you're getting TK'd or kicked because people get but hurt over the smallest things in this game.
---
&gt;complaining about a charm then acting like he‚Äôd complain about them
---
Its casual
---
Bit iffy on the frag idea, I think flash bangs instead of smokes would be more balanced
---
That‚Äôs a great charm tho... so lucky 
---
I've had this happen as Dokkaebi with a Jaeger on Yacht too surprisingly. Not a fun experience T^T
---
The newest season typically launches on the first Tuesday of the month
---
This is on the TTS, with the breach charges already changed. And the highest possible spot for a maestro cam is always the same.
---
It‚Äôs probably the 4th like the previous operations 
---
The 416 needs a 20 round mag. Give it that and it'll see plenty of use
---
My boi
---
Trading smokes for flashbangs would amount to a nerf.
---
I‚Äôve known some people who boost and they usually don‚Äôt risk their rank solo Q‚Äôing. And this is probably just a low ranked alt account to boost his Plat 1 friend. 
---
That could be probable. My first thought went to Buck losing ACOG on his full auto rifle.
---
it's still based I think
---
I suck ASS with the evo 3a1
---
The way it works on Alex Legends is you hold the ping button and use the right joystick to get the desired command. So they could just do that for Siege
---
It depends on why
---
Oh neat. I've seen those stars, never realised that was his logo.
---
What are the abilities and guns or have you not thought about them?
---
YES. YES. YES. ##DO THIS RIGHT NOW.##
---
So, something that Dota 2 had for a long while
---
Common guess is the 4th
---
they‚Äôre probably just nervous as hell, give them a break
---
I leave it as Crtl...the only game I‚Äôve done that on
---
oh okay so it's in another language thanks 
---
Leave Tux's son alone!
---
You mean blessed
---
Excuse me how the fuck did you paint this??? This shit looks exactly like the short, which looks amazing! Good work OP, this is amazing
---
Hideo Kojima Rainbow Six Siege
---
No it doesn‚Äôt, there is still another person at the end of it. I‚Äôm not saying that swearing is bad but racial slurs are completely unacceptable in anything. 
---
Nice. This is call of duty
---
That's not a solid solution. There is a small demographic of people that don't get the opportunity to play with a squad so they avoid ranked, and I can understand where it would be annoying as I've been there before.
---
i really wish i could draw on canvas
---
thank you they need to get rid of the sprinks how did they even turn on
---
I didn‚Äôt imply he did mean anything bad by it. I was merely pointing out that it‚Äôs kinda funny considering getting them only requires playing. 
---
I love pinging in Apex but like what would you really need in Siege? Like the only time I could see ambiguity in the current ping is destroy vs reinforce. 
---
I can happily say it *may* be fixed in the TTS and Burnt Horizon release. Vaulting *anything* does a new animation where the first person view is on your head and isn‚Äôt just the smooth animation like how it is now. This might be the fix for it.
---
The best is when the entire other team doesn‚Äôt want to play objective and you can just waltz into the room 5 seconds after spawning and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh fuck‚Äù 
---
Points determine your xp and renown
---
Amazing art my dude but God damn that font/line/ placement kinda sucks üòÇ
---
WAH go play COD
---
Cool
---
No, no, no. You don‚Äô ‚Äúcancel that‚Äù. 
---
That guy thinks he‚Äôs funny?
---
Call dibs on Mozambique.
---
**And then leave it for the rest of the match.**
---
There is no solid answer. Ubisoft hasn't made an official announcement. But based on what information we do have it is expected next week. 5th or 6th.
---
march 5th
---
5 of March I think.
---
With exception of PB all seasons started in a Tuesday. 
---
Just salty cause you had a better game
---
I like this kind of stuff. Keep doing these. 
---
It is called Casual because that playlist is for people that want to casually play and have fun doing it. If you want punishment for leaving then play ranked.
---
You should be able to hold it and have a menu pop up, like a weapon wheel in gta
---
This is a competitive game. Having a thing that destroys playing off of audio is not a good thing.
---
thanks! ah yeah i trust wikipedia on the writing this time lol
---
I heard 12th from Varsity Gaming
---
Lmao ur just tryna show off ur black ice 
---
People play casua because they might have to leave.
---
Try hard = you're trying harder than me and succeeding, but I think I'm better even though I'm really not.
---
She is a variety streamer, but I would easily say Siege is her main game. Occasionally other games come along that capture her interest for a bit (like Apex rn), but it's far and away her most played.
---
Same with Bnans and Lexi. They're not as big as Annemunition is, but they have regular schedules and usually have viewership in the ~600 - 1000 range, which still puts them up there amongst Siege streamers with the largest audiences (and higher than a majority of the other creators that people say "deserve" it more), so I can see why they'd get one. And iirc Lexi at least used to play on the main stage way back in the day when they had streamers showcase new seasons, so in her case at least the history with Ubi is pretty long anyway.
---
Xp is worthless. If you want renown just do the weekly challenges 
---
ahaha
---
k
---
Tryharding is just something people complain about when they get outplayed or outsmarted. Instead of just accepting that they say you're a try hard which implies they aren't trying which is why they lost. 
---
March 5th, March 12th for non season pass 
---
It just seemed kinda like a rebuttal they way your comment was worded
---
How did you know
---
i 100%agree
---
When year 4 starts the new Price scaling will kick in. So operators will be prices based on how long they have been released. Year 1 Season 1 operators will be cheaper then they are now.
---
You need xp to play ranked
---
cheers mate! hope you like it!
---
Imagine having to pick the same operator on bomb every attack to have fun because of a meta operator
---
Crikey
---
thank you!
---
You can destroy almost anything. Reinforcements, wooden barriers, windows, evil eyes, traps, enemies.  
---
It's also honestly really nice to have a menu rendered in real time because occasionally my disk will have a hard time loading games in Siege, and it's really nice to be able to see when it's happening (characters won't appear in the menu) before trying to start a match and inconveniencing people with my infinite load time.
---
i was planning to draw them both, but im gonna take a quick rest from drawing R6 character rn,
---
To get to level 20, but after that it doesn‚Äôt matter 
---
Except the "back" button on PS4 is the Share button to save pics and video clips. : /
---
Yeah, It just bothers me when the game could be so much better.
---
Does he have a history of doing that ALL the time? No. Did he make a mistake? Yes. Should be be forgiven for this small infraction? Yes.
---
I'm getting sick of seeing the whole "apex has set the benchmark" with contextual pinging when there's been a fuck ton of games before that have had contextual pinging, why the actual fuck do people think this is a new thing that apex created???
---
Bad idea
---
Lots of people vote to kick at levels under 50
---
[here you go!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/av9wjo/dokkaebi_sketch_should_i_color_it/)
---
This would be good on all systems.  A more intuitive ping system would help out more for those without mics or are just shy.
---
Oof
---
Then don‚Äôt play casual
---
Why would it be called casual if you get penalized? 
---
Or melee spamming. I see that the most and it always freaks me out. 
---
thanks man. I really appreciate the support
---
You play the game and get renown and spend it on ops. It‚Äôs what I did it‚Äôs not so bad.
---
Can defenders shoot through this?
---
Actually it‚Äôs true, with the upcoming season they are lowering the cost of DLC oportators!
---
Gadget is actually 4 as well by default.
---
My friend got this glitch and he got the ops the next day 
---
Add more British!! SAS &gt; ALL
---
No I meant the R-97 as in Titanfall 2. A gun that was good at launch and then was buffed four times in a row.
---
To compare it to the R-99, the R-97 has a 40-round magazine (non-extended), a maximum hipfire cone of about 1.15 degrees, the same 1080rpm rate of fire, the same reload speed, and has a mod that allows it to be fired (with no spread penalty) while sprinting and/or jumping. It was eventually banned in competitive play. 
---
Part of castling doors is the choice between anchoring or roaming. They‚Äôre quick and easy to pull down either way though. 
---
That's not the idea but it's a possibility.
---
What‚Äôs in the canister?
---
I avoid "what-if" style questions. These require people to be way more knowledgeable about Siege than you would think. 
---
I ask about the current state of the game, not the past or potential future changes 
---
Anything involving changes are much better as normal text posts where people can elucidate opinions, whereas the simple opinions in this survey are better collected en masse 
---
No we don‚Äôt need blood orchid ela back that was a fucking nightmare 51 mag, no recoil, 36 dmg 4 mines, impact nades? Hell no we don‚Äôt need ash 2.0 on defense again. Yes her recoil is off the charts literally if you laugh out loud at the recoil chart but she‚Äôs fine the way she is. She actually require skill to use unlike some ops.
---
I agree to an extent, but this would allow for smoother movements. And that's what I was going for.
---
i remember they show a chart during the invitational that explained how older OP will be cheaper over time. unfortunately i cant find it...
---
Siege‚Äôs censoring chat is very stupid if you as me
---
Like... it‚Äôs rated M, therefore it‚Äôs for a mature audience. If you get offended over words, you are obviously not mature enough to play 
---
What
---
Yep. In fact, thanks to the communication allowed in Apex, the majority of times I‚Äôve won games is with 2 randos; only twice have I won with a friend, and those times we had a random third. 
---
Jackal footprint scanner someone's been here before.
---
&gt;I definitely would of team killed you the following round
---
And you arent toxic?

Hello Arcxgin, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/awb8w5/so_i_have_been_getting_this_issue_in_some_casual/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
* "Is anyone else having this issue" posts are also considered bug reports and should be posted to R6Fix
---
Oh damn, thats op as fuck. I played Titanfall 2 just never seriously, it was a game would pick from time to time casually. Never knew the exact goings on or if they even had a competitive scene. Never really left the spitfire really, loved that gun.
---
i'm not worthy of the black ice
---
It‚Äôll sting a lot. 
---
I don't see how it would be much different than the questions asking if people approve of the 3 and 4 minute timers. People had a chance to experience all those changes during the Road to SI playlist. You also ask "which maps should be in ranked". These are all closely related. 
---
"Did you approve of the ability to ban operators during Road to SI?"
---
The format is the same.
---
Why they didn‚Äôt push from both sides at once is beyond me. 
---

What is contextual ping?
---
lol I love this.
---
Tho one question, why is Hibana and BB's flags seem to be taped over?
---
Eh, I'd say Ela's dumber than IQ.  At least IQ *tries* to be quiet at some points, Ela's basically screaming the entire time lol
---
Looks like lack of communication to me. 
---
And less than 2 hours played
---
what‚Äôs your sensitivity bro?
---
Yeah i tried to find it too...no luck
---
Every single time I go to throw my drone out I ping by accident 
---
That's like telling people to revert back to hunting to get their food instead of going to a market. Like yeah, it's a challenge that people had to do before supermarkets and currency, but... you get the point.
---
YES!!! Thank you!
---
but the food we had back then was better for us then the food we get now
