They said it's an engine limitation.
---
---
---
Wait do hackers ddos the server or do they ddos you internet because I’m pretty sure the only way someone can ddos you is if they get you’re ip.
---
Like when a steak is not where it is supposed to be.
---
&lt;insert surprised pikachu face&gt;
---
That’s what it’s been for 2 years😅
---
BTW, you forgot the text chat spam on PC lagging the game for all players depsite Ubisoft and this very subreddit not even acknowledging the issue.
---
At first I didn’t even realize this was a cosplay. This is really good
---
Eh, I think that the seasional skins for the last few seasons have been garbage compared to some of the stuff around 3-4 seasons back. But yeah, you're prabably right. Diamond does show some kind of status (sometimes) tho, which is the second aspect avout skins (one being looks and the other status).
---
Oh look it's Siege o'clock! 
---
*Boots up*
---
&gt; And obviously the artists that makes skins don't code, they are artists for a reason xD.
---

---
Ubi allocates more resources to this division that could be used to help improve the game. Even with such a division, they could add more devs or pressure the existing ones to fix the code faster. If it were a bigger issue, they'd deal with it- at the end of the day people like you don't understand that they just see these games as a cash cow, and they milk children/whales for all they're worth.
---
*I gently open the door...*
---
Cant because there are Official 3rd party controllers, Accessibility controllers, other device external usb devices, native K&amp;M compatible games and elite controllers etc... 
---
Only thing the devs of a game can do is disable native K&amp;M support which r6s had disabled since forever.
---
Its annoying as fuck but its not a easy thing to fix. All competitive shooting games has this issue on console. Epic tried to fix the problem and they banned a bunch of normal players with elite controllers and the adapter companies had a workaround fix within 24hs.
---
They hit the server.  They’re not hitting the players.
---
Honestly though, Lesion is who I always ban. I know he's relatively easy to play against but I'd much rather play against Echo who IS easy to play against, with or without IQ.
---
Monty mains where you at?
---
YeH I’m on Xbox and solo q to plat 2 every season. I used to be able to get diamond and plat 1 consistently; but now I’d say 9/10 players plat2 and higher are using it because they love showing off they’re perfect recoil control and isnta 180 headshots. Not to mention the same losers who copper 4 boost. I don’t think I’ve played more than a half dozen legitimate no bs ranked games in the last 2 years. I get my plat 2 every season and then stop giving a fuck
---
Why does Recruit have massive hands
---
Every player on the other team are in silver though?

Who gets dibs on posting this tomorrow?

No u
---
They didnt take a weak position on it, its really hard to prove that the user is a k&amp;m user. 
---
Yes sometimes its really visible but other times there are really good elite controller users that has high sens that can aim good.
---
Ok that makes sense
---
Unfortunately doesnt work. 
---
They arnt attacking you as an individual, but rather everyone in the server simultaneously. 
---
Theres nothing you can do to prevent it, and it affects everyone. 
---
Theres currently 3 types
---
Server stressing - what the OP has experienced
---
Server crashes - kicks everyone back to main menu, potentially with an abandon sanction and loss for the non exploiting team
---
Personal DDoS - rare, and done through PMs etc
---
Does it even matter if a male or female cosplay as dokkaebi? As long as the cosplay looks good that's all that matters lmao
---
I'd trust her
---
Good replacement for the soup can
---
If it was just a single game it happens on could blame the game, but if it's happening on different games as well, it has to be the console that's causing it
---
Good luck guys! And I’m sorry that people suck. I love this game and want to see it thrive.
---
Truly one of the best AA weapons the north has along with the RPG and Dishka. Dishka is kinda awkward to aim, but it hits like a truck when you land the shots.
---
IMO I can see it from the angle of "you're playing professional soldiers who dont allow such conduct and behavior on the field"
---
Seems accurate hehe
---
It’s Kevin
---
Rank? 
---
Last season it prevented me getting Diamond as it happened near 20 times. 
---
Already had it happen 5 times this season, but luckily got my Diamond
---
I think its just the &lt; part because i think u saw somewhere that if spammed enough it would crash everyones game
---
they aren't hitting people offline but attacking the server.
---
that's like saying that food critics can't say anything negative about someone's cooking because they can't cook themselves.
---
NOW THIS, IS EPIC!
---
Oh yes it's very technical, in fact that's the term Six used when he told me about this bug
---
A proper facelift for Ranked.
---
I understand that this is a serious topic but I believe they can very easily fix the cheating. Games such as Fortnite have keyboard and mouse support (on xbox) so that you don’t need an adapter, but if it detects a keyboard it will put you on pc servers so everyone has a fair playing ground. If siege could do this it would be the end of people playing with adapters.
---
Friend of mine brought it in the morning and got the skins in the night. 
---
Give it some time, its probably take some time to process the payment or some shit.
---
You were probably being very toxic very consistently with a response like that.
---
Calculated
---
Yeh when the servers die on match point with 1 person left alive repeatedly - its more than suspect. 
---
Especially server stressers who will stress the server the exact moment their plant goes down
---
Thanks for the PSA
---
Wait I think I played this game if it was consulate
---
Damn those shaders lookin nice
---
yang gang 2020
---
Yeah that would nice to have, at this point I straight up only play casual because of all the M&amp;K players
---
Just tryna look out for my fellow PlayStation mates
---
Could be, but form my experience it doesn't change during a round, it's just between rounds that it changes. It doesn't change as often as it would have to if it was based on what's in front of you
---
Cav got taken in a match this past week though, don't remember who it was though
---
I was plat at the time idk their ranks
---
Tritium is like that sometimes
---
It may be annoying but it's very predictable and still fairly easy to shoot while concussed. I do think its duration should be slightly reduced though. The thing with Echo is his ability takes away a gun from the team and he has to hide in a corner that isn't easy to get to making it harder for him to clutch. Once he's dead, his main use is gone. Lesion's ability, however, still keeps a defender gun in play and doesn't require him hiding while also slowing down pushes (and stopping last minute pushes). He also has some of the same intel gathering potential if played correctly.
---
If his shield is capable of stopping even one bullet; which it is; the he’s blatantly overpowered and doesn’t belong in this game. Ubisoft I think learned they’re lesson and won’t be giving him any more significant buffs. He’s a crutch operator for people who can’t aim and don’t want to put any effort into the game.
---
Why would a player currently using a adapter to get a advantage over controller users so they can get higher ranks, purposefully put themself at a equal game and play with other K&amp;M players?
---
Epic still has a issue with K&amp;M players on the controller only gamemode.
---
The thing about video games is that the distances are all compressed. Real life combat takes place over hundreds of meters. The effective range of even relatively short ranged assault rifles is in the 400-500m area. But with some exceptions (arma, pubg, etc) you're almost never having combat outside of 75 or so meters in video games. It's just a practical thing - video game style tends to be more run and gun rather than trying to spot subtle movement at 400m, and TVs and monitors have limitations compared to real life in terms of seeing that distance.
---
So then, if a long range fight in a video game is like 75m, then proportionately it makes sense that if a rifle is effective at that long 75m range, then a shotgun is effective in more like a 10m range, to preserve their relative range and differentiate them as long range and short range weapons.
---
I can barely get to plat 3. They really should ban it, I’m sure the stats will show they have an absolute advantage against controllers.
---
Fortnite banned it
---
Why did this remind me of Christmas lights. Like how it moves.
---
Theres currently 3 types of attack
---
1 and 2 do not require IPs, plus theres plenty of videos on this issue i can happily show you when on my laptop later
---
That's strange. Bug, perhaps?
---
Once had a 19 kill game we lost
---
op
---
This just looks like Blackbeard with extra steps
---
This is definitely not the best we have on console lol
---
Need I remind everyone about Frosts shotgun with the introduction of Black Ice?
---
I’m perfectly fine avoiding that.
---
Windows 8 deserves that fate
---
If you want to take that stand that racism/sexism/homophobia is ok then you feel free but there is nothing wrong with a company deciding they are not ok with that stuff.

I don't know if his mouth is open or if he's sticking his tongue out....
---
Can't wait to see what exploit they unintentionally roll with this.
---
The DSHK is great so long as you aren’t getting teamkilled for its use lol
---
Yea there hasn’t been a game that both nails the realism and balance. Tarkov is an example of a game getting realism but not balance, call of duty is an example of balance but no realism. It’s a two part thing. Tarkov gets ONE part of that right.
---
Different types of roaming, Cav is a ambush try roaming op that feeds on teams with bad coms and bad droning. 
---
Vigil is a jager like operator where you roam and hold down a room with their really good guns as much as they can then rotate around using the impacts.
---
Why are you in public
---
the whole word filter thing has been crap from the start.
---
if people are so concerned about racial slurs then let them just disable chat on their end.
---
prior to the word filter update i think i saw 2 or 3 people at max that actually said a no-no word. It's a problem that never needed fixing.
---
GF has just been courting controversy with his recent videos. He used to be an instant click to watch with useful tips. Now it is just pointless clickbaity speculation stuff.
---
Lol how did you record this and play
---
In hindsight, two Yokais might have been sort of an overbuff. Especially when combined with bomb being the only pick-and-ban mode - two invisible cams with plant-cancel ability is massive.
---
I agree I think Kaid is an extremely strong defense op.
---
Yeah this is true.
---
Some of my friends cant really choose which Op they wanna buy and end up with a choice that they arent happy about.
---
TACHANKA 😂😂😂 BRUH IM DEAD 😂😂🔥😂

[Here you go](https://cdn.siege.gg/img/infographics/siegegg-s9-finals-infographic.png), siege.gg makes them
---
Aim way higher for a McNab throw
---
cool style
---
I saw one dude spike to 47k 
---
Never in my life have I see higher ping
---
Are you being serious? It's horrible, I was smoke, me and a rook shot each other same distance with the shotguns using ads and he did significantly less damage to me with 2 armor than I did to him with 3. Both aimed center mass.
---
Eventhough it seems to be more a console problem. I've encountered it several times on PC too
---
he was already pretty underwhelming before he lost his barbed wire, now there's basically no reason to pick him over bandit apart from getting hatches, and even then, bringing Thatcher, Twitch  or maverick takes away that usefulness. I'd say he should get a 3rd claw and/or the AUG gets an ACOG or some sort of buff since it's still pretty bad for an SMG
---
his shotgun is beefy as fuck tho, it's nice to use
---
K/D doesn’t mean shit in Siege bub
---
i did too haha
---
Name one online FPS game that doesnt have a hacking/cheating issue. 
---
Even CSGO, Which is a game thats been out for longer, Has a much larger pro scene and larger playerbase and market name still has a massive hacking issue. 
---
Its a much simpler game compared to r6s  yet it cant deal with simple spinbot without them wasting time on multiple matches. 
---
There is no single "effective" anticheat. As long as the game exist there will be hacks and larger waves of hacks everytime the hackers find a major issue. Everytime thats fixed theres a massive ban wave. Thats just how online games work.
---
thanks m8
---
Getting in someone's head is advantageous in a competitive environment,  is it not? It happens all the time in professional sports. People are sensitive because they are told to be sensitive. It shouldn't even be an issue.
---
Thanks for making the only good content on this sub.
---
The whole issue with this argument is a glock and a shotgun aren’t comparable. A glock is a free starting weapon. A better comparison would be comparing the AK to an UMP, p90 or...wtf...A SHOTGUN which counter strike as. Which one shot up close no matter the armor type but still are cheap and give massive returns on investment. The closest thing in Tarkov we have to the glock in counterstrike would be a cheap pm or grach pistol, but even those cost and are a investment. Also counterstrike pistols aside from a few bottom feeders can totally compete up close with an ak, many in skilled hands are used to knock out someone who already has an ak with a well placed headshot. The shotguns don’t fill that role because not only can shotguns not compete with late game weapons like csgo aks, they can’t compete with early game weapons like Tarkov hunters, ak74s and mp7s. Again. Bad argument but keep downvoting every comment while totally missing the point, it’s definitely making you seem more knowledgeable.
---
Seems I main the right people.
---
Hold ADS is better since its one less click to go from ads to hipfire.
---
As for getting out of Gold,my advice is this. As an attacker, plan out your attack strategy. How are you gonna push into the building. Which path are you gonna  take and where are you trying to go. Once you have a plan in mind, it makes things easier since you're not just wandering aimlessly for kills.
---
As a defender, play a 3 armor with Acog and hold tight long angles.
---
right but its only good for explosives.
---
pretty much
---
when you play cav with game sound off and a podcast playing instead lol
---
thank you
---
not sure what you mean by that but ok
---
smoke is S tier. castle is also really important at high level play though he does more harm than good in uncoordinated groups, so he can be lower.
---
Yeah right bud
---
Everyday i play this game with shotguns
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I actually appreciate the fact that CSGO has a fucking spray pattern for shotguns. At least its more consistent than somehow missing a hipfire shot at 3-5 metres with the M1014
---
Except the shotguns are different when I shoot them vs when other people shoot them.

Don’t be naughty.
---
Thanks! This is actually only my second drawing in this style!
---
Youre actually wrong. Shotguns in csgo do not 1 shot upclose regardless of armor. Only with several pellets hitting the head in one shot will a shotgun 1 shot up close if a player has armor+ helmet. and with just armor a shotgun cannot 1 shot to the armored areas. 
---
You took my external example of the differences between balance and parity and somehow still misunderstood it.
---
Aim so the Nitro sticks at the wall in front of you, then acidentally push the wrong button and blow yourself up.
---
Literally me, when im throwing Nitros.
---
I hope i could help
---
We have all been there sadly
---
You know whats fkin weird 
---
The fact that the Security forces in that game has access to flechette rounds. So that means a shit ton of court martial charges when they go back to base?
---
So Blackbeard but worse on defense?
---
Ok true
---
But shotguns do hit like a truck, right? Even if they did not penetrate armor.
---
didnt CSGO add a thing where top players can spectate a game and report a player for being a hacker. would be nice in siege

Yeah the cancer has spread and yet no one is talking about it and I’m shocked how widespread it is

Um where's the orange tip you can get killed

pls fix the Xbox Ddossing
---
Might you tell me then why they don't change their official ToS or Code of Cpnduct to adapt to this? What the social media team says is not law.
---
Lol 10/10
---
They changed? Never noticed. All drones get a bullet from me
---
Buff her scorpion and give her impact nades back and than we can talk about nerfing the F0-12.
---
I have a rather not cheap airsoft gun that has two detachable orange tips. One is screwed on and the other is some sort of plastic shroud.
---
Then what would be strategy in your opinion?
---
i’m getting reviewed for the same stuff, like “gg wp” or “this is hard” or whatever. super weird
---
What else could he have seen? My shield was down and I didn’t move lol
---
What's the discord?
---
And? Once again, it's the company making the call to censor that kind of speech, the philosophy probably being: "We don't like racist speech in our game in any capacity, so we're shutting it down."
---
I already commented some effective ways to work around him in this thread
---
Is there a general location that its for, is there a rationality for the call out?
---
1. All shotguns in csgo cannot 1 shot to the chest through armor, in fact the only one i think can is the sawn off at less than 600 units. Its possible to 1 shot someone in the helmet with a shotgun in csgo with a shotgun. Its also possible to use the mag7 to 1 shot someone by langing every single pellet in their legs in 1 shot. The same is true for shotguns in tarkov. so what is your point?
---
2. A shotgun being a buyable and viable early game weapon means that it is perfectly balanced for its roll. If it did well against armor and higher level geared opp then it would be overpowered because it would be excelling outside of its desired roll. 
---
3. Youre either willingly ignorant or a troll. Ill let anyone that comes across this see your foolishness. Get that ass parried.
---
But you're trying to say that you don't have to have it while not displaying it publicly... so... isn't that a bit counterproductive to actually refuting the point? They can't do anything on sight if they don't see it.

Huge distractions

they are PMCs dawg no rules baby

Because some people don’t want to use mnk they want to play on a CONSOLE and so they want to use a controller. This would force everyone to use mnk or just have no reason to play. If you want to use mnk use a pc
---
Siege has to be the buggiest game with a competitive scene. I'm genuinely surprised its made it this far.
---
Either it was a toxic 4 stack or they thought you were a trolling smurf as there are way too many right now. I would definitely give it some more time as toxic people are more rare than one might think. Also I wouldn't play in newcommer as I have heard there are a lot of smurfs.
---
Doorway Tachanka be ready

I think the second text is too complicated, I would rater use "Me blinded and out of ammo".

Hey, just wanted to let you know that '&amp;' also does it, and still does it.
---
Ubiquitous for the T95, Grim Tally for the Vector and Cold Sky for the 416C all don't deserve to be Legendary.
---
Africa, for example, can be a map on the wall, some animal skin (stereotypes 🤷), a painting...
---
When your shield is down you really can’t assume you are completely covered. Shields are unreliable asf nowadays and you could be facing the enemy on your screen and turned 90 degrees on there’s
---
Let there be light.
---
Attack: IQ, Thatcher, &amp; Sledge.
---
Defense: Ela, Doc, &amp; Mira.
---
So it's worse than Tachanka is now?

Someone needs to be introduced to Mr. Face Shield Fuck-Face

You already had RFF activated so shooting the drone reversed the damage onto you

Well yea I know that’s kind of my point in posting this. Still kinda funny
---
I highly doubt someone would buy an elite skin on a smurf account
---
I mean, with pick and ban, people just get rid of Echo and Lesion, making my IQ pick somewhat worthless.
---
I love her guns and character tho.
---
And what does having using a controller to do woth playing on a cobsole? Other input devices on a cobsole are as normal as on PC. You can get Steering Wheels and the likes too. During NES times already you were able to use a lightning gun.
---
You are sticking to an idea which does not exist. If you want to use a controller be my.guest. but some people want to use M+KB and still play on console for theur own reasons. You want people wanting to use M+KB to buy a PC but you yourself don't even want to buy a new input device? Double standards right here.
---
F8 secondary gadget? why?
---
Nice
---
After he tk’d me for breaking a wall😂😂

Oh yeah I was agreeing with you sorry if that wasn’t clear. I get those stupid shield glitches all the time

My expensive one had the orange painted on the tip

what

i see nothing here

That Clash pickrate lookin a little high I think
---
What platform are you?
---
Not what I said, if defenders are always blue, and attackers are always orange, it would be leagues easier.
---
Damn I thought Ubiquitous was cool, but the others I forgot about, Damask (the new Deagle skin I can't remember what it's called) seems more like a epic as opposed to a legendary
---
Praise the Lord!
---
It happens way more in other comments sections. I’m actually surprised it’s only one in this thread.
---
I think you have it flipped there my guy
---
It is not misinformation. You said yourself NATIVE M+KB is disabled. Which means any USB device you can buy. The Hori Tac Pro is a speciality M+KB controller licensed by Sony and works natively. No adapter needed and it works with the same technology as XIM.
---
I really want to get more comfortable w/ Alibi. She's so unique, and I wouldn't have imagined her being an operator when this game first came out. I just gotta convince myself to work with her more.
---
On a side note: to anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with other operators, just play exclusively random operators. My buddy and I have been doing it for the better part of two weeks, and it works out surprisingly well. I've discovered I really like Ela, and IQ's 552 Commando is surprisingly efficient with my play-style. I'd recommend it.

There are hacks for current gen consoles. CronusMax is 1 way, google can show you the rest

I used to play with ACOG, just because everybody told me to. They told me it was better for getting headshots, etc., etc. I tried to get used to it, but I just couldn’t. I switched to the holo, adjusted my sensitivity a bit, and now I play so much better. I agree with Pengu, the ACOG is a bit too slow for me, and as weird as it sounds, I am way more accurate at getting headshots with the holo. Again, it’s just personal preference.
---
At first I thought it was a wallpaper for voodoo lady. Loved the title btw
---
You are absolutely right but I just get too into the game and forget you know 😂 plus you won’t even have to worry about any of that with a wired controller 😉
---
Did you just drop shot him?
---
Boosted players who want to show off their fake rank.
---
Seriously. Why do people always jump to insults here? Every sibgle time. I have yet to meet a single person arguing against M+KB who won't insults. And I think it tells a lot that they can't argue this topic in a civil manner.
---
Ubisoft defines it. Yes. In their ToS and Code of Conduct you have to agree to before playing the game. But: Point me to the part in it where they say "The use of any input device despite the standard console controller is forbidden."
---
[redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] , [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] ? [redacted] [redacted] [redacted] !

So the art team should stop everything and do nothing while they wait for the other department to fix the bugs?

Trust, HW Ban is not "expensive" to get around. Literally 2 things needed before you can play again.

Oh okay thanks. I thought you were saying its not possible to hack on console lol.
---
1) Dont use the imovie preset trailer. It makes your edit look garbage even though im pretty sure you can edit pretty well.
---
2) Dont use Casual clips. If its just a regular two piece or 3 piece if its casual it just turns people off
---
3) Im looking forward toward your next video.
---
I walk it
---
Seems like a lot of ppl are having this issue so it might be a bug or something Ubisoft prolly needs to patch it out. That’s all I can come up with since it’s happening to so many ppl
---
You wont believe how many kids tell me mods are impossible on PS4/XB1
---
Ya console is pretty fucking toxic I won’t lie. People get a ban they just hop on their smurf it’s awful lol
---
Wtf did you do lol
---
I played hardcore exclusively up until bf1. Shotguns were incredibly fun because they were actually a viable option with buckshot. They had a clear advantage at close range but you were able to use them up to medium range too.
---
You're an idiot. "console peasant" is a common meme. You are the asshole claiming that PC is more expensive than console, when it clearly isn't.
---
What did u do

People who think that race and gender don’t affect bone structure*

Depends on the circumstance, I’d guess 80% of the people I’ve seen quit did it because of pride/ego, the ones that fail a spawn peek or rappel down in front of a jager that cool-aid maned out of a window .5ms prior

We’re talking about when it was gone

I know it’s a meme but you mean it. Damn you are a prick after all...

No. All these "streamers" need to be stopped. People should not become millionaires by playing sports or video games. Our police officers and teachers and firefighters, etc. Should not paid a bare minimum wage while these people playing games make millions.

By all means enjoy your games and enjoy watching people play them, but they should not be promoted like this and paid to play fucking games.

occasionally I get teamkilled for having an anime gamerpic on xbox, I blame it on their being more teenagers and middle schoolers on console

I have this question as well. Wonder if it has to do with average ELO between teams? 
---
I used to think it was confirmation bias until I tracked it. I'm at 89 games so far this season and have attacked on 78 of them - play with the same squad essentially every game.
---
I mean, you can change server so Eu players can play NA and the other way around. It’s annoying but you can’t stop language barriers clashing.
---
I’ve seen him teleport in videos

Bad fps drops happen still with the ampersand and @ symbol.
---
Damn, I only got started toward the end of grim sky, but rn I’m a level 101
---
Hahaha those i kinda understand, but ill talkin about the ones who wait till the round is over being a loss then dip out. Like why wait all that time then leave just stay at that point.
---
The real question is the suppressor?
---
rofl you have no idea what I mean. Go to /r/safespace if you get triggered over a simple comment.
---
Rofl. Right.
---
I was just talking about a funny line, we don’t need lore
---
Consistency and Siege are words that don't belong together, it's a hitscan game with trade kills ffs
---
Won the 4-4 like that? LoL
---
Change servers dumbasssssssss
---
For some reason this game me the inspiration to make a Nat Geo episode about Ash.
---
And here, we have an Ash in their natural habitat, inside the bomb site before the preparation phase has even begun. Ash is a common find in the matchmaking wilderness, which is a very scary predicament for anyone who she is not allied with. On top of an unpredictable battle plan and equally as unpredictable hitbox, Ashes have a trick up their sleeve: There's two types. Now, the fear from fighting an Ash as it invades your house at mach 10 on round one comes from one key question: Is this a Veteran Ash that has aimbot built into its nervous system, or is it simply a youngster who doesnt even know what a pistol is. The first type is the abomination of the lands that makes even the mutants from Outbreak cry in fear, while the second is simply comparable to a turtle on a treadmill; trying its best but getting nowhere. Tune in next time at Rainbow geographic where we will cover the elusive Tachanka, which many religions revere as a god.
---
Looks like he found them.

Im probably part of the group where filtering shouldnt matter unless you opt into it.
---
But i like to have people rage, because im the kind of person who continues to poke those kind of guys to make them angrier and throw off their game. Make their ego so big it pops.
---
No offense, but can I ask if you're a white male? I am. For us it's really easy to just say "lol don't be offended by words" when we're not constantly picked on to any extent.
---
Try to imagine for once how it must feel to be a black person online. When people get toxic they don't go spouting slurs against white people, they typically end up resorting to terrible slurs against black people and other minorities. I can't imagine how it must feel to _constantly_ have to deal with that level of toxicity.
---
It's easy to just pretend this isn't an issue but it really is, and heaven forbid you're a woman online. Sure, mute exists, and people online should probably build up a thick skin, but is it really such a bad thing for a company to want to reduce that kind of toxicity? Siege is hella toxic as is, I can't imagine what it'd be like without some level of censorship. 
---
People should probably be less sensitive, but again, that's easy to say when you're the least picked on demographic. 
---
I really cannot understand why people would be so against Ubi trying to moderate racism, which has absolutely no place in Siege.
---
I feel you’re looking at this like with an attackers advantage in mind, where it’s meant for defenders to line up their shots, or at least gain intel.
---
This is the thing people that defend this shit don't understand about keeping the game civil. If this was an actual court/ground and you talked like that you're gonna get fucked off and run out of the field.
---
The only difference is here the toxic people hide under anonymity.
---
I would imagine him ordering some poor recruit to print out each and every one of his emails for him to read.
---
Lol I’m not entirely sure about those ones, maybe fighting with team mates or last man standing whiffed a kill, who knows.
---
I would sooo team kill you for that!

Also “hibana main” oh god tk gold

If you had friends then this wouldnt happen
---
Is this real was it took today if so is it for everyone
---
But there’s no workshop for siege
---
Oh look this argument used by silver morons who think she'll become OP with a bit more controllable recoil and giving her the Impact grenades back. Go play Ela for yourself and tell me that her Scorpion is "fine".

Does your back hurt when you suck yourself off

Yes it is real, yes it was taken today, lastly, r/woooosh

Fucking dumbass I’m on the right servers I checked before posting

#WE NEED ANSWERS
---
"Switch" servers dumbassssssss
---
Pulling off an ace during a 1v5 clutch is like your heart but if it was deep fried and blurred so much that it would refer to as a deceased person
---
I wish gold and ps plus weren't shareable we wouldn't have a smurf issue this big on console, it would suck but not having to play against a smurf would be great
---
Not just reflex but reflex sight
---
I've noticed the killcams are glitched and I know they arent cheating cause I've seen the same thing for my friends cams, I get one like this at least once a game
---
That bomb, is gone.
---
Ok let me switch to the wrong servers
---
I understand and see the business point but as someone who has spoken with about 150 or so siege dev I cannot say they don't care, they actually know very well the without the community there wouldn't be a job on that project. There is so much bugs and things being worked on that you have no idea how complex and weird their operation is and even I have barely any. I just know that they love working on this project and they do work their ass off. And you can't fix a bug if you do not know how to reproduce it. They most probably have the work force to patch faster but that would mean delaying new seasons which is half (to my impression) of their growth methods that are super effective. We know what op health did to siege in terms of QOL and we most probably need 1 again and most probably lots of people agree but op health kill the game numbers for the months it lasted. It made the game without new content for about 6 months. They already taken steps to go halfway by slowing down the number of new map releases which allows some qa and buf finding to be done. On a game this size, it is more than normal that when its on lan or in a "small" online scale (less than 5-10k players so basically test settings internal) it has less bugs. Do not forget that we are over 45 million monthly user of that game... We do and search for dumb shirts xD bugs will always happen and ubi is aware of it but you should try to see that they started to take steps to help the state of the QOL of the game so it doesn't die.
---
The world may never know.
---
The right servers is the one where u dont get placdd with people like that dumbass
---
It's a deterrent for sure. If someone wants to hack there's no way to stop them, you can send the FBI to their house and they will still will find a way to hack.
---
But bans and all sorts of punishments are good to keep little John away from hacks.
---
this ia fucking disguating. f in the chat for his teM
---
And I suppose actors and musicians shouldn't be compensated for their work either? They're entertainers all the same. OP said nothing about "Hey Ubi, pay Pewdiepie to play R6!", he just said a person he (And like, 80% of the internet, mind you) likes to watch.

&gt;he game has been out for like, four years now, and yet such a basic and quite honestly crucial feature has yet to make its way into the game
---
hmmmmmm
---
&gt;there doesn't seem to be much discussion about this on the sub,
---
Bruh this shit comes up every 10mins, try searching the subs before you post.
---
That looks more like an iq cosplay😂😂
---
Unz unz unz unz
---
sounds like a great group of people! /s
---
If you're doing that in casual and messing around that's fine but don't fuck up people's ranked games.
---
IM SORRY MOZZIE
---
i mean they could’ve at least changed the weapon that the skin was for. thatcher has 3 weapons and they didn’t choose any of the others? lazy ubi at it again
---
Console manufacturers can't really do anything either. People use 3rd party adapters, those adapters list the device as a "3rd party controller". The overall solution then is to ban all 3rd party controllers, which obviously nobody wants to do as it'll hurt actual controller players.
---
They figured out one time how to detect these adapters as KBM (I believe for Fortnite), and they creator of the adapters just released a firmware update to counteract it within a few days. It's not possible.
---
Profanity is allowed in Seige. Even Thermite and Hibana say "A really big fucking hole coming right up"

It was casual we didn’t want to get banned

Rule X:Stop running unless your playing an aggressive frag role and operator.

Rule Z: Stop playing aggressive frag roles until you learn the map.

Yes you can I've gotten like 3 accounts banned lol
---
*as if it even matters*
---
She is African
---
No damage wtf
---
You may as well be a child making statements such as that.
---
Who makes these comics
---
you can still get banned in casual btw
---
A friend i know got banned and he only played casual (he didn't spam shit but got banned for using some bad words in chat when the chat filer was really harsh)
---
lol i got voted out for asking "does anyone have a mic?"
---
*lmao intensifies*
---
Only imperial stormtroopers could be so accurate
---
F
---
Oh geez we only did it once for shits and giggles but ok
---
Sorry your idea was bad man
---
I used to run jackal/frost mains and recently I’ve switched to buck and ela, I highly suggest trying buck if you haven’t already
---
SCP containment breach
---
You could get more karma if you posted this on r/shittyrainbow6
---
/r/expectedSCP
---
Same thing with the word jap (yup in german)
---
And what happens when some nerds only have a couple of maps on? Casual it would ruin the variety, and in ranked you should be good on all maps.
---
Does he do drugs👀
---
He talking about recent operators being too "unrealistic" in general. I'm gonna guess he's talking about nearly most of the post launch ops because most of them are "unrealistic". Yet shit like Thatcher's EMP grenade, Pulse's heartbeat censor, Doc's stim gun, and Twitch's shock drone are somehow "realistic".
---
The MNK is not the first problem currenlty, fix the ddos of you'r server please, 3 games, 2 ddos. I love this game
---
I mean it does say destroy on it
---
Cash doesn't just magically solve problems...
---
o i see. my account is still banned nonetheless, pointless to defend my point ;/
---
It’s not that it’s a bad idea, it’s that you don’t agree, there’s a different, man.
---
It does hire a bigger team of devs to devote to mouse and keyboard
---
Bullshit sci-fi in a swat game makes games boring. Stepping on invisible traps and getting killed by silent people is also boring.
---
It’s decent for frost
---
Yoo I used to live near matudo called wanagaya
---
That would be too unbalanced
---
Mans out here with p90 on semi auto
---
Have you met their son Mito or daughter Hypo?
---
You are a complete moron because you cannot understand the intel gathering potential both Jackal and Mozzie have. You are running out of things to blame for your incompetence.
---
That’s bullshit. Ubi better do something about this. They should know how sad it is to get perma banned in a game you love playing, for no reason.
---
Yeah exactly; like I've gotten plenty of fun out of the game at this point but you'd think my dedication to the game would have meant anything lol
---
welcome
---
See?? You get it!! I just won 2 more games!
---
Ubi tries to fix 1 bug, fail 100 times, implement 5 new bugs, exclude the bugged part of the game as hotfix, implement new bugs, tries to fix one bug.
---
Somewhen we have to realize ubisoft just as some mediocre devs...
---
lol I wouldn't be too surprised
---
why is &lt;&gt; causing an issue? you can XSS in the game or what?!
---
your face in the end was perfect lmao
---
What boy? I said up there that I'm not good enough so I have to hack so I can feel some sort of accomplishment when I get diamond!
---
We’ll see I guess
---
The stats don’t lie, jackal has one of the worst win rates of any operator. Mozzie will see the same when the data comes out.
---
Like with Captain America, computers are rather slow for him
---
I don't have cheat engine or an autoclicker app no. I dont really play single player games honestly.
---
Bro... Bro... BRO WHY U STILL PRONE? Wtf
---
I use to say Zofia is just better Ash but I actually like them both now, they both have their strengths. /u/HelloImKiwi already answered the rest.
---
While other shotguns being a confetti machine, FO-12 out here mowing the lawn casually  (O . O)
---
I know this is bad but I really do think you should have to have an id just to play m games because it's just kids that tk or vote kick or are generally toxic and dont hold back parent need to stop giving their kids these games because it just ruins it for everyone especially if they are squaded up. At least at the end of the day i still got a little rubber ducky and no 7 year old can take that little moment of happiness away from me.
---
I guess we say the same to those who use controller on pc?
---
@.... J
---
Fu
---
If you need a second opinion, Op, then yes, it is no longer in the packs.
---
Part of me likes this idea bc I hate Favela and Kamal, but at the end of the day, if I don't want to play those maps, I just quit. It might suck for my team until they get a 5th, but if they get tilted from someone quitting a map in casual they don't want to play, then that's their own issue they need to sort out
---
Thats not even the current chanka spawn peek strat
---
u/bikinibodhi is using the shield on the turrent as a budget blackbeard/mira window and peaking around it to spawn peek
---
Of course not, there's no advantage.
---
I’ve done the same thing. I love to spread wholesome &lt;3
---
Not just ranked. I was playing casual earlier today and got hit by a M&amp;K using cunt
---
I just got flagged for |||||
---
Honestly thought it was the game model
---
Gotta love easter eggs. Gotta hate why they exist.
---
Actually, I don't think Ubi could do anything really...Some MnK, like the Hori tac 4 for example, is straight up detected by the console as a controller, and my guess is if you plug it on a PC, it will act like a controller. There is like absolutely no way, unfortunately, to tell that it is indeed MnK and not controller.
---
U
---
Its true. Triple A company that struggles to prevent problems with one of their top grossing games.
---
I’m fortunate that I haven’t come across these kinds of people but that’s probably because I’m still in gold. I’m getting awfully close to Plat though so I pray to god that if I have the chance to get it for the first time it won’t be ruined by this shit.
---
I kinda feel stupid but it’s killing me to know so uh… where Vigil at though
---
They don’t get much cuter than that
---
The gadget ones were the only good ones.  I had Frost's Welcome Mat, Buck's Skeleton Key, Valkyrie's Black Eye, Caveira's Lusion, and Hibana's X-Kairos Launcher.
---
Man, I didn't know Gridlock was a defense op!
---
Or: We have a chat filter, and don't need to deal with harsh words or mute people.
---
Problem solved.
---
Bad news: Now instead of swearing you see ****.
---
Do you *really* wanna swear *that badly*?
---
I only use reflex
---
*what i mean by "i found cav" is that cav is interrogating me on the other side of the map*
---
r/expectedthanos
---
Helps when you’re against bots.
---
Yeap, sick shooting, but the defuser got yah... the safest of times
---
I actually like Ash mains.
---
I tend to get a few kills off them as Kapkan. They rush into the trap I placed to cover my flank/rear and that either kills them or wounds them, and I spin round and finish them off. 
---
Of course, if I happen to run into one as I'm lurking about, I'm just fucking dead. IMO Ash mains tend to have scary good reflexes.
---
The &lt; or &gt; has been banned or something, just saw another post on here. Those were being used to lag games in the chat
---
Top 10 *BRUH* moments
---
This is me. I'm not an Ash main :(
---
r/unexpectedthanos for balance
---
That makes sense cause we all got confused why we couldn’t type &lt;3 to the other team
---
I was in a plat 5 stack, but that's a fair point
---

---
O O
---
They use an adapter that masks the MnK inputs as controller inputs
---
Would you be able to add a way to toggle which KD to show? Would love to show overall ranked or even seasonal kd
---
If you ever used bugs for your own advantage you can get perma-banned.
---
What was the game about ?
---
can confirm
---
Two outcomes 
---
A. They melt Ash, keep the defuser, and win 
---
B. Ash runs past all of them, shreds the enemy team, plants, and singlehandedly wins the team the round
---
Them sharing that opinion doesn't make you right. Are you so dependent on confirmation from peers that you ignore everything over it?
---
I am not looking for wht fits my narrative. I am simply telling you what is: M+KB is not forbidden, no matter how much you want it. I didn't even make a statement about if I think that's good or not. But it seems like you are looking very hard for some kind of confirmation, as you can't find an actual argument to back your opinion up.
---
EA bought the title to R6?
---
Can we get some F's going in chat.
---
^ exactly what I am talking about.
---
Have fun waiting for Ubisoft to "fix your broken game".
---
But then you wouldn’t be able to change your loadout
---
You’re entering a stage of rank where the Siege player starts to attempt becoming and take their game to the next level, but also don’t have enough knowledge/patience to keep cool during tense situations. 
---
As toxic as they are, my honest suggestion is to try and remain humble and say something like “my bad guys, I haven’t been Plat for too long, I’m just now starting to get decent so go easy on me please, I’m trying my best.”
---
If they have any decency at all they might stop bullying/berating you and let you play. Engaging in a back and forth never helps anybody.
---
I love Frost, she’s great. Love placing cheeky mats in obj to catch sneaky ops who get past my team.
---
I think you succeeded in doing that!
---
So relatable.
---
Toxic babes incoming
---
My neck. Thnx.
---
No they cannot
---
Totally read this in David Attenborough's voice... It's the only way.
---
And you got the calico Jack Headgear lmao. I got this like 7 times and it's the only headgear i ever got from an alpha pack.
---
Alphapacks are so unsatisfying.
---
My point exactly, how do you mess up a kill cam ffs, it's only been around since like, what? 2007?
---
It’s do or die boys
---
I think you used the colours wrong, red should be for the hardest ones to counter while green for the easiest.
---
Also what's so hard about countering Glaz, Cav, Fuze, Clash or Ying? Echo I will agree can often be handful but most of the ops are rather easy to counter.
---
It sounds like someone hacked into your account and used it to cheat.
---
No I mean reload after you take away ads
---
What helps me the most is to recenter myself and try to recall the hours and hours I’ve spent training aim in TH. I find that when I get too tilted or on edge I start to flick too far and go for body shots because it’s the biggest target. But when I relax a little, grab some water, and consciously try to imagine the enemy as just really skilled bots it becomes much better for me. I’m so used to just aiming for the head when it comes to bots that getting in that “training” mindset makes it easier to get the aim back on track.
---
An upvote would be a good place to start:)
---
NO NOMAD IS ALREADY OP AS FUCK
---
Reported for begging
---
Well I am bad with but Clash can be very annoying I’m deaf (joking) so I can’t hear cav Glaz can be a jerk out of nowhere and sometimes I get stuck and die to a cluster charge and those are the default colors
---
SENT
---
Use MP5 acog 24/7, super good for aim training in casual.
---
nice art, but red baron with acog? 😯
---
I think Nøkk with defuser scares me more
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
Recoil control can be easily handled if you practice enough. Her weapon is decent as it is. If they lower the recoil then it might be a bit too much because her gadget is quite good too. I'm a PC player so I can't say anything for the recoil on console which I have no idea how people control :0
---
I think its more widespread as services doing it for you are now available and becoming more common.
---
Ash at full health? What?
---
Just for the giggles:
---
&gt;A witch-hunt or witch purge is a search for people labelled "witches" or evidence of witchcraft, often involving moral panic or mass hysteria  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;In current language, "witch-hunt" metaphorically means an investigation usually conducted with much publicity, supposedly to uncover subversive activity, disloyalty and so on, but really to weaken political opposition
---
Have you heard of prevention? Do you know why this has been **also** brought up to Ubisoft? Because people **will** do something that is not being actively prevented. Would you steal from time to time if you knew it wasn't being prevented? If you had people around you who steals but no one gets caught ever, would you do it too sometimes? Well, a lot of people would do it as they are doing this as well because no one does anything.
---
This is where Ubisoft comes in because you can clearly see on the leaderboard on any tracker site that 90% of the first 20-30-40 people on Xbox on PS uses it. That is so blatant you literally have to be blind not to see it.
---
So, they should look for clear proofs like these and not just ban the account (ban that too) but also working with MS and Sony to ban their consoles too. With this punishment, they could **prevent** others doing it because people are like this, they usually stop doing illegal things if they know they definitely get caught and get punished for it.
---
Most of these people who DoS others, do not use any method to avoid things like doing it from countries where this is not illegal. They just look for the first youtube video about it, using the most common IP tracer software and then use the most common sites that can send DoS attacks. BUT, it also doesn't matter how you do it, if you are in a country where it is illegal (US and all of Europe), you can go to jail.
---
Now connect this with the blatant proofs of doing it and bam, you have a lot of people that aren't anonymous anymore and you can go on with the legal procedures. And after all this happening, would you do it if you knew you can get caught, get your whole console banned and even go to jail? Yeah, most of the kids wouldn't.
---
Those shields are an exploit in themselves. Should be an operators main ability not a bonus ability for ops like jager who dont need the buff, I would say Giving chanka 2 of these would be a decent rework for him.
---
You look like Lesion’s little brother, Abrasion
---
oh fuk anything but that
---
Whatever happened to just accepting your rank and try and improve it by getting better at the game? Nah, too much like hard work, get your better mate to roll a copper smurf then you can get Plat2 when you’re clearly a Silver4 at best.
---
so even if we beat them we get the minus?
---
We all know ubisoft won't do that
---
Ralof: Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
---
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that

thief over there.
---
Lokir: Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was
---
nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen
---
that horse and been half way to Hammerfell. You there. You and me -- we
---
should be here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants.
---
Ralof: We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief.
---
Imperial Soldier: Shut up back there!
---
[Lokir looks at the gagged man.]
---
Lokir: And what's wrong with him?
---
Ralof: Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High
---
King.
---
Lokir: Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if
---
they captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?
---
Ralof: I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.
---
Lokir: No, this can't be happening. This isn't happening.
---
Ralof: Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?
---
Lokir: Why do you care?
---
Ralof: A Nord's last thoughts should be of home.
---
Lokir: Rorikstead. I'm...I'm from Rorikstead.
---
[They approach the village of Helgen. A soldier calls out to the lead wagon.]

Imperial Soldier: General Tullius, sir! The headsman is waiting!
---
General Tullius: Good. Let's get this over with.
---
Lokir: Shor, Mara, Dibella, Kynareth, Akatosh. Divines, please help me.
---
Ralof: Look at him, General Tullius the Military Governor. And it looks like
---
the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do
---
with this.
---
This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod

is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny...when I

was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.

&gt;You guys literally don't give a shit about anything but "I can't play"
---
Yes of course. THAT is my thought pattern. I'm only driven by: I can't play. Grow up, srly.
---
They have easy measures to determine client's latency, no need to monitor the whole stack. (You get kicked by BE when your latency is to high, remember?).
---
BTW it is not that hard to imitate protocols. And a DoS doesn't have to be an ICMP flood. There are other attacks. Trying to memory leak the server, segfaulting the server etc.
---
There is no need to determine who initiated the attack. The attack shouldn't have an impact of winning or losing. Period.
---
Well in euros (my currency) it's 12. Still interesting tho
---
real money or grinding renowns to spend
---
Actually had that, we lost a round of ranked because of her...
---
I got the same message for  using a "://" emote on its own.
---
Thanks. You shure do main a lot of shit yourself.
---
how do i get renowns?
---
warden could have the P90 (maybe), but nøkk should not have a new gun. giving her an AR, even without an ACOG, would make her too strong. she is perfectly balanced right now
---
I have several questions
---
If I could change her the only thing I would do is give her a drum mag on the fmg9 and lower the damage a tad bit. My only issue is getting caught out in longer range fights and not having the ammo capacity to duel.
---
Never judge people on their rank or lvl, they might as well be smurfs, also grind T-hunt to learn the maps
---
That's a season skin from velvet shell if I remember correctly
---
I bought the standard one with the base 20 and it took about a year to collect every one. If your going to use r6 credits dont buy them individually just by a bundle it will save 50%.
---
Now kith
---
Playing, you get 200-300 renown per game of casual. The dlc operators cost 25k renown so you can see how much of a grind it is.
---
You missed the drone bot
---
Exactly, if you want to play with your buddy of disparate skill, go play casual.  There is no viable solution that makes the game fun or fair for anyone else.
---
Shoutout to you guys for not tk’ing thermite
---
Just play. You get 100-200 renown per match

270 no scope. So damn close to a 360.
---
&gt;She unfortunately has Caviera  syndrome. She is good at amateur and low level play but isn't going to be that useful at pro league.
---
Doubt it. Cav is easy to counter since the very function of her gadget is countered by easy game mechanics
---
However, PL is basically Intel meta, and she counters 90% of it. Plus, she is liked by pros. She's going to find a good place in PL.
---
&gt;She falls apart fast against a coordinated and compotent team.
---
Technically, she is designed to coordinate coordinated Intel.

I’m glad Maestro, Kaid and Mute have mid/mid-high pick rates. I’m new here and I felt relieved knowing they’re decent and not considered bad &lt;3
---
What is o///o?
---
and how much will it cost with real money? if im gonna spend real money am i gonna buy one operator or a whole bundle
---
This was very funny and made my day! Thank you!
---
Yeah but the Keratos is a nice backup, (almost) every time I play Albi I'm forced to use both, plus the destruction the balif has isn't that good
---
A tip: play T-hunt, it’s like another world compared to Casual and Ranked, also earns you some good renown
---
Okay and how exactly does this system work properly when the lowest of ranks queue with the highest of ranks?
---
I'd say in this regard it's not exactly a flaw of the system but Ubisoft's lack of foresight, they should have restricted the ranks in lobbies ages ago.
---
Damn boi , where did u find this ?
---
The reality hurts recruit :(
---
Hahaha
---
That gave me a big 😮
---
Good thing all doors in Siege world have the same size
---
o///o is used as an emoticon for an orgasming anime girl
---
I mean In OW where they have this system. Can’t play comp with my full group because they learned to play PC shooters in its competitive type and got Elo locked. It’s a system that sounds great but can’t fuck u over.
---
To me it works only for 20%, people tend to shoot everything human they see.

New to gaming? It's called a 2D sprite, and it has been used in 3D games since the beginning.

Or Blitz
---
Some are cheaper
---
Year 1 and 2 cost roughly $4 each, newer ones cost $5 each, and I'm not sure about the bundles. Just know that the general conversion rate is $5 for 600 r6 credits.

And of course you didn't think of any better flair.

Update: Yep I got a abandon sanction and lost 70 elo all because the game kicked me for ping issues that were fixed and wouldn't let me join.
---
That fact that you can't buy the pro league skins with credits is a travesty - I used real money to buy those credits, why not offer it??
---
Thanks,  this exploit was super annoying
---
Mozzi
---
Do i smell acog
---
maybe it is not boosting?
---
Maybe it is just a group of friends who want to play together?
---
They're coming. Run.
---
How is she leaning without ADSing on console?
---
Real talk, whenever stuff like this happens (like this or stuck holding an impact) it always messes with me. I think that they aren't in a position to shoot back at me, fire at them, then all of a sudden I see bullets coming out of their face
---
Felt cute, may go to the bikerclub later i dont know
---
In my opinion Mozzie is the best. You can get so much info out of the drones and his guns are good. I use Mozzie to drone enemies out so my friend can flank them.
---
Mira is the most banned operator though if I'm seeing the chart right.
---
for the first 2 years i only played Rook and Thermite now i play everything and the game is a lot more fun imo. Being "stuck" with one or 2 operators and doing the same set up every round gets tedious imo again.
---
this is actually aesthetically pleasing to me
---
Wait kill stealing is a thing? I could care less if someone "took" a kill from me, as long as the opponent dies
---
Shame jackal wont see the light of ranked ever again
---
Grab an alt and put it to like plat 3. That way you can play with your other friends and while there's a difference in elo/skill, it doesn't equate to a disparity. 
---
Wouldn't be smurfing, I hover around plat 2 - 3 and vs diamonds all the time.
---
I only wanted the headgear.
---
I didn't even know that this was in shop back then :/
---
Gg bro hard game I see
---
looks absoultely badass
---
people who ban thermite and thatcher need to commit die
---
It could use 16 more panels
---
Unfortunately, ubi already nerfed Maestro's Cigar- I doubt they would introduce any tobacco related anything \*for the operators specifically\* for fear that a player might justify identify with them. It's interesting how in game development, the characters and outfits are restricted by certain moralities, but the environments aren't- \*Hookah lounge, strip club, various bars, grow rooms, etc. 
---
Not to mention the classic and simple nature of the game: This is a game about stalking and killing other people, there is blood and gore and the bodies will fall limp when they die. "That's all okay but this cigar man. This cigar is sending a negative message!!!" Just an observation that makes me laugh.
---
I did ask them to clarify but Im guessing I'll have to wait another month if ever to hear back. The only thing that could possibly be is an overlay that goes on my second monitor that just gives me splash art and time, weather etc.
---
I just played a game with with a diamond on the other team in a high silver low gold game. He had 21 kills with his teammates only having at most 3 and we lost 4-5. It really sucks that there might be rank party restrictions for people like me where my friends will solo q and drop to bronze while I am at gold even though we are all around the same skill level. This is a much needed change though that ubi need to add ASAP
---
Big Dev teams don't make things quicker, if anything it slows development down. That's why you have titles like Anthem that are complete shitshows. It's why WoW has been garbage every other xpac. Money doesn't mean anything except that you have a paycheck to keep working on the game.
---
There's no perspective issue in siege right now, it's the result of having only one pov, and it affects literally every game on the market. To counteract this, try to not hold long sight lanes when an enemy is close and push instead.
---
That would be awesome
---
I like mozzie the best here. Kaids dmr is too hard for me to use tho so if you got good single shot aim kaid would be a great choice. Warden is kinda weak rn
---
Mozzie
---
Looks crisp tho

You should be turning most of your settings low to get as many frames as possible. 
---
Ambient Occlusion, Anti Aliasing, and Shadows take the biggest hit to your GPU. 
---
Me personally I run a GTX 1080 and an i7-7700k and I can achieve about 140-220 FPS at 1440p. 
---
I keep shadows at medium, Textures at medium, everything else as low as possible if not off. And I’m also at 75% render scale. 
---
Frame rate&gt; eye candy
---
Also, it shaves off as much input lag as possible.
---
At this point I’m convinced it’ll take 2-3 years to get Clash back at the rate Ubi is going
---
The copper was mvp tho 🤔
---
The wheels on the main wheels
---
literally dropshot
---
I disagree, his elite should have no eyes and also when you play him your screen is solid black the entire time
---
This is absolutely incredible, great work!
---
For some people that's surely important. Pretty much the reason why it's rare to see anything really controversial.
---
If i understood your comment correctly, then the answer is : Go play Casual.
---
Thank you so much!
---
oh boi. but maybe theyd make a new game who knows. Just like outbreak 2.0 (dont know what its called)

No my ads sensitivity is way below my hip fire sensitivity

&gt; Naturally this is a very helpful post for people to know about - thus the Mods will delete it within a few hours just like every other post highlighting this issue ive seen. 
---
They are deleting this because you guys are constantly posting about something you have vague details about at best. The issue is related to Microsofts services and it can't be fixed by Ubisoft alone. This is spamming false information on the nature of the problem and causing Ubi devs to receive a lot of flak about something that isn't really their fault. 
---
Go back through todays history and look at how many posts are talking about DDoS on console... Mods are doing their job.
---
Yeah bro I was bandit main too

Check out the R6 Discord

You don't know if the Denial of Service is comming from one source or multiple. So it is DoS because you can't say for sure that it is distributed (DDoS).

Ok

Meme dude, everyone in game says that.

You know to be honest I don’t know. I think it just a point of reference for the middle of your screen and nothing more than that but...if it does tighten your bullet spread in any form, it be dope👌🏼

You're not wrong

Yes, probably in a few hours from now.
---
99 common 1 uncommon
---
I got thermite and pulse. I don’t remember the last time I played pulse. Maybe give him a shot
---
That seems better than your solution. It would still allow high silvers to play with high golds etc. I do get what you are saying with the 4 v 5 earlier though. I don’t want my friend to be locked out of playing with the rest of my squad. The solution would be four smurfs to rank him up which would be the exact same problem we have now. Me being a plat player smurfing to get him within the normal range (let’s say low gold to high gold) is just what we have with extra steps.
---
You sound ignorant. Maybe you should get your eyes checked because you are blind as fuck
---
Kaid is more of a situational pick where you can deny hatches above the area you are defending. He does have a C4 which is great utility and decent weapons. Mozzie would be my pick - he does have good SMGs, secondary shotgun which is really important for bombsite setup and most importantly -  you can deny intel gathering, or even worse for attackers, you can take control of one of their drones where you can gather intel for your team. You also have C4.
---
Warden is just....ok? I think Kaid and Mozzie bring far more to the team than Warden does
---
true.
---
An old dude with a massive hard on for the US military, and OK writing skills.

As a Monty main I really love baiting enemies like that
---
Take notes kiddos. This is the casual is meant to be played :P/s
---
RIP ACOG
---
nice
---
How does making me smurf to get my friend up in ranks solve your problem of getting unfairly stomped?
---
No one wants these skins. They're low effort.

Because people just want ranked charm and they don’t give a f about the colour

Holy mother that looks f**king beautiful.

You know what's even better? Can be used on nøkk as well.
---
Is it just me or the slits aren't optimal?  The mest ones are the ones horizontal on each sides.  The other ones your camera doesn't look at them directly however you position your model
---
I think it's over the top. It didn't need this
---
Velvet shell was the last season with good universal skins
---
That is default account booster not a original owner ofc lol. Dont be a naive kid please, $$ can up you to diamond
---
I got thermite and jeagr. And thermite is my main lol
---
However most devices/routers are able to handle a Dos, so unless you are on outdated or restricted tech then a DDoS is more probable
---
*You know what an Artist and a Sniper have in common?*
---
Why try føkk is sledge C? Dude's the most balanced op in the game and can be used anywhere.
---
Yeah man it's like they have to code stuff into the game
---
Wait, thats illegal!
---
Bomb site attacker pushes under the cover of smokes and or flashbangs (including Ying), you can counter a plant by seeing through the cover and or catching the pushing attacker during flashes.
---
Also hard counters Blitz.
---
Tru, its been hard to play ranked for me at least on xbox this season bc salty ddos-ers are way too common in my experience
---
Ya I want to put him I b know that I look back at it
---
Currently there is two types of attack strats on Xbox that end up being effective in min 70% of matches.
---
1. You push right away
---
2. You push later on
---
console meta is to overwhelm the enemy with the moment of surprise and/or superior aim by pushing into obj from all sides at the same time, ideally building psychological pressure by playing mind games...if one door falls it’s usually over in favor of attack.
---
The thing that works best on Xbox in plat elo is you approach the building safely, drone it carefully for like 10 secs then you go in for the map sweep, clear out roamers and ideally you are in front of the obj and killed or pushed all roamers into obj before 90 secs are over. Then you attack with full force, ideally two people pushing at once to get instant refrag, if roamers are cleared properly you are 5v3, a coordinated push and good eyes means easy win.
---
Defense has three viable tactics:
---
1. You play the 2-3 game with two roamers complementing each other wasting time and being good at grading bold attackers
---
2. You play the 1-4 game it’s a soft roamer
---
3. You go turtle mode and annoy the attackers by denying everything. They entry into obj, their attempts to clear roamers, kills, so they spend most of their time wasting time, being weirdly uncomfortable and waiting for you to do something.
---
Best defense imo is the 2-3 game, but you have to adapt, I had a scrim on Sunday where the 4-1 worked two times and then they adapted and we went into turtle mode after two losses, they were very confused and spent two minutes making sure they’re not getting flanked by a hidden vigil, half of them were already severely injured and held useless angles where the other half tired to enter the room through a door held by an evil eye and a ela shotgun.
---
Defense is the opposite. Roamers waste as much time as possible as early as possible without ever seriously committing to any gunfight, open windows, create a dangerous environment (toothless tiger), if the frag is possible and not very risky, take it, otherwise retreat and repeat the tactic. Anchors check angles and intel stays in cams and keeps talking. Ideally you force them to push within the last 30 to 15 secs and with already one or two guys down, they get nervous and make mistakes, easy win.
---
Ofc in real play it doesn’t work like that. But I can and should work at least similarly. It depends on who wins gunfights ( better aim and reaction) and who is more creative and adaptable.
---
A surprise rush can be a huge game changer, just as having a illusive pulse or frost they didn’t see in warmup phase. People who don’t know how to deal with being stunned by echo or a really good maestro player can be as impactful as a genius capitao, a suddenly sledge/buck opens up ceiling/ground tactic or the creative use of holes in the line of defense (unreinforced hatches, walls, hallways only defied bumpy a single gu + booby trap).

So he is basically counter for Flashbangs (when he don’t move) counters Ying and hardly counter blitz (And the blitz might melee him) ?
---
Only if it is a network attack on Layer 3 or 4. When I cause a memory leak on the server or cause a segfault I've create a DoS. You can't say for sure that it is a DDoS, so the general term DoS is true (too).
---
But I accept that it is commonly referred to as DDoS - nevertheless is my terminology true.
---
Combination of underpaying the devs, corporate greed, and incompetent leaders
---
Nothing it's as bad as velvet shell release
---
You can move during flashbangs, need to stand still to see through smoke.

If Blitz is in melee range so are you, difference is you aren't blind this time around.

Great art , but I instantly see a male Finka .

I know the devs and the community managers are on this sub and are quite active but literally the reason for r6fix is so that ubi can get information on how to recreate the issue internally so they can figure out what's causing the issue.
---
looking at this screenshot anyone can see the issue but if ubi can't figure out the steps and what is actually breaking in the game, how are they supposed to know what to fix.
---
anyways here is the link if you actually want this issue addressed https://r6fix.ubi.com/live-server/create/

Opened 90 alpha packs and got 10 epics/legendaries.

I know sound doesn't work well but I think he is oversaying it so it becomes boring.

Idk how they could have let you get away with that. They did everything right. Let your hard breach hibana entry frag, ash drop-shotted like she was trained to, and blitz didn’t flash you. There’s no way they should have lost that. /s
---
Sorsby!

If they remove this the game will become extremely frustrating as most of the time you'll probably do it because someone pops up and aiming would be faster than switching weapons

I don't know, but I remember seeing those vids of ubisoft saying they were hiring based on skin color (black &gt; white) and underpaying devs, as well as forcing them to watch their bullshit video which got leaked implying black people had more "personality" than white people.
---
Overall, Ubisoft seems to be trying to please shareholders, which isn't a bad move by them, but it lowers the quality of the games they make when they focus so much less on the game itself.
---
Can the filter differentiate between the two? There's already a mute button. Use it.

1- range advantage
---
2- angle holding, if you need it
---
3- 38 damage at 780 rpm, TTK of 160 odd, the only primary on defense that can beat that is the ALDA, and that beats the r4c as well. Plus, if you use 650 rpm guns like the ak74, para, m249, and 670 and 690 rpm guns like the l85 and 556, this one feels satisfactorily quicker.
---
4- pros, such as joystick of empire, one of the best and now most popular ash main, has officially shifted to the g36c.

Your move.
---
200+ hours on terrohunt classic. Can confirm.
---
I'm just not sure how that'll will actually do anything. I just think it would get the same result of there was only one ADS there.
---
I'm definitely not an expert but if they were using subsonic charges they wouldn't mount a suppressor. The suppressor channels the sound of the normal cartridge inside which is also why you don't see a muzzle flash yet because of the extended barrel, if the suppressor has proper rifling it could actually increase the bullets rotation and therefore stability which would actually give it more reach and actually more damage them before
---
Australians are weird.

In all seriousness they definitely just copied the texture.

---
That’s pretty evenly matched, low bronzes against high coppers and a silver
---
I’m not sure where you’re getting that from. The attacker drones are always the same color, regardless of teams. And Mozzie’s hacked drones are always blue.   You don’t need to think at all about which drones to shoot out. 
---
And seeing as *all* defender cams are blue already, if defenders were consistently blue, it would make a little more sense. 
---
Right now, orange team defends first, and blue team attacks first. Then after that, it cycles.  But the teams right now other than that mean nothing, no correlation to the game at all.
---
If defenders were always blue team, and attackers orange, then the drones and cameras would correlate, and thus requiring less thought. 
---
As you mentioned though, I don’t know why the attacker cams were made yellow. Orange or red would have been fine.
---
Two seconds later the c4 was thrown
---
I’d rather them take their time and fix it completely than fix them many times.
---
Yes, but realistically, there would be no way to accurately determine skill based on level.. What happens when a level 30 smurf is in your game and you're level 28ish? You would get absolutely demolished and there's no way for the game to tell that the level 30 should actually be playing with higher leveled players....

---
I'm pretty sure they were just kill greedy and you already make the trade of by not having a lesser recoil, longer barrel and less damage after penetration
---
Typical lazy ubi
---
Can someone ELI5 controller rotation curve?
---
Some background: Usually I'm around high silver, low gold, but so far this season I've been matched with leavers tkers and throwers. There's been basically no chance of me recovering my rank. See you next season, ubi.

Ηe edited his comment.Before that he said that only 12 year old toxic players want it back.Or just Reddit bugged and the answer I gave to someone else just transferred here...
---
Lol Nazi logo doesn't matter you are triggered.

---
Ubi stated they don’t want it because consoles aren’t capable of creating a smooth experience with a MnK. Consoles need to see frame rates above 60FPS (which will be next consoles). I wouldn’t be surprised if Siege starts supporting MnK on console shortly after the new consoles are released. 
---
Either way, I’ll be on PC by then so I won’t give a crap one way or another lol.
---
Ya don’t get me wrong it’s annoying asf but I’d rather that be annoying then this game stop being updated, I love everything about this game😂
---
then factor skill level and clearance level. you now have a semi-balamced matchup, more balanced for everyone (or not, on Xbox everything is fucked up. my team is always a bit and a half while the enemy team is like G2 but they have controllers but they've always been using controllers)
---
But it's clearly under balanced
---
what are these? I never saw them in my 100 levels
---
I’m sure they use different outlets in Asia too?
---
It literally does what it's meant to do.
---
I’m on PS4, and the set isn’t in the actual “game store” when I click the same thing that you are clicking, it takes you to the PlayStation store. I’m not sure how it works for pc, but maybe check the place you bought the game?
---
Sorry this recent college grad is too poor for a pc, if your feeling generous I’m accepting donations now
---
Actually, that cross had been used for plenty of years before WW2, and its only use in WW2 was a base for a swastika to be superimposed on. You'd have an argument if it had the swastika on it, but it doesn't.
---
Maverick should excuse himself for his aim lol
---
Just give IQ her frags back, won't that fix like all the exploits that keep happening with her
---
both are acceptable.
---
I love Bandit too.He was my most used operator when I started and now I pick him a lot again
---
Yes but the downsides are too many
---
There’s will always be people better and worse then you so no I wouldn’t
---
No, the only reason we got the ela and zofia situation was that the operators were guaranteed but pushed back due to operation health.
---
take someone with the same gun, valk, she gets 3 cams you can throw anywhere even outside. shes a 2 speed, and gets a secondary that can break holes in walls well
---
if youre talking about the gun, why would you ever pick him over her then? 
---
also nobody thinks hes fine because nobody ever plays him. it looks like he was designed back when ying had smokes and was in every game, but that was like a year ago
---
These are ancient artifacts called epic and legendary alpha packs. Back when Ubisoft was only a little bit greedy and not entirely greedy, you might stumble upon one of these! These days they are the rarest of artifacts known to mankind
---
Seeing rook with shotgun made my erection go away.
---
Why do it yourself when robots do it better?
---
How the fuck did any of this even happen
---
Don't apologize to that cunt
---
If there was 1, someone would burn the ads with flashs so someone with smokes or nades can throw their gadget but with two, you need to burn all 3 flashes and then waste a smoke or nade just to throw one more.
---
in-n’-cest
---
I thought his shotgun was supposed to be good.
---
If that's the case and it really doesn't change the MMR for a 4 booster team, then it is definitely an improvement overall.
---
My experience is that only 2 of those boosters are random.  2 are usually friends who keep a main and a low-MMR smurf and take turns boosting each other.  And the difference is even more extreme (they derank if they ever hit silver, sometimes while still in bronze).  I'm not sure what the similar concept would be for PS and PC, but on Xbox it's usually pretty clear from gamerscore whether those low ranks are smurfs or actual coppers/bronzes.
---
Maybe rather than a limit between players, you could have a limit between individual players and the group average MMR?  That could be set fairly high (since MMR is so volatile and you do get legitimate times where friends of varying skill play together) and still prevent both our examples.
---
Al-a-bama
---
Not really
---
Oh i remember seeing them in year 2, where are they now?
---
Yeah they’re greedy but they looked the wrong way is what I’m saying. And if you’re pushing site and your gun is suppressed it’s a little harder for them to evaluate your push
---
You say it like it's a bad thing
---
Literally nobody misses playing against Clash
---
Because people's feelings are so fucking sensitive these days that you can't even say GG because people assume you are talking shit.

---
Nvidia profile inspector let's u set an fps cap for every game
---
Nah, if doc dies on a runout,  he looses all of his utility and it doesn’t get spared wisely. Rook on the other hand can place his armor down and he has already benefited the team a bunch and if he dies in a spawnpeek, yes it’s a loss of a guy, but his utility isn’t wasted.
---
Shotguns: *exist* 
---
Year 1 players: *it’s free real estate*
---
You didn’t work for the kill. I also said it only matters in certain situations.
---
No it’s the only defenders they have black ice on dumb dumb
---
Considering you were using a shotgun it wasnt bad.
---
Ubisoft is so annoying sometimes, the game is getting full of hackers but when I’m trying to be positive I get warning :/
---
There is so many Intel Ops in the game you got barbed wire, teammates can call out with killcam and people with good headsets will still hear you. In my opinion just not being heard and no threat indicator and the few other ups are not enough to justify a 20 %damage nerf
---
Yes, of course
---
When you're watching the killcam, is that your client or theirs?
---
Depends, if you watch the kill cam can they see you? One of the Burnt Horizon patches changed the perspective point, particularly when leaning side-to-side, so you may be getting dropped from odd angles now that wouldn't seem possible pre- Burnt Horizon
---
This is so relatable
---
Thats just an ordinary--- OH MY GOD

---
this is my feedback....
---
Beautiful
---
Quebexicans is better
---
Okay, this is epic
---
I agree with you that they are harder to spot than people think. I’ve been accused of it countless times on controller. 
---
I disagree with the giveaway being how many things they can do at once. With Scuf/Elite/Battle Beaver controllers you can do all the same things you can on a MnK so it’s only a giveaway that they aren’t using a standard PS4/Xbox controller. 
---
Also, MnK players don’t rely on flick shots. Maybe low level ones do. High ranked players know how to play, and flick shots are unreliable at best. Good players, no matter which input method they use, will always use good crosshair placement, map knowledge and game sense.
---
I was talking about the time when shotguns were really op in year 1
---
She's far from OP, she's just frustrating to play against for a few reasons so people just ban her to save the hassle/time. The same can be said for most of those bans with maybe the exception of Jackal who is borderline overpowered.
---
I think people sometimes have the wrong mentality when it comes to discussing operators like this (not saying anyone in this thread is). Most people assume that being "OP" is at the top of a tier systems ie. Good &gt; Great &gt; Very strong &gt; OP. But that's really not the case. Blitz could be considered "OP" by some players due to the lack of 1v1 counterplay in certain situations (same as Blackbeard). Whereas Echo would be "Very strong" owing to the fact that he has quite a few counters such as IQ, Thatcher and Nokk (lol).
---
Reworks are needed for "OP" operators where their kit is fundamentally flawed and proves frustrating/one sided to play against. Buffs and Nerfs are required for operators who fall in the categories of "very strong" or "very weak" where things such as damage values or ability cooldowns can be adjusted.
---
Instruction unclear. Other thing got stuck instead.
---
But seriously I just can't buy anything. I owned it on steam btw.
---
Oh sorry by bad
---
I'm sure they said they were gunna sort this (pretty sure they fixed it once before).

Just ubi things

Oh shit
---
It's very common to have Valk cams in objective, maestro and echo cams etc. Miras are almost always on objective. I'm not saying it'll be OP. Just unnecessary given all the tools defence already has for intel and placed right a defender will be able to gather alot safely behind one

Yea just happend there after my game

Zoo wee mama

Because shotty is life

It's yours IIRC, but If you see them having a very simple one tap through the broken piece of wood blocking your view (and only yours), you can guess that in his client the piece of wood is on the ground.
---
Dam I would lose my shit if that happened
---
Valk for me
---
I hadn't noticed that the team color is always the same on game start. Nice.
---
i believe so
---
I fucking love reddit
---
I got the crap scared out of me the other day when I was playing. I haven't had any infractions before and I typed "Wow that Monty raped us" after the Monty on the other team solo killed 4/5 of our team if i remember correctly.
---
Is this a strike system? Do these messages get evaluated for "naughtiness"?
---
I'm quite invested in Siege so I'd really like to know how much trouble I'm in!!!
---
Have you submitted a support ticket?
---
Lol i too haven't gotten an epic or legendary for the past 2 seasons and i play quite regularly
---
Yikes
---
Valk
---
If it is having an error where it won't redirect you to steam it could be that steam overlay isn't enabled. That was my issue.
---
I’m sure they already fixed this a long time ago during one season (forgot which one, probably operation health) and then when the next season released, the issue came back and was never fixed. I wish Ubisoft would stop making season passes and just fix their fucking game.
---
When will they be back?
---
They are fanatical, and have no concern for their own personal safety
---
What do you mean, on most guns that you can get it for it's the best skin in the game
---
That makes more sense, heat effect is a pretty good idea
---
I will be streaming it this evening. My name is universal across all social media
---
How would you expect Ubisoft to address smurfing?
---
She good.
---
I have!
---
She prolly ate them
---
I’ve never gotten shit for it and I use them on a good 10-12 ops.
---
Reservists... I smell a Reservist.
---
Bandit cried himself to sleep. Chunky hid in the center right after start. Nokk injured herself. Finka has a few kills with a poisonous blowdart and ended up first with 7 kills followed by rook with 6.
---
Granted, you're now locked in newcomer mode indefinitely and no longer need to worry about ruining other people's game with your garbage attitude.
---
Well then you are just lucky in matchmaking, I constantly get shit for using them
---
Exactly, it happens with every games
---
Do you have a TV or Monitor?
---
Explain?
---
No, not really, no.
---
The bomb is still safe if attackers and defenders die together. Gameplay wise, attackers have to defuse the bomb which will go off in 3 minutes otherwise, so if they aren't alive to defuse it, then the bomb will still go off after 3 miniutes and shakalakaboomboomphuff and the attackers have failed there mission.
---
That was the last time he played ash. Yes ash is his back up but no one really cares to play ash anymore. Joystick is not really comfortable on ash anymore because of her acog for r4c getting taken away and normally it is just banned.
---
Are we gonna skip over the fact he went blitz in a t hunt...
---
Game developers being underpaid/mistreated has become a mainstream issue with almost every parent company.
---
Link?
---
You are supposed to be on point with him so having to position for a smoke push wouldnt even take long, like literally a second or two. His biggest issue is that he HAS to stand still so he can properly use his gadget with VERY little fragging power to actually stop a push. The MPX is one of the worst SMG's in the game, the P90 is technically worse DPS wise but it has a Acog which actually makes it useful, like way more useful

Yeah, every single time.

Absolute unit- cheers

Look at the right something odd there

That gave me more salt than dealing with toxic ppl does

i got thermite and pulse

Casuals easier then newcomer tho newcomer is full of hackers and smurfs. When i got a second account i went into casual because i knew that the smurfs in newcomer were better then i was.
---
Thermite and Pulse, I already play Thermite so not surprised.

If it's a map feature currently I don't assume they'll remove it?

Why didnt you cut the first 50 seconds out?

frost?

Rook fucking drowned in a frozen lake and Blackbeard died to a fucking fireball

Says the dude who bought the game a week ago.

Probably not. First the Sun splash packs.  Next week will be exactly 1 year after they have added the sun splash packs and we know there is a new line of sun splash packs, expect that next week.

-banned
---
Oh shoot me in the toe you are right lol!
---
You mean the slightly different colored barely noticeable “wood” legendaries don’t do it for you?
---
I would honestly, but I worry that they won’t think about it because they are PC players
---
Aim for the head , settling for body shots ain’t gonna cut it in siege
---
I found the survey; I got Thermite and Jäger :D
---
Yeah true. Well we know for sure that this update is adding some kinda event though
---
I'm surprised tho- the questions are kinda vague and there's only a few of em... I'm baffled that it's still kinda accurate apparently.

I don't play ash tho so it's more of a 50/50 I guess

Probably have some sort of combination of usual suspects, it's more of starting point than a full recommendation of all operators.

Hm, most TVs have a higher response time (~55ms) while most monitors have a very low one (~8ms-1ms). Maybe you should lookup your specific response time online idk

Hahaha thanks, it's like my second time using gimp.

Wow so cool! Wana be my best friend now?
---
maybe modify a camera tripod for it just an idea
---
Just fell lucky that they lowered the prices and they are not all 25000.
---
&gt;it has zero recoil and high rate of fire
---
So does most of the defender’s smg if you really think about it, bandit’s mp7, alibi’s mx4 and lesion’ smg just to name a few
---
That’s really fucking beautiful
---
There was one game I had on Favela, before RFF, where I ran back and forth in front of the enemy team's Monty and the Hibana headshot him while trying to get me.
---
In two separate rounds.
---
No, because it violates the rules. Im sure there is punishments for unsportsmanlike conduct, is that cheating?
---
Cool! But Clash?
---
Thats sad I play on seas, will get over 200 ping on eu. However go out and try it and report bugs to ubisoft, the operator glitches are fixed ans the new deployable shield is out.
---
Usually you do get a pop up in game, surprised we didn't have it this time around.
---
That's reassuring! 
---
Thanks for the response, have a good one!

No, well probably not, but he is becoming a Twitch streamer. Though it's for his campaign and interviews and stuff, he isn't going to be streaming games.... Probably

PWNED LMFAO

HEY!

I SEE HIM!
---
No... you are the exception. I never get any

If anyone says breadsticks it means only 1 kill.

My game crashes like in parabellum
---
Go to the r/rainbow6, not just your home screen and in the top right hand corner there are 3 dots. Tap them and choose the select flair button and take your pick.
---
and here i am at 67%
---
Were not talking about unsportsmanlike conduct. Were talking about breaking the gameplay rules for competitive edge. Aka cheating.
---
Doubt that but keep trolling! It’s great content /s
---
I’ve gotten like 3 purples in the last week, but I don’t use any skins.
---
I would do that but my internet and download speed is so bad it would take about 30 hours to reinstall it
---
I’m level 80 and I have gotten only one legendary and even less epics
---
What does these colors mean i have never seen them in my life??
---
RIP
---
the only thing ur getting reported for is desyncing ur sound from ur gameplay
---
My guy do is that window glare? Feels bad.
---
what’s the source on this?  can i buy one of these?
---
80% of my alpha packs are common duplicates, and I don't even have that many common skins/charms.
---
So no head?
---
Mute does a lot that not alot of players know off muting up walls etc. be nice if it muted him out to a point as in you can still see stpes but not get a ping at your &lt;pos&gt;
---
Red dots has been used before tho... it’s personal preference.
---
Appreciate it man. I’ve always set flair on desktop so it’s a little different.
---
your camera got interrogated
---
I’ve never seen one. Let me guess, is it usually on the same screen as the skin advertisements? If thats so, it’s quite a bad placement for it. They should make it similar to a screen that greets you in the beginning of the season with new ops on the sides or have it placed in the bottom right corner.
---
sorry for that i use shadowplay to record as my cpu isn't great.
---
*woW
---
Wow
---
Ik lol i was joking
---
New motherboard-Lost key :(
---
‘Headshot machine’ listen if low recoil and high fire rate makes a fun good then almost every smg is good. Realistically headshots aren’t super regular in siege, you get a lot of body shot kills. And the mpx is one of the worst at that aspect. Every gun kills well if you spray for the head.
---
I deleted them later
---
I suppose so, but I feel gas station spawn for your particular scenario may be slightly better? You face peeks from consul windows and yellow stairs door but you still have a bit of time to prep for that
---
Pls tldr this very thought out answer.
---
Yes that would be fine, making the pings stop when u stay in a Mute jammer
---
You can spawnpeek with anyone. Hell I spawnpeek with the P10 Roni.
---
Eww PlayStation
---
How would lean without aim work though? Of course I want it too but we don’t have enough buttons friend.
---
I forgot its been a few years.
---
Not quite john wick status yet but you're getting close!
---
im only joking ;) first shot is a nice one though
---
I always assumed each rarity had a set chance, then every item in that tier has the same chance and one is picked randomly.
---
It's all my assumption though, I could be completely wrong.
---
I’m only on here because none of my friends can afford a pc  :(
---
Yeah but its the shine on his glasses that get me
---
Idk, I have rotation curve settings for my controller and have always used Aggressive.
---
No acog though
---
The p90 isn’t that bad mp5 just outweighs it in most situations
---
However i think that muting up walls as a counter for hard breachers is pretty known under the bigger part of the community
---
Do people really ‘apologize’ for their rank?
---
It could be, I honestly have no clue
---
Among other things yes, but next to your queue time and end game result screen a "X minutes to maintenance" banner would show.
---
Usually it gave enough time to finish any in progress games.
---
I do because it’s bad
---
updated is more consistent, there’s no acceleration which is why it feels slower. you may not notice a difference but turning it on will subconsciously build muscle memory.

Lol, I thought he was actually streaming games to get all the young ppl to vote for him lol
---
Make it look like a ballista for the lord
---
I can't *duplicate* understand *duplicate* your meme *6 more duplicate commons and an uncommon charm*
---
Same kind of. I'm American but getting this set to mess with my Moose friends.
---
I'm cracking up right now because we were playing earlier and talking shit about Canada when the Canadian friend showed up and we forgot to even tell him about it and why we were all giving him shit. I almost feel bad but it's funny so it's okay.
---
well i have a normal ps4 controller
---
Tons of people are on smurfs now .
---
Or the ping lasts a few sec instead of the 5 sec idk i dont play jack much. In a match its a lot of fun to get tracked threw the whole match. You lose almost 60% of game time.
---
shit guys i also got thermite and pluse.
---
Lol. perfect comment.
---
No, he’s hands down the best operator
---
so updated is better?
---
Oh no it's an Ela main, what have I done?
---
Recruit no meme fr everyone thinks you’ll suck them you clear everyone also idk I think it’s preference I love ying but she isn’t the best one
---
Mom
---
That is actually hilarious. I don’t even have Canadian friends and I’m still excited to get this lol.
---
i just came a little
---
You literally just said it beats the R4-C when it comes to TTK. Go back and read it.
---
Mute isn’t using shotty though
---
I think so too
---
Same
---
Does THunt really help that much?
---
With aiming or something?
---
thank you, i will let it on updated

I got a 2% alpha pack yesterday as well.... game didn't give me the pack until today

That’s kinda why I use valk. Gotta learn to aim for the head or you ain’t gonna kill shit. I went all out though and equipped red dot and silencer haha. Was a rough period...but man if I didn’t start hitting head shots. Mostly through anger lol. But finally hit plat this season because of better aim. But totally agree, he needs a better gun, but I feel like if he could move still it might be a little OP, seems like a hard thing to balance. Maybe while activated you could only move so much before stopping and recharging a bit? Idk.
---
I remember when we didn’t have alpha packs at all
---
RIP doge dog 😔
---
Ps4
---
W^O^W^!
---
As a Canadian I do think it is everything that a Canadian would need
---
I guess this is true however they need to start stop shoving down smokes SMG skins in everyones face
---
Seems to be a ps4 problem   It’s supposed to download the update only
---
Pretty sure it's because we threw a fit the only way to get Ash's elite skin was in the randomized outbreak packs.
---
4 a day if I’m lucky. Usually 3
---
If that was possible
---
Cool idea, but for now I think ubi should just concentrate on fixing the game
---
The bullets r shooting bullets
---
You can edit the flair on mobile, dunno about pc but I'd say you can as well.
---
Last time I got an alpha pack on 2% chance my friend got triggerd
---
What just happened?
---
Really big f*cking burns coming right up.
---
That last line made me laugh thanks
---
[Wow](https://youtu.be/zqTwOoElxBA)
---
Uh... No.
---
Umm how does this affect mouse at all
---
That looks so real though. How?

Hello Cobra07Kai, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c6an28/me/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
OwO
---
Mouse has had a sensitivity cap that stops crazy flicks on console
---
He was one of the best their force had ever seen. He will be missed....
---
I really don’t see much difference between playing R4-C with ACOG and without it
---
r/fuckyoukaren
---
Damn he got out-roasted
---
Thanks!
---
Nope it’s where I recommend you post this
---
Pewdiepie warden pewdiepie warden
---
Yaaaaaaay now I need to buy rainbow six on my pc and I will be all set
---
Ok f it caps mnk on console it also caps controller also there is no cap is how it use to be or the new way now the new turning thing and a cap version of the old one
---
Trust me bro
---
I find that it goes very nicely with the Leder skin
---
I adore Sam. There's just something so wholesome about her
---
Team coordination at it's best.
---
For me this is unsatisfactory as fuck as the smoke is the only one who left the armour
---
The hat even says “LOL”
---
Now I need that charm wow
---
Basically the game wont rotate as quick as a mouse will flick but they also made the controller rotate faster than it was previously
---
Most people in this sub are salty in general, I got -9 in my original comment in which I basically just said how here I'd have lost it.
---
Finka is great against cav(denying integrations) and her lmg with the boost is a killing machine, zofia is all rounded op both are great
---
I honestly wouldn’t want to get hit by one. They would hurt especially if it’s metal
---
On me
---
Dont ruin my satisfaction. Y u do dis
---
I’m so dead😂😂😂😂
---
nIce.
---
The game wont rotate quicker beyond a certain point for mnk and controller. Controller has been set so all sensitivities move a little quicker but not faster than the mnk highest setting obv
---
bad time to get back on rainbow lol
---
Yeah that’s the new setting if you go classic option it’s literally the same as before
---
I love democracy
---
Why so?
---
she would be so overpowered
---
I did math 0.07% chance
---
***HWOW!***
---
Is it weird that I like the mpx?
---
21 December irl cake day :D
---
Credit to u/SAU-Siege
---
Oh well that's the time I put in this game in a week. I just can't really play the same game for more than two hours in a row.
---
DDoSing
---
No, I personally think the fmg is good for nokk, rush In quietly quickly take everyone down.
---
Haha this literally happed to me yesterday. Good times.
---
And what’s with the ‘she’s silent whilst crawling and crouching’
---
It’s just crazy because I never had it happen before this week and had it happen like 3 times in the past week. And I have over 500 hours in the game (still trash though)
---
It's more in line with hero's of their country/origin/background.
---
Keeping it themed.
---
It really is but I find it quite funny.
---
You got ddos
---
I got an erection
---
Ha a beaver and hockey.
---
Feels bad
---
You are exactly the problem I want to tackle.
---
Well i under I have around 15 days on this game on console and I'm still only around plat 2. On pc I'm about the same rank but only have about 5 days played, console is definitely much harder especially with all the people with mouse and keyboard. And the Blackbeard thing you probably just haven't noticed till now.
---
I got a legendary yesterday and it was a skin for the Bailiff that literally looked like a bunch of shit. I have pics to prove it.
---
But you can buy a lot of packs and hope you get it
---
How do you get that much renown?
---
Send more fun facts please man
---
All those names except yours makes make cringe... typical mainstream tryhard names
---
Ya lucky decker hah, I haven’t got anything above common in the past 6 months I’d say, I’ve so many shitty gun skins I just don’t want
---
Hold the frick up
---
I am thinking two sheilds and I really like that idea
---
That’s personal opinion. I like to run red dot because it has a large view area and a precise reticle, but you might prefer reflex because it gives you more peripheral vision on the sides of the sight due to its smaller size. I personally have a hard time landing headshots with the triangle reticle. I suggest giving each sight a couple games and see which one works best for you.
---
It seems pretty arbitrary to say 5 stacks are not allowed but 3 and 4 stacks are ok. If your argument is "putting actual teams against solo players is unfair" then so are 4 stacks and probably 3 stacks as well if you want to get right down to it.
---
its also flawed to just assume that 5 stack = good.
---
I mean it's already dying in console.  There's a reason they scrapped all official leagues on the console.
---
It will be back on the next gen consoles though.
---
Nice! gj
---
That's it they're supposed to look like heroes hopefully they change their bio too, I wonder how Ash will look when she gets changed and Mute.
---
Wow.Did it really got you into copper iv from diamond?Thats fucked up
---
BMI science is a bunch of garbage.
---
Castle has cosmetics at all
---
Luckily it was only a bug but it scared tf out of me at first 😂
---
The entire server tho?
---
Luv u bb
---
Damn C4 Pulse? and actually use the scanner? no wayyyyyyyyyyy
---
This. 
---
3 round burst, no acog slower to refire then typical burst weapons.
---
Players are still rewarded for sneaking and getting the drop but they aren't outgunned by 99% of the defenders who also have the position advantage and gadget/equipment benefits.
---
Nice kill, but I think you meant Luck
---
This has been up for 4 hours and i have already seen it reposted on instagram
---
I'd smash.
---
Thats good to hear.
---
Karma
---
I have that duplicate 3 times
---
That is a form of DDoSing called server stressing, the asshole in question stresses the server untill the other team is kicked off
---
Lion is still very strong.  He isn't the overpowered oppressive operator he was before but is still very good.
---
I run vertical grip, reflex, and muzzle break
---
Damn
---
lol black ice glitch if you didn’t know
---
How?

---
I might be wrong but I think that's a stack of pancacks
---
This isn’t the glitch this is legit
---
Not really, the people who spawnpeak would still prefer Rook, Doc or Echo for that.  
---
Warden comes with zero team utility and can not revive himself when he gets into a DBNO State. So people would still use the old peakers above Warden.
---
There's obviously something different about cams and the actual player though. I'm taking a quote straight from Ubi, pretty sure it came from Twitter
---
I'd stay away from jackal. He gets banned 90% of the time.  He has a high pick and low win rate as well. He does have a great weapon along with smoke grenades and a shotgun secondary for breeching.
---
You just won't get to play him much :(
---
This community is toxic af

No not him, Jaeger. It took him a millennium to finally find out you were coming.
---
I respect his honesty
---
No

no they GSG9 resemble SEK not the KSK. you honestly don't think Rook resembles these guys at all?

or that the Spetsnaz don't look like like spetsnaz at all?

r/titlegore

Just like the holocaust
---
Et todellakaan...
---
I’d say by the end of the season.
---
If you got shot with a bullet, would you flinch?
---
Then that is a slight overestimate by my guess. I think she could be back with the depshield v2 about halfway through this season or apon release of next season. Interesting thing is she is back in thunt.
---
historical but what about lesion?
---
Has to be ranked
---
Is he good?
---
Dank you
---
Console?
---
I get a lot of kills though walls. A lot is instinct and some luck. But you are also missing the other teams communication. It can appear they are cheating.
---
Plus hacking on consoles isn't easy like pc and I would argue no exostent. Ddossing can happen though
---
use reflex as it’s the small sight. and you need to ADS.
---
When I see old videos with this I immediately think it's fucking possessed.....and then remember, that's how they used to be. 
---
Ah. When something so normal soon starts to look evil...
---
I think so. Although i do enjoy a good battleeyeTM video every once in a while.
---
yeah I mentioned bug, I didn't know it was that bad that it caused the game to lag but thanks for telling me. Ubisoft should fix this ASAP but then again what do I expect when Clash and deployable shields still aren't in the game after a month.
---
Nothing ends it like a vicious stab to the face
---
Jesus Christ it's Jason Bourne
---
The secret service carries p90s tho
---
He’d win, although he had no grenades left.

Lmfao

NoKKK
---
wow
---
Which gun?
---
Also you're a moron, jægerkorpset don't wear the nets, the Danish Frogmen do, jægerkorpset look like almost every other SF force in the world
---
Late night ranked I guess, I mean I've been diamond but I've seen plat 3s on my team since I was queuing at midnight so it just puts the closest mmr to reduce queue times from my experience. Whether it's intentional, I have no idea
---
its kind of like the g36 vs r-4c with ash, the g36 is not a bad gun, the r-4c is just better
---
Bit weird ngl.
---
Sorry i’m late
---
No bcuz im an epic gamer who takes bullets better than a trained soldier
---
So did I. But I'm a Hibana and Frost main
---
Skin was from outbreak last year
---
You are in the sunken place now
---
Lmao I’m new and only have like 4 cosmetics, none of which are common

Voodoo lady on red,  I repeat  Voodoo lady on red

I want that

---
&gt;complains about digital charms
---
*my pp hard*
---
I regularly place in low plat, he places mid tier plat by the end of the season.  
---
You can check my MMR if you want. Don't comment baseless bullshit.
---
Hacking is not possible on console. 
---
Only DDOSing is possible.
---
You probably died to 3 speeds and got caught lacking so they droned you out and wallbanged you
---
Bernie is a mad lad for holding that angle without his turret shield
---
Cav
---
Are you on the same platform? You should wait until he queues and then try to get in his game. Then send him creepy messages.
---
Complete waste of dev time and an operator space.
---
My friend bought them off Amazon, he got an Ash emblem for himself
---
No, Teal is Plat now, Purple is Diamond
---
Hold up does your shit zoom when you ads?
---
I envy you so much. I don’t play Rook or Doc super often, but when I do I love playing as them. and I play buck all the time. he is technically my second main, behind thatcher
---
I trust, that this ceramic trauma plate that I’m wearing? Will protect me from a three-fifty-seven magnum round traveling at 490 meters per second.
---
God that's awful. Here in Spain we cannot buy beer past 10pm (from a store). It's just plain stupid and if you dont plan everything beforehand it ruins your night.
---
They're op as shit as well.
---

---
Part of me says yes and no, because aesthetically they look nice especially the marble ones on bank. But from a balance perspective it seems necessary as too many kills on railing are either from pixel peeks (which I'm fine with) or pure luck.
---
At least you have a fiance.
---
\#alone4ever
---
Why tho, plenty of other games have fov sliders
---
If you search up my username “epicfail40o800” I’m r6 tracker you can see I’ve been a steady silver but it’s been a bad week
---
I see echo / lesion banned more for defenders, and ying/jackal for attackers. 
---
But hey I'm copper 4
---
You could also get away with angled grip and flash hider since the flashhider is small and the angled grip dosnt change the look of the grip much at a distance
---
Being able to warm up with all operators on attack would benefit them aswell
---
Doc and rook s tier
---
And I’m trying to say ur not good
---
No beer past 10? Damn, who tf came up with that policy :D
---
Maybe they were in a party with one of the other plat players / queuing up together?
---
Honestly have no idea just throwing out ideas lol
---
That's not what an acronym is. RAM, NASA, NATO. These are all acronyms, the abbreviation is formed from the first letter of each word in the name, but is pronounced as a word, rather than by its individual letters, which would be an initialism (BBC, FBI, CIA).
