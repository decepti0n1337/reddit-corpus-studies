What is ERROR CODE (CE-34719-4)? I always get that every time I try to share stuff
---
---
---
Diamond on console = random playstyle +good aim // the only think in console that's hard to be consistent w is ur aim.
---
oh fuck off noodle, this isn't the first u got so lucky, like last night
---
Why isn't the escape key blitz, when I see blitz the only thing I think to do is escape
---
Nah, that map is actually enjoyable, even if it is biased af
---
we kinda already have lava from the y4 pass
---
Nice
---
Really? I haven't seen it do you have a link?
---
What the fuck happened here
---
you're lucky Jackal didn't blow your head off
---
I've heard this is the reason that capitao got the new gridlock acog.
---
I’m not sure, i normally just send it to a friend and save using the PS messages app, then upload,
---
Maybe a bad connection?
---
Yup
---
Yeah...
---
It’s been like that for a while. I learned about it pretty easy from watching serenity get so many aces and clutches because of it.
---
Maybe...I don't know...ADS? Or even, sounds crazy, use your smg?
---
Maybe better aim?
---
Tight angles are too, you see nothing from the inside but the attackers can see you perfectly
---
Let’s all agree that the future nerf to Maestro is too much
---
Rather have Jager and Bandit get their acogs back.

My guess is the server glitched out, and thought the 3d model was holding an impact grenade. And the server dropped it when you got the kill. Just a annoying glitch
---
Casual has never made sense to me honestly. Needs a reboot.
---
or just...aim better?
---
Wow, rollercoaster of emotions!!
---
"Goooooood evening"
---
Disagree to be honest, I think IQ is in a good spot.
---
Coconutbrah’s videos are good, but a lot of those are very situational, or only used for sound, etc...definitely worth a watch though.
---
But some general tips are:
---
Put them watching the areas around sites, especially on walls that have been reinforced.
---
You don’t always need/want on on the site, as it will only be useful for a retake of site.
---
Bomb is one of the few modes where a cam on site can be useful as there is two sites to watch. Using your Deagle to open a soft wall between sites is a good place to put them, so it watches both sites.
---
Sticking them low to the ground, like on the underside of a table can make them hard to spot.
---
Opening a window in prep phase, throwing a cam outside the second the round starts, then boarding back up. Can give you great view of common rappelling areas or exterior walls to site, like many of the garage sites. And can be used for run outs and C4 kills on them.
---
Haha I know right
---
Oh, yeah definitely but I just meant now having a bigger player base and the desire to be the "coolest" or whatever, all feeds into the lack of care for OBJ while the selfish gameplay style has been more common.
---
i hope this is doable on console, but knowing these spots, it probably isn't
---
IQ is one of the only operators in the game that is perfectly balanced at the moment. Just leave her where she is.
---
I'm about 50/50 on reflex and holo. Some guns I just do better with one than the other. Reflex on Jager, holo on Ash, reflex on Twitch, holo on Mute. It's a weird circumstance.
---
You know it boy
---
Ads and predict where its going.
---
Fair enough
---
Are you lost sir?
---
Be easier to drone and buck above or go top floor and shoot down for safety I think, you save a nade which can be used elsewhere, but still it's a neat trick and good knowledge

Not really, most DLC operators, while fun, aren't exactly useful all the time and you might find that most teams only consist of 1 or 2 DLC operators. The original operators are really powerful and useful!
---
"Esports ready"
---
Looks like getiting stuned w/ a flash inCOD
---
I mean a legendary are so rare and for it to come out with this
---
Or instead of wasting time to line up and waste 2 nades you could just go above and buck the floor. If you die to a roamer that's your fault for not clearing them out.
---
Every time I see one of these, I just scream in my mind "DONT GO NEAR IT, DONT GO NEAR IT, STOP, STOP!!!" And usually see them die as soon as they interact with it. Surprised it let you pick it up.
---
That's what a Russian bot would say!
---
theoretically, but she does seem to run a bit faster than other 3 speeds
---
Nope a 3k because of valk
---
I usually put holo on everything that can’t have an acog, and reflex on everything that can’t have a holo.
---
Or buy the cheap crap.
---
**ゴ ゴ ゴ ゴ**
---
Like the buttons, joysticks and the red near the Xbox button but the skin itself around the controller kinda feels eh. It'd be better with a more simple design of little red crows on a black background near the side of the controller. Thoughts???
---
Best tips....practice
---
As someone who has purchased the steam version to only refund it as it was really stupid. Yes if you buy on steam first then buy on uplay you’ll have two accounts which requires TWO different game installs which is well over 100gb of storage space taken up. 
---
So to my suggestion if you have it on steam already and want another account make another steam account and buy there. Or if you’re still within refund range. Refund on steam and buy everything via uplay.
---
What the hell is he actually wearing tho???
---
I only really get angry when the greed leads to dumb shit, 2 people were dropping down a hatch at me but I had the kapkan shotty so they were dead before they hit the floor but my team mate still threw and detonated a c4 at my feet.
---
Would still break the game. His 1911 is fucking good.
---
Dam that dude got so owned!
---
yeah but ubisoft keep patching routes to get up apparently, so it appears it's not supposed to intentional or it's maybe not balanced?
---
Hahahhahahah
---
Heeeeeeere's white mask!
---
I would fucking love a 10v10 game mode with a map 2x the size of regular maps.
---
She really doesn't need it.
---
Well, we know what game won’t be a good contender over at r/hitboxporn
---
Right ?? Thats what I wanna know
---
is this a jayjay's wacky trip reference
---
lol wtf i dont ser maverick anywhere
---
Hell yeah, rep siege on the inferior COD ;)
---
Oh look he deleted his comment. It's almost as if I knew he was full of shit and called him out. Funny how that works.
---
Holo Ash &gt; ACOG Ash
---
or it was unrelated to the change and pretending that stats are static especially when looking overall at all players (which 90% of are terrible) is dangerous for the game.
---
more like lion is trash now
---
He could reasonably maneuver with the sprint buff, but wasn’t oppressive with the rush down. He also had better hipfire for midrange pressure, and a longer range flash to punish those who got too close to you
---
Then damn youre terrible, what rank and level are you?
---
No I know I'm an asshole. I didn't do it to be an asshole, I did it to correct him so he could fix it. It just came off like that because I'm an asshole.
---
That's Awesome, never seen that happen before
---
This is the #1 ranked gloably for ps4, I know there isn't technically hacking on ps4 but this still seems ridiculously suspicious.. Nearly 10k elo, un heard of besides PC cheaters, and he's 181-0 this season..... And only 1 abandon so hes not abusing that for a good win loss like alot do.
---
A 5 stack of the best pros in the world dont even do anywhere near this good, this seems extremely suspicious imo.
---
Now you have a Finka main comment
---
the ultimate showdown
---
Ela's gun is fine. It just has a really steep learning curve but once you get it, it's a fucking monster
---
If you think I whine everytime I die and blame it on hackers, i dont. After 1300 hours on siege, this is the first time I've thought someone was genuinely hacking. Even the very least smurfing since the two guys were lvl 30 and 10. I believe they were hacking still.
---
No, Milan is May 18-19, The new season will be officially revealed there. We may get a teaser on the 16th but don’t get your hopes up. You should consider gathering your information from more reliable sources
---
Don't be copper then lol
---
Pretty much capitaos leak
---
every night I can feel my leg, my arm, even my fingers.
---
Yes, protect these poor guy, what a victim
---
Well, i can control it, but beyond 8-10 meters, i just can’t do anything consistent. It stupid argument that Ela should only be strong at CQB and “have enough bullets to kill multiple opponents”.
---
Buff her gadget, nerf her gun.
---
how do you know if it’s ranked or not?
---
When mom says the pizza rolls are done
---
You can’t do anything reasonable beyond 8-10 meters. This is stupid.
---
I thought I was reverse fire was fully tested and ready with the new update.
---
Ash with holographic is amazing
---
Portal op when?
---
Like mira and tachanka, 1 speed 3 armor. Mira doesnt need it tho, tachanka needs a rework.
---
Call up buck tell him I need some of him in this comment section too
---
This idea makes much more sense as a defender gadget rather than attacker anyway.
---
Doesn't matter what he did. Don't be a dick. Don't insite this behavior. Smurfing isn't bannable to my knowledge so you aren't looking for Ubi support, you're just being a low life
---
They never will
---
Sadly I don’t know any Buck mains
---
I potato like that all the time. Also I've been the person not to even notice the enemy standing right next to me unexpectedly
---
Yup. Sorry it wasn't included in the patchnotes for 1.3 but it is confirmed that this is fixed now - sorry about the wait!
---
you just fucking reposted this shit
---
Now the real question, should it work that way?
---
It would say match point under it if it was a casual
---
Casual would say match point when someone has 2 round wins since it is win by 3.

It’s really up to personal preference. If you have the time, try out different combinations in T Hunt and see which one you like best. If you don’t have the time, good luck
---
Yes her gun excels in CQB. But really, what's wrong with that? Not every gun is good at long range, you can still one tap enemies from a far, it just isn't suited to doing that
---
oh that makes sense, thanks!

Nah I don’t mean it like that I know this is a team game that’s beyond obvious. I’m ranting because let’s be honest if you’re going to be in a clan you’re a puss puss for playing casual it’s a waste of time. No one is casual communicates and it’s easy to get at least one ace per day in casual if you really want to try by yourself. The clans are 4 stacking and just bullying the casual kids with ranked tactics and rounds barely last a minute to a minute and half at most. It’s just sad that they’re that bad  enjoy going into casual still, not trying to talk shit but I’ve noticed their KDs and WL are normally bellow 1.0

How did that grenade come back? Did you lag or something?

---
Not if you give the defenders the option to retract it and extend it at will.
---
On todays episode of rank means nothing
---
Twitch:
---
Lose ACOG in F2
---
Give her 3 drones with 4 shocks each (which means 12 overall instead of 10, not a huge buff in the amnt of gadgets destroyed, this buff is just to give her more versatility with drone deployment)
---
Capitao: 
---
We need to sit on his new rework for a bit, i havent played it enough to know if it needs nerfing
---
Jackal: 
---
i personally think hes balanced, but just to counter your point
---
reduce scans to 4
---
make him able to scan footprints faster/longer distance away, either one
---
keep distortion effect when shot
---
Maverick: 
---
i disagree with your nerf suggestion, instead, i suggest they fix the 'Maverick glitch' where he can open up an entire wall with 2 lines across the top and bottom, it breaks some objectives
---
Nomad: 
---
Decrease AoE, but enable her to PICK UP her airjabs, so if the placement is slightly off, she can pick it up and try again, and sure, buff her guns, they suck
---
Smoke: i agree with you, im not a math guy so idc about the weapon stat changes, but the change to his smokes is a MUST
---
Castle: 
---
sure, i guess thats one way of doing it, ive seen other ideas i like better, like, i think hed be great if you just
---
give him a third primary option, preferably something with a fast fire rate
---
allow his barricades to be electrified by Bandit and Kaid (still allow him to put the barricades on doors, also, these can still be breached by other means, not just Hard breachers like you suggest)
---
cool thing about this change, using Bandit on it is practically useless (they can be shot under the door) so, while Bandit CAN electrify the barricades, the preferred electrifying method is Kaid, little buff to him, and not quite a buff to Bandit, bc he doesnt really need one IMO
---
Echo: 
---
i dont think this is necessary lol
---
Lesion:
---
i dont think this is necessary, if you do NEED to decrease them, start with 7 first, then 6 if needed, but im like 80% sure theyve already increased and decreased how many Gu's Lesion has multiple times now, so i think theyve got his Gu at the right number
---
Kaid:
---
increase Rtilla AoE by 3%
---
give him a 3rd Electroclaw
---
Decrease RANGE of the Shotgun, basically, give it a somewhat drastic damage dropoff at a certain distance, basically just nerf the shotgun a bit to balance out the extra Claw
---
Thats no bueno
---
I love how everyone is ignoring that there's only 4 options for sights on a AAA title 3 years after release and 3 of those are the same magnification. Add more sights please, and then balance around that fact, which would make everyone way more comfortable and mitigates the absurdity that is being forced to use a 1x sight on a rifle.
---
Why am I not surprised the Ash main hates shield ops?
---
Yes i just finally decided to post it after seeing another accidental kill lol
---
There’s no sport without sportsmanship

No

Yo how do I get the fnatic fan flair

I was playing siege with some friends and went to shoot a cam and shot someone. I thought it was a teamate, but then realised it wasn't. I had even apologized to my team before im like, wait thats mute.
---
No I get that he saw me, but the replay is always funny to watch when it looks like that

What Ela’s role now? And what she can do better than Jager? You can’t roam without nades. You don’t have a reliable weapon for some sort of range. You have a good ability, but which stuns yourself and your teammates if you/they are near. triggered mine. Thus you or teammates can’t wait for enemies near the doorways with your mine placed above. Trap operator with intel? Lesion is much better.
---
You see, Ela isn’t as impactful as Jager. I don’t see real reasons to pick her over other 3 speeds who are even non Jager. I can’t even tell in which aspect Ela is better than Lesion, apart from she being 3 speed and he isnt.......
---
Noice

lol I’m done.

Good artwork but keep that weeb shit out of here
---
Well its the fact that hes SO loud you always know hes coming and ur always aware what he can do.\*  
---
With that being said just run for a bit till you lose him or you can turn on him and knife him and spray him down  
---
but if you get flashed by him just spam knife and spray it usually works.
---
Hahah that's never happened to me
---
yeah... didnt think about the 3 armors....
---
Lol so what part of this game is actually realistic to you? The wall hacking heart beat scanner. The large metal walls you carry in your pocket? A visor that lets you know where exactly someone is because of a foot print they left 3 floors below? Holograms that mark a targets location when shot? Getting shot 3 times in the chest with a pistol then running around leaping over desks, This game isn’t realistic 🤷🏻‍♀️ running up a tarp is more realistic than any of those.
---
It enhances the gameplay experience of course
---
Wrong. Shit players dropped her leaving Ash mains truly dedicated to the character increase her winrate.
---
Lol that’s just how this game works son.
---
The community broke it
---
&gt;This magic did not apply to operator gadgets
---
Tacther and pulse are part of the core roster. 
---
Also when people say
---
&gt; siege was never meant to be realistic
---
They are most of the time replying to people using the bullet calibres, operator styles and the equipment. which is picking and and choosing parts of the game they want as realistic  while ignoring a lot of the gameplay which is extremely unrealistic from the start.
---
If you want the genuine ranked system, here it is. Siege has skill ranks leveled 1-20. 1 is copper 4, 20 is diamond. When you matchmake it takes all the skill ranks and adds them up, then divides by the amount of people in your queue. For example, if you are queuing with a silver 4(SR 9), a gold 2 (SR 15), and a copper 3 (SR 2). It adds 9+15+2=26. Then divide 26 by three (amt of players). That would average an 8/9 lobby(bronze 1/silver 4)
---
The MP5 variants and all guns in siege exist in some form irl. The MP5K isn't the "exact same" as the MP5 that GIGN uses.
---
Be nice.
---
That’s not a haiku.
---

I’d buy this...

are we going to ignore the fact that the identity of these players is protected by a picture of a red pepper.

Funny thing I can still use her with the G36 and acog works for me shit

does anyone have the link to the frost version? lmao i lost it

watched this about 30 times before i noticed the drones

very good

1060 is like the main card to do most games 1080p 60fps, you're good.

What if ubisoft sees this post and want to use it but they don’t because they didn’t come up with the idea. I believe that someone in the community has to stand up and make this site that you propose.
---
I wanna see "Athena" for a female operator make it and "Python" for a guy, "Recon" for a male operator would be cool as well as "Decoy"

Hello wcurl8, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/behqf6/support_mode_glitchor_new_operator_function/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Your ears are hardly ever going to be equidistant from the source of the sound.  Any difference between your ears and the source can be used to determine it's location.  Your notice that sound coming from the stairwell would be accurate if there was an effect added to the sound reflecting the fact that it not only had to travel the extra distance but suffered degredation due to the sound dispersion.  However, no such effect is even remotely added making the sound undecernable in specific situations.  Not sure about you, but when people on my 2nd floor and in my basement make noise it's blatantly apparent that the sound is not coming from directly next to me.
---
Yea but why, someone on here already explained why the realism argument is 100% redundant in a game like siege.
---
Lol this happened to me too one time when the puck somehow clipped through an indestructible wall and killed me :/
---
I also spotted Lord Tachanka in the background at some point
---
If they did implement it I could predictably see a change in how people play and their emotional stability in game. I know that I would already have earned it, but it would be nice to have an incentive to be better and play better with your team.
---
✌️🤝☝️👈 Unbalanced style: thermal scope jutsu

oh yeah i totally agree
---
Correct. It's also a simulation because, iirc, Tom Clancy has certain terms when he licenses out his franchises. One of much is you cannot play as a terrorist, but also you cannot have real friendly-on-friendly combat. So that's part of the reason it's a simulation, the game doesn't really say so. It's just the lore.

I still think there is a factor affecting the pick rates significantly due to daily challenges. Every week there is a Win 8 games with certain CTU challenge.
---
And GIGN, FBI, GSG9, SAS all have high pick rates except Spetsnaz, may be they are just too slow and mediocre.
---
Can u explain me why I am terrible? The only thing I said was I don't like semi automatic weapons. U keep insulting me and have the need of telling me how bad iam. U don't read my comments and just keep writing bullshit. Pls tell me why exactly am I bad only because I don't like a certain weapon?

I also don't like blitz and lion so iam bad right?

Even though u can't tell me why iam bad eventually we can come back to ur of post? I said u have a lot more arguments so give them to me?

maestro cams now open half of their window when jammed (emp'd/tased). Which means you could chain two tases and blow his cam up.

Of course! Now i get it!

It was almost me though. But funny how it works. Not as bad as the time i knife a wall and got a kill. I got a how message with a 😔. They didnt reinforce all the walls well I was going to use it. But he was the last alive.

More maps pls. Ranked is stale af.
---
I like it
---
but imo those sights are total shit. the holo take sup to much space for noting and the little red dot has a weird triangle.
---
No Mr. Potato, the reason Ubi changed the face to look more like a woman is because the old one was messed up and looked like a man.
---
Then again, ignorance is bliss, so I believe you.

Very cool! Do more

His estate could uphold the conditions, as well as anything in his will.

Have they capped their frames? Using vsync?

---
I'm still inexperienced in this game, maybe it's obvious but why?
---
+1, lion was pretty op before with a good team but hes soo fkn shit now, reworking his ability was soo dumb, shouldve kept outline scan, and just messed around with the timings and lengths of scand and stuff, hes now a shittier jackal with worse guns
---
The rights are still held by Ubisoft, they can do whatever they want.

Yea, I have a 144hz monitor and i use 1 frame vsync

This season has been extremely frustrating, I usually place mid gold but this season I've been stuck in low silver/high bronze because of team killers and people leaving as the match starts, it usually helps when I play with 1 or 2 friends but it's still not great, what's shit is that I also keep getting unbalanced maps like skyscraper, I can't even imagine your frustration at a higher rank

This is exactly what I think to. Heshould be played as a support op and the flash is there for if someone gets close to blitz, not blitz getting close to someone.

Dokkaebi is useless on PS4 right now because of her trash weapons thanks to the ridiculous SMG nerf
---
I feel like they should nerf his cooldown or else he'll become an must-have post-plant op again
---
Yea no.
---
He is still an operator with a global utility. No skill involved to use, still strong in competitive and coordinated teams.
---
Maybe once you get out of bronze casual, you will understand.
---
welcome to the club my guy
---
There in different terminal ports. That’s why you see a ladder in one and a wall in the other.
---
I’m on PS4 &amp; ~70% of players have MnK at this tier. I’m also on the West US so if I wanna play ranked in the morning and afternoon it’s ping abusing Japanese players or sweaty MnK macros in the evening and very late evening. Still frustrating even though I have mastered the 100 sensitivity controller because my extreme skill is basically being cheesed by some 20 year old man child who can’t afford an actual PC because his mother won’t give him the money.
---
Ubisoft can’t stop them because adapter companies like XIM would just patch over patches &amp; it would be a cat n mouse game. It’s really unfortunate.
---
The report toxic behavior button is a complete joke on console. We need an Op. Health 2 to dedicate time to implementing much needed features like a proper report system. I’d rather wait three months to fix the game &amp; bring quality of life improvements then get a dedicated season.
---
Mark this NSFW, quick! The building is naked!
---
Well they kinda did!
---
**zehr gut**
---
Lol coming from an Esports fan what a surprise.. Fucking wetwipe
---
There's not a whole lot of them, but there are a few angles I've seen in the proleague that are two floor/wall angles.
---
Acog lowkey required tho
---
I believe he’s in evaluation period. And will probably be unbanned after the next pro league lan. If not then, then most likely the next season.
---
I like the idea. If i does come to the gane, im probably gonna have a high tk rate because they'll be about to go fast af boi
---
I was expecting something to happen since this has been known forever. So confused.
---
Didn't make it to hot :(
---
Not really mate. But i am seeing a very big decrease in player numbers and people interest in the game. I wonder why ubi, i really do.
---
Are we all just gonna ignore that guys user name for a second?
---
Should the game be balanced around casual console players or the lowest skill-level? Or rather around the playerbase that has the most experience/play-time and is exposed the most to the public?
---
1 He plays on PC which inherently makes recoil easier to control
---
2 He has perfected the sensitivity he plays on to help him control recoil very easily
---
Well it was just a few of us dicking around in casual
---
But why m8 every op u mentioned is still viable and useful so pls go away
---
Balancing is important but removing items to restrict load outs isn’t good balancing
---
This is not a meme.
---
A good read.
---
The other team will lock there selves in kids if it’s reinforced
---
This is so true it's not even funny.
---
Wheelbarrow DP-28 wheeled up and loaded

If it says it has all the ops from y1 to y4, then everything is included. Dlcs will always be free! New ops with each season can be unlocked by playing the game and earning ingame currency.
---
Congrats!
---
All the Operators and i think all the Others benefits from season pass but ist dosen't contain all cosmetics ever releases, that would ne silly
---
Just pick up a friend or two and you’ll be fine. The worst that can happen then is probably just a thrower every few games.
---
I don’t see drugs...
---
You get the game and all operators in year 1-3 and the year 4 pass which will give you the 8 operators for this year and some other small benefits
---
I would have had I not already lost all hope

Yeahhhh

I'm just wondering if he's the same guy who said "fuck the sleeves" and is doing a one arm curl from the window, looking to be throwing something into it
---
yeah what happened to this guy?
---
I've played it but I never realized it related to seige until I played seige
---
I think he quit YouTube/twitch because of depression
---
Id love them to release a defender named tumblr, who's gender fluid.  When everyone rushes obj, you hit your ability. Which is a safe space which stretches out in a 8m diameter whilst you scream like a banshee which disorients the attackers. Especially the white one, has a 1/3 chance to down white or male operators.

Lions gadget suddenly becomes balanced and everyone rags on it. If you move ONCE pre patch you instantly get your entire position known by the entire enemy team. If you think that's balanced i worry for you

&gt;mediocre gadget
---
aaand i stopped reading, this is already getting stupid
---
lets get this post to the front page
---
M8 as long the Pro league shows is he is op he is for sure ur just to bad sry but that's the truth.
---
Iam also had problems using him but he is just broken and the new lion will be way better
---
Playing dead when there's clearly 5 alive on the icons. Ok.
---
Through walls right ? otherwise doc , rook and Italian ops pick rate will skyrocket
---
Not a clue
---
It’s now mediocre with the new nerf, the entire point of the wall of text I wrote
---
Through walls only
---
I’m not complaining, infact I’m on lions side, you obviously didn’t read the entire thing
---
what?
---
You don't get it do you?

Hopefully you'll encounter them less my dude!

I see the Dementors got a job after hairy potter.

tbh smg12 is not that hard to control, try bearing-9, it is impossible to me but definitely not smg12
---
Played with  bounssi.ence while playing tts casual.He would run our every round with ela pistol destroying us again and again.Also played with a ex console pro when i was on Xbox  whos name i forgot, his aim was honestly gold console level.
---
Exactly, for defenders a lot of your job is slowing the attackers and making them waste utility.
---
Well, my main is sledge, and I got black ice for him in an alpha pack, but the thing was I didn’t get it for his assault rifle or his shotgun. No no . I got it for his P22 Mk 25 (his pistol ) 
---
Mega RIP for me
---
but then they move away from that spot knowing someone is above them
---
&gt; Ever since that nerf to lion in Parabellum I believe, lion’s pick rate dropped a lot, and that should have been it. An operator with an above average gun with a mediocre gadget.
---
You did not imply that the mediocre refers to his current state, rather to the first small nerf months back.
---
Fuckin spawnpeeked
---
How do jackal and ela need to be fixed exactly?
---
I got it for a pistol :(
---
*sweats*
---
rip

There was a leak that said she looks cute but it is more realistic to get something like the picture shows us. ND that's far from cute
---
So essentially some rooms it would be impossible to enter without a hard breacher
---
Vote to kick 7/4
---
I like lions state right now. It's fun to play him and not that toxic anymore.
---
No ur saying he shouldn't be this way because he was already weak and they killed his intentionally design and I say he was op
---
with my experience its still strong because now you have no time to prepare for the scan it happens so fast.
---
That smoke germane saved him.
---
You can't see Jager laughing his ass off behind all those masks.
---
Also IQ's absolute whiff trying to take the cam down from two feet away while it's shooting her
---
Why did they make the plane the American Presidential plane then?
---
I think every op will be able to rappel up the hatch, like everyone attacking operator has fucking grappling hook, didn't you realise?

And blitz + lion = umm f you romer maby add sum jackal and yr so f ohhh drones too yeah seen that kinda combo used on me many times can't move cuz wallbang. Yeah maby low truskill mmr lion ez. Uuf I forgot dokka. Bzzzz. Bauhhhhh. Doink jackal scan yeah I love this hmm. Yeah scanned from sky yeah boiiiiiiijuu

Using same its better than vertical + comp
---
Bandit gave blitz drugs.
---
For consistency tbh i think it should be no 1 shot headshots ever or all the time, and in siege imo having them all the time is the way to do it
---
I think it can be a game changer on certain objectives. Oregon is a Map that Capitao is going to be really strong on.
---
Wall Jax gone wrong
---
Oh right Mb missed that completely Yh Idk what’s happened then to get a headshot on an injure
---
Did... did you just call outback trash? Smol boi mozzie will no longer lend you his drones.
---
I prefer mozzie over nomad tbh. C4 and good guns with no recoil is fun
---
Agreed
---
What do you mean?
---
I would be screaming for them to break the barricade
---
This is not somthing that should be changed, to change this mechanic now after over 3 years would have a good chance to kill the game.
---
Eesh more or less a trace it’s incredible similar to ela art posted a while ago
---
From the leaks the ops are gonna be Danish and American, even if the leaks are untrue why would we get Australian ops right after a season about Australian ops?
---
Did he marry Belle Delphine yet?
---
I always get my friend to do it so i dont die
---
Thing is soo ugly but it supports his lore its called a Pakol and apparently is very popular in the middle east, where he was missing so he must have picked one up when he was missing
---
It’s still strong in short range fights, you can’t just use it as your primary anymore.
---
That flick man. REPORT!!!!!
---
Nomad just got a huge nerf so get mozzie
---
What other maps are like that?
---
I use Mav and maestro almost exclusively unless someone else takes them, both very solid ops, love them both
---
Next playable character: Mr. Bear, Special ability: kick fuze's ass
---
That would be a lot of work for something that doesn't really need changing, I agree that it would be cool though.
---
https://i.imgur.com/it6Rpj8.png here's our answer, folks
---
Black Ice is my favorite skin. On the MP5, i take the Black Ice skin over a legendary skin i have for the MP5
---
Makes sense, but I would’ve just kept it as a souvenir, not wear the damn thing. I do imagine he might’ve got it from a friend he made so that’s why he wears it.
---
I mean if Mozzie isn't around and you need to put up traps sneakily then killing a drone or two is permissible.
---
U have 29fps so no.
---
Mate you can keep ya drones down under eh
---
Wdym that’s Tuxbird’s son
---
I think it’s cause it is a reference to where the map is based off of
---
I have those lol
---

The spirit of rainbow is magic
---
lol I will still count it as a whoosh

Rainbow rainbow
---
Off the top of my head. I know plane. There have been a couple high profile special ops raids on hijacked planes. Then the map set in the embassy may beba reference to the raid that made S.A.S a house hold name.
---
Or a cav elite skin is coming.
---
Go fook spoiders ya cunt
---
I have a higher in game sends but much lower DPI
---
Flash hider and angled grip have the best recoil pattern, and is somewhat easy to control. If you like the compensator better than that’s fine.
---
Actually Rainbow
---
As a plat who mains doc i take offence
---
I play at 80 brightness and this seems so dark lol
---
r/ExpectedThanos
---
They both are
---
It gets worse.. You can see Mira's outline putting the other one on a soft wall facing tunnel
---
Yes that was a very good change. It helps add another ability to an operator that doesn’t get picked often enough.
---
Entirely deserved. I’d like to believe it’s just the language barrier, but if I remember correctly you’ve had some pretty rude responses to people on here.
---
I hope you put one in Mira’s noggin
---
Internet Explorer user
---
Highly doubt it. Pros asked for him in this state, but in a coordinated squad, he can waste 4 full seconds (assuming one goes for pre plant) of the defenders' retake, and THAT, my brothers and sisters, is very powerful.
---
No this. A repost and if please don’t wooosh me
---
Use the shotgun
---
Yo shizzle, teamwork makes the dream work, don’t forget to place down that rook armor
---
So why are we arguing then?
---
Vert grip is the best for recoil control, as it decreases the random recoil by 25%
---
Compensator decreases the same around 13%
---
They are the best for flat recoil reduction, sadly. 
---
The scorpion just has crazy recoil in general in long bursts
---
Siege isn't on Xbox 360 or ps3 though. Different generation of consoles..
---
People don’t always remember
---
I would get mad at the player for not shooting the feet but I can't get mad because I would most likely do the same thing

As a prolific modder I really hope you're kidding here.
---
The difference between modding 360/Ps3 and XBone/Ps4 is night and day.
---
It was not only possible on last gen, but insanely easy, my little sister could do basic stuff. Current gen consoles are locked down hard; They're sandboxed, making it almost impossible to do the same kind of modding, and *actually* impossible to do so and continue playing online.
---
Appreciate the feedback, definitely helped me 🤙
---
Yes please
---
I think there are a few changes that could be made but he went from god himself to just a little powerful.

Cool. Nice chat. 'Night and GLHF.
---
Didn’t even know that was possible
---
or we can just leave the game as is
---
Tried going around some forums to search for some people to play with? A few other peeps would be a whole lotta better
---
&gt;!r/whoosh !&lt;
---
I'll be maining him and cap this season to test it out. They did say it was "first of the changes", but I sure do hope they take away 1 scan and vigil's immunity.
---
It's adorable how this thread got confused so quickly. He replied to the wrong person, so you're replying to him as if he's saying it's hacking when he's saying the opposite.
---
There are also newspapers on the floor of the press section from Fort Worth, Texas

Yeah, but it's cool to know if you want to do it accurately
---
Wtf? The only one confused here is you
---
new meta
---
Yes there is
---
Maestro have been nerfed
---
Bu il give pros and cons of both
---
Maestro. Harasser, LMG,Anchor ( could be used for lurking), intelligence, only you can control when to fire the turret
---
You do 5 damage for 20 bursts and could be lethal at low health
---
Cons
---
Twitch can now open the visor after tazing it and destroy it ( also Thatcher) 
---
Sledge,IQ,Zofia,Ash,explosives
---
only us high class individuals use the ghost recon skin
---
You don't know what you're talking about. OP said it's not hackers, so why would he now be saying it is?
---
Not only corpses, but barricades. It’s infuriating to punch one out only to have the debris just stay in the same place. Turns a quick break, peek, and shoot into two hits, and by then you might as well just not even go for it cause they’ve heard you.
---
Buck has no recoil wym... At least for every one and me that I see in top 25 diamond elo
---
Not bad, but I’ve seen better
---
Leder wins imo
---
Bank is most likely linked to the actual Rainbow Six novel. Very early in the story, one of the R6 teams are deployed to a hostage situation at a large bank. Not long after there is another incident and a large house in the country that happens to have a helipad and I can only infer a possible nod to Chalet
---
X box is gay that’s why
---
I kinda enjoy the rework. Feels like the original lion, having 3 scans but instead of the full body scan just a ping. Feels nicer to play against, and nicer to play as imo.
---
ok, the pistol is decent, I won't disagree with you
---
Iq counters herself though? she's a decent op who counters a good number of ops
---
Yeah, impacts shouldn't be given to her again, probably not Nitro, so maybe the bullet-proof cam?
---
look, I play the game for fun, so I took your final comments with a grain of salt, fyi, her gadget is decent, however, compared to Nomad, who's gadget actually Knocked you back, thus nearly making it impossible to play defense whenever she's picked, unless Jaeger's picked. She was nerfed with the much-needed audio cue for her gadget; all her gadget does is just does a little stun, also, Finka counters her with her gadget.
---
overall, you have a singular good point from what I can gather, a confusing statement about IQ, changed my mind on impacts/nitros for her, but the last part, I disagree with fully.
---
It would be like insurgency sandstorm
---
I mean...I’d buy an ISAC announcer off the bat.
---
If your on pc you can open U play, click your profile in the top right, offline mode, then open r6 you will hav all ops but will only be able to play custom games (mayb thunt Idk) but you can try out the ops weapons see if you like 1 more than the other. But for my opinion i think mozzie is the better opinion but Idk anything. But I wouldn't spemd my renown on either of those.
---
Lol he’s always had those pistols for some weird reason.
---
Nice to have this put out in a more official manner but it's pretty dumb that it took them several years to do so. Especially when the dev or one of the devs who helped design the system but up post explaining this near the release of the game under his own account
---
Same problem here. When solo queuing it takes the piss but games are found easily with a squad
---
Jackal is really good so my votes on him
---
You just gonna whip out your diamond dick on me like that?
---
I'm pretty sure 6 in the situations version of this map says its Stanstead Airport?
---
Reminds me of MW2 challenge lobbies when stuff would pop up out of no where telling you to fuck off
---
I say Jackal, while I think Maestro is one of the strongest operators, I personally don’t like his (or Echo’s) playstyle. And Jackal has one of the best aguns in the game. Then Maestro has the best defender gun. But again it comes down to play style.
---
How tho?
---
Yeah, it's nice to have clarification rather than just everyone's combined and conflicting information
---
I said to give me proof that there are hackers on console then OP replied with "there are, just look at the screenshot"
---
do you run CAMRS or C8-SFW?
---
Epic gamer moment.
---
Don’t ask me why but my brain read that as IASIP and now I really want Danny Devito as an announcer
---
First sentence was accurate
---
You were playing casual. That’s why you lived ha
---
I'd be okay with them selling things like this. Announcer packs, hud packs, mvp animations.
---
...why?
---
Honestly it needs to be added. 
---
Also in ESL games (PL, CL, GO4 etc.) there should be a rule so that you can only use default cosmetics. Or else we will carry on getting the problem the Wind Bastion uniforms have.
---
What Bartlett U, you can play custom games if you would like to
---
Once you do that it wont change that secound you are going to have to log out and relogin to r6 then itll update.
---
I wish I had 40k Reddit accounts so I could upvote this with all of them
---
It's such a disappointing 'rework'. The gadget is still the same, it still forces ALL defenders to stand still with the press of 1 button.
---
Nothing damn ...that is all
---
Why so you think it's called RAINBOW 6??
---
Wait and see. Too short to be of use.
---
Ubi deep fried their servers.
---
"Don't think it's a hacker" - OP
---
"Any proof?" -Guy replying to the same person, rather than replying to OP
---
"Don't need proof, screenshot is enough" -OP, seemingly thinking the guy asking for proof is replying to him, when he's actually asking the other guy for proof of hacking.
---
Don't forget Terry Crews and Samuel L Jackson

They asked him to in the main post they made

I’ve even swapped to multiple servers in Asia Territories a couple times to test a few things &amp; it really is the same effect of what they’re doing over here. I got multiple aces with ease, I noticed some of their shots didn’t even register on me because my high ping (162) would mess with the server.
---
That what I thought when I saw this
---
I'm glad I don't play Seige on PC. Its sweat mode times 10000000
---
Come back when you have Spartan Authority.
---
Splinter Cell had this, I think. In the spies vs mercs mode, a spy could grab a merc into a choke hold and whisper into their ear before breaking their neck.
---
I got a point blank shot with the Italian revolver on ash and blood shot out but it didn’t register shit. She had super high ping and got two aces that game.
---
you do this symbol: &gt; but times 2

and if you are consistently playing with plats and consistently doing better than them, then idk how you aren't plat. I doubt that you actually are consistently doing better than them bc you would be plat by now
---
Why would you want that
---
I mean it is bicycle day tomorrow
---
You play Xbox?
---
Cuz I'm broke
---
I think its more the unevenness

PC.

Maestro would still be one of the best defending ops for his gun and ACOG alone.  Get Maestro.

Can someone explain to me why everyone seems to value this skin over all other epic skins?  I love it, but I'm not sure if there's something more I'm missing.
---
waste of a reinforcement.
---
&gt;above average gun
---
Idk why but i think you think about different Lion than me.
---
You missed

My life story

We already have a problem with hackers and if the game was free the problem would increase exponentially.
---
oh wow! what a nice and unique find of an easteregg which has been known for years!
---
I just did it for the meme bro
---
But is it ok?
---
Save up
---
Bc you picked Ash. Ash is mine and mine alone. Highest skill op in the game. 
---
But seriously, I dont even play her. She seems kind of boring to me. I'd rather go sledge honestly. Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
If you weren’t an Ash main before, you are now.
---
It’s tower, aka Korean hide and seek.

F for that twitch
---
No but the contest was cool because people could submit their own designs for weapons
---
How so?
---
I kinda agree, to me she sits between thatcher and IQ as flex support, flex frag and shouldn’t have a better weapon than IQ. Though Thatchers AR is great at mid range, faggers do do outclass him.
---
It’s actually unbelievable how relatable this is. The buck is like literally right next to the Bandit jumping out yet the Bandit would go for the most difficult kill on the guy furthest away lol.
---
You too! I didn’t even notice mine
---
Lord Shaxx.
---
Your a very strong person for playing a game so based on sound . Don’t listen to the toxic people your playing because you find it fun and that’s all that matters. And I hope it gets better

yep. because you died peeking an angle you probably shouldn’t have been peeking we will go back to alpha. makes sense
---
It is directly related?
---
Bad aim in general
---
Shorting someone only once would make no sense as it would be the first one to see the opponent wins. If you want to go for the quick kill line up a headshot
---
repost
---
I had something similar happen to me and my friend in ranked. We joined a game and our team only had me and my buddy, while the enemy team had 5. We managed to win 5-4 and half way through the last round the missing people connected.

Have you tried to.... shot them again and of that didn't work, have you tried to remove the mag and put it back in?
---
Just don't listen to the- oh right....   Just don't read them they're just assholes being assholes. You don't need to have any hearing to be good at the game. If you are on Xbox and need a extra player I'd be happy to play.
---
Good evening, I'm Ascii!

Concerning this post, this falls under our rule [ This thing looks like a thing from Siege" style posts are also not allowed. ] which is a violation of our Rule 1.

Thank you for your understanding.

exactly why it would't matter

you'rea fcking FAGGOT!

Now what happens if I put xfactor as 1.0000 and in-game ads slider at 83? Fov 84.
---
Need more pixels
---
Lol so stupid. Never posting in this gay sub again.
---
“No thanks”? What does that even mean?
---
You won’t click a button to add the challenge? You won’t do head shots?
---
You can just add it and play the game.
---
I would say echo is more fun. His drone is basically a roamer and you can also defend the point pretty solidly
---
I'm sorry, but the only mistake, was putting it here
---
No he just the boy in the striped pajamas (it’s a joke pls don’t downvote)
---
Are you going to say anything useful?

Ahh sounds good, currently at 11.7k renown, so about another hours worth of grinding left

Holy fuck I play at 1000 6 6 50(I think) how you even try to be accurate?!
---
Outstanding move!
---
If you are looking for viable starts you can start with anchors, these are operators that stay in objective and give useful data to roamers (and to annoy the shit out of attackers) these are Maestro and Echo. Then there are roamers: they ‘roam the map around the objective and take out anyone they come across, these include Jäger, Bandit, Cav, Vigil, Ela and many more. 
---
On attack you have less specific roles and everyone has their one role and gadget, you do have hard breaches tho, these include Finka, Ying, Lion (sometimes), Ash and I guess Dokkaebi when used correctly. Then there’s support(like) characters, who contribute to the team from long distance or with their gadgets, like Glaz, Twitch, Gridlock, Finka, Jackal and Montagne. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk
---
why? It's siege related isn't it?
---
Excuse me What the fuck
---
Well to me, this makes no since, not all guns that are AR should have a standard 31 magazine, and they base these guns IRL, every gun is different in its own right way, for example SMG, P90 has a 50 round magazine and others have a 31 round and others have a 26. It’s just how the gun is made, and no a DMR with 20 bullets in a mag would not make since and wouldn’t be balanced at all because DMR are usually at 2 shot kill. Ammo is a big part of balancing a gun, yes, P90 has 50 bullets but heavy recoil and MP5 31 but low recoil. Hope this makes since, this is just my opinion though.
---
Yes, but self promo is usually frowned upon, and if you're gonna do it at least insert the video and not link it
---

---
I, too, play at 80 brightness, and this looks like what I usually see.
---
I could tottaly do this
---
And to use that you have to stand still. Point

No. Sucks you’re getting tked but taking it out and ruining it for people who play it properly is just dickish and stupid.

Hello Uzum9ki, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/beqkq0/petition_for_an_operation_health_20/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
1. You hit 2 lucky wallbang headshots that has nothing to do with Ash 
---
2. You don’t know what skill cap means
---
Are you sure casual mmr resets every season? Because my opponents are usually more skilled than me every season.
---
Leaked new mind control op lol
---
Tbh, the problem is so bad that I think the player base would accept a fairly large number of false positives if the algorithm really worked (consistently caught nearly all MnK users and/or forced Xim to act so much like a controller that it didn't give an advantage).
---
It was all going well until this airjab accidental placement. Didn't have enough for the diffuser.
---
Ok, i will. Tonight after din din

Did u buy the standard edition?

Damn bro u really think u top shit lmao just leave it fucking shitter

The ego on this guy lmao. You’re a fucking nobody mate.
---
Jager main
---
Won't be finding out anytime soon.
---
Base operators are no longer included in the Y4 standard editions after we revamped and removed the starter. Instead we now offer scaling operator pricings that will update with each new season.
---
Plasma Pink, and I agree.
---
Even if 1 bullet it should have shown
---
Your grandmother has a good taste then
---
Look where my cross hairs go after to his stomach
---
Nøkk ?? i dont know because Nøkk isn't a danish word or name. It would be like asking how the word sapru (completly made up word but apparently the name of an indian actor) is spelled in english.  
---
If we then say "nøkken" that's an actual danish name for a sea creature that would lure people into rivers or lakes ... and kill them. That might be more correct than Nökk.
---
Now kids, what did we learn today?
---
Don't think they can use them yet in pro league because of the kerfuffle with lion in pro league. Not exactly sure on this
---
1. I don't think you were "wrong" per say, you just saw something you didn't completely understand (I struggle with this word choice, for it's not like you didn't understand, but you just wanted some feedback and reasoning) and asked for the community's take on it. 
---
2. There's also some weird choices in current gun balance. I couldn't see them releasing the current F2 on a new op, as people would (maybe rightfully so) argue that it doesn't need stupid RoF, good damage, vert recoil AND a 30 round mag. Some guns do just seem better than others.
---
3. Yeah RoF is a mixed bag. The community isn't wrong about it being good for headshots, but as you said, it can also burn ammo and especially on those damn 20 rounders, leave you pretty defenseless if a second target rushes you after the first.
---
Well it's a nerf because he can't see ya whole body, but it's a buffet because of said reasons. It's a balance of nerf/buff
---
He clearly shot both of their heads but okay
---
It does. If you can get a 5 stack all boosting you'll get 240% bonus, iirc.
---
it was a "nerf" but it didnt change anything about what makes him overpowered.  regardless of how you change a global ability its still a global ability which is what was fundamentally wrong about lion.  yes it has a shorter duration but it still does the same thing, it stops defenders from moving making it easier to A) kill them or B) get the plant down without being contested.  he still has zero counterplay and is still the same broken operator he was before the rework.
---
When I realised it wasn’t a loop 😮
---
Sweet
---
Jackal. It's his ar
---
DO IT!
---
Jackal.
---
it was his bottom right jaw dude
---
There’s allot of clans with the same name . We’re spelt differently aswell you asshole! Plus I don’t give a fuck about some South American apes.
---
I saw someone else do this and still have no idea how
---
If memory serves me right it’s frost but I could be wrong. Haven’t played in a while
---
NOW
---
No problem
---
That works until somebody Lawyers up
---
I'm starting to get a hunch the people who make these comments on every single gameplay post are just bad at the game...

You heard correctly
---
Why would you do that anyways
---
Drone skins yet?
---
Oh look its Sledgehog
---
I’m in Australia so sorry can’t play
---
DONT PLAY NEWCOMER!!! Its a noob trap
---
I had a friend who got banned during this. He wasn't being boosted (it was his smurf account in bronze 4 FFS) still was a laugh though.
---
wait, what camo is that? shit looks amazing...
---
Anyone remember COD Infinite Warfare? It had announcer packs it was cool
---
Yeah i love CS:GO.
---
Lmao this is epic, you’ve got too much time
---
Seriously why would you fall for that?
---
You specifically said ‘unconstructive style of writing’, I find it ironic that you would call out someone else’s English when you don’t even know when to use a comma. You proceed to defend yourself by saying it’s just a reddit comment, I find it ironic that you’re being pedantic on a reddit post, do you see the irony?
---
Also, when did I say making a rant and leaving out a comma were the same thing?
---

Chimera's music was a fucking banger.
---
To be honest - I don't mind people cracking a deaf joke, I don't have anything against it. You're okay here, you did make me smile :)
---

Just be aware, growing up I have heard all deaf jokes and it doesn't change really lol (pun not intended)
---
I miss that map
---
F
---
You're dead by that point.
---
although this is almost a month old, can you tell me how to do this?
---
kind of offtopic but ubi really screwed up shield animations last update. Every playback I see my shield is clipped sideways into my body.
---
Cause siege servers shit, takes me about 2-3 times to open the game without the 'connection error' message
---
That change happened a while ago
---
This is why this game is no fun anymore
---
Top: *spoopy*
---
Bottom: mondays
---
Chimera menu music is my fav
---
I think its pretty good, like all your others, I can see that you spent a long time on it and you shouldnt doubt yourself so much.
---
That's...god damn...
---
Same here, granted english has some pretty stupid rules lol
---
I mean yeah it’s kinda obvious the buttons are right there at the bottom
---
Black beards shield has 10 hp now and bullets go through it.

 Connection icon: The connection icon appears when you are experiencing packet loss or latency instability (for example, when some of your packets are being redirected on another internet route). When this icon is triggered, you can experience rubber banding, hits being rejected by the game server, and abnormal induced latency. The probability of experiencing those situations is far higher when the red icon is visible.

Why would you play high brightness when you’re planning on uploading to the darkness dwellers of reddit smh my head
---
I was wondering this too and in game chat doesnt make sense and its only on certian people
---
Thanks man I appreciate it I think I could have done better if I took another  hour putting it at 4 so like no and it was to much work and the wifi things at the bottom but that was hard and confusing I promise Finkas will be better.
---
Yeah, I play on Xbox and it runs the game at 60fps steady. But that doesn't stop latency issues and load times from fucking me over... Frame rate does not equal quality.

Residue from toy plane

Huh. I thought bounced nades/smokes/flashbangs didn't deal damage. TIL

Holy shit!?, looks dope dude

That’s 100000x better than what I could’ve done

Looks like a mw2 mod menu lmfao

They should've kept the outline in

I would like to call myself an artist and I know how hard it could be to think its good yourself.

My friends and I at first thought it showed mouse and keyboard because we thought text chat would only be active if a keyboard was connected but I guess it’s an option on consoles and she activated it by accident? Maybe?

Thanks
---
he's stupid weaker
---
Thanks for the advice

Really that seems like the best answer ive gotten even if it is just speculation

Blackbeard’s shield has been removed and his head sized increased by 45%

Bad reaction? All I saw in the clip was someone prefiring a c4
---
It's balancing, Kaid is a vital operator who offers unique and strong utility. Therefore, players are forced to deal with the high-risk-high-reward shotgun or the puny damage of the smg. If he had a strong smg he would be overpowered and overpicked.

Someone else in the thread said text chat but I won’t be getting on till later tonight and I hope I remember to check. If I do I’ll let you know
