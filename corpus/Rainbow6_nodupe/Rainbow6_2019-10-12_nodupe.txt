shooting through a wall where roaming defenders usually sit to pick off people shortly after spawn
---
Why did you do that to him
---
Why do I have to pick one? Is multiple offenses just saying I’ve been toxic multiple times and not that I have been banned multiple times? I was permabanned in the middle of a match and I did nothing wrong during the match.
---
I have the same one! I had EG sign it for me at the Raleigh Major.
---
Oh for sure, in bronze you have the largest skill gap between bottom and top of the leaderboard because usually the people who at the bottom are actually new players, and the people top fragging are actually Gold players who got bronze in placements and are just working there way out.
---
I don’t know why you can’t turn all the way around. It’s why I avoid repelling for the most part

Highest rank I ever got was Gold 1 but like 10 points away from Plat 3 and that was a while ago. This was my main game from launch up until 2 summers ago and I’ve been playing intermittently every since. I think I could easily make it to and complete in Platinum but I play solo so it’s nearly impossible. Most people on console are toddlers, at least in casual and lower ranks, so it’s easy to go 10-2, but my teammates are just as bad as the enemies and rarely go positive. So it’s a positive and a negative to play with toddlers in this game.
---
IQ
---
Or you know, the game could just let me turn another degree or two so I’d have a fair chance at killing the person, instead of completing restricting me from shooting at them. Attackers should have the advantage when gunfights occur outside.
---
You can't.
---
Not really. Echo is pretty balanced.
---
My biggest issue with this game is that I’ve been playing since the beta and don’t have a single black ice skin 😭
---
Why is this toxic? You’re just playing the game.
---
They fell like the power rangers when they got hit
---
The definition of being trolled
---
Same thing with Maverick, a lot of people don’t realize you can use his blow torch to destroy the camera lol
---
shooting thru a wall where a spawn point is, if he was waiting there and insta domed everyone on spawn then it would obviously be a hacker. and he was using a dlc operator, i doubt a hacker would spend money knowing his account would be banned
---
Have you checked in with [Ubisoft Support](https://support.ubi.com/Cases/New) on this?
---
I mean, even Ubisoft themselves confirmed that it doesn't give an advantage yet people still thinks it does.
---
Because you were obviously warned previously since it says multiple offenses. The current game has nothing to do with it. Your previous offenses added up and Ubi stopped the hammer
---
Honestly dont know why either
---
Have you tried requeuing when it gets fairly long?  
---
Are you only having this problem with Casual? Or the same happens with Ranked or Unranked? If so, what rank are you currently?
---
I think it could be the angle idk I don’t like it to high
---
..... Half? My man, its amazing already.
---
Thanks ma boi

This is definitely diamond

So this is still happening...

Love the spam leaning at 0:33, a true ash main lol
---
Huh
---
I think thats where your problem is, u made the lore first then the gadget. I think most of the time they fit the character to the gadget not the gadget to the character. Plus i dont think people spend that much time reading the bios
---
Hungry hungry hippos
---
Not yours
---
0:33 lol
---
Didn't know the Maestro turrets had a front cam.
---
Then develop it, it’ll take time but you can definitely do it man
---
This is just a regular Marley vid
---
Apparently. We got an error after we were apparently put into a match three times and are currently banned for 30 mins. We actually managed to get into a match and 4-0d it but got no MR because we got hit with the sanction half way through.

How does twitch counter him?
---
Is there a counter to this. Never has happened to me yet so I haven’t had the chance to try different ways of destroying the drone but as I scroll through reddit since the new season this is all I see clips of. Big oof
---
What’s to criticise about that? It’s really good
---
Most operators are already op
---
I’d recommend new comer until you get the ropes, people are generally nicer but you get a few Smurf’s here and there.
---
You do that?
---
just play ranked low level, there's no initiative to climb
---
Basically any movement you do the shield is a second behind because of desync.  so when you fell he shot you through the shield because it hadn’t caught up yet. It’s something they need to fix, it’s been in the game for way to long.
---
A -2 vs 1?

---
I see your prefire and raise you mine: https://1drv.ms/v/s!AoHKzJgTsYoLxwdBpjzmq28281mp
---
Don’t be stupid play the game like a normal person.
---
This is one of the many reasons I don’t like shotguns
---
personally, i think these are actually really good changes and this is a step in the right direction for balancing Jackal. i see a lot of people saying he has "Lion syndrome" in the way that he'll either always be overpowered and never be balanced, but I disagree with that. these new changes add a new layer to make him more challenging to play and it makes you think about using your scans more wisely.
---
Jackal isn't OP to me, but he can be very frustrating to play against as a roamer (i feel like a lot of people don't get that Jackal's entire purpose is to gather precise intel and give roamers a hard time)
---
Mate, I’ve got one acct with w .4 W/L, .4 K/D &amp; another with a .8 W/L, .6 K/D. Those number mean nothing except you’ve had bad matches.
---
I’m the one on top
---
The problem for me is people bringing that mindset into Casual.
---
When you put your ole faithful, she provides
---
Yeah but if this is one of the scopes i don't see why they can't give it to Nokk, But since it would be classed as a completely new gun it should be given to the Indian attacker next season.
---
bruh that fucking sucks
---
Drugs are a hell of a drug
---
BRRRRRRRRRRR
---
Jackal, IQ, Fuze, Thermite, Hibana, Nomad and Nokk have electronic gadgets. Plus claymores are also electronic.
---
Mira is already strong enough as she is, I dont think she needs a buff.
---
In case anyone is wondering: QWERTZ is the default layout for German keyboards, IIRC.
---
Its just like how IQ can see pulses gadget but in reverse
---
Are the live on TTS? In yesterday's update, jackal change wasn't implemented yet.
---
I really like all there doing especially the removal of breaching charges and addition of claymore since he has a secondary shotgun, but I don’t really know if this will change his ranked ban rate. People naturally just hate being jackal tracked no matter what. Maps like consulate, bank, villa, and kafe jackal seems to be a must ban do to the heavy roam presence. 
---
We’ll see though I like what there doing and have no issue with anything as a heavy jackal user (pre ban phase)
---
Hmmm for buck play hella vertical, for capitao shoot you bolts at common angles and corners like the back left corner and behind the thing in the front left corner on outback’s kitchen site for valk c4 traps are a good strat and for frost hiding traps in bushes and small plants like the ones on chalet by that little connecting hallway and the plants under skylight on consulate
---
i think they were disabled temporarily for some reason, [here's a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6TTS/comments/dgk3ug/update_to_oct_1019_ts_patch_jackal_changes_are/)
---
I'm not very good. But we should play sometime.
---
 The 'terrorist hunt' strategy. They hear the nitro cell and think they can pop it before you detonate it then 'bang'.
---
It must have been bugging out for me on those games I had cause I just went into a custom to verify and its letting me do it now. And I didn't change anything on how I do it.
---
Well, that could be true. But this is thé first time this has ever happend to me after 3 years of siege. So is seemed exceptional
---
Hibana and Thermite it would be absolutely useless cause if the metal wall, Nomad you can practically see and hear the thing, Nøkk is understandable, Claymore you wouldn’t be able to do anything about it cause of the claymore placement
---
I just bought a refurbished Asus Strix with a 1070 and it plays this game very well and it is in pristine condition with a significant discount bought for around $1200
---
I play console bro. So if you’re on Xbox, find me &amp; we can run.
---
Mira/elite skin hibana
---
Ubi’s bug fix team happened
---
Ubisoft just can't be bothered fixing game breaking shit.  Lazy pricks.
---
agreed on his ban problem, i think he'll still be banned heavily because people want to roam more comfortably. jackal will still be quite strong even after the changes, but I think people will have a slightly better time having to play against him now
---

1. I got this tattoo because i plan on having my left arm gaming related to things important to me, rainbow six siege has had a massive impact on my life bringing my friends closer together and helping me from being suicidal
---
2. i won't be alive in 60 years from now for grandchildren to go whats that? I'm fucked medically so i want to enjoy myself with my short life that i can
---
3. i understand people thinking tattoos of specific things and what not are stupid but to me because a single tattoo could kill me i have a lot of meaning behind everything

Probably should just delete this

These are great one raps but it would be better if they weren’t in cas

I had a clutch 1v4 last night. Teammates on Valk cams and they 2 ops come in at two angles, killed them both. The other 2 came in at two different angles at two different times, killed them both. 
---
I never moved from my spot till the 4th kill. They obviously weren’t communicating and it showed lol the whole time my team was feeding me info on 3 of them.
---
I’ll post the clip Sunday when I’m back home, we went a bit nuts!
---
They won't do it because any change made to them could throw them off balance and into the OP zone.

Imagine garekeeping rainbow six siege lmao

Try turning on fast sync.
---
If you have gsync, use that as well.
---
O that's cool
---
Destroy the defuser* it took me a while to get my brain in that mindset, since the defenders have the bombs and attackers are trying to defuse it before it releases the chemicals.
---
Fuze pellets are concentrated slav magic and have an agenda of their own. In other news just saw someone fuze a hostage in 2019

What platform do you play on? Also playing with randoms is painful, but i think there is a lot to learn from it.

Xbox

---
you don't even know the difference of a new gun do you? look up the honey badger and now imagine that gun in game, That has a new look it would have new recoil and a new animation.
---
it's not hard for them to change the magazine and BTW Lions Vector isn't a new gun it's old.
---
Stable genious?
---
I was just asking because this guy seemed to be doing it and I thought that might be why, also i don't why i couldn't think of the word
---
5'11 vs 6'
---
I know his win rate it's not that high but two invisible camera that can be placed anywhere everyone get access to it and can stop the plant in seige is a broken gadget he is not frustrating to play against he is just too powerful jackal yes he is frustrating to play against
---
I’m fully for it. I would like a shooting range where I can easily swap through load outs and such and not have to restart the match, or worry about getting killed by terrorist, or their unrealistic flinch mechanic
---
Ash gets the shotgun. Thermite gets the G36C.
---
I think some console players like to lean rather than adjust their aim during the fight, could be wrong tho
---
Can't add one in the comments
---
I have it for the ak12 and the lmg....

niiiiice

It really isn't. Why so reluctant to admit your rank?

I'd say I'm sorry you're bad but that guys just as worse

In the last invitationals there was an in game event with packs, there was a low chance to get it

why is the mp5sd worse ?
---
I hate it. Just clip it out you scrub
---
Dude...
---
I had a similar experience with ranked I got sucked into copper my first ever time playing ranked and only ended up playing with smurfs. I never won a single ranked match in operation health. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth and I haven’t gotten ranked since then.
---
One of my last ones was on 71% despise winning most of the games since 49%...
---
And the last one was on 40%
---
I think we are just very unlucky this season mate.
---
I’m not entirely sure but I think you might be in the wrong rank haha
---
Did you guys win?
---
I heard they matchmake based on your rank.... how the hell that work? I was gold 1 last season and I had a diamond on my team, in cas. How does that work. And the diamond was last on my team.
---
Memed on him with the silent shotty I see 😏
---
Some shit
---
Casual has a different MMR system, so I guess your diamond and the plats I went against were just doing awfully enough to be queued with you and me.  No offense to you, of course.
---
Nah
---
Operation health
---
My most, and it’s a fluke, was during the hammer event. Got 36.
---
Lol none taken. I’m an on and off player usually😂
---
If this community starts one witch hunt after another in some kind of crusade to get one Op nerfed after another I'll be so disappointed
---
Quiet impressive!
---
My highest count was 19 but we were a full (but obviesly useless) team
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
We’ve all got good and bad days.  Just makes it worse when someone who’s supposed to be good is playing poorly enough that they get queued against a team of freshies or slightly worse players.
---
Maverick’s torch can also destroy Maestro’s evil eye’s just as quick. Sledge and Mav can both counter Maestro perfectly!
---
Is it bad I got plats in cas whilst I was a copper in Burnt Horizon?
---
just use recruit
---
Edit: Thanks for the cold 🤧 unkind stranger
---
Bad for them yeah.  Again, no offense to you.  Just goes to show that people who play well enough in ranked to have a high rank can still play like ass.  That or you were playing very well.
---
What's your gamertag
---
Idk if I fully understanded OP post, but there are some skins where the add a random color were it doesn't belong.
---
For example, Lion / Finka volatile grey uses a dark green color for the vest instead of black and kinda ruins the whole setup.

Do you count dropping about 6-8 avg. per cas match playin well? Remember, it’s against coppers and bronzes.
---
Oh god dude if I go 3-2 and LOSE it’s a good game for me.  I’m awful and somehow ended up gold last season.

That one Tachanka one tap was too disgusting. You went outside, placed a turret, and one tapped. That isn't allowed.

Definitely. Some people dont understand that the end purpose of any game is to make you enjoy yourself (*usually*) and it’s hard to hav fun while bleeding to death from a random bit of shrapnel or after tripping on a tiny ledge.

Well done! :DD
---
Not just this one but actually all your R6 art you posted so far &lt;3
---
thats a great idea. i struggle to find the last guy, that why i always play Extract Hostage so at least the round ends when i get to the flare and not have to wait to find the last guy.
---
That was clearly because you had a better gaming desk.
---
I thought this too. Game audio is shit
---
Shouldn't have touched that bottle of vodka before the attack...
---
Both great operators, mozzies better on the roam and maestro can be better for the plant denial so depends how you prefer to play?
---
Basically the same thing happened to me when I was playing with friends lol
---
Lands: \*Crack\* high pitched screeching ensues.
---
Imagine the wimba way meme over this

In pro keague one player got 25 kills and they still lost. R6 isn't about kills and it is time people understand that so we don't have to hear the ongoing nagging of people claiming your bad beaucause you have a 0.8 k/d

Make sure your graphics card drivers are up to date. Is the graphics card at least 3GB?  Can you also tell us what graphics card you have? If not I would turn VSync on. Make sure your monitor doesn't have a setting where it actually requires you turn on VSync. Some older monitors do require that.

This is what my teammates see

Hey guys today I have a new glitch that is pretty overpowered
---
You peeked him, so you suffered no disadvantage due to your ping. Your connection became highly unstable as you engaged, I think your first shot was lost, otherwise you would have won the fight.
---
Lol it was his fault to heal me while backing out into construction when he knows an enemy is right there. He should have come into the same room as me.
---
IQ superman'd that hoe
---
It's already been bug reported &lt;3
---
Did you update drivers recently? You could try and roll back to an earlier version you had running before

If you round the corner witha high ping it takes longer for the enemy to receive that data so it does.

Yeah the sounds are fucked in this game. I just started to play music in the background, I play better when I don't try to rely on sounds, as crazy as it might seem, it works for me.

Because like, I feel like someone's on my right, yet I hear something from my left, so I check left, and what do you fucking know, he was on my right.

I would have tested shooting foot. Would be great for kill feed.
---
Yup! Heck watch what I was able to do with one of the worse shotguns in the game due to the laser sight :3
---
If people are always getting mad at you for "not having fun" cause they are doing intentionally dumb crap/throwing thats one thing. But people throwing this hard is pretty rare so hope you're not just yelling at people cause they've misplayed. :P 
---
Generally if you're in a ranked game with someone everyone is equally terrible and some are just having their up game and others their down game. Don't wanna be that guy kicking everyone having their down game just cause you happen to be having your up one at the time.

&gt;I respect your criticism but I said 2 or 3. I'm just trying to think outside the box. 
---
I'd say your post is a lot less maniacal than most of the other suggestion posts on this sub, but ak12 should be restricted to 1 and 2 speeds only.
---
&gt;There are worse guns that could be seen on a 2 or 3 speed that would break the meta
---
Like what? F2 is getting a Nerf in the future and will see one more, and other than that, no other gun on a 3 speed attacker is even nearly as potent "overall" as the ak12. R4c is a 4 shot on 3 armours, unlike the ak12 which I'd a 3 shot, and has lost the acog, and the g8a1 is a 4 shot on 2 and 3 armours and also happens to lose out in ttk to lesion's t5, Frost's 9mm, Castle's ump and one other, so even with it's angled grip and 850 RPM it is a balanced gun. Ak12 on a rushing 3 speed would be cancer.
---
&gt; but the Ak-12 in it's current state wouldnt be that bad of an overreach if you base it on stats like 45 damage and 50 mobility.
---
45/850 makes it a guarantee 3 shot on all armours at 140 ttk. No gun on a 3 speed does that to all armours. Added to that, rush with that and nobody will stand a chance, even in headshots.
---
Given it's potency, it simply cannot be on anything other than a 2 speed if introduced again.
---
&gt; Finka is a 2 speed and has the 6P41 and still hasn't broken the game. I think it'd be fine.
---
6p41 is an l85a2 with 10 extra rpm. 46/680. It has the same potency as an l85, weaker than the 556 and 552, with more lead but slower reload and slower ads. It is anything but game breaking.
---
Git gud
---
Lion for sure
---
Vigil doing the okay hand.
---
T hunt is for aim training. Not warm up. Even pros use unranked for warm up now.
---
Casual is for chilling. If you want to play for 30 minutes, quickly, simply, and for the hell of it, you play casual. If you want to practice for ranked and aren't a diamond who can just scrim, you play unranked. It's simple, and a clear demarcation.
---
T hunt is for aim training. Casual is for chilling. Unranked is for ranked strats practice without worrying about your strats failing miserably and you losing elo.
---
Yes he can. OP was just listing operators that the attackers selected that could take out the turrets.
---
Problem solved.

Can we have a rule the sub is english only becouse the japanese will see this and destroy the whole sub
---
This is good, but would be better if he was holding a sign that read "China is bad".
---
Technically c7e has an "inbuilt" big barrel.
---
10 lesion mines together and he has 5 for a balanced operator
---
Is that sledge?
---
&gt; Latency has no impact on hit detection.
---
never said it did just that the server "update time" on the player husk is slower so its easier to get a way with shit posting.

Ps4 clan here just dm me

Can someone please do like fan art that shows the 3rd person perspective? That would be hilarious

I could also see her lips for a brief moment. Before this my HUD froze even though I could still play. After this round my screen went black until the next round started and the HUD just completely disappeared.

This gun always gets joke nerfs almost like Ubisoft is afraid to actually nerf this gun. Oh I must of been thinking of zeal the operator who’s gun got nerfed to the ground. Anyway the F2 has solid asf dmg high asf fire rate and a what 30round mag. 5 bullets ain’t gonna mean shit. Some people say lose her ACOG I think that’s not enough. I don’t know nerf the dmg nerf the fire rate or increase the recoil *not like that joke one they did a few seasons ago and reverted it for the cry babies* as it was barely a difference on this busted laserbeam gun
---
I think I’m going to start detonating from a room away at this point. Haha.
---
I had this same problem but with blitz. It's the weirdest thing.

My whole team was a 4 stack of chinese players that I had to carry

Why do you think it's a bad idea? Saying no doesn't give me any feedback on what to change

Yeah they kinda suck
---
I have a clip of this
---
I can't think of anybody besides Castle who would work. Cause you know, wall.
---
Yeah i thought about Castle too. Working on it
---
imagine not know what a screenshot is still
---
Check your task manager, my bet is you are running something targeted towards games that kills extra programs when you launch a game.
---
I got my first epic skin recently... It looks like a really old fridge.... Idk which gun, idk what Operator, me sad... Even though the skin wasnt worth the "epic"
---
This is the wii sports theme you imbicile
---
Dude basically admits to smurfing in newcomer mode, so basically he just walked up to a group of toddlers with boxing gloves on.
---
yeezy
---
Watch again carefully. The hole is not breached and I have the stairs in my peripheral vision. Also footsteps are coming from the door.
---
Cav doesn't really need counters. She's at best mediocre, and Zofia doesn't need any buffs whatsoever, she's strong enough as it is.
---
That isn't balancing lesion and an smg is for close quarters too. His smg isn't that special and taking away that and leaving him with just the shotgun is an insane idea what other operator has one primary?
---
Just because you may have had hard times with a lesion doesn't mean he needs unnecessary nerfs. Play him for a while and you'll learn how to counter him rather then taking away a decent all round operator.
---
&gt; Noone would wear worse one?
---
A ton of people would. Even outside of choosing their favorite color, a ton of people would do it just to troll people in matches.
---
Nice but you should put your name on it so noone steal it :)
---
It's a small feature of Zofia, take it away and she's still one of the strongest operators in the entire game.
---
Why is there such hate for newcomer mode? Aside from smurfing assholes i appreciated the time to get familiar with the game before I was immediately dumped into pools with Plats all the time.
---
Zozo's Abnormal Mission
---
It's more about personal preference. In my opinion the:
---
- Holo is bad and very blocky
---
- Reflex is quiet nice, it does not block your vision alot
---
- Red Dot is very good and has a clear sight picture
---
- ACOG is my second favorit sight in all of Siege. It is clear, does only block little of your FOV and feels like the NATO Holo with magnification.
---
But it can win you rounds. Once in bomb, I planted and the defender downed me but forgot to finish me I got up and killed him. It’s a little bonus, not he main ability.
---
Omg.. I was just there
---
Compared to Ela, Lesion is op as all hell. But that's mostly because our main is pretty shit when it comes to most things. But i do understand your point.
---
yeah i was thinking it could be managed like a mounted camera. Making him kind of an easy target for flanks. As well as the camera putting off some kind of light to make it a lot more noticeable
---
Nah personally i just think getting a shotgun pistol to the head from a metre away should be a insta kill but you know how it is
---
It actually blows my mind that they haven't added unique melee's yet. Like for Sledge or something. They're adding unique (and terrible, in the case of Warden) run animations, so it would be an interesting addtion.
---
Yes, but the difference here is that blizzard did it, while Ubi used their brains and held on to their self respect. That in itself is worthy of some bit of recognition.

Hello Riley_1384, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dgwovv/2_shots/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Bruh this shit is actually hard not gonna lie :D
---
They used to do that, I believe they stopped when charms started be based on your highest rank rather than your current rank at the end of the season. 
---
Since they made that initial change I doubt they will ever start giving the extra charms again though personally I would like it.
---
If nothing else I think they don't do it as the charm section is pretty bad as is if you could get every rank charm every season it would become even more of a mess.
---
Thanks for the heads up, however I have my name hidden to catch these sneak thieves out
---
No. This has been asked countess times before and always proven that this is just a more unchallengeable version of BB. BB tanked headshots while he headshotted you. This dude doesn't have to worry about bullets while he headshots you. This is worse, broken, and OP.
---
And I congratulate them for that.

Had this happen to me kne time. It was super fucky to try and learn how to walk. It was my first game in ranked too, needless to say i sat in a corner and pre fired on a door the entire round.

I like how he just fires, dumps a mag and then slowly turns towards you like...."f**k, wrong target".
---
MR. OBAMA GET DOWN
---
Holo sight? Fuckin coppers
---
Sounds cool, but for that they got to change a lot of things
---
The rework is shite the old version was better, idk why they didn’t just make a new map
---
In regards to my last fight against Echo, I tried to prefire him and when I saw he was behind the shield I tried to keep him behind it while I pushed forward towards him. My aim isn't that bad I promise lol

Is plane still in the rotation? I feel like I havent played on it in so long

How bad at programming you have to be to produce that kind of glitch. It messed up the player camera putting it in a different position
---
git gud?
---
What da fuck is going on here?
---
I don’t think so but I suppose that could be it. Idk how I would get penalized for renown in thunt tho, that is where this first occurred
---
Now I wanna see how it looks like in 3rd person
---
It's not, I think it's coming back at end of season. I still don't agree with them removing maps from casual.
---
Yea didn't realize how big a post this was going to be, and people wanting to share it so i figured i post the clip link

Could someone draw this please
---
Well the defender is a competitor for Jager so we can already expect something in the lines of anti projectile. 
---
The attacker was leaked as a shield operator but is not confirmed to be an attacker + not confirmed to be in this season / not confirmed at all. So yeah i want leaks asap
---
Ah yes, Gus and Fuzz the spet-snazy-est operators
---
It's just a glitch when switching between accounts. Close the game and reopen it on the account you want to play on and it'll go. I'd be surprised if Ubi don't fix this in the mid season patch
---
With other people?
---
How do you know it’s a keyboard?
---
This keeps happening to me. And that’s why I have 300 mmr
---
Do you have the clip?
---
I ain't even happy since I never use this gun, but I can just say... FINALLY got this 'Black Ice'. 
---
I'm happy of just having 'Black Ice' in my skin collection, who cares I ain't even gonna use it :D
---
Where did you get that?
---
I hope it will be in pvp too as the 3 spawn points are boring and this one looks to be spawn peak protected.

Siege is not only special squads btw.

Yeah it sucks but it only provides them a slight advantage. I’d take m&amp;k users over ddossers and server crashers any day. Although there might be some correlation between the two. 
---
Im level 220+ and all season plat (since y1/s4) so I do have experience.
---
That is one of the old spawns on Kafe. Got removed because it was too vulnerable to runouts.
---
Let us turn controversial map on and off. Bad maps are fun, once in a while at least.
---
It's really good but you missed one important detail.... she does not have a flat ass my guy
---
It's not a problem it's 2000000 iq
---
It won't come back. It was part of Kafe but was too vulnerable.
---
Yep in the discord server
---
They already have that in game, it's called a drone.
---
HUNT Showdown is taking notes
---
Barackitao
---
I miss Acog too, but I feel this situation would have been even easier handled with a 1x lol.
---
What it probbaly would do: more spread, more controlable recoil, been seen les easily and quicker ads time
---
Imagine using a app that connects to R6. Then depending on your operator’s gadget, you can reload ash’s gun faster, you can see IQ’s screen and stuff. That would be cool!
---
But it was good he doesn't have it anymore
---
Hey dude, Can i tell you something
---
Yeah I felt the same.
---
🤡
---
Fuze has entered the game.
---
He's doing T hunt and using multiple ammo boxes to get more and more claymores is my guess.
---
Wait... can you explain better?
---
Are you playing on the low mmr account or the higher?
---
Because you cannot connect your other rank to a different server but you can swap servers in the higher mmr account.

Hi, a liitle bored today its nice to meet you

Probably, I think I’m just nostalgia of playing Jager with acog on maps like Presidential and yacht
---
OH CRAP I WAS GONNA GIVE HIM GOLD
---
no way, I watched this episode and didn’t even notice!
---
He can't. he "quit", and out goes his credibility.
---
I can’t see the video it won’t load ):
---
He got hecked
---
What does he do?
---
You want gold?
---
Just twice and you plummeted so hard?

Has to be more.

As a noob I really hated this scenario, it baits you to rapel in front of spawn but then some guy just goes out this door and kills us all like "oh there's a freaking door right there".

Well, when someone leaves in round 1 or 2 after dying and that team is in a 4v5 for the rest of the match, that is stupidly unfair

Clash obviously.

Just not stupid :)

Then all you'll get is stale cheese.

I can only imagine how u felt after that

I welcome it

Ew......

Its something at least

Real hardcore streamer

You had better have clutched

This highlights that if the the matchmaking system was changed a little, siege would feel a lot more diverse and interesting. I'd love an algorithm to decrease the chance of getting a map you've recently played, but since I'm not a programmer I'm not sure how difficult it is
---
Look how “OP” she became
---
No its normal that. House, favela, tower, plane and theme park are not available.
---
Do we tell him?
---
Did his controller die right after he made that kill?!
---
Reading your replies youre a serious wuss, the kind of kid that doesn’t do shit himself, probably pays someone to do your homework for you, sounds like a spoiled little brat that doesn’t see what’s wrong with what he’s doing, I guess daddy and mommy doesn’t wanna beat their little marshmallow pumpkin and teach him how to be a man.

I have no strong feelings one way or the other!

No plasma pink is not currently in packs and has been removed for several months. When you recieve a pack its contents are pre-determined. So if you save packs and open them now you can still open plasma pink from parabellum. Additionally alpha pack contents rotate, so in future seasons we will most likely see its return.
---
Also its over rated.

Just uplay, it gets unnecessary complicated if u buy on steam
---
um so basically im monkey
---
When she shoots, reloads, sprints, vaults, walks through wire, steps on a lesion trap, just about everything that's not walking/crouching.
---
This is why I play Nokk even if she's not the most meta operator, it's too fun to do this
---
From what I've heard from several leakers they plan about 8 months for the majority in advance but have several operator prototypes in developement constantly and just slap a nationality on them after concepting the ability. Y5s2 doesnt sound unreasonably since we know for a fact they are already working on y5s1 quality of life changes.
---
The 360 at the beginning is the best indication that op is using a controller
---
Consider me impressed
---
Pretty much the new wind bastion season skins
---
don’t worry they gained 0 elo and i lost 1 elo
---
Oof
---
It’s a glitch where they canceled the queue as soon as they got in the game and it didn’t tell them they’re in a game
---
That scared the butt plug out my cat’s ass
---
What is wrong with your movements????
---
Why is everyone so obsessed with "fixing" or buffing warden???? Why can't we just leave him?
---
The capture was acting up
---
Oh ok lol I thought ur mouse was going haywire
---
No haha, that’s not what I saw when I did it
---
GhostX on the Sonics played a pl match that way
---
I use his shotgun and smg 12 more fun than that pea shooter
---
r/getdownmrpresident
---
Vigil, he’s got good firepower and can roam pretty well. Clash is only good with five-stacks/pro’s really but she’s not hard to master fully, I recommend vigil because you can frag out more with him rather than clash and clash needs one person with her at all times.
---
Yeah they ended it with “Fck you life is a tiny dick with a flabby condom” “U cum colored cunt”
---
Please commit death.
---
Yes but the casing is bigger than Russia
---
sounds more likely :)
---
didn't know that
---
I mean kanal didn't changed too hard from what I heard. I started playing in grim sky so I didn't know what old Hereford was really like.
---
Welcome
---
Ubi once again proving that ash’s breaching rounds have better hit boxes then ash herself.
---
Maybe not the solution you want, but I would just turn all settings as low as possible.
---
I do this with a 1080 ti and get 160-200 on 1440p.  I find the settings don’t make much of a difference in this game, due to the competitive nature. That said I’m no longer one for the aesthetics, just try to get the highest frames possible.
---
Shots 1-5: Clearly missed.
---
Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control).
---
Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses.
---
Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.

My first post on reddit is literally a downloaded clip that is perfectly normal

Not the point I was trying to make but ok.

So is Jackal and Cav / Clash / Blitz, so I guess they're all busted? Just because they're banned doesn't mean they're broken. And no frankly I don't care, when I call someone a Copper I mean they're just really dumb / illiterate / the dregs of society or as I like to call them occasionally "Bitch Boys"

it seems like he was focusing on the right hallway and that's why he didn't notice the visual distortions.

---
Bruh if only u could use a PlayStation controller on Xbox cause I swear in all these clips they bots

Ah Damn I knew this was to problem, usually I like to shoot randomly in the air all the rounds
---
I guess focusing on my teammate that was outside. I dont know. It was casual lol.
