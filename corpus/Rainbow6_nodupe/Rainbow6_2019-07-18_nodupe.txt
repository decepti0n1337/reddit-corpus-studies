Why is this a totally possible concept I'd be down with?
---
---
---
Yeah but you have to have good aim with her and you have to know how to sheild spin
---
There's no benefit to using it over the other guns other than to flex and to enemies
---
I mean, if he's telling the truth and actually only said 'Clash ruins the game'.. then 'harassed' is a pretty big stretch.
---

---
Salty for sure though
---
Since the aim is to go either ascending _or_ descending, the probability for the first step is 2/5 as either the lowest or the highest can be top/bottom. Then the probability for the next to be in correct order is 1/4, then 1/3 then 1/2
---
Just like you did to his sister?
---
Yeas but the thing is is that thats easier said than done and people usually panis win you turtle ive killed multiple good people with that trick because they dont expect it
---
This is some legit artistry going on
---
I think someone posted this not to Long ago
---
This along with the fact that it was a week late after everyone got bored of it. The mode got super repetitive after an hour or so.
---
How's it not fair? They were busted / broken before
---
No
---
If not an ACOG, then his turret should be able to shoot through shields ü§î
---
Is that the red lantern corps I see?
---
thats the joke
---
Hippity hoppity, get off my property
---
Can someone explain to me what just happened? I just started playing this game, I have less than 50 hours
---
This one was entirely on them. It was a terrible challenge that was a week late and didn't serve the gameplay for Showdown
---
You‚Äôre awesome!

Overloading your internet with random fluff to the point of it shutting down

This has nothing do to with him being echo lol he coulda been anyone behind that shield.
---
Soo cav on silent step? Cause that doesn't leave footprints or get scanned while active
---
She takes a lot of skill. Even if we ignore this 360 stuff that I haven‚Äôt the patience to get down. Playing a shield operator in itself takes skill in knowing how to position yourself to your teammates advantage, being accommodating for your team and allowing them to get frags, but also being an annoyance for you enemies. Clash in herself is designed, along with conventional shield play, to stall the attackers advance and to passively defend the sites. As a clash you need to know how to manipulate the enemy team by positioning yourself properly and working harmoniously with your team to give them space to stop attackers. If you don‚Äôt think that takes skill then you don‚Äôt deserve to play with a Clash or any other shield operator for that matter.
---
But not everyone is on. I'm sure people stopped playing because of the glitches and gadget removals.

I'm just saying if you're standing in a mute jammer he should not be able to scan you. This happened to me the other day and I was extremely surprised.

Because the map was straight garbo

I don't notice a difference with mnk guys and I play in plat and have a friend who uses mnk and he's below me in rank

After reading this comment I went back to read it in Elmo‚Äôs voice despite already reading it bloodhound‚Äôs voice twice
---
What platform?
---
I figured it had something to do with quarantine since that's going to have 3 player squads.
---
How about some one that doesn't leave prints. Their gadget will then let them leave prints for a short time. Maybe something a like more general tacked on. More or less as situational as Warden.
---
I just unlocked a bipod for my shield
---
Oh wait
---
lul. Could maybe be a spinoff CBRN (lion and finka)? I dunno but this seems like a very cool op OC.
---
F- for grading this amazing picture
---
The map is a square of death and anti fun experiences.
---
This works in so many ways its actually transcendent
---
Lol Idk what went wrong there
---
We need someone with robot feet
---
Spaghetti code
---
Because people think it's unbalanced and not fun, even though it's a beautiful map and, quite frankly, my favorite.
---
Yo that look's cool I bet if he get's to the game he will be romenia lmao

Hello Fuze_Is_Dad, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cekgv3/100_cpu_usage_glitch/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
What console are you playing on?
---
But can you spawnpeek with a bow?
---
A majority of maps were removed a while ago due to them not being competitively viable for the ranked rotation. You can see the current ranked pool by looking at the in game ranked guide and heading to the maps section.
---
Not anymore
---
You should try j√§gers 416 Carbine!

Bwiiiiiiiiiiiii^iiiiiiii

Yeah lol. Trust me Xbox is wheat cut from PS4‚Äôs chaff. Nothing but young kids yelling ‚ÄúHKACXKS IM REPORTNG U R TRSH KID‚Äù that I‚Äôm pretty sure haven‚Äôt even hit puberty yet
---
Happy Cake Day! üç∞
---
How do you put who you main on your name?
---
Because then it'd have to be a Cricket skin.
---
Fun fact: Bartlett is currently the ONLY map in the game not in rotation at all.
---
Ps4
---
I haven't seen art this fine since Pam Beasley.
---
True, as well as Dokk's and Vigil's, but I was more referring to standard buck-shot shotguns
---
Personally, I think that he's look even better in the Mariners green alternate.
---
This man is a master artist
---
The only significant change would be to actually reduce his tracking time. 20 seconds is just too much. And he has 3 charges. Which means you can track people for a total of 1 minute.
---
a lot of ops in this game have no direct counter
---
This is the content I came for!
---
Best Ltm ever it needs to come back it was also great for practice
---
If op is playing on copper ranks, cav and blitz also makes sense since no one on those ranks other than smurfs know how to deal with a rushing blitz or a hidden cav on the other side of the map.
---
yes because Minecraft belongs on this subreddit
---
Then i guess you and your parents are a ‚Äòdisappointment to your bloodline‚Äô.
---
too bad blitz is trash and ying just got nerfed
---
Fair enough. All it takes is a little bit of communication and team play to take care of any blitz or roamer
---
I have it just I can‚Äôt control the recoil on it
---
I have met the peak standards of my bloodline

Can we make this where he gets to moo the floor and it acts like a frost mat, but the enemy just slips and gets downed?
---
It would be cool if they brought it back and then let it show our cosmetic on the load screens
---
Amost every Defender's SMG are made for headshots but that doesn't mean it's good in Attacker's hand though. FMG is considered as an OK gun from Defender's perspective while being an underwhelming option for Attacker by the majority.
---
MP5k and FMG are used by operators who have area utilities and Smoke even have damage aspect. They hang around the obj and fight against 1 or 2 armor Attackers who went through traps and Roamers so they are often not at full health. Since the Attackers are the one coming for them, the high rate of fire with low recoil allows for easy headshot thanks to the angle advantage the Defenders have.
---
For an Attacker whose job is to enter obj by herself and take out Anchors, FMG just feels inadequate. Other Attackers have strong guns to have an edge over Defenders but Nokk doesn't. Ashe also relies very heavily on entering site quickly and take out her enemies. She can compete against Anchors due to her strong gun. Nokk cannot compete against Anchors holding angle because she has neither the damage nor the range like the majority of Attackers. She gets outgunned by popular Anchors and Roamers in meta going through the Roamers and traps.  
---
One big reason why she doesn't get picked often in above Gold/Low Plat is due to how she has trouble against Anchors and coordinated Defenders since Nokk relies heavily on Defenders making a mistake.
---
And 3 bandit charges 
---
And Bartlett wasn't even playable outside of Article 5
---
Yup the new persons abilleti
---
Being able to open lines of sights with impacts does complement his ability. Same goes for the deployable shield. They should have just removed the barb wire from him to be honest.
---
You‚Äôre damn right
---
I would say no. I honestly only get on when my friends are. It‚Äôs a really sweaty game. If I‚Äôm trying to relax I play other games.
---
That's a weird body pillow
---
I‚Äôve been told i always am. I disagree.
---
blame sony for being stuck up fuckers. one of the initial limitations of them in rocket league was that they're not to be matched with xbox players.
---
Jaw guard
---
Neither of us won
---
I find it funny that the operators we really want just have an ordinary gadget or something.
---
I mean we want an operator with a broom, but I also want an operator with a ladder, or metal window bars, or one with just a damn tarp
---
Dank
---
u forgot something there
---
He can remove traces of any defending operator.
---
I very much doubt that, joining a game halfway thru sucks &amp; the queue times are short enough anyway that it's not worth it.
---
That's incredibly well thought out
---
Felt that
---
So why not add the option to avoid joining a match in progress?
---
I meant to say mop the floor
---
Recently it's been bad. Had several different friend groups all dropping connections at the same time and getting insta abandon sanction. It's broken.

Yeah, give him the choice of being more agressive or more passive could open him up to 2 different styles of play

---
on PC? You have to find people who bought those skins on Steam as a gift and buy it off them. Pretty hard to find these people these days though.
---
Because then no one will do it &amp; games will constantly be half empty. People leave like every game in casual, they need to either keep it as is or have abandon sanctions like ranked.
---
Depends if you have a time machine or not,
---
Damn that sucks.
---
Ok
---
This is just ash‚Äôs head hit box, what do you mean?!
---
killing someone before they waltz into the objective is not an exploit lol. unless you mean somehow during prep phase
---
I find the F2 and C8 actually not that bad to control I just put muzzle brake on both .

Ok thanks will do

Love how this gets top of subreddit. This place is so backwards
---
Btw alibi in there
---
most likely 1st or 2nd week of september
---
Because 3 of your teammates are gold, so the average rank of your enemies will be between gold 2 and plat 3
---
Amazon used to have leftover codes you can purchase from but those quickly ran out too.
---
so every casual game isn't a 2v3 past round 2?
---
Could have been a slight bit of lag at the wrong time
---
The plat 1 is an outlier though

Closer estimate. I was just painting with broad strokes.

only if you would start getting abandon sanctions for leaving while that is on.
---
regardless of it happening while he was shooting, you would be able to hear it SOMEWHERE within the audio. after replaying it several times theres not the slightest bit of audio of him defusing... only once when he switched to the pistol. classic ubisoft bullshit
---
I should've figured a guy with a Tachanka flair is this stupid.
---
You are being dumb. You want to argue that Maverick is meant to play this way because the developers intended it to be this way, but then when they change him, you want to argue that they are wrong. 
---
This is called an Appeal to Authority fallacy.
---
Why tf were you just camping at a window when the clock was ticking down like that??
---
Say
---
U forgot attempting to run behind and melee while blind and ending up 15 feet in the other direction than you started and dying before you can even see
---
Thermite had frags once upon a time....
---
Right, but all of that takes other people. While yes obviously the good thing about teams is the strats you can run together. One of the reasons Glaz was once so powerful is because he has his own smoke grenades that assist his gadget. Imagine if you had to have another teammate throw a smoke for you as Glaz. Now Warden can do a Mira-like setup by himself, sure it won't be as powerful as a Mira assisted by teammates. But the shield synergizes with Wardens gadget in a way that is similar to Glaz.

As Ludo said in the thread if you actually read it..

That video was taken before this fix was launched.

I played against that lord Headass guy. I swear he's using MnK. His gameplay is super suspect.
---
Well it‚Äôs more that you should feel free to do what you want in casual. If I‚Äôm playing Maverick I shouldn‚Äôt feel the need to do the one play that‚Äôs in meta. This game becomes boring when there is one ‚Äúgo to‚Äù strat.
---
One offhanded reddit comment is lobbying now? I didn't know anyone at all cared about it, since it means nothing more than hours played.
---
Pretty old spot
---
My old college javelin
---
There having a knife fight.
---
You're the only one being dumb here lol. I want the character to do what he was designed to do. Like it or not, Maverick was meant to be stealthy. There are several ways they could've nerfed/countered him without going against what hes meant for.
---
Either that, or they should change Maverick completely and give him an entirely different function. That would be like making Caveira's silent step noticeably louder; it defeats the purpose of stealth.
---
ah aight cuz when i did it everyone freaked out lol
---
that's neat that's neat

actually some of the enemies are just not watching out BUT some spots are so good. you sir, are a 200 IQ frost player.

Ive thought about this and i approve

Loses it then too

Place it where OBJ is

Knowing how much people have played the game isn't nothing though.

Except Hostage ofc

His hockey pucks come out from a right to left line and one will shoot out right where you put it on the other side but they bouncy boys so just keep that in mind straight line coming out but bounce like hell

I think I see n√∏kk in the background

Man these guys are probably just jaded because they dont know how to play and dont have any type of awareness lmao probably die to mav a lot. I kill people through mav wholes all the time.

If there is no communication then I'm in it for kills. When there is communication I'm in it to win it.
---
If you want to get the most out of the cluster charges, you need a coordinated team. It's less about the position as it is about the right time to do it.
---
The good ol days when this game first came out, now we have people stressing the servers, I've only played like 14 ranked games this season and that's the second time this has happened to me. Consider yourself lucky.
---
Also did you see the nokk buff coming to the pts? It might be out already idk
---
Above the objective if possible, try to avoid doors as people will shoot your feet under the gap, and play him very sparingly in Hostage
---
Counter Counter Point: While it would be a higher risk play most of the time, it could be made very safe with proper droning and teamwork. 
---
Also I just thought what if you put on at the top of a set of stairs? You'd just be unable to get up to the upper level.
---
Yeah, everyone thinks shields are so easy so they get nerfed but really there is skill to them and they‚Äôre just destroying them altogether, I don‚Äôt like it I don‚Äôt want to find a new main
---
Easy to defend? Ha
---
I've played in that map so many times and i still hate it to death
---
Everyone loves House because its simple and medium, big may be good but not fun
---
You can also try a nitro toss out that door if you‚Äôre standing on the crate and blow a section out. I‚Äôve had multiple instances of getting kills with a shotgun as people walk in and out that door.

house isn‚Äôt simple? house is harder to defend than fortress?
---
a simple angle here and there will make defending fortress easy
---
but hey, fuck gaming room site? 4 windows, 2 doors, no way to defend that shit
---
house is worse than fortress, you‚Äôre just saying that house is better because you know the map layout
---
Fuckin beat me to it
---
I was just thinking this earlier this morning.
---
no, it doesn‚Äôt, you only say it does because you don‚Äôt know the layout and can‚Äôt be bothered to learn it

F for blitz.

Rip, well I'm some cheeks on it. I'll try to figure out how to play it
---
Who the fuck thinks like
---
:Yo imma bout to send a picture of my ugly ass because that's pretty hot
---
Yes the players may get banned, but in lower ranks such as copper and bronze a lot of the time its unevenly matched. The ban system probably isnt as effective as it needs to be.
---
I've played in that map at least 100 times, i know it perfectly and i still hate it
---
Also I‚Äôm really struggling to rank up, I‚Äôve been in gold before but I keep getting throwers and I keep dropping, any tips?
---
Fortress is a defender sided match due to all the different rooms and rotation hatches the roamers can use to rotation around if they are getting pushed.
---
&gt;Everyone loves House because ....
---
Anyone that likes house, likes it cause its in casual and its a run and gun map. If that map is anywhere near the rank map pool, it will start a shitstorm of complaints.
---
[removed]
---
That's fair. It was just a random idea I had. Nothing to be taken seriously.

In my opinion, Mozzie is a lot more fun to play.

I'm both impressed and terrified by your dedication to Chanka

Why does thermite need a buff
---
People still complain about shotguns? Wow.
---
Yeah it sucks, really was getting into Monty lately but will likely drop him now.
---
If you let someone into melee range you deserve to get killed.
---
well clearly you‚Äôre doing something wrong if you‚Äôre calling it shit bc it‚Äôs not
---
Cool. Now make a challenge to us where the winner has to get millions of headshots in a week.
---
Ela. Lion if you run a coordinated team. Alibi if you want better guns.
---
Maybe look up some Pro League games on it, it's actually one of the easier maps to learn the best default strats on.
---
An alibi would be necessary for any outside mats
---
Villa is ESL
---
*Grooovy*
---
You're welcome
---
it‚Äôs a defender sided map but that just forces attackers to be more careful about how they play

and yeah, i don‚Äôt want house anywhere near the rank pool
---
All my memories gather round her.... Miners lady stranger to blue water.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that because if I remember correctly in the past two lans it had 0 play rate

He doesn't but he's starting to get stale sort off. He's not great at anything but at the same time not terrible at anything either. I just feel like something needs to be done to spice him up a bit.

Unfortunately for PC players, they require the DxDiag (Windows+R -&gt; dxdiag and follow the steps) and the Game Settings file (Documents\\My Games\\Rainbow Six - Siege).
---
From there hopefully we can get an answer on whether this is expected behavior or not.  Ideally they will also examine and publish Blue vs Orange team win rates after this season as well.  I'm disappointed by the lack of transparency on these Ranked changes now that we are out of "beta."
---
Wow, I'm impressed that a gun that does good at close range but sucks at medium and long range is considered cheating.
---
Imagine the smell of his rotting ass cheeks and stale shit mixing together haha, Imagine if he sat of your face and forced you to breate it in haha.

Whens mid season reinforcements
---
They think every 3 armour needs an ACOG. Anyone that's suggesting weapon or speed changes to warden are completely oblivious to how he was intentionally designed. If warden had a really good acog'ed weapon, no one would be able to use smokes. They deliberately limited to him to both being an anchor and having midrange weapons. Warden needs a gadget buff, not a complete rework.
---
Just recently there was a text box bug which lagged the server. Fixed after a week or so, but how it even comes about, idk. 
---
Then Echo drones go invisible in some games. 
---
Also, there are times where you‚Äôll breach a wall, and nothing happens...  stopping your push.
---
You can break a window or wall to gain a line of sight (which is what is game was built on) only to be cucked by a floating piece of wood or concrete. That only intrudes on your vision, not the enemies.
---
Then you can reload or shoot your gun at random.... basically leaving you like a bird without wings.
---
Oh, and mic glitches still happen when you can‚Äôt hear or communicate with teammates.
---
You rubber-band through hatches, crouch/vault holes to where you basically teleport in front of your enemies (most of the time causing you to die, since you were expecting to be a floor below, rotating)
---
Idk man, all of these seem game breaking.
---
Oh yes, and hit reg is still horrible at times (maybe not a ‚Äúbug‚Äù) but a fundamental functionality of any FPS.
---
Also, maybe they could use the time to combat hackers and glitchers more effectively and swiftly. Idk
---
Of course we won't be defenders. It's a raid after all
---
They haven't announced.
---
jono?
---
"stop running around u guys, camp where u are and wait!!!"
---
Who's that?
---
Wet floor passive: attackers who walked through the water have squeaky wet shoes that can be heard easier.
---
Mostly good changes but imo the Echo and Nokk changes wont really do anything. 
---
Echo, the 3s less stun duration doesnt change the fact that he has 2 invisible drones that can stop a defuse plant and have people able to rotate it even after death of echo. It should be similar to maestro where the drone is stuck after the death of the operator. 
---
Nokk, Again 2 extra seconds wont really do much to change the fact that she doesnt bring any major teambase utility into the match or have any good guns to be a solo fragging role.
---
Happened to me dude its a ddosser who messed up pretty much i lost like quadroople my normal elo
---
If they had given out more than just one pack reward for playing it, lots would have played it.
---
lol, this happened to me yesterday
---
Shield nerfs are unnecessary imo, they aren't that hard to counter already so making them weaker just makes me want to not play shields.
---
Oh my gosh! I found someone that understands me. I'm not even a mira main but why not take the extra .5 second to put it on the edge. It drives me nuts.
---
If you don't want to completely reinstall you could verify your game files through uplay. Otherwise you might wanna see if there are any programs with overlays running, since they've been known to cause issues

Yes! I actually made some of my best friends playing Siege

Thaks man.

I find it sad when console players compare themselves to pros. Sit down dude. Your Diamond is PCs gold

Alright, I am very ashamed of myself and I'm gonna go play Minecraft instead since I'm obviously too much of a peasant for something like Siege.

Thanks for the help, thread locked.
---
I apologize for that :(.
---
I loved this screen. Always wanted them to modify it so that the operators look as you have customized them.
---
No such thing as a monitor that's to big, it just depends how far away you sit and whatnot. There's no best gaming mouse, it's preference.
---
Microsoft has the money to pay for more secure servers. If you guys don't like how Ubi is running their game then stop playing. It's a business and they're in it for money not a community. If they want to ruin the game and run it into the ground, then who are we to stop them.
---
The best part? This is high gold to low plat lmao.
---
Nice
---
and for most console players thats a generous conversion rate
---
\*Glance activated\*
---
They just need to buff N√∏kk so she doesn‚Äôt leave footprints
---
That shield one tho... That's real unfortunate
---
I agree with the Fuze main
---
Exactly the reason I left that toxic waste of console. Btw I'm a plat on console and currently a PC gold, it's pretty rough out here lol
---
Only problem is that those using low ranked smurfs would still fuck with the system if they're playing above the highest players level. Example: Gold (highest) queued with Copper smurfs who play at a Plat level. 
---
I don't think having it based off the highest is a bad idea by any means, but I think they'd still need some elo requirement on top of it.
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but this gif looks reversed, but I know it‚Äôs not

Just down people and leave a drag near them or drone them out then yeet one

And big companys have the money to pay their taxs properly doesn't mean they wont evade it your probably just a salty ddosser microsoft has more secure servers ubi wont pay for them thats why everyones complaining about one of the top 10 most profitable games not having decent server protection

YES

Why is there Kim Jong Un on a billboard?

This has happened to me too on this same wall and you just have to shotgun the on The other side

Thats just uncalled for....

Forgot about that, I don‚Äôt ever play causal so that‚Äôs not a option.

Hopefully you're not on ANZ servers so I don't get slapped by your Ash J√§ger Black Ice looking ass
---
Ah brutal. It really sucks when that happens. There are plans to fix this in early 2020 though, so hang in there!
---
The reason for it was to stop people from getting points from it  you could get mvp from just drone or camera scans alone. Thus giving you more renown at the end of the match.
---
Best idea
---
Better if it was shoot from a gun and made no noise
---
Play with friends that have much higher ranks than you, I played with high plats (gold 1 here), they play much more secure. You won't have the feeling that they are as bad as when they are playing as smurfs. Because they have plats against them, they can't play aggressive. And the other thing with them is callouts, compensating bad aim is prefiring or pre aiming. You'll get better if you play more anyway...

Yeah I ony sexualize male operators as I figured that's what this community truly desires.

Change the default play pause button on your pc maybe?
---
99 dmg close to mid range would always DBNO the enemy except ok headshots (obvi)

Do you just report for toxic behavior?

Thank god. Follow you on Instagram and I love your work, really great stuff. Anyways the guys deserve a bit of sexualization too!

Ace is only if you get 5 kills on a match

Check CPU usage prob at 90 - 100

Or an attacker with a wall piercing explody javelin

In game, yeah it would be cancer if it was in the game though but something i was thinking about  that was really weird

Sorry I had a typo on my comment. The devs can't really fix it since the console tells the game the input and its normal controller inputs. This isn't a r6s only issue, all major fps games like cod/fortnite/r6s/pubg has this issue.

Stand further away from windows, have someone watching it, claymore/nomad that specific window etc adapt to how they‚Äôre playing. Also if you were doing a good job as support the 2 people with 3 kills didn‚Äôt help much. I know some say getting kills doesn‚Äôt matter or whatever but it does (not in your case) to a pretty big extent.

Sometimes a minute or two to load in
---
On attack, Sledge, Thermite and either Ash or Montagne. Sledge is your soft breacher, has a great gun and frag grenades. Thermite has an OK-ish gun but he's one of the few hard breachers. If you play with a few friends and communicate, then get Monty. With a communicating team, he's a force to be reckoned with. If you're more of a solo player or if you like to all-aim-no-brain then get Ash, one of the strongest fragging operators.
---
On defense, my picks are Mute, J√§ger and Rook. Mute has jammers which can disable drones, certain gadgets and global abilities. He has access to a decent primary SMG as well as a shotgun, and a secondary SMG. J√§ger has a one-of-a-kind ability to destroy grenades mid-air. His primaries are both worth a shot, the 416c is the only rifle on defense, and the m870 is the fastest firing pump action shotgun in the game. Rook is the ultimate beginner's operator. His ability is to put down armor for his team which increases damage resistance and guarantees being knocked out rather than killed. He has access to ACOG on both of his SMGs (rare sight on the defending side) and the shotgun also isn't terrible.
---
Have the shotput leave holes in destructible objects as it goes along!
---
Name his gadget/broom Steve and have them be the bestest of bros.
---
It‚Äôs not that they aren‚Äôt fixing it it‚Äôs just not as easy to fix as some might think it is. You have to remember that they don‚Äôt have their own servers but rather they rent servers from Microsoft Azure for all of the platforms. In their latest Top Priorities and Concerns post they mentioned it was partially DDoSing and partially some error happening within the servers themselves. Just give them time and fight through it, Ubi always pulls through in the end.
---
Fuck Tower. 
---
It does have a nice skybox tho
---
100% the rainbow is magic event was amazing. The fun atmosphere was relaxing
---
Obviously Kills matter. But I known that I had a bad day right there and my aim would suck, saw it in the two thunts before that Match and saw it in the first two rounds of that match. So why not support my mates with a Shield?
---
Besides that we literally just lost to one them because they started Meta Abuse and glitching in the last round, but whatever. I‚Äôm just questioning how there still can be boosting and pingabuse in an esports title
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôve been told by the players I was with that it‚Äôs been an issue for a while, like 2 years, so after hearing that I just got really discouraged about trying to get to higher ranks, it‚Äôs just annoying when something this big has been an issue for so long without any fixes
---
I guess but what's another 10-20 seconds if you'll be able to have a full team or at least one more player on the squad

I would be happy to explain that to a mute main :D

Ive already made a post about what could be his gadget but to keep it short , you kill someone, you get his data code or that kind of bullshit by "scanning" them like jackal does and you can now "jam" one time the ingame communications and pings of enemies. EVEN JACKAL ONES (clears the effect). It only lasts 5 seconds though and Discord is a thing.

Rather than defending Ubisoft you should also start demanding your money back. Now they have two customers they mistreated and owe money to

I don't pick sides. This is your feud with ubi. You handle it.

And I haven't been disappointed by Ubisoft. I've paid and have gotten what I've asked for. Yes, I've had ups and downs, but over the course of 2 years, I've had a wonderful time.
---
We all face bullsh*t, but I guess it is my personal tolerance level to look past and play on.

You mean 5v5 where everyone is forced to ‚ÄúRoll the dice‚Äù and have a random op? Yeah that‚Äôs a beautiful idea actually

You paid for a game, not a problem

Thanks man
---
Or even just move the spawn location to behind the wall that's already there
---
I just look at the newest section. Seems to work for me.
---
Were you doing this with the camera in the middle? It seems like you're flaring your arms out to avoid bumping into the camera. Great guns though, shame you didn't do the full reload for the magnum.
---
Get a ruler or straight edge
---
Yikes, weeb.
---
That sounds like a pretty neat idea, and it would make sense considering dokka's latest balancing changes in relation to jammers.
---
If you give credits. And if you want a custom one, I also do commissions :)
---
They're already nerfing him
---
I do play with shields. Monty is my third most played operator but i know it won‚Äôt be that big of an issue.
---
no u
---
Unpopular opinion : most elite skins and skins in general ruin the tactical feel of the game
---
Yeah you should fix that link
---
Dunno if it would hit reg buttfuck
---
Yea I heard about that which is why I posted this, in hopes that perhaps ubi sees this before going through with the current nerf since it is still only on tts.
---
Nothing worked. Tried reinstalling uplay and r6s, running both as administrator and verifying files. It worked couple of times when I launched it offline but doesnt seem to work that way anymore. I can see it running on taskmanager but it is taking 0% of my cpu and little bit of memory. Any ideas left?
---
No they didnt lmao, you could just go top to bottom as attack and def couldnt really do shit about it besides spawnpeeking
---
Because the game has Pavlov‚Äôd you into shooting anything vaguely face shaped for numbers that make you happy
---
Mmhmm and what i have seen being suggested all around seems a bit dumb. Why would you want him not to be able to stop roamers? Thats the point of his entire ability so. Make him still be able to do that but if you play on the objectice you're essentially safe from him.
---
Thats why hes better in soloqueue .
---
I also plan on giving him great weapons like an MP7 variant
---
I agree 100%
---
What were you eating?
---
Doc‚Äôs glove are extra tight
---
If it's leaving mid-game that has you riled, then you have to consider people who leave through no fault of their own, however the disconnect happens.  It needs to be balanced.
---
Is there not a scaling ban for early leavers?  I would have thought, like most games, the punishment increases the more you leave on-going matches and takes time to reset.  Something like 15min, then 1 hour, then 6 hours, then 12 hours, then 24 hours for each subsequent early leave, with the reset taking days (potentially many days) to reset back one level.
---
F for that one missing recruit
---
Silenced CZ, silent drone and claymore killer, fast enough fire rate to make up for lost damage, plus you don't get Parkinson disease when you shoot it
---
No surprise.
---
I got a better idea, play ash, run in and kill all 5 because they‚Äôre coppers and have 0 brain cells
---
Thats why hes better in soloqueue . To balance things out , i plan on giving him great weapons like a close brother of the MP7 SMG. 
---
Did i mentionned he also counters jackal ?
---
Still waiting ACOG for R4C.
---
When your graphics is so low like below 100p that you start seeing a backpack as a chanka headgear..
---
What the fuck did you just say. Take it back rn.
---
She has seen and experienced a lot.
---
Caveira is like that

Nope that's how you create a disaster

Switch to more popular servers like eus or wus
---
I dont know man , hes not the silent guy, hes more of a smart , intrusive guy kinda like dokka but without being shy like she is.

You‚Äôll basically get Casual but sometimes less toxicity coming from teammates because most of them try to be serious and more toxicity coming from enemy‚Äôs.
---
Not missing anything really. Ranked is suppose to have a more balanced team skill level but it still has diamond+coppers boosters and cheaters.
---
Yeah the whole region swapping is fine but the ELO matchup should definitely be similar to your primary region rank.
---
EU/AS diamonds shouldn‚Äôt be able to force lose all their placements in US then smurf from the bottom up.

You can see one of them has abandoned like all of their games. Trash.

---
[Jackal guides](https://r6guides.com/guides/jackal/operator-guide)
---
I will definitely try that out! I've never actually been a fan of shotguns, but damn that 870 turned me. 
---
Also i honestly think that the thing i like about the 870 is not the fire rate, just the raw power pr. shot as in the clip.
---
I mean if you have a WiFi connection you can link your PS4 to your phone and play while on the move buy the input lag hurts your soul
---
I need to get this skybox as my desktop wallpaper.
---
I don't think you are missing anything unless you like to play in a competition manner and if you are gonna play ranked do it in a full squad cause you'll get your ass merked easily doing it solo.
---
alright, i'll make a video comparing them for you lol
---
Maybe some sort of  micro satelite  so that if jackal scans the footprints he also gets pinged
---
1. Flash hider reduces recoil while suppressor reduces damage across the board and offers no recoil benefits
---
2. Anyone with a good headset can hear a suppressed gun
---
3. Only if you miss. If you're hitting your opponent then the threat indicator pops back up
---
There's a reason nobody uses suppressors seriously.
---
Please learn to write coherent sentences.
---
Cav is ass.
---
I'm level 88 and I don't play ranked because they don't support my recruit rushes
---
If The turret is mounted to The ground how can there be so much recoil??
---
I would give it a try just to see if you‚Äôll like it or not. Atleast play your placement games.
---
I enjoy playing zofia but all of the ops u want to get are really good
---
I actually kinda like the Spas-12 as her main gun, because using the Deagle with Muzzle Brake is basically the same as having a pocket sniper, so the shotgun serves as a nice wall buster or you can set up a camera and get sick close range kills.
---
F.
---
But it was useless combo
---
Please learn how to read English beacause here a secret for you it is
---
They can't make money off alpha packs that way.
---
Somebody needs to photoshop that onto his head.
---
What's with these bait titles. Says Fuze's AK12 is overpowered and proceeds to recommend suppressor as a barrel attachment and says the gun has "hardly an recoil".
---
Go look up what "coherent" means. One long run on with no punctuation or grammar doesn't qualify.
---
Soon‚Ñ¢

Console I personally use halfway on the slider, and have a setting on my controller to somewhat increase my sensitivity when needed.
---
Gotta work with what I got üíÅ
---
Another take: Keep the ban system how it is but make it an IP or MAC address ban that lasts 12 hours for the first infraction and works its way up to a ban for the rest of the season after a certain amount
---
Yeah...happens when you solo queue

Its all good but why red dot ?

To be  fair,  we're   canonically   in  a  VR simulation,  and I    could see  him goofing around in  practice  scenarios, and   with how much neglect Terro hunt  gets  these  days,  we might  as  well  stop  treating   it  as  canon.
---
Awww that's soooooo cooool!!!
---
Oh no.
---
Thank you
---
I‚Äôd prefer the melee to just do 50hp damage.
---
Echo needed a nerf, im happy with the reduced recovery time.
---
Jackal, in a 3 minute meta, footsteps left behind last for 50-60 seconds which is too long imo. And being tracked 5 times and the entire team can see the ping its certain death. 
---
Not sure about shield hip fire nerf. Make them less useless than they already are? monty and blitz get banned alot anyway.  But i do welcome the dbno state when you melee them
---
like frost's elite

Haha ok, I am yet to unlock ranked so I wouldn‚Äôt have a clue. Just wanted to stick up for my fellow player ü§£ Only been playing Siege for two weeks (irregularly, work and kids make it hard) so I have a little ways to go before I can get involved and start recognising the symbols

---
Mom said it‚Äòs my turn with the canister
---
Oh, I agree, the ~3month cycle between seasons isn't in any way necessary and causes more problems than it solves. The playtesting also sucks, it's mainly because the guys who do the testing aren't really great players, as visible in the "first looks" of a new season, where a bunch of silvers play on xbox (controllers), so I really don't trust them finding out anything of importance. That's why implementing the test server was a great move. Now they need to be allowed to actually listen to the community, specifically the pro players. I feel like the dev team for Siege would do more and better things, if they were not dictated by the higher-ups, which in turn could lead to even more revenue, but since it's not a guarantee, they must obide.
---
Either way, Siege is a great game in a sad state and we can only hope that something is done to help it overcome the difficulties.
---
I like the subtle reference to the baseball team in farcry 5 with the color scheme
---
Seems about right to me.
---
I will definitely try that out today; I'm sure it will be a clusterfuck since i don't play pulse what so every haha. I appreciate the tip here man, thanks :))
---
Okay your motion seems so fluid. Probably your horizontal helps alot with that. 
---
I'm
---
V= 33
---
H= 28
---
RDZ= 8
---
LDZ=6
---
ADS=45
---
Remindme! 1 week
---
13 would be pretty close. ADS should still be 50 as that's a multiplier of your hipfire sens, not a seperate sensitivity.
---
Good idea, but I feel like this would be way to difficult on lower ranks
---
The last recruit is m870 rushing the objective
---
Who else got reminded a lil of payday 2?
---
Agreed. I'm not great at this game, i play with people who have positive K/ds and carry me. However when I changed my mouse sensitivity from 1200dpi to around 400dpi my average k/d gone from 0.51 to 0.84.
---
Though it doesnt seem big compared to those who are on 1.2k/d etc. That small increase shows increased consistancy. You'll always get the smerfs who have better individual k/ds. But its a team game and the intel is key. If that is good then they soon drop and abandon their squad anyway.  Goodluck
---
Dude. You‚Äôre a valk main, you should know how bad of a choice it is to run the SPAS over her MPX, AKA the hs machine
---
I‚Äôve had it be an hour before
---
It‚Äôs not really a montage, but a series of clips. If you‚Äôre trying to make a montage and you‚Äôre stuck on that song then try to align the kills with the bass or something like that. Right now it is a bunch of clips together with music sorry if that sounds harsh
---
You're not alone with this urge...

Wrong only attack recruits have ballistic shields

Hello InternationalSir8, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ceti6p/should_i_get_year_4_pass/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Well, you need to find a gign operator, not any gendarme, and good luck for looting his stuff ^^
---
First, your individual performance doesn't effect how many points you gain/lose.  The only factors are the outcome, how likely (based on the two teams' MMR at the start of the match) that outcome was and your uncertainty value.
---
As to how you lost 180 points, you probably had multiple matches with that hacker in them.  You won two of them (based on the amount lost).  Since all those matches no longer count, you lost the 180 MMR you had gained from those wins.
---
He needs to be in pro league

---
Im not sure if youve played that event or not but at the start if each round a voice comes out of nowhere and says something random and then a female voice comes and says "said black beared/ sledge/ or any other operator"
---
Even as a person that doesn‚Äôt use charms of skins, I would like this
---
Most spawns have a wall anyway, especially on the reworked maps. They should do an update where all the spawns on all maps have a wall added, probably wouldn‚Äôt be too hard to add.
---
TY!
---
Just as a tip, if you watch videos on youtube. Nick ideas you like, angles and positions that different people use that work. And impliment them yourself. So you collect an idea of different plays for different objectives.
---
And it makes matchmaking for people who don't want to communicate that much way less fun.
---
I think they should give the possibility but in a new playlist like the showdown event.
---
~everything~ is a thing
---
The last recruit WAS m870 rushing the objective but 4 seconds into the round and its already 4-5
---
Why sit and wait for half an hour?
---
You played WITH a hacker. Not against. That's why you lost points.
---
1440p prob.
---
1440p. why would I prefer 1080p?
---
I started playin like that so now it‚Äôs just normal to me
---
This should come back.
---
Man you're a lucky guy/gal. I used to play Diablo back in the day (not this D3 garbage) and let me tell you.. US East and most US servers are so screwed it's just wrong.
---
Originally the biggest problem us guys had on these servers were inbound floods of Brazilians who literally did everything they could to not speak English and to terrorize the community. The second batch were extremely heavy ghetto black people who were so racist that they made the KKK look like Mr Roger's best friends. It was fucking surreal.
---
you look like an action figurine
---
looks painful
---
Only candelas if that counts
---
What are the rules at these big conventions for walking around with prop rifles or pistols. 
---
Does it have be obviously fake? 
---
What's stopping somebody from dressing up like....a Halo guy, but with a real rifle made to look fake?
---
Wait so they're arguably nerfing the worst operator on attack by far? Flash nades fit so well with rushing, which is already the only thing she does well, and they were added because of a mistake?
---
Ummmmmm no they don‚Äôt need an additional challenge. They already have so much they have to do that this would just complicate their lives beyond what‚Äôs needed
---
Then fuck off dude. We get it, you‚Äôre a whiny bitch. Get over it or leave.

Ah, not really that familiar with dpi sens conversions, it sounded pretty high to me, but it is pretty close. I‚Äôm constantly changing it up a bit to see if anything else works better for me, but this is what works best for me atm. Once I get a bigger desk I‚Äôll probably lower it further to like 14-14-83, then hopefully below 10-10

Ok thanks I was also thinking Alibi would be cool too

Yee

What leaks?
---
Depends on con!
---
This con was really strict with peacebonding  gun props this year (no airsoft, no replicas, no functioning toys) , and I was stuck at the peacebonding station for a while until they cleared me.  They made me wrap strips of tape around certain parts, but it's totally understandable to have strict rules around firearm replicas

Title got my hyped in the first half, not gonna lie

Morgz mom is as annoying

Please make a timbs skin for the big ops

shotgun aint that bad tho. i run spas to mpx everyday.
---
got plasma pink back then i think
---
Yup, I'm PC. Never had it happened until this season. Been DDOS'ed 5 times - (4) against me in 3-1 rounds and once a random on our team got banned at 2-0, they came back to 3-3 OT and it disconnected. I'm back to playing Apex Legends now. lol
---
Obviously you're just lagging retard
---
Any chance we can have these as separate pngs with transparent backgrounds? These look amazing!
---
Don't talk to me or my son ever again
---
Nokk buff: Octocamo
---
Schei√üe, danke sch√∂n!
---
Honestly this is my favorite of your work keep up the good work
---
Ah, I see you use red dot and angled grip on Mozzie as well...
---
The most dangerous is that if you hit one operator, you will get the aggro of all operator nearby, and they usually move in groups of minimum 5 operators...
---
How
---
Can I get your sensitivity?
---
Imagine how bad the coffe would hurt if it got spilled on your head
---
400 is the half of 800, quick maths half the dpi, double the sens
---
5/5 on 800 = 10/10 on 400, ads sens remains the same
---
I had like 1600dpi with 10 sens back when I started playing now I'm at 9/9/84@400, changing it to 10 sometimes, 11 feels too fast lol idk what happened to me
---
Uhh, well, there is a timer on rejoins. If you wait too long, you can't join back. As for why you didn't get an abandon, maybe first time offender?
---
Again a nice piece of art, Mr. Sausiege.
---
Not just gadget, just give him MP5 or P90
---
It's because they're getting banned basically every match in ranked which is absolutely not what Ubi intended with that feature, so they're trying to figure out ways to fix it.
---
**F**
---
Now kiss ( I whispered)
---
He‚Äôs so situational... What would be a good tweak on him?
---
The results for the bug came in, clash is still among the lowest win rates
---
Yeah, that's why they release completely random changes literally no one asks for, ignore popular one-man-army clutch operators like Ash like they don't fucking exist in their graph, and don't do nothing about shit like balancing a co-op only operator like Lion and Finka for almost (if not more) a year. Great fucking job, so difficult to interact with the players to release actually needed and useful balancing updates.
---
I still want a tactical realism playlist.  And I wish the most talkative ppl on reddit weren‚Äôt also the most smug.
---
Sounds goodüëçüèº thanks my guy
---
It is 100% pulse, not any others
---
You can do that by holding f instead of bashing
---
Ah I remember that challenge I got a legendary duplicate
---
He's a must pick really tho when tactical equipment is used every round pretty much
---
... so thats fucking ANCIENT my dude
---
Give him the MP5 or P90 with acog to at least make him somewhat playable.
---
I don‚Äôt know what they were thinking making him a 1 speed with a meh gun and a very situational gadget.
---
And now with the glaz buff he won‚Äôt even counter glaz through smoke well.
---
Picking an op to help the team is so stupid, rightüòÇ
---
But you can stop worrying about grenades now!
---
What  info do  you  not have with  realistic  magazines?
---
Warden + Nokk need better weapon choices.
---
This is not new news
---
Why dont people ban ash more often her hitbox is small af
---
Cheers mate.
---
Warden should be getting the same treatment as glaz if they dont want him to become irrelevant. The new buff to glaz is going to favor glaz over warden.
---
He was so overpowered when he came out that I didn‚Äôt know his rifle shield could break until he was nerfed.
---
New to me and I am rank 68 ranked silver 4
---
Not even the german cats
---
I think it's a little weak because people will learn to crouch a lot but you could then find them like an alarm but maybe if it did a little damage or concussed them
---
" We would like to increase N√∏kk‚Äôs performance and to make her slightly more efficient." - Give her a better primary?
---
it's not so much a buff as almost completely undoing the nerf. Now it just amounts to you can't \*quite\* run and gun with him. He is mostly back to prior Glaz...
---
He was running the s i l e n c e r
---
This is what happens when you don't give new operators new guns nobody wants to play as them, As for Warden he needs a major change.
---
Personally I've never used it outside of T hunt or custom, but my cousin refuses to use anything else for her or Echo, and he does pretty good with it too.  Despite it being possibly the worst shotgun in the game.
---
I don't. I dropped it more than a year ago lol
---
I've had like the tabs at the bottom say I've already owned things I've never owned before but not notifications like that
---
He‚Äôs the only operator who can stop projectiles, until they add a similar operator his pick rate will stay high. No nerfs needed
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
That‚Äôs not the problem I don‚Äôt care about you playlist. I‚Äôm talking about the pro league aspect side of it. You clearly don‚Äôt have any or at the very least only a small amount of experience with r6 pro league and don‚Äôt understand how bad this would be if implemented into pro league
---
When Siege reaches 100 op mark games will be 10 v 10 haha
---
I think so too but his pick rate goes up every season, they might interpret differently
---
I'd rather trade bad gadget for good gun
---
I play on 90 H , 55 V, and 100 ADS (also console) and i have no fucking clue what this mate plays on
---
Warden still needs a buff.
---
Makes sense.
---
It's because pick-and-ban was implemented this season and those two are almost always banned, so ubi is trying to make them not an auto-ban. 
---
But with bomb-only ranked, Echo (the one operator who can completely stop a plant) will always be on the banned list.
---
This is a really good cosplay. I don't like twitch because shes annoying to play on defense but this is a really accurate cosplay and I love it.
---
They won‚Äôt.
---
That bench was looking at him funny
---
It's usually depends on the attachments you have put on your guns my recommendation is pick you favorite op with acog and text the difference between muzzle attached but do 3 t hunt then switch then 3 more then switch and so on untill you get a feel for acog also tapping is ok with acog you don't have to spray
---
When do we get to see analysis of the changes to Ranked?  Blue/Orange team win rates?
---
I feel like as more people play on ranked they get more and more desperate. Hooray for being a console player lmao
---
I'm messing with OP because his post is lazy. 
---
Sometimes Reddit is weird and I got downvoted, it happens.
---
German recruits have access to the M870, no the french.

---
3 traps is severe. If it were up to me I would just remove the markers for where each one is so it‚Äôs harder to know which one went off and where the attacker is
---
I agree, the fact you lose all ability when moving strongly deterred me from choosing him. Especially when it takes so long to come back.

The only thing that came to my mind when I saw it was "epic dawg". Then I had to check if the username and the watermark matched because upvoting stolen art is a crime.
---
Once Blossom's mines go off, Blossom gets an alert, like Ela Grzmot mine or Kapkan Traps, also when the mines go off, they create noise so the other defenders know that one goes off. If an attacker is crouching and the mine goes off, they get Tinnitus, like if you were standing close to a detonating breach charge
---
What about people like cav or buck where there weapon is their gadget?
---
90V + 100ADS on console? Impossible without MnK.
---
Not a fan of this idea, honestly, I want them to add new things with events, not re-use older content.
---
Do not underestimate the FMG-9. It was one of the first guns I mained and besides that it has a DPS of 400 until 17 meters which is higher than Valk's MPX or the MP5 of the French Duo
---
Maybe just do base operators then
---
I feel that, I‚Äôm in the same boat.
---
Try playing Payday, you'll quickly know where every camera in a building is within a minute.

Don't use MnK

would be pretty cool yeah, but imagine jager acog again.

platform?

Ubi would like to hire you, NOW.
---
I keep the reflex on for aesthetic
---
Alright that makes more sense, otherwise you'll just ADS all over the place :')
---
So cool, definitely gona use the tunics cube if you don‚Äôt mind:)
---
I would definitely use the base ops first and see who you like best. Then, based on who you like you can have a better idea about which dlc op to get.
---
why not?
---
Any other weapon with an ACOG would be a good start. Everything about him is bad even though he's my favorite OP design wise.
---
Y do that in casual tho
---
Knowing them, the hat is 90% able to shoot through. You're visible but it can also lead to many people trying to headshot and realize thats not a part of your head too late.

While the nerfs to Jackal are not as bad as I feared, I do worry that the number of Operators that are hard counter to a Hyper Agressive Defender team (You know, the ones that always spawnpeek, always roam instead of defend the objective, etc) are starting to dwindle/become ineffective. I worry that soon, the meta for the defending team will be, "Forget defending, Everyone is roaming now".
---
I do admit that the Attackers that have been problematic did need the nerfs. Dokkaebi and Lion to name a few. But with every season, I see more and more players just run off to try and spawn peek or roam, leaving the objective completely unguarded. I've even won several games by simply sneaking onto objective while the enemy team is on the other side of that map.
---
Guess that's why Bomb is considered the only "Skillful" or "Professional" game mode, since no one actually needs to defend the objective.
---
I'm honestly fine with a lot of the changes they are doing. I just worry that we are on a slippery slope to a meta where defenders roam and rush instead of defending, because any operater who is a " hard counter" to that playstyle has now become unplayable.
---
there's always that one teammate
---
Ideally there should be zero recoil, after all that is the purpose of a tripod
---
Oh yeah you‚Äôre right shit
---
Dude must just be an idiot
---
Wouldn‚Äôt doubt it
---
Looks like alibi to me
---
You really think they just look at the graph only and not delve deeper into how an operator is being received?
---
Lol yea.
---
Console squad
---
It‚Äôs fine people mix em up often
---
Putting reflex, holo or red dot on a weapon that has an AKOG triggers me.
---
Ok Still unacceptable that a game this big can have such shitty servers.
---
Lion + smonk = lonk
---
Yesss
---
definitely check out u/NiggerFaggotJew
---
I‚Äôll try to do a magnum reload, it‚Äôs REALLY hard to operate a speedloader with gloves on.
---
The biggest problem with him is he's basically broken no matter what.  Let's say you're defending the basement of consulate a spot where he would be a legitimate threat.
---
Attackers open both sides of the garage, smoke it off and move in for the plant.  They could be side white, front white, front black or possibly in the middle of they're crazy.  
---
Fortunately you have Warden, so you pop on your gadget and start moving into position to stop the plant.  Except your gadget can't see shit because you're moving and the cool down time after you stop moving is too long to prevent the plant.
---
So if they buff him and make it so his gadget can see through smoke no matter what he might border on OP in the right situation.
---
He's in a spot like Tachanka where making him viable would potentially make him too strong or change him too fundamentally.
---
Instead of trying to hit 100 ops they need to delete a few broken ops and try again.
---
A fat T-Rex
---
Its German lul

Sounds fun

You also forgot the huge tits and giant ass that the people in this sub lust for. Can you draw another one with big BAZONGAS and a hearty pooper?
---
ITT: people who put frost traps in obvious places so they get instantly spotted and destroyed
---
Run away, run away very fast! 
---
On a serious note I‚Äôm fairly newish, had the game a few months, play newcomer to start getting some basic map knowledge, unlock as many non DLC OPs as you can before paying for DLC. Watch some streamers on twitch and YouTube like varsity gaming, king George and get flanked to help with callouts. Remember this is a highly destructible environment. So you can get shot from 360 degrees and if you don‚Äôt already get a mic and decent headset because half of this game is the sound stage to hear walking, reloading, rappelling the list goes on. And make callouts to your teammates, lack of information will make you lose. But in the beginning just have fun.
---
I love listening to different languages it amazes me .. german is one of my favorites I'm hoping to add a third language after English maybe Spanish or French cause German seems hard lol

Did you play a 5v1?
---
LOLOLOL LORD TACHANKA FUNNY XD
---
Okay, instead of making any points, just discredit your opponent and say they aren‚Äôt qualified to have an opinion, lmao. 
---
I didn‚Äôt even mention his pickrate, genius. I just said he‚Äôs an obvious pick and added plenty of reasons why. 
---
I laid out why I believe nerfing his gun would make defense have an interesting choice between him and a better fragger. Currently teams during pick phase are basically like ‚Äúwe should bring Jager because he has the best gun and we need his gadget. We would literally be stupid to pick 5 other operators over him.‚Äù That is stale and nerfing him so other ops get a little more love would be healthy for the game as a whole.
---
n...no?
---
well i have nothing against ur opinion but i think u already noticed that u are in the minority with that &gt;.&gt;
---
Wow. That is the most perfect timing I have ever seen.

I get kills with hip fire frequently. Doesn‚Äôt need a buff.

On a brief side note, to anyone saying blitz is OP- just look at where he is and reassess your skill.
---
100% agreed, I‚Äôve settled on reflex sights, I only use ACoG if I know I‚Äôm gonna be shooting long distance, but I get tunnel vision up close so I don‚Äôt use it often.
---
My legendary alpha pack was the alpha pack charm... I was pissed
---
Due to your spawnpeeking Ubisoft came out of Olympus to smite you personally.
---
On a related note, stop spawnpeeking, if you get spawnpeeked, you get mad, don‚Äôt inflict the same on people who did nothing to deserve it.
---
Whoops, my apologies.
---
Because it's part of what makes him a must pick. Removing 1 will still make him very strong, but he won't be  able to cover everything like I said
---
Ehh people used to think those stupid solid gold guns were amazing in cod but the reality is people only liked them to flex the rarity not that it looked good
---
True
---
Although you would see a significant drop in abandons if deranking did not give people an advantage of copper boosting.

Holy shit

But what kind of situation? I rarely ever get any even at point blank

Perfect changes. Keeps them relevant but removes some of the bullshit. Echo‚Äôs sonic concussion blast is the longest lasting and direct defender effect and I absolutely despise it. I would honestly be happy with 6 seconds, but 7 is a good place for now. 
---
MAVERICK
---
* 		Changed Maverick‚Äôs blowtorch sound to a louder one.
---
I think this is going to hinder his pick-rate a lot in higher ranks, but in lower ranks this is a great nerf for him. Hopefully in game it seems balanced.
---
I think it's both answers you have been given.  Pick and ban shows that for Jackal for instance he's a super annoying operator like Blitz/Monty despite not actually being that strong.
---
Combined with the META shift.  The idea of constantly nerfing and buffing players based on how well they're doing in a season is such a fundamentally flawed concept that it leads to a ripple affect where you make someone who might have been just ok last season the most powerful op in the game, so you nerf and cause that with someone else, and so on.
---
They don't nerf using *just* pick rates. That is the data they only show us. They nerf using win Deltas and in certain cases pro opinions.
---
However, abnormally high pick rates is still....well....abnormal, and hence, unacceptable. Nobody should be so dominant.
---
If it were real I would main... Instant. Honestly if Lesion's elite set was him naked with bubbles at his crotch and the mines were rubber ducks that made the rubber ducky noise... I would be much happier.
---
Who the fuck bans clash?
---
They should have given this to sledge so he could have a baseball bat as his sledge, they missed an amazing opportunity...
---
I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt refund season pass. He is such an awful boring character. N√∏kk isn‚Äôt that great but at least has some viability.
---
At the end he ascended into heaven
---
Nope, it's a button and that's it. Reporting people without video evidence does fuck all in this game.
---
Why? This isn't Apex legends. You are supposed to ads to kill.
---
an Ubi rep on this sub said that specifically, I'm not lying
---
Also that‚Äôs bucks worse gun
---
I have xbox so I can‚Äôt do it. But it‚Äôs nice if you‚Äôre playing ranked and suddenly have to do something that might kick you
---
Basically, they‚Äôre really screwed up. The odds are not what they should be. I will put below my results from alpha packs recently and how I got them:
---
Regular packs from playing, opened after logging out and back in, live server: 13 straight commons.
---
Payed for packs opened straight away live: 4 straight rares
---
Payed for pack opened straight away tts: 1 uncommon
---
Payed for opened after logging out and back in, live: 1 uncommon
---
I know that rewards *should be granted with the pack* and thus logging out should have no effect.
---
I have two possible outlooks:
---
1. It is an honest bug. 
---
This is what I am hoping for. Everyone knows there can be some problems when changes are made and who knows how something could happen. 
---
2. Ubisoft tried to change odds in order to sell premium packs and renown boosters. 
---
I‚Äôm leaning away from this one, despite thinking there may be something slightly malicious hanging about. Anyway, the idea is that you slightly increase odds on payed (non-premium) packs and decrease odds on earned packs enough to inspire a subconscious idea, but not a conscious belief that the payed packs are better. This would probably increase the sales of renown boosters. In fact, it‚Äôs well known some streamers use these to get lots of alpha packs. 
---
Reasons this is a stupid belief: someone would notice (ex. crazies like me), a lot of people buy them already probably who would be influenced, and the whole concept is kinda weak. 
---
Anyway, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a bug that no one is noticing, but I like to put the alternative out just in case. 
---
Do you know what I should do, since I don‚Äôt even know where to begin...
---
No, I KNOW they have more information to work off of. Information that they never share with us, which leads to false speculation and conclusions from the charts. Either release charts per map or per site, or don't release them at all.
---
only problem with that is I'm pretty sure if they add a new sight to a gun every operator with that gun gets to have it. put it on the mp5k and you buff Mute. buffing Kapkan and Tachanka wouldn't be too bad though
---
For 2-3, it be way more severe than that
---
Bruh üÜëÔ∏èüÖ∞Ô∏èüÜéÔ∏è
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt expect them to really get much of anything but i guess the only time to hipfire is for frost traps and hard corners or through walls huh
---
his aim is better then mine anyways
---
Its not he moved his forearm is bleeding
---
I love you!
---
with new deag buff, I only run deag/spas. Its incredible powerful.
---
I hate teammates who do that shit
---
Damn, the balance got thrown to hell this patch.  Compare this to [last season's chart](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-347920-16/y4s13-designers-notes) and wow, so many ops are out of line.
---
Jager needs a nerf at this point.  He's played in 3/4 rounds and has a high win rate, Ash and Twitch got nerfed for less egregious stats.  I know so many of his fans are incapable of realizing he's overpowered, but the numbers don't lie.  His gadget is the sole thing that counters projectiles, something has to change whether that be reducing the number of projectiles he can block, the types of projectiles he can block, nerfing his guns, or otherwise making his gadget easier to play around.
---
Adding another defender that can block projectiles is what a lot of people seem to want, but they're forgetting that you can run both that defender and Jager.  How much worse could something like that be for the health of the game?  It's something that has to be considered, or we'll end up like now where we have a bunch of defenders bringing extra cams.
---
Fair enough
---
i want a playlist with all the old/ unplayable maps: hereford, clubhouse, bartlett, and kafe
---
Just buy buck I'm pretty sure he's only 10000
---
I love the non-lethal melee shield change, we are playing a shooter not a fucking medieval sim.
---
Yeah tbh, I float between Plat 3 and Gold 4, and even the difference between Gold 3 and Gold 2 is insane. It‚Äôs like what you‚Äôd expect the difference between Gold and Plat to be.
---
Im laughing at the new dlc ops pick rate along with glaz's, the devs were on crack when balancing these dudes
---
Love how they ignore warden completely
---
What platform do you play on?
---
PC
---
now add a suitable weapon to nokk and she will be played :)
---
Click their heads lmao
---
shit happened to me yesterday, guy on the other team accused my 4 stack of ddosing but we all lagged out doesnt make sense üòÇ
---
Would you consider IQ‚Äôs machine gun a useful black ice? I very rarely use her but it‚Äôs my only black ice
---
I don't understand why Ubi won't touch the 416-C stats. Why does a 3 speed defender with a crucial gadget need a 43@740 rifle that's straight up better than many attacker weapons? I wouldn't mind seeing go down to anywhere from 36-39 damage.
---
Warden should have been an alternative to J√§ger, maybe we'll get one in Y4S4. That will decrease his pick rate drastically
---
Idk why but this image looks like one of those images that‚Äôs completely generated by AI to me. 
---
Very awesome cosplay though! Impressed that you actually got the Famas wrapped with the same skin.
---
Ah then I probably can't help you. But a lot of people practice and grind it out in thunt for hours on end. Then some cheaters use mouse attachments and things but I wouldn't do that
---
This makes me remember one of my best smoke plays back when I was \~lvl 20. I used the smoke not to get the kill but for area denial - to give me defusing time &amp; space.
---
yeah well i actually liked them lol, i personally think that skins overall are underwhelming in r6s, since black ice isnt actually THAT nice compared to other games skins (i have no game in my mind so pls dont ask which games T.T ). 
---
I personally want the diamond skin but im sadly way too retarded cuz i always spend them on ops and packs  :v
---
Not really you gotta think at the bigger picture..why would you want to get someone banned for 1 month..for leaving 2-3 games that‚Äôs just to much...I‚Äôve only left like 3 ranked games this season due to having to do things around the house or go out with the fam. But I feel like 2 abandons a day is perfect for a day ban.
---
I just saw a post in r/shittyrainbow6 that says 'i want to fuck twitch'
---
Not surprised tbh, only the 416 and G52 were the good ones.
---
I want my dogtags charms back ffs, at least I use those when I don't have a chibi.
---
I really don't think so, I mean all they have to do is browse this sub and they'd find at least 10 new ideas that could actually work. I think they just phoned it in this season. from what I read Ubi pulled devs from Seige to work on the new Ghost Recon at the time they were making this season
---
It was from u/I_wanna_fuck_twitch
---
The big problem wish echo isn't that his blast lasts so ling... It's that he can single handedly disorient multiple people, stop plants and can do so a few times per drone... With 0 risk to himself.
---
It‚Äôs a solid buff. 4 shots in total with drones in 2 separate places
---
This should just be a weekly challenge
---
I hate that you have to stay still to se throught smoke, it makes him even less useful.
---
Yes it is pretty hard I guess lul 
---
But on the other hand if you're able to speak German it's pretty easy to learn Dutch! 
---
That's what i'm doing right now
---
If she ever gets an elite skin, hopefully it'll include some sort of hair-style like they did with Pulse.
---
ThanksüòÅ
---
Thank you everyone for your advice &amp; tips! :)
---
Same
---
Here's hoping.
---
Update your tag 92 dream team is now called Luminosity Gaming and I thought the same thing
---
I dunno man, I really don't see them hitting that "100 OPs" list without a lot of mediocre OPs
---
This, let warden move when using the gandget.
---
No u can‚Äôt really
---
if you ever use that gun make sure to use iron sights, you won‚Äôt regret it
---
This is fucking amazing.
---
You can Still ask to get great servers and its easier to do that if its a big company dont you understand?

If you don't wear skins like this you're a pussy

Also he doesnt have a good scope.

did you only buy the recruit pin?
---
Happy Cake day!
---
That looks like Godzilla roaring into the sky
---
Yeah it was 10 bucks for one and it was the only recruit pin I saw
---
If only you were level 123
---
It's about camouflaging for hundredths of a second, not seconds.
---
jackal nerf is bad and will not make him much less of a pain to be up against. going from tracked for 25 seconds to 20 dont change much at all. 5 pings where ok. but the time between tracks where too long for it to be useful and prevented stationary play for way to long. i think it would be rather reasonable for the ping to be 2 seconds apart with 5 ping resulting in a much more reliable but only 8 second track.

As good as that would be, they cant use glocks due to copyright issues or some other shit
---
Saying he has no strengths is simply not true, although he is extremely situational. I won't disagree with you about the MPX though since you are right if we're talking weapon statistics. All I'm saying is that he doesn't need an ACOG, he needs a speed increase. Everyone in this thread is screaming for him to get an ACOG.
---
The problem is that the risk with trying to take out a trap should be getting shot by a defender, not losing out to the trap you're trying to destroy.  
---
Kapkan for example has to be placed in such away that you can shoot it from the other side of the doorway, save for if there's a deployable shield in the way.  In order for Lesion's gu mines to go off, the attacker basically needs to be on top of it.  As a result, despite it's cloaking, it needs to be placed in a spot where there is going to be line of sight on it.  Claymores have their big red lasers indicating where they are, and their activation zone is only those lasers.  So if they're close enough that they'll be set off from going out the door or window, they can be destroyed from a single impact grenade, or even angling yourself just right.  
---
The only trap that sort of breaks that rule are Ela's Grzmots.  But they can be such an exception because they don't deal damage, just a debuff, so there's not really a risk of setting one off to begin with unless there's already opposing players nearby one.  
---
The problem with welcome mats was that the risk could have been minor, it just being a single trap with no defenders nearby, but the attacker still could have lost because if wasn't consistent.
---
Gridlocks gadget is so strong once u get the diffuser down it literally gets ridiculous how strong those spike things are
---
English is easy because you can use ‚Äúthe‚Äù for everything, but German uses ‚Äúder‚Äù, ‚Äúdie‚Äù and ‚Äúdas‚Äù. Spanish has 2 ‚Äúel‚Äù and ‚Äúla‚Äù. I‚Äôm from South America so I speak Spanish
---
&gt;Now able to rotate 360¬∞ 
---
So old tachanka, but with a shield?
---
A lot of people pay for these mediocre OPs though. I didn't buy the s4 pass... But if I did, I'd feel boned by this season. And "we moved people to the new ghost recon game" isn't really going to make up for it lol
---
speed should be none
---
Semi autos use to be broken, they are now in a perfect place. Pump actions will suck for you if you miss your first shot. I've been shotgun rushing alot and I've been wiping people out. I got 2 aces with them yesterday so shotguns, to me, are viable
---
So I'm no pro either, but these moments were too stupidly funny not to share. The first clip is long, but it gets snappy afterwards. I couldn't think of a good outro, so I've just dumped a voice-chat-based derp :)
---
It looks like lion
---
And I.Q. is about equal on win loss. It is odd that clash and IQ are not positive win delta with the glitches that came out. 
---
Maybe in matches when players encounter them glitched the enemy team just ddos's them. But that would result in an neutral win delta.
---
yhea seriously pre nerf glaz wasnt that bad. honestly.
---
This happened to me and i couldnt shoot and run
---
I'm joking. R6 ranked is broken beyond hell.
---
I love my team but I want callouts like that during clutch time
---
Oh, it definitely has its place don't get me wrong. On bomb it's great...if the walking fridge woman isn't dead before plant :p
---
The purpose of her mat is to catch people who don't pay attention to their surroundings. Before the "nerf", you could easily get caught in her mat even if you knew where it was because sometimes you just couldn't destroy it under a window when you vaulted, hence it was kind of broken.
---
Right now, if you don't pay attention, you get caught but if you are aware, you can destroy it 100% of the time which is the intended purpose.
---
Their effectiveness is exactly the same.
---
What?
---
That shield nerf is the most pointless change in the history of Rainbow 6
---
You don't
---
Welcome to Siege
---
I have never seen such a downvoted comment with 2 golds awarded lmao
---
Okay so to me, I main Hibana/Echo with the Supernova. I‚Äôll range from having outstanding rounds, to rounds where I‚Äôll insta-die. Times where I dome somebody point blank and they drop stone dead, and times where I dome somebody the same way, and do less than a block of damage. That‚Äôs the inconsistency I‚Äôm talking about. Whatever it factors in there, I do not know. But mann...
---
Hello Clone276, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cexqgl/ranked_unplayable/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Would it make a difference though? Afk teammate in your game vs afk dude out of game
---
Its easier to play 2 men down than it is to play with 2 teammates chipping away at your health and destroying all your gadgets.
---
So... its the teammates faults not yours?
---
Very good picture, nice! Hostages also like this!
---
You cant
---
Lmao so true
---
They suck and should never ever be back in ranked!
---
I usually play on PS4 and do quite well.
---
Recently upgraded my PC and can finally game on it but these lobbies have been some of the worst teammates ever. Team killing, leaving matches, afk etc...
---
Really just seems like you dont play well enough to counter them. They have plenty of counters and it can be easy to flank them to get the kill. Learn to play any trap op and they aren't an issue. Learn to play defensively against shields. Plus you ever play Blitz? It's very hard to be good at him with how you get focused and how janky shields can be, Monty is a little easier but you still need to rely on your teammates or 9/10 times you'll lose. The one hit melee is a great punishment for letting the shield close the distance, there is plenty you can do to keep them at a distance.
---
Omg the second idiot ran in front of the gun even after the first idiot got a haircut making that mistake. 
---
Much like road safety, it takes two people being careless to cause a default-cam-shooting TK. If you‚Äôre shooting, you need to get inside position on anyone else running alongside you, and if you‚Äôre sprinting from spawn, you need to expect shots being fired at cams and keep your distance from an ADSd teammate.
---
Defender has a shield that has a fire spread effect if broken
---
I do agree that there needs to be an attacker that can do something with the floor from underneath. I don't know what exactly but something. 
---
Maybe just a dude that carries a ladder so fuze can fuze from below or so Maverick can burn from the bottom.
---
Obviously not really that though a great April fool's operator would be a guy with a step stool lol.
---
or, as many people have tried to present. He is a character, who just like caviera (often banned as well), is someone who can punish uncoordinated play or "the bad random". Average ranked play is full of solo and duo queue players, and this causes people to ban ops who can punish that reality. In a 5 stack, people are much less likely to ban jackal or cav as they can coordinate much better and prevent them from being punishing
---
Next seasons attacker. Already leaked.
---
As a Cav fan, I tried Nokk and found her really underwhelming. I think she needs some attention indeed.
---
Ok yeah I change my mind abit. I was using hibanas shotgun alot and I definitely see what you mean. You have to be precise as fuck with that thing, it doesnt help that it also has a bad recovery time too. Compared to other pump actions the supernova kind of sucks.
---
I bought the pack for them with the dark green camo for that exact reason.
---
Double sad face rip Narancia
---
I personally really like Ela's shotgun. Kicks a lot, but the fire rate is absurd. If you play Ela right, taking attackers by surprise is so easy with that shotgun.
---
Ah, another Russian Badger fan I see
---
Lol yeah man I‚Äôm that self centered.
---
I am on eu, us is easy mode with that 110 ping advantage
---
Why?
---
I want it so much
---
Bruh
---
Better than duplicate 417
---
My first thought was " Remember - no Russian"
---
Originally I thought this was post nerd so I thought he didn't like were they ended up and I was fine by it so no my point was not his
---
I see someone likes Boba Fett a lot :D
---
Reason he was nerfed was because the fragging capability with smokes using the thermal scope and his high powered rifle made him too strong. They did do it a bit too harsh, but the most recent buff should put him into being more balanced.
---
Agree. I‚Äôd like more maps in ranked if they got reworked. Although if I had to pick maps to get reworked first I would say Chalet and Skyscraper since they are already in ranked (even though they shouldn‚Äôt be) because those maps haven‚Äôt aged well and need some major improvements because the metas on those maps aren‚Äôt fun to play with those maps being attacker favored being the major problem. Thank god we are getting a Kanal rework next season though, I absolutely despise that map and I would love for it to have a redemption story and come back better then ever.
---
Nah, just wanted to show everyone the wall that keeps haunting me to this very day with its evil smile
---
I'd like more detail on how pick and ban figures into the statistics? If an operator is banned, which is the formula that is used?
---
**A)** Every round of that match counts as a no-pick for the operator 
---
**B)** Those matches are removed from consideration entirely?
---
For example,
---
**Before pick and ban**
---
1. In Game 1, Jackal is picked 4/5 rounds
---
2. In Game 2, Jackal is picked 0/5 rounds
---
3. Following these games, Jackal's pick rate would be 40% (4/10 rounds).
---
**With pick and ban, Case A**
---
2. In Game 2, Jackal **is banned** and is therefore picked **0/5 rounds.**
---
3. Following these games, Jackal's pick rate would be the same as above: 40% (4/10 rounds).
---
**OR**
---
**With pick and ban, Case B**
---
1.  In Game 1, Jackal is picked 4/5 rounds
---
2. In Game 2, Jackal **is banned** and is therefore picked **0/0 rounds.**
---
3. Following these games, Jackal's pick rate would be 80% (4/5 rounds).
---
True but that‚Äôs just something I always check for I‚Äôm just saying the having a bright headgear makes spotting and shooting them easier
---
Le gas. He gasses people. Why isn't the smoke elite German?
---
There‚Äôs been two occasions where I almost had an ace but was vote kicked by the 4 stack I was playing with because fuck me.
---
UBI, could post Maverick blowtorch sound for single "poof".
---
I think I‚Äôve seen this before
---
It‚Äôs gold. That‚Äôs not even a high rank, you usually can get low to high gold during placement matches.
---
Where is everybody getting these stickers? I need one
---
It doesn't help that it's more difficult than many other games to make out an enemy from their background. There's just something about siege that makes it such that distinguishing is harder.
---
lmao, like the csgo chat is any better
---
Because Hitler wasn‚Äôt German and that‚Äôs a very good Way to have your game boycotted
---
Mira has possibly the most game changing defense gadget compared to Warden's whose gadget is (in my experience) used once every few rounds.
---
Lol yeah I posted it before but it only got 1 upvote so I deleted it.
---
Cringe as fuck.
---
Are you 10.
---
I'll confirm ability to reproduce and get some of the players from my Discord to do the same.
---
They should have a mode where you can swap guns in the middle of a game
---
I know i just took a break and i don't want to try to get gold again
---
they should have made his glasses work yings glasses. just a passive resistence to flash, and his toggle is to see through smoke without the damn movement penalty but shorter duration and/or longer cooldown.
---
Can you shoot his gas can and make him explode?
---
So uhhhhh... Recruit still banned from ranked..? What did us recruit mains do to deserve this..? :(
---
If people used IQ more they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about Echo ever again. Jackal on the other hand I kinda hate is getting negative feedback as he is one of my favorite ops to play. I just hope they don‚Äôt go too far in nerfing either of them because I love playing Echo as well because he requires a certain finesse to use.
---
I always wrote penis on the walls with my friends. Real mature, I know
---
Because he‚Äôs British. 
---
This is a dumb comment.
---
uncultured normie
---
Warden is the worst dlc defender and n√∏kk is the worst dlc attacker. Lmao
---
Killcam is always bit wonky, you probably hit him in the head before the shield was raised back up.
---
This
---
Ohhhhhh
---
i played him intentionally maybe twice after the nerf and came to the conclusion that his yellow tint actually makes people blend in way more unless its fully charged. and thusly is fucking garbage now even with the new drop off.
---
I have played Cs for two years never had a issue
---
People do a lot to crap on ‚Äúcomfort bans‚Äù like Jackal, Echo, and even Cav, but why would a team not want to increase their margin for error? Jackal is my most played attack op by close to 10 hours and I still feel better when he‚Äôs banned knowing I won‚Äôt get trackaled.
---
Well then don‚Äôt...it‚Äôs just a pointless game achievement. Although, I feel most people should earn this by simply playing the game.
---
THE ONE DAMN TIME I DONT HAVE ACCESS TO SIEGE
---
The description says 1 year anniversary that's why
---
What are they doing to buff him?
---
that is what i hate with esport games, they balance far to much around the pro scene. removal of iq nades is the best example. one of the few things that actually made her viable. now she is most of the time just a fragger without a gadget.
---
Sorry. Just so you know, in the settings there is an option to turn off pc chat, and you can also mute everyone who‚Äôs toxic by going to the scoreboard and clicking the microphone icon.
---
Yikes
---
you forgot to use the same clip
---
I just want to 100% the game
---
Because the challenge in the screenshot is from last year
---
On a forgotten planet in the universe a soft cry is heard: " what? Stairs!? NNOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"
---
We all know that is a lie, so you can stop doing that now.
---
You have comfort bans and strategic bans like banning Mav on Club House or banning Thatcher on Oregon. I think both are justified however.
---
Well, then why don‚Äôt you wanna play it? If you enjoy the game, you‚Äôll earn gold eventually.
---
Hahaha
---
Alpha packs could be an exception considering you cant spend real money on them
---
Bruh if shit like this gets upvoted I got like 1,000,000 karma waiting for me on my PC
---
I thought it was current and ubi made a dumb mistake or something because people were acting like it was new or something haven't played siege in over a year so ya
---
Meh its just a game honestly. None of this ranked crap even matters.
---
They don‚Äôt need any more help it‚Äôs already scuffed enough sometimes
---
Lol people in plat cheese more than anyone else. Anything to get closer to diamond.  
---
That said, I didn't see it too much, but I certainly saw it every day.
---
He's definitely counterable. People are just lazy or want cool new abilities to do so.
---
Shield change is really really stupid
---
Yea they are, this could have been funny.
---
Could be worse. Could be a lot worse.
---
and when they are picked they slow down the enemy team quite abit or they will be penalized for it.
---
On which platform, genius?
---
Servers are down for most people
---
Not Funny. Didn‚Äôt Laugh.
---
Whaaat? I personally adore the animation.
---
Haha okay that's pretty good mate :D
---
do you know when will it go back up?
---
Servers are wack for everyone right now
---
Sniping on bank was so satisfying.
---
He doesn‚Äôt need a nerf he needs a rebalance maybe decrease time in between location pings and maybe reducing the time in which footprints are effective and reduce the cool down slightly
---
Okay wait.. why is this a Legendary ???
---
damn that sucks, but it started for me around the time the update come out, does that have anything to do with it you think?
---
Hello JavierRodriguezzz, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cezo0t/am_i_the_only_one_having_connection_issues/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yes, not impractical at all
---
I don't think any changes really need to be made. People just need to get better at the game. There is no reason to ban these two operators so often, other than being bad at the game.
---
The best Alibi strats I‚Äôve seen is, she puts her 3 holograms in each corner of the room and she stands in the last corner. So funny when the enemy sees it and turns and runs.. then peeks and takes a shot at 1, peeks and shoots another lol by the 3rd peek he‚Äôs dead. 
---
And one that‚Äôs happened to me, she puts a hologram behind like a crate or something that covers her from the hip down. Enemy peeks and shoots it, then hides while being pinged. Meanwhile Alibi was crouched next to it, and just stands up and stands on it. The enemy comes in the room thinking he‚Äôs okay and boom dead.
---
Spawn peeking is not douchey or toxic, it requires simple droning.

Less movement penalty. Not as good as he was, but maybe weak end of viable.
---
Buuurrn
---
Try again, Siege is working for me now
---
The lord is disappointed that you don‚Äôt take screenshots
---
That's actually so nice. I love how you've done the f2
---
Thank you! :)
---
Nope
---
They released hard counter to Ying and Glaz while nerfed them both. Ah, goobisoft.
---
Seems like you‚Äôd be doing God‚Äôs work.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize she was glitched, I just assumed the Six12 was just that bad lol
---
Bad smoke
---
There is a scaling ban.
---
No but seriously how does she even see?
---
The TTS does not represent the community. It only represents five per cent of PC players that play it for one hour and then never touch it again
---
it should be obvious these charts are useless as soon as you see kapkan as "too strong". Stop balancing around this robotic garbage and learn how your game works.
---
Is this a recent update
---
Ash does not need more nerfs. I'd prefer it if they nerfed her recoil and gave her back the acog though. Remove her Vertical grip?

Yea I mean when lion came out he was op so every time he got picked to get banned that's why the need his ban rate was too high but recruit has a lot of loadouts so he is op also they removed him from rank probaly

Did you remove fog from your files to cheat?

Click the 3 dots, go to flair, click edit on the top. It‚Äôll show :operator name: just type in the same thing with whoever you want. Idk the limit but I‚Äôve seen people with up to 6. Plus you can type in whatever you want for a little text next to it
---
Ya but that extra hit means Blitz will have is back exposed longer. It will definitely slow down the Blitz players that run like crazy and get melee kills.
---
holy shit
---
Ubi does not like RNG. Siege should always be a tactical shooter
---
bullet sponges
---
Isn't he a bit lower than Chanka in term of winrate? lol indeed
---
Got em, pineapple head
---
Yes, I play on Xbox and the shotgun is 10x better then the SMG primaries.

Ubisoft gives you a stats email at the end of each season from which you could copy it

A smart defending team will immediately be on cams at the start of the round identifying who the attackers are and where they're coming from. It \*is\* important to kill those cams quickly once you enter their field of view, and you should 1000% be expecting that you're teammates are going to want to shoot those cams. If you obliviously sprint in front of someone who is ADSd in the direction of a cam, you share at least half of the blame (if not more).
---
If this happened to me in ranked I would lose it.
---
Edgy Echo bout to snipe your only hard breacher
---
Imagine how much terrain destruction they'd be by the end it's be awesome
---
Gotta love the chat from them. Trying to justify rank boosting as if they have any skill at all. Rainbow 6 will die if they don‚Äôt fix this soon.
---
Can easily one tap him or finished off by a teammate. The idea made more sense when getting picked up brought you back to 50 instead of 20.
---
Whaaat the one shooting bullets at head level should be careful?  You crazy. The 2nd guy was tempting his own fate though lol.
---
He says GT, its xbox genius
---
When someone kills you when you try to spawnpeek
