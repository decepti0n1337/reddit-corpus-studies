[Tried pointing this out a day ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ay90ma/mozzie_drone_dead_spot_on_plane_under_baggage/) and people don't really pay attention to it, but as a drone hiding spot, it should be fixed.

ALbeit I am on PC I haven't had issues with crouching or leaning, buttons responsive, you sure you don't have a dodgy button?

Hahaha thanks. I got it once I saw the down under reply. But at first I wasnt sure where he was going with that

Hey OP how do you get that camo?

You have satisfied me with this post in a way I never thought possible.

He rappels with a spider web like Thatcher's elite but he's upsidedown instead and just hangs then shoots a web
---
Didn‚Äôt know he was named after a Krispy Kreme donut flavor
---
[removed]
---
In my experience the shorty seems to have slightly more but I haven‚Äôt really had time to test it, both are pretty bad for killing but great just making peek holes and busting hatches
---
Let me tell you my secret...... I don‚Äôt 
---
Always try to kick hackers if the vote fails because he has friends in the team leave asap. Especially in Casual.
---
No.... I don‚Äôt want Siege to go down the ‚Äòcsgo path‚Äô... that path....:.
---
I mean The Rabbids as the bad guys do make sense, I wouldn't be surprised if they were the ones to get the nukes dropped leading into The Division and New Dawn and boy would it be dark as hell if they were accidentally apart of Absergo in some way. 
---
Yeah there was another post on it a few hours ago 
---
I did vote kick but he had a buddy and we wouldn‚Äôt vote yes

Wait for the skin. The last thing anyone wants is another player using lion

&gt;two of the best guns in the game right now
---
So does average mean the guns are the best now? They are pretty shit
---
The p10 is basically the mpx with a smaller mag
---
The commando is just basic as fuck and below average in nearly every category 
---
Yeah it's gotten so normal to play with one less I'm numb to it its unfortunate bc it's ranked but what are ya going to do lol so I just roll with it and see it as a bigger challenge üòÅ
---
bro I have that IQ headgear 
---
Will definitely use it for breaching, and probably won‚Äôt use it to kill if I don‚Äôt have to anymore. Thanks!

imagine getting the new Hibana elite and ending first place in your team for the first time and this happens &gt;.&gt;
---
Talk about a plot twist if it does. Very sneaky there,rabbids.
---
Shark first. You can always buy lion
---
I hope she can go invisible to where defenders can't see her for a few seconds, because if all she does is hide from cameras she's basically just Vigil and Caveira, I say she because Alexander Remy confirmed it's a female operator.

If operator names don‚Äôt work I revert to their name but always use the ping. I think what the OP meant by the feature is whoever is speaking‚Äôs operator- not to be displayed throughout the game

Ach...man...you had it.

---
Unlike other Shield ops like say Monty who only have a pistol, unless you use the P10-C you won't benefit from the speed boost it offers. As the current objectively better choice for killing is the machine pistol you are essentially a 3 armour 0.75 speed as shields provide a slight speed debuff.
---
If you'd rather be faster on your feet go for pistol, even with it's 40 or so damage you can quickly 2 shot attackers you've been zapping for a bit.

All he needs is a velcro badge that says "cunt" with a logo of a kangaroo on it
---
That's bad for you. Unfortunately you'll need to wait the 15 days. If you contact support it will take them longer than this period. But thanks for posting this so people know they have to leave asap when hackers in the lobby. Still it's kinda bad for you. But in the end technically the whole team is boosted if they stay with the hacker even if he isn't a premate.
---
When the hell did she have 51 in a mag?
---
It's not even willing - it's just at this point MM is so busted, and the game so completely unenjoyable playing Solo that it is not worth the time or effort to keep trying.
---
If at some point I see Ubisoft makes some significant changes to how MM works, then I might come back but other than that....
---
He is pretty tasty
---
Ok thanks
---
When the hell did you start playing 
---
Microsoft doesnt endorse it but says its up to the developers to ban people for it.
---
I feel like the buff to Karos pellet dispersion will now always make pretty much the same sized holes, so in other words it's likely crouch holes are no longer a thing.
---
Means you will need two charges instead of one now.
---
Months ago. I always thought she had 41.
---
Anyone who mentions feet is not a girl

Yea but that would never be allowed, I think you would need to spend extra renown (4500) to get the alpha pack and give up the legendary FOR another legendary, and it can‚Äôt be the same s the one you had

Wow

Ok but it‚Äôs just frustrating that ubi doesn‚Äôt even hesitate to look into the situation they just ban people

All preference! I for one hate acog on attack but love it on defense. All about being comfortable

No this was never fixed on tts 
---
Tried,doesn‚Äôt work
---
It may be so, but if he had an ACOG he would have obviously had a better picture of you than you of him with your 1x sights.
---
At any rate the camera change to lean has allowed me to see my opponents holding angles far better, and been able to retaliate somewhat effectively also. Had you the kill cam of your enemy you may be able to perhaps see better how it went down.
---
Absolutely it does. Otherwise pros wouldn‚Äôt have pick &amp; ban or need to pick ops before each round. Everyone could go recruit for every obj on attack and defense. That‚Äôs just flat out wrong. Picking the right ops in each situation is how you give yourself an advantage. This is literally siege 101, the most basic of lessons you need to learn when you begin playing the game. Anyone over silver 3 understands this.

Maybe someone droned you before. You sit in spots that people nowadays check all the time or you run around and they hear you

From the clip he barely started to lean right, again it's probably down to some latency and parallax, as the wall was closer to cav than it was to the attacker.

Exactly, the new leaning system makes you lean closer and not at a 90 degree angle anymore which means that your head can peek out just a teeny tiny bit which is an advantage for the enemy peeking

---
didn‚Äôt saw it until you pointed it out
---
Yes, I do believe that's a pg take on what the man said. 
---
I was introduced into the game during Operation Red Crow but didn't really start playing until Operation Health. I never really considered myself good and still don't really, just someone who is still learning. Have my good games where I can score 19 kills, then have those games where I can't even manage pass 2. But if there was a time I say I became compentent at the game, it was possibly Operation Chimera where I learned about most of the game mechanics and interactions/synergy with operators. Still got a long road a head of me but way better than my begginer days when I didn't know shooting enemies through walls was a mechanic.
---
I mostly shoot them right as Mozzie hacks them, just unfortunate timing on my part. Today I even experienced my teammates shooting gridlocks gadget like umm?
---
Yeah when I first started the game I was placed bronze 4 with 8 losses 2 wins. 3 losses later I was copper 4 (this was when i had like 60 hours in the game total) I have 200 hours in the game now and I still am in copper 4. I've won and lost a good amount of ranked games and have yet to leave copper 4
---
I agree we need a solution. Even in PS4 you find a casual M&amp;K at least once a day but I'm not sure if aim assist is the right direction

Australian spiderman
---
Using her pistol over her shotty. You definitely deserve a ban.
---
Don't get me wrong I love the game. I like it because unlock cod bo3 you don't just zerg the enemy team with infinite lives. You actually have to play tactically and be smart. The only thing I hate is getting matched with people high above my skill level who have pinpoint-like accuracy.
---
I like how they gave him that voice line, considering that‚Äôs a legitimately common phrase used in Australia
---
Secret Service guy being Sam Fisher seems a tiny bit more likely now
---
One of the few times saying "my wife has been experimenting" is a good thing.
---
I get the reflex to shoulder a rifle a lot of the time when I see one, even though that has nothing to do with how you shoot in a video game. It's really weird
---
I think i they do this every time a map is new because in grim sky it was the same for Hereford for me. It‚Äôs a great thing tbh
---
Apparently you get matched with people better than you on purpose so you improve, interesting, still annoying though 
---
And the crux of the issue is that original ops (all of them) are the exact same price as 1 dlc op meaning you have them by the time your account is ranked ready any way
---
Dang, Lean. You've done some good art, but this is my favourite so far. I love it!
---
Ah, I didn't realize that was done on Hereford.
---
well thanks for the kind reply to my reply I take pride in trying not to be a total a** hat like 70% of the internet. :)

Jesus christ a third of the comments are complainrs. Nice fan art

1. Some people drops while prone to make them harder targets
---
2. First person and third person view is misaligned when it comes to some uninterruptible animations (like in this case: prone to crouch animation of Ash, that's why she killed you without turning to you in 3rd person).  
---
It's like people can shoot to their side while vaulting over something.
---
Console player here, can anyone explain?
---
Nah sometimes you can‚Äôt hear the torch and the ash ban is dumb I agree 
---
If you play with a hacker and they get banned then they reverse all the positive and negative progress from that game for each player.

Ok thank you I didn‚Äôt know where to look for one

Those were the days...

DayZ on increased vehicle spawn servers made me jump once or twice when a real helicopter flew over me.
---
Other way around, imagine trying to kill Mozzie as Sledge. He'd pop around a corner way lower than you'd expect and blow your brains out.
---
Generally speaking, in terms of gunfights and anything that isn't based around pure physical strength, smaller people have an advantage. Smaller target, easier to maneuver themselves. Not to mention that they've been dealing with larger people their whole life, so they're used to fighting that size difference. Most people are not used to dealing with tiny dudes.

After burnt horizon, Alt tabbing, which is returning to windows or any other application, and going back to siege has become very slow. there is a black screen for around 10 seconds before anything shows up again which can be annoying especially if you alt tab during a game a lot or just in general.
---
How so? It can easily be adjusted to differentiate players that crouch-spam from players that just have a needle stuck in their butt.
---
Is it just me or does Hibana have her bow backwards after she shoots the arrow? 
---
Alt tab switches between open windows, so if you have your game open and a Google search open in a separate window, pressing alt tab will switch between them. So it makes sense that switching away and coming back to the game quickly will cause problems

King George just lost 400 elo in the middle of a match. Servers are fucked this season.

My brother and I share the same Xbox, but have separate accounts. I bought the season pass for year 4 however it‚Äôs not showing up. I do not have the new ops nor is there a selection to purchase the y4 season pass. Could my brother have ‚Äústolen‚Äù the season pass for his account?
---
I say this because when I bought year 3 he was given all of the ops too, without having bought it himself. 
---
Fairly certain there is a glitch. Watching king George's stream and his ELO is dropping by the minute. In the last 30 minutes he's dropped from plat 2 to gold 2.

Thanks, my parents bought it XD
---
she wads just candy flippingnhard
---
Wahhhhh?
---
oof i got mine to 25001
---
Watching it happen now. Honestly it's hilarious watching him rage 
---
The HUD at the top changes when he swings in, slightly ruining the mood. Great, now I ruined the mood-
---
This is why Ela got nerfed. Great clip btw
---
Ash isn't a problem, she's no stronger than any other 3 speed attacker, and her gadget has limited usefulness anyway.
---
Honestly, I don't even play her, the R4-C has way too high recoil for me. I pretty much main Jackal, his gun hurts way more, has a similar rate of fire, and has deliciously controllable recoil at the same time. Plus his gadget is absurdly helpful, sometimes broken if you're working with another player alongside it.
---
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt
---
Imagine if Mozzie hacked that bad boy
---
RAWR XD UWU

Tachanka with a Vulcan Cannon, one can only dream.

He was probably pretty low health

fun is for people who don't win.
---
Need update, can you confirm? 
---
No wonder Thatcher's so angry all the time
---
Yeah the sound glitch is so frustrating giving me anxiety of buying a better and better headset even though mine is pretty good (Hyperx cloud 2)
---
The Danish attacker sounds like she's gonna be fun while the American defender sounds like he'll be a game changer.
---
Did you update?
---
Definitely get Mozzie. You can just not play him when you are with your friend or just take it first. If he TKs you, TK him back.
---
Mozzie is extremely fun and his weapons are really good too. His ability gives great intel and can be placed in tricky spots like drone holes.
---
Just a tip, don‚Äôt play Mozzie for the first 2 weeks he is out. People will tk every person that takes him first.
---
Ok I wasn't sure for a second there 
---
New hibanna actually looks pretty decent now
---
No
---
Excuse you? 
---
Yeah, I agree with you.

They should be marked with an icon on defenders screens, similar to how Echo's Yokai drones are.

Nobody would shoot the drones then

That's quite big. I hope they manage to fix it soon.

‚ÄúOH GOD IM BEING SHOT AT BETTER RUN STRAIGHT‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not necessarily doing anything different, I‚Äôve just gotta be even more accurate when I turtle shell.
---
Ok but he played maybe 60-70 matches this season. How much Elo do you loose per hacker in this case? In the ballpark of 12, counting off a little due to the win? Assuming every match had a hacker? I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs 100% why.
---
How much siege have you played 
---
This isn't overwatch your rank should restart every season.
---
But if you missed then desync isnt a problem
---
I was talking about last season
---
Ooh the wording threw me off.
---
OH SHIT GET THE REPEL 100
---
I think there should be an option to turn it off completely. 
---
jackfrags isn't really good tho. he's a bf guy
---
That‚Äôs fucking disgusting,I really hope this isn‚Äôt stat tracking issue 2.0 and it gets restored. 
---
Something tells me it‚Äôs a bug in that new MMR rollback. Nevertheless, what a great start to Y4. I mean, why does TTS exist at this point lol  
---
Where do I find the code for siege?

Duh, doc you idiot /s

---
Only been able to play on the map once but I think mozzie‚Äôs load-out is garbage. I love his gadget but honestly don‚Äôt want to play him again. 
---
You savage....
---
Capit√£o is an absolute beast on bomb. Smoke off areas for a plant and find positions to be able to deny defusing with fire. Love running the M249 on him since it deals with soft walls quick. Didn‚Äôt like him at first due to his utility but quickly learned how useful it is to fit your situation (aka incinerate someone in DBNO state behind a hard counter).  
---
It's the exact opposite of that, but good try. All of the sites on Coastline kind of suck, so they're equal choices. 
---
Drone gone and caught Lumbago
---
I'm 1.7m abd I feel bad, poor Mozzie
---
I am surprised you can even load Uplay with this..Your trolling right ?

I'm having the same issue, once I restart, it'll give the items, or was my progress not being counted??
---
Yeah they need to fix the elo I was losing around 200 elo for a loss last season but only getting 50 for a win
---
Lol yesterday game hahahah
---
If you added your challenges and then jumped straight into a game, it won't have counted. You need to restart it after adding the challenges and then it should start tracking.
---

---
/u/UbiNoty any chance this gets some love?
---
Is this a joke? Please tell me it is......
---
Thanks. In fairness I'd probably blame that on lag or bullshit if that happened in a Siege game. Would understand the guy's saltiness if he had any.
---
Maybe smurfing similar to what Dabjulmaros said?
---
assuming worst case scenario based on: [https://game-rainbow6.ubi.com/en-gb/rewards/season/12](https://game-rainbow6.ubi.com/en-gb/rewards/season/12)
---
4 copper = 5600 ELO, Him = 3846, team total = 9446, average = 1900. So placed around bronze. I believe if you lose to significantly lower ranks, you lose a significantly greater amount of ELO. Also if you lose right after placement you can lose a good amount of elo. I have lost up to around 75 not smurfing. That is a net team loss of  375 ELO. If he were to lose while smurfing the enemy team would get more of his elo and very little of the coppers elo. I still dont know how 375 becomes 1000 though. That seems excessive. Without knowing who he was matched up with, I am not going to blame ubisoft.
---
Actually, would be cool. Bit not rappelling, just hanging upside down like spider and launch pest in a camera and hacks it

Maybe because she eats alot of rounds, but as a bomb player it makes secure actually pretty interesting and more enjoyable. If you get past the,‚Äù Shes HUUUGE,‚Äù factor and just play her and focus on her ability she‚Äôs genuinely one the best added operators since Valk/Mira. 
---
Well that was smart.. 
---
And if it's more than a 360, gotta lower the sensitivity yes?

Everyone is different so sensitivity that works for me might not work for you.

However, as a starting point you could google rainbow 6 pro league sensitivity settings and there's a chart that shows everyone's mouse and mouse settings.

Custle buff? *Hmm*

---
Not sure, same here... had a few games of ranked earlier too and my squad and I were 100+ ping (usually our pings are pretty low). Practically unplayable right now...
---
No MM is broken atm. 
---
Its hit or miss if you will get Aust servers or Brazilian servers. 
---
Should still be able to get games though. My understanding is they are doing a server update at the moment if your trying now. 
---
Supposedly ELO rollback from playing against cheaters. Was watching a stream where they lost 1000+ elo after winning a game. And it stuck to them
---
Check kingGeorge, he claims that he lost 1400+ elo, MacieJay like 800-900, so 300 is not that bad, but seems something is wrong here
---
Hyper X Cloud 2
---
Hahah, this was discovered a long time ago

It's a bug. The game will put you on Brazilian servers. Happening to everyone (including streamers.) No word from Ubi yet for a fix

I think it's way better, it was already pretty dumb to get shot by an ally in the foot for a free top up of half health, promoted a bit of an unhealthy habit of "I killed an enemy but am low, reset me to 50 so I can kill another or meet wall for you guys".
---
It means a more cautious approach is perhaps better now.

it happened to me 2 times yesterday 1 i got shot trough the shield with blitz the 2nd one happened when i was playing clash

The Fortnite "solution" worked for a very short while until adapters got updated to be undetected once more, and no you still have players that play M&amp;K queueing in controller matches without the game being able to tell.
---
It's like anti cheat softwares, you will always be a little behind the curve as to everything you manage to detect and enact upon you suddenly have the cheat makers finding a new way to circumnavigate the anti cheat software. It's a never ending uphill battle.
---
I'm sad to see this happening, it seems to be an issue for some games and Siege never had that issue, I did try to escape my mouse from the game window a few times and it did not so I thought it's all okay but apparently it is not. I used to praise this game for being one of the few that can properly keep your mouse in the game window but I guess I can no longer say that.

Well yes, you can still correctly blame technical limitations and hiccups in some cases, but depending I wouldn't say these cases are the major part of a player's death cycle.

No, hitboxes are adjusted to fit the human body without clothes.
---
And ash is one of the smallest with the best guns and a very useful gadget, so there's that.
---
Do you play on console?
---
Because on PC, Ash's R4-C and Mavericks M4 have low recoil.
---
Okay but can you explain to me why having seasons justifies implementing a roller coaster ranking system?
---
Well it generally has more content on it and they put more optimizations on it.

Considering how long I've been playing I doubt I'm *that* biased. I was also a zofia main for a while, I rank her 2nd best. 
---
Why do you think Burnt Orizon is worst than Op White Noise?
---
Actually theme park is balanced for me, yea it needs some tweaking here and there but overall, 3 defendable sites, easy to hold and easy to attack when you got good teammates. Fortress: long af hallways all over the map, random hatches in those hallways, huge objectives which are undefendable. Skyscraper: soft walls all over the map, long balconies which is a nightmare for attackers, weird placed objectives which are pretty much undefenable when you are against a semi good team. kafe: i mean... 3 objectives, one is kinda defendable. Chalet is also a map which is really bad balancing wise but i personally like it, that doesnt have anything to do with that tho. Ranked should represent pro league as much as possible and it is really frustrating playing those maps over and over again and keep dropping ranks cuz of that.
---
Do you use MnK?
---
Isn‚Äôt that desk hard ? 
---
That is fine you are allowed to disagree. Of course it effects gameplay, but how does it effect balancing? It's not like it was a glitch that could only be done by few people or altering the game. It was something everyone could do at any time. Ooptie walking and drop shotting were core mechanics in RS3:BA that anybody who played the game longer than a rental period could do and knew what it was.
---
That laser sight gives me anxiety 
---
I use this on castle ;(
---
They are two different systems and siege uses the MMR system. Devs and ubi employees will never use the term ELO. ‚ÄúEducated‚Äù (seriously no offence) community members will use the proper terminology. It‚Äôs like referring to democracy as communism all the time. Or something like that.

absolutely, until someone hear your drone from 2km away and shoot it.

I got the 30k in that week, I don't think it was a problem.

It‚Äôs coming soon according to a Ubisoft guy.

I've had this issue and so do my mates. Ubi, please fix.
---
oh yeah +fps issues as well

Do i downvote this or upvote this to say i like it because its in Australian
---
Can Confirm, it's just black Fractals with Hints of White :/

Does anyone know how I can change servers on PS4?

Dude I've been having the same problem, I thought I got bad all of the sudden because I couldn't hear people walk up on me.

Why do people not like white noise?

Oh I meant Lesion

Cool! I havent played Mozzie yet, hehe! Good luck ;)

I think the audio this patch are horrible, footsteps soumd non-existent.

I mean about 30 seconds later i used the tip on her and she died no clue why those 8 bullets didnt kill üòÖ

Mute is really the only operator I‚Äôd take it back on.  Doc almost always has his mullet proof camera when he‚Äôs played in Pro League, so I doubt that‚Äôs gonna get changed. 
---
Just because you assume something you can‚Äôt kill smb. She could have thought 3 more seconds and then maybe she would have known. I think she is just a toxic player like many others in r6s and doesn‚Äôt care about killing teammates.
---
running game borderless, you lose some fps fyi
---
You can change servers on PS4 by using custom match settings and returning to the main menu
---
True and you can always just sit next to it and listen for the rappel sound queue.
---
Again, sometimes losing a badly placed mira is worse than losing a player. I've had rounds as twitch where I destroy the Mira window, and then some like blackbeard gets 3 kills from looking through it
---
The bow is that big because they were more focused in range and not accuracy. It‚Äôs supposed to be that big. They make it by using almost a WHOLE TREE.
---
Because im nice satan
---
you crashed the drone
---
That‚Äôs not as fun as something that goes boom
---
The way Ubisoft does operators is, and I quote, ‚Äú*As inspiration comes*.‚Äù   
---
Basically once they come up with a cool idea, that operator will get one.  Hence why super popular ops like Mira and Smoke don‚Äôt have one.
---
Yh, I like it too, it's, one of the best MVP animations in the game!
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land?...
---
Yeah but it's only accessable through being an attacker... :/
---
Literally a better Castle. Plus OP.
---
We will see. I‚Äôll be super impressed if they can reverse the ELO loss

Nomads pretty bad imo, shes a great meme tho

it has been reported just letting you guys know to watch out before they fix it

yea i dont get that one.

you can make a case that these 2 are different.  same with ying's and lesion's shotgun (it literally is the same you just cant silence hers)  
---
but the saw is the EXACT same gun   that you can customize the exact same way.  why dont they share skins? 
---
I don‚Äôt know, but an optional reset could be issued if that‚Äôs how they go about it and care about efforts. Just trying to think of the possibilities. I‚Äôm -1881, so I‚Äôm copper IV and negative points at that. There‚Äôs not way I‚Äôm escaping negative points anytime soon. My friend is getting 30 points a win at the same rank due to the same bug, so I don‚Äôt think effort matters in my case.

No, that looks out onto balcony

I would suggest Mira. She is very easy to play and learn
---
cool bro
---
Jager's secret twin
---
Does for me
---
Mozzie is going to get nerfed 100% I would say Jackal because he‚Äôs a very balanced operator with two amazing guns. 
---
Yeah they could make it optional or just add the elo that everyone lost, but I guess we have to wait and see 
---
I use dokk (obviously) and she is really good with jackal and/or lion but recently had her logic bomb chnaged so that mute can counter her. mira is a great defender if you know where to place her black mirrors.
---
Lol i accidentally shot a guy who ran in front of me while I was trying to shoot a drone.

Him and his duo que partner killed me the next two rounds. Me and my duo didnt do anything because we‚Äôre good sports and actually wanted to win

Mira is VERY knowledge based if you wanna get the most out of her. That being said, her Vector Has little recoil, her shotgun is good at destruction and has decent kill power, and a nitro always helps

Has anyone encountered the sound issue where it sounds as if you are wearing a fishbowl over your head? Sounds are very muffled. Last live build was no issue, in the last TTS it happened and carried over to the current live build. I have Realtek audio drivers that I have uninstalled and reinstalled and the same thing happens. Restarting the game does nothing. 
---
Pfffffft.
---
Maybe you should just do another rank reset at this point... nobody is that deep into it after less than a week, and many of us have had our MMR screwed up by the anti-cheat system malfunctions or even by having to do half of our placement matches against 5 stacks of foreign diamonds with 150 ping.

"He can aim good and control recoil bc this ain't his first fps game and he's tried hard to improve his skills with a controller???!!!?....
---
.....WITCH!!!"
---
I don't think there's as many mkb's as assumed. Now, they are definently out there, but having one doesnt make you Diamond or Plat even. Some players still suck even with an easier time aiming. 
---
It's cheating. It really is. It's an easier way to aim. 
---
High kills doesnt mean they're mkb though - it's clear in their movement. You can't crouch and lean spam while prefiring around a corner without a hardware advantage. When you see that, it's time to ask the question. But otherwise, it's better to assume they're just really good.
---
Nj UBI cant get shit right without messing it up.. No wonder ranked has been in beta for 20 years... nothing like gtinding your ass off to Plat 2 within the first couple days and being demoted back down to gold fucking 3.

Is it me or is New Hibana also a but more thiccer?

Ive tried everything ubi has sent my way and nothing worked, i finally caved and rebought the game (for steam this time) and i have full audio back, so i think its a uplay version issue

---
Yeah, its for the real gamers only

I love how everyone lined up to try it right after Cap did it
---
Definitely the Old one.
---
The battlefiled is already even. Defense has area Advantage, attackers have range Advantage. You need ACOGs to counter skinny slim peek holes, so ACOGs are useful.
---
There's nothing wrong with acogs in the game. They should stay.
---
Lmao fun game
---
I used to use hers with an acog but i changed to reflex and saw my aim was better and found the gun more fun
---
You could have just waited 2 weeks or so, when everybody‚Äôs beeing ranked in the rank they belong to.
---
Now it‚Äòs just a mess without 4 teammates to play ranked

Yeah I don't think it'll happen to everyone, like hibana for example I don't think she'll lose hers because she's an expert at long range, that's why she hard breaches from a distance, but maverick on the other hand will be fine without having an ACOG on his m4 since he needs to be close to a wall to use his torch, he could also keep it for his AR for example 
---
The reason I think this is because ubisoft said they wanna see what effects removing an ACOG has on a character which is why they took ash's away 
---
Agreed, it would have made more sense
---
In meme language yes.
---
Not using the smg 11
---
Wait, that's illegal. 
---
Just wait 2 weeks or so until everybody‚Äôs placed in the Elo they belong to

Lol

---
Cool idea man! Nice way to introduce a Doc type character without just ripping doc off completely. I‚Äôd suggest a 2 speed 2 armor build.
---
Agreed. Thanks.
---
This is the system working as intended. At the start of the season event starts at 2500 mmr.
---
If you lost and won the same amount of matches it would be expected for you to be close to the starting mmr.
---
I use 552 ttk is almost the same except the 552 is quite a bit faster a dealing with 3-armors. The 552 is also smaller and has an angled grip

For all we know the time to get a game in the new player playlist is insanely long. Like trying to do that article mission or setting your game mode to hostage only when plat.

Older splash is better, new face model is better.
---
Sounds extremely weak to me. Doubt it would see use.
---
I do agree with mav, since he is similar to ash in versatility, just from a different perspective.
---
But I don't think anybody else would have it fair for then if they lost it.
---
Was thinking the same.
---
Maestro.
---
Maybe if that Mira took 3 seconds to communicate with Mozzie this wouldn't happen? 
---
I think it's still best to get to the rank level and start to play ranked asap. At the beginning you just have to try and have fun and learn the game. Don't worry about winning or your rank.
---
The new comer Playlist is a good idea but if you are looking to really get into this game that is my best advice. 
---
Yes.
---
Odd.
---
Shouldn't happen.
---
What's funny is that alot of us want some form of a story for this game while alot of recent ubisoft games have has weak-average stories 
---
This pov is so outdated. This was the case early on in the game. Now, you can't stop to hold an angle as a defender, because of Jackal, Dokkaebi etc. The game has evolved so much, that the balance has almost switched. Balance is either a) give everyone an acog or b) take away all acogs. 
---
Oh, ok.
---
It really does. But doesn‚Äôt it feel better getting a good prize after the season?

I thought that too. It‚Äôll be cool if that‚Äôs it.

I play ps4 and yes this is a real problem since year  2 I think.
---
I don't even play ranked anymore because of this behavior.
---
All my friends have switched over to pc and I just stopt playing.
---
gz m8! the frist is the best ;)
---
Stuck in 0 all for me, and the drone one i shoul'dve completed
---
3/4
---
On attack I main jackal tho
---
This seems to happen to me consistently at the start of each season. Always have lag and stutters, I think it's because the servers are overloaded and can't handle the larger than normal activity.
---
I have friends who claim this same issue, and with the server switching glitch this season I don't doubt it is affecting the server performance overran
---
Yeah I think ubisoft should look at a characters ability/play style first, like hibana who I feel needs her ACOG , but I think we might start getting new attackers without access to an ACOG 
---
u/Its_Epi Any chance you can take a look at this, not sure what exactly caused it to trigger but it was an awful bug.
---
What the hell, literally no recoil
---
You do know the kind of power you put in the hands of defenders if you give them ACOGs, don't you? We already see how powerful and how high the win Delta's are for rook and doc in high plat and diamond, now to want it to return to the hellish times when J√§ger and bandit had ACOGs and could challenge attackers at all ranges with higher headshot percentage guns?
---
There is no balance in that. Attackers are fine when it comes to gun utility, and as are defenders. Doc and rook are still sitting at the top of the graphs, and this is without pick and ban.
---
I like the creativity but ubi doesnt see this, they already have ops planned out for 4 seasons ahead, like epi mentioned in the hotbreach podcast theres no use for it
---
Agreed.
---
Is this only on PC?
---
 The gun is scared of the soviet power and tries to stay away
---
So hostage?  But 1 v 9
---
I mean after a certain point you can only assume it's intentional. Like if I get hit by one bullet fine but if some dumbass is running around with a shotgun and downs me or is spraying with his smg or rifle... I'll ask them to use a pistol next time but if they start doing it the next round near me I'll tk em to avoid their idiocy.
---
Every platform
---
My nigga they know
---
Is that why they mained bandit and other ops who are not maestro echo etc. when i was playing 10 matches?
---
And kd dont mean nothing. Unless you have 2 kills 8 deaths. Dont pretend like only pros manage to get that. Kd doesnt matter when you are like 4-2-6 but what is your excuse when you played bandit all the time and didnt even place 1 gadget and still end up 2-2-8?
---
on every platform , dont abuse it could get you suspended
---
I always say that when lobbing a grenade or flash bang at a J√§gerüòÇ
---
I prefer the old one personally. I don't get why everyone on Reddit seems to absolutely hate the old one so much. The new one is nice and all, but the old one has some charm to it I think.
---
Well done. Charm is now yours. Don't worry about losing the rank now, try press for plat 2. Or even staying plat 3. It will make you a much better player playing at that rank with others of similar rank than just keeping your rank badge to play casual.
---
with the camera being in the center / low of your head , yes : ) 
---
552 is consistent. Aug kills 1 and 2 armours faster, but kills 3 armours slower.
---
Depends on your playstyle. Rush? 552 and angled grip. Support? Aug.
---
Some of these toxic fuckers take their IRL rage on anyone they see fit online. In most cases it's people looking to start shit. I can't tell you how many times someone ran in from of me while I'm clearly ADS, then shoot a drone and deal 20 damage to their foot. Say "sorry my bad! I was shooting a drone", and all of a sudden I get shot and am at 50 health and they say "sorry I was shooting a drone". Some people need to feed their ego's by stomping on people, like calling everyone a fag, gay, retarded, etc, when in reality their the ones who lack any real spine because instead of figuring out their shit, they need to make other people feel as shitty as them. Shit I have a meh life sometimes, but damn I'm not going to treat people like shit. Then there are the cocky people, that have low self esteem and feel the need to humblebrag allll the time to try to make themselves feel better about themselves you'll likely find them trying to always one up you in any way. Sorry, I'm a psych major and I see this shit all the time. If anyone's ever being extremely toxic, just say "I'm sorry you have deep seated issues with yourself or a bad life in general and feel the need to be cruel to others to make yourself feel good, I truly pity you". And most of the time they'll shut up. 
---
Why would you waste the C4 instead of just... shooting the guy?
---
Nevermind the fact that they support this game and are constantly improving it 
---
Well at first no but I slowly started to lose interest in rainbow so I just play for the charm. It sounds stupid but yeah pretty much. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I still love to play ranked but the charm is a huge part of playing ranked for me.
---
Seriously. Like every second person in this thread says she looks like she was from an anime, but neither can I remember any anime in which characters look like that, nor did the old one look asian in any way, the new one does.
---
Its not so bad, I'm already back to plat 2
---
yes you can pay attention but you can still get hit by something unexpected
---
Don't play "Ranked",if you won't try to win.
---
But as you can see I'm clearly boosted lol 
---
It's a charm who everyone has. You can better put an alpha pack charm on your gun
---
Shit idea
---
Don‚Äôt play without a squad if winning is that important to you...
---
You have to go into the game files and delete your save games, something like that. I saw a post on it just dig around for it.
---
As if it doesn‚Äôt take me 3+ minutes to load in 
---
Yeah, of course. I think after 5-6 matches of not talking/typing then they should have Ranked removed for X time.
---
I meant at least it should affect the placement matches you play. If I were a new played I wouldn't wanna face against an experienced player and I'd quit playing the game.
---
tysm
---
Yeah I agree
---
After I took an arrow to the knee.
---
If you're not going to try to win then Ranked is not for you. In Ranked you have to play as a team, if you don't want to try play competitive.
---
i can already see everyone who plays him get called gay
---
Its been like this...
---
I actually don‚Äôt put it on all my guns. I put it on the seasons ops. I‚Äôve been doing that since Red Crow (when I started to play)
---
New one looks Like She grew up in Chernobyl 
---
Yeeey!! Thank you so much! I‚Äôm gonna try some black and white more often üòâüëç
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôm saying if you have an issue with it then find friends.
---
Cool but that‚Äôs irrelevant to the point you‚Äôre setting yourself up for failure in the first place 
---
It‚Äôs the only way some people feel good about themselves. Like the gold threes who 1v1 newbs on house map so they can ‚Äòget rekt‚Äô 
---
Foolishness. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You can add me if you want : matrab1. I play most days 
---
Can‚Äôt wait till I can get to the level of esl. I used to play it in other games 
---
and so the echo main was established

Hello rainbowfunnymoments, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/az7nm6/some_really_good_video_i_found/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Still weird you play for a charm but ok
---
True that solo queue is not good, but not talking makes it worse. If I lost with a communicative team then fair enough but if you die and don't call anything out then don't play ranked.
---
Again your proving me right, because I‚Äôd say I was like gold 3 and I solo queued a bunch got derailed to copper or something it shouldn‚Äôt put me up against coppers 
---
Yea I know. I haven‚Äôt reached farther than plat 2 which sucks but yea
---
this seems like a very good idea to many of you, but from the perspective of a game designer, im going to tell you that if this is implemented it is going to DRASTICALLY increase loading time. and trust me some of the people with poor SSD's already load slow enough. However this could be a function that you can choose to turn on client side, and not enforced for everyone.
---
Either that or there‚Äôs people who don‚Äôt reinforce stuff or do anything and just run around trying to get kills but get none and always use the excuse that it‚Äôs just casual 
---
‚ÄúRollback?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, kill him.‚Äù
---
That must be it, they mustn‚Äôt be able to compete in any rank and need casual in order to feel good. Sad.
---
Why would it tank performance? The game can‚Äôt render 5 3D models at once? Bullshit. It does it every single match as soon as the round starts.
---
THE OLD ONE
---
This is true
---
It's also completely silent when you try to get in.
---
Way worse. Was wondering if I was going crazy or not since I don't see anyone else discussing it. 
---
Yeah, I got manhandled by a bunch of people who surrendered later as well, I think they were smurfs trying to get to copper 
---
Honestly 50 health was great just the way it was before, you can‚Äôt get 1 shot body shot at 50 health 
---
UNRELATED         why is dokkaebi defending?
---
Nice! Do you need a castle and reinforcements behind you or is it prett managable? Trying to picture it in my head.
---
It‚Äôs a common hallway to check. 
---
I go sweat in casual at the end of every season. Only because that's when diamonds, and high and low plats play and sweat aswell.
---
they weren‚Äôt supposed to come out in the first season, it was the plans for year 4
---
You already forgot how I asked for all acogs to be removed? That was what I asked for. 
---
Um, it's 5 mode 3d animated models to continuously run, if people are already having long loading times, that won't help
---
G-word review? 
---
you could say its...
---
HanJou
---
This. Especially in Terrorist hunt.
---
The game as a whole seems so much Shittier then when it came out to me personally, I‚Äôd kill to go back to the acog jagr and bandit times and nix all the new operators. it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same anymore, between crouch spammers, the drop shotting before it was patched, horrible ddos issues, people throwing every new season in record numbers, hit reg being anyone‚Äôs best guess...ect. I love siege but it‚Äôs nothing like what it used to be unfortunately 
---
Right 
---
Japp, that's Siege right now. I'm playing on PS4 and Solo-Casual is fuckin unplayable. They should stop the vote-kick-system. For now it is more damaging than helpful. It is a fuckin mess. Is this Battle-fair-thingi even working? I don't think so.
---
Hello ReaperDSV, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/az7ozb/didnt_work_out_that_well_for_some_data/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Except it's much easier for them to have thousands of people to play the game and find them versus MAYBE a couple dozen of employees.
---
i didn‚Äôt play ranked until at least level 70. play the newcomer playlist. ranked will teach you the most about the game but might be a challenge
---
I should add I‚Äôm a 2nd shifter so I play mainly at night. Get out of work at 11 EST
---
For honor kinda does that too I think. It shouldn't be too hard. 
---
I thought I heard it was still the same in t hunt but idk cause I don‚Äôt play t hunt 
---
It‚Äôs 15 in T hunt.
---
thank you
---
The MMR rollback is from the cheat detection though, nothing about getting wrecked by people with high ping 10,000 miles away that you can't help but play against.
---
What abt people who can't talk/type for whatever reason?
---
Yes they are different. One is the cause and the other is the effect. 
---
Please let me know if I can be of any farther assistance. Seems you are a desperate need of being educated. 
---
Nah, sorry but that would turn this game into a cod or any other stupid 1st person shoter, 
---
Wack
---
I don‚Äôt believe that you should be punished for not communicating but instead encourage them by rewarding players that do communicate with the team
---
The best thing you can do is just leave and join another fame. Your not losing anything by leaving.
---
Could you make a version without the text please? Would make an amazing wallpaper for my phone.
---
You do know they have QA.... They can miss things.
---
can anyone confirm this?
---
What‚Äôs the estimated time until Y4S2?
---
You‚Äôre right. No in between. These are the two true breeds of casual players. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve played her enough to really know i guess
---
Casual is actually the secret ranked mode, no one knows it though 
---
I had a similar idea and a real healer on attack would be nice in my opinion. But i think that a stationary "healing station" with an aura would be more balanced. A nade would probably be easier to abuse when pushing an objective. Especially with a finka boost on top
---
If you play bomb I have an Op drone spot for the gray room (tent room) it‚Äôs broken for attack 
---
Everyone can type when they die, if you are mute or something then I understand though.
---
Hi Epi, is that across all platforms? The game is kind of unbearable on ps4 with 200 ping. 
---
Yeah, there's one particular window on the new map that you can rappel through despite being completely closed. Also it's silent when you breach through it. Lots of people on the new map playlist are just doing that instead of learning the map.
---
Still waiting on mine x.x I‚Äôm in an eternal state of 4Ks
---
well 4 seasons every year, so early summer late spring? yeah that‚Äôs a wait
---
Her primary
---
Hi, new player here (lvl39).
---
Until now, I've been playing mostly situations and lots of PvE terrorist hunt on different difficulties. I have also played some 40-50 casual matches, but as a rule I get stomped on easily, and reserve myself to solid support roles (Rook etc.)
---
I have been looking forward to the newcomers playlist, hoping I could improve in an easier enviorment and eventually venture into casual PvP, but so far I'm not sure about the experience. You see, most players in the newcomer playlist must indeed be new to r6s - some of the telltale signs are playing very defencively, digging in on an angle and twitchy, nervous movements when the adrenaline kicks in. However, then there are other kinds of players - confident, aggressive, usually picking off 3-5 kills. In short statpadders, sealclubbers or smurfs whatever you want to call them. The fact that you can hardly find a "newcomer" match without a aggressive Jager or run n' gun Ash worries me.
---
Frankly speaking, based on my experience in the newcomer mode, I would **not reccomend the mode to new players.** Regrettably so, but this new mode draws smurfs to itself like moths to a lamp. Perhaps in a twisted way the exodus of experienced "newbies" might render casual mode an easier experience, one can always hope :)
---
There is no code it is instantly added to your game
---
Likely because it was useless.
---
If it worked as it should then it would have been nice but it was less accurate than the killcams and a lot of the times would just say a super bullet(dmg from many bullets lumped together) killed you.
---
Compensator, Vertical grip, which ever sight you like the most
---
You‚Äôre right I‚Äôll make it now I‚Äôm sorry to put you through that without giving you a heads up.
---
yeah the human body really likes sugar. 
---
Wdym I said I'm a silver player
---
Oops my mistake I'm saying COD XD

Now don‚Äôt play ranked for the rest of the season unless you want trash teammates dragging you down to bronze
---
Thank you sir appreciate the help
---
I wouldnt say thats the level of plat 1 (considering aim isnt really what matters) but you shouldn't listen to half these guys. Sure he was bad but that doesnt change the fact that that was an impressive shot. 
---
Mozzie: 8/10
---
Gridlock: 8/10
---
Outback: 9/10
---
When your mom gives you a bday bed spread...*oh hecc*
---
Outback - 8/10 (So far, more time and experience will change that)
---
Mozzie - 7/10 - Really fun OP, but other ops can fill his role better, but I see a potential for high skill ceiling.
---
Gridlock - 6/10 - Well balanced OP, good guns, decent gadget, nothing too special, but not... boring. 
---
Loading times are already long.
---
Especially for a fellow console player.
---
Hell no. It already takes some people forever to load. We don't need more data than what's required to load 
---
Yeah and Koreans know how to make soft drinks 
---
Mine is normally always yellow. Now it's almost always red. No difference in gameplay though so whatever I guess.
---
At the start of every season you **are** at gold rank, for once the system worked lol
---
Map: 6 seems good, but I always come against very toxic people on it
---
Mozzie: 7 fun, but overrated usefulness (echos just better)
---
Gridlock: 6 gadget seems meh, but I love LMGs, slightly butthurt that I can't put the killjoy skin on it as I have that for the M249
---
Its still there on a fair few skins and outfits, if you look at the GSG9's leather style helmets with the gold trim on (except IQ's as hers is bugged aswell, but then again so are all her cosmetics) the metalic effect is still fine. And the headgear and shield skin for Monty's pro league are still fine aswell funnily enough, its just the outfit thats fucked.
---
it's a widespread human phenomenon called being a piece of human garbage
---
Can you do the same for ddosing?
---
lost 3 games (was winning all of them) and someone in the other team ddosed and got nothing for them -\_-
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 2 years and i never knew this tf
---
Add Hereford and Kafe to that list and you've got my vote
---
Mabue you didn‚Äôt activate it in Ubisoft club I have forgotten to
---
Um..... no he wasn't... he was hard holding that angle, it's shown in the killcam my dude.
---
you have to select open with 7-zip
---
I uh see a bit of a difference with one of the ops there 
---
GTX 1060
---
Then the system is garbage you shouldn't go against people who are placed when you aren't placed
---
People that kick you after you can't "clutch" are immature manchildren and are what is wrong with this community. 
---
Please tell me they killed mozzie
---
Mozzie 9/10 Gridlock 6/10 Outback 8/10
---
Thats why, im running on a 770
---
Sorry my phone is shaky, I don‚Äôt know then guess just a broken game
---
He‚Äôs actually pretty fucked if you see his hole before he sees you, cuz then you just watch it and wait to beam him in the face. I just try to respect that no wall is impenetrable anymore and be aware when camping near a reinforced wall, especially with some defends now you can take solid guesses on if they‚Äôll bring mav most times, and once someone brings him for even one round I try to play the rest of the game with that in mind. I can‚Äôt think of any real specific counter though so that‚Äôs what I usually do when he keeps getting me, I‚Äôve seen some people take clash just to cover his little holes but that seems pretty excessive to me. 
---
Exactly, gotta have a little celebration. :3
---
Last one is thermite I believe
---
It was a beast when it first came out with no recoil when keep firing but it still a beast today. The issue in the clip is that they were clumped together
---
It‚Äôs been activated since it came out 
---
I Miss it too man. Those were the golden days. I once saw this youtuber play 1.0 and i spent the rest of the day trying to find it to no avail. But man were those the days.
---
The new in-game model doesn't look like an actual alive person, and the pale skin doesn't help
---
Basically just give us pro league maps, that was the best part of road to SI is getting the best maps in the game, I'd rather play bank several times in a row before playing any of the previously mentioned maps 
---
Can't wait to get my hands on this elite
---
I think ppl are discussing it but ubi is kind pushing it down the feed a bit.
---
nope
---
Btw, it only looks like that in the killcams. 
---
Aha yeah sure thing
---
Unless perspective means "I can shoot you from the future" or "I'm Sledge, I can see and shoot from the tip of my hammer handle" no, that is not perspective.
---
Mozzie 7/10 
---
Gridlock 2/10
---
Outback 8/10
---
Early season ranked is always AIDS.
---
Map = 8/10, I like that it is different and generally more creative and unique but the hotel part of the map seems too cluttered.
---
Mozzie = 6/10, is gadget is interesting but if you don't get a drone it feels useless and his guns lack damage so you really have to go for headshots.
---
Gridlock = 8/10, her LMG while is the m249 it doesn't have the same stats and is more fun than Capitao's plus her gadget is really great but her having 3 seems unbalanced, I fully expect them to reduce it them two.
---
That makes so much more sense. Lol this community low key sucks all the time. I hate it I remember back in the beginning everyone knew everyone.
---
me and my squad have been dealing with this all week our pings are crazy and we have been out in random servers across the world
---
But how can Ubisoft know that we are using a third party software to communicate? 
---
Ranked is whatever the player who payed for the game wants to make of it, outside of cheating. Some players just want to relax after work n shoot at stuff without thinking too much, I agree, that is what casual is for, but allowing for def picks and the like, ranked is generally more fun than casual, so I understand people not being interested in casual.
---
You cannot be a dictator, that is one way to kill a game, people of all levels of skill, and lean have to be welcome, else your playerbase will be so small they're all on a first name basis with one another. Some people lean to more relaxed and whatever playstyles, that will never change, and it shouldn't, freedom is great. 
---
I try to figure out if they have a maverick early in the round and if they do, I just dont anchor where he can shoot me through it and I keep an eye on the wall. 
---
Change render scaling to 100 and T-AA sharpness to 75.
---
It only works when TAA is enabled, but you can set TAA to 100%, which is the same as no antialiasing.
---
OLD ONE IS MY HIBANA new one needs elite to look good i think they are baiting people to spend the money on elite, make me sad 
---
This is a mess
---
Explain how its op. It has decent damage and slighly over average fire rate. Does this mean bandits mp7 is op? His gun shoots just as fast and does more damage.
---
Yeah it was hipfire. They should make it fire at centre a little earlier.
---
People in your team should be able to report you if you don't talk and they review it like that.
---
yucc 
---
So i'm gonna go on 4 months without playing rainbow, I'm just gonna say, Fuck you ubisoft, Fuck you, I was enjoying this game so much, AND NOW 4 MONTHS UNTILL MY BDAY (22/7/2007) BECAUSE ON MY BDAY MY FRIEND IS BUYING ME A NEW PROCESSOR, AND NOW I HAVE TO GO 4 MONTHS WITHOUT FUCKING PLAYING R6, FUCK YOU UBISOFT, FUCK YOU.
---
Ingame config right?
---
Amazing community? Are we playing the same game?
---
But Casual is to relax, Ranked isn't relax time no matter what the rules on each gamemode is.
---
Yes everyone knows the system is garbage, but that's how it works
---
r/roastedalive
---
And sorry if i dont understand or have too many questions its just i can't understand it
---
Yes please
---
I haven‚Äôt played the new ops yet (I don‚Äòt own the season pass) so I‚Äòll just focus on the map.
---
Cons:
---
-Great SpawnPeeking locations
---
-still the glitched ‚Äûwidow‚Äú bug near camping place
---
-map is very complicated at certain points
---
Pros:
---
-great flanking potential 
---
-overall great design
---
Conclusion:
---
I really do love playing on this map and I hope the bugs and glitches get fixed. As well as some spawn points.
---
8/10
---
10/10 is plat 3
---
After getting a full team in only two of my ten placement matches this season I‚Äôve completely given up on the idea of my rank having any real bearing on how good or bad I am, just sucks to see this game so far from its potential 
---
If Someone on your team doesn't like your choices they could just report you for that and you might get banned.
---
A lot of people's opinions
---
Would work. Be useful for IDing teammates.
---
Maybe you did but didn't notice, this season pings feel different. Last season my ping would be something like 65

gonna have to buy hibanas elite now üòî
---
Old &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new trash. Dropped her after this came out lol. Hate it 
---
I mean it‚Äôs casual tho, just queue up again?
---
Despise the new one. Old was way better. At least her elite looks good though.
---
That‚Äôs bandit, IQ, and jauger 
---
Watch the replays. I promise you that 9 times out of ten you missed your shots. I used to complain too until I realized that.
---
Like Glaz said, a lot of people's opinions.
---
How about getting better anti cheat or hardware bans? Also my alt tab is so slow now after the update.
---
her new art is what i was talking about,  they made her look like big chungus
---
It IS free though, and the guys that made winrar made it that way so that no one would pirate it. They actually know that we abuse the free trials.
---
If I get killcam I teabag once as a well played lol, dought people think I'm doing it for that though haha
---
My condolences 
---
That's the hole problem in siege and Ranked solo.. 
---
It sounds nice on paper, but it would be awful. Enough people's pcs struggle with loading already, and this would make it much worse for very little practical benefit. 
---
It‚Äôs an article dude...
---
I thought you were talking about the picture didn‚Äôt realize it was an article dude...
---
The old one. The new one looks over inflated based on her actually in game self...
---
Plz fix
---
That looks new to me.
---
Yeah, I think that there are better things for the devs to work on than something like this right now. This is a really cool concept, but I don't think right nows the best time as. this would probably take a long time to get right
---
That challenge is glitched. We aren‚Äôt supposed to get it for another 2 weeks
---
Id still rather use 7zip over being pestered by ads everytime i log in
---
you can buy it now. its not a leak
---
But it's still annoying, and games shouldn't be annoying with everyone who isn't a dick just has to deal with it. I want to play the damn game, but it's hard when I get kicked for not clutching like this morning, twice in a row.
---
Well, this sub is generally non toxic, because people are patient enough to read and write. Those who are Toxic are immature, impatient kids.
---
/r/im14andthisisfunny 
---
Well, for me, I'll do dumb crap that's sweaty in cas just because its fun. Like spawnpeek my ass off and play super aggressively, or set up a bunch of kill holes and play ridiculous angles.
---
No, they just mentioned it in the "Known Issues" part of this driver release notes.
---
Old 
---
Lesion 
---
Stop posting this shit. 
---
No, not for this game.
---
Quality-wise I think supersampling is one of the best AA methods available, even though its performance hit is gigantic, but there is zero competitive benefit to it other than the game looking better.

No it's been there since the release.
---
It's no longer available in the normal multiplier because there is no cover at all there and people could just jump out a window to spawn kill at that point.
---
Can we have mozzie and gridlock appear upside down if this becomes a reality?
---
Xm black ice too?
---
She looked haunted in three old one. Look at her face. New one way better
---
Frikking heavy weights.
---
I like more the new one, but there are sime skins that looked better on the old one (halloween)
---
Best thing ever of the new map, I love itüòÇ. But pls fix ubisoft it could be too op for atackers and when you fix you can intigrate a drone parcour by the wheel this would be cool
---
On PC, a mic should be a requirement for ranked, it's just so essential
---
and that's also just like,your opinion man.
---
Lesion is probably a shout, along with Vigil, both pretty strong defenders. Go for Maverick too, and Nomad is also pretty strong.
---
Well all ops are good in there own way but, zofia, kaid, lesion, maestro are all good. They should add a way to play characters in a practice mode so you can see if you would like them
---
i just want to rappel on the roof of this place
---
Iunno. It's seemed pretty spot on to me this season, even with the crazy ping BS
---
I read your comment wrong sorry about that ;)

Hello shadow_kermit, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/az8bya/dont_you_just_love_the_new_perspective_ubi_fix/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I got a dup for black ice on the p90 you're lucky dude
---
You cant play ranked, the level cap is 30 to get into ranked
---
Happened with me today! Had to restart between the match to fix it.
---
Thats not a screen tearing, just a graphical glitch. Screen tearing is a term used for moving picture being composed by two or more frames at the same time.
---
Old.
---
Nice drawing
---
Infinite loading time
---
Maverick, Maestro, Kaid, Finka, Lesion, Mozzie however many of those you can get.
---
Mozzie is good gridlock is ass and the map is ass 
---
I really like Zofia
---
Stop posting this 
---
Why complain about something like this, it gives no advantage, it's not like it makes ppl invincible/invisible, it's not an exploit, it's just a bugged window, it's not game breaking either so......why 
---
Just add Mad Jack into the game. That should work
---
oh my god that's the cutest thing I've ever seen
---
No. If anything he needs a nerf down to 2 spiders. 
---
&gt;(R6 has strayed farther from reality than this suggestion, btw)
---
no?
---
I liked my old waifu :(
---
I actually like this. Would be a good doc counter. 
---
what you seem to be missing is that they are obviously joking. Lighten up a bit man
---
Apex legends still has trouble loading in skins, which is why you might not be able to pick your champion because you were busy loading while your team was picking.
---
"AWO-"
---
Looks like it's lost a lot of pixel throughout the reposts
---
You can't get suspended for exploiting bugs
---
Still no Black ice though :(
---
More like cortana
---
Taking off of leak, the SDP 9mm is broken, Both Jasper and Southern Regiment are appearing and disappearing every so often. Glitch on XB1.
---
i mean he has a point
---
I mean I get how you feel man, I used to get annoyed too. Sometimes you just gotta learn to not get mad or annoyed at things that have simple solutions, you know what I mean? It‚Äôs like the SI playlist thing were people were getting kicked for joining late or shit like that. It‚Äôs kinda like ‚Äú oh no your kicking me from a casual game that I can just queue up again for? Whatever shall I do!‚Äù
---
fucking Neo right there
---
played on that site in ranked once and a team went lion blitz and rushed the window before we understood what was going on. kinda disappointing but once you know its there you kinda just dont go that site and if you do just pick frost or something
---
One could dream
---
Great. Let's have the same conversation for the 100th time. This sub and reposts have a troublesome history.
---
He can already have more drones at his disposal than any single attacker and take almost a third of all the drones in any round if used effectively, why should he have more? Because teammates shoot them? That‚Äôs just an adjustment period, people will stop soon. 
---
most ambitious crossover in history
---
If they had an SSD it probably wouldn't be too bad. Unpopular half-joking opinion; anyone who uses an HDD to play Siege on PC shouldn't be put in games with those using SSDs in matchmaking (yes this would force all your friends to get SSDs if they don't have one and want to play with you but its for the greater good) or for more strict measures just temporarily ban them until they have an SSD.
---
The new one looks like absolute shit in my opinion 
---
No worries mate. I meant your age tho and I'm on PS4.
---

---
Nice one! But if you look closely at his head on the side you can *just* see a moustache too!
---
The reason you‚Äôre losing is probably because you are using mozzie
---
You don‚Äôt need voice chat to communicate. This is why there is a ping system in RB6. People including myself prefer party chat so I don‚Äôt get annoyed by teammates and so I hear sounds more clearly. I would love if Ubisoft updated the ping system more though. Apex is a great example of a very good ping system. 
---
I see what you're saying but cav's ability is just her walking extremely silently... she's clearly a pretty well trained assassin as that's what her kit is built all about so how is that unrealistic? And bullets irl are practically hit scan, they move fast enough at least to be basically hit scan at the close ranges the maps in siege are.
---
girl bye
---
That'd be cool but think how much longer the loading times would be. It's already pretty bad as it is now.
---
They're not all russian, two have a revolver ;)
---
88 been playing since Beta Oof (work 80 weeks though) I rarely get to play much anymore
---
cool
---
The amount of advertising for Burnt horizon, and plus they added new content so there will be bugs.
---
If you haven‚Äôt checked I am new why the fuck would I know this
---
oh no, its retarded
---
In my opinion villa is BY FAR the worst, hate that map
---
obviously didn't do very well
---
Nomad 
---
I got more, I have 0!
---
It's quite obviously a joke though, cool them tits.
---
Play siege without audio?
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
Thats your opinion mate, there is a reason why its in pl
---
That's Dokebi not Vigil fyi lol

I understand you want some juicy karma but this ain't cool. At the very least all you have to do is put the Artist's name in the title.
---
\-Cheers
---
I heard you poop your pants when you die
---
Most important sound effects (gunfire, footsteps, gadget use) are majorly in the mid area so if you want to min/max your audio I‚Äôd prioritize mids 
---
I've got enough toxic in my life
---
I have said to myself for about 6 months to save renown to get a bunch of alpha packs but as soon as I get 4500 I give in and buy one and I‚Äôm happy to say I got black ice for buck‚Äôs assault rifle
---
That is a huge disadvantage 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox too, so I already know how nothing happens to these losers that feel the need to be toxic af, which really annoys me whenever it happens
---
I'm from NZ and all my mates and I are experiencing 150 ping every other round. It's never been like this, usually have 20-30 ping. Why is this happening? Ps4
---
Real question is why is Dokkaebi in Vigil's place?
---
plenty of people have gotten to 100, and max I think i've seen is 500
---
I mean her face shrinked by a lot, need a story form them to explain this. 
---
But the game already has to load these models
---
[Insert op name here] ACOG? 
---
Oh no I‚Äôm sorry, not villa fortress lol. My bad
---
that was the most russian french man I've ever heard
---
Feels bad man üòê
