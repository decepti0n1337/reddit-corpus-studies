i‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a piston, when she pulls out the trax, she pulls out a handle attached to a rod, which looks exactly like that
---
---
---
That would be nice but then if you don‚Äôt like an operator ubi will never get your money
---
But that's true I'm talking only about Zofia, cuz that's pry self-explanatory. But Kaid for example... I have no idea
---
Ye they you can be kicked for just joining the game in casual lol, in another match i had capitao i shot a fire bolt and then 2 geniuses in my team (super trolls) just run towards the fire and stood there till they die and then I got banned for 30m for team killing. That's why I'm just playing ranked because you can't be kicked for no reason
---
i like em fugly

Alpha Packs' contents are determined when you acquire them.

Idea: after she uses both mirrors use the ability key to toggle down the visor, enabling her to see through the mirror on both sides

r/enterthegungeon in a nutshell
---
Maybe try turning V-Sync ON
---
Shit my bad üòÖ
---
I need you to spell it out for me.
---
&gt; flashbangs are incredibly inconsistent in this game
---

---
it is unbelievably inconsistent. honestly i have never seen a flashbang this inconsistent in prior FPS games. 
---
&gt; If a flash bang is very very close to you it doesn‚Äôt matter where you look, you‚Äôll still be blinded.
---
but how close is close, metres?
---
In what elo does this happen? Am i safe in copper 4?
---
there isnt but you can spawn peek all the spawns from 2-3 deffirent points
---
In siege the pvp concept is that operators are in simulated events that will train operators for a real threat while pve is the real ops v terrorists in action
---
I had the day of my life yesterday but today is just no. Just played another were it went 3-5 but my team didn‚Äôt say a word
---
Why.
---
THANK YOU,
---
That was the first thing that came to mind. horse. WTF.
---
Never heard or seen anyone play by this rule. It doesn't matter who defuses it, as long as it gets defused.
---
i have come from Battlefield. flashbangs are rarely used over there. my last experience of seeing plenty of flashbangs being used was MW2, but at least it was consistent there.
---
I‚Äôd like to see them put more focus on the situations.  Perhaps they put some new challenges to them or create some new ones focused around the new ops.  
---
I know most will get upset if Ubi puts any focus on single player content...but I‚Äôm with you, sometimes I just feel like doing something quick without any stress.
---
And here we have the wild Jaeger, after getting his acog removed and placing his ADS on the objective he now retreats to his den and lies in wait for a recruit to run by
---
All of these can be answered with ‚Äúit‚Äôs casual, nobody needs to care‚Äù
---
Basically you can mix guns from different CTUs so you could have the LMG-E (GROM) with the D-50 secondary (Navy SEALs)
---
I deleted all the "win a terrorist hunt" challenges but if it says"play one terrorist hunt with the x ctu" then i just play the hostage defence and i kill the hostage and boom challenge completed
---
Fokin Artist Sights!
---
Ingame model was fine, they could have just changed the art imo.
---
Neither look great
---
?
---
You're right. Silly me.
---
Bro its just casual.+ its not toxic to do runouts its part of the game.
---
Yeah, it is.
---
Well yes but doc is an anchor it's a fundamental aversion to his role in the game 
---
Don‚Äòt lose hope :) Siege Community is a lovely one once you get to know the right ppl :) 
---
Yea, this is Xvideos üòÇ, great drawing of IQ

This is true...but the screen tearing is pretty bad.

Are there any non-universal charms

How would he know that he didn‚Äôt say anything to his team then?
---
Just depends on the play. I personally like the 'ol switchero. Let them hit the prism then maneuver in over the plate and get 'em when they peak again, because they always peak again. Kind of throws her skins out of the play on something like that.
---
Absolutely not true. I had a friend who played FBI shield recruit and he came in clutch more times than I can count
---
Can you not participate in the pts? 
---
Bandit don't have an elite skin though
---
How old are you?

I wasn‚Äôt aware we were exchanging ages

I bet your close to my age lol

Thanks, just equipped it.

Or are you old asf and arguing with someone younger then you lol 
---
I doubt it 
---
Yes.
---
"sees ash main tag" aaahh i understand "goes into child explanation mode". See Casual stats are not shown ingame anywhere, only online if someone directly searches for your account. And the fact is, noone really cares about your stats as.   
---
There boom explained why smurfing just doesn't make sense.   
---
on the point it would be nice if Ubi maybe made an extra tab with season stats and then alltime stats. 
---
Noice
---
Ooo I love g2 who your favorite mines pengu 
---
I hate to break it to you, but black ice uniforms and headgears already exist, this applies to every season ever.
---
So you're blaming me for looking at the picture or am I missing something here?
---
No problem mon ami
---
Sooo... when Judge Dread Helmet for Mira?
---
how so?
---
I'm in love with you now
---
Don't buy any operators until y4 drops. I would say you should find some friends or meet some people you can play with in game. It makes it 100x better becuase it takes longer to get angry. I'd also say, if you haven't done so already, play the situations. They teach you a few of the classic operators and you can get a feel for the game 
---
I would team kill you in a heartbeat. 
---
but did you win
---
I role in a team so tuff 
---
its casual i doubt the guy cares
---
Then I don't see a point in having siege honestly 
---
I mean I got called 40 for drinking coffee once

Dangg, these look amazing. So excited for this elite, definitely copping.

Actually, don't answer that. I just now realized that you're a lowlife who's negative everywhere and hates everything. I'm wasting my time with you. Thanks for the nice comments!
---
I wanted this in a previous FPS as well, PAYDAY 2. And you know what happened when we got this? Dicks. All team mates I paired up with just drew dicks on the map. Imagine this power in the Siege community's hands.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
I thought with age comes wisdom but here we are arguing with someone younger cause why not go plan your retirement 
---
When Burnt Horizon drops, at the same time as everyone else. If you want to play them even earlier, you can play on the TTS. 
---
So. You like dick huh
---
I'm calling you out for being a tracer. You didn't just look at a picture and use it for reference, you traced it line for line and colored it in and called it your own art. I overlaid the official bandit art with your drawing and they are identical. 
---
You would think. Hopefully the new patches bring back the tactical spirit of the game. Platform?

just making sure, i was confused thinking \*this cant be bozen that aint his name\*

Took the season off, just barely completed my ranked matches playing solo.  Yeah my silver 1 rank is lower than it should have been.   Usually hover between gold and plat. 
---
Caveira. Do I have to say more?

Sneak 100 lol nice 
---
First of all they are not called ‚Äúsilencers‚Äù they are called suppressors 
---
That‚Äôs good to hear but several other games have it as well
---
I didn't even think of that
---
Thank you for the $5000 dollars now the blackground is free
---
Look it up, it is a snowy camo, nothing too exciting. This applies to every season ever for example operation velvet shell, there's uniforms and headgears named "velvet shell" as well
---
I like how you say that and with this set retirement age I would be in my mid twenties to early thirties normally 
---
Lol why are you mad?
---
Oh I knew that
---
I‚Äôm fucking dense
---
Thank you :D
---
And how exactly did you get up there? Is it just a simple vault on the printer? 
---
I've always wished they had skins based on the map, like in the biker bar let us take out some biker gangs.
---
I suppose wisdom does reside in you 
---
This also sometimes happens to me with steam games. If you haven‚Äôt tried installing yet try it. For me it always switches to locating game files.
---
I think it was lag and for him it still showed you looking left
---
Did your challenges register yet? I just started and nothing is completing. 
---
Nope sadly not turning is running left and right and the gear shifting thingies behind the wheel are the tilting so still kinda nice
---
Be warned, learning curve is pretty high. However it's so worth it imo. This game is so insanely fun once you get used to the mechanics. Also they're adding a newcomers playlist to the game that's aimed to have only new people playing against each other. That way you can learn the game with other newcomers and not get smoked by people who have been playing the game since day 1.
---
Some people say I've lost my mind. It's nothing to lose your head over really.

I'm Plat 1-2 and I am a solo que player. Eveeyone says I'm good, but I just feel like I get lucky. I guess I have good positioning and just don't peak what doesn't need to be peaked.

You mean... The lag-switchers/the broken shields/ Broken hit reg in general/The matchmaking (just examples)
---
Get used to it, it‚Äôs siege 
---
they really need to rework challenge system/ t hunt and make some worthwhile coop content, its such wasted potential , and they wasted so much resources on that cod zombies mode 
---
I want to tk from trying to read that

Good grief I'm not "hating" on him, I was respectfully disagreeing with the person that said it was a good play, that's it

A game where you could carry fucking 7 weapons and a large ass pickaxe and take then out of ur butthole and shoot a fucking rpg while standing still and not getting pushed back and a game where it's more realistic and you only carry 2 guns (1 pistol) and they at least have some recoil.

Head over to r/siegeacademy and you‚Äôll probably find some more help

Is it just me or do the graphics look better than PS4?
---
Like others suggest I would play a lot of terrorist hunt on normal difficulty and get a general feel for each of the maps. I like to turn off all maps besides one and run it until a feel comfortable. Once you get the feel of it you start looking at room names. Then you play in ranked and practice callouts and learn common callouts from other players. 
---
The rarity on them is insane, I've put 500 hours so far into the game and usually  get a pack at around 25% and even then I haven't gotten one 
---
Haha, I totally get what you mean. GG man ü§ôüèº
---
Castle buff?
---
Mission failed, we'll get 'em next time. 
---
They would never, due to the clear and distinct advantage that mnk has over controller. If you want to use a keyboard, play on PC, otherwise you're stuck with a controller. 
---
and here we see the smurf in his native habitat. research is still underway but scientists believe that over 40% of the revenue for r6 comes from these strange creatures hitting equally skilled combatants and deciding it's time to start again so they may once more "pwn the nubs in cas"
---
110% movespeed maybe
---
Okay they want to sell more copies of the game to make more revenue and at this point it's more profit. And you can just use VPNs to avoid the second part so essentially it negates your second point.
---
Same with break room, I wish we could drive through the and destroy them
---
Was her name dora?
---
Calm down
---
Or because she can control a lot of different angles at the same time? Always thought it was more of a control type thing (like in political cartoons)
---
7 rings to the Dwarves, 3 rings to the Elves, and 10 rings to race of Men
---
I have been playing for three years and recently began using sledge as my main. Using him correctly is a valuable asset.
---
it would be nice if we do this after every season patch
---
would be nice to know communities thoughts on recent changes every know and then
---
How is that a common? Hello? That's one of the coolest charms I have seen
---
good lord it wasn't free weeknd fuze
---
video would have ended before thermite could place his charge
---
ToXiC jager 5236 is my main account, I accidentally made the password too secure...
---
Well like I said, it was trash bc I didn‚Äôt play for a while
---
Because it would give an advantage to people using mnk over controller, which is true. But now everyone can have that advantage and not just people using the controller converters. 
---
Why is it speaking German?
---
Nah. Win delta for diamonds already show these ops are more likely gonna help you lose more than anything. Just because pros use them once Ina while doesn't make them good for the other of thousands of players who make a massive majority of players. 
---
Because it's too advantageous for mnk users. You're encouraging people to break the rules because it is actually considered by Ubi as cheating and a bannable offence. Furthermore, if they did do it that would cause a divide in the community, since actual console players would have to either buy a keyboard (so you want this game to become pay to win) or just stop playing altogether. So woo for unnecessary cross play, bye bye playerbase. 
---
Kaid is backwards
---
Exactly. People still complain even though they won't have to spend $50-$100 on an adapter. I don't get it.
---
Still waiting for legitimate reasons why adding native keyboard and mouse support will hurt rainbow on console. 
---
Just play a good game, like Apex Legends.
---
Fuck you
---
I really wish ubisoft fixed this matchmaking. I get it all the time and its complete bull. I recently versed a diamond that downed to bronze and was sealclubbing. It ruins the casual experience and those who just want to have fun, not be spawn peeked and unable to participate at all. 
---
unvaccinated kids
---
yeah ubisoft need to fix matchmaking, but toxicity, i needed those....
---
At least it's better than Fortnite

Funny I don't see him as an issue in my plat games. His paper shield is just a joke ü§£ 
---
Rainbow Six: Save the World
---
I'm thinking about trying to get him to get a career in this, you think that'd work out for him, maybe as like extra cash or just a hobby?
---
The infinite amount of ways you can approach a single objective, and the rush of getting a good 1 v 4 or 3 clutch.
---
Thatcher is the most critical imo. He can destroy every electronic counter the defense has. He‚Äôs who I started playing as back in the beginning lol. Maverick is also amazing I highly recommend him. 
---
Blackbeard is awesome lmao. Love playing him. It's not like he can deny forever, and his shields go quickly.
---
Happened to me yesterday a few times. Hopefully it'll get patched sometime. 
---
No
---
There already is one. It activated after ‚âà3 seconds, and actively pings your current location until you go back inside üôÉ
---
He is fine his shield is paper thin not my fault u can‚Äôt aim nerd

did i call it clip of the year?

Yes, on main accounts it can get everyones voice, and on sub accounts it can get yours and game volume. 
---
if you don‚Äôt understand the game then you shouldn‚Äôt be able to post on the sub. honestly. you need to be responsible for the shots you fire. blindly shooting an lmg while fuze cluster charges go off and Blitz and ash rush the room wouldn‚Äôt be fun to defend. why can‚Äôt some people understand this.

Not sure if its gonna be

Well i dont have a Brain can i use your?

Or just a second keyboard.

I would love one if these demonstrating all of the character counters. That would be badass.

That guy is boosting his own rank by playing with coppers. Anybody who does that is an absolutely garbage player.

Please tie this into rainbow six somehow I would be very impressed

It took a very long time (like 650 hours) but yeah... i see them finally.
---
Just spawnpeek lul
---
Nitro cells dont need a buff. They are fine as is. Shields used to die from nitros before and it made shield ops useless. 
---
A place that was fun to play, but didn't get enough love from Ubi &gt; so people stop playing &gt; so matchmaking got longer &gt; so less people play &gt; so Ubi cares even less &gt; so less people play.
---
I love THunt, but ubi doesn't. much sad
---
A system that makes you take the damage you try to inflict on others would work.
---
If you traded in the game why post this, it‚Äôs just a dig at the game for nothing now 
---
What did they say? They deleted the comment
---
Yeah the game already has so much going on with all the destruction and such that swapping to fov caused lag. We're stuck where we are. 
---
Same with the fps thing. Even a PSPro can't go over 60fps. Other games can hit 90 (or maybe more) on PSPro.
---
You can clear a whole trap in less than a second. 1 Speed op, shitty guns, huge hitbox. Nomad does everything Gridlock does but better.

i only agree with that statement because customs exist tbh

Thats terrifying to hear from a kapkan main , I think you are working for them.

What you are describing is called Ladder Anxiety and is very common in these kind of games.

Just giv him a good slap

That foot/leg work tho 
---
Who knows? We will see about that.
---
Got worked up cause I hate people being cunts for no reason it was literally my complaint about Seige. Every other major game has a good reporting system why does Seige not? As far as clapping back at him. I don't see why I shouldn't. If he can't take it he shouldn't start it. 
---
I tell myself higher ranks are full of cheaters (true or not) so I don't wanna go there anyway.
---
Fine where I am, just want fair and fun games.
---
I cannot remember the out right names of the weapons. I know the recoil goes up to the left on one and up to the right on the other auto gun. And he has a shotgun. He has a claymore and I believe breach charge as well. I use the claymore.

[Here's the qr code in higher quality](https://i.imgur.com/jPZya28.png). It's just a "Rainbow 6" search on your default search engine I believe. When I upload it to [webqr.com](https://webqr.com) it just says "Rainbow 6".

O to accept
---
He can talk shit,but can‚Äôt spell for shitü§£
---
Explain why the reply above you is incorrect and why yours is correct.
---
Kind of. You want the enemy to turn the corner and not have a chance to turn back. Although it‚Äôs not bad to have the lasers going across the doorway, you just want to try to get it so they can‚Äôt shoot it. 
---
I don‚Äôt think taking of acog was the right move they should try something else
---
I guess it depends on how you approach your reapproach if you know what I mean by that. There are two ways you can do this. You can either just meme your way through games, while sure it's fun for a couple hours, it gets unfunny and stale as you do it more. Or you can dig deep with this game and take the "sweaty" approach with your friends. Which is what I find is the meat of Siege and most of the fun is had. You can practice new, effective and different strategies with different maps and operators that are unique to you and your squad. Practice coordinating with each other and using your strats to your advantage. Working on your aim, and improving so you can get those sick nasty flicks. This is a competitive game man, embrace it. There's just an incredible amount of stuff that you can do in this game. It's up to you. 
---
Same
---
and like on almost all of the maps the railings are positioned from north to south. its good to keep that in mind if you want to open better line of sights. 
---
I don't know what I have just watched
---
I'm not even kidding , try meme weapons and cheese strats in casual. If you're really feeling defeated you might need to try some other game . For example I got fustrated with paladins , played overwatch for a month then started playing paladins again
---
that's why you just shoot them, instead of staring at the ground for half a minute
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs incorrect. Just that it doesn‚Äôt fit the situation.
---
The game didn‚Äôt have time to tell Doc that Fuze actually turned his face to him. 
---
[removed]
---
Nah she's too easy to spot and kinda useless imo
---
Those are the dudes from pre-Alpha
---
Still badass tho
---
Maverick or Maestro
---
Yo rip 
---
Probably Maestro
---
danke
---
pc master race that's why?
---
Thanks, i will try it next time, it thought it was some exclusive animation, what other ops do have these features? 
---
So fucking good!
---
The amount of times this happens in ranked... It's just the same as casual
---
So the game can register that he fired bullets at him almost instantly but it can not register that the shield was facing him as soon as he started firing? I think it's plausible to presume that the game's shield issues could also take part in this.
---
If they add a dungeon type thunt, with load of random objectives like for Go to room A in time -&gt; defend the room for 2 minutes, and so on it will be great mode. Even now we can add multiple types of differents tasks: reach room, clear room from enemies, defend the room, plant a defuser, defend a defuser, protect hostage, escort hostage - a lot of differents tasks to do.

I mean hearing Clash‚Äôs voice makes me wanna commit nitro-to-myself

I would say that instead of of having it like drop shotting when you are forced to stop adsing I propose that when you crouch while in a gun fight it throughs your aim off (Like if you crouch your aim goes up to the left - should be random just using up to the left as an e.g lol) so the odd crouch could be adjusted for but spam the button and good lucky hitting that barn door as your aim will go everywhere.
---
When I say throughs your aim off I mean quite badly but not so bad to make it impossible to recover.
---
Just my thought on the matter lol 
---
Most Kobe grenades from me end up in me getting myself killed
---
That‚Äôs karma for having a friend who plays with MnK.
---
But this is ok. You do it to gain a slight advantage, and everyone can feasibly do this. It‚Äôs the successive crouch spam that is the issue. When you get an Ash peaking a doorway by bobbing up and down while strafing, and she still has perfect accuracy then this is the issue. When you take away the ability to abuse the mechanic over and over again, then it‚Äôll be a lot more manageable. 
---
Maybe even slow down the crouching animation overall. Also maybe adding a small cooldown after you crouch before you can strafe again, while making it so you stop strafing while crouching. Another big issue is moving while crouch spamming. 
---
A lot of things can be done. I just personally don‚Äôt like the idea of taking someone out of aim while crouching is they are legit doing it for a tactical reason. It would help crouch spammers but punish others as well. I‚Äôm not a fan of that. That‚Äôs just me though, doesn‚Äôt mean your opinion is in any way wrong 
---
Any idea would do. But having inch accurate aim while changing stance is just not always possible. But offsetting the aim is definitely an idea they should consider
---
According to concept arts op might be from Frogman Corps or Jaeger Corps.
---
Yeah but he isnt american and m249 isnt even close
---
&gt;If this is TTS why is there no watermark and why is my charm black too?
---
He's from the UK and gets awful ping, he has to have some sort of edge when he's playing with me. Like real talk man I don't fuck with MnK, that's my only exception.
---
Focus on playning best you can, give info, don't listen to toxic teammates and try finding more peoples to play from reddit, facebook groups, maybe dreamteam.gg
---
I'd (probably) pick R4-C over the AK-12 currently while it still has acog and obviously the F2 as those are the only(?) rifles in the game that have a higher RoF than the AK-12.
---
But I probably agree that his AK has the highest stats (combined) out of all the weapons but they aren't high enough to justify playing a 1 speed operator on attack with a mediocre gadget and smokes as his only utility.
---
Black holo? 
---
not necessarily, i believe he will be picked more in higher ranks as they can use that specific moment of confusion and panic to disadvantage the enemy team and pick out their anti-roamers, just as they had intended for lion.
---
Yh  I was quite surprised not to see any news from crouchspamming at the invitationals apart from Q/E spam and yh, any idea could work as well as any other. Some may be fit for purpose and some probably not but ofc all ideas in siege are explorable. 
---
Shift is sprint though?
---
I was in restaurant almost laughed loudly
---
What about the duck chibi 
---
It's hard to do, man. Like sometimes I boot this game up and by the end of the session I hate everything to do with life.
---
When you're trying to play this game and you got people threatening to SWAT you and shit, it takes away your focus. Like yesterday I had some guy DOX me and spam my address in the chat. These are the people that I have to deal with on a daily basis. Walk a mile in my shoes pimp.
---
But would you want an operator that lost tho?
---
I'm guessing if you're released from a frost trap you're back to 20 too?
---
Not neccessarily. Plus they have armour to combat this if it's true. 1 arnours need the extra health as they take a lot of damage per round.
---
*Hi human!* It's your **5th Cakeday** Meadowcottage! ^(hug)
---
What I see is a lot of rapid firing, you should remember that doing that makes you miss shots far more. also he moving pretty fast. If you wanna rapid fire a DMR muzzle brake is your friend LOL
---
Can I buy one plz
---
Hey, if thats what you see fit, i cant change this. 
---
Yeah I feel like this is prob the best idea (not trying to be big headed) but it leaves you to couch as much as you want outside a gun fight, but when in a gun fight crouching you will get penalised, also not sure about this but I'd you stop shooting then you could crouch with no aim offset giving a little skill in crouching during a fight but making yourself vulnerable during that fight lol, would ld have to be tested for both lol
---
Last how? I would be playing him every round. Noone picks Capitao or Maestro. Noone takes Tachanka or puts lmg on Fuze. I get it not everyone is that smart but still there must be people with some brain to praise lmg main
---
You did
---
Oh look. It‚Äôs Voldemort 
---
Lost as in vietnam. Plus i play maestro occasionally, lmg on fuze and even zofia occasionally but this loadout is just american capitao lol
---
Terrorist hunt mode doesnt get the respect it deserves from UbiSoft.  I love playing it but wish they showed more attention to it.  Give us more features and settings.  Wish it had civilians you had to be careful not to shoot.
---
U right 0.0
---
Are you saying tower is better than skyscraper
---
See, your mistake is thinking the antlers make them big, when in reality their legs are fucking huge
---
yeahhhhhhh, I misread, I feel dumb now

Then remove fucking Capitao and add this

I mean the primary my inglish is not good sorry im from argentina

Recruit wins less gunfights because of no attachments, thats for sure.
---
He brings one less reinforcement which on a lot of sites can make or break the set up.

Primary gadgets are much stronger than secondary gadgets. Apart from a few exceptions.

There is literally no reason to pick recruit, hence why he is never played at the higher levels

Oh, hey :D Yeah, I took a break in about mid/late-Grim Sky and only played about 3 days in Wind Bastion, since I was burned out &amp; the game always loaded for like 5 minutes. But now I'm (partially) back and in full force. Though I still wanna finish Ghost Mode &amp; Ghost Mode Tier 1, so I'm not back fully.

Come back when you actually know anything about football kid

*Krhhrhr*

if you have equal reaction time and good aim 2 bullets is huge.

‚ÄúThen been playing on NA‚Äù so are you from EU on the NA server? Tbh the NA strats are different from EU and there‚Äôs more higher level players as a opposed to lower ranks on EU

What ac would that be?

&gt;it shows how succesfull a game can be yet it has so many hacks.

Okay, which has what to do with how easy it is to stop?

what of the blackbeard's aim is just as good as yours? Does he just win cuz of the shield?

If I ever stooped as low as cheating in a video game I‚Äôd do you all the favour

not really, I played back then and I still believe he is broken today, less than he was before ofc. His ability is a crutch for bad players.

PC, non-Steam full version
---
shield desync is a bug and it is not "working" when you change directional angle mor than around 45 degrees, and this was rotation for around 90 degrees. And latency delay and shiled desync bug is NOT the same thing. Even if shields worked 100% correctly, situation like this could still happen. Same as you can die when already behind cover  in your client. Thats how latency works. Unless you or anyone invent some kind of better network without delay, this will always be the case.

That's not how the meme works. Those skins are nothing like each other. Only 1 part is similar.
---
We have holograms, giant person outlining drones, and soon robot bugs. Idk if this one is too far fetched imo.
---
But then it changes it for everything you do anywhere on the system unless you're constantly turning it off. This is a standard for every fps theres not reason it shouldn't be in the game.
---
I tried pc gaming and I honestly don‚Äôt like it lol
---
He literally hit him in the back of the head and got lucky
---
You don't. There isn't dedicated controls for leaning like their are on PC. Luckily, even MnK users cant do this on console.
---
I just hate the stupid airsoft based high cap magazine model, it‚Äôs as nonsensical as Mavericks 10 round fat mag. And if they do drop the damage maybe they could make it the shorter evo smg barrel length?
---
You really hate jazz
---
Because Dok doesn't really do anything that Pros find useful. 
---
Need to take map control? You drone your entry fragger in. 
---
Need to get rid of cams? No point bringing Dok, just bring Ash or Buck instead and nade/charge them.
---
There's not much reason to bring Dok unless your strat allows for it like G2's can with Fabian solo lurking/flanking.
---
It is they can‚Äôt control people leaving at the beginning of the match really

Whoosh
---
Yes, it was sheer luck. That's half the reason i would have been so hyped about this game. The one thing I've learned as i get deeper and deeper into Siege is that if one is to enjoy themselves, they must embrace the bullshit.
---
Because you're a bronze and you couldn't hit with any weapon so it makes no difference. Her recoil graph is first shot goes on target, every successive shot lands randomly within a metre in every direction of where you aim.
---
It is not possible to control it because it is entirely random, there isn't a specific direction it recoils in, it just fires in a cone of nonsense.

Fockin laser soights
---
I mean irl
---
I dont mind the gun where it's at, I play with flash hider to help control the horizontal recoil and then just tap fire or small burst fire and it's pretty manageable. I feel like ela isn't about running around the map like a madman either though I play her as a area denial op, where I'll place grzmots in choke points where I know attackers will cross then just hold it down.
---
The game is not "luck based," you are more than likely just doing something fundamentally wrong when you play. Siege is a game with a very steep learning curve. You have to know the maps quite well, and for each one there's certain minute things you have to know to properly defend each site (or attack, for that matter). You also need to have a sense of what's going on, and know when you should or shouldn't get aggressive. Even if your teammates are throwing, you should be doing your best to make plays, and carry if you have to. As KiXStar, a pro player once said: "if you can't 1v5 every round at your current rank, you don't deserve to climb. Focus on you." While he's obviously exaggerating, he's right in saying that you should always try to see how you could have fixed the situation, even if it wasn't your fault that you lost.
---
If you really are interested in getting better, I would recommend a few things:
---
-Play the game. Play ranked. Experience is the number one way to improve, as with any game. The more you play, the more you will realize your mistakes and be able to fix them in the future. 
---
-Watch tutorials and high level gameplay. There is a lot to learn from Pro League, and many people post really good tutorials, such as Coconut Brah, VarsityGaming, Aust1n and many more. These can actually be really helpful for beginners, especially when it comes to things like settings, weapon attachments, et cetera.
---
-Find a team, and stick with them. Whether it is with friends or randoms from an LFG site, playing with the same teammates will teach you how to play well in a team, give good callouts, and co-ordinate with others. Focus on making things work, and make sure they are also enthusiastic about improving and becoming a better team.
---
If you don't have the patience to learn and get better through experience, that's fine, but don't go blaming it on "luck." Siege can seem random, but the main way to get over that is to learn the game more fully. Deep down, while Siege certainly has its fair share of flaws, it's a great game at the end of the day.

There's nothing that anyone else can do to help you. People will always leave if they want to despite any penalty or punishment. If you care about ranking up find people to squad up with.

Shet ur right
---
I'm saying how you can still get kills with a 1x sight  + bad stats (like Kaids gun according to you) with good aim instead of relying on high ROF or damage. also the reason why doc/rooks mp5 is good is because the recoil is easy as hell. it could have a 1x only sight and it'd still be good. I really don't understand how that is such a hard concept to understand but I guess that comes par for the course when you have to rely on whether or not a gun has a acog to get kills or not.
---
Yes :D
---
Man that lag on the defuser locate lmao. Literally counter defusing and then the game's like WE FOUND IT
---
Thank you for speaking the truth. She is in a great spot now, and only gets complaints because shes not what she used to be. Ela is my top defense op and I've played her since she came out, but I was almost exclusively a shotty main with her, because I like her up close power. When the scorpion was a laser and she had impacts she was just too strong. People now just complain that since she isnt that monster (ie "I'm mad I cant just hold down the trigger and kill all of the enemy team anymore") and sometimes I feel that when we see stuff about her it's from players who weren't there when she came out. Because I remember when you saw ela on the other team you were actually worried because she could just come out of no where when you hit a mine and just destroy you in an instant. Scary times. (No offense to original poster if you haven't or have played when ela came out just a trend I've noticed. Not meant to diss just bring up disconnects with various "generations" present in the game.)

People like to play them because they're cheap operators and can win rounds easy. Nobody likes playing AGAINST them. They don't belong in a game like this and I think people that want more of them don't know much about game balance tbh. Shields are dumb. 
---
He has one on the mask on his face but i believe the mask also connects to 2 more on his back
---
Ela is great. I just don't like her gun's randomness. I would be fine if gun had ANY type of crazy vertical/horizontal recoil, just not RANDOM shaking. Make it skillfull to use. Make recoil pattern you can control if you practice enough. Any random shit just kills the fun.
---
When people play smoke/mute most of them use shotgun with smg-11, even it has a ton of recoil, but you still can master it. Ela's gun is pure luck sometimes.
---
As for your post, I would prefer first option. 
---
They definitely are for certain ones. Lore confirms it.
---
Get a good connection.
---
I can play with you, I‚Äôm unranked, but I‚Äôve been solo-queuing and need someone to play with, last rank I was gold 2 from solo queuing back in chimera 
---
They tried, but server providers backed out in the last minute.
---
You're just trying really hard to poke holes in the can here guy.
---
It could provide a larger blast than a breaching charge that's why. 
---
Its a concept. Chill lmao 
---
that‚Äôs what i thought I don‚Äôt see why not 
---
Christianity shouldnt be associated with the "young earth" belief. 
---
I wish thry would bring outbreak back, it was so much fun
---
Mira
---
Cool u got discord? We can play some rank
---
Then JK
---
Crikey!
---
I main it on all my guns because i manage recoil better with it if that makes any sense. 
---
can't agree more
---
I have at least 100 of these
---
I‚Äôm not bothered about people‚Äôs ping, but more about the plats/diamonds who server hop to play at bronze on another server, lets them keep their rank but also smurf on the same account, it‚Äôs bullshit
---
Damn, but I am wearing socks 
---
Dude, that‚Äôs such a good comparison you made with the SMG-11. That small buff they made after they ruined it made all of the difference in the world. Made it controllable and learnable. That‚Äôs the type of adjustment I want to see, maybe even a but better given it‚Äôs a primary weapon.
---
I do have it 
---
The last thing siege needs is another shield
---
High settings must be ok. I am playing with 4 GB ram, low end processor and a GTX460 around 30fps on the low settings, so dont worry.
---
I'm down need to get more people for next season amyway
---
They're are so many counters to shields dude don't say they're cheap because you're unable to counter them. 
---
If shields were truly unfair they wouldn't be in the game.
---
Nope. You start from the beginning.
---
It's useless concept.
---
Without an ssd, slow. You'll load very slow usually. If you can add some for a 250 or 500gb ssd, do it. Otherwise it's looking good!
---
Ok thank new to this whole pc thing so not quite sure what to look for
---
Yet you haven't really proven much of that have you?
---
Talk to server companies such as google, amazon, or Microsoft. Ubisoft has little say in it.
---
I did multiple times lmao. also,, youre getting nothing but negative feedback. Im not the only one that thinks the idea is stupid.
---
Did I have a stroke??? Cause I laughed at the fact that he thinks it takes skill to main blitz not trying to jab at him though we have sorted things out 
---
Ok thanks I‚Äôll look into it 
---
Cool dm me discord
---
I think there is a 20 character limit. üò£
---
How do u do it
---
Good point tho tbh
---
And whats your rank rn?
---
Clash's pistol is a CZ p10c. The FMG9 is based on a Glock, I had forgotten about that since no one uses it lol. They probably should have saved that gun for the Secret Service operator this year.
---
Stuff like mouse stuttering or input not being picked up occasionally 
---
Yes but old ops need some service to them too you know
---
I would want to help more but i can't because of my bad English, sorry about that. 
---
Thank mate 
---
Well that‚Äôs the same thing that happened to me so I‚Äôm not 100% sure but most likely yes also it‚Äôs easier to get the standard operators then the DLC operators much easier
---
Your good I completely understand. 
---
You're gonna have to start from scratch unfortunately
---
Well I don't think this is very op because it would be the same as shooting open a wall yes? Very impractical unless you have a shotgun, and still yet using one of the gel sheets to open a wall when you have someone who can just blow it open is a big waste of utility
---
It ain't. Some ops may benefit from this a lot especially ops with weak guns.
---
&gt;youre getting nothing but negative feedback
---
Have you even read the comments?
---
And no. You made some half ass remarks and it was shot down. 
---
I'm not looking for this to make it into the game. Arguing with you about the logistics is useless. 
---
I just enjoy creating these kinds of things because it's almost a challenge and I enjoy that. 
---
no we just do the platin trophy for r6s
---
The new Super-90?
---
You can't have bolt actions in siege
---
You made it sound like you accept those rules and that's an issue
---
Hey how did you get your rook flair?
---
So cute.
---
General reposti 
---
And Semi-automatic slug shotguns do? What's the logic here. Explain why then.
---
I'm not proud of how many times I backed up the drone and inserted it again
---
They really need to bring this back it was amazing 
---
I agree the only time I watch siege on twitch is to watch pengu play go4s on Sunday but other that that I don't really watch r6 content on twitch 
---
Yelling "Kobe" while throwing something is for accuracy, while yelling "yeet" is for power and strength.
---
stop posting these. 
---
Lmao that‚Äôs so funny
---
The holographic is the most precise and the reflex has the smallest housing. Red dot is the best at neither.
---
Things blitz is good at : 
---
Blinding enemies.
---
Melee Kills.
---
Things blitz is not good at at:
---
Damage output (Only a pistol).
---
Being quiet (everyone knows where you are)
---
Any range over 10m.
---
Blitz can be annoying but he is balanced. He can help with roamers but sucks overall, selfish ability, loud as hell, limited gunfight capability. I play blitz occasionally for a laugh but if Im playing to win, he doesn't even come close to my top picks. 
---
I don't like it personally because it blocks a lot of your peripheral vision. I also don't like the holo that much either. If I can't use an acog I stick with the reflex
---
They can only do so many at a time. They have 3 reworks coming this year along with a new map. 
---
Then just remove him. He's a sniper. Otherwise he's just weaker black beard. 
---
Well he is a good roamer with his shotgun, 52 round maged P90 and a acoged smg. Roamers mostly use P90 or the shotgun while anchors use the smg or shotgun. His shotgun is really good and him having an acoged P90 makes him one of the best roamers with the ability to over heal with 3 armor AND a good anchor with the ability to heal / get himself up.
---
TL;DR he is a good roamer and a good anchor with the ability to heal himself and good guns with acogs with a good shotgun.
---
Perfect backboard 
---
This may possibly be the worst suggestion anyone has ever made on this subreddit. 
---
 :( 
---
Being a doc main doesn‚Äôt make you a try hard. Maybe learn to get good at the game. 
---
My guy i see more mp5 roamers than p90 and almost no one uses shotgun 
---
She only got 20 +1 rounds 
---
Its s repost?
---
If you actually believe the original base was better I feel sorry for you...
---
Part of me says that when you shoot a teammate, it should damage the one doing the shooting. The other part of me says that people should just grow up and play the game right. It‚Äôs honestly the community that‚Äôs at fault, Ubi shouldn‚Äôt have to get involved. I‚Äôm happy they‚Äôre coming out with a ‚Äúfix‚Äù, but stupid people will find other ways to be toxic. They play games to be toxic and that‚Äôs them having fun. They won‚Äôt go anywhere, they will always be there to piss you off no matter the cost. 
---
Tl;dr play with friends and don‚Äôt have toxic teammates. I mainly solo queue, but if you play with friends you don‚Äôt have to worry about that crap
---
Lets raid the xim forums
---
if you think he‚Äôs just a weaker blackbeard then you don‚Äôt know how to use him. he was op before the changes. now he‚Äôs going to be better at the role of SNIPER. his job isn‚Äôt running in room and killing everyone. 
---
Yes :)
---
Its because the acog advantage that he has on 2 guns. He has the ability to spawn peek easily and he can heal himself after any engagements so he's just good for the job 
---
They said it will never come back because they would have to constantly update it to keep up with the rest of the game and it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it as I‚Äôm sure their projections probably showed it would lose popularity over time. I understand why they made it limited time, no point in wasting time and resources on a game mode that people wouldn‚Äôt play anymore. 
---
Holy shit
---
I know the new map is way more balanced but that doesn't mean it's better. I had way more fun on the old map. 
---
It's been a while
---
Why save a screenshot? I‚Äôm confused..
---
Eww
---
[Mira](https://imgur.com/s6mxRPV)

Pretty cool
---
His ass too thicc to take damage
---
Just shoot them. lol
---
It‚Äôs ugly
---
Why?
---
What region are you in. Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt run their own servers they use Microsoft servers and they‚Äôre missing in a lot of key regions like Middle East and India, or South Africa causing these people to have terrible pings 
---
You can shoot through the corners right there. (My friend and I discovered that last night)
---
He‚Äôs fine and entertaining imo but to each their own

I‚Äôm sorry for your loss..
---
Idk he was pretty simple to use. Toss a smoke and push a room with his thermal site. Not rocket science, bud. Not compelling gameplay either. 
---
Really don't believe you're diamond because if you have any understanding of the game you know that TKing plays a pretty big role in the general gameplay, if you could have fuze use his ability on a room while his teammates run in unaffected by the explosions that'd be OP, if you had attacks who could run in through grenade explosions that'd be OP, if you could run through capitao's bolts that'd be OP, etc. The game would be incredibly unbalanced against defenders in almost every situation. Just because you're upset that your last few games have had TKers doesn't mean removing it is a good idea, find a premade or just accept this is how people behave.
---
Most people use the MP5 on Doc because it‚Äôs there best weapon 
---
I rarely see people use the P90 and the shotgun is a meme gun
---
Yeah this guy must be bronze or something 
---
I would say hibanna cuz she is cheap, then mav
---
I rarely play clash but when I do it‚Äôs hilarious just to see the enemy teams brains melting before my very eyes. They just don‚Äôt seem to realize how much clash stinks at 1V1s and do dumb stuff like that Ying wasting a candela for no reason 
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Woah

[Fixed it](https://imgur.com/a/abizbwC)

Let's just add wallrunning and Titans while we're at it.

It's always neat when enemy teams are all bots
---
You read it wrong, I'm saying I don't think I've played a game with characters that are worse in relation to everyone else than Fuze/Chanka
---
I saw someone get beat by their dad in Domino's
---
personally it would be buff jackal, nerf glaz, remove clash.
---
Glaz is already getting nerfed, but I couldn't think of much else.
---
Congratulations, you found one video where someone does that. Played long enough to know that this happens very rarely, people don't care about the points, they just want to win.
---
Get Tachanka, he's the best operator by far. 
---
Is it like one of those ‚ÄúMarry, F*ck, Kill‚Äù games?
---
wow ur a cool memelord
---
I'd say stick to operators with a passive ability, such as Rook, Valkyrie, Castle.
---
On attack I'd say stick with ops such as thermite since you won't need to worry about dying too much once you've done your job.
---
you can start worrying about grenades now
---
Props to whoever at Ubi decided to use actual code for this. Ternary operator ftw.

The problem with the new Hereford as Ubi said i‚Äôm their recent interview about reworks, they got carried away while reworking to the point where it doesn‚Äôt resemble old hereford whatsoever 
---
Great for spawnpeeks lowkey 
---
Buff Twitch, nerf valkyrie, remove jackal.
---
What this dude said, but with the MP5.
---
Half expected a "hello world" tbh
---
Would it make sense though? I thought Switzerland‚Äôs whole deal was neutrality and not getting involved in conflicts.
---
It was more of a snap than flick but very smooth 
---
What a bot lol throwing grenades at his teammates and got lucky it bounced off
---
ü§Æ
---
Oh thx
---
Do not get Castle! A new player with Castle is a terrible idea, they'll Castle vital doors or lock you in OBJ 
---
Yeah I feel lucky with those picks except the Aug because I never use IQ but my dream rolls are The rifle glaz uses (I'm jealous of a friend that has it) the 417 and the French revolver (also jealous of that same friends who has both) is it possible to get it for newer operators? 
---
Attackers:Sledge,Buck,(both pretty much do the same but sledge is easier to use and imo better right now), Zofia,Nomad,Jackal plenty of other good ones
---
Defenders: Jager,Rook,Doc,Pulse,Lesion(strongly recommend) echo there‚Äôs more as well but this all to the top of my head. Enjoy!
---
Buff Fuse, Nerf Lesion, Remove Frost
---
Rook is a good pick for a newbie, super easy gadget, just drop plates and start learning how to play. Sledge on attack is quite good for easy gadget too. Once you start to learn the maps you'll be able to start improving with more complicated gadget placement etc. Don't let toxicity get your down. People will vote to kick if you're not doing great. Don't let it get to you. They'll TK too. Don't let it get to you either. You can lfg a full squad or keep at it until you get a less toxic lobby.
---
The are quite a few decent YT channels from learning the ropes, up to ProLeage strats. Have a look on the. I watched a lot of Iceycat when i first started playing. Helped me a lot. Good luck!
---
Now your just lying because there‚Äôs not a single silver badge anywhere on my stats and I‚Äôve been plat most of the time lmfao nice try thoughüòÇüòÇ 
---
I‚Äôve been seeing people make the point about how stationary ops typically don‚Äôt work but Glaz is an exception because glaz can do what no one else can and that is see through smoke. Glaz was far to strong before and this nerf is a great move. With this change rather than shut down an entire room he can shut down angles akin to what Blackbeard does now. 
---
Woah woah lets not end up getting blitz nerfed here alright 
---
Yeah I suppose, get maybe bandit or mute?
---
unplayable

Don‚Äôt break someone‚Äôs Mira‚Äôs, even if you think you‚Äôve got an easy kill. It could be a tactical placement that will compromise your location. 
---
Don‚Äôt play Castle unless your team is communicating. 
---
Don‚Äôt put Ela mines next to a camping teammate. 
---
Be careful with Bandits or Kaids electricity because they can destroy friendly gadgets. 
---
Kapkans and Frosts are better in a spot where they are hard to see but they might not always get someone. On the flip side, check doors and windows thoroughly for traps. 
---
Caviera isn‚Äôt silent. Vigil isn‚Äôt invisible. 
---
Zofia, and any team with a Doc or Finka, they aren‚Äôt dead until they‚Äôre dead. 
---
Always deploy your Rook armor or pick up someone else‚Äôs armor.
---
Don‚Äôt Twitch shock people unless you‚Äôve already destroyed all the gadgets. 
---
Maintain situational awareness. 
---
And don‚Äôt forget to have fun. 
---
Is this dumb? Dude it‚Äôs like trolling you use it to duck with the other team and it becomes annoying to play against. Not because of skill or strategy but because of all aim no brain. It‚Äôs fun to play hard to counter at all when the shield player is of equal skill as the other player. 
---
Yes im better then 95% of players on console
---
Mute is a very good option because it gives a new player the understanding of countering certain abilities but it's less likely to mess up the team if they're not putting them in the right spots. 
---
dont worry my comrade my lmg is already deployed
---
Glaz needs his ACOG he used to have during Beta. It will classify him as a dedicated sniper. 
---
Her icon is basically a drawing of one of the x-karios pellets, the sides of the pellet don't represent the amount of pellets

She‚Äôs wearing under armour shoes

what do you mean??

I would tell ya

Why can't this happen to meüò§

Yeah they announced ops will drop in price the older they get, there's a chart somewhere

Its floating 
---
Is this the satellite back at Team Rainbow‚Äôs headquarters? 
---
that's an upvote pose duh
---
Mira is just a mirror, and is one of the best operators so far

Ish

The worst part is that your Blackbeard so the opponent cant do anything back

1 year old ops will be 20k, 2 year is 15k, 3+ years is 10k renown

I was a consistent plat 3 and edging in and out of plat 2 sometimes but had like a 2/3 month break during wind bastion, just starting to full get back in now so imagine at the moment a bit below my usual standard haha 
---
He doesn't. The other British operators do, though, inspite of having gas masks. I believe the others are physically broken in some way.
---
Nope, that's his exhale valves which keep him from breathing out of the respirator
---
UBI did say they want them to play a support role
---
Lmao at the amount of people choosing 'no, my rank is lower than it should be'
---
What's your collection count up to? And which operators? 
---
I like the emo hibana look more, but very nice elite skin
---
Doesn't Glaz have a slightly above average win delta and under picked? If people arent picking a strong operator why would they nerf him lol. Why does this not make sense to me, what am I missing? 
---
Is this typically how they rework operators in the too stronk under picked category?(I haven't paid any attention to yearly reworks I just dove back in after not playing since season one so this is the first set of changes I'm watching)
---
You‚Äôll get that rank on pc in like 200 hours easy. And to train your aim I highly recommend playing csgo
---
I‚Äôm not anywhere that I can check, but I‚Äôm pretty sure Lion and Finka have the same oxygen filter as he does but they‚Äôre still affected by the gas
---
Thank you, I was big upsetti at this post lol

Yeah bUt iTs UniVersAl, nOoB.

Montange absolutely GNOMED that jager

---
This game takes some time to get used to and get good at. Sometimes it takes forever to figure things out and your different play style. 
---
Be patient and don‚Äôt get frustrated too easily! When I started I saw every little frustration as something to improve on. Watching the kill cams is a good way to learn on what to do better. 
---
Be creative. This game has a lot of creativity on where to breach from and things to do. Learn from other players and also just do trial by error. 
---
Have fun and make friends. (But also know some parts of R6 can be toxic as hell!) 
---
Terrorist hunt is a good way to warm up and also learn some things too. Personally doing all the situations single player helped me in the beginning. 
---
You‚Äôre gonna do great. Just have fun with it! 
---
Play with some coppers to tank the elo, since ubisoft seems to have accepted it as fair practice. 
---
Just let me play defenders on Terrorist hunt classic and I‚Äôll die happy
---
What a bunch of doofuses lol
---
I guess keep playing and if those people you are playing with are not as good then you can kick them out but you might not want a random. Just keep playing and you will eventually find a sequence of easier opponents to beat.
---
yeah kinda like in cs aim botz map
---
Caveira should get removed from the game.
---
Doink!
---
I‚Äôve always been interested in cs I guess its due to similar aspects of r6 but thank you I am going to look to getting a pc when I can

I recently (summer 2018) switched from War Thunder to Siege as my main game to just relax and play solo and honestly this is the nicest thing about doing so. When I got pissed off in War Thunder it could have been for a myriad of reasons, many of them the game's fault (almost as bad as when I played WoT before it but atleast in WT I didn't get to see dev sponsored cheating blatantly in front of me), where as with siege a good 90% of the time if I'm getting annoyed or frustrated (rarely does the game get me really pissed off, at least not anywhere near as much as WT did) it's simply because I'm getting outplayed and that's kinda nice in a way. Sure there is the occasional mechanic that can be frustrating ~~looking at you Blitz~~ but most of it isn't that bad.   
---
  
---
~~Though the insistence on only balancing things around E-sports can be a bit frustrating~~
---
Why should they not support it?
---
On an extremely well coordinated team he's a monster. But everywhere else he's just under utilized and underpicked. I'm thinking with these changes, he's just not going to see the light of day anywhere. He's overwhelming in the right hands and with the right team composition. Now he'll just be underwhelming across the board. I'm not against these changes, but I think he needs to see a buff in another area other than his primary and ability. Dok is a great choice for most because she can handle long range engagements with a strong DMR, great ability, and also engage in cqc with her secondary. Glaz just lacks any close range potential, only having access to a pistol for his sidearm. 
---
Damn bro, go off.
---
Who takes her place if she is?
---
I am not joking I‚Äôve played csgo for 1000+ hours and my aim is good in any game I play
---
It's definitely a learning curve, not just playing on pc but the way ppl play. My buddy was diamond on Xbox but when he switched to PC he stays around gold 1. Very good player but he said people on pc play a lot differently. 
---
He should throw it at the enemy
---
Then why did you reply to me?
---
But there‚Äôs no place for a true sniper in Siege. Just doesn‚Äôt work 
---
Imo, Renown still matters. I spend much of my time trying to get renown so I can get more OPs.
---
Man, they were greedy for that kill, damn
---
Oh ya they were hahaha
---
They downvoted him, because he told them the truth. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôd be a lot easier if somebody just told me ‚Äúhey there‚Äôs a fat ass hole being made next to you‚Äù
---
he still has two, simply they were rotated to be in the same exact position.

I wasted so much money on these

So am I so it may not be a thing anymore but a long time back a lot of the bigger clans had members that also had GM accounts and quite often used it to their advantage in both clan battles and just regular matches. The match that made me quit was when me and one other guy were the only two left on our team and we managed to push to their cap faster than they got to ours and we were about to win when the capture stopped at 99 and theirs suddenly jumped to from 70s to 100. Almost the entire enemy team was part of one of the biggest clans at the time. I don't remember a lot of specifics (like the map name) cause it was long ago but it's still my best example though I know they used it for other more subtle things as well.
---
Base ops were 500-1000-1500-2000. Bur if you have starter(?) edition, they are all 12.5k(i guess)
---
Has this been happening on just siege or has this happened in other games as well? 
---
Dude I mained Bandit Kapkan and Thatcher for so long I was so upset when all the changes were made. I would always run to the most likely entry points with Kapkan and get easy kills so many bandit tricks and plays after with all the new ops things are not the way they used to be. I wish Ubisoft released a base ranked gamemode with only vanilla ops. 
---
Says the PC Player, if you want to use keyboard and Mouse go on PC. You have probably never played against a MnK while using a controller.  This shows through what you are saying.

Console is for Controllers.

I haven't been playing any other games so I can't say for sure. 
---
The guy nearly has 80,000 renown 
---
No, they meant =\=. It's the same thing
---
I've said multiple times I don't care about her weight. I posted it because I thought it was funny/interesting.  This Fluvio kid is demanding scientific evidence of a video game characters thickness. So yeah, I called him insufferable.

Lion doesn‚Äôt have any exposed skin

Welcome in 2015
---
3 word comment = half life 3 confirmed

I bought every operator with renown, and every gun attachment I preferred. Wheres my refund

Why does mute have filters at all?

You're welcome ;)

goddamnit i didnt think it was possible but they still did it
---
Nor do I. Just interesting/funny to think about. 
---
Das me

I'll repost this next week, easy karma

My first one was fuze. God damn the memories. I only fuzed hostage twice in my entire career(one i fuzed the room, second i fuzed upstairs and hatch was open). Thats a shame and im a dissappointment for fuze mains, i know! Im trying to get better and kill more hostages
---
It might be worth trying on another game. I know a friend of mine has a similar issue where his game freezes about 2 hours in and he gets a major ping spike because his Uplay client crashed. He only has this happen on Ubisoft games as well and we found out bc we played bfv together for a couple hours and his PC ran fine
---
No it wasn't a welcoming experience 
---
You can't kill more then 2 friendlies without being kicked. Haha
---
Fair point
---
Would look better without the cartoon teeth and eyes. 
---
üíØ twitch has the best shark skin/ best gun skin in the game
---
I appreciate this repost as a new player, thanks. 
---
Straight facts
---
We know
---
‚ÄúY‚Äôall smell any dead dinosaur around here?‚Äù
---
Exactly, they're so needlessly bad and have been for so long
---
He finna look like mute 2.0
---
I also like shortened clips without the unecessary parts
---
/r/onewordeach acktchually
---
wtf
---
the change is meant mostly meant to lower her insane userate by making her less comfortable for many players and not to reduce her fragging potential.
---
I still think we should of gotn are renown back :(
---
Why the eff would one objective open up before another? That‚Äôs not how overtime works. I don‚Äôt exactly understand how this works, but unless they change the concept of overtime, this is not that.
---
I actually prefer the A2 handguards over rails.
---
smh lol
---
Quick but not so much lol
---
It isn't
---
I may be wrong but I think the balaclava Lion wears under his mask breaks the seal of the mask.
---
It wouldnt be THAT bad if it didn't have those wanky side rails

Met some awesome dude in Casual today and we had some knife fights. Afterwards, we took this picture to share!
---
Well I wanted them, so I paid for them. 
---
So I technically should get a refund.
---
Hmm maybe try to hold down the right stick to control the recoil lol
---
Say you were 12 when you first started playing siege in y1s1. You‚Äôll be 16 and only 4 years older than the 12 year olds that started playing now, you‚Äôd also be still a kid

Happy cake day!

Hello imnotrussianim, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/aue4j5/it_was_34_matchpoint_to_enemy_team_and_the_round/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I would be on board with this 100%. It would give you an actual reason to pick Lion. Once the ‚Äúrework‚Äù goes live he‚Äôs going to be terrible 
---
Is that not in the game anymore?
---
Feels bad
---
Arent they already chanching her smg recoil in as seen on the tts?
---
AIYAIYAIY
---
Damn, how do you walk with balls that big?
---
literally. how long til people are posting shit like 'dae remember the good old days of lean/crouch spamming?' and a bunch of daft bastards will be commenting 'ah yeah those were the days'
---
Oh ok. Do you know what the Indian equivalent of the FBI SWAT is. 
---
True
---
Proleague question isn't new.  It's been there since as long as I can remember doing these.
---
Is it connection problems?
---
I roll
---
On the sides there are 2 little ones 
---
I think you‚Äôre right 
---
still, what if you kill a downed teammate that cav is interrogating by accident and then try to reset someone?
---
Wait there are attachments?
---
Ha that‚Äôs me 
---
Well i'm salty and dont like it üòÇ
---
well your mom should have swallowed and yet here we are
---
If is control use the skar when u put the shield the recoil of the semi is biger.
---
such a boring repost. We get it, you had it tough. I hear this so often that i'd rather hear my grandparents complain about how hard life was when they were young.
---
Yea change Hibana from beauty to fuckin street bitch puke, but leave smoke disabled... Gj ubi!   
---
(DON'T CHANGE HIBANA PLEASE)
---
My guess is that Road to SI was a test for it, but it was too late to put it into Y4S1 without delaying it further since they weren't quite sure how the reaction from the community would be. 
---
Im someone who does the latter and its because i dont know if there is no danger. Ive been killed by a 2nd person dashing as fast as possible to me. Id rather kill then slip away. 
---
Now if there are like 3 or 4 up and i get a call that they are all elsewhere and i down one. Yeah. Im all into that interrogation!
---
Normally only jaegers eyes are completely covered, this is the only headgear where you can‚Äôt see bandits eyes, hence why I said it looks like jaeger
---
I dont know what you mean about elite controller but I recommend SCUF. I started using it last year and it gives me 4 extra buttons underneath that can be mapped to replace any button on the controller. You can also change how much of a hair trigger you have and convert your L2/R2 to long paddles or change into buttons like R1/L1.
---
Bullshit, that's clearly fuze, you can see the cluster charges
---
I want to know this as well 
---
Are we still talking about the mask at this point?
---
That's the problem lmao
---
So then wheres the big one in the middle gone?
---
Yeah.. that's ~10,000 renown I will never get back.
---
The win deltas are based of plat 1/diamonds. That's what I'd call good.
---
I think option 1 is a great idea!  Maybe hike the number up to 7 or 8? But otherwise I think that would be a great addition to the ranked game mode!
---
You thought it was an Aztec God, but it was me Dio!
---
Disagree on the UMP.  It's an amazing SMG, good damage and little to no recoil means you can reliably kill your target, as long as you can aim and hit your target.  It's only unforgiving if you don't have the greatest aim, since that slow rate of fire means if you miss your first few shots you're screwed if you can't quickly readjust to the head.  Giving it an ACOG would go too far since it would become overpowered.  That damage combined with a lack of recoil would be a spawnkiller's wet dream.
---
AWAKEN MY MASTERS
---
( r/unexpectedjojo ) 
---
I actually don't have crazy hours in the game, I got it back in August during the summer sale on steam and it was $60 for all the ops + season pass deal. I put in almost 300hrs and figured I'd just go for the season pass for the next ops again, without really considering that you're totally right, I could have bought almost half the opsbin year 4 with renown and saved the money.
---
But you're right, if you're playing a lot, there's not much benefit to the season pass. 
---
3 weeks probably
---
Probably not a finished product yet 
---
stop asking 
---
r/murderedbywords
---
Internet, research do some
---
You let your 8 year old play this game?
---
9 months of renown to buy attachments? Just win like 10 matches and you‚Äôd have enough to buy all of them
---
Nice job
---
OP, please contact mod to appeal this, this is more of a PSA rather than glitch.
---
It's a feels bad
---
Gold Blacks
---
No he just likes the icons...
---
Well than aren't you so lucky. I don't intend to pre aim each time as most of the time that shit doesn't even fucking happen. So props to you if you can but some of us ain't so lucky all the time.
---
i remember buying a new op, and having to grind a lot more just so i could use the attachments, wish they never added that..
---
10 days left..
---
as an Aussie twitch main, I am both terrified and excited for Mozzie. Help.
---
i haven't heard anything of a rework happening anytime soon? who knows, i sure hope you're right, i havent played the tts yet so i have no idea.
---
OH YEAH I remember just having enough for the op and then going in no attachments or maybe having a scope and nothing else 
---
Did you buy the base edition? The one that is $5 more made the operators the cheaper price. 
---
The base edition made all the starters 25k, I think it‚Äôs silly. 
---
The worst was when you had just enough money to buy the new ops but not enough to buy the attachments 
---
I don't even feel it's that long ago
---
God dammit I'm spending more money. I made a mistake of adding Hibana to my main rotation operators a week before they announced a new elite skin.
---
Thank you for replying.
---
Happy cake day btw
---
First time?
---
It's still red
---
Glaz‚Äôs change is great! Exactly what he needed.   
---
Glaz wasn‚Äôt op, but he was being abused imo.  The developers have a problem where they design operators, but don‚Äôt think about how they could be abused. (Examples: Lion, thermal Glaz, 2 speed blitz.)   
---
Glaz‚Äôs role is to be a support sniper, but his thermal scope was being used as an entry fragger (front-line killer) position.
---
I played all first year then stopped. When i just recently started playing i was so confused thinking i had already bought things. Lol new players got it easy
---
Bandit tricking 2.0
---
**I am still tilted there's no renown compensation.**
---
I seriously must have dropped about 100,000 renown and countless hours of play unlocking all the attachments and vanilla operators.
---
First time playing smoke, or first time on the sub?
---
There's still time. 
---
Doc must purge the cancer
---
Ah alright. It's not for me to say how you parent your children. I just thought 8 years old was a little young to be play siege.
---
pog
---
It would probably be more likely that mute never gets a face reveal.
---
You never loot until you've checked ths area for buddies. That's like rule number 1.
---
help me :C
---
Y do u even use long barrels 
---
PC or console?
---
Number 1 seems good but it has to be almost unanimous choice to ban map so 8-9 votes.
---
as a new player, i feel for you guys üòîü§ü
---
–û, –ê—Å—Ç–æ—Ä, –∑–¥–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞:)
---
Console
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure us old school players got compensated, iirc.
---
I'll run finka with an lmg, but that because, like, I run into the room putting bullets into every possible angle-watching spot...
---
One is a smonk and the other is a smoke
---
Fuze's LMG? 
---
Yeah honestly I don't get it. I find myself taking red dot over acog sometimes, even.
---
Little more. Yeah, yeah. *Sniffs**Sniffs*
---
Literally the day after I bought the last attachment I wanted for my last operator I had unlocked, they announced this change
---
sorry you're gonna have to rephrase that, I don't get what you mean at all. However, if you meant wether it affects your stats, it should not, since Ubisoft recognises this as a 3rd party interruption and should usually let you reconnect to the ranked match or search for a new game.
---
I bought all attachments (for all ops I had) and all the 20 basic ops, but I'm just upset for no renown back. Good for all attachments and 20 basic ops free but for the love of God please give me my renown back. :(
---
What?!
