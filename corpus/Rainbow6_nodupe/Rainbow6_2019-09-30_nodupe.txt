Nah bro, everyone above bronze is MnK, I would know, I only die to MnK cuz I‚Äôm too gud to die to controller players 4head.

---
Everyone who denies it is wrong, I‚Äôm always right, I‚Äôve done my 10 seconds of research on the topic, end of discussion and fuck you for cheating.
---
Did I miss anything?
---
Oh, thank you! Yeah I generally find that I can only use the holographic scopes if I want to do any good, but I prefer the Russian one greatly
---
Ikr
---
Kinda cringe
---
Yeah I think that's accurate
---
Thats true. I try to not do it as much as possible but i get it
---
Lol
---
You forgot to mention your better than 20/20 vision where you can pinpoint every point of movement on screen to deduce what is and isn't possible with a controller.
---
That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs wrong here

Nah I play her all the time, her holograms hold the same exact foot placement and gun placement as herself being idle, if you just look down you can line it up pretty easy and make it convincing *enough* but obviously not perfect, but you don‚Äôt need perfect

I don‚Äôt know if you know this, but she‚Äôs um.. **Trash**
---
The R6 console community is really an entirely different beast compared to the PC version...
---
Probably due to the ease of use/lower initial price point that brings a lot more kids and teenagers on those platforms.
---
But the thing is smoke and mute have the same shotgun machine pistol combo and are 2 speed and there are plenty of other ops that can‚Äôt have their gadgets repurposed with better guns
---
Also I would like someone to say that they‚Äôve killed 3 ops because of wardens ability
---
Badgers video is very good on explaining why he is quite possibly the worst
---
Imagine bragging as a cheater.
---
it's bugged. 38 / 10 =/= 12.67 unless it's counting overall kills instead of just seasonal like the rest of the stats, might be a smurf or something in that case.

Focking lazer sights

Tachanka is about to have a fun time
---
I play on PC, and I've never liked playing regularly with the same people. There's always a skill gap, or a raging dude, or someone not available. You have to wait for them, you have to adapt, and often, people get demotivated / angry after a few losses and kinda give up and get angry. In soloQ, if people are shitty, I'll never see them again. If they're cool, I add them for the night then delete them.
---
But yeah, I know one day I'm gonna uninstall R6 because of spawnkillers. I truly think it souldn't be possible to spawn kill in this game because after waiting for all the menuing phases to be done and driving a tiny robot camera for 30s which starts to feel really boring, the last thing I want is to die within 5 seconds and having to wait 5 minutes to drive my robot again.

Tachanka has no visor hole (I don‚Äôt know how it calls)!! üòÉ

What‚Äôs your username?

Jager: oh hey Monty I'm just chilling. Is that gridlock with you? She is looking good today anyways objective is up stairs you can go have it, I just need a beer
---
Why the fuck are you using the Russian holo
---
Yes, but you also lose less.
---
They have a different MP, which has a far worse recoil profile, imo.
---
Smoke is on the list of defenders who can work against defenders, though you'd have to suck with him to make that mistake.
---
I don't believe he's the worst or the best. I just think there is a wealth of people who tried him during PS and couldn't play him as a usual anchor  or roamer. To play him effectively, you can't plan out when and how to use his gadget. You have to play him reactively.
---
Where can I find Thai bakery ? Idc how far away this guy this. I want a Lion Oreo cream pie
---
Basically the Red Dot has the biggest FOV in the center screen but has the biggest sight casing.
---
The Reflex has the smallest FOV in the center screen and the smallest sight casing.
---
The Holo has kind of the same FOV in the center as the RD but takes up less of the sides of the screen with the casing.
---
Realistically the RD isn‚Äôt that bad it‚Äôs mainly just down to personal preference.
---
Lord Chanka is blind. Justice is blind
---
Goyo is the inadvertent fuze buff we needed
---
I thought new smg-11 had better recoil 
---
I haven‚Äôt compared tho
---
Depends. My team bans for what we know we suck against. That's usually a good monty player.
---
45 percent trolls ?

But can we talk about Vigil? He literally turned into Mr Game &amp; Watch

---
We are reaching moment of cheating epidemic in Siege that it stopped to be funny, started to be really sad and now again it's getting funny
---
I feel like they're giving roamers to the attacking team (attack Cav) but I think they should have done something with them to help the rest of the team out like n√∏kk activating hey cloak and jamming cameras as she moves by them so the team can go unseen. And as for Amaru have her gadget get in a better position instead of crashing through a window or door and or be able to drop the end of her gadget down the teammates too quick repel them up to her position. this is me just spitbolin I have no idea what they're capable of making for the game but these are just some of the things I was thinking about as I went on a 14-hour siege tear.
---
wait now that i think about it glaz is also a teamplayer think about it, planting the bomb? throw some smokes and give cover.
---
I almost spit out my ice
---
There are a lot of solo play operators, they are meant for flanking or for fragging/ holding angles. Both in offence and defence, you‚Äôve got Blackbeard, he can peak/hold aggressive angles
---
Amaru as an entry fragger/flanker 
---
Maverick to get some easy(ish) kills/force defenders off their corner 
---
And on defence youve got 
---
Vigil, alibi, cav, pulse, etc
---
All those ops can hold their own and are meant to flank, or roam on their own, alibi can be played either way tbh
---
Is it really new? I remember my buddy used it (or somethign similar) on open quals for some tournament mid-2018
---
Maybe it‚Äôs cause the 308 fucking sucks and has ass rate of fire
---
Must we continue posting these things every hour? Lost count of how many posts I've seen just today pointing out this glitch.
---
Give us your resume if you wanna join us!
---
Yeah kinda, I feel like amaru is so useless, I hate having one on my team cause once she grapples into the building, that‚Äôs all she‚Äôs good for
---
You know how grenades or other explosives are really fucked up in siege? Have you seen the clips where impacts wont detonate and will just roll and nitro cells wont explode upon ‚Äòdetonating‚Äô but will explode by random chance when walking to pick them back up. I assume someone walked past it earlier triggering it to explode but didnt and it just so happens that the code got nae nae‚Äôd and it blew up at the same time OP did :/
---
T E N T A C L E H E N T A I
---
Lol I always think she should‚Äôve gotten the MP5SD like echo has, if they were trying to give her a recycled gun
---
Trust nobody, not even yourself
---
Didn‚Äôt notice that.Good catch
---
Why would you want spawn peekers punished.  They are trying to kill the other team, it's the objective of the game.  There was never a 5 second time out.
---
I know when I made this is was dead from slept depravity and just went with what sounded right at the time

Congrats, you wrap plastic wrap over your face, it‚Äôs a common known meme, he‚Äôs still good if your reflexes aren‚Äôt molasses. But it‚Äôs meh
---
I think the Blackbeard you imagine would be grossly overpowered
---
Good.  You shouldn't get points for that.
---
I don't play this game, can someone explained wtf I just watched?
---
Shoulda been here when he first came out. That fucker posted up on a window you better not have looked at it.
---
It's been 4 YEARS

I don‚Äôt wanna be that guy, but the correct sentence is ‚ÄúIs Nokk‚Äù not ‚Äúare Nokk‚Äù, Nokk is singular, not plural, use is for a single person, use are for a group

More interested in the fact that 7/10 players in that match have RFF activated...

Exactly I see at least 20 of these everyday like okay we get it
---
Bruh
---
Push down bitch
---
Yeah, I had just joined the previous round and saw that, I figured if I didn't get vtk, they couldn't kill me lol
---
F
---
Btw if an alibi ever does this just wait 10 seconds the prismas won't show up as detected and you'll know which is real
---
I get 109
---
That‚Äôs entirety of why aim is more important on console. Any half decent pc player can reliably hit all their shots whereas being able to be precise and accurate with your shots on console can easily allow you to win almost every encounter
---
Who tf asked you?
---
The amount of alibis that do this but still wear there crazy heads and use glowing gun skins hurts me
---
But why aren't they being detected for being outside?
---
Just a tip, running iron sites and no grip makes it miles more convincing and you can catch many more players with it = more fun
---
Maybe as a limited time event, but not as a full on playlist.
---
it's a hive-mind mentality. they don't feel like they can do that with their controller aim so they put down people who can. it sucks but it's how it is
---
I feel that
---
He showed up in the comment thing at the bottom. I was trying to get the scoreboard but my touch screen is shit and couldn‚Äôt get it haha
---
He didn't even try turning it off and turning it on again.
---
Plat 3 has always been the extra gold tier. I'd say plat 2 is a high rank because you've actually pushed through and not just scraped plat3 and went back to casual.
---
No lmao I don‚Äôt DDOS, somebody from Pumpkin posted it on the main RB6 FB group.
---
Personally, I use it quite a bit too. Imo it's good in ranked, but only on certain sites. It's great on 2nd floor of Oregon and consulate, for armoury/master bedroom hold and admin on consulate.
---
Thanks for the windows Amaru! They are my primary entrance points .
---
oh schei√üen das ist tief
---
I say ‚ÄúIs it too much to ask for both?‚Äù
---
What if the Lord's middle shield is 800hp (for example) and his side shields are 50hp (another example). That way he can negate the peakers advantage (if he knows where the opponent is coming from) while still being able to lock down a hallway or room, making him playable and not just a meme. 
---
Now I know what you're thinking. He might be too OP. 
---
Well, not really. His counters are still there (grenades, ashes breaching round etc). If it's a 2 v 1 situation he can also hold his own with a bit of help of course (Jaeger's ADS, deployable shields etc.) That way it adds even more teamwork to the game. 
---
Don't know about you guys but I really want to play as the Lord in ranked but it just puts you in a bad situation every time. 
---
Just a thought. 
---
Thanks y'all.
---
Would you like to close the program or wait for it to respond?
---
Get fucked! Lol!
---
I thought you were going to get ran out and shot from the door behind you, but this is nice

Sounds like somebody is salty that they get spawnpeeked

Sounds like all the problems are yours; Good luck with your English, mate.
---
Well It is heretical to not play the lord in ranked.
---
Nice
---
Same, unless there's no bandit/kaid/mute. If thermite can do his thing without me then I'll throw EMPs into rooms where there might be traps. Better to throw EMPs at potentially nothing than die with all 3 left.
---
Don't trust yourself. even your traps.
---
This. Maybe something like the april fool's.
---
I agree with you 100% Its an easy kill for both sides if you can just take the 1 or 2 seconds to make sure you arent gonna get shot
---
no, plat 3 since last season seems so easy to get, but hey that's my own opinion because I thought I was a plat player myself, but I kept solo/duo'ing last season and I would say 80%+ don't deserve their plat at all
---
Best time I ever had
---
Nobody cared who I was until I put on the mask
---
Doubt
---
literally any decent players with decent aim and knowledge can easily get plat
---
Good news is Ubi is working very hard on new weapon skins
---
I have amazing aim
---
Good gun for such
---
No, he did... he does that.

He‚Äôs good, but you‚Äôve obviously never seen pros. They‚Äôve pretty much masted recoil

PC Mouse and Keyboard has no recoil

Chill bud it‚Äôs a joke lol
---
i watch pro league here and there, and king george almost every day in twitch, and even he doesn‚Äôt have as good of recoil control
---
Only if the laser in between chest and torso area.
---
Or something that triggers all traps in a huge radius, if unobstructed by walls, like a grenade, but it can take out goyo's, mats, kapkans, lesions, etc.
---
no also if it's to bottom one, just lay down and go
---
My disappointment is immesurable and my day is ruined.

Ah fuck
---
It would be if she didn't have like 5 hp

Best thing about youtube is that you can edit the video to only have the best parts. 
---
If you check his twitch streams it will just show you that he is just an above avg player. 
---
Go check out a real ProL player, that will show you aim/recoil control that almost all players will call hacks on.

It‚Äôs just a bug rn

No, it‚Äôs resin and even though it‚Äôs obvious he is trapped, the picture is a commentary on the fact we have all been trapped in the same location of our life because of siege, and the only things that change year in and year out is the season of siege and our shorts.

I lost 2 braincells just by watching this

why does it feels like everyone was missing shots on purpose
---
Why waste breach charges when you can waste precious seconds?
---
Yes, i think that was it but should you play at all if you get triggered from that :D
---
If the only ops they have are already picked by their teammates it will auto give them recruit
---
Actually not xD
---
I just tbagged him, is that so bad :D
---
Not all lol he must be 12 mentally and/or physically
---
git gud
---
Note that Matimi0 only plays a hand full of ops, which is much easier to master than all of the available ones.
---
Who throws a grenade?! Honestly!
---
It was an advice. Calm down Bighead lmfao
---
Better than amaru atleast
---
Nice :)
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a live one! And he seems worried.
---
To be fair that's one of the main points of playing ops like doc
---
That's awesome lol thank u
---
About damn time.
---
Lmao funny I don't even know what this is

bet her puss is pretty tight too üòâ

Yes that is exactly how this works, nothing wrong witht that.

I downloaded siege again few weeks back and it was 90+ gigs for me.
---
Except the mp7 and 556, the rest should be fine.
---
Mozzie is a great operator because he's so versatile, there have been posts where I've commented basically an essay on why he's so useful and it's not only because he can control drones 
---
In my opinion he's great because:
---
-He has solid weapons 
---
-He has access to a secondary shotgun for rotation holes 
---
-He has nitro cell 
---
-He's good at DRONE DENIAL , in fact he's better than mute if you only deploy your pests after the prep phase and the enemies want to drone out towards the end of the round because not only are you denying them Intel, you can then use their gadget against them 
---
Mozzie shouldn't be prepping drones before the round starts because he won't have enough time to reinforce or make any rotate holes, just because you don't catch any drones it doesn't mean you didn't get any use out of mozzie, he's amazing if you use him as a drone denial op instead of an Intel gathering op, there are alternatives like valkyrie, echo, maestro or even someone like lesion and Mira if you need to know where enemies are
---
My big brain is pleased with your tribute.
---
its because you piece of shit play kapkan.
---
ikr got this as well
---
HAIL HYDRA!
---
It‚Äôs very different on the other side of the table
---
I was going to suggest adjusting the dropoff curve for the guns listed so that they aren't deathstar lasers, but that's just my opinion, and mostly suggested for guns that are used on defenders who need to contest with ACOG users without the "gib ACOG" spiel.
---
Yes
---
They nerfed him because he was the best entry fragger in the game
---
Always double-check before going in
---
I wholeheartedly approve of this ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ
---
You magnificent bastard.
---
I am pretty sure it was the drone glitch
---
is anybody really playing amaru
---
Yep, 100%
---
I guess so... wait a minute

Making her be able to have her ability up when she is running and doing something? (this will make the 3 speed idea make a lot more sense as she cannot run now without voiding her ability)

Clearly a horrible glitch but I was thinking it could be from a nomad gadget triggering you into the EDD. Sounds kinda unlikely but from the recent season Nomad's trap can trigger Goyo's Vulcan shield if an operator sets her trap off towards it. From the footage we can't prove or disprove it as 4 ops are unknown (1 is thermite at least), and your low health deafened your character so the hum of the trap may not be so obvious. Its possible this glitch resulted from the addition of the new ops, maybe they readjusted nomad with this addition to balance them and messed something up
---
Also I'll definitely buy this if it's universal.
---
yeah
---
At least common  I'd say

Typical low plat. Lol this is embarrassing.

Nice kills, well done.

Ummm no.

All she has to do is look in the mirror though, she is Ela
---
&gt;How did you do that. I have been trying to do that exact same thing but cant figure it out
---
 It must first switch from Steam Big Picture mode to Steam Beta client. After that, you can get a suitable apng file and create a library that moves on it.
---
Try to snag some pics from the internet, redraw them with slight changes and make your own plot. That's how i made a Titanfall 2 comic. It was a little bit cringe though, but the readers said it was pretty interesting.
---
To Be Honest IDK I Think It Looks Good :D

That's kind of like masterbating in a mirror. That's kind of weird.

Exactly. Part of the challenge of the game is learning how to communicate and coordinate with your team. I get wanting a little hand holding in the beginning, but I think it's more useful to learn where these areas are so you can a) utilize them yourself, and 2) be able to call out when someone else uses them. It makes you a better player in the long run.
---
EDIT: also, I wanna see this spot on coastline you're talking about
---
You are browsing r6 reddit, and you never heard about ddosing, seems legit.
---
Ok
---
869.8MB for me, downloaded almost immediately and I have barely any storage space left to begin with. 
---
Sounds a bit odd that it‚Äôs requiring 8gb, maybe restart and see if it changes.
---
Exactly, You still have today left on the free trial.
---
TO THE SKIES
---
you're acting like it's a mechanic while ubi is actively trying to prevent people from doing it. also, how would you counter a spawnpeaker that knows your exact location and has peaker's advantage? there is no proper counter. it's a dick move and it takes no skill to peak out of a window. it's also not impressive at all as everyone will just go "oh another spawnpeaker. yee fucking haw"
---
For t hunt if you turn off v-sync then you can get 70 fps
---
U missed every shot
---
Theres a difference between being ironic and being stupid. And the former always use the same tired excuse.
---
I thought the exact same
---
But Warden is #1 dad
---
You have a casual view on everything. Siege rise and falls with the pro league and the competitive aspect. If the game is to casual pro league will become redundant because no one views high competitive players in a non competitive environment. Siege would be like Minecraft pro league. To go for reworks and old guns guarantees the balancing fact besides the fact that some maps have major issues like the light system on Theme Park or the massiv spawnpeaks on the old kanal. Csgo has around 30 weapons I think, siege has nearly 100. Why using new guns when there are a ton of guns like IQs MG or Jackals PDW or Ashes G36c which aren‚Äôt used by the majority of the player base anyways heck they could also bring out bucks gun with grips. What I was trying to explain is: From a competitive point of view is Ubisoft on a good way atm
---
Thanks
---
I started out with really low sensitivity originally, and then I switched to about 43 or so and my gameplay improved drastically. You really only need to have your horizontal sensitivity up to flick on people. If you‚Äôre turning at 0.05 miles per hour (or kilometers for any non-American folk) then you will 100% be killed by someone to your right that shot first. By the time you bring your gun around to fire, you‚Äôll already be dead. Your sensitivity doesn‚Äôt need to be super high, just at a level you feel you can comfortably compete at. Slowly work your way up to higher sensitivity, that‚Äôs what I recommend
---
Update is 869.8 mb for me and is download fine
---
Exactly
---
Patch Notes?
---
Playing t hunt smoothly would be WONDERFUL.  30 is so choppy.
---
Alright look i‚Äôll take one for the team, what manga is she holding or whatever you call it because i‚Äôm curious
---
Its not this guys fault though as well as its not Ubisofts fault. OP is not legally required to follow Ubisoft on twitter, hell he isnt even required to in the the EULA. It kinda could be pinned as Ubisofts fault though because they could have sent a notice via the game.
---
If youre not unique then you are unique because everybody else is also unique.
---
If you're going for a flank and you're in the middle of a hallway and a lion scan goes off you're basically a dead man 
---
If you suggest just standing still is a counter to lion, especially when he launched you don't understand how powerful he is, go watch anyone who's competive at this game or even a little bit decent when lion launched, pro players have called lion an overwatch character because all he does is push a button and the entire match is influenced, 0 skill is required, Fabian (a pro player) said in an interview when lion launched it doesn't matter what his team does, they pick lion and run in and kill the enemy team 
---
There is a new rainbow six game coming out next year which may appeal to you more because it's a PvE, they might include more modes like outbreak.  It's clear they are focusing on PVP because that's where most players are and their new game might be for players who enjoy T hunt but want something with more depth
---
He does appear to be ankle deep in water, or maybe some dense gas

Also, you might wanna stop Malding so hard since the floor is getting hard to clean
---
Couldn‚Äôt control yourself.
---
Well they rework maps so that they are balanced for ranked, rather than throwing them into the casual only pit and just making new maps.
---
Not if u turn v sync of in t hunt u get 50/60 FPS
---
Mozzie is balanced as his pickrate and winrate are average
---
Gridlock i would say abit OP since she has smokes, roamer denial. A post-plant situation is really difficult to retake as a defender with gridlock
---
Nokk is niche that you really need to have a specific strategy and a "one time" pick to surprise the enemy
---
Warden is also situational that he can be considered viable on bank
---
With Amaru you're not supposed to just yeet into the building and getting shot in the face by attackers
---
It's meant to go up hatches or specific places after knowing that no one is there, or using it after a post-plant situation
---
Goyo changes the pacing of the round drastically
---
Uhhhhh, you lost me at if
---
Nowhere bro.

U're giving the opportunity to take advices from a guy who has been diamond for 10 seasons, who scrims PENTA / BDS and other T1 teams on a weekly basis.

Mozzie, Gridlock, and Goyo are good, but the rest are even bad, or underwhelming.

Started when the pro scene was on console still. Irrelevant now as I see no pro scene coming to console play.

A couple of days ago that almost happened to me, it was a 2v4 Overtime Match Point round, got 3/4 and while I was defusing got tkd, and my teammate got down to about 5 health from RFF, we won tho
---
But I don‚Äôt understand why is ubisoft is aiming the game toward competitive and serious instead of focusing on the rest of the player base which is the 50 something million people? I know they get money from the pro league and that‚Äôs most likely the case.
---
I'm going to use this thread to learn the characters' backstories by the people that would date them

Probably

I know right, I know a few people that have smurfs, they use them for training and playing with lower MMR rates friends. I can see why people do it thankfully I far to average to merd one ha!
---
The audio in siege works in a specific way. You don't hear people through walls, you hear them through doorways/holes for the audio to travel. Are you sure the audio is actually fucked for you, or have you watched a video about how sound travels in siege? It's pretty important to understand.
---
bruh why did greta thunberg decide to cosplay iq
---
I think it's more common, I used to struggle in gold previous seasons and now I got easily plat 3
---
Good in the right hands, her ability is good if you master how to use it greatly for roaming. Her weapons are meh but definitely will get you kills if you train with them. She‚Äôs not much of a support type player unless you count hunting down roamers as support.
---
Best Bf: 
---
Maestro because he seems like a man my nonno would‚Äôve liked me to be with lmao. But in all honesty, In his psych report, he sounds like a very good and kind hearted individual who cared about his siblings and I like that.
---
Monty because he sounds like someone who is very patient and actively tries to get better by adding newer techniques and working with his peers. Also his dialogue lines within the game. They sound so comforting and just overall feel wholesome. Gets me moist everytime ;^)
---
Worst bf: 
---
Capitao but that‚Äôs most likely because it would seem to be nerve wracking being around him. I mean he‚Äôs got a cool eyepatch but as a personal, overall, he‚Äôll just remind me of my uncle and that‚Äôs wack-
---
Best gf:
---
My baby girl Frost because I love her. I don‚Äôt need no reason. I am in love with her. 
---
Gridlock because she‚Äôs fine as fuck. Forget the thickness for a second but she is naturally like a leader and it really seems like there could be some great chemistry regardless of who you are if you‚Äôre with her. She also has a bit of a humorous side to her especially in tough situations and I‚Äôm a sucker for someone like that. 
---
Worst gf:
---
Iq because in her psychological profile, she‚Äôs quite an over achiever and this in turn makes her a bit obsessive and I‚Äôd probably feel overwhelmed with someone like that
---
it didnt just happen this is gameplay from pre op chimera
---
The mods are too.

---
Damn hes trans now
---
Yeah custom game server change for console user has been fixed, never an intended feature in the 1st place
---
You are a saint. Thank you.
---
I played with my low friends on EU at the start of the season thinking it wouldn‚Äôt impact my USA grind because it would just use the MMR of the server you were trying to play

Although they brought in unmarked for this

Also I'm on xbox

I prefer it as a better warm up than casual

J√§ger is getting one next season
---
The main reason I don't like your first idea is that being able to replenish nitro cells and impacts seems like it could cause a lot of balancing issues. With your idea, two nitro ops can throw 6 nitros total (1 to start, 1 for each ammo drop). This would make shields borderline useless (or at least less helpful).
---
Yeah it can be annoying but...  he has to hit you right? U get killed in a specific spawn peek like 2-3 times. After that u should definately realize, that u need to watch out for it, counter it or choose another spawn location. I understand why you hate it, but you dont seem to understand whats the reason why I dont like this clip.

Thanks alot! Yeah I couldnt get over the recoil when I first started playing although its pretty easy to work around. The many different maps threw me off abit though, so many angles and peep holes but that will all come with time I suppose.. appreciate the kind comment
---
I own a home and have my own internet, so nice try on that one! But even if my internet sucked, I wouldn‚Äôt blame ubisoft. Now go fail miserably trying to back someone up elsewhere.

It's usually the higher levels that are the saltiest. I for one love getting hate mail. It proves I'm much better than them. Lol

If your not M&amp;kb how did you jump from gold 4 so plat 3 with one season in between then to diamond the next? The only people who do that are people who go M&amp;kb
---
Ddos
---
Dokki and Echo. They have similar hobbies and have a past together
---
The r6 Twitter said there's no new player facing changes, so they probably just sorted or compressed file or tweaked some minor things nothing that'll effect us
---
Indeed, however family stuff on Ela‚Äôs side might be a little chaotic with Zofia and Ela hating each other. IQ I could see like that. 
---
You are right about Cav and Ash tho, Cav is crazy and Ash rushes into things head first.
---
Nah, usually defending first wins like 3-5, and yes, K posted this 2 days ago but it got taken down :/
---
This is a trick. We all know rainbow six players don‚Äôt have girlfriends

It worked because the enemy team only had 3 members.

If I buy it now would it get the ones for Mozzie and Gridlock too?
---
Thanks! I didn't know if they announced anything more that's all
---
Are you retarded? It‚Äôs called practice dumbass. Over 400+ hours in game. Also i have 2 alt accounts that have hit plat numerous times before i hit diamond. The only people who assume and stalk profiles and still get shit wrong are imbeciles. Try again bud
---
I like shadow play
---
no ela, hentai isnt art

Ela. I'm polish, shes polish. That's really it.

The whole point of freesync is to eliminate tearing and stuttering because the monitors refresh rate changes to match what the GPU is outputting. So if you have a freesync compatible graphics card (AMD) or the monitor is "G-Sync Compatible" for NVidia cards then you won't notice and laggy stutters or tearing.
---
The more it hurts when they blow up under you\*

The Ela you doing?

Correction from gold 3 to diamond from one season to the next

It's an MCM one right, the one in Scotland over the weekend?

I've seen them
---
That‚Äôs some solid choices right there, honestly didn‚Äôt expect doc to be a bad BF but I could totally see it. Nonetheless N√∏kk is a mystery and by theory a princess so getting a boyfriend and all that stuff would probably get Nato and her father involved making any date a headache for both parties. Which sucks but her dad just couldn‚Äôt keep his dick in his pants.
---
Maestro is a nice fella, he gots that nice smile but the smoking is a bad habit so maybe that could be the only bad reason since not a lot of people smoke nowadays.. finka would be nice and someone else said that adrenaline surge would come in handy ;D.

 you got me... cant keep up with this charade. this was just a random guy that wanted to bully me  and i added the female voice just to look like it was in game and my "girlfriend" :( im sad and lonely
---
So you can got from gold 3 in burnt horizon to diamond in phantom sight from just practice alone?
---
Which doesn‚Äôt make sense beacause it‚Äôs only aresenic a standard gas mask should be able to filter it oit

Did you not just see me say i have alt accounts that have hit plat multiple times?? You really are sum special huh, also i had no friends back when i was trying to return to siege and my friends bought siege and we all started playing. You bronze 2 I‚Äôm guessing?
---
Asides that you always know he‚Äôs around the corner 
---
And is a easy kill
---
Have it but it don't go with it
---
You did not. Wow. Pro League is not comparable to rank/ regular play. no one was talking about so here I will change my view. lion is only good if you have a time of 4 other people who have robotic aim and God-like game sense and map knowledge.
---
Your makeup is damn good
---
Need that
---
The point of siege is that every encounter is going to be different. Every map played different. The way I see is that there isn't necessarily a bad map. Jsut many different ways to play that I might not be the best at. So I don't see why people complain so much about maps not being easy to attack/defend
---
You lost your little red chair :(
---
And a Rolex
---
Yeah ik rip

I know, but for me it looks a bit like a version of an AK and everybody I know calls it like that :c

Ela is one of the weakest ops in game and definitely the worst for your team on defense. So I'd recommend someone else.

I am not sure what you mean.

I have both Ghost Recon: Future Soldier and Rainbow Six Siege at the same account.

what

I think 3 would be fair. Considering attackers can get 3 breaching charges + however many explosives would be fair
---
i‚Äôve got all the defense ops now. this was from a while ago. but i do partially agree with you

absolutley yes.

I love how many people I see that are saying "I wish we didn't have to have both the headgear and uniform equipped in order to have the elite animation" and then this post appears, and every single person is just like 'no"

Man I miss the OG rainbow six games. I remember being like 5 and 6 planning out the missions playing as Weber deter snipping people. They seriously need to remake the OG and urban operations. Can you imagine planning out your mission with a 3D map like in doom? That would be so fucking sweet
---
If really is! And from a tactical viewpoint he‚Äôs rarely ever NOT useful. You can beeline towards the OBJ sometimes quicker than even Ash can (depending on the map and OBJ location) simply because you can just go through the walls!
---
And yeah... there‚Äôs really no beating a nice clean sledgehammer kill.

You hold power in your name. With 9 digits,  we can break it up into 6 digit sequences and browse your wares.

Russian holo?
---
Why would you even do that ?
---
People like you are the bad thing about the game.
---
just quit and play Minecraft

God you guys are nerds

Unlucky
---
I just want more ops w the commando tbh
---
Bandit dealt (don't know if I got it right, feel free to correct me) drugs, he didn't do them. But Lion did when he got kicked out of the house if I remember correctly
---
i think it's one of the best defensive weapons
---
What's wrong with Goyos shield?
---
That‚Äôs not what she said.
---
‚ÄúShe‚Äù being Cav
---
Can you access the tracker on console or is a PC thing?
---
I do but new maps are still more interesting (to me at least)
---
Hi everyone! Go get a life and stop fantasizing about fictional characters!
---
Wait echo is great and I pick him pretty often, he's pretty impactful at high elo. It's not super hard to just pick IQ lol.
---
Small correction: the skin has been in the game for 2 (or more?) years.
---
The LAN build of the game has access to all content in the game, including unreleased weapon skins. They haven't actually been given to any accounts prior to the full release.
---
N√∏kk should have had Jaegers assault rifle
---
His name will be bricklayer.
---
So if you understand what I‚Äôm saying, then you know what the problem is.
---
Needs some moustache
---
He did it, that crazy son of a bitch, he did it
---
Yeah you have no clue
---
How about this is actually a great idea and would put glaz back in the meta
---
It's called Brother-Sister
---
When you vote to kick yourself 5/4 votes
---
That's literally tachanka with his army of kids. Read his bio.
---
Wow you are right. His high ban rate in Ranked across the spectrum and as well as Pro League is all because everyone forgot they could just pick IQ. I think you might have singlehandedly solved the Echo problem. 
---
Once you spread this revelation to the masses, his ban rate will plummet immediately.
---
Wait? Doesn‚Äôt it do 30 damage and not 23?
---
Yeah ik I haven‚Äôt played caviera in so long (months) and the thought of interrogating completely slipped my mind lol
---
the fuckin' dead look says it all. she doesn't want to fuckin do this but she has to
---
Super *Sonico, fam.
---
Idk I dont think hes all that hard to deal with most people just ban him out of comfort instead of strategy
---
Tuff
---
The blitz at least I should have interrogated, but, I hadn‚Äôt played in months so I didn‚Äôt even think of it till the round was over lol
---
Buy a fake mustache too!
---
The mission planning was awesome. My first campaign I lost all the good characters and I could never beat the stealth missions.
---
Just name him fortress 2: electric bogaloo, problem solved
---
Yeah I forgot lol. But I swear those elevators are the best spots to get kills from, ground floor or upper floor.
---
Finka, lion, maestro and clash of you communicate a lot and gridlock and kaid if you play solo
---
My strategy is to ban Echo.
---
Well would ya look at that
---
And we got the ugly version of it which looks like plastic crap
---
"Shit" yeah right its great
---
If you pay attention to the character lore, you actually find out that Dokkaebi was an annoying call girl to Echo. Just a quick little bit of info for ya
---
Absolute morons
---
Literally did it while I was fookin sleepy mate
---
If this was real it should also work on hatches
---
Looks nice tbh
---
Its fooking great
---
Ay thanks mate. Big fuckin hole coming right up
---
L to those who left early cause they thought you were gonna choke it
---
why did u throw one there anyway lol
---
Thanks XD
---
I run console
---
Sound good, thanks! Nice to see that CL is getting some love. You'll be casting this season as well, right?
---
Harder!
---
Better then anything I can draw lmao
---
That sounds horrible
---
Why is this a post?
---
He has a raging boner
---
Good , just get some square glasses , remove lensess if it no good for you and you good !
---
Hit the report button, that should get rid of them rather quickly. Thanks!
---
Bruh üòÇ
---
Lookin pretty good. Just need that sexy ass moustache
---
Steam is launched and app is set up. I can access my steam library on the app, but when I click play it loads and then goes back to that same menu. I can't get the game to launch normally either. I've tried with two different computers.
---
NOICE even i get triggered
---
You have to launch it on the computer first of all, then you can connect and play.
---
Thanks!
---
how do i watch the liquid game? i click the link to the rainbow6BR and it isn't live streaming

Hello p0k3r_f4c3, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dbi8lv/ya_boy_is_almost_gold_1_for_the_first_time_ever/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:
---
###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.
---
I can't launch it on the computer tho.
---
Not twitch. Fuck that self centered asshole.
---
And there's the problem, check files integrity, fix what's wrong, try again.
---
If you fly into an objective window, you‚Äôll be shot before you reach it, the intention is to enter the building quickly and surprise them no?
---
With that logic, it‚Äôs better to enter a floor or two above to engage, don‚Äôt you think?
---
Bucket would be the best. Could use it like sledge hammer lol
---
It's not about the realism, it's about the balance.

I NEEEEEEEEEEED IT

LATAM will be playing on Wednesday. [Click here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Pro+League+Season+10+--+Latin+America+--+Game+4&amp;iso=20191002T1745&amp;p1=213&amp;ah=1&amp;am=15) to find out when the Liquid match will go live.
---
Well it's happening on two different computers. Would it still be the file?
---
The mp5 does less damage then fmg and you dont really need an acog on attack
---
Crouch  in front my drone
---
In my opinion she has the best shotgun
---
Literally everyone noticed, TheRussianBadger even made fun of it in his Operation Burnt Horizon preview video.
---
Accursed
---
Just fuckin yeet it at the fuckin wall
---
thanks!
---
It‚Äôs a meme. Look closer at every part of the loadout
---
Yeh lmao, you should‚Äôve said hi :D
---
Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it is, nor excuse it. They deserve to be fined in addition to perma banned.
---
When was it in?? 
---
I have been playing for a year and a half and didn't know I could do that
---
I know its a meme
---
Yes, I am!
---
Why would you then argue about the balance
---
HE‚ÄôS INSANE!!! HE HITS THOSE!!!! OH MY FUCK DID YOU CLIP IT?? THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY MENTAL, HE‚ÄôS THE GOD OF RAINBOW!!

#Ever heard of FINKA
---
The little bit where your shirt and tie poke out could maybe be covered but if that‚Äôs how warden is then don‚Äôt worry, looks great man!
---
YES
---
Yeah but sometimes they have a good reason. Certain ops on certain maps. It‚Äôs not always just because they don‚Äôt like them personally.
---
It was limited time only
---
I like it, but he actually wears a JPC.
---
How fast would an Ethiopian Jewish operator be?
---
Prefire everything
---
that was some good ol' braveheart dual wield hammer time bone cracking face smashing shit right there :D
---
That spin makes it even funnier
---
ayeee ya pussyyy
---
I kinda want this character now. He would be such a meme
---
I never argued i just said the mp5 is not better than the fmg
---
Eh. Tk's all the time but usually only one or two people leave the game
---
Finka is defintely best GF. Shes smart, has a nice body and she could definitely outlast you in bed with a little boost here and there if you know what i mean. Shes also best because i love women who can bore me with knowledge. Worst gf, idk.
---
Nice one
---
" **cocks meatball sub with malicious intent** "
---
But you were attempting to make a statement about the balance, which wasn‚Äôt the point of my comment, nor the original post
---
What about an Operator that uses essentially expanding foam to fill the drone holes so the drones can't see through or get through. Would be difficult to get through the garage door on chalet though with a bandit and a drone hole blocker
---
Jesus christ

Capitai

K and i wasnt shitting on the post i never said it was bad in any way
---
As a Zofia main, I 100% agree with this! She needs an Elite skin (just hope it doesn't look terrible like recent ones)
---
G I M M E
---
Who is the character I never saw him in game
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, you legally can‚Äôt. Not only would it be bad form to have a terrorist centered fight inside the UN, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you can‚Äôt have accurate blueprints for high level government buildings like that available for the public. Please feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a security thing
---
Yea pretty much she‚Äôs my siege waifu
---
Its basically an ak
---
I don‚Äôt want another fortress.
---
I just tried it out, and it works! I just assumed that it doesn't as most other gadgets don't
---
There were two or 3 posts that I saw late last week.  Mostly suggesting that they were innocent, the game population is going to dry up because of the innocent bans.  All this posted from a relatively new accounts, and then a buddy comes in to vouch for the banned user saying he plays with him all the time and never did DDOS.  It certainly was much more quiet than previous bans, and I haven't seen any clips of the ban wave happening during live games.
---
WALLS
---
Its an ak
---
I think you‚Äôre thinking of octane
---
I got on mic when I was watching my team run around and they still didn‚Äôt get the diffuse
---
RNG RNG RNG RNG!!!!
---
Yeah
---
I could say the same to you
---
How do you know he/she is fake?
---
You could have a building similar to it with a different layout and different name. But you can not explicitly use the UN building as a map
---
Looks pretty cool but could work on the gun and shoes
---
She must work out quite often.
---
It's what he looked like in the Outbreak cutscenes.
---
Your aim üëåüèªüíØü§°
---
Tunnel Vision is a thing. In City of Heroes we call it "Scrapper Lock" when the melee guy just runs from group to group not paying attention to what's going on with his team.
---
They are both hard breachers and even Hibana mentions Thermite in one of her lines. I think that's why
---
"As my friend would say *"Time to make a new door"*"
---
Absolutely would‚Äôve, but I think we went on different days, as I‚Äôd surely have noticed your (damn goood) cosplay.  I went as Jotaro myself on saturday, I‚Äôm assuming you went on sunday then?
---
At least his vest self-identifies him as a piece of shit. He‚Äôs up front about being useless which is respectable

bruh

If you see an update coming, just keep your PS4 on rest.  It‚Äôll boot up when the update finishes.

Hello vann_the_mann, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dbipet/suggestions_for_an_ela_class/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Bandit has some drugs on his side for sure.
---
And Clash is because "YOU FUCKING MUPPETS" would be annoying everytime you see her ,aye?
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking. Seems a massive security risk to have a basic blueprint of one of the most important buildings in the world available to anyone with a copy of Siege
---
Thats just how it works, no matter that game tbh
---
They would probably also have to redesign how some of these gadgets are deployed and some of their mechanics would need to be changed. For example, if you did TDM with random respawns. Nobody is going to play operators like Mira and Twitch since you have a good chance that you will be killed while trying to make use of your gadgets
---
Damn that shit was toxic!!!
---
Ayy bruv ur a bit late to the party
---
Yeh I did :( are you going to dcc?
---
Listen. Is smoking bad if the cigar has meatballs or spaghetti inside of them?
---
Thanks homie, appreciate itüëç
---
Thats alright, it be hard to play cause I literally have no HUD.
---
Ignore my laugh lol
---
Makes me wonder who in Ubi thinks we need a fourth hard breacher when all three do their jobs, one more than the other two.
---
actually didn‚Äôt mean to do this good was just joking about being a clash main
---
Wish I had that luck
---
Sweet. But the auto mod comment suggestions are probably your best bet
---
I would call it an accident but why is he so fucking bad at killing drones
---
How do you destroy a drone like that tho? Do u go above it and shoot from above so you don‚Äôt hit the red fire exploding thing or how?
---
Actually quantum mechanics forbids this.
---
Yay 100 comments
---
The best headset I have owned is the razer kraken pro v2's. Amazing for games like siege, although not 7.1
---
that's bullshit at it's finest
---
If one single person tells me their reasoning for asking for votes instead of just demanding that the team votes the way they tell them to, then I'll change my tune.
---
Intentional team kill
---
On large maps like Tower, I can see that working. On confined maps like House and Plane, sounds like a absolute clusterfuck
---
but you get an in-game message saying ''planned maintenance in (amount) minutes.'' It is very much this guy's fault for joining a ranked match before maintenance.
---
Just ventured the comments to find you :)
---
Yea, I discovered today what my greatest want lol
---
Cav for defender and Amaru for attacker.
---
yeah no. too op
---
Why? My Ears Are Bleeding Now.
---
Lmao 700+ hours and this is my one and only *lucky moment*
---
Sneak
---
Obligatory +1 for proper trigger discipline
---
yeah i know......but it¬¥ll mostly be that outbreak theme....but what i¬¥d like to see is doing stuff like article 5 but with almost playerlike AI.....but still without it being like COD
---
Its part of a set
---
Either tap out or just enjoy her domination
---
Gotta love casual
---
Are you bandit mains ok?
---
Really any specific building can land you in some hot water. A kid once designed his school as a CSGO map (I think, don't quote me). And he faced some pretty hefty charges for it.
---
WHY ARE YOU NOT USING THE DEAG
---
Oh shit I remember hearing about that, I think you‚Äôre dead on, it was CSGO, and IIRC the FBI came and sat him down for a chat.
---
Man looking like that girls will flash you to bad you won‚Äôt see it
---
COURT
---
You aren't alone, but I generally think that Ubisoft just makes bad skins - there are only a few that are actually awesome
---
Anytime
---
Mine was like 1.3 GB
---
I don‚Äôt believe you can change the sensitivity per sight
---
I think that type of customization is usually only available in a battlefield game, unfortunately. I remember seeing those settings in the options for BF4 XD
---
Bf- jager
---
Gf-twitch
---
I agree shouldn‚Äôt have been nerfed, even before I remember getting tons of kills blind firing into smokes. Now he has to stand still in the smoke? At least give him some more smokes or something for that nerf.
---
Are there privacy settings in game, on steam, or on your computer to adjust maybe? Also check your volume settings because you may have it turned down.
---
The ol' switcheroo
---
Yeah, the kid on our team would quick pick zof before I could grab her even though I was clearly carrying, so I did what I could with ash
---
It was yesterday.
---
Let‚Äôs be real. Pre fire wouldn‚Äôt have worked here. 
---
1- if he‚Äôs pre firing, clash probably just stays put 
---
2- there‚Äôs no way for twitch the gauge when clash is going to move. No way to know when to start pre firing to time clashes move right. 
---
Siege gonna siege
---
Ok I‚Äôm sorry but you shouldn‚Äôt have won that, that was horrible aim
---
It was their lack of droning and accuracy that lost the rounds, watching the bottom two play hurt
---
Basically an evolved Castle
---
Iq can with two of the more played defense vigil and pulse plus she is a 3 speed with the only good lmg in the game jackal has ten times less utility sure in a good team that talks to each other but most of the time a jackal waste pings plus iq can do it forever without pings from about 20-30 meters away which you have to be 9 meters max away and hope they have been there recently not with iq
---
Weeellll technically...
---
I wish there was a feature that would allow you to view the kill cam of your enemies at the end of a match.  Would have loved to have seen that.  Nice work Mate.
---
Lion be like
---
it happened to me yesterday, after I told myself that i'll give Monty one more chance after it happened once already, no more shields ever for me, i'd rather get a random 120 in 1 than get knifed through my shield, internet is good so im not lagging.
---
Idiotic fool ,150 to 250 is hell ,ive played my whole life with this shit ping ,it's the worst thing ever in gaming ,i peek ,someone that i have still not seen ,shoots me and i die ,plus the rubberband and shots taking time 150ms to register.
---
thanks! and yeah same. or like a theater mode thing. maybe shows the last 5 matches and you can watch from anyone‚Äôs perspective.
---
That one tap was beautiful
---
Spectating afterwards. Like after you finish the match and you can play it back.
---
So are we going to totally ignore how Lion is basically sitting on an invisible Bench?
---
Just fucking edit your shit and move on, lol.
---
It's honestly probably not because they're the top fragger. They've done something else to annoy the team, or they're last alive trying to clutch (the worst reason to ever kick someone).
---
** blinks **
---
** blinks again **
---
I would pay for N√∏kk to have to magnum
---
Not anymore üòÇ
---
So basically the AK's Great Grandchild.
---
Yep should be a crime
---
I love it
---
Thank you for doing this
---
wtf lion!  
---
he just vibin doe so i'll let him be....
---
r/PiperPerriMemes
---
too*
---
I love faster flicks too. Like the one Beaulo does. But for me technically that is very hard. I play on very low sensitivity for better precision. Exact settings would be 18 vertical 15  horizontal for mouse dpi 400 and sensitivity multiplier at 0.00223 . So for me to flick very fast I would need to put jets on my mouse(/s).
---
You're.. You're kidding right?
---
Ya your probably right my guy.
---
I'm sorry to inform you but it's happen to everyone, I have nothing more to say expect have a good day and good luck fixing it
---
XFactorAiming in your gamesettings.ini file
---
There are like 100000 of ‚Äúnew‚Äù operators ideas that‚Äôs basically a reworked Castle lol.
---
Nope, the ADS effects both and there is no way to separate ACOGs from 1x sights when it comes to sensitivity.
---
That‚Äôs the point, Sergeant.
---
Why is this toxic? Spawn peaking is great. It‚Äôs a fair fight for both sides. Just comes down to aim. Nice shots btw
---
Why do all these conceptual operators have access to the same helmet and visor?
---
Looks cool
---
That could be good but it would also not make sense and it would mess up roamers on ur team. If u blow something up, it usually blows up whatever is near, not what layer its on. And using ur logic u would have to use 2 impacts/2 nitros as a defender to get back to site. If that were the case it would only be useful on windows. It would be WAY too op to be on windows, and doors would be impractical. So i disagree but it is a pretty cool concept. Like if it worked differently(i.e. symmetras hard light but like teammates could pass thru but enemies cant but its not too realistic) also, i think if he just had a liquid thing that blocked vision through the door/window that could be good. It could either dissapear if u jumped thru it or it was blown up(second one doesnt really make sense) and obv both sides couldnt see thru, so it would essentially be a indestructible barricade that u can jump/shoot thru.
---
Glad you love it :D
---
I mean if you‚Äôre looking for help getting out of bronze. You might do better with other ops. Sticking with one op isn‚Äôt the best way to progress in siege. 
---
I‚Äôm just guessing your a newish player and basing what I said about trying other ops on that. Apologies if I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm not trying to offend
---
Dunno, just felt wrong
---
I definetly did not get this message and I was playing around that time (I decided to quit just as the update started).
---
NGL thought the drones had just finally had enough
---
Alright I did. Let's all calm down a little bit lol
---
You earned a subscribble i love your content lol
---
If I was that enemy I would storm downstairs for some food in anger only to come back upstairs with a half glass of water and feeling slightly fulfilled at getting rehydrated
