yeah..afterall we play the game for fun.. right?
---
[removed]
---
ok?
---
Indeed
---
Is their face model based off of sledges? The ears look very familiar
---
That's already an operator on PC, hackers, and we know the opinion of those who play against it.
---
Delet this
---
Player card?????
---
Termites assault rifle
---
Thermite
---
Yo man where did you get such a good mask
---
The card where the halloween skin shows waiting for the game to begin sorry for bad grammar im not from england
---
So what did King George mean when he said that they don't pay for the higher tear service from battle eye? Wouldnt a higher teur service sort through more players and ban more hackers?
---
Did you reinforce a wall with a Goyo and another person on the other side?
---
No. They're not. On my other account I got a common
---
ITS HOCKEY PUCK MAN
---
That wouldn‚Äôt happen to be an acog I see would it?
---
Oh, I don't know you might get it through the club idk
---
That would entail Jaegar only being good on like 3 objectives
---
Sucks. The best S.A.S. cosplay I've ever seen though
---
Website called displate

---
His new face looks droopy and weird 
---
His old one was rather red but I assumed that was from burns because he's a pyromaniac
---
its been 2years now still feel the pain.
---
I also got this but was kinda upset because I have Kapkan‚Äôs elite skin
---
Oh shoot sry I didn‚Äôt even realize it was upside down
---
You clearly have no idea what ironic means.
---
Shut up loser
---
I‚Äôve run plenty of recruit rushes and toxic run outs my guy. Running in single file and dying execution style just isn‚Äôt my idea of fun but hey to each their own.
---
Join pc, unranked Queue times are ~1.5 minutes on a slow day
---
More like Valkyrie
---
The idea was great but the execution was, pretty bad, though I can definitely appreciate the effort that went into this one I definitely won't be playing anymore of it than I have to
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a few months and i still can‚Äôt figure out some maps, but it is a great game otherwise, get some friends to play with and you‚Äôll have a great time
---
I didn't either, then I bought one with renown then it gave it to me. Idk
---
USSR chambers be like
---
HAHAHA HASN'T BEEN POSTED YET YOU'RE SUPER ORIGINAL AND HILARIOUS OP
---
I haven‚Äôt been on this sub sorry geeze
---
Ops that lost their ACOG lost it for a reason.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And a scope with a little bit less zoom than an ACOG is actually a buff. 
---
More than enough to see any details that ACOG can see, less visible recoil + easier to manage it, better suited to close range, better side visibility. Basically, a much better scope.
---
About Tachanka his turret could use a scope along with a Recoil reduction. (Otherwise the turret will became impossible to use), on the VSN though....it's really strong and might make Chanka use even less the turret.
---
However a strong buff of the SASG12 is needed, right now it's even below trash tier.
---
Warden is a 2/2 now, so no scope.
---
That‚Äôs a good point, I think then he‚Äôd need a better reward for interrogating them for more incentive or maybe have the sleeping darts be the only ammo for his pistol and then his ‚Äòreal‚Äô gadget would be an ability such as ‚Äúactive camo‚Äù which gives his clothes and weapons camos that blend into the coloring of the environment around him, but he can only use his secondary during that time.
---
Oh man xD I'm kinda worried now haha.
---
Can I have it? I‚Äôm a lesion main.
---
Agreed, however, R6Siege is still considered to have more friendly monetization.
---
Its like getting vote to kicked because its a 1v5. You all died before me, not my fault if we lose to a bunch of people roaming.
---
[This is just from a google search.](http://imgur.com/a/wPTzN8c). Says literally what I just did, but with a lot more detail.
---
Cool clip! Usually when you say XvX you put the number of your team first because that's how its displayed in the game. I guess it was pretty clear in this clip though.
---
Oh okay. Yeah I didn‚Äôt know about this event, bc I think this was happening around the same time I was going a month without video games lmao.
---
Was the event super toxic, or was your case just bad luck?
---
Only if you have smokes headgear lol.
---
You might have to restart the game a few times. My friend ended up getting his after he played a match, so try that too
---
This is completely unrelated to the topic at hand but how is Vigil now? I remember a year or so ago back before I had the game Vigil‚Äôs gadget sucked real bad apparently and now that I have the game I want to try him out.
---
They saw it coming when they decided to spend most of the team resources to crowd a single hallway
---
It‚Äôs Pikachu... it‚Äôs fuse.. sheeeettt
---
This is basically a copy of the suggested operator idea onThis sub
---
As a Romanian we need representation....at least a lil bit
---
Well id say just as toxic as normally.
---
Irony and ironic aren't the same. And that definition is nothing like what you said
---
The only semi-viable use for this gadget would be to counter mira‚Äôs gadget since you could just kill enemies and destroy the cam instead of blinding them. The problem with that is that, assuming someone could just pop the mirror after it being covered, it basically will do the same thing as hibana blowing the black mirror
---
It‚Äôs super fun, just get down the basic bomb sites and how to get there and you‚Äôll be fine

Youre arguing over the definition of a word because you realize I'm right, or does it really bother you that much because I could really give a shit less dude
---
In my opinion... and hopefully I don‚Äôt get downvoted to hell here, he‚Äôs gotten slightly worse. They‚Äôve shortened the amount of time he‚Äôs invisible to drones. I‚Äôm also not a Vigil main, so maybe others can give better insight.
---
^ This first off. 
---
Secondly, this has similar usefulness to a smoke grenade. Blocks cameras and miras, though maybe the paint sticks around? However this is extremely specific cases (mainly just Mira windows, as guns handle cams) and doesnt seem very counterable.
---
Ha
---
Don‚Äôt worry op this guy is acting like a dick
---
Well most twitch players just shock the enemies for assists and easy mvp position, let's not lie to ourselves. And prep phase is the best phase to get every enemy.
---
MOM WHATS YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO
---
Thanks
---
Probably someone who it didn‚Äôt happen to and he‚Äôs just jealous
---
I know you're wrong. If you were right I'd have no problem admitting it. But you're so far from being right
---
Console times for me are pretty quick
---
üò°
---
Yeah they're really cool dudes.
---
Why hello comrade :D
---
John Wick needs your help at Tilted! All he needs is your moms credit card info and the three wacky numbers on the back, lets go!
---
Why hello
---
It's never over... UwU
---
You should be able to shoot the bullet in the chamber of it's not empty
---
First off not everyone knows how to build a pc. Secondly you repeatedly stated that everyone can afford a pc when the actuality is they can‚Äôt and saying so is ignorant on your behalf if you believe everyone can afford to buy one.
---
Yes!!!!!
---
homemade/selfmade pc is definitely cheaper, they just gotta do their research and that'll save them some bucks tbh.
---
Good tip thx y
---
I‚Äôll try to make this an actual meme.
---
I drew it with thinking Owl. Cuz I like it's two eyes and cute face.
---
Same guy from the showdown event.
---
I will try.
---
Not all heros wear capes

Please permanently ban Terrorist Hunt afk farmers who use bots to stay active.

Wait there‚Äôs Cav hentai?? Please give me the sauce dad!
---
How would you clean this rug?
---
Using ad hominem because you don't have any arguements left... Huh
---
part 2 [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/451486147261235200/637460164211113984/unknown.png) taken by [ma BOI](https://www.reddit.com/user/DuccMann/) because my siege keeled over
---
favela. the amount of soft walls on every spot is insane
---
Well first off, they can look it up. I learned from youtube. Secondly, I said one thing on this thread. And that was what you replied to. I never said everyone can afford a pc, and its ignorant on your behalf to not read names before replying.
---
gonna clarify things a bit; i haven‚Äôt played ranked today, i was in an unranked match, but i didn‚Äôt leave, and i got this after dying
---
With terrorists.
---
Lots of them.
---
Just learn It then lol imagine having access to YouTube tutorials wow
---
For those of you wondering, I quit seige for a good two days after this happened...
---
*slow clap* this is simply amazing.....
---
Realistically, after adding in extended mag, the devs will have to nerf the weapons that can use it. Even currently, they are reducing ammo count and recently removed 5 bullets from one of the operators. The end result is that Siege will turn into Black Ops IIII with stupidly long time to kill (TTK).
---
I got the foreskin as well.
---
and the rug would clean the terrorists off the earth at the same time. how amazing. we've truly come far
---
Especially with used parts or parts that are on sale. And getting an APU (vega series) will cut the cost of a gpu, plus most of the parts are constantly becoming cheaper so with a good sale, it can get pretty cheap
---
[deleted]
---
That‚Äôs why I said some operators can have it others can‚Äôt, like hibana
---
it's not that much more than a console setup, you can build a decent gaming pc for around 500-600 bucks. 60hz monitor will probably be less than or around a hundred dollars, you can get a decent membrane keyboard for pretty cheap, a logitech g203 mouse is a great cheap mouse that only costs like 25 dollars or something. total will be around 700 bucks if you're smart with your budget.
---
When a still image proves nothing
---
Are you dumb or what? I'm talking about slow PCs, not GTX 2080 ti. If you can't afford a slow PC, you can't afford a console+games either omg How can't you understand that. My point is that instead of buying a slow PC+a console, Just buy a decent cheap PC instead
---
Dang
---
Oh yeah, why didn‚Äôt I think of this earlier? I‚Äôm so fucking stupid, I apologise for my tardiness
---
I let it go for 30 minutes once lol
---
Lol I‚Äôm in this pic
---
If this isn‚Äôt siegetober idk what is
---
One thousand two hundred rotations per minute
---
Okay boomer
---
When you become so Chad you kill the entire team.  This Sledge here was so Chad he made his entire team quit with one flex and then walked into the middle of the of the objective and demanded that the entire enemy team line up as tribute to his mighty hammer.
---
They had no choice
---
That makes no sense. You guys need to learn text comprehension before saying nonsensical stuff. "If you're poor, just get rich hur dur" How does that apply to this arguement? It makes no sense at all, a pior person can't buy a console either, s√≥ what's your point? You don't need to be rich to get a PC If you are smart enough to get used parts which can be pretty cheap
---
ive let it go for an hour then it forced me to restart my game
---
Does not matter who gets it. It will be overpowered and will result in the nerfing scenario above.
---
Ironically Call of Duty is cloning Siege and Modern Warfare 2019 is way more Siege-like than CoD-like. It even has automated call outs announcing where opfor was last seen.
---
If you have access to BO IIII, setup an LMG class with the unlimited ammo perk - that is how your ideal extended mag attachment scenario will play out.
---
Man I live in Brazil and can get those. Too bad for you, you're an exception
---
Damn a click destroying that isn't casual. Nice one.
---
Except the cod esport scene is on ps4 and it takes no effort to be good at so people who want to play a skill based  game will still play r6. Not to mention the campaign sucks
---
Ha yeah and it always comes from the 0/3 dude who picked recruit and sprinted to his death
---
I'm not telling you to buy a PC. Just saying that If you can buy a console, you can buy a PC. "How are you supposed to get a PC If you can't even get a console" I don't know where you got that from, I never said you are
---
I live in New Zealand, an Island nation over 11000km away from USA. Shipping is expensive. Also as a teenager without a job I simply can‚Äôt afford the shipping prices.
---

Can people seriously not tell that this isn‚Äôt theirs? The resolution is shit.
---
Why do you have to buy from the USA though? How aren't there any PC parts shop/shopping apps you can buy stuff from? You must be missing something. Brazil is a poor country and we have plenty of those
---
Yes and as Always they are in your Team and Not in the opponents Team, Same here every day.
---
You beat me to this.
---
I reccomend playing ash (attack) and rook (defense) to start with. 
---
Ash has an amazing loadout and a pretty straight forward gadget. She has a grenade launcher that shoots a breaching round that can destroy soft walls, barricades, and hatches.
---
Rook drops armor for your team to pick up which gives them added bullet protection and guarantees your teammates go into DBNO state (Down But Not Out) before they die, unless they're hit with a headshot (heads up just incase you don't know, in siege any gun that fires a bullet will kill with one headshot). Rook comes with an mp5 and a very powerful revolver.
---
I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of people picking 2 prowlers and 3 stalkers. Prowlers ping at the start one after the other so stalkers can move in and when attackers are in a chase prowlers pop off again so it‚Äôs harder to lose the defenders. 3 stalkers seems to be more than enough to cover the map especially when you know the usual hiding spots
---
BECAUSE WE ARE A FUCKING ISLAND NATION WITH ONLY 4 MILLION PEOPLE, AND USA IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF PC PARTS YOU IMPOTENT FUCK
---
I agree, if you can buy a console you can buy a pc. But, that‚Äôs gonna be one dogshit pc if it‚Äôs around the same price as a console. But I have no idea what you‚Äôre on about for that second part of your statement. Weird wording
---
Bro why would you play ranked with new people. I hope this is unranked cuz you were gonna lose even with a 5 man if they are as new as you say
---
I didn‚Äôt have this issue bro!
---
#triggered. New Zealand is definetly not poor though and I'm sure you have PC shops. I'm Sorry for your lack of brain cells R.I.P can't even use Google to look for shops ;-;
---
Skill
---
Matty and Copper were both on my team
---
Idk man but they‚Äôve switch so much around since March, all the maps are different and I don‚Äôt know the new strats and my shots are mad potato
---
#nice
---
Looks like a tie to me.
---
This is good.
---
r/SiegeAcademy is where I suggest posting this as wel
---
This looks like a cool action movie shot.
---
Ah yes... Nomalkyrie
---
How exactly do you do this?
---
Somethings wrong I can feel it
---
I'll post the same thing I post Everytime this is asked:
---
&gt;Do you really think you'll always find players in those modes, if left in there permanently?
---
People we're bored of outbreak after playing it on the effing TTS. People got bored of the wild west event in a matter of hours. What's the guarantee you'll find some in the game mode....6 months from now? Or even 3 months down the line?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I wouldn't mind, but I wouldn't be going into one of those a month or 2 from now expecting the queue time to be anything short of 60 minutes.
---
&gt;Also, data limits.
---
Ah yes the tracker abilities. Heartbeat scanner, movement detector, footprint tracker, and a fucking gun
---
Definitely post that
---
I was in a game and chat worked in main menu a while back. I could browse the store while teammates were breaching lmao.
---
I hate charms in event boxes

I hope to god this gets implemented. I‚Äôm not joking like 70% of my games 1 guy leaves the first round. I hate the fucking 4v5s I have to go through. No wonder why I went all the way down to bronze 5 from silver 1. Playing solo sucks a lot. Either casual or ranked.
---
These people ruin my games all the time.
---
Prowler op lol
---
I'm sorry mate but I'm from HongKong:)
---
judging by how monotonous wildlands was, i knew breakpoint was going to be a heap of grinding. plus if your ad campaign uses lil wayne, ya got issues.
---
hopefully this will "inspire" ubisoft to actually focus on the games people are playing.
---
i know they wont though.
---
I lost 100 elo from cheaters as well.
---
i agree with this a lot it‚Äôs what a lot of gold and even plat players don‚Äôt do much. especially with the droning it‚Äôs so useful to know where enemies aren‚Äôt cause then you can just use game sense to know where they are.
---
Different scenes load seperately so yes it will have take more time to load. It would have to render each operator 5 times per person per team. The game loads in the background while people do the character selection like a way of hiding the loading but some people have slower pcs or the servers might be funning slow. Just look at how long it takes for the operators tab on the main screen to load the 3d models. 
---
The only feasible way i see them doing this is to render an operator card for every outfit and youd get the one youd have the full outfit for. But thats resources that could go elsewhere not to mention it would totally ditch consistency with the games design.
---
Twitch only has 26 bullets now?
---
Kinky
---
Ya new patch
---
That‚Äôs effing retarded
---
F

recoil gets changed a lot.

Its things like this, that give me the strength I need to keep going. You are good men. All of you.
---
What do you mean? A lot of people wanted more of outbreak when it ended
---
Hmmmm ‰∏Äsomething went wrong

This is ALL I wanted. Bought 9 packs and gave up :(

I got all the fuckin charms though fml

It's not perfect but I know exactly what is happening on every picture. The camera has a effect of wide-screen. In some places lines are wrong but at the same time some of the boxes seem to be draw correctly. It's such a weird combination of spot on and completely wrong it's magical. This is new van Gogh
---
Maybe it only lasts for a certain amount of time then it burns up.
---
Literally everyone would just spawnpeek due to the better recoil control
---
You have to think about on consoles you also need the online subscriptions like Xbox gold and stuff, and depending on how many years you're planning on using it it will slowly add up, I think it is about $100 a year

I don't think Ubi support staff want to spend their Xmas holidays keeping every temporary game mode running.

What are linear? You didn't explain those, it was just "Linear...".
---
Why rook?!!??
---
If you know what's the next guy saying
---
I had the same but in attack.
---
Bro it ain‚Äôt that deep he‚Äôs just asking a question, the first thanksgiving was 1621 don‚Äôt you think you should move on.
---
either that or something that cant headshot like a laser similar to maestro cams or a slow or a DoT like gus
---
Dude I wanted to put the sound but me and my friend were just laughing our asses off
---
He that you were a closet kbm player because of you jutter when you play
---
requeue after one and a half minutes and youre getting put into one 30 mins after
---
I Tell Tell this people every round
---
Woo oooh that is soooo cooil
---
Just dont smurf on newcomer and im fine
---
As a person who plays one yeat Yes it's good game but harder than CSgo generally it's one of the hardes games but it's fun to play. Gameplay: there are two kind of operators: attackers and defenders, when game start u will be a defender or attacker and in the next round u will be opposite. One of it's unique property is that when you will die in the round there is no respawn and u must wait till the next round (must be careful not to die lol). Good about it: u must play so creative and tactical and use different tricks to confusing enemy team.
---
That c4 confused me because I haven‚Äôt played in months I thought they gave attackers c4‚Äôs lol
---
Ahh i get MnK accusations all the time because i run 95h horizontal..
---
The Linear don't have the tactile feedback, search on yt It Will help you to understand
---
Fuckin hell lmao
---
it's literally hide and seek
---
The German just makes it better
---
I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about this
---
It was great before they added stuff that made it less good
---
a ranked round has 180 seconds, with your cooldown of 45 seconds you can use the gadget twice and therefore the attackers only have 90 seconds of their gadgets. thats op and is a shitty idea
---
Hahaha still the shot was mega worth itüòÑ
---
Think about how many grenades are thrown through breaches in a wall, up or down stairways, from hatches or skylights...
---
The new op would be useless against those.
---
In most cases when you throw a grenade through a window, you are close to the window. So if the Gadget would be as easy to spot and destroy as a Kapkan Trap, it would be rather easy to deal with.
---
Again, that is simply OP. There isn‚Äôt really much else to it. A normal EMP disables everything electronic for far less time. 
---
There is no roamer/anti roamer meta. Caveira can‚Äôt be tracked by jackal so that makes her redundant. Overall it just makes operators pointless. Being on attack and stuck being able to not do anything for 30-45 seconds seems ridiculous.
---
When you're in a rank queue, always press try to type in chat before ending it, chances are you're already in a lobby trying to fill it up and you leave you might leave a random in a 1v5
---
it's a mix, when it's good, it's really good.
---
when the game is fucking up, it's brain splitting bad.
---
Okay, thanks.
---
Seems nice actually. Really good idea but the name needs a change. But he could only carry like 2 of them.
---
This is most hilarious fucking thing i've seen all day.
---
ruining the game aside, i find hackers in this game weirdly funny, we have teleport in the sky hack, teleport into your face hack, become invisible and knife everyone hack, sprint super fast hack, now we have unlimited HP hack.
---
Siege is a good game for troll hacks....
---
Amen. Why is this asked every day, why don‚Äôt people just buy what they like??
---
The horrible things is you cant even rejoin..
---
How tf did you kill so many? Did you get the ace every round?
---
It gave me more drugs

Rise my Beloved Buck Mains, time to show them, super fast lady is not more scary than canadian man shoving shotgun up your face everytime you fight him.

It's not like I want to give you your plates or anything, baka. I just wanted a plate for myself. I made extra, so take one if you want.
---
I love Thermite‚Äòs animation and Hibana‚Äòs outfit
---
Why
---
He looks so pleased with himself
---
Because A: Most of the event charms are pretty bad
---
B: We already have fucktons of charms than we never use and it just adds ro the list.
---
C: If you buy all the packs then sure they're okay, but when you look at probabilities, you have way more headgears, uniforms and weapon skins that you do charm yet all you get in your free packs are charms.
---
D: Most people including the owner themselves don't pay attention to the charms as much as they do the skins.
---
People are much more likely to say you have a cool weapon skin (or uniform etc) than a cool charm.
---
Yeah, because I knew that 3 years ago when I had no money and wanted to play the game all my friends were talking abou
---
So this was basically pay-to-win at some point?
---
Exactly. He knows what he did.
---
Maybe not for all operator, I have weird bet that Ubisoft will definitely will create weeb event since they have the gut to do April Fool event.
---
1. trash talking your team happens in every game, not only in siege, its a human thing and not started by siege. 2. thats the fun part when the enemies get toxic first and you beat them and you get to talk shit is a phenomenal experience 3. what do you even mean with that literally every pro player sweats 4. if a ash can drone out roamers and traps and do a successful rush, losing that round isnt sieges fault, its the defenders fault
---
If they do, i swear i will buy EVERY SINGLE SKIN that they will release during the event
---
Im studying journalism and have worked in a few different newsrooms. Reporters nowadays have to do stories on a variety of topics in relatively short time. Often this means that they may make mistakes in some part of their work. Their editors/publishers should've spotted it before publication, but they're in the same boat as the reporter.
---
The first 3 are the main ingredients of a competitive game?
---
First, yeah his name is terrible but for the second question, i don't think that the attacker should be able to remove it because it will be useless like stepping on a gu and immediately removing it after. Maybe after a certain period of time it self destructs or something idk
---
Your idea?? Hmmm
---
I hate cheaters, but imagine 10000 hp sledge running full speed towards you with his hammer while he eats your bullets
---
Red dot gang gang gang
---
Thank you for your elaborate calculations.
---
I admit I made a mistake. I purchased my last base operators just before the starter edition was annihilated and thus paid ridiculous prices for all base operators and now have to grind the y3 ops on top of that. Since the prices for the y3 didnt chage, I assumed the prices overall didnt change. Turns out they just always were that expensive.
---
I was confused as a friend who recently got the game enthusiastically told me how cheap every operator was and that he got so many already, also from y2 and y3. Turns out he bought the Gold edition or something.
---
Again, thank you very much!
---
You look amazing!
---
That self destruct thing seems nice. So it makes it more skillful since you have to know when to use. Also flair is true.
---
They should just change headshots so they are an instant kill rather than a numerical value for damage. This way this particular cheat won't work.
---
no, have this one instead.

You have to connect to a game right at the end of operator select. Join too early and it'll random you into a proper operator, too late and it won't put you in for that round.

Probably should switch to pc instead of getting the ps5 tho

What does your name mean, anyway?

You nailed it.

That second floor room is the best "site", period. Frost mat on the window completely shuts it down, and then you only worry about the door. But it requires coordination, sadly.
---
Red dot: 
---
Cons: you said them 
---
Pros: it‚Äôs the smaller "dot" so you have more precision.
---
Reflex:
---
Cons: the triangle is a bit hard to get used to because the billets go to the top of it.
---
Pros: smaller casing of all the sights
---
Holo:
---
Cons: the casing is big and can hide the enemy, imo less than the red dot.
---
Pros: I find it to be the more precise of them all because of the way it‚Äôs design.
---
Get flanked did a video listing all of the pros and cons I probably forgot some of them.
---
Warden it's not too bad
---
start with a second person, that guy leaves and then you farm, ez pz
---
Bro that plus having to buy all the base ops 25k for base ops and roughly 10k for all attachments 
---
I wanted dlc ops so basically i ended up buying a sight for each gun and maybe a grip if its good so i could save up
---
Okay thanks!
---
You injured him while he was vaulting
---
Wtf
---
toxic
---
The times where u had to buy tho original 20 and my first op was fuze
---
Indeed. I should've probably contacted Ubisoft and asked for a refund or the difference back to me because it's extremely shitty luck to do that especially how I never usually buy "DLC" or expansions for games.
---
You know what's the most pathetic thing in the world? People trying their asses off in a 5v4. Or a 5v3. Good on you and your team for not being like that.
---
atleast u didn‚Äôt get to skins for a operater u didn‚Äôt even unlock
---
How would I ensure that I get an account with ONLY recruit on it? I have a recruit only account currently but that was due to free weekend - can only play it on free weekends.
---
What the fuck is this
---
i'd say switch n√∏kk for warden. they're both still kinda bad, but n√∏kk is much worse
---
I think i started to see more ELA cosplays than others for unknown reason
---
and that's what real heroes do!
---
Its a gift of mine ;)
---
I would probably have an extra op right now
---
I member
---
Yeah can I get a refund by chance?
---
They gave away 2 free operator packs, I think we good
---
Thats just too long for one game... i think before every season end there should be a poll to remove a map
---
Ah, does were the times
---
I‚Äôd always save up to buy an operator but forget about the attachments
---
Well you will need to add 4 friends either way . Have 4 friends with boosters and play Thunt squad only extract the hostage on house map  on normal difficulty .
---
Eh. Completely is debatable. You can leap in and break the mat with good timing. But it‚Äôs def a really good spot to hold down too. Probably the best.
---
Or, nobody at Ubi has ever seen a human being in their life, and they're just eyeballing the weight. Lesion is same height as Rook, but 15kgs heavier. Do you believe that?
---
r/uselessnobody
---
who remembers no dlc ops and like 5 maps
---
No, the renown wasn't taken away, it was traded in exchange for an item. I can see where you are coming from, but I'm just explaining why they didn't compensate.
---
Eh. Can‚Äôt see how you can lose if you‚Äôre half competent (and not with randoms). Just traps and smoke alone will burn a minute+ then you all just go invisible and leg it. Odds of them catching all of you in less than a minute is really slim when you can burn two more invisibility buffs.
---
I thought that, but the +50 injure doesn't appear until hes nearly behind the desk?
---
H1Z1 went f2p and they compensated players by giving them 3 free crates and a full set of skins and also a new vehicle skin.
---
I'm still salty about my wasted renown
---
bc r/rainbow6 is obsessed with anything ela related

---
Its along the lines of each would have a different strength in three criteria: the size of the dot/crosshair, the amount of room between the dot and the scope, and the thickness of the scope itself. The reflex has a decently sized dot compared to the amount of room the scope blocks on your screen, and the holographic scope takes up a fair bit of room in your screen, but also has a good crosshair and room between the crosshair and the edge, so it's easier to see. The problem with the red dot is that its dot is fairly big. The whole scope's size on your screen in general is as big as the holographic, but takes like 90% more of your screen, which is stacked on top of a dot that is too big, blocking even more of your view while ADSing. That's why I suggested that it needs a buff, but was wondering if my changes would be drastic and how someone might change them or just have a better idea in general.
---
Pulse scanner
---
id rather not spend half the price of an operator just for a charm.
---
They didn't take it, you chose to exchange it for an item. I hope that clears things up for you.
---
why don't you just throw a frag nade? the result would be nearly the same
---
I spent so much renown and before last year when my friend told me it was an uptatae I had always thought that me buying them all to one unlocked them for all even tho I had bought them for like 9 operators
---
I wanted to get all the ops before working on attachments, so I never had any
---
You are not my friend. You are my brother, my friend!
---
I remember not getting my refund when they made them free. And paying 250 for ACOG.
---
Black ice was a seasonal skin, personally I think only people who played during black ice should have it.

dang you got alot of downvotes. you should said your pp is hard for R6 ops turned into 12 yr old girls.  that's how this sub works.
---
On J√§ger and Bandit that 250 was worth it though.
---
A small portion of your head is above the shield
---
I got supa triggered when Ubi didn't give the renown back for the attachments because I had all of them
---
Injure while vaulting that‚Äôs all there is to it
---
No AI, no matter how complex or simple, should be in multiplayer
---
My friend got mr. Smiley aka the ballsack
---
If you land the shots, that and the CAMRS become the two most OP guns in the game because the TTK is the lowest amongst all full autos on attack except the smg11 and 12.
---
I did too lmao but I got Docs and Smokes headgears along with Frosts uniform. Fuck I just want Kapkans headgear.
---
All platforms have multiple veraions.
---
Yeah i remember myself slaying with bandit Acog. Good times.
---
No, the Angled Grip increases ADS time and the Vertical Grip helps reduce recoil.
---
Wait you finally dont have to pay for attachments?
---
Should I repost? I posted this at midnight lol
---
Go into the ps store, then find the side bar that says redeem codes. Then put in your code.

Lesion got sent to the moon hahahhaa wow

You could just play recruit in cas, or just not use your gadget
---
No
---
5 seconds to insertion
---
I got so lucky last year and got it in my first pack. That's why I know I'm not getting shit this season
---
Price does not go up anymore, its a flat 1k now. Just bought my last OG OP a week ago or so.
---
I honestly miss having to buy all the attachments. It made the game feel... More genuine for the grind. Now the grind feels worthless
---
This is such flawed thinking. Your brain must be the size of a pea.
---
Well apparently it's all training so you're not really killing anybody in it
---
I‚Äôve been agreeing with this, but I feel like the only reason Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt do that is because 5 stacks would abuse it. If they‚Äôre losing, they can just have someone take one for the team and disconnect or have someone play on a Smurf, then just have them disconnect from their internet to prevent the rest of the team from losing points for the loss
---
No lmao
---
They refunded jack shit.
---
Said something about "Techincal limitations" or someshit.
---
If you bought all base ops and attachments (Over 20k renown) you got absolutely nothing
---
Showdown event. The only texan in the crew ( My man Thermite) didn't get a skin. That's wrong.
---
For the last time, for the last time that I say this in the comments, I didn't say that I believe they are overpowered. The way that they play and the way that their mechanics are set up are so unlike any other operator that it isn't like playing real siege. Y'all can't read
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Same! I stopped playing D2 a couple months after release but with everything being free I also got back into it. Only took me a few days to buy the new DLC and I've been playing multiple times a week now. Definitely worked well for them. Without Activision needing a new game release every few years, bungie can let the game grow
---
thats such bs
---
Ps
---
People shoot at you, you shoot back at them. Spawn peeking is the best strategy and no matter what you should ignore the objective
---
Wtf is wrong with you kiddo?
---
Ela anda nokk are fun :( they sould be at second tier
---
I got this game January 18th 2018 and it gave me enough time to buy all ops before they all became free too
---
Me. They weren't too bad
---
Before you bring up that I said unfair advantage, yes I believe that shields are at an advantage with the unkillable thing, but not to an overpowered point. I'm not of the belief that they should be needed anymore.
---
He is beyond a simple tier list
---
Yes.
---
I was so focused on getting ops I played the first month without a single attachment, and I wasn't even doing that bad.
---
Looks pretty solid, thanks for the recommendation!
---
It was a good mechanic when the game was new, but now there's so many ops it would take forever to unlock everything and people would quit the game a lot earlier than they should be.
---
That was so annoying.
---
That's sadly unsurprising. And of course it happened so long ago it isn't as talked about now so we'll never get refunded. 
---
Also i doubt that it's too difficult to refund people in the first place, just give them back the amount they paid based on how many ops and attachments before they changed it to be free. I'm sure they could have done that.
---
GUYS LOOK! FINKA HOLO!
---
All of the Defenders on the Halloween event (except ela for rn) have Elite skins but their gadgets go back to normal for some reason. I remember back on the April Fool's event if you had Elite kapkan you would have the elite kapkan traps so idk what ubi is doing
---
I don't mean to be rude but the gane literally tells you this, go to "guide" when choosing ranked and you'll find it
---
Capitao&gt;Maestro&gt;Finka
---
*visible confusion, need clarification*
---
I remember holding off from buying a new op until i had 2k more renown to buy attachments
---
I am jerking off to this more than I should.
---
ah man those days, when u earn just enough for a new op and not enough for attachments
---
Same thing happend to us, indestructable painting.   
---

Normally I wouldn't complain cause it's optional stuff, but charms in paid packs are getting hella annoying.
---
Who remembers not getting refunded for them lul
---
I want all my renown for the vanilla ops and attachments back
---
It's kind of their job to figure it out
---
Yeah but you still have to pay the game.
---
A "Cheap video game going ftp" almost always offers some form of compensation. Tf2, Evolve, etc. 
---
This was ubisoft just being greedy as fuck
---
Money heist. It‚Äôs a great show on Netflix

not really queue up with a gold if you want to get more elo for winning
---
I miss old siege, I miss the old maps, and god fucking dammit look what they did to my boy glaz :(
---
I remember how people complained that they didn‚Äôt a renown refund for their attachments
---
:(
---
So glad they changed it
---
I started r6 two months ago and was very surprised that all the barrels and scopes were unlocked on the spot. But it's the obvious right choice if you want a skill-based tactical game that can take new people in.
---
Those were the good times
---
No.
---
This is discussed almost everyday and the answer is still the same: it is the easiest to abuse in stacks.
---
Your giving me ptsd
---
Shit was rough bro
---
It also depends when you lose it lol. Like if you lose 10 games in a row right after your placements then win 10 games, you're still losing elo.
---
remembered it but never into it tho
---
Either someone was taking their only operators or they just wanted to have some fun
---
Cursed image üò≠
---
I don't have that problem, mine is I mute people but I can still hear them
---
If you never buy an operator for that side then you can play recruit because that‚Äôs all you have..
---
Remember having to buy the acog?
---
Any dipshit with enough spotting bonuses get coronel these days.
---
Yea those were the good old days
---
Check the in-game guide. Ranked maps aren't rotated. They only get additions at the start of the season.
---
what
---
I wouldn‚Äôt suggest nokk and warden, since they are already pretty weak and don‚Äôt seem to fit your play style. Nokk could be fun but it will take some time getting used to her weaker weapons compared to the weapons of your attacker mains.
---
&gt;I'm just explaining why they didn't compensate.
---
They didnt because people would buy new ops with the refunded renown, and not spend more time grinding/paying for plat.
---
Its obvious.
---
Those good old days
---
I am still beyond petty about this.  Spent over 100k of renown then it all just changes
---
Where?
---
Is it still sd? Does it have weapon trails and markers? It is difficult to use even if you can get good at it, that doesn‚Äôt make it good.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be

They need to make ACOG universal again... I miss it so much on my 416-C.
---
How did I never hear this? Always assumed she was italian
---
Ahhhh I remember those days
---
because they want to play on a higher refresh rate. if he has a 144hz monitor. playing with higher refresh rates is more enjoyable and better experience. I've played 144hz for like a year and I cant go back to 60 because it feels weird and would put me at a significant disadvantage.
---
Payed attachment gang rise up
---
I had no idea that was there
---
Read her bio. Only ma√®stro iss italian, shes lybian.
---
Mine got refunded
---
Server Issues. There is some spooky things going on since the last update.

I feel so robbed. They should reimburse players who bought attachments.

üòÇ that‚Äôs such a mozzie thing to say

I have done this for an auto run feature. Felt like a genius

Ask yourself that same question when you pump a whole mag into Blackbeard's body, yet still he has 100 HP and kills you. In the killcam you hear you gun shooting, but the bullets start flying after you are dead. So srly there is something wrong after the last update - but you guys are all like: Video proof or it doesn't happen. Ubi doesn't makes any mistakes, probably your connection, bla bla bla.
---
*OH MAMA*

I'd add your platform and region
---
Nah you screw yourself over by leaning the wrong way and missing your shots
---
Oh shit
---
Don‚Äôt give me flash backs please
---
What do you play on?
---
Thank you, I forgot!
---
Look at the top right corner, if I included the sound you would have heard the shots hitting doc.
---
No no no, he's 1 speed, the "becoming a 2 speed" when he releases the dog is just a thought
---
Actually maybe he should be a 1 speed 2 armor and when he releases de dog he could become a 2-2
---
Ps4
---
Hit his head next time
---
I don‚Äôt man it looked like you only shot him 2 or 3 times
---
really? the majority of people I know have an alternate account lol
---
&gt;Actually maybe he should be a 1 speed 2 armor and when he releases de dog he could become a 2-2
---
Yes, good
---
But fuck AI in multiplayer, look at CoD
---
yes and I used to much renow for that shit
---
g2 still has oga pit , and online qualifiers spot
---
No you are the only person that has this! amazing right! So unique such wow!

---
I've played since day 1 of release. The original operators cost 500 to 2000, increasing for each OP you bought out of that set. 25k was for DLC operators.
---
The ones in CoD are OP because they are instakill, this one can be heard coming your way, is an easy target, and you can push him off you
---
It feels like it's going to be op as fuck tho
---
No, dude. The 500-2000 was part of the update when they deciding to make them pricy again. Look it up, og ops were expensive my guy
---
what you talking about captiao is way better support then finka she‚Äôs one of the most useless operators in the game. she‚Äôs never picked in high ranks as she‚Äôs useless cause the no recoil means nothing and the health doesnt do much in a one shot headshot game. captiao can be used to cut off a doorway stop bandit trickers, area denial moving people from a certain spot. and he has smokes with flashbangs.
---
Whats this, OC on this sub instead of the mindless rainbow is magic pack error spam? Have my upvote!
---
Nope.
---
Oh good I remember those days. Damn I miss when siege wasn't full of sweaty assholes
---
Dude screw off
---
To balance it out you should need to control the dog, like in CoD ghosts, where the dog had a camera on him and you control him, all the while your character is vulnerable.
---
I buy console games 2nd hand at like half the price so that's not an issue for me. And the subscription thing never bothered me too much. If you can make an HK account you can get it at a cheaper price than NA or EU accounts.

Because it literally is Wildlands. Just a new map, new story and some stupid additions (such as the survival element) to make it look new, oh and on top of it inject even worse MTX.
---
games a simulation anyway the dog would just roll over and pretend to be dead and then run off out the map
---
I rarely buy digital copies, I mostly buy physical 2nd hand copies cause those are way cheaper. I don't bother waiting a month or two for the price to drop or for someone to sell their game cause I already have tons of games to play at my hand.
---
I do
---
Ok
---
This was why I never got to try our Jager with ACOG. I couldn't afford it and coming fresh from Call of Duty I didn't want to spend money on an attachment I assumed I would suck with
---
I have been as well recently
---
We don‚Äôt need more entry fragger
---
Shit can I post stuff like this and gets thousands of upvotes easy?
---
I really hope this fake
---
I usually leave when the enemy team hits 3 wins so I'm not the person that always leaves mid game
---
I love how the authors name is bigger than the title
---
Also Lemme know how it is, I love R6 siege and was thinking of looking into it
---
?
---
*Laughter devolves into sobbing*
---
Why tho
---
The memories
---
‚ÄúChases down the nearest defender‚Äù sounds awful to me.
---
Plz help
---
That‚Äôs horrible, man I wonder what exact steps it would take to do something so horrible. Someone should show the steps to do it so Ubi can fix this horrible bug....
---
I've made a bunch of friends from siege on ps4 and none of them or anyone else I've chatted with in casual have an alt. Occassionally I'll run into the odd smurf here or there. One of my friends doesnt play on his main account only cuz it got banned cuz hes got a mouth on him, but is also insanely good at the game.
---
Uh no. The original ops for me were 12500 renown each
---
Sobbing evolves into depression from the hundreds of dogs who just wanted love from their masters you killed
---
The only traps they can hit are frost mats. They cant hit Ela mines, kapkan traps or smoke grenades. They might be able to hit a lesion mine if they see where its placed. To say "they have to hit all of the traps to win" is a major simplification of what's really going on here. Trying to hit all of the traps while ela mined is a pain in the ass, now consider that you also have to pull a gu mine out of your foot, and smoke can use his gadget without the penalty of friendly fire, and what you're left with is this cluster f*ck where at least half your team is almost guaranteed to die. Oh and while you're focused on the frost mats and pulling lesion mines out of your leg, most of the enemy team has ran past you out the door. I completely disagree with you. I dont think this game mode is based toward attackers
---
Hello fellow R6S players. I am the streamer that caught this aimbotter in question. The fact that he is gloating about on plebbit just shows how easily manipulated he is and how much of an large ego this kid truly has. A true brainlet. I have sufficient evidence to prove that he is in fact aimbotting. I am giving you my side of the story as this post is objectively disingenuous. You have to be stupid and gullible enough to believe this tard.
---
I have personally used aimbots in several FPS games but generally avoid them as they take all the fun and challenge out of the game. The most obvious hacking features are aimbot,ESP,chams,radar,nospread and nametags. I have played a large variety of FPS games for almost 20 years. It is easy to spot if you have personally used them yourself. I was simply smart enough to catch this idiot for myself.
---
He is looking through walls using ESP,using aimbot to lock on to enemy targets,prefiring around corners and snapping movements from target to target. The typical stuff that most aimbotters do. He has multiple accounts therefore he has been banned several times before. Smurfing = Banned this has always been an issue in most multiplayer games. Ubicrap doesn't care as long as they keep buying new accounts.
---
You can watch the entire stream of that match for yourself here [https://youtu.be/UwLYqWGYD-8](https://youtu.be/UwLYqWGYD-8)
---
This aimbotter changed his username from SmursAccounts3 to Copper5Main within the span of 24 hours. uPlay allows you to change your username once a month. The fact that he changed it the moment that he got caught just shows that is in fact ban dodging. Probably not the first time he has done this. I friended to keep track of this tard.
---
In a nutshell:
---
\- Aimbotter got caught on stream by an experienced player.
---
\- Aimbotters I friended this idiot in advance because I know aimbotters love to gloat.
---
\- Aimbotters are self-delusional and think they are good,they fail at life so they cheat in a game to have a false sense of power over their pathetic lives.
---
\- Aimbotter uploads to plebbit to rake in upvote currency, plebbitors dislike my video in a massive toxic hate mob before evidence or counter-argument is provided.
---
\- Aimbotter gets destroyed when I recorded all the evidence and present it.
---
\- Aimbotter gets banned by Ubicrap along with this alt accounts.
---
\- PROFIT.
---
This is why nobody goes on plebbit honestly. I created this account for this sole reason.
---
\[ PROOF &amp; EVIDENCE \]

Here is proof with a screenshot comparison that he changed his username to dodge a ban [http://magaimg.net/img/9dnj.jpg](http://magaimg.net/img/9dnj.jpg)

---
The entire chat conversation [https://youtu.be/pqUIRbab8vM](https://youtu.be/pqUIRbab8vM)
---
I called it out on stream that this idiot would spawnpeek and kill most of my team seconds in advance. I knew exactly where he was going to shoot from and what angles. Because if I was an aimbotter using ESP hacks to look through walls that is what I would do.
---
I will not expect Ubicrap to ban this brainlet immediately. I will surprised if they did. The moment this dumbass get banned all of a sudden this entire conversation will suddenly go silent. In the meantime the angry screeching NPCs will attack,dislike spam and cry on my channel on how I need to "GIT GUD" and how "I am bad at this game". It's toxic idiots like you are the reason why large amounts of legit players like myself leave this game only for the toxic,cheating NPCs remain.
---
I hope all of you toxic idiots lock yourselves with reinforced walls on Presidential Plane and gas yourselves. [https://youtu.be/K8wEyDIgR2M?t=3940](https://youtu.be/K8wEyDIgR2M?t=3940)

I hope you know that the next op is gonna be a new hard breacher, with an impact like gadget. Mark my words.
---
I mean, if you're an ash main using r4c with a suppressor, yea, its the worst. If you're a n√∏kk rushing obj frome behind with the fmg-9, maybe consider the suppressor over say, a flash hider
---
I looked it up everywhere like YouTube google and could not find how she did it
---
People get mad at blizzard for sensor ship but rainbow had been doing it all along
---
üôÉ
---
Obviously, but not all people play with mics
---
It's the closest server that changes their region and rank
---
you shot nothing but steel frame
---
I‚Äôm not saying give more than one item
---
cant wait to shotgun the poor dog lol
---
It is their jobs yeah however they are also human beings with a work limit lives outside of developing a video game and family's
---
If you had an elite controller would you be able to map contextual lean from the hip to the bottom buttons ?
---
Yeah
---
Yes, you are
---
No, a universal skin doesn‚Äôt count as 20+ items
---
I got ptsd from that
---
You can lean from ‚Äúhip fire‚Äù if you have like a certain gadget or a Grenade in your hand
---
This is why I stopped playing this money-pit of a game.
---
Fingers.
---
Please let there be no reused weapons.
---
Spent 25.000 renown on ops and Idek how many on gadgets, but I had bought them all, and then they give them for free to make the game noobfriendly wish I would‚Äôve gotten a refund
---
It would feel so cheap, really ruining the game
---
Lol I‚Äôm a frost main I wanted her skin so badly!!!!!
---
Me as fuck
---
Please
---
Because we don‚Äôt want to fight AI in a competitive multiplayer game
---
I either start trying to score on myself or start juking people no matter what side it's on
---
you can hit kapkan traps and lesion mines pretty easily. plus, if your whole team runs in at once and all get lea mined so it‚Äôs possible for them to run past you and live, maybe ur team needs a bit of work
---
Good job on everything else !

Thanks! uwu
---
No I don't want an operator I can't counter
---
I can't bring myself to shoot a doggo :'(
---
It's definitely a mixture. A round can go super slowly but it can be very chaotic too. It's the best competitive game right now imo. I should add that if you're a very casual player you might not enjoy it a whole lot.
---
More useless than warden tachanka and amaru combine.
---
Whatever you can do for a long time is good practice. If that‚Äôs T hunt then sure. If that‚Äôs casual then that‚Äôs what you should do.
---
Thank you
---
Monty on defence
---
I afk every drone phase never got kicked
---
Just play Call of Duty or fast paced shooters, it really helps improve your aim.
---
Hehehehe look how funny it is they didn‚Äôt change the text Hahahs so funny.
---
When you reach the outlet first, but everyone else needs to charge.
---
Imagine spawnpeeking/run-out bombers with shields.
---
Dokkaebi to defense 
---
Pulse on attack
---
Lol so Clash but better. I like it üòé
---
There is a battery attached to that shield. That's why. And also he is French. Any other questions?
---
I think it would be fun to play frost on attacking, rush in and randomly put down traps
---
Still VERY convincing though, because he is Asian.
---
Just shoot at the operator, killing him will make the dog lay by his side
---
This ain't the one lol y'all tryna ruin the game
---
Main OP can only have a knife or a shitty pistol. Or maybe the dog only moves and attacks like controlling a drone.
---
Good
---
Right? Does anyone remember COD Zombies? The hellhound round was basically just a free points round if you just stayed in a corner and pointed at them. I rarely remember ever dying in a hounds round
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if the roles were reversed? Humans try to defend themselves from bloodthirsty monsters. The monsters can only melee but there is a special kill animation for each of them. The humans can not damage except for their traps.
---
Aight who downvoted me what did i do to y'all
---
THAT'S JUST AS BAD D':
---
That's absolutely heartbreaking
---
Another bad player complains because of the scorpion . Git gud
---
FYI, The next game I played ran around 10ms the whole match
---
It was never removed.
---
Maps are in a half season rotation. What went out in the first half came back now.
---
Again it's their job, if they can't handle their job they should find a different career
---
Dude honestly when op white noise first came out I thought they had it ass backwards. Glad that nokk is here to have as it should have been all along. And weve gotten a good taste of that on the Halloween event (:
---
I had excess renown so I went and unlocked every attachment. Then I got the year 3 pass and found out operators and attachments also get discounted. 
---
"Shit, well it's not that bad. I still get Vigil and his attachments discounted." 
---
Then a week later all attachments are free. 
---
"ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!?!?!"
---
Y e s
---
Same here, EU west
---
Still pissed
---
Glad the event has that Happen lol
---
same i bought it on thuesday...
---
God that was the worst.
---
They should just get rid of it it makes me suicidal and I‚Äôm not joking either
---
Smooth it out a little and you got some pretty cool B roll intro footage
---
They said it was sarcasm...
---
Exactly. It just shows how useful he would be as an attacker.
---
Where's the upvotes this is so accurate
---
why the hell does everyone pretend the game's perfect like it is

Lol

The dark age
---
Oh my god

---
Gimmie all of my renown back &gt;:(
---
Thanks for feedback
---
Cool
---
Last years halloween event/skins was way better than this years
---
It doesn‚Äôt really feel like hide and seek though since they can see you through walls and jackal track you. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad but it feels more like keep away to me.
---
Magnification\*
---
Looking at it the other way around is pretty funny
---
Restart Uplay, restart computer, reinstall, contact support
---
Think about it this way, now that they're making destiny 2 free, are the developers giving back all the money that people paid for the game? No
---
I remember compulsively spending everything I got on going for 100% completion for all guns on all operators. I had like 95% of all attachments right before they made the announcement.
---
Maestro is even that strong... he has far to many counters.. he‚Äôs not even viable in most spots. 
---
Twitch, thatcher, sledge, finka, dokabi, buck, zofia, ash, maverick can all easily take out his cam..
---
K
---
K I L L M E
---
Then learn how to play against it once you can counter it it‚Äôs an easy win
---
Would have been nice if they gave us a refund. I bought every damn attachment in the game before they made them all free. And by refund I mean like Ubi donating 20k Renown for each player before the day they made it free.
---
I mean you have every right to ask for it. It's up to them how they handle it from there on.
---
It's not about entitlement, you can call it petty. In a lot of cases it is. But depending on store policy you **may** indeed get a refund. Depending on the store.
---
Have done it with steam, have done it in real life. Have done it with Arenanet.
---
Retaining a customer is a strong point.
---
I had a 19 minute queue with no errors. But we did find a match!
---
didnt say it wasnt ;)
---
Really depends on you'r play style i really like both but mostly i anchor so lesion for me.
---
I hope we get these cards for defenders if you have the headgear and uniform on after the event
---
He is probably on situations
---
How are you comparing the mechanics to rainbow is magic? Rainbow is magic had no special mechanics. It was just hostage
---
I was reinforcing a wall in unranked and turned around and the rest of my team surrounded me like this. I got spooked lol
---
again, alpha packs in general should be paid for.  i understand that.  
---
but events during the holidays?  yes i understand that people work to make this content, but they‚Äôre not commission based.  they get paid to do it the whole time.  
---
hell, plenty of game companies do it all the time.  almost all mmorpgs like Guild Wars, WoW and Black Desert have free events where you can earn cosmetics and keep them to show off later!
---
there‚Äôs probably a huge list of games/companies that don‚Äôt lock fun event cosmetics behind pay walls.  even Sea of Thieves comes to mind, and that game isn‚Äôt nearly as big as siege, yet they can afford it and Ubisoft can‚Äôt?
---
I do...and all the base operators
---
You can destroy all traps lmao
---
Wait. Thats illegal.
---
Literally lost a round because I kept trying to destroy this lmao. It‚Äôs so distracting
---
I feel dead now oof
---
glaz isn't that bad now with the improved firing rate but should definetely be changed, at least remove the blue so his scope is clean without thermals
---
Mhm, one dog, if he dies, he gone
---
New ops were 25k each. The original started at 500 and went up for each one out of that tasks force you had.
---
That's not ddos but ok.
---
Remember when the smg11 had an acog? Smoke at his peak for sure
---
IQ elite skin
---
You never played hide and seek or tag as a kid, did you? 
---
The concept of bait and scatter is a thing you should be doing or expect to lose as defenders, whether you are playing Ela or not. The reason to bait is the first 4 operatives, the ability to scatter is smoke, Lesion and Ela, mostly Ela. Without her they can chase you down. If you don't want to play as a team, play a different game, this game won't and never should be balanced around you, even this silly event game.  A Kapkan trap won't stop a hunter from smashing his way into the room you are hiding and smacking your shit, but an Ela trap will give you a chance to bail. Without your invis you are dead either way, in combination with Ela's mine and an invis you can relocate without them being able to track or hear you properly. 
---
And you are clearly just a salty Ela main, a female 3 speed is the worst operator in the game? Give me a break.

Take a fucking look you mongoloid, she has the third highest win rate of the defenders. Please do reply as i want to know how despite the straight fact that you are wrong how you are gonna refute basic stats.

casual is way worse than rank, casual players are more likely to TK, kicked, left game half way, and mic spam. At least most people take rank seriously.

---
Hello MrStonefish1, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dnk5p0/throwing_myself_on_your_mercy/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
this wasn't that long ago
---
Rainbow Six quarantine was based off of the event that we got, where a bunch of monsters were summoned and team rainbow had to take out some of them and find the source. It was located in a barn that an old man brought back
---
That's true but an entrance recruit can easily take out at least 3, so I figured.
---
"pleasure"
---
and you play recruit by not having operators..also just report them to ubisoft, not here
---
Clash is good if you have a team to coordinate with, Warden is, universally good but still weak in comparison. His recent buff might‚Äôve helped him a bit but he is still a little underwhelming.
---
They always hit the second one.
---
That's how I remember it, but people are saying that the original ops were 2.5k and then changed during some patch to be 500-2000.
---
no they didn‚Äôt
---
Bruh those flashlights blinded me in game and on real life they were bright af
---
Played since beta
---
Member Kaplan 1shots,? Or that bright red laser?
---
Apparently "Lorem ipsum" comes from a Latin word that means " Pain itself"
---
It definitely did.
---
the only missions that are not simulations are article whassit and then technically the outbreak event
---
The fact that she fell on the drug stash is even better.
---
when is the event?
---
You can also use https://squads.tm/game-r6 and r/R6STeams to find teammates.
---
The event came out during one of the operations the operations called operation chimera. I believe it was season 2
---
Ikr
---
Sorry year 2
---
too much cateye.
---
I agree with Russian hostage bomber.
---
But it would‚Äôve been almost impossible to miss
---
You're a fucking tard for not using nightstrider there
---
I was playing as ash, the new defending op, and mute
---
Yes, legendary is 3%. I'm moreso agreeing with the idea of putting them in packs, the % I don't really care that's on Ubi.
---
There's a LOT of stuff in this game to help newer players already. They literally get 600 free renown from watching 3 videos and much more from situations.
---
They don't need anymore.
---
This shit can get realllly repetitive
---
I spent so long getting renown for attachments, then it updates, that around 10-20k I‚Äôll never get back....
---
Not needed. Ops are easy to get.
---
Be aware of your team composition. If you play mute and you have a Bandit on your team, consider the possibility that this will happen, considering it has happened enough that you've felt the need to make a Reddit post about it. You have to understand that you're more likely to get the results you want by changing your own behavior than by changing the behavior of everybody else.
---
Take steps to reduce the chances of bad outcomes happening to you. Learn to play with your team in a way that will maximize cooperation even in spite of teammates making mistakes. It takes a fraction of a second to place your jammers in a way that will ensure other players don't destroy them. 
---
I play both Bandit and Mute, my shit never gets destroyed because I take it upon myself to ensure it doesn't happen. If I'm playing Bandit and there's a jammer on the wall I'm gonna trick I shoot that shit because it's in the way, simple as that.

Who remebers no extended barrel

Fun Fact: on Terrorist hunt disarm bomb, if your placement with them is just right, **there is nothing stopping you from clearing out the enemys and placing an unholy magnitude of claymores in the bomb sites and sitting in a different corner of the map and bet with your friends on who gets more claymore kills**.
---
Yea I bet
---
A nice goodbye 
---
You will be missed, fellow Sieger.
---
Red dot against bots on ticktock recorded using a screen recorder.  What a trip.
---
I have seen a version where there are actual operators on both sides instead of unknown operators
---
Which country is he/she from?
---
They refunded for jager and bandit‚Äôs acogs. They did not refund anything when all attachments became free! They made a post stating so when they did it
---
I would have missed, and yes, that would have been foiled
---
Yeah uno servers aren‚Äôt slow
---
I disagree. Just because he is faster doesnt make him all that better. If you want to deny smoke plant, you can use c4, maestro, echo, etc. And it is so much more effective. Warden, you have to actually stand still and stare at the smoke. It's too risky. Maybe it works at lower level casual play but as someone attempting to compete in challenger league, higher level play he falls through.
---
I play secure area solely when on casual, fellow operator.
---
If it was someone else, I apologize. someone claimed to have the same problem so I told him to post on reddit
---
Greece
---
Sledge has a skin
---
Lmao fair enough ya ubi is garbo sometimes especially now that it's one game to each server rather then it seems to take ridiculously long load sometimes
---
Ive had it happen once before
---
Click on the bundles button in the bottom of the shop tab
---
Yeah but not really a sledge kind of guy. But still I bet you were happy that your main got a skin
---
I only use the LMG on IQ only because I have black ice for it
---
Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
---
That's the one I got on by bought pack I hate it
---
i've verified and restarted and none have worked
---
at this point i'm just going to uninstall/reinstall the game
---
The DLC had such good characters.
---
Shame the level design sucked. They suddenly added more verticality, and it made navigating mid-chase incredibly annoying. I had to google where to go, or get stuck looking for ages, at least three times in it's super short length. Never had any issues with the main game.
---
peasant
---
Bitch please its a joke.
---
Paying around 250 renow isnt that much
---
No, that is far from what it proves. In fact, it proves nothing other than the fact that ubi is good at making fun events. The same thing was said for magic, Halloween 2018, wild west, and will continue to be said for every event and the answer is always the same: what's the guarantee that you'll consistently, reliably find players 3 or 4 or even 6 months that down the line?
---
"**It's like looking in a mirror.**"
---
Btw windbastion was when I started to get serious abt ranked and be sweaty which is why there is a jump but I only just got to plat 1 this season so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm cheating to get my ranks.
---
I must know
---
Yeah and how he says he didnt do it but the evidence points toward him.
---
What system do you play on?
---
Exactly
---
Yeah I get that. I only knew where to go because I had watched Markiplier play it a few years before playing it myself
---
If your struggling with maps, I would recommend just running through t-hunts to learn maps
---
Filthy acts done at a reasonable price
---
What is there to not understand? Skins are literally just cosmetic changes you get randomly.
---
I shouldn't HAVE to lock my door, I shouldn't HAVE to look both ways before crossing the street, I shouldn't HAVE to drive defensively; you can spend as much time being upset about other people as you want, but it's extremely unlikely to change. The best way to achieve inner peace and lower your blood pressure is to take initiative and make choices that reduce your exposure to other peoples' negative behavior. 
---
At the end of the day, we're talking about taking 1 step back when you place your jammers if you have another anti-breacher on your team, it's just as simple and easy as what you're asking Bandit players to do. Just use your eyes bro, check out who your teammates are playing and change how you use your gadget to compensate :P
---
The mp7? Why on Earth would you buff the mp7?
---
Petition to give acog to ass-gun(?)
---
What about the ACOGs on the SMG 11?
---
Thanks ive got the 4 basic maps all in my head but i still need to learn some.
---
I have gotten 2 black ice. One was for the S.A.S pistol. And the other was a duplicate for the S.A.S pistol, I‚Äôm lvl 110 as well :(
---
Imagine
---
This is why i've quit playing online for a while cause of ping spikes like this
---
Please don't be mad about this... it's my first black ice and I'm level 58
---
Flair checks out
---
Couldn't work, no one can live with killing a dog, just basic facts
---
Noooooo!!!!!!! I have had 51 commons or u commons in a row, without a rare or epic in sight
---
Hmm, so with a higher fov the crosshairs are smaller as well as the enemy. That would make your hipfire feel better because you have a smaller crosshair but its not actually better because the enemies are also smaller?
---
I‚Äôm mad about this
---
Alibi:
---
*lemme in* *LEMME INNN*
---
My extremely unpopular opinion is only dmrs and slug shottys need acogs , ash is the perfect example of a gun can still be good without an acog
---
You could get an ace and get 650 points
---
She was clueless lol. Could‚Äôve knifed her
---
Basically, the feeling of higher accuracy may just be a placebo of your FOV settings
---
Who could kill best girl?
