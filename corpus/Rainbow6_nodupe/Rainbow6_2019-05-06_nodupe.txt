It was a lot more one dimensional, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I do now.  The "cheese strats" consisted of putting deployable shields down with bandit batteries and tap-shooting with the shield operators.  In terms of balance I'm sure it was way worse but the simplicity of it at the time was way more fun for me
---
I swear this is the buggiest season we've ever had
---
Overwatch debatably require more ‚Äúskill‚Äù but with it stupid broken Match making system,
---
Siege is just a much better game.
---
Legit why is class shooter that introduced mechanic as tank/healer/dps; don‚Äôt have a role que???
---
Every game I been into has been 1 off rank 3 dps-tard and 2 Healer with no one who play main tank which btw is also the most important role.
---
The que system is stupid and unbalance cuz the team who have a 300+ hours Rein is gonna have an easier game and a team which doesn‚Äôt.
---
So want to climb on OW?
---
Play Rein til GM ez.

Wait for the new season and don‚Äôt bomb your rank

I honestly dont think doc and Lion are fuck buddies.. I swear if ubisoft pulls the gay card on a operator like how blizzard did to soldier 76 I'm uninstalling... no offense but by bro Lion ain't in to that
---
To beat the toxicity you must become the toxicity. Find a squad that‚Äôs as toxic as you want to be then boom before you know it you‚Äôre a diamond doing run outs in casual. Then and only then, will you truly become one with the cancer.

She definitely does not. Frost is OP as is

My only issue with the game right now is leavers and peekers. I play the game casually so I always get shat on when complaining about this but nothing kills my enjoyment faster then these 2 running out to be killed by a defender with an ACOG peeking. Or losing a round and a teammate leaving. Sometimes that position doesn't get filled and you end up losing a match that you could've won if you had all 5 players. It's really infuriating.
---
What is this ‚Äúgame‚Äù called?
---
Not even a pulse main but a mobile wallpaper in such good resolution is a gem, thank you so much.
---
I am calling the cops
---
I can understand flashes over breaching chargers, but flashes over claymore?
---
Oh no üò±üò®üò∞
---
Get that all the time, the game works but working out the mean MMR of every team and tries to create the closest average it can. 
---
This could in theory least to a couple of coppers and a couple of diamonds on one team and a bunch of silvers and bronzes on the other
---
Actually 3 years 2 months or some stuff.
---
I miss flashbang fuze
---
the tactical side has increased, specially due to all the counterplay being found.
---

---
This is the thing about tactics on ANY game. You can only start to think about them when you're mechanically good enough to challenge the other player.
---
I can't really say anything else honestly. Gamesense is still ridiculously overpowered in this game.
---
Lookup mountain on google translate
---
True but remember ships are fictional and nothing but more fantasy. It won't actually happen
---
Agreed, been playing Hibana for about 100-150ish hours now and I always roll breaching charges with her just in case we don't have a soft breacher.
---
Oh yeah, but it's so unreliable, y'know? You pretty much gotta be in DDT just to use it for it's normal purpose, I already miss enough lmao
---
I remember thinking about an operator who used some sort of acid or even just a saw to destroy the metal, but idk how realistically feasible that'd be
---
Or just change Maverick to only break the metal so then you can make punch holes in the wall or help a fuze or even a breach charge

Wish it was like OW and you could stay in the lobby so you weren‚Äôt put in a search again and in a ongoing match, again. 
---
The real problem is leavers though. Leavers should lose 200 renown for leaving, there needs to a penalty people actually care about losing.
---
Also like OW, you should get a backfill bonus which should be almost as much renown/xp as a win.
---
Confirmed plat?
---
No, why?
---
Ok.
---
That's why it's labeled poor man's ace
---
Yes and 2019 is not the end value it‚Äôs 2018
---
it‚Äôs a 4k. an ace is 5 kills
---
I could tell ya, but then I‚Äôd have to kill ya
---
No u right EXCEPT THAT ONE FUCKING TIME I WAS MONTY AND I PUSHED IN ON A MOZZIE and promptly stepped on a gu mine so I backed out of the room while Finka watched the door so I could pull out the needle and MOZZIE JUST FUCKING WALKED RIGHT PASSED FINKA AND EXECUTED ME LIKE SHE WASNT EVEN THERE. I was so mad and I backseat gamed him so hard because he was honestly the absolute worst Siege player I‚Äôve ever encountered and he should sell his console because uninstalling the game just isn‚Äôt enough.

But yeah other than that, chillax it‚Äôs just a game no worries homies.

It wasn't reduced at all. It's just what easier to control due to sight misalignment
---
Normally I get to Plat 3 and quit for the season and then occasionally play with friends. This season I‚Äôve tried solo queuing more and it‚Äôs pure hell of bouncing between gold and silver. It‚Äôs insane how many players you get who don‚Äôt even know basic mechanics. I had a kid think that there were claymores on Defense and ran right into one he was starting at. I‚Äôve had games where I have 15+ kills and we still lose cause someone goes 0 kills all game and like 1 assist.

This got me thinking, what if R6 had ammo management. Like throwing basically full mags meant you no longer had whatever bullets you had left. And everyone only has a few mags to work with per round. Adds to the realism.

omfg that happened to me on several occasions it‚Äôs the most annoying thing. sometimes it also gets put on backwards, like what ??

So his ability to kill is irrelevant? If he‚Äôs annoying then it‚Äôs okay? I guess I don‚Äôt get it.

I love Finka, and ever since Lion was ruined people have played her more often which is great; it's a shame no one seems to grasp when you should and shouldn't use her surge...and that it doesn't make you invincible.

Then stop sounding like it with this whiney shit, seriously.

You clearly have zero fucking clue what you're talking about.

I always Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt &amp; I recommend you do the same.

If you‚Äôre trying to do the Maestro/ Alibi challenge, Bunk on Theme Park is the easiest room to defend.
---
Well this depends on what rank level you play at I've seen blitz wreck in anything up to mid gold and all the way down to silver 4 (as in the people playing as blitz) and any high level player can wreck as him against lower ranked players. Higher level players can deal with him more easily. Was his ability overpowered not obscenely, but in the right hands he is frustrating to counter against someone who simply knows to use the flash and pace between crouching and running. So yeah a nerf will help to balance him out, I don't know what other way you suggest to fix that kind of issue. I personally haven't found him too hard to deal with but I can understand the frustration to an extent. Remember the devs are people too and have to make calls based on feedback. They don't always make the right call.
---
You haven‚Äôt given any clear evidence or thought lol. You are just smack talking.
---
I wish they would bring this mode back from time to time :(
---
It was really good!
---
Says the fuze main...
---
Lion isnt ruined he just isnt broken anymore he is still one of my top 3 attackers
---
OMFG. I just feel that!!
---
You make a lot of sense (thanks for not being a dick). When I get to platinum, I get wrecked. Then I go to gold and wreck others. With the nerf it just makes it worse. I do see your point tho.
---
That‚Äôs why you pair it with mute jammers, or other optional team gadgets like castle or clash
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Blitz is difficult to deal with when in the Ranked ladder due to the complete and utter lack of teamwork in 99% of games and lack of comms makes it extremely difficult to anticipate him rushing into a room and knifing you before you have time to realize a Blitz is in the room and have to aim for *nowhere* unless the knife animation starts. The flash adds to the frustration especially if you are alone. In the lower ranks, in most games your other team mates are off doing their own thing so they can't really come to aid you as Blitz rushes in. You're constantly using data from the top percent saying people don't pick him and how he can't 1 v 2 but how most ops cant as well when if you have a rifle it is very easy to 1 v 2 or even 1 v 5 if you're good enough and can click heads with a good fire rate, mag size, and an acog, stuff Blitz's pistol doesn't have.

Stop being retarded and wasting my fucking time. Go back to copper.

ive got the hatch thing once in a regular casual match. didnt think it was more frequent but yeah its really annoying
---
one for cav maybe?
---
I feel bad for Ying too, but anyway, I‚Äôm on the minority obviously, and you do make a point. It‚Äôs about the overall fun of the game.
---
This is pretty basic game design 101.   
---
You record all possible voice/scenarios to prevent awkward situations where recalling the voice actors becomes a necessity. It's basic planning ahead. The more voice lines you record, even with the full knowledge that you do not intend to use them now, means that should there be a change in the future; you are not shit out of luck. Better safe than sorry.  
---
Should a change arise in such a fashion that a Voice Actor cannot be recalled or is not available, and the games design has changed in such a way that, for the sake of this argument, an attacker became a defender; The lines are already in your file bank. You don't have to ship a VA half way across the world to record 1 afternoon's worth of new dialogue. Cuts down on time wasted and overall costs.

The biggest problem I‚Äôve ever seen with laser sight is when a person is holding a door, anyone going up to the door can see the laser sight on the door frame (if they place it there which 99% of people holding an angle on the door do) and so you can get info from that, but laser sight against people roaming (both attacker and defender) it‚Äôs pretty much pointless since by the time you see it they should be in your view, so if you love holding door angles maybe not but if you love roaming or doing anything but holding doors constantly then I‚Äôd recommend it (although i don‚Äôt use it because if youre relying on hip firing to kill someone they are way too close and that situation shouldn‚Äôt have happened)

I would take Zofia. She has great weapons, her gadget is potentially lethal and you can equip claymores. On top of that, when downed, you can withstand, but in my experience, you can survive a lot of encounters that you shouldn't have with other ops

I'm glad you have a basic understanding of how calender months work

What exactly was he doing?

Lol no one can hack you. Silly that you tked someone twice in ranked though instead of just muting him.
---
Why aren't you replying to the original OP for stealing his post?
---
Attacker and defender role swap is the amount of rounds before swapping sides
---
Overtime role change is changing sides during overtime
---
Attacker unique spawn allows attackers to spawn seperate from eachother
---
Damage handicap is either changing how much damage you do or your total health. i cant remember
---
Injured 0-20 is what health an enemy needs to get shot down too to get downed
---
And the last thing makes it so defenders can reuse an objective they've won in
---
At that time, licensed devices weren't working.
---
His statement was about their stance on MnK, and he said that console should be played with a controller.
---
Here's the tweet:
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/ubisoftsupport/status/1016754176230068225?lang=en

It says "native kbm isn't supported".
---
I can't find the post where ESL said mnk is cheating. They either removed it, or I am searching wrong. I'll accept defeat for now. If and when I find the original post, I'll make a new post about it.
---
Attacker/Defender Role Swap Off/1-10
---
How many rounds you play before you swap sides 
---
For example set it to 2 and you play 2 rounds attack before you swap to defence
---
Objective rotation parameter Off/1-10
---
How many rounds you play till you can replay a objective you already won before
---
Overtime role change Off/1/2
---
How many times you swap sides during overtime
---
Attacker Unique Respawn
---
On is the same as ranked spawn
---
Damage handicap 25-200
---
Heath
---
Injured 0-20
---
How much health you get when you are downed (as in when you‚Äôre injured not when you are revived )
---
Objective type rotation Rounds Player/Won
---
Unsure about this, don‚Äôt recall theres such setting
---
It is.
---
Because now the ESL mode will only have those who follow PL, which isn't as much as the others who play ranked. That is definitely hurting the PB, since that is the future ubi wants but can't implement because queue times would be sky rocketing.
---
45 million accounts might seem big, but it really isn't when you already have 2 modes. Adding a 3rd is worse.
---
I did this exact same thing on fortress. Was standing on the stair case that‚Äôs pretty much in the center of the map when one of the German defenders covered the obj door. I crouched so I could be covered by the shield and railing wall. We just stared at each other for two seconds before I had the idea to fire off a few warning shots. First shot one tapped him.
---
Matchmaking map preference will only affect TH. The Matchmaking for multiplayer is done via the casual and ranked map pool going forward. There has been no communication on any changes to this system.
---
This feels too trueüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
For some reason he popped in and was basically telling everybody to go fuck themselves, and anyone who got killed he started bitching, which led to even more killed since no one could focus, then he kept shooting people but not killing them, mans did every annoying thing in the game, so i shot him. Dude was in dead last too, probably why he was so mad
---
Brilliant, cheers, been a great help.
---
Thank you for help!
---
Huh, I've always thought Ela was one of the better ones.
---
In an ideal scenario, 5v1 is a guaranteed loss. Even if 3 idiots on his team did something idiotic , 2 would be sensible enough to win. I've clutched many 1vXs myself, but all because of the enemy's bad crossfire or bad communication.
---
Given the site, which is easy to cover, defense should have won even if 2 or even 3 players had gone to sleep.
---
What Op did was undoubtedly toxic. Especially considering it is a 1v5 casual. 1v3 as well, a warning shot would have sufficed. Bandit's gun can down a player if shot in the leg thrice. That would have been enough to indicate no revival.

You can change which maps you want to play on in  the matchmaking settings, if you wanted to remove themepark from your matchmaking all you have to do is turn the map off in matchmaking settings.

Love how she was never even overpowered and they still took em
---
How in any way is this related to siege?
---
98% of them.
---
Rook? Anchor? You mean the main runout boi.
---
Hell yeah we do
---
The real hero of rainbow six siege.
---
Congrats dad
---
Ah, obviously they're referring to kaid.
---
What are you talking about no strats, there were a fuck ton of strats to learn when Lion came out. 
---
Lion, Dokkaebi, and Jackal is one. Any post-plant situation with Lion alive and have an EE-ONE-D is one. 
---
Lion was op because of wall hacks, they took it away and boom he suddenly not as good.
---
Diamond lobbies are so small its its really hard to match them evenly if there solo queuing.  Or running with golds .
---
Fair play
---
I still can't forget how I got kicked out of csgo while clutching against several people. Dumbasses didn't understand that covering bomb was more important than running and gunning.
---
People are stupid. Deal with it.

Rainbow 6 siege's april fools update

Assault

Super old repost
---
An Echo*
---
1. No text chat 
---
2. Nobody has a mic an if they do they don‚Äôt use it
---
3. Nobody plays seriously, they‚Äôre all in bed playing on TV audio half the room away.
---
4. You have to use a controller.
---
MnK gives such a huge advantage.

Thanks brother

Hello LessHamster, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/blads6/me_killing_acez_from_fnatic_twice/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Nah, his shield doesnt need any change.
---
She is a three speed with solid guns and hard counters echo, lesion, and valk. She absolutely is still relevant when as she denies the enemy the ability to keep gathering intel and can easily prevent a lesion mine or echo blast from stopping a plant.
---
OK so if you don't think they are strong, you wound suggest a re work, rather than a nerf? Because just straight up making the shields not bulletproof - which is the core aspect of any shield carrier, is a straight nerf. So I just think, something else would have to be done to actually re work any of this
---
Oh i don‚Äôt think so
---
It‚Äôs too inconsistent I feel.
---
Oh I‚Äôm well aware of that. The idea is more to move a round along and make a change that could flip the meta. Say it‚Äôs a 1v1 against a Monty. He backs into a corner, you‚Äôve got no impacts, no way of killing him without getting in his strike zone, it would be a way to close the round out or make a Monty try for something instead of just dragging it out. I understand his front plate is quite large, but it would require the time and spray control to bust. As one person mentioned, it would only take a few seconds. So I‚Äôd say maybe 600-1000 health if that‚Äôs the case. Make it at least a mag or two of bullets that need to hit right in the front plate to actually do something. Kind of like Tachanka‚Äôs shield. Or as I put, maybe make it so Tachanka can blast through the shield or faceplates.
---
But you really don't see a lot of people picking her do you? Maybe in higher ranks, for me she is almost always free
---
I think even after the Nerf he is pretty good operator and Strong if you know how to play him
---
Great post üëç
---
Thank you!
---
The m762 is a solid gun, with an acog and compensator, and also it works well with a suppressor and reflex. Her LMG-E can be used to spray and has good damage, also having 150 rounds (the largest magazine in the game) is really useful when you don‚Äôt want to reload
---
Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre doing - even at the very very bottom it still does it
---
"Make it hard for the enemy to get in, and you can't get out"

He was nerfed?

Do you know what a year is? 12 months or 365 days. As my memory serves me right, I think only 4 months and a week have passe since the end of 2018.
---
Rainbow 6 Siege was released at December 2015, the 12th month, basically the end of the year, so let's move it by month to make it 2016 for rounding purpose and for your small brain to understand.
---
Now since we moved the game by 1 month, let's move the current date by 1 month. CLEARLY we're still in freaking 2019 and not 2020 , right? So if my math will be almost Right, it should be 3 years and 5 months if we calculate it via my way.
---
So how hard it is to understand that 4 years haven't passed, end of 2015 to middle of 2019 doesn't count as 4 , more like 3.5.
---
Did you even finish school?

She was overpowered with nades. She literally had no downside. Why wouldn‚Äôt you bring IQ when she had nades?
---
Hey that‚Äôs accurate but happy mic day man!

Jager Himself wants to monetize his channel but couldn't because the majority of his content featured copyrighted music. He deleted the majority of these videos and wants people to donate/pay him a salary until he can monetize his channel but most likely also well into the future.

I think he‚Äôs talking about if his teammates are behind him.
---
Yes

---
TL;DR/W: The SuperNova is the slowest firing shotgun in the game and barely does more damage than the M590A1.
---
Capitao also has a different sight
---
I‚Äôve known someone to do it. It‚Äôs stupid I agree, however I could see someone doing it on purpose to get fake internet points. Not to mention look closely and you‚Äôll see the spark destruction of the drone.
---
This is more of a personal preference than which is the better
---
you cant get games... ive waited for up to 30mins and nothing. and thats at peak times
---
Pop, pop and pop.
---
They're pissed your doing better than them, also, happy cake day.
---
Unless you‚Äôre fucking around it really doesn‚Äôt need to be reloaded at all.
---
Do j√§ger!!
---
Huh never knew my drawings will get noticed.
---
Lion never stopped being a brutal attacker. He's still so obnoxiously hard to deal with when the enemy team coordinates a push with hin.
---
I've had a 1v4 clutch as Tei5ch on chalet when they were trophy/kitchen and had a lesion.
---
Oh boi my bad i didnt know it was yours
---
Can I see your 180¬∞ flick?
---
Twitch*
---
He's talking about BB not Monty, Blitz or Fuze. No one should be trying to shoot around BB like he is one of those three shield operators, unintentionally or not bullets from anyone should break his shield.
---
But it never happens
---
Yeah Ying was in a weird spot. Weak at the lower levels, incredibly strong at the higher levels. I‚Äôve single handedly took over a sight by myself with her.
---
Thanks mate
---
Thanks
---
It's ok I don't mind. I actually like it that people are sharing it tbh. 
---
I should invest in a watermark though xD
---
Yes, that was a nice flick. But c'mon, this was a weak clutch.

True XD

what is mic day?
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
The fact buck gets nades is crazy to me. Honestly, he's already an upgrade to sledge because he can blow open floors from underneath or above. Plus he can run both shotgun and assault rifle if your into that kind of thing for some reason.
---
Objectively, yes, but in feel, also yes. Still use it because you can't potato aim a pocket sand attack
---
AR 15.5 or M4?
---
Its arguably the cabinet.
---
Considering you're a Tachanka main I can see why
---
Yust try harder than they do
---
Just means they are the OP. :)
---
On Neptune there's 16h a day which is fairly close
---
Can we get an F for that recruit
---
It‚Äôs a bug since grim sky, half the time your mic breaks and you can‚Äôt hear teammates. Even worse, sometimes it‚Äôs the first game so you can‚Äôt even restart after every match
---
This the kinda music someone who plays on 4:3 would listen to
---
See that's the issue though, the Bearing used to be so damn good that it's impossible for me to hold it and *not* expect it to play well. I've been conditioned to hitting heads over 20m with it, so now that it kicks like a bronco I just have to put it down.

Pro league is a select few people. They can atleast have separate balancing for them. Especially with the amount of money they‚Äôve got to be making off of it.
---
Mira is borderline mustpick on a lot of sites across most maps. Combined with her gun which is amazing in 1 v 1 duels she's a pretty fun op to play but she's pretty much a hard anchor on site and her gun chews through ammo quickly so 2 v 1 is more of an issue for her.
---
Literally special ed
---
Uhhhhh 7?
---
First time playing a ubi game?
---
I thought they we were getting fixed shields last release.. wtf
---
I pray you're wrong.....
---
The waffle. It looks like a "real" charm and not just a streamer's icon
---
Shi sha!!
---
Mira is more desirable. Zofia is a strong attacker but Mira is a game changer as long as her mirrors are up and she has a nitro with a good gun. But id say honestly just getting the y2 bundle is better than grinding them all out
---
When people can't fucking see you made a mistake... Multiplayer games community in a nutshell
---
sledge &gt; buck; you saying about AR; i say about fucking smg11; sledge is more universal cause buck needs 2-3 shoots to open a wall or something; buck is situational, for example for destroying miras on border and that  makes him look much better to sledge but sledge still can open it with grenade from underneath; sledge is better pick for me soloq king
---
it's about reflexes too right like apex legends and call of duty? watching people play siege it seems that way.
---
The timing is perfect, too.
---
Oooh para bellum gameplay. God I miss the recoil
---
I mean, when did you stop playing
---
This. Have been experiencing this a fair bit the last few games. Someone tries to either get an unexpected spawnpeek, or ~~roams~~ lurks on the other side of the map and won't come back until they're either last or second last alive. They also do this without reinforcing at all, so vital walls and hatches aren't touched.
---
Communication is a great tool of ultimate power. If used correctly, you'll be unstoppable.
---
TL;DR - They should communicate their intentions, though you yourself should also let them know that you're going to the window that they're at. A simple "Hey Jackle, I'm going to breach charge that window" would do.
---
Yep.
---
I just don't bother with Siege anymore, much easier to pick up a game like Unreal Championship or CS GO and just play. 
---
With Siege I have to be aware of what the new operators do, what the current meta is and which bugs are in rotation at the given time. Then of course there's also the Ubisoft servers, but that's a different discussion bon it's own I feel.
---
I understand your point about the stairs. I think the map lended itself well to defenders though. Shotguns and SMG's were powerful. Not like a map like Clubhouse where long range is favored.
---
:)
---
No that may be too strong, because that also implies she can have her primary out, which means anyone that plays echo, vigil, pulse, lesion are going to have way less fun getting wall/floor banged(except lesion)
---
Are your temps good? It is a laptop afterall
---
I feel like somebody needs to repost the 1 hit vault video again....
---
Yeaaaaa but on the flip side you don't want to over encumber the comms, but yes the solution is to communicate that my teammate is an idiot who tks me b/c he is an idiot, but he's my idiot and the game is more fun this way
---
It probably did. 60% chance that jackal was killed every round after, cause "You shot me!".
---
you're color blind because Australia is pink you might wanna get tested.
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
Ying should definitely bring breach charges.
---
No it takes 2 impacts BEHIND her shield to down her
---
M870 all the way, something about the crunchy feeling of blasting someone from point blank range into oblivion. Yummy
---
Classic! 
---
been doing that for months.
---
works most of the time... or maybe on bronze to gold rank only??? hahaha
---
I mean, if y'all are fuckin around then that's one thing. Laughing and having fun isn't bad. Though if you're going for "tactical realism" then communication definitely.
---
oh yeah gridlock, as she is not yet allowed to be played competitively I completly forgot she exists. And Buck is "sort of" pocket shotgun but well... thats his main gadget so I would not put it in that category.
---
I'm not saying I couldn't be playing better, but I don't like the idea of defenders having acog, as well as defenders being able to run out. At the least they should be revealed immediately.
---
Just get standard, they've reverted unlocking operators back to the old way so it's 500 points for the first one and an additional 500 points added per operator (e.g. 500, 1000, 1500, and finally 2000) under the same unit. Yearly operators range from 12500-25000 but you can get a whole years worth of operators for $20 if you don't want to grind.
---
I played around with it for an hour the other day and with the irons have a peculiar quirk. 
---
The first bullet hits where the irons go. And the two taller tangs to the side? The second bullet almost always hits the invisible line between those. 
---
I‚Äôve resorted to just using that to aim for close to slightly further range encounters
---
I'm hoping it didn't just b/c the timing was so perfectly comedic where he sits there and looks at the dead twitch and the door. I mean if my friend accidentally shot gunned me and then another person I too would prolly shoot him before he can accidentally do more
---
Well it wouldn‚Äôt be much fun if he put down metal explosion proof barriers. Especially on say, Oregon or House Garage
---
I would love to get a team together and set up plays for maps but the game is relaxing drink with friends time for some in my group. I'm cool with it cause games r spose to be fun, but would be fun to try it seriously
---
*cries in Minecraft enchanting book
---
He looks like the happy merchant XD but really it's way better than anything I could ever do lol
---
You don‚Äôt get OG ops free now (from 12th feb to be exact)
---
When the mission fails so hard that they give you a brazil themed message
---
The only thing i dont like about casual is when you're thrown into an ongoing game. I wish they would make it so if you hit "Start another game" in the end screen you will always start a new lobby for the next match. That would also cut down on players leaving mid match
---
no, no, it was a bit of an exaggeration. i can see it's pink, i just meant it's another shade of red, whereas a shade of purple or bright green would bring a little more variety
---
Shoot the fuze charge with the pmm to super charge it before u set it off
---
I'd recommend the R6 community discord. You'll find some dope people who play seriously and are chill. I agree 100% that this game is a great "take a shot when ___" game. Even got blackout drunk playing that game üëÄ
---
Also only seems to show up when i need to reload.
---
But you're an Ash Main \*Shifts eyes dis trustingly\*
---
I bring breach charge on any op I Wana do vertical play with. If u know the map well enough u don't need a buck/sledge to break floor. Particularly nice with nomad since she can cover her own flanks really well
---
Didnt know people used the nova outside of console
---
God no. The bouncy 20 round mag rifle kills me enough as it is
---
To be fair you have to enable those to popup.
---
I'm the Twitch in this clip. The Gridlock actually got kicked because he had killed OP during a Cav interrogation the previous round. So he payed for his rage  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Fun tastic
---
I did the same for a while, in particular because of the SAT I mostly play Hibana and you can live without the Bearing on her. 
---
Yet, after some time I picked it up again and started having some sweet success. 
---
At more than 8/9m I won't even try using it for headshots, but aiming at mass centre still does the trick, and in CQC it's such a useful thing that now I can't go back. It's not the godly gun that it was once but you can still use it effectively on certain roles. 
---
Yet, it's depressing that the best secondary SMG became the worst. 
---
A good nerf for Hibana tho. Next time I see someone asking for more nerfs on her I will goddamn for them to experience the same things I did (Hibana main from a lot of time).
---
Ewww stretched res
---
Bruh hes a meme chill out
---
That sucks nuts
---
Hey man it happens sometimes, i got to silver 1 but somedays my gamesense is trash and I play like a copper 4
---
well lion is from year 4 so ubi will get to it as they work their way up
---
No I totally agree. But you know how hard it is to watch 3 dudes chasing one drone and emptying their entire clip into it.
---
I never, ever, **ever** play bomb (unless I'm playing with a friend because it's the only mode he plays) because you only get an audio cue essentially when it's too late, unlike Secure Area. I don't play with headphones so the audio cue from secure area makes it so I'm not at a total disadvantage.
---
That's why they nerfed it. It's a close range smg rather than a pocket rifle now
---
*notices your roaming* OwO what's this?
---
Done. Now I have to wait... XD
---
As someone who has consistently died to Clash no matter how many bullets and grenades I throw at her, I support this statement
---
Yeah I was going to say smokes are amazing for pulling off plants or just blinding off sights. Different playstyles for different people I guess.
---
Well now that's different
---
*notices the sound of your gun reloading* UwU flashes you
---
I think I just moaned
---
There is no difference between Gold 1 and Copper 4. I would know. I‚Äôm both.
---
Monty ain‚Äôt a meme when you need to defuse and he‚Äôs staring you down while Guerrilla Taped onto an adjacent wall
---
He's balanced and if he isn't he certainly isn't overpowered. He doesn't need a nerf at all.
---
His names iron golem ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
cease
---
Where did you find it?
---
Looks like she was given the wrong directions
---
This happens so much, almost every time I prefire a doorway or window I end up tking some idiot teammate that decided he really needed to run past me and couldn‚Äôt just go behind me
---
ah ah next time use knife, more risky but less dangerous to unlucky teammates
---
I think it‚Äôs interesting how just practicing gun safety could step some people‚Äôs game up. They shouldn‚Äôt be walking 6 inches in front of the barrel of a shotgun pointed right at the doorway
---
That Gridlock was clearly Iron
---
Where do I get this
---
Didnt they do this on bank in proleague
---
This is why I play ranked with a squad. I‚Äôll have a significantly less chance of deranking if I‚Äôm in a team of people with full communication that I‚Äôm comfortable with instead of 4 random strangers.
---
I fear for this community if they go to a gun range
---
Please explain how to defuse post plant in a 1v1 with Monty?? This is the issue, there is such little counterplay to this as he can stay fully protected just watching the defuser
---
Did u message them saying it was a accident
---
I got spawn peeked on my fist ranked game and they get this?! Reality is often disappointing.
---
The amount of kicks my friend has received for this reason
---
gridlock you fucking retard
---
I think both the AUG and TCSG12 are equally competitive, props to Ubisoft for making such an awkward ACOG distribution. 
---
Most of the time, the shotgun is just inferior to its SMG counterpart due to shotgun's range limitation and angle holding capability.
---
Projection much ?
---
I agree sooo much. I played the closed beta / alpha, but didnt buy the game until this last January. (So i still have the beta exclusive flame skin on most of my weapons) I'm level 55 or something. Some kid fucking ripped at me for not playing as well, despite "playing since the beta". I'm in bronze 3. What do you expect. I'm doing my best to learn.
---
 I've concluded I just cant play this game when high schoolers get out of school. (ESPECIALLY Friday nights) They're just soooo toxic.
---
This is why you don‚Äôt fortify the walls on bomb so you can have an angle to kill him from, it‚Äôs not that hard to kill him
---
Overall I think he‚Äôs ok in terms of balance but there are situations where a change is needed. Similar to Maverick whereby overall I think he‚Äôs ok in terms of balance until he‚Äôs on a wall with his torch and your a couple of feet away and he kills you as you can‚Äôt hear it. It isn‚Äôt balanced in them situation
---
you should always open barricades with guns as it is safer than melee

Deadass this happened to me not long ago. 
---
I was on Fortress and I spawned in Stable. I looked up and tried to shoot the roof cam and I fired A SINGLE BULLET and Hibana walks in front of me and takes the headshot. I got instantly TK'd by Jackal before I could explain myself.
---
and OP didnt learn from the accident
---
from 5v5 to 5v2(assuming gridlock got banned) so quickly lol
---
#makeiqgreatagain
---
You got killed
---
Did he just rhyme pressure with Tesla?
---
Depends on what you mean by "hack me" if he some how gets your ip then he can boot you off but other than that not really
---
Yup, shooting it definitely feels like the right move, but the shotgun is an interesting choice. If you are already that close, why not toss a drone? Or even just melee it?
---
So you don‚Äôt reinforce site. Right. Great counter. I‚Äôll keep that in mind. 
---
Not trying to belittle you but that is a nonsense argument
---
Why the second account?
---
That's exactly why you pick him! If you get into that position, well done! You deserve to win the round. And you could still try to bait him or find a way to kill him.
---
Hunter sounds useless and retarded and I think mimic should be called decoy
---
knife is better because its quieter too. that person's entry will get him killed anyways
---
You should reinforce between sites anyways, if he‚Äôs really that much of an issue just pick smonk my guy
---
Then who‚Äôs work is it
---
I actually have fun with it a lot

This is my first season playing ranked. Got to Silver 2 after placements, made my way up to Gold 4, fell to Bronze 3, now im back at gold 4.
---
If you don't really like support ops I wouldn't recommend her however if you do I'd say goodbye for it.
---
Working on it, I‚Äôll be editing the post as soon as I find it so I can give credit.

No he wasnt... Lion and Finka were year 3 season 1...
---
New skin?
---
Git Gud
---
How do you know it‚Äôs safe? Did you drone, if you did go ahead but your teammates probably didn‚Äôt
---
If I run between someone and a door, any damage I take is assumed to be accidental. Doubly so if you saw someone else do the same and died for it.
---
Stupid alpha
---
I never get why people are stupid enough to run in front of other players.
---
Like it doesn't take much sense to run behind.
---
I played PC FPS games throughout the 90/00's - my interests moved into the living room and bedroom. You'll see the light one day, champ.
---
Usually they shoot me and say ‚Äúwhat are you gonna do shoot back?‚Äù And I do and they then proceed to call me bad even when I clutch an ace which rarely happens
---
I used her grenades to get hard to reach Mute jammers, Grzmot mines and evil eyes
---
you say little things matter yet you don‚Äôt understand that what he did was highly ineffective? and that there is very specific angles where people would be peaking in that room, the person in the video did nothing to check those angles. he mindlessly shot with a shotgun into the barricade while standing dead center infront of it, if there was someone waiting there, he wouldve died.  and if you play rainbow enough youll get a point where youll hear them walk to the door long before youll ever see their feet. if your going to open a barricade, open it with your rifle from a distance.
---
I‚Äôm downvoting because of the owo on blitz‚Äôs back
---
when are the finals
---
All gaming communities are fairly toxic, and let's say Johnny does nothing but be toxic in real life, eventually someone's going to do something about it... There is no real  punishment for toxic behavior.
---
When you call someone a copper I have no doubt that you‚Äôre no higher than silver.
---
Well between that and people leaving after they died on first round in Ranked, the game is a pure pleasure at the moment...
---
Could you pass the aloe Vera it seems the natural light next to my computer gives me a tan, XD
---
I love the way he crouches all over the map, with the attitude "time pressure is for noobs, i am da boss here" :D
---
Every time I rush someone as blitz I look in there eyes and can she there childhood flash before them
---
credit the artist for fuck's sake
---
yea, i used to play iq just about every attacking round but can't seem to get enough out of her without nades anymore. like cool, i can see electronics, but i can't do a fucking thing about them half the time
---
 the Jager elite one maybe?
---
Hahaha will do
---
End of this month
---
Yeah believe so, this was done a few months ago as well
---
Bronze-gold in there natural habitat
---
Then what‚Äôs your nightmare?
---
Welxome to the pits of hell (casual),  where players are supposed to have fun.
---
Owo in the back of blitz
---
I will gladly fight Blitz while roaming because I can either create some distance to shoot him or just run off. A blitz that is suddenly on site 20 seconds in to the round and about to pin me in corner to bash my head in is the real nightmare.
---
The first rank is always wayyyyy too high. I got silver 1 then got slammed down to copper 3 and now im almost out of bronze again. 
---
&gt;My first rank put me at gold 3, and trust me, I'm definitely no gold 3.
---
Buy the standard and buy y1&amp;y2 bundle for 35 bugs that‚Äôs much cheaper
---
Don't shoot open doorways with shotgun. Anyone who does that is a fucking bot
---
Use your AR at long range to open it, or get close enough to hit it. Using a shotgun is a waste because you're already close enough to hit it and it's slow as fuck
---
Isn‚Äôt that amazing. The ability to destroy almost all defender abilities without having to coordinate with others like a thatcher to twitch? Amazing and proves my point. Also you had the options of being a heavy fragger. Imagine nading the ceiling which spotting echo.  She don‚Äôt need nades and they are probably never coming back.
---
It really do be like that sometimes tho
---
That's not where the shotgun comes in
---
The shotgun allows you to grab smokes while still having breaching utility, plus both his primaries are so deadly and have such fast reloads you should never have to use a pistol
---
Idk man you're talking to the same guy who tried to tk this teamkilling troll but ended up headshotting the guy behind him
---
New hereford is shit. Idc if the old one is unbalanced Id rather have that one.
---
I never said (I don‚Äôt think) that‚Äôs there is overall zero counterplay to Monty overall, I even said that ops like lesion, Ela etc are decent counters. 
---
I‚Äôm saying in post plant for Monty, he wins that battle 80% of the time. That‚Äôs wrong. What can you do if he‚Äôs playing against a wall or keeps winning the joust in a post plant?? Literally nothing, especially if you an operator with no equipment to help. 
---
This is what Nomad had (and still has in my opinion), what Lion had, what Clash had. They were all very oppressive and provided little counterplay when used by even a half decent player in the right situations.
---
Rip to thermite grenades too.....
---
I suppose it depends on rank as well. But from my experience on console, there's definitely less brain
---
And yes, I'm primarily PS4
---
Because bot
---
No experienced player would open a barricaded door with a shotgun
---
Can confirm. My best Blitz kill was when I hip fired him after being blinded by the shield
---
Ye this usually happens with old school stuff. They‚Äôre forgotten about and a few seasons later someone does it and it‚Äôs deemed as ‚Äúnew‚Äù. But it‚Äôs just that they weren‚Äôt around for when it was used before so it‚Äôs whatever. Old school tricks still work so it‚Äôs cool
---
I dont know about that. There are so many trolls and smurfs in copper 4 i honest to god do worse there than when I'm back at bronze.
---
It was even registering the hits without splatter
---
Please do that's awesome
---
Oh, I meant the Remington 870! I'm not well versed in guns, so I mixed them up (its stupid, I know). Thanks for bringing this to my attention, I would never have realized this otherwise.
---
Blitz found vigil cause he's too t h i c c and his butt cheeks keep clapping when he roams
---
What does that even mean?
---
You shot him for ‚âà15 damage, for that you must die
---
I upvoted but you sure it‚Äôs not clash spazzing out?  She has anger issues. Always screaming and shit.
---
And I‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôre judging these operators, either by their gadget or their weapons
---
During gameplay? I haven't seen that when actually shooting at shields, only in killcams does the shields act out. If that's true then I'm not surprised :/
---
Thanks, I'll just quit before Caveira touches me.
---
That's only if Cav is in the animation already. If ppl leave when they're just downed she can't get it, which is unfortunate.
---
The interrogation doesn't go through because she did not get to the player. It is still a bitch move.
---
It‚Äôs easy to counter tho just don‚Äôt sprint out of spawn or take another route
---
Right before it starts yes but the moment it starts it doesn‚Äôt matter
---
You have to be seen to be shot..

I am doing a Thatcher cosplay rn and I want to do his Trons mask I am going to try to make it out of foam if u want it's probably a cheaper and better way to do it as u can Coustemize it
---
Exactly the animation needs to start for this to happen
---
True, guns are overrated, real men use knives for everything
---
lmao i realize how stupid it is and im not arguing about the tk, more just how its not very effective to use a shotgun to open a barricade, especially in this situation
---
Monty is in a perfect place. I main him and I get countered all the time, as well as being a pain in the defenders' asses. The only thing that needs to change is the glitch with his 2D shield and maybe, just maybe increase his LFP recoil.

You‚Äôre just going out of your way to argue at this point. I expect people to make call outs because that is a part of the game. 
---
I don‚Äôt know about your slacking attitude, but as a nursing student, if I had a practice test available to me I would make full use of it.
---
Reinforcing, while helpful is no where near as important as call outs are. If you get a call that thermite is on yellow stairs and you kill him before he can use his gadget, then what difference does it make aside for soft breaches. 
---
if someone is going into a game expecting to lose they should probably reevaluate their mindset.
---
You have yet to offer anything besides criticism over my thinking that people should feel more inclined to let others on their team know what‚Äôs going on. If you can‚Äôt come back with something attributing to the thread/conversation please see you way out.

When people get toxic on the other team I go try hard mode on them, just to throw the toxicity back at them and when/if we win, I‚Äôll tell them I only talked shit because they did. As for teammates... I just leave and find another match, not worth the frustration or headache
---
Hey I was on the obj wall trying to be a sneaky snek
---
I hate when players get in my way, get killed and suddenly the blame is on me
---
It is normal, considering this shit happens a lot in this game, and nothing has been done about it since it became an issue in Operation Health
---
Ineffective in what way?
---
It's not just defenders holding angles that can shoot at a door, it can also be roamers who are in that area. So the safest way to enter a building for me is to shoot a barricade down.
---
The only possible critique I have for the OP is he could've checked his surroundings for nearby teammates before his first attempt at the barricade, but that's just bc I've learned from TK someone like that myself
---
it‚Äôs so annoying too cause it‚Äôs like the bare minimum to contribute your reinforcements and help insure the round is in your teams favor. and then if you ask someone to reinforce something on mic you‚Äôre met with silence 99% of the time....

the way the ranking system works is this: you play 10 ranked games and those are what are called your ‚Äúplacement matches‚Äù. Depending on how many games you win or lose, the game will place you accordingly. i believe the lowest rank you can get placed is copper, the highest being somewhere around plat 3

ah lesion you sneaky fucker
---
Thank you üíï
---
I find a lot of your rankings odd.
---
A few of the bigger misses--
---
Jaeger is arguably S-tier (vital and unique gadget, great gun).
---
Finka's way too high.  I really see no point to her unless you are running rush strats.
---
Kapkan and Fuze are both too high.  I'd probably put Kapkan as a lower C-tier op.  His traps are too visible.  Unless players are careless or have to rush it brings little.  And while he has a solid gun, it's nothing special.  Fuze is borderline D-tier.  He's fun to play and has a great gun, but he's way too slow and loud (both walking and placing his gadget).
---
Maestro is at least A tier.  His gadget is still really strong and tough to destroy (even if it is plausible now).  He has a great gun (LMG with super low TTK) with an acog and a very good secondary.
---
Dokk is A tier for me.  She is the attacker I hate most.  As a (lower MMR) roamer, I can deal with Lion (not a problem unless my location is already known) and Jackal (can often turn the pings into a trap for him).  But with no real way to counter it and continuous real-time reveal of my location, Dokk is a nightmare.  She will pretty much always be my ban when that comes.
---
Blitz is too low.  He might not be as strong on PC and at higher ranks, but he was banned a ton during Road to SI for a reason.  On Xbox and at lower skill (i.e. aim), he's brutally effective.  
---
Ash is too low.  Losing the acog didn't hurt her much.  It might even have made her more effective (by pushing players toward play that fits her strengths and away from less effective play), although less flexible.
---
You know that little tunnel in club . That‚Äôs where and then I‚Äôd have The Lord in the back with the hostage  with frost traps literrig the walkway
---
At least there‚Äôs only one person for Buck to TK with a frag
---
Angled decreases the time to ads but vertical increases accuracy
---
Great cosplay but are you by chance cross eyed or is that a weird glare on my screen
---
Seems like a normal match to me, I don't see a problem?
---
Buck with the black ice background instead of a black one would be insane.
---
Ok...stop.
---
I'm not a Gridlock main (or any op main), but I do play her a fair bit.
---
Almost always I rush a barricade and blow holes in it, but rarely with the shorty. 
---
I *want* the camper to know I'm there. I want them to be thinking about peeking when the bullets stop. 
---
I knock down the entire barricade with the M249. Takes about half the clip.
---
Then I throw in a trax. If the person is that dedicated to camping the spot and trying to peek, feel free to decide WTF to do with the trax. 
---
In the meantime, advantage: me. Because now I can peek you if you're there.
---
Hello PerpetualD, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/blgopo/i_made_this_video_a_while_ago_but_didnt_have_the/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It‚Äôs exactly as Ubisoft describes. Vertical grip acts suppresses recoil whereas angled grip decreases time to ADS. I would use vertical grip on guns that you have a hard time using and angled grip on anything else.
---
It sucks, but it's the best when the enemy gets cocky and you end up clutching it.

---
Before anyone says I'm a Smurf, I'm horrible. I only created it for shits and giggles
---
I don't even know what in the fuck the Twitch was doing.
---
What a stupid way to approach the door. If not OP, someone else would have capped her.
---
AND SHE IS A TWITCH.
---
YOU HAVE A DRONE.
---
YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAMP THERE.
---
PUNISH THEM!
---
Also the Gridlock is too stupid to even know the Twitch is that stupid.
---
Farted and I guess they heard it in the mic
---
LMAO
---
I'll explain the reasons behind some of my picks. Lesion, Thatcher, and Jager are very high A tier already. While I do understand why someone would put them in S, I don't think they are as absolutely mandatory 100% of the time as the hard breachers. You still want them, just not as much as a hard breacher on attack and I don't think there is an analog to being as mandatory on defense.
---
Nomad along with the previous mentions and Echo were debated on being put in S, however again the same reasoning.
---
Vigil, Valk, Dokk and Zofia are close to A tier, but they just aren't quite as good as the rest of A tier. They're still extremely strong and bringing them is a good idea, but an S or A would be better if you're lacking some of them.
---
Glaz is still easy A tier, he did get nerfed but he still has smokes and thermals which is a borderline uncountable combo.
---
Smoke and Alibi are still okay picks, but lag behind B tier in utility. Smoke in my personal belief was completely replaced by Echo still having the ability to stop plants, but gaining the ability to gather intel that's still useful after death. Alibi is fine, she could be B tier but I think she's outclassed by Valk when it comes to intel gathering.
---
Mozzie and Gridlock aren't on the website I used but Moz would be B and Gridlock A.
---
Cav and Ela are both very strong fraggers. Especially after Cavs buffs to her 2 shot range she's disgusting if you have a trigger finger now. Ela still retains a high win delta, she's still powerful enough in her own right.
---
Frost is punishing enough to be C, being put in an instant DBNO state now is way stronger then it used to be with the 20HP. Castle is far to situational to be more then E tier, on the sites he's good he's still easily countered and ends up being situationaly okay and most of the time bad.
---
Clash is equally as trash as Tachanka, maybe even more so. She requires far to much teamwork while still being reliant on being alive. Someone like Valk or Echo completely and wholly outclass her in the same way that Maestro outclasses Tachanka. Being able to do things from relative safety and still being useful after death means Clash has no place in the game as it stands.
---
Rip j√§ger and bandit :( still sad
---
No, even then - no apologies. You need to attack that door right away so the defenders don't have more time to do whatever it is they're doing.
---
From the moment you're given the all-clear, you need to start playing your strat *immediately*.
---
Look at Badger's video on IQ. He was able to see Echo.
---
sometimes I don't even get five people I get three to start with
---
Europe
---
Uh oh looks like we found the sledge in the video. He's upset because people aren't try Harding in casual like he does and doesn't want people recruit rushing because it's not realistic.
---
The best Rook strat is to go to the main door, pull it down and then leave the Rook armour there.
---
Attackers can't miss it. And it will freak them the fuck out.
---
Leaning has changed so the camera is centred in the head rather than on the edge to help fix lean spamming. This causes you're head to be more exposed during peeking aswell

I actually agree with just about all of this, i'd maybe bump jackal up a tier, but yeah this about sums it up for me.
---
r/iamverybadass?
---
So how should I have fixed my angle accordingly? Make it even tighter?
---
One thing I didnt expect in 2019 was a troll face
---
I think just not holding angles as much is what they're trying to do since they can just see you more plus from their angle after walking past the door it wasnt a pixel anymore since the first door frame wasnt blocking them so maybe just not hold that angle again??
---
But he wide peeked me while I held a tight angle, the advantage should have been on my side, but I almost had no time to react.

---
Woooosh
---
This quality is enough content
---
This is actually the best edit I‚Äôve seen in my life
---
BB is way too strong just holding an angle for the entire round. Literally. You cannot win a gun fight if he is rappelled on a window with only his head peeking. So allowing BB's rate of turning to be lowered allows for better countering/runouts/flank against him.
---
It's right off spawn. You know you have teammates around you. Be aware. It's like people spawning on defense, trying to shoot every drone, and hitting a few teammates. Or again, people flicking a default cam instead of first taking in if there's a teammate around them first.
---
Why h instead of b?
---
Yeah. Except for the fact that 1v1 Clash usually wins. But there is no nerfs you can really do about that. And she isn't too fun.
---

Try the DMR with a holo or reflex when your trigger finger is fast enough. The RoF feels near unlocked and 69 damage with a 20 round mag is pretty dam good. I would avoid the acog on buck in general because using the shotgun in ads with an acog is kinda silly.

The game already tracks the difference between a normal pistol vs the "Luison" and weather the interrogation was started or not, so its hopefully doesn't need a full feature add just a few checks if the personal leaving/disconnected was downed by cav or not.
---
Enough quality is is.
---
Don‚Äôt down teammates when they don‚Äôt want to plant. Just deal with it. They don‚Äôt deserve to be downed just because they didn‚Äôt plant. You might‚Äôve made that newcomer not want to play Siege anymore because of your toxicity(excuse me for the lack of another less harsh word). You don‚Äôt deal with toxicity with more toxicity. Other than that, have fun with the game! :)

Will I ever be able to set this as my wallpaper, it‚Äôs amazing
---
Because you stay incredibly still
---
I really don‚Äôt know, I think it also depends a lot on how the adapter is seen by the console iself. If it‚Äôs something like Generic USB, then I don‚Äôt know if you could tell if you were using an adapter or just an external hdd, let‚Äôs say. But if it was something like ‚ÄúSuper duper MNK adapter‚Äù, then yea, I think that Ubisoft should immediately contact Sony and Microsoft and try and talk to them.
---
Holy shit it's been 2 years
---
No they shouldn't. People are allowed to be assholes. I don't agree with people slinging slurs and all that bullshit, but I also don't agree with censoring and banning them. That's just beyond fucked up. I don't care if they insult me, my race, you, your race, whatever. They're an asshole, yeah. But they shouldn't be banned. Eventually if they keep it up, they'll just be talking to themselves because everyone else will have muted them.

then vault of the 90 degree edge of the helicopter
---
The point is that Ubisoft doesnt like Jagger at all, and are trying to nerf him, but dont know how.
---
It's an Android app. If you're on iOS, then you can't.
---
Just report them for rule number three.
---
my man predicted the future
---
Too strong? Are you actually serious? You think getting auto interrogated is too strong compared to leaving the game to avoid it? It should be ‚Äútoo strong‚Äù since you shouldn‚Äôt leave the game downed in the first place!
---
darn twitch is a retard
---
Well, Ubisoft can't do anything unless they contact Sony and Microsoft about it, it's a third party adapter, that connects to the CONSOLE, Ubisoft doesn't own or have authority over the console, just the game it has released.
---
Don't get me wrong, I found the muzzle brake ugly as hell on pistols.
---
I really wish the R6 Dev could do something about this. They should keep the muzzle brake equipped recoil pattern as default pattern, and convert muzzle attachment as cosmetic items. Then only leave two options available, 1) Stock version 2) Silencer version, nothing else. 
---
As a result, the silencer version would receive a buff due to muzzle brake equipped recoil pattern as default pattern.

And you comment this because... why did you comment this for again?
---
Toxicity in rainbow six? Nah.
---
Its just a joke cause of the word deplorable.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt always interrogate a downed person, there are other factors and half the time you will get killed for an interrogation.
---
Checkmate, ive been in that situation 2x and killed them while blind after 360ing around them
---
Fuuuuuuck, guess I know what my next phone will be
---
i love it great job 10/10 i'm an iq main so yeah
---
Why so many fidget spinners?
---
The game has plenty of flaws, I just don't care why you quit. Everybody posts on reddit about the reason they quit a certain game as if anybody really cares.
---
I know
---
You're right. The sight of Blitz causing people to commit suicide is pretty overpowered.
---
Remindme!
---
what ? O.o
---
What is rule 3?
---
Good, I feed on your fear
---
Frost is definitely a lot of fun
---
Anti platform/ platform elitist behaviour.
---
Since Burnt Horizon release this stuff has been at it's worst.
---
It was fun until Blitz,
---
Blitz is never fun.
---
Fuck
---
The SMG 11 had an acog...and a muzzle break. Rip
---
1. this is why you shouldn‚Äôt play hostage. even without this glitch hostage is a garbage mode 
---
2. it‚Äôs a glitch. not a hack. you can‚Äôt get banned for doing a glitch. they could lose some MMR or something but banning people for using a glitch is ridiculous
---
Ah ok
---
Can confirm
---
Yay! How do I get?
---
Whats unecessary about the joke, then? It doesnt make any statements. Just a reference.
---
you better have a bearing-9 as your secondary
---
I love doing this on both Clubhouse and outback maps
---
Anyone else look at the picture without reading the title and thought it was a drawing/painting of IQ?
---
dibs on posting this tomorrow since it‚Äôs reposted every day
---
It's just kinda icky territory
---
I have gotten 3 of those! And countless 4k's.
---
I can relate. Level 66 and still can‚Äôt get any more than 3 kills
---
i feel that way
---
Upvote for visibility.
---
Yes, but what if you do want to interrogate him/her, and he/she leaves. Let‚Äôs say in a different world, everybody leaves before getting interrogated, and your rules applied in that fictitious world where there is no auto interrogation. What happens? Caveira loses her main ability? Your answer does not make sense. Please explain why it would be a good idea. Let me say this again that leaving the game when you are downed shouldn‚Äôt happen.
---
Any constructive criticism?
