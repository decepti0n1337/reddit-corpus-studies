Tachanka still hasn't gotten his elite smh

My first time using photoshop ever also it was photoshop express on an iPhone.

U should  get recruit

He's 38 years old

Nice

no
---
I don't remember there being nearly as much complaining about the map pool in previous seasons.  There were occasional complaints, but nothing like the ongoing war about it that we've seen this season.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There are also some challenges and potential negatives to implementing it.  The biggest is that it would increase matchmaking time on unpopular maps.  Personally, I think the impact would be minimal (this game has a very large player base split between relatively few game modes) and be far outweighed by the positives.
---
Huh

Isnt that just hacked by Dokkaebi?

Ant man:What the hell happened here

Notice how his eyes are fifteen miles apart

Smoke you uneducated common duplicate

Does the stim do damage to enemies? I feel like a noob
---
Not gonna lie, I do feel kind of scummy doing it haha
---
it is don't get me wrong it is but you really need to be able to control its recoil now

What have you brought upon this cursed land?

Well yes /s

But i started on Operation Health
---
watch what they will do to kanal
---
It‚Äôs entirely subjective as it is just a cosmetic and in the end is down to personal preference. Personally I‚Äôm a fan of all of them, except for Ash‚Äôs, to me she has the most dull looking uniform and has a really lackluster animation to go with it.
---
I want more like lesion :(
---
Sorry can‚Äôt play tonight
---
I DJ the USSR national anthem if I get MVP with the full rainbow is magic Tachanka, people usually enjoy it
---
Ah okay. Angle is off but I could see myself using it if they integrated into the mesh
---
No
---
Thanks!
---
Well you don't have to use the LMG in the objective always . Use it to spawn peek instead
---
But you get 3 defence rounds too, that means nothing tbh.
---
People who complain about getting spawnpeeked actually are booty at the game 
---
CHANGE MY MIND
---
Fuck beat me to it
---
Take out the meth part and yeah that's pretty much his origin story.
---
Yee
---
I like it the best
---
The biggest problem with Tower is there is almost zero vertical play which really limits options on attack.   On top of that, its way too big and has way to many angles.
---
I feel like attacking on tower is basically just a countdown until you inevitably get domed by someone holding a pixel angle you cant even see.
---
Because rework
---
I really like Lesions.
---
I have to completely agree with you . Not everyone want to play competitively . And people will say their old excuse "Go play casual" . Casual is worse than toxic teammates in ranked
---
Bandit mains rise up!
---
You're defending tho. üòß
---
Matchmaking only takes the average MMR into account. Combine that with how easy it is to switch between two accounts and many people exploit this, having one "main" and another copper account that they use to boost friends. 
---
At its most extreme you could have someone reach Diamond only playing bronzes if they have four Copper IV's with them.
---
u/BasicallyHomeless
---
Valk has been considered as a very good operator since she was released. She is very popular and is picked quite often. 
---
As for Nokk, she has the lowest pick rate for just released Attacker and was the second worst Attacker when Ubi revealed the data in the last Designer's Note. With Glaz buffed and a new Attacker coming in, she will hit the rock bottom of the worst Attacker if left in her current state. 
---
Get Valk.
---
Show me because im pretty sure I can point it out.
---
It‚Äôs fine I fact checked it before installing.
---
Yes, I loved the old Hereford
---
Hell yeah
---
The difference is that Kaf√® needed a few improvements to make it more competitive.
---
Hereford was a bad map overall, so they needed to completely overhaul it, we have two staircases now.
---
It's not the best map ever, but I think the rework is the better map and people get too nostalgic over Old Hereford.
---
Like 5 posts on this skin hoping to find an explanation myself. This is the first comment questioning it.
---
Above Chalet??? Other than Oregan Chalet is the best map in the game IMO.
---
#And I‚Äôm finna be the attacker
---
Which was their huge mistake when Nokk's gadget is already underwhelming. By giving her a weak SMG instead of adjusting that AR, they screwed her up.
---
You‚Äôre several months late on this one, Chief
---
We‚Äôve known my guy
---
Where I am from you can get all kinds of attachments in Airsoft shops
---
The elite is just him when he was younger
---
Play ranked .
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
This elite skin ruined the "what's in the canister?" meme forever.
---
If I could attack some of the customers we get I would
---
Wrong buddy
---
damn when did we find out lol?
---
Is literally arhosol
---
Almost 2 months ago? Whenever the first leak was. It‚Äôs on his chest
---
Well on defense I main smoke but on attack I main twitch who I mained longer
---
You can like Chalet but it has some serious balance issues. For instance, Chalet only has 1 viable site on defense, it‚Äôs insanely difficult to rotate and roam around the map this and many other things lead this to be a very attacker sided map.
---
This is some MLG level shit 
---
GG man üëçüèª
---
They blocked the scope: How are the bullets gonna hit my target?
---
I don't get the style you are aiming for but i give it a try.
---
* color grading needed for that glitch style
---
* music doesn't sync/work with that type of style
---
* speed ups are too clean too fast and way too often
---
* music way too loud
---
* @ 1:56 things like that give eye cancer really fast
---
* @ 1:59 whatever happened there shouldn't happen. Every flow ( yes there was a tiny bit ) is gone
---
* didn't watch it further since i don't want to get seizure thanks to the glitch effects
---
all in all total bullshit.
---
sorry to say that but just spitting the truth.
---
make short clips and not giant montages.. you need to change the style here and there in such a long ass video otherwise it's predictable and not fun to watch anymore.
---
MYA-NEEEEEE
---
I should know, im a smoke main lol i never knew that
---
 One thing about FMG is that FMG and MP5K (which has nearly the identical stats other than the better drop off so would have been better for Nokk tbh) are used by Defenders with wide area utility. They (Smoke and Mute) often stay near the obj while holding angle and face against 1 or 2 Speed attackers. These guns work very well for that purpose when the Attackers are the one coming toward them. That's why "aim for the head" is actually more of a meme that's aimed at Defenders rather than Attackers in general.
---
Attackers (except shield ops of course) generally have range and high damage benefit to have an edge over Defenders while Defenders themselves usually have angle advantage and gadgets that help that accomplish that even more.
---
Nokk with FMG has neither the range nor the damage. She's an Attacker with a Defender gun without having the benefits of being a Defender. She's the only non-shield Attacker who is easily outgunned against the majority of Defenders.
---
So yes, FMG is the worst gun an Attacker can have when Nokk doesn't even have a impactful gadget to fully support her or her teammate.
---
Throw pick, don't listen to the unfunny console memers.
---
spawnpeek 100
---
That just makes a solution to a problem they made. Another hard breacher would be nice, but not an op specifically designed to counter this op
---
Yea but console players arent real.
---
Arsole / arsenole / arsacyclopentadiene
---
I complain
---
Even in Gold and below, there's no reason to pick her when IQ or Ash can already do what Nokk does but with better result and more efficiency.
---
Arsole
---
WE CAN FIGURE OUT ‚Äú what‚Äôs in the canister
---
YES
---
Biggest question is where's the second one?
---
They are fixing searchbaiting for next season, so your complaining finally worked
---
Yea?
---
No skeleton key?
---
No airjab launcher?
---
You can keep it
---
No I don't do that I just stuck and play with randoms cause I do not have a team
---
ill drill out a hole
---
Ash be like
---
Doesn‚Äôt stop them from shooting you with bullets
---
Pros RARELY die to down peek. I‚Äôve told you twice now. Learn where you get shot from and use your headphones. They gotta break a door. Common game sense.
---
Yes
---
[You know what me and my boys brought back from area51?](https://imgur.com/gallery/QJbfT)

maybe after a few of our future projects, you may want to reconsider that
---
unless the punchline was that you didn't know the thing that you asked for, no, it was not a joke
---
Border. I could play another 1000 games on that map.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs the kevlar
---
Not what i said. I know Ubisoft did an animated one but mine was still. No i said orginal as in the one ubisoft did. There is a difference regardless.
---
But go ahead and believe what you want. 
---
Your entitled to your own opinion even if you are wrong.
---
SLAV TACHANKA

You're*
---
Ash is in the picture?
---
General Kenobi
---
They usually do two per season, one at the start and one towards the end.
---
Fella this ain‚Äôt it
---
Lion, finka
---
Grapple hook lady looks like she may push Ash out of the #1 spot for pushing on attack.
---
Fire shield boy.....we dotn really know enough about. If it's just a gas can we can shoot to cause a small explosion, I don't thibk it will be that great.

Once spammed shot an ash through the airplane entrance door. Somehow also wall pierced a recruit.

Looks like her first prototype. Lol
---
Seems to affect you pretty hard if say the insult worked
---
Idk I'll say phone cause it looks similar to some kind of like a Galaxy phone.
---
Is her mag a 9mm?
---
But what does we know, ubi contradicts itself all the time, like for example I think its the Jackal chibi where he isn't even holding his gun he's holding an MP5
---
The only way I see them doing this is if they approach it like how they did in Outbreak. Lion was in the GIGN and Finka was in the Spetsnaz.
---
Remove Ranks from ranked!
---
I agree. I always get lost on Hereford base now lmao
---
4.6mm*
---
Just Give This Man P90 with fucking ACOG already ubi 
---
he so useless now with stupid MPX and useless gadget
---
You are boosting the other guys and getting them easier matches (premade and premeditated). You are also playing mostly golds, not plats.
---
I see you got both now haha
---
"you were supposed to destroy the sith, not join them"
---
Bruh
---
Our boy got the new IPhone! Lol
---
Shooting through shields? No.  But he should cause slow down to shields, like when clash zaps an op, and after a few seconds of being hit, should knock shields off balance like melee
---
They are from the same country, not the same Counter Terrorism Unit. CBRN isn't the same as GIGN and Spetsnaz
---
Just saw it, nice!
---
No i was genuinely curious why people said it. Great english btw, just graduate middle school?
---
I mean, Six is a team and they have an HQ for their ops.
---
because personal preferrence?
---
Does anyone know how to fix this?
---
That's good to know, thanks.
---
Everything in this game is laughably over priced....its a paid game, and elite skins are what... 15$? The price or two operators? Lol
---
Yes.
---
Ok libtard
---
I didn‚Äôt really got a chance to play the map
---
EW WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU PLAYING WITH MOTION BLUR ON??????????????????
---
Nice clip, but plz, help urself and turn that nasty shit off
---
No problem :) the next Elite should be announced on the 18th alongside the new season. No one knows for sure who it‚Äôs for but it could a Mira Elite for all we know.
---
It's good, but it looks like she's using the rail gun from Battlefield 4 just with a top carry handle.
---
You have entered the Meghan Station
---
i hate all the new map designs and hope theyll change direction soon, seems like this game is turning into something i dont like
---
Again the antifa thing is how a buddy of mine described it so that's what we call it
---
This is why PC masterrace guys say console clips are the most supreme smooth brain things
---
so a maverick with a lesion type attack
---
Didn't they come from the french and the russian CBRN threat units and joined Team Rainbow to form their own one?
---
From what i remember Lesion was part of a chinese CBRN threat unit and then went to the SDU
---
As all things should be
---
Imo Plane, Skyscraper, and house are the maps where I‚Äôd get insta spawnpeaked
---
Buck has crazy recoil with his AR, Gridlock's is stable. Buck requires a lot more map knowledge to be useful, but he's also much cheaper. Jackal is banned all the time in ranked, so if you play ranked skip him and save for later.
---
Lion being released.
---
Area 51
---
Add a .50 cal drum mag
---
it still boggles my mind that it never comes out.
---
R6S is a great game...but its sub F2P when it comes to the store/packs.
---
Yeah console is toxic
---
I'm close too
---
But hey, I do have an xbox. I am getting a ps4 for Black Friday so that's coool.
---
Nice, I'm waiting to get the new ps5
---
Doesn't change the fact that it's literally a placeholder until people get more operators.
---
Yeah I got it from a friend I'm just really surprised u found it cause I posted it a while ago
---
I wish he was wearing jeans i just feel jeans would look better
---
JUST MONIKA...WEISS
---
Nice. I'm a diehard xbox fan, but I'm only getting an ps4 for bloodborne.
---
There‚Äôs never in the history of this game been somebody that said ‚Äúwow, I love dying immediately after spawning so I don‚Äôt get to play‚Äù
---
That does seem like a good way thanks kind sir
---
No. You aren't. It's the most fucking popular post on this sub. It's. In. The. Game. So. It's. Allow.
---
I smell photoshop
---
Can‚Äôt say you‚Äôre wrong
---
Good shit
---
Sorry I‚Äôm new to this sub and to reddit
---
Yes please add this
---
Fuckn Blackbeard
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
I love dying immediately after spawning so I can go to the fridge and get some refills and snacks.
---
Phantom Sight is done and dusted. I'll be pissed as fuck if they recycle weapons again this time around though.
---
Generally I‚Äôm so used to it that I just sigh in disappointment only to do it the next round when I‚Äôm defending....honestly it‚Äôs sad that people consider it okay to spawn peek, honestly I only do it to ‚Äúreturn the favor‚Äù it‚Äôs not because I hate getting killed it‚Äôs just to let them know that two can play the same game and get the same results when done correctly
---
It‚Äôs just frustrating as shit. I was asking would there be anyway ubi could counter it or make it easier for a counter.
---
Flaming yeet
---
Mine work?
---
You need to be more slow and methodical when spawning, check windows, use drone, or even play a shield operator for that and other reasons, yea it‚Äôs annoying but can‚Äôt be fixed
---
Yes, but there are some cases where this doesn't need to be applied. Sometimes people get lucky kills and there's nothing you could improve on to change it.
---
The part that gets me is that's its the same deal with glazs elite where some wanted a ghille suit which is so cliche tbh. I love the one he got as it feels more fitting to the game. Same with smokes. A plauge doctor is as dumb a idea as iqs elite.
---
81 bullets btw
---
You just made history
---
I have it too and i have been using Lion with 417 since i got black ice for 417. Its worth to try out.
---
Test
---
Just don't breathe on the shield or it will break
---
You right but just in general it‚Äôs good to do anyways you know
---
You got me! SHIT
---
That sucks, do you remember the castle glitch that did that?
---
Those sites are usually garbage. I‚Äôm on my phone to editing it but I don‚Äôt have my pc with photoshop at hand to edit it myself sadly.

Thank you someone cares about the 47,000 approximate people who play Xbox.

I WANT THAT ACE!

Ok you could send the photo to me, if you need a specific one done. I'll ask if he can do it.
---
Yes, you're the only one. It sucked absolute ass
---
The difference is Cosmetic and game changing.  The cosmetic has No affect on your performance in the game while the Guns in BO4 change things entirely.  
---
If you dont like the skins, dont buy them?  It doesnt put you at a disadvantage.  I personally spend some extra money on siege because I do like the cosmetics and I dont really play any other games.  
---
Its like race changes/faction changes in WoW.
---
not directed towards you, but you're pretty damn naive either way

I have had many headshots not register this season, before it would be one or two per season but this one, it's 4-5 a day.

It is both.
---
1 c4 and both if you would be kissing Lord Tachanka's toes in heaven.
---
Idk I feel WW2 would be a better fit
---
So elite skin is a baby?
---
Just like Ogres, it has layers
---
This is nothing, I spawnpeek the drone in pool of Coastline all the time

Except the map was trash. it had one. Single. Door.   
---
One.

Smoke elite skin just dropped

Flair cheks out
---
Hibana is in no way thicc but I love her just the same.
---
Meh, could be op but seems like a waste for maverick when he could make a hole like that in 1 canister
---
Rook my boy
---
Can you do that on Xbox? If so how do you do that?
---
I guess you can already say this is in the game except not as complex. Maverick can do what is called ‚ÄúMaverick Tricking‚Äù and essentially torch the top and bottom portions of the reinforced wall and it will get rid of the reinforced wall and leave the soft wall that it was reinforcing. Basically once he does that a person with soft destruction capabilities like Zofia, Buck, Ash, or Sledge to take down the soft wall.
---
Hereford no explanation needed
---
They have already done ww2, but tbh because the smoke is yellow it looks like mustard gas, and they started using that during ww1, they also made gas masks out of flannels and goggles they had laying about which could of looked good on him.
---
Damn, another post that gets it wrong.
---
It's Arsole. Search the sub. this was clarified yesterday and a a month ago when it was leaked. AsH3 is an organoarsenic compound with 3 H atoms. As-H is the actual structure which resembles the one on his jacket, and is an metallone with a single H atom.
---
It's Arsole, you a**hole. /s

Something to do with her background i think

Where is recruit :p

You‚Äôre crazy it has a ton of door.

thanks! its just for display since it was sized for the VFC FN scar but it fits on my mp7 so i thought it would be a cool photo

What's funny is that they still have it in the files

Plague Doctor will be great (joke, Plague Doctor will be good for Halloween)

Idk. It says ‚Äúbreach charge bonus 10‚Äù on the down and the kill. I don‚Äôt really know exactly what that means.

Wow how did you do the one for nomad

I love Tower too, but admittedly it feels too big and empty for 10 people.

Even Terrorist Hunt Classic with many more targets, it takes forever to clear so many rooms and floors.

What‚Äôs with all the downvotes on people saying they don‚Äôt like it. I hate it too, looks horribly out of place.

Are there shields meant for play?

it was originally a cheap qd sling point i found on amazon, glued some pipes on and made slots for the shield

So you literally just did a pic-to-minecraft software. you still have the jpeggy mess around the entire thing; probably took you three minutes. Stop karma whoring.

thanks!

Yes I do

I still have terrorist hunt flashbacks of this map

They should make the elite just completely not existent and I would support it 100%

Come on, say about Plague Doctor!!!

Flair checks out

I like how you went back for your teammate. It's the wholesome cherry on top.

you forgot the hostage
---
Huh, cant believe I missed that. I generally check the sub once a day too

i wish, ill probably revisit this in the future with a more impact resistant material and more proper dimensions for blackbeards rifle shield, but ill get to that later in the year hopefully.
---
XIM in the title lol you‚Äôre garbage
---
It‚Äôs just for more views don‚Äôt get your panties in a bunch

This is so disappointing

I don‚Äôt know why but me and my friends call Tachanka Tatiana

Dora. Has the worst situational awareness.
---
All it really needed was a few more doors... Not really a hard fix.
---
Bandit MP-7 Mounted to a Blackbeard shield. Gotta have another German CTU with this ability
---
Would it be worth making a new op around such a niche scenario?
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs because hostage and such but I dunno
---
Do it through their gt
---
Nice 4k! Love the way Hibana died.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking but it seemed kinda far fetched
---
Perfectly balanced... As all things should be.

All the work to cut and shape the plastic or plexiglass, and they surrounded it in crappy electrical tape.

Dope clip but the red dot mp5 disturbs me
---
Not trying to criticize how people play but A RED DOT ON THE MP5!?!
---
what do u mean?
---
Dok doesn't need a buff, but this might be a nice QOL change.
---
Wheres n√µkk?
---
Your crosshair placement is pretty bad tbh
---
It‚Äôs a video game, no recoil is realistic in video games.
---
You should swap operator from hereford and chalet because chalet happens in France and hereford base is a training base next to a military airport so jager belong here
---
What‚Äôs the difference between your Twitter and the ESL R6 Twitter?
---
They behave the same way from ads's point of view.
---
On kafe I thin there is more thought put into the hatch placement, but on other maps, theme park, clubhouse, coastline for example there are some very annoying hatches and with this ability, at the very least, you would force defenders to expend some hard beach utility or find a new route. I dont think it would be op at all, and it is a bit too niche to build an op around, imagine how low the pick rate for an op who's only purpose was to reinforce roof hatches on maps like border, they would be useless. So rework or buff, I thought it might help boost castles usefulness a bit.
---
Im glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one thinking this
---
They said it could not be done. They said it was designed for tanks. They said, I could not make it smaller and more accurate. They were wrong.
---
Tear gas, but I'm not sure how it would work since the effect would be similar to grzmots.
---
Wow nice
---
Are you trying to say you enjoy playing Kanal as it is?
---
i only spawnpeek to punish stupid people, examples
---
* plane: if you are still spawning main and sprinting up the stairs you deserve to die
---
* clubhouse: if you are spawning front gate you deserve to die
---
* favela: if you stand on the roofs outside and dont expect me to punch a small murder-hole then you deserve to die
---
and so on for a few maps, all in all i only ever peek shitty places to spawn, and if my team spawns there and gets downed my group will leave them to die, since you shouldnt be spawning those place anyway
---
Nah probs not
---
I need this weapon. But I‚Äôll probably fuck up every kill opportunity with my horrible aim
---
I like it, the only argument I‚Äôve seen for the plague doctor set is that they both have similar marks and that‚Äôs about it.
---
i made three rifle shields, lets make it possible
---
 No it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre good. Never said it did? But I am saying elo shouldn‚Äôt be the stats they use for matchmaking... it should be W/L AND K/D cause I fell that‚Äôs a better stat to go off of. One person can do terrible placement wise in the beginning of the season(usually always glitches and shit anyhow) then get back into the groove and kill it from there on out. (because after a while you start getting no fucking points for winning but losing doesn‚Äôt always seem to match winning points) I mean I‚Äôve played so much I‚Äôm like stuck in silver this season. But I‚Äôve had wins where I‚Äôll only make 20-24 points and then then win the next 3 matches gaining the same points... then get a loss and lose fucking 40? Idk maybe fucking read instead of thinking I‚Äôm just saying K/D means you‚Äôre ‚Äúgood‚Äù dumbass.
---
Technically it‚Äôs an older girl that looks like a young girl.

Lmao Kony2012 My brain just stopped working
---
Mythbuster called, they want Buster back
---
he definitely would in my opinion this is the worst elite skin
---
Fuck you now I won‚Äôt sleep at night

Maestro, Lion, Mozzie
---
Yeah lmao I‚Äôm more proud of it than I probably should be

Please show me

---
Here come dat boi
---
So Tachanka
---
id love that
---
His hair looks so greasy
---
It would make it 30 times better for sure, also fitting for you know, a S.A.S operative.
---
Maestro is definitely a must get. His gun is amazing and his turrets are fun to use, as well as useful.

new Hereford is absolutely hell on attack. Same thing with old.

Yeah ive seen players get some great plays with his lmg and cant go wrong with another set of cams
---
&gt; This was a thing I did for fun and to get my mind off of the shit fest that is Rainbow Six Siege.
---
oH mAn, I gUeSs YoU‚ÄôlL hAvE tO pLaY sIeGe NoW kId
---
Is lion still decent after his ability nerf or he just for the guns?
---
Yes. And it's the only good option they have
---
Take the idea of taking the highest elo instead of the average elo
---
For example if you are Plat I and queue with your friend who is a real Bronze I you might end up with two other Plats who also have a Bronze friend on your team while the enemies are all Plats..
---
I love that spawnpeek
---
Nice ace!
---
Looks Hella cute! And you know a Frost cosplay is accurate when it looks cute
---
That looks great
---
Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
The Nokk one is VERY cool!
---
Something straight out of TRON!
---
I guess he reported u when u've marked him on camera xD
---
Thank god keep it hidden, I‚Äôm not tryna get peeked every game
---
Looks great! Love the gun as well.
---
Oh, do you work there? Did you mean to send this to your boss?
---
If I got sniped by that I would think twice about approaching the objective from the outside
---
Downvoted for asking a question, rip my man
---
Not really. The only thing I like about the skin is that you can see part of his face. I'd have removed even more of the mask.
---
I saw someone try to fuze a room before their team breached it, and his team ran in as the fuze went off.
---
What the fuck did you bring upon this cursed land
---
It‚Äôs the dev skin
---
if you‚Äôre on console ill assume you‚Äôre like me in the sense that sometimes your aim is fucked beyond repair, Finka could be a great asset in times like that
---
I think she‚Äôs great, but she‚Äôs not that useful towards the higher ranks
---
Nah. You just played against a bunch of noob ass bitches.
---
69420 ping, bite me
---
Wholesome spawnpeeking? wtf
---
You're simply not worthy
---
but I did see a clip of something similar happened the attacker downed the defender and tried to used the turret and died instead lol
---
can you please give me a source or something, I have been looking all day to find some news related to this but I haven't found any
---
I wanted to call my dog j√§ger
---
This is gonna get removed cause the rules of this sub are stupid

My aim is pretty good for a high sensitivity console player but im definitely interested in finka

It's one of the rarest skins there is because only devs/people who worked for ubi get it
---
He is a cyborg
---
best take
---
So basically, any video game ever.
---
If you've got good aim then get Kaid and use his shotgun, it's an absolute machine for me. I'm also surprised you don't have Maestro, you should, his alda is extremely powerful
---
I hope they do. Then I will come back.
---
What platform
---
At that moment, Pablo knew.... he fucked up
---
that's dumb. matchmaking needs to just be randomized in casual
---
Cant look any worse then it already is
---
F
---
How would you even counter that lmao
---
I think he was about to tea bag there...
---
She can only do it if she has one of here zofia charges left (Lifeline) left... and can do it only one time.
---
Dogs are a massive cut to not only time and dedication but also money, and he's probably agreeing that it's not cheap owning a dog, and that they don't live up to how much they're popularized (i'm only assuming) and maybe he is maybe he isn't.
---
I like the skin :(
---
At meast better than lesion, who became a fucking power ranger
---
No, go back to 2016 and play before the game became COD and the community became a bunch of toxic 12 year olds.
---
its part of her gadget called lifeline...
---
Doc can also self revive and Finka can others revive.
---
It's not that, I'm just wondering that if I always get matchmade against high rank players, why does my team never gets any of those players? They're always on the enemy team, and most of the guys aren't in a squad. Just a bunch of solo Golds/Plats/Diamonds all on the same team.
---
Also, so you're saying that those Plats/Diamonds have a similar Casual MMR to me?
---
idk most matches they smash our team, shouldn't their MMR's be much more?
---
Also, how does this MMR work for Casual? I didn't know Casual had a hidden ranking system.
---
Smoke is good too. I personally would take maestro over smoke though
---
Welcome to the club

---
The map deserved an actual rework, not a complete redo. It's not the same map anymore.
---
they had it like that, people bitched. they changed it to be based on rank, people bitched. they made it its own separate but the same system, people still bitch.
---
I noticed this as well, and I realized there is another way of silent sprint. Either way, somebody mentioned in another post that this issue is only on client side.
---
I believe as long as the enemies are carefully listening, they can still notice these sprinters arrival. So in this case, Ubisoft would less likely to fix this in a timely manner.
---
Probably explains why im stuck on gold one. But ive never been cheesed so bad like that. Those are copper fucks.
---
Just play ranked lol
---
nice
---
Sorry, I didn't know Casual also had an MMR.
---
Since it's Casual, I was expecting that it would be players from all skill levels.
---
How does the MMR in Casual work exactly?
---
&gt; I'm just wondering that if I always get matchmade against high rank players, why does my team never gets any of those players?
---
Like I said, confirmation bias.
---
&gt;Also, so you're saying that those Plats/Diamonds have a similar Casual MMR to me?
---
&gt;idk most matches they smash our team, shouldn't their MMR's be much more?
---
Not if they don't play casual all that much.
---
&gt;Also, how does this MMR work for Casual? I didn't know Casual had a hidden ranking system.
---
Same as ranked.

you know this thing google right? And smoke elite was leaked months ago its nothing new whats in the canister...

Good for you. I think it‚Äôs shit. Doesn‚Äôt make me broke.
---
Okay Google, how to delete someone elses Reddit account?
---
in his concept art he is saving a child from a burning house.
---
Thanks for clearing that up. I did notice when I first started playing, lots of people were the same as me, very inexperienced. The more I played, I started getting matchmade with better players.
---
Does that mean that I'm technically being matched fairly? Even if the people are a million times better, since they don't play Casual that much? And would this have been different if my K/D or W/L was below 1.0?
---
Ok so you have the choice between papa maestro that shoots so much bullet that you don't even have to aim, an operator that is getting so much loved that 99% of the time he's getting banned, or an other one where in a 1v1 situation match point you will use the DE cuz honestly... Isn't it awesome to kill ppl with it.
---
Honestly maestro or call echo is always banned and then maestro have the superiors shooting bulletproof cam and have a fun with 81bullet+acog+laser+high rate of fire
---
The only thing making call better is the reload time, slightly faster and she have one more cam...
---
Make a Clash one, i dont think it will be that hard
---
I thought it was spelled spawn "peeking" judging by YouTube videos and shit, but most people spell it as spawn "peaking" on this subreddit. Which one is right?
---
oh no
---
If you look on the website  it has a quote from him next to the pic "Save you once, shame on me. Save you twice? Well. You‚Äôre family now, and we don‚Äôt keep count.‚Äù I'd say he definitely started the fire.
---
I'm going to once I hit 100.
---
But I was just curious. I didn't know Casual had an MMR of its own lol.
---
For example the geisha hatch on skyscraper. ALWAYS reinforce hatches
---
They're all very good operators. My Pic would be Maestro because of his MG and his revolvers, his evil eye is very good too, if you place it well it can be a real pain in the ass and you can often hit an enemy for 30 to 50 health, although in the current meta there's lots of ash, zofias and sledge so 30 percent of the time it will be destroyed unless it's in a good position. Echo has good guns too, I'd still prefer maestro's but that's up to personal preference, I'd say his gadget is a bit better than maestros as it is invisible and can deny planting, I use it to support my roamers, following fraggers around and spotting them and stunning them when the roamers is about to attack. Valk is useful if you're good at placing the cams, I'd suggest watching a guide, her guns are not as good as maestro and echo, the mpx is a pea shooter, although it has very good stability so it can be a headshot machine if you can aim well, the spas is a shotgun, nothing more, nothing less, the D50 pistol is really good at making holes both in walls and people, but it's still a secondary. Overall I'd say either Echo or Maestro, keep in mind that echo is the best option but it gets banned every game.
---
Maverick intensifies
---
Acog, acog, acog and acog
---
unlucky
---
&gt;They're always on the enemy team
---
I bet they aren't. Have have the same false memory as those that always claimed that they lose 90% of their casual games and when you check their stats, they have a 50% winrate
---
Its random
---
Got it ty

Weirdly they did have a mav that round...

---
Issa joke
---
I suppress side arms specifically for taking out cameras and not giving my position away. But never a primary.
---
Vigil and Cavieras gadgets are made to roam. But Cav isn‚Äôt a team operator. She brings nothing to the team and her guns aren‚Äôt good. Her pistol is good for a pistol but is still a pistol. Her shotguns good but it‚Äôs still a shotgun so you can‚Äôt use it past a few meters. SMG is dogshit. She is also shit against good teams. Vigil doesn‚Äôt bring much for the team BUT he has really good guns. K1A slaps and he has full auto secondaries that are really good, so you should get kills with him.
---
In my humble opinion. I believe that Jager is the best roamed. He is a 3 speed with a great gadget that is helpful to the team. His gun is like almost the best on defense, second to the Alda. My only trouble with him is that putting down 3 gadgets 2 barb and 2 reinforcements takes forever when you are trying to leave site.
---
His roni gun is no fair, instant kill
---
It looks soooo bad.  Hibana is growing on me still but between this, IQ and lesion I'm not liking their design choices at all recently
---
Every gun is a headshot machine?
---
When that happens you just gotta sit there with a blank face and whisper to yourself ‚Äúwhy are we still here, just to suffer‚Äù
---
Wow I've only been able to find people who have had it since burnt horizon. Did ubisoft say that recently or was it at the beginning of phantom sight?
---
"What the fuck am I wearing"
---
I for one don't actually like this elite
---
Im used to dmrs so I wanna se new guns but nokk's ability is great cos I'm aggressive and maybe if the defender has an Ar il get him
---
Why the fucking fuck is she holding a wrench
---
I thought it was a pun for having peaked with that amazing peek.
---
Low mag though lol
---
You sent alone 
---
People said this when the skin got leaked and I said ‚Äúthis better not be the fucking skin‚Äù
---
Definitely gonna buy that one
---
Nokk is iffy, really works well in a high level ranked game where cameras actually matter, tbh I would wait for the new ones, they actually seem decent
---
sure, you can buy individual items through valkyrie customisation.
---
Note: bundle price is lower than buying everything one by one

There is if you change the GameSettings.ini file.

---
It says that you are a normal gamer like all of us. You like playing tactical team based shooter. And battle royals with building elements. We are all in the same boat. No matter what we play
---
Lesion, IQ and now Smoke and Mira are pretty shit tbh.  Mutes jammers were kind of a letdown but overall I sort of enjoyed the older style military uniforms, Hibana was the last decent one and even though I main her I have been on the fence about getting it.
---
I like how your getting toxic because you were too slow to post them all, and plus wdgaf about how you were halfway it‚Äôs a joke
---
They all fuck shit up, depends how you play tho, I guess the most accessible one is valk
---
Yeah gotta make em count cause that shotgun don‚Äôt come out too fast
---
I suggest Maestro because his lmg is extremely good. His gadget is great as well.
---
Mission Accomplished.

If you go to the game settings.ini file in Documents &gt; My Games and click on the folder in there and open the gamesettings.ini file

Amazing, I love it!
---
Yeah, (as you can see from my flair) I use the MP5SD, and it's my favorite to spawnpeek alongside the Alda also because the supressor may cause them to not realize where you're shooting from immediately.
---
That's bank my dude
---
Yeah NC is a nice place this must be high in the mountains Raleigh cause its boiling where I am in NC
---
Old Hereford was genuinely one of my favourite maps and I still can't find any joy in playing the rework unlike Club House which feels infinitely better. I realise that's because the Hereford change was a complete remake, but still.
---
No but those probably fit my style of play
---
Yacht  is  pretty well  balanced  though.
---
Why can't I get matches like this? Most of mine are filled with ddossers, teamkillers, sweaty diamonds, and toxic 4 stacks.
---
In my opinion buy the one with all the base operators first to see if you like it as it is a better deal than the starter one 
---
Also it is much more fun with friends
---
Rainbow six is the best first person shooter game, and once you get a deeper understanding of shit in the game then it all of a sudden is a whole different game, it‚Äôs dope

Oh, you can just write the link on the reply!

well that would mean any asshole who's adamant about reinforcing the wall could potentially still do it.
---
Laid is hatch man, you go now!!
---
Dang
---
There is an issue where you can unwittingly abandon a match by backing out of matchmaking - it happens when a lobby is created but the game hasn‚Äôt yet told you a lobby is created. Then you get dinged with an abandon once the match you abandoned ends. 
---
Although if that was what happened here, you should have been promoted to reconnect to the match when you started matchmaking again, and should have had to explicitly refuse to reconnect before getting into your new match.
---
You read the part after bs? There is no difference in queuetime whatsoever
---
Yeah I'm using the G402. A good mouse is essential
---
Better T hunt
---
That's not ranked
---
He is really gud
---
Aim at the center of mass and practice recoil control then? You shouldn‚Äôt be aiming at the head with an SMG-12 it dumps a mag in like 2 seconds. if you‚Äôre running around with it you should never expect to get the drop on anyone unless you‚Äôre holding an angle. So it would be better practice to use it in t-hunt and try to clear as many terrorists that you could before switching.
---
Tuxbird and gregor definitely
---
If you don't play against those players, you'll never improve on this game. Literally every game you have someone that is better than you somehow and they won't be necessarily plat. Solo queue is a totally different experience than parties in every competitive game. If you have problems with that difference or plats and beyond because of your rank, than perhaps competitive games are not for you.
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference... maybe because my rank is lower on xbox ... my xbox account is my smurf  lol
---
Lmao nice job dumbass, how about not reposting mere hours after the original pic

Yea I think so too. Have a nice day and let's not talk again
---
Why?
---
What should I get?
---
I don‚Äôt see how being able to practice headshotting with an SMG-12 is anything but a good thing. If you don‚Äôt get headshots you likely are going to have a tougher time surviving a fight. Especially now with Warden in the game. And Vigil probably would appreciate it as well.

Also it‚Äôs not like bombers are only stronger in the head.

I really don‚Äôt understand how to get this point across but if there‚Äôs a platform with more players than another platform there is going to be a shorter queue time on the more populated server.

Political matters do not and should not influence games, there are already continual news articles highlighting that video games cause gun violence, even as a suggestion this just seems quite silly.
---
Yea it would

I don‚Äôt think a practice range per-say is needed as ts is good enough for that but maybe a shooting range that you can access while in que to keep warmed up in between the games

No, it can be easily coded to avoid that. Just copy the code from picking an operator by hand so the same one can't be picked twice. If multiple players are AFK the player with the lowest ping gets first choice and so one

It would be cool if you could use all the weapons in the game here too, and practice breaching and stuff too.

I recommend if you're starting out to try Mute. Hes really good for beginners

Jager has the best defense gun in the game, no acog, but has good gadget. He is used just about every game.

---
You're thinking of polling rate
---
this is a brilliant idea. if you bodyshot the enemy instead of headshotting, you instantly ‚Äúfail‚Äù the mission or die.

It's Kylee not Kyle

It's grown on me. It fits his backstory/personality, and I like the more casual skins anyway. I'd rather something like this than the tech skin Lesion got.
---
There's dozens of us!
---
The devs themselves came out and said this almost 2 years ago. There was major backlash from the community and everybody just put their fingers in their ears and pretended like they didn't hear it. Don't expect anything different now.

I agree, that is what the game lacks for competitive games

---
I drew Kaid because he's as old as the character that was on this pose on the reference
---
And you're welcome !
---
And his elite does not fit him perfectly the entire point of smokes original outfit is it protects him from the mustard gas that would kill him without the stuff he had on but the elite does not have that protection smoke would be dead if he was in his own gas as the elite it would absorb into his skin
---
Change Thatcher's knife to the six inch blade because it never loses reception
---
How were they hacking?
---
Lol be thankful that you didn't experience the pure terror that Lion was. EVERY SINGLE ROUND was filled with sound of Lion's drone going off. 
---
Won a round as Attacking team with Lion? Ready to face Lion as a Defending team and so on. Super powerful gadget with Mute being the only "counter".
---
HOOOOORYYYYYYY SHIIIIIITAAAAA
---
Or when you join a game in progress right before a round starts. Ive gotten dropped onto ops I dont normally play and didnt have outfitted quite a few times.
---
*proceeds to teach chemistry lesson on arsenic*
---
Are you playing terrorist hunt?
---
Was it bugged before or something?
---
Pretty sure he's supposed to be younger in this skin. Dude was only 17 when he enlisted using a fake ID, and was a hooligan before that.
---
No, polling rate may have a hand in this, but it could be that this guy uses like 200 DPI at 100 in-game sens.
---
I'm sure if you tried DPI this low at such high sensitivity it will do the exact same thing as shown in the video.
---
Doesn't matter the Lord will still stuck
---
If it‚Äôs ‚Äúwalling‚Äù then you could‚Äôve mistaken. You can‚Äôt just say they‚Äôre hacking, what kind of hacks.
---
Silver omega lul
---
Oh shoot
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a hacker for 2ish months? I‚Äôve only seen 3-4 100% hackers in the 3+ years I‚Äôve played. You likely got drones and prefired.
---
Do you ever see a saying msg: "x was banned by battle eye"? That's the  amount of hackers they ban
---
wait is this a thing?
---
Nope
---
Hopefully newly created ones instead of the recycled garbage of this seasons ops
---
Yeah he already looks like chicken little :|
---
No change it to a brick to support the Chinese police against violent HK protestors.
---
Or just don't make videogames political, no one is ever on the right side of politics.
---
Yeah ik. It's my first time playing the game though so I'm happy with it
---
Yeah that's what I hope for
---
Same
---
And "pro" players are lazy copycats.
---
MLG was one of the worst things to come to gaming. Ever since them it's been lazy gamers refusing to try anything new and just copying the "pros".
---
I don‚Äôt get why this skin is getting so much hate.
---
Yes yes yes, but what about Creamvera sneaking up on Capitavdol?
---
As is arsenic
---
Haha that guy must have been pissed haha

---
Man I'm just saying. I don't need your approval and I can tell you there are more hackers now than there were then. I've been playing since Skull Rain if that's any consolation to you
---

---
Only people I see ‚Äúderanking‚Äù are you guys lolol
---
This is actually one of the more balanced ranked games you can hope for lol
---
one of the wins was from a guy basically hiding in the garage in consulate. he was sitting prone and beat the plat 2 because he went full bot mode
---
You realize that they could have been better then you all the stuff your saying multiple people where doing is what most plats and diamonds would do
---
Blyat, whaddup.
---
Who's the artist? Would love to see more from this person.

After playing those three maps about 3-4 times each, I can confirm that there are bombers on all three of them.
---
true, they weren‚Äôt boosting but it wasn‚Äôt fun for our team
---
Now do the same but caveira
---
Seeing that scares me a little. Reminds me of the lunar ghost from the live action scooby doo movie
---
don't buy him
---
Is that...is that a motherfucking jojo reference?
---
True. But this is probably going to be how it works. Plat is within 1 rank of gold. So they are probably going to get pooled together for matchmaking. Whatever the new rules for party‚Äôs will be, is going to become a common setup for solos as well
---
I think hes great if you play him right. I think the whole hostage meme made him less likeable. Hes still one of my most played ops but like a lot of other ops he works best with a team that communicates. No communication=accidental TKs
---
That's it I'm quiting
---
Lion is good, but i would get Zofia if I were you. Her guns are amazing and her gadget is also good. (She can also revive herself when downed)
---
You realize the person with a grappling hook could in theory be a defender they haven‚Äôt completely confirmed what side they will be in yet and also modify agrees with you
---
Yeah guess you're right you know\[Sarcastic Tone\] Just wallbang 3 people through a floor with no pings just casual day at the office you know?
---
I just want to remind you that they ported model from Watch Dogs to R6 and called it elite skin
---
I personally believe that everything except your in game stats should be able to be carried over. Like you keep all of your skins and charms but your rank gets reset, as well as everything else stat wise. I don't know if this is a good idea but Ubi likely won't do it considering it stops them from earning as much money as they are currently.

---
I had glacier on xbox, just know this...
---
It‚Äôs one of those things that I feel hasn‚Äôt been brought up enough. Epic was pressured into finally allowing cross progression in Fortnite and I wish Siege was the same. I started on Xbox, moved to PS4, and am now on PC. Had about 180 hours on Xb/PS, and all of my cosmetics are just sitting on those accounts.
---
Game did as well tbh

This game is still in the beta and it won't come out soon

Ah. Epic

I mean what Operator
---
Do you stay in bronze on purpose you dick?

its because fortnite listens to their content creators while siege only listens to pengu and king georgia...siege is money hungry
---
Nice trigger discipline
---
Ah yes, grey. Truly worth legendary status. 
---
The grip is actually nice, but you're never going to see it in-game.
---
Yeah, it sucks. Wish there was a way to transfer stuff. That's the only reason why I'm still playing on PS4.
---
It is a joke I just don't like when people take my shitposting serious
---
I was just thinking the same thing yesterday cuz im personally not a huge fan of terro hunt. It seems unused and if they did add a pract. Range i would fs use it
---
I am kinda out of the loop . Why people suddenly want to play old stuff ?
---
[^Enchance... enhance... **enchance**... **ENHANCE**](https://youtu.be/xbCWYm7B_B4?t=64)

Lol. My plat squad bans twitch and jager every game. It‚Äôs not bronze it‚Äôs smart because a lot of people who main those ops are trash with the others. We even have people quit during bam phase once they‚Äôre banned.
---

---
Yeah but I dont hear people complaining about Theme park and that map is massive!  I hated that map for the longest but eventually got used to it. And it's the complete opposite for house, I hate that map because it's too damn small.
---
Alright will do

---
I think you have a problem with your mouse DPI and Sensitivity. It looks like every tiny movement moves your mouse by a lot as if it‚Äôs on a big grid and this could be caused by having a low DPI and high sensitivity
---
1920x1080 3:2 or 16:10 80+ FOV
---
Yea it kind of does lol
---
That‚Äôs actually awesome
---
Reach was one of my top for the series.
---

---
yes ok you got me there i just suck

what does one get from karma?
---
Hahaha it does seem that way.
---
No recruit ?
---
We need this
---
As a player who spent over 1200 hours with 80+ ms ping in r6, i can vouch for this. having ur own ping being as low as possible is the best thing u can do.
---
Thanks, I wasn‚Äôt sure if he could be a problem or not.
---
are you sure it‚Äôs in beta? been out for over three years
---
put holes on the top of the wall so you can throw a c4 over it
---
Amen brotha
---
I really can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre joking or not.
---
Damn the mouse review community really banded together to put you in your place lmao
---
Or you know... add much needed updates to Thunt to begin with?
---
Black beard isn‚Äôt anywhere close to op but he‚Äôs not shit, it‚Äôs just that his gadget offers nothing to the team. It‚Äôs still pretty useful though
---
For TLDR:  
---
The server still needs to register the fact that the pinger PEEKED the corner AND THEN register the shots fired that killed you, which gives you ample time to shoot back and kill the pinger.  So if anything, the pinger's at a disadvantage since you may have peeked and/or killed him on your screen but on his side, he fired several shots before you did that got rejected since the server registers him as dead.
---
-Don‚Äôt push the button 
---
-I‚Äôm pushing the button
---
-Noooooooooo
---
If t hunt AI wasnt just shooting me through walls it woukd be just fine, but this would certainly be a good addition
---
+1, I've owned a ¬£18 mouse and keyboard combo and god damn it was bad. ¬£45 can get you a top notch mouse. I used a Rival 310 and now a G Pro Wireless, it's as much of a difference if not more than 60Hz to 144Hz in making your game feel good.
---
thank you! and yeah, i've just started learning!
---
Yeah my old mouse did that. I couldn't change it either, as it had no dpi adjustment. With my "new" one I play st like 5400dpi and 2 vertical/horizontal sensitivity lol

Keep up the good work :)

excuse me?

Jaeger you're our inside guy, when will the Germans attack?
---
1. Finding the Elite skin doesn't mean it will be the next one, might not even be the final one, Thatcher's leaked long before it's release and it was very different than the final one.
---
2. Why are you acting like the title spoils some important story twist? It's just a new skin, jesus.
---
People just believe that the server validates hits before they register movement, and the fact that people just want something to blame.
---
I was hibana and i thought "hey what if i put the defuser on a hatch and explode the hatch and it falls down?" That was a fun learning experience
---
Very nice
---
See I have the opposite feeling. I do really well almost every game and we still lose. 
---
Its impossible to escape copper/silver without a five stack
---
Idk what all these people are saying blackbeard is the most op player on siege. He is the only player that can survive not one, but two headshots. 
---
Change my mind...
---
I‚Äôd like to hear your suggestion on how to differentiate between someone leaving on purpose and being disconnected
---
Does playing clash automatically make you bad?
---
Just make old Hereford the aim train map
---
Next is miras btw
---
How did you make this? May make something for meself
---
In a game with one shot headshot, yeah it's a problem.
---
I thought so but I saw people saying that if you play him your trash which made me think that he was just super op or something. Still new to the game and this is helping me understand the community of siege. Thank you!
---
Ela has been given 8 nerfs and pretty much 0 buffs currently. Likely going to be 9 nerfs as she's high on the winrate charts even though those things are the worst way to balance the game.  In her current state she only has one good consistent thing about her in which being her shotgun. The rest of her kit is borderline shit unless it's the scorpion which is the worst primary in game.
---
Then he would look more like a school shooter
---
I usually only solo and play Zofia or Gridlock or Buck on attack (unless nobody picks a hard breach / thatcher then I'll just play who we need). On defense I play Valk or Lesion or Alibi or Jager. If I discover my entire team likes to roam and the enemy team has just walked into site the round before, I'll play Rook or Doc (this rarely happens though bc I can't stand anchoring)
---
I have a picture of someone playing with 50.000 ping
---
please tell me the picture just got smushed and this isnt your aspect ratio
---
You can‚Äôt train a god

"This is the power of Requiem"
---
Don't get me wrong, a device screening gadget sounds cool. Just needs a little balancing.
---
I think it should be affected by emps and twitch.
---
Emps would disable the grind for 10 seconds or toggle it to an off state. Defenders can reboot the grind.
---
Drones should be able to pass under the grid. Twitch can disable the grid with one taser and the second taser destroys one corner.
---
As a default, the grid should not be allowed to be combined with a castle wall. If you do, then you make a cheap strong wall that cannot be destroyed except for sledge. It would be you place a castle wall or a grid device, but not both on the same door.
---
You've got it wrong soldier, the lord is teaching Mr "steal yo grenades"
---
Ah ok, I‚Äôve played around 150 so far
---
NIGERINDAYO
---
üëå
---
Attackers have 11 elite, defenders had 10 and now a +1  which is Smoke
---
I think we'll get an attacker for the end of the next season 
---
And it could be Buck because of his being a truly important guy in the game
---
Can't wait to buy one of these, so much rain and wind coming through the wall-holes in my house. Thank god for video games !!!!
---
FYI, there already is a plague doctor skin for smoke, so this is unlikely to happen (and yes I know it does not look how you want it to look)
---
The innocence of this. You can't even be mad at this
---
No you don't. You will get the charm automatically just by watching the stream. People in chat are just trolling.
---
You aren't gonna die from knowing a skin before it releases tho lol
---
If it was electric ashs breach round would be destroyed but sledge would work
---
im just thinking warden giving his teammates glasses cases.  
---
*"I didnt put any microfiber cloth in this one,hope you'll dont get your glasses dirty."*
---
How much matches did you lose in order to get into that percentage ?
---
Also what did you get from the pack if you got it ?
---
OH MY GAWD! The next thing you will say is (insert Jojo quote)!
---
That Mira tho. In awe at the size of this lad. Absolute unit.
---
How did that roach even get in there? Did he say anything about it? xD
---
Skin cool but weapon skills awful
---
They do know that the Mira elite already got leaked on the sub reddit this morning right?
---
Thats a good thing merica baby
---
This is a whole new level of boredom.
---
Shut up uwu
---
I like your switch :)
---
The electrified castles would probably be able to be countered by placing a breach charge on the floor/wall next to it and detonating it. The same way thermite can destroy electrified hatches on some sites
---
spetzNOT.
---
Don‚Äôt you get banned after a second teamkill even if they forgive u?
---
Current Kanal is horrible. It's purely attacker favoured with 0 manoeuvrability for defenders. 
---
If you think that the 7 maps in the PL pool all play the same, then you likely haven't even watched PL:
---
Coastline never needs a hard breach. Consulate is an incredible roamer map. Clubhouse has a minimum of 3 ways to attack every site. Villa has the best vertical play of any map in the PL pool. All of those are unique to each map.
---
If you like current Kanal, that's one thing and by all means, enjoy every second of your time in the casual map pool. That's what casual is there for, fun and enjoying yourself. To say that maps like old clubhouse, house, kanal, old hereford, yacht, any of those are balanced at all, shows that you're disconnected from the part if the community that want to keep the game alive and competitive well into the future.
---
the reddit community isn‚Äôt slow and soft there‚Äôs no way to know they‚Äôre your friends and toxicity runs rampant in this game as i‚Äôm sure you know. this becomes less and less funny because it completely ruins the fun for a lot of people who just want to play the game.
---
omg that looks insane and the thatcher emp in the back...... i‚Äôm in love with them
---
Well you've answered my question from the minute I got the game. Thanks!
---
Bruh das epic
---
Dokkaebi does not need a buff
---
Castle --&gt; Give him the R4-C, see what happens
---
I like this one infinitely more than the smoke one. Like he looks like a greasy mole rat in a hoody, so fucking bad. [At least Mira doesn‚Äôt look disabled.](https://i.imgur.com/5WvgAju.)jpg
---
oh shit that's dope
---
Well someone doesn‚Äôt appreciate hard work :(
---
that is a well known C4 , was used in ProLeague and all.
---
The man who made that is a fucking genius
---
You made 4 kills so you're e sport ready? LUL
---
Looks nice!
---
Isn't that something that ubi said is a bug and they they will be removing it
---
Nope, just having fun at the convention! Couldn't pass up a shot though, all the cosplays are very well done
---
You don‚Äôt see me with five other people in the top left overlay? Lol. Why would Randy‚Äôs forgive me?  You‚Äôre not very bright.
---
I mean there's been no leaks and I don't believe there will be, Unless someone leaks everything tomorrow it's a dick move but what can ubi do about it when shit gets out?
---
I would be down, it would be so simple and fun.
---
I also get angry at people that use other headphones than the one from the console package. People that spend money on another headset (or any other peripheral) are blatantly cheating /s.
---
Can it stick?
---
The hair is so bad...
---
Wait so why did everyone else get the friendly fire warning?
---
Does it work, its sick even if it doesn't
---
they dont need to even mind it. they can plant defuser somewhere else in the room
---
Kind of but it didn't really fit his lore much at all with the whole iron man thing
---
Is this real
---
I hope that was a joke
---
Did you make this yourself or buy it? It looks great either way!
---
how about no. Dokkaebi doesn‚Äôt need a buff.
---
Idk but they‚Äôd have to change the range on his explosion since it‚Äôs large enough to overlap and it would probably lead to him creating smaller holes
---
Thank you!
---

---
alright so how many games did you throw just to try and get some karma.
---
Try shooting an Ash round at an electrified barb wire. The ash round still works
---
It's not a functional camera, sadly :( Maaaaaybe in the future.
---
Yikes
---
so...basically what everyone else has predicted....
---
Again..close enough, both have under ground garage and server rooms, both are rectangular shape, both have office areas, both are three stories
---
Looks like lion and i've been too tired to not realize that a smoke with that skin is my teammate lion.
---
Switched from console too back in December. As unoriginal as it sounds, terrorist hunts are so essential when it comes to adjusting to MnK. Your game sense is likely still there, but PC is 10x faster than console when it comes to gun fights. Focus on your speed more than anything. There is way less room for error on PC.

Not having a family thay cares about you

This is not ubisoft‚Äôs decision. Sony and Microsoft will 100% say no.
---
Isn't this a repost? I swear I saw this same clip a few weeks ago. Perhaps they were just very similar with the drone bouncing up there.
---
That's a cock for a nose.
---
out of every operator whom does not have an elite yet, you go for dokkaebi.
---
B R U H
---
The games theme? You're kidding me. The dude literally has a furry outfit. Blitz has a fucking clown mask. Fuze has a World War skin, IQ is in a damn workout outfit. If they wanted money they woulda gave us a good looking plague doctor outfit so that smoke would actually look as intimidating as he should be.
---
I enjoy it, but an option for the hood to be up would be nice. I never understood why people wanted a plauge doctor, they didn't gas people
---
I'm not paying for those
---
I probably draw the line at using a mouse and keyboard on console tbf, given that it does actually give you an advantage?
---
No, GipfelYeti has ascended-not you. 
---
Or me sadly.
---
lol
---
you gotta go to garage on house and do a hole in the celing above the boat , then aim at the far garage door and toss it behind your back , should land perfectly.
---
THIS IS THE SHIT THEY SHOULD FIX NOT ADDING NEW GADGETS AND BULLSHIT REEEEEE
---
you forgot the 600 ping avg?? and the 0-3 loss because your team plays worse than a blind rock??
---
Who‚Äôs the operator in the orange shirt?
---
No I have it
---
Maybe the fact they have 10000 ping, it legit impossible to have WiFi that bad
---
Nah that is an old one but still nice
---
console players be like

Correcting someone's spelling when they ask why your opinion is shit

Fucking Yikes

So many teammates will die because of twitch drones smh ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Practice. Took me 50levels before I got good.
---
(also lower ur sens, most newbies use way too high a sens on PC, Id use 400dpi,8,8,83, it seems slow at first but is easy to master)
---
Because skin after skin it gets worse.
---
shower\*
---
its mostly my shooting and holding the proper angles that need worked on

Sometimes it says I have 24000 ping but everything is running fine

Toxic

Stim pistol with acog new doc buff

OMG that would be awesome!!!!
---
Touche
---
Defending A funny man recruit main because recruit is the funny operator, if you play him you are INSTANTLY funny
---
The problem with changing Warden's speed to make him better (as many have suggested previously) is that it basically straight up admits that being 3 amour is the worst thing a character can be. The focus should be more on his gadget and weapon(s) so that he can successfully fit into the anti-smoke/flash role (which sadly, his gadget and weapons mean he is lacking slightly)
---
Doc/Rook are 3 armour, but both have a great weapon + great gadget, similar to Echo and Mira. Speed overall in this game is a bit of a contentious area, which I don't think anyone would've seen coming when the game was released.
---
It‚Äôs different when you have 10000+ ping for 30 seconds and 1 second
---
beaulo may be nuts in ranked (and a good entry fragger for PL) but he's overrated..and G2 is still a well oiled facefucking machine..You're putting way too much faith in beaulo rn. He's been in PL what a few months? if that?
---
Yeah that shit would be spookier
---
for that i'd say just always watch your killcams when you get shot from some random spot. Also change your sens if it's still on the default settings. If you're spinning all over the place slow it down, if not, try speeding it up
---
That‚Äôs pretty funny, good thing they were your friends so they were pretty chill!
---
Ohhhhhhh Shit. 
---
They better win now or they‚Äôre never going to live this down.
---
So if someone‚Äôs internet cuts out and their ping spikes super high and then they leave we should assume they were ddosd
---
If you need to correct words, it doesn‚Äôt bode well for your argument üòÇ And someone can‚Äôt take a jokeüòòüòò Little silver feeling insecure?

---
Bro bro bro dont call yourself insecure thats not nice
---
Wow no one likes you on this chat huh?
---
That‚Äôs a big Yikes
---
I don't think you got kicked because you were Smoke. The community is toxic and you can get kicked for just about anything. Some people get into a 4 stack and kick the 5th person just because. The best thing you can try to do is ignore it and play with other people if that's possible.
---
wait is this a new glitch?
---
It's called _social anxiety_
---
If it's toxic enough
---
Not to be rude or anything but we basically knew the release date about a month ago.
---
Wow you really aren‚Äôt good at arguments are you... little silver üòò
---
Would also be nice to enable metrics, like bullet travel distance, bullet hitscan box, colored impact marks on the enemies and damage dealt plus having 3 differently armored targets for the damage modifiers and another set with rook armor.
---
Yeah all the banana outfits look like that too me
---
I actually like these colors. They go well together.
---
Gonna get me some wood seasonal skins, heck yeah.
---
They'll still reinforce it. No matter how many impacts you yeet against it. 
---
Wall. Must. Reinforce

Restart the game

That's because like 98% of redditors are special needs losers who confide in each other and have the worst opinions

---
And that's comin from u/LocalRetard89
---
I thought it was red and black, I hope it‚Äôs not this that tan color is kinda gross
---
I was waiting for someone to pull that card, you're being added to my collection
---
But so does a surround headset and a scuff controller. 
---
I‚Äôm 70% deaf (can‚Äôt hear gadgets, utility or footsteps) and have a funny hand due to a break when I was younger and the bones fused back together at a weird angle - makes for holding a controller for more than 30 mins extremely uncomfortable.
---
Would I put me at an advantage to use m&amp;k?
---
Next gen consoles need to fully embrace m&amp;k and then the user can decide their preferred method of gaming.
---
Higher ranks is almost all m&amp;k and they generally play each other. You‚Äôre in that zone where there‚Äôs a crossover with controller I guess.
---
Great idea warden seems broken
---
&gt; This entire meta is based on plant denial
---
How so? Echo is basically banned all the time and Smoke has always been a must play even just because he brings site destruction.
---
Maestro cams are mostly used for intel gathering, not plant denial.
---
Both work since you don't know how they're being targeted and considering both DDoS and DoS do the same thing it doesn't matter what you say.
---
Why do my legs hurt when I look at this image?
---
Aaaaand there goes any hope I had of NOt having recycled weapons.
---
Agreed. Casual is more fun. Ranked is super serious
---
Kill cam shows she threw it through the barricade.  Yikes.  I wish kill cams were more consistent.
---
If the shoe fits...
---
Perhaps, but it likely is intended to limit human suffering, as any weapons that are designed to cause significant amounts of pain without quickly killing a person are illegal (such as mines, traps, chemicals, etc.), with the exception of guns and ordnance.
---
This is genius I love it. Would ubi actually implement this?
---
All that for a screenshot that's already been posted here several times?
---
Valid
---
Well then I guess they changed it.. I played early on White Noise and was told to sign an agreement to not say anything.. maybe they loosened it because hackers are data mining everything anyways
---
F respect for you man

Long time ago me and my friend got some 1v1 on planes. I was a beginner at that time, so I didn't know that I can't shoot through that windows. My friend missed(with glaz) and I was spraying with a P90 ar him aaand I got the kill. It was unbelivable.
---
TL;DR Yes, you can shoot through holes that glaz makes
---
If you have at least half decent aim or game sense, it takes them so long to reach a point where they can spawnpeek that you can easily prepare for them

Ooh I like this a lot

Honestly the only time I get killed by spawn peeks is when I already saw it in prep and just dicked the dog trying to challenge it. It‚Äôs pretty rare to get spawn peeked when you‚Äôre ready for it and watching out for it.  Most of the time the attackers have the advantage, if they are prepared or expecting it.
---
\*Tachanka can now penetrate shields\*
---
The fuck
---
This is real?
---
I think that we know based on the video. From what I saw, the defender has an explosive pack he can put on shields, and he attacker can vault through windows. We don‚Äôt know how many explosive packs he will get, or what exactly she can vault through. The video gave us a good idea though. They will definitely change how the game is played
---
I thought this was real and I was hyped

Lmao gold two this season, probably one of my worse games
---
Seeing as how the stuck debris isnt expected to be fixed until next year, i doubt theyre gonna add anything of significance. How long has this game been out for? 4 years? And not fixing something as broken as that till next year
---
Welcome.
---
source?
---
Yeah you can definitely counter it its not overpowered its just dumb game design IMO. Its not fun for anyone involved and just promotes hilarious clips of gameplay like this one
---
Honestly warden just needs an acog and his gadget to be passive and he would be fine.
---
Word.
---
Really though, just ignore it and play. It's that simple.
---
For me it's the hair honestly
---
Omg that‚Äôs amazing! I will definitely try and buy something when I have enough money, I‚Äôm very broke right now :(
---
They could call it mad moose. Its so obvious I can't believe they haven't already. Its probably in the works.
---
I guess the devs gone lazy and wanna milk as much money as they can from game now. Time to move on to a new game.
---
Warden is far too op
---
Tachanka and castle would be great the idea for warden is cool but seems a little strong
---
Lol what? I‚Äôm not trying to have a debate. I‚Äôm just disagreeing with you.
---
He means the recoil pattern is ideal to control and get the best possiblity of headshots
---
Ubisoft needs to reward a 5 pack of guaranteed no dupe legendaries if somebody manages to get 100%
---
They previously said they can't have two different operators with the same gun have different attachment options. The defender couldn't have Kaid's shotgun without an ACOG
---
Ohh no not again. I hope this is a old pic.
---
That then ruins the game for the other team. You should only play ranked if you have time and internet for it. If you have to leave for somewhere in 15 minutes, don‚Äôt play ranked. If you‚Äôre internet has been shitty all day, or you lag out regularly, don‚Äôt play ranked
---
For Warden, I just think he shouldn‚Äôt have to stand still to see through smoke, and I like the idea that any enemies he shoots while his glasses are active get rapid pinged Alibi style for a second after taking damage.
---
I feel that would have good synergy with low damage of the mpx, and provide visibility and information for the team without giving them the full anti-nade buff.

Honestly I like the idea because testing out the different weapons part, everyone had *their* gun that feels super comfortable and that establishes what your main really is.
---
Ehhh
---
Agreed. He does not deserve nearly the amount of hate he gets.
---
i dont like the castle one
---
Okay I‚Äôll try
---
To me yeah, we know it's a hook; not an axe.
---
That map sucks
---
I've lost a round on defense because our last guy tried to destroy the defuser conventionally when it was on a soft hatch and he had a shotgun
---
you can use msi afterburner
---
I just think they could have gone a completely different route with a plague doctor skin, symbolizing his Arsine as the black death, it killing g anything it touches and it supposedly doesn't kill him because the lore that the beak of the plague doctor outfit allows them to breathe without getting infected, combine that with a cool ending screen animation and that shit would sell like crazy. The current one, in my opinion is horrible, but some do like it, yes, I like that it actually includes the chemical compound of his gas on it, as closure I suppose, but it just doesn't feel right. They could have even done a world war 2 gas suit, which also look terrifying as shit, although in this game they may look a little goofy
---
Oh yeah Ela having the worst primary in game the Scorpion which is the only primary with a random stat is fair, or her having one of the worst pistols that all the stats basically negate the fact that it has a sight. Or she needing to be a very mobile operator but is given two stationary gadgets she can't use. Or having very lackluster mines. Yeah fair.
---
Did the game's server crash and everyone in the lobby have a ridiculous ping out of nowhere? 
---
If yes, then probably not on purpose.
---
No, not my feet shooter
---
Ying
---
the warden idea is the only one i have an issue with, castle and the lord look great though
---
I don't like Wardens changes. He isn't a Rook and I don't want to play a game where I kill Warden, call it out but its meaningless because the remaining 4 defenders that can include a Mira and a Smoke can see through smoke and are resistant to flash bangs. Too much. The slits idea for Castle like what we are going to get on the new deployable shields is also too much.
---
Ying is good if you play with a squad and can coordinate but if you solo the n√∏kk
---
I‚Äôm not exaclty tech savvy, so I‚Äôve tried just deleting it off steam and redownloading it... twice, same result
---
not the map that's annoying, the fact that he's teleporting is.
---
Sure.... Then increase his damage then.  The icon is pretty much the biggest part of his traps, the damage is negligible
---
Honestly all warden needs it to be able to run with his ability active
---
The kill is hardly impressive when both of you blow thru almost 3 full mags each...
---
Now teach that to an automated computer
---
dont worry if you're in america shooting in school is pretty normal there
---
n√∏kk if you can play her correctly
---
Yeah but remember that's worldwide, and it doesn't mention what percentage is active, I play in SCUS and if you want to find a game Monday through Friday (except in the evening) you have to wait at least 10-20 min meanwhile in Overwatch for example you only have to wait a couple of seconds.
---
The random choice discourages AFK behavior while limiting the ramifications of just going recruit. Not being able to choose an op is the price people pay for being afk. It‚Äôs balanced imo, and I feel like a favorite system will just promote afk behavior rather than a fluid changing pick decision as the clock runs down.
---
Imagine using one of the maybe three examples of such a thing happening. Psychos that use real, loaded guns in scenes are clearly not what I'm talking about.
---
They don't, this is just some kid's fantasy buffs.
---
*sad lion noises*
---
&gt; i just hate their toxicity
---
Ya, PC games have 0 toxicity whatsoever.
---
/s
---
Give a great attacker gun to a defender
---
Maybe they could have like a dog flap that opens only when a defenders ability are tying to pass like echo's drone or a mozzie controlled drone and if not chances are they will probably still be another door to get your drone out of
---

---
No problem, thankfully i paid attention during my system networking class or I would probably be in the same position. It can definitely be confusing
---
Awwwww man, these seamed really cool,
---
That argument is invalid because of the differing fire rates making some guns objectively better and worse than others
---
I know, it's a big problem, but if it's ranked, just call it out then
---
Not only are you late but you‚Äôre wrong
---
I caved and bought it when LGPikachu was announced.
---
They all sound really OP, but I understand the want, Warden is the worst operator in the game, give him smokes or even let his glasses work while moving
---
All of them all ok, just don't let Warden give glasses to all the team. It would be OP.

Do you think you could give better instruction on the perm fix? For me rn it just doesn‚Äôt seem to work

Fortress it worst map, its bad like from attackers side and from defenders so it must be deleted. What about outback its a lot better than fortress but not suitable for rank

I was considering a rework to Blackbeard in a similar vein. The idea is that instead of his cardboard shield, he gets an all-purpose defense kit. This kit is placed down by him when he wants, allowing 2 people (likely him and whoever spawned next to him) a defense kit. This defense kit, when taken, grants the user 3 wood window/door reinforcements and one wall reinforcement. This would make him a cool new op for setting up safe zones to siege from, or closing rotation holes if you gain control of site. It has a lot of possibilities, and it plays into Blackbeard‚Äôs theme of being a defensive, safe op, as well as his name. Blackbeard was a pirate and thief, and our Blackbeard steals the ability defenders normally have.
---
It wasn't the spelling
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  
---
Round 10 won  
---
Enemies eliminated
---
How will I know if I got the drop or not?
---
if you‚Äôre trying to start out then just havta wait it out and start a new game with that lobby or play ranked
---
These all sounds like great improvements. But since the new ops already need buffs/Nerfs/reworks it will be ages before we see big changes to these ops
---
You have to remember that from a broad angle shielded characters are basically unkillable. They have to be balanced in some way
---
These are terrible EXCEPT electrifying barricades, that sounds hella cool, the rest is either useless or stupidly op
---
What a tease manüò©
---
i dont play the game but hearing Tachanka getting a rework is a great move
---
I like the tackanka rework except the large magazine, I think it‚Äôs fine where it is, warden rework is fine except socialized ice glasses, that‚Äôs just too op, and castle shouldn‚Äôt be a Mira 2.0 everything else is exactly what I think should happen to these ops

---
You're not wrong whatsoever I just hate the toxicity in ranked and I don't have a mic for lobbies
---
It's a weird situation
---
u know we can see the thing on your right hand üßê
---
That's fine and dandy, but the MPX is really that bad. It's a very middle of the road fire rate, low damage gun. The only thing it has going for it is it's moderate recoil. 
---
There are only 2 guns with worse dps in the game worse than the MPX. The M12 for cav and the P90.  
---
"But it's good for headshots!" So is literally every other gun in the game. It is just statistically one of the worst automatic defender weapons in the game.
---
No, that is on you not knowing how to use them properly. 
---
At high ranks Monty is banned nearly every game, because he is so annoying and broken to face.
---
The problem with this is that he can still you much earlier. So even if the shots don't register instantly.. He can still peak and put his crosshair on you before you even see him. This is still a huge advantage, which is also evident in day to day play.
---
Pretty good ideas
---
It's not real.
---
Blitz could work with underbarrel flashlight but Monty could be like clash with full shield without gun for primary and give him an assault rifle or smf as secondary
---
best of luck

Your MMR gain/loss is determined by 3 factors--who won, how likely that result was, and your uncertainty value.  That uncertainty value decreases the more games you play during a season.  And, in my experience, is the primary factor in how large the adjustment to your MMR is.
---
Stupid ideas. Tachanka will never be viable, he's fine as a meme now. Warden's suggestion is fucking broken AND a global ablity which don't belong in this game. Castle's suggestion is just fucking broken. He's fine as is. You can't make him viable for your silver soloQ ranked games.
---
Did I specify my tool

I‚Äôm sorry but I think your alone

Ugh always am

---
He caught it whilst at the Majors, and got Pengu to sign the box. Also Pengu is from Denmark
---
Yeah that includes echo and Mozzie drones headass
---
Tachanka now will be the one of the best operators for defense.
---
You're in the r6 subreddit. I can guarantee you that's not why no one's laughing
---
I know, my point is that I'm not paying more on a game I can barely find games only on the weekend, which is why for me paying real money for cosmetics is a silly concept at this point in time.
---
Feels bad :(
---
Now we know whats in the canister niw he must kill us
---
God forbid someone spells glaz wrong due to auto correct.
---
Ubi has literally said in the past that standing still is unviable mechanic to have with an op. That's his entire problem. If he could move while using his gadget, he would be fine. He doesn't need an entire rework.
---
GO ! STIM PISTOLS
---
Unluckiest luckiest r6 player on earth
---
If I wanted to flex, I'd show off my RGB Printer enclosure ;)
---
I guess when you put it that way but instead make it to where you can only get it if you win your last 10 games and loss gain doesn‚Äôt count
---
Can you next time make a coherent sentence for once
---
Why not just block them and move on?
---
If we do get those Deployable shield rework lord could be a good viable operator and I'm already thinking of good places where this could work
---
Awesome. Thanks
---
Fuck blitz
---
Merica
---
It‚Äôs not technically war it‚Äôs just terrorism I think is what it is in lore
---
Castle needs a rework tbh
---
He should be 2/2, he‚Äôs the worst DLC defender ever added lmao, I‚Äôll take this over release Ela though I guess
---
The buff suggestion on front page right now is a disgrace though, this sub doesn‚Äôt know this game at all
---
Eh, just got pissed. I don‚Äôt take insults from random people nicely
---
[REDACTED]
---
He would need a new gun. Giving the SMG an ACOG also gives it to Kapkan.

LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED {T}7
---
Okay. i will take your criticism. and take your word on Monty being good at 1v1. What do you then think of the other shield operators. too much? broken? (negativly or not.)
---
Why is not a counter arguement.
---
&gt; Now 3 rotates between buildings instead of one (and one supposedly underground)
---
Good. This was Kanal's biggest problem, even considering the number of windows. I really do hope they've taken out the stupid rooftop too or made it less important by removing windows. I can't stand people staying up there for 3 minutes, wasting everyone's time.
---
I'm not going to stop playing the game because of this, I love it too much, but as for the year 5 season pass, unless they really give me a reason to buy it, forget about it.
---
Is that a joke? From a spreadsheet perspective the MPX is quite weak, but as far as being practically effective at getting headshots it is better than a slew of guns: the UMP, the M12, The K1A, Kaid‚Äôs Aug, Mozzie‚Äôs Commando, the 9mm C1, the FMG, and arguably a couple others like the MP5k, the Spetsnaz 9x19VSN, and even Jagers M416-C. The consistent dps of the K1A and the M416-C make them much stronger overall, but pretending like a gun with 830 rpm and easy recoil is bad is ignorant, and too focused on spreadsheets. It has above average rate of fire and is easy to control in a game with one-shot headshots. It‚Äôs not great compared to guns like the MP5, the MP7, or the M416-C but it‚Äôs still a perfectly serviceable gun.

Maybe removing hipfire?

---
esports ready with all these crashes
---
Tachanka and Castle are really good. As for warden - I play him a lot myself and all he needs is freedom of movement while using his gadget. His gadget was designed to deny the attacker's opportunity of advancing with the help of flash or smoke, but, well, if they try to use smoke, they will almost always get through, because standing still in the middle of hallway is a suicide regardless whether you can see them or not, this is the reason why i never do it, but something like this is what devs thought his gadget would be good for. If you want him to be good for this kind of situation, remove the instant buff loss penalty, and instead give him like 2 seconds before it will start to wear off.
---
None of these would work they are all way too op
---
Limit Tachanka‚Äôs buffs to just the deplorable shield mount and the Lord is golden.
---
Ubi, please fix Warden. He‚Äôs such a good concept with horrid execution. These suggestions are good, in my opinion; I don‚Äôt care if they make him OP. You can always nerf later because right now, it‚Äôs hard to go lower than the bottom.
---
I think Castle‚Äôs already in a good spot, meta-wise. I don‚Äôt understand the want to bar drones from entry when you have Mozzie/prep-phase Mute.
---
but don't put it near your devices or your devices is going dark
---
That's totally not a fair comparison. That's if Jager can give each teammate their own unlimited ADS that they can use while running around. You don't see how busted that would be?
---
He tried to mute his toxic teammates.
---
You got a new main
---
Does it stick?
---
I love this
---
Tachanka would be OP if your the current was in a corner.
---
That‚Äôs a weird ass pokeball
---
I love all of em, warden may become too good if he can give everyone that ability, ying and blitz would be literally useless. If warden is the only one who can have the glasses he‚Äôll be pretty balanced
---
Awesome! Thanks for just adding to how bad the community is!
---
Real men spawn peak with a magnum
---
I love this concept. The only piece of criticism I have would be that with that building you will get spawnpeeked from everywhere.
---
Mute them and put on subtitles?
---
Problem is guns are a part of the operator. Warden and Nokk aren't weak just because of their gadgets but their guns as well.
---
This comment is nothing but gibberish.
---
mute them lol
---
Yeah that buff is way too much. Swings it the other way round completely.
---
I guess an ACOG since he's 1/3 rn would be asking too much?
---
Nice switch in the back
---
What platform are you on
---

I didn't play new dawn as fc5 annoyed me so much. Is the plot of new dawn better than 5?

Also, being kidnapped in the air is kinder stupid :/.
---
I won't be able to hear the ingame sounds. But sounds like the best solution atm.
---
This season is the worst for sure atleast for me, PS4 diamond is full of DDOSers and MnK (already used to MnK but might as well mention it) and these operators suck ass
---
In a good sense or bad sense? Cause u have to admit the song was a hit
---
I don't know about that. I'm not too good at this game even after playing since velvet shell
---
*laughs in black ops*
---
Tachanka should be able to penetrate Shields
---
No it doesn‚Äôt, ubi said ACOG‚Äôs on defense are for one speeds only, kapkan is a 2 speed, tachanka is 1 speed so ACOG makes sense
---
what are the odds haha nice
---
Well you lose a lot of games ,
---
Blitz is just annoying to face, usually easy to take down unless they coordinate a push on you well.
---
Monty is broken af.
---
Fuze shield, same as Blitz really. 
---
Clash is fine where she is, they need to make Monty function like her.
---
Nice. But I'd really rather see the plague doctor concept being made into his elite. Well that's gone now.
---
Maybe limit the glasses you can give out to 3, including Warden's pair.
---
Oooooooo, we got a detective from r/quityourbullshit here, stand back, this is a crime scene.
---
Yeti is really interesting.
---
Nah castle needs to let drones through for echo
---
castle would be so dope. The no drones would be a bit too much but i think 100% need more compatibility with newer ops.
---
An addition to the tachanka change: instead of using mags, maybe have it belt fed, eliminating reload and making it feel more like the ww2 era LMG it was going for.
---
And therein lies the problem with reusing operator guns.
---
people might think ACOG on mpx is OP, gun is a laser beam, I‚Äôd be fine with it though
---
I‚Äôm not sure about how good he‚Äôd be, but I‚Äôd be cool with either 1/3 ACOG, or make him 2/2
---
I really wasn‚Äôt mad, I was actually laughing when he ignored every point I made. The fact that he REPORTED ME FOR RETALIATING was literally funny. I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to get banned. I use Xbox app to talk, so I could just use that to talk. It was all just funny
---
beaulo
---
I see higher tier ranked players using him retardedly all the time. Honestly, even when he's used "well" he is more of a detriment than anything. And I'm not allowed to play a game or two of casual before people get on? If I can't play casual than they shouldn't be allowed to use castle.
---
The warden buff would destroy the meta
---
Yeah

Payday 2 had this as a feature, but for siege I can see issues arising

Omg this is literally one of the best reworks/buffs to ops I‚Äôve seen
---
scoopity woop
---
Oh I know those guys. I usually just follow them around with live hand grenades.
---
\*swoon\*

What rank are you
---
What if like Glaz‚Äôs ability you have to stand still to let it activate so when picking up say Wardens glasses you need to hold down an angle or be still in a flash situation to use said glasses. That way it enables defenders to advantage from it by having a drone in the room they are flashing to kill the person who is standing still trying to use the advantage of the glasses.
---
I'm not saying you can't play casual. I'm just saying don't complain that an op is used wrong or you get bad players using him.
---
Currently in Plat.
---
Yeah but if your droned out (which you almost always will be in higher ranks) your fucked, especially if they have frags.
---
*all the other kids*
---
nope but few of us actually like it
---
pls ubi let me get something good instead of dupes :(
---
Yea I used to play ps4 and was a plat 2, moved to Pc about 4 months ago and hit plat 2 at level 50. I guess i was immediately good on Oc since I used to play csgo a lot and knew how to aim.
---
Indeed.
---
nope
---
Nope, they aren‚Äôt breaking any rules. If you encounter afk players I would suggest leaving the match and finding another one

Hello moinimran6, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/crdtub/servers_crash_in_500000_dollar_r6_tournament/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It would be a broken but great experience
---
cool
---
Imagine the pain of the elite one...yikes
---
Jojokes
---
Damn I'll take it I love the ar 15
---
"Dad that's him! That's who took my lunch money!"
---
I cant believe that cs doesn't automatically rebuy if I die. We're missing this basic quality of life feature because the devs want us to actually play the game before the end of the buy period. It's truly ridiculous.
---
Luck. There's no hacks on PS4, just MnK users.
---
Throw it at the ceiling and struggle to get it back
---
I agree. People had a similar problem with the IQ elite and now it's one of the most popular skins in the game
---
*Flashbang through the store!*
---
I bought the standard addition and it took me 8 months of crazy grinding.
---
I  mean, I wouldn't mind  it if  they  introduced it as a feature   and pretty  much all  of my friends just used   a macro that  purchased everything   they needed  for   them.
---
Wait, recruit doesnt have claymores and impacts
---
Wot
---
Please tell me that's an actual camera!!!
---
Toxic jagers: Not bad kid.
---
No, that's a component that I purchase separately and combine with the 3D-printed parts.
---
I cannot print this clear. Yet.
---
Battle of the Fates is going to be silently playing in the background for the whole set
---
Make another one lol jk good work looks nice and does it actually work or is it ascetic only?
---
U come from Chernobyl ir what?
---
&gt; Let's hope ~~they don't make it an Elite Skin but rather one you can purchase with renown in October's Halloween event, I don't care about animations at the end of the match or any other crap.~~
---
for something so far outside of the realm of possibility we are sure to be disappointed no matter how good the skin is. FTFY
---
why do we exist? seriously though. whats the point then hahaha
---
That's... That's the point...
---
Muahaha, I can touch my ceiling with my fingertips ;D This camera ain't getting away from me!
---
Just noticed that Beaulo liked the post
---
Afraid not, but I'll be looking into it ;)
---
That would be lit
---
I‚Äôm soooo close, congrats my man
---
Castle would be too much, i can already imagine the frustration of attacking like aviator/games on villa with full bandit, kaid, castle and mute. If you don't have a thatcher you're fucked
---
old but gold
---
This one is the 15th I've made! They're all out in the world, in the hands of amazing cosplayers in the RS6 community.
---
It's aesthetics only I'm afraid.
---
I always take the surprise first shot, miss it and all following shots then get blasted into the shadow realm by someone that actually knows how to aim.
---
It's still something.
---
Blyat
---
The pulse is very realistic
---
As of rn TSM won a single round and its round 6 on the first map...
---
Dammit I thought this was real, think tachanka would be good but idk about putting it on a shield.
---
Couple questions:
---
How would you intend the other defenders use the glasses (assuming they have to be toggled) would you just add another button for this?
---
Allowing only Zofia and Sledge to open a castle barricade without being damaged seems crazy, especially with a mirror on it as well, I think the mirror could work but electrocuting it seems very strong
---
Dont play ranked enough to know whether or not she works after gold 2 but that is definately not gold 2 or above gameplay no matter how hard you try to convince me that it is I wont believe it.
---
Literally in a few months everyone is gonna love the skin
---
I dare you to throw it at a wall
---
please just tell us
---
I had happen to me on Fuze's AK as well.
---
Here's an example: If someone is on a 2 second delay on their actions, both you and the server see the peek 2 seconds late. Wouldn't his bullets ALSO register 2 seconds late from the time he shot it or does the server somehow magically prioritize hit validation above all else?
---
Oh I get it cause you can‚Äôt see him on cameras
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
so we wanna make castle into a god instead of a operator? castle would probably have more viability than a mira would
---
I feel like Castle's 1st and 3rd change should be there at the start
---
I don‚Äôt know
---
Theres a point were you have to give up the meme my friend.
---
Perfection
---
This is an advanced shitpost
---
it seems like something that would be breaking any kind of rules, especially as they are clearly using external tools to get around the afk kick
---
Well not blocking them is counterproductive.
---
Make the LORD'S helmet give him a second chance against a headshot.
---
What if like iq could see people wearing the glasses and thatcher could disable the glasses for a bit
---
I mean Kanto when ENCE won I think it was a season finale or SI
---
I dare argument Caveira‚Äôs ability *isn‚Äôt* Silent Step; but that she has a full kit. Interrogations being the core of it, then all tools to get interrogations going, silent step, not being able to be properly tracked, and a special pistol that forces injure state.
---
Vigil and Alibi are super dissapointing to me, compared to the better gadgets on defense theirs are basically useless and they‚Äôre on the map cause they are 3 speeds with impacts and a non-shit gun.
---
You could take away silent step from caveira and she‚Äôd still have unique features. Any way you look at it I think one-button gadgets are plain boring and lazy, whether they are global or not, overpowered or underpowered; I wanna see actual ‚Äústuff‚Äù be ‚Äúdeployed‚Äù if possible.
---
There's Mozzie and Mute, plus shooting drones.
---
There's no need for another thing to stop drones. Plus this hurts Echo and Mozzie drones, and of course takes out most of the risk of placing breach charges onto Castle barricades.
---
#Heilige Schei√üe
---
Cav's M12 and Fuze's AK are currently glitched. They will probably be fixed soon.
---
If you watch pro league streams instead of going to the event you are a certified casual.
---
Just give the lord 5 speed on his turret and everything will be fine
---
I can get an ace with clash but that doesn't mean shes a good operator.
---
It‚Äôs just a common sound glitch it‚Äôs been happening since the beginning of this operation
---
Actually no √¥\_√µ
---
I did reply in another comment, that suggested not blocking drones whilst still be electrifiable, that it would be a nice buff for Castle and Kaid but not impact Bandit aa much so yea, I agree it would still be a good idea, especially if enemy drones that pass under were destroyed (but not Mozzie or Yokai Drones).
---
Implying you are there?
---
Yes cause her and I can‚Äôt remember who use the same gun
---
Rook stole Doc's kill
---
It only worked cuz they didnt even see U
---
POPINCAPS28 if you're ever down to play (I cant right now I'm suck lmao)
---
Haha, Recruit is so funny, just like Tachanka...amirite fellas?
---
I played her and it only shot one
---
if you mean the six charms for watching the majors this weekend they will not be given until the 20th actually
---
Ight
---
I thought this was real and too good to be true until I read the caption
---
Lol. My reaction the too
---
Yes yes I agree with you
---
***But don't you dare slander the p90***
---
~w~ I dont know what you're referring to
---
Castle needs a deployable shield again
---
The warden buff would be so stupidly OP. Fuck no.
---
Virgin MP5 spawnpeeker vs chad Magnum spawnpeeker
---
Why does she keep losing her impacts
---
Make warden a 2-2 and give him a slightly higher damage gun and it‚Äôs balanced
---
True
---
Castles problem is that he works great at high level, he‚Äôs perfectly balanced, but low rank players understandably suck at him, he requires map knowledge and effective communication, it‚Äôs not their fault their bad at him, he‚Äôs just an odd combination where he is at first low skill, but as you progress can become extremely effective. The devs have discussed this publicly afaik. Warden would be completely busted, just give the man a P90 and buff the smoke vision, and boom he‚Äôs useful. I‚Äôm down with Tachanka tho
---
You didnt even mention a stronger glass for tachanka? 3 glaz shots and it's gone
---
Same, I didn't look at the subreddit and scanning down the image it totally programmed my expectations of what was being held.
---
I don't know man, it's really nice and fits his character well. It's like the IQ elite skin, people didn't like it when it came out, but a couple of months down the line it'll be super popular.
---
Ironic how his name is YouDidNothingWrong
---
I dont usually but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But when mixed it turns into a gas until it essentially ‚Äúevaporates‚Äù away from the chemical change.
---
I actually like this aspect as it negates smoke plants on bomb sites. Like comment above mentioned you give up a j√§ger mira or cab for the warden and counter smoke plants in garage.
