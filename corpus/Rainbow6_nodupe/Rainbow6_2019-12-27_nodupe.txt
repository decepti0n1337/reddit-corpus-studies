---
Ahh, I'd focus on trying to help them learn the game and getting into it while having as much fun as possible. We have the same issue at the moment but we just play unranked and laugh with the new people on how they play but help them learn.
---
BURN IT.
---
Where can I buy one of those?
---
Lol imagine the just dumping a pile of Legos out of a bin. That animation alone
---
For the satisfaction
---
Oh boy, can't wait to to see more commons in packs.
---
Deluxe edition starts you with the season 1 operators already unlocked. There are 8, normally costing 10k renown each. When playing casual you usually get around 150 renown for a loss and 300+ for a win.
---
Standard has no operators unlocked to start with.
---
There are base game operators (Pathfinders) that cost 1k renown each which will probably be your first purchases with either pack, deluxe gives you a nice headstart though.
---
There are training missions called situations that will get you around 10k renown for completing them which helps grab some base game operators early on.
---
If I was buying the game today, I would get the deluxe edition.
---
No problem, it's a very cool comic
---
First time?
---
I mean the other 3 CTU's that don't exist are CBRN, GSUTR and APCA aren't real and when ubi don't wanna add a real life CTU they'll make up their own
---
Bartlet University. Well god damn.
---
Huh, guess we all are deep down not protected by the GC.
---
*Picks smoke*
---
You have done Mother Russia proud comrade
---
Rejoice, and come share this vodka with me
---
You have to use an emulator to trick the console into thinking it is a controller. It is cheating and Ubi has said as much.
---
I would pay for a Tachanka in an Addis tracksuit.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs cheating on console. You have to use an emulator to trick the console to think it is using a controller. Ubi has said it is cheating.
---
But they are present in form of operators, nighthaven is shown off bigger and it‚Äôs unrelated to rainbow story wise, that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs not good
---
What is perfect. I don‚Äôt see anything
---
Squeaky toy barbed wire. Just makes that shrill squeak when something is moving in the area.
---
Awww why do you have to wait so long?
---
Cuz I already opened my Christmas gift and I didn‚Äôt have all Operators yet
---
Well I think it only applies to actual war and civilians, not police activity, since that what a lot of counter terrorism counts as. But terrorists are "illegal combatants" so they're fucked pretty much
---
1 out 10
---
Ohhh I see, I don‚Äôt know if they do this every year though unfortunately, at least I don‚Äôt remember it last year
---
Imagine equpping it with christmass lights and other decorations
---
Oh dang it
---
I thought Ela is more thicc lol
---
The curiosity rover has better internet
---
That‚Äôs true. Who ever said you had to use the bright yellow part of the flip sight, or even the flip sight at all?
---
Because year 5 will have a story to it until 2021
---
Yeah, sorry :/ idk tho, this might be something they start doing :-)
---
He just looks like bandit.
---
Yeah I hope so
---
Thanks for the belated Christmas gift, OP! /s
---
Change your t hunt settings to only the maps in ranked (which you can see if you go r3 on ranked and explore that submenu) and play on t hunt classic. I also personally play bomb only to get more practise since that's the only mode in ranked.
---
oh god
---
Signal Jammer transition was orgasmic. Pardon my language.
---
Seriously though!!
---
Your comments are some of the most childish I‚Äôve seen
---
I‚Äôm 68 years old and 419 days.
---
Change crouch from ‚Äùc‚Äù to ‚Äùleft alt‚Äù. This way the crouch button is always below your thumb and the space bar doesnt get on your way

Can you elaborate?

I remember watching this vid

Hahahah thats actully good
---
/r/awardspeechedits
---
Why do you do these things
---
Even just better iron sights or even allowing us to put the red dot that Ela/Clash/Warden have on their pistols on it would be nice. It really doesn't need anything else cuz it's one of the more controllable machine pistols.
---
you monster
---
It and the SMG 12. The rest are okayish cause you can take a handgun if you dont like it on most the ops that have them. But you dont have that option with vigil and dokk so something desperately needs to change on them
---
don‚Äôt breach tho
---
Because I. am. speed.

No it this

Glaz:*almost shoots Kali*

Also Kali:wait why did I intentionally miss last ti-

*DIED FOR SHOOTING A FRIENDLY üî∫Ô∏è*
---
Yes that because shields used to be quite overpowered. Honestly it's better this way
---
Cause people would abuse that. When they are loseing one of the team leaves gets a small punishment and the other 4 don't lose anything
---
I feel like the mounted run should be able to eventually eat through shields. That would be a good buff.
---
I don't know if you realize the amount of work you're asking of ubi, but this isn't going to, and will never happen. A headgear/uniform that's made for an OP doesn't match the others, whether it is theme or practical wise. Don't forget the part where having someone elses cosmetics will confuse a lot of players as to who they saw and who they're fighting.
---
I mean there‚Äôs no wonder why she wants those stims
---
Almost nothing would change for Mira lmao.

The icon seems very close to caveiras

I have no idea what you are trying to say.

At First i didn‚Äòt Even recognized the transitions and i thought:‚ÄúHu, Why does Sledge have Breaches, But than i saw it and ist is Fokin Amazing!!!
---
Take my Silver!
---
What? I'm saying that you can use other bundles with the elite skins. I'm not saying that you can use bundles on OTHER operators
---
Epic is fine, its probably cheaper there.
---
its his christmas gift
---
Lol fuck off nobody asked for Nokk and Warden at all, the only good existing abilities are Kali and Wamai, new abilities like Amaru and Goyo are pretty decent.
---
Oh and Gridlock and Mozzie too
---
Brave, Smart or Lucky, You still die.
---
yes sometimes on the weekend
---
+60, excuse you. Gotta have that welcome mat bonus
---
Nice
---
Has it always been this way or is it recent? I'm on PC and had a similar problem with a new headset. Changed my equalizer settings and it was fine.
---
So it's better to make operators useless instead of trying to fix them? I know how they were, they were good before the Blitz buffs in White Noise.

Excuse me it‚Äôs not an ace until you accidentally kill the hostage too

What was the map on the second clip where you start to repel, never seen it, was it university?
---
I read up on it and apparently she arrested a gang leader and the gang members leaked her nudes. That's kinda fucked up if you ask me.

PC. thanks for your answer.
---
oh, OH... I was wondering why you'd ever want what I explained earlier. Sorry for that misunderstanding, but yea using different cosmetics from the same op including elites is reasonable, depends on how ubi coded them.
---
*claps in canadian*
---
Ranked has low ranks for a reason. How can someone learn the game if theyre not put into the environment to learn the game? Casual and unranked dont work because no one plays seriously in them. U
---
Dude it‚Äôs send me help not shaking my head stupid
---
Yeah it would make sense tho, they'd make more money
---
I'm pretty sure I did it in a private game, I think you can have a solo private game, hopefully they didn't change it.
---
But a lot of stuff I actually need my friend u/armelion to help me complete it, much thanks to him.
---
Wait... how
---
He made them
---
When he did the first thing
---
pretty sure codes are 16 characters long not 12

My luck in a nutshell

Already Done! Check part one for links
---
Montee and clash

Pulse a d lion
---
Goyo and smoke

Lesion and ela/kapkan/frost

Buck and zofia
---
Your stuff is awsome hope one day they change the icons like u did
---
I use Razer Kraken v2 Pros and they are pretty nice. I dont have issues hearing footsteps, but the pullout mic seems to pick up everything. There's a mute switch on the cord though. It's like $79.99
---
You could try changing the dynamic sound setting to night mode or whatever, its suppose to make softer sounds louder and louder sounds softer from my understanding. Idk if itll make a difference but it's worth a shot I guess.
---
Hey I put the new one on my profile, If it‚Äôs not good I can edit it, it doesn‚Äôt take that long
---
Not this shit again
---
Wamai Jager
---
I like Nomad solely for checking Cavi. Not having to worry as much about her is nice imo
---
I heard about using t hunt for practice I guess I gotta go try it thanks for the tip.
---
Sadly he does... He watched Saving Private Ryan last week with his grandson and is getting confused.
---
I can imagine heavenly saying "1v5, got the team on my back" etc but you dont have a team in that clip sooo
---
It's not like OP broke down a cried over it so there isn't really a need for the "If words and jokes offend you that much then you probably shouldn‚Äôt be playing a game that‚Äôs rated 18+". You do realize your teammates being obnoxious pricks isn't exactly a good time, right? Most people play Siege for fun, not to be insulted by 18 year old dude-bros.
---
I watch a YouTuber that plays airsoft and they use grenades and they have some fucking MASSIVE explosions for an airsoft grenade I‚Äôll try to find a video later
---
I would love lion

üòÇüòÇ I always say sorry so much but half the time they still TK me back

Damn he‚Äôs badass

That‚Äôs why I want an ALIBI elite.

Blitz displaying as the flash

Yep it happened in a ranked match

But they added unranked for that

I got one of these because I used an under the floor c4 lmfao. He told me he was reporting me to ubi. Have fun.

Still not talented enough to make cool video edits like this tho lol

Lmao I didn‚Äôt come at him sideways my dude. It was a mild mannered statement about a stupid post. You know if you have toxic team mates you can just leave, right? Or if you‚Äôre on pc and the chat is toxic you can turn chat off. Easy. If being insulted by 18 y/o ‚Äúdude-bros‚Äù bothers you then siege isn‚Äôt for you, hell most gaming isn‚Äôt for you.
---
Who cares if you have fun.

If you don‚Äôt have fun then that‚Äôs when something should change.

I'm kind of surprised Thatcher hasn't lost his breaching charges. Like if he got smokes that might be a buff and he could potentially use them to burn an ads but he'd also he in a capitao spot where he's dedicated support.

Gsg9 is federal police too

The one on the right looks like Solid Snake
---
Sucks im pc.
---
Unrelated, but I think that a rainbow 6 vr game would be insane
---
Not necessarily, in unranked you start learning about ranked gameplay. Ban phase, longer matches, etc, and its seperated from the lower level players, so they don‚Äôt have to go into the more serious matches while learning how to control recoil etc, while the players transitioning from quick match to ranked have players doing the same to go up against
---
Yeah but it kinda messed up my game when they were banned. I just think im too reliant on those 2 operators
---
Thats not what a crutch is. A crutch is like misusing mechanics to win where otherwise you would not. Like the iq floor glitch or the blitz sheild glitch. Or some overpowered weapon.
---
You just like two characters so all that means is you should maybe find a third in case they get banned.
---
So this is where doc always hides when I need a stim

It was nvk
---
it looks nice. i like thermites one
---
Just a gas filled canister full of bbs. Have also seen ones for colored smoke
---
Other games make the leaver suffer more of a point loss than they would have if they stayed in the game. On top of getting permabanned if the actions continue to happen
---
Naruto isn't real
---
I think it even mentions that if you come across an enemy medic in combat, and he‚Äôs actively treating wounded, you‚Äôre expected to treat them with respect and provide protection while they operate.
---
Exactly. Cons HEAVILY outweigh the pros.
---
That hurt that you didnt buy Lion
---
yea, but i jusualy mute them and if  they kick me im atleast done with them
---
And let‚Äôs say at the very least Ubi does want to keep it in, just make it so people in a stack can‚Äôt start a vote kick or vote at all. It‚Äôs abused way too often by 3 or 4 stacks and annoying as hell.
---
&gt;two or three
---
2 on a semi auto is good.
---
3 on a semi auto at 450 RPM will lose to EVRRY gun on attack.
---
And you don't want that.
---
Besides, suppressors are useless in siege because the sound is not suppressed enough to hide your position, and the trail hiding advantage is pointless in CQB because people will call out where you are.
---
So, basically, don't waste damage.
---
Just because you lose a teammate doesn't mean you shouldn't try. I've won games 2v5 before.
---
I do agree people shouldn't leave, but it looks like you guys just gave up immediately.
---
Damn thats sexy.
---
Yeah, I definitely notice that a lot. A lot of transition now looking bad is not as smooth as other or the execution is not as C L E A N. Also the mute after is just unnecessarily long, those are two thing I would fix, there are a few more minor 
---
things as well, buck capitao transition, cav Mira transition just to name a few.
---
At least he wins the memorial to be remembered as the guy who gets 99999 ping
---
That is true, yes.
---
Or, a small bandaid can be where loading for longer than 1:30  in casual is an auto kick, and you can't stat VTK until prep phase ends. They could try this first and monitor the data.
---
Frost is better then both of them.
---
Spawn killing is part of the game.  Just watch windows when approaching the building.  It‚Äôs not that hard to counter
---
Alibi's gadget was at least somewhat made for doing exactly that based on her operator trailer but aight
---
Elo or Karma, you can only have 1
---
I like finkas symbol better like this
---
Who did u get
---
Very nice kill tho.  Slick
---
Oh yeah as a console player the auto kick would be great. The amount of times I‚Äôve loaded into an ongoing match and sat there for like 4 minutes is ridiculous. Auto kick would be amazing.
---
Yeah, but I mean... She's literally the oldest DLC operator (alongside Buck, who I already have), and subsequently, the cheapest one to buy.
---
This is true.
---
Humiliation on an anonymous online forum lmao. Oh no I might lose some internet points
---
The Ash breach at the beginning wasnt great, but overall that was amazing.
---
r/oddlysatisfyinggaming
---
Tachanka cuts down reinforced concrete beams in his trailer
---
Point to where I cried or acted upsted any bit.
---
Your entire argument was to just get friends. I literally already told you my friends are hardly ever on when I play, and the same can be said for a shit ton of other people. On PS4, I get kicked out of a lot of matches for no reason, yet I haven't gotten kicked when playing on PC **once** and I'm level 40 something and suck ass on mnk. There is literally no point in "fixing" it. It just needs to be removed. Theres enough shit in the game to deal with trolls already, VTK just helps them.
---
I also cant help but wonder what your problem is. You seem unreasonably mad about this whole thing, or do you just like being a dick? Lol
---
Who cares they‚Äôre gonna be bad anyway
---
If you‚Äôre using the operator trailer as your main argument I‚Äôd just stop there. That is such a laughably poor excuse, anything else would‚Äôve been better.
---
I think it should have a knockback meter that builds with each shot, similar to Clash‚Äôs shock charging. After maybe 10 shots against a fully shielded Montagne, his shield is knocked away similar to a melee. For other shields, it is a knockback similar to an Airjab, but they‚Äôre only knocked back on the spot and not launched like 4 meters away.

yeah but think about it, what if one day your hearing is lessened because that person or people screamed in your ear. Muting them would be too late, the damage is done.
---
Yeah you should always try but someone leaves almost every damn game for me

It‚Äôs a good thing I bought her early on for shits and giggles.

I'm in bronze so.... it's not that hard

So their gadgets are a nitrogen grenade that basically turns hard walls soft, as well as being like Smoke‚Äôs gadget, and a mine that causes the attacker to fire their gun involuntarily? That‚Äôs cool but both sound super OP!

Yep. Provided you don't get an idle penalty, that is.

I think so?

So?

Aah, now that's a wholesome gift!

seems like your friends an immature little dickhead that needs to grow up. don't blame his stupidity and childishness on ubisoft. tell him to grow the fuck up and you need to improve.

Thanks man!

RIP zofia

It's too bad they fucked his in game model up in a recent, unnecessary rework. He used to be cool looking.

I just realy don't know is it compliment or insult saying i'm realy surprised you could do this.

Would make sense if Ubisoft wasn't nerfing him every update.

What are the top ten reasons why you suck?

I literally approve Unknown's message. Now fucking tell us the top ten reasons.
---
Doc is high out of his mind
---
Yeah boy
---
No the guns is like half the game imo. That‚Äôs what makes an op unique and fun and that‚Äôs what made me get into the game more and more. It‚Äôs what separates the game from every other fps game apart from the gameplay.
---
Not the worst she is pretty good
---
She THICCC
---
How long have you been playing this game?
---
Up voted for recruit main
---
Thatcher, Thermite, Hibana, Finka,, Twitch are operators that can be plugged into almost any team.  They offer utility that is always useful to an attack.  Good starters for attack.
---
On defense, I'd say the same as above for Rook, Doc, Bandit, and Jager.  They are relatively simple and extremely useful to holding down an objective.
---
I dont think there's anything you can do other than melee it a second time of the debris are stuck. Really wish they would fix that
---
The unstoppable spear and the impenetrable shield
---
Don't make me remember that ugh
---
Ok then upvoting you for upvoting me
---
What else is new lol.
---
My experience with siege
---
Late at night, PS4 and PC, there is a bunch of trollers or pure lv 200-180 on quickplay, same with morning, but in the afternoon it seems perfectly fine, tho I haven‚Äôt play ranked yet. That‚Äôs my experience and it bases off of time.
---
Aye no problem dude. Good luck :)
---
Lols. Slowly dying he says.
---
OP has made already six of these, sadly it already started. This is the neon icons all over again...
---
Have you seen get flanked on YouTube he has a valk vid I think you should watch it
---
I had a 50/50 to get Amaru or Goyo from the pack, I wasn't as unlucky as you. I got Goyo
---
At least he has 200 HP.
---
&gt;Are we 
---
I mean I'm Plat 2 and won a game against Beaulo and Pojoman last night, so I would say I would have a pretty good grasp on this.
---
Rather a lack of details
---
The operators that launched with the game, the original operators.
---
They're all listed [here](https://rainbowsixsiege.gamepedia.com/Base_Operators).
---
You can use the barrel of your gun to push broken pieces away lol
---
That sounds right. Honestly leaked nudes is a better consequence than a bomb under your car.
---
of course, im not disagreeing with her being a three speed, was just saying that she is pretty fast already! :)
---
They're just letting people cheat, cool
---
Yikes
---
I hope they don't do that
---
YaLl GoT aNyMoRe Of ThEm PiXeLs?
---
You like to die instantly because of random stuff?
---
I mean what do you want me to say. With the current ranking system you would just get a permanent leave account and if you are going to lose have it leave to cancel the match. I've won 3v5s plenty of times.
---
HALLELUJAH!
---
Nothing wrong with Frost. Why complain about free stuff
---
I've been critical of most of the new operators and I kinda feel like the old dev team was getting burned out so I'm excited for fresh ideas
---
I like people to die when I shoot them in the head
---
To be honest they need to do something like what world of Warcraft did with dungeon finder. When lead cues everybody must hit accept to actually go into the que
---
Try make your own style of content instead of just mimicking other context creators styles
---
Even if you don‚Äôt actually see them?

At least he can have his acog back now
---
That‚Äôs hot ngl
---
Yeah, I completely agree. I‚Äôm trying out stuff right now to see what I like. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Yes I‚Äôm a thermite main but I still keep my ranked kd at 1.2. My thermite kd is around 1.3. I definitely understand kd doesn‚Äôt mean everything but 0.73 just looks too low at diamond level.

My first one was for the fmg. I barely use n√∏kk and I use the shotgun on smoke so I was really anoyyed
---
4 queuers are asshats.
---
Nokks looks cool try clash and montange
---
He said he was swapping them by their similar abilities, so it wouldn't make sense to do them all at once.
---
So... still karma whoring tho
---
No lmao. It would be a bit cheesy if there was aim assist but not cheating
---
[removed]
---
putting yourself at a disadvantage? no this is not considered cheating.
---
Gotta karma farm man
---
You narrowed it down correctly, the reason we play good guys vs good guys and not terrorists, is because of Clancy, if you were to be a terrorist, you simply can't use the name Tom Clancy in your title, thus why they made it as a simulation.
---
No cause controller isn't an advantage. Think about it in the sense of m&amp;k on console. It's an issue because m&amp;k is easier to aim with, making it easier for them. On pc, it's backwards. Controller would be harder to aim accurately with in a pc playstyle. Now you may have been doing better with it but thats because you're used to it. I suggest get used to m&amp;k instead of cracking and swapping, it'll be better in the end. It may be hard, but it'll pay off. I used to be a console player before swapping too so if you need any tips i dont mind playing with you and helping out or something

Were you trialed by EG? If yes, what went wrong?

I think a whole animated series like in the style of the Nighthaven animation, I think it's simplistic enough that it would allow it to be made on a regular basis but if they're really trying to win my heart they might as well just make a whole series with the 3D animation of Hammer and Scalpel I mean who would complain lol.

What server are you from?

Well, they still technically exist. If you go on Ubi‚Äôs YT they have release trailers (or whatever it‚Äôs called) of every season, showing a brief ‚ÄùOP video‚Äù for every season.

all i want is the glacier skin :( there are only two ways to get it and i‚Äôm not willing to do it
---
Magick *snorts*

you need to make a new account and buy it again

I tried it but still cant find anyone except for kids that lets say arent that good...

buy it with renown, it took me 2 days with a booster

Uuuuh. Jack Ryan?

Ok thanks
---
Wow as young as 24 and reaction time slows down that much?
---
One of the best videos I‚Äôve ever seen
---
A new steam or uplay? I apologise for being dumb as fuck
---
Its a dope skin but I have no clue how to get it
---
wait you‚Äôre lvl 3 but have that weapon skin? i‚Äôm assuming you bought it with credits
---
So they just change color?
---
Both
---
depends where you buy it
---
Are phozzo and abunai friends with you? Or at lease are they friendly to you?
---
He might not have been your teammate but he was friendly :(
---
Nice, it'd be so much cooler if they were all real matches with people firing and dying around.
---
Still is somehow.
---
Maybe Buck and Sledge, the function of both is open holes in non-reinforced walls, I see Buck how like a hibana and Sledge how like a thermite
---
The first one is misspelled, I think they meant "Tabasco"
---
To ease maps onto new players.
---
We love it, and we can handle it, cause we've been playing for years. Not guys that joined a week ago. We had what....10? 14 maps when we joined, and one new every season? New guys have 22 new ones straight up. That's not a good start to a steep learning curve. Having some go out every 6 weeks is an easy way to learn the maps.
---
I got Kali!!!
---
in finkas bio it is described that they flirt so...
---
No way big brain
---
There are some bad people but you just sound extra unlucky
---
I‚Äôve read if I buy it on uplay I‚Äôd have to reinstall it?
---
Probably partly to being a dad too and just not being as on the ball as I used to haha
---
Lol
---
no
---
Ok so to switch do I just need to log out and log in with the other account?
---
Well I used to get a lot of draws but now the win just goes to the player who shot first, even if both players died.

&gt;Game breaking bugs that were quickly temporarily fixed. 
---
Clash and IQ were  disabled for a month during phantom sight thats not quick
---
I'm complaining because i constantly defend this game ,but im not going to blindly defend Ubisoft just because they add new content in ,during ember rise this game actually worked, every other season has had some kind of game breaking bug
---
What is this... some slav Russian, peaky blinder homie?
---
I feel like the gold MnK users aren‚Äôt that good though as I‚Äôve played against a few in casual, so they‚Äôre pretty easy to play against however some are also good in gold 
---
The MnK users in plat2+ however like LiberDBell states, are way too good and it‚Äôs a struggle to compete against them most of the time
---
Well what i meant with ‚Äùquickly temporarily fixed‚Äù is that these weren‚Äôt IN the game for that long. They took em out so you didn‚Äôt have to suffer.
---
Considering he's a Plat One (because he doesn't play mm) and was 5 stacking at 2 am), yes, I will. I can link a clip and screenshot if you don't believe me.
---
3v3 scrims low key, but mostly with Alphama would be the right thing to do since no relegations.
---
It means exactly what I was saying half a year ago. Siege is a crap, money grab, piece of spaghetti code, on the edge of its life cycle. Developers team shift means, Ubisoft move group of their best devs and designers to some new project while leaving, Siege in hands of "maintenance" team. Which translates to, game won't be expanded nor improved and all you will see, will be more skins, performance degradation and in next 2-3 years game will die.
---
Will upload tomorrow.
---
Its Marley's smurf acc
---
Well some dude maybe cursed by their bad internet and some dude maybe just forfeit the match after seeing the hopelessness of that particular match. There's a lot of possibility tho. My region server too hav this problem.

This does put a smile on my face

Bro that's that dumbest shit I've ever heard?
---
My mains are Buck and Thermite on my main?
---
Have you even looked?
---
I'm a support player lmao.
---
And yes ofc I play a lot of ash on my Smurf, cause that's where I go to destroy shitters like you :)
---
Cool beans thank you for explaining this to me :D
---
I play on a MSI laptop and it's doesn't make any noise.
---
Damn that's cool man, sucks that i don't really care about an Ash main's opinion. By the way you could've just switched to HD from SD on the gif.
---
Yeah np honestly surprised you made it through one year of reddit without knowing what a cake day is LMAO
---
Right, you're just confirming what i already know, tryhard. And i think you meant that it's where you go to be a no fun allowed metaslut.
---
That‚Äôs not the craziest thing I never tried a pb and j till I was sixteen (that stuns people when they hear it lol)
---
Yeah when they sit down and review movies every day and week, that is a hobby I would consider.
---
Hopping on once in a while with a few buddies on  R6 is not a fucking hobby, mate. It's a casual game. It has to be very consistent to be one.
---
Like for example, pro league players have it as a hobby and it can also develop into a job.
---
Basically, if you're playing it casually it's not a hobby, if not then it can be considered one.
---
Why is what a thing?
---
The more you know
---
Is this porn?
---
Yup
---
Again. Do you use your eyes? Ash is my 6th most played op after: THERMITE, HIBANA, BUCK, BB and Zofia?

Yes.

It happens when there is dust in the system and the laptop is struggling to keep the internal system cool. You may have to crack it open (unscrew it, obviously) and blow out the fan and filters. It will definitely mitigate the problem, but not eliminate it. Siege is a high power game and requires alot of resources. So the laptop could also be under powered.
---
It's a new laptop is anyone didn't know. Sorry bout that
---
So playing support operators makes me a tryhard? :D cool
---
I play ash bc she's fun. I don't care wether I win or I lose on my Smurf. You've been watching too much bikinibodhi if you actually think ash is a problematic meta operator.
---
Ps4? Installing on that takes quite a while
---
Bro i literally do not give a shit about your main, you're an ash/jager main on one account, which makes you an ash/jager main.
---
This is awesome holy crap

---
The point is though that uniform or not alibi gadgets won't trick anyone who looks for more than their initial reaction time. The main way to trigger them is someone who peaks the room without droning first (they see it and shoot before they have chance to look at how it is stood and all the infinite details that give away clones) or by putting them in a door or window so for an enemy to move through they have to destroy it or trigger it accidentally (destroying them gives your team an idea of where the destroyer is due to audio and the fact you can see clones through walls). She is already strong played like that but making her holograms harder to distinguish from her really makes no difference.
---
They only care because it brings them money, look what they did to Far Cry 5. Multiplayer was broken since the start and it took them half a year to finally fix it, but sadly, playerbase was gone.
---
 You're saying that I'm too blind to see the good things in the game. I'm playing this piece of trash since the release, it had it's ups and downs, I really wanted to be happy with the game but I can't. The same glitches come back again and again. Balancing of operators takes them ages, fixing glitches as well. 
---
Instead of waiting till mid season to fix 'em, they should release them as soon as they find a solution.
---
What is your opinion on PL going up to 10 teams
---
I don't think so, must be related with Pro League scenarios or related events.

You sure there wasn‚Äôt somebody behind the wall? Your last few bullets hit the soft wall in the back

Well, but can you actually answer what I asked? I just want to know if it's worth it or not. Thank you.
---
I know it is, but I mean it is so cheaper
---
Eh, more like.... Fuck fuck fuck FUCK!!!!!!
---
it‚Äôs not worth it, you don‚Äôt even need to buy credits that often really
---
Since when do so many people actually care to play Clash?
---
You know that doesnt mean permaban necessarily?
---
He hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwon‚Äù anything and gets a free promotion to PL. He decides then to shit on the players he‚Äôs replacing, who btw won their PL spot with their own talent.
---
Now tell me before your comment gets deleted, how exactly does this guy deserve anything?
---
But after the 7 day ban how would it be? Perma or temporary? I'm not saying I will do it again tho.
---
Thank fuck
---
Idk, i haven‚Äôt done this
---
SMG-11, Bearing 9, SMG-12, Scoripon EVO, Alda, F2, Buck AR. These are the main ones that comes to my mind. Also when you have ppl playing with mouse it‚Äôs even more annoying. Secondary SMG‚Äôs and Scorpion are the worst.
---
I hope to finish the song
---
Nah that's just the moon lord
---
You love to see it
---
I moved to pc so I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with that and I didn‚Äôt plan to bring it there
---
Probably same amount of days as the band are not coming from battleye which tracks your in game bans and does the 30 day ban stuff
---
You've mentioned in the past that after your abysmal performance on the Orgless half of your last PL stint that you made some drastic changes in your life. You were treating your body poorly in terms of eating/not working out etc.
---
What was the process you took to go from where you were to where you're at now in terms of your physical/mental health?  I've always been interested in this aspect of your return to PL because these things are often overlooked by players.
---
Thanks dude, I'm definitely rooting for you and the boys this season!
---
I do have fun but I have no Friends to play with
---
Also Alibi's goggles are clear where the clones are tinted.
---
It is cheating though. Its requires and adapter and ubi themselves have even said that it is cheating
---
[http://prntscr.com/qge59t](http://prntscr.com/qge59t) I get this message. Once again thank you for the answer, also I am not saying I am willing to take the risk, I just want to know.

The difference is that lesion does had a fat ass shield in of his body :)
---
Ok, thank you anyway
---
Plot twist: He is the cancer.
---
No one is stupid enough to do it so no one knows.
---
Hopefully you get a perma ban.  This would also mean losing access to your entire ubisoft account.
---
Yeah right.
---
What you play on
---
^^
---
Ps4.
---
No clue on that I left PS4 a long time ago
---
She used the weapon whilst using the shield. Much like the j√§ger glitch a while ago.
---
Had that happen to me as well on the same map
---
Then why not buff the recoils on console?
---
Someone gets spoiled with money and don‚Äôt know what limitations and new things are
---
Well how would you balance it?
---
Yeah sometimes ubi just likes to disable headshots

The background is normally gray and not a picture of the map

my instagram - @takeomeow

Well yeah but it‚Äôs the placem-...... yeah I know

No, I never said that. I said that's how you can test it.
---
Check out the individual page for each muzzle attachment here: [muzzle brake](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Muzzle_Brake), [flash hider](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Flash_Hider), [compensator](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Compensator). Every weapon is best used with a different set of attachments, there's no one best attachment that just beats everything else. It's best to just test it out in-game and arrive to your own conclusion.
---
Sometimes the do doing has to be done so the do doing can be done
---
When you use someone else's post AND comment
---
Get kaid on defense after his buff his gadget can electrocute 3 walls and his guns are insane
---
This happened to my friend on THunt but it said TERRORIST HUNT across his screen. When he left the game afterwards it was still there too. It didn‚Äôt go away until he restarted his game
---
Too good, has to be faked... jk great job looks very authentic!
---
Hmm true, you are a wise human person
---
K imma follow your advice but just wanna know is alibi a good defense in high rank or not (just came back to the game)
---
Neck, above the head, the bullets shoot at the top ofcthe triangle, not the middle of it

(Basically the opposite role you play now)
---
What is beauty?
---
The fact that you're so frothing at the mouth about Yardy is hilarious 
---
Guarantee you're a shitter hardstuck in gold lmao
---
yeah but what matters is 22222 went from random currency
---
Buck on Attack and Smoke on Defense
---
There still is the op videos, but they're all trailers at this point.
---
I know
---
In all seriousness though sometimes you just have to tk to save the game
---
He prismas kinda stop working around gold1-plat3 but if you can hit headshots then her guns are godly. Just put the prismas is commonly prefired spawn peeks to detect attackers early
---
ladies an gentlemen, we got him.
---
So I take kaid or Alibi rn cuz I can‚Äôt take both
---
Honestly the Christmas noobs should be glad she's gone, they're not ready for her.
---
Nah, it‚Äôs too small of a space
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
I lost the game as well lol
---
You are an actual shitter lmfao holy shit
---
That‚Äôs unranked for ya
---
Haha
---
I Posted it already and asked the same question I do believe it‚Äôs new
---
Ying and Alibi.
---
If you‚Äôre more of a team player and like to anchor take  kaid if you like to roam take alibi
---
fooking Repost!
---
Typical silver montage
---
Ohh, okay sorry the lighting is shit because it's tower. That and I play on 75 brightness so default is dark to me.
---
Buck and Doc both very good operators that are different to what you usually play
---
Still commenting irrelevant things? 
---
ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
---
Lmao
---
Well thx my dude I‚Äôll take alibi like you can guess I‚Äôm more of a roamed since most of my ops are roamers etc and I‚Äôll take kaid as soon as I can because yeah he seems op thx
---
Recruit
---
Yeah plane and house were
---
And that‚Äôs ok and expected but one shouldn‚Äôt be better than the other noticeably, which is the case, and for the sake of the player experience and the game in general, balancing towards Wamai is better than towards j√§ger!
---
I just had it happen last game I played lmao
---
You mean you're shocked a map got cycled out when they've been doing this the last few seasons?
---
Too many times
---
Yeah and because she is anime girl
---
Doc Main . Flair Checks Out.
---
Yep. I rarely get kills like these so it's even better it helped me getting an ace lol.
---
So basically I was in a random casual match on Skyscraper and one guy teamkilled the other by accident and they had an argument for the whole entire match. This was just a snippet
---
Imagine ubi trying to balance this operator
---
I play her, I succeed, she has very good weapons and an ability. Maybe I am just good with it, but I dont see any problems with her at the moment.
---
KAPPY BOI GANG!!!!!!
---
You don't have to be pretending to be a hologram. You could just be holding an angle.
---
Slightly experienced players hesitate when they see a skinny playermodel with a green uniform and red beret. May be a split second, may be more, but that's already an advantage if you get the first shot.
---
They're pretty well balanced out. My only complaint is why does Wamai get one less projectile to deal with? Make him have one more magnet. It's already a gadget that has more risk than Jagers ADS.
---
For triggering the EDD. They don‚Äôt actually get injured every time either. Depending on how close they are to the actual EDD and their amor level it will deal about 40-60 damage
---
What part is iq?
---
"Tilted into playing better" lmao
---
I almost wanna know what they hell they were doing when it landed, because that was a very specific spot to be in.
---
the eyes
---
No thanks
---
Just dont use skin in ranked
---
What a pos people have bad games god damn
---
It works tho they play better only to spite you and talk shit back to you. They‚Äôre never aware of themselves either it‚Äôs hilarious
---
[deleted]
---
But you are underestimating the value of his weapon combined with the speed. The gadget influences his pick rate a lot but the weapon and speed play a huge part as well. 
---
If j√§ger was a 1 speed with a mediocre weapon, you know he‚Äôd be probably below average on pick and win rate like a Fuze or a gridlock for example. 
---
At pro play it would be different but the stats never looked at pro league so this is nearly certain to be the case.
---
And why release an inferior operator?! You all are crazy if you think they purposely have the intention to make alternative ops less powerful. 
---
They should be at the same level hence why wamai is an alternative; to achieve the same goal in a different way.
---
Did you at least teamkiled him next round?
---
not a banana but sure
---
Military personnel are trained to keep their barrel down range. Not at the sky. Not at the ground.
---
Wamais gadjet has a longer radius so that makes him better i guess
---
There‚Äôs My B√∂rd
---
Ohhhh. I see. Thanks. (Bad pun not intended)
---
Yep,but I neee to grind them tickets too or get r6 coins.
---
Never that big. Just stupid big for how she was depicted in-game. They eventually corrected it though.
---
Same here, It looked great
---
That is not the way.
---
Hell yea
---
*hands shaking*
---
His model got the Rudolph special...
---
I think it depends on the playstyle of the Player. She can be Op but she can also be trash
---
So, in other words you're a platinum hardstuck, blaming it on another players.
---
Does the pack have a expiration date? I‚Äôm on vacation rn so I can‚Äôt claim it
---
No. If you dont have amazing reaction time, you'll always miss those tight angle shots which is what she's designed for. Her gadget can still be tricked by bandit so she's not as good as Thatcher
---
As they said they‚Äôre expanding the universe for season 5
---
She definitely isn‚Äôt terrible in the state she‚Äôs in, but at higher ranks she is very difficult to be effective with. If you take a look at the win deltas for last season ([Y4S3 win deltas](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-357729-16/y4s33-designers-notes-mid-season?isSso=true&amp;refreshStatus=noLoginData) ) you‚Äôll see that she is one of the least picked and lowest win rate attacking operators.
---
Idk sometimes if my teammates are being toxic I start throwing the game just to deny them the MMR
---
No she is not
---
I just wanted to say thank you so much to everyone who commented on and upvoted this, I feel very welcome in this subreddit and I look forward to using it more in the future :)
---
You definitely are better than me, and I'm a PC player
---
A small price for salvation!

i ignore people.   there was one time where this dude with a heavy accent (maybe french? couldnt place it) was telling me not to use montagne.  no no  montagne bad no no dont pick him
---
i had to get on my mic and tell the man to stfu and mind his own business.  also endded up getting a smoke plant and won the round with monty.
---
Buy 3 items on uplay, the cheapest one is free

I‚Äôm saying that even though Kaid‚Äôs gun was shit and he was slow he was still picked because of the utility. If J√§ger was 1 speed and had the UMP he would still be picked a lot, I can guarantee it. 
---
J√§ger is better, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs less balanced than Wamai. J√§ger being better than Wamai doesn‚Äôt mean J√§ger is less balanced than him, it just means he‚Äôs more desirable because of the 3 speed and better gun. Wamai works great as an alternative and is actually picked *over* J√§ger in some instances due to certain strategies.

T-Hunt Solo, normal mode or hard if you‚Äôre really good, just run in with a fast op, don‚Äôt bother looking and when they start shooting and you see the white direction icon, flick to them and headshot in single fire mode, that‚Äôll build up your flicks and give you some good practice.

Try practicing 180 and 90 degree turns using the compass, then start doing it without looking at the compass and see how far off or how close you are. You can also try shooting one bullet each time you complete the turn to see the difference.

He got picked up by a team because he played well in lower leagues? He deserves his spot in PL because he‚Äôs proved he‚Äôs too good for the lower ranks. Are you fucking stupid lmao
---
Love this
---
Sure, my Xbox is glitched rn and I can‚Äôt sent clips, but I will later today

Yeah I found the Twitter but the artist has closed it.

I'm more of a fender/squire guy but I'll be damned if that LP doesn't look beautiful

Can't trust anyone. Not even yourself. üòÇ

This too. I even say all the time, I'm just Plat 3. It's like Gold+. Lol

So far I think the sound Is inverted but i dont know anything else

I was already pretty sure you were shit posting but now I‚Äôm certain. It‚Äôs hard to tell when people really do think that

Man look how butthurt you are over one post. Calling someone ‚Äúfucking stupid‚Äù sure makes you seem super smart

I think this happens when you hit the middle of the wooden bars inside the wall. It's not common but it happens on occasion.

I don't know what you're talking about. Fuze is perfect for making sure the hostage's safety is no longer in question

Sunday February 16th is the finals for y4s4, there they will reveal the next season and then the following weak the test server will be live for 2-3 weeks before official launch. Thats why year 5 does not start before early march.
---
As for the season 5 pass, a while before the test server launch we will probably be able to buy it.
---
Illuminati eagle just sayin

Whats your username i can help you

if there is an overpowered operator, who is it?
---
Menar du kan ha missat att √∂ppna packet, det var ju bara typ 1-2 veckor efter julafton innan det f√∂rsvann.

Men √∂ppnade du det och hade alla fick du definitivt 25k renown :)

Basic ops are unlocked by default now, or am I wrong? ü§î

I had someone on a drone in that room that could see him but couldn't spot him, he made a call I took a shot

Something similar happened to me where it showed the MVP of the last match until I restarted the game
---
In T-hunt, you don‚Äôt hunt the T, the T hunts you.

Says the FOOKIN CAV MAIN
---
Better question, how is this a gun?
---
(Im a PC player fyi) I totally disagree with that statement, if you take the best Controller Player there is and the best Mouse and Keyboard player youll find that theres NO WAY that the dude playing with pc extensions will lose, not on a game like r6. You used apex as an example, but there isnt anywhere close to the same amount of gun recoil and need to be able to clear wide angle corners quickly like in r6 (i know what im talking about, ive played a fair bit of BR and apex too). MnK against controller will never be something that will be called "fair matchup", its cheating, plain and simple
---
Be patient, learn the maps, and don‚Äôt forget to have fun.
---
Just FYI people still fall for the shoota Prisma they go to take cover while they're wallhacks fall off you can take the place of the Prisma during that time and they will literally stare you in the fucking face. 
---
also I've had so much fun bring a Prisma with me while roaming I catch so many people off guard with it. Like they had three of them on me pinned down in drum. I was able to take one of them out throw my Prisma make another one shoot at it killed and injured the third

Hello SirChocolateBear, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/egg6hx/bots_play_rainbow_six_siege_would_like_to_know/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I have an idea for an attacker that could stay shift. This ability changed her from a 3 speed to a 3 armor at will and back again. This allows for a flexible roamer that can anchor if they decide they are done. You would have 2 changes and each last until the next use.
---
Not anymore. I recently swapped over the p90 and Jesus Christ it's a goddamn laser
---

Tachanka is a God. Tachanka doesn't need protective glass.
---
I‚Äôm order to earn prime status on a f2p account you have to reach level 20 which is around 50-100 hours of in game time.
---
there should be a new button "Report squeaker" Kids should not play this game. i hate when i get one of them in my team they're annoying as shit
---
Lol mmmm something off here
---
I may not have been concise with this but I had meant to say that pro input was put into consideration. Ig all that we can do is just sit back and watch what Ubi will do.
---
What‚Äôs your best advice for playing entry and bettering yourself in a competitive environment?
---
I hope all goes well with eU and am glad to see you back in PL. I remember playing against you in ranked a couple of seasons ago...you‚Äôre fucking nuts. You‚Äôre one of the few pros I enjoy watch streaming. You always have a positive mindset and it‚Äôs very admirable. Best of luck to you, man!
---
Ok for one second, serious, am i allowed to shoot teammates if they break my stuff? Thats legal right?
---
True. I can settle on that point.
---
Sweet embrace before death. So romantic
---
Then tells Cav to go straight in to them. Just imagine getting a phone call while pushing those stairs.
---
Go with what you like try em out man
---
it's a very big common misconception in The siege community that with rook or doc you go for the MP5 cuz there's nothing else
---
All I can say is I've been getting my spawn kills a lot more frequently and I've been able to have a lot better aim with a p90. Yes the p90 has slightly lower DPS but it has the fire rate to make up for it
---
Id give you a pass but you didnt even ask Vigil or Mozzie
---
So it's an agree to disagree?
---
The flair is old last time i played cav was level 30
---
Dang, this is really amazing. Great job, I wish I had the talent too do something like this :)
---
When redeeming the code in steam. If you allready did I guess I'm just wrong. Thought you should be able to switch languages onvece activated. Afaik there is no option to upgrade from version to another.
---
That was really good
---
Just takes practice! I really appreciate the compliments!
---
Well I take it back good sir but Crutchbeard is my crutch. Dont take him away.
---
Smurfs ruin the game for everyone.
---
I don't want to play against people I literally stand no chance against. I'm an average player, I'm competently skilled in the basics -- I can manage a decent game, but I can't play against plat or diamonds or their relevant smurfs. These people are always going to be better than me, it doesn't matter how much I "practice". I don't want to be in plat or diamond, period.
---
Likewise I don't want to shit on coppers, which happens in quick match where it becomes extremely obvious the disparity in skill levels and matchmaking even for an average player like myself.
---
Thats true now cuz uve been usinc controller all the time. If u were to switch to MnK and trained a bit youd see that you would quickly (very quickly) reach the same level you were on with controller and then youll just keep getting better
---
Agree to the waiting until mid-season, but will likely still disagree on which way they take him if at all
---
Idk if you‚Äôre high ranking or something, but in my casual games it‚Äôs perfectly viable to holo trick enemies (but only after they‚Äôve thoroughly shot your holograms already).
---
Now that I type that out though, I realize my justification for holo tricking is that I‚Äôm probably not playing against very good players lol. Still though, IF ITS STUPID AND IT WORKS THEN ITS NOT STUPID!
---
Not really because they promoted that strat themselves. They‚Äôre just too lazy to properly code their game
---
Inb4 engine limitations, no.
---
Siege isn't about being able to "clutch". Its about teamwork.
---
Might need to call in the exterminator
---
Nothing she's the glazz rework we've been supposed to get for a long-ass time ago. her bolt-action reloading animation was in the game for a long time back in season 1 if you had smoked fuck up his reloading animation he reload it like a bolt action sniper on the fmg9
---
Oh, well I feel sorry for you man.
---
Pay him no attention. He's an idiot.
---
Ok at least your not an ash main
---
Legal, no. Proper, yes
---
I love the adrenaline you get when a squeaker yells at you in chat, of course you never listen to them, but it motivates you to clutch in the EXACT opposite way then what they said.
---
Then they should fix the fucking engine, just like any other companies. Specially if they wanna make this working game for next 9-10 years.
---
This. This is the only cure.
---
There's a reason i got the shotty on him after all
---
This is the way.
---
Ok
---
Don't worry I'm a Destiny 2 Titan, I can fix this.

---
She‚Äôll be back after the holidays they said. Currently they are testing a fix for her in the test server so once they make sure there is no glitch then they‚Äôll put her back in.
---
Because they disagree with your choice of operator, and want to deter you from just staying on your shield and not helping the team
---
I have no idea what this comic is trying to communicate.
---
Glaz clearly has lower stakes than Kali as he can shoot multiple times with little recoil.
---
Whay is mid video 4v3 and when did you defuse it says round 2?
---
Legal and proper? Who cares, just do it üòé
---
Just randomly happens, I'm around 160 and it still happens
---
What do you think is the most balanced map where both attackers and defenders have an equal chance of winning
---
Greatly appreciated!!
---
The tachanka bit was rhe best lets be honest or was it just who was thinking that
---
So we should let an op be banned because people don‚Äôt know how to play the game?  If they wanna play cod, the newest one came out a month or two ago.  They can go play that if they wanna play a run and Gun game.  They Shouldn‚Äôt be able to pollute siege if that‚Äôs the kind of game they want
---
You forgot Ash's grenade, Hibanas X-kairos, and Jagers autistic ass.
---
Do you think the kid realizes that practically everything is both a flank and a normal push at that point? They had nothing else to keep their attention so theoretically they could have been looking any direction.
---
I'm sorry, were you up against Helen Keller and her friends?
---
is anyone doxxing this kid??? holy fuck chill

Operator: Rock guy
---
Weapon: 
---
Primary: guitar
---
Secondary:x

Special ability: rock guy starts playing so loud what makes defenders deaf for 5 seconds

Finka for team in need, Nomad for solo games and for fun.
---
I sense a new lame trend about to start....
---
You asked. I told you how cyber bullying hurts people
---
I fixed mine by disabling other audio drivers in device manager. Might also work if you disable other unused devices in sound control panel in the recording tab except whatever your using. Usually theres something conflicting in the audio settings. 
---
Sound control panel&gt;recording&gt;(the device your using) properties&gt;advanced tab&gt; check the boxes in exclusive mode might work also.
---
Just keep whatever you don't use disabled seems to narrow down where the issue is coming from.
---
How many Alpha packs did it take you got this?
---
When did they start doing this? I sorta slowed down on siege recently. And what map did they cycle out last season?
---
Lazer and flash hider
---
Nowadays it could be about 500$ if you find a good offer or you're are in search of old hardware, but, to have some good graphics it could be perfectly 700 dollars, maybe more than one thousand for a latptop
---
Being able to play as Rock Guy is now my #1 priority
---
Fuze apparently might be able to use his cluster charges on reinforced walls and hatches according to one of the new operators bios
---
Why do so many kids play this game and scream in voice chat? It really feels like the people that rage most of the times in this game are kids under 16.
---
Give Wamai the rich guy air pods
---
I think what you are meaning is the laser from the gun. One some weapons it is a large container and sits on the side of the gun.
---
I was going for shit that would be really hilarious to yeet, and i just wanna thank you for the amazing idea of jager being used for spawnpeeking it is something that in truth would happen, tho im not sure jagers autistic he just doesnt seem like someone like that in his voice lines.
---
1100, never thought I would get it. It's my only primary black ice!
---
It‚Äôs backwards and it bothers ne
---
it still slaps tho
---
Recommend getting a drone where you're likely to be spawn peeked, I place my drones near the area I plan to enter the building at. Check windows as you move, check door ways, and just keep pushing forward. I have been playing for four years and I still fall victim to spawn peeks periodically.
---
Nice.
---
I know. Sorry. Siri doesn‚Äôt know how to not be rascist
---
Thanks bro
---
Or we can go even lower and use Ryzen 3400 G and get the price way lower.
---
It‚Äôs barely any different than her default...
---
If a gun skin would give you away you weren‚Äôt fooling anyone in the first place.
---
 I still use it as an high gold alibi main
---
Say demon you better get your ass out of here
---
If you consistently play or are on a smaller server region such as the SA ones you will start recognizing people
---
obv not the same thing but okay lol, bruh you ARE outrage culture
---
make sure that AA is set to TAA or OFF and not FXAA or TAA-2x or above
---
what resolution?
---
i really don't care about society
---
Then when you get downed you she grapples at you and fucking dies to a frost mat
---
That guitar is so fucking iced out
---
Easy fix
---
Never play ranked to begin with
---
Make this a charm in r6
---
No that‚Äôs just retarded and besides why would they need to rework frost she‚Äôs fine
---
Haha, thanks!
---
I'm playing siege now a long time and when I'm playing siege with my squad we ban often caveira because we just don't wanna drone alle the time and just play
---
Because shotgun
---
What‚Äôs retarded about it? If you could tell me that would be great!
---
That's would be amazing! I would NEED that!
---
repost.
---
Oh, then yeah I can see that being a valid reason to ban odd operators
---
You serious?
---
Replaced unranked with pick and ban playlist it never was a good idea to put in ranked. Also map rotation was the worst idea. Pls fix ubi.
---
if you just play alibi just to try being a holo then you're playing her wrong
---
Cav‚Äôs pickrate really isn‚Äôt that high anyways, iirc.  Wouldn‚Äôt banning Vigil make more sense?  He‚Äôs basically a straight upgrade of Caveira.
---
Oh my goodness squidward !
---
The hall of mirrors trick is only fun in casual, and shouldn‚Äôt be used seriously. Use her holograms on pixel peeks and to cover sight lines onto obj while you roam.
---
Where did your mom bought them?
---
How much. I have organs I don't need.
---
High silver is proleague thats why
---
The reason is retarded is because frost is in a good spot at the moment . Having 3 frost mats that instantly down is better than 4 that won‚Äôt and besides in real life you can‚Äôt escape a bear trap anyways so it‚Äôs just dumb your idea .
---
Thats just a nerf.
---
Cav weighs more lol
---
He's banned all the time because he stop the plant with his gadget. Thats why i gave his gadget and team utility perfect scores.
---
ILL
---
Ayyyyy look at that I found the silver.
---
wtf no? and sometimes I'm also playing vigil so we wouldn't ban him anyways
---
These comments have really made my day! Really didn't expect this to blow up like it did! Thank you all!!
---
Because u are playing a game from ubi. Thw company that always messed up
---
casual has it's own mmr
---
Cargo shorts &gt; Elite Skins
---
I'll trade for a kidney! Seems fair, haha. Thanks
---
Coolest guitar I have ever seen even though I haven‚Äôt seen many
---
Ouuuf
---
The World Record is 47 so good luck
---
Everyone has a black ice skin nix me (been playing since Y2S4)
---
No I am just want to have a discussion about him see if he needs a buff or nerf
---
Fantastic, just remember to take it a step at a time. Whenever I did mine it took me about 5 days in total, so just go slow to make sure it comes out perfect! Let me know know how it comes out!

It was one kid shit talking the other wasnt

So it takes longer for the AUG to kill someone with bodyshots than the MP5K?
---
yah its not the injury its the fact that i played while on oxycodone
---
Slap now
---
Some pretty _cool_ jams, from a pretty _chill_ guy are hapoening. (I'm not sorry. :))
---
I dont fuggin know im just guessing
---
Damnnnnn, I've been playing since Y3S2 and have it on Bandit MP7, GIGN Revolver, and IQ's LMG
---
There's not that many M&amp;K users than people make it seem like. Often people just accuse someone of using M&amp;K when they actually just use an Elite/Pro controller or high sensitivity.
---
I hardly ever see any.
---
To be honest I think alibi is a great way to teach people to check your target before shooting it‚Äôs probably stopped me from accidentally team killing
---
Why comment if you don‚Äôt know? Lmao
---
yeah, the developers themselves

I'll forgive you this one time since you're the lord and all haha

the cap is set to 144 fps
---
I‚Äôm a total noob here... how do y‚Äôall have your operator mains next to your names ?
---
It's a 17+ ESRB and ubisoft tries to lure the kids to sell more, they should make another game and not wipe out Tom Clancys memory.
---
Just make sure to give it a good slap when your done
---
81 bullets strikes again
---
This has TheDooos name written all over it
---
He was my first to play or buy I forgot but I loved him then I got my first black ice skin on him and it was a wrap
---
Anyone who unironically thinks this game is serious or realistic may need to have a long hard thing about things.
---
Also what sort of a masochist uses green text on a red background?
---
This would be perfect for the Dooo! Honestly, might have to message him about it...
---
Or she has Scoliosis

Can ubisoft fucking ban children already ? Yeah TAKE MY PERSONAL ID INFORMATION AS LONG AS YOU GET FUCKING 8 YEAR OLD KEVION HOOKED UP ON MONSTER BANNED ! Because you clearly know that the fucking parents dont care !

That is fucking epic

He needs neither he‚Äôs in a good spot maybe buff the p90 lol idk

How tf do you get banned from a single player game

Thank you

How long did it take you to make it
---
No but seriously that is cool

That's epic! Do you play bass too?

Thanks
