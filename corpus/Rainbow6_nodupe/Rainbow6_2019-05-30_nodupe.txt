Welcome Mat with that stolen ace
---
---
---
Like the TF2 weapon borrow thing?
---
Thanks. It’s a simple rework that does really push him into a site defending beast on specific objectives. Window play isn’t countered any differently in game to doorway play, however each one plays out differently. 
---

---
This change is perfect I feel. Thanks for the support
---
I guess that makes sense but I'd still rather use a sight because thatcher isn't played too often unless you're defending snowmobile garage lol
---
use the search bar
---
You're doing gods work
---
This is why I dont play this game as much 80 percent of the people are fucking assholes who kill for simply existing and when your carrying they just decide to ruin your perfect game
---
Lol dude I got 3 downvotes for saying "this"
---
Well yea that's just my opinion :)
---
Lesion is easy and good
---
Oof. I gave you an upvote for support. 
---
People are just deluded
---
Shit, that's pretty cool, I didn't know about collegiate level siege. Is there any way to find out more about the league itself?
---
That straight up looks like the siege wallpaper thing tho
---
Only reddit ;-;
---
Then he’s just a utility eating pain that would really break the game
---
Yup
---
This has happened to me like 4 times over the 102 hours of playing him and each time it happened i was fuming.
---
Cav preparing to thanos snap her fingers and give ash a hitbox
---
Lesion.
---
CoreRoss is so fast at getting the patch notes that even the devs who created the patch aren’t faster than him
---
They used Frost’s trap mat. Not a shield. It was the shield glitch but instead of a deployable shield they used a Frost mat.
---
I did for a while, are there private servers or something?
---
What about the ticketmaster on The Polar Express?
---
Fuze crafts a potion and forces the defenders to drink it
---
yeah I know that, but before the shields were removed, I would be fine playing echo any site. I'd rather have a shield to sit behind while I watch my drones so I know where attackers are before I peek
---
What if I have a shotgun?
---
silence lmg user
---
Idk what the odds of this happening are but if you look closely one of my hockey pucks killed someone and both of the other two got stuck in the ceiling so I was completely fucked either way
---
Thanks. I just feel slower with an lmg maybe it's a mind trick
---
Tremendous
---
I think it might just be that lmgs are mainly on slower ops so they feel slower than the three speeds
---
Fr
---
Revert all the matches back between the days it was discovered and the ops were vaulted. It wouldn't be too hard. Its something that's somewhat fair to those who lost because of the glitches
---
Ok but why
---
...why, though?
---
A new attacker with a drone the size of a valk cam. It can scan but the operators dont appear at the top
---
[deleted]
---
That would be the most underpowered attacker
---
Down on pc as well.
---
They're back up. Had the issue for like 5 minutes
---
Im sorry but huh? What does ying's and glaz's ability have to do with him? They are not defensive operators
---
[ALLE]: littlefarrell: Guys, I won’t upvote
---
[TEAM]: littlefarrell: Guys, I am totally gonna upvote
---
I want it
---
And also wouldnt it not be special either because iq has the same ability as your suggested change?
---
Looks to be an AR platform (rearward charging handle) chambered in .308 (long mag and low capacity, .308 mags are generally around 20 rounds). So, *probably* a heavily customized AR-10, and while the image isn’t high enough quality to get a good look at it, the fire-selector might have three different positions, indicating an automatic fire mode (the AR-10 is semi-auto only, so there would have to be some serious modification to allow automatic fire).
---
Cool thanks for the heads up
---
I’ve never heard a louder N word than what this picture screams. Just fuckbeard things yahno
---
I’m just comparing the ability’s between those 2 and warden
---
Yea
---
LUL
---
I've never seen something so magnificent and beautiful.
---
But nobody on the defensive has those abilities? Im so confused
---
Down on xbox as well
---
I think smoke should be a tier s
---
Same here EU is down cant find a game
---
Yes but it would make him really good like iq is to the attacking team
---
I want
---
I need a new pair of pants
---
No but he’s a mix of both
---
Kids are stupid
---
not really, it was made in the first place for people who couldint handle flanks/runouts. Its a gadget that rewards the player for simply holding place down.
---
I GOT A FUCKING WEEK WITH NO PRIOR BANS FOR DOWNING LUCKY ASS.
---
That hurts my feelings ;( I'm a kid
---
its badass alright?
---
Guuuuu
---
Sorry gotta keep the "rude innuendos" away when looking at this picture of a fucking dog
---
Your entire point is changing a character that is a counter to ying glaz etc to a iq defence clone because his gadget is just the same as theirs do i have to point out the irony
---
Ya if you're going against a main, but most people dont know how to use him properly.
---
On PC too. I haven't been able to play all fucking day. Thanks a lot Ubisoft.
---
Dayyum, a lot of John wick action going on!
---
Sorry let me clarify, kids that instigate and think they know everything are stupid, these kids are stupid, they take Siege too seriously when they're not even supposed to be playing it
---
What kind of gaming air are you breathing?

Is IQ having a seizure?

rippp. the only op u can by ice for
---
For downvotes?
---
You do realize that defense does not have flashbangs and smokes and those two are being used AGAINST them right?
---
No that’s not what I meant I said in my opinion his gadget feels weak atm you can only really use at the right moments that barely happen while if he was like iq he would always be useful

Yeah :(
---
At least I got it for free though!
---
Lol! I immediately got off after this like yup no way I’m following that up
---
Oh haven't I? If you do that you miss rounds. It takes a long time to reboot ergo a penalty already occurs. So leaving a button to cheat is your plan? Haven't really thought much at all before making your dumb comment did ya?
---
Compared to a lot of art, there is worse but not bad, still can improve though, you have potential to do great art
---
hey, black ice is black ice
---
I just looked that up and sadly none of the operators after Frost and Buck get it :(
---
Would work much better if you have an alibi so it's not blindingly obbious a frost is outside putting mats down
---
Black Ice on Glaz would be amazing for me, I don’t play him that much but I’m still not bad with him.
---
We should play add me on uplay alexp3311
---
your phone gave made me sea sick
---
Only the freshest New York polluter air :)
---
Yeah, I need that extra protection
---
I never even knew she did that
---
XD, that did it, that made my day, a perfect cherry on top, thanks😂 have a good one
---
I agree with almost all of it but I would say no to shield operators and operator gadgets.
---
Yeah my friend was talking about nerfs but as a mozzie main im sorry for you pain I think he has enough pests is that his warning range needs to be longer. The best Australian
---
I hate to ruin things for you . But why do people care for a scope ? i'd rathar have Thermite's frags instead
---
The best part about the fortnite SMG is that stock isn't even a "stock", it's a brace which is meant to circumvent short barreled rifle laws in the US domestic market.
---
***Communism Intensifies***
---
I'd drop Maverick down a tier and bump Frost up a tier.
---
Thank you fellow Australian to defend our home land
---
I don't care that Warden doesn't have an ACOG, but his gadget isn't good enough to warrant how bad the MPX is, if you could move with his gadget, then yes give him a shit gun. But it's just massively situational now and I don't feel that warrants the MPX.
---
As a mozzie main i can tell u mozzie isn’t broken at all  and if u think he is ur either stupid or bad
---
That’s the thing though she’s going to fit a brand new play style. She’s an ambush attacking anti roamer , a shotgun makes sense. I’m very curious to see how she’s being used in a few more months. She might totally be mediocre, or she could be a lot of fun
---
I thought you could move with his gadget?
---
ubi won't add this feature at all due it will cause super long queuing times . you can still do this in thunt tho
---
Russian man
---
You can but what you can see through smokes are limited
---
You can but seeing through smoke requires standing still
---
Casual
---
Oh I don’t like that
---
***GAMER MOMENT ACTIVATED***

He throws a maximum of 3 helmets that kill on hit.

Sledge is better because of:

1. He very thicc and scary

2. Hammer kill

tru guess I'll be playing tower again .-.

No

Sledge, Ash and Rook.

In the books they do i believe,
---
Ash
---
Idk if you forgot to use the nanoboost when you pushed through the window or when you dropped into the basement but I was cringing when you got that ace 
---
Well done
---
lol
---
Honestly all my clips have that weird sound issue, although it’s not what it actually sounds like when I’m playing. I’ve never been able to figure it out though
---
Castle doesnt need a buff
---
Oh hell.
---
Not excessive though.
---
Honestly he’s pretty trash lol
---
Damn.
---
I'm in.
---
now thats not very nice. stop bullying me ;'(
---
wrong, the shield should be inside this man
---
She looks like a fucking ninja turtle
---
Change my mind
---
Ranked
---
you call me toxic but instead of arguing my point you resort to insults....
---
And meanwhile screenshots keep getting worse
---
&gt;And you can put a Mira mirror on it
---
There is **legitimately no benefit** to doing this. Even with your crazy buffs.
---
No clue why people suggest this.
---
Very nice
---
If she was gridlock you would distenegrate
---
yea we didn't have your logo plastered on the screen for free advertising.
---
It's almost like this isn't a real gun and that other games don't have a vector either.
---
What was that fucking ragdoll
---
I thought I was the only one who noticed that...lololol
---
I suspect it to work against *one* person, everything else is pure luck. After the first trap any non-dumbass team will realize why the frost was outside for 20 seconds, and if they frankly should've expected it from a frost in that situation. But past the first trap, they should be wary of the ground, and immediately covering the window since a frost is always going to be going for her prey. If they actually expected her to go outside, it'd be easy to take her down from the window.
---
True, the win delta chart does show that.
---
Bullying is when you come to someone who has done you no wrong and belittle or intimidate or hurt them. 
---
You actively engaged in this argument and I'm just telling you your opinion is childish.
---
maybe a software issue?
---
I see Deku I upvote
---
Bananagaming will like this
---
*\*click clack click clack click clack\**
---
The nuts
---
Or ya know, people like the more balanced game mode.
---
Uhhh... it’s a Vector 45 ACP. Not a super rare and original gun. No surprise that Fortnite added it, but I don’t think they copied us.
---
Funniest thing I read today
---
Coolest charm in the game IMO
---
What’s wrong with that? Its accounting for recoil, so its kinda smart. Its just different from controlling the recoil itself.
---
No, it's a red meat. Similar to venison I've heard but also sort of similar to beef, but tougher and bloodier.
---
Felt cute, might put a bullet in Maestro's face while he's on cams
---
Or maybe they just would rather win than lose. That is kind of the point of the game.
---
I miss the claymore and the deployable shields, but fuck clash I can’t stand playing against her
---
since when has fortnite made something original (ignoring building)
---
It was made to keep your mindset on one side instead of switching back and forth.
---
Ever heard of punctuation?
---
Gosh dang it’s a joke I know it’s not an original gun
---
Tiny brain: using Kaid’s primaries
---
Big brain: using his pistol
---
Universe brain: only throwing impacts at enemies
---
Ascended brain: Hitting enemies with Rtila until they die
---
Basically anything that isnt acting like an idiot gets called "sweaty" or "try harding". Its probably the thing I hate most about this game/community. And I'm not even that good.
---
Yea I’m not too good with that stuff; I’ve tried messing around with settings but couldn’t get it. I use Nvidia Shadowplay
---
Why is this getting downvotes
---
?
---
What map is that
---
those win rates are likely not from traps like these
---
In the first 5 seconds you realize it's a console player
---
Bandit *misclicks*
---
-10 team gadget
---
Having a stupid opponent who rushes you when they are defending, an underrated maneuver.
---
There's a reason most games just zoom the entire screen. Thats typically the function of the engine
---
Ikr
---
I have wanted this for so long now.
---
That depends on the skin Tachanka is using
---
EAT PIE MOTHERFUCKER
---
Lets not go that for. I spend 90% of casual games explaining to my team that we are defenders and we dont need to attack them.
---
its ranked tho. people want to win.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
when you play ranked, you play to win. i prefer doing retarted shit, so i do casual.
---
Friend has gotten this 3 times... once it was when he spent about 100k on alpha packs just to hunt for black ice. Big ol rip to his renown lol
---
why does everybody hate dokk?
---
Idk Lesion’s ability just take a bit too long to recharge, like you can get 2/3 spikes down before the prep stage is done. Capitao is alright, I like his LMG tho.
---
Yeah just finished 2 b2b matches with em. Still come out with a positive kdr, but my map knowledge isn’t near their level.
---
Nomad is a fragger..  use the gadget, then all that’s left is to go click heads
---
Smoke seems a little lazy don’t you think?
---
The problem is how the community going to react.
---
If they add Israeli, people assumed that the ops are Jewish because Israel is basically Jewish-exclusive country. In fact, there are Christian, Buddhist (?) and Muslim that serve in its military.
---
Same goes for Arabian ops. People would assumed the ops are Islam while there are also a number of Non-Muslim serve in the military.
---
Thats the problem. Community would think the game is political / religious just like how they did with Wildlands.
---
It's one banana, Michael... What could it cost? $10?
---
Playing since beta and hours played does not equal good at game. Just saying. You can play this game a lot and not learn anything. It takes dedication and constant evaluation of your faults to improve.
---
It was a 2v4 thats not a clutch
---
You know you can buy that one
---
Echo is super strong..
---
Superior != Toxic
---
Ok but why?
---
It looks too much like another aug variant. No thanks
---
Remember this fun in rainbow six black arrow? It absolutely tore through ppl. The g36c too
---
now im not saying console controls allowed for this
---
but thats exactly what i believe
---
My mum
---
The stupider the trap placement, the less likely they are to expect it. Well placed traps are too obvious.
---
does the 45 on the cups signify anything?
---
His emblem is a spiderweb, that’s all I need to say
---
standin outside as frost for more than 10 second is the most obvious thing in the world lol
---
Stupid Sexy flanders...
---
R/gamephysics
---
I have said we shouldn’t fight about stealing memes and such but this is downright evil...
---
pretty impressive having a 1.5 kd with tachanka. youre the lord weve been in need of
---
Nice 🙌🏻
---
At the time I drew this, there were 45 million players and over 45 ops released, hence the mugs! Thanks for asking!
---
I couldn't agree more OP
---
Remember billions of years ago when the universe didn't exist?
---
I'm really not trying to be a dick, but these are just not good ideas.  I appreciate what you're trying to do, but these ideas definitely need work.  
---
Cav is fine as she is.  The reason her pings are so good is because it's a high risk to interrogate someone.  
---
Jackal is not a global ability.  A global ability example would be lion or finka, where you press a button and you get an instant effect on the entire game.  He affects one operator.  How that operator is handled with is a different story.  His ability does not need to be changed, and I would say jackal is in a decent place.  
---
The dok thing cant happen.  Her entire character is rendered useless.  I see why you said this, because of the lore, but you cant just have a person rendered useless at spawn because of op choices.  
---
Castle doesnt need another gun, his barricade needs work.  
---
The AA12 fills a specific niche but will never be replaced by the primaries of maestro and alibi because they have the bailiff.  Just leave it as is, for the memes, like the bosg and 417.  
---
The c75 isn't a bad idea, but would give vigil two dominant weapons, which is one reason the SMG12 was nerfed.
---
I took it with a phone
---
nice bit of detail. probably one of the better pieces of art on the subreddit lately. great job
---
Death penalty for LESION players sounds better imo.
---
Uh.....no?
---
Only thing i can think of is lower ranks
---
they are reworking barricades for O:PS so this should happen less often
---
Says the blitz main.
---
Thank you again, that means a lot!
---
Also your username made me chuckle, I have fond memories playing Black Ops zombies (if that's what it's referencing).
---
It's a bug.
---
Or was an ADS.
---
F**k you now I'm hungry!
---
Nøkk cause she's fun.
---
Warden cause he has a moustache.
---
I fail to see the issue here
---
Why is the k/d and win ration above 1? How many clutches?
---
Me too.
---
Lesion is literally always useful on defense, nobody will complain if you play Lesion. Even at diamond ELO.
---
Capitao is also excellent after his buff, he's one of the best utility ops and you can flex between a fragging and support role thanks to his xbow. Whereas most fragging ops are kind of stuck in their role.
---
I can understand the disappointment in Ying, she doesn't have the best gun and it takes a decent amount of practice and map knowledge to take full advantage of her situational gadget.
---
Cool
---
Damn, hoss, you need some fps.
---
haHAHAAH LORD TACHANKA XD BEST MEME!!!
---
Should’ve shot it out beforehand lol
---
It must be foockin joke. But funny
---
Yeah. And also console secure area.
---
This probably works in Gold/Low Platinum
---
There were some connectivity problems on pc🤔
---

This looks soooo ridicoulus.
---
Oi you're criticising me bc I use the reflex on echo, but let's talk about the criminals who use the mf red dot on DMR
---
Glaz, Blitz, Capitao, Ying all finna get raped
---
I got this skin as my first legendary maybe 2 weeks ago and as much as I like it I wish it was for a gun I used
---
Hold up
---
But i have to admit the system kind of works I was in a similar game where we went 1-0. Everyone starting tking, it went 1-2 and since no one could tk after that we won the casual, sure we were not helping each other my mate got downed by the enemy and they let him die but at least we were not shooting each other
---
You are not playing devils advocate, you are just refusing to understand why those decisions were beeing made my dude \^\^
---
Ye legendary skin gang ✊

I'd give you diamond but I'm too broke

I dont get why caviera's who get 2 injures kill 2 people and not kill 1 and interrogate the other
---
Its whoever gets on them first 🤷‍♀️
---
^^^credit ^^^the ^^^^fookin ^^^artist ^^^you ^^^reposter
---
Both are cancerous operators in their own ways. So you should be fine with either one. I suppose Valk is a bit easier to get good at.
---
Its not yours though.
---
Pretty sure it’s just a visual glitch
---
Brøëther!
---
Do not worrue mozzie a mavrick walked in after and i interigated them do not worry im just pissed i didnt clip uo to that part
---
And admit it, all these hours on doc are spawn peeks
---
at least you can clean your shitty charm
---
Bro ur almost at 69! Dont stop yet
---
*bruh*
---
_bruh_
---
Kaid is useful at aiding Bandit tricking since that has a number of counters now. (Mav, Zofia, Capitao, -etc)
---
I think he’s a little underwhelming if played by the wrong player, but in the right situations and with the right player he can be amazing. Not op though
---
You can stand under my umber-ela
---
Looks good but how will it work when they add more and more ops?
---
I use alibi with the shotgun and fuckin blast everything in ranked
---
Tachanka isn't actually that week and can be viable sometimes
---

How does this help? lol
---
So should an Israeli CTU but if they are not gonna add Israeli operators, no one is getting the TAR 21

Or at least it was u til they nerfed it i to a normal pistol

IDF is too much of a "sensitive" matter. people will be butthurt over it taking it above and beyond where it should be.
---
its a game. treat it like one. have fun in it. 
---
the whole idea of R6 is special operators from across the world joining together to beat some organization (that you mop the floor with in terrorist hunt)
---
so why shouldn't everyone be welcome there? the whole idea of R6 is universality. not universalty.

Wow,glad that someone could curb might of this beast:D

---
Kaid wouldn’t drink beer at all. He has a 99% chance of being Muslim, and alcohol consumption is forbidden in Islam.
---
Doing the lord's work
---
No need for such an outdated gun. You've got Fuze and recruit with AK12, then you've got Nomad with AK-74M. And after that you've got Zofia with Beryl M762 which is based on AK.
---
Me no like big words
---
no that is someone else the real jager is spawnpeeking somewhere else
---
Indeed, take me for example, I used to play on a 8 year old pc which used to barely hold 70-80, so naturally I used to lose a lot more gunfights against people with good PCs in high level Platinum, whereas now that I've upgraded I'm much more consistent when it comes to killing people you could say lol.
---
I feel like he's crossing into overpowered but no one plays capitao in ranked anyways.
---
You are doing god’s work, ty Killimaze!
---
Lol trying to point out irony or something? I don't have anything against Jewish people or Israeli people in general. Fun fact, many Israelis support Palestine and truly just want peace and equality. But sadly, many others don't. And many of those are in the IDF. No terrorist factions (for player characters) in the game, so I'd prefer no blatant war criminals either. Just my personal opinion, and I'm glad Ubi hasn't included Israel in the game so far.
---
I don't care
---
Thank you! I'm defintely having fun
---
No. We don't. Maybe you should do some searching where you see IDF, backed by US military might, routinely oppresses a population with barely more than sticks and rocks sometimes, and gets away scot free doing things like shooting unarmed neutral doctors. Zionist, well armed war criminals with lobbying, money, influence, media control, and of course, ulterior motives.
---
So glad Israel isn't in the game. Goodbye.
---
what skin is that on your weapon?
---
Very mature.  I legit write out an opinion and there’s always going to be a representation of the toxic part of siege that everyone knows and doesn’t love.
---
C‘mon let‘s _destroy_ the economy
---
And Netenyahu is a warmonger hoping to eliminate the Palestinian people who have just as much a right to live in the region.
---
This would work even better with an alibi
---
Yeah I get headshot from around corners I’m not even peaking but I’m moving toward
---
I know It’s stupid to ask but I’m new here, how do I have these icons after my name (I’m a Bandit/Twitch main
---
It's still in the process of doing so, sadly.
---
Good, find yourself a bunch of mates to play with aswell, obviously they'll help you out
---
Yeah it’s weird
---
Exactly, its the sort of thing where I think it won't matter for me too much because I'm not at a point where I've refined it loads but I can already see that I'm slowly improving but it takes games with a kd of 5 to bring it up by .1
---
I had one with 10 kills to 2 deaths (complete luck I assure you) and stayed at 0.8 k/d with a total of 17 matches. 
---
Once I get to a point where I can consistently do well I'd love it to reset per season but its not going to be for a while luckily
---
Illuminate the Palestinian people? Yeah sure. Give me the source
---
It’s the slow death
---
This might be the first season in a while where I buy all four seasonal weapon skins. Saved up about 65k renown gotta keep grinding!
---
He’s broken. My change doesn’t change this but looking back, probably should’ve been the direction they took
---
When the bully picks on your child but you can’t beat them up like you would while fighting terrorists.

Just added ya:) I get off work around 10 if you're a night owl
---
Rather be permanently banned than interrogated
---
Games usually have a shitpost/meme sub, if you posted there you wouldn't get banned for filling up the main sub with low effort content
---
Don't know if you're joking or not, but I didn't mean something dumb like civil war weaponry. I love those guns, but "dumb" as in why would SF be using that now. I just want some old weapons actually used by SF in the not too distant past, guns which have some **PERSONALITY** . Most of the new high-tech guns just seem like the same old automatic motorboat to me. So boring.
---
u may have only hostage gamemode on, that was the reason for my long Q times
---
He’s not broken, he was broken at launch but he’s fine now. His scar isn’t the best of ar’s, the dmr is way better.

He’s not broken he’s terrible his shield blocks 2 bullets he’s slow when using it scar has bad recoil he’s a pretty bad character unless you only main him
---
Teabag teabag
---
I'm not going to debate with you at all, you can do your researches late. I am glad that they added Ash as an Israeli-Zionist-Jewish operator. And also the added the IDF in their newest game "World War Z the game". I'm glad that people recognize the IDF as a legitimate army

The recoil isn't that bad. I use angled grip and muzzle brake and it's fine
---
Let’s play spot the silver
---
*i win*
---
Obviously just outplayed
---
tbf the devs have even said themselves that she originally had an AR (and you can even see on her model she has AR magazines) but they decided it was way too strong and changed her to have an smg instead. It very well might have been a galil originally.
---
Oof last time I used him it was pretty bad but then again I run compensator and vertical grip
---
Woah
---
He's high af dude!
---
Sadly, yes. I am but a lowly console pleb.
---
That bothers me that nokk and warden are flipped
---
Really bad repost where is the source and you also know this whas already posted on this supreddit.
---
Listen, I am a supported of the 2 states solution. And I also think that the settlements are bad for peace. But no one wants to "illuminate the Palestinian people" as you said
---
Blocking a headshot whereby it would be killed every other operator 100% of the time is broken when the game revolves around this mechanic. It’s a handicap that completely removes any ounce of skill and counterplay. 
---
As for his weapons, the scar is better. Full auto, hits like a truck and has low recoil. The DMR after the damage nerf is mediocre. 
---
At least with a DMR, they’re a lot harder to use and provides more counterplay especially against a poor player. I’d much rather face a BB with the DMR and I think this would’ve at least alleviated a few frustrations as there would be more counterplay overall. Still broken though
---
Obv that I'm a night owl, I'll be home from 5PM till late night!
---
Run muzzle brake, I find it controls his recoil a lot better
---
Lmao
---
His personal opinion and experience can’t be wrong.
---
Me and my friends ran a strat once where we brought Bandit, Castle, Mute and Jäger, barricaded the fuck out of the objective and all sat inside. Somehow managed to win 2 rounds like that, but on the third they brought Thatcher and Fuze
---
Some adjustments definitely need to be made but honestly this is one of the more accurate charts on the site. Some people are just straight stupid on here. Not you though :)
---
But g3 is in the game
---
WHY ISNT TACHANKA IN S TIER. YOU FOOOOL
---
G3 is in the game
---
Honestly this was such a fun set up to use on cod, I don’t blame him for giving it a shot lol
---
And each shot fired costs you 10hp due to your wrist getting messed up.
---
An augs foregrip closes forwards not backwards
---
Well you can get flashed, then recover immediately when you turn them on which makes no sense.
---
Actually facts in bo2 on any assault rifle
---
I hate this ads that say click now to start download. They hurt my brain
---
ubi might nerf soon due to him being so quiet and powerful against uncoordinated teams
---
If you are fine with that then you have to learn the best places to make holes
---
Actually its cause you snack yourself in the nose with each shot
---
I got that legendary yesterday and it does not kinder me joy. 😐
---
I don’t think the mp7’s grip can lock on an angle
---
So.... lower rank I’m guessing?
---
Ha!Got Di!
---
Yes it can
---
It has no function right now. That’s my point
---
The fact montagne is in D means you havent seen a good montagne
---
I feel like Glaz shoul be A or S tier. He’s def better than that.
---
same
---
These are all dumb ideas for what the game is. If you want to use last gen tech go play CODMW. Siege is based around SF/SOF units so why would they use old ass piece of shit guns.
---
The spawn location was on the screen before hand.

---
The blitz I don’t think so cuz his shield range is 3 metres (correct me if I’m wrong)
---
60 to one armours if I recall correctly, then it scales down to 40 for 3 armours, which currently are only 3 on attack, 2 armour ops take 50 or so.
---
Damage does change somewhat depending on the position of the attacker however.
---
Lol ok
---
Ye. Silver II
---
5m
---
It can’t.
---
But I don't play ranked anyways
---
Are yall low golds or silvers? His ability just doesnt fit to this game. 1 hs game and an operator with a face sheild. Yeah so balanced. You can attach an angled grip on scar which will make it's ads time just like the other rifles. His rpm might be slow but he has the highest damage among all rifles: 49. If you crouch, your hp is basically 160. Not to mention he has two of those. He can run faster with the deagle out. Deagles also getting buffed this season and he isnt that slow with the sheild on. Its the same speed as 3 armour operators. Just purely broken.
---
Still it’s inconsistent as hell
---
Yahoo! Yahoo! Yayayayayayyyyyayayayayyyahoo!
---
What has no function? The foregrip on the aug? That foregrip is the reason why the default aug has so much less recoil than other default rigles
---
Son, I think you’re retarded, his gadget is utter shit. Yeah it breaks that law, but that’s the point of him. I would agree with you if his shield had more health like it did when he came out. But now with 60hp, he’s easy to beat.
---
Isn't that the dance to summon the dragons from Avatar: The Last Airbender  ;-}

How is that gold but a teachable chino is blue

You’re a CrapKan main. 😑 you set traps and forget about them, and hide in closets. But. Ok. The deep roamer with a high skill ceiling is a noob OP

Hello libulb, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bus30z/r6_tts/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I’m actually getting really good at r6 so if you wanna hit me up on pc I’d be fine with it
---
Do you remember how strong his dmr used to be? It still is an absolute monster, but the mk17 got some buffs so it’s viable now.
---
I just want my deplorable shield back first .
---
perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Yes but I’m biased 
---
Also whenever I play him I get vote to kicked why is that I’m new??
---
MOAR
---
There’s not 25 heroes on overwatch is there?
---
Why u mad
---
Oof
---
Why wouldn’t you want two of the really good gun on your team?
---
They where used to exploit a bug where IQ becomes invisible but still able to move and kill.
---
Well, I don’t mean to be rude but if you don’t play ranked then talking about balancing changes is basically useless. The game is the way it is because of changes for ranked; however, I do agree they need to rework blitz, just don’t know how yet
---
True, in wind bastion I feel it was pretty good, but it got worse in burnt horizon.
---
Looks like hes? Shes? Gona do the ricardo flick
---
Idk it looks like another AUG variant
---
Cheers man!
---
The creams not going to add it’s self
---
That’s why I wan it
---
Yeah it’s completely their fault lmao I don’t know why they’re complaining. Even had a solid second to even just melee them.
---
If you place the Gu strategically instead of just annoying the attackers then he is the perfect intel operator. I’m on PS4, you?
---
And no CTU would use it
---
And 2 days ago it said 16 days lol. Why should we trust on that countdown? I mean UBI is trying to fix the exploits before going live so until these are fixed theres no accurate date. As simple as that.
---
Dude im pointing at it, cant you see my finger?!?!?!
---
This is not a gamepad gameplay
---
How is it overpowered? It’s a peashooter with less damage and equal recoil to SMG12, but it’s a primary and unsupressed.
---
Why must you ruin my fantasies?
---
I bet you spawn peek on house
---
The only improvement is showing the objective/spawn on the op selection screen.
---
house isnt in ranked pool so i cant
---
this does put a smile on my face
---
Exactly in casual

I dont play casual

the emoji smile button has them all in it

Yea, it only shows one
---
Wait which one is the real one?
---
You should, it can be really fun to mess around on
---
x 24
---
Also forget to mention jager became invisible for the enemy team for the rest of the round.
---
so you're saying you spawn peak on house
---
You realize the UMP, MP5, M4, revolvers, F2, AR33, and probably some others I can’t think of right now are “old ass” guns, right? No? Didn’t think so.
---
The crossover from video game player to having actual knowledge about the military or its weaponry is clearly not there, as exemplified by many comments in this thread... oof.
---
How did smoke detonate a kapkan trap?

Alright, I'm going to keep the speaker, but I am going to change the ammunition ability.

Used to when Jagër had his acog

At least it's not Skyrim again

Lol I was joking friend

Yep, client-side debris can get you killed and make the killcam look Sus at the same time.

Oof RIP OP

This is cursed

are we playing the same game?

Ok,didn't know that it only had two positions

Looks cool!  Which CTU’s use it and where is it manufactured?

Nice

B i did have a full team of 5v5 recruits doing stupid shit but sadly i didnt get
---
I think they mean the bizon
---
The 18 is in counter strike. But yea I’ve heard that too.
---
Why couldn’t they just model it without using the glock name? Call it “Block 34” and change the slide a little bit. Problem solved, anyone that knows guns will know that’s a glock.
---
Did that once but it was the time when i couldn't get out of bronze bc of some fuckers that kept leaving the game, we were 0-3 and we managed to go 3-3 then 3-4 and then we made it 5-4 with only 3 peeps most of the time, never felt so good
---
Ahhhhhh its cancer. Lol, jk,  I actually really like where he is after the rework
---
You could at least find gif with more than 5fps
---
I feel like the CJB-MS would also be a cool gun in this game
---
Yeah I read that too, that did not fix shit for me though.
---
But he is a quitter
---
Why does he look like a muslim man staring at a german flag while recording a youtube video with a bluescreen behind him?
---
YES PLS UBI

Looks like finkas gun a bit

I feel your pain

I can't draw helmets. I tried super hard and felt it was ok to share.
---
The rifle was designed by German small arms manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch, and shares design and engineering with their G36 rifle. It is also used in the Riyal Malaysian navy, I’ve seen it on a lot of other games from Ubisoft like Ghost Recon future soldier as well as a variant on Rainbow Six Vegas 2, I would love to have it in R6!
---
Looks like Ella’s scorpion
---
I'm laughing in my bed watching this

Aye cause Finka's *really* OP isn't she?

It's like that since 2 years

A legion of pissed off muslims would disagree.

It is okay to share this. Tbh i can’t draw anything myself and this looks actually nice. I just shared my thoughts with this one i hope you aren’t mad

yeah that dosent look right

Imagine every person that dropped legendary posted it on reddit.

You have a compass at the bottom of your screen to tell you.
---
I totally get that, I think i'm being a little bit selfish asking for an update as it's been 6 days. As I said a simple update for those that don't go on to the TTS how things are going. But at the same time for a AAA title company maybe it's not too selfish to get regular updates.
---
I welcome the new season with open arms with a claymore at the door.
---
XM-8 from Ghost Recon plz
---
im boutta unsub
---
Nope, the tar is way overrated
---
Just checked the website, thanks so much for the suggestion! I'll try it out ASAP, should have some sick gameplay soon!
---
Don’t buy year two bundle, just use the r6 credits for r6 credit items only. It may take a while but just use renown it is so much cheaper and gives you something to aim for and enjoy more.
---
gotta hand it to him, he's got pretty good handwriting.
---
I think he got *Peeked* though.
---
&gt; Heckler &amp; Koch G3
---
Yes. Or have another sort of Glaz operator on the defender side that has an MSG-90 or something
---
It was a play on words. I meant in terms of usage haha.
---
FN FAL please
---
Ay yo whaddup that's me. The bad guy is over there bro
---
Ubi is to scared of backlash to add IDF/Mossad
---
Ubisoft has long given up on putting in thematically accurate weaponry in favor of what's already balanced. If, say, Nokk or Warden got new guns they'd need different stats to be different from the rest and inevitably something would be wrong.
---
Oh god I'm not mad. Tbh it was only a doodle from memory plus i dont have a decent yellow pen.
---
I did it
---
Yea, they're gonna suspect them because they see frost has been detected...
---
Do you know how?
---
Yes I know, I'm just going along with the fact that people are dumb.
---
No video game has ever invented a gun really, they're all based on real life weapons.
---
Unfortunately, Recruit isn’t gonna be playable in ranked next season. 
---
Recruit may eventually be a thing of the past in the coming years.

F2000 is in game it’s just called the f20 it’s what gridlock has

Huh, I see, a little hard to understand at first, but did get it after pointing it out.

Hey it’s you again

Maybe give the TAR 21 to Nokk

Yeah, that was all on you, my guy.

I thought it was the penetration achievement too I guess.

I'm pointing at the guy over there! God are you blind?

im new here but i hear a lot of people say too broad of callouts even in plat rank,some common shit-outs are as listed but not limited to: the door, the balcony, or even better.. ThE wInDoW HeS aT tHe WiNdOw BrOh!!!! etc.. that shit doesn't help, like what window? which 1 out of 20 is it buddy? or especially since im new they expect me to know where the table they are talking about is at in a room and shit, as if i will remember the table placement in a room example: "aye hes behind the table" . AND doesn't help when people say "on me" or something, like i know their voice and recognize who they are lmaooo...  im done crying thx for reading
---
Well you are right up on them, so yes it still sucks from range
---
Not @. Use u/
---
I would say a or s
---
Ayy I took that screenshot :D
---
So you mean a 3 speed operator with 40 (+1 oitc) bullets at 1000+ rate of fire isnt op? Did you know that if you headshot someone it's always a one-shot kill or are you from some kind if different planet? More rate of fire means higher chance of shooting someone in the head. With the recoil you just need a bigger ADS sens, hol it down and wiggle it left and right. That's it.
---
Also didnt even talk about GRZMOT mines that she has 3 of these (Zofia has 2) that you can preplace into spots that you cant even shoot out with Twitch's drone. Also if you run into one of these, it fucks with your sens and vision.
---
You humble me with your kind words

Ew gross.

The only problem is if you be softeners using Microsoft servers that means they would have to convince Microsoft to waste their time and money in order to fix it. And since Microsoft doesn’t specifically care about one video game out of the thousands on its platform I doubt that will happen. Ubisoft is probably too cheap to switch to their own servers as well so it looks like we’re stuck where were at
---
True that’s why I cry every night xD
---
Give Spetsnaz Recruit the good ol' AK-47. I'd probably play nothing else but that.
---
Either a level for each of the base operators or a level for each CTU, where you play as the ops in certain parts
---
The headgear is for bandit
---
Who cares about k/d in Rainbow I mean the depth in this game is awesome my gf has a 0.7 kd and bronze 1 still plays in a full squad of golds and gets mvp regularly I always say I don't care about your rank or your k/d as long as you can talk and you want to win we can play.
---
It's more the other way. Europeans poke at America much more online than the other way around. I'm pretty sure most of America can go years without even thinking about Europe.
---
Didn't answer the question but you spent $60 4 years ago and now expect a refund on a product / service you've used for 4 years? 
---
So you believe that because of the current issue (which in fact is against the law to DDoS anything in most places) You deserve a full refund for 2 hours a day every day for 4 years? (which works out to around 3,000 hours)
---
Well I mean if they release two from both sides what controversy will there be since there is one from each side
---
It’s probably the person who just died giving the callout that they just died.
---
My squads Cav gets atleast like 2 interrogations per match and considering her ability tells the whole team where the whole enemy teams is I don’t see how it’s at all selfish it’s basically the greatest callout of all time
---
Over there! LEFT LEFT LEFT SHARP LEFT NONONO LITTLE BIT RIGHT. MORE RIGHT. *i fucking died* U SAW HIM THERE DUDE!
---
No probs. Glhf.
---
You’d be surprised, as an American several people here genuinely thinks Europe is socialist, then again some Europeans think all Americans believe that, which isn’t the case either.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
---
Unironically attained Copper IV. Started at Gold 2 and then it just went down from there. The lesson is, don’t solo queue with a broke mic because even if you play support, your team will fail you.
---
If you all were kicked. Then most likely you all had internet failure or servers went down etc. And if there's no one on your team the game automatically loses and you get abandoned
---
Oh shit, I thought they were calling him a Mongoose. Cause those things are fast f***ing nightmare fuel as well
---
The hard send is what I live for when playing finka
---
Her scorpion is a carbine one,  i don't know why but my gun type ocd kicked in there.  But yes her scorpion is total shit. Its damage of a pitiful max 23 is nothing especially past 20m which then it drops down to 15 which isn't very good. Her weapon vertically is okayish but horizontally is for the most part random in its state. Ammo wouldn't change anything as it's already okay,  unless you mean reserve ammo than okay id be down for that. But recoil buff and damagw buff to its actual bdamage or drop off for the damsge would likely be best for her. And outside her gun to remove barbed wire and either add her impacts back or that proximity alarm that's been in the files for a while since those would actually add something to her weak kit.
---
I paid money to play a video game fair and square without having the servers hit. If they cannot give me that experience then yes I expect a refund. I didn’t pay money to have someone hit the servers every time I try to win a game. And it’s honestly depressing that Ubisoft as a company lets their customers suffer like this and doesn’t do anything about it.
---
Oh sorry, must be late to the party
---
Copper 4? I heard callouts like that on Plat,wtf
---
\*Gets shot in head\*
---
"On my body"
---
what did you bring upon this cursed land
---
Because the p9 is for smol pp bois
---
I'd say on ping is the most reliable callout you can give because there's no potential for it to be an inaccurate callout, on ping means that they *are* on ping. I'll take that over "over there" any day.
---
Add .fAze to your name and you won't die as much
---
That's gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
Back in the days this game was supposed to be serious can you believe it?
---
But you have to look around for the ping
---
Nah, niggardly
---
Yeah because a mouse flick takes forever
---
Given that we need more people on the TTS because the queue times are bullsh*t long, yes, I completely agree with this.
---
We already have the MP443. But what I do want is the ASh-7 or SR1MP.

Do you now what the say about people with big guns there compensating for there tiny tiny penis
---
Unplayable.
---
No he's right it's just a very fast and intense point and click game
---
Im only doing this because of an UNFORTUNATE accident involving my main laptop, which was barely holding on, resulting in 2 months of sad waiting and lamenting.  I think i deserve this considering the absolute DEAL i got for this one, saved 100 bucks, i think i deserve to reward myself.
---
Same! I remember it had a blue tinted red dot sight
---
But what if you use pings and say over there?
---
Whats funny is Im at 420 hours lol
---
Mdr is junk compared to the Tavor series rifles. Maybe in a video game it'll be good but irl it sucks.
---
Because holding a loaded gun close to her face won’t cause any problems....
---
But the only thing you need to do in this game is shoot the heads that’s it the only catch is that you need to be fast
---
when they die i dont even need a callout. i probably should have clarified more, but like my teammate will be in a firefight amidst what everyone else is trying to hold down/do and he is yelling "on me, on me"
---
I guess being small, ethnically homogeneous, and landing on resources is the key to civilization now.
---
Actually not because the weapon comes with a fixed sight and dps would be similar toe a smg maybe 35 so no acog anyway
---
Some of you plats need to work on your callouts too. “On my X” or “On me” might as well be a yellow ping sometimes
---
That was before the overwatch waifu sfm animators realized that they couldn’t just keep doing the same thing
---
Scared sounds
---
Can't go outside in drone phase so it's not that
---
I hate Finka because they just shotgun rush and I can't pick Clash to counter them😡
---
Really though if I’m fighting four guys and I lose and see “you suck” in my messages I’m ignoring it
---
Tachanka Main on 420 hours. Yep. That's funny too.
---
Ping shows up on your compass, so you don’t even need to look to know the direction.
---
On your left
---
There will ALWAYS be luck in a game, especially an online PvP one. You can NEVER remove the element of luck. Nevertheless, skill will still be the basis of the game.
---
It's funny how people think 1shs should be removed because low rankers spray upwards and win and they get salty, but completely miss the fact that plat, diamond and PL is basically crosshair-on-the-head-at-all-times thanks to 1000s of hours of practice.
---
Student loan... 😂 I don’t get it lol
---
The comment just comes off as butthurt not banter, and it's hard to tell when people are joking in text format

As soon as I saw that I just thought of tachanka whimpering like are smol cat

Bro copper 4 gang where u at

He is litterally on the map!!!!

Oh shit, thats why Ubi made it so that Glaz cant shoot through Castle Barricades.

i first played last sept. i was a copper 4. then i got good and hit plat twice this season
---
Thx captain obvious
---
It was leaked there would be a Mexican and a Peruvian operator one having the ability to climb up bottom hatches most likely the Peruvian ones due to the mountains in that region.
---
Doesn’t the ping show up on compass if i’m not wrong?
---
I really dont understand how someone can be a copper if theyre trying to play. I bet all the coppers are gamer dads who play like twice a month or something.
---
Ask your friend if he has the OG Shark camo for the famas 😎
---
When you live in merica you will have to pay for school, university etc. 
---
 
---
Many students take loans in order to pay for these things and then he named himself studentloan
---
"Don't you do it! Don't you say it!"
---
Yeah I'd rather have someone say on ping, or just ping in general. Instead I get "He's near the objective" or "Down the hall near the window"
---
I bought a washing machine to wash my clothes fair and square. So I understand how you feel, I didn't pa money to have a piece of machinery to fail on me after 11 years of use, I took it back to the shop and demanded a refund because it's not doing it's job. /s 
---
You sound pretty entitled, I don't think people are DDoSing your matches because they cant take a loss, it's most likely because of the way you behave
---
Did I just heard reinforce kids bedroom?
---
I think you got struck out.
---
The killed you reference is because the loan is so big and almost impossible to pay off
---
Oh ok, I guess that then would be a problem
---
#**ON YOUR LEFT!**

I'm currently copper 4 because I solo qued in gold and lost so much I went to copper and now all my teammates are throwers or just really bad players or leavers so I'm now in an endless loop of losing which means that I'm now at 500 elo and I need 1400 to get to copper 3
---

Wow, thanks for telling me that, I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier. This simplifies it compared to toggle-hold.
---
I tried hard to derank as low as possible to boost my no-hand friend. I was playing without sound or with PS3 DualShock. Lowest I got was Bronze 1, every match there was just like terrohunt.
---
And I’m sorry for my English since I am from Denmark :)
---
Well... that's going to get fixed.
---
I met a 9 year old, actual copper 4. Who plays every weekend.
---
That's because the attack rushed and the defense is too dumb to set up a good, strategized defense to slow them down.
---
Same lol fucking hate defense got sick of it
---
i hate terrorist hunt challenges, all of 'em.
---
Currently I cant check what is it like in the fridge
---
Sorry for poor quality I was in a rush to my next class

Not till June

This is because he enters the building, deploys his gadget, finds some footsteps, scans them, and looks up to discover the other 4 have already rushed in and he's now playing a 1v5.

\*Laughs in USA, Russia, U.K.
---
I'm not trying to censor the game. I want people to know everything that the Israeli government has done, because then there will be a lot less support for them (probably why Americans support Israel more than Europe) and so we can stop the murder of children. 
---
I don't want them in the game because I don't want to play a game that gives validation to a bunch of criminals and murders and a crooked regime.
---
not sure
---
BBRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTT
---
3 weeks they are released for season pass owners on the 3rd of June everyone else can buy them on the 10th
---
They are fixing it in phantom sight
---
If you que with someone far below your elo to play against people far below your elo, this happens. There is not another way it happens.
---
Israeli ops would be the perfect fit. Mossad or Yamam.
---
**”Brother”**
---
yeah i want shrimps too
---
But you will play with 5 Russian ops in the game.
---
Its her ctu. Everybody assumes she would be. Not the case seeing as how other operators arent always their original nationality afaik

Now it’s https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7z5cQabFz3Xv96HyG1-K-w

Haven’t payed too much attention to it compared to my twitch stream

If you have a genuine Windows License it doesn’t expire.
---
How do i use the op signs?
---
Not from what I've seen. I had 80+ siege players on my friend list, when they reduced the map pool I saw a big drop in the people who play r6. I predict that when they drop secure area (most popular on console) the number of people still playing will be very small.
---
They have emojis for the signs. Search their name you should be able to find it.
---
Accurate. If you’re anchoring on site and you know they have a maverick just be mindful of your surroundings. Honestly his torch is loud enough if your near it. He’s just salty if he gets hit from a long distance
---
Tbh, I've never seen their appeal for airsoft or game cosmetic-wise. In (modded) ArmA 3, they're great, since they provide a full-screen NV/thermal vision, unlike normal binocular (AN/PVS15) or monocular (AN/PVS7) NVGs, but besides that, I think they look bulky, stupid and like you're trying too hard to be an "operator". 
---
Perfect example would be Wildlands. You can have these ones, PVS15s, PVS14s or the ones that Thatcher's night ops skin has on helmets, or wear standalone PVS7s. Idk why, but I just can't stand them.
---
Ofc, they're also useful in GTA Online, since they provide full-screen thermal vision.
---
Ending note: Valkyrie's headgear with AN/PVS7s looks fucking dope.

Extract hostage solo nets you 300 renown every 2 mins (1 minute of gameplay, 1 minute of selecting operator &amp; menuing)

Ohhh that makes sense, nah I was so close to that thing it didn’t matter

Exactly. Maverick was so much fun for the first couple weeks 😂 most players have wised up to it now tho

The C1 is still in service in Canada. No country that I know of uses AKMs for their special forces and the G3 is used by African countries who literally have AIDs

When someone leaves before being interrogated thay should ceep the players body still there and is someone leaves during intero they should get punished in a fun way like When thay try to join a game they have to wait 1 min extra to there search time and when thay join a game it's a normal game but all the players are bots and your team sucks and has low health the other team is the best a bot can be and has a ridiculous amount of health if you win you still lose and if you did this in ranked you'd lose your rank levels too.
---
You also can't leave the matches and the enemy team is all cav's with the name of the cav player you did this too.
---
no?

I mean they've grown in numbers and concurrent players so the stats don't really back up that. I highly doubt it, the same thing will happen that happened last time. Everyone will moan about it to begin with then realise how much better off the game is. Everyone was moaning about pick and ban initially now everyone is on board.
---
I wouldn't say he was playing with his food. It was a double interrogation waiting to happen. If there wasn't a Finka and no one else around that would be an easy win.

That would be the extremely underrated G36C, people hate on this for basically no reason. Yes, the R4C was better in two ways that matter most, damage and RoF. But that doesn’t stop the G36C from being a good gun. And now that it still has a Acog, it’s a great alternative.
---
Go to where you select your main, select them, and then look to the top right corner where is says edit, click on it and then you can add more than one
---
Kapkan traps work for me but these challenges are really funky sometimes.
---
Thats not a daily challenge in this game though...
---
They've grown in numbers mainly due to free smurfs, Far cry 5 is Ubi's best selling game over the past 5 years and I doubt it's sold 50M+. Concurrent players are up on pc because they like to play old things over and over and over.
---
A fair point.
---
C OMEGALUL NSOLE
---
If the leaks from the past weeks are tue then Maverick is gonna have a counter. There are rumors of an operator that is supposedly gonna be able to patch up walls.

Everyone thinks old music was just better because they don't realize all the terrible music that is simply forgotten. Time is a great filter for quality music, usually.
---
Otherwise finding new angles always helps

Curveball yourself...try a new operator with a gun you almost never use and see what new skills you can pick up.
---
I dont know why you are being downvoted 😂 I agree. Here comes the -20
---
Uhh I’m on console and the c8 with acog is so much easier compared to the scorpion, you should compare them again.
---
Yes this game is awesome
---
I'm 20 and I can confirm. It's only the "I'm14andthisisdeep" crowd who like her music and personality.
---
then you didn’t look. in every post it says when they should come back.
---
I think it’s way too early to be talking about season 3 but if I had to say I’d want to see the proximity alarm. In the voice lines of every op released since Chimera there is a mention of a proximity alarm gadget. It’s making me think one of 2 things. 
---
1: it’s a secondary gadget for either attack or defense.
---
2: it’s someone’s unique gadget.
---
I’m more for the second one as I don’t think we need anymore secondary gadgets for either side.
---
I highly doubt free smurfs are the main cause, it'll make up some of the number for sure but not as many as you think. Well siege is "old" by console standard so why is everyone still playing on console? Plus people on pc like to play good games.
---
Not intended but..... doble kill!!
---
In real life angled grip would not help you bring the gun up at all. The angled grip was made for people who like to cup their fingers around the top of the rifle for longer range shots.

3- gun licenses aren't easy to come by.

4- game isn't realistic

5- game engine is old and data limits exist.
---
6- game isn't realistic.
---
Any gun can be balanced, but there comes a point when adding new guns to a set of guns either becomes difficult to balance or difficult to set apart from other guns statistically, effectively making the guns just skins of another gun. Consider a game like Battlefield 4 that had like 60 guns and half of them were useless because they just had stairstep differences that didn't provide any advantage. Obvs guns are op restricted in this game, but I think we're approaching the point where we don't need many more guns in the game.

That isn't true in terms of receiver longevity. I feel added weight would also translate to better stability as well
---
A) My brain decided to fuck up the Attacker/Defender bit on Chalet. Arg.
---
B) I think the Road to SI was popular for a number of different reasons, not just the limited map pool. Of course, some played just for the reward packs from challenges, not because they liked it. Some just like pro  league rules. And some liked the small map pool. Arguing that road to SI was popular just because of its smaller map pool, however, is, I'm sorry, ludicrous.  That's like saying Christmas is popular because of holiday cheer. It's not wrong, but neither is it the whole truth.
---
C) By your very Logic, we should just remove half of the operators from rotation, too. Too complex. Too diverse. Too much depth. Because in order to be competitive, we should remove large chunks of content from the competitive side, so we don't have to remember as much. Really.
---
I swear, in casual, I enjoy kanal, plane, and even yacht, but favela is so f**Ked up.
---
Holy shit how much faster do you want it to ADS?!?
---
Seriously there is no problem with this gun except for it's totally unrealistic sniping range
---
wow u bad
---
I haven't played enough Capitao in general to where I can say for sure. I'm basing this solely on my experience with the operators, I can't say for certain with every single one because with some, I haven't had enough time to figure out my full opinion on them.
---
It’s the expansion of his love for Jesus Christ,amen

It's the sticker you peel off when you unbox it
---
&gt; 80% of the r6 playerbase is on console
---
Do you even have proof of that number?
---
Honestly I think all operators are great, it’s really situational I feel. Some ops do better than others and I also think it has something to do with who’s playing the op as well.
---
I think they increased the range of breaching charges when they changed them bc I killed someone from above on accident too
---
Doc is a must pic. Prolly the best op in the game
---
cool idea but the mp7’s ADS time is already pretty fast it wouldn’t really do much
---
They NEVER said that.
---
They said "no ETA"
---
Such as, the f2, which we all know is a famas
---
Except it doesn't really exist. Some mall ninjas made a single Uzi knockoff firing proprietary APDS rounds for highly dubious reason that kinda-sorta penetrate armor and maybe-kinda kill people.
---
Then they made sure no one ever got to actually test it and made a dumb website talking about how it could totally replace not only SMGs, but* assault rifles and actually belt-fed machine guns*
---
&amp;nbsp;

The CJB-MS should be ignored like the vaporware fantasty gun it is.

I'm 25 and this song rips my dude

shit would be so broken, just like mav, no counters to it

Actually suggested that as a Defender gadget for an Israeli operator.

Gave the attacker M14 "toe-popper" mines as a counter-roamer device.
---
Oh.. so like.. do you have any evidence to support this statement?

Why did it take 800 bullets to kill him? Is this Console thing?

I do agree mostly but IMO some operator's gadgets/weapons are better than others. I do think it mostly comes down to who is the better player and it's why many people can make even some of the "worst" operators shine.

Really Gaz should have a.50 cal sniper rifle

The 47 and the AKM looks the same. The AKM has a few reinforcing ribs on top and a muzzle break.

Eeeeeh, can't complain. Every time I play her I can't help but feel I'm on easy mode with how good the F2 is.

It's easy: If the match says "Normal" whilst you queued for Hard or Realistic, it's A5. The only surefire ways to get rid of A5 is to play Squad-only or turn off bomb.

Don't really want to get into it on this sub, but she basically has a personality that says "Hey! I'm weird and different! Look at me! Look I am suicidal!! I have dark thoughts, hahaha I'm so unique!"
---
My sister's generation goes gaga over this shit, and it's not a healthy outlook on life. 
---
This faux "depression" is just normal everyday stress, and a conscious decision to not make an attempt to cope with stress.
---
Maybe next season. I have a suspicion that the rest of the seasons for this year will recycle weapons as well.
---
Maybe wait for the new ops. They both look very useful and cool and you wont have to learn new guns really.
---
Why they didnt go with the Desert Tech MDR .308 for Finka is beyond me.
---
Playing an hour isn’t knowing the op, I strongly disagree with a lot of this, but standing out to me are Capitao, IQ, Maverick, Blackbeard, and Smoke
---
DRUGS
---
Caps AR
---
Which operator has that?
---
Pretty good, job execpt i'd say the crouching you chrouched like almost all of the clip and aiming down sight while moving. Your able to lean without your ADSing use that. Sorry just had to say that was on my mind entire time while watching the clip again.
---
Or it’s 1-0 and your temp is much better than you that you don’t even see an enemy the entire match
---
Get out of 2003 man. THE FUTURE IS NOW OLD MAN. I like the Bcm stubby grip.

Thats a proximity mine.
---
&gt; Who the fuck plays T-Hunt defense? No one!
---
Yes. There's absolutely nobody at all who enjoys it. Weird how I've got some 800 hours in TH and some people I know have over 2k...
---
I actually did read some and you got a lot of flak for it
---
Its not like they can dump 20 new operators at a time. They're trying to take it slow. Not every idea is going to instantly become made into an operator. We might only be getting certain operators now versus earlier, because they may have still been in development, or the team figured it would be best to hold off on them and put a different ability in its place.
---
Also, people haven't just started asking for an operator like Mozzie. It was brought to question since the beginning.
---
I wish you could turn off the PvP quests.
---
Hesitation is defeat.

She wanted to shoot the camera man but she’s now pissed because she found out that her gun is empty

When people ask that how am I supposed to know it? For the 1v1 at the end I mean, the round is over and in don't have the health icon anymore
---
Knocked with a head shot
---
thanks for contributing to the discussion
---
Are you referring to the smg-11? It is based off of the real life mac-11 and the gun has an incredibly high rate of fire combined a very poor butt stock. These factors result in the gun being incredibly difficult to control.
---
No way. If I wanted to grab something that small I’d grab your dick

I once got gassed by Capitao through one of the drone holes in druglab on theme park, and I tried for like 15 games to play him. 
---
Turns out he's ass so I gave up. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
---
I see crash bandicoot
---
Mira is capitao change my mind
---
I don't think so, but we will obviously get more recycled weapons. I am fine with that, for example in phantom sight they're recycling some of the least used guns for defense, giving them to an attacker ans making them feel different. But since we have guns with certain attachments negated due to gadgets I think that it would be like having new guns. Imagine Buck's c8  or Nomad's arx with a vertical/angled grip

Pls bb. I wish I was that big.

---
Yeah.
---
Tbh, I just wish we had more outfits for ops that only have like 3.
---
No its because every body knows that rainbow six does not follow ballistics in real life and made their own caliber system in the game. You are arguing as if they are using real life caliber rules

---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
I have looked through u/may-mays-are-great's posting history and found 1 N-words, of which 0 were hard-Rs.
---
Agreed
---
It’s solved, as the post says now, but thanks
---
Yeah i'm slowly learning how to actually move and not abuse the sight, I myself watching this two months old video was like "wtf was i really the whole time aiming?" but then i realized that i'm getting better day by day
---
Funny thing, I thought Finka's .308 was some kind of XM model I'd never seen before. Turns out it, too, is just a prototype which I don't think even made it as far as the G11 did. A Russian college kid or someone designed it up.
---
Thought I'd comment just because I've always loved the XM8 and you mentioned prototypes.
---
It really doesn't matter with modern mice, if you like 6000 DPI when doing non-gaming shit, then play at 6k and rebind your DPI button to something useful.  
---
  
---
I'd only mess with the multiplier if you're trying to obtain a specific sens you use in another game, or want to use a wicked high DPI.  
---
As for your issue, I feel like you did something wrong. You should be flying at 100 @ 1500. Can you pastebin your INI file?
---
Not really. You can still have good situational awareness and get fucked regardless. It’s just with no Claymores you’re going to find people being more aggressive and hopping out of windows because they know there isn’t going to be a Claymore there.
---
Yea my favorite type of music is apes banging sticks and stones from the stone age..
---
Cause apparently an operator ability that reduces recoil ( dramatically ) with a semi auto shotgun is comparable to recruit’s pump action 870.

But i know I wont change your mind, so you do you i guess.

be happy nothing to discuss

This is an older clip but i wanted to share it anyway.

I think you need to expand your research beyond Rainbow Six Siege. The Rainbow Six lore is way deeper than just what is presented in Siege. Not to mention, other Tom Clancy titles that fit in the same universe.

Oh alright :) just don’t know why people don’t do it. It’s a big difference.

Maybe he never took the display sticker off?
---
Did they change up the queues recently or did a lot of OG's stop playing? I recently came back to the game after a 2 year hiatus and have been getting 9+ kills per match in short matches. I typically hovered around mid plat for rank, but the game seems much easier than before

Who the fuck is that autistic looking piece or rainbowy garbage?

I feel like a güd counter for maverick would either be to shorten his torch distance or increase bandits shock distance so that if maverick really wants to put a hole in that wall he’ll need to sacrifice some health
---
It's literally a recolored version of Adrian (epic - purple). This is stupid, another shitty legendary. I can't be the only one who likes blue, purple and sometimes even white skins more than most of legendaries ? Getting legendary skin in this game is a psychic tortue. After dozens of games, tens of alpha packs you spot the yellow light, you're expecting something cool and well designed, you click on card - you get a fucking copy of another skin with changed colors, and that skin is one rank lower than legendary. With every new season and new legendaries I'm bothering about alpha packs less and less. It's simply not worth it.
---
Oof.

Room next to armory on Border
---
Not quite the same argument. Headshots excluded (since doc and rook are both helpless in those scenarios), doc is still better. If you live with 17 HP, rook does nothing for you. Doc will help you. And the reason I say you die instantly when downed is because you dont have the ability to revive yourself. Doc revives himself in a decent amount of situations that others could live through given the same ability. Not to mention if his teammates are in clear line of sight, they can also benefit from him. You have to physically revive someone that was downed with rook armor, putting 2 people's lives on the line. Do I think rook is useless? Absolutely not. I think rook probably cracks the top 5 in best ops in the game. But I just dont think he's quite as good as doc

hey i’m miataguyy640 i’m famous now

See the yellow network icon in the top right? Your internet sucks. You teleport backwards at the start of the clip you’re lagging so much
---
This is my fucking life. My friends are so ungrateful
---
It's in the comments. It was one of the first comments.
---
They like to yeet that shit from across the room, in site or not, and there is always a defense problem when there is only one person
---
Thelonious.
---
They do come every 24 hours but it's not per challenge, it's basically per slot if you want to simplify it. You get a new one at the same time every day. Think of it like a midnight (00:00) thing where today becomes tomorrow. Not sure what time exactly that would be for you, but I think all of us gets it at the same time, no matter what time zone.
---
If you don't complete the challenge for today, it it will remain on the slot and when the next "day" comes you get another one. Just as u/Vladesku said, one challenge a day, they just stack up until they fill all the slots you have (3 or 5).
---
ok found it
---
Me got get out
---
And the new operators, especially warden, has a lackluster smg and a very situational ability
---
Try and 5 stack. It's pretty much the only way out
---
Yeah i saw stuff about lesion but im not sure. I was thinking mozzie might be my next go to

What is your build I am really excited to leave the console hellhole and build my 9700k 2080
---
All my friends are on PS4 and I moved to PC, I guess I should try moot
---
You would've assumed that by now they would've changed it, plus if I'm not mistaken it's not entirely a DP-28, if it actually is pretty much entirely a DP-28 then I'm wrong, fair enough.
---
What ash are you today? I'm top right for sure
---
Set up turret in site, don't roam easy too deep, if you make it back to site late game then try and use the turret
---
Glaz has been out since day one and just now are releasing a counter to shoot back through his smoke with Warden. Dont worry, im sure there will be a maverick counter
---
You're doing it wrong
---
Anybody else disappointed that he didn't kill someone with a pencil in the new one?
---
As long as you can get some teammates then sure
---
Rip meme cat

This was a clip from our weekly team plays. I often take a day break between playing siege to refresh and ultimately end up so relaxed i do things I don't normally do.
---
it's not shitty? you know why? THE HACKER GOT BANNED.

(although I have serious reservations as to whether Kaid drinks or not)
---
The animation of being downed takes about 2 seconds, where its pretty instant from your POV. The animation has to finish before you can crawl
---
Sure, will make one tomorrow.
---
Clever
---
Yeah. SASG is fast shooting because it does bad per shot damage. M870 is even more deadly because it usually downs in one shot. Max of two at normal range. Legit got a 4K without reloading the M870 like last week. 
---
Finka shotty is definitely not OP.
---
thanks! and I know if fuze, fuzed that hatch I would have been dead
---
Thats going to be p a i n f u l l y slow chat
---
How do you get multiple icons next to your name cuz it only let's my use 1
---
It's not supposed to fully solve FF, it's a deterrent, you will never be able to solve it so if you don't want to be TK'd find a group or play something else.
---
Removing explosives in a game about destruction is dumb, Ubisoft listened to feedback, a lot of people suggested this system to them and still people complain.
---
Better than nothing
---
Does the animation keep playing when you hit the deck though. Once I'm lying on the floor, I expect to be able to move, otherwise I have no chance.
---
ATK=intel definetly   DEF=Anchor
---
Play Cav for a few rounds, you'll kind of see what I mean
---
Or just listen and pay attention to your surroundings. Finka especially is loud as all hell when she pops adrenaline.
---
This is amazing...
---
I disagree because then if you wanna talk your entire screen is being blocked by the scoreboard, its not gonna work out. Just mute and unsure your mic if you have a quick way to do it
---
The problem is people would inevitably get killed by a player they can't shoot back which would suck.
---
Yes, the RFF system is just a deterrent, if you wanna TK that's perfectly fine, just expect to be banned.
---
Thanks!
---
(You're not the only one! I never thought about it until I posted last night. Maybe it's non-alcoholic, or perhaps he's just posing?)
---
yeah idk why people were bashing it for being unrealistic. the AN/PSQ-20 provides literally the same effect with "fusion" vision technology. It even applies only within a certain little circle of the full vision, like Glaz's device.
---
It's because it's the hokage
---
I don’t play console but I’d think not having text chat would be better. It’d take too long to type.
---
That shoots pencils....
---
Not really. Ubi said that but when you compare nokk even with an AR to the other top entry fraggers she still doesn't compare. She has a selfish ability that is just ok with about 0 utility that she brings to the team in such a utility driven meta. Compare that to zofia, jackal, and ash and she still wouldn't be a top entry fragger in Pro Leauge unless she had an F2 or something. An ash 3 speed can just silent crouch walk at a similar speed to nokk, and being invisible to cameras is niche and might only be consistently effective for planting bomb. Why take that when you can bring someone who is almost guaranteed to be effective on any sight
---
Just deselect the map if you don't want to play it
---
I'm saying for rushers in general you could use traps to slow down rushers or stop the rush completely
---
Beautiful
---
Those are the newer guns and ones that are strong, for Nokk and Warden they have guns that are on the weaker side to balance them out, a leak (not sure if it's real or fake) showed the Year 4: Season 3 attacker having Finka's Spear 308 and PMM handgun, so they go off of the weaker and less used guns.
---
How would you be able to switch between team chat or public chat if you hold the scoreboard button? Would you press another button after holding it down?

It wasn’t a joke.
---
ty. it's the steelseries qck limited if i'm right
---
I legit think people in this thread both the SASG and Finka are OP it's hilarious dude, also I feel you on the M870, it's  legit scary because it's on 3 Speeds, it's pretty good on attack if you rush well
---
brooklyn nine-nine much
---
Kaid because they both are very useful for the team but he is just  ore fun and iferent, besides yu can electrify hatches and deny crucial attacking points for the enemy team soooo....     KAID
---
i also read that name as josuke
---
;-;
---
Well after holding it it will still be displayed and u can press R1 or L1 for Team and Public
---
I downvoted this comment because its relevance to the above post is non-existent.
---
You can grab Jäger's Splinter Cell-esk set from Amazon for straight money, I had a quick search myself. You can probably find Castle's set and a few of the others on there too!
---
Well, I suppose it's because nokk counters alot of operators who have cameras. And vigil just counters drones which don't get me wrong are valuable for attack, but I do think that cameras on defense have more use.
---
I’m honestly pretty sure half the people on this sub are Copper IV lmao
---
I mean it only worked because your opponents were clueless and shit
---
shoot the airjabs or be aware from the noise, besides you can outplay nomad mains simply by making your friend or you the bait, and trust me they will come sprinting to kil you, then is just rely on your friend to get the kill. teamwork my guy. :)
---
Thermite spared you
---
It already exists.  It’s the new camera position.
---
 She’s fine the way she is
---
I like Styx and I wasn't even alive when it was popular :(
---
Turret in window
---
Does she really need another nerf though?...
---
Anyway, she knows the user doesn't have a pulse because she's able to see defender's phones as soon as they are dead, that way, she doesn't rings the phones she see. 
---
How does she see said phones? Well, I could come up with a bullshit excuse, like "smartphones nowadays have so many sensors, they know when you are carrying them and when you're not, one of these sensors being the ones that counts your steps. Dokkaebi has always access to everyone's phones during the match, hence why she can call them, however, if she detects that a defender's phone isn't reading their user's data through the sensors, she doesn't call that specific phone, but pinpoints it on the GPS. She can actually pinpoint everyone's position, but she chooses not to because, since their sensors are active, the information wouldn't be precise (like when you are running and try to see the GPS, the information isn't as accurate as when you are staying still), and of course, unreliable information it's a no-no"
---
Or something like that. I'm not saying that's the reason, but we can always find bullshit ways to justify things, the same way we can always find reasons to say a mechanic makes no sense, like on this case. One of the most obvious being "why won't the traps trigger themselves when an ally is walking over them? How do they know who are the enemies?" And another bullshit excuse would be "the defender's communicate with each other in order to let them know where are the traps, so they all avoid each other traps through mechanics that'd be too hard to animate for the game"
---
I think she could use a slight buff tbh, or just a change. I don't enjoy playing her very much, and a change would make her more appealing.
---
Oooooh, they did Exhile Vilify. Love that song
---
(D2) wormgod caress ornament?
---
Would be op on defense
---
Okay on attack
---
i call that face the face when hit reg doesmt register your headshot but registers theirs so their face is weird from the bullet smashing into their face
---
the f2 recoil isn't random like the scorpion, it's literally just straight up. if your shots are "random" with that, i suggest learning recoil control.

The only change I can think of is to make her fire rate faster a little bit

Really though, I always feel like I do my best after I havent played for a while.
---
I didn't realize that it wasn't Josuke until i read this comment
---
You simplely lack the brain power outwit your opponent in such a pristine environment. The open area always for you to make your own rotate into a new dimension of playing field

I personally don't follow pro leauge players because it's way above my head and honestly I'm not involved. Not that I would know about anything from that time because I started in grim sky. Apparently I haven't learned enough in the short time I've been playing though. And yes I know every op has a unique strength but no one has anything on par to this in my opinion
---
did you have the bad connection or did he?

Doesn't everyone that knows how to play pre fire before going through windows? I've almost never seen her being used by high ranking players..
