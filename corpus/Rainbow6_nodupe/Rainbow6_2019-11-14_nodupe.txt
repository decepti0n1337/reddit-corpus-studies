Apparently she was banned a lot in console...which is bs as I'm on console and she's not banned at all lmao.
---

---
In fact, she's barely played even in casual, her shotgun was just good fun and now they've gone and fudged that up.
---
And same thing with the sasg-12 too. GG guys. :)
---
---
---
At least Warden has a bit of use, especially with this new Nitro.
---
Is that a fucking acog on the BOSG?! Okay, I can get around that.
---
Shame
---
thinking that having a zoom scope on the literal worst primary in the game will make it become an issue. how will a "peek scope" on this absolute meme of a gun make anything unbalanced? the only way you could possibly get spawnpeeked by it is via a one tap headshot. hell, it'd be easier to spawnpeek someone with Clash's smg.
---
im wet
---
Exactly. But their abilities at least don't hinder your teammates like a Grzmot can.
---
The fuck is this shit? Casual is to have fun and not worry about sweats. Why dont they just remove everything except ranked because apparently thats the only thing that matters.
---
If it’s in the test server wouldn’t that mean it’s going to be added? I really hope it does.
---
M762 Has less recoil, What's your Point?
---
I guess team rainbow just threw the idea of helmets out the window

I’m not even sure that’s reasonable.  The top PC player barely scratches 6k and it’s arguable that PC players are, well, better.  Something’s fishy.
---
&gt; What would make my day is if someone from the team like [u/its\_epi](https://www.reddit.com/u/its_epi/) acknowledges that Ela's scorpion could be looked at in the near future. 
---
inb4 they acknowledge it and just nerf it further and I just cackle with glee.
---
Yeah it makes since, tower is a maze and has an awful layout that makes it incredibly confusing and frustrating to attack,plane is to claustrophobic and  has horrible spawns, Favela is a mess impossible to defend on any site since it has to much soft walls, and House is to small making it turn into a frag fest that is heavily in the attacking sides favor.
---
That is very true just adding on to why she’s bad
---
Yeah, which I feel can lead to some issues or frustration in the future. Rook buff can let you survive, albeit with little to no health, but hey, it's a tiny bit better than just being downed immediately.
---
I play on pc, so I think you should come be gold on pc instead of being a cunt! Thank you
---
Might as well play ranked because the AA-DD ruins the whole point of casual
---
ok at first not gonna lie i read it moma
---
And Ned Flanders
---
All you mofos that said #bosgacog are going to start bitching when you guys get cross mapped on clubhouse with a BOSG
---
Getting community opinion to help me figure it out
---
Pretty sure Clash has more bans then Ela but whatevs.
---
Give nøkk bosg
---
Have plenty of them. Unlike you I have real friends that I hang out with on the daily not fuck around in a video game. It’s a shame that the only fulfilling friendship you have is online with some shitty ttv
---
If you die to a 4 speed Ash, blame it on the hitbox
---
That's totally wicked
---
More recoil, more spread and worse dmg drop off.
---
wth I thought this was only a meme
---
Whole screenshot here: http://imgur.com/gallery/2WhhtB0
---
there is just a must need for getting rid of projectiles. The ADS, even though wall mounted and noisey will still take a lot of utility to burn out.  This new magnetic version will be good for defensive roamers that want to protect themselves from projectiles.
---
I'm just going to be blunt, I'm awful at ranked at unranked. I have no team for it and I always get yelled at for playing badly, so I only save it for the times I feel like I'm actually doing good.
---
The probability is big that they will add it, but I also think it will be removed in a patch like two weeks later or so.
---
He looks busty ngl
---
Never know, wamai has aug w no acog, but hopefully he keeps it
---
Tf2 spy intensifies
---
im not saying vigils bosg acog is an issue, sooo umm did you not ready my comment?
---
fr
---
That's what I'm saying the scorpion needs a buff
---
Suggestions and criticism are welcome!
---
Does he get his barbed wire back too?
---
It's much harder to hit someone with it than you think.
---
The problem isn’t pick and ban, it’s the players using it. If they don’t know how to use it then it’s their loss, but the system is fine how it is. The point isn’t to try to guess the other team’s mains and cripple them: it’s to look at the map and try to remove critical operators for the important strats. For example, my team instabans Mira if the map is Bank and we are on attack. She’s a huge pain on a few of the sites there, so being able to remove her means the enemy is denied a key operator that would give them the best advantage. 
---
Another example is banning Bandit on Clubhouse. Without Bandit you don’t have to worry about Bandit tricking, and objectives like Garage or CCTV are then much easier to push into. 
---
Your proposed system wouldn’t work for a few reasons: first and foremost it takes way too much variety out of the gameplay. If you’re complaining about people banning the same ops then why give people the choice of *more ops?* I can guarantee the same thing will happen: you’re going to be seeing the same ops chosen over and over. It won’t be any different because people know which ops are important and they will always be chosen primarily. Second, it takes too much variety out of the game. The point of adding more operators each season is the idea that the meta will adapt and players will have to conform their play styles to fit the updating roster. The high number of operators and lack of intel sometimes is part of the realism of the game. It’s a tactical shooter, not some game like Smash. The idea that there are only 10 operators on each side to use effectively means you have very limited options and way too much intel right off the bat. It just doesn’t fit the formula they’re trying to make, hence the reason only 4 operators get banned. Last of all, your systems massively disadvantages newer players who don’t have a lot of ops. By limiting it to 10 ops per side, there is a large chance that people who just started the game and want to play ranked will be stuck with Recruit because the only ops they have unlocked are taken by their teammates and so they default to Recruit. Everyone deserves a chance to play on even ground and the current system makes that scenario much less likely.
---
How is it the best AR in the game?  The F2,  R4C, ak 12,C7e are all better, it's basically a worse version of the m4 
---
And generally speaking attackers have better guns than defenders so it wouldn't be too surprising to see this gun on attack
---
Yes but his impact are gone
---
Just turn off that map simple fix to not play it
---
After moving to pc I can now tell even more why console players are a meme
---
Its recoil is actually randomized like the SMG-12. You cannot predict it at all, since the game doesn't even know whats gonna happen with it. Also, buffing the EVO doesn't solve the problem, it just creates more. Now we aren't allowed to have non SMGs that are viable? She had 2 viable guns, then they nerfed the EVO even harder than it needed to be, Then the FO-12 saw use, so they nerfed that. Buffing the EVO just means that eventually it'll be nerfed when it sees play. This sets a bad example for the future, since now we know that if a gun is good on console or a strat is too good or a gadget is too good that it changes PC gameplay too. Now I have to get a console to know whats going to change on PC?
---
She definitely does! I've not seen *anyone* complaining about these shotguns at all, so what's with the sudden nerf and them saying there's such a high ban rate...when that's not the case?
---
Wakanda dude
---
Awesome, was hoping he would. Thanks for the quick reply!

BTW tactical does not equal realism they have VERY different definitions. the more you know.

True!

Mia Khalifa

---
There's unranked for a reason? They should keep casual and add the quickmatch with the new roles. The whole point of casual is to have fun/not being a sweat. We dont need ubi to hold our fucking hand in two different modes just for ranked.

Not anymore.

Was this done on the test server? Because I’ve noticed that almost every time on the new quick match mode that whoever attacks first almost always ends up winning the first two rounds and ultimately the game.
---
As a Warden main. These are the exact words I would use to explain his capabilities
---
Oh yeah, unranked is worse than casual, every unranked game I've ever played has been a team killing fest and then me and my buddy up against 5 people.
---
Of what?
---
actually his bio suggests he is or part alien (cringe for ubi)
---
In PC I see people always upswing her shotgun and that shit it tarded so I’m happy they nerfed it
---
(bo4 ^flash back
---
Can't she help Hibana as well? Because technically Hibana needs it too.
---
The Australian operators and their accompanying videos showcasing their relationship really started this season out strong.
---
Yes because if we learned anything from pre-rework lion it's that playing against wall hacks is totally fun and fair.
---
I mean okay, attack me I see how it is
---
Tachanka op
---
I think your understanding of the game might be minimal judging by your comment, so I won’t hold it against you. The fact that a 3 speed (vigil) now has an acog, is totally game changing, and is a well-needed buff for an otherwise memed weapon.
---
Wasn't it Clash?
---
Ela
---
It's usually a decent experience for me, that was just BS
---
Yup
---
No isn't but ethnic diversity should not be the selling point. The selling point should be the best characters made and designed well. Their skin or ethnicity should come 2nd
---
Oh this great character that i really like and relate to just happens to be half Japanese half Croatian.

Not

Oh awesome there's a Russian/African girl in this game... i like that she's great with guns and has a relatable personality.

Damn that number hurts my soul

It’s really nice to come onto the Internet after getting pissed off at your kind struggling for something that was once easy before your kind plagued this platform.

If I could afford literally anything at all I would love to work ubisofts own gloryhole to get an adapter set for my Xbox. But unfortunately the only money I’ve held is $50 and that was years before I started getting neglected.

Ela getting nerfs yet the F2 gets joke nerfs that  gun is still shredding everyone.
---
I play on ps4 and it's a constant for the gold-low plat players. If it's not banned some one is always using it. Disclaimer, I haven't played since mid September so things may have changed.
---
true, but they may just prefer it on console, all their friends may be on that platform

---
Well maybe ubi should get their shit together lol
---
Yes they are very different but my point is that defense is not inherently going to have an advantage because they’re defending.  
---
It mostly comes down to map design currently favouring defenders over attackers.  Almost every rework has been focused on making it easier for defenders.  Maps that favour attackers get removed from the map pool mighty quick.

What is your graphics card and what type or memory does your mobo take?

They said that they'd never again make the mistake of giving an acog to a 2/3 speed.

Thankyou for the criticism! I actually didn't change her nose or anything, I just defined the jawline with what I could see in the picture, and made her eyebrows smaller, so her face shape isn't different at all, its mainly just the hair.

Umm this is a test server change. Not guaranteed to come one. And two you're not right in any regard. The Fo-12 does the lowest damage of all primary shotguns asides the AA-12 a fully automatic shotgun. Has one of the lowest ranges for damage of all shotguns. Has a medium sized spread and does disperse at ranges past 10 meters. And high recoil. But is balanced and is the most balanced shotgun as it has the fastest fire rate of all shotguns. It's balanced, you're the one who's wrong. Be open to others opinions and actually look at stats before you try to make claims that are false.
---
Because you don’t own all of them.
---
Yeah, in the patch notes it was officially revealed
---
Oh, I read what someone posted and it didn’t say but IM HAPPY NOW, DOKKAEBI I AM COMING BACK
---
It isn't
---
In terms of balance, I agree.  
---
In terms of being a sniper, I do not.
---
You think the BOSG is viable for spawnpeeking?
---
If you want a good kd play passive and bait teammates
---
Lol
---
I dont get the hate for that gun, it's one of the few games where shotguns dont shoot confetti past 5 feet.
---
Oh shit, well thanks for correcting me. (Not sarcasm)

Super Shorty Acog here we come

You Ela mains are so salty over a video game gun lmao

CSGO also has had over a decade to fine tune things to balance them out. And there's still maps that are C sided and some that are CT sided. But the big thing is that the maps are static. Nothing changes based on how people play them. I have 1800 hours in Siege and I still learn new ways to play maps from the beginning of the game all the time.
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking of doing but my friends keep pressuring me to play with them so I can hit plat. Taking a break seems like the way to go.
---
And you make false claims based of your own beliefs without actually looking at stats. As well as being a prick and commenting negatively on post without reading them. You've this twice now, you're not getting any better.
---
Especially slug shotguns. Slug shotguns have very close drop off damage, meaning that they start doing less damage from closer ranges than most guns. So while the BOSG can 1 hit kill or down most operators with a body shot from close range, it takes 2 or more body shots or a headshot to get a kill from typical spawnpeeking range.
---
725 slug let's go!
---
Just walk away from ranked for a bit. Play some unranked and just have fun. People too often forget to have fun with this game.
---
I mean.. it's definitely not tanyA. Personally I'd write it tanyuh, but even that feels wrong when I say it. Tanye is closer than Tanya my opinion, as long as you ignore the fact that Kanye exists. Little harsh to blame French when every language in the area is inconsistent as hell (especially English... Coming from a native of both French and English.).
---
No they will not, they’re I’ll most likely have a season for themselves
---
Just let people build their guns how they want.
---
The modding system of R6 needs a serious rework.
---
Her right cheek is where my eye kept getting stuck, so editing the jaw area makes sense. The only changes I consciously noticed were shallowing her brow while reshaping her eyebrows, and shallowing her mandible.
---
But why is it prompting me to unlock the season one ops for 2160 credits, when the only one I don’t have unlocked costs 216 lol where would the rest of those 1944 credits go? 
---
It’s just sketchy, when you buy and op it should reduce the amount of credits you need to get the package in my opinion.
---
No no no. when i say idiot children i mean children who are being idiots. not that all children are toxic idiots. I have 4 kids and I would beat some ass if I ever caught then doing that. but they are totally respectful. and also not allowed to play siege lol
---
Lol what rank are you?
---
I haven't noticed any change to overall performance with each season, And the amount of content in the game really has little effect as only a limited amount of that content is actually loaded in during a match.
---
They did
---
Plat 2 on my main I got 3 accs
---
Kali's claw has a radius of 3m on either side of the wall, so that would still be tough.
---
Balance wise pistols are 1 bullet per click wise shotguns are a lot easier to aim with due to the pellet spread.
---
I’m not saying pc is cheaper than buying both a console and a pc obviously, I’m saying it’s cheaper than buying a console
---
Nice. I reached Plat 3 for the last 2 seasons but I’m stuck at Gold 1 so far, at one win from Plat.
---
Aa12 with the new x12
---
You know. I read it, and now i actually agree.
---
Are you sure no one got into your account and played with it ?
---
Are we talking about video game balance or real life shooting performance, because you don’t actually want to balance your game based on real life.
---
Thats not really an argument
---
Because fuck you, that's why.
---
This is always me too, btw.
---
Yeah on my solo que acc I was one game off plat then I dropped to silver 1 😭 good luck
---
Well if you mean anyone I know, I haven't given the details to anyone and no one has accessed my PC. 
---
Not sure about anyone getting into my account but I have 2FA so I highly doubt it.
---
AA12 ACOG
---
New Electroclaw radius is 1.3m. EMP radius is 5m. We can assume a reinforced wall is 3m tall from the picture. Suppose the Electroclaw was placed at the max distance it can be from the wall to electrify 1 reinforcement, and Thatcher did the normal thing of throwing the EMP at the base of the reinforcement. That's still a 3.27m distance from the EMP to the Electroclaw, well within the EMP range of 5m. Realistically, the Electroclaw will be closer to the wall to electrify more walls, reducing the distance from a standard EMP toss. Even if Thatcher somehow botched the EMP throw, he would still have 2m of leeway to get the Electroclaw. Unless the Thatcher is extremely bad, then almost always, the Electroclaw will be within range of the EMP and be destroyed.
---
Why were the seasonal skins changed?    
---
Here are those showcased first:

---
I really looked forward to the left one. Those currently showcased on the official page right now looks like those common skins that the game came out with in 2015. I hope those 2 on the image won't be behind paywalls because they cooler and thus making players pump in the game more money. Don't follow Bethesda's way of handling Fallout 76. Please don't let us down Ubi :(
---
#SMG-12 ACOG
---
Is this a BOSG with an ACOG, or a human person?
---
We'll never know.
---
I partly agree I think her smg needs a buff to be useable but her shotgun is stupidly broken
---
Sarcasm?
---
I saw that too
---
Kapkan the Trapkan
---
That just was an execution
---
I doubt that it has to do with public pick rates, I would probably correlate more to how the game is made and how the operators play now.  Strats, map knowledge and numerous other things will make a difference.
---
Indeed
---
Check Ubisoft club for login ip’s and time and then you can try to get Ubisoft support on your side
---
Beautiful
---
In cod its more a question of balance, irl shotguns are effective at 40 yards, but that doesn't mean that in a military shooter the over under shotgun should be hands down the most effective weapon at &lt;40 yard range. You play siege surely you understand how shotguns should behave in game vs irl for the sake of balance.
---
Me and the boys
---
no rank is bad rank.
---
all it took was a fucking star
---
Alright, I’ll have a look at that. Thanks.
---
The real issue is their consistency, not their overall strength
---
i call bullshit, everyone knows you can't headshot ash
---
Me when I see a spider on the ground, so i bring in the squad to help me
---
yeah if the emp is on the left far side of the wall and the claws on the right far side just touching it, it might get off the 5.2m range of the emp.
---
But the chances of that happening on a normal game is pretty rare.
---
Probably the only (somewhat) original Tachanka meme I've seen in a long time
---
Die
---
This is amazing
---
It's just because all the sweaty diamonds will now get easy headshots with it because of its acog now
---
at a later date
---
And no I’m asked you noon
---
You would get credits for every op you already own
---
Could also be good to get the option to leave a casual game if a spot opens up for a ranked or unranked match
---
You can Kaid trick and in my experience it’s almost just as effective as bandit tricking
---
Actually, when Microwave Gaming tested it, it guaranteed a down on the torso through 3 walls but only some 15 damage on the limbs.
---
DUDE IMAGINE IF YOU HAD A SHOTGUN HOLY SHIT
---
That would be a sick ass replay
---
HOLY SHIT THATS HUGE
---
Shotgun hitreg. Yes, tcgs is victim to it as well. A lot less than buckshots, but it is a thing.
---
#acog on an acog
---
I’d rework Hereford base back first
---
But surely at close range a shotgun pellet should penetrate your arms and legs at least
---
Ya well it was kinda a screw up on ubis part.
---
Nope I actually realized how necessary it is for her to have them. Two maestro cams, echo drones, valk, Kaid, bandit, wamai, and so much more.
---
Keep in touch with me, I’ll help ya
---
Holy hell. So ela is going to be unplayable :( not even her pistol is good
---
I was in this situation before and I got enough evidence to prove it wasn’t me
---
Make the operator icons less transparent, then it’s perfect

Mozzie is the type of guy that I could hang out with for hours just drinking and talking about hacking drones

Bruh that be like me and the boys going to kill the hostage

Cursed
---
I died when you cut to the kid shooting LMAO
---
They're gonna gut the shit out of her and then struggle to balance her back into a viable operator, just like they've done with Glaz. It's almost like they don't actually think about balancing anymore, they just destroy anything remotely good about an operator and then do 500 tweaks in the wrong direction that nobody asked for to bring them back from 'trash tier' to 'mediocre at best'
---
I understand your point. and I do agree. however it isn't a mil sim, nor does it claim to be an ultra realistic shooter based on real life swat situations. because it doesn't claim to be any of the above and because it's a game I can allow a reload cancel even on a belt fed gun simply because the animation hasn't completed yet. if is isn't complete the game doesn't consider it a reload so a cancel is available for the player to perform.
---
How?
---
Have you seen the 900 meter shot with it?
---
Modern warfare players boohoo need the 725 it is a sniper
---
the siege devs: hey guys lets add an ACOG on the BOSG 
---
I don’t see anyone here complaining about it being a sniper shotgun lmao
---
Approved
---
Your gaming chair just isn't good enough.
---
did the activation time get extended with the extra range or has it just been sped up to be the same?
---
Sure, fly Plane into it. Two birds one stone.
---
Looked like Wamai's effect but you're not even on the TTS 😆
---
True, but in the end of the day next round you’re defending.
---
Don't play on the newcomer playlist. You'll have much more luck on casual, newcomers just full of smurfs.
---
When I click a side button to set it as crouch it doesn’t do anything, I have to go into the mouse software and bind it to C which means I can’t use my C button on my keyboard as it acts as crouch (mouse is a model o-)
---
M870 AGOG UBI PLZ FIX
---
Learn anatomy before doing something like this.
---
That doesn’t work:( it doesn’t do anything
---
I’m scared of playing against vigils now
---
You mean how shotguns should shread no armors but do diddly squat against 3 armors?
---
That would be both realistic and balanced but instead they have a radius of death and a radius of tickle.
---
This is why I hate ALWAYS being on team blue.
---
Brah I have play the game almost 1k hour still get lost on the other side of tower hahaha
---
Can't go wrong with Lesion.
---
It doesn’t seem to recognize that there is a button there I have to go into the mouse software and bind it to C
---
Commie little faggot crybaby
---
I fucking love tower
---
Any double take revolver. Pp-bison. Double barrel shotgun sawed off. The assault rifle that bends around walls( clearly less accurate and only semi auto when peeking around corner). A deagle where it shoots one shot that is a shotgun shell(yes it exists).lever action rifle that works like a double take revolver but longer reload and more accurate less fire rate. With these odd but interesting guns the game would get some interesting strats
---
Bring mozzie down and put buck S tier because he can vertical play from down and up.
---
I'm guessing it's hard coded to down you and the damage is more intended for limb damage and frost mats, since frost mats have hp.
---
“Ah shit the op was wearing clothes and it all bounced off”
---
maybe they didn't know before then. Maybe they didn't buy it and got it as a gift. Maybe they prefer console games, and decided to get rainbow seperately.
---
I don't know why they didn't just give him back the third claw. That would allow for more flexibility. But meh, the buff is good either way.
---
See is fine.
---
No probs. Glhf.
---
Seems interesting honestly
---
I tried pressing the side buttons but it didn’t do anything I had to go into the mouse software and bind it to C
---
I mean tower is ok but like I could definitely live without it .
---
Amaru is significantly more useful than GoPro, especially in high level play where spastics think destroying hatches is a good idea.
---
Yes, I'm aware that these aren't good but I think they're at least not TOO bad
---
Man kapkan and tachankas smg has to be top 3 easiest guns to use in the game, not saying that it’s cheap but using it man it does not have any recoil, I’m suprised it hasn’t gotten a recoil nerf
---
Yeah I agree. Unless you’re toxic for it
---
Thanks
---
So the FO-12 the shotgun with already one of the lowest damage ranges and the lowest damage for any primary shotgun asides the aa12 is getting nerfed for being out of line in those areas? Ubisoft you're fucking joking right?
---
That gasp tho
---
No approximation? And they’re using it for 420 seconds not once every 420 seconds
---
Yeah and what is he... A dead pick.
---
?
---
Us
---
Ima remember this spot
---
More like pop goes the weasel trick
---
About time
---
This got posted too many times already
---
Maverick Elite absolutely has to be his time in Afghanistan.  Hoodie, a more serious look, but more innocent, almost.
---
Wait they fucked the sausage too?! Thats my favorite primary for Kapkan :(
---
Those are all put of ranked rotation
---
Oh... That sucks... Another reason to quit those provinces and reduce oily sand production
---
Disgusting
---
I think you're talking about kitchen. The second floor site you're talking about is aviator/bar I think. The library you are thinking of is Study, the room with a balcony on the outside.
---
Villa is actually a very defender favored map, possibly one of the most defender favored in the game right now. I actually love villa myself. It also makes for a really interesting map to watch the pros play too.
---
Wait a minute. I just realized that all the attackers have been women and defenders men. This is the only Year they've done that.
---
I was not aware of that when i posted it and just thought it was interesting
---
Lesion 2.0... i like this though

Hello Eeret, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/dw4hyp/when_4v5_issue_in_ranked_is_going_to_be_adressed/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

The argument might be weak, but at least he committed to the Mozzie main title

uh...You ok ?

It wasn't an easy fight

Wait is it actually in the game now?
---
Woah
---
I just know it from The Matrix
---
Kapan ?
---
He's half crocodile!!! We need this fixed!
---
is there middle-eastern servers yet
---
Do Ela but her gun barrel droops from the nerfs.
---
Dpi went from 400 to 10k xD
---
No, we all did, 2 days ago. You're a little late to the party.
---
Given that all the ops from every season this year have some sort of 
---
close relationship with the ones released with them, I wonder how well Warden and Nokk know each other
---
We got an Aussie, trash, a Peruvian, and a Kenyan very very diverse crew
---
Hello qPolug,
---
Ubisoft really f*cking  hates ela.
---
Don't forget bandit, kaid, clash, IQ, thermite, twitch, and others. I balanced it by affecting teammates the ways real emps work.
---
due to screw ups?  like dammit why did i run?
---
You’ll end up saying”why wasn’t that a headshot”

---
Holy shit, yes, extended barrel shotguns. They'll see you coming from a mile away, but you'll shoot them from over there
---
Defenders are always going to have an advantage because defending is easier overall some maps are attacker biased tho like Bank and clubhouse
---
There he is!
---
Keep in mind that the base operators that are still a big part of the meta is around 1000-2000 renown. (you get around 200-300 per casual match). 
---
Also you can wait for a sale and get the complete edition for like 40 bucks and upgrade your base to that.
---
Favela, Plane, Fortress and House.
---
Kanal, Clubhouse and Hereford reworked explicitly to make defense more viable too.
---
I mainly like it for it’s aesthetic, and to be able to look over the railing on the night version and have my breath taken away
---
ok 
---
i dont know much about that though
---
Some people aren't so friendly to newcomers and it can take a while to aquire other operators (Vanilla ones are still really good to use). This game requires a bit of strategy, and teamplay (Most, but not always) so if you end up dying a lot or so don't let that discourage you. It's rough learning a new game but be patient and calm. Take the time to practice the game from the base mechanics, then to the more advanced mechanics. There are people that can help such as in this subreddit, or on Youtube. Best one I'd recommend to watch to learn more about the game from some of the content creators like Macie Jay, Coconut Brah, Varsity Gaming, and Get_Flanked.
---
I thought i was alone...
---
I love Tower from a visual point, it's awful gameplay wise and I think it'd be a great contender for a full rework
---
Yikers Scoobs Lmao
---
Are you hitting apply?
---
ah
---
I need to get myself an elite controller
---
&gt; I balanced it by affecting teammates the ways real emps work.
---
Which doesnt nothing if your predrone your attack. IQ and twitch doesnt need to do anything with the scanner and drone if a emp is going off. Thermite should already gotten the needed walls open by the time of the plant(with the help of IQ and twitch). 
---
This new "buff" counters like 70% of the game with one button click. 
---
There are no real disadvantages for this for the attackers.
---
\&gt;  you can technically get the defuser down as a single man 
---
So technically you can't secure room or rescue hostage as a single man?
---
yeah, but i kind of dont spread myself out too thin in terms of “characters” i usually stick with 1-3 master their strengths and weaknesses
---
Looks like ps4 gameplay
---
Attacking requires more coordination and callouts than defending does (my opinion)
---
I’ve seen Ela banned ONCE.  The FO-12 isn’t even GOOD.
---
Sadly no
---
If your on console, signing in with another PSN account on your console that has the skin would give your account the skin as well. This also works for pro league sets.
---
Why is this cropped so badlt and why is it so old
---
What happens if a person is laying down on their back and the opposing person shoots for the head but the feet are in the way. Would it penetrate the foot for a headshot kill?
---
Can already imagine marley on this bad boi
---
https://discord.gg/umTedJ
---
im worried that the grind is not so bad, but im not a die hard sit here play hours type. at most 30min to 1hour and not everyday
---
Yeah. In the settimgs it says that it's set to h but ingame it's b.
---
It would disable thermites ability to detonate, so this is actually a nerf. He would never be able to open any electrified walls so I retract everything, this rework sucks.
---
That looks so goofy
---
I saw somebody selling code is it real is code for this skin real?
---
That’s weird.
---
Totally not possible on PC. Unless I don’t know someone, who actually sells that.

#BUFFELA2020
---
Me and my friends all hate Ela shotgun on console. You need to just look near the enemy and have a good trigger finger. It has so much bullshit range and power that a copper 2 could’ve dunked on a plat 2 from 20 meters away. I would be fine with a small recoil buff to the Scorpion though
---
I mean if you have good enough map knowledge, you can usually just avoid long-range fights altogether with a 3 speed roamer. That's what I usually do. 
---
Do you tend to burstfire or spray at longer ranges?
---
Shotgun range, recoil, kick and spread nerf.
---
**ALL AT ONCE**
---
Welcome to ranked. Where throwers throw and smurfs smurf.
---
Doc, Rook, Echo, Maestro, Kaid... we allready had 5 ops with ACOGS per defense.. the Bosg is a meme, an acog will not make it viable, you miss your shot, you will get blasted by anyone witha full auto weapon... plain and simple
---
You mean zoomed meme Cannon?
---
Right....
---
Honestly wish you could report these clowns for griefing because that's what they're basically doing.
---
or just bring back old hereford
---
I hear old Joseph Joestar yelling that in my head.
---
Yeah because it isn’t. Ubisoft has even confirmed it isn’t dipshit
---
There's literally a post in this sub that's 8 minutes older than yours with this photo...
---
Mozzie, the drone snatcher!
---
There is a reason theR4-C lost its acog too.
---
Love tower, glad it's off the ranked playlist, but one of the only reasons I still play casual at all.
---
Unneeded considering it’s in the game
---
Will we see it going live or is it just going to stay in test server, who knows
---
Hmm.. i wonder which one the community will prefer 🤔
---
Wait a minute they removed recruit from ranked lmao???
---
FYI: Students of Chinese University of HK had a battle with riot police on Monday and Tuesday. The police had shot 1567 tear gas, 1312 rubber bullets, 380 beanbag bullets and 126 sponge grenade.
---
yeah tower isn't as bad as people make it out to be IMO. favela and chalet are the worrrrst
---
Spray. I can keep it on her body well enough and usually get a headshot with the recoil kicking everywhere however intake those engagements close to walls so I can nope back into cover if they dont die fast enough.
---
Wait.  Am i assuming correctly that it’s a buff for shield ops, now that they will receive less damage if shot in the hand?
---
Yeah I was thinking that. It’s a sad time.
---
1 tab headshot spawnpeaks incoming
---
Hatch C4 with Pulse is I think even safer.
---
you mean he got banned fairly? Unlike he person in the post
---
0% chance to be spawn peeked :P
---
So they can carry him, yes
---
Just saying that and the fmg have the exact same stats
---
It has the damage damage profile and RPM like an unsilenced FMG9, how would it be OP?
---
Facts
---
r/badwomensanatomy
---
I want Ubi to end tower. It's like Bartlett. We also need a rework of the Hereford rework. Maybe in Y5 they can add a new map to replace tower
---
Yeah
---
Damn that person pressed the op so fast it almost broke the keyboard
---
That's what she said
---
Lucky bastard. Jm a buck main and have 4 black ices left to get before I get them all and 3 of them are for all of Buck's guns
---
Thatcher just needs a smg 11
---
players who main recruit make new accounts just to play recruit in ranked since you get him if you have no ops purchased
---
kaid can sorta trick, by throwing his shit at a wall over and over and cycling between two
---
eg, throw A, wait ~2 sec, throw B, pick up A and throw it again...
---
The V2 is suppose to be much better at the quality of those things. Or so I’ve seen said in reviews on YouTube.
---
It’s fun casual map.
---
I mean it has an acog the fmg doesn't have
---
pls no more rng12

if he's gonna just donate kills to sledge why doesn't he just down you with the shield melee?
---
You don't like getting c4 on? What about that run out on moto? Spawn peek up top when you climb the ladder? 
---
I hate favelas
---
the reason Ubisoft buff kaid is probably because of the new attacker Kali ability. Unless there jeager or wamai (new defender) her gadget has a very high chance to destroy defender gadget. This way kali can't destroy all Kaid electro claw with a single shot of her gadget.
---
Kali ability : combine thatcher and ash ability. Small explosion that can destroy gadget, even that are located behind reinforced wall.
---
I would send it to you if I could my guy
---
It's actually not as bad as people think. I play on Xbox One and can control it fine, same with Ela's scorpion.
---
They buffed hin though
---
This\^
---
I thought it just got triggered immediately, can you retest?
---
I really want a jungly map. We have desert, snow and urban. Now we just need something a bit... greeny.
---
Poor Hong Kong man, went there for a holiday during easter and now its a shit show and the government have zero clue on how to de escalate the problem all they did was making things worst everyday.
---
Ok boomer
---
Well, that's why the TTS exists.
---
the worst part is the person who got the new op also votekicked you... oof
---
Very poor choice of words
---
Why nerf amaru?
---
Maybe chalet? The hatch above garage but you’d only get 2 walls a hatch barbed wire on top as well as a shield but not 3 walls
---
There's challenges that release every week that can gain you 1K renown, actually more as well as dailies and event challenges that unlock charms/weapon skins. This is through Ubisoft Club.
---
As for grinding, I highly suggest you get the complete edition, you'll get 600 R6 credits, as well as all year 1, 2, and 3 operators and other stuff as well.
---
RIP BANDIT
---
Wow, you want a feedback? Your post is so useless trash, you just came up with 2 names and weapon loadouts? What kind of creativity is that? Writing that Ubisoft will create the lore and gadgets? For what purpose your post is here? You just skipped the 2 main things of operators, lore and gadget, this is not a creativity and ideas, everyone can create a thousand of nicknames in a short time, but not everyone can create an interesting character with a story.
---
Just waiting for the nutty Brah tricks with the increased ranged
---
Was thinking the same. I’ve seen her banned quite a bit in unranked too
---
some of the gadgets should be immune to taking damage from reinforcement... if not all
---
I don't know, just couldn't thought of any other changes lol
---
He's solid, saying he's extremely strong is an exaggeration. No one's sweating over Castle.
---
I wasnt talking about drugs i was talking about gambling addiction
---
That's a bad change. Illogical as well.
---
As is the mpx with acog because 2 speed with full auto acog is a no.
---
The first one is ok
---
That’s not what makes me think I’m good.
---
Legit have thought of the exact same operator before would love to have this in the game.
---
Lack of Black Ice.
---
This why there is a test server report it on the site please :)
---
I can't lie I've started to enjoy it on casual
---
Old Hereford was three corridors and a basement. Never again.
---
how?!?!?!?! unless...   his sensitivity is OVER 9000!?!?!?!?!!?!??!
---
I think you'll find that it's more of an Ash/Buck/Zofia/Sledge type deal. There are pros and cons, so they are alternatives rather than replacements.
---
I think he's the only year 4 op to get serious pro play consistently besides maybe gridlock
---
Damn, insecure much?
---
If you don't have anything positive to say I think you should shut your God damn mouth. I'm looking for POSITIVE feedback, not troll feedback.
---
Or the mp5k
---
2nd december
---
What does “full bars” mean? I haven’t played in a while.
---
around 3 weeks
---
It’s not that bad.
---
NGL doing a Charlie's angel style enter through the windows is ace!!
---
So nice! I am happy for you, now you can finally enjoy the game. I am having a 9 ping for a long time, can't imagine playing with 190
---
Idk man its nearly 2 years since it was released and I still struggle to know where I am on that map, fortress is shit but I understand the layout way better
---
Fuck yes
---
Not small at all, he was the ultimate breach denial boi, with his claws, being able to kaid trick and his impacts, being able to impact trick in order to destroy exothermic charges and xkairos
---
My favorite one was the white stairs on Oregon to dorms, put some barbed on the stairs and throw an electroclaw under the bed and you got a good time/health waster
---
ahahahaha
---
This low key sick
---
Instead, why don’t we give more ops Smokes? 
---
Give Amaru and Nokk smokes do there are more on the board
---
I personally want them to add ALL versions of ALL maps to casual again, and reintroduce us with matchmaking preference on casual. Or add map voting.
---
I'm not a fan of removing maps from casual..
---
Casual is only a playground, and if you want to train, you should do unranked..
---
I just think its bullshit, that they remove features from casual
---
Your suggestions make it SF not FF, sure, people to in games, but it's like a minority of games
---
The current FF system doesn't punish you so hard for accidentally hitting or killing ta eammate, and the FF is turned on at the discretion of the player who has been killed.  Which is good, it means that if you think they did it deliberately you can turn FF on
---
I want ACOG on everything. Even that .410 pistol.
---
Tacticool.
---
They’re all idiots lmao
---
But *technically* it's possible
---
The unholy creation
---
I mean if you headshot sombody its an instant kill anyway. But i didnt know it was skit im kinda new to r6 havent used all of the opps
---
Kapkhans looking a bit malnourished.
---
m870 with a x12 scope
---
Its one of my favourite maps :(
---
This isn’t a bad photoshop
---
Someone explain?
---
Explain what
---
If they're gonna do that for kali the better do that to all ops or at least glaz too
---
The tower was the best map for ranked games. Most spots require communication between the whole team. Any entrances on this map are fucked up. So you need to create a new one. And the circle-like interior requires to cover your hard breacher from roamers. I want the Tower back to the ranked pool
---
I totally agree.
---
Ela's scorpion need a shorter distance than her FO-12 to be effective while Alibi can spawnpeek with ease.
---
Well elevator is kind of spawn peek the drop above 2F shaft is kind of spawn peek.
---
sharkoon skiller sgh2 i personal reccomend them. Cheap and pretty good i use them for over any year now and they are i great condition
---
&gt;You should also track how often you lose in a post plant situation on attack. You'll be surprised to see that attackers win those more often than not.
---
If you get a plant down you are already winning, so while the holding angles gives an advantage, it really isnt a surprise.
---
Put in an extra 50 bucks and get a hyperx one. Thats gonna last for years.
---
cz reflex scope pls
---
Yeah, at least you could get battlepacks with attachments for a specific gun by getting kills with that gun, however alpha packs are much rarer and it could happen that you literally never get the attachment you want
---
I’m on console, explain how ‘cannon be banned’ works , I didn’t see it in the patch notes
---
tfw it's one of my favorite maps
---
It's in the TTS...
---
Fuck hereford and fuck everyone who wants it in ranked. Id rather play tower 24/7 then play ranked and get hereford every 3rd match i play..
---
I guess Im in a minority. I think this map is fun as hell.
---
It might just mean the new ops can’t be banned so that people actually get a chance to use them
---
Imagine rotating out House , Oregon, and Plane, and keeping this. Imagine.
---
It doesn't have viable entrances other than those drops near elevator shafts because if defenders know how to play they can easily kill you while rappelling and we all know elevator thing.
---
Now that it can actually be used;
---
Is BOSG ACOG actually any good?
---
You can try muzzlehider and shoot many small bursts with good accuracy
---
I actually refined the idea saying that you should be able to buy them in the in game store with renown or R6 Credits instead of hiding them behind alpha packs.
---

---
Thanks!
---
I don like outback. I feel like it should be removed from rank play
---
New weapons feel fresh and unique to the operators they are tied in, that's why I like them. It just feels more lazy if we get 2 new operatirs with recycled weapons and one slightly reworked map and still pay $30 yearly for them (or grind them).
---
Wel could literally just get M4 variants like Honey Badger and it would feel unique enough when tied to operator. Just like MP5SD that is just silenced MP5. It still feels different and unique to Echo.
---
She really is op with shotgun on ps4. My team have to ban her every match abd dometimes we need to ban other ops but is too risky to leave ela for enemies
---
Cyka blyat
---
Oh ok lol.. yeah she has the FMG9 submachine gun, the Six12 shotgun suppressed, the 5.7 USG handgun and the D50 handgun
---
What is cav elite silent step skin? or does it change the intoragation animation?
---
Literally last month there was ban wave on consoles.
---
I wanted the FO-12 to get nerfed, I still think it should be nerfed further (plz take away that extended barrel) but not getting any compensation sucks. I don’t think people would be as upset with the nerf if Ela got her SMG buffed or something. I don’t play her enough to know what I’d do to her but Ubi nerfing her without compensation is tough.
---
Thx for showing me what a duck is
---
CU in Brazil means ass hole
---
Really?? on what console thou?
---
Are there maps where you wanted to electrify 3 hatches?
---
My guess is she’ll either get the MP7 or MP5SD. The community has been asking for replacement weapons, and the 2 most popular are the MP5SD and MP7.
---
Nothing else to say?
---
Tower is actually my favorite map
---
But afk renown farm tho...
---
what do you mean "dont want"
---
Too big, too many floors, too many angles to check. It ends up being luck baased as to where enemies will be/come from. You cant possibly check every corner.
---
#ChankaTurretAcog
---
I love tower, best map.
---
Cod mw did it, we can too!
---
I don't know bout that perfectly controllable; if Fabian(just listing a pro I've seen use her) isn't able to control Ela's SMG then I don't think perfect is the right word, I think random is a better word for her gun with its horizontal recoil, compared to every other operator vertical
---
Not sure but may be top floor on Favela?
---
How tf do you take this long to start shooting?
---
You had enough time to do serious damage.
---
Here is the problem. Those new maps would end up being terrible and you will hate then given enough time. Reworking maps is better but the lack of new content is making the game becoming stale though.
---
How dare you forget the lord himself.
---

---
She looks like Tokyo from Money Heist 🙄
---
Thanks Dana. I'll do the same and send it to you all.
---
Isn’t recruit not available in ranked? And if he is that means this guy wouldn’t have had ANY other operators and AFK picked. Either way, that shit sucks. It’s fine for casual but not ranked.
---
what about reworking these maps and adding your new ones
---
They're a cool million per my dude

Yes but it had an outdoor staircase 3speeds could rotate down one floor without being detected if both doors aren’t barricaded. Also from 1st to ground and ground floor to basement there’s hatches.
---
Fuze pucks are homing and seek out victims. I swear it.
---
WHAT?? They are?? I’m pissed…
---
Same bro
---
Effects of playing on seas for 2 years in a row.
---
You face enough that you just become tolerant to all the trash and bullsh*t that happens.
---
Disagree wamai is going to be a game changer. I am putting him at 4th worst defender, ahead of castle, chonk, and warden (in that order)
---
Good change imo, he still needs full charge to see through smoke so no problem here.
---
/s
---
Yo they actually removed the movement penalty, and kept it only when seeing through smoke.
---
Can use your controller on your pc
---
Fucking PLEASE UBI
---
Pl finals trailer there's an Easter egg of tachanka walking with his gun, plus the big leak a couple weeks ago mentioned a rework. Hopefully the retarded lord meme dies with the rework
---
Rule34 is my one true lore, and if you believe that Nokk is 100% a woman.
---
I know, but it’s hard to combat against k&amp;m players
---
oh shit a fellow seas player
---
As shotguns generally shoot buckshot which doesnt usually have enough mass to shoot through human flesh while pistol callibers like .45 ACP has enough mass amd speed to shoot through human bones and flesh
---
I don't watch Pewdiepie. If you want to be so pissed off over something as stupid as this then fine, whatever.
---
!!! Awesome
---
Mate it's the PewDiePie cultists that are the same people peddling the lord meme. Calm down.
---
Yes my lord
---
Get clash to hold them in that spot
---
I kind of have Lesion as my main defender. And she just got nerfed :)
---
Yes please remove gameplay elements ubisoft
---
Smoke blitz and the lord
---
Listen man it's been a long 12 hour shift, I fucked up and didn't think before posting my bad, I will go edit it just for you.
---
He would get an acog, even though he's a two speed now and his guns are somewhat decent for any playstyle.
---
Is there a drop off for this slug or do I expect cross map spawn peeks coming soon?
---
Bruh stop liking a joke bruh I dont like popular thing bruh
---
Told ya, bomb is da way
---
Whoever just followed the the rabbit is now painted on the wall. Glaz would be Proud
---
Well, different objectives, more than one hostage to defend, a very long animation to take the hostage ( around 7sec) and they should invent something like a post plant situation for the moment the hostage is taken, i think that could be balanced.
---
isn't that the point
---
Did you really just call Vacant good and Bloc bad
---
It allows him to have better vision when moving without the smoke, which is what his rework completely punished. Still has to be static though smoke but isn’t penalised elsewhere. 
---
He can play so much more aggressively now, having everyone appearing yellow so anyone on a peak or behind cover sticking out is immediately noticeable. 
---
Nearly pre-rework Glaz. Only difference is the effect through smoke
---
That’s exactly the problem. Two unreliable primary weapons, a pistol that’s decent at best, a gadget that is also decent at best, and no impacts. She has no advantage over the other roamers. I’m gonna keep playing Ela because that’s basically my identity, but it’s gonna he rough and it definitely won’t be in ranked. Alibi, Cav, Vigil…they all have advantages over Ela and it’s heartbreaking because she’s my main and even I have to admit she’s becoming a trash-tier operator.
---
Good idea
---
Give recruits access to all weapons not just base game
---
whyre you pissed man
---
She’s supposed to be getting better guns, which is honestly what she needs.
---
Bomb is the worst game mode and whoever decided to make ranked bomb only should be executed together with anybody who ever proposed ruining existing maps
---
The best ship is Warden and the P90 :)
---
That's cool and all but did you hear about the ela nerf?
---
Casual has it's own ranking doesn't it? That'd mean you're at the same level.
---
I like Favela bc its so destructible, but i luke tower because there's so much to explore. The battle can happen anywhere regardles of where the site is, and i like it. Feels really clise quarters ig
---
Wait really? What the fuck ubi
---
It’s definitely not as bad as people
---
make it out to be. 10X better than House or Favela. The rooms are defendable, and approaching objectives as attackers can be unpredictable each time. I understand the complaints about the map, but there are far worse maps to play on.
---
Wow, that’s harsh. Tell a bit more why u think that way?
---
yes because liking cute stuff is gay huh
---
Durger King?
---
I don't understand why people care about recruit.  He's just a place holder until you get enough characters, and all anybody does with him is troll.
---
Dude chill. He’s just saying that the majority of people don’t like the map. You’re acting like he’s insulting you
---
I joined el discord
---
Blitz is gay? Where'd you get that info lol
---
I know what horizontal is I never said pull DOWN I just said pull the answer is still the same
---
this is beautiful no really
---
i almost shed a tear
---
See this is a buff but also a nerf to being able to kaid trick certain walls when bandit is banned.
---
No donkey Kong
---
It's about a 52/48 split.
---
U just suck at attack
---
Just because it's popular doesn't make it funny. You usually see a bunch of people on lord tachanka posts saying how it's a dead meme now and honestly the posts themselves are essentially "I mentioned the funny Russian man now gimmie upvotes".
---
Like Villa and Heraford
---
So get this…they’re nerfing Ela gain. I know, it’s crazy.
---
F
---
Epicness &gt; opness
---
Not If they have 2 defusers like It was sugested above
---
More fitting he is our motherland... Only Nazi Fascists support the fatherland
---
You can get more by hitting the little emoji icon on the right side of the text area while editing your flair, which is how I have 4 icons and 2 names in mine
---
What you said is completely wrong. If anything people who still think “lord tachanka” is funny are the pewdiepie viewers
---
Johnny Sins
---
Lmao dude he’s just baiting you chill
---
My favorite is when you get kicked for not clutching after they all died in spawn, or when there's a four stack and they don't want a teammate
---
The sagia does more damage,  has a tighter spread, and a longer and better damage fall off than the fo-12. You say I have mental deficiency when Ive actually provided stats. Well here's the case pal. All you've done is give me enough evidence of you breaking the subreddit rules abs reddit etiquette. So hope you have fun with admins. You never agreed with anything about the scorpion. All you've done is complain and whine to yourself whilst acting like s jackass. Your entire argument has been wrong ever since you've started talking here. Ive repeated what I've said because it's right and actual stats and data that are provided by ubisoft themselves. That all together have made you wrong from the start. 
---
The fo-12 isn't op as it is one of the lowest damaging shotguns.
---
Has one of the lowest fall off ranges of all shothuns. Especially the semi automatic ones. 
---
Has one of the largest spreads of any shotgun when it's standard but with extended barrel only average between all the guns.
---
As well high recoil.
---
4 negatives that draw this gun down. All balanced by the fire rate. The fire rates compensates for the damage, the recoil for the fire rate.
---
I think a part of the lords buff should be access to acog, if they ever do
---
Maybe with an acog and suppressor
---
Yeah. Quite a few people were disappointed that Wamai's loadout was recycled. Even though all his guns are good.
---
EDD mounted
---
Yes you should have checked
---
Did they really gave it to the bosg?
---
I keep wanting to reply to your comments but will just reply to this one and say you're perfectly in tune with my opinion. Probably that pro-league watching we're doing, I hope Ubi continues to elevate it.
---
They could have if they wanted to enforce a close range playstyle. 
---
There's no way it would be unbalanced. The 9x19 may be a laser, but it has a mediocre firerate and dps for an SMG. It's also on Tachanka, one of the worst operators in the game. Even if he had an amazing gun, he's balanced out by the fact that he's a 1 speed with a shitty gadget.
---
Oof
---
Godly and literally everyone started posting videos with such title within 1 or 2 week of starting of Ember Rise. 
---
Godly even admitted he wasn't in Champion and was just using the word for his titles. And was promising the viewers he will be there soon and hence this won't be a lie anymore.
---
It’s really opinion matter (as well as gameplay but I’ll talk with that later) because personally j really like the new Hereford. Yes I did play on the old one and I liked that one too but for the new one it’s much easier to defend on with now a second staircase to move up and down, as well as the rooms are easier to hold and for the attackers you have plenty of windows to breach from as well as multiple ways to enter a objective. Yes it does have its downfall of it’s harder to call out where they are and if you do get basement it’s easier to lose than if you were upstairs but as well it also comes down to how well your team is coordinated. If I missed something please don’t hate on me this is just all my opinion and a few gameplay things I’ve noticed.
---
Flex does a bit of support and a bit of refragging. They fulfil multiple roles. And can carry utility.
---
I suggest nomad. She's not 100% easy, but she's really good
---
XxNoobMaster69xX
---
You really oofed all over him
---
Get kicked for staying alive till the end.
---
Glaz video is still my favorite
---
Nice
---
It is really good but the vector is also very good for its rate of fire and it does have a decent mag size. Not throwing shade just saying the vector is also a viable choice of weaponry as well.
---
Or like, maybe only for ops you have
---
We all want it
---
I got kicked for telling where am I from.
---
Couldn’t understand why Tachi was saying nom. Now I get it
---
Ye i know ;D Solo-q myself; hit me up if you wanna play a round some time: S235-JR

# #TURRETACOG

Wow. Iirc most of the response to the Ember Rise operators' load-outs was positive, especially after Epi gave an official announcement about the reason for recycled load-outs. He also assured us that we would still get new weapons, just not as frequently. To prove that that promise was being kept, we got a brand new sniper rifle with Kali this season. But I guess it's really hard to make some people happy.
---
custom games lul
---
that's what i'm doing every day in casual
---
You can add an extra bullet if you click reload again I think.
---
6 rounds in one side? What?
---
No cap on attack lineup
---
Jaeger is still more effective and useful though
---
Two shitty memes in one!
---
yes
---
Indeed. That and development versions of the game.
---
Yeah but it’s also more of legal rights that’s why gooby is scared to put more guns in. *and yes I do now about the two new ops*
---
Not only that, but no damage drop off and no recoil when in silent step
---
Pass.
---
Thatcher, doesn't have a .50 cal portable cannon.
---
Yes, the CSRX 300 is bolt-action, limiting her CQC capability, but I still think such a rifle should have never come up on the drawing board at Ubisoft Montreal.
---
Speed was one issue. Now, he only stands still fr 0.5 second. Better than glaz at 2 seconds.
---
C4 make him a mute who can see through smokes.
---
Smg12 is ok. I can burst in 10 shot intervals and control it just fine. People just have to not spray.
---
He's really good now. Making him a 3 beef with a trash ttk gun just  to give him an acog is a big nerf.
---
***Nice Replies Only Thread***
---
**U.N.** ^involved ^in ^peace
---
Report bugs through main menu please I don't want this going into main build.
---
That would be fucking hilarious
---
I have him
---
Time to spam twitter
---
are we allowed to make posts looking for players
---
You are wasting your time fighting this. The problem is not with high plats and diamonds. The problem is with Ubisoft's matchmaking. Opponents in casual should be based on your ranked mmr, so that similar people face similar skill level people.
---
OHH HELL YES
---
Kaid is getting a big buff, and the shotgun getting the ACOG is being shown in the thumbnail.
---
Nothing is incorrect.
---
I feel like a recruit with the M4 would actually make sense, and I don’t see how it would be terribly balanced.
---
Poor best girl can't catch a break. Ubi will come for her handgun next. She'll have to kill enemies with killer thighs and throwing grizmot mines at hem.
---
Thanks and idk that meme
---
Thanks for the silver, kind stranger ;D
---
I know right....smh
---
Only elite skin I'll buy. Do this ubi. For godsake
---
Na no worries
---
Nice one. I provide the info the guys after and I get downvoted by 12 year olds. Cool
---
Article only went on about bosg getting an acog, and nothing about Kaid's shotgun though yes, he is getting a buff
---
Can you destroy the armor crates as a defender?
---
Mute (and smoke aswell) is really good with a shotgun if you can control the smg11. Its a loadout most pros use
---
Grow up
---
Does it still have the L?
---
Can't you read?The pro league finals trailer. And the big leak that came last week.
---
Smurfing is just being a dick. Most people understand that and don’t do it. It’s unfair to expect high ranked players to only play ranked, where they’re expected to do well and get punished for losing. Sometimes they just wanna have fun with a less intense gamemode. It sounds like you just had a bad experience losing against plats, got salty, and are blaming them for being good instead of the matchmaking or yourself.
---
LMG fire rate with an ACOG and with the new sniper rifles’ penetration power and range. No recoil vertical or horizontal and can penetrate even reinforced walls. Has unbreakable shield. That oughta fix Tachanka.
---
How am i supposed to not act an elitist when i receive this kind of message. 
---
I'm not saying i'm good, just pointing out your mediocrity, both in game and in interpreting stats.
---
His point is not dosent need an acog
---
What if someone does not have any ops?
---
Also he seems to be using an extended mag
---
What does Kaids shotgun have to do with anything? 
---
The title states they are testing:
---
1. a big buff to Kaid
---
2. ACOG on a shotgun
---
They have limited characters and can’t explicitly write it out, hence the comma after Kaid.
---
1. You literrally have her as your flair
---
2. Most hours IS main.
---
It'a not my fault that you refuse to do "research".
---
I kinda like it????
---
If you use the magnet to make someone kill the hostage who’s fault is it?
---
what is so satisfying about this it’s not a one tap it’s literally just a pistol kill
---
Yes but then people can use the guns of dlc ops and then there will be no point in buying a dlc op if you can play them for free without any gadgets
---
I presume this update will also bring in Bosnian civilians to massacre?
---
so now a 3 speed acog ?
---
Gridlock was very close to an operator idea I had a couple years ago. My idea was a throwable caltrop similar to Lesion, that could only be destroyed with explosives, or several melee hits like Castle. It's not hard to miss visually, but if you walk over it it does a fairly significant amount of damage similar to Kapkan. It's purpose isn't to cause a lot of damage but to reshape the level, similar to Castle.
---
Gridlock is essentially this same type of character, but she's a 1 speed, her gadget takes quite a while to fully deploy, and is much more easily destroyed (without explosives it only takes 3-5 melee hits).
---
I'd propably take Gridlock due to gadget.
---
Wait till  Finka's rework and then make your opinion.
---
Switch to 400 or 800 dpi and T Hunt until you have blisters.
---
Oh sorry, i thought they were on different days
---
It's been a thing, but people just do it for the clips.
---
Again you're breaking more subreddit rules by being an elitist. And to that I'm interrupting the data exactly how it's provided in its entirety. There's no mediocrity in that. Everything I've said has been backed by actual stats and evidence ubisoft has provided themselves. You can't make it worse or any better. It's the actual hard stats they have. You can't change them in any form. Get actual evidence next time pal.
---
No no no, there is literally something you don't seem to understand here.
---
Her recoil is actually RNG. You CANNOT skillfully control RNG unless you are psychic, because it's random. You cannot control random and given how aggressive her recoil with the randomness you cannot compensate for it.
---
Tell me oh top 1%, if it's just a matter of git Gud, why is it whenever the topic of her recoil comes up the general notion seems to be 'its shit and uncontrollable'? And that comes from players of all ranks, bronze to diamond. 
---
Also gotta say, love how you make assumptions about me as a player pureley based on this one conversation, having the opinion that someone's recoil is shit dosnt make someone bad.
---
And when you zoom in, if doesn't even really look like a mag, more like a freaking harmonica.
---
Smile that had his grenades and his acog removed. [ANGRY MUFFLED MASK NOISES]
---
What rank are you on?
---
You sure thats not kapkan with RTX?
---
How do I actively campaign against this. Fuck the UN.
---
why?  its already overpowered!
---
i'm ready to pay any price
---
go ahead spread the word
---
A resounding; WTF?! HACKS! Was said &amp; someone broke their controller &amp; uninstalled the game after that.
---
Already did lol
---
Brain.ex has stopped working
---
Tis i
---
Because Kaids shotgun isn't getting changed, the article talks about the changes to his electroclaw, and talks about the BOSG acog, and that's exactly what the title says....
---
Not really, it seems to be OP on PC but on console it is not the best (putting it lightly).
---
You play ela 95% of the time and I barely play r6 so if can control her recoil, your bad get good or don't play her like I said. Do something else besides thinking your right when your not
---
*Arabish intensifies
---
Not to bash on lower elos, but they do not know the power of the thicc goddess
---
It broke the first one
---
Where this picture came from ?
---
Is it suppose to break through?
---
I like that idea
---
He had that already and was busted. That’s why they removed it.
---
I simply dont understand that a nerf thats required for console is being implemented on pc, just my two cents
---
I like the idea of native mouse and keyboard support, but I don't like the idea of input separation.
---
Stupid and pointless change.
---
[deleted]
---
But that’s just their guns, not their abilities (which are actually what make an operator special. Besides by that logic you can play “recruit Wamai” by using an aug and a P12 on attack.
---
I got my plat on bank and lost as well what are the odds
---
Anyone that bans cav are stupid, shes easy to counter when you have even a small amount of comms. (Then again idk what its like at the low ranks, could be horrible)
---
There’d be some issues with that though. Imagine a 5 stack of recruits armed with only K1As. Even without modifications it’d be kinda op.
---
actually i don't know i was browsing my gallery and then i found it
---
Why’s that?
---
Why? It's pretty obvious that the ban system was a complete failure. People don't use it strategically they just ban annoying ops. Jackal is getting a nerf, but it won't matter, I'll never get to play him because people don't like his ability.
---
There's obviously something wrong with the system when the same 4 or 5 ops get banned for the last year.
---
Imagine getting stuck in that corner in a 1v1 vw monty
---
actually i tought of that idea
---
hope you get an option to throw paint on those girls in that game
---
Click on an op that is already picked, there’s your recruit
---
There is a charm that cost 1 r6 credit
---
Tower sites in Oregon is one of the worst sites in the game.
---
cool drawing tho

He reported every single post i did. 
---
You want to take a look at his R6 stats ? Barely 1K/D only plays fraggers
---
Yeah but it won’t work for operators where the gadget is attached to the gun like buck, or the new op
---
YES that's the hardest part of playing her is trying to avoid them finding out were you are breaking in!
---
thx bud
---
#BOSGACOG
---
Filthy silver casual here that plays a lot of unranked, I see her get banned pretty frequently because you always have that one idiot that spawns opposite from the team, doesn't drone, and sprints in and gets interrogated knowing there is a cav. Hence I usually vote for her because it happens way too often.
---
That's a good idea
---
His elite animation would probably be a face reveal. Or, the Master Chief meme where Chief takes the helmet off, revealing ANOTHER Chief.
---
fmg-9.
---
he will make peace quicker with his M870 than real UN
---
it's coming out at shifting tides
---
Give him a Zeus skin
---
Says atk in the icon
---
She hates the fact that the new op is better
---
They also have the ARX200, the Spas 12 and I believe Doc’s MP5. All listed as Y5S1
---
this is facts, bitching on a subreddit does nothing, LOWER THE PICK RATE!
---
*Cries in jackal main
---
I think taking it away is a good thing. It forces your team to work together and communicate. That's the whole idea of the game.
---
Jager finna get revenge
---
Ha GAAAAAAAY
---
Ok buddy
---
Dude uniforms like wind bastion, burnt horizon, ember rise are bs in certain maps like Kafe, villa and border since they can blend in certain walls and hall ways.
---
It's more of a exploit than anything since it gives you a advantage lasting a second or 2 to Actually spot them.
---
Noooooo
---
Reverse Card
---
Well yes as a 4q it's hilarious. You'll play them next game or casual/thunt. It's not that big of an deal that you miss out on one ranked game with him lmfao.
---
You have to say no homo first.
---
That's a great buff. Bandit mute Kaid is stronger than ever
---
Ela needs a buff not a nerf
---
I'm surprised you didn't get slapped with a copyright strike for using halo music. Especially *that one*
---
Just delete this character at this point if they hate her that much, 9 nerf cmon bruh
---
Meh, it’s 5 extra seconds for an operator with an easy prep phase, and your suggestion might make it more likely that a rook wouldn’t place his armor because he already has it
---
Hint: If you actually want people to look at your channel, you should just link it.
---
y tho
---
Karma
---
I think this was a good buff to him cause I really never see him getting picked just barely but now I believe that his pick rate will go a bit higher
---
I like tower too, hating it is just the fashionable thing to circlejerk about.
---
What is this from
---
Ah shit
---
These were on the arcade machines in the old version of theme park
---
I’m happy for Vigil... I swear...
---
Blitz... not so much
---
Didnt know how that system would react other then with the sniper that actually looks pretty good
---
Shit I forgot
---
That is a bad idea. 
---
Forgetting crossplay for second, supporting MNK on console (without input filters) would be terrible for a large majority of the console playerbase. The console player base is majority controller users, because that is the default input device for any console.
---
One of the huge problems with console siege, especially at higher ranks, is the use of MNK adapters. People who use those adapters are at an unfair advantage over controller players, especially since console Siege lacks aim assist for online play, making thumbstick aiming all the more difficult. 
---
Having native support with no filter will GREATLY increase this problem, as now people no longer need to purchase expensive adapters. With a big barrier to entry removed, the floodgates would open. A console player should not be forced to purchase a MNK to remain competitive on a platform where that is not the default input device.
---
The reason this is not a problem with PC is that a PC's primary input device is a MNK, so a large majority of the player base is MNK users. I would argue that PC controller players are already hurting, since their preferred input device is a disadvantage, and they can't do anything to level the playing field, outside of switching to MNK.
---
I Wonder how you can do that glitch?
---
Yeah but also the other thing would be cool
---
I think it was already there.
---
Haven't played it in a while tho
---
u/gasthejews88 is needed right now
---
Just make jager an even better dead eye shot maybe that would work
---
This game hasnt tried to be realistic in a minute
---
What makes your reliable
---
Ubisoft listen to meme YouTuber instead of actually balance the game
---
Video game music doesn't usually carry claims. If a company does, they're usually seen as greedy, and because people can't make money off of that content on youtube, people won't make videos of that game. A great example of this is nintendo. They used to do this, but last year they retracted that and now people can use things like the metal battle music from smash melee or something from mario kart. Halo doesn't do this.
---
However if it were blow me away, id be claimed out the ass lmao.
---
Why does everyone have moderator name tags or whatever they are?
---
Still cool
---
But recruit is funny haha
---
Winning gunfights, making openings for play to be made, being able to make good decisions under pressure and knowing the right callouts
---
The bluffs to guns are just fine to me, its something that will make her more viable overall, what my proposition aims for is to reduce the chances of coppers banning her because they cant drone properly by making it less frustrating to be headshot through a wall because theres a big red flag above your head showing your standing position.
---
He doesnt own any ops so he has to play recruit
---
What’s your rank
---
User flairs?
---
Silver 2
---
Yes how do get them?

Did they keep the Boston bear Jew?

Plz no I still have ptsd of jager and bandit acog.

Ok we can’t queue together rip

With plastics?
---
Innovative, but burnt plastic stinks.
---
What’s your rank? I’ll get into gold pretty soon
---
balancing
---
He is so unbearably awful now that someone with their hands tied behind their head could kill him. I'd rather have operators banned based on strategy, versus people playing to the trend and banning the same 4 ops every single match.
---
Go to the subs homepage, tap the 3 dots, tap "change user flair" then pick whatever u want (this how to do it on mobile idk about desktop)
---
6 people wait a minute that's illegal!
---
He just phrased it poorly.
---
Glaz still has see-through smoke based on charge, but now people are much more lit up regardless of charge.
---
I just started playing on xbox and I dont get to play much, so I made some fan art in Photoshop while at work. I still only have the base operators so I didn't want to use a newer one. Sledge is my main on attack right now and I like Rook and Smoke for defense.

Bad boi. Those plates are for EVERYONE

Even the enemy
---
To the OP’s respect, “stuff looks like drones posts,” “shoot this camera out posts,” “new guns post,” “buff Warden posts,” and “look what my menu is doing posts” are always going to get posted.
---
OMG YES! This is such an original and great idea to give the lord and meme god a skin he is deserves!! It would be perfect, his mvp animation could just be of him surrounded by all the 16 year olds slamming their heads on their desks as they rock back and forth ROFLing and XDing at all the *original, great and funny* tachanka memes!!!! {😂}7{😂}7{😂}7
---
Yes, I’m saying the one on the right is how Ela’s hair has always looked, meaning there’s no reason to find it strange or out of the ordinary. It’s not like they changed her look for the elite. I do like the hair on the left though
---
The most important thing imo is make sure you're having fun. You'll learn common callouts, peeks, spots, and meta strats with time just by playing, but if you're not having fun then you won't play as well, learn as much, or probably even want to play at all
---
Nightmare material
---
Gimli ash
---
If you agree that a controller is a disadvantage vs a MNK, then why would you be in favor of thrusting this disadvantage onto a player-base with no option to opt out or in?
---
Oh I see, but do you have to stay still to see targets through the smoke?
---
Oh now I get it.
---
I know it's a personal thing, but I always hated ela's hair (just because I don't like that type of hair), so that's why I liked the edited one
---
Aww, is someone sad they can't spawnpeek attackers?
---
Ye mean Gimli's ass 😄
---
Yeah, but getting kicked for picking the new ops is still a thing...
---
They nerfed her shotgun too, why even pick her anymore
---
I said I’m not gayyy
---
I need more of this (art)
---
Why not CoD mobile? I hear it's pretty good. It's not R6 obviously but you're on a phone my dude.
---
Personally they should’ve given him impacts instead of C4. They should also look into tweaking the MPX like making it do 30 dmg per bullet like the FMG9 to make it more appealing
---
Only negative should be to slightly nerf the TCSG12 a tad. Nothing else. 
---
Losing the impacts was a big enough nerf
---
get good :)
---
What Glaz buff? When did he get one?
---
OPs account is like 5m old and this picture with almost the same title was posted like, within the past week.
---
Exactly therefore being “less” recoil
---
get ash in the phone, jager too while you're at it.
---
I know it's a good game but it's not that similar,you don't get that feeling of being a swat officer breaking into a house.
---
r/TIHI
---
Rook makin a smoove move on frost.
---
The artwork looks fantastic, but the title makes me want to die.
---
in the legs it isn’t a insta down
---
Awesome play man, keep it up!
---
Ah a fellow red dot user. Well met friend
---
oh son of -. I get the reference now.
---
I can see this as the splash art for Kapkan in game
---
woah that's weird
---
No, it’s the same recoil, you’re just SEEING less recoil because the holo/reflex makes it seems like your gun is moving less when its just the same as using an acog
---
Like 40%
---
Only body shots are insta-downs
---
And of course headshots are death.
---
That belongs on looney toons
---
When does this come out? Isn’t there an ela elite too?
---
That’s what we mean your seeing more recoil what we want is a 1.5 x zoom so that we can have better recoil control at a more zoomed in distance
---
They're nerfing her last primary weapon option in a way killing her (finally)
---
Finally, some useful thing
---
There’s a lot of you tubers you can watch: Varsity gaming, get flanked, macie jay and coconut Brah are among the best for knowledge.
---
Alpha packs are lootboxes but you only get cosmetic items like in OW so you have to buy operators.
---
Levels is like OW only a number.
---
#ChankACOG#
---
I think sorting players by input is a terrible idea.
---
I want players to be able to choose whatever they prefer, just as they are able to do on PC. If they prefer to use mouse, do it, it they prefer controller, do it. I don't like the idea of curated controller only environments. It is a pointless restriction.
---
I'm gold and I'm hurting my feelings.
---
very mousey indeed
---
You’d have the same recoil control, just a placebo effect, maybe you’d see your target better and have more fov on a 1.5 zoom but you’d have the same recoil
---
Best charm in the game!
---
50 50 RNG. You attack or you defend. There is no conspiracy.
---
Buck main further than any other operator I’ve played. Needless to say, I am pleased of this uniform.
---
Wouldn't work. This picture specifically has been reposted for two years now so Ubi obviously doesn't care or doesn't want to add this. Probably the latter because you shouldn't be picking Recruit in the first place.
---
Welp
---
Got one of my first Aces with her. 10 seconds of the lmg while trying to leave the elevator shaft killed all the defenders lol.
---
Spetsnaz Recruit exists. Close enough.
---
Welp, time to buy a fuckin battle pass
---
Im sure u could squeeze in 3 goyo shields instead of a barb lol
---
Jager needs to understand that even if he TKs Vigil he cant get the ACOG.
---
Glad you are. Meanwhile my boi mute hasn’t had anything good, or anything at all, since his elite in White Noise. He’s been getting shafted in terms of cosmetics so RIP ;-;
---
3 speed doc with rook armour and acog. *shivers*
---
Ela in that mode is nerfed from 3 to 2 speed and other 4 defending ops are all originally 2speeds from the normal game mode. Guess whats the speed of Zofia
---
Nokk is 2/2, 3 speed it's part of OP's sugestion
---
9x19vsn ACOG
---
Not even an attempt to get out of it
---
Nah, 80 damage if you can pull off the shot if nothing to joke about, and it adds to the skill if you can pull of a second shot.
---
Just fuze from above you buffoon.
---
I feel like an OP with a mirror on their gun or one of those camera sticks that police use would be really cool
---
Kali has limited range much smaller than that tho so if u have bandit and kaid (thatcher would prolly still get picked anyways) would be hard to tell where they are to get the kali to go off without droning
---
For a while there was a bug where the first people to load in were put on attack. But that should be fixed now, so idk
---
Can we test his recent buff first.
---
So just a stim pilot from Titanfall 2 but without the heal?
---
Ripppp
---
Then why is it that most pros considered the Ela shotty incredibly powerful? Do you know more than them?
---
Lol but he'd be a 2 speed
---
Aren't they reworking his gadget?
---
Well idk cause I never played that
---
You get the point though?
---
Oh
---
They're experimenting with how objects work so this could lead to some progress in fixing this issue as well. It's not like Ubisoft aren't trying to fix it.
---
Who cares?  This isn’t bomb...
---
Yeah I think you’re right. Have they addressed the client side debris issue? Do you know?
---
Noice bro im coping it for wallpaper thx
---
I believe I heard something about a fix for year 5 but I don't know if that's true
---
Why’s the BOSG acog emoji a bikini?
---
Well yeah but it'll be temporary aswell
---
If you have good team coordination then gridlock but if you play solo nomad
---
They did say something about client side debris for Y5S1, I totally forgot about that.
---
HELL YEAH! Give me a link
---
*JÄGERED*
---
Well, I don´t have that in casual its only happens in unranked.
---
That midriff 👍🏽👍🏽
---
I would love to have a reason to get Nøkk
---
I actually like that idea
---
Why do you think he should be a 3 speed?
---
Dead Meme? they added the acog to bosg just recently
---
Adding an attachment is easy enough to a weapon. Client side debris is a wider technical issue. One that was brought up months ago and slated for a y5s1 release for a fix.
---
Here's a thought... How about buff the Scorpion? Because it's literally impossible to control on console without tap firing, and even then it can kick out 5 feet from your original target.
---
I don't think they completely fixed it, a lot of the time the team with the higher ping is still defending first
---
rly wanna know as well
---
same thing happened to me and then the hostage died and my team won, yet it said i killed the hostage and i lost points
---
Im having a hard telling if you are sarcastic or not lol
---
First of all, you are a cunt if you do this.
---
Secondly, the interro just gets live instant, it won‘t be cancelled.
---
And, of course, you‘re a cunt if you do that.
---
Yes they will so dont leave your team hanging
---
Yeah it sucks, at least my other boi Mozzie has been getting a lot skins. He’s supposedly getting an Olympic skin soon.
---
 FTFY
---
 &gt; I feel like an OP with a mirror on their gun or one of those camera sticks that police use would be really ~~cool~~ fucking overpowered
---
Yes as long as the interrogation starts it will review positions if you leave or don’t
---
List now everyone who has that shotgun so I can buy them
---
Can we get rid of all defender acogs?
---
Time for downvotes and hate
---
Terrans are never ready for the zergs...
---
Word I’m a huge Mozzie player. I got fucked when I bought the Pro League set just for the night-ops bundle to come out like 5 days later
---
Doood hella sexy
---
MP5SD or MP7 for Nøkk would fit her better.
---
ash main confirmed
---
No hate but don’t you think that would be a little broken?
---
GIVE LINK NOWWWWWW!!!!!!
---
No tower is great!
---
Then why did you even bother commenting.
---
Ok thats insane
---
Oh my God!
---
That's right :]
---
Agree, majority dont care about the bosgacog. It could of been tachanka C4 for all i care. Its about the message it sends out. 
---
Eg; listening to a content creator that started a hashtag and devs listening to it only months after. 
---
Meanwhile it took them 4 years to realize limb penetration should be a thing, ive seen complaints about hands blocking headshots since the SMG-11 had an ACOG. Client sided BS has also been talked about since forever.
---
I love jager and main him a lot but still... No
---
good job looking up my profile just to tell me that but there is something called i dont care
---
Whos great idea was to base and fps balance on CONSOLE players (no personal offense intended buy yeah mnk is the only way if play an fps)
---
I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. I dont like finding reasons why I didnt win instead I think about ways I could win and remember that in my next games. If I lose it's more than likely because I somehow messed up whether it be trying to challenge attackers on a tight angle while I have a reflex and they have an acog or whether I try to over expose myself trying to get that kill there's a way to win. I dont believe MnK is the be all end all and it's not the only reason they won and I didn't
---
Good job
---
I'm platinum you absolute fucking retard, can you explain why the game looks more like team death match than attack vs defense these days then?
---
I can feel my grape getting popped before the update is even fully out.
---
Sure if the attackers die to a broken gun, must be the attackers fault. No way it could be the gun at all lol. I am not even talking about ela flanking. Just ela holding a small area in general. She would shit on any attacker close by with that gun. It's nothing to do with attackers playing poorly when they don't even get a chance to shoot their guns.
---
Tachanka: *Exist*
---
Imma end this man's life
---
Banned for what rule?
---
Superior to what, the supernova, wtf ubi I want some of that shit you smoked
---
You uncultured swine
---
Glaz also has frags and a much much higher fire rate so hes better in bigger firefights. Kali counters bandit in the same way thatcher does. If youre good you can still trick a thermite charge.
---
Good to know
---
I'd buy this. Never play him but still would buy.
---
Siick
---
Fuck if I know
---
Oo I agree ;)
---
I don't wanna be mean but sounds like you joined after filthy degenerates like Cav and Vigil were added and don't know how to defend hostage
---
We've seen a face reveal of him before, looks sorta like Misha Collins.
---
Because he knows it’s taking too long.
---
Then nerf it on console, pc balance is much different since you arent figthing against the controls to aim
---
There’s no cross play. Even if he’s using a controller he will be on pc servers still.
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure smudging isn’t illegal but is it against the rules on here to witch hunt? I know it can be frustrating but you just gotta deal with it unfortunately

Gregor has [this](https://youtu.be/F92iuJzV3s4) to say about the matter, and I think it fits well here. Like many have pointed out, it’s significantly easier to add the acog to the BOSG than it is to fix client side debris.
---
Having a smurf isn’t even bad, just play the game and stop bitching about people being better than you
---
I got a clutch ace in that same spot once with rook, killed 3 coming into garage, then the last two in construction. We were defending bedroom.
---
You are what KingGeorge might call a shitter, and I would agree that you are a bum piece of shit.
---
You can thank sbmm for that.
---
If they don't do something about the matchmaking smurfing is going to be a big problem.
---
Anyone can drop 20+ kills if they derank
---
The fire behind Vigil is what I feel as a Jackal main.
---
It was probably OP on console, but there's no reason to nerf it for PC where people have more situational awareness and reaction time, well, at least above silver.
---
I acctually do know, but I also understand how roaming works in comp
---
Vigil gang rise up
---
r/EmojiPolice
---
Yep.
---
From the patch update onwards the Mk 14 EBR and the K1A are going to drop pickrate so much that they will become redundant to make way for the new holy one.
---
The P10 has a really nice high fire rate though, and with the same accuracy as the FMG it would be fun to try out. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for the MP5SD I do agree it is a nice fit, but for me after playing Nøkk and considering she's an attacker, I feel like she at least needs a decent assault rife which is why I picked the F90.
---
Nah not listening LALALALALALA
---
An elite skin for Trashanka would be like buying a tuxedo for your garbage can.
---
Right there officer, that's him. Quickly before he gets away!
---
You speak of the dark times of Ela, for that you get downvote.
---
It sounds like nothing I say will convince you that the FO-12 isn't broken, and I'm not going to waste any more time trying to explain the difference between attacker advantage and defender advantage and how it plays into game balance. Just know that if you want to get better, making excuses isn't going to help.
---
Smurfs are kind of a problem, but not rly bannable. I mean in some games smurfs are actually somewhat encouraged (kinda, League is like that). Siege already did something about smurfs, they made the ranked level higher so smurfihg wasn’t as attractive. It’s really hard to differentiate smurfs and skilled players, u have to actually look at their gameplay (which just isn’t possible) and it’s not rly a written rule that smurfs are bad, it’s just kinda an unwritten rule that they’re annoying. That’s about it, actually, now in a way ubi forced smurfs with the ranked update and not being able to play with friends
---
How come you do my man's bikini like dat??

I agree with you on every point except for the first one. Old Hereford was the killhouse.
---
Because at the moment I think it’s only Gun skins
---
Yeah im wondering aswell
---
I was scared beyond terrified, but am now lol
---
I saw everything, but its casual, i dont want more ranked shitfests in quickplay.
---
You weren't even facing the doorway, of course they had the jump on you.
---
Tell me about it!
---
I see that now
---
Ok, I’m just checking, and you know what, sure I’d be down for these changes. Just when it comes to Ela mains, they try to bend the facts as much as possible, and act the most entitled that they can be to get the changes. You however do not seem to be one of these people.
---
The F0-12 however I think was way too strong, untapped potential up until this point. So at the very least, yeah, I would like to see scorpion to be changed to 30 round mag and less recoil in compensation, but she can still be potent in the right hands atm, and the gadget can add to team play and easier kills.
---
Xbox too btw.
---
I just assumed you couldn't read it tbh.
---
Good point
---
You can *start* worrying about grenades now.

Lemme guess cuz im on console?

Thats's a lie. just because you can't see how it enhances the game doesn't mean it's not there.
---
They all decided to swarm me like bees in a hive
---
No it was the tactical atmospehre of night raids, I am trying to explain but the majority of the playerbase are people who enjoy sweating, just leave casual the fuck alone.
---
Noooo dude, that's horrible lol
---
Bet
---
Have friends that switched over to PC they got Plat in their first month.
---
Glad you caught on to that lol
---
Oh God no,HE’S REACHED 999999% POWER
---
If you're such a god hit diamond
---
I was just pointing out the font was weird, especially the 'k' in skin looks WAY more like a 't'
---
She is to R6 what Mercy is to Overwatch
---
I'll say that I do think all maps should be in causal but the thing with night mode is that it doesn't change the game for the better in any way, I wouldn't mind the variety if the lighting wasn't so bad.
---
This "little edit"made me play the game again
---
Thank you! I’ll make sure to do that!
---
Yooo dude no way!! I'll add you as soon as I get home! Nice to meet you!
---
That'd never be enough to stop them all
---
The lighting was awesome for me and I enjoyed it, good thing I quit this game some months back, wish I quit earlier.
---
2 part question. Is this a bomb room too and if so, can the bomb be planted here
---
What atmosphere though?  The only thing that changed was that it was sometimes so dark you couldn't see properly 
---
I wish there was a different atmosphere, both inside and outside the building but all that was different was the lighting
---
I’m not even going to begin to try and understand this
---
Report and move on boys
---
I'm no good with the p90.. lol
---
Siege gives guns less recoil on controllers, your point is wrong go play with a mouse and say again.
---
are the kids on recess or lunnch or something? lots of people want night maps back.
---
Lol, is there a good one to begin with?
---
So true
---
You know that 90 percent of casual players dont drown their basements with sweat right?
---
How does it enhance the game I'm all ears 
---
In my opinion the only difference was that the lighting was worse, what made it better to you?
---
&gt;If nikk cant get acog then gridlock will lose it too
---
Care to explain why that is how it is?
---
IQ has the aug2 with acog, wamai has aug2 without acog
---
Just because its the same weapon, doesnt mean that attachments are the same for the operators that use them
---
come one ubi bring them back
---
Theirs no way they can throw 2 at the EXACT same time cuz lag, so it’ll yoink which ever ones closest
---
Only two things are preventing me from enjoying casual. “Meme maps” and mid game joining. I don’t wanna play Unranked either cause it’s a large time commitment. “Meme maps” are unbalanced. Aka, not fun. Unless you have a 3-5 stack and the other team is bad.
---
No, not any more no skill lesion cancer ops. 1 cancer lesion is enough
---
This guys knows, it’s more impressive to sledge someone that is flashed than downed
---
You know that you don't need to live in your basement or sweat to dislike night time? 
---
In fact I'm a casual player and I hate night time
---
***HOW MUCH***
---
Guys this is from the battle pass cinematic!!! This is probably in the battlepass
---
Right? Lol
---
Bruh I want to get either one but I can’t decide on which one that’s why I made this post
---
the post shows the attacker weapon leak for 2 seasons ahead. 
---
you said “yo next season is going to have some many weapons.” 
---
i said this is a leak for 2 season ahead. not next season like you said. 
---
you then keep on trying to tell me it’s for 2 seasons ahead when i told you that 10 times. I explain myself and you just don’t read.
---
Go for both then
---
Good question, i guess no because he is already a reflection but his suit block/invert it
---
Don’t share anything ever.
---
Probably one of those gold players who finally made it to plat 3 and think they are the shit and above the pleb ranks of gold.
---
Oh. You might wanna gain some experience before posting.
---
How is that gun name said? Boss-Gee? Or Bosog? Or just every letter individually?  I wish it was like Bo-Sog ACog
---
How have you even manged to get 3 legendary in the time that the Jackal set was released? Jesus, I have gotten legit 4 legendary in playing this game for almost two years.
---
I think OP meant that you can't buy it from the shop. Only way to get it is through packs
---
A meme gun that does insane damage
---
This season it’s been navi
---
And MY AXE
---
bruh
---
He be vibin
---
Who do you play more?
---
It has 2 shots and requires you to hit your shots, the DMR is still gonna be better
---
Humour me. How would they manage to rework Hereford better than they did? I’m generally curious as to what answer you could possibly give me.
---
How dare you, the karma farmers promised me I could post it tomorrow!
---
Probably, I've reached plat III many times and always drop out but from my experience Plat is easily the most toxic rank.
---
You can use the shotty like a silent buck or use the fmg to rush 
---
I always go whit my teammates when entering the building beacuse if they get down by a cav or a roamer i can help and later i start to search roamers or to sneak in the objective 
---
And you have to know the maps and drone a lot if you go lone wolf whit her but i dont recommend it in the first's minutes of the match
---
Nah played last night and got a game further
---
Call of Duty trickshoter more to me.
---
Yes.
---
Alternatively, for next April fools, an entire week where the only playable map is tower.
---
Caveira.
---
i pronounce is Baus-Gee basically, not really “BOSS GEE”
---
then i mean, ACOG is always “A-COG”
---
You get the charm for whatever rank you hit the highest and it doesnt matter if you drop
---
Listen kid, I dont want no shit rework, I want it back, the old and pure hereford base.
---
That makes no sense.
---
Why does putting my face near the gun tighten the spread? Why does shooting fast widen it? Why does a shitty laser pointer also tighten it?
---
Shotguns make no sense in this game.
---
You get the highest rank you earned that season
---
no
---
The highest rank you achieve is the charm you get.
---
So you get the charm at the end of the season?
---
Yea
---
Wait that could be used to see into waiting room next to customs, as well as the storage thats right next to it, this is potentially very powerful information if you walk on the other wall a couple meters more
---
people who are angry about the bosg getting an acog are deluded and are anti-consumer.
---
players from all walks of the game wanted it. and saying "oh this means they should give the german defenders acogs sksksksk" is a gross leap in logic.
---
simmer down. take a step back and think about why your mad a 2 round dmr-shotgun is getting an acog on both attack and defence.
---
Highest rank in season.
---
It having 2 shots is irrelevant, it still does more damage than any gun in the game.
---
“Listen kid”, it’s a shite map with no sense of balance. Put away your rose tinted specs, okay?
---
dude recruit memes are hilarious
---
I think there's just 2 Aug A2s now. One that has an ACOG available for IQ and one without for Wamai. IIRC one of the reasons why they didn't want to make new weapons was due to the ever increasing file size, not entirely sure if that's true if they're duplicating guns now.
---
Even if day I get in gold and I drop down to silver I still get the gold charm?
---
Nah I’m going to go 1 attacker and 1 defender not 2 defenders and I’m going to get Hibanas one
---
I mean it's not impossible
---
They have ok hitboxes but the best servers I can easily play with my friends in Brasil even tough I live in the EU
---
No kid, screw balance, I would choose fun over balance any day.
---
Yes they can but 2weeks for verifaction from sony/xbox is to long, test server is only 3weeks with like 3-4updates so there is no time for consoles.
---
&gt; emulator-esc
---
It's "esque"
---
Nah it’s pretty bad honestly and she had a high ban rate so nah
---
Sadly people are quite petty and they need to protect their pride instead of swallowing it these days
---
It’s really not, having 2 shots mean if you don’t kill the person within 2 shots then you’re dead, and it kicks so much that you can’t spam the two shots either, and it has a high drop off rate and the dmr is also a 2 shot kill and has 14 shots instead of just 2
---
A lot of luck and a lot of faith and you’ll get one of your own. :)
---
Why tho? Like yeah they are from Japan but do you have to be from Japan to be a weeb
---
Never :P
---
Know the maps if you solo queue (not good idea believe me)  always go for frags and rest well
---
And take it easy :)  is just a game and you can get back ur rank dont care is someone insults you because a mistake (take constructive critics)  and use t-hunt to practice your aim and found the perfect settings for you (sensivite, fov (if you use pc)  audio etc) and i will repeat it again sleep well so you can give your 100% in the match :)
---
I said I play lesion more but have black ice for both Docs mp5 and revolver
---
That’s a noice angle poor thermite got clapped harder than jfk
---
Yeah I should probably add that to the video
---
I think you’d be surprised
---
Well go play a non competitive game.
---
Well, if you play Lesion more, than get the Lesion Elite
---
Whit love a guy who was close to hit plat
---
Not really because both the K1A and the DMR are better options
---
Only has a high ban rate because people suck ass.
