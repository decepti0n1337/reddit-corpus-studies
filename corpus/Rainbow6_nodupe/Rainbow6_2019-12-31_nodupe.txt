Warden. He is literally the most useless operator there is.
---
Except you can‚Äôt hear anything but gun shots
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúperson with a disability‚Äù, and yes.
---
How would that be worth taking over a Nomad or a Gridlock? I don't think it would be.
---
I came here for this comment.
---
Dunno I feel it could be underwhelming for this to be a new operators main ability, i could imagine it being a secondary gadget on multiple operators I think it would be more viable then.
---

---
U forget tachanka?
---

---
Warden could be useful ins certain cases, tachanka is a recruit with 2 reinforcements
---
I still don't get how anyone can like the map but preferences, I guess.
---
I'd like the game much more if they let players choose which maps they want to queue for.
---
Don't solo que
---
It is! And it is such a maze to get around and it doesn't feel like Theme Park. I feel like this Operation overall is disappointing with Kali and Wamai, the removal of Casual and it being replaced by "Quick match" and almost all of the weapons except Kali's Bolt Action Rifle being recycled weapons and I am worried that Rainbow Six Siege is becoming stagnate overall and I am worried about that but I think if we wait we'll be fine :)

...... I got warden so...
---
He is, for the most part useless and I have only used his gadget successfully once but for some weird reason I can get a lot of headshots and one taps with his pistol and I always run it suppressed but I do love his pistol I won't lie even though it is overpowered.
---

Warden or Tachanka. Either way, getting rewarded for sitting still is THE worst possible mechanic to exist in the game, in front of global push button ops.

I think they should remove terrorist hunt classic from terrorist hunt and make it it's own thing. They could remove their ability to shoot but they can still move, you can use all operators and all maps and will always spawn outside and attack the terrorists, and they should remove c4 and barbed altogether, not just mitigate it like in ember rise. I'm sick of being at the beginning of the season and spawning in lone wolf thunt classic only to be able to try the new attacker and either play the shittiest game mode in the game (protect hostage) or auto lock new op and get one tapped by a teammate on spawn.
---
Holy shit
---
Tachanka is lord you heretic
---
Lmao yeah. I sometimes like to joke about drone aces tho. Like if I'm playing with one of my friends and I bop three or four drones in prep, I'll shout "Don't shoot the last drone(s) I'm going for the ace" in an annoying voice
---
Either you have to grind countless Weeks to get them or pay fot the Season pass. One is okay but 4? Fucking Four? They all should be free not buyable and be unlocked in a reasonable time...
---
Tachanka is lord you heretic I will burn you
---
He means without actually firing.
---
The best part is that you killed Blackbeard who's a US operative
---
That's probably the best thing about him and also his outfit or outfits!
---
Recruit is the hardest operator to see in the dark, lion is fucking easy to see in all light levels, are you opposed to those two operators existing? Am I wrong for wearin a black outfit on lion to win?
---
goyo, common rff griefing, they put shield on other side, reinforcement breaks it, you get penalised.
---
Can we perhaps get a list of the major things wrong with the map?  It‚Äôs the kind of map I‚Äôd love to play again without doing it in T-hunt or Article 5.
---
i got goyo, gangang
---
Lol i do that too, but i had a buddy who used to legit flex about drone aces cause it'd get him points early on in the round, and then he'd flex about top of the leaderboard and everyone would just give a collective sigh of shame
---
Joined! Tysm!
---
Warden 
---
 Reasons:
---
‚Ä¢He‚Äôs a fat 3 armor without an acog
---
‚Ä¢Guns are better used in other ops
---
‚Ä¢His gadget is way too situational
---
‚Ä¢When the gadget works, with smoke you have to stand still and no one uses smokes and with flashes it works a bit but the other person is not flashed either so you still die most of the time because you‚Äôre to busy activating your gadget.
---
Tachanka is overpowered when spawn peeking using LMG
---
Hell no lmao
---
Wamai is actually one of my favourite operators, I've seen alot of hate towards him though as he is just a btec jager. Hopefully we get something fun come soon!
---
Wow man! Thank you so much, that‚Äôs very helpful and very much appreciated. I‚Äôm not so much very knowledgeable about PC‚Äôs but I‚Äôm learning and eager to learn more. Most of that did make sense to me but I will have to search I few stuff you said I must admit, again thank you dude you‚Äôve helped me out tremendously.
---
Which means u are a static which can be killed easy, there is no argue about that, warden could be useful from time to time, but there is no chance, tachanka can be useful under any circumstances
---
I 100% dont understand why number 15 is a thing. Who at ubi thought "let's give 3 thunt modes to attackers and have the best one (classic) be attacker only. But wouldnt it be a sneaky if we gave literally the worst thing we could come up with to the defenders and that's the only time you'll use em in thunt"
---
This gives me PTSD

NOOOO!!!! The Wamai Magnets would blow up the chair.

Don't forget that there's basically one entrance for attackers that doesn't leave them completely exposed. There's no real "safe" way to enter the building as an attacker.

Names and flairs check out for the both of you

This is my first time of 7 months of playing this game that I witnessed this lol
---
Get rekt mozzie
---
i literally do that to every single person i down, even ask my team üòÇ
---
Yeah i don't see any reason either. But people post loads of random shit on the internet that isn't true for no reason so i like having proof to actually know if it's true or not.
---
I do..
---
Yea but I got her in the free pack I wanted lion tbh
---
hey sorry for the late reply and if i get the chance i will definitely hop on with u man
---
the player pools are combined for pc, and it is on the same uplay account, however I don't think that'll work because steam's version requires you to run steam and have it open. I don't know if Epic's version requires you to run Epic, go ask support?
---
I would watch some videos on the basics and on the operators you use. Since so much of this game is knowledge based this will make your learning curve much easier. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I could also squad up with you and show ya the ropes
---
she still only got disabled because of that bug
---
What happened?
---
I played a match and after getting no kills in the first round and being the last to die I was sent messages about how bad I was by two players and team killed two rounds in a row, I think I ended up only getting one kill by the end, I just turned the game off and didn‚Äôt play for a few hours, the very next match I played I got 15 kills (plus an accidental team kill so 16 kills). I never get salty with people playing poorly, and I never team kill them, it‚Äôs better to have an extra body in the game distracting the enemy even if they can‚Äôt shoot than it is to demoralize them and team kill them.

Of course it's never confirmed until like a day before it comes out, but it should be the correct date unless delayed. Feb 17 for TTS, March 10th for the official
---
I did by accident

I've found that recently when I join a game late, it will show players on a different floor than they are actually on. Ying is probably actually inside on third floor balcony, shooting at someone on the second floor.
---
you should increase you‚Äôre sensitivity

I got Warden so that's not much better. He's pretty useless

I also got her in the free pack...

Yeah but it seems like there used to be a much wider range of maps to play

---
I love this delete fortress out of all things
---
My point is that it's a very minor issue. And most common grief is a gross over exaggeration. Teams of people forcing players into certain strats, unprovoked kicking, hacking, etc are far worse by comparison. On another note, the reason a reinforcement would break the shield is most likely to prevent the shield from clipping into a reinforcement, so it does make complete sense.
---
See full screen
---
Fact is that Bartlett was never intended to be in the game as a multi-player map. It was a situation/T hunt only map, but early on in Siege's history, a lot of players bitched and wanted the map in multi-player too.
---
Then we found out that the map designed for single player only shit is an awfully designed multi-player map.
---
just tried all options, no difference between them fps wise minus msaa (lost about 10fps avg from this one)
---
Post that kill the guy was like ‚ÄúWHERE TF SID YOU COME FROM‚Äù. I had the exact same thought

back when i played this game like 2 years ago on a worse pc/relatively similar settings in game as now i got way more fps... dunno what the deal is, every other game i own runs amazing besides siege

Tower can get fucked with a cactus.

Would the shield be his gadget or operator? I feel like this is a good idea. Maybe if it was his gadget it could do more than just soft walls?

I like it but maybe one more charge and I would do smg 12 or m45 meusoc

I can‚Äôt shoot enemies if they‚Äôre super close or far away from me (I always forget to use knife), I‚Äôm more used to holographic sight, I use drone mostly but I still forget about it sometimes .  I rarely push unless time is close. My reaction is kind of slow so when I‚Äôm peaking I probably get shot and die first. I don‚Äôt hide in a safe spot and do nothing like before, I walk around to find possible places that I can kill enemies easily or when they‚Äôre not noticing now, just I‚Äôm not that good enough to carry even its copper match

So buy Kali, use her in a match lose. Refund, buy Wamai, use him in a match lose, Refund, buy Maestro and so on. So all you need is to keep refunding and buying every match. Is that your suggestion?

Ubisoft has said they have no intention of a sequel, problem is the game is getting old and clunky. Maybe there will be a sequel but I'd expect it for free considering I've given 500 euro or smth. But most likely that sequel would freely replace the game for all who have it, in 2 to 3 years considering dev cycles
---
I can't clutch for shit so you know what I'm about to do
---
I love this idea! Only thing i'd slightly tweak is headshot mods. I think smalls arms fire could be two headshots. And rifles etc be 1 depending on bullet and other rifles 2 bullets. Otherwise this sounds incredible! 
---
I also considered whether he could have a mountable LMG except it's bipod mounted through holes in walls and benchtops etc
---
I guess u are not plat yet?
---
The solution is: don't main someone. Read the enemys like an open book and adapt your playstyle.
---
PC players already get enough bro
---
Not happening. On Siege streams you see teammates leaving matches to go eat, bathe, walk the dog whatever then return. Such a penalty will severely reduce the number of players playing with Streamers which is their free advertising.
---
at first i was like, ‚ÄúLET‚ÄôS GO IS IT AN ELITE !‚Äù and then this kinda killed the hype, wish you could sell charms and stuff but it‚Äôs cool, i can live with it.
---
Well ash is like to go to attacker for this type of play, maybe try Zofia as well.
---
Using smoke for roaming/spawn peeking is a waste, better let your team use him as an anchor and choose doc, j√§ger or someone that you can use all of your utility in the prep phase.
---
i really like pink duck and gloves, wish you could sell charms or trade them tho
---
It is not too late at all . They still add in a lot of new content and the community still very active . Fr get the game
---
This clip can be as Year 1 Season 4, as Bartlett was added in the Season 4 reinforcements
---
You should try and branch out ,the more flexible you are the better you'll play
---
It literally doesn't to me, nor has ever, in my like 12 years of online gaming, anybody unironically used "clutch or kick". Could it be the US servers being more toxic?

Thatcher is one of the best ops in the game especially paired with thermite so that‚Äôs a good black ice
---
GENERAL KENOBI

A low level acc used by high level, very experienced players so they can play against newbs and low level players and essentially just smash the shit out of them. Usually so they can feel better about their own inability to break the ceiling they've hit on their main account.

Money. Why did you buy before you ask?

its a separate thing, with money not credits.

Unless they are changing it with the battle pass introduction.

Very angry communist noises

Valk. Easy spawn peeks with cams

I didnt say anything about gridlock.

Valks more better for info for your team but Jagers my favorite for his trophy systems and his gun so I would go with jager

Idk man, I coulda swore I bought this pass with credits, I always buy the pass but never remember.

THEY ARE IN THE TREES I REPEAT IN THE TREES

just got that today, that charm was ALSO my first legendary
---
Depends both have their perks and depends on criteria. Guns:jager. Utility: valk. Intel:valk. Plant denial: valk. Speed:jager. Grenade counter: jager. It‚Äôs an opinionated discussion but both are good and it can depend on the strategy and rank of your team and your opponents‚Äô
---
OP you know that the US also went to war with Korea?
---
The thing that‚Äôs wrong about this is not that Tachanka is bad, because he is an absolutely amazing op, it‚Äôs that people play him poorly, so his stats appear terrible.
---
Unfortunately, Plasma Pink can no longer be found in Alphapacks. It got removed a while ago :(
---
Or if the title was the Korean War.
---
These are all so great. I can‚Äôt wait to see your channel take off.

"Mounted and Ready"
---
So, quick question. How many recitals of the Soviet National anthem you think it would take to make up for this blasphemy?
---
If he wasn‚Äôt terrible op, he would not be the only op with 0% pickrate in pro.
---
I have decent stats with him (around 1.0 W/L and 1.6 K/D), but he is mostly meme and only good when he surprises enemies, so mostly lower rank and dumb players.
---
It would've been funnier if was maverick with his M4.
---
Record your games and go back and watch them. Pay close attention to why you died and what you could have done better. The best way to improve is to focus on fixing your bad habits and practice the things you struggle with. Taking the time to watch how you play situations and trying see what you could have done different will help your gamesense and help you make better decisions in difficult situations
---
But he was picked in pro a couple weeks ago

i‚Äôm okay with tower, i enjoy favela, i fucking hate yacht, just take it out already

Hello improvisedPizza, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ehyxn9/ubi_what_is_this_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
This is a great way to create a dust2 situation where every other map that is not dust2 will have a longer queue time while on the same time making the playerbase worse.
---
Imo a better way to do it is to allow us to ban say 2 maps I will never have in my rotation. This would also give better statistics on actuall bad maps.
---
What platform and does it stand for anything?
---
Aight, my guy, calm your tits
---
I kinda achieved the same effect with a auto-clicker macro while holding down sprint
---
Shift +F2 should work. There is sometimes a bug when you cant even buy it (maby that's the case) so just wait a day or a week and you'll be able to buy it. Also I'm not even sure if you can buy it trought website. 
---
Also also try to click the + of r6 credits in menu screen
---
I think his mate saw me...
---
Is that Rogue 9 at the end?!
---
ash used to have a broken hitbox that was smaller than the actual model
---
even after that was resolved there was plenty of hitreg and ping issues still so people kinda just turned it into a meme
---
fun fact, blitz's head hitbox used to include his earmuffs so you can headshot him by hitting those
---
NOPE.
---
Tbh it is creative, but the dual action will be very, very hard to code in considering the data limits, and cav honestly doesn't need any Nerfs.
---
"Baby tachanka getting mounted and ready" where can i watch that again.
---
I swear to God IQ, quit making everybody kill themselves
---
I used to do it on Bartlett too
---

---
I don‚Äôt know what you mean by that, so I‚Äôm just going to assume you mean what attachments I put on MPX. I use comp and ang with holo since the gun is ez to manage and faster ADS speed always helps
---
rainbow six siege hacks?
---
yeah sounds reasonable, please link
---
My parents do not care for it
---
The issue is that maps like Favela and House and Plane genuinely *can* be fun.  If you just mess around, blow stuff up, and run around it's fine, but Tower doesn't let that happen.
---
In Tower, nothing feels safe, nothing feels fun, nothing feels like it was even thought out.  Silly operators like Amaru basically don't function, roamers are basically free to control the entire map and flank at will, etc etc.
---
It's not just unbalanced, it's poorly designed.
---
Nothing since the pic is gone
---
Same goes for me it's either impact or c4 because the way my grenades work it hits the wal wall somehow ricochet off anything and roll back to me

I was once iffy on thatcher. Now hes like my runner up for most played. It's nice feeling useful almost always. Regardless if you frag out or not.
---
Cool, but its on casual.
---
I wasnt even that mad just in shock. I told the zofia he jumped on my screen so we could have a laugh but he ended up being toxic :(.
---
Nokk needs either an Acog or a proper AR.
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
This was a pro league strat back during parabellum. Nothing new.
---
When you put ur arsenal on the sub, I upvoted it. The issue is, I don‚Äôt ever remember upvoting it.

Oke,im on console so i cant change servers i think

I love how he used your instead of you're

Yeah, I know. I've seen this happen a few times I just thought it was funny, you can tell she's on the 3rd floor when she vaults
---
Thanks stranger!
---
Learn how to spell please for my sanity's  sake
---
Clash is a good operator in a communicating stack and is a proper threat to an unprepared team.
---
Would've been better if it was elite bb

Ex-Gold here (ended silver last season, sadly).

I don't always see Jacky banned. It's a good split of him, nomsd, bb, lion, etc..

I love this, do u think it would be possible to

make this thing shoot? Either way this is super cool
---
Glacier &gt; Black Ice

Just missing the twitch dude

Exactly!

Sadly Jacky will he victim to goldfish brains.

Nah, this was better

Thank you

My apologies for distracting from the post but how do I get that beautiful flair?

Oh, sweet, I'll tk the friend I'm boosting when we're about to lose so he doesn't lose his rank

I got her as my free op for Christmas, I'm livid

What sort of bands do you recommend?
---
Elastic bands are pretty good, they can stretch and be adjusted pretty easily. Metallica is pretty solid, especially their song ‚Äúhit the lights‚Äù. My personal favorite.
---
Jackal mains: oh yeah, this is big ping time
---
I know u can't read or write

Been there, done that. Happened to me last season and this season as well.

nice rdr2 reference

Depending on whether thatcher EMP'd his ADS or not

Me too but noone lets me

I‚Äôm not a ranked player, what‚Äôs this about?

you have zero iq

"Mounted and ready"

I have a couple of questions. First, who is mounting Lord Tachanka? Second, what the fuck?

No no, this isn‚Äôt friend child‚Äôs play TK, im talking ‚ÄúWTF DID HE TK ME!!!???‚Äù TK.
---
And that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt use lasers in this game.. I always run away from guys on my team with lasers
---
Happy cake day!
---
Most of my clutches has me trembling in my chair really, but my play is still methodical, in any clutch you need to play calm, thats what i learned
---
i‚Äôm wus, was queing last night with a few buddies and we couldn‚Äôt find a game for 45 minutes.
---
Me and a friend of mine got this charm literally at the same time, had us wondering for a while if alpha packs were time dependant.
---
Holy crap that was intense!
---
This is actually a good map doe ?
---
Btw when are the maps rotating again. I rather play hereford and fortress than faveka and plane
---
What i do that usually works is turning my back to shields and pretend to put my focus else where and as soon as you hear the un-shielding wait a second then 180 headshot him.
---
Remember no russian
---
this is too shitty for r/shittyrainbow6
---
You probably won‚Äôt find anyone to do it for free. But a good platform to look on is fivver
---
Right, it uses it's own hidden mmr not caring about your ranked mmr.
---
I‚Äôm WUS as well and I have no problem. 2-3 queueing is hardest to find matches especially 2-6am
---
Would you agree that New Kanal deserves the boot over New Theme Park?
---
(I'm also aware Chalet exists).
---
It used to not be able able to stop a plant, but since the defuse timer changed in ranked he can stop a plant
---
what rank are u
---
My gf had the same situation. It nvr stopped but she didn't give up with her game. Just ignore those immature guys and enjoy the game fully. I'm only 16 but I really don't care if its a boy or a girl on my team, they're just nrml ppl trying to play a game that is made for all genders.
---
we were a 5 stack
---
Plat 2 on my highest currently
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I preferred old them park, kanal is bad and I know chalet isn‚Äôt bad but I don‚Äôt like it
---
In the middle of the night though?
---
nice
---
I'm 132 and still don't have one
---
nope, 6pm
---
Invisible cams with a massive FOV, can deny plants, can knock Monty out of full shield, the stuns last a good bit and are stronger than Zofia/Ela‚Äôs stun, and his gun does more damage than the MP5 while having no tracers. 
---
Don‚Äôt main ops. Dumbest thing this sub promotes.
---
It's not a simple Event dude it's the Six Invitational ! And Everyone already talk about this you late \^\^
---
I saw this kind of strat a lot, i also got killed this way lol
---
No one talked about the event theme music or the full set of harry mvp screens voice lines.
---
Only about the cosmetics and the gameplay of the map.
---
So no,i wasn't late.
---
I mean, you could have gone around.  
---
Improvise.
---
I'd be happy with that. It would be better if they didn't take so long to add new maps to pro league aswell though
---
I hate to be that guy, and I don't know where else to put this, but please know that reason this happens is because experienced players know the audio queue for un-ADSing and shifting positions/reloading. I know this shouldn't need to be said but people who yell into the mic because of "omg timing" really make things unfun.
---
What in the Casual
---
what's the point of reworking maps then if ranked would have always the only 5-6 maps.
---
So bad stop blaming the team mates, you could rush blue and helped and use a mic.
---
Finka
---
Sometimes it‚Äòs really the timing, I doubt some guy heard me ads in battlefield, cod or any type of game while they‚Äòre 3 football fields away from me.
---
She might be annoying but R6 just doesn‚Äôt feel right without the scream of ‚ÄúYu fooken muppet‚Äù
---
Timer starts at 3:30, obviously casual
---
Finka : Am i a joke to you?
---
Not today ü§£
---
Ar33 has both angled grip and faster fire rate, in a game with one hit headshots it's the best option for him, idk why people use the other one more
---
I miss her a lot. I got her from the Holiday Packs 2019 and wanted to have some fun with her.
---
FIFA isn't a game as a service and ubi has said that they don't want a sequel, that why I'm making the connection that if not free maybe a discount and a transfer of items. I don't even thing it's gonna be siege 2 but more of an engine upgrade in the form of a different game cause lord knows how big that download is gonna be if they have to change engine in an upgrade... That's the thing and why I said what I said, even ubi doesn't want it to happen but at some point pushing a 2015 engine to do more is gonna be impossible
---
yeah one anime siege trailer and one  R6 comics  :P
---
Eh, headshot cases a lot of times are plausible though bc hit reg sometimes screws you w your pants around your ankles. Or latency.
---
Even better, take rook, 
---
Similar usage, but all get 1
---
The Game is a first person tactical shooter with three multiplayer modes: Bomb, Hostage, Secure Area.
---
The essential is like this: 5 Attackers and 5 Defenders spawn on the map, with a 45 Second preparation phase for the defenders to use their gadgets (plant traps, move to a certain position  reinforce walls etc) while the attackers drive around with drones trying to find the objective and spot the Operators. When phase ends the attackers will spawn outside of the building and now have to# in bomb: Defuse the bomb/ in hostage: Bring the Hostage to safe zone outside/ in secure area: stand for a certain amount of time in the objective without the defenders interfering# And then we have the other modes like Terrorist hunt (PvE) Situations (PvE) and Custom Games.
---
There different queues for matches 1. Quick Match 2. Newcomer 3. Ranked# Newcomer is only playeble if you are under level fifty/ ranked is only playeble if you are over level thirty.
---
And at last we have most important part of the game.. The operators, all with different Abilities and weapons.
---
You can, of course, ask me any Questions you still may have and Good luck
---
At least people know he only has one so they don't hound him constantly, but yeah I really feel bad for Rook mains
---
I think normal enemies have the armour of a 2/2 as bombers were the 1speed/3 armour ones
---
Bikini bodhi??! LOL
---
Is there any way to let teammates know I have no more stims left? People tbag and all that jazz asking for one but I don't know how to tell them I'm all out
---
I don't understand one thing...

Bandit has like a helmet with like a visor on it, but is 3 speed

I would give you an award if i could, realy thank you im alredy buying it can i dm you for anything else?

Call out ur shots

Doc is dummy thicc
---
For sure my dude

How would I go about doing that?

Im loving this comunity
---
Is this some kind of veteran joke I'm too noob to understand
---
Indeed
---
It took one of my friends half a year

Just move your lazy ass and rotate into objective lmao

You make the mistake and the blame is for the teammates? Good one.
---
Youtube down or somethint

BuT fUzE iS FrOm UzBeKisTaN

---
In my experience when this happens and I see the killcam it's literally just a guy randomly walking around and strolling into the angle I just gave up
---
60hz also has a lot of latency by itsself
---
^this just in... __*we found a mad one*__
---
And side note: If you play the game and someone calls you trash.. *Do not listen to them* it can only make it less fun because R6 can be toxic but there are still many awesome people out there.
---
Could just remove the Acog from her version of it
---
Ive alredy played halo its fine

Oh Ok :)

I can only imagine the callout that BB gave his team.

contact Ubisoft support instead.

Do you honestly think some subreddit is gonna be able to do anything?
---
Eh worth a try haha
---
Something that helped me a ton was playing Minecraft. It was a relaxing game that I could play to get used to mouse and keyboard. 
---
I also lowered my sensitivity and dpi so that I could make about 1 full rotation from the center of my mousepad to the end with hipfire, and I changed my ADS sensitivity to 71 (did that after 400 hours of gameplay, and I wish I started with it at 71. Apparently, 71 is ‚Äúmonitor match‚Äù). I‚Äôd also make sure I have Raw Mouse Input enabled in Siege. I also mapped my Melee to and Grenade to my mouse buttons. Oh, and I also changed my Push to Talk to Caps Lock.
---
Also, with general typing, don‚Äôt be afraid to check out some online typing trainers to get used to using the keyboard with both hands. I liked using Ratatype to teach myself how to type properly. 
---
For aim training, I got the best results by just doing T-hunt classic and forced myself to headshot only. I would do it on normal with an ACOG, then a Holo, then a pistol. Once I got through the runs fast enough, I‚Äôd bump the difficulty to hard. Sometimes I‚Äôll do No Reload runs to make sure I‚Äôm hitting them Heads. 
---
My current sens is 18xy and 71 with 500 dpi
---
Me say alone ramp
---
ME SAY ALONE RAMP
---
No you noob where else would you have been in that bathroom? Think about it
---
Based on S3, I‚Äôd expect a mid-season rotation. We are only a month into the new season, so I‚Äôd expect that to come around mid-January.
---
IT's partially better due to reverse damage on friendly fire
---
1) First of all, The game is super competitive, and players will team kill each other for no reason at all, especially on console, so be aware of this cause this was / is / will continue to be part of rainbow six siege. I recommend playing with friends, or finding friends that play R6, it will be a much more pleasant experience in you can help it.
---
2) second, The movement is much, much, much slower than the normal COD / battlefield games, plus you can kill (and get killed) much faster too. You can rappel up and down walls on the outside, and blast holes in soft walls, ceilings and floors on the inside, this is what makes R6 stand out from the other FPS.
---
3) third, and there's upwards of 20 maps you'll need to learn, so it can be super overwhelming at first. If you are inclined to learn them fast, you can always load up a private match where you can explore and familiarise with them. But it's alright if you don't , tbh I didn't completely learn every single room on every single the map until I got to around lvl 90.
---
4) On top of that, you'll also need to learn the 40+ characters, again, no need to stress, keep to the base game original characters, as they will be introduced to you in the tutorial situations. Personally I recommend Sledge on attack, and Rook on defence. Sledge is super straightforward he swing a big hammer, he's simple, he's effective; rook put down armour plates for friendlies, so even if you get killed 10 seconds in the round, you'd have contributed to your teammates.
---
5) I recommend practicing in Terrorist hunt until you reach at least lvl 20-ish, in that way you'll be able to get familiar with the controls, movements, characters, guns and the maps etc etc.
---
6) always always always watch the kill cams, you learn something new from it every time. whether it be an angle, a cheap shot, an exploit, an amazing play, or even something super silly.
---
7) watch some tutorials on YouTube, they can teach you so much about the game, things that would've taken forever for newbies to learn.
---
Bruh
---
That's what they fookin get
---
I‚Äòm kinda disappointed too
---
Thanks for the reply. I might try again if some of my friends that used to play with me want to give it another shot. How does the reverse friendly fire impact a team of 4 taking turns TK‚Äôing though?
---
Special challenges are on thursday, I suppose we will get a few this thursday.
---
Which one is you?
---
I don‚Äôt know who this NoBan is, but I will find him, and I will kill him!
---
What's the point of that when New Year's Eve is today. They have been known to update special challenges outside of Thursdays schedule but given the celebration it seems they didn't bother to prepare for it.
---
Not a fucking bit
---
Para Bellum?
---
They get penalties in ranked but not in other game modes, not everyone wants to join a game that‚Äôs 0-2 and stick around for the loss so it wouldn‚Äôt be wise adding it to quick match.
---
It activates reverse friendly fire for the entire squad.
---
Preach it brother
---
AFAIK the mods are not affiliated with Blizzard
---
Recruit said gay rights
---
Maybe they should have an option for you to try out the operator once before buying it instead of refund.
---
Ok, most of my early play time will probably be use to learn the tactics, being familiar with maps and not being one tapped as soon as the offense start  anyway.
---
Okay, clearly this is going in one ear and out the other so I‚Äôll be as detailed as I can.
---
Ubisoft releases 2 new operators that look super cool and useful! Wow! Here‚Äôs your options:
---
A) Spend $10 to Ubisoft (or however much it costs to buy an operator)
---
B) Refund some garbage ass operators like Clash and Warden to get them for free
---
Less. Money. For. Ubisoft.
---
They‚Äôd never do that to themselves
---
We‚Äôre hitting ping levels that shouldn‚Äôt be possible!
---
Why Tf does it even matter if it‚Äôs year one or year 5? It‚Äôs the ideas in the post that OP is trying to focus on
---
No, because it has weight
---
Sound off if you are zealous?
---
This would be about 26 seconds of ping. Jesus.
---
Wow she‚Äôs really good at the game.
---
Train your aim,get map knowledge, have a good game sense and have a good team or some mates.
---
Ik, but I mean the bullet is knocked out of a gun when the trigger is pulled and makes something blow the gunpowder. Right?
---
i know right!? dudes a knower his game sense is through the roof
---
When can we get this Fuze buff where you can ClUsTeR cHaRgE uPwArDs?
---
If you need renown,do situations. Each challenge there gives you 200 renown so you get 600 renown per mission for all 3 challenges.
---
I think there was like 9 or 10 missions that can give you challenges so you should make up to 6k renown in total.
---
Then watch click on the old tutorial videos and then back out again to claim 200 renown. You'll end up with like 6600 renown.
---
Go to the ubisoft club rewards section and claim your free "200 renown".  you then have like 6800-7000 renown.
---
After that,all you can do is playing terrorists hunt to learn the aim settings,attachments and operators. Terrorists hunt also gives renown.
---
Under the playlist symbol at the main menu(the symbol is 3 lines above each other),you can find the alpha packs. go right or left to find a holiday pack which unlocks a random operator for free.
---
They are rarity ratings not how good they are.
---
He won't, karmawhores
---
he's the reason we have bosg acog! great guy, really funny
---
if you compare them with some other legendary, it is actually a pretty good one
---
I understand that but shouldn‚Äôt the more rare one be the cooler ones?
---
I just feel most legendaries in this game are bland and boring compared to purpled/blues
---
That was such an easy win for them and they went retarded.
---
Lmao aim bot
---
Just look up for the most competitive ones
---
Who the fuck wants to play rank in house favela and plane?
---
Claymores will show up on the screen as well
---
lol good shit, DANIEL!
---
Can't vote to kick in ranked and unranked though, so if you play those game modes you're safe from being vote kicked.
---
But if there‚Äôs a penalty people probably won‚Äôt leave in the first place so there won‚Äôt be any game to join that are 0-2.
---
That‚Äôs fucking enough...
---
We need a role for creative posters and they should have an account from social media with a proof that has their arts . Like ‚Äúapproved creator‚Äù role in this sub with a blue-white tick . Just like Twitter
---
Think of the Chinese children!
---
*donk*
---
ah okay, you play normal contruller or do you have kontrollfreeks von the analogs
---
because it seems very high sense for-
---
also if you move up , it go very fast up with 40v
---
Lol no,  
---
It just loaded too fast and some object that were destroyed do not reflect that client side. After 20 seconds this goes away.
---
He‚Äôs coming out of the closet!
---
Maybe because it's a Christian-centric celebration, and there's currently a huge crackdown on Christians in China right now? Just a guess.
---
Not to bad with a vertical grip, a little side to side and a little upward
---
Actually, headshots in rb6 don't always register.
---
Literally the best thing to see. More ops for me.
---
Hand made my ass.
---
When the queue goes past a few minutes just restart the queue.
---
You know what, fuck it. Most of the time I‚Äôll give a sarcastic remark but this time I will give you some constructive criticism:
---
The edits were really nice, kinda like Fitz, it suits a gaming video well. Try to make it original so you wont look like another copycat, but I was surprised of the quality of the text, in a good way.
---
Now the jokes were a bit too much for me. Normally I like a good dark humor joke but I wasn‚Äôt really being entertained. I only watched this video so I don‚Äôt know if these are the type of jokes you put in all the vids, but if you do, you‚Äôll attract a individual group who like the jokes. Normally this is the purpose of a Youtuber, but with games like Rainbow you could attract a lot of other target audiences. Its up to you if you wanna change that but for me it‚Äôs so-so ish. Looked like you guys had a great time tho so that‚Äôs nice!
---
Lastly I‚Äôd like to say you have potential, so I‚Äôve subscribed and interested in what you have in store for the world! Good luck
---
He's mkb
---
Tengo 4 de defensa y 4 de ataque, todo bien en principio no?
---
Whats your rank and k/d
---
this map and its 80% play rate during white noise is why I got my first ever silver charm, actually crushed my soul
---
thought you could, chill
---
Si
---
-
---
Well mate considering that you're playing on Mouse and Keyboard on a console and you're still 0:3 down doesn't make you look all that good tbh
---
what's up with people never restarting queue after 2-3 minutes
---
First one for China New Year, second one for special bundle
---
pretty much
---
ahahahaha you‚Äôre so very funny, i play on an elite controller with decently high sensitivity and good aim.
---
I use kontrol freeks
---
It's at the end of the season, then you'll get your charm, I think.
---
No one cares. 
---
Did you make the post to make other people happy or just to make yourself happy? 
---
And check my posts, I'm not a "reposter". Thx.
---
Thanks for the accusation but I'm not
---
u/attattx look at the username
---
Thats a short queue timeü§£
---
At least you‚Äôve got an account to troll with now so hey ho ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
I wish more people played unranked for the queue times would improve. It's honestly my preferred mode now
---
Wrong! You can download test servers and see it yourself
---
I wanted to buy Nokk and that's why.
---
If you want a good time go into QM rank is for fair and balanced maps. 
---
That‚Äôs why I said most rework and not all. Old Hereford had a bunch of issues they took out most of them but the map feels bland and top floor is heavily defender favored, if you take too floor out the map is pretty good. 
---
Balance&gt; esthetic

Rule #9
---
The meme from this picture is very familiar...not sure where I watched this [redacted] before
---
Ok understood, but can I assign "new actions"?
---
For example: lean without ads'ing.
---
Believe me , lad . They will ignore any rules here like every Shitty reposter here
---
this clip right here was from nearly 3 years ago, i can't pinpoint the date but it was one of my earliest clips since launch
---
NANI ???
---
im just saying that it's possible to stop a plant with Maestro, not that it's easy or the best way to do it
---
you shoudln't be able to stop a plant with your evil eye anyway, because your evil eye should not be on the site. echo can do it because he can remotely relocate the drones
---
What attacker do you like to play?
---
Nokk
---
Microsoft and Sony is your answer . Not Ubisoft
---
Yacht was the only map to have a 50/50 (or close to) win rate. I'd suggest you play the game before talking. Obviously this was based off old metrics, but you cannot have new metrics anyway, since it hasn't been in ranked or pro league with the new ops.

Hehe

how did it go?

Hmmmmmm, interesting ü§î

It‚Äôs already uncompatible.

People use third party adapters that trick the console into thinking you are using a controller.
---
as all things should be
---
I have a ryzen 5 3600 and a 2060. I see where you are coming from. I was expecting more too from other games, but my siege runs at a perfect 150+ on maxed out. Other games like battlefield 4 however is too low at about 110 on ultra. For you thought it seems your gpu is bottlenecked.

It's beacsue I can read it  also.... BEAR HAMMER

Haven't met a hacker yet, but the climb to plat just seems to be filled with pretty decent players, I moved from xbox this season and when I hit plat it felt relatively the same
---
I play on a gaming monitor. 
---
I use 24V, 40H, 83ADS (But I can't use Acog with the ADS that high so I normally never do)
---
old hereford :(((
---
IMO, the Concussion effects should not "Stop" planting the mob. Think it would be better to be a like a %10-15 movement penalty and aiming, lasting for 4-5 seconds.
---
wamai
---
Thanks for getting it
---
Gotcha, thanks for your feedback, maybe that's what happened. I figured that if the DEVs made a gun with enough fictional features, they'd be able get away with not having to acquire a license to use it. The Glock isn't a good example, but the Holger 26, their version of the G36 is apparently substantially different from the real life G36 (different magazine release system for example).   
---
I learned just recently there is a term called "Trade Dress" in Airsoft that some manufacturers need to have a license for to manufacture an airsoft gun replica. To have the actual Glock or H&amp;K or FN or Sig Sauer trademarks imprinted on the replica, you'd need an additional license and thus spend more money. Maybe something similar is happening in Siege.
---
Yeah I know. But it‚Äôs a video game with a hint of realism so falling from 2 stories shouldn‚Äôt be survivable.
---
I always understand memes
---
I would say that you can but do play some other ops as well since theres always "that guy" who will take your op and guard It like he's a dragon
---
His machine gun is amazing at spawnpeeking too, acog, vertical grip, almost no recoil.
---

Hello El_yeeticus, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ei76v7/died_on_tower_and_immediately_crashed_2_times_in/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I love blackbeard on attack but some dude earlier was guarding him with his life
---
The rifle on his turret should be detachable and make him 20% slower.
---
It is painful for me aswell
---
I wonder what he did in those 346 hours of time played...
---
That's why I love using him. Especially since I play console
---
Yeah it looks like people did decide to downvote
---
Looks like 1st floor of the old hereford
---
This happened to me the other day
---
Yeah I might move to someone else once I've gotten better at aiming
---
Nobody goes for hardbreach bans or information op bans. But that could be because they're all randoms and can't function together anyways.
---
Old hereford
---
He says he got killed walking into the room. From where? Blackbeard is facing out the window. I presume the defender didn‚Äôt enter through the exterior window (even if it was a run out, Capitao would‚Äôve killed him first). So if he entered from hall of fame or the hallway, Blackbeard is facing the wrong way and doesn‚Äôt have an angle.
---
Cav IS powerful against randoms because they don't know how to refrag
---
I know it's longer than the SMG, but it feels too long for an Assault rifle too.
---
Piss time.
---
Maybe, but it feels really bad.
---
Looks like it was Old Hereford, but pre-release of the game.

*console ranked be like
---
Lol, true story. He had the choice of either style, but we both agreed this one looks better (even if it was more work to build ü§£).
---
 In my experience i see low levels doing better than 200+ plus level players in casual,also i agree that the random switch from attack to defence is unfair at times
---
[deleted]
---
Yea this almost never happens. It's just timing. If you're ready aimed in no pro player is going to hear you unless you are moving let alone hear you ads and pin point your exact location.
---
If ur low level play ranked for guaranteed headremoval
---
It‚Äôs all of the kills you‚Äôve ever had in ranked divided by all of the deaths you‚Äôve had in ranked, so if you‚Äôve played a lot, it doesn‚Äôt change much
---
Optional setting in the HUD section, if I'm not mistaken.
---
‚ÄúThe top 100 are smurfs‚Äù Sorry but is there another definition for a smurf that I didn‚Äôt get the memo of?
---
Jager has become one of my favorite operators and he became my main.
---
Congrats
---
It was like this before.
---
I don‚Äôt believe their number. I‚Äôll try and work backwards
---
There are ~36 weapons with black ice, so the chance of getting *any* black ice is 1/1670 times 36, which is 1/46. Epic rarity packs drop 12.5% of the time, or 1/8th. This means that if you get an epic pack, there is a 1/6th (1/46th divided by 1/8th) chance of it being any black ice? I don‚Äôt believe that, because it would mean that there are 216 (36 times 6) possible epic rarity packs to open, which there definitely aren‚Äôt. Unless Ubisoft has a more complex algorithm, which is possible except how would this article know about it...
---
My rough estimate is that 1/2 of all unique epic items are black ice, meaning that if there‚Äôs a 1/8th chance of an epic, you have 1/16th chance of black ice, and for a specific black ice (1 out of 36 possible black ice skins) it would be 1/576 chance
---
Put bullets in it
---
If you want to we can play together to show u some stuff. Im not "pro" but i know a decent thing. Add me on discord Nigel#7777
---
castle main?
---
neck?
---
Someone allways kills the first guy and then i get 4 kills :(
---
Happened to me once in like 1500 hours playtime.
---
I know that, but I'll never play capitao is my point. Instead, I'd rather have it for lesion or Humana, for example. Of course he's like 10,000, but why give me a skin for an operator I don't have? In my opinion, it's just another way for ubisoft to tempt you into paying for something that shouldn't even cost anything.
---
Holy shit, incredible work! Looks great!
---
Honestly I don't know which one he's been playing lately. He tends to bounce around. It's more trying to find aesthetics we could incorporate with the desk.
---
My highlight is when as fuze (shield/pistol) I got a 4k in a 1v4. Another time was also as fuze I got another 4k and almost got the last person but I missed the melee attack by a couple inches.
---
LGBT recruit lol
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of AA-DD in casual at all. I like to jump in a switch sides every rounds, makes each casual game feel longer than it actually is, especially for me as someone who hates attacking. If i wanted to play AA-DD, id play ranked or Unranked. The name change doesn‚Äôt do anything but it just felt unneeded.
---
They sure can bro, I wasn‚Äôt attempting to insult them. However, they‚Äôre looking for advice and don‚Äôt have the best character in the game unlocked for only 1000 renown
---
Yes but it used to be balanced before, like if there was a level 138 doc main on one team, they would also have like a level 80 and maybe a level 8, but now it's like all the sweats are on one team and all the noobs are on the other team
---
Yes at 300kb/s yeas
---
I got the same headgear on termite and it terrifies me
---
Gay recruit up in this bitch
---
All I can say is get good with the FMG. Headshots are mandatory since the gun has shit body shot DPS.
---
You‚Äôre actually insane if you think that we aren‚Äôt lucky to have more monetizations in this game. Just pay for the ops with renown if you don‚Äôt want to spend money. Outside of that, don‚Äôt be an ungrateful child who thinks you‚Äôre entitled to everything in a video game. At the end of the day Ubi is a business and they have to make profit somewhere or else the game wouldn‚Äôt even exist.
---
that‚Äôs fair, it looks great!
---
Ok thx
---
Who
---
Do you guys just record everything or is there something to record the last 10 seconds or something
---
Why Mozzie?
---
Thank you! We even figured out the best place to put a Frost mat üòÅüòÅ
---
Yeah small chance
---
I mean that's their goal really. That's why they are changing it, that's why the added unranked, that's why they spamming pro league skins and everything else. They want a more competitive fan base. They aren't super interested in purely casual interests.
---
Nice KD
---
nobody plays article 5 period, plus you cant solo it, wayy too hard.
---
Damn, if you manage to make it jump I will be amazed
---
That‚Äôs a record I don‚Äôt want lol there‚Äôs no need for it ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Odd. I play eus quite often and every is fine
---
Good old rainbow six, when all your teammates die immedietly, they fully expect you to 1v5 clutch and then shoot you for sucking...
---
Yes I had this also and the banners stayed til I reset my game
---
SprongTrap wants to Dropshot you
---
I know you‚Äôre probably sick of working on this but I feel like a Kapkan trap for backlighting behind your monitor would be icing on the cake. Fantastic job man.
---
[Here's the model if anyone else wants to try and print it, it's super easy](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3823641)
---
I really want to finish so is there any way to solo into an article 5
---
Wow how what did you make the shields out of and how!? Would be interesting if you did a YouTube video of how to make it!
---
Nice one mate :D
---
Lumber costs have a bit of variance depending on where you live, but if I didn't use plastic panels I already had for the shields and used plywood instead, I'd say $2-300 ish.
---
Smells like rush
---
Mp7 has the best ironsight

I dunno man, seems kinda gay to me

You should lmao

This is really nice! Good job!

Now that‚Äôs cool!

1st Floor Hereford.
---
There are already a lot of drones out there that can jump, but they use a different mechanism than the mystical stick that I don't get. They also don't have the mecanum wheels that r6 drones have, meaning they can't strafe.
---
no, not only is it damn near impossible but they physically wont let you try either.
---
Seriously. I'm kinda tired of the "it's console lol" comments. I get console has less precision but bad aim is just bad aim.
---
Oh well, thanks for the help anyway

Looks like LGBT propaganda

So it's free, right? /s

Bruh do you sleep in here because I'd be hella freaked out if I had springtrap painted onto my bedroom wall

Lol, the amount of fuckery involved in those things is completely above and beyond any sort of how to video. ü§£ü§£ I used some plastic signage panels I salvaged from a reset when I used to work at a big box hardware store. They could just as easily been made out of plywood. The how isn't as complicated as you'd think. I figured out how big they needed to be to fit how I wanted, then looking at some reference pictures of the shields roughly scaled the pieces to fit.
---
Try on a free weekend lots of new players (and skirt accounts) that‚Äôll probably play an article 5 chief

I'm pretty sure there's not a single crease on your brain at all mate.

eh, fair enough

Will do, thank you

That‚Äôs literally a meme edit. As an editor, I know. I agree that it‚Äôs not funny but it‚Äôs part of that whole genre. I think the earrape stuff should never be used again as it‚Äôs super annoying, but with these edits it‚Äôs all super fast paced with tons of meme sounds and overlays.

something not related to Ela, neat

He's got an LED strip to mount to the bank of his monitor once he gets home from visiting family for the holidays.üòÅ One of the things I love about his choice for theme is it allows for a lot of little touches and accessories that we can add on later. üòÅ

Looks sick my dude, Happy New Year !
---
Investing time to learn how the sound works in this game will help you more, just because you hear steps to your left doesn‚Äôt mean they are on your left. There are some good yt videos demonstrating this concept, I suggest you look into it
---
I just remember approaching that building thinking ‚Äúthey could literally shoot me from anywhere‚Äù
---
Happy new year and many aces to all of you!
---
i see that you also hold fnaf dear to your heart
---
My experience has been that if you have gold-level aim that's true.  But if you are a player with worse aim who can hold in silver/gold despite bad aim, it's really hard to climb back up.  Your strengths are devalued (because you can't trust teammates to successfully act on the intel you feed them, for instance) and the game becomes more about who can flick better (your weakness). 
---
Add in that smurfs are extremely common (on Xbox obvious smurfs were in &gt;2/3 of matches last time I was in bronze/copper), much better than everyone else and more likely to be on the other team (since you aren't one, you have only 4 possible smurfs on your team and 5 on the other team), and it requires more skill to climb out that is necessary to hold above copper/bronze.
---
can i have a pusi plis?
---
That's a lot of downvotes you got there, partner
---
Lol how so?
---
Thank you! He had the choice of either during the design process, but we both agreed that while we'd have to cheat a bit for practical reasons the new ones looked better. Plus they leave this great opportunity for adding back lighting to them later. üòÅ
---
Nah
---
your rank game finna be crazy
---
Add the trap sound and its flawless, but still better than anything I can do ü§£ great job
---
I hate that when maps get reworked their old version disappears completely like at least put it in custom or the better option is a separate playlist for just the old versions of reworked maps

What did I just watch

Take my money

Castle barricade be like: "uhm.. wheep x3"

Oh god even the flair

Cool... but what‚Äôs with the Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs decor?

It‚Äôs weird I somehow guessed it!üòÇ

I do, but i'd have to set up/load them into imgur or the like.
---
U can't play secure on ranked

I wasnt even playing when it was a thing

Sounds like a ddos but someone could prove me wrong
---
He loves how it looks, he's visiting his grandparents at the moment, so he wont get to use it for another week or so.
---
Same thing
---
Lol.

I got the most 1 min into a game then it crashed.

Meaning I didn't get the free elite skin üò≠üò≠
---
Where my challenge is at Ubisoft
---
Fastest way to get an operator is money sadly even the fastest methods of getting renown are still painfully slow. 
---
Game is as defender sided as ever imo.
---
and if you play any game that isnt R6 on it, the computer explodes.

wAs tHaT tHe BiTe oF 87?/?/

Lol

Do u remember which guns you saw it on?

*hello springtrap...*

You can buy super 90 black ice right now. It‚Äôs in a bundle for 700ish R6 credits.
---
The Lord is smurfing on us
---
Only for T Hunt my dude
---
Lmao that buck
---
XD He's had Springtrap up there since he was 8 or so.  At the time he thought it needed a bloody butcher knife or something of the sort XD
---
Now that's more like it
---
I didnt even play the game when it existed and I got the elite skin, lmao
---
Honestly I like the Theme Park rework a LOT better than Tower
---
By credits you mean renown ha ha
---
*cries in broke*
---
Your shutters/blind should be a complete castle barricade when closed
---
Good to know, thanks
---
I like the r6 in this picture more than the fnaf
---
Damn it‚Äôs easiest to get plat like a week after the season starts I did that I damn playing now is rough, just dropped down to gold 1.
---
....
---
Same :( now I'm 30 mmr off plat
---
You are truly a fun parent Im sure
---
I‚Äôm so mad I bought the 1 charm like a year ago I have 499 credits now \:(
---
It's my son's room, he has all sorts of various game themed things in there.  The fnaf is some of the older stuff.  I painted Springtrap when he was 8 or so.

What do you think prompted this post? Lol

Yeah Yacht is pretty ass
---
So basically an even worse Blackbeard?
---
The picture might be messing with the scale, it's about 4 feet wide counting the shields, the keyboard tray is something like 35" across. Which i guess isn't huge, but it's close to 50% larger than what he had.
---
Oh, so we going to 2056 now? 
---
How about no?
---
No that‚Äôs a fucking stupid idea if anything he needs a buff not a nerf
---
True but it would be imbalanced

Lol, I'd hate to see the FedEx charge to ship this thing XD plus I'm sure my son would be super salty about me selling his desk üòÇ

Yeah me too but this ending was much better

Wow very cool. Makes it look like you live in a little bandit hideout. Great job :)

I would say parent of the year. 
---
But now you are parent of the decade!
---
It's all older, I painted the Springtrap like 4-5 years ago. The smaller art pieces we picked up at various conventions around that time.
---
Haha fair. Either way, super awesome!!
---
You van't just spin angrily everytime you are are run out on!

Lol it's a nice desk!
---
what? sorry i‚Äôm a bit drunk and i have no idea what you just said, i‚Äôm on pc btw
---
That's basically his loft bed. Borderlands bandit shack theme.
---
That‚Äôs a really interesting idea, the only problem is that a lot of friends wouldn‚Äôt be able to play with most of their friends. Although it would be definitely a good way to let solo players rank up.
---
I just realized how long ago that was and how I was hyped for it before
---
High AF people coming to play some rainbow some nights...
---
Well said and true since I'm also in robotics also I've had the same idea as you before but never knew how to put into to action all I thought off was to start by looking for the insides of the drone.

thanks!

I swear I experience this shit constantly. I don't know whether its partly because I can't control recoil properly, but sometimes I land those headshots wonderfully and they barely get damaged.

Not gonna lie the stuff in the background kinda cringe but cool nonetheless

Woohoo!! Snagged the title at the close ü§£ü§£

*bloody oath, mate*
---
In the group that I tend to play with that can be an obstacle as well. I‚Äôm part of a group that really drives home the concept of playing with each other regardless of skill level when possible so I end up in stacks with one or two guys that are high level players that should be getting mid to high plat every season and the other 3 will be a rotation of guys that would normally be around mid to high gold. The result is everyone being either brought up to low plat 3 or down to right around plat 2, I‚Äôve been going through and getting placed and plat on a bunch of my accounts which has sorta boosted one of my friends to get plat 1 recently which he‚Äôs never done before so that was a cool moment to see him proud of that.
---
That is one of the main selling points of that pass asides the ops
