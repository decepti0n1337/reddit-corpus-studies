You are acting more toxic then he is. You should probably google what "toxic" means.

On one side you have these intertwining paths that have monuments to famous people of spanish decent then on the other side there’s a Ferris wheel and a templo with this crazy geometric flower garden close. It’s kinda situated right between all these universities (why I was there) so there’s a lot of young people hanging around and tourists too.
---
This is because a group of bullies has more tools to their dispossal than a single person, like being inmune to votekicking and being able to teamkill unimpeded by taking turns, and Ubisoft has not done enough work (if any) to address it. A single "hero" cant do anything, and will only get killed.
---
The verbal abuse can be tolerated and solved, but gameplay abuse is impossible to deal with.
---
Or you know you just learn to attack the sites? House is insanely easy to attack. 
---
I mean u could’ve just left the game or muted them lmfao it’s casual 
---
I remember it too, I kinda wished I could see what it would look like finished. I assume they made that the mute elite.
---
Dude I literally can't play normal Ranked anymore it is so bad. 
---
Except casual is a garbage game mode that needs fixes
---
I think the sites should still be random but I’d like to see it be shown to defenders and spawn points to attackers. Not a big deal either way though IMO. 
---

---
Btw, it’s way less than 70% of the maps that aren’t in ranked. Pretty sure it’s just yacht, house, kanal, and tower. Lol
---
Keyboard isn’t supported on Xbox. You need to buy a MnK adapter to even use MnK on Xbox, which cost a couple hundred $. Because of this third party software it confuses the console into thinking they are using a controller. So it really isn’t ubis fault 
---
0-2 when i joined
---
I tried this too
---
I think the resolution doesnt fit :(
---
This isn't ranked it's the new game mode but yes that's why I put the opt in, if you suspect something or you just really don't know you look if not you get to supporting your team.
---
Glückwunsch 
---
I cant even figure out how to get it on the screen
---
It’s a belkin model F9..... the rest I can’t read 
---
I think it depends on your tolerance towards caffeine. I feel like I’m immune to the whole stimulating feeling of caffeine because I have been drinking coffee since a young age, so if you’re susceptible to caffeine, then it can keep you focused and awake probably 
---
Yea in my opinion co-op games like outbreak are far better with friends. It’s rare nowadays to just luck into fun teammates. 
---
We all know the real shout is “Jackie moon”
---
Wasn’t one Kafe? They accidentally revealed that Kafe would be one on the last patch notes? (Idk about Kanal though)
---
The game pisses me off after I read this book
---
Lol apparently if I start r6 trough steam they dont ask any code or password soo problem solved i guess
---
Well yeah.....that's how you not be a a typical snowflake
---
She looks like she got mangled by her own frost mat lol.
---
How someone can use House as an example for a hard attack is mind blowing
---
From this perspective it feels like there's NO shield at all. A holographic shield?
---
Bro I literally can't play normal Rank anymore it is literally soul crushing. I just run into Meta abusing 5 stacks all day feels so bad. My stack could run that shit, but I just don't think the game is fun that way. 
---
What's your ping? Where are you from? How many people are on your Internet?
---
We got to see it cause of a hacker, then there was a minor controversy about it. That’s why we have the Thatcher we have now. I personally liked the change but I would’ve loved to have an the alternative one too. If Ash can have 2 Elites then so can my grandpa Thatcher.
---
I think they'd be crazy not to add Israeli ops sometime this year  
---
Most toxic game in gaming? Have you played any MOBA, Dead by Daylight, or Overwatch?
---
That's a horrible way to design a game. Many maps have remained consistently balanced throughout meta changes. It is not fun to play a broken map. 
---
Does it have qos?
---
Even more reason to leave the game 
---
They care a lot more about ash brother, it is the dream.
---
It's a comment thread from a very popular porn site.

Idk why it took so long for anyone to respond to this.  I cant imagine anyone on reddit is trying to save face....probably because all those who know are on said site now

You don't get banned in casual now. So you're point was worthless

I don’t want to watch keyboard and mouse people play against each other on lower quality, would be terrible to watch. Until they fix the problem this shouldn’t be considered.

Number 4 at best?
---
Me seeing those man hands: *excuse me, sir?*
---
Dokkaebi: ****IT'S MA'AM!****
---
You play till 4 wins. You know those rounds where whoever is attacking or whoever is defending wins, and it goes back and forth? I feel like it messes with that a little bit, I dunno.

This is not a meme, but video of what happened before the game started
---
This would probably be the best clip in the video too
---
For his research purposes ?

How did he do that?

“REINFORCING THE WALL!”
---
That was some DSi mic audio quality right there.
---
Is it gonna be locked solely to her?
---
he thought things were going differently.
---
The guy had teleporting hacks
---
No I expect it to be seasonal so every gun in the game now :) 
---
So people winning against you ruins the mode?
---
That moment when they banned Hibana and Thermite.
---
Oh, I see. Man, I hate hackers, thankfully I don’t have to deal with them anymore.
---
It's from pornhub
---
That's a weird way to draw an L85A2
---
an op who has a sniper that can shoot through reinforced walls. real slow cycle time and 60/70 damage
---
This is why I shotgun a hole the wall first where the mirror will be
---
Exactly, first to 4. You only play 3 rounds before you switch sides. It doesn't mess with anything.
---
Where's the trap. Where's the trap. Oh. There's the trap.
---
When your chasing Cav and she starts interrogating your boi then you shoot her in the face

The hunter has become the hunted
---
Wow you spawnpeeked 4 people in casual

I never got the hang of sidearm SMG recoil, I only use her machine pistol
---
Ash mains are worst kinds of people

I feel ya, not saying it’s completely unfair or unbalanced, just feels like if you are already 3-0 it’s a lot less room for error. But I also suck so there’s that!

Invitationals are ALWAYS in Siege's home- Montreal.
---
Paris majors, as always, are in Paris.
---
Seasonal finals change locations every season. last time was in Rio. Next time, will be announced later.
---
Woah that’s cool
---
Usually every season
---
Ubisoft plans to have the invitational in Montreal every year
---
It aint much, but its honest work
---
Ya lower is usually better most pros play at 400 or 800 dpi
---
Switch jackel for hibana
---
Oh ok thanks
---
I have the same set up haha
---
I once had a problem with my game crashing, I reached out to support and oh boy, I tell you what. it's like a bot not even a human, at the end I had to just figure out my shit alone. turns out downgrading my video drivers fixed the game.
---
but they said otherwise, and they even thought I couldn't run it on a laptop *which it did with a solid 60 locked fps*
---
Support is just fucked in every other way.
---
The new Hereford, is thankfully,more balanced than the abomination that was old Hereford, and definitely has more viable sites than chalet, kafe and sky, which have only 2 (hell, sky is 1, wish such a beautiful map was better designed).
---
Even if you play awhile it happens, solo queue and end up with a squad of 4, they sometimes rather kick you out than play 4v5 than play with a new player. Hope it gets better though for ya

The PDW is the best full auto long range weapon in the game. Rogue9 did a video where he tested it and the damage of the PDW actually increases from 34 to 35. Much better than the C7E on long range and its not even close. Short range tho the upper hand belongs to the C7E
---
maybe because when you TK you ruin the experience for everyone in the lobby but your friends 
---
Bring 3 friends into games with you. That way when one person is toxic you all can get rid of them or counter their toxicity with your own like pin them in a corner with shields or down them with cav and let a twitch get the kill 
---
What's on the right?
---
Hell ya
---
No, the old quick lean broke the hit box of the person leaning, crouch spamming is bad, but quick lean was just dumb

I alway think that the clockwork is a doctor who thing because.. Reason

Pretty sure get_flanked said this as well

Haven't played in months can someone explain what the road to S.I mode is?

Crouch spammers...
---
It would be cool if they added some story-type missions at the start of every year 
---
Why that laugh sound like someone trying to start there car but the engine just wont run
---
She was better before they nerfed the recoil on the bearing-9, now I think they need to up her capacity on the type-89 
---
Nice
---
2800! Get that sh*t down.
---
Go what the pros use. It's biologically, and in-game, better.
---
400 DPI, around 10-20 in-game, arm-gaming with a big mousepad.
---
ALWAYS play with higher sensitivity and use your arm. Wrist muscles aren't strong enough to handle twitches and movements. You'll suffer muscle damage in the long run. Trust me, I know.
---
My top 3 attack ops lol

Welcome to console

Oh Lord damn! Rest in peace, fellow right temple.

No probs.

---
Fam go back to school and learn to read and spell. It’s Family****
---
Nope. Jackal's PDW do not have damage drop-off. You can check Rogue9 spread sheet.
---
Yea I know That, but it really on is a issue in higher ranks and even then a simple 0.5second turn around isn't that big of a issue especially when you have someone covering you 
---
Just be buck. 
---
I know I’d rather be maverick though
---
I know this sounds stupid but I simply can’t control twitches f2, I am perfectly fine with every other gun even the smg-11. Anyone know some good attachments and tips?

&gt;no intention of being a trap

I see what you did there.
---
That is some Soviet shit

he first called then went into camera for random sake because there wasnt any drones around so... that type of randomness where you look at the wall for 2 seconds and then shoot isn't really random

Yep, it's as surprising as it sounds. I used to set it to high because somebody told me it would steal me 10-15 fps, but once the mouse stutters started, I read another post where siege being even at normal, let alone high, interferes with Windows's own processes so when windows does it's thing, siege stutters. Putting it at low allows siege to function without interfering with Windows.
---
Of course, it doesn't work for everybody, but it is ONE of your go to solutions to solve stutters and input lag.
---
Jäger is bae...
---
Imo, they need to fix the shield sync inconsistencies before they nerf or buff anything. Whenever I play him it's like a 50/50 if I become invincible in the round or die cause on server-side I'm facing to the right.
---
Does it matter if my monitor is kinda shitty? Like the FPS is so high it can't handle it?
---
Haven’t read the book, what are their abilities?

Means you need to either put vsync on, or go to Nvidia inspector and put fast sync on. And cap fps at just above your refresh rate. Fast sync reduces screen tearing and is specifically for when games pump out fps much higher than your refresh rate. Vsync also works, but vsync has latency. FastSync has lesser latency.
---
Also, pump up your graphics. In an idea scenario, you'd want to be using as much of your gpu as possible, and you shouldn't be bottlenecking. Turn graphics at high, TAA off. That's what I run. Still get 90 fps, and vsync has reduced my fps drops.
---
Orange may be kinda cool looking.

I use Plantronic 400 HX headphones if thats what you're asking.

To be completely honest haven’t looked at the rules lol

Many other players created similar posts like this, not knowing about the window.

Yet I see no glass pieces lying on the window frame.

Overwatch has some sweats but at least they can't TK, at least they can't run a 3-4 stack and surrender their way down to copper and shit talk anyone who  tries to convince them to actually play the game

Is this the elite skin for the recruit?
---
I rub it all the time but with both wall reinforced and a more on it, you can throw a nitro over into projector stairs is legit af 
---
Yeah bro! I remember , once in a ranked game I played with a group of people who neither opened their mouths nor typed anything let me face a 1v5 situation, I went down bringing it to a 1v1, my team did not even say a nt. Which was the least they could do. Opposite team took me with them next match lmao.

R6 is probably the most toxic console game I’ve ever played. I’ve never been called a n*gger in the 1000 hours I have in battelfield nor the 400 hours I have in CS.

he's saying that every Ubi game has a reference to other ubi games

Problem is teleporting hackers now no longer care about collision boxes and they make their models invisible, so even if they did TP in front of you, you wouldn't know until they shot you.
---
Same happened here
---
Reminds me of something that happened on the same map, I was Monty in a very long standoff against Frost, ended up agreeing to a melee battle, no shield for me
---
Frost won 
---
It would most likely force recruit 
---
r/ContagiousLaughter 
---
It might be a reference to Cav or Jackle. Cause the only thing at that spot is high grass that cav could blend into or a dirt party that will leave footprints behind. Now it could have something to do with the Christi de la casa de Campo. A place of worship to Christ. The Tu Padre May be in reference to that.
---
Honestly i feel the f2 is a bit overhyped these days. Don’t get me wrong, having the highest fire rate of any rifle is good and makes it a headshot machine, but the damage honestly sucks now. The only defender armor type it’s very good at killing is 3 speeds and 2 speeds with rook plates. In all others it actually one of the worse rifles in terms of ttk. It’s definitely still good, but i would argue that the ak12 and c7e are better nowadays with the r4c being about equal.
---
Can't ban Recruit.
---
In the prep phase i think so. I saw some vid from microwave. It wont work. 
---
Red orange purple. Any of those 
---
Smite on XBox is pretty bad, but that’s par for the course for a MOBA
---
Starter Edition gets 3 attackers and 3 defenders randomly to begin with. So you'll always have ONE operator available at least.
---
Its so annoying when people say "just shoot his legs". Its like saying "when you see blackbeard just shoot his body"
---
Sometimes its not that easy...
---
Weird seeing such reaction, sonce I don't play her that much. I'd take Thermite or, let's say, Thatcher over her any day.
---
There ya go, i edited it
---
Then I’ll be Glaz 
---
To elaborate it’s 
---
The relative skill levels of the players/teams in the game.
---
Whether or not your team won the game.
---
 
---
In addition, if there's a large skill difference between the two teams and the outcome of the game is what the system expects, the skill adjustment after the game will be minimal (if a bronze team loses to a gold team, it's unsurprising and the skill levels won't change much -- now if the bronze team wins, that's a whole different story).
---
Also the more ranked games you’ve actually played the less elo points you will gain or lose 
---
And then blow up killing you, which is the equivalent of getting shit on
---
Please don't repost something thats been here so recently like 100 times
---
Man I haven’t played for a little over a month and now we can ban operators?!
---

As a Canadian I feel obligated to inform you it is best to NOT play with the yellow snow

---
What muzzle attachment do you pair with the angles grip for the Type 89?
---
One shotgun does lol
---
That's a lot of context. Lol I glanced at the bottom screen and without paying attention assumed it was a TCSG-12 (which still doesn't make since.) My bad. Lol
---
I was just sitting here wondering what would happen, maybe a nitro? Or a random 1 tap continued by t-bagging? NOPE man gets SMACKED through window. Absolutely fantastic I like this and take my upvote
---
Well the ak12 is out classed by the lmg and shield on fuze just like how the spear 308 is on finka. The lmg and shield combo way better with fuzes gadget. Just like with finka the assault rifle is good if you're going at the long range with the acog but not finka boosted. Fuze is more or less a close range op so the best option is primary that preform best suites his role
---
Also I said this in a comment I made but I've been playing ash for si recently and as a bb main i can tell you his mk15 is equally good as the r4 in it's own since. Due to its low fire rate it has about the same recoil pattern as the r4 going full auto but it's much higher damage puts it in the same place as the r6. I've been killing people just as fast with the r4 as I do with bb with ether of his primaries
---
OwO Kaid shotDMR ftw!

He sensed the fooking later soights

honestly, if you zoom in a ton and compare the 3 at the start of the coordinate, it's definitely a 3

just sayin ubi.... if you can get goddamn predator on Ghost Recon....... you'd make me a very happy man
---
No way, monetary cosmetics in games are a way that developers have continue to supoort their game years after launch and initial sales. these are important, i personally bought 100dollars worth of the r6 points just to support the game. Cosmetics are a nice little bonus for the supporters like me. Already spent most of it. Ill likey buy more in the future
---
Not with 7 maps bro
---
r/expectedthanos
---
What’s with the breadstick part ? And maybe the issue is that your style of play doesn’t mesh well with the rest of the team and because you play differently than your friends they view you as less skilled because in their perspective your style of play isn’t what they view as how a “good player” should play like
---
Didn’t think silent step affected damage of the pistol
---
Well it was in a thread on reddit so it must be!
---
Gotta get my daily flex in. It's a good mistake to make though, because it clears up a lot of the stuff. I probably should have done a better cropping job, so mostly my fault. It's a good thing that I recorded that even though I was a dogshit player back then
---
That and it's a mid to long range gun and fuze is a close range op. If it was on someone else it may be better then the famas since the famas performs best in close quarters but because it's on fuze the famas wins 
---

No offense but all these recruit posts I’ve been seeing lately are just dumb , the dude was always ment to be a filler op and now he’s not even assigned to you if you’re afk . 
---
It should be way more than 100k if it is made available with renown. If (diamond skin) which is just a skin only which is (epic) in rarity costs 100k renown, how can an elite set which gives you a completely different look for your operator, mvp victory animation, new operator selection menu screen, elite gadget skin, elite chibi charm, elite weapon skins for all gun's available for that operator should be 100k renown? Mind you all these items in elite sets are also (legendary) in rarity. If it should be made available with renown it should costs 100,000,000 renown (imo).
---
Love Bandits iron sights and that's a cool gun but unfortunately the recoil is unbearable on console 
---
Yeah it’s definitely not, but who knows who actually created it?
---
Ever thought of making the switch to pc so you have a more fair experience?
---
i've always found memories and their attachments to who you are super fascinating, and the complicated situation of Season 2 was a fuckin treat. Not to mention the second I heard Would? as their trailer song i was happy but also a bit tilted they didn't use Rooster by AIC as that was perfecttttttttt for both Frank and Billy........and then I finished Season 2 and i was the happiest camper I will not lie.

Dont wanna be a trap operator I guess

One time I got banned for 30mins for saying “whore” in all chat. I’ve since disabled PC chat

I play ash a lot but I'd never react this way. There are plenty of other fun entry draggers but Imo it's more of a waste to ban ash. There's plenty of other attackers that are far worse than her when it comes to gadget or gun. 
---
You must live a sad life.
---
there's no way you win this is it was on pc
---
Not really 
---
I play on PC about 30% of the time, but majority of my friends play console so I’d much rather be playing with them 
---
This is what I'm saying since people want the PL rules for ranked. Ranked should just copy the PL rules but casual should die example have killcams (because you can learn from them) and the sides should switch after 3 instead of 6 rounds.
---
Fuck no. Fuze ak12
---
I was watching Dragon Ball Super, i'm not annoyed that i lost by any means, just mad that they are abusing the system to get free wins off people
---
Yep, can think of a single instance in all my playtime that I encountered a hacker, and even then, it just looked like he was walling, but nothing really conclusive. It only happened twice in the game where it seemed suspicious, and only once to me.
---
Whaaaaat? What are you on about? Wrestling is totally realistic! Like, have you see those classy holds? Can't get more real than that.
---
Yeah, we knew something was up. The guy that couldn't connect even said it wasn't a internet problem
---
That's just a signed integer overflow.  If it's a 16-bit integer counting milliseconds then that's pretty normal lag for the People I've played with.

you know this is true, hes a professor

I'll die to a cheater once every 300-400 matches, but at least I don't have to play the game with a gamepad, at variable framerate, at lower resolution, at lower graphic settings, without anything to do in between rounds (alt-tab to reddit anyone?), and many other shitty things that might be acceptable to some but are definitely not acceptable to me.
---
If it’s a shotgun there’s no headshot multiplier

what if I told you Im bisexual lmao 
---
Big deal.
---
Such a great strat, isn't it?

Smh.

I'd bet my blitz-finka-ash-buck-ying rush would trump that anyday, but you go on with your "liability-rush".

Seriously do you think they might think of implementing this would be cool

i can taste these

It's amazing to me that kids don't mind hoping on adult games and being a nuisance. I remember some kid trying to tell me that I must be an unemployed loser because I'm playing video games which was siege at the time. It isn't very hard to get 4/4 votes to get them removed from the game though lol

There are qualifiers held. Open qualifiers where anybody can compete. If you win, you to ahead. Else, nope.
---
I agree
---
That sounded like fun and is also just tomato there is no e at the end
---
Sounds like big G with extra steps to me.

Let's make this happen

This is almost strictly for cas. If someone is running recruit on ranked then that’s a separate issue all together

If you don't like recruit you're automatically toxic and an asshole that doesn't know how to have a bit of fun.

Did anybody see the Alibi operator icon?
---
Well that’s not very sporting of them is it?
---
I haven't played in about a month. Is this a feature in ranked now?
---
Casual should stay as casual, quicker games and no banning, don't want a "competitve" scene in casual mode 
---
You make a good point about weapons having multiple variants. We already have three kinds of MP5s, two types of USPs, a plethora of M4/AR-15 style assault rifles, etc. in the game. The MTAR you mentioned also has a 9mm version in real life, so it also makes sense to have that as an SMG rather than an AR if Ubisoft wants to.
---
That being said, at this point I don't think Ubisoft will be sticking with 100% country-specific-and-authentic loadouts moving forward. For example, take note that virtually none of the weapons used by Jackal and Mira are currently used by the GEO in real life, except for the USP 40. Ying and Lesion are also equipped with Chinese weapons (barring the SIX12), which is incredibly unusual for the Hong Kong SDU, who mostly use Western gear. Even the latest Operators, Kaid and Nomad, have odd guns in their arsenal like the AutoMag and the ARX200.
---
My point is, assuming that the Israeli Ops will come (let's not talk about the *if* for now, that's a whole other can of worms), I think it is also fair to expect that they'll bring guns *not* normally associated with the present-day IDF or the Israeli Police. I mean, rather than the ACE or the MTAR, maybe we will see the debut of the Ruger 10/22, the Armsel Striker, or hell even the 'ol M16A2. We can have a field day speculating what variants they will be. :)
---
Just sharing my two cents. 
---
I’m not crying, I’m just fed up with the bs. You’re probably contributing to the problem.
---
I have the exact same and it looks so good! Way better than the elite version.

If I could do it consistently.

---
oh yeah for sure but the no sights thing on hibana is really common, so thought it might be glitched 
---
Not an echo main if your thinking he needs a nerf. 
---
A group of guys who play that aren’t a bunch of 16 year olds? Wish I could find that on Xbox geez
---
that’s pretty much how i play ying every time lol
---
I did it a few times but from ranked but most of the time I decided to restart the game or my pc (mostly because im having that shitty sound gltich pretty often) then I'll have time to rejoin and I had the chance to do something while having the glitch... 
---
what about Buck AR?
---
When i run that setup in casual everyone just sees me immediately and flicks to my head in like half a second and when i turn off the window at least for a second the enemy peeks from window and easily kills me
---
Yeah I think its going to be 2 new maps and 2 reworks. We got too many maps now anyways. 
---
I'm 99% certain I'm the last one you kill in this clip. Was your last kill an echo? And on round 4, did the whole other team go riot shields?
---
it looks like the her hitbox clipped though the wall with her arm and you hit that
---
That would just mean I’m a self aware echo main.
---
All correct lmao
---
Is.. Is that legal? 
---
Your friend’s account definitely got hacked.
---
What i dont like about these sights is that they are very dark at night or in dark places and u can barely see them
---
Maybe thermite’s as well?
---
People sleeping on the L85 smh, that thing has no recoil. The best guns in the game don't even need a high DPS, they just need a high rate of fire and low recoil, that's why the smg-11 was the most op gun in the game before it's recoil was nerfed to oblivion. That's why to nerf the C7E they upped the horizontal recoil. Though my list would probably be L85A2, AK-12, F2 and C7E at the very, very top.
---
AK12 is great. Fuze being a 3 armor is only reason no one appreciates it. If Finka had it, shed be the most picked operator in the game hands down. 
---
Why don't they just put this as the new splash art and release a new character model cuz god damn the one right now does no justice for what this upgrade looks like..
---

---
Zophia and hibbana have good wepons. 
---
Didnt twitch's weapon got a re-work making it less effective? Or is it just me? 
---
thanks my guy 😊
---
Fuze's AK12 is the best gun in the game.
---
They're literally moving in the clip. Look at where the guy on the left died. If they all sprint forward in a straight line that's not his fault. I've played against diamonds who do this spawn peek. You get plenty enough time to react to it.
---
R6 has this just not in third person 
---
RemindMe! 5 hours
---
The operators I chose were 
---
\- Buck for Atk (His skeleton-key attatchment is good at removing barriers and trapdoors, as well as a normal shotgun)
---
\- Valkyrie for Def (Her cameras work well, as sentries around the target, protecting your team from threats)
---
\- Caveira for Def (She's just alright, in my opinion, as I'm not really one to sneak around the map, and hunt the enemy, but that's just me)
---
\- Hibana for Atk (Her X-KAIROS are good for removing barriers, but are pretty much the same as Ash's or Thermite's gadgets)
---
I hope that this helps.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On PC, maybe. But on PS4 there is no such thing as hackers on Rainbow, if you call someone a hacker you're just desperate
---
Have Fun with the tunnel vision of your acog while the Russian acog is so much better for recoil and there is no tunnel vision 
---
OC the GPU if you havent already
---
yes he can
---
Nice spot :D
---
Polen is son scheiß land 😂😂😂😂
---
Attack special ability: Phone buzzing like Dokkaebi - but by texting for bob and vegan for the entire match.
---
Defense special ability: Designated shitting spawns - defecate in the open near the attacker spawn so they slip when they rush.
---
Use 85% render scale , should help a ton.  BTW, the hardware that’s available currently will do much better, there’s never much sense in waiting for parts that are far more than a few weeks away. 
---
Happened to me as well.
---
Reinstallation helped.
---
Fuck you and your cheese spawn peek
---
I agree that mnk is shit. But if you play on the toxic xbox community. ESPECIALLY on australian servers, it is filled with toxicity from ddosing to mnk to just being a dickhead. Trust me. You would change your mind about me buying mnk. I want to have fun and sweat too. But i cant even play if an ash main using mnk fast peeks me around a corner before i even know shes there. Its pisses me of. However, this discusion has changed from ubisoft neglecting console to how shit mnk is.
---
I don't have any problems with discord, all fine for me
---
Was you Sledge? xD
---
What a dumb question, of course not.
---
Will try later. Always thought if it like the smg from halo,when coupled with the silencer. 
---
Loosen your grip, invest in triggers and paddles, maybe sticks too. 
---
If you want r6 to be made accessible for 9 year olds with aim-assists etc. sure
---
Don't forget to ask for no laser sights 
---
Why?
---
I prefer Jackals PDW and the HK-17. Anyone else? 
---
Time to mess around with TAA.
---
Graphics at high, turn off all post processing bullsh*t (zoom, lense flare, ambient bla bla bla), shadows af highest, LOD at medium/low, reflection medium, and change TAA between 70 and 80, sharpness between 80 and 100.
---
Taa reduction gives you a massive bump in fps. If 70 doesn't work, 65, then 60.
---
Why ban one of the most useless operators in the game?
---
I can't hold the ps4 controller to use L2 and R2 for shooting I use accessibility to use L1 R1 for aiming and shooting because it doesn't hurt my hands cuz my hands are kind of big.
---
Its really annoying that we only get one size for the ps4 controller.

---
If you had read the recent patch notes before making this post, you'll realise that the shotgun recoil is being fixed and released on Feb 5th odd.
---
Everything on console is different. Your recoil is lesser than PC.
---
Ubi knows console has the largest playerbase in siege. They said that. That aren't neglecting it.
---
And if you are saving up to cheat on a platform that is supposed to be for controllers, then you are in no position to talk about being neglected. The moment you plug that MnK into your console, you are a cheater, as officially declared by ubi, and you are of no relevance to the community.

Yes you must have the OPs unlocked

---
 Check your add on content section. 
---
It would be super dope if we could have a "part painter" in this game, sort of like Wildlands. That way we could show all the people asking for a black holo that hot pink holo is where it's at.
---
Pretty sure implementing something like that into good old R6S spaghetti code would be near impossible, but it's fun to imagine.
---

I joined the game right after parabellum, so yeah
---
Just for cosmetics? Meh
---
And take the time to choose your most used attachments on every weapon you usually pick for each op before starting a game. That way you only have to change 1 (or 2) accessories during selection phase... And when you're dead you can still be useful to your team by giving them info you can gather that they don't pay attention to
---
Been playing since Beta and I would absolutely love this. Would bring back some good/bad nostalgia :)
---
I’m agree
---
So do you walk blindly on it or purposefully walk around it?
---
when it comes to spawnpeeks, rook and doc are nearly the same, it's more of the fast movement between the map while scoping through hallways that was fun in my opinion
---
Sry he is invisible to my phone... Vigil problems... 
---
That was me. And that's how I usually react when something makes me lose it, lol 
---
I think it's a pretty ok idea tbh, there isn't really a reason NOT to have it, which the other guy that commented doesn't seem to care about. Not a massive benefit, just a quality of life sorta thing
---
[deleted]
---
Reason not to have it: people will be in that menu instead of cams. Seems like a fair point to me
---
What about castle?
---
both.
---
Alot of people like to change their strategies in matches and the window of opportunity to choose your attachments is too small
---
This doesn't really fall under the meme category though...
---
True I'm just saying ash is really good and very annoying too
---
Lmao thanks.
---
90% of the time i solo queue, no one pays attention to me tagging enemies. And im pretty sure it isnt just me either
---
Play with 16 years olds regularly, can confirm. I just happened upon the less toxic ones.
---
There’s a 12 year old in our discord and we all love chatting shit with each other it’s great
---
Pretty sure it was a joke because that’s Dutch from red dead redemption 
---
you can stop worrying about grenades now
---
The PDW blows it away 
---
That gun is great with angled and 4x aswell
---
I can't prove lack of something. Also, I can't remember it ever happening to me, but it might be because I literally don't care. I play to win, not to get kills.
---
Why is she banned?
---
I didn’t say when I’ll be back 
---
Nothing as fun as spawning and dieing before the time counter even ticked down 1 second.
---
Basically by that logic every intel operator is a crutch ain’t it. 
---
Bank in a nutshell 
---
&gt; the window of opportunity to choose your attachments is too small
---
No, the time it takes to change attachments is just too high. If it didn't take a few seconds to load for each slot or would just be all on one window, it wouldn't be an issue. Or even have loadout presets you can set up as needed.
---
Next time, wait until the person has left the restroom. Don’t pee on your gun! 
---
Jokes aside, that looks good. How’d you do it?
---
 **"They said it could not be done. They said it was designed for tanks. They said I could not make it smaller and more accurate. They were wrong."** 
---
Also when the first time you’re trying a new operator 
---
Yep
---
Statistics are one thing.But people are sleeping on Mavs M4. I love its sound,so unique and very manageable recoil , feels just right for me. I find it very similar to Jaeger 416-C. Definitely give it a try, M4 after some practice feels like a beast.
---
Right
---
You can prefire headshot Ash before she turns the corner
---
_using Tachanka_

Wow omg did you find this omg so cool!! I never seen dis be4re!!

Apparently this sub thinks so

i mean there Xbox players.
---
Then u clearly hadnt found the right person yet.
---
When I have not played the game for a while, I play him a lot because I don't need muscle memory to control its recoil

Ash, Hibana, Thermite in my personal opinion.

Next summer, im planning on flying to france to meet 2 budies. I live in norway and we will be 16 at that time
---
Oh sorry
---
No, you are toxic since the twelves, or whenever puberty starts hitting, making you sweaty competitive, salty and toxic, or when you start imitating other older toxic people. Then you mature and "it's just a game" TM becomes relevant. 
---
4:3? does it work good for you?
---
Lets face it, it looks like someone frozen his piss.
---
&gt;it sure brings on a mature conversation.
---
&gt;but at least I don't have to play the game with a gamepad, at variable framerate, at lower resolution, at lower graphic settings.
---
Very "mature" conversation. A mature conversation is accepting the wrongs/right of the opposing subject but i don't think you have this.
---
It’s like the boys I mess around on siege with, 3 of the 4 I play with went school with me and we’re all good mates and then our 5th is from Manchester but might be applying for the uni where we are which would be so cool
---
The pdw also has weird ass damage at range. It actually gains 1 damage at range and is the best full auto weapon at range ttk wise.
---
I feel you , for some reason even if i don’t play the game for weeks when i use jager i dominate with his rifle
---
No
---
The guy without a sign is how N0thing will look in 10 years.
---
My man was just taking a fat dump in the corner.
---
What...? This is based off statistics like Time to Kill, damage, and recoil management. Higher recoil does not correlate to damage what so ever.
---
But if that's the case then *Bucks gun* must be the strongest in your book :P
---
I diagnose you with the BIG HAPPY

Yeah but the recoil pattern is a circle not all of the recoil is vertical 
---
[This is from para bellum so a few values have changed since, but it still shows the ridiculous ttk on the c75](https://i.redd.it/hp0jyb3idgf11.jpg)
---
got any video? 
---
C75 was never broken, and isn't. It has iron sights that hit you in your nose.
---
Balanced enough.
---
I see you forgot about IQ.
---
Ive said this so many times and i will say it again. Its Optional. whether you chose to use it is up to you. Whether your team chooses to use it is up to them. And anyone who isnt trolling wont spend all round in the operator menu. Also another thing ive said multiple times, you can return to cams at any point in time so you can still assist your team after changes have been made
---
Thanks, your post added a lot of value to the thread. 
---
Fact is Lion is broken, plain and simple, traps and mute don’t counter him effectively, traps don’t counter him at all and all this for an op who plays red light green light with the entire enemy team with no process, he can win a round with one button. He presses a button and influences the round instantly. It’s like having an Overwatch character in Siege. It doesn’t work at all.
---
That's really cool 
---
Get it, but it looks like when a gun is strong/good nowadays everyone wants to get it nerfed. I find that bullshit... 
---
Mate, You have never played ban and spawned in front have you? THERE IS NO WAY TO PREFIRE. You're dead before you can even aim down your sights. This is not about normal spawnpeeking, this is about the defenders literally seeing you spawn.
---
A Bartlett rework would be great and it wont need much rework too. Just add more door entrance on the first floor, remove some windows and add more entry on the second floor. I agree with Tower but also remove Yacht and Favela. 
---
........while you get rekt by a Finka boosted blitz and Ash rushing at you as you are jackal tracked.
---
Hey we share a birthday! Me, you, and Justin Bieber got it right
---
A one button press op that benefits the entire team, no risk reward whatsoever. Yeah no wonder people don't like that dynamic. 
---
Why? I was genuinely asking, I want to know if he is new to the game! So asking a simple question in this subreddit now will get you s downvoted to hell Wtf is wrong with this subreddit! 
---
While Fuze is slow, that 3 armour can make a difference in a gunfight, especially against the lower damage of the SMGs. He has one of the best guns, with a clearer ACOG and can tank the most bullets. 
---
I mean even when I play with people in Germany or other European countries they have a pretty good understanding of English 
---
I never said it wasn't fun, or that people can't play for fun. I said it wasn't competitive.
---
Ya'll need a 5th?
---
They won't. Pros have agreed. Once pros agree, they don't change. The whole reason for the rework were the pros' complaints.
---
And unfortunately, Ubi doesn't read this sub unless it's AMA, and they don't TAKE ideas during ama, they only answer questions during ama.
---
I am actually playing with a fetus right now and he is plat 2.
---
It's a cool idea but it'd more than likely just breed even more toxicity and discrimination of people based on their spoken language.
---
It should be a good gun considering the difficulty of use, but the best gun in the game for fragging on top of two characters with some of the best fragging utilities in the game? 
---
Even if the damage values were changed to put it more in line with guns like jackal's c7e, it would still be an exceptional gun. 
---
I never liked Favela, but it is a fairly balanced map based on the stats. I would be totally fine with removing them once we get another new map or 2. Again, they aren’t in ranked, so they only come in to play for those who play casual a lot. 
---
I'm closing with this: I have no problem with lion but also will have no problem when they remove or nerf him since his gadget is inconsistent with the rest of the game. I would like ubisoft to keep siege realistic and less futuristic. 
---
Have a strong feeling it'll just be "destroy defenders gadgets" this time. Then kills and headshots. 
---
(Hopefully I'm wrong.)
---
That's just this pic, genius. English isn't the universal language. Nobody is obligated to learn English.

It's fine on PC, do you play on console?

can't be taking them long breaks and expect not to get thrashed on, shit I take my breaks and when I come back it always takes me a few days to get back on track.

just gotta be consistently playing, if you rage and quit, stop playing for the day and come back the next day or 2 days after, but not too long like a week+

The title isn’t meant to be taken super serious, it not like the guy said he has no hands and plays with his legs.

It could maybe do with some more recoil, because it literally has none at the moment. But only if they make it so the ironsights aren't really fat.

---
Havent tested this out on my homescreen yet tho 
---
The only way to implement this feature would be, to ask the player what langueses he speaks. So if you want to prevent rasism you could still only select english. However I would allways recommend to just mute toxic player.

wtf is that recording my guy
---
Yeah, you'd quickly see how this is a bad idea if you've ever been matched into a game with some poles and russians on the same team(that make it known they are polish/russian).
---
nah, it's just a mock-up I did in GIMP
---
I agree, it should also be able patch up hibana charges as well. Thermite would still be viable as the explosion would be too big.
---
Something similar to the foam gun in Prey.
---
1. Most but not all.
---
2. Sometimes you are in a lobby where your language ist the 1. language of the whole team, so using this would make more sense.
---
Damn, no wonder i haven’t heard anything from it even from my friends that used to play it non stop... it was never really released right? 
---
This would be a great idea. It would also help defend that room on theme park with 3 or 4 drone holes
---
That wheezing laugh got me lmaooo
---
What?
---
It‘s these kind of people who don’t get that the game has to be balanced around the highest level of play. It is okay to be a bad player, but think before you post...
---
but the people that want to for example find German friends will still get the hate if they do it, not saying it's a trash idea it just brings easy toxicity
---
how smoke survived that first shot ???

ive seen that so meny times ur not special

I use a Photoshop alternative called GIMP that's free and just slightly harder to use and I learned this by just watching tutorials.

He’s still bitter about getting team killed that one time when everyone but him went recruit

A fun story about Lion from G2 they were practicing for an event when Fabians monitor went dark so the event admins took away the monitor to bring another one while the game was going and he was Lion so his teammates decided that while he gets a new monitor they will play 4v5 and told him to push 4 when they say. They've won the round with one Lion charged used to take map control and one to cover the plant/push on site. Now name another operator with who you can heavily influence the round even if you let's say don't have a monitor. Also Lion isn't very strong in soloQ but with a coordinated at least 3 stack he can almost break the game by itself.

okay that is legit bad.
---
*What the fuck am I looking at*
---
It [looks great](https://streamable.com/gpx55) in *Wildlands*, but that's just because of the third person perspective. *Siege* already has [similar animations](https://youtu.be/EvtGAz2Eclo?t=4), but it's not really obvious because you can't see it in first person.
---
The briefcase was closed IIRC
---
I take t you get spawn killed a lot 
---
Nope
---
It all comes to personal preference. Cav is pretty good as she has some good deep roaming potential. Frost is a great anchor but is also great with lurking/roaming. Both have a nice shotty or a low fire rate smg. Just comes down to your playstyle really 
---
Can't agree more.. but it's hard to find people to play with that speak same language hah.. but the biggest problem is that people don't see siege as tactical game but more rush and kill as many as possible.. 
---
thanks my dude. i’m planning on putting out some more similar content so if u want u can check out my YT. i think the link is in this thread somewhere

Exactly. Blitz punishes people out of position. If you are ready/have a good angle it’s over for blitz. 
---
I dont play him all that much but when I do your right, I should follow instead of scanning right off the bat.  good tip I'll give it a try!
---
Exactly 
---
we lost the game but I was happy I got these two kills. u/thesussyboi says it right, I did well that round but not necessarily the entire match. I just thought this community would welcome a cool kill. I wasn't trying to be fake.
---
I want the old ones back too. I was so vlose yo getting the ones with Dokkaebi and Vigil but then they disappeared and i was a little upset
---
Shoot their heads lul -ubi 2018

i wish, we lost the game :(
---
Looks great! Can wait to see more!
---
Thank,but already have Lesion
---
If that happened to me I’d immediately leave, fuck that

Is it just me or does the guy on the way right look like Ben Shapiro?

I don't think so. I'm always among the first to load into a game. Courtesy of  my Samsung 850 Evo.

I'm gonna blame this one on Ubisoft :p
---
You should censor your email address when posting it anywhere, people can abuse it
---
&gt;I'm no 140fps masterrace, I think that 144hz monitors are very gentle on the eye
---
You didnt specify on your first comment if you're a fps or a hz guy.
---
&gt;Most big TVs also have a huge added layer of input lag, resulting in an added up pile of delay which can easily make a good looking game feel like shit.
---
Most TV's like mine has reduced input lag like samsung's Game mode, Yes it doesn't compare to Monitors 144hz, 1milisec input lag, syncs. But its not noticable well for me, maybe if i look closely i will see it bit i mean it still playable. Also Tv nowadays can handle 60hz.... dunno if any tv has 144hz. Im a casual "gamer" so competitive gameplay  doenst matter to me.
---
&gt;The Razer Blade sure is a good laptop, but it's a zero compared to a self-assembled desktop PC with HALF THE PRICE of what you payed for your laptop
---
Blade's price $1,800 can you build a PC thats $900 thats better than the ONE X? I like to see that.
---
&gt; Blade is known to be a product with an awful price-performance ratio because it's meant to be a no-compromise portable device, which in the end still isn't comparable to a desktop PC, not even close. That doesn't however make it a bad product, just not good for the price.
---
I dont disagree with this one, im guilty im a razer "fanboi" i use it for Editing videos and a lil bit of gaming mainly League of legends and Csgo. I bought it because of portability and fanboi myself cant bring a PC to school dont i?.
---
&gt;sounds like you are a spoiled kid who wants shiny products without having to think too much about what's inside them.
---
This i totally disagree with you my parents only gave me $3000 after i left home for college they told me not to asked for tuition. I major in engineering (Mechanical) i make a living by buying and selling shoes, you might have heard of that. In anycase you dont know what i have been through to gain this "wealth" i wanted this because as a child i have no say on my Wants only my Needs.
---
&gt;To sum it up, YES, consoles do have the advantage of ease of use AND a relatively low entry level cost. But that is about it.
---
Thats the only thing i wanted to hear since your first comment on my thread. Both are different some have advantages to one another but doesn't mean one is superior 
---
Im happy with my single monitor razer laptop and my oneX in my small apt. Idc for building a beastly battlestation. Lets do the math here TV at least $800 OneX $500 RBlade $1,8000 monitor samsung $150ish total of $3,250 yes maybe i may have a "beastly" battlestation but i dont need that in terms of what i do im still in college a laptop is a "need" for me.
---
IIRC meaning and briefcase closed ?
---
Low recoil.
---
There is no reason why there shouldn't be a punish/forgive system. Ubi is just being lazy
---
I was shooting a drone in close range with my pistol where my teammate ran into the aim.
---
Just stating that this isn’t a global issue for the game and it only really affects 1 region

Thanks!

Best decision they made was removing the ACOG off bandit and Jäger. Absolutely no need for them back ever 
---
My squad in real life would be interesting to see, I'm 16, one of us is 18, another is 20, a 22 year old, and a 25 year old
---
This sounds like you're one of the people that thinks atheists shouldn't  say oh my god.
---
As much as I would love for a flamethrower the problem is balancing one as it would be to powerful or useless so I think the closest we will get is a dragons breath shotgun or incendiary grenades 
---
I agree and they do (a rep mentioned balancing is based on diamond pc players) however remember ubisoft is a publicly traded company who answers to shareholders. Now the entire esports industry is worth something in the neighborhood of 1 billion and siege alone generated 440 million last year (fortnite 1.4 billion more than entire esport industry combine). So esports is a good marketing tool along with streamers and a certain amount of changes should appeal to this segment. However of the overall 40 million generating that 440 million (assuming the ratio of purchases from each platform are the same) 330 million come from console users who are not “hardcore.” Its probably a fine line they are treading between the two. 
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Can't say I personally get spawn killed a lot but I frequently have friends being spawn killed and team mates but my team mates and I tend to kill the spawn peakers because we're prepared for it. As shown in this video though there is no direct way to counter this specific spawn kill so it's a bit more of an issue worth talking about than normal spawn kills. 
---
That comment gave me eye cancer

Except monty is good, and clash can be good when used correctly. But using that same logic, do we remove Tachanka just because he's used when the team is winning or losing really bad and it's futile?
---
With you 100%. Siege isn't fornite and siege is not balanced when it comes to fairness. :(
---
DAFUQ
---
Yes it has always been a thing 
---
Jackal. He’s really useful for the team. 
---
Yeah, the missions kinda succ
---
“Are you like” has a rude context 
---
recently, he was benched since Ferral wants to play a match. Fortunately, he was only benched for a game only. So, there's no need to be panicking. 
---
Hackers... Reported
---
Best gun in game imo 
---
It sounds weird but an 1v4 is easier than an 1v1 because if it’s an1v4 everyone goes for the kill but in 1v1 they play less aggressively 
---
Dude imagine a telltale Rainbow 6. I wonder if that'd be good
---
Maybe once or twice a month. Recently it stopped doing it as often, though.
---
He was benched for a day only....
---
I love the Smoke gassing himself in the other room
---
That's right, it's death on sight
---
Depends on what you like to play. Jackal is pretty beneficial to any team and can give very solid call outs, but Zofia is an amazing operator too. 
---
Lol cav just stood there reconsidering her life choices

Managed to complete 3 daily missions in one game +booster +season pass lol
---
You breach here often ?
---
This idea is stupid and would never work in practice.
---
I thought at first that the first kill was the one tap and I thought to myself, what the hell, that ain't no one tap. I got my keyboard ready.
---
I know this was just shitposting but I recently found out that reaction time peaks at the age of 24, so bring it fetus. 
---
!Remind me 24 hours
---
You made it sound like he got benched permanently... Which he obviously didn't.
---
Really makes you think about that Travis Bickle outfit he wears.....
---
Somebody better make sure Pulse doesn't end up shooting some politician because he gets rejected
---
RemindMe! 24hours
---
First black ice was for the super 90 from a pack lmao
---
AK-12 is the best DPS in the game (not counting the smg-11 because recoil and mag size) and its tears holes in anything.
---
Boy you thought haha
---
still broken still sad
---
Oh lawd they commin
---
? Pengu is the one that let Ferral play since they were vs a shit team. He didn't actually get benched. Also quite a random topic to bring up.
---
U sure ?
---
Jackal 100% gun so good it's on the line of almost op  and his gadget is amazing just make sure your either in a safe spot or have someone watching your back while you enjoy your foot fetish
---
I feel like you are expecting a level of evidence that I cannot provide even if the claim was definitely true.
---
I don't have an assumptive number of accounts that have been hacked, I didn't make a claim like that. I just know that it's more than 10 as of today with what I've seen.
---
Could it be people being stupid? Sure! But I know for a fact that I wasn't, and it's unlikely that even stupid people would get their accounts hacked by foreign IP addresses with 2FA on. For eve one person to get hacked with both 2FA and a very hard to bruteforce PW it seems like a deeper issue with Ubisoft's cyber security.
---
As long as you bless the rains you can still play.
---
ayyyyyy
---
Listen, people have been saying these types of things for ages and ages etc. I love that more and more people are talking about it, but through my time in playing siege I have learned one thing that everyone needs to know. Ubisoft. Does. Not. Listen. To. The. Community. They listen to what the big people say, youtubers, twitch, pro league and so on. Those people don't normally play casual so therefore they don't think to pay attention to it. Crouch spamming is game breaking and exploiting a toxic feature, same thing with the rush meta (I.e. Jackal lion dokka ash etc.) as well as spawn peeking and so on. Ubisoft doesn't listen to the community at all no matter how many people talk about an issue, unless it affects pro league. It sucks and I hate it but it is what it is.

Perhaps but you've jumped from "maybe a few people's accounts are being compromised" to "OMG MASSIVE SCALE HACK ONGOING".

&gt;For eve one person to get hacked with both 2FA and a very hard to bruteforce PW it seems like a deeper issue with Ubisoft's cyber security.

Just making more assumptions.

Dunno man, always found her kinda attractive
---
"Y'ALL WANT SOME SOUP?!!"
---
Everyone but kixstar
---
It does have a fairly high damage per shot. However, getting atleast 3 shots on someone with very high recoil and low fire rate is (most of the time) gonna leave you down and out. Especially with how crouch spamming is. Reminder, that 3 shots to kill is chest shots with no Rook armor. Combine this with how low his fire rate is and the DPS on that thing is fairly lack luster. Power doesn’t always mean Efficient.
---
Last time I accidentaly did that, Rook tk the poor guy next to me thinking it was him...casual has no mercy 
---
Finally be able to stop getting blitz raped aswell lol im all for it
---
So guys we did it
---
The problem that I have with his shield isn’t that it’s so good, it’s because it’s literally a piece of Saran Wrap on a gun that lowers his utility. Other than attacking Master Bed on Coastline, I can’t think of many other spots where he is a great utility. With SMGs having such a high fire rate, most of them take the shield away in about half a second, which if you can’t find where the enemy is peaking from, can really put a damper on things.

You can get that info from dead teammates and quickly checking cams. They are 2 acog defenders with good guns, use them. 
---
Some are, some are not. Who cares?
---

If you want to ADS with the pistol, you have to expose yourself like Clash for all shields. No sprinting with shield up for Blitz. 2 hit kill melee. No leaning

Well you realize you still play to win, right? Regardless of whether or not it’s casual, when people play Siege, or any game, they’re playing to win the game... You may not necessarily have to be a “try hard,” but you still try somewhat. That’s the whole point of any game you play. 
---
Met so many siege players that did this lol
---
Well then you don’t deserve the charms
---
Yeah, it's ironic. You'd expect him to help his country, but he sold away everything
---
Hm, I have some experience about this. No offense, but most of the french players can't speak english. I speak Hungarian, German and a little bit english. This is a good idea, because I can identify the Germans and can talk to them, but it's bad because the triggered romanians always find me and just start screaming "Transilvania is ours!" (I did not even talk to them) They figured out my nationality from my name.
---
Tip for you: Just add good/non-toxic players as you play with them. Build up a group of people for you to play with. It’s pretty universally known that solo queue in this game is horrible.
---
I have changed my password but I'm not 100 sure these are from ubisoft as way back in the day I used to get these kind of emails regarding WoW and I know for a fact that those were just attempts for get me to click the malicious links.

The first time I ever played siege was the last week of the y1s2 pack and I thought "what idiot spends $7 for a skin?" Fast forward to now where I own the league sets from fuze-smoke, missing that pro league thermite is my biggest regret in siege
---
I like the idea of the timer for the ringing, like a normal phone call, but they've already said that they cant or are currently unable to implement something like that due to either engine restrictions or (I think the actual reason, I cant quite remember) the amount of game code that would need to be changed to accommodate that feature. 
---
What if I wanted to pick my Grizmots or my kapkan traps back up? I'd have to memorize where I've put them and I think that we should be doing the exact same thing with Lesion honestly

No, it's up to the Devs wether the game should have support, console is just throwing the option in the mix.

Not really

R/cursed 
---
That's not viable per round at all; she wouldn't be used.
---
sadly true
---
And teammates are copper
---
Like an Estate
---
If xbox may of been me.
---
I just think they went about it terribly. Rook has a high win rate because of his ability that helps the entire team, not because his gun does 3 damage too much, I just can’t believe they’re nerfing one speed operators when the gun isn’t even good, it’s the ACOG that makes it good for the most part 
---
c-75 definitely needs a buff
---
OP of this post and the one I tagged are actually the same person. Both posts of this picture have the same title and spelling mistake hahahah
---
Is that literally the only purpose of those windows?
---
The way she landed is historical 
---
nope, pc
---
Isn't this what Epic games is capitalizing at?
---
this sounds great for bronze - silver ranked!
---
Lol 😂 
---
So why was lion ever thought to be a good idea? He's so badly designed he's banned from pro league play 
---
max 5 rounds in casual, max 7 rounds in ranked. 
---
I kinda agree with those nerfs, but i think you could combine the two. Make it to where it's still a global ability, but the farther away she is the quicker the phone shuts off on its own.
---
I like the idea of having to earn using her ability, so it could be like hacking a phone grants a global call that doesn't turn off automatically.
---
Both are quite good at medium or short range. Personal preference over which youd want, I find the cz easier to control but smg-12 does have the better optics. Ttk is similar on most armor types (smg-12 is 40ms faster to kill on 2armor but cz needs one less shot on 1armors). I prefer the cz since it feels like it has no recoil to me.
---
IQ because my IQ is pretty high.
---
Lit
---
His ability is about not getting detected, but well, hes the only detected one
---
That prize goes to tower.
---
Ubisoft has said that they can't do anything about it because they can't tell the different between a controller and a controller emulator.
---
reeeeeeeeeee sports
---
It isn't bad and it has no recoil combined with a acog it is the strongest weapon after the Alda plus his strong ability they had to nerf them somehow and this is just the right amount 
---
Echo is supposed to be a hard counter to Dok what with him being immune to all of her abilities so idk why youd get acces to his drones 
---
I spawn peak with Tachanka 
---
IMO, the only way they can combat this in the future is actually enabling m&amp;k support on console.
---
isn't the art just better stats than the ak? (with lower mag size)
---
Push to talk is a feature that allows you to speak in game chat without leaving your party, by pushing a button. Mute mutes your mic
---
Epic made also a statement and they can so is ubi just lazy? 
---
How am I to know the answer to that? 
---
In game items or operators being banned from pro play is not something unique to siege, it is common. 
---
i understand that but it seems that if ubi wants casual to prepare people for ranked they should make it more similar. 
---
There should be like a pick and ban style competitive ranked queue for players over level 100 to avoid toxic low level players and give a more serious option other than basic ranked
---
At least you didn't get matched to an ongoing match 47 times a day unlike me bro :/
---
Just because you were bragging I want to join in. A few weeks ago I went 15-0 in 3 rounds of causal
---
I could never understand this they should grey out the leave match in the menus when your downed like take the L with some dignity. 
---
&gt;dont let a teammate die
---
"Just don't die" isn't a good counter-argument.
---
You can just be near a mute jammer and your phone won't go off
---
Telling you the obj/spawn would be sufficient. You can pick your operators and plan a strat, but keeps that casual element. 
---
TBF I have gotten someone for hitting the Siege servers so it must be a multiple report kinda thing. The problem with Xbox is that it needs to be a detailed report...
---
Thanks for the idea. Totally stealing this! 
---
😑
---
Who the hell would pay 2 hours worth of your time to get some textures that you can't even see yourself for 95% of the game?
---
Lmao the way you look at the footsteps leading to the back of the room 😂
---
Ikr 
---
well a criticism does not mean being asshole,
---
 from my point of view it could be a criticism rather that an insult but maybe because i'm too naive.
---
What goes around’s all around
---
Yeah the whole risk and use about dokkaebi is that roamers have to stop moving or holding an angle and be vulnerable for a sec. If a 3 speed would have his phone ring with a timer they'd just keep moving until it stops, especially in a 1v1. I rarely use it as an echo location tool but almost always as a way to catch people of guard or to stop them from losing me when i see them running. 
---
I've done T-hunt on Hereford dozens of times and I can confirm there were no bombers.
---
The new ash hit box 
---
The difference in play between console (controller) &amp; pc (k&amp;m) is night and day
---
Why even make a post just to shit talk someone?
---
i could get behind that also. it does suck when you pick mira and get west tower on oregon. 
---
Cocaine is one hell of a drug
---
If the phone stopped ringing by itself, I feel like defenders would just use it more to their advantage and bait attackers by not turning off the phone. That nerf and the buff of reducing her cooldown, which is already low, doesn't really put her in a better position. 
---
No it’s on amazon
---
Any aces?
---
Atl United scarf nice 
---
Literally every frost main like me
---
Yes, 2
---
JAK TO ZROBILES?
---
What pens do you use?
---
Repping ATLU!! My Man!
---
Both nerfs are pointless. 
---
It’s a wasted logic Bomb if nobody is in radius if you’re playing larger maps. 
---
But the iron sight alignment should’ve been fixed months ago
---
You told me it was naive to think balancing isnt taken into the equation when creating ops and I just showed you one that shouldn't have gotten past the drawing board.
---
The explanation for banning lion was because " he has no counters
---
This sounds awful. Why would anyone touch the phone if I can just hold the angle and get a kill from someone trying to pressure me while the phone rings?
---
Favela, Tower, Fortress
---
gorgeous man, gg !
---
Should've scanned for the points and wait behind him lol
---
Sorry Hibana!
---
What with them not existing anymore...
---
All for the nerfs, she doesn't need any buffs
---
Well you technically can by tracking the left stick movements, but on Siege the controls are in 22.5° intervals for movement I believe. It is very possible to get keyboard like movements in the current system and changing it would be too big to put in a single update and it would be two seasons of Operation Health kinda thing.
---
Probably February 17th because that's when they'll actually talk about them
---
Did you get an ace at least once
---
BUT WHAT ABOUT PRO LEAGUE???!!??!?!??! LION IS CANCER BECAUSE STANDING IN HIGH TIER WILL LITERALLY MAKE THEM COMMIT DIE. WILL NOBODY THINK OF THE DIAMONDS?!?!?! 
---
/s
---
I got 2
---
Dank
---
I got an ace with it and I’m bad at the game. I barely get headshots. The super 90s kinda good though
---
I appreciate the thought that went into your post and know that I’m not disagreeing to be a d-bag or for up/down votes. I am writing this as I too have been thinking of ways to deal with Dokk as an op. 
---
Here are my OPINIONS:
---
1) I don’t necessarily agree with the first nerf. If we stay true to lore for R6S, then Dokk would have the numbers of all ops. Instead of a radius signal, which why call if you can only call ops in your radius? You would then know who and about where a defender is located. Instead, the hacking feature should work as is but you select the five ops, which takes longer, a big nerf. So, if your run Dokk and your team don’t know any, only know 1, 2, etc of the defenders, then you need to manually select the Defenders to call. This, in my opinion is a better solution. 
---
2) To your second nerf, yes, after 7-10 seconds, send the call to voicemail or it just stops. However, going back to the whole “hacking” portion of her ability, theoretically, it would be possible to bypass the VM option and have the phone keep ringing. Shutting off the phone could be a solution and if chosen as a Defender then that Defender wouldn’t be able to use their phone for the remainder of that round. 
---
3) I’m not a fan of her shotty and I choose the C75 over the SMG12 so I’m not too swayed by those buffs. 
---
That's a macro for sure which means kronus max, or keyboard that can use macros 
---
Hidden leaf jutsu
---
Yeah, youd think huh
---
Or operator ideas. Ive seen some of the dumbest ideas on here
---
The nerfs outweigh the buffs way too much. Her phone CD and hacked phones volumes aren't really a problem to her
---
This is where the student becomes the maestro.
---
The guy had a scuff that was modeled with a macro
---
Sounds good. Does work. Not gonna happen cuz Ubi. 
---
I’m pretty sure I know the two guys on the right 
---
Because it is naive? Ubisoft have explained in multiple workshops the process behind creating operators. It's not a simple feat to balance as many operators as there currently is, they will get it wrong sometimes. 
---
And Lion does have counters on paper, it's just at the top level their effectiveness is pretty much null. 
---
It’s not his connection to the server but rather his voice chat connection. A simple restart of siege and the Ubisoft client should fix it. It’s been happening a lot recently I’m surprised there hasn’t been more chatter about it
---
There is such a thing as buffing an operator too much you know.
---
Any time.
---
I personally use it to go in the side door and quickly down blue hall on basement of chalet.  Use it just as you run in, it kicks them off the camera watching above.  This also gives audio ques if any defender is watching the area at that moment.
---
I find it to be an efficient way to pop a pesky mirror if they have a rotation to wine, or straight up killing a bandit attempting to trick.
---
I may get picked off shortly after, but the utility in killing Bandit or popping the mirror at my cost is exceedingly effective to win the round.
---
I had a friend who was pretty new to siege. We were playing one time on tower, and he was playing dokk. I found out during that game that he thought you had to hack a phone before you could use the global ability.
---
It makes perfect sense. You'd have to kill someone, then hack their phone, and *then* use the global ability. A ton of risk for a reward. He just assumed that, given the format the other ops have of high risk/high reward, that dokk would be the same.
---
I think it speaks to how unbelievably easy her ability is to affect the round compared to thermite, hibana, jackal, etc, that a new player would assume her gadget has a high risk aspect to it.
---
I’m always impressed by how many great artists this sub seems to harbor. Nice work OP!
---
Oh, this is a REALLY bad case of crouch spam, but at least Matimio said ubi was working on something idk
---
I just had to move it for lighting. I have it behind a foot stool so people will walk around and snap their femurs
---
Which game would you end up investing more time in = Go with that.
---
Just sent $50 on r6
---
Yeah still good for spraying tho and honestly I think it has more controllable recoil than the smg-11. Its better than a pistol in my opinion.
---
Yeah just him another god damn roaming op and leave his gadget useless
---
That's not feasible in almost any skill level of play, as roamers may die to her team, granting the attackers a huge advantage as it is. This would make her effect when one defender dies much smaller and more reasonable. 
---
Really? A lot of people still like the smg-11 over the bearing 9. The one bright side is that echo's pistol is awesome. 
---
Huh my friend’s woodwork teacher looks just like pulse as well. On another note, my science teacher looks like Walter White in the later episodes.
---
Never tried it I know some ppl are running it. P229 gang I might try it.
---
So that’s what, Lion (already coming), Finka, Doki, Rook, and Cav? We haven’t even gotten the Tachanka rework that he’s practically needed from launch. Adding another 4 isn’t going to do anything other than slow down the progression on the 2 they already have in the works which are desperately needed along with just regular bug fixes before this many reworks are even discussed.

Interact is F, melee is E. That's how I do it for every first person game I own. I like my games to be very consistent as far as controls are concerned. Getting mouse sensitivity the same across every game is a massive pain, but it's worth it
---
Wat
---
Thats understandable 
---
Sameeeee
---
I don’t think you quite understand how effective Lion can be. 
---
Let me know how well ‘just stand still’ works when you come against a team higher than silver that actually communicates. 
---
No. BOSG.
---
No. Totally not biased
