After upgrading the system did you reinstall windows? Cause that's a major motherboard driver and CPU change.
---

---
Also did you install all of your motherboard drivers? Chipset, Lan, etc
---
Both are situational. I think Gridlock is more useful for bomb for planting/covering. Also I’m in love with her LMG and her Scope sight
---
Why is everyone with my name an asshole?

Dam if ur queuing against hem u must be high play/diamond. You wanna carry me

Doc it is

Nice

For this reason is why im always playing lone wolf TH.

Put your money towards creating a unique combo of headgears and uniforms, rather than buying a boring set that everyone uses.

Ahh one of Xbox’s finest. Happens all too often

took me a second

I mean I’m new to the game only level 39 guess I got lucky

I got ddoosed for picking rook

Only when its OPs mom

Um. What?
---
Monty is just a good ban
---
Well shit that’s tuff
---
Havent got any hate mail on PS4. Of course I disabled messages from non friends. 
---
Can that be done on XB?
---
He's got a lot of armor on lol he's pretty fit.
---
What's your favorite color? "Crayon"
---
me and my friends always discuss this, recruit is a meme pick because he can't have attachments but he is actually one of the strongest operators to the point that simply giving him attachments could shift him from meme pick to s-tier
---
he has ridiculous versatility, having a second utility is arguably more useful than a situational ability and is 100% better than a bad ability
---
we always thought they should make him a full operator called utility and make his gimmick pre set selectable loadouts to prevent OP gadget combos, for example, "flash and clear" gives him breaches and flashes
---
Reported for hacking guaranteed(if they still had that)
---
Did it work for me?
---
it’s a joke
---
Alright Badger.
---
This is a great cosplay and it is literally echoes haircut, stop being a prick.
---
As I literally just said, copies is what we already got. They have different base skins, reload animations, the M249 has a different magsize and slightly altered model.
---
I’m offended.
---
I would have diarrhea explosion
---
Dumb luck. My connection is usually perfect but Nokk probably breached it.
---
Who?

We usuallyal go recruit and tbag the drones and destroy the door in front of them and they get the idea

Try verifying your game cache. I had that happen like a year ago. Just verified and it fixed. The update just bugged somehow for me.
---
Use his drone when you and your team need to move in a room it puts the enemy team in a hard position
---
Sometimes I think of it like that one Spiderman meme
---
That's what I'm trying to say. They don't need to make it good if it's free
---
Wanna see more perfect timing in r6 :)
---
I agree. He's damn good, especially if you use him and his mines properly. I just prefer to roam and stalk out attackers instead of being on the front line of defending the objective. Usually I leave him to someone else who enjoys him more and has more experience with him though.
---
And that really is a cool thing. His mines are super effective against attackers and can even act as signaling devices to teams who hear them go off if he's Not around to act on them. Not to mention, they definitely make those Montagne stand-offs end a hell of a lot quicker.
---
Which bar?
---
I think she is a very good op it’s just not a lot of people will fall for her stuff I just use it as a shield of some sorts I’ll stand behind it and wait for the enemy to shoot me and then they’re pinged
---
Big thomk
---
But theres Lion. I'm so confused.
---
One of the best looking mods I’ve ever seen
---
#rook mine
---
So the top recruit picks are a scuffed Ying and a bootleg Bandit? Noice
---
Well, first season I majority of the time messed around with my friends as a team, which explain why I was so low. 
---
Second season was more of a learning experience because I did 50:50 of solo queue and team of friends, but was still learning
---
And finally in burnt horizon I solo’d until I got to gold and started playing with my plat friends, working on aim, and getting better.  And for this season, I am mostly running a 2 man with my friend, or running a 4-5 man with another friend, which is what got me to plat 2, not plat 3 though.
---
Sorry for long response, just didn’t know what you wanted to know specifically
---
Lion is easily avoided. All jackal has to do is find one of your footprints and boom your dead.
---
Oh dang
---
Hey man, no worries, I will.
---
granted so is twitch
---
You’re good. It’s amazing that even working with multiple people, you were able to work hard enough in a couple seasons to get to plat 2. Good job! I’m very jealous
---
Coastline or tower. Wide, expansive play
---
Yes all the time
---
that was the best one
---
House for the boys
---
I suck with Monty
---
Lesion ban meta plz
---
He’s most effective if you’re playing with a squad. He’s a great choice when playing bomb as you can use his gadget after planting the defuser.
---
Thank you, I really enjoyed this game from the start because it gave me a break from having to stress over school and let me have fun with friends, a lot more than other games did. But, it took a ton of time and terrorist hunt to get here, even with teams.
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
---
I tend to roam with Lesion but not like crazy far from objective. I usually stay on the same floor. Unless there is a fuse above of course.
---
Wait a hecking minute he actually said that
---
Its a glitch it will be back to normal soon
---
They seriously need to add Epic/Legendary items when you hit a really small percentage like this. But nope, common instead
---
This happened to me, but I was on the other team. It wasn’t fair and I feel bad for you.
---
Wasn’t intentional
---
Little policy of mine....
---
Dont always need accuracy when you have the higher rate of fire! 
---
Accuracy still helps tho...
---
I legit bought it this morning and some guy called me a power ranger
---
Lol people going off about how much better they are when theyre hackusated is a pretty strong indicator that theyre actually cheating. Everyone else just memes or says "thanks"
---
I'll try that thanks
---
Me likey coastline
---
Well TIL that the grappling indicators actually mean something. :)
---
I was in this clip
---
This makes no sense to me. I'd rather bait and switch a jackal than deal with a lion

Oregon or old hereford

Dont worry about it, you wouldnt use it anyway.

i’ve run into similar people with the similar thing on xbox

Stolen BTW :v
---
Local doc main here to say that I’m glad to be considered the least annoying.
---
An acog is always a buff
---
I always vote for Twitch first, but if the opposing team already banned her, then my second pick is Jackal.
---
I might be in the minority on this one, but if Echo is already banned, then I vote up Valkyrie.
---
Blitz as a def😂 actually good idea all jokes aside
---
They’ve done it once before I’m pretty sure
---
The reduced recoil on the deagle is kind of ridiculous now.
---
maybe I dont want to play ranked?
---
Fortress is too big a roamer galore
---
Of course this drops the day I buy warden and nokk. I don’t have season pass so I bought them with r6 credits

Oh my

Same, I want to get it cause I play a lot of lesion but it doesn’t feel like an elite skin to me

Where's Smoke's elite tho

Reminds me of the Fury from MGS 3
---
Ikr i see PRO LEAGUE players using vertical grip on the ump45 which has zero recoil
---
r/TechnicallyTheTruth
---
Where is recruit?
---
I actually love it, but hate it.
---
That's in no way funny. And don't use her scorpion. It's the worst gun in game, statistically and in practice.
---
You ever just take something from BO4 and put it in R6 ?
---
Pulse should be S tier.
---
He's too good to be in this
---
Well water gang
---
How about you dont ruin the experience for low level players? That sounds fun.
---
Yeah he's above s he is defined as God
---
Not like people will ban ela anymore.

Just saying I’d take black ice over this any day.

Lol

Get a last look!

Git Gu-ed

Recruit?
---
Don’t name drop dude
---
Just feel verbally more sluggish. I get tunnel vision. Kinda like when you first start playing. I feel very bad. And yes I play a variety of different ops.
---
I don't understand what your comment means
---
I got kicked by battleye once for no reason, because last night during my last match all went fine until my screen goes black and I can't do anything but to hard-restart my PC. Thankfully I'm not banned though.
---
Understandable
---
I'll try changing my playstyle
---
I don't think it really counts as abuse when anyone can turn the settings on.
---
Nah that’s battle scarred

The hidden E tier
---
No she has a dick
---
Same thing happens to me. Recently I was even kicked for being too low of a rank (in casual) despite doing the best on the team. Even my friends who I play with everyday have started kicking me when I (silver 3) dont play to their gold standards. Everyone in the siege community just seems to think they are better than everyone else.
---
I admit, I have done aloooot of smurfing on playing around with low ranks. In fact, I have 7 different smurfs. It’s fun at first but eventually it starts to get super boring. Only fun out of it will be hearing compliments and haccusations. 
---
Now I have transformed those 7 accounts to my ”practice” accounts. At the start of every season I solo que and see what account gets the best placement rank. Much more fun playing against high rank players and improving than going 20-0 every game against low ranks.
---
dude same

Distinguish attacker/defender cameras better.

Until your in post plant. Which lost my team 4 rounds today. I'm not bitter at all.

Other than a slight resemblance in shirt colour, there’s absolutely nothing tying them together.

Your spacing is awful. But thankfully the enemy team was less than... average knowledge of the map.
---
Dayum
---
Horribly. Fell down hatch today and unloaded a whole clip on Warden, just to for him to teleport away and me just standing there reloading and then be killed when he comes around the doorway. Usually happens when falling through hatches or jumping through windows for me. Before this season my connection was nice and stable, now I randomly hit ~1100 ping once in a while throughout the match.
---
Yea. This is the only platinum that I have a chance of earning in this game.
---
Indeed
---
Yeah. Usually pulls 1 or 2 attackers. Draw them into an ambush. Easy kill. I used to play alot of Jackal, made me pretty good at countering him.
---
I think a semi randomized feature like that would be neat. It would keep it so I wouldn’t have to keep changing them over and over
---
Didn't realize it was a looping gif until I noticed that the names were the same

Did you make that?

Command wheel anyone?

I don’t understand what the promotional video has to do with anything, I never argued that the elite had a different design previously.

Why, theyre toxif af, dont downvote dude

What the

They both have visors, both lost someone close to them and find ways to sort the blame, both are of Spanish/Latino decent, and idk I just felt they looked similar.

I just cant play ranked anymore

It doesn't represent the mechanics of the actual game.
---
I thought it was around for a while
---
I'm still bronze
---
Agreed. They need to find a way to see who leaves and who was forced out by accident. Itd suck if they made the punishment worst but the wrong people get caught in it.

I didn’t, but we live in a world where Reddit staff doesn’t like name dropping so mods can’t like name dropping and neither can we or the sub goes down

Oh and I personally use t-hunt to level up my smurfs. House on normal mode. There’s 3 different spawns for every group of terrorists and you’ll learn them quickly. Soon it will take less than a minute finish a t-hunt and get that 1700 xp
---
Get a better pc.... If that's not an option, try to find the perfect sensitivity settings and then never change them ever again. Also look into thumbstick extenders, those can be helpful to some people.
---

---
Maybe you shouldn't buy an operator when there is a commonly known exploit involving that operator, and then get mad when you can't use them until it's fixed
---
Maybe you shouldn't assume that because it's your first time with customer service, you're entitled to whatever you ask for

If they aren't going to issue refunds, tough tiddies and sour milk. You didn't make a purchase  you're satisfied with.

That and an MP5. The MPX just isn't enough.

If it doesn't hurt you why get upset over it? In that case isn't it just a problem of the people asking how fast they get their answer?
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Is that for burst or for rapid fire?
---
Lmao is this Xbox? No wonder
---
I dislike lesion as well his armor is good but the other stuff is just bad to mediocre.
---
My favorite elite skins are kapkan iq and doc cause they overall are pretty good.
---
WRONG!  Doc Is Tier S! Did You See Em Plat II Level 270 Doc Runouts?
---
Glad I'm not the only one
---
Ubi are the equivalent of mods
---
*GAY*
---
Except I lost because it was a 2v5 from round one.
---
Tell me which op does not require map knowledge, game sense and timing please.
---
Not just PC, console has this problem too at the higher ranks. Like mid to high plat usually
---
That’s cool I don’t have very many black ice skins
---
Dannng, we’ll nice!
---
Both. I’ve done really good with the AK12 burst, and the recoil is ass on it so it helps with auto
---
It’d be more even, sure, but it’d make matchmaking much longer at times.
---
Plenty of times actually only issue I've had is that they want you to spell shit correctly to find topics other than that no issues.

---
For c7e compensator, it has a lot of angled recoil, muzzle brake for m4 bc it has a bunch of recoil, especially on Xbox bc it's so much harder to control
---
The map is Consulate
---
Now you regret buying the 1 charm, don't you?
---
I usually just switch to another game. This game is good, but I play 90% of the time with my friend since I tend to get frustrated quite often solo q’ing.
---
Fortress isn’t horrible but then again every time I get a map I don’t like that much I think “at least it’s not favela”
---
I love you sir.
---
You don’t have to play cas to be a idiot. VYORIIV mya name Ive been plat every season since inception. “Map variety “ is the dumbest excuse for bad players to play trash maps your clearly not good enough to understand why those maps are trash, bad maps have skewed sites. But you have to be good to understand why there bad.
---
I thought this was a really good play on the op but then I realized it was console. So the other guy's never stood a chance. No one in this clip had skill. Just dumb luck. Console sucks.....PC MASTER RACE!
---
Muzzle break works best for dmrs, so running compensator or flash hider will be better for fully auto weapons. Compensator if you fire full auto, flash hider if you burst fire.
---
Nøkk. Warden is lackluster.
---
The standard edition comes with Year 0 ops, and there should be 20.
---
Cries in user flair
---
I feel attacked
---
Former shield main, can confirm
---
*Who planted that?*
---
Plot twist: It's you.
---
On the clutch moments one, at least 80% of them are just “meh” plays being above average than the rest, most of these are play a high gold/play would make, nothing “INSANE” or something that stands out.
---
Same bro
---
So much perfect timings
---
Yes. There is nothing on the menu for him. He has   0 Operators. Not even the beginning 20. He is in my party, so he's connected to the servers.
---
I mean is this just off of what ubi says or is this like tested?
---
WHO PLANTED THAT?
---
But don’t you have to be in the same party on xbox to do it?
---
Bruv that decreases first shot accuracy and you fired a whole mag at him lol
---
Yep it is why I tell people if no one has picked Echo to just pick him over Doc or Rook, throw up his cams, and then just play like you would as the other two.
---
I mean, I’m pc but I find that I burst a lot more and so I wondered if flash hider was the way to go
---
Oh yeah, definitely, so fun, then Monty as well
---
oh welp, so he's got recruit?
---
But... platinum is... platinum. There is only one per major game.
---
You just rocked their world.

Nothing worse than 200 continuous rounds AND 10 grenades, all in one room.

This is amazing!

---
As sad of a situation as it is, at least you’re on the lucky side of it this time
---
What’d he say?
---
I know it’s sooo annoying
---
*fingers crossed*
---
It's okay on some guns but I don't prefer it on most, if ur looking for rlly good recoil reduction pick muzzle brake, trust me
---
Exactly.
---
That's just what ubi says, it was tested back in Grim Sky, I dont remember the results or of it actually tests the m4. The only test I've watched is on VarsityGaming's channel. The link is: https://youtu.be/Vh8loCpglmk
---
You mean diamond 3 right?
---
Best bet then is a custom match with a couple friends, usually I have it set for the longest match time possible to give everyone good amounts of time to wander and explore the map
---
I see. I have experienced this in seige before but nothing this bad and if its the servers oh well now i now what to complain about.
---
Varsity needs one but he has a shitty logo anyway😭 unless he just gets a vg with some type of interesting font
---
Can you tell me how you did it so I can attempt to do it with a PS4 controller?

I’m saying it’s even more fun with friends

Yea, I think getting all the operators on your own can be fun

When people try to stand up for us it's very reassuring. But sometimes that just eggs someone on. When it comes to team killing there are two things you can do, ignore it or avenge it. But if there's a whole team there isn't much you can do. Just message the person being harassed, sometimes it's good to know that not everyone is a piece of shit.

Intentional? Yes. Awful? Also yes.

They spoof the game server IP and ddos it. It happens to my squad constantly. It's certainly not a rumor.

I just got my first one for the MP7 at 107 yesterday.

So when she carry’s more of the enemy teams items she walks louder and is slower. I need help designing her.shes 5’6 slender frame you can be creative with how she looks just add a pendent of something resembling her mother.back story on her:she was born in pas-de-Calais in France and grew up with a rough child good with no father and a dying mother so she took in a life of cane to feed her and get medicine sadly she passes away(if you have any ideas please tell me)

Whats wrong with Nomad? Her airjabs almost never get kills  theyre just an antiflanking device to stop Caveira sprinting up behind you.

He does need a nerf though, too much everything. Proleague bans him often too.

I know your pain bro

Personally nokk even though I'm not sure how to play her well yet but warden is cool too. Why not both?

I just used spray paint and some normal paint for touch ups. Be sure to paint lightly though!

Just because hitboxes are better now doesn't mean Ash's hitbox is the same size as docs. Her speed with her small head makes her harder to headshot than Doc.

If you can control the vertical recoil, the gun is extremely easy to use. If you trust that spray and really work on keeping your shots centered, you’ll be satisfied with how quickly you’ll mow people down. I **highly** recommend using the holographic sight on it too. That rate of fire **and** clip size is absolutely insane and should be taken advantage of by more players.
---
you can get an app for gamer dvr which helps with mobile posts, you enter in your gametag, or someone else’s and it shows all your saved clips and you can edit them or save them to photos
---
i hope so man..
---
Damn, boi must've had a REAL hard on for capitao. Never seen insults that varied and complex. I wish him luck, and hopefully he finally gets a date with his one true love.
---
Lookin like Andrew Yang
---
Did you lose every game you played?
---
It's right here see? I used my special armor panel.
---
another good cam placement on cigar is with valk where you throw it on the christmas tree and it blends in with the bright bobbles
---
I’m actually kind of disappointed, even if I barely use Lesion.
---
1. It wasn't announces, it wasn't public many people still don't even know, yiu see people asking what it is now after they finally said due to issues 
---
2. Correct, but every case is handled separately and despite stating no digital refunds companies still do it as I said as a good gesture. 
---
3. Not a good analogy. If your product you purchase is faulty you are entitled to a full refund within x amount of days. After that time frame they must repair or provide replacement at the same or greater value. 
---
If you purchase a hoover online and they with old it because it's faulty you are immediately entitled to a refund.  If its a known fault with then product its recalled and no allowed to be sold. 
---
The games industry is so far behind the rest of the consumer world its scary what can be be done without affecting your rights.
---
Better yet something they need to fix is when One or more of my team mates leave and i get no replacements later in the game yet my enemy team loses like 3 consecutive players and gets replacements instantly
---
Bullets actually come out of your POV in this game, so directly where he/she is aiming
---
nice.
---
Fools! I have recieved THREE duplicate Black Ice’s so far
---
For you. And you can easily ignore it if you do not want to answer. They on the other hand simply do not know yet. And asking when one doesn't know something is completely fine. At somepoint you too will have a question. And do you want somebody just telling you to "Simply google it" or... well... maybe answer after you asked a question?

Hello SlaytanicDeath, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c2e0bw/picking_up_armor_packs_is_crashing_the_game_for/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
It’s also a result of not queueing ranked with a full team. It’s unfortunate due to the toxicity, but these issues can easily be avoided by 
---
only playing ranked with four other people you  like playing with.
---
Both equally suck lol I’ve had 1 2v5 once
---
Left side of his mouth
---
The grenade is way to strong purely because it has a frag grenade indicator.
---
Frags are strong because they force a reposition not because they can just kill.
---
Forcing a reposition of a defender whilst also doing everything else is incredibly powerful.
---
Chinese is also a race btw
---
Sadly this isn’t true
---
what in the fuck? how do you fight the invisible fuckmines
---
I got it and it’s dope to not have to save renown on operators, I can save for other stuff like seasonal skins or chibis or alpha packs. Mozzie is tight and has a lot of character 2 dope guns and shot gun secondary and a cool ability. He’s like an echo junior. Gridlock mad underrated super annoying to play against and she’s a tank. Nøkk is awesome and very easy to play I like her gun people talk shit but it’s really accurate and sounds good and has a nice vortex scope and she get a strong as desert eagle. I have gotten many kills on people who are on cameras looking for enemies. Warden is cool, I like the mpx it’s accurate and he gets a shotgun. His ability is okay I don’t get to use it a lot but when I do it puts a smile on my face. Everyone bans blitz but I wish that man would run up on me. 
---
Then you get 600 credits with the season pass u can buy some seasonal skins or get a new operator and they shop discount is dope too it doesn’t seem like a lot but it makes a difference. 
---
It’s nice knowing that when the new ops come out u are gonna get them 
---
Next year I’m getting the pass as soon as it comes out to get the skin that comes with it 
---
👍
---
Agreed
---
rid of cav and make it lesion
---
It just got a seasonal update and its community is still growing...
---
Okay but the Chinese Smoke icon is 10x better than ours wtf
---
Lesion looks waaaaay too much like the guy that owns the card shop i go to.
---
Anyone else noticed that he’s got a grenade pin in his mouth instead of a tooth pick?
---
this is one of the best comments i have ever had the pleasure of reading
---
China Man
---
From the mentioned window you can shoot the not nulletproof part
---
I wasnt worried about the points tbh, I was more concerned about the wasted utility, especially considering how important both of those gadgets are lol
---
Or start a que then join a different squad, has happened a few times to me and my friends
---
More like Chinese buzz lightyear
---
Fuck those people tbh HK was a safe haven to exploit the east longer than enough
---
Jäger has two more and Maestro has another they’ll be fine
---
Cameras are *glowing* my man. They'll never be camouflaged. And the first thing attackers take is piano room, so it'll last about a minute.
---
You should put it on site to cover plant spots since it's main feature is looking through smoke.
---
That's it. Let's suggest a Lego-based operation to Ubisoft for the next season. If Forza can do it, why Siege can't?
---
New to the game, is this a super rare camo?
---
&gt;You don't have to play the game they maintain
---
I paid for this game. I have the right to complain about something that changed after **I bought the game**.
---
This isn't a YouTube streamer highlight montage site though. It's a forum for everyone. Downvote and move on. There's no reason to be elitist and moderate every post that doesn't get an ace or 720noscope or whatever.
---
Not gonna lie chief, I feel like if you were to invest that amount into Ubisoft as a company you would own it
---
SDU actually used some MP5 variants along with other European and US weaponry like Glock 17 and G36 which are handgun and rifle respectively, but people would rage if we get another MP5 user and putting rifle on a defender is a bad idea. So they decided to go with Chinese weapons because reasons.
---
Stutter can be due to
---
1- 100% cpu usage
---
2- temperature spikes (was my issue)
---
3- Nvidia driver issue
---
4- something else
---
Check for the first 3. If that doesn't work, I'll try to suggest a few stuff I did.
---
I mean it is hot here in Hong Kong.
---
I’m too low rank; half the people don’t realize they can punch out cams...
---
I feel like getting rid of the invisibility on Echos drones would be a fine nerf without making him terrible
---
how i feel about children
---
Anyone can with basic melee.
---
I like the blue, but everyone else likes the green lol
---
Why not remove wire just from her? 🤔
---
Asking the same
---
I feel like I deserve to be lower then I am, I played my first match in Gold 1 nearly plat and my entire team knew every call out and I am just yelling "HE IS OVER BEHIND THAT BWOOP WOOP LOOKING THING"
---
they will translate to a more sound-alike name
---
Sounds like thermal throttling, how are your CPU temps when these stuff happen.
---
It's so hot that people expose their stomach to cool off.
---
Captain Cargo Shorts with Hawaii shirt and popsicle is the *true* elite!
---
i know i was there
---
It looks good as it is, at least you have the feeling that it is actually gold, not just spray painted, like most of the skins.
---
I don't know, I like Twitch's one too.
---
I can’t wait for it to be back out of the game in 2 months, hopefully the bring back claymores and deployable shields aswell
---
Bruh
---
Looks like cheap bootleg ripoff icons. Kinda fitting for the Chinese market
---
Smooth
---
hmm i think it looks appropriate for an mp.  i was kind of confused too when i played him the first time, but its something new so why not

Thank you, very helpful

yes,  but it’s not official. I got this image from the siege sub

Also he can fuck shit up by playing vertical - secondary shotgun and breach charge combine it with top tier AR
---
Wat
---
Yeah. I'm fine with them having different guns to add variety, it's not like this is a realistic game anyway.
---
No need, I agree.
---
pogchamp
---
I suppose it can make the game less fun if you can't play with your friends just because of your rank, but yes I agree it is too easy to smurfand in a sense it does spoil the experience.
---
I heard something like "the SDU were given Chinese weapons so they could be added to the game without adding CTU's from either the PRC or ROC"
---
Got to love the reinforcing after the preparation fase...
---
Haven't played since the update but who the hell would ban Cav in anything above silver. Complete non-issue whose ability is like completely nullified with an ounce of teamwork.
---
This hurts to watch...F

We aren't in Khakis anymore...

That’s nice!

How do we know this isn’t staged

Uncommon
---
i like the smoke one, but the rest i prefer as they are, but if the changes come, i will accept them, operators icons arent a gamechanger for me
---
These smurf squads still play like golds that’s why they smurf so there is no problem imo
---
Thanks.
---
Chinesium man?
---
I don't know which region you're playing on, I'm playing in Europe (as I'm from there) I played a lot of Ranked (for like the past 2 years) and it never happened to me to have a diamond in my game.
---
Having your game set to the "max" rank present in the group is dumb, it just causes more frustration, as I said, it just causes the person at the "max" rank refusing to play with his friend because he'll be facing people his rank on 1v5, and on the other hand, sometime you'll be 5v1 (copper playing with gold or silv for example) so it's dumb, an average is much better, cause if you have 4 copper and 1 diamond, where you end up somewhere in the ball park of silvers, which seems fair
---
#makesiegefriendlyagain

*[REDACTED]*

I actually like the smoke one
---
Totally would dig this one!

Alright, seemed as if my pc was getting a little hot so I was wondering whether or not I should worry. Thanks!

"Do yall even speak the same language?" Well, reading the rest I'd say no.

If we're going that far let's slap a shield on it for BB

I get around 100-140 fps on siege
---
good job man, wish i could play with u i got ps4 tho
---
This brings back memories from when I played on ps4
---
Considering how much money they want... yes? Consumer.rights are a thing.
---
Why are you trying to make Ela even weaker?
---
Oh, multiple people told me it’s required for the clash glitch
---
nah it isn't
---
Shitty repost account
---
Also, you’re an asshole
---
Unlucky, my friend got black ice for the 417 on his first crate

He looks like the guy from wolverine 2013

You are really trying hard aren't you.

Dont play ranked? If you dont then dont worry i wont make fun of you since in kinda low lvl

Happy cake day.

r/notopbutok
---
Well, wait until free weekend is there
---
does this mean cavs face paint would be changed as well?
---
put it to 0.25x speed, it's clearly a miss
---
My Tachanka helmet disagrees
---
Is it happening only to this game ? Bec maybe it's a graphic card issue.
---
Is it free to play for a weekend, or do you get it for free that weekend?
---
Why post it 4 times...
---
To give you the rundown of the post, OP’s team banned the operators who are annoying to play against
---
When the revolution comes, you'll be the first to no doubt side with the massive mega corporations I bet. 😒
---
damn i got mine last January at like 78
---
For a specific period of time, the game is free
---
R6 uses the ac2 engine which isn’t capable of doing so that’s why these glitches take that much time to be dealt with. Any harsh action might crash the game even worse
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
Totally made my day , thank you.
---
Ooo, so you can choose what operators you dont want to play against?
---
.-.
---
&gt;Reply
---
So what ? Because some player are boosted than everyone should face higher ranks player all the time? That way if you end up playing with a friend that's a tiny bit above your rank your going to just get instantly killed, yeah sure that's the rainbow six I want, a game where I can't play with friends, because I'm going to end up with people 10 ranks above me, I'm sure that's going to make the best Rainbow Six Siege ever, and when you'll end up with a full team of copper against you because they played with a gold, sure you won't call that "Boosting" because you'll feel like that's a good victory !
---
I once found a thread on here that asked a really interesting question : "What's a good siege game?" :
---
There were two main types of anwser : 
---
1. Dumb Try Harder : "Any as soon as I win you dumbass"
---
2. "Fair Play" : "A good game is a game where you are at the middle of it and won't know the outcome, because the game is really tense"
---
Plus having one Diamond player on a "copper game" won't make it a sure win, because Siege is so much based on team play that rank doesn't matter this much.
---
What does blitz have to do with anything
---
So its a 100% discount that weekend?
---
I came across a stray dog once called Moe. That dog was awesome, he was a little escape artist, he lived out in the country but would always wander into town while his humans were at work and get taken back by one of the townsfolk. Hence how I met him. Looked like a Sealyham Terrier but stickier and cooler. So not everyone. I'm sure your awesome too.
---
GAMER

This an bf1

i play near obj
---
You can play it without buying it during free weekend but when the free weekend is done you cannot play unless you buy
---
but you've posted the first one https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c2fmt3/quite_possibly_the_luckiest_shot_i_have_ever_seen/
---
You're literally telling people to report others without any video proof?
---
Oooookay, thanks :p
---
No, but its funny af.
---
Update Ur driver, reinstall tht. My doubt is on the card. I may be wrong.
---
JoeyDiazInSpace is the server hitter. It’s also funny how we were up 3-0 and they’re all dropping donuts and breadsticks and once they get defense they play all traps and hit the server. They also banned Thatcher first so they knew they were gonna do this regardless
---
nothing yeah it's funny hahahaha
---
When I first watches it it was going like 2 frames a second
---
Are you being sarcastic?
---
I have the legendary Lesion headgear.... Would be insane on this Elite.
---
Then credit the artist . otherwise it counts as "Karma whoring"
---
*sees flair* oh no
---
same, now at 104 and nothing
---
And this is what we call witch hunting
---
Specific gamemodes only, In gamemodes ranked the banning of operators will always happens, in the gamemode casual you cannot ban operators, when you play a custom match you can configure the settings to on or off the banning of operators
---
Because doing so would kill Siege ?
---
Imagine if this is how any other competitive game would work, you'd be in so much trouble, and game balance would be even worse than how it already is
---
Rook instead of echo, I main rook. My team rushed the objective and immediately got blasted by that drone and all of them died.
---
Add me on Xbox MiDNiGHTxPLUT0 !
---
After abt 170 combined hours (3 shields,  2 platforms) shielding, monty is the best defensive,  blitz is a hybrid (flash is a defensive tool imo, stops them from shooting you and disables) , and fuze is the most attack oriented  shield. Using him w/ breach is where I see most success, smokes are amazing, but the ability to have 2 wireless devices is too good for mindgames. Preplacing the breach to get people to move to an advantaged angle to watch the hole you make, then fuzing them, blowing holes above then fuzing their safe spots, detonating breaches to (somewhat) mask the puck noises, or just having an easier and safer way to maneuver as a shield, etc.
---
Plus fuze has the objectively best shielding guns, the pmm having sniper hipfire, good reload and ttk, range and (opinion) sights, and the gsh-18 having the most mag for the shielding 3 hit pistols. Shield fuze is slept on, but he is my fave way to play fuze.
---
The only skin that's practical
---
Anybody else get a change?
---
If you master its recoil acog, supp are fucking headpoppers.
---
how did you know that ?
---
Why do people keep posting the same thing multiple times
---
I am ilon man
---
Which are countered by multiple opperators especially thatcher.
---
Which do you think has a more severe effect, ela mines or echo blasts
---
This is against the rules of this sub
---
You can still change your sensitivity
---
no
---
Provide proof if you accuse someone, otherwise this is just useless whining.
---
Mind if I borrow that?
---
sorry
---
Walking and running will leave them but crouching around wont. Pretty sure crawling doesnt either but when is that even useful.
---
Kk, and you banned those operators because?
---
The Ela icon has seen some shit
---
He needs both
---
The games takes the average elo which lets them face high to low golds who should be able to deal with them -&gt; still no problem
---
I would have died 😂
---
It’s hard to tell, id say overall the echo blasts are worse because not only do they concuss you, the drones themselves act as cameras
---
This is how I feel when Ubi took away Kaid's barbed wire
---
my evil traps ready to drill some stronzos
---
Wow almost all of that is wrong, impressive
---
&gt;Because doing so would kill Siege ?
---
Not like matchmaking is doing any better. Lower ranks who are supposed to learn and move up to plat are getting dumpstered by plats because the same plats are too pussy to play against people of their own skill level. That's unfair. I don't see how that's good for the health of the game. If anything, we'll lose a larger chunk of the community if this system stays.
---
&gt;Imagine if this is how any other competitive game would work, you'd be in so much trouble, and game balance would be even worse than how it already is
---
We're already in serious trouble. Besides, other competitive shooters have matchmaking failsafes that match with higher ranks, so I've been told, so this is a necessity in siege.
---
Oath
---
Imo ela mines are worse since echo cannot kill you while piloting the drone, while ela can when  she realizes a mine has been triggered
---
Maybe if they ever looked good.
---
Sounds like someone can't handle recoil
---
Why would you want to play cav when banning Jackal, really dont see the relation.
---
Jackal can *never* find a cav as she doesnt leave footprint and can disable his tracking if she somehow does leave one.
---
Debunked
---
Holy crap this is a great idea. I’m gonna try this
---
Well i lost most of the Outbreaks skins i bought... Support says if i give them a proof that i had them ill get them back, but how tf should i proof it.
---
I completely forgot she anything but an AK-74
---
Rule #2
---
Reported you for witch hunting
---
See to me that makes no sense. 
---
Your going to have to use those ops anyway when you switch sides. If you go 3-0 up and then realise you cant attack, then its really easy to end up 3-3. 
---
Big thing ive been reminding my team about this season is its not over till its over - theres alot of teams out there better at defending than attacking etc
---
How is it not? There doesn’t seem many ways in at first but I tend to manage, and almost all the sites are defendable but also attackable. There isn’t very much vertical play, but skyscraper doesn’t have a giant amount either
---
I hate the top floor site. Other than that it’s fairly decent
---
Oh yeah, I'll be waiting for that elo back, you know what I'm saying?
---
The problem with a report system, is people will abuse it. A random 5 man can give a random
---
Player 5 reports for doing nothing? They can just report them and be toxic that way? It needs a way of recording games, and a team who goes back and watches the reported players games etc. A report system can be exploited
---
Gotta capitalize frost and hibana for them to appear my guy
---
Definitely, just make it easier and more efficient. That's all I need.
---
I like that version of smoke honestly
---
Wo men ai ni San qian
---

---
That would be hard with this community
---
Git gud
---
We can try
---
You should make a Video-Tutorial on how to make one of these
---
I don’t see why your being so against it? We see it a lot yes, but it is a good map? 
---
This is the honest truth now, I’ve not lost a game of Hereford since Grimsky was released. We have strats for Top floor, second and basement. And also attacking strats. Me and my team are probably on a 30/40 win streak on Hereford?
---
A dedicated team to review and determine the outcome of the reports would probably be the most efficient I think.
---
I only kept it to the ones that are most popular, and bought the most.
---
Yes boosters cost money but barely anyone buys those unless they're a streamer and they're even more non-essential than skins.
---
Lootboxes are just skins, pro league skins are just skins, elite skins are just skins not to mention it's what's being talked about in the first place and are all included under what I regard as skins in my comment so why separate these other than to pad out a list?
---
Yes, operators can cost money if you don't wanna spend time unlocking them, but because Ubisoft has streamlined the different tiers of the game you could buy that have x amount of the ops included, I didn't include that into what I said cos that's just 'buying the game' for the sake of a short concise comment. New ops yes, if you wanna buy a season pass you can to play the new ops one week early (which I mentioned), but again monetising hero/operators/legends in an online game isn't new, and it's non essential, and you have a free option to earn with playtime via renown.
---
So there's three things they monetise:
---
Season Passes.
---
Skins.
---
Boosters.
---
Xbox or PS4? Or PC?
---
Looks like there was second one directly behind the first.
---
That's a third party service run by ESL. That's like saying if you wanna have a competitive game of football you should qualify for the champions League. You say this like CL is easy to get to as well.
---
Love doing that
---
Take a break dude. I left and played something chill for about a week and when I came back I was being nutty AF.

"I want aim practise so remove things I need to actually aim well at in order to kill fast"
---
Yeah,apparenly everyone who dies to bombers are shit because they explode once they come around the corner without breathing for a second.
---
Everyone who hates bombers is just bad apparently.
---
It's not like those fuckers also survive claymores and shit.
---
Yeah,we all are just BAAAAD and that's coming from a recruit main who still thinks that meme is a thing
---
Yeah . that too
---
How?
---
Bombers are the worst thing to practice aim,especially if they come around the corner and explode without you expecting them
---
I don't ubi make discount if you have pro league skin for the weapon but not for unifrom etc. because they sell as a bundle or maybe they make second skin for them
---
And reticle colora
---
*Tachanka has joined the chat*
---
Oh,not to forget to mention they survive explosives which makes no sense
---
&gt; Bombers are the worst thing to practice aim
---
Not sure how you can support that conclusion.

&gt;especially if they come around the corner and explode without you expecting them
---
That's on you.

Factory Resetting? 
---
That's an interesting term....
---
Do you mean wiping CMOS? 
---
Fragmenting Drives and Reinstalling Windows/Linux? 
---
Simply entering Safe Boot/Repair Mode?

Typically a Factory Reset is something one does on a mobile device such as a mobile phone to reset the phone to default settings, before any updates or changes were made. This is not really a thing on PC.
---
Can I have an explanation?
---
^^^^^
---
Lots of general statements here that can be made about any game. No supporting anecdotes or stats. Lazy
---
Listen here you ol exxxtra affrikan ass, i dont care bout your white woman problems. Do yall even speak the same language? Ol extre, "im the captain now" looking headass. Said, "the fuck, how didnt i hit him?" Shooting at the floor ass boi. Whats 9+10, 21 headass. Where you from? Tazmania? Ol tazmanian tiger lookin ass. The fuck you look like you shop at the gap and the bootleg vesace store? Looking like a slavic somali pirate with floaties on.

Just wait till you get higher and people realize they're not bulletproof from the side...

Just trying to point out what you could have done better, most of the time you won't be that lucky.

---
hitting shots like this is why i became addicted to this game
---
oh yeah that would make more sense. It's not poorly timed though, so his argument doesn't hold much value lol
---
You can still play recruit in ranked. If all your owned ops are picked/banned you get recruit at the end when it gives you a random operator.
---

Looks like Walter if he was still in Aegis
---
I was hoping that his elite would have cargo short-shorts
---
I've had games where 2 people tk'd us and were trying to throw. After round one they couldn't hurt us and we went on to win the matches. The old system they would be able to knock us down to 1hp.
---
Bandit?
---
I kinda like these better...It annoys me that Mute has two filters but Smoke has one while both their icons have two
---
Ela, valkyrie, kapkan, finka are all ops i Come across quitte often using their shotty's with only pistol as back up
---
He looks like an Asian Ben Stiller
---
No. It has the same problem as the new Hereford Base. It's a large maps with rooms that all look the same.
---
c l a s s i c
---
The graphics are great, it's not pay to win, as everything can be earned and all operators are balanced except for tachanka, who is by far the best and is free. 
---
He's probably salty about getting trashed by someone with an elite skin.
---
I think that post was made by someone who has very little understanding of the game.
---
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes.
---
I won didn’t I?
---
&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bve92e/siege_is_pay_to_win_prove_me_wrong/
---
basically he thinks that if you have a new op you have a higher chance to win
---
and since new ops can be unlocked via a season pass it must be pay 2 win
---
The map is V E R Y attacker friendly, with less space for defenders to work. I personally LOVE defending, but when on fortress, the map is all hallways and weird angles that can only be accessed by attackers, and I feel uncomfortable in such close quarters. A map rework with more space might make more sense.
---
pmm is the best pistol ingame after the deagle
---
Definitely not true. A lot of people find having all the time and work they put into the game to get good to be invalidated by some shitter because "hacks" insulting. 
---
Actual hackers in my experience just don't say anything. Or just say "ez"

I can see that. I prefer to play both ranked and casual. Ranked is where I focus and test myself on the things I've been practicing (like good habits). Casual is where I tryout the new ops or ops I don't play much or even guns that I don't use a lot like the BOSG.

SLAVIC SOMALIAN PIRATE

“*the sea is serbja*”
---
Twitch's looks like a drone full of electricity instead of a skull with Rhinestone Eyes (are like factories far away)
---
Ela's also looks better.
---
Ohh thanks
---
Is this happening on pc? Because I’m experience similar issues as well. The audio either goes too low or completely goes silent.
---
it happens on all platforms
---
Pmm deals way more damage so aslong as you can hit shots its straight up the superior pistol.
---
The ching chong smoke icon looks so much better
---
Ah yes, captain cargo shorts of the Lego dropping clan.
---
Everyone I know who dislikes it said that it is too defender friendly so I honestly dont know what to believe at this stage.
---
Ah hope they fix this ASAP.
---
Maybe
---
What mechanics do you want to be represented while shooting bots?
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Top tier maymay
---
le lego
---
this is one the best case scenarios wouldnt you agree? this is when RFF is used like its supposed to and players dont TK the one with RFF. But is it really what happens regularly?
---
This are just leak tho, looks real because we got this leak before the leak that confirm that we will have lesion and smoke elite, but the developers can change it
---
Believe me, I gave casual a big chance. But keep getting put up against higher skilled players. Match making sucks in casual.
---
Orrrrr he could just play, save renown and buy them with that every season, y'know, like me and many others do every season...
---
Baffled.
---
I was expecting a skyrim meme
---
Good job Disabling the defuser!
---
I'd be fine with the smoke and twktch icons tbh
---
While Macros are banned in ESL and therefore ProLeague, Ubisoft themselves have never really given an answer as to if they consider Macros cheating.
---
They have however in the past reduced the way macros can affect the game and therefore their effectiveness.
---
They capped DMR fire rate to combat DMR Click Macros.
---
They also reduced crouch spamming.
---
Ahhh, i see.  Sorry for the misreading. Read it when i first got up so that's likely why. But still Ela's pretty bad.
---
You need a really fast connection to server hope since you’re pinging a server that’s much further. Like I’m on fibre optic
---
They should've just make an epic soccerdady skin.
---
I’ve just played the 10 rounds to get my new rank  for this season and played attack every single game. Which kinda sucks because I’m better at defending. Silver 1 though.
---
Instead of saying what everyone else is already saying, I'm giving him advice so he can improve.
---
Im 160 and I only have one black ice, they’re pretty rare man
---
No, he goes by the name of Mr.Banme nowadays
---
Exactly!
---
From a year ago. Mate I'm a secret fan, we were the kings of sky, but its a dogshit map for uncoordinated teams. You actually need to coordinate your defenses to make almost every defense viable.
---
Idk why but that skin reminds of the doom marine
---
😂 imagine a world where any of your teammates even pick 1 out of IQ/Thatcher/Thermite
---
If people are going to refuse to use mics, this seems like a must ad to me.
---
When i go on defence he freezes it until the prep time is over and then rush us. 
---
I met this guy twice.. it was him
---
This is so sad
---
Chill out bud, in my opinion they need to work on their servers. Don’t be acting beast mode queer.
---
You cant hack on Ps4
---
iron chen
---
Dude he’s actually from space
---
Im nearing the 300 mark.... I feel your pain a little bit.
---
Ranked should always be a mode that requires mic communication. You dont need as much comms in other games such as Apex so they give more text based options. Yellow ping indicates location that you are pointing at, red highlights the location of an enemy. 
---
Has been the same since day one and I see no problem - this would only benefit players too stubborn to communicate. 
---
Even when we consider disabilities of people who are dumb (unable to physically talk) and those whom have no mics. They have yet to incorporate colour blind mode, so their care for ease of access is beyond the minimum. 
---
The only way that they would make this a thing is if there were enough keys and buttons to assign them to, hence why console does not have lean out of ads as an example, simply due to button limitations.
---
Thanks for the reply. I am am just confused if it is your highest rank achieved or where you finish.
---
In thr patch notes it says: "Moving forward, we will reset MMR between the “middle” (2500 MMR) and your rank from the previous Season."
---
This sounds like it is where you finished at the end of the season.
---
Just a reminder that we almost got these icons in the western version too. We can change things when we say it loud enough. We could also get Ubi to use a less intrusive monetization system.
---
I understand your point, although idk about intel gathering. I think it's more like, in order to use it to its maximum effectiveness, you need to have intel first. I think it insentivises good drone work and patience. A lot of things have to go right in order for the dogs to work well, and it wouldn't be luck based. Hard to use? Sure, but I think it would be a fun and refreshing addition to the game.
---
I'm just wondering how the game came to that number specifically
---
Who are you, Marley?
---
I think this is a ddos its 2 -0 and no kills 
---
I can show you the defense prep round if you want to see it
---
The base ops were all unlocked for everyone, so why not the others, I feel it this happened in any other game like COD everyone would jump on the hate train but it's OK to lock an essencial part of the game behind a huge amount of renown or a Season Pass in Rainbow, I just don't understand why that is, I feel this is a scummy practice by Ubisoft to milk the players
---
Like, for free? When they can charge for it instead? Ha!
---
i told a buddy of mine that putting indestructible cams on barricades made the barricade unbreakable by shooting and melee. its like in that movie where the monks taught that one guy wrong on purpose as a joke.   
---
i always forget about it because he so rarely plays operators with cams, but every now and then in the thick of it he pulls the trick out and i get a good laugh.  
---
with the new changes coming in for shields and glaz, etc, im brain storming some thing else to teach him
---
I think he meant ddos
---
The onion jack is better
---
(i know it union jack its just a pun dont bully meh)
---
Fire rate is the same on both guns, recoil is pretty laser like for both, PDW also has the benefit of faster ADS times, (and better long range damage, not that it matters practically)
---
It really is a toss up of personal preference between the two guns.
---
Even the Chinese Smoke icon is kinda goofy but you gotta appreciate how it has the correct number and direction of the gas filter.
---
blackbeard and ella look horrible jesus christ

Duuuude, I should take my broken controller and make it into a Gingerbread cotnroller

What does China have against skulls? Like chill it's just some calcium.

She’s fun
---
100 bucks is a lot
---
Shes a good fragging operator. If you're an ash player then she's definitely a good choice. I'm not a fan of the primary weapons, but they work and the deagle is op now
---
There’s random games and YouTube videos on accuracy! I used to play on a 5 year old gaming pc lmao I feel your pain. If I lose a fight, I comfort myself with the fact that they probably have a better pc than me :P 
---
What helped me: 
---
- When moving, aim around corners where heads will be. (Sounds silly but I used to run looking at the floor) same goes for angles, aim where their heads will most likely be. 
---
- sound queues (walking, drones, sound of reloading/opening cams, etc.). Really helps when there’s a little time left. 
---
- map knowledge will trump aim in most battles, as well as self/game awareness (if your angle is too wide, common run in spots, across map angles, etc.) 
---
The game can be janky but it’s really fun, and getting kills is useful, but I think staying alive and having good call outs is more important to the team. Also, being positive and having a good, resilient mind set when playing will make the game more enjoyable. It’s also good irl lmao. Keep track of mile stones and small improvements to keep yourself motivated! Do your best and don’t let toxic people get the best of you! :)
---
He was letting mira check him out
---
She is pretty good, but you must have a suppressor in fmg, so always aim for head. (obviously) She is pretty good. Is she the only op you have left?
---
I mean, this picture cuts off before I can see the alleged pants. He’s probably still wearing cargo shorts.  
---
And if they are pants, they’re probably travelled zip offs.
---
I wish that were grounds for getting banned. For some reason people now go in ranked and use a macro to simply be AFK there. I mean... just why?
---
This is the album cover, but what’s the title...
---
Honestly it depends what rank you play at. Personally I think she is more effective at higher ranks as people generally use cameras more often so you get more use out of her ability. At lower ranks people generally use cameras less so she has less of an impact
---
Asian solid snake

I don’t think every level cause then we would start getting way too many duplicates but maybe like every five levels would be nice

How did you do this, I would love to make one myself

I like the helmet, not so sure about the reflective visor. Easy headshot target
---
So you're droning out with your good buddies the other daaaay...

You anger me but good for you.

Yes blue bröther
---
My guess, because I know a bit about that stuff in china. (see above).  
---
The Ministry of Culture could interpret that the knife and the sewed together face are some kind of ritual that promotes superstition in some way.   
---
That is the thing with her face camo. For us, she just puts a skull make up on her face, but the Ministry of Culture could see this practice as some kind of superstition.  
---
The law forbids:   Anything that violates China’s policy on religion by promoting cults or superstitions. "   
---
In some way, her camo could even be seen as promoting a cult.  
---
Those laws have a lot of room for people to interpret depending on the person.   
---
And instead of waiting for what they need to change, they change everything that could violate laws like this to get an approval as fast as possible.  
---
Time is money, especially on the CN Gaming market.  
---
Because using VPN to play those games in western Servers is very common in China.
---
Can do, give me a bit, he’s got all sorts of comments and shit stringing the story out. He’s also changed the story 3-4 times. Basically what I’m saying is he’s made it a long, drawn out tale
---
I got 4 black ice. All for eh guns for most people but I love them.
---
that's the same setup I'm playing. Works wonders :)
---
No, the person was meleeing the window and he took it down, so he got meleed. Just unlucky
---
I don't understand what happened
---
They said it was designed for tanks
---
It's chance based which maps everyone in the lobby/party has played recently
---
If there’s one thing I’m unsure about her it’s that I feel her hit box is to big headshot seem easy on her from my experience of shooting her
---
Good riddance

Cool, maybe the pro league players will bitch about more stuff in game that the community likes and get it changed for the 1%. Cant wait...

They are queuing with coppers/low levels to play against easier opponents and get Diamond easily.
---
Yes?
---
PC is definitely easier to learn, but it's a tougher learning curve. On console everyone sucks, you can't flick or make any quick plays without compromising your accuracy (cranking sensativity). So if you want both I recommend pc first, then console. You will have an advantage that way
---
From this day until my last I will now refer to terrorists as “terries”

So... exactly like ying just without the while blind part

Now I'm sad

That really only works for low levels though. I’m lvl 150 and it takes forever to level up once never mind 5 times.

To be honest when the screen went white in thought it was going to cut to skyrim and I was about to down vote so hard I would have cracked my screen.

The sad part is he announced he was having jaw surgery right after I made this.

Her Candela does make slight explosive sounds yes, but I'm talking about more like specifically designed distractor noises. Even it were like cymbals clashing or obnoxious music.
---
That's...kinda what it is
---
Was in the test server when this map was released.
---
Yes, but, as a console player, they better not cross console and pc, or I'll never win again
---
Then why did blood come out
---
But it's a full minute (and 30 sec I think) after the round started...
---
Fair enough my dude. But I prefer the hacker free zone better
---
i’m sure they added some but I haven’t seen anyone talk about new legendarys they’ve gotten so we gotta wait to see

It was 3 v 5 too. Idk why you wouldn’t want a 4th player

Well I just restarted my game and was greeted with a different prompt, telling me that I could reconnect to the game I left with no penalty. But that was three hours ago. I think my siege is just messed up

jager with a assault riffle, thats a 2 speed 2 armor. thatd just increase his pick rate
---
They said you could not make it more bigger and more accurate.
---
Chinese Zachary Levi?
---
What's your aspect ratio? This looks way better than mine
---
Should have just made it Legos smh
---
Pre fire
---
If they were losing maybe they just wanted it to end
---
Uh oh someone's upset. You obviously don't have a life if youre bitching about some random persons post. And you've had this app for over 7 years... lol
---
If they were losing they may of just wanted the game to end quicker
---
Again with China’s stupid and unnecessary censors. Fuck the PRC
---
Those two are different tho
---
Gold is the average player. So most shouldn’t have an issue reaching it.
---
Jesus that pistol fire
---
I mean it would have made more sense if it were a PMM but I mean
---
What's the point of playing if you cant lose
---
I think thats the outrage they were trying to avoid with this one, cause the concept seemed to be a bit taller off of the ground
---
No they were winning I seriously don’t know why
---
I have a budget right now tbh but I will be upgrading to it in a few months time. I was suggested not to but a budget is a budget. I've heard all your answers and screenshotted them for further use thankyou guys so much you've helped me out big time here ❤❤❤
---
Yeah, I'm not too sure how many cheaters I've come across while playing, but it does seem like certain people are ungodly quick with their aiming which I suppose would indicate that they're using mnk? But that wasn't as big of an issue as the ridiculous behavior by, I'd say, the majority of console players that play this game. Plus Ubisoft doesn't really seem to care too much about it. That reverse friendly fire feature that they added was so useless. I suppose you can say they're trying, but I think they're beyond the point of caring. As long as they're ripping people off for gaudy elite skins and half assed season passes, they're happy as can be.
---
I love the “holy fuck” at the end. Very accurate reaction😂
---
The entire game needs a rework and overhaul.  New or update the engine, network, graphics, they better have an entire team working on something to it looks like a fresh new game on the next consoles
---
me
---
Bot?
---
Shark?
---
Maybe they didn’t like your username 😂
---
I actually like this Elas icon more than blackbeards, I mean wth is that even?
---
I have similar setup with the same gpu and i run in 1080 high without any problems.
---
level 137 and just barely got gold 4
---
No new legendaries this season. It seems like they are adding them every other season, so expect something new in the next one.
---
because they're losers and want to feel a little bit of power in a video game.  they're just toxic ass hats
---
New challenger approaching:MeatyMarley
---
Yeah I agree that this elite gadget is not that great, I guess I was making a general statement about operators gadgets getting a rework for their elite
---
Look at Frosts gadget for example, it looks cool as a elite skin, but it could be argued that it is way more visible and thus changing gameplay
---
I thought it's R6 Siege subreddit.
---
For only playing for a couple weeks... you are very good. Ur movement and game sense is on point for some one new. Keep grinding and this game will be very fun.
---
Happened to my squad and me on pc too..... this season is fubar
---
You are switching topics. Why? 
---
I hate to break it to you but input devices different from a controller are as nornal on consoles as they are on PC. So I dn't get where your way of thinking comes from. Steering wheel users? Cheaters. Arcadestick? Cheaters. Lightgun? Cheaters. VR? Cheaters. That is your way of arguing.
---
People can use an OFFICIAL INPUTDEVICE  in R6. That's not cheating. People just get upset because they lose and they do not want to buy a better suited input device. That is their problem.
---
Yiu already noticed yourself that your argument is build on a completely artificial construct you made up yourself in your mind. The thinking that console means you can only use controllers. That is not reality
---
Hell yes. He’s a piece of shit. Get him banned, teach him a lesson.
---
Pros: add some realism and immersion, such as when you fatally hit someone with a knife you reach forward and jab it in their neck or something
---
Cons: that takes up about a second or two during which someone can paint the wall with your brains
---
Maybe 👀
---
Maybe we need another roamer, but don't count on it since Ubi has been doing a lot to make roaming less effective. Nomad, Gridlock, and Nokk are all pretty heavy anti-roam so a new roamer would need to be heavily designed for that role and that role almost exclusively.
---
Fuck Bartlett
---
Great idea
---
Why ruin Jager just to give way to another roamer just because of speed rating? Is Jager that much of a problem for you?
---
While I understand what you're getting at... They turn invisible anyways ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I feel like they should've just sent it and go with the fancier design instead of just adding rust.
---
They didn’t want to get 360 proscoped
---
Spectator error
---
Might need more RAM
---
Nothing like a textbook bandit trick to start my mornings. Thank you OP
---
If a hacker dos's the server at 3-1 when we are winning. Does the system implement anything or rollback any elo or count us as an abandon?
---
How would zofia help? She’s a soft breacher
---
&gt;german [...] unused nation
---
Hmmmm.
---
But on a more serious note, all four upcoming operators will have different and previously unused nationalities.
---
First of all you are already risking yourself enough when you are knifing in the game. I don't think animations would be any better. Knifing should be rewarded because you are meleeing in a shooter game where everyone has a weapon.
---
If you’re playing solo, you’ll do best to pick operators that can assist your teammates. But don’t forget to pick sometimes just cause you feel like it. As far as what to work on, just keep playing and you’ll find out. Aim, map layouts, operator quirks, you’ll get it all with time.
---
Big oops
---
What about Pulse’s
---
id be fine with battlefield knife animations
---
Hmmm, I play on Xbox, and have a smurf. My smurf didn’t buy the game, just my main. My smurf didn’t have all the default ops, but my main did. Idk how it happened.
---
Realistically, flash bangs are so powerful closing your eyes won't help too much
---
The kill cam is fucked up he didn't see you stand but he probably heard you get on your phone
---
Cheers mate you've been a real hero. Reddit&gt;Google because of you my friend 😂❤
---
🤔
---
Start with using simple ops, like Rook on defense, you'll want to use ops with gadgets that are kind of place and be done gadgets, play t-hunt to learn the maps and overall just try to simplify the game as much as possible
---
 seems like a gun barrel inside a shark, on the other hand bb's original icon is a smaller gun barrel inside a vampire skull, so who the fuck knows what it supposed to represent.
---
Well good thing this isn't an American school...
---
that con in my opinion is a pro for the game as a whole
---
Make a cousin match, or t-hunt solo and warm up before you start playing online, like stretching before a run. It helps me.
---
Stun rounds cancel wire placement IIRC, or at least make it hard to hear which panel is there. Plus, ya know, damage rounds.
---
I didn't say it was nothing but luck, I said it was luck more than anything else. Completely different. Also because of the way I expressed it, now you surely remember it. ;)
---
I sorta got an ace my 2nd day playing (last 3 guys ran out on me and one downed his teammate) and a random teammate invited me to party up. Proceeded to go 1-5 my next 3 games and leave out of shame. Sometimes you just have a hot round.
---
I like it, I will say though, the text needs to be either a different colour, or have more contrast. Other than that, it's great!
---
Lol everyone that uses cheats is always terrible. They never bother learning the game, they mad cuz they’re bad so they use cheats. Seri, they’re all dogshit if you ever see them actually play the game like decent people and not lonely fatass virgins who sit in their moms basement all day hacking.
---
Yeah for realism and imo it’s a pro but I know everyone would bitch about it
---
I dont like you putting 2 bandit batteries on that garage door
---
Stamina system like CSGO.
---
You know that the GSG9 is bassicly the german FBI and that warden is american and clash isnt
---
I rly hope that something like this will happen since most of my friends who are playing r6, are doing it on pc
---
I almost expected him to transform into a car and drive away. He is a Transformer now.
---
This is the absolute worst. Already happened twice to me today.
---
Nicely done!
---
LOL imagine hacking and still having to DDOS because you aren't even good enough with hacks
---
thanks homie
---
So nothing...
---
imagine hacking and ending up in 4-4 overtime and then ddosing the servers because you’re dogshit and cannot live with it
---
Tachanka Memes in 2019 btw

Just don't listen. He is just mad that he got killed. 
---
Obviously there are times where I've come against full 5 stacks running full on strats in casual, and at that point it just confuses me to why people do it. That is what I'd class as tryharding in casual.
---
Didn't even think about that. True tho!!!
---
What is the point of this post?
---
Yeah it depends on whether they want it to be a royalty ornament AND a weapon, or just a mark of royalty.
---
There's nothing you can do to "react" to an interrogation, unless what you're implying is that you're one of those toxic aholes who leave before or mind interrogation.
---
144 and my one friend has been better than me since he was 30. Still is and is nkw a higher level. He got the game a year after me
---
Macie had a video showing the same problem with blitz shield blocking someone from entering the window, the shield can (maybe only) be moved by a throwable like flashbang etc.
---
This is why I always go no ban
---
What beer will I be holding fine sir?
---
Ranked is bullshit anyway.
---
u/SAU-Siege
---
Yeah it's most likely that, since any and every link this game has to Tom Clancy was erased ages ago.
---
That would not increase his pick rate you doofus
---
I like this question.
---
Hmm
---
you need to think about proleague here as that's where the pick/ban choices come from, generally speaking.
---
I think laziness is the core of it. Nobody wants to deal with a blitz,etc.
---
 Looking at the pickrates you can see that none of these operators end up in "overpicked too strong". In fact echo sits right in the middle as more or less balanced.
---
Additionally, these operators are easily sacrificed for the greater good. Banning blitz removes a shield and a mobile flashbang from your team but also prevents you from having to plan around him Banning twitch means that she's unusable despite being incredibly useful and flexible so nobody wants to ban her.
---
That's why hard breachers are rarely banned, their mechanics aren't "annoying" and they're critical for both teams.
---
That's something we are not gonna talk about 😉😉

CS:GO uses relays to connect to the game server, rather than connecting directly. That way the game server IP says hidden and if a relay gets attacked, it can be switched to a new relay in a matter of seconds.
---
Tracking individuals is way out of the realm of realistic possibilities. Not to mention Ubisoft has zero interest in prosecuting individuals.
---
😂😂😂😂😂 that's a good one
---
good tip, will do
---
Only touch him if he’s too strong after an op in introduced to help jäger out (with a similar gadget). If he’s then too strong, no one can argue for a nerf
---
That’s a lie
---
Well, this has officially showed me I don’t want to keep pushing from my current plat 2. I already had this happen once, I was on the DDos team though, so we won. I feel terrible about that win and wish I could message them. Ranked on console (and pc) is terrible right now.
---
Maverick’s base paint for his weapons are actually pretty cool too, I like them better than the skins you can put on them

---
But how big of a loser do you have to be to buy cheats for video games? 
---
Are they that bad that their only hope is cheating?
---
Or are they just that pathetic?
---
I just realized imagine if they implement where you can reinforce two walls with barb wire and a battery on the barb
---
So should we take maps away from casual? There's different levels and just because a dev right 'competitive' doesn't mean he's thinking pro league.

I’ll take all of your stock
---
Yes sir
---
I just think they need to find a way to make his gadget more consistent, and less so luck based. Currently you go above subjective, pop the charges and hope you get an enemy. 
---
They need a way to make the chances higher without directly buffing the stats of his gadget. I’d suggest a camera on the end of the cluster charge. When punctured, he can see around and pop it whenever an enemy is nearby
---
pointless post with shitty screenshot
---
jagers high pickrate is because he has a solid gun, with a reliable gadget. you give jager more health and youre telling me his pickrate goes down?
---
They probably need to nerf Jackal.
---
I think a common-sense way to do this would be to reduce the number of pings his scans generate by one, and to remove his visor's ability to see footprints after all scans are used (Or to give it a cool down so you can't just walk around with it on all the time, or spam scan three defenders all at once).
---
Alternatively they could tweak his kit a bit to make it less versatile: remove his smokes and/or the sidearm shotgun.
---
There are just too many options for how to play him effectively.  I'm not surprised he's being routinely banned.
---
1. you can do everything the game allows you to do.

Someone who drones in casual, treats it nearly the same as ranked, picks operators that they already have 20 hours with, kill people when the Rook armor is being offered to the attackers etc.
---
Me and the Boys getting banned every phase
---
Thatcher main here 👋 I also frequent thermite.
---
Every 5 levels be nice so there could be a grind. Idk why Ubi hasmt implemented this to reward players like OW you get a crate every time you level up.
---
If they make it so echos drone doesn't stop a plant it would balance the game
---
Yeah its really important
---
And expensive
---
It’s a crazy suggestion I know, just would be interesting lol
---
He said no but did it amyways
---
Someone said before to reduce how long the footsteps show. As of right now they're 90 seconds, half a round. I can totally see it being reduced to 30.
---
That means Electric wakeup in Portuguese
---
Just uninstall R6S, problem solved.
---
No u
---
Rip bro. They couldn’t handle the skill.
---
oh, i didnt realize that, thanks.
---
(i also didnt realize you were a mod)
---
There will be now way to change that without taking them their roles away.  
---
The reason why they are banned are simple-  
---
Jackal: He is a Roamer hunter and he is good at it. The only thing that would be possible would be to reduce the time of the footprits down from 90seconds to maybe 45seconds. But this would not change it outside of high ranks.  
---
To get him out, you would need to take away the whole tracker, which would just erase him.  
---
Blitz: He is quite strong in a 1v1, but is weak in a 1v2. But many people who play Roamers don't work with the Team or the other Roamer. They are annoyed that they can't just jump right in front of him alone and spray him down with a Scorpion.  
---
To get him out, they would need to take the whole flashing Shield away, or make it impossible for him to use the gun and the shield at the same moment. So he would just be a weaker Monti in the end.  
---
Caveria: She is quite similar. She is good against team, who never work together, who never drones, a team containing 5 lone wolfs.   
---
She just needs to pick theone of the pack and punishes the whole team for being selfish lone wolfs.   
---
Her interogation is a Meme in the Pro League, because of good communication and everybody working together. I think the only interrogation ever done in the Pro League was when she was super new to the game and it happened just once. After that, there was never a second interrogation in the Pro League.   
---
To get her out...you see the Problem, they would need to make people play together...all of them.   
---
It would be easier to get a team of 5 Chimpanzees into the pro league, than turning those lone wolfs into teamplayers, who drone and communicate.
---
And not droning or making call out is not just typical for low Ranks like Bronze. I have this Problem even on high Gold. They start to think, they became to good to use drones. Or they are to greedy and don't want to lose a frag...because K/D.  
---
Echo: Like other people said, taking away one Yokai turns him into a Rook without plates or a Doc without the Stim. One Yokai made Echo players play like the use Doc or Rook.  
---
To get him out...well basicly they would need to turn the Yokais into just Valk Cams that can move around, which would basicly turn him into a quite forgetable Operator.  
---
If we want to change something, people would need to ban with a strategy and not just for personal comfort.  
---
Cav gets banned of paranoia, because 5 randoms will see each other as the lone wolf, who ends in her claws.  
---
Blitz gets banned, because random Roamers tend to be greedy and don't want to share a frag.  
---
Jackal, he can be tricky, but his Gadget can also make people blind in some way. They see their target and often forget that there are other players on the way.  
---
Echo...well...it is Echo.  ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Yeah even the one quote about it is clipped off at the start??
---
Everyone would go for higher speed over higher armour and if you don’t think that, you’re wrong. Speed is king in this game and has always been the meta at all levels of play (apart from pro play). 
---
Jäger is strong because of a fantastic weapon, great gadget and the 3 speed. If you change one of his pros, to effectively make it work, it’s a nerf. 
---
This is in no way a buff whatsoever, if he were to become a 2 speed. Not saying I disagree but I am saying that it would be a definite nerf
---
*cpt. Price sees this skin*
---
How did a muppet like you pass selection?
---
Glitch has been in the game for some time now. They thought they took out the ability to do it but they didn't.
---
stay there
---
We saw it we have eyes
---
I only have glaz's rifle black ice and both his sidearms (:(
---
I was a Jackal main, but I stopped that so I could ban him, TBH. I really hate playing against him.
---
React as in callouts.
---
Damn how many hours do you have logged?
---
Especially since there’s a Lesion on every defense all the time nowadays.
---
Its also good to place more than one because if a teamate goes to pick him up they also get clapped.
---
With the occasional lesion
---
Oh. I knew about the other one and thought this might be a new one. Apparently people are still shifty and abuse the game just to win.
---
I think that and/or make the deployment much faster and quieter, allow him to place them all at once then detonate (could use alt Fire selection button to change between place another/detonate placed charges).
---
Or maybe make the pucks detonate automatically when near a defender, as right now even if one lands right in your lap you have plenty of time to run away before it explodes
---
Exactly. It was actually my friend answering for me because they know I primarily use shotguns.
---
Im not sure why, but these kinda creep me out/make me uneasy
---
they should slide Lion and Finka/Alibi and Maestro up next to the base ops so it goes from 2 and 2 to just one of each
---
Pathetic
---
All great points. I guess I hate lesion because you don’t have to be on a cam to use him. Throw a lesion down some stairs and as soon as you hear it go off pop around the corner and get an easy kill. Or think you’re pulling off a sneaky flank and boom lesion goes off and they know exactly where you are. He gets 8 of the damn things!! But I understand and mostly agree with all your points.
---
I’m really shitty with Audio and all of that stuff. I use headphones and i have it set to hi fi is that why it sounds weird?

No. Fuck off. Clash bad

Main echo, can confirm.

Yeah. Ive really only mained siege since the start of wind bastion but yeah, thats when the game started sucking.

Yeah the title "rework" wasn't deserved
---
Lmao, this game wasnt esports 3-4 years ago 
---
It was fun, 
---
But your right it is NOW a esports game for sure
---
Honestly, just played in a ranked with a 5 stack of 4 plats 1 and 2 while the 5th was a copper 3 while my team was silvers and low golds
---
They should hand them out retroactively too so I'd have like 200 packs and still get nothing but common charms out of them. That'd be fun.
---
Fair enough
---
Played some people that lag switched all three rounds my team attacked so that no one could move. So the timer just ran out and they won. Then on attack they would hit the server as soon as they started planting so no one could move or shoot them but they could still plant. Then same thing, hold the server until the defuser time goes off and they win. People seem to be getting better at it or something because I’ve never experienced that. I only ever experienced the ones that hit the server if it looks like they’re about to lose.

No it’s fucking not fun Bartlett was fun all they need to do is remove some windows and it’s great
---
I think he currently only gets 7 and he only is allowed 2 preround. He’s just a fairly basic operator that can easily be mastered. The only issue with him is that he is easily countered. I found numerous mines when I’m droning around. Just look under barricades and in doorways and high traffic areas. Once you’ve trained your eye to find them without IQ he’s isn’t as good. Usually Lesions will rely on the intel the mines provide and if you’re ahead of the curve destroying them, then you now have the jump on the lesion and can easily enter a room and take someone by surprise.
---
Ur not crazy, ur bad, u play casual seriously
---
Just because they're better than you does not mean they're diamond or platinum...that's some real elitist thinking you got there son. If this is triggering you this hard, best stop playing now. It only gets worse.
---
There has been no public announcement from what I've seen \^\^\^
---
Oh god oh fuck oh fuck
---
I think it should be like every five levels. If every time someone leveled up and is like level 150 they probably would have a skin for every gun
---
I've had the same issue since the start of Year 4 Season 1 and from what Ubi support has told me they are aware of the problem happening in specific regions, but there is unfortunately no ETA on when this issue will be resolved. We'll just have to wait until its fixed.
---
Bartletts issue is entry points. A single door with windows scattered and a single roof hatch. The sites weren’t good but they were manageable.
---
Favela is so far in the other side of the spectrum. So much of the map is destructive and you can make entrances and exits to the building and sites in so many places. 
---
I guess it depends on playstyle

---
Valid points, just not enough to tie them together. Not gonna lie though, it’d be cool if Jackal had a visor like that ;)
---
But those have to extend first and he'd have enough time to run away
---
Spoken like a true copper. For those of us who are actually good at video games, we like to actually be able to play them, instead of being booted from the server because we're better than the other team
---
Maybe one day...
---
 Hibana, jackal, buck, and twitch
---
Because getting pinged all match is annoying and he has one of best guns in the game.
---
Believe it or not I actually think I received a positive change due to my reporting.  
---
I had (in my opinion) pretty sufficient video evidence.  
---
My first night of placements I finished 2-2.  One loss was a legit ass beating, and the other was due to DDoS.  I checked the new ranked hub after the ddos lost, saw 2-2, got sad, and stopped for the night while I filed my support ticket.  
---
Next day, I log on, and check the ranked hub after receiving the "thanks but we wont tell you shit else even though you were directly affected" email.  I was now 3-1 in my placements.  
---
So yeah, I'm 99% positive they listen when you have sufficient evidence.  But I completely agree they need to say anything at this point.
---
It was from the start what the fuck are you talking about? Don't even give me the 1IQ "actually it was made as a hostage rescue game" as if before it even released it was already changed to a comp 5v5.
---
Yes, you must main him now
---
It’s been nice here the past couple of days. Last week was worse.
---
Every ranked game I play it's Montagne, Blitz, Lesion and Caveira getting banned.
---
It's literally just moving a slider in Substance.
---
Mines fine
---
Alright, thank you
---
9 more ops to go level 45 haven’t spent any money on r6 credits
---
Well it’s a soft reset so if you have copper 4’s in your lobby it’s because you were that low in the last season
---
I think it’s a Velvet Sky Seasonal Skin but I can’t remember the exact name.
---
Dude literally every ranked game I've played has been those 4 ops getting banned. Its silly. Every match its always the same. My one friend was absolutely obsessed with siege and now he cant stand logging on. Which is sad.
---
LMGs

Because you've got a bullet with their name on it, and you're not going to stop firing until you find it.

No regerts

I like her as a character in the siege universe but hate her as an operator in general.
---
I got the exact same thing on my stats no clue why
---
the bomber probably afraid of my charm
---
Its like a shiny pokemon
---
Ik, but that is where you can play it.  Bro, it is an online thing with other people!
---
No
---
It really is, especially if you turned him into the game. I feel bad for anyone who just joined the community. They'll never experience what supreme ranked was like
---
You still may have won but that doesn't mean they didn't begin at an advantage with the 3-0
---
Yeah everyone whos just now joining doesnt know how much fun it used to be. God i used to binge siege for hours. Now i cant stand one match.
---
Its actually just as bad in Gold, if not worse at certain times. Because G3 to G1 one is where all the Smurfs and people Rank Exploiting in parties tend to end up.
---
I don't know is she? Could you check the 20 other posts on this?
---
Team communication is really really important but if they aren't giving information and just blaming the game as a reason to why they died or just calling cheats left right and center with no proof you are probably better off just muting them. Focus on learning the maps and where players usually hide
---
/peek from and prefire to make sure that IF there is someone there you aren't the one dying to a headshot. That is unless you want to be  sneaky but sounds are so important that if you are stepping just slightly they will 97% know that you are coming from that certain location so I usually just run and gun peeking corners where I predict where someone will be but I do that after droning the room/hallway I'm entering. I'm just a gold 1 player so my tips might not work for everyone but for me they are as I climbed from copper 1 to gold 1 in 3 months of playing the game.
---
Got it thanks
---
That kid not shutting up was classic
---
It not winning or not that is the problem. It's just getting that advantage.
---
He teleported twice. Once to crouch and again to prone.
---
They’re back I think. I was in a game and everyone’s ping jumped to 1700 lol and then it said no connection to rb6 servers
---
I'm getting some apex vibes from this post
---
I mean I agree with you but ubi gotta make bank or at least some
---
yeah it is
---
I understand where he's coming from. Being in the same rank as him every ranked game is the same. Just drone 24/7 on attack and use intel to create unfair fights on defense. That is how you reach those ranks. Coming into casual i just shift+w because it doesnt matter if i win or lose. Going up against someone that treats it like ranked can then be extremely obnoxius so i get his point. Tbh if you wanna learn the game then just play ranked, casual is worthless to learn
---
I tried to get them with a breach charge but they moved, i was sad.
---
Yeah it's kinda dying for me. I find myself not wanting to play it anywhere near as long. Glad I got a whole months worth of hours in before it got worse. 
---
RIP Good siege 😔
---
But you never see 1 or 2 per round. Almost all of those operators have pick rates of 10% or less.
---
You are complaining that these guys are ruining the meta but other than lesion they are not apart of it.
---
Killed Ying though
---
yeah i do actually. but currently not this season because of how toxic the community is right now. if you want someone prevalent in the siege community, macie j and king George, both said on stream how unbalanced the 3 round system works
---
if it's so easy then why haven't they done it? they cant.
---
looks like a bio-hazard suit with armor
---
I like hibanna her ability is a soft breach which makes rectangular holes in reinforced walls her gun is good too
---
In the time he did all of that you got one round off.  It wassnt that bad drop acting like it was.  This gane has bullshit moments but you literally missed almost your entire magazine.
---
His scope has a 5% lower sens than regular acogs and his banana-vision makes it hard to actually hit the body of the operator and not the clothing, ubi killed him on release.
---
What region?
---
So cheating in rainbow is basically like playing rugby?
---
I mean, beefy shield boy is more useless than a man who can literally burn walls
---
Pretty sure he's taking about people ddosing to get higher ranks. So maybe chill out bud
---
I mean be honest with yourself, how often do you really see the actual gu gadget itself?
---
Yeah true
---
Got 300% recommended daily does of Siege teammates that game. Had to mute and teamkill the one guy the one round he got so bad. Shooting me with mozzie spiders. All because I told them not to ban echo since we were defending first.
---
Yup my favorite elite skin. But that shit is just so bad
---
Why would they put a new map in ranked? It’s always been like that. Except this time we know more of the layout than normal.
---
She doesn’t deal damage though, right?
---
I like encountering Clash because I can crouch spam and “dance” in front of her because in high silver, there’s no communication and when I hear her swap, I kill her.
---
Or occasionally, there is communication and I die being an asshat. 
---
Or I miss and die being an idiot.
---
Either way, 5/7 I load the game every day
---
yes
---
cav is death, blitz is war. but i cant decide who is famine and who is pestilence with jackal and echo.
---
its pretty annoying since i have to change it everytime i play a different game
---
Yeah I saw a post a while back that I think went viral, about making the Terrorist from Terrorist Hunt the new recruit elite skin. They probably won't do anything with Recruit though since they took him out of ranked.
---
Maybe change the hallways, the rooms and the spawns but they should not overturn completely like in Hereford but maybe like in Cafe
---
Agreed. It is absurd. Something is definitely happening behind the scenes.

I agree. I’m talking about the average player who plays Cav periodically. Good Cav players that really understand how to use her properly are some of the scariest players in the game. Cav in general puts a bit of fear into most players.

Okay thank you for the suggestion

Still im not sure they gonna do shit

I planted a defuser and they just watched timer finish. I love it.

---
Godamnit
---
That's stupid. 1. You get fewer packs as you play more because the score requirements increase. 2. What happens to current players? Do we get 150+ packs (based on our levels)? 
---
Instead, I suggest getting packs based on score. On average you need to win 5-6 games to have enough chance for winning a pack. Depending on the game mode, you get 20.000-30.000 score for 5-6 wins. So how about for every 25.000 score you earn you get an alpha pack?
---
Just cuz it’s always been that way doesn’t make it the right or best way tho lol.  Every other competitive game I’ve played does this right
---
Perhaps like playing rugby when the game is soccer ? Does that make sense ?
---
What gun skin is that?
---
To get team killed for picking someone’s operator ?
---
Username checks out
---
maestro takes skill and teamwork
---
So, Lesion or maestro
---
yea maybe so
---
If youre playing as Lion on Bomb, save 2 of your scans for after the defuser is placed (if at all) and protect site. Dont be afraid to push first. Most of the time when i play i forget Lion even exists if unscanned, then they hit you with scans later on and i get panicky. Go 100 hours with Lion, even if stats are crap. It takes time to get to know an operator
---
Using MK on cobsole should be punishable by death
---
I agree. Even with a top end computer, it still takes me probably 75-90 seconds to get in. An average computer is going to take a couple minutes. This guy is just an angry little south pole elf.

You cant spend money on alpha packs. They're renown only for purchase and you cant buy renown with money.
---
Download either AimLabs or Kovaaks. They have good tasks for practicing raw fundamentals of aim including reaction time. As for sens, shoot a hole in the wall, move around and track it. Play around with it and find a comfortable sens. Then set it and never touch it again.
---
Which one is better for roaming and detecting?
---
I prefer lesion for his speed, ability and loadout
---
Can we get a high level copper gang going?
---
cmon man you're making console users look bad
---
I don’t know how well maestro held up against updates and game changes. He was one of my favorites but Lesion is more fun in my mind. You can be terrifyingly good with lesion if you have good map knowledge and memories of each goo mine you threw.
---
Bruh moment
---
I don’t really see why you would have two semi auto pistols as secondaries but other than that the ideas aren’t that bad
---
you just get people who really want someone to blame for their own shortcomings, there is only one clear instance where i was right to blame the game after watching the kill cam, i've had a lot of debate-able deaths, however what annoys me the most is how much of an inconsistent player i am (it's an issue i need to sort i know) , lets say our first game i go 6 and 3 in ranked , fine that's a good score , my K/D is 2.00 for that game, next game in 4-4 and match point and i'm going 2-6 and yet , despite them only playing with me twice, once where i played well and once where i played bad , i get called crap and get kicked from the group, it's annoying, but at high gold it is understandable to some degree
---
As soon as they fix the exploits.
---
This way veterans don't get 200 packs lol
---
Better question: why do you have 3 FPS counters?
---
10fps
---
Yes
---
I have a 2080ti
---
thank you i will try
---
my god can you guys stop using this dead joke please
---
Not lag switches but a stress on your server. That's why it affects all your team.
---
Ok, batteries.
---
Also a teammate can just nitro the window and blow em allllll away
---
Then it's worth it
---
The truth is I turned my sensitivity up far too much and this was the result.
---
Ya...😪
---
It should have a helmet too
---
My bad, that was poorly worded by me. What I mean is that you should've pre-aimed that door rather than peeking while you're still looking at the wall as it would've given you more time to react.
---
I see where you're coming from, but it's completely possible that not all of those people are m+k users. There are those people, but others like myself may just be playing on 100 horizontal sens, where it could seem like a mouse flick.

I play console but press one lean button to peek, shoot, then press the same button again so yeah
---
They're fixing glitches associated with them you over reacting 2 y/o. Ubi is trying to full out fix them instead of reintroducing them and have them be broken yet again. Also, frankly you're an idiot if you think tournaments make anywhere near as much as the ingame store.
---
drop shotting clash?
---
I mean I don't disagree, but a nerf is a nerf.. No matter how small, it's still a step in the right direction..
---
This last patch sucks for me, i main lesion and jacakal, winrate went up though somehow
---
&gt;At least one is gonna appear in a match by the way the probability
---
No, they wont actually. That is not how probability works.
---
The odds of *one of them* showing up are higher than the odds of a specific one showing up but they are in no way likely to show up in any given round. There are 8-10 operators on each side who are vastly more likely to show up.
---
I’ve been playing for 2 years and this season is just so disappointing. The new ops are just recycled content and the kafe rework is not what I hoped for. And I constantly get into ranked games and I get ddosed.  This season is just terrible especially when they seem to not know how to fix things
---
Mav's M4 has the closest feel to Ash's R4C in my opinion. You also have the benefit of both operators being 3 speeds. 
---
The G36 is kind of unique in it's feel since recoil is almost nonexistent and the ROF isn't super low either. So it's pretty difficult to compare it to the other weapons but I guess it would be closer to Jackal's C7E than any of the other ones.
---
Maybe someone else will have a different or better opinion but as far as feel for the weapons those seem to be the most similar to me.
---
I like it for the most part, especially given you can vote on whether a kill was intentional or not, so accidents don't cause the debuff.
---
You could argue it should kick in after 50 points of damage, but then you'd loose the ability to vote on it being intentional, and tat would be detrimental to accidents
---
What was your process to make this?  
---
Nice job!!
---
If you’re willing to fuck up your mental health, yes
---
My disappointment is immersible and my day is ruined.
---
Woah... that's actually sounds awesome
---
Preach! New Hereford suck big dick
---
I agree with you. There's been plenty of people I've seen using controller that look just like they're using mouse and keyboard. Some people are just got tier on controller
---
Oh thank god I hated the “camper” achievement
---
Top end computer from 2008? lmao what the fuck are you chatting shit about
---
everyone loads instant and if your pc takes 75 seconds to load then it aint top end kid
---
He looks older than I thought
---
Absolutely fucking perfect lmao
---
Firstly, you panned your camera so fast that your reticle passed over her before you fired a shot. Secondly, even if she was directly to your left, why on Earth would you full body peek that? Third, due to over compensating on the first part resulted in her getting shots in you before your reticle was even on her. Nothing about this clip justifies a nerf
---
I'm down for this
---
They've acknowledged it as cheating, and one would assume they'd treat it like any other cheater, but I'm not sure how they can ban people on console for it.  
---
Like do they have to go through MS/Sony for permission to restrict access of a MS/Sony customer from accessing their game?  Is it harder to ban?  I legit dont know these questions, but I assume it cant be as easy to ban console players, otherwise we'd have battle eye and whatever.  I've also never heard of a console player being banned for rainbow for any reason.  
---
On a personal note, I've gotten over M&amp;K.  I've hit diamond twice now against these assholes just using a basic bitch controller.  I like to think my diamond charms are worth more than theirs!!!!
---
Exactly, I will however, say that the attempt for simple ops makes me feel a little better, considering the fact that they introduced a tnt cannon from Minecraft during wind bastion
---
i didn't had any ddosed game since the start of the season
---
Holy fuck. Do crouch only next
---
Oh sure, let's make Frost's elite gadget spiky, clunky, and obvious as hell when it's supposed to be a hidden in plain sight  mat, but Lesion's gadget that literally goes invisible has to be as nondescript as possible.
---
Dude it’s nothing to do with specs it’s ssd vs hhd and internet speed
---
Also thanks for not being completely hostile, I appreciate the comment not the hate ❤️
---
He probably thinks he’s better than you just because of his rank and that you shouldn’t of been able to kill him

Carry me please. I know most of the call outs for siege. Am good teammate

This. I've noticed defenders aren't holding bakery. You're way more likely to have issues attacking from freezer side.

Absolutely! I'll be in touch!

2. My god I can only dream of clutches so dam juicy
---
Casual will be casual. Since Chimera a lot has changed so I'm not sure what you want to know specifically.
---
Yeah I get something about that on the menu too. Maybe ur mother board is bottlenecking because you get less FPS in action because it can’t process as much stuff as the gpu. What motherboard or cpu do u have?
