*IMA BOUT TO HEAD OUT*
---
Oh thanks I’ve never seen this before actually
---
It literally happened two days ago, my girlfriend talked in game to relay info to teammates, ironically a girl who was on the team was like "is that a gamerrr guuuuuuuurl?"
---
I agree 💯
---
Yes
---
relateable
---
All that for a single drop of blood
---
I'm going to be honest so please don't take this the wrong way, I mean this with the best intentions.
---

---
There are A LOT of dickheads in this community, good people are few and far between. This here is just fuel for their ever burning fire. I believe no one has a problem with the picture just the choice of words for the title. Which btw it's a cool picture and nice choice of operator, Going to add a background?
---
I understand that you wouldn't of thought about this when you gave it this title but LGBT subject (I'm not adding the other 7+ odd letters because ffs that acronym just keeps getting longer every day) it's still not how do I phrase this, fully integrated into society and it's not something that can be forced like it has been the last couple of years. You can't just Thanos snap and boom everyone is happy with it, like people of colour that shit took decades for it to be integrated and there still is racism everyday.
---
So I might sound douche here, pick your audiences as you'll get shit comments like you have.
---
MP5K. The D50 should be replaced with the USP40.

Know that an ash main is always sprinting or crouch spamming, and since they removed crouch spamming they had to do something so they ran

use regular weapon sights not acog to start out with, then once comfortable with your weapons move into acog. 
---
Learn every operators ability.
---
The best advice anyone here can give is just watch videos and play to get experience. 
---
I advise once level 30 just play ranked. Casual is pointless unless you don’t want to get good at the game. Because there’s too many maps (most boring and shit) where as ranked is a smaller map pool with more interesting and balanced maps (mainly) but map knowledge is HUGE. 
---
Drones are important use them to scan a room before you enter. But don’t overuse you will learn eventually how much droning and how much listening you need to do before moving around rooms.
---
As an attacker if you see a frost on the enemy team, ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS (unless you drone or know there is 100% no trap at that door or shield barricade) look down and shoot the ground when vaulting in a window or over a shield barricade.
---
If a echo stuns you, don’t panic stand in the same spot for a second then quickly move back a bit and prone aiming at the most likely place you think he will come from and he will most likely be pre-aiming your last known position and then take him out. (Same goes for ela traps but you’d need more experience to do this as she’s a roamer and could be behind you)
---
Pick characters like rook/kapkan/doc/smoke/jager ones that have simple gadgets that won’t affect the objective room until you learn everyone’s abilities as operators like castle can not only hinder your gameplay but your team mates
---
Don’t just crouch around everywhere, run around sprint do 360 jump no scopes. You will know when to crouch and when not to by playing the game. You won’t ever learn if you are always crouching around the map. 
---
Have your crosshairs always aiming for head level if you are roaming and if you are anchoring watching a door way it’s situational well it goes for roaming too but in anchoring most people will try to crouch peak you if they know where you are in the room but they will be standing up straight lean peaking if they have no clue where you are
---
The game can be frustrating so just be patient it’s not very forgiving but is very rewarding when you get good! 
---
Have fun!

Download AimLab on steam and mess around in that. There’s also a website called something like same aim different game for transferring sensitivities.

*weird stuff*

Definitely talk to your teacher about it. You have pics showing you were working on it, and it sounds like he knew all about your project anyways from your other responses here. No teacher anywhere is going to look at this situation and say "Well you got fucked over but deadlines are deadlines so that's a complete failure". Not unless they're literally the worst teacher alive, and if they did I would just go directly to the principle/admin office and explain that your teacher is failing you for something completely out of your control. 
---
Most teachers aren't mean, they're just sick of dealing with lying asshole teens all day long. Competent teachers tend to suss out pretty quickly which students are the trouble makers and which ones are engaged and trying their hardest. If you've been working diligently and not causing problems in your class all year, no doubt you teacher is going to recognize what happened and give you an extension or work with you some how to get a different project or way to finish you grade. 
---
Teacher don't want to fail students, they will work with you to help you pass the class. The only reason teachers start being shitty to students is when they think the student is trying to screw them over or lie to them or scam them in some way, which unfortunately is a common occurrence among high school students.

I'm perfectly ok with people making comments disagreeing with this. They are entitled to their opinion and are entitled to the ability to say it. I don't really care if they hate it or love it, I just wanted to share some art I made with a community I enjoy (to a certain extent). 
---
I'm not trying to force anything on anyone. It's a simple pride picture to celebrate pride mkmth with a personal opinion on one of the characters being gay. I'm not syaing she 100% is, I'm not saying anyone who disagrees is wrong, fuck man I'm not even saying people have to like it. I'm allowed to share stuff I made for rainbow in the rainbow community. No one has to like it and they can downvote it or ignore it if they don't. 
---
I don't think I'm going to add a background this time around, too much extra work for me and I like the simple white bg in contrast with the shading and colored bits. 
---
You don't sound like a douche lol you're just trying to be helpful and I appreciate it. I don't mind getting hateful comments though, because there's always the possibility someone else might really enjoy seeing this.

Well I mean fortress and Hereford are really fucking bad along with consolate

Claymores are currently disabled due to a glitch with them
---
I would actually not even have the mp5k, I would pick something like the UMP45.
---
At the absolute worst it should be an automatic C grade to ensure a pass. Like, it *should* be a wash, the teacher should just remove the project from their grade entirely, or come up with some other project they can do instead, but at the very least you can't fail a student over something like this.
---
 If they did then my next step would be contacting the principle or even superintendent, because that would be a major PR nightmare for the school if it got out.
---
I agree with you last couple of operations had very bad maps too
---
There are surely more maps that needed a rework other than kafe 
---
Consulate for example
---
Reply to this comment when someone answers I'm also currious
---
1. Claymores are disabled due to exploits with them, so you don't get any
---
2. Majority of the players in siege use full auto, and not semi. So there's no need for goobisoft to add a pre selection. Just manually do it every round
---
I thought i'd snoop at your comment history, maybe it was 3 days ago when you said Anime Ash looked like a pedo, which I'd have to agree.
---
r/whooosh plz no downvote

so practical

much tactics

wow

I think it was a seasonal skin and you cantvget it anymore

Spot on. Must have taken weeks of work!

Yeah, it’s a shame everyone seems to be getting hung up on the LGBTQ+ side of this.

just use flash hider

suppressor sucks anyway
---
One that's not actual data. That's a picture that proves nothing. Two the scorpion is the worst weapon in game. Horrible dsmage of a measly 23 and then at drop off distance goes down to 15. It's recoil vertically is okay, but horizontally which i and other have tested is random. It isn't controllable. Just because something can headshot which the scorpion barely does and if you used it you'd know that but i doubt you do since you don't main her like i do. The guns a total piece of shit and has been overnerfed and has made Ela very weak as range is not posdible with her. She shouldnt be limited to one viable gun which is her shotgun. She also really shouldnt be given gadgets an anchor is given when she's a roamer as they don't help her in any way. And it doesn't hrlp that het mines are lackluster at best.
---
They still haven’t fixed her yet
---
[removed]
---
I agree, It’s a really shitty skin. The paid version is with camo i think, but either way it’s a wasted opportunity for an ash elite. Shitty mvp animation and shitty skin
---
Xbox gold players be like

Impressive, but even more so is the fact that you're able to play with motion blur on

REEEEEEEEEEEEE

When did we cross over with the Splintercell franchise?

Is not a good way to tell age, there are lots of women irl who have no tits and are grown women.
---
So how exactly would you have them change the map pool?  What's wrong with Fortress, Villa, and Outback that it's a problem?  Reducing the map pool (if that's what you're asking for) will just increase the likelihood of seeing maps you like less than others.
---
They aren’t balanced,
---
I agree with you, but that way people could just leave at the last round and make the friends lose less of a ranking. It would be very abusing
---
I have the Frost Division one with her Cashmere uniform and i fkn love it (tactical because of all the black and stylish) also because i loved the Division.
---
I have the Smonk headgear too, I don't use the FMG on Smonk so the skin is a waste, but i can use it on Nokk now so all good
---

Was. She was op but now their is the bullet proof cam, maestro and soon warden. I agree that she was unbalanced but now this would be balanced because of the appropriate counters.

My first was fuze at the time I was non stop playing him cause he is a simple op to play

if only monty was as thicc as thor 🤔
---
Is this some sort of casual joke I’m too ranked to understand?
---
They took her smokes away for a reason.  She was a one man army being able to just smoke-flash bomb sites and plant super easily.  Removing her smokes both reduced her potency and now requires a team-communication aspect to pull off the same strat. It’s a much needed change that should be the normal across the game.   
---
Her Lmg is super easy to control, even with an Acog.  It has pretty good damage, and decently fast reload for an lmg.  I play on Xbox and I’ve never had trouble with her gun!   
---
Her shotgun is also amazing.  Fast reload, good firerate, and good damage.

You now either have ash/granade or you need to manually breach, and enemies can easly shoot your foot while you place the charge, since you made 2 fucking straight lines and everybody in the defending team is watching there

Unfair nerf recruit he’s too op!

It really depends of you playtime, in your case is normal to have that level if you don't play much.
---
Maybe they went and got one of those ET cartridges out in the desert and just transferred it over.
---
That sounds even more fun

During this season. It could mean nothing. Honestly ranked is pretty fucked rn. It's a good start though

Gold is average
---
Kaid can't trick as well. Also his guns are weird as hell. That's pretty much it.
---
If you purchase it, yes. However, equipping Elite equips the whole set, so you cannot mic and match. Otherwise, you can own it but swap away from it at will.

This hits too close to home.

Maybe he’s that good maybe I don’t know though

Just shoot through the wall you act like a drywall is indestructible lol and no, I do this method all the time fine

That sounds awesome

How the fuck did we get here

When I’m playing badly I go room and hold an angle for the whole round lol

He will be my new main

I won’t downvote bc I believe you are right, but i dont think fighting fire with fire is best here

Yeah I only liked it because of the building aspect

Hand held battery operated portable cardiac sensors don't exist yet and need an external supply, EMPs aren't compact and portable yet as grenades and need a generator, shock dart drones aren't as small as twitch's yet, small scale anti projectile systems like the one Jäger has are far from development and for real are only "designed for tanks" and one way black mirrors take half a day to deploy and aren't as quick as Mira's.

Well, echo locators do exist, but they don't happen from a drone.

Are you sure this is Siege gameplay? this looks exactly like a Scout stealing a Heavy's Sandvich while he's trying to give it to ~~his medic or his team~~ The Enemies

are you sure? Look very closely..

How about he gets a block of obsidian
---
That's the point.
---
Once you know where they are, you either find a way to get past it, or you reroute it. That's her purpose, not just to throw you off guard (where it would be your fault), but to either provide sound Intel or reroute defenders.
---
She's op when people don't notice. Right now, she's powerful but in a better spot.
---
That's the point
---
But it has nice skins and really isn't that all that matters?
---
r/wooosh . It was a joke on his joke.
---
That’s your brain hitting the “autopilot” button. I’ve found that narrating my gameplay either to my friends or to myself, or just hard focusing every little detail helps.
---
I did this on fortress one time, cav interrogated and I was the closest one to her, so I shot the breach round at the bottom or the stairs and injured her
---
I like the Brizon as the weapon choice
---
He is.
---
Senpai will never notice you then.
---
It would of been such a good joke to have a blank room as a vigil cosplay

It's a reference to his rebellious and carefree character trait in his bio. More of a chaos bringer and rebellious person.

Nope. All i see is spooky bitch 2 (nokk)

I can't even fathom how many times peeking bank main door I've recoil killed people while aiming at someone else because they're just so grouped up

No it doesn’t. It always adds 20%

u/ctrlaltkill pointed out that claymores and deployable shields are currently disabled and that was definitely what it was. Thank you for helping though I really appreciate it.
---
The guns in the loadout usually are black and white. So i decided to make the lava bucket like that
---
Look at the ump tho that has 2 pl skins
---
They have made it clear they won’t do shotguns, with the castle/pulse pl sets they coulda done the shotgun but didn’t
---
Out of the game!!!
---
That doesn’t look like throwing. That looks like trying. If you really wanna throw in ranked just recruit rush.
---
Death cam doesn't show accurate recoil in this game.

Vigil takes rook, Cav just don\`t
---
Yeah thats the thing. Ubi's netcode programming is so shit, that clientside actions, such as firing guns, meleeing, point of views and the like make Blitz such an issue. I just think that Ubi need to reprogram their system entirely
---
I’m finding out i have the starlight outfit for vigil now I’m soo confused. i just recently made my friends ps4 acc primary on my ps4 and he has been playing this game religiously. could it be some things he purchased got put onto my account?

Just make it deafen all other noises, kinda like the stun noise of echoes and elas

Yes exactly that! But with the shield you can place them in a doorframe and then a hologram behind it, so when they enter the room/objective you’ll basically get notified
---
I wonder what the recipe is for Maestro's meatballs and sauce...
---
If you know how to play fuze is really op.

Forgot that gives them a reason for the servers dropping players multiple times out of every game I’ve played so far. my bad I’ll remember to not play on weekends now

lol get mad about it

Only Swedish people are allowed to do that. And also I recommend the Ikea meatballs. Then you gotta kill the danskjävlar.

There’s difficulty now?
---
Yeah I really dont want to buy literally all the operators again and lose all my skins and  stuff
---
maestro is a sweeaboo
---
Slang
---
Maybe next time make sure your gadget is off.
---
Think how many gadgets twitch would be able to destroy with that. That's definitely not balanced
---
Ok google, how do I upvote a Reddit post more than once?

So you're okay with this sub being filled with jokes exactly like this then? Because personally I'm not. Whenever I click on the cosplay tab, I like seeing the things that people actually put effort into it. People actually spend time and money making remarkable creations and this dude takes a picture of his wall along with countless other people who do the same exact thing and you're still defending him? You're the problem. Plus, I specifically said that the joke has been reposted. That ALONE should qualify it as a repost.
---
Pal,I have been playing since black ice and I still suck ass
---
The 3 comments above hidden gems, they deserve recognition-
---
Why is everybody more lucky than me
---
That’s a strat for sure
---
The game doesnt show every item in packs.
---
I dont see why this is a bad thing though. Good trappers will catch overconfident rushers.
---
But buck's gun is good 🤨
---
Ela’s mines look like they should
---
Imagine ACOG on the K1A
---
It really is awful that we don't get rewards.
---
She already recieved a massive buff, UBI made her look like a kawaii 3 armor
---
As much as I love these ideas in game sound is so broken that I'd prefer to get hit by the sonic ball
---
I have it, but the bad memories of everyone using that along with elephant, tiger, and the red flames kinda kills it for me.
---
This isn't wrong. This man knows whats good.
---
Id be fine with like 500 renown a level. At level 186 id get loads of it. And it would encourage me to play more
---
Ranked next season is going to be bomb only so if you usually play secure, get used to having the defuser as the main focus of the game rather than frags
---
If your bad enough to keep getting shit by a twitch drone, you should probably download aim hero or something.
---
First: Yes. Because they aren't against the rules. Gameplay is something that IS intended to be on the subreddit. Every clip that I have ever posted on here was either with the intent to showcase, discuss an issue, or raise a question. That is 100% quality content, and partially what the sub was intended for. 
---
Second: That exactly is the problem, "what the mods care about" has nothing to do with anything. People break Rule 9 literally all the time and nothing is ever done about it. That doesn't mean it should be overlooked by the rest of the community. That's the difference between my content which you claim to not be quality and his post. Even though mine might be mostly clips, they are all original clips. And they actually attempt to do things like raise awareness to issues.
---
I feel like there should be something that can monitor this kind of activity and notify law enforcement because I'm pretty sure this is illegal.
---
Delete this map.
---
Fucking article 5, bullshit
---
+It's not full auto
---
-Thats not full auto?
---
+No, this is
---
*A-10 Gun run*
---
-Dayum bro k
---
I mean, if they made it that you could destroy the drone and VIGIL WAS ACTUALLY FUCKING IMMUNE TO IT, then I’d be a bit more balanced
---
FBI OPEN UP!
---
Yeah. And thanks to the Road to Invitational, we also know the face of Lion and maybe somebody else.
---
I meant; 
---
'This is what happens when you kill trade with a terrorist.'
---
oof
---
Thunt on all solo modes at any difficulty is always gonna be 36 renown.
---
Karma
---
It’s cool! I want it (I am a lesion main)
---
This poor droney has been nerfed to oblivion already. Leave poor thing to be. I still miss the 15 zaps per drone. :'(
---
Hold up, wait a minute, somthin ain't right! She lost 3 fingers??? I thought the frostbite took only one
---
A taurus though? Are jams going to be a game mechanic?
---
shh dont let ubisoft hear, they might add it
---
When you or a teammate is trying to do a double mira and they reinforce the wrong side
---
When a teammate reinforces between bomb sites (most cases)
---
She should be back when the new season starts
---
fr
---
Very cool ideas though, I love it.
---
Unlikely for fictional gravestones in a fictional place in a fictional game.
---
When a reinforcement has been put up where you need a rotation hole
---
Did you just look up “guy in balaclava” on google images
---
Not another russian or german please... Come wih some original countries!
---
What platform are you on?
---
Not good enough.  I miss that in multiplayer, situations is nothing more than a shouting gallery, and 50% of the map is blocked off in the first situation.
---
1. If you mess up in your placement.
---
2. If you are roaming you could take down a hatch reinforcement and take the attackers by surprise.
---
3. If you want to make a rotation hole mid round to help defend an objective.
---
Gloves are also a thing.
---
How do you make the weapons the white outline?
---
To be honest, I hated playing on this map. Too many windows, too many places to spawnpeek from, most places hard to defend. And yet, now that I can't play it, I kinda miss it.
---
If I get spawnpeeked I just requeue anyways. (I mostly ever play casual) it happens too fucking often
---
alright asshole it’s better than nothing. no need to be a fucking dick.
---
are you not able to shoot down the drone? Ive been tempted to try when playing attack just to see if I can, but never actually gone through with it
---
Whats wrong with saying Doggo?
---
I downloaded a picture and traced over it.
---
Or girl you sexist cunt
---
Thats good atleast
---
Once again I’m sorry I was foolish I didn’t read the post properly. I took the assumption that a friend just didn’t come back online. I didn’t realise he had died. So I’m sorry and I hope your okay OP.
---
The resemblance is uncanny
---
Idk why they thought a linear mission based mode would be good for a multiplayer game. It should have just been a horde mode. I'd definitely hop in at least once a week.
---
Would you want to see this implemented?
---
This isn’t black and white? Your analogy of a child stealing but not getting caught is nothing like this post, it’s been up for 7 hours now, it’s gotten enough traction to be noticed by mods and if it was a problem it’d be gone. This poster, people who post things like this, people who post actual cosplays, people like yourself who post clips, etc. are allowed to post what they want when they want whether you like it or not, it’s not up for you to decide, become a head mod and maybe you can have a say in that but until then or they change a rule posts like this are here to stay and that’s fine, it’s easy enough to ignore them and just keep scrolling.
---
How'd you do that? On Photoshop or something?
---
Ill give it a shot before i crash tonight hopefully that fixes it. Appreciate you throwing out your solution to me.
---
And you think the teammate would take the reinforcement back? If he placed it wrong it will stay wrong
---
PC, I'll edit that on my post. Thanks
---
She’s not coming back until they fix her and it probably won’t be anytime soon because they put the release of the new season over the current game
---
Yea if I'm on favela or yacht and a runouts going to win the match half way through I'll do it and not feel too bad about it, but spawnpeeking as soon as the round starts fucking sucks.
---
It could be useful in a lot of cases when the whole 5 man team isn't on in ranked and the random is useless. So it is something that would add to the game to make these mistakes less costly for the team
---
A while ago I found this app called sketch and its pretty easy to use.
---
I think they need to remove skyscraper until claymores are back that map is hell
---
im still one the last one, i haven’t completed it but i still get stuck with that shit mission nearly every time i matchmake
---
I've taken it as ANY team member was able to move any reinforcement, so if someone places it wrong they can pick it up and replace it themselves.
---
Idk what the limitation would be though. I feel if anything it would take stress off the system due to having all transactions bundled into one sole tracker. But idk only they would know i guess.
---
... they’ve both had...*wuff* times..
---
That’s the thing, improvement can be made, but just making fun of people without really saying what can be improved is just an asshole thing to do.
---
Ok cool, thanks. I've been trying to out together a concept myself but haven't been able to make visuals.
---
Ah yess, the good old “report for cheating”
---
[relevant] (https://youtu.be/v6IyejLa35s)
---
That was coconut brah
---
Happened to me last night, cleared three of my teammates :(
---
Could be fucking trans or gender fluid you retarded leaf
---
No I mean how would it work because like it goes into the wall, like what would be the animation, and if you mess up that just means you weren’t paying attention
---
That makes sense. Overall, these ideas are great, and hope some form of them make it into the game.
---
No I'm pretty sure I heard get flanked say they're not going to release the fixes for the glitches at the start of next season. So we're either getting clash, claymores and deployable shields back mid season 2 or season 3
---
Mac counters a ton if you think “he can bust a little hole and destroy the ___”.
---
Then he could counter Bandit, Mira, Kapkan, etc.
---
That dog looks like he’s seen some shit.
---
Yes but I’ve often seen it for real things.
---
haha CRINGE LOL XD
---
He is an undercover agent
---
XM8 and BIZON...  Give me that shit right now!
---
One you say? It always takes whole clip from me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Totally cheating, report them to twitch with the evidence as well
---
Doesn’t smoke kinda have traps and isn’t Jäger a roamer?
---
I didn't even get to complete it on the hardest difficulty.
---
If only ubisoft read these
---
Well personally, I find it easy to hear. It has a distinct sound that doesn't blend in often.
---
he could sense the laser sights
---
Where do you place the sight? At the head? Cause it blocks the head.
---
As a Tachanka main, i’m glad when people use my turret after my death

Her left hand still has all the fingers, and its the one used for holding it, not shooting, so that wouldnt explain it.
---
The sound ball sound: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=erFcYsC6JaY
---
Makes the affected people orgasm from the sound
---
We have 8 american ops, but not even the KSK from Germany
---
I think you should change the name of fortissimo because that just means strong in Italian. Maybe change it to something in German.
---
Newer players will have a hard time adjusting i think because the vets pretty much know the map good enough but the new ones who dont do thunt will have a decently hard time in multi
---
It will be too OP if its until destroyed, you can hide it to pretty good spots and make everyone deaf
---
Do you know "Gloves"?
---
please no . i don't want to get the fury disease flashbacks
---
It was fun but too many ppl would quit &amp; should of been 4 player
---
He doesn’t offer anything special, and can’t run attachments on his guns, and can be limited in his speed depending on the CTU. There are operators that are better fillers than recruit. Casual you can make it work, but not ranked.
---
It was actually the first time stealth approach was viable in this game. I have to agree though, a lot of matchmade teams did just rush and shoot everything and trigger zombies when everyone wasn't ready yet. But with friends and at times when you were lucky enough to get like-minded players, it was ton of fun.
---
I really hope Ubi will bring it back one day.
---
yeah sadly
---
I've been making it work on ranked but only on attack on defense he's a liability
---
Does the dog have afganistans map tattooed in it's paw? :D
---
i actually enjoyed his lethal traps

If i was playing that monty i wouldve camped in a corner then pinged your location for my teammate and i would go for melee when it like 3 seconds left for defuse

Aesthetic AF
---
I feel this on a spiritual level... happens once a night atleast with my friend because he doesn’t understand grouping that close together is a bad idea
---
I’ll give you the fact that it works in lower lobbies, but Platinum lobbies, they would be able to put a stop to it easily, as you’ve stated, so I see what you mean.
---
patch is backwards
---
I wish I could play it.
---
I still can't believe that they put so much effort into it, just to never have it played again.
---
this.
---
dunno
---
Same
---
Nothing has changed tactics wise for ranked the new operators dont see much use gotta wait to see how the pros use them until people will actually use them i would guess
---
Thx ma dude
---
thanks
---
This game is so embarrassing......
---
1 a really good matchmaking 
---
2 fixing problems removing gadgets
---
3 headshots that doesn't are headshots
---
.....
---
..... that’s Article 5.... you need to do it with others
---
on another note, is the screen supposed to look this grey? It's way darker for me
---
The sonic boom could instead of loud noise, mute most audio but make it sound like footsteps are walking all around the person under effect.
---
Bastards: you can't just expect everyone to just tell the truth to you.
---
Me: Observe
---
This was a whole new game in itself I wish they kept it
---
Go to R6 subreddit, click on settings, then change user flair
---
Probably because you lose interest and don’t focus as much
---
what weapon skin is that? its not the one that came with outbreak is it? looks different
---
@ticozza
---
Oh yes definitely that being said I’ve seen a lotta Nokk gameplay and from what I remember how Finka felt (kinda clunky) on top of the fact Nokk is mainly just there to do her own thing whilst as Finka she’s more of a team focused op.
---
If you play with friends then yea go ahead and pick up Finka if you play solo I think I’ll have to recommend Nokk over Finka
---
What about the props to smoke that revived u.I think they should get props
---
2-step verification is probably just disabled
---
I’d say 2% hostage 38% secure, 60% bomb.
---
Everybody! Let's point and laugh!
---
And ya I agree with you on keeping secure in
---
"This guy said something true, let's downvote him !"
---
kek
---
a great skin
---
But the left hand and shoulder (when aiming down) is the ones doing the most work to reduce the recoil
---
Yep, either people have a short memory, or very low standard, it was crap.
---
If you've dropped from Gold 1 to Solver for solely because you can't use a crutch operator, that says something about your skill.
---
The siege community: “we want only competitive maps in siege!”
---
Also the siege community: “bring back old Hereford!”
---
Don’t think we need any more evidence to illustrate how stupid people on the subreddit are.
---
Maybe work on cross hair placement? If you do good with callouts (which is obvious, we all do) then your good just not pre aiming angles you should be.
---
Maybe it was done for comedic effect, just maybe?
---
Haha le operator making face? So funnie lmao xDDD
---
Well, it's 38 Renown, not bucks, a Renown is worth a lot, how do we know? you can literally buy a human (in-game; operator) for 25000 renown, a human is almost priceless, so 38 renown counts as alot, so if we are being nerdy, and realistic-ish, he's getting paid quite a bit, it's not 38 USD, it's 38 RENOWN, which is a currency that could be worth alot depending on the economy.
---
Am I autistic? perhaps ;)
---
(Before haters start commenting, no, I don't do human trafficking, just gave it as an example xD
---
Thanks dude!
---
I mean I'm fine they take action but it's taking to long, claymores are really important and Nomad is almost a must pick right now
---
People with team names in their names when they're coppers is peak cringe tbh
---
Dang, was this what it looked like?  I didn't have R6 back then...
---
I’m uncomfortable
---
Useless if it took longer to detonate?? 
---
Unless you bandit trick or throw an electroclaw (which would destroy the Core), then it doesn’t effect much. Still makes her better than the other breachers if this operator is on the team. 
---
And thanks. I came up with this when trying to make an operator that countered Maverick quite significantly. It’s simple and i adapted it to add more counterplay etc. Really appreciate the good feedback
---
Thank you:)
---
It's like the end of hot fuzz
---
Gratz. I have never hit above gold 2... i blame it on my physical labor hands lol
---
Not because it takes longer to detonate, I’m talking about the effects of radiation on electrical devices in irl
---
Sadly no
---
That is not a brag lol
---
Why i can hear it even without sound?
---
If anything, proved you right
---
I miss Favella and Canal,really want them back
---
Console aim
---
This sounds like Kapkan.
---
Ah I see. 
---
Yeah it would be cool if the radiation emitted did have an effect on the pellets for realism sake. Obviously not as harsh as likely irl.
---
Hey guys instead of taking this all seriously just laugh at the joke, wow smokes shit so toxic people growing back limbs and shit wow
---
E🅱️ic
---
Hope we will have ability to buy them with Renown
---
Perfection
---
How many matches do you play per day?

Every single one of those graves are because of spawn peeks and we all know it.

Don’t play secure

In addition she has prosthetics for her fingers, she mentions them, just doesn’t always wear them
---
Anything over 2-3 mind reset the queue. Test servers will take a little longer to find a match if you aren't 5 stacked.
---
definitely
---
They aren't comparing the spawn peek to the clash glitch, they're comparing the window trick to a glitch. I get the feeling that it is.
---
How did you get so many mains behind ur name
---
They're still working on the IQ/Clash issue, just because one thing is being done doesn't mean something else can't be.
---
Would you look at that? Some amazing operators, ubi take note.
---
This guys bad, I know I'll vote to kick him and post it to reddit..
---
This is a fucking lie they just want attention if they were gonna do it they would go around telling people
---
Umm the “countdown” is a frost mat just... worse
---
I lived through this exact scenario. Our squad hasn’t recovered. Most walked away from siege in general. Mental health is more important than gaming. Keep it in perspective people.
---
How was your opponent cheating exactly? If you can remember.
---
Cav got a bit of a Nerf but it kinda buffed her? Her damage went down but her range went up so take it however you'd like, she definitely plays differently. Buck is still good ole buck so at least ya got that. I'm gonna warn you now tho, This season really fuckin sucks so I'd suggest holding off playing competitively until next season (June 11th I think)
---
I guess you could say its gotten out of *hand*
---
My stats are broken on Ubisoft club and it only shows that I have 1 kill lol. But I will tell you that my most played operator is Bandit with 21 hours. My highest rank so far has been gold 1 (Trying to get plat by the end of the season)
---
Sure
---
Its paid, not payed
---
Does that mean you're going to quit? Because from your posting all I can see if you complaining for some time
---
Damn, I learned this the hard way, lol.
---
He is my friend, I clearly even add text saying that as I vote to kick him ? 
---
Just relax, its a funny clip of gameplay and nothing bad has or will come of it.
---
I got rainbow six sieges for like 11 months ago and it was at the end of operation chimera, and I didn't know that this game mode was in there until operation parabellum come out. so I was sad that I didn't play it :(
---
This is a great idea until the armed man panics and starts shooting blindly in the fog this hitting every innocent bystander in the room.
---
:(((((( poor gas boi
---
He replied earlier saying he's was laughing which probably made him shake.
---
Wow I never even knew she was missing any.
---
Same with Bartlett U. when it was a thing.
---
Cheers Mate
---
It's already saved me from many Rickrolls.
---
i kinda agree, i just like it as a flex that i’ve grinded to 120,000 renown, but i usually just use default, black or gray camo
---
These new bugs and problems are why I don’t play anymore and I honestly wonder how many have done the same
---
In my rank finka players never time it right so yeah useless
---
Well I think I was the first so...
---
Finka has the highest win ratio of any attacker and second in the whole game to rook who has a win delta of 3, just because you don’t notice the difference they make it doesn’t mean they’re useless,both are very underused operators because nobody really notices how useful their gadgets are because they’re passive abilities
---
Didn’t even have sound on and I could hear it through that mouse movement.
---
I stand corrected then, i forgot where it came from but always assumed it was outbreak.
---
MSN gaming zone with dialup internet 😂
---
I’m in the high gold 1 low plat 3 area of this game on PC and there’s still kids who complain about the dumbest of things. The reality is change always happens and you have to learn how to work with it. But this Community rather bitch then get better.
---
I shidded and cummed
---
*looks at the tire ladder*
---
Looks amazinggg
---
Rooms labeled 56k only!
---
That’s PS. Xbox has that same thing but it’s not a semi circle it’s more of a semicircle that had the left or right side lopped off
---
1.thank you for telling me what's wrong
---
2.i didn't see the operator ideas,actually I have thought about the ideas since 2017.
---
3.My Grammer is shitty,I know😂once I posted something on Twitter and some bully just didn't stop laughing on my English and my name,since then I'm just translate in Google,because I'm too scared for being bullied again cause of my english
---
4.how raash is ash?beside of the name?
---
5.thank you!! I've been working like 2 days on drawing this operators.
---
And again,thank you for telling me my mistakes without being rude,
---
Hail satan.
---
Okay goobisoft. Jsyk, removing an acog doesn’t make an operator balanced
---
Who you gonna call?
---
ubisoft pls use this
---
wait satan is just cav lol
---
*Yeets a ball of screening child*
---
caviera
---
These guns seem COD inspired. The XM8 an the KSG are familiar
---
And soon to be nøkk.
---
I mean obviously they’re not the exact same, but it’s literally just a reskin of the character in game with a new look for their signature gun so not too far off from r6
---
Looks superb
---
true, deagle muzzle brake is unfair (as stated by PreisT)
---
Trick shot YouTube star oof
---
Actually if you look at it all of the doors have been removed in every map.
---
That’s illegal
---
nope just unlucky
---
Just luck dude. I get put against players all over the skill bracket
---
Yeah I love bank as well,I think I'm just gonna delete this post because all of the hate😓
---
Nope
---
lol you can hear valk go "ah!" when you directly hit her with the grenade before it blew up
---
Someone HAS to show Mini this on his next meme stream
---
Ra’ash being ash is more than just the name, ash herself in the game is Israeli.
---
I had problems with that one too. I kept chugging along and finally unlocked it at 5200 killed terrorists. I know that the trophy doesn’t count situations, but I know that I didn’t play situations for that long. Many people have this issue and the advice is the same: just keep playing and eventually you’ll unlock it.
---
I don’t go for one taps either but with the shit damage and shots either not counting or counting as body shots it highlights how shit valk (and cavs) guns really are. I’m always getting fucked by it wish I had your luck lmao
---
You saw his head. You see his earmuffs and then a sliver of his head. Don't complain.he body shot you
---
Wait that's illegal
---
To the recent comments thanks I was really worried it would ruin my experience

I watched 4 seconds and felt annoyed

Tbh you are right,didn't tought about that😅

Nitro would be good for supervisor, you could stay somewhere like a balcony (the ones on clubhouse and Oregon immediately come to mind) place a flare and wait under cover with a nitro for an easy kill.

Where can I find this theory?

I imagine it to be like the mute charge from cod aw campaign, where it just sucks out all the sound in an area for a short while, like footsteps, gunshots, explosions e.t.c. but attackers are immune to it, and could make a push onto obj.

The pack I got for completing the challenge had the princess skin for the SR-25. I use that now whenever I play BB, even if it'll be indoors.

bullshit my butterfly helmet improved my monty gameplay 20% as more players pay attention to me.

Perhaps change the KSG for the Russian operator to a KS-23?

Try reinstalling.

As long as it works xD

Once you have killed a teammate or done a certain amount of team damage, RFF is activated and almost all team damage you inflict is reflected back to you (with the exception of some damage-causing gadgets). A teamkilled player can choose to forgive the TK, which removes RFF from the player.

She is a JEW named ASH, I guess you can figire it out.

I see some complaints about the weapon choices and I agree, however no one is really giving you suggestions for replacements so I’ll help. Instead of the Western weapons, maybe the Russian operator could have a VEPR-12 or KS-23 shotgun, and instead of the revolvers they could have a Stechkin APS and MP-443. If you wanted to be really accurate, instead of the Bizon they’d use an SR-2 Veresk.
---
I don’t know as much about German military equipment, but I actually like the XM8 despite it being an American prototype. I’d suggest a more commonly seen rifle in Germany like the G-36K. A G3 marksman rifle would be cool.

Dokkaebi because she reminds me of Sombra from Overwatch (my main on that game). Also I’m not the best fragger, so I use her ability to help the team. Also the BOSG12 is hilarious in casual.
---
Nomad and Griflock are slowly taking her spot.
---
Ela, she’s the reason I bought the game. The Scorpion is my favorite gun of all time. Even with the nerfs, I still wreck with it. Her gadget is godlike during late objective pushes. She ain’t being traded for any other defensive operator.
---
Just don’t peek dude it’s that simple all you have to do also maverick needs a hard counter I think that’s something everyone can agree on

Closest I've been to diamond is 7 elo away. I went on a losing streak afterwards. The only thing differentiated me from being a diamond player is the diamond badge. Other than that the skill required to be a diamond (from plat 1) is luck in my opinion. My brother has been diamond twice but is still in platinum 1 now, because of unlucky matches (teamates not doing their part, glitches, ect)
---
*presence reduction intensifies*

Operation health screwed everything up a bit so they got rid of the polish operation, they added Ela to Operation Blood Orchid and Zofia to Operation White Noise.

April's event was unusual. I only hate myself for not buying the Halloween house skins. But I didn't have a job at the time, so I couldn't justify spending $30 on aesthetics in a video game.

It's not necessary to watch SAO first, sure, but having watched the first two seasons will make Gun Gale Online that much more impactful. I would recommend the first two seasons of SAO regardless, but GGO is a great ride in and of itself.

Steelseries Arctis Pro.

They're amazing and worth the google research.

Wether you play PC or Console, I recommend HyperX Cloud II. Someone recommended them to me and they're the best headset I've ever gotten. They're comfortable, the microphone is detachable, and it's both a USB/Jack setup for plugging into a pc or controller. They're also a great price for an even greater quality item.

Yah there really cheap

Honestly, we the player base should file a well-worded complaint to Ubisoft Support.

Well, it’s matchmaking manipulation, so technically it is cheating.

I mean it's not some awesome 4k but I thought it was funny :/ How often do you miss half a mag and still manage to kill two enemies, one with your last bullet? First time for me, so yeah, I do think it's something special.

It does kinda look like it but watch it with sound &amp; look at the ammo counter, only one shot fired.

Anyway, in the anime its actually the guy on the right that paid to win lmao. Fun fact, his gun is the M14 EBR, Which Dokkaebi uses.
---
Got this on the TTS :(
---
Yes but what if two friends of different skills have fun playing with each other? Ubisoft wouldn’t limit them from playing Ranked together. And with the hypothesized system, you would penalize people that are in the same match as people who play with their friends. There are a lot of people, myself included that won’t even touch casual due to how uncompetitive the mode is as a whole. By instituting your system, you would force them into a mode they wouldn’t want to play, thus causing the playerbase to shrink, which is the opposite of what Ubi wants.
---
smoke had the best event skin
---
They've made plenty of money off the game before they implemented the lootboxes.

100% accurate

i have watched it. just like everyone else telling you it’s not a headshot. you have multiple people saying you’re wrong but you don’t care. again, don’t make a post here if all you’re looking for is agreement.

especially after they were the ones who did stupid things to get killed.

i skipped the event cosmetics entirely because..well... i thought they were just ugly and unfitting

Not entirely true, on Favela on top floor you can see the door to stairs being kicked out of the doorframe on the ground. But yeah there are no other doors

That's the point..

What plat3 player would que with a REAL AND ACTUAL copper4 player?

I wanted the cat mask for the Killer Queen vibes but got the Monty butterfly helmet, ugliest one of the bunch imo. I luckily don't spend money on MTs (I have learned my lesson since my time playing overwatch) so no harm no foul.
---
Edit: “drones” should be “droned”

And overly priced to fully mod a gun

I’d rather play that then Hereford

I was just thinking about the simulation thing because why would members of team Rainbow kill each other when they are supposed to work together

Wait why is this guy getting downvoted? Ofc every map in Siege is staged to be a situation for the operators
---
You actually can, I’ve reported numerous players for cheating and they’ve been banned, confirmation from Xbox live is given each time they take action.
---
Then it was probably customs
---
And as I said, most competitive games do this. How is being forced to play a game at a disadvantage from the very start better than searching for another match in any way? Please, give some damn reasons.
---
Account level? That’s usually a indicator for me.

Buff the dmg to 35 or the mag to 35

1st kill: she was trying to shoot buck

2nd kill: she say him through the hole

3rd kill: good guess that someone was hiding there

I use the AR33 on Thatcher

I got Smokes helmet and will never use it

OP's youtube is also based around gun syncs. he's got a couple lazy ones but most of em are pretty good (although not as dank)

If I remember correctly he was around low 70s

If you have good aim ar33, if you need to rely on more bullets l85 :)

If you are on PC on the right side there is an option at the end of community detail called community options under which you can change user flair. I guess it has the same name in the app too.

I don’t think he was, you could see that 1/2 second delay when he hit the first shot through the construction wall and I could hear the last guy wiggling around in the corner so its fair to say he could too.

Glad to know I am not the only one

He's been doing that with his audience/chat forever. Just ignore him if you don't like it, it's that simple.

I have a feeling it’s from the Mario and sonic Olympic Games. Feels like the winter version

Doorframes are penetrable.
---
Thats like saying that people in real life cant kill people by shooting them in the head, because they could do it with luck(In a gunfight). That doesn’t mean the hypothetical gun fight is random. The more skilled shooter has a higher chance of landing a headshot. Same for in this game.
---
Uh no, if it would have the ping issue it would have a spike of ping and the chord unplug looking thing
---
They do, but the only way you can upgrade is by buying whatever edition on steam and deleting the other one from your account. It will keep your progress on the ubi account.
---
Princess Blackbeard s tier
---
You can edit flairs. You can do it on mobile too.
---
Ok picture this you down someone but they are to far away/behind cover to get the kill and your the last operator standing. You know if you go to get the kill you'll expose yourself to enemy fire.
---
Do you:
---
A: Watch and wait for someone to come pick them up
---
B: Leave them be
---
Or
---
C: Wish you had frags so you didn't have to worry about that person being picked back up
---
No, he's fine now.
---
So you’re saying that because someone can get lucky, that the whole game is based around luck?

Semi realistic game: is realistic
---
If you shoot someone in the head there is an extremely high chance they will die instantly siege replicates that by y’know, allowing you to shoot someone in the face and kill them instantly
---
Ar33 is better at cqb due to the rate of fire but from medium to long range the l85 is better. But all together the ar33 is better on Thatcher because sledge has the smg 11 for cbq Thatcher doesn't.
---
my pp doesnt exist
---
It was not necessarily bitching. More of establishing what brackets of the game is available. Starter / normal edition. Or they call it "the game" which is literally the same thing. With a name alteration.

I’m not tech smart at all, and this probably won’t work but personally I’ve noticed I don’t need at SSD to run siege at all. The game starts up fairly fast, and actual in game load times are perfect. I load in at the same time if not faster than everyone else, probably because of my WiFi speed. Would you be able to load it onto an HDD?
---
It’s lesion and smoke

taking advantage of the active minority who have gambling issues to keep apex legends afloat or ubi devs interested in making games doesn't sit well on my palate

A law is about to be made in the US that prohibits microtransactions from online markets. Hopefully ubisoft will allow us to buy even stuff then.

Oh gotcha

I feel when I host I que plats and diamonds in casual ever match with out fail which is fine seeing as I am plat  vs when one of my friends does while he is bronze or sliver we que lower ranks or unranked and maybe a plat here and there that immediately leaves once he is killed .

This is the gaming version of a critic praising a chefs dish.

For countdown, why not make it a land mine of sorts? Make it have an audible “click” when it’s stepped on, and if they step off it detonates, dealing ~50 damage, and 25 damage to anyone else in a very small radius. An ally can come alongside and disable the trap with a short animation.
---
It's been very fun playing against Macie &amp; Get_Flanked on the TS 3 times now (3 losses as well lol), don't mind "helping" these guys get the elo they needed to get their diamonds lol.

I understand what you're saying but the game isn't actually $60. I feel bad for anyone who pays that price. Snagged full edition for $12 a couple years ago for example.

Been I while since I've seen a gun sync. Great job on this one.
---
I cant describe what im feeling right now
---
Man people can be friends with each other even if they don’t have the same skill level. You’re saying that just because they aren’t good enough to play with, a plat3 wouldn’t be friends with a copper 4. I’m plat3 and play with my friend in copper1 all the time. Just because he’s not good doesn’t mean I don’t want to play with him. You’re basically saying that if someone sucks at the game they shouldn’t have the right to play with their friends. Again, Ubi would never do that. They want more people to play Siege, not less. Having less people want to play your game is incredibly stupid.
---
One word. Gambling.
---
Dokkaebi and hibana needs at least a A tier
---
Kapu sus ka kade koroana!

I feel like you should get more attention for that user flair lol. That better be your main when she comes out in order to check out -_-

If u have to choose between the two i would say nomad but if you are considering other i would say hibana or jackal

I like how when ever I post a meme on this sub it gets removed for being an image macro

Jokes on him, I'm Batman
---
Why do we need an MVP screen in singleplayer
---
Capitao and Maverick are definitely solid operators.
---
Capitao would have to be one of my main picks when playing with a team, his ranged smokes and area of denial Fire when it comes to Bomb is just amazing, plus that and the buff that is coming with Capitao where his fire will destroy gadgets feels like will make him a must pick.
---
Maverick is fun to play once you get a solid understanding of the map and how to play him, making little peek holes for you (or your team) to use and score easy kills. This can also be used as area of denial as well as when a hole has been opened up the enemy won't put themselves into line of sight of it.
---
You are not alone
---
Finally, someone who likes it.

I was talking about a rework
---
This is quite a nice

---
I played with them recently. They aren't terrible but obviously they leave games when they're about to lose/die to inflate their stats.
---
Theme park in pl luwl
---
Well, more so the lack of it from the victim of that and so what if people can get lucky? Does that mean the whole game is RNG based? No. Not at all. If I get lucky and find $200 on the ground, that doesn’t mean that you can only get money because of luck, it just means that it’s possible to be lucky.
---
i can understand it a bit more in multiplayer cause its more prestigious when you are actually going up against other people, but its completely unnecessary in t hunt
---
Thatcher cause he counters every deployable gadget except for frost mats, mira and rook armour.
---
Frost because she was the first defender I got and I have more hours on her than every other defender combined
---
Let's be honest though, it's never really that impressive to take out a Tachanka. It's kind of expected. But when he turns it around and starts dropping people, that is decidedly unexpected lol
---
I can see why they have it for thunt multiplayer but for lone wolf it's absolutely unnecessary
---
Its an annoying glitch that was abused in Ranked, I wont explain how it works so that people dont abuse it but essentially you can down the hostage in defending and attacking to keep winning every round.
---
How can you think it's his chair, it's obviously his pair of gaming socks.
---
I should have reworded it. I took them out with his mounted gun.
---
ha ha Europe
---
I brought my Furry Smoke into a game of casual after the event ended and people yelled at me and wouldn't camp in the same room as me lol
---
even in t hunt multiplayer, its not really competitive enough for anyone to care who got the most kills.
---
Don't be scared, play ranked. You'll never improve if you never start playing in a serious environment. And don't let toxicity from other players stop you, just focus on improving.
---
Yeah I agree but I at least see why they have it, theres SOME competition, but lone wolf is completely different
---
It’s Jason bourne
---
The old bum rush with the sausage. A man of culture I see
---
They have premium in this game? Had no idea
---
Discounted, at least. Buying them individually is 40, vs 30 for the pass. Plus you get to play them a week early, assuming someone isn't TKing you or banning the new op every time (thank fuck I avoid ranked like the plague these days).
---
Jägar and Fuse
---
honestly that's what you get for destroying a Mira right after seeing an enemy
---
What's the video in the background (the guy dancing) from?
---
I love it, I will probably buy it.
---
How do you get 4 tags? Like maverick nomad smoke and ela?
---
So this is "mid" 1v1 yet you have all your traps left, your cam and both reinforcements. And he just happened to go AFK.
---
Yeah, ok. lol.
---
I havent played much ranked this season since my friends have all dipped from siege, and i wonder why consider what a shitstorm this season was- but thats my casual stats, as you see i clearly stated “im a casual secure player, but a bomb ranked player” as when i play casual i could give less fucks, but when i play ranked i actually wanna try a little. And, i play also, i played like 5-6 matches of ranked today, i did not see one echo, until the final match and final round, and we got his yokais.

Claymores are fine

Crouch walking is your best friend; barb wire is also a good alarm, always ADS a corner or hallway when moving between long hallways and areas, always have an exit planned if things go awry, impacts are good for distractions/rotation holes/ killing someone while they’re injured, use cams when you can, be aware of enemy team comp to ensure you won’t get pinched by lion/jackal/dokkaebi/blitz so you’re able to decide if you want to roam/lurk or stay around the objective. When it comes to roaming you have to pick an operator that suits your play style, some are good for just fragging while others a better at harassing and wasting the attackers time

That’s the beauty of it. Don’t give them money then. Other people feel differently. If they think x y z is worth $20 then that’s fine. No one is forcing them to buy anything.

Do you feel the same way about the lottery or any other game of chance? The game is rated M after all.

I did get the glaz headgear and septicemia on the 9x19 for the Russians

High plats/diamonds are easy to play against I ranked but when I queue up for cas it’s nothing but brain dead lvl40s holding angles in some odd spot for the whole round :(
---
What they should do is make it like a cut out like doorways in Favela

It's a good change. Next I would decrease her ROF a bit because 980RPM for a "support" operator is a bit much imo.
---
Idk, you sound pretty upset about losing internet points.

Also, thanks for not screaming at me for playing secure! Dont get me wrong though, ifully agree hes op in some cases, but as i said, who isnt? (And again, dont say blackbeard) like, 2 seconds left, and echo, by some miracle, has both drones and isnt dead, you’re fucked, to put it bluntly, but then again, 2 seconds left and you hit a gu, fucked, 2 seconds left and an ela throws a grizmot at you?
