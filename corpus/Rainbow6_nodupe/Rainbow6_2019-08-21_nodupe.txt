Note to self,never buy discounted weapons and ammo.
---
Have you tried forwarding your ports?
---
did i ever state he was overpowered or do you struggle with basic reading comprehension? someone asked why people don‚Äôt like him and i simply told him the reasons why people don‚Äôt.
---
All primaries so.....
---
You can download it on steam or use ulay which will just download it on steam anyways
---
idk I like how it‚Äôs a tease for when she was leaked with blonde hair
---
There are people claiming the chick was op too lmao, "the ability to go up hatches and die when entering the ovj is too good.
---
Doesn't defense get to ban the middle operators?
---
He seems like a nice dude.
---
Just wanna say that I‚Äôve never bought an alpha pack
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Which one
---
I kinda liked him being the mega anti shield. Nothing beat smoking and then impacting a Monty
---
oh I see OK thx
---
 Still could get the dub smh
---
"Shit,sorry."
---
"I got on the same team with Yung and Gotcha from EG" luckyyyyyyyy

Me playing Goyo: The heretics must be purged with fire üòÇ

FUS RO DAH!!!!!

The other day i clutched a 1v5 and got kicked right after
---
I had a 1v5 clutch ace yesterday and they kicked me after

They all sound like they were written in a year 6 creative writing test.

Next season

Y'all really... be on... 
---
#SOME SHIT!
---
You fucking mad man, what have you done
---
Try to get yourself out of the slump, because sometimes you can turn it around. If you find you cant, take a break. I was in a major rut around a month ago. Tried for a week or two to break out of it but was still just playing like garbage. I took a break for a few weeks. I played Minecraft and Battlefield V for 2-3 weeks, and just yesterday felt like I wanted to get back into r6 (possibly from the ember rise hype). I‚Äôve played ~5 hours since, and have been really enjoying it. This is just what has worked for me in the past, you could be different.
---
Fucked recoil?
---
2. lvl 84
---
Exactly
---
See you in hot
---
Horey sheet
---
I was going 230 mph down the highway asking people if they needed armor
---
If you play MnK on console you should be banned, so do with that what you will.
---
Maybe, people care more about winning in ranked so wont be as likely to team kill / kick you etc
---
People are more toxic in Ranked since their Rank is on the line.
---
what map you talking about? All the currently reworked maps needed to be reworked on. Both Kanal and hereford needed more rotation options across the maps and less windows. Themepark needs a lighting and hunted area rework.
---
Mines more flash hider sized
---
Good god no.
---
I think her ability to create currently impossible flanks is quite interesting, the window fast rappeling is fluff.
---
If you're referring to Kanals, I hope you are being satirical. That map was garbage and now it is a lot better.
---
When you‚Äôve built your community around toxicity and ‚Äúmemeing‚Äù this is what you get.
---
Probably because they are. They seem to keep lowering the visual quality in order to better loading &amp; online play.
---
Bruh R.I.P defense
---
no
---
This is the one I want lol, 60 hours in and not a single black ice üò≠üòÖ
---
Glaz have grenades now or it's photoshop ?
---
Far less TKing in ranked
---
I can‚Äôt think of a rework that didn‚Äôt need it. Hell, I can‚Äôt think of a single map that couldn‚Äôt use at least some buffs.
---
That's a very cool idea
---
but it takes doc 2 seconds the revive himself with 75 health. While it takes zofia 20 damn years and only 5 health
---
He and dok got nades, not photoshop
---
It was fun to spawnpeek
---
I started going grey at 16. My cousin is full grey at 29.
---
Time to get a girlfriend then...
---
Lowkey I‚Äôm gonna be running that thing once it comes out. It looks cool and the recoil isn‚Äôt all that different.
---
I thought bb‚Äôs gun sucked
---
I think her true only use will be able to be the anti defuse post plant, with her repelling up a hatch and watching the defuser from above.
---
man it's so hard playing this game without an actual team that aren't dicks to you.
---
Idk if you are being super ironic or just stupid
---
Biker crack head, jogging routine, and troubled teenager are far from the best elites.
---
Look up what /s is my dude
---
I got 2 lvl 150. Jealous
---
lmao i see no indifference between this and hibana elite
---
i hope ubisoft reintroduce it in the game. i love that skin
---
Looking at this post isn‚Äôt either
---
Same bro same
---
Did I really get downvote bombed from an ironic comment? I put /s in it because I knew people would miss the shitty joke but it still went over people‚Äôs heads.
---
Mira elite coming when the new season is out around the 10th of sep, Ela elite is leaked and probberly be out in the mid season update.
---
Then why can‚Äôt you test the thing?
---
Ok nice
---
Lol I love it 2 finally a good legendary I made the same post a while ago
---
My squad always ban Twitch and Valkyrie, just to spice things up.
---
When Ubi doesn‚Äôt pay the loading screen artist enough money
---
Spicy
---
You know what would be epic? A firefighter operator. Sprays water with a fatass hose and will knock anybody it hits onto their back and will make the floor slippery for a short period of time. Idk just thought of this
---
Can confirm people tryhard in unranked, played it last night
---
I must get lucky, I've gotten tk'd a handful of times. We run in to people who rage quit rather than tk.
---
wtf
---
I listen for the gun sounds and the moans and groans of my squad in VC... I'll know if they die or get a kill off of some "FUUUUCK! i HEADSHOT HER/HIM FUCK THIS GAME; oh he's/she's [call-out]" or from the "GET FUCKING DOMED IDIOT [for lack of the actual word üòà]"
---
But I can also differentiate from the killfeed and the gun sounds.
---
I don‚Äôt wanna say that Cav is a ‚Äògood ban‚Äô but I‚Äôve banned her before in duo queue because I just get tired of one fucking teammate running in alone with no comms and getting interrogated. 
---
Like had one guy do it twice, then got him on my team and you can bet your ass I banned Cav.
---
What I'm doing, I just miss a more serious experience and get annoyed by "go play ranked" from teammates.
---
If all those grenades hit an ADS only 1 can get through
---
Nice.
---
Thank you for bring this up I've read some of the newer operators and have seen Mira, Thermite, and Bandit talk about their thoughts at the end. I thought it was just on the newer ones but it appears I have some more reading to do.
---
Halloween is the only event I will probably splurge on. I got Thermite‚Äôs entire kit last year and he‚Äôs my main, so I sport that shit everyday. I hate how it‚Äôs a chance you‚Äôll get what you want however.
---
I don't play on the tts so this is the first I've seen the gadget.
---
Literally Unplayable.
---
But Blitz *IS* a train
---
‚ÄúYou can start worrying about grenades now‚Äù
---
All the smgs got a tad horizontal recoil buff but the smg-11 is still superior
---
Welp, it's favela in casual, as a attacker, you win the round within 30 second by rushing objective or u got kicked. /s
---
People who ban lesion are clowns. You are the last person that should give their opinion on the subject
---
I think it‚Äôs the nose
---
Doesn‚Äôt it say in cavs bio she has ‚Äúquestionable methods‚Äù or something?
---
Dumb question, what's this from?
---
They have been able to fund them before without a battle pass why can‚Äôt they do it now? Would you still say that after seeing the overpriced merch they just launched 
---

Cavy got banned though. There's a suppressor right there on the side.

I just run back to obj if I get tracked and watch all entrances to my location on the way back. Works almost every time

---
Honestly thought it was Trump and Kim Jong Un
---
And that's why I said go try a different game. I wouldn't play a game that isn't giving me what I want.
---
why did you make us watch a minute of useless material?
---
I don‚Äôt think that was your kill. No +120 appeared and it didn‚Äôt say kill on the side of your screen.
---
Yeah. Dokk can be turned off, and is only a general location for less time. 
---
Jackal bridges the communication gap by giving a whole team your exact location. It can clean up an unorganized teams roam clear to a crazy degree. I honestly think only he should be able to see the pings, or they should be Alibi style (rapid but for short amount of time). Either would make him strong but still not OP, and could encourage actual teamwork again.
---
Yeah. He lost claymores, dok lost flashes
---
I'm not a fan AT ALL of these new operators. They completely change the game and i'm not if that's a good thing..What are people's thoughts so far that have played them on the TTS?
---
This is the type of content I'm here for
---
üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
/r/UIgore
---
Oh sorry, most of them are becoming cheaper, more like 8 hrs for the cheaper ones
---
I use the ar33. I don‚Äôt play sledge so I‚Äôve never really tried the L85.
---
I see literally no difference in the video above. Maybe even more recoil on TTS but I am not sure.
---
That‚Äôs what I kinda mean, My friends and I have a stray where we just play secure the area and we just lock down the objectives and watch every single entrance, once a jackal pushed and got instantly beamed by my entire team
---
Black ice
---
That looks like fun!
---
Tuff
---
does it happen in csgo competitive?
---
tbh i don‚Äôt either, but i got a clutch 4k with Ela today and i felt like no recoil, and i‚Äôm terrible with recoil control
---
I used to play only ranked and only secure with some friends and after they changed ranked to bomb only we stopped playing Siege at all since bomb with randoms (usually there were three of us) is a fucking shitshow and casual is insufferable cesspit with dumb noobish rules. 
---
I'm afraid you will face the same choice: start playing bomb or completely abandon the game until they do something about secure mode.
---
I don't think you can, I think you have to own the game on both platforms
---
i like fire truck and moster trucks
---
Did anyone say... tts? L_?L_?L_?L_?L_? 777777777 2? 2? 2?
---
It looks so stupid leaning and nothing happens xD
---
walter
---
Jaeger has 3 ADS's that can shoot 2 grenades each. Wouldn't that mean that 4 grenades could get through?
---
Are u assholes? Definitely!
---
It‚Äôs 3 not 2
---
He doesn't really need a rework, at least not as much as others, he is supposed to redirect enemies not just stop them completely.
---
just a gun but aight
---
This are all my favourites. I'm a big fan of echo's as well (but honestly it's the same as the sas pretty much)
---
Oh shit here we go again (my money)
---
Yup, survived a run out but shat a brick .
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to test it on the tts yet, but they said in the reveal once you‚Äôre inside you can only use it on hatches and skylights, not windows
---
Can't wait for Rouge-9 to bash the hell out of it lol
---
Wait he gets 3 volcan shields?
---
R u rarted
---
*Twitch banned*
---
#Happy Mira noises
---
A surprise to be sure but a welcomed one
---
\&gt;playing hostage in the first place
---
Why
---
I genuinely want to know... why do Glaz and Dokk have grenades now? Ubisoft *specifically* gave Glaz a nerf that would encourage players to use him at longer ranges - how does a frag grenade agree with that philosophy at all?
---
No.
---
Mira is permabanned in pro league by a lot of teams. I ban her all the time in ranked.
---
Right? Screwed me up bad.
---
no one is making you buy it. &amp; they were able to fund it before because nothing was cut, numbnuts. it's not a hard concept to grasp. they're not forcing you or anyone else to buy it so i don't see a problem.
---
**why does this exist**
---
What about when Blitz‚Äô portrait went from angry eyes to baby blues?
---
Why does ash have a smirk on her face.
---
Lmao, you outplayed the other team so hard. But seriously ubi need to pull out something for attackers to counter the fire, otherwise I'm banning goyo in hostage for sure.
---
I feel like it‚Äôs one thing to vote to kick the last man after the round ends because he was absolutely terrible and didn‚Äôt try at all is one thing, but being toxic and voting to kick for surviving makes no sense. My rule is, give the person a chance. If they fail miserably without any kind of attempt, they should get kicked. If the die trying, at least they made a conscious effort.
---
I completely agree with you . I don't care about new weapons . I don't care about new maps . All i want is a bug-free game and fixed maps . Fuck the people who want new weapons
---
The game is not and should not be balanced around hostage
---
I think 3 not sure
---
It‚Äôs the test server though so it happens more bc it doesn‚Äôt matter there
---
I can hear this photo... and well... Apples
---

---
Yes, this comment right here.
---
or let people ban the ops they want
---
A gazillion
---
Allahu akbar
---
I want a pirate skin for him with pegleg and a parrot
---
Lier I someone told me how to do it. &gt;:(
---
Unfortunately that‚Äôs just how the game is. I wish the game could recognize these things that happen and could maybe just make you lose less elo but unfortunately not.
---
Ok man.
---
Well all the other ones were occupied
---
Can Ubisoft really not do anything about smurfs, ddossing and keyboard users or are they just gonna change leaning while rappelling ?
---
diamond is now at 4400 and champions rank is 5000 where it assigns you a number
---
Does not look Texan üòÇüòÇ
---
What kind of tomfuckery is that
---
That‚Äôs questionable friends right there.
---
Yay!
---
Lmao suppressor reflex on the mp5 with the Ash chibi just made my day.
---
You lost your level 100 game?
---
I do that only if the guy is ok with it, because if you do that on a low level guy it might ruin his not so far experience in the game, and since I spent a lot of time in this game, I don't want it to happen.
---
(Actually preparing a one tap montage where half of the kills are teamkills lul)
---
Who even plays hostage lmao
---
Hello Al_Gemene,
---
Open it from a different device.
---
And hip firing
---
I wanna vomit

And now he never will be.

I think a fair way to do it would be 20% less elo lost per missing teammate

O kurwa, nie≈∫le
---
I see what you are doing for, it could be useful. The main thing for Castle is funnel attackers into certain rooms, I would rather for them to buff the damage they can take from sledge, or even ash for that matter. They shouldn‚Äôt be fuzed
---
Through either. 
---
I see what you are saying but I doubt bandit or kaid would waste their gadgets on a Castle when they could buff the reinforced walls.
---
DOOT
---
no witchhunting allowed
---
He can't take all of us if we rush him!
---
In this case, I think its more apt, since instead of a trap that triggers by itself, its something that needs to be set off, so whoever sets off the explosion is more clearly responsible for anyone caught in the blast. 
---
While there aren't any other similar cases that would apply beyond like a couple extremely niche instances (for example killing an enemy by setting off their own claymore which is limited basically only to clash) I am fine with this ruling on Ubi's part.
---
I love the angry knife kill at the end
---
They can‚Äôt do anything about them though. The mouse and keyboarders have adapters that makes the game think they are using a controller. The game doesn‚Äôt allow you to play MnK when you plug it in to the console, that‚Äôs why there are adapters. And how will the game just know if someone is a smurf? Not much you can do about it. Dossers? They use vpns so they can‚Äôt figure out who‚Äôs doing it. That‚Äôs all.
---
FINALLYYYYY
---
The reason why I sometimes vote to kick people when they are the last one standing is because they just stay outside the whole match and do nothing, letting us die.
---
Best secondary. Change my mind
---
Is they all actually getting nades?
---
i think that is "crash of pieces"
---
I think the tissues are for something else ;)
---
There's no counter for him
---
His name should be ‚ÄòOk‚Äô
---
Narrator: But it did
---
Settings --&gt; Matchmaking Options --&gt; turn off hostage/secure/bomb/t hunt maps you don't want/t hunt modes you don't want
---
Yea but just remember that it could be abused then. If you had people on alt accounts or if they didn‚Äôt care they lose elo, they could all leave them game before you lose so you don‚Äôt lose much elo.
---
No, this wouldn‚Äôt work/ make sense for almost all of the elite outfits in the game.

Replaying the video, I notice that I diddnt even get the melee kill...
---
That was beautiful
---
This is a terrible troll
---
He already got his optimal rework in the form of Maestro, it just earned Ubi more money to release it as a new op instead of fixing Tachanka.
---
He will never be buffed because any and all reworks you can imagine for him will make more money if you sell it as a new op.
---
Seems like only the first 20 ops got bios.
---
There's not a whole lot that's new.  They've mostly stuck to what was already written, just a little more fleshed out.  No mad edgy Lion/Ela shit.
---
That sucks go honestly

*flying circus show featuring the inquisition

Packed it earlier this week and sorry mate but it looks like shit in game. Nothing like your photo.
---
That's how many he had in the video right? So unless the game was glitched, yes.... he has 3.
---
Best boi
---
Who are the other two?

Oh god please be true. I'm going medieval vampire slaying!

Yea my two friends i queue with are toxic as hell but solo is worse
---
So.. seems like you like to play Cav.. 
---
Her noise was a nerf from seasons ago. Why buff it?
---
Don‚Äôt make Warden worse. He needs all the help he can get. 
---
Thatchers grenade is perfect. Just need to learn the timing.
---
You made my point for me... People think jackal is op even though no one ever really played him in the first place, hence people will ban him because five stacks will think 'no one likes him. None of our squad plays him(because no one played him to begin with) so let's ban him'... That was my point. Completely different story if five stacking because your bans will reflect your strats...
---
Saaay apple
---
Console ladies and gentlemen
---
Lmao too bad i'm not american
---
I think its true! The leaked cosmetics of defenders showed that Doc is a a frankenstein-ish, while the rest were ghouls and monsters. Theme Park was accidentally renamed to Doktors Castle in the TTS, and here we have attacker monster slayers. Oh this is going to be fun

2 days of pissing in a bottle
---
The hostage dying needs to be a draw or more refined in its "fault".
---
I would support a draw because all to many times I've gotten into a game where someone intentionally kills them. Once a dude straight up said in chat "ah fuck I hate this mode", killed the hostage, and bailed.
---
It was stupid.
---
I really don't know why Ubi has never thought about this.  Why can't you just pick ur def operators on T-Hunt?   It really has no sense that you can't play defenders on terrorist hunt and but only  on protect the hostage.  Can't you try to warm up or train the aim with a new ops/weapon you haven't tested before just killing some Terrorist around the map, instead of having only one game mode that it's just like playing vs zombies in COD....Non sense to me tbh
---
:(
---
It does seem weird that a guy wearing basically just a suit and a kevlar vest is a 3 armor 1 speed. I mean heck blitz is wearing heavy armor and a riot shield and he's a two armor two speed
---
They still have to get the licenses for the guns. There's also more than 100+ guns in the game, I don't get why people are complaining.
---
Yeah but you can train sheilds in a row so put all 3 in a line leading to hostage and all they need to do is shoot the one blocking their way at the door to kill hostage
---
&gt; they've done nothing but put out great games for the past few years
---
LOL

Still works nowadays.

Hello garrygh13, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

Great, a season pass, battle pass, premium skins, and Ubisoft! Hello Treyarch! At least the devs aren't calling us freeloaders like Respawn I suppose. Oh wait, it's pay to play..
---
Nobody:

Bandit:
---
We're gradually moving away from realism
---
Go on, ubisoft. Tell your son there's going to be a polish map.
---
Lie to him.
---
Like you lied to me.
---
Most likely will be a hide and seek type event
---
If that‚Äôs the case, Jackal tracking will probably be the best ability
---
Halloween theme park?
---
Wardens ability seems like something that should have been made a defender gadget instead of a powerup for a specific operator.

Hello FlixDaGod, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ctbngr/rainbow_six_map_leak/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Special kinda dumb
---
Yepüò≠
---
Don't know why the quality is so bad, sorry :)
---
While all valid it needs to be pointed out that with new weapons you know that they were designed with that specific Ops playstyle in mind.  The problem with the recycled ones thus far is that they have been grievously misplaced, why does Warden, an Op whose gadget encourages him to hold angles against visual impairments, have weapons that aren't good for his playstyle?  Nokk's playstyle seems to encourage moving slowly to avoid detection and get the jump on people, so having one close quarters weapon choice I can understand but with all the long sight lines on some of these maps she has no real option and can be easily caught off guard and put at a disadvantage against defenders that have better PDWs than her.  Amaru seems like she'd benefit from having a weapon like Jackal's PDW or even the FMG with her shtick in being rapid unpredictable movement, but she gets a Machine Gun?  Even with Goyo I'm skeptical, up until this point the Vector has usually been used with the intel advantage of Mira's windows, will it perform well without that advantage when you are on the move?  I just can't shake the feeling of last season, and if these two are sitting in the same win delta hell that Nokk and Warden are at I think we can say not having weapon's designed for them was a common factor.
---
Ah that‚Äôs hot
---
You rlly threw the game over a few tk‚Äôs
---
*Chuckles* im in danger
---
Rook and mute. 
---
Go watch Siege school.
---
Nice
---
Does anyone have a detailed walkthrough of the new kanal rework? Or sbs comparison?
---
I mean if I was you, I‚Äôd have just let them win the game. However I understand you were also probably a bit angry and wanted to get your own back in a way. 
---
I can understand the guy getting mad about the kill being taken, however to team kill over it (especially in ranked) is just stupid. 
---
You‚Äôre not in the wrong, however you should‚Äôve just won the game and been on your way imo.
---
It gives the advantage of not making noise yourself making it easier to hear other players thus removing one of the downsides to sprinting.
---
Sauce?
---
Uh buddy? Not to be a dick, but when did you start playing?
---
ban hostage and secure area in your menu because theyre awful modes with awful sites.
---
I've been playing Space Engineers a lot lately and at first I thought I was looking at a ship. I need a break.
---
the map looks pretty cool too https://streamable.com/kds2i
---
I had a crush on Ela. :c
---
Lol the game just went on sale on PS4. Me and my buddies are all level 10 and under and we just raid casual servers now XD
---
Fucking broke dick piece of shit drill!
---
Well you‚Äôre MMR is pretty fucked up than (The MMR which is running in the background)
---
I haven't played Siege in months and been out of the loop. These changes coming next season scare me. :\
---
Try to focus on yourself and how you can get better. If you lose, learn from how you died. Always have the view that it‚Äôs a 1v5 and you will improve. Im not hating because I was the same way. I went from Bronze 2 in operation health to good for 3 straight seasons to plat for 5 straight seasons (including being a plat 2 last season). Try to focus on you and not your teammates as much. Then when you squad up you will show out.
---
It really is a nice skin but there is another inventational in a few months so how knows maybe this one or a similar one comes back.
---
sadly I'm gonna have to buy all the packs
---
How are you only level 137 if you've been playing since Black Ice?
---
Hello Sparky_Shepard, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
That's genuinely awful, it pisses me off so much. Very similar thing happened to me a few days ago with a Plat queued with 2 or 3 Copper 4s.
---
It's ridiculous how long it took them to implement a ranked stack limit, it still ticks me off.
---
At least now the whole squad of them will have to buy new accounts to smurf instead of just 1 or 2.
---
I thought it was going to be about how the doc just flopped onto the floor at first
---
I use it when I play mute, but I see your point with the shotgun-SMG-11 combo on both Smoke and Mute is effective. I can also see how this would work. I think it is a possibility.
---
Never have I seen such a new, innovating, operator to come to the game
---
Bruh. Really?! I ship for BCT in a month and won‚Äôt get to experience this! **** OFF.

Actually I could play at 12pm.Do u play na or eu Because if we play on na my ping is gonna be high as shit

This.  I play mnk for my own comfort to prevent anything flaring up in my wrists again and I‚Äôm still garbage.  I don‚Äôt care either, honestly.  I play controller on good days and mnk on days where I can just feel my wrists and thumbs going stiff.  It really isn‚Äôt as big of a deal as people make it out to be.

Na bruh he had tachankas blessing and got it
---
Mnk doesn‚Äôt immediately make you better or give you an advantage.  You have to get used to the controls, limited movement, clunky setup, etc. and you‚Äôre still likely to get shut down semi-regularly.  I put down ranked after reaching Gold 3/2 in a couple of weeks this season and just went back to casual because I was getting into the sweaty ranks and I‚Äôm not really there for that.  I‚Äôm really looking forward to the unranked playlist, though.
---
U can‚Äôt really spawn rush anything and actually kill someone w the m870
---
Can't read well but it should be combustion of hydrocarbons.
---
Yeah if it‚Äôs just personal taste, like personally I hate the doc elite but some people love it and I‚Äôm not going to judge
---
Ikr it looks like shit honestly

I can't remember when but I remember seeing they took that out because it was pretty much exclusively changing attacker kills into defender teamkills

I also don't like the doc Elite. I also don't like the twitch or the IQ Elites. IQs Elite is really bright and Doc and twitchs Elites are kind of plain
---
After 2-3 mins of waiting if a game doesn‚Äôt load, get out of matchmaking and back in, this is a on Xbox where it won‚Äôt load a game, happens to me all the time
---
##wtf
---
What no I‚Äôm asking for me
---
That's too bad.
---
If someone gets spawn peeked by Caveira, they should know enough not to have a hissy fit and rage quit before being finished off.
---
If they're going to have a tantrum and leave, it should be punished with a regular interrogation.
---
Would dis-encourage leavers even more, and that's always a good thing.
---
Buddy have you played during Operation health ?
---
That's a lie someone awalys dies rather if it's one of them or you but usely it's one of them than you
---
Canada girl
---
Yeah they‚Äôre too bland, I don‚Äôt really like the old time ones but Mira‚Äôs hair looks better on her elite
---
i want the money heist set.
---
So i would have a chance of 2 out of possible 34  just to get the uniform and the headgear.
---
4 out of 34 for full set.
---
Those packs are ridiculous seriously.
---
The textures overall look bad.
---
Just because i stated what I said before doesn't mean I think it's okay though I don't like things like this it just annoys me how people whinge constantly either keep playing or don't.
---
Thats exactly what I thought when he was released
---
He looks more like Bryan Cranston in The Infiltrator
---
Left is Thermite. the right is his retarded cousin Thurrrmayttt
---
I meant any gun at all already in the game. Doesn't have to be an op already in the game, but for future ops of recycled guns are to be a continuing trend.
---
He looks like the one from outbreak trailer (Sierra paradise Part 1)
---
Iqas, asq, ashiq... No, The names don't mix.
---
Would anyone else let thermite burn a hole in your ass hole
---
like the design,hate the graphics.
---
he looks like he went back ps3 era.
---
On consulate if you rush out the main entrance the second the prep faze is over and look to your right past the gate then you have officially spawn rushed
---
Mozzie has no recoil weapons
---
I had a stroke trying to read that can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm dumb or u had terrible wording

Hello Bubbleheadmik3, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Say sike right now
---
My last game was a bless, I got the only 3 people in Gold elo with a microfone! 
---
Funny things aside people don‚Äôt care about ranked anymore or aren‚Äôt playing at all. Even with an broken Ela was it way easier to soloq Plat back in Blood Orchid than it is today. It‚Äôs not that everyone is better these days it‚Äôs just the lag of prober communication, the lag of smart banning and toxicity. Even when they talk 1 out of 20 games they just scream into your ear or don‚Äôt know how to speak polite with a stranger.
---
&gt;If they're going to have a tantrum and leave, it should be punished with a regular interrogation
---
Yeah but that's the thing, THEY aren't the ones being punished. Their team is for something they have no control over. It is not fair in any situation.
---
&gt;Would dis-encourage leavers even more, and that's always a good thing.
---
Casual is a thing. They literally would not care, at all.
---
Blackbeard's Assault Rifle. It would give her more firepower but a head to head gunfight will still favor the defender since the Scar has really low rate of fire and high recoil. Also, I would force a silencer on it so it has even less damage just for good measure.
---
Well, its not our fault if the enemies are killing the Hostage
---
Good play, way to play the angles on the plant. I usually panic and end up just standing in a corner like a jabroni. It is a shame the community is so damn toxic because it is such a fun and original game, don‚Äôt let it get you down.
---
Really have liked it more if it was for Ying but for some reason they have a defender only event planned.
---
Not just Xbox . the consoles and PC
---
3 speed with glazes rifle, RUSH!
---
I am going to have to try that I just spawn peek from the window
---
Ya I started end of wind bastion am level 190

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Beaulo is actually in the devs‚Äô pockets ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It is called arsacyclopentadiene or Arsole
---
It's gonna be on theme park but named doktors castle
---
They just retarded. This is ubisoft what r u expecting lol
---
F
---
There was an exploit discovered by ubi quickly because some asshole on youtube (you know who) shared another glitch with rappling
---
You probably lost because you weren't using glaz
---
Zyklon B could be in the canister.
---
Is that a thing?
---
now wait just a fucking minute
---
Hmm, Seems a bit heavy for her. Integrally suppressed SCAR with no shield, ok. Would you put it to burst fire only?
---
Leaked battlepass looking real nice
---
So like infected, gonna be cool!
---
Never going to let them get me down I have to good of a clan of boys around me that just encourage and support. Yeah the soul - que is fucked but it is such an amazing game that I don't think I'll ever give it up.
---
Riot!
---
This flair is everywhere.
---
What secondary?
---
Clash os the most disgusting char ever
---
Big brain moment, wouldn‚Äôt they be more mad if you just idk win the game on their back while doing nothing???????
---
So it's been disabled?
---
Sus
---
Mozzie underplayed? if you play ranked at high levels or watch league he is played a lot
---
I don't think you understand my post.
---
I've been playing a fair it of Gridlock recently and have really enjoyed it. Her gun is really good, I think her gadget can depend on if there are any roamers plus can be used to stop defusing by slowing them down and possibly finishing off a weakened enemy
---
It says WIP Halloween... Just 9 more months
---
Probably not, but if it makes her too strong, then forcing burst fire should be an option.
---
What do you mean?
---
I don't need black ice I have glaz
---
Thought the same since im autistic
---
why would anyone want to have a conversation with you about this when you start it with a complete and utter lie by saying the packs only cost 30 dollars. All are doing is spreading misinformation to damage control. If you are not a shill, you sure act like one.
---
You are goddamn right sir
---
how does one join the mafia ?
---
DDoSing is a lot harder to deflect than it is to add a new rank, not to mention it is more than likely the job of a completely seperate dev team.
---
Because the games monetizing cosmetics and not an acog scope?
---
Yes, coming up next season in casual
---
Never said there was anything special about what I did. Just enjoying my speed flicks.
---
Make them take more inventory space
---
What is it replacing?
---
Don‚Äôt just breach into rooms if you don‚Äôt have enough intel
---
Ying elite
---
Thank you so much :D
---
I love your flair
---
Except 80% n the comments, you're not the majority in this
---
Is it tho...
---
They said that they would allow crosssaving between console and PC but that Sony will not allow it.
---
Gtfoh with that racist shit
---
Don‚Äôt play it like call of duty
---
You come across as extremely naive with this statement.
---
Only on the TS so far
---
Hell yea
---
You gotta stop with the shill thing dude, being toxic and not providing a coherent argument doesn‚Äôt make you look good.
---
The amount I'm going to scream in this event
---
And think they will because they have some new and old concept art
---
Poyo has caused most of my death today. I was goyo. My teammates are the ones who shot my sheilds.
---
It‚Äôs only been escalating man, been here for an hour
---
okay then, give me your galaxy brain take on why paid lootboxes are fine in Siege but not any other game.
---
I have no idea as well 
---
So I just ban echo then
---
i know. it's not even a totally fixable problem but they should start looking into reports &amp; perma banning at the very least.
---
&amp;
---
I believe that it should always work on defender's behalf. that's just my take otherwise you wouldn't bother to keep an eye on the shield in case the attacker comes because there's not enough time to actually shoot the shield instead of the attacker. I usually go for the attacker's head. That's an instant kill, the shield will just do it's thing and probably leave the attacker alive. I kinda hoped it would work like Kapkan's bomb where you place it and forget about it.
---
Drone
---
What about a scar lite (5.56 less damage than 7.62) 25 rounds, full auto, built in supressor. Although i would like her to have an smg or carbine. I dont want a fast sneaky chick like nike nokk to carry a 5 or 7 kg rifle
---
Yes what this one utters
---
I feel Ubi needs more lower ranks. Go beyond Copper to Tar and Coal. Right now the experience of new players is rubbish because they are in Copper and Bronze where derankers and meme content creators lurk.
---
Having Tar and Coal lower ranked levels means the derankers can just go to their cesspool while any legitimate new player will stay in Copper and Bronze.
---
Wait a bit... he HAS 3 DEPLOYABLE SHIELDS AND ALSO WITH HIS GASTANK?? what.the.fuck.
---
Space ball would be better tbh
---
space?  SPACE! SPAAAAAAAAACE!
---
Huh, it's today, who would've known. Thanks!
---
I myself still have the urge to spam certain keys since young age, so basically Caps lock is getting destroyed.
---
Why though? They've done it with a good amount of games now :(
---
Plus he did get spawnpeeked by tachanka with a a pistol... I think badger is trying to take his spot... and he is coming closer every day.
---
"Oh...
---
...Well s**t"
---
Happy cake day!
---
sick, thanks for the info
---
Who doesn't
---
i'm excited. thanks for the info
---
Where are these leaks coming from?
---
... I'm not autistic
---
i feel like that's what they were trying to do by adding Copper V, Bronze V, &amp; Silver V
---
Ok, so SCAR-LSD. You read my mind on this convo.
---
You are probably right. I used to be one those people that are so addicted to Siege that I would buy all the packs for the skins I want. Seeing him say (it's only 30 dollars total lulz XDDDD) was a bit triggering since I spent way more money than that.
---
The Scorpion has not been buffed nor changed in any of the test I've done and seen. It still has no recoil diamond and is the only primary to not have one.
---
I use it for quiet entries. My sidearm is my primary with n√∏kk, unless I'm in CQC.
---
turtle beaches always did well for me just fragile so if u throw them around a lot they may break easy. so I made upgrade to Steel series which have slightly worse sound, like ever so slightly i can tell but waay more reliable and durable.
---
Here. https://youtu.be/xxEfFjvwhZw
---
I'm proud:)
---
Because apex preys on children with their lootboxes. You can‚Äôt buy standard alpha packs. And EA/Respawn doesn‚Äôt seem to appreciate their player base based on their oddly unprofessional remarks towards all of them
---
It's called Glacier, not Black Ice. I would know because I have it.
---
It is also ironic how Tachanka's armor and turret are a thing of the past, and his weakness is that he can't *move* past it
---
Which means she got a buffed recoil. /s
---
Ela's Skorp is one thing only currently: RNG. THE MOST unreliable gun there is in the game currently, period. Nothing even compares how bad it is. If they changed anything it's way too small of a difference to mean anything.
---
Wtf is your problem dude just why
---
Yeah, La casa de papel
---
people baning new ops = hella gay
---
here you go
---
I shudder at the thought of people reading the new garbage backgrounds and calling them "interesting"
---
I'm more of a 75% casual 25% ranked player but after a full season of just casual and my attempts to try casual+ranked bomb again being unfun, even when I won, makes me wish to play the mode I like in a competitive environment. I would even go for a 3rd party site who had no rewards that set up secure area pugs if that existed. 
---
Also as I mentioned, getting constant "go back to ranked" from callouts and playing for the win instead of time is beginning to grate.
---
Honestly, I'm 90% sure that the copyright thing is just an excuse. The reality is that the siege development team is low on manpower as many devs  are currently working on quarantine
---
Sup mate
---
Yo dude all I did was call you out, you brought the flame so I had to retaliate. I hope we can leave this in good faith.

This has nothing to do with common sense, its a game and as with all things people enjoy getting ‚Äúthings‚Äù if someone wants to spend however much money on something that gives them no advantage over another other than looking cooler* (in their opinion) then let them. I mean its better than buying a gram of crack i guess.
---
I agree: Try to play together with some friends
---
Feels bad
---
Now that is a proper yeet
---
Call me out for what
---
Which is the same as they did with Clash, deployable shields and claymorss at the start of the season. It's annoying, but it does atleast buy them time to find a more appropriate fix, and prevent pro-league matches being won with glitches, which happened in Y4S1.
---
&gt;Jackals tracking,Lions scanning and pulses scanning.

This really sounds like a nightmare.
---
&gt;No,only defenders will get new cosmetics

Disappointing.

Even if you get MVP too, that one headshot was more important than your, say, 6 kills. Istg console players make me UGH.

Ok I bad at seize I am trying to get better and I was in this game so I am allowed to take a pic the post it so leave me the hell alone and go fuck someone else
---
If you know the maps well enough to employ vertical gameplay, and have a half-decent recoil control then sure.
---
Probably make it so that defender gadgets can't kill a downed hostage(if the defender's down him).

Might be too OP tho...

this is what it looks like when brother fight

True, but still this is no excuse to put more in more monetization in the game there is already enough.

Also try to write fluently in another language you didn't learn nowhere.

When unranked comes i'll never play casual.

When they re-did Clubhouse they got rid of the pickup in the junkyard that had 1488 license plates.

Look! It's the stupidifier!

Because your comment was unnecessary and isn't really comparable to Pro players hearing callouts from the casters at a major event?

Also Turtle Beach headphones are terrible.

So you basically put it anywhere you want, and if an enemy is nearby you shoot the back of it and it explodes and leaves some fire on the ground.

She is overal a good chose: good primary, one of the better secundairy's, and a great gadget a hard breacher is a must in every ranked game
---
Zofia main here - Can fully recommend her, alot of utility and very strong guns.
---
There are nods to community pairings/existing rivalries, like Mira's assessment of Ash's [breaching rounds](https://i.imgur.com/xfB1Oro.png):
---
### Attack
---
* Sledge is quite protective of his Brucie. "Oh my god, who touched Brucie?! Alright, who touched my Caber!"
---
* The typical characterisations of Thatcher as a grouch who doesn't like overreliance on technology are basically spot-on.
---
* Ash doesn't have many close friendships, with the notable exception of Castle.
---
* Thermite is working on additional prototypes, and Hibana had some fun evaluating/adjusting the Brimstone charge to improve its power.
---
* Monty is a big proponent of including more VR simulations in Rainbow's training sessions.
---
* Twitch wants to work with Mozzie to reduce her shock drone's vulnerability to pests.
---
* Due to his upbringing in Vladivostok, Glaz is familiar with Chinese language and culture. His use of a thermal scope is a source of great debate between Rainbow's operators.
---
* Thermite laments that Fuze's cluster charges have a distinctively terrifying sound profile, and that high explosives don't [discriminate](https://redd.it/5ohe6i) between friendlies and hostiles.
---
* Blitz is exceptionally fit (even for Rainbow standards) and someone thinks he's the sweetest, funniest person to hang out with.
---
* IQ and Pulse are apparently locked in a prank war in the lab over his joke modifications to her Spectre.
---
### Defence
---
* Smoke has an adopted daughter; as for what's in the canister? &gt;!Only himself and Lesion knows‚Ä¶!&lt;
---
* Mute is big on information security, and isn't a fan of personal questions.
---
* Castle is one of Rainbow's best liked operators, and rescues abused dogs in his downtime.
---
* Pulse has learned to appreciate being more mindful, but doesn't elaborate when Harry presses for details (whether anyone in particular has encouraged this). A possible nod to how one of his [charms](https://redd.it/akbka1) has Hibana's name on it. His heartbeat sensor has also been patented for humanitarian search &amp; rescue uses.
---
* Due to the straightforward nature of Rook's armour plates, they have been bumped from the R&amp;D assessment schedule 4 times. Perhaps a nod to how Rook's gadget is the most underappreciated/overlooked defensive item.
---
* Frost helped evaluate Kapkan's EDDs and quite enjoyed working with him.
---
* Tachanka appears to be struggling to find a place and fit in with the strategy of his team.
---
* J√§ger is quite prone to being overly talkative, and describes his strategy (paraphrased from Pulse) as "continue to cause many salty tears" for their opponents.
---
* Bandit's time undercover was quite a stressful one and the source of many "fantastic rumours" that might only be half-true. He's also a fun uncle with his twin brother's children.
---
Don't care
---
I believe the Fury of 1,000 Gu Mines shall suffice, until then I will smoke bolt the living heck out of him until he gets the gist and puts the scope back on.
---
I hope you know how that word is used
---
Yes , he's a friend
---
Don‚Äôt care about kills to be honest
---
I would say no. You only did half the job and didn't even finish it. But really, who cares? Game is not about aces and kills anyway,
---
Hello Spitfire_Anomaly, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cte9zz/possible_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I‚Äôm not 100% okay with it, but there are some saving graces with it over other titles and a few reasons I‚Äôm not THAT upset by it.
---
1. Everything is purely cosmetic. They aren‚Äôt pay-walling new guns and operators, preventing players from using these things if they don‚Äôt purchase it with real money. There is an earn-able path for operators, and a choice to purchase extra cosmetics if you like. This contrasts with Battlefront 2, since they *prevented* players from earning base game content, not just cosmetics, without paying a LOAD of money to unlock it all instantly. In COD, for example, their practices get worse and worse every year. Supply drops are promised to be cosmetic only, then some months later when people aren‚Äôt paying as much attention, they throw in non-cosmetic unique guns that you can only pay for, or get lucky and get out of supply drops that you can also only pay for.  
---
2. The paid cosmetic packs we get for events are duplicate free. Meaning that if you want everything from the event, you won‚Äôt have to dish out $200 in packs just to make sure you get every item, while getting duplicates along the way.  
---
3. Ubisoft is a company. They have to make money, that‚Äôs just how it is. Yeah it sucks, but you can‚Äôt really expect the designers to just dish out content people don‚Äôt have to purchase to obtain if they don‚Äôt want to. At the end of the day, people had to work on those cosmetic items, (which admittedly look pretty sweet, props to the designers) and they should be able to make the company money off of those. If you‚Äôre a designer, you‚Äôd want to get paid for your work, or in this case, make the company money.  Not to mention, players get 2 free packs by just playing the game during the event, so even if you don‚Äôt buy any cosmetics, you‚Äôre still benefitting.
---
As for the NRG aspect, I agree that people *should* be able to buy the select event skins they want, even if it‚Äôs for R6 credits only. However, it‚Äôs unlikely to happen unfortunately with the larger profit margins loot crates bring to the scene. Doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm okay with the NRG aspect, but I just simply don‚Äôt get the skins.
---
Now, I can understand that there is some sentiment that they shouldn‚Äôt be as expensive, and I‚Äôd agree with everyone on that, but at the end of the day, they‚Äôre just cosmetics. Get them, or don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not going to affect your ability to point and click.
---
YES! i was talking to my freind about this just YESTERDAY! Glad to see we are not the only people who think this is an amazing concept!
---
I don‚Äôt think they should ban him, they should make it like Capitao weapon and count it as a tk
---
Who the fuck mains cav
---
You are either a youtuber or a moron to buy them in siege either.
---
Ok, can we come to a decision? 
---
Half the people i meet say it hasnt been changed.
---
Other half say it has.
---
Or how about we actually credit a hostage kill to Mfer who put explosive can on top of him?
---
Don‚Äôt buy it then
---
English motherfucker, do you speak it?
---
Isn't the bottom left Narcoleptic Nugget? He's a pretty big youtuber and one of my favs behind Bikhini and Snedger, hyped he's got a charm now
---
Hello Kasimirwestkamp, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
*Doofensmirch evil incorporated plays in the back*
---
There's also a Dali set for hibana (tokyo)
---
I think that would be a good idea if kills contributed to more things like your rank
---
Mp5sd / Six12SD
---
Those are the two she should have gotten
---
That‚Äôs cap. You can‚Äôt control shit. It‚Äôs recoil isn‚Äôt predictable it‚Äôs completely random
---
Lacking some reinforced walls to trap some attackers in ^(/s)
---
I thought you can just buy the collection no? For like 60+ bucks
---
Great another post. Everyone knows it's leaked by now?
---
And as if anyone is suprised that there will be packs again. Just don't buy it if you don't like it. It's only cosmetics.
---
Works the same with smoke's cloud, do you see anyone doing it?
---
Tbh even hotter now
---
Not really a big deal, at the end of the day you didn't kill them though.
---
how about no
---
That's thing they have to learn and if they are doing this to troll, well it's not in any way or form worse than just shooting the hostage.
---
Because Doc's revival takes up one of his stim shots. 
---
If he doesn't have any left, he can't do it.
---
Zofia gets to withstand regardless.
---
ye i know but a whole separate weapon with a higher mag count, slightly different appearance and as a primary
---
The current plant timing is too short.
---
Attackers can fast plant and defenders can do easy fast defuses
---
7 seconds mean you have to be more tactical when planting.
---
And you can‚Äôt leave cuz it‚Äôs ranked. Sigh. Oh Ubisoft.
---
Plot twist: pizza guy was ssssksskkss!
---
No? The camera position is still the same but you are able to switch sides much faster and it feels so much better. 
---
Makes better movement players be more agressive and increases skill cap.
---
basically
---
new weapons, map and dialogue might be appearing in this new gamemode
---
i dont mind map reworks they are needed but i feel with reworked maps they should bring new guns and with new maps then they should use old guns so you get at least some new content other than abilities but i get where you are coming from i didnt get last years either after ela and vigil i havent been too over hyped about operators
---
Hello ilyes300, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
Don‚Äôt then, just have your scope covered like I said
---
there are so many guns they havent brought into the game and siege is in my opinion the most tactical FPS game out there and the best of its kind so they could bring any IRL gun into the game or even a remake or an IRL gun and it would be amazing for example reddit went insane when ela got leaked because of the skorpion evo and that was before anybody knew how op it was its just nice to have new guns to look forward to learn
---
this looks like it contains some of the rework... trains are closed being the obvious example, just kinda skimmed through the vid though everything looked cleaner too (less clutter and better lighting)
---
Kinda seems like the little prone holes are going to be for zombies to come out of
---
Whats the issue
---
exactly my point i got no issue with recycling old guns if it works but its still nice to have new guns as there are a lot of options
---
Hello LeglessLegolas0, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.
---
So in short. Whats in the canister?
---
Like the pokemon music
---
1. there is a reason why no new weapons
---
2. we have around 100 unique weapons, more than any other fps shooter
---
3. do you rather have 20 good maps or 10 good maps and 20 shit maps in the map pool?
---
i think you change your mind or?
---
the mira isnt breaking the wall behind it
---
These two new ops look a million times better than the last two at least but now there's no new weapons we're just paying for new abilities.
---
So for Amaru it feels like I'm paying for the ability to swap IQs gadget to a grappling hook and that's it. Laaame
---
Man they‚Äôre making me love Jager even more than i do now
---
I agree making his primary the LMG. 
---
However, I think it should just be a bipod that can be set on some vaultable cover spots with slightly reduced recoil.
---
Yesss
---
This was the first thing i pointed out in the trailer
---
Mission failed
---
I would buy nazi smoke
---
We loaded in for 3 rounds and went up 2-1 now they‚Äôre doing it again ... I mean screw it i got time üòÇ
---
Are you advertising your post on other people's posts?
---
I wish I could get his Outbreak Cinematic face as a skin.
---
Plz!!! I personally love this skin.
---
Think about it.... what new map had anyone liked since operation health? None. Seriously everyone complains about literally every map since health. The majority of them have no real problems. The issue is no one wants to learn new maps. Seriously do you know why bank is the most balanced map? Because people have played it 3 trillion times. It plays out almost identically every time. Give the new maps time and more than 6 months to a year to play out and you may see that happen. But no. People just complain. 
---
And I‚Äôm gonna join them in complaining but not about those maps. I would argue that every map removed with the exception of Hereford (which honestly remove the top floor and it‚Äôs fine), are better maps for ranked than kanal which plays out identically to how it did before. It looks great though
---
Should i have put an /s or /j for joke?
---
only viable on plane really and thats out by next season
---
Sounds cool, do you have any links to those things?
---
What is confusing?

Thanks, redeemed.

It's a completely different group of devs working on Quarantine, so no.

Hello RetroSunset, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

Name a single good game movie. Now combine that with how much this community bitches about literally anything and you know why it won‚Äôt happen
---
Yes, but how they "activate" elites in the game itself?
---
What really do you want them to do, the servers aren't theirs so really not anything they can. Either blame Sony and Microsoft for making it so easy to obtain the IP's or blame Microsoft Azure for not having secure enough servers. I get that Ubi could rent more secure servers but they can't really do anything to stop ddosing because even a more secure server could be hit.
---
I wish they'd keep these events permanent I liked mad house and showdown and this one looks so much fun.
---
now, nothing, although i don‚Äôt know what ‚Äûdam‚Äú means?
---
My brain keeps reading the title as Claptrap, but ITS NOT CLAPTRAP GODDAMNIT
---
is that a hand-awp i see
---
2.6k upvotes now, and you also didn't have to make a comment
---
I would say it works better as it also blocks sight and doesn't destroy the shield, and Smoke can still pass through it.
---
Damage
---
idk about mad house, it was just casual with skins and changed map. but showdown and this one looks good
---
Easily countered run outs. It has more to do with how difficult retakes and how easy plants are.
---
Casuals and low ranks hate run outs, higher ranks hate difficult retakes and easy plants
---
I like to run it with a compensator, reduces the horizontal recoil. With the flash hider you get good recoil on the first 4 shots and the fifth shot goes way off to the right.
---
You seem to be missing the part where he has more than 3 shields in this clip. 
---
Which is a big part of it.
---
Yea, i can see that.
---
oh ok dmg is the actual shortened version btw
---
He's not useless, and if you make him "good" to the lower tiers then imagine how powerful he would be to people who actually play the game to its fullest extent, using all the mechanics.
---
I was able to redeem this. If you do giveaways again I would recommend personally messaging the person just so it doesn't get taken :)
---
would also help to reveal more hackers
---
I want this as a skin for Maestro. I don‚Äôt care how much. I just want this
---
Chalet is well within the win loss differential of every other pro league map. So around 10%. Consulate is just as balanced as chalet but no one complains. So chalet is for all intents and purposes balanced
---
Nah man, the doctor has made his diagnosis.  
---
You now have dyslexia.
---
Someone help, my brain hurts because of this comment

I can't see having any more than two shields being justifiable.

how did the round finish tho?

#*HOW DARE THEY*
---
I'm looking for the same team based PvP like rainbow. Tactical shooters are my guilty pleasure.
---
and i think it keeps being that way (i do not play TTS) the thing is the Ela Elite was not released nor confirmed by Rainbow in any of their platform but they add the metadata to the game for testing purposes i guess.
---
It's technically not an unboxing because he didnt show us opening the pack
---
Didn't even know you could get up there what the fuck

i know its wheatley nut still.......

---
Mind helping my OCD out and changing your name to "existence is pain"?
---
Release date?
---
Honestly I feel like the nade and nitro spam is unavoidable no matter what. If they have like 30 operators on each side then keeping those items restricted to only 3 or 4 operators total makes them pointless to have in the game at all.
---
Looking at season 1, Toykos skin would fit to Ela better
---
Fuck theme park, that map was ass
---
11 sensitivity?
---
Stay the fuck away from d2 then lol. 
---
Insurgency might be a good option. It‚Äôs like the love child from a drunken three way of cod, r6, and cs. I haven‚Äôt played it in months because for fps PvP it‚Äôs r6 or nothing for me. It had some stability issues but a lot of potential months ago. Probably good now
---
Wait you can get on the plane?!?!
---
Or at least Mira as she is spanish and also has short hair.
---
In a few recent tweets by ItsEpi, he explained that the two speed no ACOG was never intentional, and they simply wanted the no 3 speed ACOGs. Even still, they did give him one of the harder to use ACOGs instead of the likes of an MP5, so take that as you will.
---
Besides, I think it‚Äôs good they‚Äôre mixing up the formula as it means Ubi are willing to experiment and diversify Siege instead of sticking to the ground rules. If you ask me, ACOGs should be determined by how good the op themself is, not by their speed
---
Where running out of time... i think i can get us out of his. Just play along. *loud meatball noise*
---
The most recently case was the Smoke elite the content was in the game but not officially released and hackers somehow can pick and see the list of skins available.
---
My boi Lesion really got a good belly
---
i'm new here,thx for the tip
---
Ah yes, the Toxic Tryhard Server
---
Maybe have it be similar to Capitao's smoke bolts.
---
Id rather have fortress or boarder reworked
---
I actually complain all day long about consulate.
---
I don't think it's a fun map, nor balanced one, and hopefully it is on ubi's radar.
---
Any more?
---
Just so you know this sub reddit has rules about posting people‚Äôs game names here even if they‚Äôre cheaters. I‚Äôm not defending him and hope you get him but don‚Äôt get banned from here either

Why‚Äôve you posted this twice??
---
Am I seeing a new sniper operator!? Compact Sniper Rifle!? Whaaaaat
---
Then u deserved it üòÇ #joke
---
I am not entirely sure about this as I am not a UBI dev. But as I am led to believe, the engine which runs the game does not have such capabilities. They would not be able to change engine without making a totally new game. But Quarantine doesnt look like it will have the same impact to gaming as Siege. So lets hope maybe after year 5 they bring out Six Siege II

For sure. I should be on this afternoon if you want to add me //  MuhammadOllie

Pulling a 200 lbs collapsible steel wall reinforcement out of your ass is the height of realism.
---
Hope she doesn‚Äôt ruin the heist by getting to attached to someone.
---
200 lbs is 90.8 kg
---
I like your flair!
---
how about giving him 1 more and allow them to be applied to hatches
---
Sameee I tried so hard to see it
---
It is entirely defender action to place shield there, attacker can't force you to place it there, so I don't see why there should be any leniency. Whoever triggered it does not matter, if hostage died it's Goyo's fault. It's not bad or punishing design, it's just exactly what you should expect to happen, and would be consistent with other interactions. 
---
You however act as if goyo is some special baby boy that needs training wheels and should be prioritzed over other players in a match, cut with that nonsense.  I am all for clever design that does not feel bad in video games, this is however not right way to implement it.
---
First time?

Shields with petrol canisters attached to them. You shoot the canister and it explodes with fire.

that sucks

I think Jager is a pretty cool guy, eh does run outs, lasers grenades, peeks spawns and doesn't afraid of anythign

Not everybody shares this opinion. Some people actually enjoy Hostage and Secure. Everyone is sick of having to play Bomb only. In my case, Bomb is the only mode I truly dislike.
---
Exactly, this is one of those maps you expect to go to OT every time and hope you get the coin flip
---
I thinking more along the lines of Dead by Daylight
---
In the context we‚Äôre talking here is the attacker running into the gadget (ex: smoke cloud). So you‚Äôre arguing that it doesn‚Äôt matter where the shield is placed if the attackers can reach and shoot it hostage in hand they win?
---
Yooo is this actually coming out? I gotta get this when it does I love that show

Ant Man Confirmed for Season 4 R6S operator as anti-drone :3
---
How many do you think he should have ?
---
People, including you just doesnt get what Operation Health was about. It's not a magical thing you can just repeat then every problem goes away. They needed to upgrade their infrastructure, plan out how to deploy stuff faster, how to rollback faster and a way to handle bugs. They achieved every one of them and in fact they even improved upon them thanks to IQ and Clash bugs. They can't do an Operation Health because it is not necessary.
---
Also, people how make new content are not just developers, in fact a lot of them are writers, animators, creative people who cant do shit with the bugs and infrastructure.
---
Coming next season: huge drone you can just throw at your opponent
---
Oh yeah, she has flash bangs instead right? I forgot that wiki and even site is not always correct.

No it wouldn‚Äôt if a majority of pro players didn‚Äôt like a map then it wouldn‚Äôt exist in the pro scene just as I‚Äôm pretty sure that skyscraper is getting removed from pro not 100% sure but I‚Äôve heard it so yes the maps that are in ranked are becausetjey are in pro league because they like them there are plenty of shit maps that are in ranked and not pro league because they aren‚Äôt good maps to be in pro league otherwise explain why outback hereford fortress and tower aren‚Äôt in PL and villa is it‚Äôs because villa is a good enough map to be played at a professional level and the others aren‚Äôt

Hello suited_sandman, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about the newly announced Battle Pass.

Smoke is fine without impacts,many players ise shotgun/smg 11/barbed wire anyways.

You hit the metal bars almost every time... and the times you didn't you just missed...  you shouldn't rely on recoil... you should try to improve your aim and recoil control for follow up shots... I suggest maybe trying solely for headshots on a lone wolf TH with enough grinding you will see improvement! Good Luck Friend!
---
[you mean like this?](https://i.imgur.com/6tCnDVA.png)
---
Whatever happened with spoilertags? :(
---
The awkward angle, the gun kicking up through 2 sets of bars, and your attempts to compensate and control the recoil, caused the bullets to either hit either one of the few bars, or miss sledge's head by a couple of inches.
---
That's just uncluky dude.
---
Pretty solid
---
All of the aces I've seen are on console conincidence? I think NOT (still pretty cool though)
---
I never use barbed wire
---
It would be fun to have an action sack style playlist like Halo has, just weird game modes for a nice change of pace.
---
I swear, this stuff only happens on console
---
Depend of your mouse pad and if youre wrist aiming or not. I play on 400dpi 11 11 83
---
That's so slow though and no fun :(. 
---
On a tactical standing, it's faster so less chance to get peeked when outside.
---
well most players do anyways since the shotgun is enough for rotation purposes.
---
didnt kill anyone with your gun either. just impacts and a knife.
---
I couldn't believe what was happening so hard I couldn't think what to say lol
---
To answer your questions yes, it was buffed a long time ago and became a very viable shotgun
---
Naw

I play on pc and console. The strange thing is that when on pc, it‚Äôs normal. But when on console, everyone thinks it‚Äôs ‚ÄúRainbow 6 let‚Äôs vote kick everyone from the matches for no reason siege‚Äú

Because golds refuse to shoot at his exposed body parts and decide shooting in the middle of his shield is a good idea.

Shield ops incap people when they melee them now. Everyone else kills.
---
A bit harsh ik, sorry
---
They nerfed Shields so that they're not an instant kill anymore
---
The app works via wifi, so anywhere with a stable connection should suffice, though the app itself does not support dualshock controllers.
---
It was a nerf to shields they implemented a few weeks back. It's not really that bad in all honesty.

Am I wrong but who is gonna have the time/ be arsed to do this in a game?

It's not fake,i just had to screenshot the images and then try to add all together in one pic but i fucked up the quality lol.

You can find the videos of the cosmetics ingame on youtube or twitter on Obutu3_ s and the other guys accounts. They made videos showcasing the new halloween event map,the halloween cosmetics,the new elites and the la casa outfits.

I'm glad you asked! you're the first person to do so.
---
See on console aim assist is on in Terro hunt because Terro hunt is meant to be kind of a training experience, to allow people to practice before going online for the "meat" of the game as it were.  Like training wheels on a bike, aim assist *eases* people into the behaviors necessary to play the game with a joystick instead of a mouse.  It corrects the inbuilt error and imprecision of a joystick so that people aren't overwhelmed the second they play normal on a game they just spent 60 bucks on (at the time)
---
Console's naturally imprecise, so aim assist in the practice mode helps people get used to the game.
---
Much like training wheels on a bike though it leads you to bad habits you have to unlearn, which is also why you can turn it off in the settings once you're used to the game's basics and ready to get better.
---
Naturally you can see this is a pretty long train of thought and isn't as concise as my first, deliberately phrased statement.
---
Forsure that would be great I‚Äôll add you when I get home I look forward to it!
---
It being optional doesn't support my outrage so i'll ignore it! /s incase anyone will take this seriously..
---
His aim is great if he were to be on console, but I just can't see him playing the game like a plat because of his strats if he were to use them, I mean most of the clips he uses were just a single kill with a minute of audio, although everyone can agree if any percentage of Siege player played like him on a normal basis, this game would be infinitely more fun.
---
Nice quality bud
---
there is no callout i just pre-fire the well
---
I imagine it's to keep user experience fun. If you wanna retain playerbase it's best to trim out frustrating parts. Ik it's dumb, but I quit everytime I load into favela. I just don't have fun.

 Yea, sometimes the game is just dumb luck and guessing.

Well ‚Äúmost‚Äù experienced players don‚Äôt use laser sights for this exact reason.
---
There really needs to be a new rule that if two or more players leave a ranked match, it's a forefit tie, no team wins. Then again, assholes would do this shit to keep a good team from winning. I'm just growing to hate this game more and more.
---
Honestly, the only good solution is a 24hr ban on anyone who leaves. It'll affect some players who lose power but some sacrifices are necessary.

Not just the scorpion IMO, same with the SMG12 and bearing. I get that they don‚Äôt want those guns to be too strong but the amount pf random recoil is just absurd. Giving it heavy kick is good as long as it‚Äôs not completely unpredictable.

---
Tachanka was my teammate
---
Yo they changed the logo around lmao
---
Exactly - you know, sometimes I feel like being punished for missing 1000 headshots you know?
---
You could try it out and maybe get a nice surprise
---
Aim assist really doesn't help at all with people who are missing shots in multiplayer though. If anything, playing with aim assist will make your aim worse, seeing how it doesn't help you develop any skills or muscle memory used in multiplayer.
---
The people in this clip obviously have played the game for a while, and even though they may be playing badly, it's pretty obvious that they have experience.
---
So saying that aim assist exists for reasons like this isn't very accurate, considering these people know how the game works. Practicing t-hunt with aim assist would actually hurt players' abilities to aim.
---
Aim assist does not exist for a reason remotely related to this clip.
---
It‚Äôs quite possible that helps but the damage per pellet at release was 32 and it was buffed sometime last year to 48.
---
You closed a round you had no right to lose, where everything including defuser timer favored you at every point. Just because you intentionally threw some, but not all, of these advantages away doesn't make it a clutch.
---
That last guy on the other team was on a clutch and you stopped it.

I highly doubt it. PC would definitely have an advantage, unless you're suggesting for it to only be with XBOX and PS4

But maybe one day we will get to the point Cross console play is standard

No u
---
I'm trying to say that this community is hypocritical. When an average Joe was asking for more game modes everyone and their mothers were downvoting him saying that more modes is bad for the game. 
---
Now Ubi does the very same thing this community was seemingly against and no one is bitching about it. 
---
And yes, every decent game with ranked mode has MMR cap since day one and guess fucking what, it doesn't affect the game in any detrimental way, nor does the super-ultra-skilled-no-life rank.
---
Pubg is doing it next season , modern warfare confirmed based on input , so I really want to see a cross between Ps4 and Xbox

I will purposely blow hole in a wall just to not use the door right next to the hole

I mean.. you're an asshole, but you're an impressive asshole.
---
Bruh I play on pc but drop the god complex, your opinion doesn't matter either. The only people who's opinion matters is content creators and pro league players. And quick leaning had EVERYONE in a frenzy 2 seasons ago bitching about how broken it was. Adding it back just makes getting used to a new style of play the last 2 seasons pointless.
---
It's \*possible\* that Ubi doesn't have rights to the 6 logo but blatantly using the image of the operators should be a red flag
---
Looks like OP has switched accounts.. same writing styles and everything
---
I think it's more an issue that there are more upsetting things being released alongside that people are paying more attention to. Nobody cares about que times when we're talking about releasing cash grab passes (battle pass) and various other issues with the new release that might make people stop playing the game.
---
As a plat 2, part of it is because people in gold ranks and below become often so predictable. Strats, spawns &amp; points of entry are generally the same.
---
well you just seen one hahah...
---
Exactly. Me and my buddies are all high gold/low plat and we ban Jackal all the time, simply because we like to roam and he‚Äôs annoying. It‚Äôs a quality of life ban mostly.

---
I love how the breach charge would completely invalidate the effort of putting all those gadgets on the window if it went off first
---
Ban time should definitely be raised. Imo if a team is down a person, the match shouldnt count as a loss. Winners can still have their winnings but losing a person is just too destructive usually. It almost guarantees a loss and is really demoralizing.
---
I mean console always had a mmr cap after platinum
---
They hate me :(

Sounds like he just needs nerfed a little bit, not completely banned from ranked

---

---
Good luck brother
---
There's a battle pass now? :0
---
I am absolutely infatuated with this reply because it is a completely respectable disagreement on most of what I had to say but now I am mostly agreeable with you on most fronts just for your clarity. And yes buffing Ela shit would be great! Lol. It does sadden me that PC is such a favored system amongat developers because it is easier to make games for in comparison to console, yes. But more and more developers are starting to initiate dedicated console test servers. I don't see why it would be such an issue aside from funding to launch a Siege TTS for Xbox and PS4 to help balance out changes made to the game even if it is made based on the top 5% we can still get accurate readings for console players and how these changes work if there was a finite solution such as a TTS. As for everything else you explained I do agree, reluctantly but I agree.
---
No you can't get out of copper because you're doo doo
---
Ash has small hitbox, incredibly fast, arguably one of the best guns in the game and using her correctly has the ability to easily rush in on defenders before they even know what hits them. That combo just easily pisses people off.
---
The people genuinely upset about Ubi taking the EA route is a minority. 
---
Apex sub is currently a huge dumpster fire over Iron Crown debacle with people being angry about insulting monetization. This sub is so soft and with no balls that anyone criticizing Ubi is getting downvoted into oblivion like Ubi is some struggling indie company.
---
Where do live? There might not be data centers near your location.
---
Everybody will be screeching about it on this reddit in 3 months. And Itll definitely have a bigger impact on console players who are already plagued by mnk users who can actually take advantage of this change rather than normal controller users.

You know, I was on my second account playing yesterday for the first time...AND it was running pretty choppy. I‚Äôve never had issues running Siege, plus my settings are medium to low. i5 7600K/1070.
---
[I got bored idk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-fo9S8F3jk)
---
My theory: because every match is a simulation and in a normal circumstance doors would probably be locked but breachable via destruction.
---
Castle barricades represent a situation where a door or window would be reinforced.
---
So to make the simulation realistic but uniform enough across different environment, doors and windows are made to be destructible but noisey by using the boards with spray paint
---
Ah, I see someone stays rappelled on Detention/Supply wall for 3 minutes every time.
---
honestly I love lore in my games and knowing the interactions between everyone so I might buy just for that.
---
Can't find it :(
---
siege has way more weapons in comparison to other fps
---
There's always some kind of unbalance in the game tbh and sometimes it's either fixed or left alone. At the end of the day skill is always needed to win and I'm up for the challenge that would come from this idea of it were to be implemented into the game lol
---
You claim we need a "true" sniper but suggest a 1-shot kill up to 15 meters creating an incentive to go room to room with this cannon. Why would you ever camp a spawn point, look at 3-4 windows the entire match for a split second opportunity to get 1 shot off with your bolt gun and maybe just maybe injure an enemy?
---
The nature of the game is not conducive of a "long-range" character who spends their time on the edge of the map. 90% of the game takes place on the interior of buildings and the characters are designed around exactly that, close quarters engagements and utility. 
---
Glaz sits on the edge of that design by filling your proposed role as loosely as it should. He can sit on the surrounding environment or rope up to windows and hold angles, but he is still capable of maneuvering indoors.
---
Ohhh. I‚Äôm not OP, but I think the point of this post was showing now that whenever attackers drone they Slav squat
---
I got it and although this is an unpopular opinion, I love it
---
Good number of my kapkan kills come from ash or others rushing without thinking.
---
Ash main: How did I die?
---
Teammate: You rushed obj within the first 30 seconds of action, didnt drone at all, hit a Kapkan trap, a 3 gu mines, and then you got zapped by a Twitch drone that Mozzie stole.
---
Ash main: This game is stupid, I'm uninstalling.
---
Ok

People here dont know what a joke is, right?

I‚Äôm level 216 and I‚Äôve never complained about this I level up often enough in triple digit levels it‚Äôs not that hard in double digits especially low double digits.

Not having an i7 doesn't mean he's not high end. He has a killer video card as of now, and he has a 95th generation i5 which has a lower thread count than an i7 8700 previous generation, but has a very good clock speed out of the box and has the same core count. Also, the 2080 is one of the best video cards out right now, and the fact that he has that alone makes him a  high end user compared to the rest of the general population, cause the only thing above his card right now is a 2080ti.
---
It's over defenders, I have the high ground

we need a mick jager face to Jager right fricking now

Lol

Finka and Tachanka are dating
---
Definitely shouldn't be happening IMO.
---
Yup. Played 2 matches against 2 Plat 1's who couldn't hit a fucking barn, and their copper 4 friends who went off and carried the fuck out of them.
---
The whole boosting shit should be punished with no rewards and a renown decrease. Ruins the fucking game for people actually trying to rank up. The MMR lock will force people trying to boost to struggle when they hit high gold/low plat since those players are actually good enough to shut the boosters down.
---
OMG new Halloween patch lets you walk through walls like a ghost!
---
Do both of them get acogs?
---
Yeah but it works properly exclusively only on Sony's Xperia line of phones.
---
before something like that should be added everything in this game needs to be fixed first
---
Warden, most OP op in the game hands down
---
They replaced Terro Hunt achievements with some others
---
The damage-per-shot is one of, if not the, highest (normal) shotties in the game. The RoF sucks, though, so you need to land your shots... everytime.
---
Just imagine what‚Äôs going through the hostage‚Äôs mind lol.
---
**Something's fucked up with achievements: in the same game I got an achievement for five assault rifle kills.**
---
I believe so, I could be wrong though, as I'm fairly new.
---
I did say the guns could be adjusted so that they fit the needs of the Op using it depending on if the Op using it is an attacker or defender. Of course balance is necessary but still when you died from being shot in the back or from a location where you couldn't even see the enemy most of the time I don't think the weapon they used to kill you matters all that much.
---
I don't mind it, since you can now also play unranked and that has all the good maps
---
Have you tried verifying the game files? Or reinstalling? If that doesn't work, is UPlay Installed and working properly? If it's not working through Steam, try launching it through UPlay. 
---
If none of those work, contact Ubisoft support.
---
Also, make sure your drivers are up to date.
---
He needs a nerf
---
Huh?
---
I didn't get them in Terrorist Hunt...
---
Lmao
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs made by Ubisoft... he‚Äôs using next generation hardware on a game that just recently got updated that allowed the 1000 series to run it without breaking. Maybe he should check his drivers
---
There‚Äôs a reason mostly attackers have ARs and DMRs and Defenders have SMGs

New achievements introduced in recent updates, removing terrorist hunt ones for newer achievements in multiplayer.

If it's a Ubisoft problem, they've gotta get their shit together. A Triple A Company that can't handle basic driver updates on their games is bad. I'm sure it's a problem on his drivers or his game files though because I know people who have a 2080 and 2080ti that play Siege just fine.

Use urban evasion to you can prone faster to avoid jackal
---
It would be so broken anyway. A good player will see someone around a corner or on a camera and pop the smoke, quickly run through and tap the attacker since a lot of players are good enough to know angles. This would basically need to be a 3-armor only gadget since roamers would dominate with it. It'd be like tower all over again.

It‚Äôs not a carry if you don‚Äôt win.
---
Agreed. I just thought that players would develop more interest in the game if they could try out different weapons on Ops who don't normally wield them. Playing Twitch with a P90 sounds kind of fun if ypu ask me lol
---
You keep using the term "true sniper" but I dont think you know what it means. Hell I dont think you even know what a sniper is, so quit using the word as a description. You want a super powerful close to mid range op with extreme firepower. Not gonna happen.
---
Funny, but Twitch needs no buffs.
---
I think Kapkan should just be able to mount his explosive to the side of a deployable shield
---
Kinda uncalled for.

Money heist spoiler &gt;!The fact that she got Moscow killed and she didn't even get injured pissed me off so fucking much, they killed my favorite Russian dad!&lt;

This was already in the game before launch. you could pick up dead players weapons. people have been wanting this for a long time.

It shouldn't matter what your gender is in a skill based environment. If you're a girl and you're more skilled than a guy, you should have a spot based on how well you do. Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you deserve a spot on an eSports team roster. 
---
Skill outweighs gender.

No probs. Just trying to be on a level playing field here. I apologise for the harsh comment "if you don't know bla bla bla you don't know how to play breachers bla...". Should have stuck to my usual "....should drink some water".

Wha-
---
Smoke was the only operator that you could practice impact tricking hard breachers over a reinforcement. You could place his gas canister in the backside of the reinforcement, and use his impacts to practice.

AFAIK there are no other operators with throwable gadgets that stick AND has impacts.

Have you seen the like/dislike ratio on the Ubisoft North channel? It's worse.
---
Surprisingly the french one is the only one without more dislikes than likes.
---
Even IGN has more dislikes than likes
---
Honestly don‚Äôt feel bad. I make operations and buffs and nerfs concepts basically for a living on Reddit. I just like that you have a reason to criticize my ideas because you actually explain.
---
I wouldn't support players being able to pick up a dead player's weapons because you'd just have dickheads teamkilling other players just to take their guns. I thought of this idea because I get bored always using an Operator's best weapon and then getting fucked up when I try their lower tier weapons for a change. Even if the idea could supposedly break the game I know I'm not the only person who's ever wondered what an Op would be like if they had different weapons.
---
Then they should just add a private filter so only friends can join
---
OP what are you playing on? And how much time have you put into the game?
---
Cant expect everyone to have god like aim or good aim. Leave him/her alone
---
This kinda makes me mad tbh
---
Wait...I thought this is a joke,but its actually real?!Lmao

I tried this too.  It did not go well.
---
Same!!! There are several windows now that i really want to yoink my self through to see people geek out
---
This should not be allowed
---
Sorry, but you couldn't be more wrong.
---
First, IRL sniping is primarily about reconnaissance, secondarily about firing at enemies from a concealed position, and tertiary about hitting targets at long ranges, in that order. Long-range is out-of-the question in Siege and it's a stretch to give a sniper a large-caliber bolt-action (or any kind of bolt-action rifle) rifle in the situations like those portrayed in Siege UNLESS the goal is to take out material targets or penetrate bullet-proof materials, which is why I designed the role around the anti-material utility and recon.
---
Second, a "sniper" in videogames has no relationship to sniping IRL. I explain what I mean by "true" sniper here:
---
&gt; By "true" sniper I mean a playstyle that focuses on high-risk, high reward shots with a low rate-of-fire from medium-to-long range. Examples of this playstyle in other games would be Scout/AWP users in CS:GO, Kar98/M24 users in PUBG or the Recon class in Battlefield (all typically run bolt-action rifles).
---
If you still don't understand what I'm talking about, I can't help you.
---
Round 2. Blue was defending but orange lost.

Yeah my friend was telling me that you couldn‚Äôt and I felt like that wasn‚Äôt right

Where did that come from

he was stupidly over powered before they nerfed him. his gadget was literally having wall hacks for like 15seconds, he had a 100% pick rate in proleague because of this. after the nerf hes in a more balanced posistion. hes was easier to deal with on all skill levels and doesnt need a buff what so ever (even if the 417 magazine buff was an indirect one)
---
&gt;It‚Äôs a bug so they disabled it.

It itself wasnt a bug, it was disabled because of a bug involving it.

You can't crouch spam using a controller without remapping the buttons or using a scuff controller(unless you haelve weird hands) . I personally think that is cheating aswell because it gives an unfair advantage towards normal players. Also if you don't tap crouch extremely fast you can still do it 4-5 times without much effect of slowing down. This is enough to easily win a gunfight

Honestly same. I can't imagine that speeding up his jammer placement would have any real negative effects on gameplay but we won't know for sure until it gets tested.
---
I think you have a hole in your head
---
Because Lion isn‚Äôt a must pick, but is nice to have if you want to stop people from pushing the defuser, or to force roamers to stand still in order to force them to get pinged or become a still target. If you have friends and can coordinate together, then Lion might be useful for yourselves. But if you haven‚Äôt even tried it yourself, don‚Äôt say that he should be buffed.

ah, now i see where you'Re coming from. okay, that was poorly worded on my part, so i apologize for that. i didn't mean that ubi should implement a map ban phase on top of everything else, but that players get an option in their game settings to avoid 2 or 3 or whatever amount of maps, and when they hit play they just wont be put into a game that runs one of those maps
---
If memory serves it takes him four seconds to place a jammer so maybe shave it down to three

Nah chief. Unbalanced as hell
---
imo amaru is grossly underpowered mainly due to the fact that her gadget is slow and ridiculously loud.  before you even get in the window/hatch the defender is already aiming at your posistion and by the time you touch the ground you are dead. i think the grapple should be abit quieter, like you would have the initial sound of the grapple hitting the window/hatch but then have the reel in sound be quieter until you got closer. and perhaps have her gadget give more delay on breaking barricades so lessen the sound abit more.
---
Didn't Thatcher punch Lion in the face or did I materialize that in my brain?

3 seconds or 2.5 seconds, both would be beneficial. If they did this I could see mute becoming better for roaming as he wouldn‚Äôt have to just put his jammers on site and put them outside to assist him and others while roaming from being droned out or from a Dokkaebi call.

Am I wrong in thinking that the round shouldn‚Äôt end if you‚Äôre both planting or defusing as the clock expires?  Right now you can start planting as the clock expires but you can‚Äôt defuse as the clock expires.  Shouldn‚Äôt they be the same (either way)?

The problem with this idea is that is well effectively remove maps from the map pool.  Let's say you have five maps, when is Sky ever going to be the first choice?  It's always going to be one of the 4 bans.
---
Selecting the map first then populating it from players who have that map in their personal pool (or squad leader's personal pool in the case of a 2+ stack) would allow players not to be matched on maps they don't want to play but also allow players to be matched on less popular maps.  Matchmaking on unpopular maps might take longer, but that would be the (worthwhile imo) trade-off for not forcing players to be matched on those maps.

I think Amaru has potential to be extremely useful on some maps/sites due to her ability to move up hatches. Requires a bit of teamplay as she is so defenceless while using her gadget, but she has potential to enter a lot of places where other attackers cannot and that gives her a lot of power, e.g. entering Consulate Consule office through the hatch, Coastline Aquarium hatch from below etcetera. Fast breaching in through windows is not good, but saves time so at least it's nice to have the option. She could also potentially be used to get onto the roof much faster than other operators and get a good shot at killing slow defenders from skylights and such, but it's not a reliable strat.

Goyo I don't know about, he is very strange. Might be powerful in that he's essentially Smoke but he can afford to die so more expendable. Gadget seems easy to take out though and has potential to hinder defensive team, but with the right bans, team members and gadget placements maybe he could be useful, I really don't know.
---
improve your aim
---
the tactic isn't to rush with it, but rather use grapple when rotating. Amaru will be best operator for that
---
Fuckin MediExcalibur and Lazy Purple be using reddit
---
Kill your sister ?

An update to illustrate the problem.  We have continued playing.  I am now 9 games deep tonight, in Gold 2, and have had a leaver in 5 of them.  4 on my team and 1 on the enemy team.
---
This is the 5th time this has been posted,
---
I'm so glad BRANDS are advertising in siege, I look forward to the starbucks charm
---
It‚Äôs a valid strategy to catch people off guard
---
Kaid is a better bandit with an a acog and is chunky
---
Clues:

1. Stop marking is on left side / Drive lane is left (European Parking Garage?)
---
2. License plates look wide (European?)
---
3. Top inside floor of parking garage (Sky lights?)

Wrestling is different from eSports. Men are biologically physically stronger than women, thus why a female league had to be created so that men didn‚Äôt just obliterate females because of their increased muscle mass and testosterone levels. Thus why there are controversies surrounding trans-women from playing in all women sports.
---
As for video games part, gaming is becoming more and more prevalent for society as a whole and more and more girls do indeed play games. It‚Äôs different from the late 90s and early 2000s because Gaming as a whole is so much more mainstream.
---
I personally think that Siege can withhold an all female team and work on the game more than a league that may not even get much attention. Women can easily join the eSports scene, cause it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs someone gatekeeping them from joining, otherwise they‚Äôd be complete douchebags. Skill just comes down to dexterity and intelligence in eSports after all.
---
It's better than k/d
---
How much was ur pc u can run the game and record a perfect frames I need a better one so could I know ur setup plz
---
GSG9 has also deployed to the Middle East. Does not change the fact they are primarily tasked with domestic counterterrorism.
---
That's the thing skyscraper shouldn't be in ranked, neither should Hereford, theme park or fortress, let's also remember tower, that map was also in ranked for a long time, map bans would allow the community to not have to deal with shitty maps, especially since ubisoft take way too long to remove them from ranked 
---
There's no way at the moment to not play on terrible maps like skyscraper, if people did have the option to choose what maps they do and do not play on that would effect queue times, but if 5 random maps are taken from ranked then the queue times would be the same as they are now
---
Putting terms in Parentheses doesn't do anything, i don't know why you're doing it.
---
No one said anyone was a politician.
---
If you don't want to pay your dues to play your game, then you can fuck off. The game has always been intended as a pay to play online experience.
---
And it doesn't even work
---
See, I quickly realized that while putting one at each possible entrance could sometimes be effective, they were much more useful if I used 2-3 of them near each other as a sort of progressive/recessive defense. 
---
What I mean is, I put one fairly far up (say 20meters off site on one side), then another 10 or so meters behind (varying based on natural map obstacles, doors, etc) so that once I was being pushed, I could retreat, stillusing the shield, but could blow it once they started pushing. The difference was more whether or not I used 2 or 3 in doing that. And even when I used 2, I still had a 3rd to just use at another entrance or hallway.
---
I have the TTS... It's better. It almost has a sort of combo Kanal/Favelas feel. More CQC with a decent amount of mid range major sightlines. I've run a couple t-hunts and I like the 2 new syairways. They are even color coded
---
Another good example.

---
I can't change your mind cuz I fully agree with you...
---
I don't think so, not majorly at least or everyone would be leaning 24/7
---
The point of the game is to win and if defenders aren't ready after 45 seconds that's on them
---
Theoretically, 1.0 should be exactly average.
---
‚ÄòGo on ...‚Äô
---
You‚Äôre very average
---
I'll give it a try. Never really used it since White Noise, when its damage was inconsistent as fuck. Sometimes it wouldn't even DBNO a full health enemy completely inside the crosshairs, and some other times it would send them flying away while hitting them with only half of the crosshair over the target.
---
Night mode shouldn‚Äôt belong in any shooter like siege. Its existence is worthless, frustrating and honestly one of the many completely useless things Ubi has added to this game.
---
Sorry, this was assuming the removal of the ACOG on the f2
---
Hello OmarWelaih, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ctocqe/here_are_my_stats_with_frost_so_far_so_good/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

This is what everyone actually wanted.

F2 would still be much better.

Of his little shtick

It's my own y1 s1 operators

This is some cursed shit

My friend teeter da hostage do

Lion was the smart one.......
---
I heard that snort bro. Nice. xD
---
Do gemstones go through
---
Ok I thought it was something like that
---
Spetsnaz mains rejoice ))))
---
Omg I got that too
---
what?
---
I feel like the way around this is to have a ‚Äúspectator bot‚Äù style implementation. If they can modify the spectator mode so that it is able to watch all 10 players at once (or just rotate around the floors in a birdseye view if everything else is too complex) then ‚Äúrecord‚Äù what is seen and make it available to download for the player, it might be possible. Essentially just every ranked game would have a ‚Äúspectator‚Äù (like in custom games) only it‚Äôs a script that just record and cycles through or etc.
---
The first kills resume my main source of gadget kill for the weekly challenge
---
..aaaaaaaaand it's clipping!
---
No they're bullet proof glass.
---
Y1 S1 of his creation
---
I did too, just wasn‚Äôt a balanced competitive map
---
He's right though. I'm a console guy, but og R6 was way better on PC.
---
The best thing to come out of k-pop.
---
Legit read it that way as well, I was lost
---
Looks like the Money Heist gear
---
But it's meant to hold or peak a long angle like a hallway or to counter a spawn peak
---
Thanks!!!
---
What‚Äôs wrong with legendaries? Do they cost a fuckload? Haven‚Äôt played in a while
---
Not true, Rainbow Six, Rogue Spear, etc had doors. Siege is the only R6 game without doors
---
Ned Flanders was added to the game
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Play siege with me. I will send you an anime pillow
---
Yeah, alpha packs cost 5000 renown, and legendaries are incredibly rare. Alongside that, the pool of legendaries is huge, so it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll get the one you want if you do get one.
---
Those terrorist hunt changes are beyond stupid...
---
Aight
---
Random drop in Alphapacks, so just very unlikely to get... unfortunately.
---
I love it
---
There is a big difference between plat 2 and diamond.
---
They broke hot breaching too
---
Someone is getting sued
---
If so, lion is useless
---
Yah this wouldn't have worked as well if at all on PC. people hear that window break and a quick flick of the wrist and you're being shot at as you fall.
---
What he said they should have all patch notes from then till now
---
It‚Äôs a YouTube highlight video. For every time he wrecked someone with it in his video he probably got killed for using it ten times. It‚Äôs not a good consistent gun. Imo
---
The spawnpeeks on this thing already have the potential to be devastating. 
---
yes.
---
*#OperationRehashedGuns* continues sadly. i would have really really loved it if the new operators brought a Galil, Tavor, F2000, Vz61, just anything that gives us more variety in the weapon arsenal
---
That looks sick
---
lmao I say it to
---
Who cares? Rate it yourself, it‚Äôs not that hard.
---
Your back must hurt
---
No... Why would I be jealous?
---
Skyscraper is absolutely terrible, chalet isn't very good either and for a long time bad maps like Hereford, fortress and theme park have been in ranked and only now are being removed 
---
And I'm trying to be as objective as possible here (which is  difficult because quality is subjective)  but I feel those maps aren't good
---
For example I can recognise that a map like Consulate is more competive than a map I prefer like oregon but I really think those 5 maps(chalet, skyscraper, fortress, Hereford and theme park) are bad and aren't fun in ranked, casual is fine but ranked can't be that competive when unbalanced maps are in it
---
This is epic.
---
Look at the fuckin ping
---
Sounds like someone is upset that they lost the argument :)
---
10/10, ez pz
---
I don't play Zof or Ela but it's so purdy so I'm happy
---
It is a skin for valks spas 12
---
Just give Mira Lion's backpack. the mirrors should fit.
---
Are you playing call of duty or ~~pubg~~ ‚Äúshroud‚Äù
---
Whats wrong with the ping? I see nothing wrong
---
That moment when you get a "black ice" duplicate can I get an "F" in the chat for this person.
---
Just a normal game of R6
---
Big brain plays first we had bandit tricking, but now it's all about that termite tricking.
---
You sure you‚Äôre supposed to be in newcomer?
---
Yeah your right, my average ping is 12,000
---
57 FPS... hmmmmmm
---
What is the name and rarity?

I was being sarcastic just in case you didn't pick up on that. The skin looks good and I wish I had it xD
