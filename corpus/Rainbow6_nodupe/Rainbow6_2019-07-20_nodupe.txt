Her switch speed between gun and shield takes the entire round for one

Dude this is fucking amazing
---
Thank you !
---
r/redditsings
---
I love that gun lol
---
Well thank you. I do feel superior.
---
Rank

She should have ample time to switch in a reasonable situation. Her role is to help get frags, not to frag. In a 1v5, Clash shouldn't win.
---
region?
---
People don't appreciate Fuze enough. One of the best assault rifles on offense, one of the best (imo) LMGs, and the shield (eh?) to boot.
---

---
Also has the PMM.
---
His gadget is pretty "meh", but it's good for catching unsuspecting people on objectives.
---
And if only reporting people actually did anything.
---
*rank*
---
Mozzie
---
First guy has absolute terrible aim. How does he lose a gunfight when you had your back against him in point blank range
---
Pretty much this.
---
Even better is the followup comments of like "dude don't get so mad it's just a game, I'm just messing with you, why you gotta be so butthurt about it" etc etc
---
‚ÄúToxicity‚Äù I was insta banned as I joined a match
---
Why did they organize it like that tho
---
Exactly what I thought. At first I thought he tried to sledge hammer me because he was so close, but then when I rewatched it I saw he shot at me before I even turned so I really don‚Äôt know
---
I have r4c and l85a2 so im cooler than you all
---
You had to have done something.

This is awesome!

I used to rinse scrubs like you in plat every day when this game was good kid üòò

 you deserve it

The game is LITERALLY an attacking and defending game. Or it used to be, before people learned how to abuse shitty game mechanics. Maybe get good?

this blew the fuck up

It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if the hair and mask were a bit different. At least the hair.

The first shot looks like it hit her hand but the other Two are in the head maybe  it is lagging and her hand hitbox is still there

But he gets 7 of them. And they are invisible.

Nice
---
If someone isn‚Äôt loading you say ssd
---
I dont know if I should laugh, cringe, or both
---
Yes that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve heard of it and as mentioned I do know it‚Äôs just a joke
---
No, I quit because people cheat and I'd rather play a game where the player base aren't scum and the Devs aren't useless money grabbing rats who just appease fat cretins like you ü§´
---
Got my second black ice today, don‚Äôt own the op
---
What mod is this?
---
i think it was corross or maybe rogue 9 put out a really good video about what each barrel attachment does and how some of their descriptions are misleading
---
shit
---
Copper 1
---
Funny how you're whole post about quitting the game doesn't mention cheaters at all huh, only talks about roamers
---
Than it comes back and spits lightning killing everyone on the map except him(also his teammates)
---
They'll never expect it
---
I think he needs A small rework I think the base damage is fine but his Gus need to be louder when they are placed
---
No it kills everyone except him. Even the hostage
---
Yes fuse would be proud
---
Then he has to go grab it
---
I have seized this meme, and there is nothing you can do about it.

You just gave him the Bikinibodhi

I think warden isnt a counter to glaz, but instead a counter to a flash/smoke plant

Saw it yesterday and laughed

if it could boomerang I would piss myself put of excitement

Ssd stands for solid state drive, and is a type of storage device on your computer, which is faster than a standard hard drive (hdd) but is more expensive, so if your loading slowly, then it is likely that you are useng a hard drive, and not an ssd
---
Is anyone else noticing the activate windows option?

They reinforced kids

Your in copper rank that‚Äôs why. People in copper, and silver toxic as shit.

Yeah i got this one too, if only i ever used the SPAS-12

I feel ya. I was at silver 3 and because of throwers I got down to bronze 3. It‚Äôs best to queue with friends.
---
Nvm
---
And that's why it's so fucking hard to climb out of it
---
Strafe aimer
---
Sure it's done you wonders but you can still burst! Just do it manually
---
I agree, but i think the extra pressure makes it a bit more competitive, it forces you to be your best every time, and i think that's valid
---
There was a thing where if you got a new account you could/can run recruit if he is ur only unlocked op
---
Nokk? Barbed wire, Lesion's gu mines, Echo's drone, Mozzie's drone, and even barricading that one entry point counters her. 
---
Don't overly rely on watching the cams. As you've mentioned, you died because you made mistake of not paying attention to her. If you see Attackers all coming from similar side, then cover the back of your team's back as Nokk is more likely to come from very different angles. Cover those back lines with barbed wires and close couple of door ways. 
---
The moment Nokk losses her stealthy approach, she becomes the worst Attacker who is the only non-shield Attacker that gets outgunned by almost every Defender who are holding angle.
---
I‚Äôve found jackal mains the easiest to bait. The only time it works is if multiple people are getting the cav outta hiding.
---
Ya the neck does count as head buuuut I believe here he hit her hand.
---
You even say it yourself that the team has to perfect their way first to 3 defence wins. This in return means that your team should perfect the 3 rounds to be on equal footing
---
It's 3:3 rounds atk:def. In ranked and casual is still 1:1 atk:def wdym?
---
The more matches you play the less overall elo you get per match unless you beat people way above your rank
---
Koolaid man OH YEAH
---
Whyd he get downvoted then
---
Yes but the other team should feel exactly the same in my opinion. This gives one team an unfair advantage
---
You can not pick recruit in ranked. (Unless you don't have any operators I think but that was not the case). 
---
What happened there is that OP's friend joined back in the game at the last second after a DC and it gave him recruit...
---
That is the best thing ive ever seen
---
And against Echo it doesn't do much since all Echo needs to know is that Nokk is close by for him to call her general position out, which is enough for coordinated team to hold angle against her. 
---
But yes, it will help against Valk a bit more.
---
The good ol days
---
Honestly, I love the people that track you and the whole team just pushes you one at a time, it's amazing
---
Done!
---
I'm actually playing it and orgasming at every good and old thing I see, never too old for me!
---
Well realistically you really can't hit someone with a shield hard enough to kill them. Unless it's booted to a car.
---
I'm gonna laugh so hard if Warden doesn't get picked at all. 
---
As Op has mentioned, Pro player like Kanto already mentioned that no one is going to pick Nokk or replace other Attackers with her.
---
ik but most of my mates play other games. they have r6 but don't really play it
---
They are a rare breed
---
He knows the crimes he has committed.
---
It was just having some fun in casual, I wouldn‚Äôt care if this happened to me unless it was in ranked
---
This. Kanto already called her a troll pick. Another streamer (can't remember who it was) said that while Nokk is fun, she ultimately doesn't replace anyone in the comp and is a waste of slot which could have been anyone else and provide utility.
---
Well yes but actually no
---
People get mad about it and its controversial, most people above gold know that your putting yourself at a high risk if the enemy knows what they are doing.  In my opinion its not toxic and but somehow people think it is but I‚Äôve never understood why.
---
Well yes but no. People get salty, buts its a viable strat
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
Sorta...
---
If you're doing the spawnpeeking it is considered a strategic preemptive attack.
---
If you're getting spawnpeeked it's considered a sweaty tryhard toxic play.
---
So you think you should be able to do worse and be rewarded for it? If they 3-0 you, and you don't 3-0 them, guess what, your team is worse. Not to mention it makes it way easier to come back from a 3-0. Picture this with the old system of rotation every round, they start defense on Villa. They win, win attack, win defense. Now your team has to win an attack round on Villa, which while they did so so theres no reason your team couldn't, it is still way harder to win that attack on Villa. The 3 defenses means your team much has a much easier time coming back from that 3-0.
---
No
---
lol how many hours?
---
No it doesn't, both teams get exactly the same things to work with. Same bans, same rounds, ect. It's an identical mirror flip.
---
I love how both Mozzie and Maestro likely had shotgun secondarys and they didnt even try going around to the soft wall in the closet.
---
It just fun to do and then you get to see the chat rage and its funny
---
He deserves sand thrown in his eyes
---
Wait a second... If you are able to kill your downed teammate you're probably able to just kill the Cav... 
---
But... I mean... I would definately kill my mate... Cuz I suck...
---
By the way it's only 8 american ops. Castle, pulse, ash, thermite, valkyrie, blackbeard, maverick and warden. I do agree that diversity helps the game though. I feel like the Korean ops help expand there market greatly
---
Don‚Äôt make me Dox you Italian Stallion
---
I almost threw my controller at the wall just from watching this
---
###F
---
But Glaz does (or used to during pre nerf) lots of smoking plant. More so than any other Attackers. Glaz now completely negates Warden as he has far more advantage over Warden. 
---
Other operators who do the flash/smoke plant often involves Gridlock and Nomad, whose gadget often can tell if someone is coming close the defuser so they can hold angles towards different entry points.
---
Ah crap
---
My bad, I was looking at it in a Canadian site, 2070 super is your best bet
---
[removed]
---
Nokk is really just held back by that god awful fmg9 and even then if she was a 3 speed I still think she'd be great/good. Warden, though, just doesn't make sense. I could understand it as a Glaz/Ying counter but even countering their gadgets, he's still weaker than them without having the ability to initiate a play with that immunity.
---
I run suppressor on Mav. I've had aces because I burn a hole and no one knows that I'm shooting or where I'm shooting from until it's too late. The bullet trail hiding is amazing for him.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
That‚Äôs a big mood
---
Ahhh those damn theorists
---
IM SORRY

Fri*ck

I have never heard of Ubisoft doing a double XP event because you player level literally doesn‚Äôt do anything
---
Its just 7 days, itll be a nice break
---
Yeah they really can‚Äôt. In one game it was 2v1 and the guy makes a call out that was extremely wrong and blames me when he dies when his call out was completely wrong side of the objective. I told him his call out was wrong and he called me a retard. Not much you can do with people like that.

Playing crash bandicoot on the ps1 is one of my best childhood memories

So your stunned your friend joined a random game and it happened to be yours?  Ok I‚Äôm not as blown away by it, but hey man have your moment enjoy.

200 iq plays
---
Watching people play on consoles gives me anxiety. I don't know how anyone plays an FPS with a controller.
---
I just congratulate them on each kill with extra enthusiasm, gotta make them feel good about themselves.
---
Everything is preference really. I prefer flash on almost all my weapons. Theres a few outliers, some of them are real weird. I love muzzle on bucks C8 for example. The initial recoil is gone and I can control it fine afterwards. Also I like angled+muzzle on Thatcher's ar33. I dont use it much over the l85, but when I do it's my preferred load out.

I wish it was like that for me. It‚Äôs so hard to try and do good when your teammates will rip you apart if you fail.

Nope PS4. Sorry

I feel like people would find a way to abuse the system and be a toxic asshole for no reason
---
MP5 with ACOG?
---
r/cursedcomments
---
i think they should add the ability to see the remaining amount of reinforcements for each player since in some cases (mostly when the player only has one left) its fine to reinforce next to them.
---
Oh cool now something to give me nightmares right before I go to bed...
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not as powerful as an assault rifle but still has decent firepower dps plus has option for an ACOG if you are into that.
---
What level?

As someone who recently hit 200, I can safely say this game takes a very minimal amount of patience compared to most.  Unless you‚Äôre comparing this to BRs than yeah I suppose

*Agrees &amp; Does it anyway*

Why did you literally repeat his comment

Level 44

The guy that got teamkilled, teamkilled.

And Warden is a mediocre alternative as well, he can‚Äôt destroy or deal with any Frag grenades other then running away and praying/being out of the blast zone

Idk how to do the big bold words but

Check out r/SiegeAcademy

Also learn the map layouts. play terrorist hunt but dont just blow through as fast as you can, take the time to roam the map

I also reccomend watching some YT: varsity gaming. He has some good tips

drone,

Make sure you have earbuds or a headset, and you can hear them,

I could go on, but you'll learn with time

Good luck, and have fun

This was legit when the game basically released that they had it

Taiwan is not China, no way in hell the Chinese government would arm the Taiwanese special force with their own cool stuffs

A game where you are a person called a "tenno" fighting to do... something the story isn't finished yet but you build warframes collect optional stuff install and upgrade mods on weapons and then spend the next hour in trade chat getting the premium currency platinum to speed up your first prime warframe. Primes are from the "orokin" era only obtainable through void relics and the trade chat from other players.
---
That is why my paranoid ass finds a corner to drone

Oh you mean the one that didn‚Äôt fucking exist apart from isolated incidents that it turned out *weren‚Äôt* part of a wave of teens and adolescents ingesting fucking laundry detergent?

Your also a space ninja, and I understand the siege only but is it really only siege or do you play other games?

This pleases me immensely.

Only siege I‚Äôm level 376 on Xbox plus a few lvl 90+ smurfs and a few accounts on pc above 80+

That has gotta get boring

Bullet hole peeks are great and terrible, you need a second to adjust when getting in them. This guy probably didn't even see you.

She actually says ‚Äúplaying my trap card‚Äù but her accent makes it sound like that

Because the Game devs decided that Alibi was going to say that... do you have a problem with that?
---
Its a bug

HWIDs can be spoofed. There isn't much one can do to prevent hackers.

You pleb, you didn‚Äôt even mention the fact that they were lifting their mouse.

Phrasing.

You're ok. Pretty much just DOS you over and over again. If he hasn't already he probably won't. Never join parties from gamertags that aren't on your team if you don't know them. Also, if they message you do not message them back. They can get your IP from that as well.

Nitro cell is a powerful secondary gadget.

J√§ger has one of the best defense gadgets and weapons in the game.

You , know I really thought it was gonna be another Skyrim one

Flipping between the two platforms it's one of my most played games. I've solo'd to plat on both platforms multiple times. Never encountered a sound issue that wasn't headset or port related.

As for thinking the game is in an awful state, it definitely seems to be a minority opinion but maybe I just haven't lingered enough on the sub to tell one way or the other.

Load up a bowl. You earned it!
---
Because a buff doesnt fix Tachanka's problems.  His ability needs to be reworked completely.  
---
Give him a choice of two lmg's for a primary weapon.    
---
His Gadget could be something marginal like an ammo bag similar to rook plates that gives everyone some extra rounds.   
---
Then give him a passive like Zofia(Weapons, Gadget and Passive) which reduces the movespeed penalty of  ADS since a Tachanka was a mobile weapon platform like a horse carriage.
---
He's got smart glasses, give him smart abilities. Give the ability to ping enemies when sighted while it's active.
---
Cos they are boosted diamonds. They only play with their coppers and beat the golds to get to diamond
---
The thing is my team is never doing anything well. They all die with 1-2 minutes still left on the clock and 3 enemys left for me to somehow kill.
---
Its like they have muted their game and just recently started playing r6.... last game before i went off, was a team with 1 dc and 3 guys who got 0 kills within 4 rounds.... they are the reason why im in gold still and not somewhere in plat. This is happening constantly to me. Its like my teammates are bronze and the enemy team are true golds/plats
---
I'm hip. The same idea was probably once applied to something like Bid Whist, lol. If you aren't familiar with the rules: The highest bidder chooses which suit (if any) are Trump cards. So if you're in a situation where you're holding mostly Diamonds and the opponent is calling low Clubs, you will have to rely on your partner and so forth. What normally would be a slam dunk suddenly becomes null and void with the right decision making.

Then consider yourself lucky you haven‚Äôt had the voice chat bug. Whats your take on dropshotting coming back randomly at the start of the season? Yes it was removed again but thats awful software design. Think that was intentional? Or maybe hacking/DDosing being close to an all time worst? Echo drones being completely invisible after the latest patch? Surely you can‚Äôt just ignore all these things

Honestly this has gotten me killed more times then I care to mention. I understand why we can't have free leaning like PC does because of controller limitations but theres gotta be some sort of work around for this. Ubi pls.
---
He‚Äôs really just an annoyance tbh
---
no, why should it?!
---
what does that have to do with my question? i'm a console player myself
---
just keep playing and you‚Äôll get better! I recommend guides on who to play / how to play if you want to get into ranked. also stick to using the same op for ranked to get used to their playstyle and only switch when you‚Äôre comfortable or bored
---

Ballon boy from fnaf?

I wasn't saying im bad, not at all, I'm actually very comfortable in ranked, ignore the copper 1, every game is a 4v5 overtime

thats bull

every game for the first few months i encoutred smurfs and shit fuck this shit

I never said you were bad, I just want everyone to be as good as they can :)
---
I wonder what would be the best way to change him. 
---
I‚Äôd be surprised if Pros use Warden often.
---
just get out of copper, if you have a hard time get new teammates or change how you play
---
Still, wasnt really the point of the discussion, it was meant to be a post for pack openings and black ice but i appreciate the notion
---
By that logic at low ranks how often do you see Bandit/Kaid tricking? Because if that doesn't happen a Thatcher + Thermite combo with even very little coordination will open up a wall pretty much each time guaranteed with no real opposition.
---
So by low rank standards Thatcher and Thermite have "no counters" when dealing with a wall.
---
Holy shit
---
Don‚Äôt lose them all at once buddy :)
---
A generally younger playerbase, otherwise there isnt much definite reasons
---
Ah ok. Cheers dude.

Hello ScarFVC, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cfk5w3/how_2_showdown/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
what did you say to him in knife morsecode
---
It's much easier and cheaper to get a console so that's what most younger kids and toxic people get. You don't spend $1000 on a computer to be toxic but there are still those people on pc
---
For me having cheater in enemy team is fun. I tell him to do some funny stuff (works most of the time). I also have fun I'm trying to get him on a Frost trap etc. And next in next copule of days I get my elo back so next time just have fun playing with cheater in enemy team.
---
If I weren't so cheap I'd give gold, just so you had to add an edit.
---
thats the issue i have won six game straight and only ranked up once cause of this bull  
---
at the start of the season i lost cause of smurfs and hackers now siege fucks me over
---
Yeah I‚Äôd probably support that claim. Generally the console scene is younger kids or more casual gamers in general which can really fuel toxicity
---
Not to mention people forget that the longer some ops are alive the harder it is to plant anyway.
---
Had OP started to plant with a Smoke still alive he would have failed just as much as he would have with a Gu mine or a Yokai burst. Heck even a Pulse under the soft floor with a Nitro would do it.
---
I know what you mean. I never used this gun
---
Looks more like shark skin for F2
---
I feel like your building a straw man out of my argument but I'll run with it for the sake of argument. Playing at the Silver level I see very few Thatcher picks unless I'm the one that picks him and even fewer Thermites in conjunction with that. Even if Thermite and Thatcher are on the same team I rarely see coordination from them as one or the other usually runs off to do their own thing. The argument isn't "You never see these things so theres no counter" its more like "These mechanics exist and thus give the possibilty of a counter but rarely happen." Team shotting is hugely effective against shield ops as I previously mentioned however the likelihood of it happening in unorganized play is extremely low.
---
Not perfect. It‚Äôs a little off
---
Mira is at 15k rn snd Lesion is going down next season,m
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
cake happy day
---
Oof
---
Thank you very much kind person!
---
Teabag. The international sign of a 1000 things.
---
it's very likely that you're missing a lot of map knowledge, which is normal considering your level. you're actually doing quite well in spite of that, but getting nearly plat is one helluva tall order. I'd say take some time to learn the maps and just play the game, the rank will come on its own as your knowledge increases!
---
I don't know shit about AMD, but for reference:
---
I'm running an i7 7700 and an RTX 2080, at 1080p max settings I get roughly 160 FPS average. CPU maxes out at 100% usage, GPU jumps around between 75 and 90% usage, with a better CPU I'd be probably pushing a maybe 180-200 FPS average.
---
You probably want a 2070 Super/standard 2080/1080 Ti.
---
probably the same time you get a new daily challenge.
---
It must depend on how severe the name is, one of my friends changed his name to look similar to Heil Hitler and he got banned.
---
Lesion's more fun alright, good gun and all. 
---
But Mira might be more useful, even vital, on some objectives. For the gun it's a very rapid fire with big recoil, but you headshot easily somehow. 
---
If you're solo queuing lesion is not for you because it's better to tell where the gu hit exactly.
---
If im not anchor, there isnt anyone defending the site because they're all busy hiding under a table in some random corner in the map or they're running around with doc and get themselves killed very stupidly
---
I can be roamer and kill 3 people and then die myself, those 2 people that remain will 6-7/10 times still manage to kill whatever remains of my team on that point.
---
The guy was practically standing still, although it was impressive for console
---
Oh, thanks dude!
---
When does the next season start?
---
Ahhh that MP7 looking hot (just pissing off the stoopid bot)
---
Adorable
---
I was trying to do it , most of the time it worked , anyone has a video explaining hatches and wall tricks for maverick ?
---
looks like he is bot or something doesnt looks nice
---
spawnpeeking is a meme tactic, it's certainly not "tryhard"
---
I think the one i watched was by gavinacity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdrk8J5uI2M&amp;t=118s
---
unlikely. but maybe a cheap skin for a single weapon?
---
So this is how solo queuers talk
---
F
---
Never said the plan was fool proof lol
---
&gt; those 2 people that remain will 6-7/10 times still manage to kill whatever remains of my team on that point.
---
Yeah that's the worst. Such a helpless feeling when you watch it as you know it's about to happen.
---
I‚Äôm more impressed with that flick

Kick the computer in the top left so it destroys only a half, you can run on it and still vault, this is how I do it.
---
Shes summoning the power to DDOS everyone on the other team
---
Stop complaining at least it isn‚Äôt gamebreaking
---
Back when picking ash got you a vote to kick lol
---
Sweet, thanks.

Hopefully they figure it out quickly.

Well it is annoying

I'm wolfys friend. I've been playing for 1600 hours on siege, pc and ps4. 1 Black ice lmao
---
No, it really wasn't.
---
Ngl that just makes it even more impressive
---
They even play Lion and Dokka...
---
I bought the season pass and 3 ops I think
---
Would me mad rad to see some attackers. If you don't know which to draw my favorites (not mains) are Ying, Buck and Finka
---
And we main the same defense just swap Cav for Lesion
---
4 scans every 2.5 sec a ping noway he is going to be even more annoying
---
I must upvote.
---
Great idea. I personally think that most older operators need a rework every once and a while just because of how the game evolves so much. I enjoy reading these ideas and seeing what people think a more balanced idea would be.
---
Why'd you hide all the ranks (:
---
Are you anchoring by any chance?

I really like that elite skin. Cool animation (unlike Lesion) and looks nice and different from the original. We do have enough WW1/2 themed elites already and plague doctor would just not fit into the series of elite skins. All of them show a different approach at the operator, but are still combat focused. For a combat focused game, I'd also like to keep it like that.
---

And I know it's a joke.

You basically never put the suppressor on any weapon.

what is ur rank i just want to know out of curiosity
---
Why do you mean you cant get a clear shot without a tk? If you are in melee range you dont move around her you just melee and shoot her in the leg...
---
I know, what‚Äôs worse that it‚Äôs harder on defence then attack
---
Clash can just stand near the entrance to the objective, not let enemies get past. If you don't have grenades you are fucked.
---
Fimally you'll be able to play ranked with your friends like a real grown up
---
this is just you guys bullying someone tho... whad they do?
---
Fair enough we have diffeeent opinions. I just hate casual with a passion
---
At least we can have opinions here , I think? Wait I'll test it :
---
"FORTNITE GOOD" 
---
Now to wait for all the haters
---
I agree, not because of her shield but because she's uglier than sin.
---
I don't know if I agree on that
---
this dude deserves an award, but no reddit coins sad
---
Ugh. The doc I played with last watched me get shot and downed, then while staring at me from across the room proceeded to over heal himself. He got shot in the face and we lost.
---
thats no true at all... she isnt like monty, you can melee her shield away. Its why she has the lowest win delta of any operator. 3 times lower than even chanka or castle. Shes objectively terrible. She sure as fuck isnt broken. If the only way for you to kill someone is to spin, and blind flick someone's head, no shit shes going to be awful
---
*Ela Main logic* fixed that for you mate.
---
Yes, i actually agree. When i see clash r34, i feel like puking
---
I meant when shes on my team for that part and she has an enemy in front of her
---
This sub is full of toxic children, don‚Äôt even waste your energy man.
---
Oh thank you

Rainbow six is a 4vs5 simulator when you play with randoms.

OP just got an achievement for pistol kills during clip, so I would assume that it's all new players.
---
Daaamn!!
---
Thatcher, Ash, Zofia, Thermite, Sledge and Buck
---
They aren't available anymore?
---
I guess I‚Äôm just shit on defence XD
---
Lmao
---
My best R6s play time was when they removed clash for the bug.
---
I want that lovely time back.
---
**Remove Clash pls.**
---
Monty's tower shield can block a door, Clash's gets meleed to the side and she gets stunned, so you get to shoot her for free. Honestly if you tank some electricity she cant do anything. The only decent way to do that is if shes standing behind a deployable shield, but even then thats so much wasted resource and shes still not great
---
Yo do you got any more of this?
---
Looks fucking sick cunt
---
Why is your laser green
---
Shes cancer now. And you completely missed my point. She can still be help people if she gets buffed, but right now shes useless on her own, which is not ok. NO operator should be useless on their own.
---
To be fair, theres solutions to not having to deal with some of these problems. If people on your team are shit talking you just simply mute them. It literally takes 5 seconds of your time. If you constantly find that people on your team are throwing then just find people to play with instead of solo queuing. Solo queuing is probably one of the worst things to do in a competitive mode. Now if people are booting you're kinda shit out of luck lol.
---
Ubi don't listen to just the sub, we know that they take feedback from pros, high ranks and general playerbase combined, they then look at stats and other observations to make their calls.
---
It's not a case of them listening to just one person.
---
With his pinky finger up as well lol
---
Well for reference I have an alt that's lvl 14, it has 3h18m played. Shouldn't take more than 10 hours.
---
Sad thing is it‚Äôs plat
---
Is your mic just extremely quiet?
---
And does it work for things other than siege?
---
I want my noobtubes with danger close
---
Well shit. Before trying using the task manager method I re-installed the game. It is a bitch since Ubis downloads suck ass but it might be worth it
---
Tosic bois

Yeah that‚Äôs way better

Rainbow Six doesn‚Äôt support HDR right now so I would recommend just having your monitor colours balanced and as accurate as possible for the best experience.
---
Kanal is fine

r/whoosh
---
I was just trying to make a measurement. It's a common problem with millennial kids to be unable accept responsibility for their actions. They never seem to have any shame for their conduct.
---
Theme park is fine :(
---
That's a lot of hackers vanqusied.
---
I'm saying it now, as other have, recycling weapons is going to fuck Ubi when it comes to balancing.  They now are limited to only balancing Warden via his gadget and armor/speed. They touch any of his guns it will have a knock down affect and buff Ops that don't need buffs.
---
That was another one of the first things I did. My frustration levels are through the roof right now lmao. Thanks ubisoft, very good
---
Challenger leagues? Maybe?
---
I feel you dude. For me it started when I got my laptop back from the repairs, for the first 2 days nothing worked. You should contact Ubi and ask them what the fuck is up
---
And that is why your idea is stupid
---
Oh I see. Sorry if i sounded rude i misunderstood
---
Their shelter has become their tomb!
---
Most people leave on purpose u can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs not true everyday I deal with it a doubt that many people have emergency‚Äôs
---
They did, and it has ruined a lot of operators and the game itself. 
---
They are much better now, by actually listening to pros. Eg. the new Kafe had loads of pro input and now it is pretty much the best map in the game.
---
I genuinely feel sorry for you.
---
"I have no clue what to do anymore and it is only in Rainbow Six... "
---
Examples of "ruined" cases?
---
Thank you, your kindness will be remembered
---
You could say this about all shield operators as well
---
Set it as advanced deployment in settings ‚Äî-&gt; controls
---
..You just gave me a horrible.. horrible idea.
---
Is your reddit the same as your Xbox?
---
Haven't been ranked in over a year, you have very very little ranked experience even when you did play and to top it off when you have played you e been bronze and silver tops.
---
I'm not shitting on you or making jokes in any way, I'm just saying you haven't played at a level to know if BB or pretty much anyone else is overpowered or not. The game is balanced from pro league and high ranks down. They balance it around people who actually know how to get the absolute most out of every operator, you've simply never went against people who know how to get the most out of operators like BB.
---
You have never played tuber simulator
---
? Well it‚Äôs not me
---
Playing the objective?
---
Because playing recruit proves you are not playing competitively or as a team. The recruit does not offer teamwork.
---
Average is around Silver 1 to Gold 3, so you're average!
---
Yup
---
Shut up fat boomer
---
Haha alright mate
---
Cool chibi. If you made it, you could put it as creative or if not, you could just dub it as fluff
---
Am i the only one who things that this skin is overrated. looks like candy that stood to much in the closet and got rlly plasticy.
---
Yup. Same thing happened to me. But I didn‚Äôt actually know they were hacking. It was a rando and I still get punished for it. Makes sense, right?
---
My favorite defender. The gadget if used properly provides plenty of Intel for the team, the shotgun pistol makes her roaming ability one of the best with hatch escapes and unexpected murder holes off objective without the loud bang of an impact
---
I don‚Äôt play ranked because it‚Äôs really really toxic. And I‚Äôve played against people who know how to play BB, Xbox has plats playing casual every time
---
Bruh.
---
Nah man, I'm sure your fine too! This isn't how I always play either, this Is just one of my good clips.
---
Not dumb so much as, in his case, wholly meaningless.
---
Yes ela isn't overpowered with a gun that can easily win 3 engagements with one clip, 4 mines that provide intel and render enemies unable to fight back effectively, and 2 impacts to rotate off.
---
Also lion was and is fun to play against when you can't fight back during a plant. And it took alot of skill to play him so it is fair.
---
Thank you, I'm thinking of adding to the subreddit more often and just need help with what the flairs mean

Y‚Äôall are really not getting what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs fun doing stuff like that rather than just planting the defuser. Add some spice to that gameplay rather than trapping someone in a corner and just winning. Launch some corpses, because that‚Äôs what I love about Siege is the corpse launches
---
Most are pretty self explanatory, but feel free to ask
---
I'm pretty sure Coppers are just as bad on PC.
---
I remember doing this on my smurf account just for them to change what level you have to be but congrats man
---
It was so much fun recruit rushing the enemy team though! It was effective for me at least
---
Good luck my friend
---
Congrats my dude. Hopefully I‚Äôll be there someday to be a forever bronze
---
Me playing r6: I like crossovers
---
This boi: your wish has been granted

What's even more amazing is that it's on 3F Packaging Room, the worst Objective in the game.

Not bad as an idea but i think fortress could stay
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Yeah. They don‚Äôt need to make it louder then need to make it consistent.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people hate clash so much.   I almost never see her win a 1v1, almost never get killed by her, and haven‚Äôt had a problem killing her.
---
Yeah, casual. Completely different environment than ranked and up. There's nothing I can do to convince you I'm right, I just am. If you ever really get into siege and rank up playing in at least high gold consistently you will agree. Until then there's nothing I can do to make you realize that it's fact.
---
Fluff Litterally just means random or it can‚Äôt be assigned to another catagory.
---
Yeah sure. If that‚Äôs what you think.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try and keep an eye out and just leave the game, probably going to be leaving a lot of games haha
---
I lost power once while playing. Felt terrible for my team. I'm considering spending the 7k for a standby generator. Not just because of games, but a good home investment to prevent costly issues.
---
This thatcher is seriously good at this game, prolly deep diamond
---
I understand she didn't need a buff. It was just an idea for people who have skins for her, and wanted to use her and hide in plain sight like how macie does. This idea would just give the choice between still allowing her to do how you use her and for other players who say shes "boring because she can't use skins well". You would still be able to use your strat. I didn't know what to call this idea because it doesn't even feel like a buff or a nerf. It was more a comfort thing for players thats all.
---
Favela for sure, most attacker sided map in the game, especially 3F Packaging Room.
---
Used to be on console. He has enough lvls to play ranked but we were playing with some below lvl 30.

Yay

Once you faced a hack more than once you can kinda make a tactic that can kill the guy. Unless there‚Äôs a guy who teleports and plants the bomb during preparation phase

Monty needs no buffs.
---
And believe me, given how much pros and diamonds are asking for nerfs, he'll see another this year.

It‚Äôs not a realistic game.

Definitely not.

They‚Äôre such satisfying kills!

I sit, just not on a 'gaming chair'

It's level 50 he's making a joke too....
---
They are most likely doing it in order to earn more XP and level up faster... Just so they could unlock ranked faster. Nothing to do with having fun.
---
Defo
---
Also zofia for her concussion messes up clash, and Capitao arrows toast her real crispy.
---
Every chair is a gaming chair
---
ikr, a while back I got one with Valk and her d50
---
Give it up to this guy because he no shit got it right that‚Äôs my favorite skin but I don‚Äôt have it on a single gun
---
U can use cheat engine offline to get level 25 in under 5min
---
Source : used to do it myself.
---
To add you cant get banned for it since you are disabling EAC easy anti cheat, and can do whatever you want regardless in offline.
---
100% this, best way to counter her. If she's the only one left, and she's shocking you, rush her, smack shield and shoot, rinse &amp; repeat.

---
Ahhh
---
Rip Castle
---
There's an issue with that.
---
Granted you want to give it more "complexity", but fundamentally what it is is that it is increasing the time to breach.
---
In year 3 end, they said that they CANNOT increase the duration of breaching, due to it causing more issues. So it has to be what it is.
---
Plus, Mav is NOT a full fledged hard  breacher, and given the nature of his gadget, despite your changes would still not be one. He will always be somebody who makes the equivalent of punch holes on hard walls, and plays support to other major hard breachers, also because nothing can replace a Thermite or hibana opening up a full wall unless a new full fledged hard breacher is introduced.
---
Yeah I thought it would show but it didn't. It should be fixed now. Sorry.
---
Yea do that r6 is always fun with friends

U know it‚Äôs called ranked for a reason right u don‚Äôt play ranked if u don‚Äôt care about winning plain and simple and yes it‚Äôs just a video game but people like the ones a talked about ruin the game. When I play ranked I wanna win to get better fun is not the only thing u have to care about
---
I kept getting dc'd last night, when I went to reconnect I'd be placed in a new match. Restarting the console and game didn't help and ended up having 5 abandon in less than 10 mins. I personally wouldn't want a longer penalty if something happens that's outside my control.
---
I bust out the "sweaty" comments when somebody starts talkin shit. Like some fucking plat 1 hops in a game pixel peaking angles spawnpeaking and doing runouts, worst of all playing blitz, then he calls my silver ass "trash." Like bruh how serious do you have to take this game to try so damn hard against someone not even close to in your league.
---
Idk. Check it for yourself.
---
Ouch
---
Who do you play as mainly
---
Why did he keep planting?
---
They add something different to the game, I'm fine with CBRN ops
---
Off zofia / nokk def doc/j√§ger
---
Personally, I‚Äôve never really had a problem with him making those holes. I can almost always hear it if It‚Äôs close enough to give them an angle to me. I‚Äôve heard the thing breaking a hole into walls from across the room whilst being shot at going through barbed wire. I don‚Äôt understand the noise element that people complain about.
---
Probably a bug
---
Recruits in Ranked. üòÄ
---
Save for next season.
---
Perfection
---
Through a wall or object or just out of ads line of fire. Emp wins. But if it comes anywhere in sight of an ads.ads wins. Use your thatchers in chink of doorways and outer walls and whatnot to dispose of jagers ads.
---
Hibanas ar shreds people though, and she has an smg sidearm.
---
I think ADS saps the EMP grenade, so you have to get it through a wall or shoot it.
---
I would love to use him more but I solo que mostly and unless there is a very coordinated plan, he's either blocking teammates or his walls are easily destroyed without much risk taken by the enemy. 
---
Maybe make them go almost to the floor to block drones but still allow sound through.
---
I won‚Äôt be reaching that anytime soon haha but hopefully I‚Äôll barely see any hackers too
---
it‚Äôs bc their level isn‚Äôt high enough for ranked yet so they do really good and get a lot of xp to quickly level up, seems dumb if i was hacking i would wait so i don‚Äôt get banned prematurely
---
So obviously I have no idea how this works but can you use this same "trick" to do some dumb shit like hit level 3000?
---
It was a full rush + blitz so I guess some iq was lost along the way
---
I think it‚Äôs because I never played newcomer, I went straight into casual with my level 130 friend. So my first couple months of terrible play all went into my k/d. Sorry if that doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
Tfw you run out of ammonia
---
Absolutely. I think gadget tweaks will be enough to get her to where she is supposed to be.
---
If anything else it should be a small FMG9 range buff or small DPS increase but then that also risks over buffing Smoke, who is already very strong imo.
---
Its happened on Club, second floor (cash and cctv) and Consulate (garage). Somebody, try this in custom lobby, i dont have people to check this normally
---
I'll try using it for a while then.
---
How many days u got man
---
Fuck of with your damn copypasta
---
How are you a 170 in copper 4
---
Thanks for the heads up and yeah that‚Äôs the same on console haha.
---
Haha fair enough
---
That would be such a good QoL improvement
---
Good. At least we have a consensus.
---
I solo q 90% of the time.
---
I have no clue who to recommend to you.
---
Ots justified that three people if good enough and not needing a carry would win if they know how to play. So stop complaining and shoot people.
---
About to test this out.
---
If anything it's got worse
---
I only get triggered if people spawn peek in casual. Dial it back just a little bit
---
Welcome to Reddit.
---
At this point a majority of people solo queue I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the reason ü§£
---
On ps4 casual is so toxic, ranked is more fun anymore. Casual is full of revenge tks for uduots running I front of me, and there are at least 2 vote 2 picks a game. Also like every match I join anymore is in progress because there is an epidemic of people who leave after they get killed.
---
Yeah I never played newcomer either since I started (my current account) in white noise so there was no newcomer. For a while my kd was really low like 0.5 or 0.7 but I eventually pulled my act together and brought it above 1.0
---
I‚Äôve finally started playing well, so eventually it should go up
---
i‚Äôm proud of 8 and 5 against a diamond sweat good job!
---
Thanks
---
I never said she was good, she's just annoying.
---
üëå
---
Grats on the 7 extra renown though.
---
You might like vigil since roaming seems to be your thing.
---
Castle is probably the worst defensive op because he actually counters other defending ops (kap-kan and pretty much any late game roamer) and his barricades acually help fuse and keep him from getting hit. I only go castle when I get him in random pick
---
Hanz 
---
Get ze Luger
---
Best operator?
---
&gt;Casual should be closer to ranked.
---
casual is casual mate. if you want to play for keeps go rank. if you want to just play and chill go casual
---
I'm stuck in silver on console because I place gold 3 or 2 and my brother thinks he's good and cranks me to silver, and my team is always playing bad while the enemy team is more coordinated than C9 is. I also dont have any friends to play with. So I solo queue.
---
Watch Macie Jay's video on her and you'll get some goof info.
---
Poor Jager
---
Their system works as intended if those players are truly coppers and silvers. Its not working as intended if those players are plat smurf accounts. They're abusing the system to get an advantage.
---
I know but I didn‚Äôt know people could be banned from the site
---
But what if your mom calls you for dinner? You don‚Äôt want a spanking if you‚Äôre late.
---
Way i pick castle:
---
The map is non good for tachanka
---
I don't want to play maestro
---
mozzie
---
They probably get the belt from their dads and need to take it out on "lesser people".
---
I watched it a few days ago then just watched it a few minutes ago
---
Every shield should be taken out of the game or at least out of ranked. Even in cod there are tons of things in the game that they don‚Äôt allow you to use in competitive play I‚Äôm not sure why siege doesn‚Äôt do the same thing
---
That‚Äôs really funny because I believe I made this
---
Looks hella cool üëç
---
I wish you well buddy, let me know how it works out
---
What's your level? Because after around 250 it takes forever to get even a single level. I think it's about 5-6 hours of playtime for a level for me at 280 something.  
---
Definitely not something you'll actively be grinding, but it's a nice passive income of cosmetics.
---
You can now trade character skins. I haven‚Äôt played in a long time either, and even then I only played 3 or so games. I just heard about it being implemented a long time ago.

P10 has no recoil and minimal damage. Use his commando with whatever youd run on jager.

---
I think it's cool :(
---
I‚Äôve gotten two super 90 black ices :(
---
Imma need some context as im very familiar with the game so there are things i still dont know
---
Really i didn‚Äôt know but I guess that happens sometimes if you want I could credit you
---
Ubi stopped doing that for whatever reason. I know because I made a new account so I can have a fresh new name and I only had year 3 and 4 ops since I have the passes and recruit.
---
I‚Äôve found loading them up outside the walkways better
---
no you cannot control where your born. But your shitty internet is your issue not Ubisofts.
---
All you have to do is restart your game it‚Äôs a glitch. Once you restart it it will give you an option to rejoin.
---
For me I just need to restart my game or press the button to switch profiles and when I reconnect it gives me the prompt to rejoin
---
Mmm k really
---
Dude. Jam lol if you know you have bad connection don't be a dick an go into a ranked game. You know you're gunna be dropping in and out so how is that fair on the four other people that have to pick up your slack?
---
First of all, is this game even realistic? Ask yourself that first (This is a worse version of the prisma, as the gadget has to go around the whole doorframe.) Second of all, the Shotgun is average, and the SMG's DPS is 459. Now yes, that is slightly higher than average, but Bandit's MP7 has a whopping 480 DPS, and right behind my version of the MP7 comes Mozzie's Commando 9, with a 450 DPS. Yes, it is one of the higher ups, but you have to remember that the Defenders are at a loss when it comes to their DPS vs Attackers DPS with their Assault Rifles. Third thing is that yes, Myte might not be the most useful, but at the same time she can use her gadget as a way to make people feel safe. For example, most people aren't going to drone out smaller rooms and instead are going to take a quick peak outside the door or window to see if its clear. It also means that someone might jump through a window because it looks clear inside and get killed where they thought they checked. It might be more situational, like Warden for example, but it still has its uses.
---
The rando I was playing with hit level 30 (unlocking ranked) but I got the message I unlocked ranked too
---
I spawnpeeked someone on Oregon on a casual waiting for my squad to get on and he messaged me(PS4) and asked if i could stop sweating in casual by spawnpeeking, i replied by saying he can use his drones or not just rush headlong towards the building
---
Hate to break it to you, but you aren't the community.
---
So tell me, why did they opened a server in south africa ? they internet is not better than ours ? If you give a clear response than I will admit that is my fault.
---
Right!?
---
It's so stupid. She has the lowest ein delta of all ops and still gets shit on because apparently no one wants to learn to play against her.
---
No way can ignore miss thickems with all that ass up in the air.
---
literal spray pattern
---
Why? You still wanna play to win and spawnpeeking is a valid gameplay method
---
Or even worse, more players expecting y o u to be sweaty xD i hate just goofing around with friends and people be like "yall suck" and we have to stop having fun to kick their ass cuz they wanna trash talk
---
Same thing happened to me in my early lvls, now im around 160 so nobody calls me a smurf anymore
---
Umm record that, share to one drive.  Install one drive on phone or PC.  Download the file then upload here.

listen. It's your ping. Their servers are there to maintain a stable SERVER connection. servers and game servers are different.

So you‚Äôre telling me, that a Jackal who is meant to hunt down roamers, tracking the same roamer throughout the match is bad. It forces him to stay in OBJ which is my problem. Especially when there is only one roamer and you cannot afford to have 2 roamers. 
---
So let‚Äôs talk about him being banned a lot in ranked. Your original argument was that he was too weak to be nerfed, but have you ever considered that his low win rate is due to pickrate? The nerf is meant to increase his win rate by lowering his pickrate. My point isn‚Äôt that he‚Äôs annoying and therefore should be nerfed, which I didn‚Äôt elaborate on very well, but rather that he can change a strategy by himself with no risk. That was Lion‚Äôs main problem and why he was nerfed. Lion didn‚Äôt have to risk anything to use his ability while Jackal has minimal risk, but that‚Äôs not enough.
---
I usually get all the windows in that front room to prevent a line of sight into site. Then I'll hold lobby stairs or that elevator corner or something. The two interior hallway windows are also good for funneling. There are honestly so many options on CEO that I have trouble figuring out a decent set up sometimes.

Clash is fantastic, extremely strong in the right hands, just like everyone else. Just takes a different mind set and tactics to play her, but god damn you can change a game with her

If you don't move, you can't leave footprints.

I remember one time it was a 2 v 5 in ranked and it was the first match. Within seconds of the game starting my teammate gets kill and before I could react, Ash comes running in and blasts my ass as I desperately try to shoot at her tiny hitbox. It was truly terrifying
---
Someone posted it

could work

so do you use C7? cause i've seen a lot of streamers like pengu using the smg

They even make sure to cover Nokk's face with the sticky note. Including putting the push pin almost directly over Denmark, and also the Top Secret file is in Latin for some reason. I can't make out much of what it says just that it's in Latin and I believe one word is volleyball...
---
What the other guy said. I‚Äôm not gonna play ranked with some people who have less than 200 hours into this game.
---
on floors to the immediate left or right of openings so it takes attackers longer to spot, scope in, and fire them, there fore giving you time to pop their skulls
---
Yeah, you place it on the barricade, obviously! /s
---
Are you actually a copper lmao? You dont have to run back to site like a bitch, learn how to waste time as a roamer, which is the entire point of roaming, and Thatcher can change a strategy with little to no risk, your points are invalid
---
You don't really need to get all the windows, regular barricades will do on the side ones as they're too small to be dangerous anyway. It's far more important that you get the doorway on the side.
---
I use the c7 almost exclusively cause its a beast in cqc. If im in the mood for long range engagments then i go for the pdw cause for some reason it has a faster ttk at a farther distance than closer
---
Thanks, I'll take a look
---
Isn‚Äôt Clash already a Riot Police?... since some of these elites have gotten more creative recently hear me out..... a RoboCop-esque Monty. How terrifying, turning a corner and Monty with red LED eyes is facing you with a huge metallic shield üòÇ and instead of the standard shield noise when walking, you hear the sounds of a robotic movement slowly creeping down the hallway
---
That‚Äôs noob stuff. I had 3 smurfs on Xbox that were all lvl 120ish

Asshole.

I mean that‚Äôs fine man I‚Äôm not insulting. Just the tone is off because I had to read it 4 times to understand that it was WAAAZZ UUUUP. . . No need to get offended.
---
And breaching charges
---
As a fuse semi-main, I would also like to thank castle. Means I can share my hockey skills without getting blasted through said window/door!
---
What needs to be nerfed?
---
Her initial set had claymores, they just changed them to stuns because of glitches. Wardens will get his deployable shield back instead of impacts for the same reason
---
This is the other team ddosing the game, not Ubisoft servers. But it does seriously need to be fixed
---
Someone already posted the same thing a while ago with warden and n√∏kk lol

Hahahaha. Oh.

Yeah that‚Äôs .... True.

Hippity Hoppity I will now proceed to harass women and minorities
---
So learn to counter spawn peeks, use drones to watch common peek spots in prep phase and dont just blindly rush towards the building, spawnpeeks are at a higher risk of getting shot than the attackers moving forward if the attackers at least use some common sense

I‚Äôm around 1.95, i feel to tall :[

Really? How do you know, and also how would you prevent DDOSers?

I really do feel like this is a Fortnite level skin.. Too bad. I would definitely buy a good smoke elite!
---
I feel her pistol is too op
---
IMMA TURN YOUR FEET INTO PASTA
---
Twitch.

Because this is exactly what it looks like when ddosing happens, and you can‚Äôt prevent ddosers. If they do it, you lose. Simple as that
---
No. But this is the internet and people will defend it anyways
---
It's a joke my dude
---
Makes sense
---
I run down to site TO STAY ALIVE. A man advantage can be everything. If I stay roaming against another Plat team, I will be hunted down and killed swiftly.

Also Thatcher? Bandit tricking.

M870 power

Happened to me twice on xbox today. Thinking it was DOS. This season is awful for this kind of shit.

Niceee, I have the Leder skin for her lmg, it's also pretty clean. Gsg9 has good weapon skins.

Hahaha this is a joke right?

It‚Äôs a marshmallow shooter..

Really wanted to buy the bundle didnt have enough money :(

How do u add more than 1

I just got in a match and a cav one tapped me when i had 70 health (not a headshot))
---
 Wtf that is so good
---
Ya her pistol does 80 damage
---
It would make sense the concept of nook is been around since they first created vigil
---
What color tho
---
The team kill reverse damage was implemented because I kept TK'ing castle players who castled OBJ. Fuck castle mains
---
Irl, that thing is a BEAST
---
Thank you!
---
Yep, had this shit twice today. So ridiculous.
---
Really?? I actually feel like thats way too much for a silenced pistol
---
especially reddit, nice to see someone who isnt a sperg
---
Wait what? Drones absolutely can keep you safe from spawn peeks, use them in prep phase to watch the common run out spots, I always put my drone at front door bank and my squad mate puts one at back ally door and we no longer get blindly spawnpeeked because we can tell its coming before it even happens, never did I say you need to stay on yoir drone after prep phase
---
And rushing headling towards the building is absolutely not how you avoid getting spawnpeeked, you push out of spawn while checking windows/doors for peeks and move up once you have checked its safe to do so
---
No offense but it doesnt sound like you know what you are talking about or dont play more than casual or at a higher level of competition
---
I‚Äôve got a wooden stock express model
---
Have you ever played Dead By Daylight? They should implement something similar to Ranked. In that game your more successful as a team but your also rewarded for individual performance. At the end of the round you can be given points for how well you did doing certain things such as objective time, kills, intel, rounds won and your rewarded more points if those are done with a teammate... and based off those points you rank up/down. 
---
That way, solo players aren‚Äôt punished for playing the right way, and their teammates decided to rush and die in the first 30 seconds. Also, smurf players aren‚Äôt just rewarded for getting most kills. So if your team loses, but you defended obj most the game, you spotted enemies, you reinforced, you have a chance to still rank up.
---
Actually if you‚Äôre up against Fuze, the castle armor panels are kind of backfiring. He can attach his cluster mine and you can‚Äôt even shoot through
---
But the thing is it can‚Äôt kill you it only downs even with a headshot so you have to time to get away or get revived
---
Yes.
---
I feel like I am the only person here that doesn't like black ices
---
Thank you
---
Moving to the WEU would help, but outside of that, no.
---
Thought so
---
I want it
---
But with a coordinated team she can do a lot more than just minimal damage.
---
They can play on your servers and you‚Äôll have good ping
---
Lol
---
Really? But why?
---
Play terrorist hunt to learn the maps
---
When attacking remember to use your drones if you're not certain whether an enemy is in a room or not
---
Watch the killcams and try learn from them
---
Combine Lion and Jackal

OP for Attack: Jackal/Lion before any nerfs

OP for Defense: Lesion/Kapkan

Useless for Attack: No one, every combo I can think of is OP as fuck

Useless for Defense: Rook/Doc but specifically that the armour has to be picked up and decays at the same speed as overheal.

It's been like this for about four years

Your SO lucky I'm level 416 and still haven't got ranked so I only get to play with bots üò≠üò≠

Montagne and caviera

It‚Äôs time Castle and Montaigne get a legendary outfit

Currently at level 69 and waiting to be able to install the game

You mean Rhodesia?
---
He is a simple character, with a simple gadget and good weapons. I know I won't keep people out indefinitely but I know it can slow them down. I have lost games and won games because of the barricades.
---
I never felt like I should pick a "better" operator since Skull Rain, I only wish he more cosmetic options lol
---
Buy it on one itll show up on the other
---
I'm the biggest castle main ,he is my lock screen on my phone , he is my most use opp and I think he is god. We love you god ,love superjewin
---
Aye now i do. Cheers.
---
Combine Montagne and Clash for the most OP shield operator
---
I've always loved castle but never him as my fave.
---
We have a love/hate relationship lmao
---
I play with a castle main
---
Welp indeed.
---
Congrats
---
Everything is free just play to get the ops
---
I can still see a lot of problems lol
---
Yea, and let doc stim walls to repair the holes attackers put in them. Clash in fine my guy, if anything she‚Äôs SUPER strong with the right team.
---
The best gun is he M1014
---
Ok thanks so much for your input ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
What sites/maps do you recommend playing him on? I play him on the office site on skyscraper when my other teammates don‚Äôt but either than that I‚Äôm not sure where I could fit him in
---
I mean it‚Äôs not hard just use finka lion and like dokk
---
I switch off between acog and holo a lot, and maybe you should try out the holo. Personally I feel like the Alda is a laser with it.

Hello Poarad, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cfrk2c/which_operator_should_i_buy/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
There are far better skins available than Black Ice, you're not alone. It's not a favourite of mine, but it does look better than some.
---
Most hype for it is because it's essentially "very rare to receive from Alpha Packs," so when it happens people get excited over having something "valuable" in a sense.
---
what would you say are the fundamental or most important things to learn to improve fast. Such as learn the map or learn/chose a certain character etc? whos best thats unlocked for a newbie to use?
---
You need to reinforce what you know will be useful to the attackers if breached. Making the objective a reinforced box is a common mistake for low ranked players, and especially when secure was a playlist. Don‚Äôt make a room a steel box that‚Äôs impossible to retake control once your one anchor is domed in the head trying to peek something unnecessarily.
---
People main ops? oof
---
I think he‚Äôs kidding especially about the BOSG.
---
It‚Äôs called perspective and yes it can be annoying to die like that but that‚Äôs how it would be in real life as well.
---
It isn't my #1 fav skin too, I always prefered the one-color skins (the universal ones)
---
I had that same glitch
---
Just get nomad arx is a monster and gadget is good
---
You = beta male
---
His gadget isn't useful often, but as a 3 armor with smokes you'll clutch often with him.
---
However for defense u should get mozzie
---
Good guns good gadget and has a c4
---
Ya, toxicity is getting really bad lately
---
which i find ok because not everyone is megan fox.
---
I said this with hibanna, so what if she looked like a man, some women look like men. Some people are just ugly. 
---
Its ok to be ugly, i‚Äôm not ugly, but some people can be. And that‚Äôs ok. Just some of us are ugly lol.
---
ok this is smart, my dumbass would never have thought about this
---
Something like 40 would be good.
---
I second this. They are extremely helpful in many areas.
---
This season on console has been horrible. From the very beginning people have been ddossing.
---
Yeah. Clubhouse defending basement, go up the stairs, set the turret up in front of the window on them. Tear down the window when the round starts, get on the turret, and fuck up anyone who dares to go tunnel while they can't do shit to you.
---
I used to be a Castle main before I got dlc because it though his shotgun was op for how fast it shoots and the damage but I was weird when I played him by roaming shooting at everything that moved.

One of those. Probably late August or mid September. We haven't gotten any leaks or anything like that so far
---
That looks sick
---
Im sorry Im American I cant understand you
---
He weighs  a lot and it‚Äôs all muscle
---
While my comment was a joke, frost is the highest win rate defender in the game.
---
Monty cant kill you from behind his shield, dosent  have a completely see through shield his teammates can strafe behind and peek from, has an abundance of counters that are plentiful on the defensive side, and dosent have a fucking automatic weapon. 
---
Monty is a balanced shield operator, Clash is the least balanced shield operator.
---
Okay thanks for the translation
---
i personally love playing against castle setups, just use the castles to your advantage, you know they won't come from there so it's a safe spot kind of

Hello ship_head, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/cfsh3h/ddosing_5_man_on_ps4_eu/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I thought so but it's still kind of funny.
---
Fix what dude? The guy's a plat 3 you have a gold 1 on ur team. Seems pretty close to me.
---
they do, the movement penalty is only for smoke vision
---
i used to be one. i've barley played him for like over a year and for some reason he's still my most used defender
---
*J√§ger no!*
---
no
---
Great to see my country being in Team Rainbow!
---
I love playing castle but every time I do I just get 4 roamers on my team whining about how I reinforced objective
---
Yes it will be 60 dollars full price 
---
It doesn't matter what engine it's using. It's still a new game and we don't know how much content will be in in yet but they have a new team working on it so I'm guessing a lot.
---
Anyhow I don't care about the cost of a game if we are talking 10-20 dollars difference it's really not much money
---
thanks! I hate it!
---
you can still hear reloads
---
level 300, noob! must be copper 4
---
JK, wish I was that high
---
They were smurphing - they bragged about being diamond at the beginning of the game. Que's should be based on the highest player's rank - not the team average
---
get used to a high sensitivity
---
I fucking like this. Like ACR Heartbeat Sensor
---
WOW
---
No. Blitz
---
Out of 45 million total players, do you really think that YOU are the only one running breach charges on Hibana?
---
Wonderful idea
---
This would ruin the game
---
B u l g e
---
The elite have all reference previous things the ops have done. Smoke was a troublemaker. This is a troublemaker Elite skin. What else would he have been? Plague doctors don‚Äôt exist anymore.
---
Same. Probably the most iconic operator
---
Imagine how balanced blitz would finally be
---
There is definitely a potential. Her utility aspect can be that she‚Äôs the best Anchor killer by giving more strength to her current stealth mechanic. 
---
There‚Äôs a character in League of Legends who is a Support but instead of supporting teams by bringing tankiness or healing/shields, he just straightout executes enemy who are below certain HP. He supports team by just straight-out killing certain enemies.
---
Nokk should have more advantages and reasons to pick her over the other Attackers. She is not a strong solo operator and really need something more for her to be justified. 
---
Even Warden, in his current terrible state, has more justifiable reasons and will be more justified once he gets little bit of adjustment. 
---
Despite the tiny buff Nokk received, there‚Äôs still no reason for her to be picked unfortunately.
---
This is fucking awful
---
Yea and lose all entertainment and joy for the game due to booters,cheaters and general assholes.
