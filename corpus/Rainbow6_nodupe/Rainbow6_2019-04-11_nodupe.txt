The amount of times I've restarted that game. EXPLOOOOOOOSIOOOOONS!!!
---
---
---
Doc because heal and acog
---
I'm very new to the game and quickly realized why people say if you don't have any friends who play it it's not worth buying
---
I can‚Äôt figure out how to set this as my background on an iPad or iPhone X.
---
Yeah but ash is more widely known for being more toxic lol
---
Who has better weapons
---
in the Tom Clancy Novels it is confirmed that operators do simulations, they even complain about head shot registration.
---
It isn't on any of the lists so we won't know until someone does it and reports back.
---
very good
---
And a few of them I was playing with friends like that ace for example was a full squad of friends
---
Haven't seen that one actually
---
yeah that happens. you don't have to force quit battleye, you just force quit the siege exe
---
Dang alright guess I'll play the waiting game then.
---
Be the guinea pig we need
---
White knight the status quo! That reddit karma ain't gonna farm itself!
---
If you use laser sights regularly you get used to positioning a little differently than without. You shouldn‚Äôt hold say a door frame, instead position your sight a touch to the side for example. Depending on playstyle, the extra hipfire accuracy is nice to have.
---
Stop giving them ideas, they need to fix the game first
---
I mean if you‚Äôre going for steath then Cav has a better weapon. However Doc has an ACOG and can self-heal which are both really helpful.
---
I bet this is the lithium AAA + tinfoil mod
---
Just come play with my squad
---
Doesn‚Äôt show up in TM :(
---
You cannot yet change your name on PSN, it's at 8PM EST, in 17 minutes. They have a current list of games that are in a critical state if you do change your name, R6 was not one of them.
---
Ok thanks
---
How do you reason
---
There's a list of games that you can permanently lose data on, I don't recall siege being on that list. It might sign you out when you first open the game after changing your GT but nothing more.
---
I tried telling that to people when I got a Mira helmet that was all black, and they tried to tell me that it was the best legendary they have ever seen.
---
R4C Black Ice looks amazing!
---
Just because your sights on his head doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs when you shot
---
I play on PC and this situation only happened to me once, since the game release. I don't have friends, but still have a nice time playing, so that statement isn't true. It is unfortunate that you had to face these braindead children, but it doesn't happen every match, does it?
---
You‚Äôre a shitter.
---
Do you see the sparks behind his head , that‚Äôs where my bullet landed
---
For all we know your shot just kicked up because of recoil
---
Wow .... lol
---
?
---
Challenge accepted.
---
Do you see where the bullet landed
---
In most cases,Doc,again,lul.
---
Caveira has one of the worst smgs. Doc is one of the only defenders who can not have only one acog,but two. Plus a really strong pump action shotgun but i gotta admit that Caveira shotgun is better due to the fire rate since it's a semi auto.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. If he was moving his head could‚Äôve moved in front of where the bullet landed. You need a video
---
I'm not making excuses? And hes not an actual copper, you should actually read what I'm saying instead of being dense.
---

---
Hey I Donno if you're aware of this little fact but there are multiple teams that work on different aspects of this game. Like an art team and a development team. The art team doesn't fix bugs and shit you moron!
---
I love it!
---
Im gonna try this
---
It‚Äôs a joke you fucking idiot
---
How to get it though is the question.
---
In all seriousness, you should be open to playing almost any operator.
---
You should put music over it
---
R6 wasn't tested apparently. It wasn't in any of their lists.
---
A week ago I opened a pack and got black ice for the Glaz's gun and I only had 6 minutes played on him and my friend was in the same call as me and he has 17 hrs on Glaz. Was my first black ice as well, kinda bummed I don't play him.
---
It wasn't a very good one then.
---
Why wouldn't he?

Ubi really fucked the rarity system in this game, so many commons that looks way too good for commons and so many legendaries that look like commons.
---
This has happened to me so many times. I say "give me last kill for the ace" and then they kill the last personüò™ F for our fallen brother

I mean. Either way. They don‚Äôt even fill the same roles in typical play.

Have a seat, child. Let me tell you a beautiful story.
---
So for going into terrorist hunt, I should probably turn off aim assist right?
---
My friend got this while in a call and just said ‚Äúoh cool I got legendary‚Äù.
---
I think he really missed the opportunity to say "feeling cute, might make a really big fucking hole later"
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers...
---
I think it is definitely a map based decision. You will have to find what works best for your team on various maps. I would say cav on larger maps and doc on smaller.
---
i hate that i have such bad aim with the damn secondary‚Äôs
---
You feel better?
---
I like the part where you look behind you to see if anyone saw you fvcking up that grenade you threw.
---
No it ain‚Äôt, it‚Äôs probably just a kill cam glitch. The quality looks worse than pc.
---
Source: I use console and this is what it looks like
---
Possible buff
---
Great pocket grenade glitch is back
---
Where is Doc‚Äôs helmet?
---
Seriously, I‚Äôd never go behind someone who just stops moving. Just prepare a headshot and if he‚Äôs faking drop my shield again
---
Had to make sure no one saw ;)
---
Ah I'm usually holding shift when I do this.
---
You can‚Äôt transfer stuff. May i ask why you are permabanned
---
Mad cause bad?
---
lolll the game is broken and unplayable even though it‚Äôs your trash aim and skill. that‚Äôs literally all on you. quit blaming the game for your lack of any skill
---
First season for you?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, at least we‚Äôll always have r/R6ProLeague
---
It fell off with the top of his head
---
Do you play with your head tilted ?
---
My favorite skin, I rock it over my Black Ice
---
Agreed, but gotta "balance" it by fucking up physics.
---
Even its starting to get scaryü§£
---
Ur a lil late to this
---
When his Gu mines get a kill.
---
Instead of "shooting them in the back," how 'bout your shoot them in the head.
---
No skill required. Yeah, okay, try being in a 1 v 5. Surrounded. It‚Äôs not easy. You need more skill than you think to be good with a shield op. You have to outsmart your enemy and have good timing, especially when your shield is up and they are standing right in front of you.
---
Blitz is so overpowered! Like seriously! He killed me with his melee while I was on camera and not listening to anything! How is this balanced! I bet he was a hacker too! /s
---
We get exclusives. We got two timed exclusive Exotics and an Armor set
---
What does he get out of it?

Okay this is just a fucking joke. Don't get mad at me because you like sucking the pro league's toes. I was high (still am) so don't downvote my shit you filthy toe suckers

Bro. You lucky bastard

That‚Äôs sick

---
Do you play with a group? It was like that for me when I first started playing because my elo was bloated from playing in a higher rank than I should have been and for a while it just felt like everything I did was a waste of time until I started to grind it out more and get a more accurate rank.
---
What is  this song?
---
Yes it is
---
r/terriblefacebookmemes
---
The archives are complete now
---
I have that wooden one too, and I love it. It's shouldn't be a legendary tho. I'd say an epic skin. But that's my opinion
---
It is what?
---
Idk. I usually play ranked a lot with friends so I never usually deal with toxic randoms. I recommend finding a group of people to play with. I think there‚Äôs a discord server dedicated for finding a group so I suggest starting there.
---
WHERE ARE THE ADIDAS PANTS
---
inb4 cOnSoLe AiM
---
Thanks for the suggestion, will check that out
---
How is this an ability? Just use that operator, and then you also get their ability. So instead of just getting Thatcher's gun and no ability, you could just choose Thatcher and get his gun AND ability.
---
I wish all legendaries looked like this
---
i like player like u
---
I'd love for it to be a universal skin. I love that wooden texture
---
I like players like you hah
---
Looks like an airsoft hi-capa
---
it does good damage, but unless you're a gunslinging cowboy a pistol won't get you kills. It's why ESL players who might use her use her AR. pistol lacks DPS. She's the worst without a mic, I have one but my team can't hear me. She's good in concept but bad in execution. Like communism.
---
Well like said, I've been on break from it and also, my aim wasn't even that bad. It was pretty alright. The only real issues would be with that Nomad when I sprayed the room which I only did to panic her.
---
it‚Äôs not even like they are merging him significantly or at all
---
well the title is past tense, not sure how you didn't put that together.
---
You just got outplayed honestly/s
---
HUGE THING: make sure when you hold an angle aim at the head not there knees. so many low level play will hold the angle but have their reticle at knee height.
---
Everyone
---
I don't think you understand what 'inb4' means.
---
It seems my final form is here
---
I don't like losing badly against players and casual isn't a good venue to try out new characters. It's still competitive.
---
In before, yes I do. I'm just making a point about it.
---
Im glad they added the TF2 hats in season 2. Only reason I get alpha packs anymore.

Why not just have it on a seperate launcher/build available like a test server perhaps?

I used an app called InShot, it took me like 1 1/2 hours on my phone for what I could in in adobe premiere in 15 minutes üòÇ
---
Desert Eagle Code Red
---
Oh same. Just having that classic wood furnish look on the guns look awesome. Some of them pull off the look super fucking well.
---
I know a lot of players like the cool crazy skins, but personally, I love the minimalistic skins the best.
---
It‚Äôs a beta skin, meaning you can‚Äôt get it unless you had the beta
---
Because you‚Äôre still doing friendly fire, doesn‚Äôt matter the intention
---
I thought the comment was funny :(
---
It‚Äôll just change your username
---
It said it was a dev skin
---
Legit bro stfu
---
Mozzie: *chuckles* you‚Äôre in danger
---
I opened like 4 packs today and got all commons... F
---
I feel this operator should focus more on flank routes (hatches,etc)  rather than actually defending the obj. Now yes,that means 2 less reinforcements for the obj room,but that flank mixed with a good player can change the course of the game easily. Oh and thanks for actually developing on this idea :)
---
* laughs in game engine *
---
It's simple. You can TK two people as long as it's not the same person. I do this kind of thing all the time. Example: Your friend are named "A" and "B" but the other two that are team killing are named "Y" and "Z." If Z kills A, Z can kill B still.
---
Idk kinda wish mute had acog his smg feels like a marshmallow gun and basically requires headshots if u wanna stand a chance so i feel like an acog isnt the worst idea tbh
---
A flanking character, so maybe for a gadget it would have impact nades and would be a three speed.
---
No way, I can't believe I want a battle scarred recruit elite skin, like one where it looks like that he's suffered countless harships through so many lives. wtf
---
This sounds offensive in Russian lang
---
Devil may cry or iron man?
---
Suitcase Iron Man Mark 5 suit
---
Raid Leader? That is pretty much the only thing I really want from the packs. If I could pay money for it I would.
---
No, I play PS4. Sorry.
---
rip
---
But what about guns that already use subsonic rounds like pistols and smgs? A suppressed pistol should do just as much damage as a regular one. Ubisoft even added the mp5sd without damage reduction.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm really stuck here. Maybe the counter can come in the same dlc pack thingy as this operator. Won‚Äôt really be Pay to win,would it? And I don‚Äôt know how it could work,but Maverick can play a part in the countering of the walls. And I like the idea of using multiple breach charges for the walls. And maybe the walls can‚Äôt be affected by Kaid Stick or Bandit Traps
---
"Remote control pikachu zapped me to death" probably this best thing I've ever read or will ever read.
---
Realistic
---
Bro just wait till next round
---
Yeah that‚Äôs mostly the path I‚Äôm going down. She should be a caveira type character. That would fit best
---
xd
---
I know people who play the game. It all works out. You'll have to send me that series.
---
Dude I can respawn irl right
---
You have my upvote :)
---
I got monty shield, smoke body, kapkan/Chanka rainbow camp, and then Monty helmet.
---
This is exactly how he's meant to be played along with his support role. He's currently invulnerable when deshielding+meleeing, and his ADS time is ridiculous, so as far as things go he's a really powerful fragger right now.
---
Andddd common
---
He should have just aimed for the head. /s
---
Maybe that's a good counter? No Mira, no Kaid or Bandit traps. I like where you're going with this.
---
You should get more packs under the percentage of 3% mad lucky
---
Neither to both.
---
As long as the "lord" remains , no.
---
No his main is fuze
---
in a word: ‚ÄúDisguisting‚Äù

---
I mean you did. In slow mo you can see. The gun doesn‚Äôt have Ela‚Äôs firerate.
---
is it possible to learn this power?
---
Thank you for finding something that‚Äôs already been found seven times.
---
well i see my teammates all the time getting killed because they just aim at a doorframe and the enemy can easyli see them that way. so i think its more of a pain then a gain...
---
maybe if they would play it right it would be okay. but most of the time they just die.
---
The best legendary skin.
---
Getting rid of one shot headshots without reworking how health and armor works would be the ultimate shitstorm, this game would just play like Battlefield with no exteriors or vehicles. That said, guaranteed headshots are the ultimate balancing copout in form of a force equalizer and are a driving force behind all weapons just being DPS fire hoses.
---
Think about it for a moment when was the last time you used or saw anyone use the fire selector? You may as well omit it.
---
They exist because people like the idea of "I shot him in the head he should die" even though that means jack shit when you think about it for more than a second and it decreases the workload of the balancing team, not because it's a superior system.
---
to add to this, skilled players say he is broken as in really quick ads time with such a big shield, can spam q e (kind of fixed now?) and a really fast melee animation
---
my teammates get killed all the time because of the laser because they aim at a doorframe and the enemy can see them... 
---
maybe if they would play it right... but most of the time they just get killed
---
I agree. What's weird is that it's on a high level, like plat 1s and diamonds.  Also I'm on xbox and ps4
---
Meanwhile all my pistols look like waterguns lol
---
Congratulations, you played yourself
---
Fuck Pingu and what he thinks!
---
This looks really well done. Props dude! Looks good
---
Kind of disappointing that all Alibi headgears/uniforms are basically realism while Maestro at least gets different hats
---
That was on low bronze actually.. Im on my way back to gold now. On second account I got gold 2. Thanks, I appreciate it !
---
&gt;kill you in one hit by lovetapping your chest (which doesn't make any sense)
---
Shields already have a melee drawback of their animation taking a much longer time and exposing themselves while doing it.
---
&gt;going to panic
---
&gt;asking for a lot of communication for new/solo queue players
---
-New players also won't know how to use shield operators to a better potential.
---
-Every game has a learning curve, you figure out how to get around situations such as a pushing Monty, and gradually learn how to better use ops.
---
-Solo players are automatically putting themselves at a disadvantage in a team-based strategic shooter, but even then they could just say "Monty on me" or the Monty's location.
---
I'm not writing off the opponents in this video, I'm pointing out other things they could've done to kill OP, and shield operators in general.
---
Castle is only good when u're in a squad, who plays by strats and knows ur gadget placements. His gun, like Pulse's, is one of the easiest to control in the game. But Castle can easily become bad pick when gadget placements are not well-thought out and blocks important rotations and flank routes.
---
In the event, it works cuz most ppl playing are low level players. Experienced players, considering they cant destroy ur castles other than meleeing it, will drone u out and will just take another entry or have someone flank u from behind.

1 thing that always work for me, I ignore them. I act as if nothing is happening. I dont even look at them or give any reaction. If i get tked, i leave it be. Eventually they stop. Sometimes, i get sneaky and bait them to killing me a 2nd time to get them kicked.
---
Never ever TK the toxic players. U'll regret it when u get urself banned.

P.s. Im not from US/EU. So i rarely experience this kind of toxicity.

I want mozzie more because his gadget seems really fun to mess around with. Gridlock just seems less useful imo.

I'm on mobile app. Don't have search option. Please do not spam off topic.
---
I see this in every game i play with skins, just something in polished red is always the best, also most expensive. Rarely its gold, sometimes its pink for reasons, but every red skin is so sexy for almost everybody. And youre right legendary skins in siege sucks, this is really a jewel.
---
It‚Äôs a copypasta.
---
Yeah but on a less useful pistol, looks cool just like my black ices on Bucks dmr and thatchers ar33. I use them very rarely...

Maybe you want to test the gun of a operator you dont have but want to buy. An operators guns can be a game changer.

I would like to see Ela's first buff because she's fucking useless compared to every other roamer. I main for fucksake and even I know she stucks. I would also like to see the sound and audio of the game get fixed because at least on playstation it's been broken for a while making you not hear anyone jump or vault out windows and you can hear people across the map but not right next to you . But just actual fixes that benefit the entire community would be nice instead of just the shitty pro league.

u can change your psn id no problems with siege
---
Nice game dude. Once in a while having something like that was fun!
---
I got the kill right after he died lol
---
fuckin 'ace. not even mad that I was shot at the end hahah. never had a casual experience like this
---
I can confirm that your sensitivity only changes by a "very minor" amount when you change your AR and you keep tired FOV. So minor, that you'll never notice. You "feeling" a difference is just placebo effect. Check it yourself: your 360 distance will be the same.
---
So OP is right. It won't change.
---
üòÇthanks for looking out for me man but this is my Reddit account

What about the sas

1, my computer's trash if I was able to run siege anymore I wouldn't be able to stop drones without an auto-shotty, also that shits funny as fuck

Just toss down 2-3 Alibis at OBJ then go roaming.

I got a shotgun skin that looks like it was left outside for centuries.
---
He‚Äôs an absolute asshole. There‚Äôs just messing around, then there is teamkilling 200 people, being toxic, and mocking a disability.
---
just don't ever post that as a suggestion to Ubi, if they see this raw power they'll nerf poor Smoke for sure
---
Only when the interweb stops, ddos is life, ddos means you are worthy
---
The killing itself isn‚Äôt the funny part. It‚Äôs the various thinks he says and starts discussions of. I promise you that if you don‚Äôt like the teamkilling videos you will laugh your ass off at his nascar videos. He trolls rednecks so hard I die of laughter every time.
---
Probably because that's the only site they have a slight grasp of how to defend, and the other ones would just end up in a death match. (which apparently isn't the way to go either because, i bet, they lost their fights.)
---
Besides, you're playing bronze. You're supposed to be among the worst players on the ladder. (and you should be able to hard carry yourself out of there if you truly don't belong in bronze TBH, but that's a different matter).
---
Just expect nothing from your team, and even less (as in actively trolling/deranking) the lower you go down the ranked ladder. Hell all the way up to platinum you run into people that have the mental capacity of a goldfish and solely got there on aim.
---
Honestly, though if they had aim assist in pvp like they have for pve, it‚Äôll be some weird shit lmao
---
Have you seen the outbreak skins. They‚Äôre very similar to this and look amazing. I have one on Lions Vector and it‚Äôs so cool
---
But hey that‚Äôs just a theory, a game theory
---
Oh well fuck you
---
I watched his Nascar videos. Verbal Trolling isn‚Äôt okay in my book either, but others could just mute them. They are funny, I agree.
---
just something not like ‚ÄúOG‚Äù or serious in any way. aka, MrEliteGamer.
---
Just a btw i do not speak with mic or anything else if you were wondering
---
It would be cool if it gives you a legendary item not a common duplicate. Also once you see CATE in duplicate you cant pronounci it the right way again
---
No, that is definitely new. Also, the luck of them getting into a game against their friends is pretty astounding.
---
alibi and cav are thicc but rook is thicker as so as tachanka

Yesterday someone team killed me for "being black" even though I'm not black
---
Oh alright thanks.
---
I want a more funny name I don‚Äôt want a serious one lol

That‚Äôs fair

yeah thats the point lol.

that's alright, I'm sure we'll still be fine and able to navigate our way through the matches xD

Looks amazing m8. But Twitch looks alot like Spy from TF2, lol.

Mira is complex and this guy sounds decently new to the game. Rook and Doc are easy and essentially always useful, especially rook. And all objectives are different. Some objectives we have 4 anchors and sometimes only 1. Deep roaming sometimes works but it‚Äôs not the best strat, especially at higher ranks.
---
I'm not sure they were friends I think they were just throwing the game and was in their party to give callouts
---
Not all gamers, thats like saying all muslims are terrorists (which is obviously false)
---
Btw although I'm a high level i usually just joke around or am using maverick for my teammates or even to destroy a reinforced wall for teammates (don't ask bc i honestly don't know how i just have seen a yt do it and can now do it myself)
---
Because your in a group with others, the game pairs you up with other groups. It tries to find players around your rank who are also in groups, but that group also happens to have the odd one out. More times then not when you see this, it‚Äôs boosting
---
Fine. How about her glasses are tuned to block out a specific frequency that only her flashes work on.

bruh i did not realize till i looked harder i was about to ask how you got it to work

bRUh wHAt Is THAt rANK?

I‚Äôve adjusted and changed both Monty and Twitch‚Äôs face since uploading this. I‚Äôll upload the finished Spetsnaz and GIGN some time Friday most likely.

i would love for it's epi to see this

Hereford rework

Fam how much for that account? 1000 v-bucks 2 common alpha packs? Uh apex coins? Or would you like one Krusty krab burger?
---
Man i was excited when we got the news that ranked would = pro league map pool, just to be knocked down again when every single time they come up with a new shit, broken map it ends up in the ranked pool and not in pro league. (and blame it on confirmation bias, i SWEAR the new map would appear twice as often as the actually balanced maps).
---
I'm not saying we're all pro league material, and imbalances come out a bit magnified when you see the best of the best exploit the strengths and weaknesses of a map. But damn if Ubi isn't confident on a map being balanced enough for pro league, then wtf is their reasoning behind putting it in the ranked pool?
---
Mozzie is so fun
---
god stuff man tbh i have not gotten a ace in like a month
---
You should pick up Thatcher. The EMP is essential to helping the hard breach, getting rid of Kapkans and Mute jammers, so you can still drone everyone out.
---
Its safe. Delete thread please, there are already 5 million like it, use the search function or ps4‚Äôs website.
---
At least you managed to put a round on the board
---
I do not know what that is, could you explain
---
What have you done to Twitch and Monty
---
I recommend a support operator, like finka or lion. Their weapons are also good (not perfect, but good).
---
nope, just a guy who likes a little fun! what's your platform?

Position on the leaderboard means fuck all and you gain/lose less elo over time because of playing more matches. This is why you gain/lose 80-110 in your first few matches after placements but you might only gain 30 near the end of the season depending on how much ranked you played during the season

Ive read that apparently games in beta can be updated at anytime without having to go thru the higher ups at microsoft and Sony. A game out of beta has to have their updates tested and tried before a roll out which slows down update time.
---
Use the M870 on GSG 9. That thing is godly
---
I mean, I get the core of the argument that body shot damage is reduced when it's done through a wall, but I think the core mechanic was based on realism. I don't care if you reduce bullet damage, a shot to the head is a shot to the head. 
---
My biggest thing is just that the truly random head shots just don't happen that often. Yes, once in a blue moon you'll die from a random wall spray, but most of the time, especially at high level, people drone and use intel. The aim part in the end, sure, is random and often lucky, but it's based entirely on their ability to drone out and opponent and establish a base of information and push to apply pressure. 
---
We did this yesterday, pinching on border. Someone was playing office against a soft wall, and my teammate was going to push through 90. We knew where we was roughly and after a quick drone I fired through the wall to apply pressure and my roommate pushed in to get the kill. I could have been lucky and landed a headshot, but the entire strat was not at all random.
---
Because realism thats why
---

Thanks for the advice, I really couldn‚Äôt decide between that and the Saiga at first.
---
No I haven't been following patch notes so thank you for that information. I'm excited about the forgive option tho that gives hope.
---
No why would I ?
---
Seems good, but can't you shoot the hard breach utility through the window when it's opened? Also, castle would get an indirect nerf from adding this op, something he definitely doesn't need.
---
I‚Äôm not really starting lol, I‚Äôve been studying and practicing for a while (I‚Äôm in college for concept art). I just have some trouble with proportions sometimes., but I just need to practice more. Things end up too long or too short occasionally. 
---
I admit it‚Äôs kind of a rookie mistake though. But that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing these. To hopefully improve and make them better as I go along.
---
Cheers. How effective is the breach charge compared to just yeeting a grenade or pumping a few rounds through a barricade?
---
Save 5% on Bfuel by entering the code "Suicide"
---
Well if they destroyed the Mira strat, if it's in ranked it was probably an accident. Teamkilling them for it is not going to help you, it will just hurt your chances of winning even more. If it's casual and you teamkill them for fucking up your Mira strat, move on. It's casual. You're not supposed to give a fuck in casual. If they have messed with your Mira strat several times, you should just play a different operator.
---
And the the thing on top is a draining grate
---
Why oh why do you casual dumbasses want to take out the one shot headshot mechanic? I hate all of you.
---
Why tf am I getting downvoted....

I wish I understood how to shade with pens

If a wall is not reinforced by the defending team, you can breach through it with the charge. Thus creating a larger hole that you can walk through.

It‚Äôs a pencil actually. A basic mechanical pencil with blue lead.

wow those legendaries really arent improving lmao
---
even if it isn‚Äôt terrible, a majority of player wouldn‚Äôt want it. I play with atleast 10 other players that wouldn‚Äôt want it, along with the majority of this subreddit
---
As a gameplay mechanic? No. I wouldn‚Äôt be completely opposed to an operator like rook that can give out bulletproof helmets for an extra headshot though. Granted they should remove a bit of visibility as a cost for the protection.
---
4 years into the game, why change a mechanic that makes Siege the great game that it is?

no he was sprinting with the shield to his side

Im canadian, but i dont even own the game physically, i own it digitally on pc and console. I'll ask some people i know to check it out

Just worried since sony sent out a disclaimer that it could ruin data in some games
---
Just worried since there was a list of games that it would corrupt data on

ya at least something. it seemed overkill to reduce the mag size, increase recoil, reduce dps, take away impacts, and lose a grzmot. but i see where they were coming from.... just wish they didnt do my fav like that

Why can‚Äôt we just remove the feature for new players to join halfway through Casual games? Because in Casual, there isn‚Äôt enough incentive for people to join back, so at least 90% of the time, nobody will come back.

Finally a fucking theme park rework I can not wait
---
170 i think
---
Hopefully all the new maps going forward are PL ready. We‚Äôre in year 4 of this game and if they haven‚Äôt figured out what makes maps work by now that would be a shame. Outback seems to have been met with overwhelmingly positive reception so that appears to be a step in the right direction. I‚Äôd like to see it added to the PL rotation going forward to see how they play it
---
then don‚Äôt sit still, don‚Äôt sit where you can get wallbanged, and make sure to crouch walk. i play high gold/low plat and rarely get wall banged, higher up (even high silver low gold) people will start to wall bang common spots for people to sit just to see if they can get an easy kill.
---
I saw that too and was really confused
---
Didn't there used to be a system where no one would get back-filled into a match point game? If not, then I must've had some shit luck prior to Y3S4.
---
Doki and kapkan. I always have the most fun with those.
---
Mike thyson
---
how long have you been playing I've been playing for 4 months now and I don't know if I should have an ace already
---
This captures the entire situation perfectly
---
Setting good Frost traps is a matter of prediction. Don't just put them all in the objective room, they'll get spotted and destroyed every time.
---
Think about barricaded windows that the attackers are likely to use for entry, those are prime spots. The further away from the site, the less likely attackers will be checking for a Frost mat. You'll ensnare many Ash and Blitz mains this way. Think about objects that attackers might have to vault over, put a mat on the other side. Get creative.
---
Operation Health worked great IMO
---
"Hello reddit" spans all cultures, lol

I heard that each season is going to have event like Rainbow is Magic ir something else

I've played on and off for the past 10 months and have only recently gotten super into it (Been playing daily for about 3 weeks) and am Level 84. Just have fun and at some point you'll do something cool.
---
I was luckily in a party with a friend and didn't get kicked lol
---
I‚Äôm no expert but I feel like there‚Äôs just a lot going on here in color and in the actual ‚Äústuff‚Äù.  My suggestion would be to consider making it simpler and sticking to 2-3 colors. Perhaps use the shield as the background and overlay the Lesion icon and your name on top of it.
---
bruh no self promo in here go to the discord

20% reduction in pick rate for ash is mad, never expected that in a million years.

blitz nerf is almost negligible imo

What‚Äôs with console players and voting to kick the person trying to clutch?
---

---
&gt;In order to make Ying‚Äôs Candelas more intuitive and simple, we have inverted the cooking mechanic.

This seems super smart to me.  It‚Äôs a slight nerf for sure but I think it‚Äôll make her a little less annoying to play against.  No more spamming candelas at defenders.

&gt; ASH
---
&gt;The removal of Ash's ACOG removal with Burnt Horizon was an attempt to reduce her pick rate. We removed a popular attachment that was unnecessary to her role as an opener. Following an impressive drop of 20% in her pick rate, she remains a very popular attacker and *her win ratio has even improved.*
---
They tried to nerf her but only made her more powerful than ever
---
That is some awesome drawing
---
Yay
---
Finally we get a Maestro nerf, thankfully more attackers can deal with his Evil eyes now.
---
Rip Nomading into Claymores :(
---
A E S T H E T I C

RIP Maestro
---
I don‚Äôt think the maestro change was necessary, but otherwise very good changes all around.
---
But it‚Äôs fine in my opinion not having an operator amazing on every site. I think the difference is that you can get use out of them on most sites, eventhough it may not be the best
---
terrorist hunt is a game mode for making renown just like the normal game modes, if you got to remove everything except the terrorists themselves what is the point?
---
Ikr? Still has two of the better primaries in the game, and a very straightforward and useful ability --PLUS smokes for those "time to plant" scenarios.
---
So confused as to why he's not more popular...

No problems with it. Changed mine earlier. It's also on the list for games not affected.

If they're gonna change Blitz's recharge time, they need to once again look at the range for his gadget. Half the time, I'm flashing twice because the first one was just out of range and did nothing to the vision of the op and it's still quite hard to tell if the op is full-flashed or just sorta-flashed. This timing change forces you to try and get closer to guarantee that you flash the defender, but in that case, you're \*probably\* already close enough to melee/get meleed so why even bother to try and use the flash other than to "guarantee" the kill (although, that's still a 50/50 with how many times bullets go through shields nowadays/lucky shots, etc.). Not the greatest change, IMO. His speed is probably the best way to balance him - once he's in your face, he deserves to get the kill considering he's supposed to be a close-range op. So, make it harder for him to get up close if you want to balance him (i.e. 1-speed him again, the shield-up sprint was good enough to allow him to get up close without the speed change) instead of nerfing his close-range tools. He's already loud, if you make him slower then it gives people enough time to either shoot him in the legs (if he's careless and tries to rush a hallway, for instance), or set up a crossfire with a teammate.
---
Okay. Let me rephrase the question. 
---
Why can my Operator pull out the magazine, but then mid reload animation ram it right back in by aiming down the sights and firing immediately again, instead of being stuck in an animation like every other game?
---
Like, in CS:GO, if you reload in a dumb position, you're going to face the consequences.
---

Tysm ima change mine now

I am always self conscious when shooting drones because I shoot an entire clip and miss one and it drives off. I then stop in my tracks looking in the bottom right corner waiting for the enemy team to roast me for my shitty aim.
---
MAEEEEEEEEESSSSSSTROOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Please God don‚Äôt do that to my boy blitz you‚Äôre gonna send him back to year 2
---
They only use the G36 since the removal of the ACOG.  It was worse in almost every way.
---
Speaking as a Thatcher/Maestro main, this change eviscerates Maestro and emboldens Thatcher quite a bit. I'll absolutely be taking advantage of this as Thatcher.
---
My god that body went flyinf
---
Currently the turret is completely disabled when hit by a shock drone - assuming that stays the same it'll be ridiculously easy to eliminate the turrets with the drone. First shot disables and opens, second shot destroys.

I wonder what happen to him, didnt get nerf or anything.

Frost's win rate is probably the result of people playing too aggressively and not watching their surroundings
---
They're likely adding a bunch of UI elements to it, but my main worry is the inevitable ELO loss due to cheaters, lag switchers, obscene glitches that can crop up (Valk' cam Bank glitch, shield glitch), Mouse and Keyboard users on Consoles, etc.

***Breach of Rule #9***, namely:

###No Image Macros
---
Image macros, also commonly referred to as memes, and Siege assets simply overlaid on other media are not allowed.
---
Image macros include simple image edits like superimposing text or other imagery as well as applying filters.
---
* This also includes video macros.
---
* Custom created artwork or more extensive video edits are generally allowed.
---
* If an image macro or a meme starts to saturate the front page, we may start to apply this rule.
---
That Frost win delta though. Actually she's somehow my highest winrate defender as well, it's really weird.
---
Ah yeah we did that a couple seasons ago.
---
If they're going to make Maestro's Evil Eyes destructible after being stunned by Twitch or Thatcher, they need to reduce the stun time to something like 3-5 seconds. Right now it's 10 seconds and that's way too long if it's also vulnerable to destruction during that time.
---
Launch.
---
LoL yup! Exactly what I said/thought.
---
Gutted, I remember this season my final placement match was fortress, it was 3-4 and my gane crashed, re-connected on 4-4 but we lost the last round.

---
yeah, used to be annoying when you got hit with an EMP or Shock Charge, but how is your evil eye supposed to be effective after this patch? At least punishing unaware players is nigh impossible now.
---
You do know it requires more than one shot to destroy them, right?
---
How do you remove someone else's post
---
Why are we arguing about reality in a video game where Fuze's cluster charge, Habana's X-Kairos, Echo's drone, etc. all exist? Who cares. Ubi probly made it so that reloading wasn't an instant death sentence because you can't be aware of everything before reloading.
---
I was thinking of a school map but then a bunch of stuff happened and now I'll be considered a threat
---
I really don't like Ubi's reasoning on a lot of changes. For example, with Nomad, they reason:
---
&gt;Thanks to her Airjabs, Nomad already had three gadgets designed to counter flanking by the defending team. That is why we decided to give her stun grenades instead.

That's not a useful answer to 'why'. Is 4 too many gadgets to counter flanking for attacks? Why or why not? Is 4 too many gadgets to counter flanking for Nomad specifically? Is she too powerful with a claymore? Kapkan has 5 traps. Why is that the amount he has? Can't we reason that he 'already has 5, therefore he should have 4' with this line of reasoning?
---
So then he already has an acog....
---
All told that's six operators who can destroy the turret right now - it's already pretty common for me to lose turrets so I don't see why this is necessary. Even with her reduced pick rate Ash is still blowing up my turrets all the time and there's the other options too. Maestro already has plenty of counters;.
---
Don't always have to lean to clutch üòÇ
---
He does but on the shotgun which makes not sense on not putting it on the aug
---
Well if that's the case then git  gud right lol rite?
---
But not really though. If you reload in a dumb place you SHOULD be punished for it. 
---
But I guess that's just stupid isn't it?
---
No
---
She doesn't destroy them. She disables them and makes them able to be destroyed by any operator. Just like Thatcher will do.
---
Seems like a good balance change to me. The evil eyes were pretty OP in thier previous state.
---
I see ashs not often but def picking up the g3
---
where can i buy?

i‚Äôd honestly love to see something that effects you after you get shot like depending on what body part you got shot in it effects you in some way.
---
They should hit the delete key ;)
---
It's about time. They've said before they won't want Ops with Top Tier Weapons and Gadgets, so I'd like to see where this lands him.
---
Peekers advantage was not and cannot be addressed in any way. Its based on fundamental principles of reality like propagation of information.
---
Anyone having a problem with queue time on ranked and casual recently? I got to 10 mins on both
---
*cough* re-que *cough*
---
Existed since launch
---
Possibly... but if that‚Äôs the case, what‚Äôs the problem with this picture?
---
Usernames check out
---
His AUG A3 PARA is getting bugged by +6 damage points with the next update, but also his Shotgun‚Äôs losing 10 slug rounds of extra ammunition with the next update, so, his guns are ok, his shotgun‚Äôs not amazing on console (but if you use it, equip suppressor and ACOG) and his AUG A3 PARA is just dogshit, but has no recoil, so go for that Angled Grip, but I‚Äôll def play as him more in Season 2 when his gun gets hat fat buff it needs lol
---
Simple all the maps, but you can choose?
---
Your points are valid but the way you keep saying ‚Äúmy‚Äù and ‚Äúmy baby‚Äù before those female ops is fucking weird
---
Dude me and my friends are having the same problem
---
these are all really good changes, I might be biased because I want Blitz nerfed into the ground, but everything is pretty solid can‚Äôt wait for it to go live
---
Sick! love Twitch, my main fo sho!
---
So pay the same price for no characters only cosmetics.... not interested
---
Mixtures of both. Play casual &amp; you get any casual player which consists of earrape mics or teamkilling. Ranked is a little more serious &amp; the higher the rank the more serious the players. Sometimes..   just get a squad bro it'll be better tbh.
---
Just tell them what mozzie does and to not do that. Works better and now they know
---
Like you said, I don't think they can conceivably do anything else to her. What's left to nerf?
---
She's a 2/2 support op with a good gadget (used to be too good, I admit) and the best gun in the game. There's nothing wrong with any of that. Someone has to have the best gun. There will always be a "best" gun.
---
I don't think it makes sense to remove her acog, given what her role on a team is, but I think that's what they're going to do because of this balancing system that's largely driven by pick rates and a need to have every op's rate cluster together in a very small sub-set of ranked play.
---
:(
---
closing the gap is the skill required, and you are rewarded with the (nearly) free kill at the end of it if you do close the gap. Sprinting with the shield up removes most of the skill required to get closer
---
Yeap
---
mmmm the vertical play possibilities
---
Who‚Äôs the artist
---
Because "Wahhh her swap is too fast I cant take her head on" about a character designed to win a head on *clash*
---
OMG just change BLITZ to 3 Armor 1 Speed   
---
HOW HARD IS THAT ?
---
situational is what shields should be, and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre giving enough credit to Fuze  PMM shield, it can be incredible.
---

---
This is from the Designer Notes today, Y4S1.3
---
Maestro
---
To reduce the effectiveness of his Evil eyes, its bulletproof windows will now be half-way opened when affected EMPs or Shock Drones.
---
By allowing Thatcher or Twitch to have an effect on Evil Eyes, we want teams to rely a little less on soft destruction operators. Maestro mains will also have to be slightly more cautious when placing their gadgets.
---
I will try
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
I am calm lol. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense that they did that.
---
on ps4 in casual about half the matches involve TKing, if you're lucky its the enemy team if you're unlucky it's you and no they do not need a reason.
---
yep, but you‚Äôre more exposed and it‚Äôs less potent than she is now. She‚Äôll still be an incredibly strong operator, this isn‚Äôt a huge nerf but it‚Äôs not negligible
---
It's 50 50. In casual you run the risk of tryhards or people fucking about. If you play ranked (unlocked at lvl 20) you'll typically match with players trying to win. Best to use a mic to communicate and try to learn call outs as quickly as you can. 
---
Use your drone phases to learn the maps layouts and what each room is called, as it should say it on the bottom of the HUD. 
---
Overall it's a great game, you'll soon learn the common frustrations and I'd recommend teaming up with your friends to avoid the above-mentioned fuckery. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you may have.
---
You can play in the official discord server, find some people that can teach you different things.
---
Suppressor: No smoke trials, No threat indicator, -15% damage
---
Flash Hider: -37.5% First shot recoil, -30% centering time, 5% smaller diamond
---
Compensator: 17.75% smaller diamond
---
Flash Hider: -45% First shot recoil, -45% centering time
---
Long Barrel: +15-20% Long Damage Range
---
Twitch can already destroy them when they are open so pretty much confirmed until the patch hits live.
---
Twitch's drone are always high priority to hunt down though and with Y4S1 her drone's now have lights on them as well so they can't hide anywhere near as well now. I think more than anything this is just going to make people keep the turrets closer in or around the sites.
---
you just need 1 flash ... 1 flash .... 1
---
Proceed to waste four mags on those little fuckers
---
ahh yes, year 2 Blitz was the most balanced one
---
It's when he's making out with another operator. They added PDA in the next update, which I'm very excited about.
---
it happens in every game and most of them are stubborn...
---
1. Going off the trailers is a big no no, It doesn't play anything like the trailers.
---
2. Yes a lot of  "gosh darn youtube commentating leafy wanna be stock photo using bad joke  telling whiny "is updated with the current events" rapid growth youtube  on the planet" play this game. So do other other non youtubers.
---
3. "want to have fun by very lightly role-playing as operators? Or am I gonna get told to "shut up kid" I can 100% confirm that if you try to "roleplay" your operator you will be made fun of.
---
4. The game is serious if you wanna play ranked. But casual mode  is a wild wild west. You will be called names and you will have people screaming the mic etc etc. Some times you will make friends and it all really depends on your attitude.
---
How is it any different from single shock drone being able to take out both of Mira's windows or all of Mute's jammers or all of Bandit's batteries or all of Jaeger's ADS'? A lot of operators gadgets can be rendered useless in the prep phase by a single twitch drone.
---
I agree, or another option could be reverting the pistol back to how it was before it got nerfed. maybe it'd make it too powerful on PC, but on console it's dookie compared to how it was when it first came out. you can barely string two shots together unless you wait half a second between them
---
Tfw it's gonna be easier for capitao to burn her
---
I was (and still am a bit) expecting that to be my most downvoted comment ever. Instead, was my first silvered comment, a nice turn of events some might say. Thanks a bunch!
---
Here's to making the community a better place.
---
It's crazy how many people are born on January 1st
---
W O W
---
im tryna stack as a 2 in EUW and we arnt getting into a game
---
The witch doctor one would actually be such a sick elite skin for the man, I'd hand my money over in an instant
---
I really enjoy the seasonal operator statistic displays showing win rate vs pick rate. However, it's very disingenuous to present that graph and then post balance changes beneath as if those two things are correlated. If they are, that's an extremely dangerous practice, and will almost always drive you in wrong directions. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
First, we can look [here](https://i.imgur.com/gLd3svG.png) to see Lion's pick rate and win rate is in the "Under picked and Too Weak" category. This is on the cusp of the new Lion change coming over the horizon, much to the delight of the community. However, these statistics are from Ranked - PC - Platinum and Diamond; there is no pick &amp; ban, so why would one of the most broken and overbearing operators in competitive Siege, one that required a quarantine due to how omnipresent he was, not be overwhelmingly played in ranked? It's due to a variable: Community Culture. 
---
Just because the community does not pick Lion does not change what his gadget can do, or how strong he can be. Almost anyone who busts him out in ranked will be labeled a try hard, and given that big-bulli. This aversion to playing Lion is erroneously causing Lion's ranked statistics to drop, significantly.
---
Second, let's take a look at another variable: Map pool. The ranked map pool consists of all the ESL maps, plus a few scattered other ones. While this is currently an avid topic on twitter to change this map pool, I'm over here arguing that this data is irresponsibly lumping all maps in Ranked into a balance decision, regardless of their fairness towards operators. Fuze going on Hereford is overwhelmingly under powered, as most of the vertical or window play that his gadget relies on is missing. Maverick is shown to be under picked, however if there was a Club House only map pool, he'd be at a near 80% pick rate just due to how useful his pre-defined meta is. Kapkan's traps are at a massive disadvantage on Coastline and Fortress due to the design of hallways and doors, but on Consulate, he shines brighter than a star. Without a breakdown of specific maps in this data, operators that have very niche placements would have their data skewed. 
---
Last, let's circle back and take a look at [Frost](https://i.imgur.com/Dvc3Oj6.png). For reference, here are the last few designer notes that came out before this one. Look for Frost's placement:  | [Y3S4.2](https://i.imgur.com/Qw0DqEs.png) | [Y3S3](https://i.imgur.com/AUJo83i.png) | [Y3S2](https://i.imgur.com/RtCR0fn.png) |
---
Can you identify the update to Frost that caused her to jump suddenly? For the last year and a little beyond she was considered completely underwhelming with a kit frequently put to shame by the newer operators being released. What changed? The first variable I mentioned is one thing that changed: Community Culture. Despite not having any tangible updates to her arsenal, she's being picked more. The meme that Frost was a bot catcher keeps growing by the day; the people of Siege are figuring out how to use her kit instead of just dismissing her. This is VERY similar to Blackbeard's DMR being discovered to be broken in terms of Damage. People joked avidly that there was no reason to run the DMR, that more bullets is always better, then after a significant amount of time with 0 changes to his DMR, people realized it was the biggest heavy hitter in the game and was extremely reliable. It got used to proactively that it ended up getting reworked due to the popularity; and people still will run it due to it being a comfy gun. The community elected to ignore a good gun for a significant amount of time, causing it to go under the radar.
---
Bring in the second variable: Map pool. Frost is *atrocious* on certain maps. Coastline? Sure, bring that Frost, she's got great potential. There are maps in the map pool like Chalet that are incredible for Frost picks where she's almost a staple along side maps like Border where she's almost completely absent. Take out any non-ESL maps and her pick rate plummets. Put in more non-ESL maps and her pick rate goes way up. This isn't due to the balance of the maps, it mainly comes down to the design and flow of those maps don't lend Frost much benefit compared to the others.

Hello PineSol_, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/bc3gmn/need_help/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
The numbers by themselves don't give the entire picture. 
---
The better win rate could be explained simply by people that loved her purely for the R4C+ACOG combo no longer playing her and reducing the data pool to better Ash mains that either didn't need the combo or always used the 1x.
---
it‚Äôs a glitch you can do with alibi
---
It happens your chances for me atleast (Ps4) is 50/50 id say if you want to ensure a good time have atleast one friend to play with cuz it's that much more fun and less chance of random VTKs passing. Casual can be pretty toxic at times but shrug it off most of the time they will lose for many reasons even if they do win. Ranked can be a bit nore serious but not as bad on these grounds you'll encounter the guy who thinks it's pro league and Flames and berates people just cuz he's truly bad or he thinks his ego is on the line just ignore that guy but listen for his callouts of he even gives any andyou should be fine. Since you are a beginner do the situations and classic terro hunt to learn the maps a bit cuz the rooms have names under the compass at the bottom of your screen and that will help you and who ever you are playing with give and get better callouts. If you get a bit heated and you will at times just step away cuz the game it's self can be frustrating at times just so you won't do something you'll regret cuz I've come very close to snapping a controller in half just cause I didn't step away for a bit. That's just some minor tips and welcome to the community.
---
Apparently not.
---
Maestro is prob my top 2 or 3 defenders, and I think this is a fine change. 
---
If your evil eye is set up well, you won't just let it get shocked twice. All it really means is that you won't be able to place it off site, unguarded, with a good chance of it not being destroyed.
---
What about year 2 Ela
---
Finka's next buff: Exploding drones.
---
Ubi: "ahh! now she is balance, oui?"
---
Huh, thanks for answering. I didn‚Äôt mean role playing as in role playing just as like not talking about anything but the game.
---
Yeah I mean I dont think ubi has it perfect but take like finka for example. According to the data she should be nerfed, but it has more to do with the people who play her play her well and since she has a low pick rate it's tough. All in all the data for any particular op is skewed by a number of factors and without giving everyone the same gun we cant know exactly how each op really fits. 
---
I agree with what you say though it is really hard to figure it out and balance but I think they are doing a decent job for how much complex issues there are. I think one of the most fundamental issues though is that there are plenty of people willing to abuse a broken mechanic or general game flaw and it makes it more about the stupid things than actual strategy. I mean picking ash because it's less likely you'll get hit by a bullet that should kill you, that's just dumb, crouch spamming, lean spamming, all things that arent meant to be used but are because all people care about is winning at any costs and not if it's fair or strategic, so ubi tries to fix these things and people complain. Siege community os just toxic and while I love this game I acknowledge that it's true, and ubi has a hard time fighting that.
---
It‚Äôs always the guy who got 0 kills who write ‚Äúez‚Äù

That was only while controlling his drone, I assume the change means he'll be visible when looking at any camera regardless of the type
---
simply incorrect

r/Rainbow6GoneWild

Can you please cross post this to r/rainbowsixcreative ? We would appreciate it over there!
---
I didn‚Äôt even like the acog on it, I prefer the red dot.
---
PS4?
---
Vigil on attack is basically new operator that will come around June/July. Lesion on attack is just Gridlock with invisible traps. Ash, Hibana and Capitao on defense will be like Jager and Bandit before they lost their ACOG's and that will make the game one sided (basically every defense will be won). Hibana's gadget is useless on defense. Lion is very bad idea. It would let the defenders stop the attackers for few seconds or locate them without any risk (for example with valkyrie you can lost the camera after spotting enemy). Glaz is only attacker that would be interesting on defense but I'm afraid he will dominate most of defense rounds with spawnpeeking enhanced by thermal vision.
---
tl;dr It would be decent game mode, only if certain attacker lost their acogs. Without this, there will be no balance and attacking will be ridiculoulsly hard. If there were no changes, I wouldn't even play this game mode because every attack would be lost.
---
Well, no. He sees quite a bit of PL play because in a coordinated team castle is more than viable. Unlike tachanka, his gadget is not inherently bad, which can't be remedied with skill. The shortcomings of castle aren't remedied by skill, but by teamwork and communication.
---
Finka of course. Lion only if you play casual.
---
don‚Äôt be a dick. if he got the art from an app with no source posted, he obviously can‚Äôt post the source.
---
Cant view this community (first thing i see when i click your link)
---
I will find you... and I will kill you.... (:
---
Oh wait you‚Äôre right
---
I'd argue they're about even. Mav has angled+better base ADS, better recoil, quicker reload, and hipfire, while Maestro has mag, DPS, and fire rate. Now if we throw the bailiff into the fray, then...
---
This is why your wrong i have provided facts for every one of my answers you have mainly said someing on the line of just "no"
---
SCOTLAND FOREVER
---
I mean, his name is "TinyMilkBag"...it's only right after an ace. Even if the aim is mediocre.
---
The castle isnt horrible, it dose block the window, but the rest of it males me want to go play Titianfall
---
Damn he even missed the knife
---
If you read his bio hes also straight up monster strong so that hammer *hurts*
---
Not that they have said, but this might just be the operator changes. I hope it comes out soon the time it‚Äôs taking with no word about it is ridiculous imo.
---
Yeah because it's not possible, I think.
---
A few minutes of google search didn't bring up anything, I'm sure an Ash charge hit an electrified wall, while Bandit got a kill.
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong though, I'd love to see a video of this happening!

---
It's impressive how you manage to say nothing of value in your entire comment. 
---
In any case, the performance of bad players is completely irrelevant; operators are and should be balanced entirely around those that play them best.
---
Thanks!
---
i wouldnt be surprised if they do the second one as his elite, seen as they did them in AC 2 and brotherhood, and instead of a smoke canister its a jar of leeches covered in TAR to make it stick.
---
i said simply incorrect bc your "facts" aren't facts, they're false
---
im not going to debate with someone who provides false information
---
I laughed more than i should.

The alibi is my friend and he asked why I opened it üòÇ

If you're after variety in the maps you play, map voting would be the worst thing Ubisoft could implement.  In every shooter I can think of that offers voting, players wind up choosing the same 3 - 5 maps over and over again.  While today it might feel like you only play the same 5 maps, voting would ensure that's what happens.
---
No and No

Upper Chest/Neck shot, just slow it down.

---
F for Twitch
---
Even without the baliff maestro can mow an entire attack down without reloading. Slow ADS doesn‚Äôt matter when you‚Äôre holding angles and prefiring. Maverick is a good op but his gun isn‚Äôt that spectacular especially compared guns like the F2 or R4C. Maestro on the other hand, nobody comes close to his Alda aside from maybe J√§ger on defense.
---
Yup
---
then perhaps you haven't experienced the Sniper 90 xd
---
She's better at higher ranks because it's much more fast paced than lower ranks, plus I assume placements are better as well. Her traps actually have the lowest hit rate at gold and silver.
---
Thank you
---
Twitch/Rook main playing ash with a mute flair
---
Ironic
---
Bandit, and Jager for primaries, and a good player with the SMG 12 can also shut down teams.
---
All these maestro mains crying bloody murder about how twitch and thatcher can now help destroy an evil eye as if it couldn‚Äôt be grenaded, Ashed, or smacked with a hammer? Lol. Maestro will be just fine as long as he has that chainsaw of a primary.
---
He‚Äôs not overly powerful, just annoying. He needs no nerf afaik.
---
Yet hammer op is still one of the best ops.
---
Are you looking for 144 FPS or are you gonna cap at 60

Congrats bud! Well played

Oh that‚Äôs really strange. I‚Äôm not sure at all what they mean then.

Sometime you gotta do what you got to do
---
I like the one on the left

Everyone's bitching about nerf's and buff's and all I want is for them to stop doing both for a season to fix the bugs in the core fuckin game mechanics.
---
you‚Äôre too deluded to argue with. you‚Äôll change your tune when these changes are added and see how wrong you are.
---
Nah
---
Since her ACOG is living on borrowed time, might as well buff her gadget.
---
That seems like you're then spending more money rather than less?
---
You didn't get my point, I was saying that in the note they said "win ratio increased", but it appears not so in the graph. I was not talking about the pick rate.
---
Memes
---
A worthy agrument!
---
Settle down, Hans.
---
I do that with Destiny oddly enough lol
---
I would had prefered more recoil on his lmg before this ridiculous nerf, looks like Ubi felt like keeping the nerf streak going after nerfing Lion and Glaz, yeah those two deserved it, but why Maestro? Just why?!?!
---
Thats just bullying‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Yes taht's true, but it should be at least harder for Twitch to destroy it, like it can open it for just enough time to be shot by and op or another shock drone, but not enough to be destroyed by the same shock drone that opened it, requiring at least a little more effort
---
Why weren't Doc and Rook nerfed sooner, then?  They've been mostly unchanged up until their recent nerf.  If they got nerfed because of the zero recoil+ACOG on a decent SMG, then shouldn't Echo's SMG be nerfed too?  Echo even has an arguably better gadget.  Same goes with Maestro. The Alda is a laser.
---
You're picking apart my word usage, and failing to address my overall point that unnecessary nerfs makes the game boring.
---
  
---
I understand why all of the changes were made, I just don't agree with them.
---
However there's no special conversation of lore between them in game. I think it's more like Pulse has a crush on Hibana but we don't know if Hibana loves Pulse back.
---
Isn‚Äôt Finka trying to get in Tachanka‚Äôs pants though?
---
Just saw the mid season patch notes. They are gonna make the flash time from 2 seconds to 7 seconds now. Not bad
---
 I always assumed it was because at higher ranks operators round corners holding angles instead of just walking in a way that they can see the traps on the ground
---
twitch fuckin dies
---
I 100% agree with that.  Getting rid of nasty bugs should be #1 priority.
---
Zofia, she's actually Ela's sister
---
I'd still take the MP5 over the Alda, but your point is still valid.
---
The same can be said for Yokais; both for Emps and Shock Drones
---
I was thinking of something like this the other day. A map like this would be really interesting and your ideas are good.
---
Sorry that I took a break from my computer for a few minutes.  There's nothing wrong with taking your time to formulate an opinion.
---
Yes I agree with the part that it should be harder to destory but not impossible like current state. I'm sure it will be balanced soon enough.
---
&gt;I dont know what rank you are but I see Maestro on every god damn Plat-Diamond match
---
I'm surprised I'm getting downvoted and people are agreeing with you when we literally have the pick rates of defenders in Platinum/ Diamond in the Designer Notes... **The data shows, Maestro is picked less than average**. 
---
&gt;It's really near impossible to counter his gadget if you dont have Ash or Zofia
---
Ash and Zofia are in the top five most picked attacking operators! Hard counters: shooting it... Zofia, Ash, Sledge, Maverick, frags (Finka, Buck). Soft counters: Twitch, Thatcher, Dokkaebi. Whaaa!? /u/BestBananaForever

Watch varsity gaming  siege school videos, watch alot of videos from higher level players. 
---
After that it's honestly just all practice, you can know everything in the game possible but if you can't shoot your not going to have a good time, so it's all just practice practice practice my friend. 
---
I watch all the siege school videos before even starting to play, and alot of other tips and tricks videos, just tried to know as much basic information as possible, and it really helped even having terrible aim as it wasy first FPS on pc, but just having some of the knowledge and tips I'd learnt could still do somewhat well and as my aim has improved over the last 4months and about 2weeks I've slowly gotten better and better, even getting several ace's, by no means am I amazing but I'm at a 50% win loss and a 1.3kd, you just have to put time in and learn it's a very in-depth game with a steep learning curve

True

Which means Twitch could destroy Evil Eyes without any need of teammate coordination. A significant buff.
---
I don't really feel anything about that.
---
I would be happy if he paid me for the fap material though. :V
---
Twitch can theoretically destroy just about anyone's gadgets before she even spawns. Maestro was the only gadget-based operator who had any kind of protection from twitch. This is a good change. I say this as someone who plays Maestro a lot.
---
Thank you, I know ela but straight up just didn‚Äôt know zofia

Hmmmmm. Debatable. I still prefer maestro

It really is bad. With Ying you generally waste a ton of time preparing to enter the site (destroying ADSs and traps, droning enemies and so on) so having to waste even more time to charge up the candelas is awful. And that's if we ignore that they removed the one mechanic that made Ying's identity which is rushing the site. A rework was in place here, not a nerf.

Recruit should get removed from the game. Only toxic team killing a holes play recruit. In my experience.

You have no idea dont you? They literarly gave Twitch the power to take out both Evil Eyes before she has spawned. No Jager cannot protect Evil Eyes because you dont place those in OBJ, you place them around the OBJ, which would be easly exposed to attackers, and you wont place an ADS in a place like that because it simply wont do shit. His LMG is not Top 3 Gun in Defense, yeah it has 81 bullets and ACOG, but the recoil is something that wont let you do things Rook and Doc mains do, which is Snipe across the map because of laser gun accuracy. His HipFire was nerfed a long time ago too. This nerf is just too much.

*Strike me down and I will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.*
---
The problem is "soon enough" will probably be when the new season launches, and until then Twitch will be a must pick
---
why does it matter
---
the arguments surpass yours by a landslide, how are they not good, what are your counter arguments?
---

---
She lost the claymore, now you can burn the ADS with the stuns and airjab the enemy site. Nice job UBI.
---
I know right, I think if ubi could remove an op then blitz would be right behind blackbeard
---
I think maybe a kill cam glitch, but I don't find any explanation on the issue.
---
My issue with people claiming grenades are counters, i find to be very situational.
---
Depending on the placement if the camera timing may be difficult, and for sledge and maverick there are places that after placed can be made unreachable.
---
This makes me happy
---
Trim the screen recording
---
The luckiest super shorty shot ever. This took a lot of skill, but that one shot makes me so salty
---
I want the gun nerfed not the drone, I'm arguing that the drone is a amazing and the gun is overpowered.
---
Prequel memes in R6? My lord, is that legal?
---
Z...Z-Zarya?
---
you can airjab someone through a wall?
---
That killcam perspective of the drone got me
---
Do you have a video of this happening after they fixed the shield rotation bug?
---
What?
---
Is your team uses the first lineup let me be the first to tell you, you are a piece of shit
---
Congratulations?
---
USING THE TWITCH DRONE
---
THE RIGHT WAY
---
Have you ever solo queued ranked in silver 1?? Because I‚Äôve had multiple strokes while carrying absolute bots
---
I think it works with electrified barbed as well.
---
I solo queued to plat this season
---
Airjabs are one of the best things to fuck around with in siege.
---
I respect your opinion
---
Russianbadger is amazing, one of my favorite YouTube channels
---
Because in pro-league he was basically a must-ban and frequently in ‚Äúgentleman agreements‚Äù to not be played because you could spam a Ying, Jackal, Dokkabei having a very well coordinated team with the old Lion and no one could really do shit. Not fun to play, or play against. And also isn‚Äôt very competitive. 
---
Lion at launch was fucking annoying even in casual. Every round ‚Äúyour about to get scanned‚Äù........BASS DROP, RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT yeah fuck that shit.
---
Sometimes killcams won't show them ADS when they are.
---
You screamed like you got hurt lmao
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem, I mean he‚Äôs gotta make a living and the videos are still entertaining
---
If you read the patch notes to operation burnt horizon you‚Äôll know that they never fixed it cause it caused a even bigger issue and haven‚Äôt mentioned it since
---
I had a game with a bot one time. It was infuriating.
---
What map is this? I don't remember a bathroom like that.
---
You drew someone‚Äôs drawing of tachanka drawing. Trippy
---
Yeah.  He went into that death box.  It don‚Äôt matter how many enemies there are you‚Äôll get clapped every time

We all have our moments
---
&gt;the supressor is a third party product
---
Built into the gun.
---
&gt;mavericks ar pmag is incompatible with beowulf 50 cal rounds
---
Maverick doesn't use polymer mags.
---
&gt;an p90 with an integrated supressor doesn't exist; neither does an obese female special forces operator
---
You're talking about the difference between a single truck driver and a weapon variant that totally shits on the basic premise behind its original design.
---
&gt;basing its validity on "lol thats soooo unrealistic!!" when this game is anything but realistic
---
A P90 with an integrated suppressor isn't unrealistic, it just makes absolutely no sense as a product.
---
&gt;There is no version of the kriss that fires fcking .308 battle rifle cartridges
---
Yeah, except implementing the Super-V mitigation system on a full-powered platform is a logical step. There's nothing logical about giving the P90 an integral suppressor.
---
Glad to hear it!
---
Jesus, TIL
---
you spelled escape from tarkov wrong /s
---
I did read the patch notes and i have played the game, it was fixed. But ever since Burnt Horizon released the killcams have been bugged. 
---
Your probably just upset about dying that one time.
---
We have a doc but I want a nurse
---
Thanks now i can't unsee it
---
The motherland smiles upon you
---
This is the best written thing ive seen in ages shut all those idiots up everything in this is pure facts
---
Yes, but he's still got the same comedy style as before and is still as shit/good at games then before. Nothing has changed except the fact that he's being payed by people who want him to promote them. Witch is fine.
---
You see, I strongly disagree. Having a reliable call out on their positions is super super helpful. And they aren't useless if Maestro dies, you can't re-angle them, but you can still see out of them. 
---
I'd also agree that trading an Evil Eye for a frag nade is worth it. An Ash and Zofia charge? Maybe. But Sledge and Mav can kill it for free, costing them literally nothing. 
---
And if a good headset and game sense is all you need, then why are Maestro and Echo the most banned ops in pro leauge? It's because cams are probably the most op thing in this game, and their gadgets are both cams that you can't just see and shoot. Why let them have your intel gathering items for such a low cost?
---
If you read them you would know that they never fixed it and I play monty a lot and it happens to me several times a day
---
i know what im talking about
