I mean they didn't travel all together tho... And feasibly it would work but nobody was watching anyone's back
---
---
---
They already do this. They added the RFF to squads if they don‚Äôt get it all it‚Äôs because they are not queued up together.
---
unranked but with less rounds
---
Casual was a way of life quick match is gay as fuck
---
Hey, do you play ranked? Would like to meet and play with german :&amp;
---
Literally hidden as far as possible away from the site. It truly is impressive
---
Oooh, gotcha gotcha. I didn't get far in Destiny, so!
---
thank you

You can just say no lol

Yup

It is really satisfying if you get a one tap and see it uhhh

You're welcome :)

As well as the rest of the team.
---
Well... i can.
---
Damn level 339
---
I saw this awhile back and was disappointed. 
---

---
That's why I still rock my diamond skin
---
i posted another post like this one but it got downvoted :(
---
Wouldn‚Äôt put it past Ubisoft they attend not to share everything that they touch in patch notes
---
Who
---
Nothing wrong with that.
---
Wow, one I might actually use/want.
---
cut the video, man.
---
Thanks for the feedback, I had no idea. Do you have any idea when they implemented this?
---
\#bringbackcasual This is a hashtag I've encountered and I think we should spread it around in the community.
---
Yeah... I need a life
---
Her ability literally allows her to breach kek
---
U think I'm playin?

They really seem to have stepped up their game, or just realized most players want black skins.
---
It‚Äôs been around since a couple of weeks into ember rise.
---
Naa.
---
Wait, u can buy it? Wtf. I thought they were making it limited. F
---
Dont worry I'm 251 üòú
---
How dare you disrespect master, you should be t-bagged by Cav for your sins
---
Im saying i like that idea. And im a vigil main
---
Agreed, I just throw in the sight Bc people might fight for it. Iron sight improvement like the P9 would be very nice
---
DAMMIT WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THESE AS UNIVERSAL SKINS ;-;
---
Some people like the new gamemode, it's alright but I do prefer Casual though.
---
Bruh only the fakes BUY ash elite
---
right?
---
And just think they plan on going for 50 seasons
---
And even if they don't do the plant spam the drone is visible for 2 seconds after the blast
---
Sure what about the new operators
---
Yes ghost recon one of the worst Ubisoft titles ever released

oh yeah my bad, nice flair

Are you joking? It‚Äôs just hexagons...
---
I see what you mean but I don't think casual should be taken seriously, I would rather the throwers play casual or mess around in casual than ranked. I just don't like the change since it makes it feel a bit like ranked. I don't see why they couldn't make it a separate gamemode because I imagine a lot of people do like Quickmatch but a lot of people also like the old casual so I could see this being the reasonable compromise.

there's basically no difference between new quick game and causal, other than round structure that doesnt change how the game if played

Probably to represent how drunk the devs were when making this map lol

Aw, well good clip
---
That was the best vid ever
---
why are you still using a wifi connection SMH. /s

Thanks mate
---
The Bell Curve shows that Bronze 1 to Gold 3 are the average, so anything Gold 2 and above would be above average. So I‚Äôd say Gold 3 is probably when you are a good player.

I remember my entire team and me climbing up the stairs on Plane and getting mowed down in a 2 second ace by some spawn peeker. I thought it was epic.
---
Just remove duplicates. That‚Äôs all they need to do. If I‚Äôve played your game for this many hours, I should have more opportunity to get the new stuff
---
Dont barricade the whole OBJ, and if you have impacts on bomb, make a whole in the wall between the objectives

Get used to all the ops. And find someone good to help teach ya
---
I mean he's already in Tora Bora kit lol
---
Should be 2019 kit instead
---
No, there was no need for it to be a thing. There is not improvement in my opinion that this change adds. I Play casual  for the casual experiences, not a discount ranked experience.
---
Because that‚Äôs what heroes do.
---
done
---
Yeah, she's really overpowered still. Especially in the lower ranks and double especially on console.
---
Next you‚Äôll be crying there aren‚Äôt any trans or gay ops.

Usually every major update brings about new Legendary skins to the Alpha Pack pool. This was new since I could not find any info about this elsewhere on Reddit.

I got the legendary doge charm, it‚Äôs my favourite.

Yeah it doesn‚Äôt fit at all. Nothing does anymore.

---
And it's ironic that in 1 day I can get more AP losing a lot and winning very few than winning a lot in a row :(
---
literally why, why would they waste my luck on a legendary that honestly just looks like the dot underneath commons.
---
I'm not exactly sure anything should be failing though. I've only had my PC for about 3-4 months so all the parts are still relatively new.
---
Drake, where the tail rotor?
---
If you balance and develop around casual players you get a casual game. The ONLY way to develop a competitive game is to balance around the highest level of competition
---
Think about it: why would they make changes to a competitive game based on feedback from players who aren‚Äôt good at it and haven‚Äôt spent much time with it instead of players who are highly skilled and time invested?
---
I have mixed opinions on this one hahaha
---
He‚Äôs got a hot head so that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs the hostage lol
---
I love surveys , thats done from me hood sir , good luck in your project
---
I only care about this if you can use the gun coming out of it as a weapon
---
Yeah, the last season I was super excited for was Operation Ember Rise to be honest. I know they reused weapons but I thought the abilities were going to be awesome but sadly they kind of fell flat for the most part but I really love the game so I am just playing until the next season to be honest. I hope with the next season they are able to blow the community away with new weapons, great operators and hopefully a brand new map since I am worried that Siege is entering a period of stagnation that they might not be able to get out of and I hope they don't because they still have 24 seasons until they stop adding in new operators for the 100 operator goal they have set for themselves. I don't want Operation Burnt Horizon being remembered as the last good season I want the last Operation ever in the next six years to be remembered by the Siege community instead because a amazing game like this deserves that.
---
In his outfits
---
Even csgo or PUBG.
---
But since 6siege also a console game.. It going to be hard to implement
---
its not tho
---
As a constructive criticism, pie your door way much much wider, don‚Äôt flag each other, and you want to stay away from a wall about arms length as bullets ride walls. 
---
Lastly, and it may be part of the story, I don‚Äôt know; but operator that swaps to the other side of the doorway leaves her partner vulnerable; why cover the same angle - it‚Äôs redundant. 
---
All that being said, I‚Äôm excited for this! Looks promising.
---
I love that tachanka
---
It would be interesting but personally not my favorite. I‚Äôd love another game mode like the Wild West one with the Bosg and acog
---
It's too powerful it's perfect
---
This made me so happy
---
It is tho
---
Its not tho
---
I want a mode where everyone is a three speed with M870
---
Mine was the Tac 9. I love the skin, but the gun is...controversial
---
Why? Everyone says ‚ÄúAA-DD makes casual not casual‚Äù but no one can answer why
---
Lol #Acog M870
---
it‚Äôs all i play
---
Well now I want that
---
nvm im retarded
---
Honestly I like it alot but thats a rare at best
---
Why don‚Äôt you just throw your gun at them
---
If they add the k-9 unit are you ok with killing a dog.
---
Lol
---
He‚Äôs wearing it so he doesn‚Äôt hear your panicking voice when you‚Äôre blinded.
---
Do you miss?
---
Yes, but actually no
---
Your siege may be bugged.  It should be there, you could go to shop and search for outfits, then click he elites and should find bandits there
---
Ok so you‚Äôre down 0-2 and then guess what??? You get to play on defense
---
It‚Äôs exactly the same in terms of your chances to win, it‚Äôs just a mental block if you play worse when you‚Äôre down 0-2
---
i found it i had to restart
---
He‚Äôs really good at yoga
---
I feel the same way about consulate
---
Lmao no prob
---
I'm sure he's a good person but he's probably actually named Jude or something and we all know how people named Jude are
---
Hopefully
---
Yeah sounded like that was the issue
---
What about AA-DD makes it less casual
---
Casual is casual because it‚Äôs short and there‚Äôs no abandon penalty and the rounds are longer and there‚Äôs random site picks
---
Is he named Jude?
---
Sigh
---
Looks more like phishing
---
Get of the nostalgia trip, original hereford could be described as literally a stair case because controlling that one staircase determined who'd win or lose.

Out of curiosity what is your job that let's you wear that?
---
What skin is that?

Armed Security!

Probably lost 1 game on it so it must be bad.

This is the definition of every r6 player at some point

Oh no I like the new rotations. I was just differentiating that it isn't the same as casual was

1. You had reverse friendly fire on already
---
2. You and that teammate are in a party

3. You did enough damage to him before he died that it earned you the reverse friendly fire mid shooting him.

I can see you enjoy it! Good cosplay you put a lot of time and effort into it obviously. Good job!

It might have been a test pilot series one skin. They came out with a pilot series 2 fairly recently removing the old skins
---
It can be activated through settings.

Which ops were in chimera? It‚Äôs been so long since then lol

Normal Fuze with Lion is already a good combo. Really don‚Äôt want to see it with this buff idea. lol

Didn‚Äôt work for me either

If you could rellicate the glitch then its something that they need to fix

Hate it. I don‚Äôt like it in ranked and now I‚Äôm stuck with it in casual. I don‚Äôt like Ubi meddling with casual tbh, nobody complained about it.

Damn really? That sucks, I now have two ancient sets then lol

Does Russia count as Asia?

Wamai hands down.

J√§ger, Doc and Rook, or Maestro. I think Maestro because 80 rounds, an acog, and 900 RPM? Like what the fuck?
---
Where is Blackbeard?
---
Those are mostly casuals, Kali's strength is in her utility, she's definitely not a good fragger.
---
What operator is that?!

---
Can you share details or screenshots?
---
Is this update live yet? Haven't been on in a couple weeks.
---
Buying the pass comes with tons of pros, yes it‚Äôs 30$ per actual season but you get 6 operators a week early and vip % off all purchases, so where you‚Äôre spending 28k renown it‚Äôs only 24k for vip. It‚Äôs dumb but with the amount of content and support over the years and the game is still a powerhouse they gotta make the coin somehow.
---
It's imperfections make it perfect...
---
Now kill me pls
---
It is indeed very scaled down
---
If you get the intention, then why are you making this post? Their goal is to make money.
---
Is it just me or like 80% of the time someone says "rip headphone users" its only because they have their volume so high that they are damaging their ears?
---
Damn homie. You can read all this comments on this thread and still say it wasn‚Äôt a part of the meta. I‚Äôm just trying saying it was a thing back then along with the other redditors.
---
For now I only played her in casual, if there‚Äôs no hard breacher ( which is pretty much always the case) I go full on fragger, so for her sniper. 
---
You can frag but it‚Äôs definitely not her purpose.
---
that‚Äôs an instant cop

You said it in a dick way though ‚Äúhomie‚Äù.

Agreed because her launcher is an ash charge with Thatchers emp so it can help take out anti hard breach gadgets at an range.
---
I appreciate that, I‚Äôm also a glaz main but I play on Xbox and I panic sometimes
---
Look they didn't simulate the P90's polymer magazine so I doubt they're gonna make skins for all weapons that have all of their components
---
So have good stats but that doesn‚Äôt really mean anything ( except W/L which is kinda important).

If by "Mail &lt;address&gt;" you mean that's you your email provider said sent that message to you. Then I have to inform you that you can spoof email. Sending a message which "claims" to be from abc@insertdomainhere.com when it really came from spoof@malious.com. 
---
Most people won't have full end to end encryption on their email because it is not convenient for regular (or most above average users). Therefore emails you receive can change the sender address.
---
It is very similar to a letter. You can claim the return address is anywhere (there may be checks in place in irl mail)
---
TL;DR don't click any links in emails you aren't expecting, and emails can claim to be send by 1 address when  they were not. This is a form of fishing as listed above.
---
oh no
---
I played wired because it was casual and I didn't care.
---
ah I see. Yeah i agree. It‚Äôs like right below it
---
English pls
---
That part of the hitbox might count as a leg shot with the diminished damage. So basically you did like 72 dmg to her with that shot or something along those lines (base damage 97, limb shot multiplier 0.75 on a 3 spd op). That's a difficult subject, since it's definitely not a chest shot, so in my books that doesn't deserve the 1 shot down, but on the other hand, it's way more accurate than a shot at the knee and should get rewarded more. Tough to say, since we can't know how much damage you did to her. Could be that you did the full 97...
---
was thinking about that when looking at this drawing. but maybe hes just sad because he has low pick rate
---
Nice
---
Maybe later in?
---
I just started playing haha, two ends of the spectrum
---
On the store it says I purchased it but it doesn‚Äôt give me an option to download it
---
Her primary gadget destroys castles also if you didn‚Äôt know her rifle doesn‚Äôt destroy wall studs
---
yeah I see what you‚Äôre saying. they said they had 3HP left so it ended up doing a bit of damage anyway
---
thanks
---
Thanks
---
He just looks a bit chunky that's it
---
Nice drawing
---
Needs more thicc
---
Ok yeah, so it was the full damage then, good. Then I would say that was an OK scenario. You obviously just need to be more accurate to down her.
---
That‚Äôs really good, do u charge?
---
Literally what my friends said üòÇ

Head is also a bit small, but it‚Äôs still my first.

Not sure what system you're on but I'm on PC and if you are as well, I'd be game to squad up with you. I'm not the best myself but I've been playing since beta.
---
Holy shit this is old...
---
Real original insult there. Im allowed to point out why shit jokes are shit. I dont have to find it funny just because its a joke.
---
Let me just clear myself, I don‚Äôt feel any pity for people who play the new ops and get teamed kill, most I‚Äôve encountered that do die because of that take it super seriously and get pissed off, they start throwing death threats, and that‚Äôs why, the ones I‚Äôve encountered throw death threats over a game, a hobby
---
Also I want to add I came here because I figured if anyone would know itd be you guys. I tried finding other posts on it but everyone had different things to say, like ‚ÄúIt doubled my renown‚Äù or ‚Äúit barely gave me anything not worth it‚Äù They were also like 4 year old posts so maybe they changed how they work by now. I even tried going to Ubisoft support to ask how much extra renown they could give me, but they straight up told me they cant give me in game information. Idk why but its all good.
---
Comes in your emails when the new season was released
---
ffs
---
Wamai seems a bit less useful than j√§ger, since it‚Äôs only one charge but then again it refreshes over time sooo, but they can also be placed anywhere and can sometimes slow the attacking push but his guns are worse so probs a tier down, or the same tier as j√§ger. Kali seems fun but only seems like she‚Äôll work in somewhat long range situations and maybe mid range, but he C-75 does make up for that tbf. Her gadget is pretty useful and her sniper is a one shot down with some pretty nice utility, so I‚Äôm guessing A-tier? The problem is she‚Äôs very much a solo operator apart from her gadget so idk. This is pure speculation btw just my predictions
---
last time i activated a booster i played so much i hitted the 24 hour exp limit and sucked 50k+ renown out of it, needless to say i was burned out after it.
---
This happened to me with my two premades.
---
We played 3v5 two times in a row...
---
This is the whole set I think. Looks [sick af](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDppn58XUAEwbIx?format=jpg&amp;name=large)
---
From my experience the only ones that are worth it are the 30 and 90 day boosters since they last longer.
---
Ok.  So don't buy the battle pass then if you don't like it.  Even if this supposed "premium track?" costs $10.  So you pay $10 and get 100 levels maybe of unlocks?  Sure, a lot may be filler stuff, but it's better than one $10 item from the store.  Would you rather them just add another $10 item set in the store?  At least for this $10 you can get a lot of content and enjoyment if you are into that sorta thing.  If not, just pass on it, just like you would on some skin that doesn't interest you.  You won't be weaker by not getting it.  I mean how is it nickel and diming players?  Every game with a battle pass charges for it.  It's an $8 game and still gets new maps 4x a year and 8 new ops a year.  So they charge $10 for a battle pass.  OMG.
---
Every game I've played with battle passes, you gain levels by playing.  Fortnite, Apex Legends, Black Ops 4, Modern Warfare, etc.  Every match you play, you get some xp.

There is supposed to be a campaign/coop story next year and nighthaven is a part of the storyline. Maybe they are, everything feels off with them.

no he's the new SIX as Aurelia got promoted
---
Saw you're playing on XBox so I don't know if this is useful, but if you can set your audio to night mode it helps a lot. Explosions are a bit more muffled but footsteps are louder so it's easier to hear where people are coming from, especially if you're playing with headphones.

I used to destroy it and hide my valk cams in its glass debris .. doing evil for the greater good :(
---
You have no idea how game development works, putting that skin in the game and have it look good with animations etc would take like 5 fps from everyone just for one stupid skin...
---
Dont forget they wrapped P90's magazine with tape so they dont have to animate it...

Ubi sees interest in making content unavailable since it creates artificial rarity and hype for interested players. They believe it pushes players to the edge and the more invested (in efforts) they are in this game, the more likely they will slip in the future and pay money for temporary content or boosters for alpha packs. Even if players don't, the developers will still get an active community so they're winning either way.

Lmao ok. This game did not survive because of ‚Äúthe memes.‚Äù People still play it because it‚Äôs a fun game. Casual is... casual? There really nothing wrong or different about it post update. The 2x map rotation is actually helpful because it gives players a second chance on what they screwed up on the first round, allowing them to learn and try something better or be smarter rather than just swap sides and everyone forgets what they did wrong. It makes games more balanced and fair this way, and it‚Äôs called quick match now because that sounds better and people take it more seriously. You‚Äôre still allowed to ‚Äúfuck around‚Äù or team kill, spawn kill, run shotgun on attack, if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs fun for you. I really like the state quick match is in right now, give it a chance.

No mate, i want steve irwin overhaul for his elite
---
Move back out again and hope he doesnt see the c4 in his face
---
from the title and the first half of video i assumed you were just gonna stay behind him for a little while then try to knife him and he would turn around and shoot you. it was much worse, my brain mentally screamed *fuck* when you threw that c4 lol
---
Were you trying to put a C4 on his ass? Would be an amazing kill to pull off
---
Nope, thank you

Go play CoD if thats what you want

git gud

A booster is worth only if you have the time to grind renown for it. In theory, if you're farming House on t-hunt classic with a friend, you can get around 8000-10 000 renown per hour but it's really tiring on an emotional level. Also keep in mind you have a cap of 50 000 renown max you can farm each days.
---
It‚Äôs literally the same thing all that changed is the name and 2 consecutive attack defense rounds that‚Äôs it it‚Äôs really good now

It wouldn't get many views even if you cut it short because it's a garbage play.
---
Community found it too op and cried about it so Ubisofts nerfed it

Lmao fucking nigger just get good

It‚Äôs not the best game out there, I can agree with that but there is an addicting feel to it.

Half of the plays here are garbage what's your point?

Battlefield isn‚Äôt a 5v5 close quarters realism tactical game tho. At all. And that‚Äôs how it is with every game. Battlefield just got 1 million players back because of battle royal lmao which is 60 percent up from before it dropped.

‚ÄúRainbow six siege now has more then 30 million registered across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. Ubisofts multiplayer shooter launched in December 2015, and it has been steadily growing in popularity ever since. In August last year it reached 20 million players, with 2.3 million daily active users‚Äù - gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-04-13-rainbow-six-siege-reaches-30-million-registered-players
---
Same bro. Literally saw Beaulo play her that rush on Border. I got back into Siege played her non-stop, got 6 hours 107 kills on her with a 1.41 KD and 1.49 W/L. Now my stats literally erased.
---
She too god plus shes new sooo......
---
I suspect the art team who make the skins is different to the people who do 3d modelling. Designing skins is relatively simple, you use UV maps and just wrap onto the model. This would require the gun models to be almost completely redone, I really don't think this is what the Devs need to focus on, considering how many silly little bugs still exist. Ie not being able to rejoin ranked games you get disconnected from...
---
You're not salty much? Great Post though. As a thrower myself, these are the posts I look for so thank you.
---
That‚Äôs the ALDA for ya
---
Nose, mustache, hairline.
---
What did I just watch. This is amazing
---
Ow nice really didnt know this change
---
He looked at me funny
---
It can be important. Allow attackers more than one way through makes it very hard to defend cash. It's important to keep garage control.
---
It's the same on PC, it can't be controlled since it's random.
---
Can‚Äôt call it a good site line, can you have two other spots where somebody can get you from. Let alone three. You‚Äôve got the two windows to your left unless you have amazing reaction time you‚Äôre dead, you‚Äôve got the door behind you unless you have amazing reaction time you‚Äôre dead. Those aren‚Äôt good spots. A good spot is somewhere where you can get a great angle with a little threat to you.
---
Step 1 - shoot it.
---
Step 2 - burn it.
---
Step 3 - eat it.
---
Step 4 - poop it.
---
Step 5 - flush it.

Because she's relatively new.

I say it pretty at my first spawn on the map tbh
---
Unpopular opinion: I actually don‚Äôt mind the new voice actors
---
I bet it's gonna be called Gallipoli
---
PMM ACOG when?
---
Yeah but it will be more usable when your playing with a good team, they can support you and give info too. But at all you are right.
---
shush
---
When they add new content that the voice actors react to they have to add new voices, and plus it would make sense to change it all rather then just snippets here and there
---
thats fair.
---
This would be cool!
---
Damn I actually really  love this
---
hOw oRiGinAl
---
Thank you lol
---
Im on for it dude
---
I was going to say you should explain to the Americans what "thongs" are, then I realised speedo's need explaining too, which then lead me full circle to thinking that a misunderstanding of the word "thong" helps explain what a "speedo" is. I'm mentally exhausted.
---
Make me, junior.
---
Honestly, are you even surprised?
---
wtf i never had this
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind this
---
You could say this about literally every gadget in the game but ok
---
Clash would‚Äôve been amazing in this but holy damn that‚Äôs so amazing üòÇüòÇ
---
They are hardware that gives you an advantage - if that's what you're wondering?
---
At that point it would make more sense to delete casual altogether, then. Changing a game mode to be more like the other two game modes in order to boost player numbers in those other game modes is nonsensical.
---
There are players who don't play for competition. And those players won't like unranked any more than ranked. Ubi thinking that creeping normality will work is shortsighted, it's more likely to lead to those players looking at other games when they conclude that Ubi's only interested in making the game as close to pro league as possible.
---
Moose knuckle
---
Neither, maybe us consolers didn‚Äôt get it...
---
Yea I much prefer the p12 because generally if I have it out I'm in a difficult situation and would rather the extra ammo to try and spam a headshot.

next thing you know, this skin becomes pay to win as 5 man squad spams their gun together and crashes their opponent
---
Spend some time looking at what you do right and wrong in a game. Not sure whether you play Console or PC but if you play PC, perhaps record a couple of your games when playing and what them back. Make notes on things you did well and things you did poorly and could improve upon. Then you can hone in or the finer details on how to improve. Doesn't have to be every game and can very much be a bad game.
---
Also, make sure you think before you act when making a play. For example, if you feel the need to get greedy on a kill but also feel that staying alive will be more beneficial, take a second to think it through. I know that sounds super simple, but too many times can you get hyped in the heat of the moment, push for a kill that isn't entirely warranted or required to go for, and then pay the price but losing your life.
---
These would be 2 of my suggestions if you really want to make that push out of hard stuck G1/P3. It's advice I used myself and noticed a significant improvement from when I first started to now.
---
The easiest tip I can give is simply play the game. With time, you will learn more and have better experience to then push the higher ranks.
---
If this hasn‚Äôt happened to you once you haven‚Äôt played seige
---
Literally me when I got the kill
---
I‚Äôve had that happen to me also
---

*when the whole crew arrives, and it's just you in cooler aspects, so you're fangirling the entire time.*
---
It's a huge department job my dude, you clearly have no idea what goes into something like this, it's a huge overhaul on the art assets of the game, it's not worth it for a single skin line, nor would it be even if it was visible at all times in the game, its such a pointless change with so much effort input
---
*Perfectly* balanced, as all things should be.
---
Not like someone is actually going to peek that door to take out the Kaid charge if it was placed beneath.
---
You're better off just throwing it on the bottom of do what you did in this clip.

Next step: being able to use this skin in ranked matches
---
Because its a vidya game? I mean when BB and valk fight each other, its the navy seals killing one another, and that doesnt make sense either, does it?
---
F2000‚Äôd be awesome
---
&gt; Playing Siege like it's Call of Duty
---
But you didn't tell anyone that you slept with their mom.
---
Pulse, doc, tachanka and ela are too high, valk, maestro, echo, sledge, mute, blackbeard, monty, rook, castle are too low.
---
EXACTLY. Hate how people put doc over rook. If doc dies, NOONE is getting a revive. Rook gives you a chance at being knocked down. Way bigger help for the team
---
Because it's only done out of hate right?

Mmr loss/gain during placement is 100 mmr points. Itll start to decerease as your rank averages out

Or just stop reworking and recycling shit and give us new maps and guns. This year is the first yer I bought a season pass to and wow, most the guns and abilities are copy paste from previous ops. Not worth the money
---
Sadly I know but that‚Äôs why I made this post. To get more people trying to get ubi to add new guns. I mean tons of people got the bosg acog so why not #newgunsubi. Hmm
---

Why are jackal, Kapkan and hibana so low?

I got 19 kills and my teammates lost a 2vs4 on 4-4 matchpoint.
---
PMM is the name.
---
Unfortunately they're going for urban theme
---
I'm pretty sure that was just bait bro
---
They didn't go halfway. They added consistency. Ubi has, time and again, said that they want casual to be casual. They won't make casual ranked.
---
I don't think *any* of us were ready for that.
---
There are too many good skins locked behind alpha packs üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
I like how you only included OG operators, nice touch
---
9.6gb on pc
---
It‚Äôll probably have something to do with a firefighter, because all elite skins deal with someone‚Äôs past
---
I do get that and that's why I don't play ranked with work and my personal life I don't want to commit to ranked. But in regards to the program it isn't AI, it isn't thinking it's designed by people for people and like I said a HUGE part of game design is how it effects your emotions.
---
If you know any game design a lot of it is psychological and again like I said you should read up on flow theory as its a good example of what I'm talking about.
---
Well that makes sense but they should have chosen a better voice
---
Pelaa paremmin :)
---
The fo12 was the 3rd lowest damaging shotgun. Has a much wider range than most of the other shotguns, and high recoil. 
---
The m950 a pump action does more damage per pellet than the fo12 at cqc ranges up to 10m. Past that the fo12 deals i believe it was 2 more damage at mid range but the m950 takes longer ranges back again. The m950 has a tighter spread nonetheless making it easy to hit shots at range. But it deals the damage in longer intervals. The fo12 has less damage and is less likely to hit its pellets at range. So in its ability to compete with the other guns it has a larger magazine and higher fire rate. Lower damage but delt out in shorter intervals. 
---
Please tell me how a shotgun that was exactly on par with every other buckshot shotgun was overpowered.
---
Old
---
Then what tho
---
What the fuck is your problem bro? I‚Äôm plat and I personally never really see Mavericks, and I almost never see one that knows what they are doing. Most the time when I see a maverick I kill them because they can‚Äôt play him well. If the maverick player knows what he‚Äôs doing, YOU CANT SHOOT HIM like damn I‚Äôve said it a million times. 
---
If you really think that shooting someone is a counter then you don‚Äôt understand the game. ‚ÄúJust shoot lion‚Äù ‚Äújust shoot bb‚Äù and no I‚Äôm not saying he is as blatantly overpowered as lion or bb were, but if the person knows how to play him he has no counter. 
---
Every operator in the game can be either countered (denied by another gadget) or is so weak/exposed you CAN just shoot it. Maverick can destroy two hatches, while if you have something so simple as a drone, claymore (which he has), teammate, or if he hears you your whole idea of shooting him isn‚Äôt possible. When maverick is on a hatch, if he stands correctly, you CAN NOT SHOOT HIM. If he is repelled on a wall or is maveriking above himself significantly, you CAN NOT SHOOT HIM. Yes maybe if you press your face against a wall and stare down, maybe yes, but then you‚Äôre realistically dead anyways.
---
Pretty difficult for him to burn a whole big enough to walk through? Yeah okay. I don‚Äôt play him and I can do it in 1.5 fuel canisters (which he has 5 of)
---
Yeah I posted something about this a couple weeks ago
---
As a Valkyrie main, I approve greatly.
---
Oh oof, well it's still good for the future then potentially. That Vulkan was lit
---
Imma tell my kids copper was diamond
---
I think the only changes that need to be done is making his ability gauge work like Cav, Nokk, and Vigils. Where you can use it even when it‚Äôs half full and all that good stuff.
---
Or if you get spotted.
---
I agree, but it‚Äôd be nice to get at least 1-2 new guns each season. Look at Operation Chimera. Finka and Lion each got one unique new gun and the rest of their loadout was recycled. I‚Äôm perfectly fine with reusing secondaries and some primaries, but I have to admit that I do miss getting new weapons. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm buying Kali instead of Wamai when they come out.

A lot of them time when I‚Äôm playing thatcher and I‚Äôm below the floor that needs an EMP, I throw the EMP at the highest position in the room and it still usually gets the job done.
---
I honestly have no words. I have 1000+ hours on siege too. 99% of the time I am playing Casual.
---
They are making changes nobody asked for. Screwing with maps in the past, whatever. Now they are messing with Casual and added that stupid rappel exit. 
---
Siege has peaked for sure and is going downhill.
---
**YUGE**
---
And then you realize there is not a single support op, because everyone went 3 speed, full soft breach and they are all yelling, "iT's CaSuAl".

I have never been this frustrated holy shit.
---
your playtime and rank???????
---
and why u so stupid to look this way and not just open your eyes and look at all players in this game, here is many solo players so must be and inplemented gameplay helping for solo player game experience too.
---
For example you play every day 5 hours or more some games with friends some not because friends dont want play for so much time like you, here we see again that your words is wrong and people leave casual often for sure its sometimes just maybe because he need to go somewhere and cant play but its many other reasons like his team is losing or starting game in attacker was reason he left game too, stop looking things people dont care and start look at things most people want so game will be more enjoyable and brings more other new players.
---
i am pissed off from this fkin discussion because i better go play game i can enjoy without wasting my time to explain an idiot what is good for game and what is bad.

well, now i want to see it

Impeccable

Looks an awful lot like an Xbox Elite controller hmmmMMMMM

Very well done

Kali is well balanced but people are already so salty, that she constantly gets banned in ranked since day one...
---
*Fortnite Default Dance Music Theme*
---
Ban Fockin and you‚Äôre set

Done
---
This is... Confusing
---
The only good thing about recycled weapons is you can use black ice on newer ops if they‚Äôre the older guns.
---
I don‚Äôt know why i didn‚Äôt do it sooner but I just recently found out about clubs on Xbox where you can request to play with a group and get a five stack easily, it really helps with ranked
---
My team and I always ban ash or thatcher. Ash is just for pissing off weebs but thatcher creates interesting situations for both teams.
---
If you hit your target in the torso it will instantly down

God damn it, I can't unsee it now.

They keep ruining this game smh

After that, the world was never the same.

HMMMMM. Kali like thatcher she is. Better she is.  Fun she is to play. Hard breacher she is not.
---
Not new, I got it last season.

it was ranked

i just sighed really loud

I went "oooof"

Iirc gmmk is a great 60%

Six-12SD? Or FMG9? Big questions out here

Not very sure but I think Kali's LV only does like less than 5hp of damage

Well if you're low enough elo you don't have to ban hibana cause almost no one wants to pick a hard breacher to help the team. Also, in my low elo experience, people barely pick Dok. People do, however, pick ash almost every single round of every single game..
---
Are they going to remove team chat as well? Cause if someone's toxic in all chat there's a high chance they'll be even more toxic in team chat.

This is ridiculous.

No

Oh come on. These will be reports that have been validated, not just the raw number of reports.

Which has nothing to do with this thread.

Pistol downs with headshot and is much harder to aim with than with a full auto reflex gun

Sounds pretty dumb honestly.

16:10 is pretty neat as a middle ground

This hand made me think of [Scary Movie 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t_tgiWatvs)
---
I feel like Kaid and Bandit serve their own purposes now; Kaid is for general wall coverage, Bandit is for versatility and bandit tricking. But of course, it's better to have both! Atleast in *(((quick match)))*.
---
I met some of my friends from the enemy team. Honestly I think they are hurting themselves.
---
Personally i think this change sucks ass. I get that some people are sensitive and get upset when some player says GG EZ but come on.
---
What they should do is add an option that lets players hide cross-chat if they dislike it. Don't gut the feature entirely just because a handful of assholes are using it incorrectly.
---
I'm in the same boat. I'm generally good at shooters but this one requires map familiarity, comms, and practice. Add me, DrMantisTobbogN
---
Just play terrorist hunt and practice from there. The games not that hard and I hope you know how to lean left and right when aiming.
---
Why is this funny
---
You're weird if you *don't* TK at 3 votes (if you're being kicked for basically no reason)

I wish they would have made a bundle of these skins for several weapons, this is one of the best.

Remove Favela when, Ubisoft please.

lmao this glitch happens way to much its great

Cav please

Vigil
---
Montagne plz!

smoke or sledge uwu

Wow. It is so rare that I come across someone being toxic or blatantly annoying in chat and when there is, I just mute them. I don't understand. This is like cutting off your arm just because you got bit by a spider.

1- no gun skin. Gold R6 charm

2- Obsidian (black diamond) gun skin.       Carbon fiber R6 charm
---
3-Damascus Gun skin. Meteorite R6 charm.
---
4-lava gun skin. Magma R6 charm.
---
There already is an option to get rid of text chat
---
Not really. If you're bandit tricking cc tv wall, you would need a couple of thatcher emps there. And maybe one on the construction wall. Normally you can pretty much shoot the kaid out if its bellow the 'indestructable walkway'.
---
Are your friends Thatcher mains?
---
i‚Äôd take sledge
---
Yeah this is an ultra boring skin, but this community has a boner for all things "realism," &amp; this skin sort of plays into that
---
I mean, you can already hide enemy messages.
---
Sledge or cav please if either is taken then smoke
---
No. If you go to proleague finals and what not you can get custom charms and skins. Usually skins are reserved for those participating in the tournament tmk

All chat is nice when you are in operator selection phase and just want to chat and fool around.
---
I‚Äôm late so if anything‚Äôs left hmu
---
I just want it to remain how it is, that's all
---
Some of those were wondering which skins are previous seasonal skins. I made a list
---
3-Damascus gun skin. Meteorite R6 charm.
---
Sledge or caveira, Smoke is nice too! Any of these codes would be so dope! Thx for this giveaway, that‚Äòs very kind :)
---
Perhaps there the new people for t-hunt coming in the next year
---
But it's not. Ranked switches every three rounds, Casual every 2
---
At least add it back for casual/ quick match
---
bb without shield = just play a other operator
---
I‚Äôd forgotten about those books! Good mems

I'm dummy, what's Grinder?

1. Narcissists are actually inferior (I'm on reddit, so psycology lesson is a no, but if you want, check [this](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201807/5-ways-narcissists-compensate-their-inferiority) out).
---
2. R6 to put it simply is not your type of game, since it is based around cooperation.
---
3. No you don't know what you are talking about.
---
4. No you didn't even talk about changes here, this is just bs.
---
5. I bet my boots you can't design a proper, competitive map.
---
6. Lmao "soak" what am I? a sponge
---
PM Sent enjoy your impenetrable wall of toxic shield trolling!
---
I think I've never seen the gun without the shield. I don't even know how it plays without it (yes I know when the match starts you don't have it but I never used it)
---
Looks like the beta models of thermite and the other ops before they had unique gadgets. Check the original E3 trailer. It's them in black pretty much
---
 I feel like if they would have just changed the name all together I would feel better about it. It's not theme park, it barely feels like theme park. 
---
If they would have said, "We're removing Theme park and replacing it with a new map." I feel like I could look at this thing more objectively. As it is, it just feels like a shitty rework of a mediocre map.
---
I usually do but when I‚Äôm having a bad day then I play him and all of a sudden I just do betyer
---
I just wanna say gg and make haha funny jokes :(
---
I‚Äôm 99% sure it says 1x zoom
---
Oh. what the fuck then.
---
What a ridiculous change. What demographic are they pandering to with this change? Are there seriously that many players who complain about text chat? In 90% of the games i play i barely see anyone typing anything anyhow.
---
Before you know it they're going to replace blood splatter with rainbow paint too.
---
what was the buff?
---
I would upvote but it‚Äôs at 169
---
Yea I mean the shield is overpowered so I decided not to use it and I pretty much always do good when I don‚Äôt use the shield
---
Yeah cause the bosg is still shit at ranges where ACOG would actually help lol. Doesn't matter how well you can see someone with your sight if your gun can't kill them anyway
---
To be fair, I‚Äôll only use montagne for pure tactics. When executed, nothing feels better
---
*glitter. Rainbow is magic was a great event
---
But when your teammates are constantly telling the enemy team where you are then what?
---
Back when the game first came out, in like February of 2016, shortly after its launch, the playerbase was thin and no one talked about the game. Around this time Badger and other YTbers started making jokes and memes about the game, and the community began to crate their own. 
---
Pitbull being Pulse, Lord Tachanka. All of these came from this era and it brought attention to the game, which then survived on gameplay from that point on
---
I can relate to that

Hello DaCrazMon, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e6k0i3/internet_connection_dropped_out_in_a_ranked_game/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Differently to how they did previously.
---
How about make "ALL" chat opt-in instead of the current opt-out?
---
 Because:
---
1.  I get more toxic chat from team members than from the other team. So this isn't going to stop that problem.
---
2. Coming from a console player to a PC player, ALL chat brings another level of community. I feel like I'm playing with people in PC... 
---
3. I honestly believe there is a large percentage reports are not genuine. As in the player that is reporting toxic behavior isn't offended NOR do they care if other players are offended, they merely want the other player to get a ban.
---
this is the modern approach to player interactions.
---
.0001% of players are being dicks? let's just remove the features that let people talk to eachother. 
---
just another stupid and lazy fix that will suck more soul out of the game.
---
So cool
---
Wouldn't a better function be for all chat to be disable at the start and has to be manually turned on through settings? 
---
Other games do this and it works well for them. Alot of people are toxic but removing all chat is not a way to combat it.
---
Wargaming did this to World of Tanks a few years ago and it completely changed the vibe of the game, and lost some appeal in the process. Talking to the enemy team is a quintessential part of the experience of any game, and they'd be stupid to remove it. That being said, it wont happen cause from what I've seen on just the twitter post theres a 95-5 split of people against-for it
---
_It‚Äôs a hard-knock life_
---
Ah, ok
---
Where‚Äôd you get that gold skin for the mp7
---
I know it‚Äôs casual and all, but I hate HATE when ppl say ‚Äúbro stfu it‚Äôs casual‚Äù when I give a call out
---
Nah
---
I did the Outback glitch once and it was funny
---
According to others, as I haven't tested myself; It's still apparently in range of Thatcher's EMP unfortunately. Thatcher stronk
---
this is legit 100th post of this
---
I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs still some subdued options for guns out here. A lot of the new skins are getting too flashy or bright for me.
---
Ah, my bad
---
***H O T***

We already got the rainbow is magic stuff for him I think we are good
---

---
This is FAKE.
---
Kid, stop trying to fearmonger people. You can't even fake this right.
---
i love that strat
---
I get reported when I do this
---
bet they wont use Wamai much
---
All I can think of now is that time I 5 man spawnpeeked w/recruit
---
i wanna see it colored
---
The console players won't feel a thing
---
I love how free it is to speak in cod mw chat, because even if I am pissed and someone insults me, I get absolutely mad, and can talk him back, but it doesn't give you this fake feeling of "safe space"
---
The bosg has horrible damage drop off, its useless for peaking
---
it's a heavy handed approach to something that's barely an issue.
---
you already have the option to hide allchat. the tools are at your disposal to let you moderate your experience.
---
this change is total nonsense
---
Thats pretty LIDL. Cannot be official.
---
Yup. December is here, I've got the Sleigh Ride from 2017 and Gingerbread from 2018 on all my weapons now
---
There‚Äôs already an option to turn it off....... what about knife fight only!?
---
Bruh, Sledge with a tec-9 is disturbing
---
These look amazing, are they actually functional for just aesthetic?
---
Nope. 
---
As long as the EMP is at ground level of the reinforcement, it is impossible for Kaid‚Äôs Electroclaws to evade the height of EMPO blast.
---
Sorry for my earlier comment. I'm just now getting it
---
Also worth mentioning, you can do the trick of putting the claw _in_ the floor, (think balcony-side lockers room on border) and the Kali breach doesn't destroy it.  
---
I think Kali destroys only stuff that's directly touching the wall.
---
Ubisoft can publish whatever they want just because it‚Äôs leaked doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs gonna get released
---
Missing braincells
---
They take a flat 60.
---
Or the n word.
---
Wait, I thought they did though? Or did it bug out and come back.
---
Still, their ranked reconnect system and shit is seriously broke and really needs attention. I get that there are other minor inconveniences, but at least every second game has a disconnect on one of the teams, and it's honestly just complete bullshit that makes the ranked system feel more like RNG of whoever disconnects.
---
Nice gut gutter skin for the shotgun
---
Sooo true me and my friend joining a rank match I say hello guys and no one talk when the match ended and we lost one m8 in chat say thx for no callouts srs only 2 ppl me and my friend was talking in vc and no one else
---
this looks nice
---
Im expecting a montage in a month or 2
---
Yeah. Next time eat a salad pal.
---
HOW
---
***D O W N V O T E***
---
Again, I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you. Ubisoft has said themselves that Ela was getting banned in high ranks on console and that most of the console community has cried out for this shotgun to be nerfed. I trust Ubisoft a helluva lot more than some random Ela main on reddit. Yes, her SMG sucks, but the shotgun is fine. It‚Äôs still fine! It‚Äôs not the worst shotgun. Stop being overdramatic.
---
More is needed
---
Goyo looks like josheth stalin
---
alibi prolly trying to be a clone
---
Bummer
---
First game we lost because our two Randos liked spawn peeking and died every round to it leaving us in a 3v5. We nearly took them to match point but just ran out of time due to a airjab near defuser. Our Randos were hogging Jager and Wamai... If we took them to matchpoint we probably could have won. Second game we wrecked a team on Kafe.
---
miss the good ol days of art storage
---
Thank you! They're not a functional camera, sadly.
---
That is a massive oversight we should still ask you if it was intentional and if it was give you the opportunity to keep it activated because that's just unfair that I essentially played the entire game at 20HP and missed every call set up phase
---
hey, at least you didnt die to it getting sucked in by MAGNET
---
Literally couldnt have said it any better.
---
There is no point in wasting any time into something which would be ignored and not liked anyway. I am not here to convince anyone I am just frustrated how idiotic developers are and this is my went to vent if someone agrees it won't hurt
---
I do not know, we were chatting and the next time I see him he got himself there
---
These look amazing. Now make elite skins and charge $15 a piece for each.
---
*THE TRUTH HURTS DOESN'T IT*
---
Wtf no don‚Äôt do that.  It‚Äôs fun to talk to people on the other team.  Especially in casual.  No more agreed knife fights :/
---
DELETE THIS
---
Well that would mean the police would no longer have to "police" that highway. Similarly, now ubisoft doesn't have to police all chat. Basically, this "solution" (lol) is just so they have less stuff to worry about.
---
There are so many better ways to handle this, but all of those ways would require at least a *little* effort on ubisoft's end, so we get this..
---
Omg that makes so much more sense. I didn't get the point of her ability
---
Lmaaaao whyy
---
Like what you said but I think maybe revive or dbno should be contingent on 3 speed rush operators and then revive on 2 speed and so on maybe?
---
no..... nooo.... **NOOOOOO**
---
I hope that guy left and never started up that game ever again. How can you possibly be such a douche and then get denied like that!?
---
Nope, he would be mad because it wasn't his idea
---
December of 2015, but still, game I believe on either the 13th or 16th is 4 years old. Also #Fragmite
---
can't hurt if its not the truth ;)
---
There's no way they go through with this shit, it completely goes against what this community is for and there are already plenty of options to mute people if you want to, but instead they're gonna try to force onto everyone? Whoever came up with this must be the same person that came up with New Hereford.
---
it's a visual thing and ur ping even go higher with VPN. Btw u not get banned for this, but maybe battleye can kick u from match.
---
How about we delete any chat or VC in the game and pretend that everyone else is a bit because little marshmallows like to cry a lot.
---
That skin on the sniper looks great

5 DOCS =ƒ∞MORTALƒ∞TY
---
...you read Ubi's post right? They LITERALLY explained why. You got mad at the change without hearing them out?
---
1. Ubisoft wants to combat toxicity. One can assume "combat toxicity" means "LESS TOXICITY REPORTS".
---
2. Ubisoft says, despite the tools already in place, 85% of Abusive Chat reports come from All chat.
---
3. One can then assume that the removal of all chat will remove 85% of Abusive Chat reports.
---
Let me break this down further:
---
If Ubisoft finds a way to eliminate 85% of abusive chat reports...that means only 15% is left!
---
If 85% of one toxicity type suddenly disappears, one MIGHT say that this = less toxicity reports. And, if you really want to get WILD, you could say that this = fighting toxicity.
---
My hope is that they would disable enemy chat as an option that is toggle able and just make it default so you have to switch it on if you actually want it.
---
Or maybe I expected better from you? I see now that I gotta set that bar even lower next time. Good luck with everything, hopefully you can do better in the future ;)
---
Lmao!!!
---
Ok. Use at your own risk and if u do get banned you can appeal it if it isn‚Äôt in terms of use

They should put a mode for fun where a character can be picked as many times by one team. Imagine the Lion times 5.
---
Let's hope
---
Just like they apparently fail to see a reason to keep a feature that‚Äôs been in multiplayer videogames since the dawn of time, I fail to see a reason to cut it off altogether when measures to combat toxicity exist.
---
Give people more tools. Don‚Äôt take them away.
---
true ig
---
My roommates would have made this shit up lol
---
I'm sorry but if you get offended by 'GG ez' you shouldnt be playing online multiplayer games. If toxicity is really a problem for you then there are mute buttons for all players on the server, along with the option in settings to completely turn off chat altogether.
---
Valkyrie is my main and just play a lot and learn good cam spots. Crosshair placement is really important cause the MPX doesn‚Äôt have the best of specs

Me and my friend would spend hours on the zombies mode, we beat all the maps so many times it became muscle memory.
---
Highly recommend going through the situations and then playing lonewolf T-hunt so you can get a feel for the different weapons and sound cues. Then maybe doing a couple T-hunt matches with squad search, and then joining newcomers playlist when you feel more confident you can at least hit something.
---
You‚Äôre hitting limbs if the gun isn‚Äôt downing enemies.

---
Knife only rounds is no more *cries*
---
All chat hasnt been in multiplayer games since the dawn of time my dude, and I can safely say that as someone who has been playing online multiplayer for over 15 years. There were games even in this decade that didnt have it.
---
Yeah they said she was getting banned. Yet they've shown no proof like they do on pc. Most of the console community has not cried for this. You need proof for that pal. Neither you nor ubisoft have provided any. I'm not being dramatic either. It is one of the worst shotguns now. It has an even larger spread than it slready did,  and does even less damage. Its mediocte at best and ela will be close to dead now
---
You're a legend.
---
It starts off really tough,  but always try to control the recoil by looking down while shooting, when you first start I suggest kapkan, he has a decen gun with low recoil and a good gadget

It ain‚Äôt
---
I play way more games where teams say ‚Äúgg‚Äù in a nice way than ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù or some other insult or nothing at all. I‚Äôve also had quite a few times where something crazy happens between me and an enemy in a round and we use all chat to joke about it. 
---
I‚Äôve friended people and teamed up because of talking in all chat. 
---
I‚Äôve had some hilarious conversations with both teams together in all chat. 
---
It‚Äôs about an 85/15 split. 15% toxic chat out of all rounds I play. 
---
And last but not least‚Äî‚Äî we already have a chat mute button. This solution Ubi is implementing isn‚Äôt a fix, it‚Äôs censoring. What they need to do is have a feature in the options menu that disables all chat for whoever wants it disabled. 
---
Honestly, the most obnoxious part of all chat for me is when I‚Äôm playing a ranked game and trying to focus on an intense moment and people from either side are writing in all chat.   
---
I‚Äôm also plat 3 with my squad all being plat 2, and even at that level of play, it‚Äôs about this same consistency. You would think more skilled players would be more toxic/sweaty as the stereotype goes, but not so.
---
There's a HUGE learning curve in the game so take your time.
---
Ya same I really feel insecure about my skills in games and don‚Äôt use a mic because of it a lot

You can completely get rid of text chat in the options.

It feels insulting to have things ruined by players who had their feelings hurt and apparently can‚Äôt grasp the concept of manual chat disabling. As a female, I *sometimes* get nasty comments (from my team, not all chat, mind you). Do I cry to Ubi to remove the feature entirely? No, I mute, report and move on.

People who claim this is a good thing seem like kids back in school who had to remind teachers that they forgot to give everyone homework. Nobody likes them.

I mean if you have played with hackers, they come in all different shapes and sizes. Some have walls or aim track. These aren't that obvious unless you look at the kill cam.
---
xD.
---
I was talking about all chat. I agree with everything but getting rid of report ‚Äútoxic chat‚Äù because they should still get reprimanded.  And yea they should pay attention to the hackers and only make the people in the squad of the hacker lose MMR not the entire team.

---
&gt; Okay so ubisoft has provided no data to back their claims. Whilst i have provided data that comes from their own website, the wiki,  and ingame. So my data in reality is 100% better.
---
Uh no? Ubisoft literally said themselves that Ela is banned in high ranks, what do you need a fucken chart? Your data means nothing because it clearly didn‚Äôt stop Ela‚Äôs shotgun form being called busted, which it is. Sorry your judgement is clouded because your poor little main still has a busted gun. The MP5 is, stats wise, not a remarkable gun at all. In fact, stats wise, it‚Äôs worse than the FMG, but it‚Äôs still one of the best SMG‚Äôs in the game. So no, your stats don‚Äôt mean anything. 
---
&gt; Again 35 damage per pellet is the 3rd lowest of all shotguns. Combined with the wide spread you're doing pitiful damage to anything past 10m. Which every other shotgun doesn't have to worry about as they have tighter spreads. Yes the fo12 is spammable. That's how they balance it to bring it up to parr with the other shothuns. Again if it shot slow it'd be the worst shotgun in game.
---
DAMAGE DOES NOT MEAN SHIT, IT IS ABOUT DPS. I don‚Äôt know how many times I need to say it for you to get it. The spread is not even that wide. If it *did* have wide spread, it could be fixed by using a laser and aiming down sights. I‚Äôve been playing with the FO-12 recently and it still has really good range. 
---
&gt; About that ember rise chart. You fail to think that the chart only shows pc plat and above. That's not including the 60 to.70% of the entire siege community that plays console. And also doesn't include the majority of the pc platform. Siege has about 30million active players that aren't rebought copies. Those charts possibly only represent less than or close to 5% of the siege playerbase. I'm not ever going to use that as proof as to why to buff or nerf a character.
---
The point about bringing up the chart was to tell you that Ela is not close to dead like you say she is, not wether or not she needs a buff or nerf. Her pick and win rate is fine as is and if Ubi saw any sort of issue with it on console or PC they‚Äôd buff her, but she‚Äôs fine. 
---
&gt; Again you seem to forget this. Ubi does have access to the data. We don't. They've provided no proof whatsoever. Until they do everything they've said is a lie. Don't believe people that have no proof of what they say.
---
You are actually brain dead. Just because they don‚Äôt show us the data doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a lie. Again, what do they have to gain from lying? Nothing. And again, I trust them more than you. 
---
&gt; On console ela is one of the most dead operators. Everyone I've talked to doesn't even see her in places like casual, most certainly not in ranked where she serves no purpose. Her scorpion is the worst gun in game. Her pistol is weak. Secondary gadgets useless most of the time. Mines are lackluster. Now that her shotgun is at best mediocre she has not one reason to be played. Your personal opinion does not dictate whether or not a character is entirely destroyed because you get to close to a shotgun and think it's unfair.
---
This is dumb. I see her all the time in casual, the console streamers and youtubers i watch see her played a lot. But that‚Äôs only a few people‚Äôs perspective huh? Well so is yours. You may never see Ela played, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs never played at all. The people you talked to may never see her played, but that doesn‚Äôt mean their experience is everyone‚Äôs experience. Until Ubisoft shows us the pick rate of Ela on all platforms at all ranks all we have to go on is our experience. Your experience is not everyone‚Äôs, my experience is not everyone‚Äôs. That is fact.

In my experience almost nobody uses chat there for some reason.
---
i think this is related to the rare bug where deployed gadgets only function after being triggered if the player that deployed it gets close to it. same thing happens in those clips where a defender throws a C4, calls it, it doesn't explode, when they hit nitro key again it says they don't have any left, and when they go pick it up it blows up
---
Depends on what you are looking for, console has what I believe to be a unique experience with its own meta while pc has better graphics and all that so if you want the weird shit that comes with console then don‚Äôt play pc. Also chat wise console is less toxic due to how time consuming it is to send one person a sentence of trash talk. However if we are talking gameplay toxicity it is definitely more toxic than pc.
---
Yeah depends on your play style man. Haven't had too much experience with Wamai yet, obvs a Jager alt. but plays quite differently.

I am not sure. Need testing

thats actually surprising

of course

yes

Take a selfie and post it right now.
---
but they are also lvl 200+ that are still complete trash, and there can be a lvl 40 which is already way better, and there are smurfs, so idk if that would help that much
---
If ADHD was represented as a charm..hectic but awesome!
---
bruh
---
im about 95% sure.
---
Just cause you ADS I think you should be able to hit 1/3 of a mile away. Unlike them knob heads who only hipfire.
---
I mean, if someone gets caught by the word filter saying the N word then they deserve a 24 hour ban or whatever.
---
If someone says 'gg ez' in chat, there is no need for a toxic player report. It's such a stupid thing to report and a huge waste of everyone's time. The devs could even just blacklist that phrase and most of the toxicity would be eliminated.
---
There might be some people who try to work around the bad word filter and maybe that report feature would be good for them, but for everything else it's a waste of the dev's time. Players don't need to be handled with kid gloves, we already can mute players and disable chat.
---
Yeah thanks bro üòâ
---
It‚Äôs dumb anyway.
---
The guy with the name "Moist" would say "Preach"
---
All it needs is another mag in reserve as in game it only has three while most others have 4 or more. This is all I think it needs
---
No, it doesnt make perfect sense, its absolute nonsense. 
---
You play the same amount on both sides. Its literally impossible for one side to have an advantage no matter what map you are on or how the rounds are split up as long as you play the same amount on both sides. That is just very very basic logic.
---
I mean, this is like saying 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 is different than 1+1.
---
Don't be so rude about his aim, console aiming is way different than PC aiming.
---
Do we know about the P10 Roni one?

I did end up clutching but it just wasn't interesting for a clip :D

Believe so

You also need someone to start screaming/incessantly.

I'm level 267, playing since before alpha packs. Have more black ice than I could want and a good chunk of legendaries, but the first alpha packs were traaash
---
It was pretty bad honestly lol but I feel like you were intentionally aiming like shit
---
H O T
---
Now I can't unsee it when the game starts....... Thx
---
There‚Äôs like 1 peek in the entire game that‚Äôs an instant kill (which I never use). The vast majority of peeks are after attackers have run out of spawn.  It‚Äôs not cheap either, it‚Äôs super easy to counter if you‚Äôre moderately careful.  People are just lazy and/or bad so they complain about it.
---
Yup definitely back
---
Not with that attitude
---
That an RTJ reference?

When did this happen? I still use global chat in CSGO

---
Ok, go on T-hunt (I'm on PC, I'm sorry, can't help you), and try with just a pistol to one tap and stick always forward. Learn to crouch when you see an enemy, and viceversa. Btw, have you tried to get a 4 man stack?
---
I‚Äôm playing ps4
---
On all the maps in this game, you think there's only 1 peek in the entire game that you can look at someone's spawns?? Lmfao I'm not falling for some bronze level trolling.
---
Your use of "sheep" is almost as shallow as you must seem at parties.
---
Bug fixes and operator reworks are now the same thing and just as easy to enact apparently.
---
As far as I can tell this is casual
---
I'm sorry. Forgive my pre pubescent self.

Ps4

Honestly I think he may mnk, the little message on the left is from a PS4, the mouse is on and he may have tried to "hide it".
---
Uuuhhhh... Sledge? I think ya got the wrong gun.

It is irrelevant who can handle what.

Is it toxic/can it be considered toxic or not?

Okay, my name on Ps4 is Play Station (I know the creativity).

Hello BeatProz, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e6nlrm/lfg_xbox/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Yes but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about saying the n word or other really toxic things and I agree that they should blacklist certain phrases
---
Just go into t hunt lone wolf and try to clear it as fast as possible. I recommend as fast as possible (for example rushing) cause that way you improve reaction time, aim and flicks. Evrybody can clear t hunt by taking their time. I recommend doing terrorist hunt classic over bomb or hostage. I would do hard difficulty and then move on to realistic if possible. I wouldnt do normal cause it is way too easy. I usually do only house map, but if you are lacking map knowledge you can try doing other maps and learning them while improving aim and other skills. In addition, try to learn about peekers advantage and once you learn how to take advantage of it, I am sure you will be much better. The game is fun once you learn to play it, trust me.
---
TL;DR - do t hunt lone wolf, learn about the maps, and learn about peekers advantage. Game is fun, give it more time.
---
I won a round becouse of this bugg.
---
Yes, it's cool to take out an oblivious kaid that has no other goal than removing and replacing the claws
---
Took the words right out of my mouth! Take this gold too!
---
Next next next next update: cannot die
---
Where‚Äôs my tactical soccer dad, I‚Äôm having a hard time
---
Op said it was ranked 
---
If it was casual also there would be a kick promp as soon as he did that
---
Funny because it‚Äôs relatable
---
Suuuuuuuuuuurrrree
---
If you don't have some common-sense guidelines then you just force well-behaved people to permamute because of toxic shitters that can't act right.
---
Removing all chat is too far though.

Hello Carlsbef, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/e6nn7w/is_this_a_bug/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
&gt;The person you are replying does not condone abusive chat
---
If anyone expects players to endure toxicity 'like a rational adult' but does not expect handling your emotions and not being toxic to begin with, does he really not condone being toxic?
---
All I‚Äôm saying is there‚Äôs a reason you don‚Äôt work at Ubisoft.
---
I'd say people being toxic in chat is one of the few things a regular support person is able to do. It's not like they are losing labour on it, but I agree with you that it should be still on there. If someone has is constantly flaming or trying to trigger the other team they probably shouldn't be able to communicate with the opposing team. If they keep pushing they should get bans.
---
It shouldn't be on the "victim" to correct things every few games, the players doing this just need to be shown their behaviour isn't okay and perhaps we will all have a nicer experience. 
---
I also want to point out that I have only ever reported one person for toxic chat and they were bypassing the chat filter.
---
I would say it's bad. This game has and always will have a very toxic community. Taking away features doesn't fix this
---
R u kidding? You‚Äôre clearly hacking, everyone report this guy for aim bot smfh
---
Cool thx for the reply. My first meme btw, lol.
---
Don‚Äôt take it to school
---
Gonna take 30 minutes to update sense I havent played on ps4 in a while.
---
Am I wrong? üòÇ
---
Happens at the beginning of the season. Cheaters getting what they deserve. :)
---
The shotguns great I live it and if I can't use it then I use her pistol. With a trigger finger it's a way better sub machine gun than herprimary is
---
Well, in what way, but either way, i am in
---
Not just any defender....Kapkan himself!!!
---
Ah ok everyone was just pure confused
---
Practice and good habits will get you to this level
---
You can just quit when you get a map you dont like and try again (i had a friend who disliked tower and just quitted everytime). Waiting time is very fast for casual. They should just leave all maps on casual.
---
What about the people who just type "gg" or "ggs all" or "gg wp". They are getting punished aswell for the actions of others.
---
They‚Äôve already gone back on it chill out.
---
He was at the edge of the lasers and move away, so he probably evaded most if not all of the damage. Claymores have a delay so there aren't any/to many broken positions from a gameplay perspective everything worked fine. Also 20% damge reduction due to rook armor.
---
I‚Äôm literally only play to warm up cut me some slack man :(
---
Ah shit, I totally meant that!!! Still looks awesome.
---
Nah.
---
Yeah or that explanation. It could be either or. You can‚Äôt really tell which scenario it was. 
---
Refer to my additional comment to OPs comment.
---
Same, I remember me and my friend got to like round 75 on gas station after like 6 hours of grinding and we were bragging about that to our friends for weeks.

Smonk because smonk

Just start a console war for the laughs. It's pretty funny.
---
Don't worry about the downvotes. They hated jesus christ for telling the truth too.
---
that mozzie‚Äôs game sense lmao
---
Just mute the other teams text chat lol
---
Just have all player on opposite team chat muted by default. Then you can turn it on if you want to. And make it a setting.
---
Its 5

thank you bikini this was needed.

You said she should get breaches silly

I won‚Äôt be able to say gn, won‚Äôt be able to knife fight, or won‚Äôt be able to ask the team questions

I like it on a defender basis, but with Attackers, it seems the same every single attack.

As an ex fuze main, we have much more to us than meets the eye. We like to kill the hostage, and our enemies! With the small help of king george, we can win every match we get in
---
This has happened to a lot of people. Just play casual for the time being
---
Yes but lower rank players on pc are more skilled than lower rank console players
---
What is headglitching?
---
I'm not personally bothered by the name change even though I find it silly but I am more upset over the fact that they changed the Casual round rotation to AA/DD rather than A/D/A/D and I hope they will switch it back.
---
No offense but stop posting these. Just understand that kaid‚Äôs gadget has a proximity.
---
5 cams? Nice :3

Bruh no need to downvote it was joking

Could that have something to do more with the siege infection game their working on?

seriously if you get offended by someone calling you names over the internet you are clearly to young to play such a brutal game
---
Toxic keyboard warriors were some of the best things in game and i had so many nice conversation over the chat like common toxicity is the least of zour games problems
---
Whyyyyyy. Oregon is their best map imo. And we get Tower??? Ubi plz
---
Yeah that's a issue with a lot of things that become massively popular that they forget there roots and they become stagnant until they are replaced or are pressured to go back to there roots in my opinion.
---
Lol we weren't trying to to play objectives and just kill each other so we wanted to play one where you can go on site without it triggering something
---
These are my favorite :)
---
YOOOOO
---
Fuck me, you're good
---
Oh ok I get you. Didnt think of that
---
I‚Äôm always diamond so I tend to play with the more scummy of individuals on console. I have two friends who play MnK (one was top 20 in champion last season) but I avoid playing with them now due to guilt by association and if they are in a party I join then I won‚Äôt refrain from telling them to go to PC where they won‚Äôt measure up to those who actually are better. I guess I could just run AimLabs and T-Hunt for thousands of hours like I did on console to get better. 
---
As for the confidence aspect, that typically isn‚Äôt an issue for me because I play with good players and if they start to throw then I will solo que and find other players who take the game somewhat seriously. It does take its toll on you being a competitive player in a toxic environment though. 
---
 Hopefully I can start building my PC soon. Might update this post once I do so everyone can know how the process goes. Thank you for replying and helping!

Hehe. Was gonna put rust on the list but i haven‚Äôt played that much of it. Ive only been raided like twice and only played x5 servers.

Dang I‚Äôm bout to make everyone jealous with the ugly peacock skin lol
---
I was gonna plant the defuser, but then I got high.
---
Well it's in my top 3. I also only have 3games
---
Because certain character skins blend in very well with parts of maps
---
EX: Mira elite in red hall basement of bank, or doc elite next to anything blue
---
:thinking:
---
What is in first place?
---
I'm loving this update, It's so fun It just keeps crashing non stop when trying to connect to the servers.
---
ForHonor, than R6
---
Because Tactical skins are better than shitty Fortnite cosmetics, change my mind
---
Ah... I get it. I guess I could see how that would be a problem for people who play it competitively.
---
Its a nice skin but not legendary. More like uncommon
---
Oof. I really don‚Äôt like for honor tbh. I get why you find it ragey though. I just never got annoyed because i was never into it.
---
I haven't played on PC in a while because mine got fried however I always loved cross chat. It was my favourite part of playing on PC vs Console. I mean sure, make it toggleable but don't outright remove it from everyone even if it's only for part of the game
---
imo more options &gt; less options
---
No, Ubisoft had no goals for long term. Seems to be the problem with a lot of games with micro transactions/ in game purchases. It‚Äôs short term money. They don‚Äôt last for years and years. Look at Fifa
---
So many kids play this game. I‚Äôd say the average age of people I play with are 15, however it could be less as I‚Äôm only sampling people who have mics.
---
I was actually done with the plane shoot after the 5th post in a row?
---
GG
---
Oh, my second guess was cav‚Äôs ass in pink leggings
---
I'd guess the reason all chat is more toxic/gets more reports is because people who want to be toxic to their teammates will use voice chat, not because talking to the other team is somehow inherently toxic. Anyways I'm gonna start spamming the report button for my teammate's text chat so that ubi doesn't put this in the live game.
---
Thanks, you can keep scrolling now. I‚Äôll see you in the Sixth.

For how much please
