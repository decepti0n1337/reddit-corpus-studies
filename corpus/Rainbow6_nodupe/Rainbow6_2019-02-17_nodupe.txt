At 2:20 he is hammering a screw...

---
I think we should get those as a headgear and uniform. Be nice to see more no mask thatcher without having the elite. We have the si one but I want more 
---

---
See I pulled a sneaky one on ya

"If there's one thing I know for sure, it's that a punch to the face never loses reception"

Rated M for mature means the company / publisher cannot take responsibility.. Basically it's an Anti-Sue measure against parents who don't like violence.  
---
Officially it's just a recommendation, so anyone can buy it.
---
I never knew I wanted this until now 
---
As an Australian with Greek heritage it would be so sweet to get them both in the game this year, maybe asking for too much though haha.
---
but 120 is better than 75
---
I asked the same thing and lost 100 something karma lol
---
What downed you?  2 shot from that range scares me
---
Maybe I'm dumb but why do they stay in cages?
---
tOmMoRo!!!
---
How did you get so high up tower? Drone?
---
Foreign legion?
---
no
---
Imagine a scene like in black ops 2 where you shoot a ‘target’ with a mask on his head and then it turns out to be fucking thermite or some other operator from rainbow
---
Or for example two ops are abducted by the enemy forces, BUT you can only save one (depending on your choices)
---
That would make some really fucking powerful scenes
---
Minus a few weird and awkward parts, it was pretty darn fun to watch
---
Pretty sure it’s illegal for anyone under 18 to buy a rated M game.
---
May I suggest another?
---
ClashBanditkute
---
Clash+Bandit+Kaid+Mute
---
I kinda wish it was marked as a spoiler. I love keeping the faces of operators a mystery. Up until elite sets obviously 
---
Looks like they changed their handle in the last two weeks.
---
We need more scruffy fisherman
---
Again, how does that make him not canon? He is canon now.
---
Rainbow Harry sounds like a prominent member of the bear community in San Francisco 
---
I'll have you know that they got the colours of the English flag wrong.
---
Not really, we're probably getting some Danes.
---
Looks like we need a new sub. Who's down for moderating /r/RainbowHarry
---
Not angry just really fucking dissapointed in this game.
---
Fine.
---
&gt;Tachanka's sense of humor, Ash's strong leadership, Doc's reason to be a doctor; to save, Thermite's fascination with explosives, etc.  
---
* A dude with a sense of humour?
---
* A woman with leadership qualities?
---
* A doctor wanting to save lives?
---
* A dude who specialises in blowing shit up... Likes blowing shit up?
---
How fucking groundbreaking, oh yeah, Chimera brought sooooooooooooo much character, I really know the characters now having watched it. 
---
&gt;  Dokkaebi likes to whine, and Thatcher "faces" his demons by betting up people who his brother owes. 
---
* Dokkaebi feels horribly undervalued and underappreciated, also likes to whine.
---
* Thatcher is defensive and protective. Also very harsh and blunt.
---
How fucking groundbreaking. I reaaaally feel like I... Wait... I've already done this speel. It's almost like neither cinematics give you a deep understanding of the characters that you claim Chimera gave huh?
---
As for the Bartlett one. All that really tells you is:
---
* White masks = bad
---
* CTU = good.
---
So really I'm 3 for 3 in ruing every cinematics so-called "character development".
---
It's not exactly a difficult task when you actively try. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's a fun cinematic... They all show a little bit of character but in reality, it's not much from either. Frankly, I don't see why that's a bad thing. If you're playing R6S for the character, I think you're in the wrong place my guy.
---
I rewatched it and im now 99% sure it is valks basic helmet. If you need to watch after the fight scene and you get a little closer look
---
Plus the explosives sign in Japanese on the locker door.
---
Yes.
---
I love this! Please more Ubi! After playing as these characters for 3 years I've grown way too attached and would love some more characterization for all of them. I really hope Ubi releases more ❤
---
An M-rated game is like an R-rated movie: there's no law requiring minors be forbidden to buy a copy/ticket—and in fact laws of this sort have been struck down as unconstitutional—but game stores/movie theaters voluntarily prevent minors from purchasing material meant for adults, since parents might boycott their businesses otherwise, or find creative ways to regulate them anyway.
---
Because it's not actually illegal, businesses can make exceptions to their policies if they want. For instance, when a controversial documentary about Edward Snowden was given an R rating, some theaters allowed teenagers to buy tickets anyway:
---
Copy-Pasted from LegalAdvice.
---
Nice
---
Wait ... Thatcher didn't check his corner lol ...
---
What if there is a guy camping behind the door lol
---
Someone else here mentioned its probably Hibana's bow for kyudo
---
gonna go full sicko mode and say nah
---
kill me
---
I say whole team
---
I would a Nora rengo op. They might be my new favorite team after what I saw at the invitational. 
---
An ace is 5 kills. If it's anything else it's a 4K, 3K, 2K or just a frag.
---
/r/lastimages/
---
Which video were you watching? None of that is right 
---
When I saw "The Hammer" I automatically assumed it would be about the guy with the hammer.
---
People also say house is on Los Angeles and bank is disputed because you can’t really know. The plane could be anywhere really. 
---
5 kills on the opposite team. A 4K and a team kill doesn’t count
---
I couldn’t agree more
---
This makes me want a story/campaign even more.
---
It wasn't meant to be at all and was never designed that way until ubisoft's wallets dried up and decided to make it Rainbow Colour Dash Six: Siege
---
Invest in headphones. Otherwise good job
---
IDK, they look different. The one in the picture definitely looks like a nail. I for one choose to believe he's hammering a screw. Because it's funnier and life is more fun that way. 
---
They will tomorrow 
---
I never understood these stupid charm events. I literally had the stream on the whole during the paris event I only got Gold. SOme of my favorite charms in the game. I wish they literally sold them. I get fucking shafted because twitches stupid all detection system. I had the stream up the whole time for the brazil one and I only got Silver. I can't wait seeing as I've watched every second of being up and have literally none of the fucking charms. I wish we could just buy them or anything. I don't want to watch this event. 
---
the whole enemy team 5 kills
---
I'd love that but I think it's because unlike G2 and EG they aren't mainstream and are only an APAC team.
---
I used my drone!
---
Yeah but Dokkaebi when she was in that outfit with Harry (Six) she was hella cute 
---
[excitedibillis]
---
Man this makes me want an actual Rainbow Six Single Player Campaign
---
This is way better than the one they had for clash! That one looked like a mobile app lol.

Ace = 5 enemy kills by 1 operator in 1 round. 
---
...If you kill 5 people... You killed the whole enemy team anyways. Guess I don't get the question. 
---
This was so fucking cool
---
Most definitely. Can't say I noticed any awkward moments, if you mean when pengu got emotional? Then im glad that happened, we may be adults but men should be allowed to share their feelings in any way they wish and I respect him a lot more now than I did to be quite honest!
---
So how does he know there will probably be danish and greek ops?
---
I got into FPS's cuz my dad played that all the time when I was a kid. I was never allowed to play because "it was too violent", but I'm fairly certain he just didn't want me to fuck up his K/D.
---
That’s what I thought was the teaser.
---
Yes, yes, and yes again
---
I hope Ubisoft and Netflix get together and do an animated Tom Clancy series, I would watch it. 
---
Jeez take a break mate and relax this is for entertainment 
---
What is this sjw bullshit on this sub? Not everyone knows the name buddy, there is nothing wrong about mentioning the race of a person in this context because we need to remember who the subject is and their race is a good example
---
Hold lean/crouch can do this without a macro. The main issue is the animation is completed fully severside but not for the monty's client. This means for you he leans instantly left/right like the old lean animation cancel aka beaulo peek however for him will barely even look like he is leaning especially if he is using a macro

It just happened to me like 39 minutes ago my valk cam got hit with an EMP and it only got disabled so I know those do. And I know when alibi got released her decoys only got disabled by EMP’s, unless they changed it they should still only get disabled

Lesion and Yung are already from China
---
That's a fair argument, thank you for stating reasonable reasons for why it won't happen that's not "war criminals"
---
It’s older Zuckles confirmed

Ha! Fitting joke for the next operation! 
---
What do you want? A gold star pinned to their chest?
---
Thatcher opened a door.  0/10 realism b
---
I like how people don’t get the reference.
---
who's harry?

me lol

I bet it was Blur. They’ve done the operator videos too and so many other amazing cinematics.
---
literally are the best special forces on the planet. no joke, make seals look like grunts , and like every single armed forces copies them/ their methods and tactics 
---
I want dedicated Mossad ops, it's not too hard to understand pal.

If I am not mistaken they are from South Korea
---
Yasssssss
---
Yeah this is fucking impossible
---
Huh. I don't play Val all that often, so maybe I just happened to not check my cameras in the time after they came back. But I'm dead certain on Alibi decoys. I may start adding on clips to demonstrating stuff I've either had to go back and prove right, or if people have corrected me and I wanna show that on top of editing the text.
---
Because he commited numerous war crimes.
---
It’s hard to add operators from non existent country. 
---
thanks a lot!
---
It does be like that
---
Chinese...
---
Seriously go somewhere else if you want to get political
---
Funnily enough the lack of support and acknowledgement of issues is why I'm considering *not* getting another year pass. The game is getting stagnant, encouraging people to become toxic out of boredom. Halloween house mode was good. It was fun, &amp; more alternative modes need to be explored. SI mode is/ was a toxic mess IMO. Super sweats, major TK's and people staying just long enough to do the challenges, then leaving the match. 
---
Dokkaebi is best r6 girl
---
Margaret Thatcher. 
---
His elite set skin is also called Maggie's Resolve
---
The lady in the original intro and situations, I believe
---
Y1 ops are cheap tho, instead of 25k they are 15k. They are gonna do that with the y2 ops
---
Such a good game
---
It was 15 headshots, play an adult game act like one. Begging for free kills I tk you myself. Fucking pathetic. 
---
It's from the livestream earlier today, between the 2 semifinals. Something about behind the scenes
---
I also wonderd if that was to be joined with the turkish/greece pictures next to it, or if it's an face reveal of an already known operator.
---
Dokk is a stated prodigy, and he is a military psychologist who likely got recruited super early for the program by the original Six before he got bogged down in other....*things* officers of that nature tend to get bogged down in.
---
ugh it’s just constantly saying installation still in progress
---
My moneys on hibana tbh, it would be badass what they could do given her Japanese background. But guys imagine a Monty elite?!
---
Always been toxic. Any competitive game is going to have a lot of toxicity 
---
Isn’t that a girl
---
Tbh like just her personality just reeks of someone in my mid twenties 
---
Why would they skip two years forward?
---
I think you can argue that T-Hunt is both also SOMETIMES a simulation, but you could consider some of it "canon" too, I guess. It can go either way, it's fine in both cases.
---
Also, I think we're supposed to assume that they ARE saving the world, just off-screen. You can say that that's not good enough, sure, i'm not disagreeing. Just stating I think that's meant to be the implication. I don't think we're to assume they've done nothing but train for 3 years.
---
QE-C-QE-C-QE Freaking Noob Style Plays...
---
Yea maybe im only missing capitao from y1 anyway but hopefully y2s are reduced to a similair price. It would be good if y1s were 12.5k and y2s 15k but that might be very hopeful thinking
---
Yeah. He doesn't look like a Field Commander like Ding, or a professional administrator like our previous Six
---
Travelling the world will do that to you, especially in you spend a lot of time around different accents.
---
Tf is sjw about mentioning a famous celebrities name dumbass? You white people on Reddit call anything dealing sjw when it’s about minorities
---
Isn't corsica a main base for the french foreign legion ?
---
Yeah, this thing does not effect you, you think politics is just a subject that you choose to “chat” about when you are bored of sport huh ? What you call politics is my reality, and you want me to shut up because you don’t want to hear politics? 
---
Yeh, all the merch has different icons and she has the different face paint. Probably to sell it to china. Then again somehow they got a skull on her hat???

kowalski, analysis!

There are yellow pins in 4 locations we don't have in the game yet: India, Kenya, Peru and Mexico

Cuz China censors a lot of things in games.

r/meormyson
---
Let’s discuss him shall we? Look at him, this shot alone demonstrates all those years in service. It shows all the experience, everything he’s looked and experienced, the training, the army, the operation nimrod, his complexity shows right here. 
---
I choose low kix
---
We also have the Danish flag, though. And a few references to Greece. Hard to tell if the South American one is Bolivia or Peru. If it is Bolivia it could just be a reference to the Wildlands crossover.
---
Aw that sucks 
---
That sure don’t look like Shrek to me chief. 
---
BOPE and Spetsnaz have both done terrible things but there’s just not people on a continent wide scale that hate them, I just don’t think Ubisoft would wanna risk the amount of controversy they’d get, it’s a shame though 
---
Don't pull numbers. Six is just a way of calling the leader of a unit, due to commandos being formed of 5 soldiers by standard, and having a leader commanding them.
---
Naming him 5 is weird. 
---
Eh. I don't think old Sixes wouldn't have tried to help their people get along. Though with Harry's backstory being he's the chief psychologist of the team, it does makes sense he's better at it than people like the old Sixes and Angela's Six, since all of those leaders were said to come from intelligence/military leadership positions.
---
It is interesting to see this kind of Six, with a different background. I assume Angela's character had a reason to pick him.
---
My thing is: I don't like a purely stone-faced Six BUT I also hope they don't just make Harry a camp counselor they go to when sad or frustrated. I want, ideally, a mix of professionalism AND honest, personal moments like the one in this film. A good character (and arguably a leader) is a balance of those things.
---
I suppose it is anti-semitism not to have them. Wrtie a letter to the US congress. I'm sure they would have an issue with this.
---
No I just don't want to hear it on a video game sub and before you talk shit bud I hope you know that there are some politics around Israel that effect me to the core but I don't go around telling people that they're wrong and that Palestinians should die or something. I am open to discussion about conflict and I understand the country has done some things that have been wrong but I don't like it when 1. People take this to a video game sub and 2. When people discredit other people's opinions with insults before a reasonable debate between two civilized people.
---
First reddit clutch video ive seen where OP isnt just crouch walking and wide peeking &lt;3
---
FUCKIN A, tame impala and seige? Where’d I leave my acid!
---
See that's where other people will see you as being toxic. Other people have limited time to play.. but still do the challenge, You can't expect sympathy &amp; wonder why people didn't like what you was doing because you had limited time. Me for instance I have work on the weekends so I can't do the challenges, is it shitty? Yes but I'm not gonna go boost headshots to get it done quicker and then come onto the r6 sub crying because I got teamkilled for trying to get a easy route than other people who actually played properly to get it done lol.
---
DID I SEE..
---
*D A N E S ?*
---
Kakanka. One dude in our group couldn't pronounce Tachankas name very well in like 6 tries, so there you have it.
---
There is also the: "more than 10 kills and we vote to kick you" rule, which of course only applies for us in the group and not strangers or anything.
---
That would be pretty cool
---
I like the Blind headgear as well as the Aridtocrat 
---
And we'll still be stuck once we hit a nursing home at the age of 80.. then we might be half way done.
---
Somebody who doesn’t have enough time. I kno it’s retarded or sad to ask for headshots, but I really didn’t have enough time to do them myself
---
She’s Seven now. 
---
Ok
---
Move?
---
There's no NDA but honestly at this point you may as well wait until TMR. All I'll say is that at least with the demo build, Twitch is not immune.

Tachanka for heavy

This was a feature of the first four Rainbow Six games (the two Vegas entries used the two training maps, Kill House and Streets, for Terrorist Hunt).  I really miss the training levels.

Top left image From #3BehindSiege You can see northern flag on guys shoulder.

Bottom left corner another image From #3BehindSiege

Bottom Right corner you can see denmark flag on Hammer and scalpel trailer.

Its interesting, but... 
---
1. The Mira on the top seems like a glitch that will probably be patched soon. 
---
2. No Mira watching for a Tower rush 
---
3. Takes too long to set up. 
---
Damn that looks cool.
---
You really had enough of his shit
---
The real Six were the ~~friends~~ operators we ~~made~~ recruited along the way.
---
no problem dude
---
and increased the dropoff distance massively. she's way better now. 
---
I feel like a greek operation is a long time coming. Glaz' bio talks of him training with a fellow Greek sniper who I think helped develop his scope/ability (can't remember if that's exactly how it goes, but that's the gist)
---
could we get a TV show please
---
I’m not mad cuz of the teamkills, it’s because my Xbox account got suspended. Also somebody on this same subreddit literally asked the enemy team so that they could destroy drones. Also my aim is horrible now cuz I haven’t played in like 3-4 weeks
---
What do you mean?
---
Which Elite would you like?
---
Kixstar
---
Well you should be more careful what you say online when in a fit of rage. &amp; I would tell that guy the same thing I told you.
---
**AD**
---
**MORTEM**
---
**INIMICUS**!
---
That would bo sooo overkill haha, I was already mindblown by the stage this year :P
---
I appreciate the well-worded response, much better than "get over it"
---
&gt;How fucking groundbreaking, oh yeah, Chimera brought sooooooooooooo much character, I really know the characters now having watched it.
---
Anyone can boil something down to the bare minimum, which is what you are doing now. 
---
it's not "explody dude messing with explosives" it's explody dude toying with a new bomb he hasn't seen before, and criticizing the construction of it. This shows that Thermite has an advanced knowledge on the topic more for example.
---
You can boil down the Emoji movie and it will look the exact same as Grave of The Fireflies. Two protagonists doing stuff to achieve an outcome. it's how the two movies DO that basic sentence is the key difference. 
---
&gt;They all show a little bit of character but in reality, it's not much from either.
---
They could've, and they have before. I just don't know why Ubisoft didn't feel it necessary to hold the same level of standard as they're past productions.
---
&gt;Frankly, I don't see why that's a bad thing
---
Good, I hope you don't see it as a bad thing, as I don't either. I'm just saying it's not good. 
---
&gt;If you're playing R6S for the character, I think you're in the wrong place my guy.
---
I'm not playing r6s for the character, but cinematics are for the character, hell we get introduced to a new one in this trailer.

There's really nothing much I could do with her hipfire at the moment because it doesn't have a compensator so I kinda force myself to ads and melee more. Not to mention it doesn't work most of the time because she's really easy to predict.

I think this is teaser for that those operators have "considers" about their rework or that ubisoft is trying to tease us with those records.

But the scan offers more utility than just pinging the general area of a person

And here I was going into it expecting a Sledge and Doc buddy cop thing 
---
I'll be upset if it's not a huge lego character 
---
(Breathes in DEUS VULT)
---
Pure spite for fookin laser sights. That and a pool ball are all he needs to throw down. 
---
Nope you got what you paid for.
---
All the new editions come with the base operators locked and need to be unlocked. You don't need to pay anything more to get them but just use the in game currency collected by playing to unlock them.
---
Any editions past the standard just give you more operators right away.
---
Sorry I'm not up to date with Siege and just hopped on because of the trailer, why'd they replace 6?
---
It's like those Bronzes who think Ash shouldn't be nerfed at all.
---
I could go on how Ubisoft should nerf Ash but That is not the point here.
---
**arm and leg swinging intensifies*\*
---
Except for when your friend *cough cough I know your on this sub* stops shooting for 10 seconds and decides the perfect time to shoot is when your running up 
---
In the books, Clark and Ding did the rainbow stuff well after their intelligence stuff. Ding is just getting into Clark’s daughter when he begins doing intelligence stuff (with Clark, which is how they met) but in R6, they’re already married with a mini ding on the way 
---
I didn't actually, you referred to the acog being removed "only" to put a difference between her two guns. That is incorrect. But hey if you wanna ignore the entire first half of the paragraph in the notes, be my guest.
---
&gt;implying SI Pulse isn't the best
---
SCP-173 SPOTTED
---
MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I love the fact that they used Tame Impala.
---
I know this is hibana but longbow would be a badass op name
---
If only this happened when solo queue in ranked. (I like the risk)
---
Dark room man, that was literally the portal to hell.
---
I feel the same way. It is such a shit show when they play against us console controller people. 
---
Twitch f2 basically 99% pickrate as well.
---
Her other options are terrible by comparison. A dmr with less dps, less bullets, and comparable recoil, and a shotgun. On attack.
---
At least removing the f2 acog would make the dmr something to think about, although I doubt it. Many people pick twitch for the gun, not her gadget.
---
&gt;My point isn't that a country with a majority of a race needs to only have ops with that race. My point is the inconsistency with which the game handles this stuff.
---
Funny how this information comes only when we see the CGI. Doesnt take a genius to look at the pins on the map behind Harry and start calling off names. 
---
What is the relationship between each country mentioned? 
---
They said that theres a guy that they know who works on siege and also mentioned that crouch spam is being tackled YET this was already confirmed by Ubisosoft recently. 
---
If this information came prior to the release of the CGI i would believe it to an extent. 
---
That’s so cool that’s really good cosplay
---
The place where half of both teams come to die. Time to take shotty and rush dark!
---
About the Tachanka thing, Ash literally called him “my lord” or something like that in Outbreak
---
I think that’s Lesion
---
seems kinda similar to the role nomad fills tbh
---
Webber was one of the snipers in the rainbow six books. Allison in the games i believe.
---
why act like you know what you’re talking about when you don’t?
---
Rainbow Harry Siege
---
The elite outfit looks Native American but she herself is Chinese.
---
It's not really a reference. They're a psychedelic rock band that I listened to the first time I did acid.
---
fooken luvly
---
New Ancient Egypt season?
---
When thatcher gives dokkaebi the knife on the shelf you can actually see a beanie with "swelter skelter" on it! (from watch dogs 2) I find this easter egg as cool as the first one yet less mentioned
---
It doesn't look like valk. I don't care if she is fat or not but that is not a good cosplay. 
---
they don't go out for a couple days after the event its always like that
---
Watched this without sound, but the music was still loud in my ears. Beautiful.
---
Hacks
---
Yup but the thing is leaker leaked Gridlock and Mozzie 1 month ago and it was correct. 
---
It was fun when defenders actually defended sites, rather than 3 roaming for example. Before release of operators like Cav, defenders lurking/roaming were at a disadvantage and I remember hating the games where they were just playing like deathmatch, running out, dying or getting a sneaky kill. It just broke down the game to having no point.
---
Can I get context?
---
imagine a saki skin from emergence
---
Console does, it’s a special type though, hat it does is it slows dow your crosshair when You move it over an enemy. You can turn it off if you want to.
---
Can i get a source please
---
Didn’t realise how short Kix was, F in chat
---
I was hoping for Israel. Apparently its Secret Service.
---
Snapping noises
---
I was watching the stream when this played and the amount of Harry Potter references that were made were glorious 
---
Road to being a toxic dick that ruins matches for genuin struggling players. 
---
Harry is the name of the new leader of Rainbow Six. 
---
No. Clear hacks 
---
Your own breach charge, ftfy
---
ALPHA???
---
You can change the text on your flair.
---
Ak-12 has the highest dps in the game for a primary weapon. It's broken as shit, balanced only by Fuze's speed. Recoil is a non-issue if you practice.
---
Literally no other weapon than an axe... his ability? well, to create a ledge and throw someone into it of course 
---
if i could've id give this gold
---
CGI videos require dedicated teams and rendering farms. 
---
He has to be at least high tier, to keep things accurate. 
---
I mean a muzzle break can still make a bit of a difference. They just got done buffing her too just leave it along if it didn’t really matter. 
---
Ash was a perfectly balanced operator. But because the “numbers” show she’s picked 99% of the time with acog on r4c suddenly it’s a problem. 
---
Capitao is a pretty decent op. 3 speed with two good primaries. The fire bolt was never really an issue. 
---
Won’t argue Cav, she needed it honestly. 
---
Lesion, this is the one that gets me the most. You could almost call him the perfect operator utility and weapon wise. This was unnecessary 
---
Dokkaebi, this basically made her utilities useless. I mean look at this; 
---
After 18 seconds, phone calls from Dokkaebi will hang up on their own
---
Being in range of Mute jammers will prevent Dokkaebi from calling you
---
Walking into range of Mute jammers will hang up phone calls during the call
---
Totally took a sh*t on her. 
---
My point here is these were all with the exception of Cav, very unnecessary Nerfs, there are so many other ops that could have been tweaked and they chose spend time on these operators. Where’s the Lion nerf? Blitz needs to be fixed, Castle needs a Buff, glaz needs a rework. 
---
damn right
---
hello nick, how's your mom?
---
You can also shoot the hinges and the door will fall down. 
---
Uhh yeah, but they could be in Ubisoft universe so...
---
Yo is that the platform from adventure time card wars episode?
---
This is the new character effectively replacing "Six", the woman who speaks to you in the situations and introduces the game the first time you open it.
---
Sign me up.
---
Kassandra new op. Sweet. 
---
And Finka, she's 27
---
*boise
---
I meant we can see op’s face 
---
Gets bugged so she can give the other team boners and make that depressed 
---
&gt; Confederate Independent Systems 
---
yes
---
Ah, ok.
---
They aren’t. In the short he specifically says his wife doesn’t like knives around when Dokk hands him a knife. Why would they be married?
---
My only problem with the Capitao rework (they should have just left him alone to begin with) is by spreading his area of damage I can see this being a huge problem and they will have to go back and re nerf him to the point of no one wanting to use him period. Considering he’s rarely picked to begin with. 
---
stop posting these. 
---
thanks
---
yes I saw the video 
---
I'll pay $500 for a strand of her hair

Dokkaebi isn't even in this picture...
---
you mean God of Team Rainbow.
---
Are you diamond?
---
Looks creepier than cav
---
Please no, we don’t need too many ridiculous outfits in this game.
---
So I am new to the game and am SO lost with this....What is all this? I just don't understand. Is it just lore stuff? Or is it about new content coming?
---
I’ve played since launch and never been diamond :(. Plat 2 rn
---
And see, it’s like a lot of these nerfs are coming out of no where. I just wished they had added some buffs to go along with the nerfs. As I said before, castle could sure use one. 
---
yikes

I read that as Kingdom Hearts 3 for some reason

was free

O actually. I never knew. I just got her 😂

Holy shit you’re right. I didn’t see that!

I would like to try this but in rank it will take up too much of the prep phase to setup and it might still hv to be completed during the action phase.

I'm guessing dude's a real descendant of some royal family.

In the outbreak short, he was shopping for ww guns like on Amazon.

Fun, modularly breech-able alternative to barricades. Would love to see these on all maps, especially as the exterior exits.

She reactivated Rainbow and stopped the terrorists...
---
She got so good at it, that...
---
It got her a promotion.
---
That's actually the backstory of Harry replacing Angela as the new Six.
---
Taking the ACOG didn’t make sense and it does indeed open up the plausibility or taking it from the F2. Taking flahsbags from Ash would make much more sense. It doesn’t make sense that she ever had them. No operator can clear their own ADSs besides Ash. 
---
Maybe a new operator based on Lars Andersen the Danish arrow guy is coming. Nice spot btw.
---
FOR THE TREASURE TO TAKE

Gang gang

they never looses reception now do they
---
When u say the r4c is op but jackets gun has higher dmg higher fire rate and less recoil lol but the r4c is the broken ok 
---
It’s the crouch lean spam that’s the problem with ash
---
Blitzy zombies lol
---
Dedication to the meme
---
Helmets with netting draped over it. Those helmets, as far as I know, don’t really offer ballistic protection. They’re often called “bump helmets”. They’re good strong helmets but won’t do much against shrapnel and especially not bullets. They’re just so you don’t crack your skull if you fall or have debris falling on you. 
---
As for the netting, it’s just really good camouflage. Humans are insanely good at identifying facial features and human figures. The netting obscures facial features while being very easy to see through from the inside, and also obscures distinct shapes like jaw/chin and neck. It’s really effective.

Better yet if he glowed gold
---
At 1:22 on the shelf next to Thatcher, there is a swelter skelter beanie from watch dogs 2 
---
It's more than an irritant it's a threat and a very strong one either move or die. Capitao is going to go from an op only the top percentage of players can even use to somebody for everyone. I don't have a coordinated team i can play bomb with constantly so this op I paid money for has been largely useless. Im finally going to get my money's worth. 
---
And his turret was just completely golden and caused a flashbang like blinding effect to everyone looking at it directly besides Tachanka.

Maybe the white masks locations/attacks

Some neat details here. Thatcher's boat, "Iron Maggie" is named for Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the UK and known as the "Iron Lady". So that's a direct reference for where Thatcher gets his callsign from.
---
Actually imagine if it was an attacker healer. He could bring some sort of medkit. Would be perfect 
---
Jackles gun is also faster at reloading
---
My friend, who got siege for the free weekend, played recruit

You'll have to buy $70 worth of packs to be sure you'll get it.

I just found I fix to mine. I set my aspect ratio to 4:3 and it fixed it
---
Wait what now?
---
Name one thing in rainbow Ubi didn’t do because some people didn’t want it.
---
You're forgetting mira traps as a rush counter, scares a lot of people out of rushing in when they see a black mirror.
---
Mongols? That’s going to make for some interesting hostage situations. 
---
“We just got a call. We can either release the hostage or they’re going to pour molten silver into our throats, roll us up in carpets and crush is with horses.”

“Definitely nope.”

What'd that be, m8

---
And that kids is how I met your father.
---
Uhhh 3 speed for the most part have less utility so they have better guns to compensate for that
---
Lion is getting a rework, Dokk is getting nerfed, shields are getting nerfed with ADS times and that's pretty much the only use Finka has in the rush. 
---
Well it’s only a war crime if it’s a war.
---

Ah the classic 177013 pic
---
Can someone explain? I’m out of the loop

---
Considering all the tactical games that have promised to be "the new Rainbow Six" and not live up to it, I keep my hopes low for that one. 
---
And a glaz flipping up hid scope
---
I see glocks or possible polymer80 pistols on the wall behind lol I need an operator with some Glock model 
---
boas 
---
I was laughing my ass off throughout this entire chain of events. 
---
It's not even a short. It's a trailer. Do you get mad when trailers don't tell you everything?
---
The only one I legit believe is Denmark because it was shown in the Thatcher and Dokkaebi CGI, Even though I'd love a Mexican and Indian operator in siege.
---
The R4 isn’t losing the ACOG because it’s a good fun, it’s losing the ACOG because ash’s speed makes her too versatile with the ACOG. 
---
Oh ok thx dude👌
---
Six was apparently offered a position in the US State Department, hence her choice to leave Rainbow
---
This makes me miss the old 2015 community. We had a guy who would just not shut up about doors. 
---
From a training perspective, it does make sense tough. Doors are harder to replace than boards that represent doors. 
---
Pretty sure that combo = Thor.

Nah I really don’t see that. Removing the ACOG says that she’s a close range operator, and I don’t think any other aspect of her kit supports that.

It's explicitly promised not to be that, so unless you're interested in a SWAT successor (and it's primarily going to be a single player experience), it may not be for you.
---
That being said, I'm considering the title vapourware until it's downloaded on my hard drive.
---
It's because this weekend is free to play. Meaning the install from the disk will load without having to have the disk in the drive. After Sunday (I think) it will go back to normal and you will need the disk. 
---
Could be what dokiabis new charm is about the deploy at the end April 4
---
I heard rumors of some sort of campaign but that probably won’t happen so
---
Removing ACOG means it's more of a skill gun then spray and pray. You can still win direct gun fights but require skill to win long fights. 
---
Yeah lol 
---
Ash is by the numbers overpicked. They don’t care if you use the g36, they just want Ash to have a more specific role rather than being a crutch for every situation 
---
Twitch’s ACOG is probably safe because she’s not a 3 speed. Ash’s speed meant she could dominate at all ranges, so taking the ACOG means that she is more of a close range rush character. Twitch’s kit does not support that play style at all, so I don’t think her ACOG will be taken. 
---
Hammer too OP and is illegal
---
but this game with friends is pretty great, that's why it got that award on steam
---
Big Chankus
---
But Ash still has an ACOG on a gun that’s only slightly worse than the R4-C but has even less recoil subjectively. No idea what Ubi is trying to accomplish here. 
---
Now if I had a hammer, I'd swing it in the morning. I'd swing it in the evening, all over this land.
---
Is whack people’s heads in
---
It didn't really have a resolution either (nor did Outbreak), so they really (unintentionally) make it sound like Six was kicked upstairs. Lmao.
---
I actually think it's gonna be the other way around. It's gonna have more to say in higher ranks cus they are expert at pixel angles/peeks which will be harder to watch/see without a acog.
---
If I think it will make her "unplayable rofl uninstall" not even close. But I can agree somewhat to the person you replied to. That "tricking" us to pick her other gun by removing the acog on the better gun iis a weird way to try and make us pick that other gun. I'd rather have it they removed acog on BOTH weapons then maybe buff the numbers on the g36. But that's just me.
---
Because for people that are already sufficient with one-taping headshots, you can still do that with the g36's acog, the only difference is for medium-long range sprayers, as they will have a slower rof with the g36. But again, just my 50 cents.
---
r/itswooooshwith4os r/itswooooshwithouttheH
---
The damage doesn't help. The meta guns are decided by fire rate and recoil, since one headshot is an instant kill. Basically how many bullets can I hose in the general direction of their head. 
---
Basically why SMG sidearms were so powerful and kind of suck now that they have recoil
---
They should do it for ever OP honestly lol
---
Guys rainbow harry siege am I right???😎😎😎😎
---
Also dokkaebi hot in new trailer 😎😎😍😍
---
/s
---
I feel like an idiot after typing that
---
^^she ^^is ^^pretty ^^hot ^^tho
---
G36 is a lot worse at range. 
---
Even with Mavericks slight nerf I bet his pick rate is about to skyrocket too
---
Would you look at that... An [image macro meme](https://i.imgur.com/cyxVVSE.png) on the main page.
---
He also has one from Cav and Castle.... interesting 
---
If they're just CGI trailers, not really building up to anything, that's some major blue-balling.
---
It's because people use /I/ (or similar) in lieu of an N for the n word
---
boeis 
---
I think the recoil one is better, if the dps changes it wont really matter cause headshots are a thing, even tho they are RARE
---
ohhhhhh
---
Don't buy it. It's very easy to not buy things, you know.
---
no his doing drugs
---
no wait isnt that the same thing
---
Only if I can play as Harry.
---
Maybe in a few years if the game Is more stable 
---
I thought it was a bug. Do you know why they are doing this?
---
Poses i mean like, choosing between 3 (i guess 3 is nice) poses. I'm sick of watching Cav's stare...
---
Yeah if you really wanted to hurt the gun, you'd decrease fire rate but I'd rather no ACOG than a slower fire rate tbh
---
"Glaz" means "Eye" in Russian, hence the monocle, representing the eye.
---
It was like that for Dokkibae's uniform. It was the last one, and the only one I wanted. :&lt;
---
...And?
---
Also not what I asked. Apex is "tone deaf" because it doesn't have "enough" white people in your opinion. So how many is enough, and what does that make the vast majority of all video game casts, which are overwhelmingly and often exclusively white?
---
The problem in the first place is even politicising the existence of characters of colour. 
---
Seen in the comments on that video on YouTube “god Dokks waist and belly”........yes the world is an amazing place isn’t it
---
y'all down voting. share why this isn't a good idea??
---
Looks kind of intimidating tbh
---
I definitely would do that. The packs are worth the $50.
---
Wow incredible news!
---
Fookin 'ell
---

---
In the game's intro, the original Six (in Siege, at least) was handing over command to the new Six after activating her program.
---
After the success of Article 5, she gets promoted and now, this guy is in charge.
---
Hello Yaboii275, your submission has been removed as it appears to be about Twitch Drops.
---
We all know what would happen. It gets released, the pleased players don't say anything, but everyone who for some reason *hates* the idea of a causal wear skin, ***cough IQ cough***, will wear out the ears of everyone nearby.
---
Please no.
---
Does anyone know what the new si challenge is for pack?
---
*big think*
---
Well, I wouldn't want to politicise it in the first place, but if diversity is hailed to be a virtue, then I figure we might as well do it properly.
---
And the cast is, in my opinion, a product of setting.
---
No one does, the devs explained that with the change new players would have to unlock them again but never explained the reason for having to unlock them again.
---
yeah, it's 500 for each vanilla op, but with the y4 pass that came with the ultimate edition, i get 10% off everything so it's only 450. 
---
i understand why they'd do that but it's still kinda lame.
---
yeah, it's only 450 renown per op, but still kinda dumb. thanks for answering though
---
I may not know all the internal reasons, but it was a needed compromise to remove the Starter Edition and to drop the base game price. 
---
"That."
---
500-2000 actually.
---
But yeah, good luck playing. Cheers!
---
Yikers, (Btw the Siege Chat filter thing is dog-shit and won't stop toxicity, because there is still VOIP.)
---
That’s good to know thanks!
---
Been thinking the same for years. Why the extreme lack of doors? 
---
Being able to kick open a door, reverse kick and flash or just shotgunning it open would be cool. It would limit not only attacker movement but also roamer movement if attackers close them. The possibility for traps and mines increases and limiting sightlines as well.
---
They could be more sturdy than a barricade to break, but possible to open completely silently with an action that takes about as long as it takes to put on a Rook plate. Like an animation, which is for balancing.
---
That’s an issue that should mainly concern Sony and Microsoft
---
What does The vip thing mean?
---
My says i have 0 shota fired but a lot connected
---
I know, but why not?
---
This takes nothing from the other teams working on r6 why are you whining about this? Do you really think that bugs are gonna be fixed just by throwing money at new devs?
---
The honour is mine! Please keep up the amazing work. o7

And For Honor has recently had an Assassin's Creed-themed event. Does that mean we get to meet Abstergo at some point?
---
Yeah, I saw it as well (could only make out three words of the title though). I'd assume it's just alluding to quantum cryptography, which would make sense for Dokka to be interested in given her aptitude for intelligence/communication and intercepting it.
---
manner never loses reception

twitch chat was all resident sleeper during this whole segment lol

Thatch op af

I’m surprised Thermite didn’t get a team leader indicator. It says in his bio he’s a great leader I think
---
Almost as epic as the ending scene of Rogue One
---
Same
---
you know what's bullshit? the fact there's a Lore video about this but there wasn't a CGI trailer for AC Odyssey. 
---
From a gameplay standpoint, it would be absolutely horrible. Just camp doors. They move, blast them. 
---
ge mig en pølse køv før in i helvede
---
It would be nightmarish. 10 sets of gadgets on both sides... It doesn't matter how big the map is if the obj is still just one room. It would be impossible to gather intel as you can't possibly track 10 opponents across a map. 
---
This was a known trick since kaid was launched
---
no, they largely use the same methods. you're talking to someone that literally codes cheats for rainbow six. the differences are at most slight. the added cost for rainbow six developers and the added intrusion would not be worth the literal nothing EAC will provide.
---
if EAC were to be added right now, I would literally not do anything for my cheat, because I would not have to.
---
Nope

Doing the lords work

Ubi will add a connector on another floor (basement maybe?), and re-release it. 
---
The world of Gacha games is a confusing and perilous one, if you delve deeper I wish you luck soldier. 
---
Looks like a face to me.
---
Skulltula charm?
---
It is possible with a controller (easier with Xbox Elite controller/PS4 equivalent), but a lot of the time it's also probably a KB&amp;M user. Because they're not really detectable by Ubisoft on console, they also can't detect the macros, so there's zero risk unfortunately :( it's gotten so, so bad in the last few months.
---
You mean people can't move? You can still move the mouse/right joystick to shoot.
---
I've been wanting 10v10 since I got the game. There's no relaxation mode, just ranked and "ranked but without spawnpoint selection."
---
Part of me really wanted Thermite to join in. Preferably by breaching the bar wall. 
---
I mean, why is Thatcher even in a bar fight without his BFF :D 
---
Did you get this from Sau_siege in Instagram? Lmao. This is the Cav that he hides in drawings and pics and stuff lmao. Heres the link to the post https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt8f-7lH8ec/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1yqis99qw29e
---
Is it really charm that exists.
---
Qx
---
Hit your shoulder, check the blood.
---
It’s kinda aggravating because to properly team rush you need good team communication with people on mics. I’m not like amazing at siege so take it with a pinch of salt. Also you need the right team comp. basically anyone with a global ability. Lion, Finka or dok. Blitz is also good at rushing. Also rip ash acog
---
So like is this a trailer for a longer short film? Or is this it? I love this.
---
Lol my friend showed this to me didn't know the source sorry
---
Bruv I'm a PC player. İf you aren't a left handed person you hold the mouse with your right hand
---
That looked so smooth lmao damn.  Like all your bullets hitting the shield on her back then she just knifes you. 
---
Someone needs to add the ultra instinct theme to this fight scene plz
---
Bit of an obscure comparison but it looks like the face from The Mighty Boosh.
---
Nah you're good lol
---
In chimera we got thermite face reveal and this is definitely not thermite
---
Source?
---
looks like uuno😂
---
Twice the Blitz, double the fun !
---
can't tell if right is boy or girl 
---
If Greece is indeed gonna come, I hope Kure Galanos returns in some way or form. She was already mentioned in a patch note.
---
hell yeah I'm with you vro. Ill do it for $20
---
Most of my stuff is on PS4 which I left, when I switched to PC.
---
So I’m gonna say, probably my Twitch Prime packs? I’ve only ever seen one other person rocking Purple Ela. I’m glad those came with me to PC at least.
---
0.24, so i guess this is the meta
---
No judgement but I love how doki has a sorta chub face, love the lore making and character dev, makes me attached to the OPs I started playing more of.
---
Well that is the thing about R6S, you only get a good team 1 time in 15 to 30 rounds. If that happens there will be the lagging and the server problems. In my eyes that is what is stopping the spred of Rainbow 6. I see memes about the Siege server sometimes and they are right. Fuck oparetion healt. FIX YOU'RE DAMN SERVERS!
---
I wasn’t expecting that and I absolutely love it. I’m all for R6 Siege lore and want more of this type of content. 
---
I like to think Thatcher keeps giving knives to everyone on team Rainbow, even multiple times and Six just has a trunk in his office full of confiscated Thatcher knives 
---
&gt; rather than her looks in the video
---
you probably missed this
---
It makes the room harder to defend because it makes it more difficult to retake. 
---
You can’t have a defender actually in the room because there’s 4 windows so they’ll die pretty quick, so you’ve got the assume the attackers will get in. So by doing what the OP did; when the attackers do get into the room they’ve got a nice safe room to sit in with only two points of entry they have to cover.
---
A decent strat tends to be to shotgun out the bottom of those walls so defenders can cover the room from the stairs or across the hall, where they’ve got a good angle that attackers will find it harder to return fire.
---
I think they have more of a mentor-student kinda dynamic, honestly.
---
did that screen raise up during the matches? i watched it all on twitch but it didnt look like the screen was that close to their faces lol
---
your*
---
Fuck sake. I really hope they don't add the ricochet damage from COD hardcore mode. Would absolutely ruin this game.
---
Sure is.
---
RIP ash acog
---
That makes sense mouses are designed to be used on a right hand so it fits better on right than left
---
Flair inaccurate?
---
Oh yeah, I'm sure *many* would immediately pick that up.
---
TWO seconds late! 
---
The name of the boat at 2:56, 'Iron Maggie' is in the GOT font. There is the silhouette of what looks to be a dragon in the O as well....

---
It’s Thermite’s Halloween headgear lol
---
Why would you buy skins? It's the most idioting thing. You will have that fancy skin that nobody else cares. What's the point? It's not like you play better with a special skin. I got all my operators unlocked by playing not buying any year pass. Throw money on better stuff imo.
---
Did you clutch tho
---
Good change however I don’t see it affecting her much. I can see the weapon getting more changes down the road if it hasn’t changed much. 
---
I’d personally like to see less damage such as 34 (from 39) and lower mag size (down to 20 +1). Personally I think it should act more like a SMG but with some AR properties such as higher damage. These changes wouldn’t kill the weapon, but would take it down to the level of the G36C (which isn’t a bad thing). Maybe could get the ACOG back if this were to happen.
---
I think this would help close the gap between the weapons and make her more balanced. That’s just my opinion though.
---
Thanks for the red circle I would have never guessed what you were talking about otherwise
---
You can even see in the [pic op posted](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387352483153969163/546605173733326848/hamscrew.JPG) that the "threads" run perfectly horizontal

couldn't agree more lol.

Can't call somebody a cunt in text chat so you bitch about it hahahaha. 
---
No :( last guy got me in the ass
---
You're a [[wizard]] Six Harry.

Ubi ban curse words and anything else that's very offensive to the majority of people. What the fuck did you expect was gonna happen when you said that? You were banned fairly, now stop whining about it. 
---
***You are the one who's wrong. ***
---
I reported them for you. You’re welcome.

#*Sits in 300+ charms*
---
Well maybe they announce a Turkish season too! We have to wait, few hours left 
---
Wait, Thatcher is a part of S.A.S., right? To me he looks like a Kingsman. 
---
I think we can all agree it's a great skin, apart from the hands, which literally look like they should be on Tachanka, not Dokkaebi.
---
Just use her original hands, from the original uniform, and take away the gloves. The new ones look hideous ...
---
PS. the photo was not made by me, and was taken from a post from earlier this year.
---
Where the hell is this from???? 
---
Exactly, so you can still shoot, you just can't move.
---
After this video i decided to buy Thatcher elite
---
Get 15 headshots.
---
I don’t find it that insane. Sure it’s being used as slang in a lot of places but like...... you know how that word has historically been used in the past right? It’s probably one of the more sexist terms. And that’s probably why it got banned. A bunch of old racist terms that aren’t used much anymore got banned too. They have reasoning. They just don’t want the community to spread hate to a bunch of people and are trying to ban all the derogatory terms. 
---
As Lion
---
yeah it was, so i just bought them all. lol
---
Yes they're great and tell us about how the characters feel and shit it's just fucking Great
---
$30 bro. 
---
Well it wasnt that hard for me and im only silver
---
Good change, but not using an acog is better for rushes so people who rush with ash its basically a buff.
---
Israel, obviously. 
---
Plus keybindings for every game would be reversed in left/right strafe. Also since the gun model is always on the right side on the screen it can be a bit confusing when you are aiming from the left side.
---
Just wait, they'll come for you next
---
-me a depressed Ash Jäger main

Why does Dok look old in the traiker in a few shots?
---
What site is this?

And yet I’ll throw to contacts at blitz and he’ll eat that shit up like meatballs

Thx a lot
---
If these Pins are CTUs then:
---
North Americas:  Pretty sure that's 1 in Mexico (mystery 1), 3 in the US (FBI/Valk/Mav), 1 in Canada (JTF2). 
---
South Americas:  Brazil (BOPE) and possibly Peru? (mystery 2)
---
Europe:  2 in the UK (SAS/Clash), 1 in Spain (GEO), 1 in France (GIGN\[including Lion who's ex-GIGN\]), 1 in Germany (GSG-9), 1 possibly in Italy (GIS) 1 possibly in Poland (GROM). Might be wrong on some of those.
---
Africa:  Morocco (GIGR), and what could be Tanzania? (mystery 3).
---
Asia:   Possibly India? (mystery 4), Hong Kong (SDU) , South Korea (707th SMB), Japan (SAT)
---
Australasia:  Australia (SASR)  
---
So then 4 mystery places: Mexico, Peru (possibly), Tanzania (possibly), and India (possibly)
---
BUT, Where are the Russian Ops' pins?  
---
If these Pins are maps then:  
---
We have 17 functioning maps (18 but discounting Bartlett University) and there are 21 pins.  
---
Bank - USA, Bartlett Uni - USA, Border - 'Middle East', Chalet - France, Club House - Germany, Coastline - Spain, Consulate - Ivory Coast, Favela - Brazil, Fortress - Morocco, Hereford Base - UK, House - USA, Kafe Dostoyevsky - Russia, Kanal - Germany, Oregon - USA, Outback - Australia, Plane - UK, Skyscraper - Japan, Theme Park - Hong Kong, Tower - South Korea, Villa - Italy, Yacht-???  
---
These pins just don't line up, too many maps in the USA for the pins provided (also none in LA), likewise for Germany. Also many other things are wrong, I just don't buy it.
---
Pretty sure SASG is semiautomatic shotgun, kinda like the BOSG is break-open shotgun. CAMRS is Canadian Army Marksman Rifle System. They just make up silly acronyms
---
Probably cropped from Twitter 
---
I don't think you understand the think about six
---
Thx a ton also happy cale day
---
Wtf is Thermite and Montagne lol
---
Well it’s more France as it’s showing the French you can still shoot an arrow at those cheese munchers.
---
I had no idea that this video could get 100% better
---
Who pissed off Ash Ketchum?
---
Well, it wasn’t obvious for me
---
How 2 flick: practice, lower sensitivity, practice
---
No, unfortunately.
---
I’m not gonna lie, my mate playing cav had hit all of them, but I think its impressive nonetheless 
---
Fuck people for getting what they like, right?
---
Literally it doesn’t even directly affect you. Why aren’t they allowed to buy skins that they like?
---
Crazy?
---
Something doesn’t add up. I have 80 hours. And have them all and 4 dlc ops.  
---
Died for a nible cause {-}7
---
The legendary CCCP universal skin
---
These poeple watched u/bikinibodhi s clash videos 😂
---
I mean it could depend on how good you do in each game
---
Heh he
---
I guess queuing solo is a bad idea then...
---
Maybe, problem is the BOSG is fictional, and I think that CAMRS is an actual thing, could be wrong.
---
😏
---
Noticed that at some point in the video, in Dokkaebi’s cage there is a garment with the writing “Swelter Skelter” on it. Reference to the tech-junkyard festival in the desert as part of a Watch Dogs 2 mission. Links the two universes together?
---
Ending up getting maverick, really like him so far, thanks for the help boys! 
---
dont start this shit here, that is what EA is charging for anthem.
---
This was nice but you have drones, pleeeeaaseeee use them, it’s frustrating when you watch your teammate die to an enemy that they would have seen if they sent a drone in 
---
And it’s based on the swole 6Inv skin
---
Where's Greece?
---
Might have been they were originally gonna have the irl name and decided not to pay for licensing but forgot or didnt notice that was on the gun model itself. There may also be some legal loophole allowing it, who knows.
---
I had only watched the R6Universe Panel at that point, yet their Operator Bios, especially Thatchers and ingame Lines have done more in less screentime. No I dont want trailers to tell me everything, i want them to make me want to see the rest; to show me whats the movies personality is like. Showing me bland hulls of human flesh and outright explaing the title in the most subtle way imaginable doesnt serve the job of a trailer.
---
Because I'm tired of the s\*\*tstain of a matchmaking this game has and I think it needs to get fixed. Seriously tho, it can get fixed with a minimal effort and it will have a great positive impact for the game.
---
I've opened 4 of those free packs and got the two legendary Thatcher items. Great luck!
---
["Clancy is my slave master"](https://youtu.be/o4OD3IHs5jU?t=79) makes sense now.
---
Doesn't answer the question. Doesn't show matchmaking is fucked. Just that you don't understand.
---
And that was with out a single fucking laser sight.

I know,just sayin
---
oh is that what she does? f2p weekend here, thought it was a just finisher like in apex legends
---
I agree with this-the GUN itself needs some balancing, not the sight. 
---
Twitch's F2, as well as Jackal's C7 and Buck's c8, in a world where there is no recoil and spread, offer better damage for almost same ROF. The recoil is what balances these guns.
---
Removing the Acog from Ash only further solidifies here style to just rushing, and it will make the dilemma worse. 
---
Just nerf the recoil of the R4C to C8 levels, and then work from there.

You just have to play 2 hours worth of Siege to see that the matchmaking is fucked. I had to repost, because screenshots of scoreboard arent allowed. Now tell me what do you understand and what your qualifications are, because you seem all high and mighty?

are you challenging me

She won't be added to the game, because that was an easter egg to older R6 games. [https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Kure\_Galanos](https://rainbowsix.fandom.com/wiki/Kure_Galanos)

Seems like the company and the fans aren't on the same page either 
---
must do otherwise they wouldn’t have written the message surely 
---
normally I would be pissed on such comment but I have to admit you are totally right
---
NGL I'm not interested in this stuff at all. I have no interest in knowing which Operators are dating or if their Brothers have a gambling problem. It does nothing for me. I understand others enjoy it but I really can't understand why? It won't change the game in any way. Not the mechanics, balancing or rules. It won't make me pick Thatcher or Dokkaebi any more or less. It's just fluff. I also am not interested in a single player campaign. I said this during Outbreak if there really is a huge demand for this type of content Ubi should make a new standalone single player game using the Siege operators as characters in it. Instead of exploiting the Siege community by putting out a Campaign that's overly short and lacking on content, whilst charging people for the cosmetics they made special for it. 
---
Fuze ace is 5 enemy kills AND the hostage. Game says that you loose, but that just Ubi being too afraid to recognise your skill.
---
"It could easily be thousands".
---
Only if you think it took one guy 3 months to make. This project will have involved dozens of specialists, no way is it that cheap.

---
Yeah, but a convenient excuse not to integrate any law because even hiring one writer who knows anything is too much money/effort 😑. The reason I even started reading the book was because of the general sense of international elite cohesion and the way so many hard arse specialists were instantly willing to team up against a global international terrorist unit. It's exciting, and the could be so much good vs evil lore out there that both makes sense and gets more people interested in siege. I just wish they had actually thought about it

It’s Empire vs G2, sounds like it’s gonna be good
---
The GUN itself needs some balancing, not the sight.
---
Twitch's F2, as well as Jackal's C7 and Buck's c8, in a world where there is no recoil and spread, offer better damage for almost same ROF. The recoil is what balances these guns, and limits the amount of "comfort" a player has in picking them. They offer arguably more utility vs ash, with theoretically better dps and equivalent headshot potential, but why is ash picked more (barring the 3 speed)? 
---
The R4C is just braindead to use-very controllable recoil, high fire rate, which is a match made in heaven for a one shot head shot game. 
---
Removing the Acog from Ash only further solidifies her style to just rushing, and it will make the dilemma worse.
---
Just nerf the recoil of the R4C to C8 levels, and then work from there. Make people work the gun. 
---
you can also potentially increase the recoil, and remove the vertical grip capability, then just leave it with the angled grip, which now gives players a choice between long range engagements, or more aggressive pushes with the R4C, but still having the option to at least hold long angles with it. DON'T limit what attachments players can use just because the gun is too good. 
---
casual? far worse, am plat 3 with silver teammates and got a full premade diamond team, believe me, cas is awfull
---
Just come as far as Yorkshire. Walk into an old man pub and claim she was anything other than scum; the locals will probably react the same way Thatcher did to those gents round the table. 
---
Look top right...
---
Im talking about the screen after the match.
---
The one where you can see the ranks.
---
If they exist that is.
---
Exactly!  With Ubisoft, a game like this is actually very likely to happen!  The only thing is, those games utilize maps or part of maps from the main games, and that probably wouldn't work with Siege.  They'd have to make all new environments which would add a lot of development that the Far Cry spin-offs don't need.
---
None of these operators or characters are from the novel.
---
Ill do anything for this skin
---
How? Lol
---
True. Happens sometimes. But you know what? Better be playing casual. Im not out there trying to get up, while ubisoft fucks my ass. 
---
If siege ever gets a sequel working doors into it would be a small but drastic change, and I'm all for it. 
---
Honestly all I'm hoping that we get is a 1.5x scope. Something to bridge the gap between the 1x and the acog
---
They were unranked. Doesn't mean they don't have mmr.
---
Fooking kids
---
My theory for his Callsign is because is gadget is liking the Game sleeping Lion. Basically a kids game in the UK
---
For Honor player here. Is this the same as when FH went free for awhile? Do I get to keep the game forever or no?
---
Casual doesn't look at the ranked data. Just data from casual.
---
Resident Evil? There are so many of them.
---
Thank you guys for all the amazing comments. Really love this community and the future of this game. I dont really like to plug stuff but check out my Twitter for more shitposts and stuff :) https://twitter.com/chaoticgeekcg 
---
The White Masks wants. Not the CTU itself.
---
Yeah. It's a pity all the nice maps just disappeared after a few weeks.
---
All 3 of them where between lvl 20 and 40. I checked it myself. Me and my friend are lvl 170.
---
Yeah man. That makes sense! No problem.
---
And yet they had comparable mmr to you and your friends. Hence why they were put with you.
---
That also looks like the parthenon, which is probably hinting at greek ops
---
I play casual sometimes because I like to try out new strats
---
This man was blessed by the lord. Although I still think Fuze would've done a better job at "teaching" them a lesson.
---
At least you can leave a game of casual with no repercussions.
---
Fuck blitz lol
---
I play casual cause I don't care about ranked. But free weekends are ass
---
Fooking doors
---
It’s vikings’n shit!

Lmfao. The matchmaking is a punishment.
---
And yeah they where clearly on our level wich is probably why we got eaten alive.

You were lagging hard brother

There are too many possible situations. And you only think I am a toxic bitch calling everyone cunts. You are wrong. For example, somebody can TK me or it may be a cheater or any possible really toxic action which I find annoying. So my reaction is to call this person a cunt. But I cant. You would say use the report system. I do but it doesn't work instantly. In fact, the whole community has no evidence about it working properly at all.

Thanks for tip.

This happened to me once before, however I was too ashamed to let anyone else know it happened.
---
I applaud your bravery good sir.

Exactly my point. You see a terrible team and you leave. In ranked you are forced to play. Its like being forced to talk about life with a 10 year old child. Wtf man.

Yeah it's odd. In actual fact it dates back to the England/France wars in which the French vowed to cut the two index fingers off of every British bowman. So the bowmen would hold up the fingers to taunt the French.

I agree m870 is shit until you're on top of them. Name a shotgun that isn't.

It's less shit than the others though, I've already linked you stat pages. You just assert bullshit, but I have facts to back stuff up.

No, it's Ubisofts content. I've just never seen it posted anywhere, propably because pople don't know how to extract pics like this one. So I did. Feel free to use it.

We need Operator videos for all the DLC ops. I understand it might be a stretch but those little details and some insight into the operators make the game worthwhile.

Holy crap you're stubborn, the dev time being used would be very small, one or two guys working for no more than a week to implement and it would encourage people to keep playing so they get more money so it's worth it.

What's wrong with people choosing to do something different if it doesn't affect anyone else. If you applied that mentality to pretty much anything else it would make zero sense.

Like I've said in other comments, look at the 4.1 patch notes that show the old super90 damage dropoff and spread numbers. Compare that to the current M870 or SG-CQB damage dropoff and spread numbers
---
They are almost identical, except M870 has more damage and half the rate of fire.
---
Do you deny ubisofts numbers?
---
&gt; the dev time being used would be very small, one or two guys working for no more than a week to implement and it would encourage people to keep playing so they get more money so it's worth it.
---
Just conjecture.
---
&gt;What's wrong with people choosing to do something different if it doesn't affect anyone else.
---
Except your example does affect everyone else.
---
She's an amazing person who goes by @popcornspieces on Twitter. 
---
Huh, TIL! Always cool to learn about the history behind these things. Thanks kind British redditor. :) 
---
Yeah it seems that anyone with vega has this issue. I think ubi know about it but dont think they've commented about it or know when it'll be fixed as its on ubi's end not AMDs.
---
If the defenders could just kill the hostage they would just allow them to grab them and kill the hostage immidatly after. 
---
It's a great cosplay but a terrible angle in the picture. Get over yourself, loser.

The Game editions are on sale right now. Year 4 pass is still in preorders so it won't go on sale any time soon.

Hello Osayii, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/arl4ox/banned_from_making_transaction_on_ubisoftrainbow/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Welllllllll I guess your right
---
Thank you for the info! This game is so fun. I want to get completely into it.
---
This is SI playlist, not ranked.
---
I had just joined this game late.
---
The attackers usually just spam smokes and flashes and fucking gtfos with the hostage.
---
So basically, the attackers have to make sure thay the room is clear and then take the hostage.
---
Imagine if, and hear me out because this is pretty crazy and out there, instead of a ping system to ask players to do things we used this thing called a microphone.  We can convey an almost if not entirely infinite amount of detail. Requests and observations by talking to eachother.  The argument that not all people have microphones is insane, and while a small majority of people may be indisposed currently to ysing their microphones the more likely sitiation is that most players are like yourself and are actively looking for ways to not communicate with your team.  Ive seen the way some people aim and i would rather have a 12 yo squeaker in every game than have to try to interpret what a "hold this angle" ping on a reinforced wall means.
---
Nope 
---
It isnt, but consequently is, making this sort of scenarios available.
---
Nice play tho i gotta say.
---
r/bikinibodhi

NOT COMMUNICATING ALSO AFFECTS EVERYONE ELSE! And far more than increasing the ability to communicate.

When someone shines a flash light on the back of your head, does it blind you?

Sorry if it came across like that.

Exactly.

Since when does he have 3 flash bands ?

Also nice play

The stats do support my claims.
---
The SAS shotty has MORE spread than the m870.
---
The SAS shotty does less damage per pellet at every range except 9-12m where it does 3-4 points more.
---
The SAS shotty has a 25% slower rate of fire than the m870.

What is incorrect here?

I'm a loser for not liking something? Am I a loser for stating an opinion that isnt even offensive? I just think the cosplay isn't that good. That's it.

quality post as always
---
I certainly like it better than Hereford, but the theme (non pun intended) of the dark disheveled look is the same. Doesn't seem to be a fan favorite.
---
All of the training skins make peoples hands look super grimy. Seriously take a look at Pulse's, he needs to learn about soap and water.
---
As the name suggests, Siege will only be free over the weekend.
---
Ahh I see
---
I'm not sure it'd be that fun though. A hospital is mostly small patient rooms and small doctor offices in long straight hallways. I don't think a fun hospital map would look much like a hospital at all. 
---
Is there a reason why?
---
I think so, yes

i dont think so... but i would still open them now xD

Seems quite a number of people didn't receive their Platinum Charm even though they had the stream on the entire time for the past two days. I only got till Gold myself.
---
I do remember that there was a gap in the drop between the Silver Charm and the Bronze and Copper ones. Perhaps there might be a gap to the Platinum ones too?

Unlucky, I have done this 4 times in the last month.

Why wouldn’t you just play zofia, or any other 3 speed if that happened? There would be zero advantage to picking ash.

I'm not actually sure if we even got to 20 hours total yet though that might be wrong as I'm not sure how long they streamed yesterday.
---
All I can say is that I watched every second of the stream up to now and I'm currently at gold. That either means (a) the streams haven't passed 20 hours yet or (b) the plat charms just haven't been delivered yet.
---
If it didn't have that 20 rnd mag i would probably say shes op.

Hah get it karen?  so funny guys amirite i hate karen!!!1!!!!!11!!!111

Just make it another elite. Pls ubi

They did?!?!?!

what happened to the last one? Sorry, I don't really pay attention to the lore

With Hereford (the new one at least) it seems like its an old training base considering the decal and vehicles outside, unless six are acting in WW2 with logic bombs etc.

Would you like an explanation

Some guy killed all 4 of us teammates. And the next two rounds I killed him *in defense* so we could *actually play the game*. Second time I killed him, *&gt;&gt;I&lt;&lt;* get a 30 min ban for teamkilling. 
---
#HE KILLED THE ENTIRE TEAM AND *I* GET BANNED FOR KILLING HIM TWICE.
---
Damn u right 
---
Yeah they should. But they likely won't since it's really the only bit of lore we've had since Outbreak that has meant something. But they still should try to do more with the characters we all know and love. And yes it is art as animation and cgi are considered forms of art.

It’s pretty good for beginners, after a while I would recommend moving to acog or red dot, depending on how much you like the right half of your screen. 
---
She looked like a horse before
---
Isn't it told somewhere it's because of his powerful and loud voice? I think it was something like that he was able to control civilians during an attack or something just because of his shouts and that got him the name.
---
That was in the free weekend version

how many super secret special forces people do you think carry giant metal barricades, wooden planks, and nail guns with them?

Literally every country ever is in this damn photo, I’m pretty sure it’s supposed to represent the global reach of rainbow and then all the operators are shown and where they are, highly doubt it’s leaking anything.

50 damage on direct hits iirc

was it not 5?

well i looked and there is no complete edition for r6s

I agree, they can’t give defenders ARs because the defense does have an edge. But sometimes those SMGs really feel like trash.

Better not repost this, punk

It’s... always revealed at invitational

IM FUCKIN RATTLED

Put sprint on toggle
---
That doesn’t even slightly fit that definition. Using certain operators isn’t unfair, it’s the entire point of the game. Also pretty much every op has a counter or can be countered, i.e. when Lion scans, stop moving. 
---
Gg my dude
---
I don't remember it properly man. Go easy pls

You aren't reunlocking anything if you already had them. This is for future purchases.

In the hammer and scalpel cinematic recently released by Ubi, the new six insists that Dokkaebi call him Harry, his first name I assume, since he feels like he has yet to deserve the title of six.

What exactly do you mean? Or what makes you think that?

Wait they still give the outbreak packs with them? Cause I thought they got rid of them when they updated the editions.

Hawx was a leadup to endwar(the razorback was the ace combat style experemental plane for that game), but yeah, endwar might as well have not existed,sadly. I loved that game.

Because pmm is actually pm. It's named wrong. But in all seriousness it's because of the more bullets you get and it's only like a 3 shot kill compared to the 2 shot of the pmm (pm*)

They *just* changed it, which may be why you're getting contradictory replies. As far as I understand it, the renown unlocks for the 20 base operators are much lower (500-2000 renown, increasing as you unlock more of them) than the cost for the newer dlc operators (25k). The [info they've posted](https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-344167-16/rainbow-six-siege-year-4-editions-launching-february-12) is a [bit confusing](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/faqs/000032916), but here's my best attempt at breaking it down:
---
**Breakdown of the versions:**
---
Starter edition (Old): being removed. If you already have this, you will be moved up to the *new* Standard Base Game edition.
---
Base Game Edition (New): Not sure which ops it comes with (I think it's just the original 4 or whatever). Unlock costs for the "legacy" (first 20) ops are reduced to 500-2000 renown, increasing as you unlock more. 
---
Standard Edition (Old): first 20 ops. New operators cost 25k renown, though there might be a discount on Y1 ops or something. If you have this, you will be upgraded to the Base edition (mainly just changes unlock prices for legacy ops you haven't yet unlocked).
---
Deluxe Edition (New): Base Game + the eight Y1 operators. Should have the same (downscaled) renown costs for legacy ops.
---
Gold Edition (New): Deluxe Edition + Year 4 Pass (early access to the eight new Y4 operators as they're released) + 600 R6 credits + 10% shop discount.
---
Complete Edition (New): All the things. All DLC operators unlocked + Y4 pass.
---
We need doors
---
Idk and idc about those people. I like IQ's elite and I want this one too
---
Friends may be useful to have in case of any toxic teammates
---
&gt;"3 speeds with a shotgun would be overpowered! Especially with an auto shotty!"
---
&gt;"Thermite players would start rushing in and dying!"
---
it saddens me that you have to actually explain these 2 concepts. people in this subreddit are really underinformed about their game compared to other subreddits.
---
which is Dok's invitational headgear
---
Like you go easy on your fellow coppers?
---
That is literally the lowest rank, what do you expect, proleague plays?
---
The macro here is the Q E lean spamming, not anything to do with fire rate. Watch the hall camera footage of when Monty drops his shield (compared to the killcam) and see the difference between his spastic leaning for other players compared to his perspective that barely moves.
---
We all know what this image also means 
---
Would love    a   hospital,   but  please, no more haunted houses, I  want a non-depressing  map after  the new Bartlett  and Theme Park.
---
Make sure you don’t have sensitivity on high in game. Use under half of the sensitivity in game. So for low sensitivity use high mouse dpi and low game sensitivity. Its more accurate. Also have a good mouse. A mouse in my opinion is more important than a keyboard. 
---
You say this like ash, twitch, and jackal dont have good win and pick rates. Which are beaten out by doc and rook...who win fights cause the mp5 is good. The better the gun the more that operator will win and be picked. Look at capitao he has the worst ar in the game but his gadget has lots of utility doesnt help his pickrate or winrate. The only difference is if thermite had the r4c people would get angry if you die reguardless because it would jack up thermites win and pick rate. And tbh even if you dont rush and you die without using your charge its not like your team is guaranteed to lose. Also roamings not hard youve just gotta master sound control. I think a better nerf for ash would be slightly increasing the recoil of the r4c making it slightly worse and meaning people wont just switch to the other gun immediatly.
---
Hello SpicyBoiWillKillYou, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/arm5m0/they_think_im_hacking/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**

And  people were justified in wanting the  developer  to create a map  using specific,  already existing assets. It's the  developer  who  dropped the  ball.

Rainbow Harry : Siege
---
1
---
That just general knowledge for anywhere
---
Use Kaids shotgun its viable amd so good on pc
---
Ok? Sounds like one of you isn't telling the whole truth.
---
Crossover confirmed
---
it's her invitational headgear as well
---
/r/CatsAreAssholes 
---
What about simply Increasing the recoil significantly? This could be a solution on Console,  not sure if on PC.
---
Also Fuze 2 speed wouldn't be OP, in fact, I think he should be 2 speed, the only time he should be 1 speed is if he's using shield. 
---
Of course I respect your opinion! I'm here for discussion, not insults. What I can say though is that I feel you are giving the R4C a lot more credit than it deserves. Yes, it is a powerful gun, but you have to take into account the other factors that play into the power of a gun. The best example for this is the AK-12. That is a MONSTER of a gun, one of the best guns out there. The reason it does not seem as powerful as it is, is because it is tied to a lumbering 1 speed that would lose a race to a snail. The complete mirror if that is the R4C. Also an extremely powerful gun overall, but its power comes from the fact that it is tied not only to a 3 speed, but a small 3 speed that can play with abandon because if her utility having such little value before your vertical player dies. Putting it onto Thermite would give him a powerful gun, yes, but it would no longer overpower the G36 (an already good gun that is just overshadowed by its older brother.), and would become a sidegrade to the 556, an already powerful gun in its own ways. It also would not be able to see its biggest interaction at the moment, being rushing. You cannot rush with Thermite, there is too much risk there.
---
As for why a hard breacher? I didn't ask myself that specific question, I asked myself these questions instead:
---
1.How can I keep guns from being changed on a statline to save time?
---
2. How can I keep the guns of a CTU individual to them?
---
3. How can I create better options for multiple operators without changing the fundamentals of the game beyond reason?
---
4. How can I create in game diversity in playstyles and loadouts without adding or removing anything?
---
With me asking those questions, only two thoughts came up, and one I felt was completely out of the question (which unsurprisingly was brought up by someone else on this sub with actual support) being "Why not give her the UMP?" Simple reason for that is because that will REMOVE the R4C from the game (outside recruit) and give her an even stronger ability to rush with an angled grip SMG ADS time (which reminds me, all weapons that share a weapon class share an ADS time since the F2 damage nerf update. the R4C is not faster than any other AR, and is actually slower without an angled foregrip.) and no recoil to have to control, at the possible cost of losing the ACOG ability anyways. The other option was to give Thermite the R4C to keep it in game, in the same CTU, and to replace his currently terrible second "choice" of a gun with something that he can actually choose to use. I hope that helps!
---
So they switched up Grim Sky and Wind Bastion, annnnnnnnd, they wrote wind bastion as win bastion
---
Middle click as either gadget or equipment helps

You hit nothing and her uniform mostly, the model you see isn't the exact hit box

Next season. The seasons last three months.
---
Context plays into that. Hibana also has access to a very high damage pistol, and a machine pistol. She also has soft breaching capability and flashbangs like Ash, but the Type 89 being on a 3 speed with access to another automatic weapon to support its lack of ammo in a mag is what pushes it slightly further than the R4C.
---
YIBOMBE!!
---
Isn’t middle automatically gadget?  
---
Fuze as 2 speed would be fine considering Twitch and Jackal have better guns
---
SWAT and military use abandoned structures to train all the time. Before it was torn down Tigers Stadium in Detroit was used by local and federal police from around the country to train for stadium/arena situations
---
I couldn't tell what the final OP flag was, it looked like the Iranian flag?
---
Same. As an OG,I wish they would've utilized Idris more as well
---
i can control the recoil for most guns. especially if i strafe at the same time. what sensitivity do you play at?
---
So much hype, actually excite for all these changes.
---
WE FINALLY HAVE PICK AND BAN IN RANKED!
---
I didn’t know I was apparently a man.

Holy crap, Year 4 looks like it may be the best year yet.
---
me i wish that were god

no one ever said that.

I am excited for the map reworks.

Just don't repeat what you did to Hereford. Just make it like Clubhouse.
---
Yes, México, finally 
---
Because you can't buy 1 credit, obligating you to buy a larger amount. Then, you'll be short 1 credit for an item, onligating you to start the process over.

Six the title given to the head of operations for Rainbow. The person who essentially runs and manages the organization. Think head of CIA, but for an international counter terrorism organization.
---
does Ying really need a rework? Dokki can do with some slight changes but what? can someone explain?
---
Thats still harder than shooting you right away.
---
Lol yea I kinda wish I had a PS4 just cuz of Spider-Man and also cuz it’s just better, but I’m just fine with Xbox as well

The Dark sign brands the undead and in this land, the undead are corralled and led to the north where they are locked away to await the end of the world. This is your fate.

What do you guys think about the new teamkill system? 
---
It looks like you get ONE accidental TK or 100 Health of DMG before it kicks in, so you have some leeway. 
---
India and Kenya
---
It looks like it only starts after the first team kill.
---
So two people would have to run in front of you.

YES. YES. YES. That was my first thought

Can they please please please do something about mouse and keyboard in console!

Indian and kenyan
---
Most people say that

i remember posting on here that shooting a teammate shoots yourself and everyone who saw it downvoted and shittalked me until i deleted it. BOOM! what now?

I think everyone going to be saying it now as there is going to be an American in 4 different units. 2 more than any other country.

* Casual timer changed from 4mins to 3:30.
---
* You can pick your spawn points in casual.
---
* Consulate and Kanal getting map reworks. 
---
A mechanical system to prevent teamkilling and trolling is impossible, you can never cover all possibilities. This makes it impossible for tk-ers to keep teamkilling and then just lowering everyone else's hp.
---
So if I see a team mate shooting, I can just run in front of them and they will kill themselves? Yeah that's not exploitable at all.

Mad love to anyone who can control the recoil, it's a really difficult thing to do. But most people can't, but use the ACOG anyway. Though on some guns it's a lot easier than others. 
---
Villa and Hereford I just can’t wrap my head around. 
---
If it still lets you kill the first person with nothing happening to you it wont help you can only team kill one person now

Yeah, this is the older sister. He’s fine. Good kid, good grades, all that jazz. We have pizza night as a family once a week. Very wholesome. 
---
Theme park rework? Seriously? That map is not bad enough that we should lose a whole new map for it. I don’t know why the Devs want to keep lowering the amount of new maps but it’s really not good for the games continued growth and from a players perspective it’s downright bad.

Rework of Operators: Dokkaebi, Ying, Glaz, Lion, Capitão
---
Looks like it's only after they've already team-killed somebody. 
---
I missed It does anyone have a screenshot of the roadmap?
---
What does reversed damage for attempted team kills mean?
---
She’s insane right now. Ban Jäger in scrims and tell me she isn’t. You can clear a whole room before anyone has a chance to do anything because they’ll all be blinded. 
---
Was that a new rank after diamond? It looked pink.
---
Czech operator Y5 for sure. Kapp

Reversed damage is such a flawed way to deal with Team Killing. Firstly what's to stop trolls running into my C4/Breaching Charges/Gunfire? Secondly how do we combat hackers on our own team? Team killing hackers is the only way we can currently deal with them, as we know they don't get banned. I'm really disappointed with this "solution".

He did get at just under half his shots on her chest or just below it though.

No they have to kill someone on your team before it does damage to them
---
As a newer Thatcher player, what primary do you use? 
---
Yeah but i was just trying to play i thoyght maybe they accidently bumped the trigger but then they would shoot me pick me up then shoot me again
---
**Hello Nico8323, your submission has been removed as submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**
---
I disagree entirely. 1 new map a year is beyond too low. Besides a map like Theme park doesn’t need a rework as badly as some of the casual only maps. Their essentially taking content away and replacing it vs adding new content.
---
Yeah, i was hoping for a Swedish operator this year though :(
---
I'm super happy to see a Danish OP. But I am with you as the US one seem a bit odd. Would had made more sense to do another scandinavian OPs.
---
This game fucking needs it. I might buy the season pass though knowing it’s getting balanced
---
Well that roadmap fucking sucks.
---
**Hello Captain_Hawkeye8, your submission has been removed as submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**

It’s still a stupid idea, the devs just happen to agree with you lol. Glad you feel validated though.
---
Seems like you were right
---
Not sure if satire
---
That roadmap... disappointing.
---
fuck off with your shitty rifle shields and black eyes
---
The mid-season events seem to be a great introduction, just hope they're not just ploys to try sell you $50 worth of cosmetics.
---
Because the US has one of the widest and most diverse selections of police and military forces to pick from compared to the rest of the world. Literally every single combat scenario and situation possible in the world exists in the US because of it's huge size and diverse ecological mixture AND the fact that we fight literally everywhere on the planet, so we have to have something for literally every single situation on the planet so we have a lot of forces it's super easy to pick from.
---
this is no the 8th american op. While making everyone else in this year share their season
---
Theme Park is getting a rework as well

What the fuck. Why is this comment all in bold? What's with the quote at the bottom? Is this the kind of shit we're going to be flooded with now Siege has an Indian operator? 
---
Another American LMAO 
---
I think they overturned the deployable shields a bit too much, it's like a portable mira now if you think about it.
---
I actually would like a suit operator
---
That is I don’t know. Just hoping for more diversity in ops pool.  
---
I’m probably just not up to date but what the hell?!
---
As a 3 armor main this shield buff is welcome news
---
As I mentioned frost only affects one player. Ash is used in the rush destroys barbed wire. Nitro cell isn’t reliable enough against a full on rush. The rush ops almost all counter clash. And flanking relies on one player to pull through and they can’t cover every entrance. I’m not sure what’s wrong with an op that’ll counter a rush?
---
Frankly, i really don't care as long as they play well
---
Hello The_YellowBacon, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/arn9rt/crashes_instantly/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
I meant accidentally as in, I've had people run in front of my bullets before and my reticle happened to be the height of their head
---
So you must run certain operators every round irrespective of the strategy your team is trying to employ? 
---
I'm Pakistani and disappointed. Maybe next year :(
---
&gt;We've known for a while Lion's been getting changed what are you talking about? Dokkabie has basically been known to have been worked on for about a month. And how will this be the biggest thing to ever happen to Siege when the game is still littered with problems. And cut that 45 million in half as I know for a fact about half of those accounts are people buying the game and you know that too so shut your mouth.
---
Yo headass, we have known for a long time that lion is getting reworked and Dok was getting Nerfs and kafe was getting reworked, but did you know **WHAT THE REWORK WAS**? No, right? So shut it and get some common sense first.
---
As for the 45, 1 out of even 22.5 wouldn't even make a dent in a dent, so, like I said, show yourself out if you disapprove. PUBG could desperately use some new players.
---
That’s exactly what it is. Multiplayer is just simulated terror events for the CTU operators to practice against. The whole thing is a simulation; nobody “dies”, no legit shots are fired, it’s basically a super super high tech VR simulation. 
---
That’s how I’ve seen it explained, anyways, since I think that’s how it works in the books. 
---
That room looks alot like my basement and I got really confused
---
I’d argue that pulses would be used in a mission 
---
But you could hold an angle like that without exposing your head (unless first person view leans slower too). In concerned since they made clear this is a first iteration of a fix they won't do that.
---
It’s not going to be in check without having the statistics changed.
---
in CS they are constantly testing new maps in the ranked pool and the least popular one get swapped for new ones and so on
---
How would it break the balance? If both sides had friendly fire turned off
---
Exactly. You get more time then those who paid reduced prices to pay with the ops so stop bitching ffs
---
It's hard to rework these maps without fundamentally changing them so it's easier to rework a map that is already somewhat competitive to make it even better
---
They should name “Top Players” category Champion 
---
Good write-up, and definitely an idea worth exploring. The concept is solid: make Ash less insanely flexible, while simultaneously helping out Thermite, who is currently the odd one out among the hard breachers for being slower, having the least flexible, most counterable, most dangerous to place gadget AND having a slower (thus arguably worse) gun than both of the others. It would be excellent if we could try a change like this on the test server to see how it plays out in practice.
---
In general, I feel like weapon re-shuffles are an idea that Ubi should look at more seriously as a means of balancing. It might be used as a factor in the Lion re-work, for example: Give him a much more situational gadget, but balance it out by giving him the F2, leaving Twitch with the V308 in turn (There's a reason why her pick rate is second only to Ash; her gadget provides so much unique and irreplaceable utility that it's hard to see why she needs to have arguably the best gun in the game too).
---
I wonder if they'll be adding decay to ranks.
---
*boy
---
it only kicks in after one tk
---
Where did u got that info from ?
---
Do we know if the reverse friendly fire will activate for downing someone? If not, Cav trolls will still be able to down the entire team then leave. Hell, people will still be able to troll by trying to obstruct someone's view to get them in reverse friendly fire mode for the rest of the match. I always look at anti-trolling measures through the eyes of a troll, thinking "How can I break/abuse this?", because that's sure as shit what they're doing.
---
&gt;Isn't it time they turned off friendly fire?
---
But they kind of did. If you kill a teammate, the rest of them become immune to friendly fire *from you*. This is going to lead to all kinds of abuse. Deliberately kill a teammate in one round. Then in the next round, you could place a Fuze charge and have your team breach into the room as it goes off. Sure, you'll die but they will have an excellent breach and not have to worry about getting killed by your pucks. The enemy team will be confused and/or running from your charge.
---
Yeah nothing in seige is automatic... It'll lower the skill cap
---
Its a placeholder. Itll look bad if u put duplicate picture of a defender.
---
They were prolly below 50 hp
---
No. We can’t agree. 
---
Focus on the main game first. 
---
So then what does it show? A jackal-like ping? 
---
Yes you're right, I would have been very happy with another danish op too. It's just that looking at the originial roster, Germany has never gotten a new op whereas we had Clash for the UK, Finka for Russia, Lion for France and a ton of other ops for the US :) .
---
&gt;Reversed damage for friendly fire
---
&gt;Mode activates after first team kill
---
&gt;Forgive option for team kills teased
---
Does the forgive option allow for the self damage to not occur? The amount of times I've had teammates accidentally walk in front of me while shooting and die is crazy, I'd hate for it to mean that I automatically die as well if it happens more than once.
---
This seems a bit odd to me too
---
Be honest. You’re using a laser pointer lol!
---
And whip out the mighty M59
---
Friendly reminder: as /u/UbiJustin stated, it's a work in progress. Be sure to head over to /r/Rainbow6TTS when it goes live and give you feedback on the change 
---
Nah its too out there. Id rather not.
---
Does it really matter? I've never chosen an op based on nationality. With that being said there are still plenty countries they could choose from. 
---
They are both trappers so your either choosing slow down concussion mines or invisible poison mines that disable sprint.
---
When they were previewing the reworks, Mute and Mira had black holos. I posted it, but the mods removed it. 
---
but you can watch both sides through it.
---
But I get what you mean.
---
All of these changes are SUPERB.  I especially like how Ranked will get the Pick &amp; Ban system standard now.  And Newcomer mode will prevent elite players from jumping in to stomp newbies (though brand new smurfs will still get through).
---
I may not play regularly, but I give a thumbs up to all of this for sure!
---
I haven't been so excited for a game since the Cyberpunk gameplay. Going to have to relax lol.
---
Okay. Let us assume this would work. This would still waste more time and, therefore, be a left to attackers and a buff to defenders, which is the last thing that needs to happen. 
---
Rainbow Harry: Siege confirmed.
---
&gt;Ash is more OP than Nomad, according to graphs though.
---
This isn't about the graphs. As ubi said, the graphs are a SMALL part of the data they collect. This is about pro feedback, from thosr who play this 16 hours a day, and have 12000 hours work of experience in it to make the right decisions. She takes too much control away with near 0 counter play. She's what lion was.
---
&gt;Oh,what about  Ela which was so broken that now you can’t play her adequately?
---
Ela is fine where she is. 3 mines that are basically powerful, a crazy shotgun, and a 1080 rpm gun. Recoil could use a buff, but other than that, she's the.
---
Please take Vote Kick out of casual. It is used for nothing but toxicity and should have been taken out years ago 
---
I ctrl + F'd "teamkill" and didn't see anything about that.
---
Sum'bitch*
---
Not what I’m saying, I’m saying have a support operator who can be safe while watching common spawn peeks so that their teams utility like hard breaches, thatcher, etc won’t be the ones to get peeked. Most team should have a support player and that support player should watch for spawn peeks 
---
Is that hat for sale?
---
Theyre still gonna get that free tk on you..  Not sure how this makes it better.  I think there should be NO leeway. If you accidentally headshot someone you should take the fall not them.  Its fair.
---
She definitely needs a buff. It shouldn’t be frustrating to use a weapon on operator!!!!
---
Finally ! After 4 years of suffering 
---
Sniffle sniffle.
---
Personally I’m not going to be happy until ela reflects personal skill
---
I know you can watch both sides but the windows are soo small that attackers far from the shield will have a really hard time seeing through it had bad lightning. We'll see how it works out in the future though
---
He must have gotten it from somewhere
---
You wouldn't have to check your fire. Imagine having a Monty in front and a friendly with an LMG behind him. Just start shooting into Monty's back before you peek. Toss a grenade into a room and have someone follow it in. Chuck a Nitro at your Clash's feet.
---
Wow. You're a greedy fuck.
---
wOt m8?
---
Test server comes out tomorrow, so 3 weeks from tomorrow. There will be a panel about the new season later today.
---
sure the guns and gadget is what matter. But the nationality opens lots of looks, flavour and stuff for the character, like you said buck has some neat costumes because he go canadian looking shit
---
Im american so i dont know every single state in africa (obviously)
---
Was this released in the vid-doc?
---
Low sense, big mousepad, 144hz monitor, lots of thunt.
---
ops get cheaper as time goes on
---
Sorry yeah I meant to say Kanal.
---
The other two seems more like a wall being shifted here and there...
---
Yeah. sorry. Thats what I meant
---
Do you all go to dealerships and beg for reimbursement when the new model of your car comes out? No? Then go fuck yourselves.
---
She does.
---
Just not at all levels.
---
Oh god oh fuck
---
What about boosting ? 
---
That's your opinion and I respect it, but like I said before:
---
&gt;Germany has never gotten a new op whereas we had Clash for the UK, Finka for Russia, Lion for France and a ton of other ops for the US :) .
---
Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of countries which are most certainly not or at least underrepresented and I would be just as happy to see some new operators for these countries as well. It's just that we already got 7 US ops in the game which is IMHO enough for now.
---
Are they gonna release 1 Map only for this year?
---
Maybe next year buddy
---
I only got the one (I haven’t been into the game too much lately) but I got the dokkaebi headgear so that’s cool 
---
They can disable teamkill bans in proleague, so it's not an issue.
---
Another American operator. While people were waiting for Israeli, Turkish or Swedish ops. At least Indian people will get what they wanted.
---
“Stab me, sexy”
---
6 was person who was in charge of rainbow correct? What happened to her if that guy said she left some shoes to fill. Did something happen to her. Sorry but I’m genuinely confused. Also haven’t played in a while
---
i saw it on stream but its from coreross video
---
Wait, are you on console?
---
Because controlling recoil on console is an issue, but the shotgun is OP on all platforms.
---
Honestly, there is something truly wrong with a person who is a high level player and smurfs to play in a new comers playlist. Like deeply, psychologically wrong.
---
I really hope this is a set-up for an actual campaign, or something like it.
---
I know Ubi said they didn't plan on doing it, but by god, I hope they changed their minds.
---
Just record the guy who's cheating and submit the video to Ubisoft they'll have his account banned.
---
No Anti-Cheat can stop cracked accounts they are dirt cheap and easily accessible to anyone.
---
Fabian is Swedish.
---
They wont, you just wont be able to buy them 
---
He's barely useful/powerful on console in his current condition. Imagine after this nerf. 
---
He'll be Ok on PC I reckon. 
---
Im not quite sure what your expecting from an operator that will counter a rush? Use a castle to funnel people. Frost has 3 mats. Use mute to counter lion dokkie. Use a smoke to keep people back. Finka = smonk buffs. Clah is designed to be a nuisance to sheilds like blitz. What tool do you want that dosent exist? Destroying barbwire wish ash charges is one way to use them. But takes time and makes a lot of noise
---
New Rank above diamond? 
---
PC
---
Scorpion is bad on PC too. You just cant shoot this thing beyond 10 meters. This is ridiculous. 
---
As the ops get that old and with release of y4s1 for it yo start 
---
he still has a ton of potential. he can easily locate roamers and hunt people down
---
&gt;I’m scared to even destroy a claymore when I’m flanking
---
Yeah, that's the entire point of claymores.

**Hello HarrierGR9, your submission has been removed as submissions to r/Rainbow6 are currently locked down.**

When will the operator price changes take effect on live servers?
---
I think if you stay put it doesn't deal more damage, it only does damage when you walk through them.
---
I have the normal elite... I would buy this one too!
---
When is the Lion, Glaz and Deployable shield coming in?
---
I understand your POV but almost competitive is still not competitive especially that most pro players don't like theme house and it wasn't added to the PL map pool. The priority is to add ONE map to the map pool and make it competitive, to do this the smartest and most effective solution is to take a map that has good fundamentals and tweak it to make it perfect, and let's admit it house and plane are never going to be competitive without a complete overhaul

So Gridlock has a mag-fed M249? I hope Ubi kept it realistic and makes it jam every 5th round lol...
---
True, but you need to shoot or bomb to destroy them, which means you give a sound cue to attackers about where you are.
---
Eitherways, you are "noticed".
---
fake
---
I know but they can give you more
---
He means the operators
---
Smoke, rook, and Castle icons are absolutely great
---
&lt;3
---
Operators not gun skin.
---
They usually do get some sort of nerf. Gotta make'em super OP at the start to get all the early $$$ in. 
---
They said they would go into detail at the invitational
---
Probably what number they are on the leaderboard. So like a top 500 type of thing.
---
Must check that. Thanks for telling me.

If you want to use her first name, in English it'd be Grace, in Korean it'd be Eun Hye.

Except it wouldn't be a sidegrade with this change. Every Thermite player would just switch to the R4C and abandon his other rifle because fire rate trumps damage in this game.

so when are the new renown prices for operators gonna be up?
---
Is the Pick and Ban/ranked coming out of beta for Y4S1 or just announced that it’s happening?
---
Confirmed, MI and R6 share a universe
---
Nice reference to Crocodile Dundee with that poster "This is not a knife" on new map
---
I don’t think you got my point
---
That would cause a war among the fanbase and makes no sense give that they are still in a tumultuous relationship. I think an Indian and Bangladeshi op would've made more sense.
---
I think is just a placeholder because this rank just got introduced.
---
Also, all rank from Diamond and below have a star in place of a question mark.
---
Mozzie as a 2 speed makes no sense to me. His behaviour and lore clearly paint him as a 3 speed ADHD operator. And his skills match that too with drones to help him roam. 
---
Kill cams are completely necessary since those are the only sure shot way to identify a hacker.
---
Nomad is more powerful. You need one impact for either but you can hide an airjab.
---
He almost choked that with the failed knife XD
---
The Lord‘s influence grows. 
---
No word on any new Pilot Program team uniforms and kits? For like Reciprocity, SSG, G2, Nora Rengo, or LATAM teams?
---
How is Hibana overdue? She’s still a fairly new operator in comparison to some that still don’t have an elite.
---
They are 1 hit kill for each one why are you crying kid 
---
Did they forget Mozzie's and Gridlock's Year pass skins, or I missed it?
---
Mozzie 2*
---
Kill cans are completely necessary since those are the only sure shot way to identify a hacker.
---
We need them.
---
The ultimate NO U
---
Hasn’t it always been one elite per event?
---
I'm sure we'll find some seriously good use for it.
---
Pretty sure I heard the dev say the us is secret service
---
Omg I have a reason to be excited for siege again! Meaningful and plentiful improvements and balancing changes :D
---
It is a Commando 9, AR15/M16 platform rechambered for 9mm pistol rounds, With the short barrel it is closer to an SMG then an AR.
---
So they shoot a guy at the start of the round. Solved.
---
did they explain how they will work? toggle or buyable? i missed it
---
Thanks!

She's a bodybuilder pre-bodybuilding.

Leision in everyway possible is better than Ela, other than thighs
---
I’m ok with this honestly shields are wack as fuck
---
Mute and mozzie are defenders so no
---
Gat
---
I feel I've seen two before in some seasons. Either way only one elite is too slow with how many ops they have.

Ubisoft is the best game developer. Fuck Blizzard. Fuck EA. Ubisoft forever &lt;3
---
I honestly think hes fine for nerfs BB I mean. But his mecgmhanic which grts rid of the 1 shot headshot ability is just fundementally broken, Ash needs to have the R4-C nerfed more ir the G36C buffed as just getting rid of a scope is nothing ss Im decent with mostly every op but I never use acog. Lion is just annoying on all playing fields. The idea of a info attacking op is good but the way they did it is annoying. And what you said at first just made it sound the way I said it did. Not meaning to make it what you meant.

You should've pet your cat.

Lmao!

Coconut Brah: Hold my beer

Also same mobility rate. Tbh the only downside is the long reload time. Other than that recoil and damage is the same if not better than the Para. 
---
I would love that
---
FINALLY ANOTHER 3 ARMOR ATTACKER
---
So you want to bring back the acog on two operators that were too powerful with it just because you still get spawn peaked?
---
Doc, Echo and Rook are 1 speed operators. Jaeger and Bandit are 3 speed. See the difference?
---
😂😂 you was just as much use in the grave lol
---
&gt; The UKSF are easily the best special forces
---
This is one of the dumbest things people say. There is no 'best'. There are a bunch of groups that provide differing operational force.
---
&gt;storming a hotel by himself
---
The Kenya attack? His identity and unit are unknown. He could be UKSF, SOCOM, CANSOFCOM, Academi, or any other unit in the world, but it has nothing to do with a unit, but a single operator.
---
&gt;There’s also the fact that another potential nation was sidelined for yet another American.
---
R6 can only be NATO and Israelis.
---
&gt;Let’s cover every other country that we want first, before going back to the US.
---
Most of the ops in every R6 game and the book are US and UK ops.
---
Holy shit a M249. Can you imagine the chaos? 
---
The third skin is most likely bugged, it looks like an untextured model and from what I've seen from other gameplays light reacts differently to it.
---
Damn, do we have their loadouts yet? Also why is the last skin just white?
---
What actual CTU doesn't exist that we should have?
---
Kind of like House, unfortunately. I think the size of the map was what was detrimental in it feeling "unbalanced". At least that's how it felt/feels to play those maps.
---
American? The one American since Dust Line in Year 1 and it’s not Year 4? 
---
idk, 30 fps at low settings may be
---
Big Nerf for Attacking OPs
---
So now we're basing the game off of reality?
---
Hehe :D
---
Low settings, 640×512 at 30 FPS.
---
Its sad that we're getting yet another american op 
---
Am I seriously the only person that still enjoys the Lord memes? Hell its still the only skin I rock on the big man. Oh well long live Lord T ^_^
---
That's true
---
I see Ubisoft is still desperately avoiding controversy by adding any middle eastern squads. Nevermind that Israel was part of the original rainbow 6.
---
dude that’s the Bikini Bodhi strat 
---
Why does her arm movement look so weird lmao
---
It reminds me of the Splinter Cell Blacklist mobile game, not sure if anybody knows or remembers that.
---
Yeah.... no....
---
This won't do anything good at all
---
Oh shit man, best of luck! Happy for ya :)
---
Now that's a knife
---
lmao bit late for that. 3 months is not a lot of time
---
Oh, either way, it still doesn't matter. It's just a coincidence. This is on LAN with admins checking the PCs constantly. There's no hacks or anything at play.
---
SS Operators
---
Yes all the load outs were revealed and I believed pinned at the top of the reddit also the last skin I believe is bugged atm
---
Was about to ask why you were playing r6 on a telly and then remembered it's a console game too please don't hurt me 
---
Montaigne, Castle, Tachanka, and Buck elites would all complete a CTU as well. As cool as hibana is, id like to see one of them soon.
---
Ah sweet thanks :D
---
D R U G S
---
In all seriousness though, it’s probably gonna be him when he was undercover.
---
That'd be pretty sick, I back that 100% :)
---
Doesn't matter. What matters is that it won't leave you exposed for so long making it a nice option.
---
Balance&gt;Realism
---
hey guys check out how big my internet techno dick is
---
some people probably play on that resolution with better hardware than OP for the advantage lol
---
do you know if the owners of the Standard Edition are getting an upgrade ?
---
The Commando is a carbine, isn't it? This might be a gun with high dmg like Jägers, just saying
---
1. Spam smoke, trax, and firebolts into bombsite
---
2. plant diffuser with glaz watching 
---
3. ?????
---
4. Profit 
---
That´s the cutest fucking thing I´ve ever seen in my life.
---
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. xDDDDDDD
---
Why would anyone downvote this factual statement? It’s in her bio.
---
r/FuckYouKaren
---
someone at blizzard is projecting
---
The UK special forces as a whole are the best is what I’m saying, sorry I failed to clarify that. As in, the SAS, is easily the best counter terrorist force.
---
The dude in Kenya was confirmed as SAS, if you read the news. 
---
The other operator could have been from Sweden, or Finland etc. Not necessarily American.
---
The books aren’t really used as source material for siege. 
---
it's not just rainbow and mission impossible. [hitman series used this metaphor as well](https://youtu.be/YfcW0P-fm98?t=200)
---
I would be SUPER surprised if it means you can't vault over it. My guess would be that it just covers MOST doors in width. Wouldn't it be borderline OP with seethrough mirrors (mini mira), anti glaz AND it would semi castle a door as well?
---
Hey thanks mate, yeah I am female if it's that what you mean :D 
---
In this game the learning curve is pretty much amazing, so you become better the more you play and the more you play the more you enjoy it and you get passionate about it.
---
Edition upgrade? No.
---
Tatchanka, montage, smoke, bandit and castle they all wait they elite skin. Ubi plz elite skin need tachanka
---
20 rounds rn
---
Big fan of rally so the third skin is a must for me
---
I think the switch to PC is pretty implied. I value screen size over input lag (which can be negligible imo) and wouldn't want to do all of my gaming on a TV half the size. Sometimes it's more important to be able to see the finer details
---
I think they're reworking Kanal &amp; Theme Park to replace Chalet from the PL Map set, then next year Chalet gets in for a rework, in addition to Favela and maybe Skycraper
---
What looks different to you?
---
Oh boii this is dumb. Yes swap the R4C or something else, what’s gonna happen? Ash will get nerfed into oblivion and some other op will take her place. Sure not the same extremes but it happens, when someone gets buffed or nerfed an operator will take another’s place. 
---
Ye unfortunetly it’s only for mozzie and not a universal 
---

---
You might want to slow down the video to see it better
---
Because putting a glock in a game is expensive
---
play on low settings and get yourself a 240 hz monitor and enjoy the 240 fps
---
Same man 
---
There's a camera rig in front of it.
---
You could get a cheaper CPU. I have similar but maybe slightly worse specs (ryzen 2600, 1070 Ti) and I get like 120 frames at 1440p
---
I'm American and I agree. Too much freedom.
---
I now see the “fluff” tag. Carry on.
---
I appreciate Ubisoft for implementing Kenyan/Indian operators. They should add even more exotic operators, maybe Iranian IRGC ops or Pakistani ISI ops. They should give more love to Scandinavian countries too they are so underrepresented it's saddening :( 
---
&gt; The UK special forces as a whole are the best is what I’m saying
---
What? That still doesn't mean anything, because there is no 'best'.
---
&gt;As in, the SAS, is easily the best counter terrorist force.
---
You think CT is the only special operations that exist?
---
&gt;The dude in Kenya was confirmed as SAS, if you read the news. 
---
He was not, because that would break OPSEC.
---
&gt;The books aren’t really used as source material for siege. 
---
It is.. there is also only one book.
---
How is THIS being praised as a high upvoted comment and NOT the forgiveness teaser? That would be wonderful, especially if someone tk's you 2 times by accident. Instead of getting instantly kicked,, you can actually forgive them IF it truly was on accident. Especially more so if it's in ranked and you have to play in a 4v5
---
Likely as we have azure in India 
---
Also that her name is Tina Lin Tsang.

&gt;As in, does one team have to win by 2 rounds to lock it out? Can this map just go on endlessly?
---
Yes and yes. We seeing this unlimited overtime format for the first time right now.
---
If this happens, there better be a "Don't dead open inside" somewhere
---
You can get large sized monitors that are the same size of a TV, but I guess it comes down to price at that point
---
so like a i5-8400? 
---
At least we're getting operators from 6 different countries this year.
---
i dont know your mainboard manufacturer... msi or gigabyte yes, but not sure about asus
---
However they are going to be bringing it into ranked
---
74% attacker sided, gg ubisoft
---
so am I, Zofia has become one of my main attacking operators. 
---
Lion being useless? Have you never played a game of ranked against a coordinated team? He wins games just at a touch of a button. 
---
I don’t like lean and crouch spamming as much as the next guy, but you laid out your arguments really well.
---
On a case by case basis I absolutely love unintended game mechanics that enhances a certain play style. My favorites are no-scoping in CoD4 and wall jumping with LUCIO in overwatch, although the latter got a lot of support from blizzard so not really a good example.
---
Laughs in Doc
---
Could be a Recruit reskin...
---
I Don’t want to make you think I’m shitting on Portugal but their special forces don’t really need to be in the game. They aren’t really used in real life compared to us france, Germany etc. I would love to go to Portugal at some point I my life but compared to Brazil who deals with cartels and a numerous of other issues, their ctus face more combat 
---
And yet it's useable space, no one says attackers have to blindly run to the buildings 
---
They're using it ironically, captain spergo
---
Wishing all the best! Congratulations in advance mate
---
I have crouching and mark enemies on the same key since both actions don’t block each other.
---
Its a Japanese form of martial art, which is used primarily for recreation and relaxation, the bow is far to large to be viable in combat but perfect for recreational use. 
---
That was the joke lol shes telling Thatcher to fuck off basically.
---
Yeah I know, it would be extremely dumb as well.  But I’m just pointing it out. 
---
Ew console.
---
Well does Australia do combat? 
---
The only hope of such a thing will be for Y5 with Burnt Horizon having the only new map this year. Maybe they could use something like this in one of the game mode events that they have promised in every Season. Fingers crossed
---
Its also the same bow we see in the CGI short movie that came out yesterday. I thought it was cool.
---
Interesting that Kanal is getting a rework before skyscraper or chalet. Both could use one and are already in ranked. But Kanal being put into ranked alongside a reworked Kafe and Theme Park would make for a very diverse and fun to play map pool.
---
i think this looks fine
---
Stuff takes time man. I finally got into the game in 2017. It took a hot minute before I'm able to carry my own weight. I can be better but I feel like I'm in a comfortable spot now. I definitely play better with friends or when talking on comms. Just keep at it, learn from mistakes, and talk more my guy.
---
They said the us op would be apart of the secret service
---
Ubi doesn't care about implementing the gadgets in TH, what a surprise.
---
*In other news:* Shocking! Fire found to be hot!
---
I wouldn’t be surprised to see a legit delta force duo down the road, i mean yeah Maverick is former Delta but he was apart of a fictional “Grim Sky” team. So i wouldn’t be surprised at all eventually 
---
Potato fest. I also cringed hard when Kanto miss a jumpshot earlier that match 
---
Lol you’re mad about that. If you’re og you had to pay for the original CTUs AND their attachments. I should get my renown back for buying all original CTUS and the attachments 
---
None of that is skillful. Go fuck off twat
---
[https://youtu.be/M9x\_koRZ2bA?t=296](https://youtu.be/M9x_koRZ2bA?t=296) 
---
Revealed in the Six Invitational Final Stream, along with many other changes. Highly recommend watching 
---
So is the reverse team kill based on killing the first teammate and not the amount of damage a griefer deals to teammates as a whole? So theoretically a griefer could damage teammates to a near death state and this reverse damage would not be activated unless they actually kill someone. I hope this is not the case cuz people have already been circumventing the team killing by just damaging teammates so they are at a clear disadvantage in gunfights with little to no health.  
---
Title spoils the punchline unfortunately 
---
I tried it, and it wasn't too effective. Maybe it's because I never play Valkyrie, but it's a pain to get the Black Eye into a decent spot. And even then, the Black Eye is easy to spot and doesn't see much of the tunnel. But it could work.
---
Not sure how I feel about reflecting damage and trolls getting a teamkill for free. Why not introduce a forgive or punish system? 
---
I've done this in there have been one or two times where it's so obvious that the person I'm chatting with straight up tells me the person is getting banned.
---
As if Ubi ever cared about implementing the new ops in TH.
---
Libtard rekt 😎😎😎
---
OOF 
---
Hello official_snowflake,
---
Hello sgtManbat,
---
I mean more Cav specifically
---
And pro league is on pc? No shooter should be balanced around a controller
---
What do you think they do on console. 
---
Don’t die.
---
Agree. I think it would be more balanced if it worked as regular bulletproof glass instead. It would still be favourable for the defender because he's closer to the "window" so he can see more but attackers would be able to tell if someone was behind the shield. We'll see if it is OP when the update arrives I guess.  
---
I literally explained how I style on these twats that do that. In this game you get dealt a hand, be adaptable and play the hand to win. Don’t go crying to ubi to change the cards. It doesn’t take much to aim head level and control recoil. I am that skillful because I kill these guys all the time
---
I can handle damage nerfs. Headshots. What I cant stand is that scope. There are dozens of off site platforms and nests that support the way I play. But what is the point of having the IR sight that distorts that much of your view when the proposed change will only highlight what's on your crosshair. For me at least, its the worst of both scopes. No more tactical advantage in long range overwatch.
---
I’m sure there’s a lot in the works. I get that the US has by far the most ops, but we also have the largest special operations community. There’s insane amounts of different SOF units in the US military, and they’ve been so incredibly active the last 20 years that they’re more well known than most. 
---
Too late
---
Partially agree. I like how they set it up but it also takes the realism out of the game but cod kids ruined the game seasons ago and this isn’t a tactical shooter anymore 
---
it goes into TS tomorrow lasts 3 weeks now. I'll let you do the maffs on that.
---
I can hear the SMG 12 in this image 
---
A hospital would be a good map. Lots of corridors and doorways to check, plus a good amount of dark areas that have no power would be cool.
---
All of them. So starting this year operators are going to become 5k renown cheaper every year until they hit 10k renown
---
The traps themselves make noise when destroyed. 
---
Dude, give Glaz his old icon back
---
You might as well call it the boosted barbie rank because of the colour and only way to get it without playing in a pro 5 stack.
---
I kept playing until I couldn't take it anymore. Feels like next time I lose I'm just going to smash my keyboard into a wall.
---
Yea I kno, I was just asking if it was retro steel
---
Lmfao 1 new map yeah thanks but no thanks UBI I’ll keep my moneys
---
No it isn't. I thought this too but I watched a video a few months back that looked at the layouts of the 2 maps and they aren't that different at all. The same basic rooms with some reshaping and remodeling. A few angles changed. Biggest difference is there's far fewer windows.
---
And cav wouldn’t be happy

Where´s my main man smoke´s elite? D:
---
are you stalking me?!??!
---
Oof, I'm sorry for your experience. As someone who exclusively plays ranked at a semi high level (plat 1-diamond) I would just be annoyed of I gunned down my teammate first round by accident, get booted and have to wait 40-50 minutes till my friend in that match is done. 
---
You are right tho that accidental teamkills don't happen that much so it's less of an issue. I think we can both agree that we need more ways of punishing teamkillers, I absolutely hate people who think that's a "cool" think to do. Main thing I think we need is tracking teamkills and damage over matches, not just in a single match. Currently team damage isn't even tracked, wth. Someone can currently join a match, kill 2 people, damage the rest and nothing can be done against that single person (no vote to Kick in ranked). That's not acceptable and it's not rocket science to atleast start limiting that behaviour
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but the 9mm SDP looks like a Glock 19? Is that what the in-game gun modeled off of?
---
Give r4-c to a year 4 2 speed and give ash the 556xi.
---
Btw i do not use wallhacks but my friend was droning and iq's breach charge was a sad casualty
---
I think the Monty at 1:18 is wearing it. It seems to be a gray uniform with black accessories. If it's not the new one, then it might be the Para Bellum one, but I only have that on Lion.
---
There is no more (Yet) 
---
His shotgun is very low range and only has three shots. I think the real meta issue is going to be his ar, much like how powerful jagers is. The machine pistol has a high fire rate but likely pales in comparison to the AR.
---
The lord’s horseman cometh to life

I think so, or just watching the finals and taking a peek at the subreddit

Theme park and kafe i liked but i think they took the soul out of kanal ,rip. I dont think it needed so much change to bomsites, just an extra passage between buildings was fine.

Idk, the giant white outline doesn't keep my teammates from killing me, so, RIP little drones, your were good friends for the short time you were on our team.
---
lul
---
That's not how it works.
---
Bottom left red 1000 percent 
---
Have they shown the new seasonal uniforms or universal skins?
---
They're onto that
---
Same vro 
---
You get a mid season event every season 
---
Yikes
---
Yeah the DMR buff has been a long time coming. The 417 in particular is kind of a joke compared to the guns it competes with, and Maverick's .50 is in a similar position.
---
But honestly, even with a doubled mag size, I still don't see them being used in serious gameplay. Automatic fire is just too important in this game, and unless the DMRs get some sort of unique mechanic to make them stand out, they'll always be meme guns.
---
It’s just a thought 
---
*Ackshually*, it's a just a quad-stack Stanag mag. The standard 200-rnd magazine is a 'box' magazine. But you are right but that it isn't mag-fed.
---
No coastline is most balanced map
---
All of the new ops are slightly pushed and then slightly nerfed. 
---
I hate to be that guy, but Ubi is still selling a product, and the best way to do that is for the product to be exciting and well posisitioned off the bat and then reign it in after 2 weeks of people buying it. Shrug. 
---
During the stream they did mention they want to do more Mid Season events in the future, like the Halloween event or Road to S.I. They did not give any details about what these events will be.
---
It was discussed during the year 4 reveal but I don't think they mention it during the Burnt Horizon reveal. 
---
Sorry but why was that such a meme match? sry because its probably a noob question, first time watching Invitationals.
---
Fuck the bots. Play against some real humans. Best thing to get some friends to carry you aswell. 
---
It says "Commando 9" and the reload shows an SMG mag.
---
Well, it's hard to do this with the standard 5.56/.300 AAC magazines for those weapons, this is a 9mm converted one.
---
Your time will come don’t worry man
---
So you took information from another source and claimed you "guessed" that info. Uhhhh
---
We need a tachanka “The Lord” elite skin
---
Yo guy's i also noticed a clever detail. The character Thatcher from the animated short is the same Thatcher from the game! Could this be a new operator tease?
---
Introducing our new attacker: school shooter
---
Do you have to be good at the game? XD
---
Hmm I decided to do a bit of research and will attempt to discuss/argue a bit on balancing these 2 guns. But overall I think you overthink a bit too much. I do agree with you on rpm changes not being plausible because of what you have stated. But overlooking the R4C too much of it being too strong while forgetting the fact that the G36C is a sub-par AR is something we should talk about here.
---
On paper, the G36C is not a very good AR in terms of raw stats, only surpassing BB's MK17 and Nomad's AK-74M. (you can refer to Rouge-9 stats' spreadsheet for even more in-depth stats.). So the way I see it, buffing G36 to bring it on a same level as the R4C is the priority and also keeping both guns balanced with the other ARs. We can alter the damage statistics so that the G36C can trade blows with the R4C. Reducing the R4C's damage (from 41 to 39) is the first step. But even then R4C's rpm and dps still trumps the G36 so it doesn't hurt buffing the G36 or even nerf the R4C even more so the STK (shots to kill) is similar accross the board. Not entirely similar but I'd say across different distances. The best option I can think of now is to make the R4C's STK 1 shot less than the G36C from 1 to 12 meters and similar from 12 meters and above, at longer distances (12-25m), the G36C will have an advantage over the R4C (1 less STK), that's where the R4C's extended barrel will come in handy. Now that we have established the competitive baseline between the two ARs, we go into the gun feel. I wouldn't change too much at this aspect as Ubi made their intention clear: G36C has more tactical options (angled grip) while easier to control than the R4C. There's recoil, ADS, barrel attachments which you can adjust but i won't go into this too much as it's decent in the current state. The most viable and easy option is a nerf to R4C's magazine size. 20-25 i'd say. 
---
Even after these tweaks there's still another main problem. Ash's still too strong and way too comfortable to play comparing to other operators. That's why I mentioned above that we need to adjust these two guns comparing to other ARs in the game. I'd say keep these two at average; below-average dps comparing to other ARs' average dps. But in the end while my proposals are mostly on a statistical impact, it does not change much the essence and the feel of Ash as an operator overall and this is the exact reason why Ubi really struggles with balancing this operator, a very popular operator also, making it even harder as it has to please a lot more players. That is why I applaud your bold approach and logic with your change even though there will be a lot of underlying problems, not even mention a long time of testing and bringing it live, but the biggest problem is to convince the player that this is a viable solution, which unfortunately is very hard as Ash's R4C is her signature weapon at this point and it is almost an inseparable part of Ash and the relationship it has to the players.

F
---
I have up to silver as of yesterday's stream so I'm hoping for gold as of now, I know I wont get the dimond because I didn't watch the preliminary matches
---
Yeah, If you're on Steam, this will happen, even with games that aren't R6, it's been a problem.for a long time unfortunately ☹️
---
I just don’t want the game to turn to cod and have team killing allowed/recoiled and make it reflected because that isn’t how real life works but if that takes away toxicity then I can’t complain 
---
No it was ranked. I'm a plat 3 and was playing w a buddy of mine
---
Any idea when Playlist changes are coming? Are they Y4S1?
---
If it shows up in the Twitch notifications as having earned them, they should automatically be on your Siege account that you have linked to Twitch. All four of my charms so far I've found in-game under any weapon that takes them.
---
"Glaz has always had a downside." 
---
And there it is, a sentence in, not worth it. 
---
Yep, this is why i dislike these kinds of things. It just shifts the problem up a notch.
---
well, can you get kills 
---
Look, everyone can shoot across 30m+ and get headshots, you don't need Glaz to do something like that. Operators with DMRs can potentially do the same while bringing actual utility to the game. Glaz brought nothing to the team back then and suffered from a 0% pick rate constantly in PL. Also, most kills in this game happen at 10m range.
---
Plane just overall sucks. 
---
is this the rework?
---
I didnt see the killing himself but that nitro tk was worth it ngl. Also did you see fabians nade plays? Lol
---
Why did they change casual? I love it the way it currently is.
---
There's already a form of decay in the seasonal resets, no reason to have another form of decay.
---
Yeah sure lean spamming may take skill but it’s just retarded realistically. Rainbow was always meant to be that ‘realistic’ (yes I know operator gadgets like the yokai drone and hologram are unrealistic). Think about it, they don’t teach the SAS to quickly lean your gun left and right again and again and it’s just straight out annoying to die to. I respect that I may require skill but it just makes gunfights ultra stressful and it doesn’t feel ‘authentic’ in terms of the gameplay of rainbow. 
---
No team empire deserved second place 
---
no not yet, but that’s perfect. i’ll make one today or tomorrow 
---
The Commando's not enough to make me play Mozzie. I'm sorry but it's hard pass today. Even though it pains me to leave my Commando behind but at least Gridlock also has the Super Shorty. Battlefield 4 lives on!
---
Most of the time... I'm good at apex and decent at siege.. I'm no diamond tho (I'm on xbox)
---
It also says I have the silver charm all the way back from the Paris major. But it never appeared in my account 
---
Really? I thought there'd be a cool Indigenous Australian dot-painted style skin...
---
So, you're willing to completely ignore numerical evidence because seeing a Glaz makes you feel real mad inside?
---
I also have pubg
---
Yes
---
Buy it through the Ubisoft store, use the ubisoft club 20 percent discount that costs 100 uplay units and you get yourself the season pass at a much cheaper price.

There is a reason they took the first map 22 rounds to decide a  victor

So I was
---
There is so much wrong with this thread... and it's not only the formatting.
---
doncaster?
---
And hospitals to hide weapons in for HAMAS
---
Huh? Im saying even if they change resetting, itll still have worth. If im at 5hp id rather be reset to 20.
---
She was still pretty damn famous in 2014, which is why they picked her. She's a recognizable face and a celebrity.
---
I love the way that it kind of acts the same as the commando from Black ops 1
---
Game 1 was grudgingly long, and I feel like that wore on Empire.
---
Grat G2, amazingly well played.
---
With the Capitao buff you can shoot the roof above them and have the fire fall down. He'll be a great counter
---
Pretty much all of it. I worked a desk job and watch more prelim matches than ever before 
---
Probably not, but I would much rather have a proper match of "all stars" than a comedy match. Maybe let the audience vote who should be on teams beforehand, and organize a proper match with some kind of prize for motivation, so the players actually take it seriously. 
---
Otherwise, yes it is fun, but I'd rather they keep a move-on with the show, as it is Sunday/Monday night/morning for a lot of the world as already, and some of us have to get to work in the morning, so I'd appreciate if the finals could take place 2-3 hours sooner, instead of this fun little all star game with zero meaning.  
---
Yeah for sure, deployable shields are already great tools on certain sites on certain maps. I'm super happy they did this though since it not only required hefty game knowledge on knowing where and when they're good, but also just felt useless on certain maps.
---
KROKODIL?
---
First Line of Defense mixed with a mountain slope. Seems right.
---
For a splitsecond i thought he would actually straight murder the guy.
---
I see the joke but G2 always banned lion 
---
At one point I’m pretty sure it was at top with 260+ viewers 
---
Do we know when the bulk of the changes (ranked, lean spam, etc) are being patched in, or is it on the test server with the new ops?
---
I was on live and my bladder got really hurt by the first match.
---
you need to read more thoroughly
---
This content requires the base game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege on Steam in order to play.
---
That’s pretty crazy and I’d think I’d have to move my head physically instead of my eyes but I just like less input lag with a monitor
---
I knew it I told you guys India and Mexico were marked for a reason. 
---
Once again. The pro league came kinda boring since you know they always win anyway. I want to watch a league that's different for once dammit.
---
It may. If you can get it through the floor i think it will spread down there still
---
I tuned in in the middle of this and thought it was the grand final and was very confused 
---
I know, right? I think it's gonna be cool af to see an op in a suit
---
[I’m referring to this](https://youtu.be/_ZtOz-KKMhI)
---
whats the original thing of the last scene
---
No, I never denied it. I was looking forward to it. Until I saw what they were doing. I know it won't effect the majority of players. Still just feels like a waste. I'll be using dmr ops to snipe because the sniper won't be able to detect defenders on multiple windows. 
---
Well yea. I could be overlooking that, but SSG’s game with G2 amazed me with their performance 
---
New event? For one week roles are swapped.
---
Echo and jackel would be so strong
---
It's almost over then he'll be banned in ranked 
---
I don't need to say this any simpler, no.
---
well you can try out later. and no you don’t have to be amazing. it shouldn’t be hard for you to make it. permanently or temporarily would you do? you should make it depending on who else comments. if no one else comments about it then you definitely would make it temporarily at least. oh and if your good at apex then that’s good because we need aped players as well
---
Ofc you are, after all, you're on console
---
Okay
---
That's not suit... again, go in game check recruits model.
---
Hello ckleinfelter, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/arqout/twitch_needs_a_nerf/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Bless your wee cotton socks, cuz when you play ranked thats how its going to be. 
---
OMG there are german operators but no swiss or austrian REEEEEEEEEEEEE \^\\s
---
dude i have a roni kit for my airsoft glock. that’s the coolest thing ever that they added this in
---
3 speeds are not stronger then 1 speeds in my opinion. If you watched pro league a team would rather have a 1 speed like mira,echo, maestro that can provide Intel. That is why 1 speeds have a higher ban rate then 3 speeds. 3 speeds are fast but their gadgets are less helpful then 1 speed ops. So why do 3 speeds need more changes then 1 speeds? As you stated before, g2 had no problem countering a 3 speed joystick. 
---
I have to agree, I'm so glad Ubisoft didn't drop the ball with this one, I might actually just buy the season pass just to support the game.
---
Think Fabian hated him the most aswell
---
Bartlett was also partly reworked for PvP. The library used to have a ladder instead of stairs, the model hallway was wider, there was a staircase by the main entrance, etc.
---
Annoyingly the F90 is the exoirt semi-auto civilian version. The full-auto military version is the EF88,
---
Yeah I'm not super good... I could actually be a back up for the other games but I would definitely tryout for apex... and you can ask for players on my discord if you want...
---
Is your main Ubisoft account linked properly to Twitch? You can see it under Connections in settings. It should say UbisoftConnect.

This also belongs on r/HitBoxPorn
---
Post a pic atleast. 
---
You could burn through the shield or hit nearby furniture / walls before as well.
---
It's goobisoft
---
Glaz’s Thermal Scope no longer works if you’re moving. There are a bunch of other ones too, but this is the one I  wanted to discuss.
---
Except that Gu mines still do 10 damage, and 4 (after the nerf) damage every couple of seconds.
---
Gu mines are also incredibly hard to see, trax stingers....not so much.
---
Awesome I can’t wait !
---
For one it'd make it harder for hackers to get into ranked matches. Other than that I'm not too entirely sure.
---
Do you know in wich minute?
---
Harry is the leader of Rainbow
---
Where would I go to check?
---
Haven’t looked in a while
