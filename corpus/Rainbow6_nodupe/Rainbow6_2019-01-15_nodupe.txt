I would make "Classic Ranked an unranked game mode with the current ranked rules just an environment for players who don't like the environment of ranked but can be competitive

Upvoting for visibility. Please. PLEASE.

why, just why fuckign consulate

no please I dont' understand

well have fun either way

I played for a few hours yesterday and out of 20 or so games, 2 of them were from the lobby; the rest of them I joined in progress.
---

---
The only problem I can see with this system is that a few days ago my router kept cutting out and dropped me from games (or maybe they already have this system in place I was being punished?).
---
Becauae yeah, they should. Especially considering improving the game would be much more appreciated than a Tachanka bundle.
---
Yeah I got the same problem. When I click "equip all" nothing happens either 
---
Satisfying

I didn't know Ash was there and my sight just happened to land right on her head.
---
Coo.  I wish I could find my old clanmates.  VR guys from early rainbow on PC and clan 666 on competitive  Xbox (regular Xbox). I have a bad habit of getting busy and losing touch.
---
Report yourself for excessive use of Q and E keys
---
Tower is a mistake; favela is either run out hell or nowhere to hide rushing
---
Hahaha that's so fucking rad! You found the exact hat and everything! üëçüëç
---
This needs to happen. 
---
It obviously isn‚Äôt that simple tho, I‚Äôm sure if ubi could just fix major problems in the game with the same amount of resources as a tachanka bundle they would. 
---
As someone just learning the game I think my top two complaints are:
---
1. No automatched multiplayer mode allows you any choice in map selection. When you are jumping between a list of 20 maps and playing casual with only 3 to 5 lives in a row on the same map, it is incredibly difficult to actually learn maps - which as we all know, is a major separator of skill in this game. So it feels like I'm caught in this loop of forever sucking. I know allowing map selection is tough, because it could end up like CSGO where 50% of games played are on dust 2 and remaining games are only on a couple of other maps - but there has to be some fair mechanism.
---
2. On a related note, casual and and to some degree ranked are both _very_ short game modes. I get the idea, ubi may want to keep games under 30 minutes to make it easy to drop in and out from the game, but IMO that really hurts the game. These short lifecycle games compound making if difficult to actually learn the game. Switching maps every 3 to 5 lives is really frustrating - its really tough to get in any rhythm with a team. At the very least there should be some longer, fully featured game mode with some type of map selection.
---
Casual is not meant to prepare you for ranked. Its meant to be casual. Stop saying this.
---
Ranked is what prepares you for ranked.
---
Wait, there's a uniform?
---
look closer
---
There is a massive chunk of theme park in which litterally nothing occurs. No objective and not a good rotation route either
---
I got in game with the mentioned 14 year olds twin brother and it felt like winning the lottery every time I killed IT ( these people are to despicable to be called humans)

He‚Äôs downvoted because withholding petty information while boasting about a C4 spot. Two people asked and he wouldn‚Äôt answer as if he‚Äôs trying to make sure other people don‚Äôt know exactly where. It would have been better to not even respond than to respond with dodgey answers.
---
I‚Äôd rather see a new game mode inbetween ranked and casual since they are like night and day to each other. Something where you can pick spawn locations but rounds only go to 4, something like that
---
Same

Clean up that crazy typography and this is some good shit!

wtf

If you weren't running Ding Chavez, then you obviously didn't know who the best OP was.

&gt; He doesn‚Äôt breach tho, he pokes holes.
---
If you cut straight across the top and bottom of the reinforcement, the entire hardbreach in the middle falls down.  He's a good alternative to Thermite if you have to use him like that.

Its gud but where's ur ACOG ????

I gues you just have really good aim

I‚Äôm sorry, what exactly is your stance here? Are you actually trying to defend lean spamming, or are you just arguing for the sake of arguing?
---
**Feetsy boii**
---
Wait what? I've killed people when they are falling all the time? I know it messes with their hitbox but I don't think they're invincible.
---
I'm down with all but the grace period for new operators. I mean I payed for those operators, if I can't play em on the freaking game even competitive side it's really like saying that their game is garbage. I already am boycotting proleague this season because of this. What was fun with new season is new ops and the meta shift. Now we gotta endure 6 months of the same shit. Sorry I'm out of this bull

At least the uniform from that set fits perfectly with his Outbreak headgear so it actually looks good. That‚Äôs what I currently use for him paired with Elite Kaplan‚Äôs weapon skins.

Its a rip of CSGO. Given its popularity, I understand the sentiment
---
lol right
---
[removed]
---
I'd rather have a few maps with special rules in Casual than wait for Ubisoft to rework it.  It's very unlikely that we'll see a Favela rework soon, and this would at least make the map playable.
---
Now move the lower one down so he doesn't have an angle from his eyes to the other player at all. The higher player will still be able to see the top of the lower player's head.
---
You're also assuming that the player cam is in the eyes...
---
Good, I'd rather they spent time on better maps.
---
Jesus christ you really are dumb...
---
They're limited time only 
---
The game says i already own it somehow, i check, snd its nowhere to be seen. 
---
What? I can't hear anything
---
Not too bad at all :). I usually only say yes to Ranked when I'm wasted tbh cuz I end up being dumb enough to go into it lmao. One night ended up playing Ranked with a friend and some low silver or even coppers in his group, I hadn't done placements or anything yet so I did that absolutely hammered and got Gold right off the bat lmao. Go into casual later with that rank and then kids bitch about how my rank is a lie lol. Another time I only did 7/10 placements smashed as tits and we decimated all of the matches still cuz we were playing against golds. I'll just stay unranked cuz idc, that's how dumb ranked can be. Most of the time it's AIDs Meta, unstable server connections so people drop and then it's 3v5 4v5. Then add running into chances of running into hackers. Just not a very fun experience IMO. 
---
You don't like your whole team getting decimated by a spawnpeeker or what?
---
We know the rest you 4-0 them ace every single round I'm tried of seeing these types of stories 
---
Love it 
---
F for Bartlett, I never thought it was bad enough to be removed, especially since favela is and tower STILL EXIST and favela got taken out of the game only to be put back in with no changes at all
---
50k tho!???
---
Be pulse with hair to show us how that'd look
---
I don't think lean spamming is that much of a big deal. Remove the crouching problem and see where we are.
---
Why don't you actually bother to read what I've written and what my stance is would have been abundantly clear?
---
You kidding me?  Try playing in the daytime on a weekday.  Often hit with 10 minute queue times as a silver in NA.
---
Im pretty new to the game and I like the ability to pick your spawn/obj and the longer rounds, but I prefer casual just for the fact that I have no clue what im doing or where i am going.
---
I mean, you are right.
---
Yeah but what about maps like Theme Park? Its abandoned for years, its in the middle of nowhere and takeing it down would probably just help the city by making more free space.
---
And if we want to add damage to the body parts we have to concider fun or rather lack of it we we add it. Just iamgine geting screwed over for the whole round just because hand of your model was sticking out for a 1s you got hit and now you cant aim or not being able to walk for the whole round just because someone hit you by mistake in a foot.
---
If we want to add realistic element to this game we can do this but at the same time we're geting rid of fun elements not even saying about competetive aspect of the game.
---
In my opition we should add more fun and competetive mechanics to the game and get rid of these that are making it more of a roll the dice simulator that a actual skill based game where you map knowledge, aim and thinking outside the box matters.
---
This is  an old MacieJay Trick. It's classically done with Mira as shown in (this video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Nqy0s-HMes]
---
We just need to have some Goddamn faith...
---
Missing your list: Skyscraper, Hereford, Fortress, Chalet.
---
Not in ranked rotation: Tower, House, Yacht, Favela, Plane, Bartlett.
---
These are pretty solid as is, imo. They have a different sort of feel to them that makes them more than just some icon.
---
As much as I‚Äôd like it, they wouldn‚Äôt ban any operators from ranked because people paid for them and would probably be a huge issue within the community if they did. I doubt they‚Äôll even add a pick and ban system based on the same reason.
---
Yeah the distance is the same on all platforms, it just looks further on PC because of the increased FOV (the higher the FOV, the more zoomed out things are, meaning they look further away) 
---
Btw you didn‚Äôt reply directly to my comment ;) 
---
Like I would legitimately buy something like this.
---
with an option to queue solo would be a good addition imo.

that is lot for typing on your phone

Fuze and thermite. Imagine putting thermite charge up on a reinforced wall and during that time it shoots fuze pucks.
---
I know I always move seeing thermite hole coming up  throwing in fuze too would be silly. 
---
Lion is considered to be irreparably overpowered at Pro League level. I think the Kaid and Nomad bans are purely because theyre the newest.
---
The reason the site is random is so that all the sites can be played and learnt. Ultimately casual is a training ground. If sites are chosen the same fee will continue to be recycled over and over.
---
Sin
---
Well the casual ranked mode implied here is just our regular ranked so it wouldn't make a difference besides the fact that there would be a much longer and harder (*insert lenny face here) ranked mode
---
I‚Äôve wanted to play plane and house in ranked for a year and a half. Ranked classic would make that come true and re-live the nostalgia üò≠üò≠üò≠. I SUPPORT THIS!!!
---
https://youtu.be/FoLXUs46uWY &lt;- that‚Äôs a pretty good video I watched about it.
---
Yes why not! 
---
While I agree with you.  Art storage secure area is one place where you would be mad to not reinforce every wall on to site. 
---
Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it 
---
Hey devs if you read this don‚Äôt worry about what that guy said you‚Äôre doing a great job and we love you. 
---
So what exactly is the mobile 2 step verification for?
---
Im a big noob but I use fuze just to open up objectives by shooting his poop through the floor and blowing up everything front of doors/windows
---
Sorry but this post is about 2 weeks old how did you find it?
---
Damn.
---
Thats how CSGO fixed crouch spam, people on Dust2 used to crouch spam behind boxes where only their heads were visible and they were extrenely difficult to kill.
---
First ever recorded clip of Fuzes hockey pucks being useful. XD
---
What about casual comp and ranked comp? 
---
I honestly don't understand this either
---
Is this FR?
---
I completely agree used to play her a decent bit, hadn‚Äôt played her for a while. Thought I‚Äôd give her a try and the recoil made the gun unmanageable, I presumed it was just little practise with the new recoil. I dedicated a good 2 hours of casual to try and get good with it again and I got nowhere. The recoil is extreme, tap firing makes it manageable but if the enemy is good enough they just kill you first. This gun also needs to have console recoil adjusted. 
---
Any even remotely decent cosmetic items costs 20k+ with intent to force you to just shortcut it with your wallet. Even if these special sets were to be sold for renown, it would be a year after their initial release as a limited-time bundles like they did with the first halloween sets which were 40 or 45k with no possibility of buying only headpiece or a weapon camo. 
---
And please, don't ever support these predatory practices. Buy an elite set instead rather than paying for random fillers wanting to get a specific item. 
---
Yes I like it and get in a game quickly 
---
I‚Äôve gotten some amazing ones but didn‚Äôt have my capture on 
---
I still find it odd that there's no reference/callbacks to him in Siege at all. We have one for Kure Galanos, but that's about it for the OG Team Rainbow. :/
---
Yooo
---
[I feel ya](https://imgur.com/a/EJZj0Yu)
---
Who cares what someone does with their money? If he wants to buy a cosmetic then more power to him. I personally don't buy cosmetics because that stuff doesn't really matter to me, but he gets something he wants and Ubi gets money to make a better game(though they may not spend it like that). 
---
Why can't we have a proper proleague format style ranked where you don't swap sides every round? I get that games would be longer but I come from CS so longer doesn't bother me. 
---
I believe that competitive ranked would be more popular, provided casual were to adopt the current ranked format (or at least shorter rounds).
---
Ultimately, I think there should only be two game modes, as regions such as APAC can already struggle at times to matchmake games, particularly at higher ranks.
---
This actually only applies in Zofia's M762, because all the other ak's in the game use the intermediary 5.54x39, not the fullbore 7.62x39.     
---
The 6P41 LMG is actually *longer*, with a 7.62x54 cartridge.     
---

I'm going off the wiki for calibers, because not all guns in r6 have real life counterparts anymore.

Lol how they‚Äôre all wearing socks.
---
First 2 games on for the today have both been already in progress with everyone leaving between rounds. 
---
I don't think I've ever seen this happen before. It's pretty noticeable as well. 
---
I'll need someone to test that this happens from the attacker point of view before I start sharpening my pitch fork. 
---
The 2FA I set up for it is email based - this was forced a little while back when he wanted to continue to pursue ranked play.
---
Are you ok?  
---
That shit eating-grin
---
Do it on the side towards the nose of the plane that whole side would be blocked from the door ways 
---
I love it, but I think for bans every operator needs to be unlocked even for those without all DLC ops. 
---
No
---
Downvoted heh
---
Damn only lvl 36 not bad
---
Ahhhhhh, I see. I concur, there's no excuse to you not getting that interrogation. Unfortunately theres a few of those kinds of bugs/problems that need to be fixed.
---
you kinda covered this with points gained/lost, but I really want more of a climb feeling to ranked...rather than just completing placements then staying at that rank the whole season...placements are a joke, had a friend who doesn't play FPSs in his first season get placed gold 3/2...he quickly fell to bronze because he is so far from gold level play
---
I feel bad asking, but how long is it available?
---
I confronted so many players after they did this kinda shit and THEY ALL laughed at me, told me to get better, ‚ÄúI can do it too if I want‚Äú and other bullshit excuses... part of this community is completly degenerate... 
---
So mony people honestly think that M&amp;K on console is ok, dropshotting was ok and now that crouch&amp;lean-spam is ok... they need a fucking reality check. No its not fucking ok.

No for me, my issues with the map were:
---
- Catwalk, it would have been fine if solely as just an entry point but my issues are that attackers can just sit up there while firing on defenders. They are essentially inside but still in complete control of the pace similar to them being outside of most maps.
---
- Stairs on opposite ends of the map which is quite large
---
- Lack of hatches, this goes along with the stairs that combine extreme limit rotation options on both sides
---
- Audio issues, the audio system in this game is garbage but it is very bad in this map since so much is one big open area
---
Those are the major issues that I can think of right now. All those being said the map did and has potential but personally those issues stop it from being a good map to me.
---
dude you have a big advantage over guys with 200 ping if you have 9 ping
---
Exactly. If you‚Äôve played the game for awhile, you know kitchen is underneath that window, so just tell the people who are asking. 
---
Well you are a lion main, so toxic shit would be expected
---
My dude I'm not talking about pressing R1 and getting bonuses to your gun. I'm talking about things that are innately boosted within your gun. Glaz can just shoot through castle. Cav can just press triangle. Cav has two abilities, her 99 DMG silenced pistol then added on top.
---
This sounds like it could be a really useful operator and I love this idea.
---
If anyone uses the excuse of splitting the player base and longer queue times then they are stupid because the game has a big enough player base to allow this to happen.
---
Doesnt it still go through if if they leave during the animation 
---
This is beautiful. Too bad UüÖ±I doesn't listen to real feedback
---
It‚Äôs pro league rules. That‚Äôs the point of that playlist to play the game how the pros play
---
I get the beta joke but I only started playing Siege in 2018. Was ranked not out on release in 2015? 
---
Feel like premade teams should also be a requirement, but great idea nonetheless
---

Friend1: rIGHT THERE OMG HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE HIM?
---
Yeah if they leave during animation it goes through but doesnt give me points for a kill. But people tend to just leave as I'm running over to them before I can start the animation. 
---
its a very useful gadget, the fact people dont pick it doesn't mean it needs a buff
---
its basically impossible to win attacks against a team that is the same level you are. Its very dark in some places and way too big
---
tldr tbh
---
wtf lol that's my school 
---
I've honestly gotten way better at killing bombers. You just can't panic. line up the headshot and control the recoil and there gone!
---
Granted this is in normal mode.
---
That moment when so little is going on in your games community that people start posting the few large changes you've made like it's somehow nostalgic.
---
I hear tachanka's voice in my head when reading that
---
Leaning shouldn't be instant though. The process of changing stance should make a player more vulnerable not less. 
---
I bought this bundle immediately, mind you. Time to hunt some thots in the dark. Oregon sasg lirk mk-2 baby!!
---
Lean spamming makes people impossible to hit, that needs to go more than crouch spamming. 
---
Also what cav has the idea "Yo let's rush these two enemies, I'm sure it'll work out"
---
Nice one! I made a clutch earlier today on the same spot. Was 2-2 and a 3v5 cause salty teammates left. Went Maestro and just played extra aggressive and it paid off. One of the enemy messaged me saying I was a tryhard even tho they brought Finka, Lion, Dok, and Blitz to a 3v5 üòÇ
---
Praise the lord !
---
But the whole point of LEANING is to make you less vulnerable. if you put a delay on that, Then leaning would be pointless. Might as well get rid of it completely and leave it like CS:GO
---
the classic ranked would probably be more populated simply because a lot of players wont want to have the pick and ban/operator limitations/smaller map pool. i think a lot of people just see it as too complicated, and playing one side for 6 rounds with a 7 round victory mark could get tedious for some. i personally would love the option, and a separate queue with an existing map pool and existing pro league mechanics, along with the 6 round per side thing that you can already do in custom games with shouldnt be too hard to do. it would be awesome to have this just because pick and ban is a really cool thing but like i said before a lot of people dont want to have to learn how to. ban on what site and whatever. but i just cant see the majority of the people who play ranked (that has to be somewhere in the hundred thousand range at least) hopping to PL rules

Fatigue system in siege ü§î

But also I did laugh aloud at how funny this was. Take a million upvotes, friend
---
Looks like something similar happened on the other team
---
Idk what I‚Äôm actually looking at but at least it‚Äôs high quality
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to remember this in case I accidentally TK 
---
I think this guy is a moron not entirely sure lol- rainbow six didn‚Äôt make this helmet dude the base their designs off real already existing things.
---
I think 7 rounds is too much. More than it is currently would be nice but 7 to win is alot. Also casual should have abandon sanction s because it's a wreck currently. Can't even get through a game without losing half of the people in the match.
---
Thats actually really cool
---
Is it asking too much to have it at least resemble something that makes sense?
---
I can‚Äôt use shadowplay :(
---
So judging from your first comment, do you care about this person making the game unfair for us all?
---
that is some "a glitch in the matrix" moment!
---
note : not my drawing , just random stealing , from this twitter i guess. [https://twitter.com/tararelux/status/1069607171262824448](https://twitter.com/tararelux/status/1069607171262824448)

I would very much like this

Yup

Lord stuff aside, Who do they expect  to drop 50k for tachanka? Seeing this made me laugh.

Not guna lie I miss this map lmao 
---
Lion when he knew his wife took the kid with her
---
Well, they there was pro league on Xbox early in the game. They dropped it because the vast majority of viewers were watching PC. It was dropped because PC it‚Äôs more skillful and fun to watch.
---
The cameraman fucking sucks
---
Sadly not that I know of, you can always repurchase when it‚Äôs on sale. But that‚Äôs all I can think of 
---
That‚Äôs all you wanted to hear? Like come on dude you could have said that the first time and went on with your day. Thanks man I appreciate it . 
---
ur phones gonna die
---
HOW DARE YOU I ONLY WANT TO PROTECT
---
I think that the community will not aprove that, but I dream with this
---
F
---
Or at least you have some time to run away before receiving a shotgun blast to the stomach. 
---
You also didn't mention how ammo checking and reloading would work. It would basically be like ok Escape from Tarkov 
---
Nah, I have a decent internet and setup with SSD, yet it still happens from time to time.
---
I haven't had issues dealing with Nomads, the only times I have was once I got knocked into a claymore and another time I got glitched into a wall and couldn't move for the remainder of the match
---
When else are you supposed to use it? When you‚Äôre standing still?
---
I think this overall would be a good idea but I think some of it is misguided.
---
Six rounds per side works in Pro League because it's balanced out by fighting on more than one map. I know lots of the PL matches are best of one but the change was introduced with the best of three to keep it balanced and this is how the main matches are handled with best of ones only done to keep the show rolling along. To me the better way would be keep it first to seven plus potential overtime but have teams switch after four rounds.
---
My second issue is the ban on new operators. Banning Lion would still make sense but new operators are banned in Pro League in case they are OP and to allow teams time to develop strats and counter strats around them, the teams do this through scrims and normal play. The majority of people that would jump into this Comp Ranked wouldn't jump into normal Ranked just to learn the new OPs, they would just keep playing Comp Ranked as normal until the operators were allowed so it would be a limit with no real purpose.
---
what time zone are you in?
---
Yea I remember watching this episode; it got me excited idk why lol
---
He‚Äôs strong at the higher levels
---
And maybe it wont be in #FUCKING BETA
---
No, I couldn't. He did this to me three or four times before he finally killed me, I didn't see him at all but on his kill cam he could clearly see me. I know what peeker's advantage is, and this wasn't that.
---
This can also tie into being able to deal with someone who you know is trying to TK, you see them chasing and following you, and then you can either vote to kick or have the whole squad back you up. 
---
Not like it used to be, when you would unlock a new op it would show you an individual cut-scene.
---
I‚Äôd pay you for these if you sold them on Etsy or custom order other operators. Amazing job. 
---
*We‚Äôll be right back*

I personally would like to see it happen, every mode would get used but ppl like I want a mode like this so if we decided to try for esl we would have a better, idea instead of just scrims

I'm on the other side. I think pro rules will 100% become more popular, but I have personally never watched a pro tournament so I don't have that allure. I'd personally play classic ranked.

Haha thanks for the advice
---
My first two were Jackal and Mira from admidditly the season pass, but my third was Frost &lt;333 Then I just grinded to get the rest of the ops.
---
I understand the simile but its also kind of ridiculous. Banning people for rage quitting the game (i know tons of games do like overwatch) doesn't make sense. Of anything, I'd much rather have a better feedback system and a system that allows you to look at the previous game's players and be able to submit feedback. 
---
Team killing, trolling, leaving early, and be able to explain and be able to submit videos. That way you don't hurt innocent players, and get the bad ones. But this is ubisoft so that won't happen.

This has happened to me 2 times and both didn‚Äôt count.

Worst case just shoot them next time is my suggestion, can't leave if they're dead

Also how many hours on Cav do you have?
---
Have you seen the balance ideas on this sub?
---
Some say lion is not Op. Some say BB should have 240 HP. Some say blitz is "underwhelming to play as" and should have tighter hip fire. A dude even said Dokki is weak and should have a full auto primary! Hell, there's even one suggestion to give ash 2 extra breaches and smokes because she is "TOO SIMPLE" (yeah, I remember them all).
---
This sub consists of players, including me, that have ABSO-FRIKKING-LUTELY NO IDEA WHAT BALANCE IS. They feel it should always be fun to play IT, and not balance to play against. The top 0.01% know HOW THE GAME WILL MAINTAIN BALANCE AT ALL LEVELS. They play this game as a job, which means they have THOUSAND'S OF HOURS OF EXPERIENCE to know what's right and what's wrong. They have played it in all styles and all formats, be it solo or squad. They know it better than us. Ubi isn't balancing because they are pros. Ubi is balancing because they have willingly invested 10000 hours in this game and will continue to, so they possess the knowledge and wisdom to make the right suggestions.
---
This sub is more broken than BB-800 when it comes to balance suggestions. We don't need that much faultiness in this game.
---
Let me give you an example. An Engineering textbook isn't written by an engineering graduate. It is written by an experience doctorate or industrialist with enough grey hair to write the right things. Same goes for professors- they are not fresh graduates, they are those who have enough experience to justify the knowledge they possess. Those are the pros in the game.
---
The balancing format is fine where it is. Best to balance around the best than the worst.

Just started playing rainbow around 3 weeks ago. Casual is where I played mostly until I had a few games of ranked with my mates, realised, with mates, that ranked is so much better. Don't know if I'm ready for competitive ranked though haha. 
---
Also I was thinking of buying Maverick, would this be a good idea, you seems pretty versatile.
---
It should be map based then cause I'm tired of getting fucked over on Oregon. Sorry Kix but I'm not up to checking every one of 8 million angles every time I play that map.
---
Reeee
---
also they should finally move the players vision from their forehead to inbetween their eyes. so tired of people headglitching.

Couldn't have said it better.

TBH though, I do feel her guns are trash. But her gadget is very good.

Mira

check your ram usage when it happens, I had some memory leak problems in the last 1 week or so

The ranked idea was just for jokes lol

But yes! Maybe make it an event and if it gets positive feedback make it a game mode.

---
I do believe that the classic ranked should be called something else, normal mode, straight up classic or so
---
And it rule set should be something between the current ranked and casual (more of our current ranked).
---
This should be the place to go when you don't want to be too competitive, but it should be place that you take seriously
---
Casual in my opinion should be even more casual (random)
---
Heck you could eveb remove friendly fire in here and ad weekly brawl like rules from time to time...
---
And the ranked should be lot closer to that of the pro league rule set
---
I love this. Hope ubi implements these. But they still need to fix how ranked elo works. Maybe increase the stakes in comp ranked? But do that after fixing the elo of actual ranked. Otherwise most people will ignore ranked. 
---
‚ÄúYou are probably thinking how do I get here‚Äù

You need to stop you are gonna get somebody at ubisoft fired for thinking of this sooner.

It's not banning them for rage quitting though.... they join back right away they are simply doing it so I cant interrogate as cav and reveal the locations of the enemy team. They are not ragequitting they are actively abusing the game to avoid Cavs special ability.  To me that should be punishable.

How to play lesion: place all goo mines in the same door way, causing the opponent to die instantly

They're one of the only few where the actual icons had any shadowing or background business oddly enough.

Its more of the color in person honestly, it came out a bit more blue on pic it seems!
---
Boosting. General complaint, as Ubisoft always insists on using super wide examples. Obv I want something more agressive than that.
---
God no, I really like casual for not having any placement/rank.  So i can play just for fun or then I'm too hammered for ranked :D
---
Thank you so much! I may take some "orders" if youre really interested you can message me!

Best thing is being placed in a round that just started 1 second before you joined

Not everyone likes bomb you know. I personally hate bomb with a passion, so does my friends. I know this sub worships bomb but you arent thinking about the general population. There are already less maps in ranked, removing Secure area and hostage would just make the game more stale.

sure they can. But they can't push five defenders at a time. Or I was just lucky both times.

Cross progression wasn't really a thing awhile ago but it's becoming increasingly popular so maybe in the future but not right now.

Lesion one is my favorite. Also my main! Good job OP!

Ubi did not think when they designed Capit√£o. A special operator with only one eye is pretty useless. But hey, it looks cool

I think she was trying to pretend to be a decoy

Fuck off you kissless virgin fag.

Saw a video yesterday with some 12 year old kid telling this girl she shouldnt be playing the game because its a boys game.

Like dude, you shouldnt be playing the game because you are not old enough to f***ing buy it.

i think the best representation of guerilla warfare tactics is basically kapkans spring wire traps and probably cavs ability for her insane amount of stealth.

I genuinely want to see this now. In a community I own we host seasons within with pro league settings and it‚Äôs so much fun, I was just saying to my friend the other day that it‚Äôd be amazing if this was an option in multiplayer.
---
Apart from the squid looking high af, they look awesome!!
---
They are as perfect as perfect can be.
---
Yep, i really like the map theme songs when selecting an operator(especially the one on oregon). Don't mind the negative comments, this sub doesn't appreciate anything if it is not about something competitive. 
---
Originally, when the game was first released, the ranked game mode wasn't in beta, but then during Operation health(?), they changed it to beta.
---
I mean, Tachanka sleeps with Finka so...

Yeah, it's really shitty. I dunno how it is in other regions but people in EU are so fucking toxic atm its unreal.

It's not hard to be nice to people and if you're against the message in this post you're part of the issue

Laptops aren't officially supported. And you're straining the system by connecting a monitor to it?
---
Plus if you've got the game on an external drive rather than your internal drive, that will also cause issues. Make sure said drive is also not a Microsoft Storage Space Device, as they're not too great for some games.
---
I would keep troubleshooting with Ubi Support, but as it's a laptop, your options will be limited 
---
This didn't really make any sense, instantly thought this would have been actually funny if it was a Monty and Pulse nitro'd himself trying to kill him whilst wearing the headgear.

Hello Exotermicc, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ag6j9q/voice_chat/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Well rank doesnt mean anything. In my opinion its an advantage for the enemy but if it works for you, then it works. Tho im using laser on blitz cause thats one of the few situation I have to use hipfire.
---
I think it pops after 1 second after bouncing of a surface
---
Yo Thanks! Got some idea for my room decor!
---
Mega ouch.
---
Let me start off with that I 100% get your view and it isn't an invalid one. Siege has casual and competitive players. There will always be a s divide between the two. How reflective this sub is off one or another I can't tell, both of the groups are definitely active on it. 
---
Why would you "hate" pro league settings? You would lose Kafe, Theme Park, Skyscraper, Hereford and Fortress. (I would personally be very happy with the first 3 and advocate for a map pool that does include the new maps for 1 or 2 seasons before rotating them out, to keep things a bit fresh and give these maps a chance to be played at a decent level). I can understand that you think less maps = less variation and less fun but I do hope you also understand that for me there is no fun in playing Skyscraper, win the first defensive round and lose all consecutive ones because if you play at a semi high level there is only one defendable site. Maps that offer very little variation of themselves like Kafe are too stale for me to enjoy. I rather play border 3 times which offers plenty of variation opportunity. 
---
That's the map pool, which I understand your view but I hope you understand mine as well. As for the rest of "pro league settings". Game mode: bomb. I guess I can understand people liking secure area. I had a friend who did and I really try to like it but couldn't. IMO we could have this competitive game mode and still allow people to play other game modes. Another part of the rules is no points showing, this was in the game at launch in the ranked mode and is so much better. Doing defense 3/4 times in a row and attack as well will I think improve adaptation of lesser skilled players. Say you are facing a team using a certain strat, right now many people half forget that strat as they first need to focus on attacking/defending themselves. If you are continuously on one side it's will be easier to remember and I don't think it has to many negatives. 
---
6th pick shouldn't be in ranked imo, adds to little except for a delay between rounds(though with the new settings that delay has decreased). Banning would be really interesting, don't see it hurting anyone to much except for people who only play one style every time, this could force them to choose different ops. 
---
I get your point, but I do hope you get mine. I play ranked for fun as well, of course I like winning tho but a good 4-4 overtime match is always enjoyable even if I lose. I just don't like maps where 90% of the rounds are basically already pre determined what side will win or where it plays exactly the same every round. 
---
Why does everyone want a 3 minute timer for casual?  The thing I like about casual is being able to take your time and not have to hurry but a 3 minute timer completely gets rid of that for me and would probably make me play the game even less than I already do.
---
Have a buddy who's mad jealous that I have this skin. I played both the alpha and the beta back in the day. Definitely come a long way.
---
Hey, thanks man!
---
r/nocontext
---
Yeah, that's why we were so devastated by the nerf. But a balance patch is a balance patch.
---
Ah that was rubbish.
---
same bro feels bad getting that sick 1 shot on a clueless operator was fucking golden
---
I‚Äôm basically a Thermite/Hibana main on my solo que account because of people‚Äôs unwillingness to use these ops 
---
Barely anyone sneakily cheats, they just get wrecked by good players. They just say that to make themselves feel better.
---
What? It's literally the same.
---
you could have made a loop out of this!
---
Those are actually really damn good 
---
Would be terrible and completely useless.
---
The game in general looked better then, but the lighting was really garbage, especially on day time maps.
---
HOW MUCH, AND WHERE DO I GET IT
---
leaning left uses the same eye if they dont switch hands. After all you simply said "lean".
---
nope this is ubisoft ruining your game, the biggest source of toxicity.
---
I didn‚Äôt know they brought the tank-hunter to Rainbow Six.
---
Good ideas! I‚Äôll keep note of those!
---
Down voting solely for the crouch spamming
---
Did you have cheat engine on or something
---
They look good! Imo the Alibi and Zofia need to be redone or tweaked though.
---
WAIT THIS IS A DEFENDER????
---
What on earth is wrong with you, we have budget lion on *defense* of all places??
---
The old lighting, the horrid filter when running out as a defender, the old UI, good times.
---
No he hasnt said that
---
Honestly, this is some poetic shit. I never thought I'd be saying that about Satan's attic rats playing limbo with the skill ceiling. But creativity is creativity, y'know. Kudos.
---
Yeah 100% pick rate lion was a real fun meta shift
---
I miss it so fucking much :'(
---
This rifle is so op

You need to read up on the bio and details man
---
Different gas masks work for different gases
---
For the record, this happened on console too at that time. It was a broken feature because it gave hiding spots away 90% of the time by just aiming around a room until you say a red icon.
---
Fuze on attack and Kapkan on defence. 
---
Actual Ash main doing their [job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1tkCc860f8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14).
---
What? Why? 
---
Too be continued 
---
Nope, was just an old setting that was on both console and pc in year 1. It was quite stupid as you could sometimes not even see someone but the name would pop up. 
---
It's not in the game anymore, on both pc and console
---
personally I would prefer competitive when joining with full party (or at least 4 people) - I wouldnt even mind if this mode would require 5 man party to join and "classic" ranked for solo/duo join amnd maybe even  as warmup.  
---
I would probably ignore casual unless it is fixed. (Excessive amount of leavers and griefers reduced, shown spawn/objective, reduced timer to match ranked and so on)
---
It's like saying "close your eyes and you won't see his dick" to somebody offended because they saw somebody naked in the street. Useless post.
---
Damn, it's been a while since I played siege, sorry I got it wrong.

The Nitro-&gt;Impact Grenade change to Caveira's loadout was actually a buff to her, unlike many operators who lost Nitros.

Tk is not gonna fix it. You are fighting cancer with cancer. Its just gonna make it worse.

Old Hereford was objectively Bad

*Peekaboo!*
---
That‚Äôs obviously a cloaker
---
No. +3 minutes to casual? No. One competitive mode, with last season map and operator introduced as the next season comes out. This gives a bigger safety net than League. Having two queues isn't going to get you to diamond.
---
They where some what common when the game first launched, but it's very rare it happens now
---
yea, sometimes that's true heh :D
---
It follows the same structure as normal smoke grenades used to, they changed those a while back to make them less random for client sided gameplay, but they have mentioned that Smokes cannisters will be looked at as well to make them also less random
---
Not sure I heard you right.
---
Did you mean: "read up on the bio and **D E T A I L S**"?
---
Get out of here salty kid.
---
Lesion is the best one

Yeah, they have been in games for ages and in movies even longer.

Discount for having season pass makes it 180k
---
They got removed One and a half Years ago. (still in Alpha Packs)
---
Really impressive, love the detail!
---
IMO changing position in any way should stop your ads. Not only for prone and crouch, but lean too.
---
Even if it's only half as bad as the crouch spam, leaning while shooting is still a bad mechanic that promotes cheap muscle memory over tactical choices.
---
Damn, didn‚Äôt know Siege was backwards compatible, I‚Äôm on Wii-U. I have been searching for a match for 25 days now, no luck so far :(
---
And people have used them for shits n giggles irl for literal decades
---
This wasn‚Äôt a clutch at all my dude. It was a really basic double kill.
---
Wait what I think I missed that reading his bio
---
Just bind crouching to space and put it on hold and you will see some miracles ahah but honestly it's not hard to do, but it's a dumb thing to exist in this game 
---
Unless its placed under a window, yes its more visible.
---
It simply got a bigger visual profile with the spikes sticking out of it, making it much easier to spot even when you not looking for it.
---
The benefit of the regular one is that its smooth, its got flat dark color so if you're focused on something else its much more likely that you won't spot it.
---
In a tight situation when time is an issue it probably won't make a difference when the attacker must rush or lose the round, but in every other situation the regular sticking out less.
---
There is a mute elite for it 
---
Would've been best to do this a few days ago with the steam winter sale, but you have to find the option in steam to permanently remove the game from your account, but you'll need a new uplay account regardless
---
I can easily imagine on what side of the toxicity you are :x
---
Nah, i would go classic for fun, for hostage and secure and to play with randoms when my friends are not online.   
---
Competetive only with pre-made of 5 so about 60% of my time in this game. (well why not make it that you can play it only when you have a full 5 stack of players? )   
---
OHHHH THIS WILL STING A LOT!!!
---
You can't get good in one queue and you think two will help? And banning the operators that cause you trouble it's s joke. Oh and you ruined casual
---
I'm not sure if steam handles refunds from uplay games, but you can try explain that you after you played you realized you made a mistake and you want a different version of same game. They've refunded me dlc for rocksmith when i had incompatible, newer version of the game, they refunded me Insurgency Sandstorm when I explained 3h of my gameplay was battling for more than one fps, maybe they'd help you too if you explain your situation.
---
I do not own the elite, but I know for a fact that one of the community devs said on twitter it will be available eventually.
---
Exactly.
---
Kapkan trap would most likely deafen the side which the trap get placed, smoke canister would have long lasting effect, capitao asphyxiating bolt would also burn a lot, operator without gas mask will cough walking on smoke grenade, gu mine will slow down op permanently (most likely and get more damaging if didn't pulled right away), operator that get caught by frost mat will not be able to walk (Their leg broke), Thermite and hibana will take more time to breach, echo drone will have longer effect ( when I mean longer is much-much longer ), Clash shield would stun the operator, same goes with bandit and kaid gadget I guess? IDK just making some another point out. 
---
YouTube Spawn peek
---
Now all we need is a reason to use chanka. 
---
Iam already copper 4 :P
---
This is in the game. With like the last couple bullets there is definitely a slight sound difference.
---
Damn the Kapkan and lesion ones are amazing
---
I have mixed feelings about this 
---
And maybe drones can't cross under is a good idea 
---
Fuck no it doesn‚Äôt 
---
Mute almost never had this problem, should learn from his mate sometimes
---
It doesn't depend on the barrel. It depends on the choke. Even then, that's for the spread of the shot, not the distance. Just goes to show, once again you don't know about guns and you don't know about realism. 
---
That‚Äôs a good idea in my opinion, would make castle a bi t more reliable 
---
Obviously it can't be Fully Realistic , that's still impossible in a video game to perfect 
---
But you get my idea , trying to get as close to realism as we can by dumping every false logic out of the window and balance
---
You guys are not wrong , I'm sorry if I sounded offensive by my "and what didn't you like" response my intention was positive , as in if you know better please tell me I'd love feedback .
---
In T-Hunt I always play Glaz, if there‚Äôs a dick which is shooting at me I just need one shot in the head. Btw what is the name of the song in the end 
---
No i found this model on thingverse a couple months ago and decided to give it a try
---
Article 5 is the darkest corner you can get into in the R6 ghetto
---
Pla
---
I know enough about guns to tell you that it would be effective in long range engagements , chokes are meant for range and even you know that , combine that with a long barrel and you increase the range your pellets are effective in .
---
I play on console as well and try to not go for headshots for that exact reason that it‚Äôs not worth it. I have been playing with shotguns a lot and find them extremely fun but inconsistent as all hell. One time you could be barrel stuffing the guy and only do 48 DMG. Another time it‚Äôs like you have slugs and you can one shot from across the map so just keep that in mind. And remember to pick your engagements
---
Neat.
---
Yes if you hip fire in game (right now) it reduces it
---

Defiantly. Would be awesome to see something like this worked in a couple of years down the line if it were to ever come in. In TTS maybe a mode like this that only allow operators that could actually exist irl like ash and mute, for example.

BIG FALLEN!

"Dump false logic" 
---
"Make helmets stop bullets"
---
I was just hoping for some actual realism
---
You have disappointed me.
---
Not with their current approach to the game. They are leaving it to rot away more or less atm and only care about making the 4 seasons. There is nearly zero communication from their side. It's dead already if you ask me. This subreddit was also way more active one year ago.
---
Doesn‚Äôt*
---
Mb, I actually stopped after the lion and finka expansion not 5-6 months 
---
yes
---
how do you get to the config file
---
Yeah , issues is , this is Ubisoft we're talking about , obviously this isn't gonna happen and since the start the mechanics fight against full realism so they'll have to rework almost every single thing .
---
Overall I'd love this to be an actual thing .
---
Anchor around the west external staircase. Use that as your entry and exit point.
---
4th floor is barn. You will see the spawn peek window to the right and the barbed wired door to the left.
---
3rd floor door leads you into site if you go north then west. 
---
Thanks!
---
Then idk because I have mine stretched and it works fine
---
But why would anyone in their right minds tune on aim assist
---
You wouldn't just get shot once and be left alone after that
---
I HOPE YOU READ THIS OP SCUMBAG!
---
I dunno if you noticed, but none of the characters from R6 are in Siege :P
---
Looks hella sus
---
What have you done.. 
---
Why have you forsaken us with this cursed image? 
---
Now... There's no room left for imagination, there's no mysterious figure anymore.. Only THIS.
---
Yeah fuze got smokes
---
And fuck echo in the process...
---
Then it's the TK for you!
---
I don't think using a teleport hack is "whooping" my ass but ok dude. 
---
Ik, but I want him in
---
Especially since its Article 5; that map is annoying with enemies.
---
I actually remember doing this in painting back in high school, it is quite handy!
---

---
I‚Äôd suggest they do this pre match? Like how there‚Äôs the pick and ban before a match starts, they could have a map pick phase? Just an idea
---
Is it the spawn teleport or the high ping one?
---
Almost did him! Maybe I will do some more soon. 
---
Time and place, man.
---
There is a cosplay subreddit, which she already posts to.
---
There's a reason there's a cosplay subreddit. It's to help differentiate what people see.
---
If people want to see cosplay, they can go to cosplay. If people want to talk about R6, they can come to R6. Cosplaying R6 can go to Cosplay, because that's literally what Cosplay is for.
---
Also, really? Despicable? That's the word you chose?
---
You do know that there's steps before outright hating someone, right? I hope more positivity occurs in your life, because I'm concerned with how quickly you are to hate people you don't know.
---
Plat every other season and I solo queue. Nice try with the flame. https://r6tab.com/e27bfc79-6a5c-43db-a82c-1f5eee24f723
---
This season has been a shitfest of cheaters. Teleport hackers every other game. This is because of the sale at the start of the season + Christmas sale and everyone knows it.
---
Thanks i appreciate it!
---
What?
---
You obviously got outplayed.
---
Haha thanks! Feel free to message me. I may make a etsy or something who knows. 
---
I don't understand why they don't just make them like the new smoke but yellow-translucent. That way you still can't really use them for sight obstruction but they are consistent and their AoE is immediately apparent.
---
What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land.
---
A lady of culture! She's definitely a favorite. Her and lesion are my favorite defenders. 
---
That would be pretty good but if there are some community favourite maps they would get picked all the time. Maybe make a system that won't let you vote for the same map you voted in the last or maybe even the the last few (2 or 3) games for
---
Sennheiser HD 800 S nothing less if you want to be gold or higher

Jokes on you its neither, its a goblin. That's what dokkaebi means :p
---
Solo and groups both work fine for me

Because of gems like these. 
---
I mean he prefired and the icon from being outside had already revealed the position
---
They'll never to be able to balance 100 ops. They're struggling rn at like 55
---
Doesn't your username have "Pro" in it? Bro, just learn to play better. It's not that hard.
---
Well thanks! I may decide on putting up a etsy or just taking aome messages if people are seriously interested. 
---
&gt; What are you on about? This is with no question the most casual friendly forum in terms of discussing Siege
---
What an agreeable view! Have my upvote! I will downvote that other guy because he is wrong.
---
Warming up the head level. I usually play 1 match of t hunt before ranked 
---
Yeah story wise this game is trash. That‚Äôs why the devs are lucky that multiplayer is good enough to hold most people‚Äôs attention. That being said us fans who actually read the book and still read the Jack Ryan series feel like we got the shaft on this one.
---
Thanks so much! I may sell some on etsy or something if I can figure it out and people are reallly interested. 
---
Lmao my friend told me to do her. I told them no way cuz I'd prob hella fuck her up. 
---
Same.
---
Owo i may make an etsy idk im blown away by everything rn
---
Considering R6 is meant for content revolving around R6 don‚Äôt you think some dressed as *someone from rainbow six siege* would fit on a sub for *rainbow six siege?* You‚Äôre essentially saying why would SAU-SIEGE put their comics in R6 instead of r/comics? Why would people put their fan art in R6 when it should be in r/art? Why should their be a subreddit for it at all? Why not just goto r/gaming . The fact you want to box content by what it is instead of subject value is just stupid. And I never said I hate you, nor despise you. I said you were despicable. You absolute bell end
---
D:
---
Dokk looks like a mammoth...I love it!
---
Shes hot. Would make her my girlfriend. 
---
Bruh moment
---
Lmao. I'll take it as long as you love it!
---
\#WINDOW BLOCKED!!!
---
&gt; Having the initially limited operator selection allows them to join with minimal investment and try out if they like the gameplay itself, the feel of things
---
This was the case for me. If I hadn't liked the game, I wouldn't have felt bad about wasting basically no money on it. I also bought For Honor's starter edition and realised pretty quickly it wasn't for me. As for R6, sure, it took me quite a while to unlock every op, but it is what it is and I still don't exactly *regret* buying it. I don't necessarily go around recommending it to new players, but I can see why some would prefer it.
---
–ë–ª—è–¥—å.
---
Was expecting the curb your enthusiasm theme
---
Literally. Narrow minded af 
---
I don't play this game, just seeing this on /r/all. But why's everyone so sure he's not cheating? He's starts firing at both players so instantly it's almost before they enter his field of view.
---
Out years before herford?
---
r/BetterEveryLoop
---
Yes. I know why he knew where he was. I'm saying to one tap pre fire and move on. Pre fire makes sense if you know, to one tap a pre fire that hits its target right as you move on? 
---
Witch-hunt bitch
---
I mean it‚Äôs in cas so it doesn‚Äôt really matter 
---
People don‚Äôt know what a flick shot is on this sub apparently lol
---
His body stayed consistent. The body was a huge target he could've shot
---
Because most people just ended up killing themselves with it.
---
Yeah I remember playing hot potato as fun. The YT montages were much better back then. 
---
The thing is before Wind Bastion the charms were in some sort of an order. For example the Elite skin chibi charms were first, then the seasonal ranked charms, then the LAN charms for watching LAN finals, then it went onto the normal chibi charms and then was mostly a mix of weekly challenge and store charms.
---
Now its just a complete mess and quite frustrating when you have over 250 charms that you have to slog through to find the ones you want to use. 
---
Do I have permission to use this?
---
Lacht in D√ºsseldorwer Platt
---
As much as I hate the crouch spamming meta, fucking everyone is doing it in high mmr and you have no chance at winning a gunfight without doing it too.
---
Yes, if you aim head level and have good timing, along with good awareness this makes sense.
---
Your title is confusing the shit out of me, man
---
Yeah kinda lol, but if the casual community is smaller why does it take longer to queue in ranked vs cas?
---
Yes but... the map choices should never be repeated until every map has been voted on at least  once. 
---
You can stop worrying about TOXIC BABES IN POSITION 
---
Oof. Yes I love shooting enemies with BB guns üòÇ
---
Can we also point out how broken it is having Maverick on a map that's literally 90% soft walls? Even sledge and buck can open a wall and hold cross map angles,and there just aren't enough reinforcements to defend it effectively.
---
read the sub rules genius. nobody wants to see your witch hunt 
---
more than just that one factor...
---
Why? Pick/Ban is supposed to be for ops you don‚Äôt like or that are strong (Meta). Why would you ban an average (let‚Äôs assume) operator, when you could ban Blitz, BB, Lion, Jackal, or Dok?
---
It is before he entered his field of view. When a person on the defending team in this game leaves the main building for more than a few seconds, they get marked with a label above their head. this guy was able to prefire where he was going to be because the defender went outside, giving the effect of wallhacks or something like that 
---
haha well i hope they add something soon
---
How can there be so much happening in one single image
---
Glad to hear it's not just me then lol.
---
I‚Äôm talking about just throwing the map into ranked without people getting experience with it first
---
U r salty because you got you‚Äôre cheeks clapped 
---
A Caveira main...
---
Represent 
---
Who is their main rival?
---
Karma is real lads 
---
That's so time-consuming. Like if anyone trying to uninstall and reinstall the game a number of times.
---
Maybe for casual. It could easily make it so some maps are never played
---
Oh really? So I've played 1750 games since I started during operation health and never once have I seen someone one tap a pre fire while playing or while watching Macie Jay, Pro League and other youtubers. None of them can I remember off the top of my head where they one tapped a pre fire and moved on bc they knew it'd hit. If you have the awareness you wanna talk about you shoot a few times then flick. The op died milli seconds after he started moving his reticle. 
---
did you die or just get injured?
---
Please use condoms. I don't want to see your child get teamkilled after they do something wrong because they didn't know how something works.
---
lol you said do do... üòÇ
---
Seems suss even so great flick
---
Check your mouses polling rate. Should be 1000 afaik
---
I think they should remove the progress bar from the screen if they aren't going to sync it properly, the fact that when collecting Rook amour the bar finishes about one or two seconds early has always bugged me
---
Oh calm down buddy 
---
Or PC gameplay. Definitely possible with a mouse and damn near every shooter I play I'm pretty sure I'm playing against this guy. 
---
send this to ubi support
---
Valve/Steam, obviously. How isn't that obvious from my message and the context of the thread? 
---
I have so many videos of toxic and hacking people. It's so frustrating. So many "squad" bullying / tks / votekicks. 
---
Link your account. Anyways OP could see the second guy for almost a full 3 seconds before he transfered to him. Pay closer attention.
---
Twitch f2 vs Echo MP5SD with body shots only? You crazy!
---
Pepehands
---
Buff ela?
---
Makes sense! I assumed the player label was only in the replay. Definitely seems like not cheating then, thanks for explaining.
---
I feel Like maverick should get an elite skin
---
I remember in Black ops one u used to be able to vote for the previous map an infinite number of times. They removed it in all games after that.
---
Why The fuck would you spend $600?
---
Yeah it is wrong what they are doing. But I somehow get how frustrating it can be if teammates reinforce important rotations
---
If you insist.
---
For example move people around channels, move myself to a different channel, type messages, adjust other peoples mic volume, mute/unmute my mic (which doesn't work in R6 with my keybinds).
---
If you key bind discord you don‚Äôt need an overlay just saying. I don‚Äôt ever need to go into mine. 
---
CSGO chats are great. Always someone blasting music.
---
I have only one ICE skin, that too for buck shotgun, I prefer c8.
---
Keybind what?
---
The same thing is in CoD and CSGO you can specially select map, and people don't have problems with it.
---
And if we add all maps back to pool its more rare to have always same maps to be voted from.
---
This was a study based on [Mia's awesome cosplay](https://www.instagram.com/mia._.plays/?hl=en), trying to learn to 'paint' paint this year.
---
No thank you. I dislike Favela and Yacht, but I'd rather play more than 3 maps overall.
---
Yeah
---
Absolutely not. In competitive games, map voting is not cool.

---
Good ace but why you gotta use M/K?
---
This woulda been neat. If it wasn't a crosspost, and also OC.
---
If they only do 3 seasons then they better have mid season reinforcements. I'm not about to have a game breaking bug be in the game for 4 months. I just don't think PvE is where they should be spending time on. The PvE is not what got this game to this point (popularity wise) so I personally don't think that at this point they should worry about it much
---
Because it is marketed as a tactical, slow shooter.
---
Its missing sledge 
---
It usually always is. 
---
Then maybe the problem is the maps, not the voting system.
---
I wont lie thats kinda sad
---
She cute
---
I don't understand, still.
---
Yeah like I'm mostly meaning those times when you're playing and then there is a steady ticker of deaths on the other team. Sometimes I think they're trying to play for the extra challenge but when it turns into 2v5 they almost never win because 5 monkeys with trigger fingers is enough then. XD
---
I usually guess something like "Wow they were winning but it must be like a band breaking up, they secretly hated each other!" 
---
I would like to actually play tower 
---
Yes, you have a point, but when does Ubi actually ever follow up on an issue within the first half a year of it being a problem?
---
Th re only time i use M&amp;K is qhsn im writing a long message and it would take a half a hour to so on controller
---
In my opinion, shroud has some of the worst opinions about games ever. He plays a lot of them, but he doesn‚Äôt know that much about what makes them fun or how to play games in the intended ways. Every time I watch one of his videos I have to pause it and laugh about some dumb thing he says. 
---
*snap*
---
Painting is awsome but eeeew ash 
---
Why?
---
Absolutely yes, then you're just rats hiding in a cage of your own making. 
---
Unplayable without headphones
---
I've had a friend that literally got hit by a signal one. We didn't have a jager we didn't shoot it. It literally was ima get you and went for him
---
That is reporting for cheating.
---
K byw
---
Now it‚Äôs more arcade
---
Just add an Op ban phase and grace periods, and make casual identical to ranked but without a rating.
---
I feel proud that I got 7 in a day after they buffed the smg11. It seems to down people a good bit. 
---
Just like GMod
---
3,2,1 drop it *plays Ali a intro*
---
No.
---
Too lazy to type in my reasoning but no.
---
u/stabbot_crop
---
Your ADS uses your hipfire sensitivity to multiply off of. So you need to set your ADS to 83 to match your hipfire. If you then change your hipfire sensitivity your ADS sens will match it if it's always set to 83. It can't work the other way around. 
---
Some walls and occasionally doorways (castle repeatedly blocking the same door off is a big offender here) are so valuable to keep unreinforced, that you're better off playing with a man down than letting some retard reinforce it.
---
I still play on both
---
Great addition to the conversation, how dare I have limited time in my day to play games, I simply can‚Äôt play for 40 minutes, that means I would play like 2 games? While now I can get 3 or 4 depending 
---
I've only ever killed someone for reinforcing once and that was because they ruined my rotation hole

Excuse me, but Kapkan is a 2 armor, tyvm. Respect the weight loss.
---
Console seems to only be a bit more toxic than PC but it‚Äôs hard to say for sure either way
---
Why is pick ban more toxic than teamkilling? Which would you rather have a teammate do: ban your favorite operator or just teamkill you?
---
I thought team killing was the objective 
---
Did you break you wrist with that
---
Representing
---
Did you cut out frames between shots? Because the timer went from :07 to :04 in a second lol
---
Ima need ur mouse, sens, multiplier, DPI and adderal supplier
---
If you speak in a verbose and grammatically correct manner, you are deemed intrinsically more knowledgeable and deserving of upvotes, hence her name.
---
Why should the games competitive scene be hindered by people who have no intention of playing? Just play casual. The proposed new rank would bridge the gap between pro League and the casuals. If we lose 10% of the people who play ranked I'm fine with that.
---
Glitch.         
---
Timer went from 3:07 to 0:04
---
Haha yeah I‚Äôve had many finishes with the hammer but just never got an actual straight up kill until last night, always got rekt any time I tried 
---
Most of the guns have fake names 
---
mint hotancold pojo have been together since season 1 jarvis has been on and off with them and they just picked up nyx last season (hotancolds cousin) DZ was SK and SK used to be flipside
---
Yeah, after I lowered mine, I can't even use higher dpi on the desktop.
---
And?
---
Lmao my guy you realize what I post is totally okay and not against any YouTube guidelines so what‚Äôs the point of reporting it lmao 
---
I think I have 3? Smokes shotty, the revolver and one of iq's guns
---
You could just mute them
---
I'd probably look like I'm spazzing out if I tried playing at those numbers.
---
Agreed
---
Yes they do..I absolutely hated playing dust 2 because there is always a few people who all they do is play dust 2 with a awp all day 
---
Can see it now, Coastline or House is always picked. No other maps will see the light of day
---
What happened to Cav?????

Cheating is fun?
---
This is one of the rare times I don't play with at least 2 friends.
---
no 1 caressss!!!! xD
---
You don't know what reporting does? 
---
It‚Äôs a suppressed memory
---
Because his self esteem is so low that cheating to achieve victory is the only thing that gives him some sense of accomplishment 
---
Always been there. Its the same roster, they just changed orgs.
---
Yeah hello vac, we got sus plays inbound
---
Yep
---
He‚Äôs a defender.
---
You can add me
---
Ahh okay.
---
they cant even fix refular ranked, how would they do thisüòÇüòÇ
---
They have a ton of fixes, just trying to figure out how to fit them into a lootbox. 
---
I personally like him AK
---
Uhh... INVISIBLE poison in a can with a needle that sticks you regardless of how you step on it. lol.
---
You questioned OPs opinion take on realism. Not the games integrity to Tom Clancy‚Äôs vision. Not to mention the fact that the game is not at all what Tom Clancy would imagine/make if he were alive during the development.
---
Can't wait for the golds in this sub to go apeshit when they find out.
---
He's a defender
---
It's not rocket science, it was pretty obvious to understand that the toxic person got removed from the match.
---
I prefer veoto system more similar to halo 3. Enough veoto will give u another random map. I hate fevela so much 
---
Time to kill and reloading wise no, but hell of a lot more ammo and suppressing fire, definitely 
---
üòâ
---
Max dmg on her pistol is now 65 from 99
---
Increased recoil
---
Increased hipfire spread
---
Deceased mag size from 15 to 12
---
Made her pistol dmg dropoff more like normal pistols (the only good thing about all this)
---
Bro maybe they are just so much better they dont even try hard.
---
How does he initiate the EMP?
---
Thank you for the explanation friend!
---
I would shoot myself if I was forced to play bomb only...
---
If he keeps playing he will be raised up to his own level relatively quickly.
---
It sucks, but MMR doesn't carry over to different regions 
---
Right? Nuketown got old after the first time you played and got spawn killed by the same guy who didn't move with his sniper every time and every time you got the drop on him, fookin mine right there. 
---
Oh, that's fair. I just have someone who goes to the same school I do and his was like 2k and some change so I figured most were kinda pricey 
---
Nice, love the art style.
---
Or FORTNITE profile picture. In fact it should probably give you bonus points for it.
---
Well TS isn‚Äôt final. Hopefully. TGN will not be happy about this.
---
There's a spider on her head.
---
Don't forget socks
---
Just jump in and okay. Rank doesn‚Äôt matter at all especially for a new player. Because you choose your spawns/defend site you learn the maps so much faster and you‚Äôll be come way better the more ranked you play. Go on. Get wrecked. Learn what the enemy did. Adapt. Improve. 
---
Wot in tarnation? That's worse than seeing the satan worshipping corpses floating in the air. 
---
100th operator will be a maverick counter.
---
Born in 1978 but in his childhood his mother was murdered by a robot? Lol
---
I probably need to do this but, you know, lazy. 
---
Big sad for my cropped pic of IQ then
---
because ranked is full of smurfs, derankers, and assholes. at least casual only has smurfs and assholes!
---
"Map so bad no one wants to play it? leave it in casual."
---
And fuze and montagne 
---
same, i hate it. still spending all my renown looking for a usable black ice gun to main
---
My first thought was that twitch should be there instead but IQ can help Maverick find Kaids electric thingy, while Twitch can easily be seen and destroyed
---
Tk anyone who‚Äôs not a maestro main 
---
In what circumstances would his ability be useful?
---
Ao fucking true
---
Imagine wasting all that money on a subpar game
---
Is it same yt channel?
---
It's funny that runouts are basically never mentioned in these "castle rework" posts when something like this would be insanely op in that situation. You'd need some major sound cue and like you mentioned some sort of penalty.
---
The magazine might be. :D
---
Now its Firing Range all day, every single day, what a shit map too.
---
loading as smoke is loud as hell too. 
---
LOADING NEW MAGAZINE
---
I figured. Since it zooms out because it's the last shot - probably. But if you were aimbotting I wouldn't know better.
---
Still takes two shots at that range...
---
Why is only one guy freaking out about it!?
---
This is definitely a big drawback to playing Casual.
---
Controller severs god Google keybourd sucks dick
---
sorry threw a emp grenade at my pc 
---
My headset only cost me 30 bucks just go on amazon. 
---
XD why not
---
Does his name happen to be the n-word
---
Praise Tachanka it is!
---
This would easily be fixed with a system like it was in MW2. The game would show you the map it's going to be, and you can vote to skip to another random map and you're forced to play it.
---
Yes.
---
I play on PC. And yes, MP5 does really on headshots a lot. :)
---
It be like that sometimes 
---
No. But MW2s system could work, which is only one map and you can vote to skip to a random map.
---
I mean i see what youre trying to say but a high DPI with pulling down on the mouse to control the recoil isnt smooth. the whole point of lower DPI for recoil control makes everything smoother and have more control. if you look up pro players configs they all have low mouse DPI for that reason. I also wouldnt consider PUBG and VR games  "competetive" gaming but if youre having fun then all good. but 3600 DPI? that is hell of insane man. my GF plays on some insane high sens also and its funny when we play on each others set up because of the difference in play style. Anyways, I dont mean any offense and im not trying to fight. people have their preferences.
---
Hello im-already-bastion,
---
That flick though
---
Didnt we more or less get that with Wind Bastion?
---
It‚Äôs just like that when you go to see a character outfit

Kel-tek has done more with pretty plastics and polymers than most firearm companies do with any material

That do be true

Rank doesn‚Äôt really matter but if you want to mess around play casual

I've been diamond every season since blood orchid and this is by far the worst season toxicity wise. When you're at the plat one, diamond elo pretty much every game will have a couple MnK users. Its littering this game. I remember when i first started playing and the state at which the game is at right now is really bad. The game itself has improved tremendously but the community on console is driving this game into the dirt. People will do anything to win even if it includes cheating with a keyboard. 
---
So long story short, console has a MASSIVELY uneven playing field and its only getting worse. I play on PC as well and just don't enjoy playing on that platform. I've always enjoyed playing with a controller and my One X allows me to play in 4k. But I'm getting left in the dust with the whole MnK issue. I refuse to buy an adapter. I refuse to be a part of the problem 
---
Hit me with that recruit elite skin 
---
what if they have it so you can only vote for the upcoming map one time,  so a new one will come next, instead of only playing one map constantly.

Talking about my gun. Yes, his does.
---
But just remove it from the queue after you play it and add it back in when you feel like playing it again. Csgo is popular enough that all 7 maps have decent queue. Taking out a map because you don‚Äôt want to play it twice in a row shouldn‚Äôt as big as a problem as you‚Äôre making it.

The old issue with fuze was that the hockey-pucks slid like they were lubed up and on ice, and could bounce upto 6x it was pretty retarded, I have so many old videos cluster charging a room and killing people 2 rooms or 2 floors away

rip siege, nerfing the people that dont need to be nerfed, focus on fixing your fucking broken ass rubber band lag, crouch spamming mouse and key game instead. if not then rip im already tired of this game, its going to shit
---
What is this?  A png for ants?
---
I think I was in that game
---
Yeah I need to work on the biography, I just thought it was an interesting idea so that he would really hate tech.
---
Actually from what I know, Cav did 65 damage even before nerf on 12 meters. This isn't going to change - but she will no longer get that insane damage buff when up close. 99 is insane - especially that she can soften you with impact grenades - that's especially true against shields - one impact and she will one-shot you. :)
---
Wtf how high is your sens you have to turn it down?
---
It was a big fix.
---
It‚Äôs disgustingly unfair. Massive props to be in Diamond during this plague. It‚Äôs annoying how they think they‚Äôre good when they‚Äôre coming up against thumbs when they have they‚Äôre whole hands to aim
---
Youre bad
---
This got deleted FAST
---
i miss this map
---
For people confused, this won‚Äôt effect higher play barely at all.   
---
This nerf is to help in lower ranked where she‚Äôs a monster.
---
Stop being a bitch
---
You are right, but nobody mentioned that the new damage is less confusing for new players
---
I really don't understand why Ubi is doing this. Cav is an operator with a really high skill floor. It differs from ops like Finka or Rook in the sense that you need certain level of skill to be efficient with it; you need good map knowledge, a good understanding of the game mechanics, and more specific things like when to go for the interrogation and when to just go for the kill. You can't just pick her up and get utility out of her. Just as she has a high skill floor, she has a high skill roof, if you master her, you can get tons of utility out of her. That's why she has the win Delta she has. This nerf really doesn't do much more than kill Cav in the eyes of the player base. 
---
She dealt 19 damage at 13 meters before
---
Because it's a basic flick shot?
---
Before this past week I would have went with doc, but lately I've been digging tokm
---
I actually really like this bundle for tachanka. Just wish there was more color on the uniform
---
with that argument, she will be even more useless now. Way to ruin an operator.
---
For me I've been locked out once. I want to know how long the additional ones are too
---
It‚Äôs better then getting the hose again
---
At 13 meters she did 19 damage. Now Cav is going to be better at range thanks to this ‚Äúnerf‚Äù
---
Yes, it's easy for me to understand it cuz I have 2000+ matches on my account and I follow news - but new player will be confused.
---
Because Thatcher is the strong SAS operator 
---
YEA BUT.... yea...
---
Disgusting

Hello There
---
I‚Äôd have to say on Xbox, MNK users maybe show up once day but I play upwards of 15-20 matches a day. I play with a fairly reliable five stack of almost all platinums and even when we find one it‚Äôs usually not that big of a deal because people have to use third party adapters to use them they only have a controllers input capacity making the advantage so minimal 
---
Caps mate. Use caps to show that INTENSITY
---
Both. GIGN brothers for life.
---
Weird haha I can run the regular versions fine.
---
Make new acc and buy the game on that acc, tho better dont cuz its dick move. Usualy only cunts smurf. 
---
How on earth is that fishy?
---
You can only play it twice tho...
---
What a flick
---
Fuck off.
---
Unless they imply a system where you can‚Äôt vote for the map you just played

I like Fortress and it does a similar thing with the boys too lmao

[Found the more recently updated version ](https://youtu.be/64e7J3xHix0) 
---
Seems like this one is patched now too but just interesting to see. If you search up how to unlock all operators in rainbow 6 you‚Äôll probably find the other ones too.
---
The YouTube comments indicate it works for Thunt still. 
---
They also gave her more hipfire spread and recoil
---
WOAH WOAH WOAH OHH
---
Just dont die, stupid
---
Subtly?
---
Now we need to find the fourth one!
---
Wtf is this shit. It provides neither funny, nor useful. It's just a smart-ass comment that does nothing.
---
Maybe not so much on Oregon but she's great on maps like Villa, theme park and Hereford (some objectives better than others) 
---
Yes to map, no to mode.
---
Her whole gadget is based around her pistol and they‚Äôre gonna nerf it? People complain way too much. About 2 out of 5 games will I find a cav main and they‚Äôre not even good at all. 
---
I actually find casual a drag sometimes because of that 1 extra minute.....
---
In ranked, ppl are more serious (I think) and so you will feel like you are in action all the time,  even if it's just staying on cam for callout.
---
She kinda looks like Natasha Rominof
---
No guns for the aus ops. They only have hungry joeys, boomerangs, and fairy bread

Look like aimlock lol

Doesn't make sense how he's left out of the SMG fun since he would be just as balanced with it as the other ops.

Well yeah, that's what's awesome about the map, lot's of deaths but lot's of kills. The greatest back in the day for xp grinding. Also works awesome for private match stuff.

You can tell it‚Äôs accurate because the Scorpion is point straight into the air like it always does after the stupid Grim Sky nerf.

Hello Msmrme,
---
Thanks! I guess I know what I‚Äôm buying
---
So you're saying that it is completely impossible to learn a different kind of playstyle? Also, I'm pretty sure Vigil/Bandit/Jager/Etc do just as good a job at roaming as Cav, minus the ability to interrogate which you might not always be able to get. 
---
LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE
---
Than it could be a little bit less strict maybe if you get 3 punish within 24 hour than you get a ban which than takes longer than 30 min
---
Yeah, Finka is the one of the 3 that doesn't need the frags, but benefits her playstyle a lot.
---
How
---
Ahhhh totally forgot about that, thanks !
---
I can pm you some more pictures later if you want.
---
ugly af lol
---
That's a bit harsh because if we do that the games not gonna be able to tell from those who are rage quitting and those who need to leave for something or matches people are just leaving due to a cheater.
---
Basically the only way to do it is to hurt everyone

Same, after months of inactivity i decide to return and this is what i encounter... Just learned they removed night maps from ranked too.

Lower DPI is objectively better, unless you don't have mousespace. Lower sensitivity=more control=playing better.

It's just a clan tag. Are you 12? Because I play casual with 4 of my friends all the time. Only difference is that nobody knows we are friends as we don't all have the same name. Doesn't make a difference. I've beaten "clans" as a solo queue even in ranked. It's just a name.
---
I just want Sam Fisher to be an operator as an attacker. He could go invisible to all cams or be sneaky like Cav. 
---
Yeah, though the P226 is really, really good, I still think he deserves it, especially since all the other SAS operators have it, and there‚Äôs better alternatives(Maverick)
---
I love it tbh. 
---
Hello d1stroyer5555,
---
Why are playing article 5 to begin with lmao
---
I can hear the guy laughing lol
---
Rip cav in the new TTS
---
"Excuse me it's  ma'am" 
---
Kind of looks like Amy Poehler
---
I can't find any patch notes. Where do you have this from?
---
Her stated age is 31 and her birth year is 1986 which would have Operation Dust Line (released in 2016) set in 2017. Ubisoft was just a little optimistic in its estimate of how quickly a woman would pass SEAL training. Although, an Olympic swimmer does seem to stand the best chance.
---
Which is a fine change, because it's fucking stupid that a pistol did 99 damage. 
---
Scanning typically gives worse results than taking a picture, pasting it in Photoshop or similar programs, cropping it and making the picture all black and white and adjusting some of the midtone values to make them less prominent. It's a bit more work but will honestly give better results.
---
I can hear the guy laughing lol 
---
No, I am one of the unicorns that enjoys Favelas and will most likely never see it again. 
---
I use bandit as well, I love his mp7 but still, you're missing my point, I don't like defending as much as I like attacking, and you can't tell me that both def and atk is balanced... The attackers have way more strong suits than defenders and by that I mean their weaponry... I mean my opinion means nothing on the internet I know, but still... Cav is my fav defending op and to know this is happening kinda hurts lol
---
You're a lying virgin, nerd.
---
It works out mostly okay, as long as i can get the wall reinforcements down quickly. 
---
which is hard with uncooperative teammates. if you have no additional hardware to setup, you really should be out looking for a hatch or a farther away wall to reinforce, instead of turning around right at spawn and reinforcing the first wall available to you. 
---
save the easy walls for people who have stuff they need to do! 
---
SMG is now full auto
---
I'm not twelve. Why Don't you go ranked? 
---
Why did she have Ryu‚Äôs jawline
---
Would be odd if you were speaking Italian and your friends didn't understand
---
I got mine when you could buy the bundles with Renown for a short period.
---
We were so happy.
---
May I make a statement, this is the TTS, it is not final, they could test it and scrap it. I hope they buff her SMG to make it at least useable besides headshotting
---
I think that should happen on all games. But who am I but some random gamer.
---
My friends can‚Äôt login on Xbox (EUS and CUS servers), but I‚Äôm on Xbox on east US servers just fine. Weird.
---
Wait really?

I have this but never use it because it looks like complete ass. The coolest old universal skins are the piranha skin, chupinazo (bull skin), and the red crow dove skin. 
---
Of course
---
But since then the GAME headed a direction i dont really like we need a Kind of seperated Server with only season1 or 2 OPs and maps
---
Oh thanks for that

Imagine nerfing cav instead of lion.....
---
[Real] (https://i.redd.it/fwbzbafzdj8z.png) - [Damage] (http://i.imgur.com/wm3PcWt.png)
---
I've had a few games as Cav where the other team wisens up immediately after I get 3-4 kills on the first round. They're super terrifying, because you have a lion and dokkaebi combo on you, with a Blitz just sprinting at you. It completely destroys any roamer, and cav isn't an exception. Really, just have everyone stay in a group(even 2 people is generally enough) and putting down claymores/checking behind you every so often is generally enough to counter her. Seriously, her pistol is more akin to a semi auto shotgun, with similiar damage drop off(it's actually more severe).
---
But yeah, guess we'll see if Ubi repeats the IQ nerf, completely undeserving and just crippling them for most players.
---
Top 10 Amiibo
---
That‚Äôs why they nerfed the MP5 lol, to nerf Rook.
---
Next up: Ubi will nerf Mira because Silvers are complaining.
---
Then they will remove Thermite because his holes are to big and remove Glaz's scope because he's too good at sniping.
---
House would be voted like nuketown
---
Because not all my friends want to play ranked. I have a ranked squad and a casual squad. You're probably going to tell me that I should only be playing ranked as a Diamond player.
---
I‚Äôm on xbox east services and it‚Äôs not working for me
---
She dominates way to hard at lower ranks
---
^this 
---
its super handy for determining the direction of attackers from the explosion sounds, and slows their progress a bit.
---
My PoE characters are all named in honour of this
---
It's only Advanced Edition, but it's 18 dollars which is 77% off so it's a killer deal. Just 3 bucks more than starter.
---
I'm not trying to drag my mouse 12 inches to spin around. Higher DPI with good control is better. 
---
I can't believe they are nerfing an already underpowered defender.
---
u/aidano101 yo the official R6 Twitter posted your clip lol
---
Right man you hear they got cav and ur asshole puckers 
---
They are something worse than that.
---
But there are other balance changes which I would argue are more of immediate concern, such as making tachanka, castle viable and reworking lion completely, then deleting global abilities in favor of more skilled gadgets. 
---
This is a nice change but it‚Äôs not enough 
---
Well that's mighty tough. Maybe they should learn from their mistakes and get better instead of whining about it.
---
:'( 
---
Potato head
---
Ahh yeah you're right. I don't play Cav and don't run into her very often. Still this is a good change, IMO.
---
Well that's just it. You have to do whatever trickery you can as a defender because you have to deal with so many attacking operators that are more or less uncounterable. Dokki, Lion, Jackal, Finka 
---
Naive player 
---
the jitter! lmao i wouldve been the same nice clutch 
---
You're right but I think their logic with the change is to \*force\* the Cav to make the other team change their plans by managing their fights not merely by her being picked. If a player is a decent Cav, using map info, cam's, silent step, and CQB will still make her effective. 
---
But what about monty
---
I'm not telling you anything to play. I'm Just not understanding why you play casual... 
---
The difference is 1
---
Ps happy cake day
---
Which is so fucking stupid. Let's nerf a balanced and reliable gun that didn't require a change for years, because of a single statistic.
---
I love the CO loosing his shit on the side!
---
A lot of people are annoyed at Cav‚Äôs pistol, and the Devs themselves have stated that she has a high win delta (ie she wins more games if she‚Äôs in a squad than if she‚Äôs not).
---
These changes are supposed to bring her pistol more in line with other pistols (ie the damage reduction and drop-off.
---
No matter what the overall power of an operator is, there is no excuse for them to have something that is too powerful. If balancing that makes them too weak, then they need something else buffed, which I bet the devs plan to do after the many operator reworks they have planned.
---
2 shots at even mid range because the damage stays above 50.
---
Guys, a total fucking idiot who can't do basic math here. Real smartass you are /s
---
Nothing at all has been confirmed.  
---
Yes but you if you want to argue a point, you can not move the goalpost to, say "moving into a neighborhood".
---
&gt;You lost
---
You saying that doesn‚Äôt mean I did
---
im fine with everything here except the mag cap, that is fucking stupid. If i can only pull a flank reliably on one person, that is a really bad change, and makes cav hyper situational which i think will lead to everyone just picking other ops. Nomad is bad enough, I think they need to leave roamers alone until they figure out whether or not they want attackers to totally fuck them without having to put in any effort ie lion, dok, nomad. 
---
100% I agree and I'm not a main or a hater of Cav
---
I tried editing my post, maybe it helps.
---
No, it‚Äôs fine, they already fucked her up the ass in Grim Sky.
---
They‚Äôll usually fire about 2-3 bursts before reloading. The shotguns are kind of hard to deal with because they can cancel the reload and shoot instantly after they have one shell in. 
---
I knew he was going to disconnect! Freaking called it 
---
I just think that ubi is nerfing people that shouldn‚Äôt be nerfed (such as iq) instead of buffing the underwhelming ops 
---
Using real life examples to dictate game balance is never a good idea. 9mm vs. .308 is irrelevant in a video game where you need balance. Dokkaebi has a much better primary than what Cav has available. 
---
Cav's pistol damage is a unique operator function just like gadgets on other operators -- and was compensated through other balance tweaks such as massive drop-off damage. The 99 dmg only applies when you are very close, any further and it drops off significantly.
---
Also hard to call something "horrifically" broken when we're talking about an op that is almost never used/seen in higher rank gameplay.
---
&gt;  and the only ones who don't admit it are cav mains. 
---
This sounds more like salt -- and I'm a Hibana main.
---
Instead of telling him how to do better and be an actual decent human being, u just kill a teammate? Ruin the game everyone and especially him? Make a 4 v 5 out of of the blue and it will probably drag through the whole match, because he wants to kill you, kick you or you kill him again next round? I talked to idiots like you again and again and you guys are just as much toxis as ignorant. Take the tip with for condom for real, would ya?
---
why do you keep responding lmao
---
you're so mad
---
The thing we‚Äôre struggling with is the enemy‚Äôs coming from behind
---
Because Blitz is a fair and balanced operator.
---
Im not
---
I'm about 95% sure they aren't updating her in game model just the splash art
---
Yup, Ubi's anti-cheat is really bad. It can't even spot people teleporting, which is insane. idk why this post is getting downvoted but whatevs :)
---
I don't feel comfortable any more...
---
Let me have my 2d anime chicks.
---
That's... true
---
I think it is real because i saw a tweet somewhere about the cav nerf. Not sure thou.
---
Yeah and it especially tends to happen when people are walling. They know where you're aiming.
---
&gt;2 shots even at mid range because the damage stays above 50
---
But that‚Äôs not the point.  That‚Äôs what her SMG is for.  Her Lusion is for extreme CQB.  If they wanted her to be good at range, they could‚Äôve buffed her SMG, or just left her the fuck alone like they should have
---
Tell teammates (if you have any to cover flanks)
---
It is legit.  Didn‚Äôt you see the front page?

&gt;in what universe is a suppressed 9mm handgun supposed to deal more damage than a .308 battle rifle?

Buy Cap. If used right he's one of the best Ops to use in a squad. A lot of easy kills to be had with his firebolts through drone holes and murder holes
---
I think the Damage nerf was acceptable,but increased recoil and reduced mag size was way to much.Moreover cav is super easy to counter with good communication and drone play!
---
Well cav is now fucking useless. Yeet.

Congratulations bro! I remember how excited I was when I got my first diamond! Next step try and get far into diamond :)

I play Aus servers which is arguably the most toxic wasteland of all servers. Riddled with mouse and keyboarders and worse of all.... ddossers. I cant count the amount of times the other team has ddossed/crashed the server so they dont lose.

This is pretty dumb, her schtick is that she was high risk, high reward. For her Luison to do 99 you had to be 2-5 feet next to the enemy with a secondary, then the damage drop off makes it pretty crappy. You are restricted from using her main ability while using primaries which are both some of the worst in their categories, her smg boasting low damage, low rpm and her shotgun having very low damage. Now she's completely underpowered on all fronts, thanks Ubi.

Lmao they should just replace his VSN with a PPSH-41 and that should be his gadget, or maybe incendiary rounds for the SAIGA?

i bet you made that

While I am ok with most of these changes, I want to address the "bubble" only Fabian lives in. A decent portion of the playerbase DOES play 5 man only. Even more will 3 to 4 stack as well. Even still, the game design generally assumes communication will happen.

Not every game has to appeal to every player; that's a great way to make a really boring game. One of the signature points about Siege is how high the learning curve is and that's fine. Also one of the reasons I play Siege is because it's not CS so to me saying that CS does something is a good reason not to here. If people like that style of game they're welcome to it, and I'm not trying to sound hostile; but I like a different type of game and I think it's fine for different games to do things differently.

---
My only concern was the recoil on console. How is it?
---
No, but Ubisoft nerfing her does üòÇ
---
Sorry king
---
Epic.
---
So are we just supposed to drone the entire map until we find cav? Then what we find her and then she relocates too a different part of the map. That‚Äôs just a waste of time. Also even when she‚Äôs not 2 meters away she still does a shit ton of damage. 
---
You should be sad little burrito

You don‚Äôt see me complaining about Docs 3 dmg nerf when that was unnecessary in my opinion. That‚Äôs how things work when you grow up. Radical acceptance of things you can not control.

About time! Crazy how people think she‚Äôs not OP. Her pistol is like a Fucking sniper. People just like playing OP characters, so almost no one complains.

I think the lack of a map in rainbow is one of its biggest charms. It encourages you to learn the maps yourself. Knowing the position of your friends is vital, but having to relay that information to each other is just a part of rainbow, and without it, the team aspect of the game would not be anywhere near as good. 
---

Just depends on what you're into.
