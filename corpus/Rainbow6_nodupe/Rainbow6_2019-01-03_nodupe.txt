That's because you've only played 200 hours. There's a decent amount.

---
Ik this is from mission impossible from the comments, but can use link the scene? Just so ik what ur talking about
---
my sides
---
A person who watches anime
---
Un-friendzone him pLeAsE for our sake
---
Me too. I also usually choose the deployable shield because it basically forces the attackers to either shoow through the holo and get pinged or deal with it and lose time.
---

---
I can just imagine coming out the shower only to hear a THUNK and get my leg fucked up
---
It clearly says “rotated by random”
---
If it’s a stupid idea Ubisoft will keep it in for at least a year or two.
---
Yes, it is still broken. 
---
Why does it look mega streched?
---
Be patient man, theres like over 100 people posting this about their missing renown, ubisoft will fix it soon
---
Clearly outplayed /s
---
Feel free to show me a screenshot of this supposed room. Did you mean Restaurant? Fountain? Lounge? There is no room called dining room.
---
You won't get lost or feel awkward on theme park once you've played it enough, it is a bit too dark though
---
i’m sad no one got my thanos reference
---
SLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIN'!!!!
---
Already hate the fuck out of Mr. Shieldface-- lets add a shield to everyone's face.
---
But all these rooms have their own distinct names. There's the "Fountain", the "Lounge" and the "Restaurant" with the kitchen next to it. A single drone sweep will tell you what the rooms are called.
---
F
---
Rails are my enemy.
---
Soooo still not fixed what gives?
---
You kinda can - that’s why I was asking about the auto click - you can just leave it clicking on the co-ordinates of the VOTE FOR RETRY button and every time you die it automatically starts another round after auto selecting the sight/operator to defend the hostage - if you survive 30 seconds you make 20-30+ renown - roughly if you leave it for 9 hours you can make 10000 renown 
---
And casual is a way of practicing with your mirror placements
---
Recruit OH PEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
What?
---
I mean I understand how some are upset they they may not be able to use the renown to get the Christmas skin if it isn't fixed in time. But, hey you are getting a free gift maybe be a little more appreciative of that? 
---
He does
---
I forgot, communication online isn't real.
---
Lol .01! Does he always freak out this bad?
---
why does this sound like something I would do
---
What does RNG mean? 
---
I'm saying that at operator selection menu you'll be designated by CPU unless you choose yourself to be the 6th operator...
---
Try 400 you can ever trust the o2 around you
---
How the fuck have you gotten to that screen, mine just says error 
---
I legitimately left the room IRL to do something and came back with the secure area objective light blinking with my team losing their minds only for me to turn and dome an Ash who didn’t realize that the only hologram on OBJ was me all along 
---
you are allowed that opinion but no
---
Yeah, I know that. I work on mods for Cities: Skylines, I totally understand when someone wants a feature that sounds simple but requires a lot of tedious fuckery to make it work. It just bothers me when they say it isn't possible, as opposed to "It's actually really complicated underneath the hood, and we don't have the resources at the moment to get it functional."
---
Kafe isn’t a great map, in fact it’s objectively awful by almost every standard, but other than that I agree. OG hereford was poorly designed, and people’s defense of it is outright garbage.
---
I'm going to catch flak for this but I'm impressed not only for the free operator but giving us 25k renown in lieu of having them all. Granted its all messy but their intentions were generous and good to say the least, points for trying! Of course people are outraged they aren't getting their 25k right away, but there is a universe where Ubi gives us nothing...
---
Operation Health Part 2!
---
Yeah this is the first time I've been able to get to this screen before I couldn't even click into it but it just keeps saying that and when I click complete nothing happens but I still have the pack.
---
If you do offline t hunt you spent connected to the server so you dont get renown 
---
Illusion -1
---
Quit creepin 
---
I have his elite and honestly since it is first person it never bugs me. Lol. 
---
And decrease the recoil 
---
I spent all my 22k renown because I thought ubisoft had my back and I'd be able to buy the gingerbread skin with the 25k + some "Change"
---
F!
---
I’ve only been playing siege for a couple of weeks now, I have this impulse as well and whenever I hear someone making noise in a room near me I mentally call it out 
---
no u
---
imagine adding content to your game without making it more buggy everytime
---
this post was made by not ubisoft gang
---
Ubisoft swaps grenades between few operators every few months. Capitao had grenades but they were changed to something else or given to someone else. Iq lost her grenades for Finka (her pickrate was ridiculously low, so they gave her grenades for higher pickrate). In 2019 I'm betting Finka will lose her grenades or someone else will get grenades.
---
about the black-ice replica was really maded for me by my friend  @tatlos  :)
---
Do many trolls in this comment section smh. 
---
All you have to do is delete system 32 because that has the firewall blocking it from being activated after you deleted it restart your computer. 
---
Lesion is pretty good, his gadget is intel and trap and his guns are good too
---
Tachanka... dont waste your time with anyone else
---
*snap*
---
i didn't saw it was posted here before i had no idea who was the owner, sorry for the mistake.
---
As a noob that started in August. Tower is my most hated and hard to understand map. I've gotten a better visual of it in my mind, but still, I have a hard time picturing what on the upper floor is relative to the lower one, and get rooms mixed up between them. 
---
I only ever played like one game on the old Hereford, so I really only ever know the new one. I really like it having the two sets of staircases though on near opposite sides. 
---
Jokes on them I had like 90k renoun so I bought it 
---
Oh geeze, I didn't pay attention to that. I was just looking at the kill feed.
---
In that case, I'm going to say ping. That .018s difference for the server to register kills? 
---
Pretty sure you just wooshed yourself son, he was continuing your joke by going down the chain. Oddly you revealed the most beta qualities by folding first and getting salty lol
---
i didn't knew from who it was sorry for the mistake bud :) have a great day
---
Liar. You said your friend made this for you and gave you permission to watermark it and post it. Mark my word, I will expose you on every single post you make.
---
Hahah there you go! All you need is a few more lineups like that and you will be up there in no time
---
Thank you very much
---
to warm up for ranked, obviously /s
---
That’s an oooold card my friend, and not much for VRAM at all
---
Thanks! I’m hoping to reach silver before next season.
---
No. It wasnt made for you.
---
He made it for himself. And gave you a pic.
---
They said they were investigating it in that old tweet though, this is just an update on the situation.
---
I can't even fathom how you fuck up something so basic in such a spectacular way. 
---
This is a roamer dream
---
Knifing a person is no different from meleeing the wall. The animations are interchangeable and are only dependent on how far you are from the wall. The mechanic is the same. You can melee through bullet holes, or blitz's shoulder.
---
I believe in you! Try to play with some friends, like if you find some people that you like try to play some more games with them! My rank increased dramatically back when I first started playing with a team vs on my own
---
Good luck :)
---
Game balance takes precedent over realism.
---
I've learned to keep quiet when spectating because the sound is way different.
---
I tried this once and it works.... Got flashed, but blitz trapped on the mat
---
allright bud.
---
It wasn't typed for nothing thank you
---
I provided proof. Stop being a thief.
---
Yeah it’s one of things I’ve found out about from trying to vote kick my friends constantly haha
---
They could be using an elite or scuf controller it makes movements seem ridiculously fast including crouch spamming and leaning. I really don’t think there are as many mnk users as people let on.
---
I accidentally knifed someone through a bullethole once when their sudden movement startled me and caused me to click the stick.
---
All my friends play fortnite, it’s annoying. I can play with my older brother’s friends though, he’s 15. 
---
Had that shit the other night on Chalet. On D objective in dining room. Twitch got up onto the kitchen window looking towards trophy. Had Kaid's shotgun 3 shots right on the side of the head not one registered.
---
Operator Icon's were not meant for the global build. Nor were cosmetics. They said this outright in the second post. 
---
But my point is, they weren't "THAT greedy" as the previous person says it was.
---
No you need jackal
---
Better kill than a lot of pc playera lol
---
I don't know if he would have lived had ash not pegged blitz with that ash charge.
---
I don't even know if he would have survived the blast from the ash charge if the blitz didn't intercept it.
---
No
---
nah he was also walling, but i guess i didn't include that. but it was a definite cheater. not just speculation  
---
Where did he get that?
---
Thank you
---
I don’t think it was on purpose. Ranked in general is bugged to hell this season, and they said that the fact that you can’t see your rank at the end of a game (like how it treats it like you just got ranked) was unintentional so I would imagine the rest of it was unintentional as well
---
But who knows, it is Ubisoft after all lol
---
Video games are much larger then they used to be, so games like black ops 4 or even Rb6 in its current state would take many disks to hold the info. It's costs more to produce and to distribute with very little upside besides being able to resell games which you usually only get a fraction of the money back. 
---
No cause that’s toxic, yes cause you have the 2 coolest skins for the R4-C
---
you provided proof about the DEV skin my friend, not about the black-ice skin that was maded for me. But is all good internet is internet, i wish you good luck and have a great week :D
---
That's what you get when you spawn peek using cav 
---
Ah, ok well right now the French bois are in a good place especially Rook, I would recommend him and probably Maverick on Attack, simply because his guns are good and his gadget is great.
---
dishwasher 
---
Yeah, but the issue hasnt changed. Still the exact same problem as before they blocked us from converting them.
---
If you want to, ash can be a pretty easy character to play as, but the higher rank and level you are more people will be playing her
---
Eh, it’s only a snapped femur.
---
Wow really? Stop being such a goy for once in your life, the skins are way over priced anyways
---
F I love how all of reddit knew what the second word meant 😂
---
But I mean when you find your team played well (even if you don’t know them in real life), ask them if they want to stay as team etc and make some online friends to game with. All my buddies that I play siege with were all met online
---
Also if you are on PC you could consider joining the R6 reddit discord server, where you can almost always find some people to play with as there are like 200k+ users on it
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That is ubi saying fuck you
---
Lol ya she just yells "Gonyo!" (Or however you spell it)
---
Sorry;(
---
It changed the magazine to a slightly different shade of annoying
---
Every attackers death except maybe Dokkaebi's was absolutely ridiculous. 
---
1) Blitz gets pegged by ashes charge, not only killing him but also blocking it and throwing it somewhere out of blitz's kill radius.
---
2) Blackbeard gets knocked the fuck out through the metal bars. *Blackbeard*.
---
3) Glaz gets shutdown with an absolutly bullshit quickscope from the 3 bullets left in your magazine
---
4+5) the only somewhat normal kills, except that they lined up for a singly burst to mow them both down.
---
everyone has pro league aim when it comes to team kills
---
I am level 130 and have 2 Black ice Skins. One for iq's lmg and another one for The 552 commando. I almost never use IQ and If I do i use The AUG.
---
LMAO
---
Gotta throw the whole friend out.
---
Yeah I know what you mean, that's why I tried to not say anything that directly disputes what you think. :)
---
There's a saying in Swedish "many small creeks make a big river". That's just what I want to get through. Things add up and saying no early is probably good for the community in the long run.
---
I'm for sure not going to complain about free stuff from ubi either way!
---
It's all personal preference, also depends on what kinda peripherals you have, like I always put melee on the back button on the side of my mouse, I also put crouch on ctrl, because old school placement 
---
Yokai ceiling fan
---
Play some terrorist hunt focusing on your aim points when ADSing, and treat ranked like casual, lots of people get super stressed, I just play for fun. 
---
Current; Copper 3 
---
White noise plat 
---
Velvet Shell plat
---
Op health gold
---
At level 196 I just play for fun now, gets kinda repetitive. 
---
Yeah
---
Alright
---
[removed]
---
Only if she touches them in time, leads to a weird game of tag.
---
I thought the deadline was the 3rd? 
---
If you TK the same guy twice in the same game you get kicked. Unfortunately throwing is a thing and there isn’t much to do about it without getting banned yourself. Just get some video footage of it and send it to Ubi and hope they do something about it
---
Go get an Ashe trashcan so you can cement the fact that anything you shoot towards her, will miss
---
It's only 15+ in Australia and they don't even care
---
They both have pros and cons but hibana is usually better than thermite
---
Where do you live?
---
Thermite
---
Pic w discussion, found the 4chad
---
Honestly her gadget makes her more support than fragger so maybe its justified. 
---
Hello darkness my old friend 
---
Noted, thank you
---
Only headgears from Op. Black Ice, Dust Line, Skull Rain, Red Crow, &amp; Velvet Shell are available in Alpha Packs.
---
I haven’t played in about a week but anytime that happens to me I just close Uplay completely along with siege and relaunch and it usually fixes it for me. But it happens at random and I’m seeing more and more of it every day (on here) and that solution hasn’t worked for everybody but it usually works for my friends and I when we get it
---
My god when people take 30 years to finish off the last person if they’re downed or whatever it’s frustrating. Just kill them and move on. You’re not cool. 
---
if you play the game regularly you should have hundreds of thousands of renown
---
That shit was fucking awesome
---
It would have to be microscopic to accurately depict her hitbox
---
Yes sir bretherin
---
The only move is not to play. 
---
Wewowewo wuzzy raiding 
---
The way to fix it straight away is to buy the game again on another account, that fixes it right away. No joke same thing happend to me and my friend, play on the same computer with the same mic but a different account and it works fine. Play the account that's bugged on another computer it still doesn't work. Ubisoft is a joke. 
---
The outrage of not getting it immediately is incredible. Let them have a Christmas break!
---
It's pretty annoying, people complain about the grind for operators, and Ubi actually does something nice, and people still complain, honestly there would probably be complaining less if they didn't do a Christmas event at all. 
---
No I am going to buy one and post it on here to piss all you off.
---
BTW.... Love the mat 
---
Hello Hyper2Snyper, your submission has been removed as it appears to be a question about the Holiday Pack issue.

The problem hasn't been resolved yet, the last status update was provided by [@UbisoftSupport](https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport) on Twitter:
---
&gt; We're aware of and working on resolving an issue with the Holiday Pack conversion system, preventing players that own all DLC Operators from redeeming their 25,000 Renown. We'll share any updates as soon as they're available. [^Source](https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1079792550855303172)

Its like from that one Russian Badger video. We're glaz walked into like 6 mines.people that remember this link the vid for the uncultured.
---
No need to be an asshole. 
---
Perhaps, but when i go on a hiatus, I wish the customization options that all appeared previously were still available when I come back, especially if those options are decent looking, like the uniforms from Operation Chimera. Besides, Ubisoft would love to have the extra money, it seems irrational to me that they would pass on that. 
---
I reset multiple times and it still happens
---
I even contacted support
---
Look in steam and it’s under the horror game tag too.  I personally think playing when there’s a cav on defense is when this game earns the horror title.
---
Ubi is a joke right now
---
I know it can be frustrating getting TK'd every other match but I really don't think people are that outright toxic - Maybe you messed with someone's mira setup or reinforced a rotation wall or something in those lines of "unwritten rules". But I could be wrong too and getting matched with same people for 3 or 4 matches is kinda surprising too - odd time to be playing or something similar. Hope you analyse what went wrong or could be just set of bad events which chances of happening again is very very slim.
---
All I can picture is Spongebob saying IM READY, then this 😂
---
They should just implement a feature where if you leave while dbno it instantly causes an interrogation. And you know what I'll go one higher too, if the defenders dont even *have* a cav it should still happen and fuck it while were at it if a defender leaves in this situation too. It just disrupts gameplay, match flow, and is a way people will cheat a higher k/d.
---
i wanted a cookie too

Welp time to go clean up

Is it possible to 3d print them?
---
Tru dat
---
We all do it more than we’d like to admit. 
---
I'll try again tomorrow, being suspended after trying to get rid of the guys who kept popping me with a pistol at the start of every round got me suspended.  Thanks for the comment, though.  I don't really know what I'm doing so a higher level friend was basically playing w/ me and telling me what to do.

I hope that username was made just for this.

I am a rook main have black ice mp5 i also have 9by19 mp5k r4c g8 and 9mmc1 black Ice

I hated the library. So much....

1500+ hours in and I already know all the cams at most places I go to.
---
Excuse me for not playing the game for 6 months. I was playing other games. Other games are fun. I can't let myself get burned out on Siege, but sometimes I come back. I would appreciate being welcomed back, rather than kicked in the nuts for leaving. But either way, I'm offering money for this. I'm wanting to support and play the game. It isn't normal to play the same game 24/7, though. I'm not asking that they make all limited time offers available 24/7, just seasonal cosmetics. They used to do that, anyway. They only changed it last year, I think. 
---
Nice shot
---
Or in T-Hunt
---
8 days later and still can't open.
---
That counter works on Monty too!! 
---
this is why you should never spray
---
I like how you're not giving up. First thing to have when you want to get back grinding or learning again and it's nice to hear that you have an experienced player to guide you and teach stuff. Hope you do good the next time :) 
---
Thai isn’t an app, it’s a website too. Not everyone is a teenager on here.

Ok but I've try to open the pack but rainbow says I've 0 pack, please fix ubi 😭🙏

Like how you can't see that guy to your right in the corner as you enter a room?

Please, tell me more about these "benefits" of a smaller FoV...

Hello real_AwesomeMonster, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/ac11iw/this_is_a_bug_that_ubisoft_needs_to_fix_players/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
&gt; but only a slim portion if the game truly involves taking out terrorists. Everything else focuses on the elite operators that are brought together
---
A small portion of the game is terrorist killing, the majority of it is simulations or "test runs" where the operators are training against one another (pvp). Thats the actual lore of the game for anyone not in the know.
---
Thermite was as surprised as you were
---
Doesn't work for this bug, when you can see the mic working it's a bug with the account. 
---
Making it limited nets them a lot more money than if it was available forever. Being seasonal gives incentive to purchase it because it will be discontinued giving it a certain rarity. 
---
i liked it
---
Jesus Christ trick shotting better not start being a thing in this game, I can already barley aim for shit.

Actually, I’m pretty sure Thai is a nationality or type of ethnic food from Thailand 
---
Thank you!

Oww
---
Alt + F4
---
Why don’t he got legs
---
lmao he got no legs
---
#shrimp#
---
360 ooga booga?
---
Get a roommate to replace it one day with a homemade real welcome mat. Epic prank
---
Me:wait tactically so I have the advantage when he peeks 
---
Basically every player:
---
I can think of 3 or 4 spots right now that dont have angles, even 5 I think
---
Almost a year ago, alot of players don't know it exists. Multiple free weekends since its depature brought alot of new players who missed the classic siege.
---
Arent you the one questioning things to begin with? Lol the man just helped answer your question
---
Was making a joke about chankas weight.
---
Yeah it seems it has gotten a lot worse and more frequent in the past few days. Hopefully they fix it soon as that is super annoying lol
---
They are fixing it, you will get 25,000 renown 
---
I hadn't even notice this glitch
---
Haha oops 
---
1 or 2 rooms are fully covered in barb. Also rooms with nitro cells.
---
I feel like if I was tired I would see that and jump back
---
PrefireS for dayss
---
Cant even fix the alpha pack correctly :/ 
---
they've been saying this since it was released, what do you mean finally? 
---
It says "Tachanka Op(eration) Health Plumber Co", not "Tachanka OP". If I remember correct the Operation Health logo can even be seen somewhere on the van.
---
Alt+F4 then Enter
---
He ain't got no legs 
---
it's gonna be scary when I shower in the morning
---
I know it’s kinda out there... but... He has a story of losing his legs while deployed, using prosthetics he is able to walk past lesion mines and rescue himself out of bear traps. There are plenty of on duty soldiers with prosthetics. Seems possible?
---
Before it told me it wasn't available and now it shows up like I can convert it.
---
Clicking on it brings up this message and nothing happens I still have the pack.
---
It confuses me as to why they suddenly let me open/convert it if it still doesn't work
---
Now she has too little utility. I can't even support teammates on hard breach anymore. Being able to see Pulse/Vigil/Phones just doesn't cut it these days.
---
Oh No 😑
---
Cool! My PSN is BlueArchean and I usually play from around 3:00 to five pm Eastern time. If anyone wants to play I’m available tomorrow during that time period. 
---
I thought everyone already knew about this?
---
This is why I always silence his pistol, since this can also work through barricades, and make taking a site easy, especially if you have a good Glaz to pair with.
---
And what about Kaid's shotgun on console? It's been far too long and they haven't fixed it
---
They did keep it recognizable, central stairway, same room layout on some floors, etc.
---
I'll pass, I've learned from my 2 days of playing that Bandit mains are a bit *sweaty*. lol thank you though
---
Welcome to this thing called "Siege Syndrome"
---
And it can hit you with a blast of cold air once every twenty seconds.
---
Immune to barb wire and floor based traps i.e. bear traps, lesion mines, and low kapkan traps. Sprint and rappel is muffled to low sound. His rappel is silent and he has an automatic zip line to ascend and move faster while on rappel.  Yes he has no legs. 
---
Bandit 
---
Why would a gaming company ever care about smurfs it lets them freely inflate their user counts.
---
Do i have to... spell it out for you???
---
I dont understand cavs that spawnpeek
---
Bandit or smoke 
---
Same thing right?
---
The reason people use a 4:3 ratio is the fact that a smaller FOV allows you to see your enemies head's wider, which can help when peaking. Or because they like it. 
---
The video above makes the point that lowering your FOV does the same thing. However, FOV in siege is vertical and lowering it limits your view above and below you. Playing 4:3 90fov, lets you play with a better view of the enemy and with a larger vertical fov.
---
Yikes. 
---
Lol
---
A noticeable difference is that Villa has fully reasonable hallways connecting rooms, while Hereford feels like they packed rooms into a floor then added hallways after.
---
I guess it sort of makes sense if they wanted to retain the "training grounds" setting from the source material. But it still feels unnecessarily complicated.

I hope you go to jail, you must be a rich white straight male! Nothing good comes from you lot

I stopped taking it because I finished school so it wasn't required anymore. But now I think I need it to play normally
---
You dropped your /s. 
---
What /s
---
My school is littered with cameras that look EXACTLY like Siege cameras and it definitely freaks me out and I think about it all the time.
---
Dont take a medicine just because ur doing bad at a video game. 
---
Just gonna leave a comment and use this as my desktop wallpaper, if you don't mind obviously
---
Last two are wrong, and sorry I didn't put you in it, also there's a Tachanka easter-egg in it somewhere

/s     
---
I fully mean it!
---
Well just look at our penalty/banning measures in this game and compare it to others :
---
1. No leavers penalty in casual .
---
2. Toxic behaviour report that GOD KNOWS did it do the job or not .
---
3. No compensation to unfair matches , such as unbalanced number of players .
---
4. Team killing percentage was not taken into measure at all . 
---
5. No penalty for doing lots of friendly fire .
---
6. Less efficiency on banning trolls , TKers , Cheaters , Boosters . etc . 
---
However , you might also need to look at the game mechanics that allows players to troll / grief . 
---
1. 5v5 , relatively short match , short rounds . 
---
2. Friendly fire . 
---
3. Communication is key to win in Siege
---
4. Almost anything is lethal .
---
5. Buggy map , exploits can be easily made. 
---
It is not fun to play with these assholes , but as long as there is a way for them to do so , they will do it .
---
Planned parenthood is just a shitty map full of spawn peeks 
---
Dokkaebi and Tachanka?
---
it sometimes depends, usually if it’s near the beginning of a round or multiple in the same round it’s the third  that will get you kicked. But if the tks are far enough apart they may not get kicked
---
Never mind him, checked comment history it’s just a 12 year old “memer”
---
Fuck I just remembered ubi is cheating me out of this map.
---
Give back

---
so newish player here... is he actually reacting that fast or was just lucky with a timed shot?
---
Ahahaha, how about no
---
&gt; Yeah but only fanboys would know that
---
The only reason I've logged into the game since late 2017 was to get my free operator. I'd say I'm certainly not a fanboy and yet I know that shit.
---
Why change the truth?
---
But he did it for some cool dude.
---
He's not wrong, you know..

hope they dont ruin kanal too

Speak the truth.

Idk how. Lol

No no I as taking it to help my ADD which effects how I concentrate, I stopped taking it and now my game play has worsened

Doesn’t matter. Store makes rule. You break rule. You experience consequences.

Snake with pocket of air for a tail, and it's mad? It's a rattlin'
---
Thank you for explaining!
---
I had that same thought a couple of days ago. 
---
Was queuing with a full squad and we had 4 games back to back where we just 4-0 stomped the enemy teams (got me to Plat III), the enemy doing super dumb shit that I have not seen in high Gold / low Plat in like forever. 
---
The conspiracy theorist in me is 100% sure this is it!
---
Use your grenade amigo
---
Whilst on attack? It's normal.
---
They posted on the r6 Twitter that they are working on it. I don't think they is a date yet.
---
I use movavi video editor. It’s on steam and it might be on sale rn.
---
Or in the Milky Way 
---
I mean it wasn't working when it launched over a week ago, so they disabled the button. Fair, I guess. 
---
But they re-enabled the button without even making sure it'd work?

i’m guessing his team he seems kinda salty
---
Thank you!

You must be really fun to talk to at parties 
---
Dude if the kid wanted to buy the game but was too young, he could buy it on Steam.
---
Way smarter, though it doesn’t get the kid a free game.
---
Classic siege didn’t have this map
---
Do it. Nothing more fun, than messing around =]
---
It's commonly known recruit can do that why else would we have recruit mains?
---
Lol, no. Tower is OK as an attacker, pretty good for defenders good luck getting into BU, Favela is awful for defenders but survivable. Bartlett is a nightmare for attackers.
---
Well the fact it doesn't show attachments and has a face cover which alibi can't have. I'm to assume its intentional to keep her from being too strong.

I've just stopped playing shields.

Nah I think ash got some strong stuff off bandit

Sadly one of the guys in our squad is a blitz main.

It's because you typed in alphabets. That's one way of typing Japanese. You write in alphabets first, then convert it to Hiragana, Katakana, or Kanji. If you want "Detect Language" to detect it as Korean, you should write it using Korean which is 도깨비.

Wtf, how did I end up buying rainbow six Vegas when I was 13, did no one gave a fuck back then?

I completely agree with you.

That sounds good!

Cuz that's what you need at the end of a long day.

Stepping out of a nice relaxing shower with a smile on your face only to snap you femur and start crying on the floor
---
I don't see an issue here honestly. The kid was only a year younger than the recommended age rating. And R6 Siege doesn't have nude people or chopped off limbs. Just guns, violence, and blood (cursing too, but that's not that bad). There are younger, more immature kids that are playing way more inappropriate games. 
---
All in all, good for that guy buying that game for the kid. Nice thing to do.
---
I just imagine some excessively french man saying it
---
Someone already posted something similar to this, but this really shows our devotion.

Hello TokaTrvsh! **It looks like you are unsure whether or not you want to buy Siege or which edition to buy.**
---
Check out [our Buyer's Guide wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/wiki/buyers_guide "Click here to be redirected to the Buyer's Guide") for all information about the game for potential buyers and for all information about the different game editions. Thanks!

So they took one problematic map and turned it into a different problematic map. Progress?

Favela is so garbage.

Barlette was my favorite map

Droning is a heavy tactic. And picking someone your team needs is almost a must. But make sure what game mode it is, on border if it's secure than go Thermite since he can breach walls from the outside. If it's not secure and is instead bomb then perhaps a sledge or buck. There are alot of maps so pay attention to layout and where you can be shot from
---
R6 Siege is one of the best fps games ive ever played, it is very unique and I highly recommend buying it.
---
hey so i don’t wanna sound dumb but what even is the conversion thing?
---
Kind of like The Game?
---
.... *shit*
---
I can tell you for a fact that's wrong. For each of Monty and Sledge, I have Skull Rain, Velvet Shell and Red Crow head gears all from alpha packs. And I bought the game after those seasons were over.
---
Yeah can we not use BM as an acronym for anything?  It will always stand for bowel movement for me.
---
I would recommend the game, but if you’re thinking it’s like something such as bf4 or cod, then just know it’s not
---
I don't think anyone is buying what you're selling but feel free to waste your useless opinion. You're just another sweaty who tries justifying trash aspects of the game simply because you benefit from them. Heaven forbid defenders in a game have to stay and defend their objective within the buildings confines with their defensive based abilities while being on the defending team.
---
Doing so is probably against the ToC's of his job and he violated those terms. He should have known better not to do so. It's nice what he did for that kid and all, but it's his fault that he got fired.

If I wasn’t too clear you can watch [thissssssss](https://youtu.be/HYWRCTKG2WA) (added s for mobile) video, but take caution as they call it a “glitch” and think that they’re the first to discover the spot so you might cringe.

The issue is then you have an instant breach charge. Suddenly, anyone who has it is now mini-Zof/mini-Ash.

The best alternative would be to give IQ a psuedo-frag. Have it behave like a regular frag, but only deal 25/50 damage.

Yeah I understand that it's completely different. I actually played it at a friend's house. My only concern is that it might be a little late to buy this game since it's been out for a while. 
---
I think it’s a great gun, just feel like she has little utility with her gadgets.
---
Funny meme!!!!!!
---
I saw a post of this a day or two ago about a boyfriend buying her girl one, was diff though, did you get inspiration or just chance?
---
She had it outside her shower too
---
I would have just told the kid to buy a steam or whatever they use currency card and buy it that way. Could have saved you and still get a sale. 
---
Either way you break your legs, but with this you will break them in style.
---
What happened 
---
I'd be happy if they just gave her her shield back.
---
It’s a feature, not a bug
---
If you're moving from cod then remember this game is a bit toxic and friendly fire exists. But I'd recommend it. It gets content very frequently and is a very enjoying game, especially with friends
---
I bought it off Amazon
---
Just curious what are your dimensions on the shield, because I have tried twice and failed twice to get the right height.
---
/r/wooosh
---
That’s not bad for bomb imo. I love when friendly Valks have a cam watching each bomb site so if I’m in a clutch scenario I don’t have to worry about the other team planting without my knowledge

Huh

This is straight out of an anime fight lmao

Unique doesn't always mean good. It's unique to eat your own shit.
---
Just because I'm 180 degrees away from looking at it doesn't mean it wouldnt potentially matter if they die and the enemy rushes through.
---
Looks like you don’t know what that means....
---
Thank you so much.
---
I had never melee a drone in my games, I just straight up shoot them or ignore at all.
---
I don't even remember making peek holes for attack/defend.
---
I'm on a break from this game because I want to forget old key binds in my head.

Thanks, I'll try out.

Yes, I’m Australian and I have met Americans online who I am friends with and we never have any trouble playing. Hope this helps :)

You clearly don’t understand lion in the higher ranks.
---
A low gold and below lion will use his ability in the off chance he scans someone and usually can’t do anything about the people he scans.
---
A good lion waits to use his ability until they already know where someone is. Then uses his ability so he or a team mate can rush that person as they are frozen.  Combined with a jackel is straight cancer.
---
“Red light green light” is so far from how lion actually works.

Try to run ops with C4 if you know they run a Montagne. Playing Lesion, Bandit with barbed wire or Smoke will help you. If you are in the situation where none apply, Bait him out. Try to get the best cover possible, and defuse. When he drops flick to his head.

I played Fortress like 5 times and I already feel  like I know 90% of the map. I've played Herford like 30 and get lost on every floor
---
Remember the skin isn't available for operators than got released after Chimera 
---
It's not because of control, if you compare shooting  without doing anything, you still have half the recoil on PC. And you can see in the recoil patterns that we have double recoil on console, but since they gave the pistol double recoil on console while barely even touching it on PC, I doubt they will be doing anything.
---
Lmfao for real though
---
Sorry for your loss

somebody give that man Platinum already !

I can only assume that you mean that he was just pointing it out, which, in that case, yes, I was aware that he was only pointing it out. I'm adding my two cents as well.
---
Do people stop leaving the game at some skill level or is that a problem at all levels?
---
Who is this?
---
I understand but it would be way better than outbreak and thats not a very hard game mode to add just would be really cool to see the old school Rainbow back in action with the new gameplay and graphics, know what I mean
---
You can get yourself fired for both. Doesn't matter if it's legal or not.

As a terrorist hunt player myself, ubi don't give a fuck about terrorist hunt and it's pathetic, they should give them drones, Allow us to protect the bombs on terrorist hunt and we should be able to remove suicide bombers or add more for a challenge.

Ehh. I buy every pro skin release. My last one was £10.70 for 4 skins for operator and main weapons. That's what, £3.75 a skin? I'm cool with that. League of Legends squeezes me more than that for new skins.

Damn. Yea I used to run a nice gaming community but after about a year people started separating and no new members were joining. Now the last people are the 4 of us that started it all and some fandoms from the community that come around every now and then since we still use the discord. It’s quite upsetting. I still play siege a lot though with the ones that are around. 
---
Muh cultural appropriation!
---
Too true
---
Cheers but how do I readjust the stagger position?
---
At least jager helps the team pretty significantly, at least more than me being a filthy Doc main.
---
sjat do you mean with tryhard enemy team. isnt that the purpose of the game, to try hard to finish the road to diamond?
---
Practice in terrorist hunt b4 pvp
---
It's below ideal.
---
You could give him ur account info or wait for a free weekend and then do the benchmark that they have in siege. Or he could straight up buy it on steam, test it, if it doesn’t work he can refund it as long as he hasn’t played 2 hours or waited 2 weeks. Honestly he could even buy starter edition if he’s gonna refund 
---
Well played good sir, 
---
I mean it helped you so why complaning?
---
Google translate auto detects probably what is most searched. Ebi is an extremely common and popular dish, which as someone already stated, means shrimp. There's nothing significant about this, which is why you were downvoted in the first post.

No, you get the 6th player 1st, gives the player the option to return to menu if he or she doesn't want the task of OVERWATCH

STOP

Actually. Maverick and twitch for me. No other op has this problem

He’s been making his way into the meta lately
---
Is this Heaven?
---
Please you just bough the games two months ago, research a bit more.
---
It can be, that's why it rotates... maybe extra renowns for having the patience and or being a team player
---
Nope I have a of making these type of videos but r6 is a first time
---
Thanks currently getting carried by my gold 4 roommate the last couple games 😂😂😂
---
I'll just be over here pressing f on the world's smallest keyboard
---
Basically just adjust your mouse. So when she lifts her shield up while staggered, you want to make sure the shield is blocking the incoming fire, so usually you would swing your mouse hard right.
---
Nope, I have a habit of making these type of videos but r6 is a first time :) 
---
I love how no pitfall is attributed to the player's own flaws.
---
They team lost
---
are you able to play good at 30fps?

RIP KingBeetus. Didn’t know you but I bet you were a swell man. May you play siege eternally in the afterlife and may the siege gods watch over you for lifetimes to come

No shit he could’ve bought it on steam I simply brought up buying a digital code because that’s what I do when I go to pick up games on console.

I just got kicked because the Ultra HD texture pack takes a few seconds longer to load than the normal one(runnin i7-8700k and 2080 but that doesnt make my HDD go faster), this was BEFORE first round.

I heard that the community were good but this is horrible, and no way to report these people. Note that the extra loading time is 10-15 sec.

The only black ice i have is for 417, a dmr that i barely use

Since it's a Kanal rework with Year 4: Season 2 it might be 2 pre existing countries again which I hope not, But I wanna see another Canadian operator and German operator.

It's okay. I still need the r4c, and the p12 as well as the coveted mp-7 to complete my collection. So close. 
---
toxicity, a lot of people expect way more from you than they do from themselves and direct the loathe on you because it's easier than questionning themselves and their teammate abilities and overall friendliness.

The problem is people are here to win, or be carried, and not to have fun and make friends.

how

Thats the thing I found hillarious about it. IQ's weapons are average at best. Her 552 is just Thermites 556 with higher recoil, her AUG is basically Jager's 416 but with less fire rate and without the benefit of a foregrip, and her G8 is just a worse R4C, with less damage, lower fire rate and an ADS time that should be measured in years compared to the R4. Saying that IQ has too much utility cause of her "high powered rifles" is like saying Chanka has way too much fragging potential because he has barbed wire, a semi auto mag fed shotgun and a gadget that can 2 shot any operator. On paper he might sound like he is powerful, but when you actually look at it we all know thats not true, and the same goes for IQ back when she had frags.

KAPKQN WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
---
Ubisoft doesnt really consider much because evey map has the same layout.
---
3floors 2 stair cases and add bunch of hatches everywhere.  
---
That doesn't take much thinking.
---
Not sure I'd bother though, the server ping is never correct, for me anyway.
---
ddos would result in a complete shutdown of the router it is more likely the person was packet over loading which is like ddos but doesn't crash you or just a good ol fashion lag switch 
---
Most likely, or maybe some other kind of service attack
---
I encountered this once, didn't end well

You didn't pay for a working product, you paid for siege

How is r6s maps complex

That doesn't seem that complex too me.

Blaze it bro
---
I thought it was. Your arguing both her weapons are bad. They are not. The MX4 is good. Elas Scorpion is ok, and that could be buffed some what with the recoil nerfs I agree. 
---
The MPX is worse than the MX4, and the AUG is worse than the MPX. 
---
The shotgun, much like Vigils is more for messing about with. It can decimate walls easily, which when watching the reveal trailers is what it was designed for. Having it shoot faster with more damage would make it way too strong. 
---
Lol. Yeah buy a car and when it doesnt work just walk.
---
man i sorta miss bartlett

i'm sure he's hacking because in the first round, he teleported form spawn right near OBJ and killed me.

Anyone can activate 2fa on an account they actually own, one that they control the email address to, so yeah, it's possible that there are a few that buy the game when it's on sale to hack on it, but for all the hackers that buy the really cheap hacked accounts, they won't be able to use those in ranked.
---
Awesome I’ll add you. I was plat/diamond on Xbox but I’m gold on pc so far. Using a keyboard is frustrating me to no end so far lol.
---
I'd give it a 0.8/5 -IGN
---
Who's Bartlett if you don't mind me asking?
---
Idk were you got the impression glaz has no counters but you're wrong. He has no hard counters however maestro is considered a soft counter along with bullet proof cameras and pulse is also considered a soft counter because he can technically see through the smoke 
---
The first airjab that was triggered in the hallway pushed the defender into break room, where a second airjab triggered pushing the defender out of the room, falling onto a claymore set up below.

---
Amen to that
---
It's way better than favela, tho.
---
It’s one of the legendary MP5 skins, you can see that it’s available for Doc and Rook so it has to be that
---
Sounds good! The first week was incredibly frustrating but I do feel with a little more time that I will be much better with M&amp;KB. My buddy and I have played nothing but casual and we are consistently getting qued with full plat teams or high golds so I’m assuming we will be right in there. 
---
I love when people are a good sport about it
---
This is the last round,already sent them copies aswell.
---
Maybe, but I do agree with you about the first clip, however on the third I had shown the actual trick with the claymore which is extra safe to do and should do the trick against the Office to the CCTV flank. 
---
I wanted to this one as well as it's kinda funny seeing enemies falling down from the Break.
---
Super similar but not quite, thank you though

Okey that's just nutty

So im not the only one that sees balks hand do that

I see that it's a match of the netherlands versus south africa. At least both teams can sort of understand each other.
---
She is far more managable now than at her launch. And it is not a I push easy win button. At that point your down to who is better positioned. They have 20 extra health for the push, not a whole lot there. Is she annoying? yes. But I wouldn't say she is BS anymore. Thankfully, we are not going to get any more global abilties.
---
I wonder if he has the pewdiepie chair
---
What is it
---
Oh I'm not really mad. I just think it's sad and pathetic that people have to act like him to be relevant. 
---
Is English your third language?
---
I see lots of shitty acog jokes coming up
---
This game would be more fun if it wasn't so easy to die
---
A paint can to the head would probably do more damage at first then the air jab 
---
i am still waiting :( where is my 25k credit
---
The distortion is only due to lag tho. If you have decent ping it’s unaffected. Also if you have bad ping your hitbox can be a couple frames off whether you’re doing this or not. It’s just more noticeable when you’re moving a lot. And again we’re talking about a couple frames of difference, I think the video said 11, which is 1/6 of a second. A hitbox being 1/6 of a second off isn’t what got you killed
---
Simply sticks me in the menu loading saying validating playlists
---
Attackers don’t play during the prep phase so that is physically impossible.
---
It's calle GEForce Experience. You can download the program here: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/
---
I mean it’s a good anti cheat but people pay hundreds to bypass it. Really it’s the people spending paycheques to get around it and to have an unfair advantage that are the jokes

Tfw some guy on reddit complains that his fps "tanked" to what is normal for you
---
Yeah me too yesterday.... Sadly we had one zofia without elite skin :(
---
It’s 9:11 rn
---
That Bandit just sitting on site while his entire team ran out and died one by one, I have been in that position too many times.  
---
I know his pain and disappointment.  
---
Sounds like a issue with the ubisoft try sending the information to their bugtracker
---
He was not a memer and killed all of us 😢
---
Yes. But they put those ages restrictions on for a reason. And if he were to grow up and be violent and cute the game or something would easily be  a case.  Because he got the game when he was too young, immature, and impressionable
---
Rebrute:
---
5 armor 5 speed
---
Ability: Claps so hard it destroys all soft walls and barricades in the map. It also airjabs everyone (even attackers)
---
That would have been a nice gift during Outbreak instead of the Ash elite
---
Hahaha should be requested a knife fight, those are always fun when the teams get unfair haha
---
So swol he can barely fit through a doorway!
---
Bandit, guy is a prankster
---
That's why I said last moment pushes.
---
Can you send me a link please, I would like to buy one
---
Tbh he is  not really used
---
Ubi you just keep fucking up.
---
So lack of time management - which is ignorance or lack of coordination by the tracking team. 
---
Probably discord memory leak

Nerf time

I now have too do that every time I go to destroy that cam
---
Cav, Zofia, Maestro 
---
So basically lag messes up the hitbox. This can be said about any movement in game. Crouch spamming itself doesnt mess up hitbox.
---
You're suggesting her weapon is closer to Bandit's MP7 when her role and niche is to take close range engagements. Every operator has a role and just because she can't take mid-long range engagements hardly means she's a non viable operator. 
---
The problem is on ps4 theres no cross team communicaiton unlike pc
---
This happened to me the other day but I was Kaid put my whole clip in a blitz’s shoulder and not one shot connected
---
but then the game wouldn't be 'realistic' not saying it is now but it's pretty easy to die in real life 
---
You can turn on aimbot toggle too
---
I assure you there are more reasons for lower pick rates than just that people don’t play them right. There’s no way high level players just “haven’t caught on to how good they are”. 
---
listen to him he is right
---
Ahhh it was PS4 yeah nevermind :p definitely a pc thing haha
---
Icons +1 ^
---
I want a triple Bikini.... Make it happen.
---
it's still out. everyone gets one and you can't buy any more, there's only one per person. if you don't have all the ops, it gives you one that you don't have for free, and if you do, you will eventually be able to convert it into 25k renown

MouseScroll=1 change to MouseScroll=0
---
shields are fucked in this game currently. they shoot through em so dont use shield ops 
---
Funny thing is... I’ve opened a few alpha packs along my journey of collecting renown... I’ve only gotten epics and a legendary... I also play the game a bunch... enough so that I can save 25k in about a week, that’s more than enough time to buy every limited seasonal skin.
---
They were having a holiday break you fucking imbecil.
---
He says being a thermite main
---
how wrong you are
---
Really? I gotta be honest I despised her older design.
---
Normally when you buy it you should have the volcano skin and a new charm. I bought it too, but I think the bonuses only start once season 4 starts. I also had a year 3 pass. 
---
These cheats in siege are getting ridiculous. 
---
Simple fix, just change your shadow settings to anything.
---
Why secure though 
---
You do realize the prep phase for defenders is the drone phase for attackers...
---
I don't get why they thought that was a good idea for a competitive game. They really need to sync up the debris. I've been killed a couple of times through windows where they had clear sight and I had boards. 
---
It's in the playlist?
---
i dont like bomb 
---
No i think its just a problem with sledge the hammer is pretty lose but if u didnt move him he doesnt lose the hammer ... 
---
Stop complaining I remember when it only took 3 votes to kick someone.
---
Skins = Wins 
---
learn how to control your self when u are angry.
---
it worked on me, most likely will work on you ;)
---
And there’s not a single Ash Elite!!! It’s a miracle
---
The only thing that isnt fine with cav is her pistol. It might be just me, but when i play cav i need to shoot an enemy a million times before they get downed. But when i play against a cav i get shoot twice and get downed like its supposed to
---
Maybe you’re just early???
---
No U
---
Did that first and got 1k upvote. Some other made and got 6k upvote. Brilliant 
---
But c'mon 7 days is more than i have owned this game
---
Stop blaming others for your actions.
---
This is on you, deal with the consequences.
---
They don't deserve a break, not while that texture exploit exists. 
---
Internet has nothing to do with framerate bud

100% for a Molokai skin

OOoooOooo

Glaz looks so awful.
---
I just wanted to play without being trolled
---
c h o n k

That didn't happen to me, what is that?!
---
It was his flex hour
---
Online store? They don't deliver here. Like many other stores. I live in Slovenia. Yea good luck finding that. Hint Central Europe.
---
its because maybe you don’t own the operator so that means you can’t get the charm and also players will hog the operator

They'll just find something else to complain about.

Dont think this was a thing
---
You didn't even hit the trap.
---
Removing teamkilling means everyone shoots at the same angle without repercussions or fuze a room while taking it or have blitz stand on a hatch and breach.
---
**thats a no from me dawg**
---
Honestly, they love the game just as much as the rest of us, idk why people get their panties in a bunch. Literally every bug people freak out over, obviously they're gonna try and fix it.
---
Support points
---
If you take away teamkilling people could just take all lmgs with grenades or cluster charge and nuke the obj while sprinting in and mowing everyone down with 0 chance of survival for any defenders in that room
---
Why question is why?
---
I think it says in either mira or tachankas
---
Still don’t get an alpha pack...
---
It’s very easy if you just throw every game
---
If it is I can’t count lol
---
He sensed your presence

I feel you, it has become a big issue. We just need the, to outright ban MnK.

Crazy concept... but you could just not team kill

Can’t help the xbox MnK now

Yea that’s why I’d like ubi to change the map a lil bit to make the spawn viable

Do it on an R34 pleeeease
---
Console users rise up against this threat 
---
The first 2 whiffed his head, he crouched once an went behind the Mira. Ninja my ass.
---
 R6 = Great Game, Shit Community. Thats just Siege lol 
---
Atleast make it where people who team team killers dont get in trouble
---
I know I just read the ubi bio. There is nothing to point at the fact that she killed her father because she had no reason too. Why would you kill someone you are investigating? Also, the father was said to have killed himself, which I’m guessing was set up by said corrupt politicians. As far as Ela and Zofia are concerned, their father killed himself, although Zofia is most likely suspicious of the incident.

I’d send an email or call Ubisoft or go to support.ubi.com

How do you know I even taught him? lol

Did you win the match?
---
Two words
---
No I don't have a problem with the random operator system picking a random operator. What exactly are you getting at here?
---
Use his drone when teammates are clearing out roamers or pushing site. He’s absolutely terrifying. Use the v308 the 417 is hot garbage and overhyped. He’s useful on all game modes but being a Lion main will 100% get people to hate you.
---
Hmm
---
I almost always get pulse on defense when I get a random operator. I hate pulse. I really feel like the system is trying to screw with me.

Just change your shading/shadows setting and apply it. Will fix the glitch

Sir this is not the correct subreddit Plz exit the premises libtard And read the OP. Please and thank you Have a wonder-filled day.
---
But they haven't added anything to stop third party MnK.
---
And that’s fine I’m not teaching anyone how to exploit it I’m teaching people how to counter it. but okay do what you want my guy I could care less
---
For a minute I thought the same XD

I figured it was just my luck but it happens every time

They can’t, only Sony or msoft can

Epic (fort nite) tried but the adapter manufacturer just patched their software after a day

Finally, after all this time, a new GIGN Bundle is what we needed. /s

Unfortunately no, they wiped the floor with us the last 2 rounds. It was all in vein :'(

“Excuse me YT and Twitch... I found a guy on Reddit that said check your DM’s. He needs to be banned immediately”
---
Yeah that’s what Fortnite did. It’s the best solution.
---
Playing ranked is swapping Favela and Tower as maps you never want to see again with Theme Park and New Hereford. I wish Ubi just let us pick our own maps or have a pro-league game mode that’s not a 10M.
---
I found it quite boring actually. Pick up any Robert Ludlum book for a much better thrill.
---
Glad it spawned this game though ;^)
---
I've reported you to the Reddit admins (not this subreddit mods) and have forwarded the issue to YouTube and Twitch. Happy new year!
---
Yeah very fair lol
---
Don't give them ideas
---
Love what they did with Montagne and Doc. Their helmets look pretty cool. (Especially Monty’s visor)
---
Twitch’s headgear is pretty much the same as a headgear released a while ago which is a bit of a disappointment.
---
You too man!

Saying that it is cheating is a ban a punishment is better, and besides you can do the same thing with a scuff or pro league controller, I even have a controller that runs macros which I use for customs and ducking with friends
---
Mavs weapons are not weak
---
I don’t remember what the percentages were, but how are you going to arbitrarily decide what a “good” percentage is? 
---
Also that only accounts for activated traps. It does not account for people who got shot while looking down at a trap and died before they hit the ground. It also does not account for a monty or a blitz not having a safe position to shoot a trap in their way, forcing them to push another direction. 
---
There are many ways a gadget in this game can be useful outside of its direct function
---
Black Stone bundle, AKA Ubisoft reselling the Blood Orchid camo uniforms that they never should have removed...
---
Maybe it’d be more reasonable if they just toned down the insane headshot multiplier for tachanka. Something like 2x on headshot. You dink him and if he’s anything but 100% he’s fucked anyway, but it comes into play every so often to rear it’s ugly helmet.
---
Limited time event, you missed it my guy
---
You can pretty much get rid of every hud display and on map display in the game so you can make the game extremely realistic (from last I saw at least, I haven’t checked since it was released and I was making my settings) 
---
lol team Getting Things Done?
---
I think I played with you yesterday? I believe we played on Theme Park 
---
Username? 
---
NOMAD FOR THE WIN
---
I was just stating that I wonder if the random OP system leans more towards operators you have picked less
---
Once I get the car I will, just need to actually play the game and not paint cars.
---
R6 NOT A SMURF3 
---
Big tachungus
---
Not really, their uniforms are a bit lighter and have an entirely different pattern. Doc and Monty also have headgears that look interesting.
---
New Helmets though...
---
The ARX-20
---
Yeah it’s a bug in the game, I was only aware it was possibly by shooting at soft walls with high fire rate weapons at the very start of the round, didn’t know it worked with punching too.
---
Sorry for your loss. F
---
We might have!

Btw any tips for a plat 3 player trying to get out of plat 3 and into plat 2?

I spent longer than I’d like to admit waiting for the gif to start... today is not a great day.

I really believe the best way to fix this is allow key board and mouse to be plugged in outright, and then put them in Pc lobbies. 
---
Those of these scum bugs who have some integrity who just want to use mouse and keyboard can. Hopefully that will help some of the problem. I mean it certainly can’t hurt it. 
---
Why does it say round 4 won if the score was already tied up 2-2 and that should have been round 5
---
These are the standard edition+ prices.
---
Without Year Pass:
---
- Y1 Ops: 15,000 Renown (Temporary Global Sale)
---
- Y2 Ops: 25,000 Renown
---
- Y3 Ops: 25,000 Renown
---
With Year Pass:
---
- Y1 Ops: 12,500 Renown (Temporary Global Sale + Pass Sale)
---
- Y2 Ops: 23,500 Renown (Pass Sale)
---
- Y3 Ops: 23,500 Renown (Pass Sale)
---
Same with RL
---
I love how whenever anybody depicts doc in a purely clinical environment they always depict him still wearing body armor but with a lab coat. 
---
I reckon we will. It appears it's going to go that way. And other similar games that are closely linked to R6 share concepts with Ubi.
---
Like Battle royale games, forknife and PUBG both have a season pass.
---
Yes i know. Sorry for not making it clear i was jusg saying thay its strange he pinged it knowing the enemy wouldnt see it 
---
oof, your comment was removed by a mod. Strengthens my case against you.
---
For team killing team killers
---
I think that would be incredibly hard for the system to go through the percentages of each operative's play time and then incrementally randomize who you like more over others. Just pick who you wanna play if you have a problem with the random pick.
---
Personally I like the random pick because the game gets stale for me if I use someone a lot. 
---
I’m back to plat 3 buttt just always be nervous when ya play check every corner. Super sweaty when you get that high 
---
This game hates me as well, got two packs in a row from the lowest possible chance, opened them up, both Black Ice for guns I don't use on operators I dont have yet.
---
Can you get these in alpha packs? or with straight renown? I really want Doc’s helmet, but just that.
---
She’s an entry fragger, and her gadget is designed to help her entry frag, she’s in basically the same boat as Twitch, Thatcher does basically everything she can do, but more effectively and without exposing himself at all, but Twitch has the Famas. Ash’s gadget without her guns and speed wouldn’t be very good, so she’s a speed demon with a death cannon to help her gadget actually be useful, not to mention that putting more emphasis on her gadget would just be “it’s a branching charge launcher... uhhh... that’s... that’s it.” Unless you want to give her a whole new gadget, which would annihilate her identity.
---
Why isn't this in the r6proleague sub Reddit bruh?
---
It's still available and we are keeping it in store a bit longer in light of the holiday pack issue.
---
Ligma balls?
---
Mpx needs a buff to 29 or 30 damage and the throwing animation doesn't need to be Peyton manning but at least a high school quarterback right now its a kid throwing a ball for the first time.
---
Some of the new spots you could reach were literally impossible to see. There really wasnt a counter to it. Not to mention that it eliminated the risk of having to run out of the building to throw certain outside cams.
---
Starter sucks. few hundred hours in this game, ended buying season passes
---
thanks.
---
when will the foreskin become unavailability 
---
XoX
---
Or you know people could just mute him if he's annoying.
---
How pathetic are you that you condone team killing because xqc screams into his mic?
---
Finally i can get a headshot!
---
There are actually Legos on siege characters ....
---
Contact support 
---
Yeah, I found it easier to hold the Pulse scanner and Monty's shield with capslock rather than with the middle mouse button back then but now you do not need to hold it to have it activated
---
Be faster?
---
Well I've heard it's more in higher ranks. I personally have never went against one (At least I think)
---
Exactly lol! 
---
even though i have the skin this is very nice of you guys. saw people complaining you guys were waiting for gingerbread to get removed before fixing the issue lol
---
Any one knows the spot in chalet right outside garage where u can drop off from ? 
---
Pro tip for next time: Hit the big bright white Xbox button on your controller and press X to record a clip, that you can easily post to reddit later ;)
---
In all honesty:
---
The gingerbread skin was all I wanted. I grinded some 10k for it last week, but now that I got it I can go back playing red dead 2 again.
---
I'll likely be downvoted to hell for this but no, its not nearly as common as this sub wants to think. Its also not just a magical "plug it in and become a god" device.

You can crosspost it if you wish so, not sure if this kind of thing actually belongs there

Thats a graphic exploit, the bird box glitch (thanks for the name Microwave Gaming). You can turn anti-aliasing off then back on to get around this.
---
Respek waman!
---
This is a moment where I didn't put enough explanation in lol. Skyscrapers set up is questionable, but my point is that Skyscraper is big and is easy to navigate. That does not necessarily mean it is a top tier map I just mean that from a casual player standpoint it feels better to play on compared to a map like tower or the new Hereford Base.
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Then make my character face forward while fucking vaulting? Also it isn't just this, there has been may posts about it, showing how shields desync.
---
wait a second...
---
Still broken for me
---
nice camo...thats it
---
This happened to me recently and it was really annoying. My friends and I reported the entire enemy team and we found a way to fix it. You have to go into your graphics settings and change it from high to low or just change it and revert it and the game will go back to normal. 
---
👍
---
Who has issue with Holiday? Everyone loves holiday ...
---
Or grow a pair because it’s a god damn video game
---
Im not miserable, I think the community needs to see how a game can bring people together and create brotherhoods. Shedding some light on a fallen soul. I mean is the sub riddled with death posts? God forbid someone ruins your reddit feed? You’re genuinely only asking because you want to stir the pot. Its okay though, I get it. You’re brain WONT go you go past without saying you’re 2 cents. 
---
Yeah Happy New Year. 
---
It’s a glitch
---
I’m basing my statement off of statements from MacieJay and other big names in the siege community.
---
The first clip of this vid is macie talking about how it’s not a thing https://youtu.be/kfy7k67mG4g
---
Also, literally every single time I have played people trying to “ping abuse” we have absolutely shit on them and they performed the worst. Likely because they are at the disadvantage. Or maybe they just suck idk
---
And if it's an accident? I bet ur the kind of person to tk someone if he accidentally shot u
---
Its last season just cleaning old photos out of my phone.
---
I admit it can become annoying after a while.
---
I see, does it have to do with players? Or is it happening randomly as in game?  
---
Thanks btw
---
I dont really have thoughts on it. I dont use it, plus I play on PC so I've never touched a controller with Siege. I believe that it wouldn't be allowed in a regulated tournament, so it's not something that is necessarily "fair" but I wouldn't say its cheating, since its very similar to using an Elite Controller for a Xbone
---
Right? I know people who explicitly told me that they use MnK but have the game sense of a rock. I feel that it’s not all about aim in R6
---
Calm down man, no need to be that radical
---
If you destroy the pc the cams Will be visible.
---
Swe winter camo and ruby 
---
Sure I will do it.. yeah well usually it doesn't belong there but ofcrc this could be used in proleague ..  
---
It’s a manually-created exploit
---
I dont wanna be that guy, but Im really surprised it took them this long to resolve something that doesnt seem to be _that_ complicated, compared to other issues.
---
That’s silly, people accidentally tag teammates while drone hunting all the time. Imagine an instant 4v5 for the entire ranked game because you shot 3hp off of castle’s toes at the beginning of the round. That would just piss people off more than it would help them
---
Considering you’re the only 2 out of 1k people who’ve said anything so....
---
You might need to check again
---
I dont think so either. That was bothering me. 
---
Hence the "grow a pair" line. People are annoying in video games. If you're not going to take steps to avoid playing with those people then you're going to have to learn to dral with it.
---
Nope lesion is definitely still alive
---
ASININE MORTAL 
---
Change any graphic settings and back again to fix it. Hopefully they patch it soon
---
&gt;Black stone

*For Honor wants to: KNOW YOUR LOCATION*
---
This is done by a series of actions by the players. Not going to say how as I don't want to run into it more then I already have. And I wanted to add you can also change your shadow quality also to get rid of this glitch. 
---
Nice. I've done the same thing. Got into the reflex of just whacking the F key when I get downed.
---
Dokk, Vigil, BOSG God 
---
ahh the middle E guys at it again
---
What about if I make a rotation hole with an impact and take 5hp off Pulse? 
---
I totally agree, thanks mate :)
---
Its worse now than it was before wind bastion
---
It’s done by all 5 players on a team working together to deliberately exploit it. If it happens then the entire enemy team deserves a report and you should probably send in a vid as evidence to Ubi 
---
Can everyone get a direct line to a community manager to get people banned for being toxic or is that reserved for streamers?
---
Add me Yeubae
---
I get accused of MnK in every game I play, and it's stupidly annoying. I think far more people get accused and harassed about using it when they aren't than there are people who actually do use it. I think MnK has No place whatsoever on consoles, even though I typically stomp them since they usually have trash game knowledge. Even if you beat them it isn't "fair and square" they still had an advantage and may kill your friends etc and it ruins the experience, if I was in a fist fight and I could beat someone on steroids I'd still rather fight them not on steroids. They get odds stacked in their favor from the start especially with specific things MnK can do better than a controller outright. Console players play more casually than PC players, they have less money etc invested and most play for fun and aren't trying to "git gud" but just have a good time. Hard to do when you have cheaters running around.
---
Was sick and had just had passed in his sleep.
---
Thanks man. Thing looks awesome!
---
Wait ,so you don't like team killers, so you team kill. Does that mean you don't like yourself?
---
chill dude. how is he a retard for not seeing a tweet??
---
Siege was worse to me as a new player than any other game I've played before. If I did something wrong I'd get tked instead of being told that I did something wrong and why I shouldn't do it. I also had a couple days where I consistently ran into 3-stacks that would tk me(for no reason) one at a time so that I'd have to sit out an entire game.
---
So would you think that a thatcher and Jäger/rook would be a respectable main set up 
---
I’m with you on this. The community complains about every bug no matter how minor but the vocal majority wanted to keep raptor legs despite it being ugly AF. 
---
She seemed excited/surprised by it so I thought he knew already lol i have no idea 
---
I press properties and the only thing on the ui that changes is that it says unlock a test version and game launch arrangements
---
no it wouldnt stop crying and start playing w a 5 stack and maybe u wont get tked for sucking in casual
---
Exactly right. Text chat off, not ideal but the game is way more fun as it stands.
---
Alright but thats a stupid concept considering its not something thats easily controllable 
---
Ehhh this XQC dude is also toxic from what Ive seen in Overwatch 
---
Here's my experience from what seems like a week of CS GO now.
---
I have never played CS in like years except for 1.6 I think 6 years ago. 
---
1. CS GO is free now, but they whole it gets cheater swarmed is rare. At least from what I've seen. 
---
2. I haven't got vote kicked for playing bad. Which is really nice coming from Siege where you get votekicked as a low level quite easily. I've only seen people get votekicked for cheating only so far.
---
3. There's tons of community maps and modes to play from.
---
My personal favorite thing about the game? If you died, you lost a gun fight. Not you got Lion rushed, exploited, glitched, hit reg wonk, sound wonk. You simply lost a fire fight.
---
I'm way more relaxed and happy playing CS. Thats something Siege has not offered in like 900h of dealing with bullshit.
---
DM if you want help getting into CS GO. I'll send you some aim training guides, ideal reticle/FoV and some weapon knowledge I have a common grasp about.
---
Is this a hitchhikers guide reference? 
---
What would you recommend for finka setup, cause I want to support my team with the nanobots if needed? Weapon set up I mean, like the spear, lmg, shotgun, what attachments etc
---
That thumbnail tho! Putting "teamkilling" next to racism.
---
Cuz the game is balanced around it
---
One of my favorite books of all time. Totally surprised that of all the Tom Clancy novels, this one hasnt become a movie yet. Rumor has it though, they are making one shortly. 
---
i was the first person to post it lmao
---
If you like the tactical nature of R6, look into Insurgency, it's larger scale, but it's a ton of fun.
---
Me vs the guy she tells you not to worry about. 
---
Those 5 things all happen in every FPS game. I remember when i was younger and had a squeaky voice playing Halo 3 online. Some dude said he was goona "rape my little ass"
---
I muted him and moved on with life. Not too hard
---
Repeated Team killing offenses are punished very harshly.  So ever once  In awhile, an accidental team kill is ok.  It just happens.  Murphy’s law after all. 
---
That being said, team killing really sucks when your in front of someone watching a lane and they’re stupidly watching the same one.  Then they shoot you because they’re aiming for the enemy.  That’s when I get pissed at it.  
---
matchmaking in ranked is with your rank, the normal one you see
---
in casual however there is a hidden rank just like the rank points, you dont see that but its there and is used for casual
---
thats it
---
Lol, I don’t even watch him. Blitz is broken there’s no denying in that argument. 
---
Try to play a game against a high elo 5 stack that run Lion, Dokka, Jackal, Zofia and Blitz, we’ll see which mindset you’ll be on about.
---
Credit jäger himself 
---
It would. As a Twitch main, sometimes even I've to go Thatcher coz some of my friends want to play a bit differently on a random day. For ex. As Twitch you have to navigate your drone really carefully. Thatcher, at least in respect of getting rid off jammers on the inside and traps and gadgets laid outside is a no brainer. Rook has a good primary, great gadget. Jager can save you from getting stunned at the last moment.
---
It's a great combo imo. 
---
Ye
---
Game has more population than ever. 
---
What are you spending those credits on?
---
It's just a sad reality of a game like this that there's always gonna be these kinds of people. I think it's a really shit excuse to say "just don't solo queue" and plenty of other things. Not everyone has friends, not everyone has people they can hop in with to enjoy the game. Siege has been tied with toxicity for me along with OW but at least in OW I can still live. Ubi needs to implement features. People think they're being funny memeing and TK'ing are deplorable. Same goes with the people who harass the women in the community. There's plenty of good in this community, but for every good person there just seems to be 2 bad people there
---
No kidding, is everyone here new to FPS games? Its an 18+ video game lol... Mute them and move on. This will not end. 
---
&gt; team kill. JUST TAKE IT OUT
---
yeah ,no
---
&gt;  just look at kaid's shotgun recoil on pc vs console
---
Yeah, and this is the only gun that it's really a problem, before that you hardly heard anybody about that. And Kaid's shotgun is obviously bugged on console. 
---
&gt;  the fact that they have people dedicated to stopping people from crashing servers on pc but not on console..
---
This seems to be an xbox issue so it might  not be up to Ubi to fix it. I never had someone on PS4 DDOs the server, only personal via party chat (they get you IP, not an UBI issue again).
---
Your main argument was "but programming is hard so let's just give up" I guess you also think the rest of the game just happened magically, and a binary fell in ubisofts lap.
---
On top of that, having it mirror the outfit alibi uses would probably be super easy. The skins are all there, it's clearly loading the default skin, just load a different one. You know, exactly like it does for alibi herself.
---
You could've tried a valid point like "it's for balance, if you want to get the best of the alibis, you have to give up attachments on your gun" , but nope you went with "coding is hard" and then proceeded to insinuate that people could just be "not lazy" an fix it without the source code.
---
The video link goes straight to his channel not sure what more credit I can give.
---
They say they have very high confidence in their system, and it is very complex. One guy from valve talked about it during a lecture on their anti cheat systems

Hello MatiVilchez, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/acayfx/take_a_look_at_this_please_add_a_notforgive_team/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
no, ur stats have nothing to do with ranking. its only wins and losses
---
Not that, it doesn't apply to illegal combatants. 
---
So you can gas and frag terrorists at your own leisure. 
---
Definitely in casual
---
I at least needed post something 
---
man this community upvoting this and at the same time post of people downranking to play bronze people and showing funny clips
---
Yeh, how bout you go mind your own business, let the guy do whatever he wants, we don't all have to be good at games. Plus no one cares if you are good or not, the only ppl that should be remotely able to brag about being good, and criticizing others for not being as good as them, are those in the pro league.
---
Man, I had this happen to my team in ranked. We had no idea how to fix it at the time. Hope ubi bans those who abuse this glitch.
---
Jager Himself
---
Thank you everyone! 
---
This was on Fortress though... so im still a little puzzled.
---
Feel bad man
---
&gt; NINE FUCKING DAYS
---
So you never thought they were on vacation, right?
---
Buy it from the store itself and not ingame, and it should work
---
The blitz buff we really needed
---
Its sad that people ruin others fun like that... Its because of these comments that some girls still see gaming as something not made for them, while its actually made for anyone and its such a rich 'universe' that anyone could find something they like to play and have fun with. I really wish there weren't these toxic people, not only on Siege, but on any game that has multiplayer on it. There are awesome experiences one can have with multiplayer, but these people ruin some of them.
---
Love it
---
The killcams are laggy
---
Its about as toxic as youd expect an M rated FPS. 
---
I think anyone whos been playing online games for longer than 10 years, knows that this isnt a game issue. Its a human issue, you cannot fix this. This is online gaming. Of course some games are exceptions but FPS games breed this behaviour. Just mute them and move on.
---
Upload the videos to a drive or YouTube, raise a ticket on Ubisoft website and mail them the link. This is what I did for a different issue. 
---
Ranked ONLY takes winning or losing into account, KD doesn't matter, performance what so ever doesnt matter. Same for casual, except it's separate and hidden from you. 
---
as for casual matchmaking: It just based on winning or losing (as mentioned above), level and everything else isn't taking into account.
---
Smurfing on casual isn't really a thing as far as I know. 
---
Im not criticizing his rank, i'm criticizing him for smurfing.
---
Yeah thats true, they're sometimes more receptive towards people making mistakes than these adolescents and grown adults that just blames everything on the team or into you. 
---
How do I get it live for an iPhone, whenever it try to make it a wallpaper it isn’t live 
---
Your first comment says otherwise. 
---
well yea people want to play it because it's a great game! but problems are plaguing it.. just go watch the video Jaeger Himself put on youtube about the dark side of it.. it will die if they dont fix these issues
---
There's no denying an opinion, what?
---
Use Lesion, he exists.
---
What if he wasn’t boosting but just playing with friends. What if you went pro and your friends are like hey want to play and they aren’t pro or even diamond. Is he supposed to say no I can’t I’m pro 
---
Hell ya, I love it, I had this one on just about all my guns at one point! Dinosaur charms or "UBI ROCKS!" floppy disk are probably 2nd and 3rd in the running lmao.
---
If I don't need to go anyone specific, I always go finka and cav. But I only really play maverick, twitch, hibana, doc, mira or bandit 
---
Why did a mod post it before you then? 
---
I said it before when someone posted this and I'll say it again, she was better looking before, but I ain't mad about this either. Bae for lyfe. 
---
Noticed it too...
---
To be completely honest I think bikini bodhi encourages the teamkilling behavior you see in a lot of these clips. Making it seem funny or cool. Obviously there is a difference between doing it between friends and to random players but his videos promote it nonetheless. 
---
And a rocket launcher

Ying ripping them phat clouds. #VapeLife
---
Sorry, that's just what an offensive retreat looks like, not gonna turn my back on the enemy!
---
I believe in the past this has been due to reused faces between ops (which were previously covered in all other skins, hence it makes little sense for Hibana). But that might have been a lie
---
Nah this was long ago when I started playing r6.
---
That is exactly what I was proposing. 2 maps and one option labeled random (so 3 total options for the lobby to vote on) The exact same as COD. This issue has been figure out by every game except siege, for decades lol
---
A REALLY BIG FUCKING HOLE COMING RIGHT UP

*Gruff voice* Big fucking onee-chan coming right up
---
Go to xboxdvr.com and search for your GT. There's eveb a 'post to reddit' button ;)
---
I'll explain this from experience of playing on SEAS and EU. Both are completely different servers and have the following differences.
---
1. SEAS players are absolutely brain dead and will meta spam every game above Gold 3. I used to play roamer and I  quit because I'd have to deal with Lion, Jackal, Dokkabi, Blitz and some other operator everytime I try to rotate. I switched to anchoring and it's even worse when Ying just walks in after Lion already has our asses grounded.
---
2. Hit registration is absolutely broken every day. I look back on recorded footage and there we go. Blood from the head but zero damage recorded. Meanwhile I get one body shot and die as a headshot with 100 health.
---
3. Sound is even worse. Oh you head them to your left? Wrong! They're right of you, except it's already too late. You heard them above you? No dummy, they're right behind you. Except it's Blitz and you're already dead.
---
4. Silent dropping is still not patched and might as well be a feature at this point. Watching a hatch to take a flank? Later you're team mates scream that they're on site (Kafe Red stairs hatch on 3F best example) and you didn't know because you can't hear them drop.
---
5. Client side debris and destruction. For fucks sake, when I tap a barricade I want the part to fall down or disappear. Not just balance there like the fate of the universe depends on it. But hey, my opponents perspective 95% of the time is a clean hole while I have a broken board balancing god knows how.
---
6. Rubber banding is still prevalent and you might as well add Tracer at this point. The number of times I've walked into site across a hole only to get rubber banded back has me vexed. On one occasion I couldn't plant on time because I kept rubber banding back to my previous position. Explain how that isn't broken.
---
7. Cheaters and macros are back in business again and Ubi can't even afford a decent anti cheat inspite of running a Pro League and being a AAA studio. 
---
8. Ranked and casual have been in the same pathetic stale state for over what 3 years now? Ranked hasn't seen any improvements. Casual still doesn't have site picking but hey I'm sure chat filter Mk. 3 will solve everything and make the game better. Nice move hiding player stats to disguise your broken MM system by the way Ubisoft.
---
9. Servers take a piss every once in a while and hurr durr my net is bad. No. My internet is fine. Your game just cannot handle loads during firefights and intensive moments. I could play on EU with ping below 100 in CS GO, but the minute I run Siege I get booted for having 40 ping in my native server. _lole op you have red icon bad internet lole_
---
I'd love to expand on all these points with proof from popular streamers and Pro League games but it's 5AM and I need sleep.
---
If the above isn't enough to showcase how bad Siege is currently and how it's utterly broken for a competitive game, man you're need to pull your head out.
---
I have nearly 1k hours, don't have them all.
---
This
---
NOh.
---
If you encounter another toxic player, record it and than send it to the mods or support team 
---
Instead it complaining about trolls maybe complain about them not fixing the game. 
---
Oh thanks, that is very helpful
---
Agreed. Even the Discord is a fucking nightmare. Going there for games is like purposely trying to find toxic players to play with.
---
Honestly this video is why i prefer to 5 stack and avoid solo q at all cost on here. Especially with my experience on EU. It's just toxic. I generally can cope with Solo Queuing, the wild side of it. 
---
However some people just act like apes when a female voice speaks up, or shit goes south and they are looking to play the blame game.
---
Some people will go ahead and throw in fact Ps3/XBL cod days was even meaner and rough and it was. I was there for it all of it, was real great being called hard R every time i spoke. 
---
But does that mean we should keep these shitty behaviours up? Not really. Just watching the sexual harassment was cringe enough.
---
It also makes the experience of watching big streamers who are trying this game out unfun, especially with xQc right now. While he can be toxic there are times when he isn't people just throw shit at him, TK'ing or just being rude towards him. 
---
Would really love to see UBI do something over time. 
---
John McDonald has said himself that it takes into account how you interact with Steam as a platform as a whole, not just within CSGO. If you're an asshat in general, they know and match you with other asshats. It's a wonderful system. Ubi would be hard pressed to do it at the same level of granularity due to only having game data, but it would be leaps and bounds above what we have now.
---
Yeah i got 2 packs as well. 50k in the bank. Weird. 
---
Not complaining. 
---
Everyone needs to upvote this to the top of the subreddit. People need to see!
---
Agreed. Great book.
---
Can you explain how to do it please?
---
this is why we need a ww3
---
I've been playing for 10+ years, so back it up there kiddo. Just throwing your hands up and saying "gamers will be gamers" is part of the fucking problem. And its not about ruining my mood, its about literally being unable to play the game. If 1) speaking up gets you team killed because you are a woman, and 2) not speaking up gets you killed because you aren't communicating, its not about having someones feelings hurt and is literally about being unable to play the game, (not even getting into the fact that people pay actual money for this). Again, why is team killing a bannable offense? Why don't people like you rush to defend team killers unless the person being affected is a woman, in which case ya'll come out of the woodwork? Like sure, posting this video isn't going to change things overnight, but the reluctance of people like you to even having a conversation is part of the reason things are as bad as they are. Showing R6S to people is a fucking embarrassment.
---
The one time I tried showing this game to someone, people were spamming racist bullshit into mics. I don't show people R6S anymore. Yes its an 18+ game, and yes its just words and it doesn't change anything, but its still a fucking embarrassment.
---
And again, all the non-sexist non-racist things you mentioned are also complained about, but why does no one ever defend the griefers there? People just say it sucks, UBI plz fix, then joke about how Ubi sucks. But as soon as its about a woman or minority, the "man up" police shows up.
---
And please don't strawman this, I'm not and almost no one is saying that its just about people's feeling should be protected, if so, people would be posting videos of teammates saying mean things, but that isn't what is happening, people are complaining about a systematic problem that both negatively impacts certain individuals disproportionately while also making this hobby worse. The fact that I can't go to certain game shops with female friends to sit down and play a board game b/c of creeps, the fact that I can't in all honesty show a co-worker certain video games without worrying that someone will shout "nigger" while I'm showing it to them, the fact that I can't play certain games in common spaces without headphones, etc are all problems worth addressing even if I am a selfish asshole. Yes, its always been a problem, but so was polio, maybe its time to start fixing it rather than sticking our head in the sand.
---
When I try doing that I get sniped from some window/angle I didn't even think about, always a 50-50 chance to die to something.
---
It's a huge ass map but no line of fire longer than 1m lol For me it's the worst  map, even worse than Tower. Yeah Tower had many rooms as well but you not too many hiding spots. Here in each room you have tables, chairs, etc  
---
Everybody wins defense and the deciding factor is who gets it first on def again.
---
Sounds a lot like Pengu tbh, he got told off by ubi for being toxic and have him an ultimatum iirc
---
Its caused by getting multiple people to shoot an unreinforced wall and the fix is to change any graphical setting and it will go back to normal.
---
I only play ranked, its all i ever played. 
---
Win eight rounds with rook on the team
---
For me, it look a lot like "maréchal, nous voilà !" the national anthem during the second war 
---
I wanna fuck the absolute hell out of Hibana if you catch my drift fellas 😎 
---
Also Dokkaebi, Ash, Caveira and IQ
---
Worst part is there’s no repercussions on Xbox 
---
My guess would be with the first year 4 op
---
Hello rook_rikk, your submission has been removed as it appears to be a question about the Holiday Pack issue.
---
The issue with redeeming 25,000 renown has been resolved, as per [@Rainbow6Game](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game) on Twitter:
---
&gt; The Holiday Pack has been fixed!
---
&gt;
---
&gt;If you own all operators, you can now correctly convert the Holiday Pack for 25K Renown. If you already opened it and received an error message, your pack will now work as intended. [^Source](https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1080919098157031429)
---
It's a shame that so many people are abusing this glitch in ranked, we only used it rarely when we were messing around on casual/private and would never have done it for personal gain. 
---
Buck, Hibana and Echo are all very good
---
For me, it look a lot like "maréchal, nous voilà !" the national anthem during the second war
---
you know the collaboration and all of that ...
---
Eh better I suppose
---
No more Americans please,neither do i want to see more French,Russian or British operators,i want actual new countries my dream Y4 content would be Australian SASR (Most likely gonna happen) Czech URNA or 601 SkSS,Slovakian 5th SOR,Finnish  UTJR,and lastly some Balkan country,if at least 2 of those get confirmed ill definitely buy year4 pass
---
Yeah I understand this, its just that back then I aasnt aware of that and I decided to just let it slide.
---

I believe as my man Russian Badger has also been one to and I quote “Micheal Jordan” in an FPS game. It was one of his BF4 videos.
---
#Same problem different developers???
---
Yeah I’ve gotten lucky on PS4 and found a couple people to play with. It still happens though. Bullying has always been bad on online shooters. I’m just glad we’re past the days of having to find some clan/guys hosted server and playing on it. I do not have fond memories of some servers in CS 1.3
---
Just own it. If they can't interact properly then mute the fuckers. Nothing like radio silence for stalking. 👍
---
I main cav too. I wish i could say scary things in a girl voice when I land an interrogation. I also wish the intero'd person could hear the cav on mic for that second. Haha just out of no where "gonna get ya peanut butta" 
---
looks like a monster from the Dead Space games xD
---
Yeah the siege community is pretty crummy but we have to be there for the girls who get harassed and the people who tk randoms. But if there’s any girls who play r6 on Xbox and want to squad up just to have someone in there game, don’t even have to speak that’s cool. GT: FourFire650061
---
You're lucky to have a friend with you! I have been playing for over a year now and this still happens to me so often that I usually only play when my dad's best friend is home from work so I have a vote to keep me. 
---
In my opinion, return team killing doesn't do any good. It is basically feeding the trolls. If it happens all I say is "at least wait for someone to place their gadgets and reinforce before you team kill" then I report for toxic behavior, report them through Xbox for unsporting behavior, then leave. If I'm not the one who was team killed I still  report the team killer. If my teammates are constantly harassing one person, I send that person a message and tell them to exit to lobby and invite me to a match and I go play with them. 
---
Try to spread kindness instead of letting the assholes feel like they're winning. 
---
She’s like one of them inflatable things at car dealerships that flops around all willyknilly like
---
As all things, umm, could be
---
That’s a lie but ok. No one would consider pro without having played ranked for many seasons. No one goes pro from playing just casual or being plat 3 lmfao.
---
Rank really means nothing lol. I have achieved Diamond 8/12 seasons and I'm nowhere close to being a good competitive player. The closest I have gotten to actual competition was subbing in for scrims against then Ferocity eSports and then IDK (now Secret). Got 1-5'd and 3-6'd respectively. 
---
A lot of pros avoid Ranked now too simply because of how different it is from the PL settings. Just cause players like Pengu and Canadian grind Ranked doesn't mean all do. 
---
If you look for players LFT in the semi-pro scene and up (think cusp of CCS), rank is a non-factor. Experience playing comp and how well you perform in a team environment matters so much more. I remember people were giving Nicks on ExG shit because he peaked plat 2 yet he's better at comp than most diamonds including myself. 
---
Ja Blitz ist ein Problem.
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
Oh shit
---
I actually disagree with you on the clip linked. He's not doing anything to promote toxicity besides being funny. He's not insulting them, or t-bagging, or teamkilling. He's just playing in a ridiculous way. 
---
Is downranking to play with newer players a shitty thing to do? Sure. But this isn't new for any game and if nothing else, the ones killed are going to learn from it as to not let it happen again. 
---
Elite operators having fucking seizures to dodge bullets.

Just like the simulations.

Lion  and Jager aren't even overpowered.

I agree! We need people to know how to fix this so ranked is playable again until Ubisoft fixes it!
---
I *strongly* believe that this glitch improved the game
---
Look at the ping of the Orange team.

+10***

tbf XQC is a toxic little twat tho, his opinion shouldnt matter here
---
&gt;I'm glad that this issue got resolved! I thought I wouldn't get my renown lol.

Jackal and Dokebai are both good anti roamers.  If you're looking for defense Mira and Maestro are good anchors.  If you like roaming Caviera and Vigil are super good.

Plz make Ela look less... how do I put it https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/0/0b/STAYPUFT.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140915023754 here’s a link

Yeah I see. It's bs

Toxicity is part of online gaming culture since the dawn of time. If you don't like someone, just mute them.
---
Sad but true
---
My dad made me a deal and said 8f i read the book first then he'll buy me the game.
---
What is your rank? Also, i agree that it is a big problem on console. I think they should make it so the search for a game wont start if m&amp;k is detected.
---
I really don’t but I don’t think it’s that big of a deal this game has terrorists in it

The ash charge still blows up. Whether it's on a surface or not. 
---
“Dude what the fuck”
---
Yep
---
Maybe if you were able to locate it but if you shot at it with a shot gun wouldn’t you just be putting a hole in the wall just like ash was about to do?
---
Would be interested to see if you could wallbang it tho

Honestly, there are so many assholes who think that because they themselves aren't the target of toxicity based on their gender or race, this game doesn't have a problem. A lot of people who have accents or with higher voices (girls/younger players) are verbally assaulted because they decided to use voice chat for call outs. The game seriously needs a system to address voice chat toxicity.
---
It still isn’t fixed on ps4
---
The charge falls to the ground and blows up there 
---
I just love how Siege and RL are the only two games I’ve heard of on that list. Being an Xbox boy it sure does make me proud to see Sony not promoting their “decent” content rather promoting games people don’t actually take much interest in.
