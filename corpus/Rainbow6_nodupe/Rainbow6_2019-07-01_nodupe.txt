Only game in history to have sbmm in their casual mode. Leads to people deranking in ranked.
---
Cute mat
---
Nice you must come from csgo
---
We are in a dire need of thatcher mains........
---
I always recommend trying thermite, thatcher, and sledge on attack, or rook, Kapkan, or Mute on defence. However I would always recommend to try all the operators you can to get a feel for what you like.
---
I‚Äôm sure this sounded funnier in your head.
---
Shit this checks out tbh.

The fact that u tried to shoot the unbreakable wall... interesting

You put cav (who has one of the lowest win rates) above very good and versatile ops like Mira smoke capitao lion like STFU and delete your post

So is this like an operator gadget or an everyone gadget

Oh i play on console cause I'm poor so i don't know if any of my tips would help. I would say if you don't already just try to use him every match if you can. If i stop playing buck for even a match or two it throws off my gameplay next time i play him. If you use the assault rifle i would use the compensator over any other attachment. I did not notice the amount of people not using it when using a spray weapon. Probably won't be useful to you but i hope it helped.üòÅ
---
It has sbmm in casual?
---
I didnt say that
---
My understanding is that it removes the acceleration that is generally used with controllers to have faster reactions. On PC acceleration is regarded as a really bad thing as it makes mouse swipes inconsistent as it essentially increases your sensitivity during a quick swipe. Muscle memory is hugely important with MnK.  
---
  
---
If it does what I think, then it could be really good for console players once they find, and get used to a new sens.
---
You on pc?

Hey im kinda new to this game (started 1 month ago). What does busting the server mean? Ive seen this happen on ps4. People getting 13000 ping. Wth is actually happening?
---
It's good to have favourite characters but don't get too comfortable, you need to have knowledge about every operator in the game, some of that knowledge comes from experience. In my circle of friends the worst player is strictly buck/hibana and frost/lesion main. When it comes to other operators, the best way I can describe this, is a total disaster, he just doesn't know anything. But that is not the problem, the problem is that once his attempt at other ops fails, he returns to his mains.

Honestly I was never really a fan of them in any COD

This was the best of the terrible maps. I would love if they removed favela and yatch.

If they had to bring back one of the bad maps i would prefer this one.

At least barlett isn't back.

Add me if you ever feel like not solo queuing Schwifteezy. I‚Äôm gold 2 rn
---
Cute!
---
I would recomend grinding a bit before deciding you like the game. Theres a lot to buy....
---
Well, if you want to spend money, id get R6 credits and buy boosters, you should have a free one and be able to buy a couple off of the Ubisoft store in game as well. Then you just play, autoclicking helps but that‚Äôs pc exclusive as far as I know. Other than that, you could just buy them in bundles by year to save a bit.
---
What in the actual hell is that ping? Seriously...how is that acceptable? I can only imagine how the actual game went.
---
That‚Äôs a Pro Team Fortress move
---
Sounds like you need another hobby. At the end of the day none of those stats matter nor does anyone besides you care about them.
---
A really insignificant and useless hole coming right up!
---
He somehow actually managed to load in like 10 seconds after this post.
---
Throughout the time I've played (a couple months) I've never seen the R6 Credits go on sale. But there really is no way to get the operators except grinding renown or buying R6 Credits. I always find myself buying the operators in bundles like the Y2 bundle which is significantly less that buying them one by one so I feel like that'd be the best way since I always find myself spending my renown on packs or skins for guns.

Yeah, I kinda thought about that. Just a rough idea for now but something around the lines of this would be nice to see if they could somehow work around this.

The mute feature is wonderful, I suggest trying it.

Even better idea, just turn off your screen and aim for the sound of footsteps

The only way they can get your IP is if you join their party

However if the whole server starts being booted just know it‚Äôs not you their booting it‚Äôs the server, and it can‚Äôt be prevented

Kinda quirky tho

Eeevvveeennn bettterrrrr idddeeeaaaa, just dont play the game lol

*Vulcan, Alberta  intensifies*
---
Problem is that on ps4 you can have an unlimited number of accounts on your PlayStation...  so if you get a ban for leaving you just switch accounts. Ubi needs to find a way to counter this.
---
No but the base ops pretty much cover all of the main play styles so just explore and choose from them. I recommend you try out kapkan. His msg has no recoil and his traps can earn you kills
---
Yacht and favela are the best. When they took them out my entire squad stopped playing cause we missed them that much
---
Just small lag in general? Or is everyone in the lobby being put to 1000+ ping, because if so that means the server is being booted by the other team

Do you like it?

3 games in a row i experienced lag switchers, reported them even went into chats with ubisoft and nothings been done. cannot be bothered with this game especially when i was about to hit plat 1
---
Looks like it would make an awesome deck of cards! (no special rules or anything). Though one suggestion, it's not too clear that it's the queen of diamonds (you can figure it out, but it's doesn't jump out like it should). But looks great, keep up the good work!

Eh wasn‚Äôt worth my time to try just to maybe go to OT and lose any way. I just held a grenade every round until I was able to surrender. Took the elo hit and re-queued to another game. Was a lot faster than sweating this match.
---
Did you get those nasty spawn peeks?
---
Actually think about where you're placing ADS's, especially for bomb.
---
Don't just put them all at windows/doors of obj and think you're good. Place them where you or your teammates are actually playing/holding.
---
For example if you're defending Billiards/Hookah on Coastline. There's should usually be a defender playing on main stairs beside Hookah, put an ADS there.
---
Another example if you're defending basement on Bank, there's usually someone playing server stairs trying to keep that control for as long as possible, give them an ads or two in there.
---
This is probably my biggest pet peeve. Everybody wanna play J√§ger but people rarely use him correctly.

This would be unfair as I would be unable to shoot attacker drones and thats not fun :c
---
Funny story, didnt know about that cause i dont remember being able to do that a couple years ago. Idk maybe i dont remember right anyway. Its 1v1 happen to see glaz outside, droned to get diffrent angle on him. Headshots me in no time flat thru the window. Terrorists win. Cool. Now i know lol.
---
Okay okay, idea:
---
Country: New Zealand
---
Trainer: An operator who loved the forests and animals as a child, having trained kiwis from NZ and wanting to protect them. Using his biotech prowess, he made personal bubble shields that were bullet and explosive resistant. When a defender shoots the kiwi, the shield activates for 5s before deactivating, allowing it to move and see again. It cannot be destroyed but can be pacified if continuously shot by a defender. 
---
Weapons:
---
MARS-L Assault Rifle
---
FN MAG Light Machine Gun
---
Glock 17 Pistol
---
(2 Speed / 2 Armor)
---
Ahh I just not have seen that. Screen is pretty small on my phone

REPOST
---
Maybe they could do an Australia event where it's only outback and kiwi drones and thermite is replaced with vegemite.
---
D:
---
Ik. But so is using IQ glitches or fuze speed glitch, yet they take those out of the game and dont touch the adapters.
---
I like the idea of having his gun have the M249 scope. The gun choices are great too, I think he might need to be a three armor to be balanced though
---
Can I use this
---
For one I'd love to see a link to the article where they've said it's cheating and for two you were saying it's illegal not cheating and even then Its still not really cheating, mouse and keyboard wouldn't just give you instant god like aim you'd have to play for awhile and get comfortable with it and get settings dialed in and this and that before it's actually nearly as accurate and smooth like a pc and even then I see people all the time on controller that look like they're on mouse and keyboard when they're not so clearly you can be just as accurate on controller as if you were on mouse and keyboard, you just have to feel comfortable with your settings and have good muscle memory
---
Run out die immediately then blame your teammates for throwing
---
Peek out in the beginning to get a kill then go back to obj to tell everyone.

And when you do, is it with echo?

Glaz can break a window and the defender can shoot out

Was pretty boring tbh, he barely plays with it and tries to get good unlike his other videos, and when he does get a match the enemy team just line up for him.

I think it's that it is relatable, yeah. It's hard to relate to seeing an alien for the first time, but seeing the *news report* of someone else seeing an alien for the first time is how most of humanity would experience it.
---
The movie has also done a super good job of hyping up that the aliens are well established around the humans. The character you're watching has been trying to decide if he buys into what the kids think is aliens, like on the news -- or believe his older brother, who insists its just crazy coincidence and nothing is happening. Here, he is deciding, the thing in their cornfield, the thing on their roof, etc. is the same as this.
---
This would be too op bc no one would want to shoot it.

Actually put down your gadget please, its useful.

The guy is a console plat 3 w/ barely 100 hours in ranked but apparently has recoil control better than most PL Capitao players using angled grip and muzzle break. 
---
Nothing sketchy about that though, right? üôÑ
---
The fact that you just got to level 100 is just a coincidence. There is MMR in casual just like ranked to try and provide and balanced experience.   The problem is that a lot of high ranked players only play ranked because it‚Äôs a much better experience so their casual MMR doesn‚Äôt get adjusted with their actual skill.
---
I think a lot more ranked players are doing casual right now because of all the hackers.  Look at it as a way to learn.
---
They can ban the good ones and we only have maverick.

How could you improve the ability?

Sir I'm going to have to ask you to stop playing the game the way you want, our copper hero BigBungus05 has decided that only bomb counts.
---
Yes
---
no it does not effect mmr.
---
I certainly do not know whats in the y 4 pack, but Buck is a very strong op with his rifle shotgun comp. Once mastered, you will dominate on almost every map because of the vertical play that is possible with him. Try it out :)

I'd say since it'd make about as much as a vault hole, it should have a weakness. If a defending operator threw an explosive, i.e. an impact grenade or a nitro cell at it then it would break.

1.0 means for every win you have, you have a loss. So if you have a 2.0, you win double the games you lose. If you have a .5 win rate, you lose double the games that you win.
---
I‚Äôll beat you to it.
---
I love you :D
---
Please do not roam on the other end of the map during Bomb or even Hostage.
---
I despise the majority of the shitty Cav mains for this reason. They either die in the first 20 seconds or are too busy being Sam Fisher to help the team out...it's like having a 4 man team.
---
If you are roaming, please rotate back to a lurk spot if your team takes 3 losses. 
---
Lastly, pay attention to the the intel Ops in your team. Talk to them. Cav mains in my experience take their role too seriously and say fuck all...no call outs or requests for tagging.
---
Tell them where you're roaming and what area you'd like covered.
---
If I'm playing Echo, Valk or any intel Op...I'll guide you in towards the enemy. 
---
Also, if you ARE a Cav main...and the team doesn't have any 3 speeds, please get the top hatches. If there is a 3 speed....direct him/her to the hatches and HIDE
---
You could say that...
---
Thanks, I'll try it
---
Thank you kindly, and if you don't mind me asking what would people consider a "good" win rate?
---
see kills are good and all but other things also come into factor. How are your call outs, your info gathering. JUst going and geting 3 kills is good but it is not worth it if you cannot give your team decent intel about where they are and who killed you. Having a friend play with you is def helpful but u can still get out high silver and low gold by yourself.
---
I will play casual when I'm forced too, but I do make callouts in chat, but in my head, even tho it's simple, I don't do that, I'll try that, talking out loud, and I will!
---
All 27.
---
I know this was posted as a meme and I have been very against Nokk getting more damage or an Acog. 
---
However, the more I play the more I want her to get Echo‚Äôs MP5SD since that‚Äôs pretty much FMG with an Acog in terms of stats. 
---
I find it hell to go against Anchors with more armor, damage, and Acog while using a folding pistol even with her stealth.

Yea, I believe that it'd be good if they give him a regular acog, or give him 3 smokes instead of 2, like he had before(granted in his current state, it really doesn't help him drastically.) I agree that ubi has to come up w something to give him some sort of advantage. An operator that can't push at all is pretty useless in most maps imo
---
Try to organize what ops are needed for the plant, not for kills. Watch how they play, learning what everybody plays like can help you know who you can follow/have follow you when you need them. Watch lots of videos of strats to learn them and the counters and try to run them w your teammates. Coummunicate what you need as soon as you get an objective picked.

Everyone used to reset to 2500. 
---
New softreset this season resets you to a middle point between 
---
&gt; Your last season's ending MMR --And 2500 
---
If you dont have a rank/mmr change last season (didnt play/new) then you start off with 2500 mmr. 
---
Your starting off rank can be anywhere from 1500-3500 this season and forward.

At 0 placements, unranked you start out at 2500mmr which is gold4. So thats understandable. Thats also why gold4 is the hardest rank to escape, its so unpredictable

These other comments basically nail it, all I can say otherwise is be positive, practice flexibility and strats together as a team so everyone will know their role and execute it together with synergy.

Blasphemy
---
The gadget is stupid op, and is basically a super safe Maverick. This would be an absolute menace in pro-league. With high level of communication and good game knowledge would leave all common anchorspots useless as he could just wallbang their ass from the other side of the map, once a teammate told him someone was there. A safe hardbreacher with no counterplay aside killing him? 
---
Honestly even just having explosive rounds would be too op. He would make it impossible to hold an angle, as he could just shoot the ground next to you and take you out.
---
No worries! It‚Äôs the best way to do it. Helps in situations like the OP when a defender rushes as soon as you throw cam!
---
Thank you for the tip!

This is also a good idea. A Karma System is...I saw it in Overwatch and it only worked for maybe a few weeks. Then all the hostility was back like the whole Karma thing never happened.

No its been in the game for much longer then that they just recently set it to be the default.

There is a little settings tab on the subreddit, open that, press "Add user flair" and then it should pop up a list of operators for you to choose from
---
One taps, yes

Spawnpeeks no

Well i cant really check that but i can go to the IT department of my campus, however, every other game is running completely fine. So could it be a voice server location switch like what you said. Is there any way i can switch it back or bypass it without using a mobile hotspot?

oh, that's so weird. this is the first time I have experienced it which is why I have posted it

I use the angled grip beause there is no saving the second shot if you double tap it.

Because on smoke it‚Äôs 100000% better to take shotgun smg 11 combo

I don't think reveal phase works without 6th pick and I don't think 6th pick works in random lobbies. You could have 3-5 people wanting to six pick and only one could. 
---
Map pool I completely agree. I don't want to play Sky scraper, where every match just goes to overtime and who gets to attack twice wins in 9/10 matches. The level of play increased quite dramatically last time the map pool was reduced and it would happen again if we reduce it further, which is a big plus.
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like one, he‚Äôs dragging the cursor rather than pushing it

And for what reason? Recruit has less equipment and no weapon customization. He doesn't even have any kind of gadget whatsoever. So... what is your reason to "main" him?

i would justwant a non weathered sights. the acog looks like its been dragged behind a dakar racer.

I know that this isn't a permanent or great solution but maybe give nvidia freestyle a try and check their colorblind options?

move with your teammates and attack or defend as a team

On console most people have privacy settings that keep you from talking in unless you want to, just invite people to a party and if they don't join then the next best thing is looking in an lfg so you can communicate

Use acog on the ops that have it, those that don‚Äôt it‚Äôs a preference thing between the 3 1x zoom scopes( I like holo best). don‚Äôt use laser sights they aren‚Äôt helpful and give your position away, I wouldn‚Äôt bother with suppressors either they reduce your damage and do nothing to help your recoil, despite being quieter they are still audible. I run compensator or flash hider on most guns, try them and see which you prefer. For ops as a beginner there‚Äôs a few I wouldn‚Äôt play, don‚Äôt play castle, beginners rarely use him right, his barricades are more often than not a hindrance to the team trapping them inside or outside the objective, Tachanka is a meme tier operator don‚Äôt use him, (unless you‚Äôre purposely trolling or memeing it up if you‚Äôre dominating with chanka and 4 recruits on casual). Good ops for a beginner is rook on defence you can‚Äôt really go wrong, his armour plates are really helpful for the team and his gun is solid, on attack, ash is a pretty simple operator her guns are good and utility is simple and not overly complicated, can‚Äôt go wrong with thermite or thatcher either, their utilities are essential most of the time, thatcher for destroying electronics, especially electrified walls to allow thermite it Hibana to breach. 
---
Good thing is for newcomers now is the newcomer playlist, no going to lie though there will be some smurfs on there especially if you play PC, but it‚Äôs a good space to test out your ops see which works for you and who you like best. Let me know if you‚Äôve any other questions:) (I‚Äôm rank 100 by the way, and usually manage to get to platinum  in ranked)
---
Did the same two days ago! :D
---
Seeing how many says how her name is pronounced but is wrong hurts me.
---
Too much earrape bass imo and in the first clip there's so much unnecessary downtime
---
Other than that it's pretty good
---
I'd still rather have the option of 6th pick than just not have it at all, plus if your playing as a 5 man with a team/Clan you are in, Reveal phase and 6th pick would be so useful for strats/counterstrats
---
And that's exactly what I meant about the map pool, it just makes so much sense to reduce it down, to a more learnable and playable map pool
---
Tellers is way better than the other but still not one you would pick if consul and garage are available
---
I actually raged and stopped the recording right there, but no its not perspective. Ill check of i got any of the killcam because she starts at about halfway down the window. Also do you *not* know about the rappelling glitch?
---
Frost's weapon would be a good option
---
We get a dozen of those posts every day, what do you want **US** to do about it?

find your sens and dpi, practice a lot of terrorist hunt and finish all the situations. Stay on the objective for kills and easier time playing. USE HEADPHONES

You can check when you found a lobby but you haven't found a server yet

Ela her rof makes up for the recoil which isn‚Äôt even that hard to control but if you want a better gadget lesion they nerfed her Grzmot mines so bad along with her Scorpio but at least that‚Äôs still viable unlike her mines

Hello ChillyChain, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c7rptj/my_game_keeps_crashing_and_i_dont_know_why/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
IQ could definetely see it, idk about the melee. probably not
---
I feel like FMG is not a bad gun. From Defender‚Äôs point of view.
---
FMG9 and MP5K are used by operators who provides wide area utilities and bit of damage in Smoke's case. They often anchors around holding angles while facing enemies who are usually 1 or 2 armor and have went through traps and roamers so they are often not even full health.
---
On Nokk, 2 speed operator whose job is to enter obj and take out anchors, it can feel underwhelming. Against 3 armors, more damage, and ACOG, FMG9 feels inadequate for the job.
---
Ashe, who is also a close combat oriented, uses her speed and gadget to change angles while relying on her very powerful gun to take out her enemies. Nokk only has her stealth to support herself.
---
People often say that you are supposed to go for headshots but that applies to every gun and Attacker guns are supposed to have enough power to deal pretty high damage even from certain distances.
---
It's from a youtuber, I forget which one though.
---
and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pc players don‚Äôt like me that when I play pc with my friends I use a controller and carry they can kiss my ass now they never believed me
---
Loading times as it is very frustrating when the game is held back for other players or they‚Äôre probably a 3-4 man and are like nah let‚Äôs kick this guy.
---
This happens me alot
---
That‚Äôs because Mira‚Äôs vector doesn‚Äôt have the acog as an option.
---
It‚Äôs only good on defense on attack
---
Seems like it would be pretty powerful if melee and bullets can‚Äôt destroy it. Even maestro cams have to become vulnerable to be very useful
---

yes might be, hard to say as long as we dont have gameplay. but you just have to throw/shoot one explosive NEAR it and it gets destroyed. and maybe twitch can deactivate it too for 20 seconds like thatcher. would make sense

I got a chanka ace roaming as him on house the other day lmao. Sasg and pmm equipped. The two best guns in the game.

Be more aggressive and play every day.
---
In that case, I agree with your statement. 
---
I keep hearing "just go for headshots" when people talking about Nokk's FMG when that can be said to everyone in the game. 
---
Except that Nokk is an Attacker whose only advantage is her stealth which is not enough when facing against Anchors with 3 armor, higher damage, and longer range due to ACOG.
---
Thank you I found it

Ranked is a shitshow atm and casual is packed with sweats actually using full on strats, bagging after kills, and messaging me and everyone I know to call them noobs and shitters. Imagine needing to flex on people trying to casually play the game
---
lol silver and bronze is a pit and i have really bad luck. Once you hit silver your teammates are braindead. I literally played with a guy yesterday that thought an enemy IQ was a friendly kaid. 6 out of every 10 matches I get a thrower who tks me. I played with a friend two days ago I got tked first round for no reason, friend tks the guy back and then instead of my friend getting tked after that the guys friend kills me. I‚Äôm just really unlucky in terms of teams, i mean theres been games where i‚Äôve been a silver 2 and gotten a team full of bronzes and have went against 2 plats, a gold and 2 silvers.

Well shit. Always seems to be something deterring me from ranked.

I'm noticing lately a few Siege Youyubers giving the console version of Siege a go for its money and they're finding out the hard way just how different the PC version differs from console. There are a lot of differences between the console and PC versions, my main gripe is the difference between recoil control for many guns on Console then compared to PC. For example Ela's Skorpion Evo, still a nice and viable weapon on PC, but on console it's a mess. Same goes for all machine pistols. The differences so unbearable it's kind of embarrassing.
---
That was fucking spicy
---
It's Reddit &gt;.&lt; You do not agree with something nah downvoted to oblivion.  For they do not agree.

Does colour blind modes change the games colours of just the HUD? The HUD in this game doesn't really  need to be looked at apart from the round timer and ammo count. Should be a very easy fix for the devs to make the HUD a different colour right?
---
Mainly play Ash, Bandit, Hibana and the odd Jaeger so I should remain unaffected by it. Any reason why they‚Äôre always banned?
---
Thanks man!

It's actually so pathetic I've never seen a community so insecure they need to brag about a fucking video game?

The table top community is large and mostly unknown. It's not well known outside the community but the top rated largest game was made by a person on kickstarter. It's called Gloonhaven. Gloomhaven is now getting it's own video game on Steam.
---
A pitch can be done successfully if he can convince Ubi his rule set works AND they know there's a market in tabletop gaming.
---
I personally like it. If something dose not work in one round, you can switch something up and not loose the groove. Attacking and defending come with two different mind sets and it helps to keep a flow going.
---
Yea just choose your platform then scroll down and there will be a bunch of voice channels organized by rank

I see you are on pc, go on steam, library, rainbow six, dlc, and check the bundle so it'll Download. Hope it helps.

If an american wants to play ranked on EU his rank should also be on the line.
---
It‚Äôs about *yay* big.
---
&gt;But a way higher fire rate as you can fire the second shot almost immediately. If we give that sniper a lower fire rate it'd be balanced in my opinion. It should get reverse damage dropoff like i always wnated it for glaz so the player will be required to fight over long distance for the weapon to do full damage.
---
The BOSG isn't always a 1 shot kill. at 20m+ it does 80 dmg.

Depends. Ops are in a fine spot. A new op every 1-2 weeks (depending on how much you play). And bundles every 3-4 weeks.

It would be best to get an Attacker, if you could tell me what your play style for atk is, like rush, quick attacks, strategic or stealthy, but I would suggest nokk or finka, both are good pick out of the ones you don't have, nokk is simple character unless going super sweat mode, she's stealth but you don't need to be stealthy, like cav.

Finka is another good pick, she can help out the team a lot, healing and generaly boosting them, she's a good rush tank and support style charecter, she can get teammates back up when downed
---
Not gonna lie tho, I really do hope goobisoft reduces the size of the gun by at least 5-10% as it takes up literally the entirety of the right side of your screen.

Should've really equipped it on Twitch.

I plan to make switch soon, I have been playing for 3 and half years now on console. Whenever I do I'm definitely buying the edition that gives all the ops because I'm not grinding out all the ops again especially since I'm familiar with all of them and love all of them expect expect one. 
---
Just wondering what rank were you averaging when you switched
---
I really want the long version of the shorty with no stock so I can be Schwarzenegger in Kindergarten Cop.
---
Ddos is the only reason I havent fully invested into ranked yet.
---
Of course
---
last tim ei checked hereford wasn't updated either. they just don't care about it anymore i think
---
Rocket launcher mounted and loaded?
---
So what's the issue then? If colourblind people get to see, what's the issue if regular players use it as well?
---
So I never thought about this but now that you mentioned it.
---
This should be normal to be in a game at today's standards.
---
Niceee love it! What's your sens at?

I genuinely would rather use an Op while meming rather than recruit, and just use an Op I never play
---
No this is better, what they really need to do is reduce the amount of maps, fortress, Hereford and skyscraper (especially skyscraper)  need to go
---
Why the hell do you always show up
---
I just came back after like a year of not playing and my aim is getting better so I‚Äôm seeing it more often it‚Äôs fresh so it still does things to me haha
---
So did you keep track or is that something you can check

Should I peek against Tachanka?
---
Yes -&gt; Peek -&gt; Die
---
No -&gt; Peek anyway
---
This is the correct answer.

Bruh this is so old
---
No, one of our guys rushed with shotty through the back. You can see his last two kills in the feed at the beginning of the video. Last one of the defenders was already committed to that ill-fated runout, I heard window breaking so he ended as a sad pinata.
---
bruh üòúüî•üî•ü§£üòÇ

Same here with world of tanks I did a lot of team damage before I found out they had a colourblind mode.
---
I'd prefer tower just outright was deleted
---
I used to think so because it was the general consensus, but once I got the Diamond skin I decided to put it on Chanka for the meme of it and when I chose to play him to see how it looked, I realized that he can be really awesome if you use him properly. I now unironically use him on Oregon, House, and Canal.

---
Change reticle ok, change hud colors (for text, friendly outlines, hit and threat indicators) ok I'm with that. 
---
Change game world items like claymores, lasers, cameras hell no.
---
Look at what they have done with new stuff tho they seam to be thinking about color blind people. Nomads knockdowns laser, camera in use indicators, all non red very contrasted colors
---
Don‚Äôt worry, the audio doesn‚Äôt really work anyways xD
---
Ah yes, I should have added shortest ranked match. I had one casual match where 4 opposing players got dropped in matchmaking so the last one said "sorry" and left.
---
I meant for enemy stuff
---
No, that's actually incorrect.
---
Nvidia Freestyle is probably your best bet for a middle ground; it's unlikely to trigger anything in games wrt anticheat, and it's very customizeable.
---

---
The price for ops is almost perfect imo, but some of the skins are ridiculously priced. The funny thing is I'd actually be inclined to spend real cash for skins if l got at least a little more value for money.
---
They don't know how to lose, so they spaz out when it happens
---
Shooting the hostage still counts as shooting a teammate.

What changed to make this reaction?

Because*, I am inevitable.*
---
Not really relevant to this but I'm curious. When console clips are posted here, 9 times out of 10 it's Xbone players. Why is there so much overrepresentation when Sony clearly "won" this generation? Is it just easier to make clips than on PS4?
---
The old lighting was so beautiful
---
Omfg thank you, you get my point.
---
HOW DARE YOU PUT MY BOY RECRUIT IN THE LOWEST TIER nah jk its called for tbh
---
There will always be someone complaining that their main isn‚Äôt in a higher tier
---
Then people would just thirst for kills and throw once they get enough. It‚Äôs a team based game, we don‚Äôt want aim bros.
---
I think ubi blocks this via ita anticheat. Cause this has been used to enhance the games for non color blind people. Such as brighten dark areas, change enemy uniforms to bright colors, and so on
---
Yessss thank you
---
I don't think the first ability should be a passive. That's basically is a big middle finger to every trap operator.
---
"just look at the game like it's a circus bro"
---
Git gud‚Ñ¢
---
I'm disagreeing with you, but you are just trolling at this point.
---
That's UbiJustin not Epi. Epi is still on the Rainbow Six team.
---
Overwatch does the same thing but with their Carin graphics it actually looks pretty nice.
---
Read the rest of the comments if you still think you should get placed on kills
---
Ok, im in the Netherlands on pc
---
His two gadgets can be useful but the irons can make it hard sometimes unless you run a shotty or a shield
---
I don‚Äôt have an issue with it. I already said that. Things can be discussed without bleeding your heart out over it. 
---
That‚Äôs the problem with politics and discussions as a general whole today.
---
Dude i know. I also play this game.
---
In the post OP said they use Nvidia's colorblind filter but that it reduces game performance
---
Damn you got downvoted, that‚Äôs tuff, maybe try to not be an asshole next time
---
That happens since 2015 when game was launched
---
yess Im kinda happy more people have the same issue!
---
was afraid it got hacked or something
---
lets just hope it will be fixed soon!

This is already common sense in the community
---
True. Plus it would get balanced out over time to have the best of both worlds

Glad they know, but it has caused me to die countless times, making it all but playable now.. Was hoping maybe a workaround or temporary fix was available. Thanks for the info!
---
it occurs with me a lot, especially in Oregon TH
---
I know I‚Äôve just never seen anyone point it out
---
What was your W/L ratio in your placements? That's the only thing that matters. It doesn't matter if you get 20 kills and no deaths. It just counts as a win.
---
Ahhh now i see
---
Aight if more people have it, its on ubis end probably so thats kinda lucky for us! Lets hope its fixed soon :)
---
Exactly. Everyone is gonna think their main is S tier.
---
It's because of some maintenance they're doing, I believe. It's pretty fucking ridiculous that it's giving everyone these kinds of messages. Creates unnecessary panic.
---
I have low Deuteranopia and I still have a hard time playing so I can slightly relate
---
Because renown takes way to long to get in this game. It‚Äôs a goddamn nightmare
---
Honestly surprised no one has asked about clash yet
---
well my playstyle depends on the situation. If I see a chance I rush in like a dumb motherfucker,but otherwise I drone before going into rooms and im patient. idk what operator will match to such a mixed playstyle lol
---
Looks like you tapped him in the shoulder and missed the head with the first burst?
---
Personally I feel that ubisoft should've given glaz a small buff like they did with lion. Such as an increase in damage from 72 to 82 while decreasing the rate of fire. Or make it so that you do more damage at a distance. They could also decrease the time needed to charge the thermal scope from 5 seconds to 3 seconds.
---
Alrighty. That leaves those fancy colorblind glasses, but that really sucks because that's only good for certain kinds of colorblind. I happen to know they're supposedly good for Deuteranopia, as that's what I have. It really is shitty but I'm kind of inclined to say that we just gotta suck it up for the most part.
---
\-sidenote, just started playing mw2 again and that doesnt even have an assist for the hud, which uses red and green.

Do you have a special pack you haven't claimed? Try scrolling right in the pack screen.

the rest of what i said is still applicable to you, it took me from silver 3 to plat so up to you to use it

Did you just ignore me mentioning the neon ones, most games don‚Äôt add the super bright ones for this reason.
---
It‚Äôs terrible
---
1. It doesnt effect you, matchmaking will usually fix the problem. It is within his right to leave if he doesn't want to play the map, it is just as on you to deal with him leaving as you think it is on him to stay in the game.
---
2. Now you're assuming things. He literally said he leaves the match when he's in one he doesn't like, what makes you think he's lying and actually stays in the match to teamkill?
---
You're just finding reasons to be angry now. Just stop.

Typical Casual***

I couldn't get passed Monty with flashbangs
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair putting her in B tbh. I think she‚Äôs better off in C, but I can see why someone would think she‚Äôs in B.
---
Cause its pratically useless, only when some teamate misscliks a knife in it
---
oo thats could be it then..
---
Yeah just make a popup that says maintenance or something, not that someone logged in elsewhere...
---
No what happend was i was arguing with this guy on another post he pissed me off because he said that you should get placed on kills alone and wouldnt take anything of what i said after i tried explaining why it was a bad idea he gave up and said im not arguing and i said lets see how other people think about this.
---
Dude I'm gonna piss in you piss hole.

Xbox one X won it back. And Xbox Live keeps winning.

Its easier to record a clip then share it to an external cloud, sony is retarded when it comes to clips.

But 5 wallbangs with rounds that explode on impact? This is absolutely madness my guy. Its the easiest bandit-trick counter in the world, its hella op my guy. 
---
A mira window? Just shot at the grund diretly behind the wall, boom Mira is dead. 
---
The idea is great, but he would be banned every single match in ranked/proleague, and would be instapicked in casual.
---
Finally another post about it!! I want to use holo and acog but i cant the red sight is so hard do see on some surfaces

#holocausted
---
More than once I have picked up barb wire because I killed the enemy who was trying to break it and placed it back down. It‚Äôs ok though. I just wanted to show some R6S logic.
---
I also have deuteranopia. Back in my call of duty days it was literally impossible for me to distinguish the differences between teammates and enemies on the minimap/hud until I found out about colorblind settings. Frankly in siege I've found that my colorblindness doesn't present as much of a disadvantage but having the ability to change outlines or names to orange or something that stands out and doesn't blend with the background could definitely help.
---
I definitely wouldn't want anything that creates some sort of advantage for any group of players but something that keeps things from blending could definitely help. I agree that in siege theres not a ton of options that could really be changed to aid colorblindness other than optics and possibly outlines. Games like call of duty really present a disadvantage when you get define the difference between friends and enemies on the minimap but siege doesn't have this problem so I'm not sure how much a colorblindness mode could really do with a colorblind mode other than possible optic changes as you said.
---
Very much agree with this. My friend is colorblind (Not sure of which kind off the top of my head) and he frequently complains about how it's hard to make things out. The only reason I can think of them not adding it is because it might give a advantage to some people but if that's the case just leave it out of ranked (Not like rank really matters)
---
You can configure the keybinds in game. You need to find the button setup you like and make it yourself. If you want a left handed profile. I made one for my dad you need to play with the buttons and hand positioning.
---
I have protanopia so R6 was a nightmare for a while in some cases. But for example, I can immediately detect some things because what you'd call red is completely black.
---
Jager you dirty liberal
---
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
man, they really did hereford dirty
---
Exactly. I panicked as well, thinking I'd been hacked.
---
how about you just see color?
---
Same here, was scared for a moment but realised I have 2FA, very unlikely for it to be a breach. So yall better get your 2FA activated!
---
that's just what I did, but some buttons are unresponsive... to make sure I even tried it on my 2nd pc and it still didn't work
---
Yes atleast make them hard to see for everybody, that way colorblind people wont be at a disadvantage. When I am clutching I fully rely on my teammates calling out any claymores in my path. Even if its in the middle of the room sitting behind a table, I would still slow walk right into it if somebody does not give me a heads-up. Running out is always a gamble too. I just pray there is no claymore or prefire with an impact nade, because there is usually no time for me to stop and thoroughly inspect a doorway for lasers because I cannot see them on the run.
---
i close the game and uplay. then restart it and login once. it says someone is logging in my ac. then i close the application and restart it. 
---
now i am ok

---
I cant play the tts.was waiting for 30 mins in queue
---
Nope it‚Äôs only normal alpha packs
---
Where is mozzie and thicclock
---
There's quite a few issues right now
---
Mav, smoke, thatcher are easily S. Too much influence on the game. Valk can also be S as long as you know ALL cam placements. She's still the most versatile Intel op who can literally only be reliably countered by IQ and IQ only, which also brings IQ to A.
---
Cav is an utter joke. Anywhere above silver, she's a joke. Her entire ability surrounds around attackers being dumb and not watching flank, and above silver, everybody watches flank. Her counter is a simple drone. She capitalises on solo queue's disadvantages of lack of coordination, and as you climb the ranks, she's useless because coordination improves. Add gridlock and nomad to the mic and you have one helluva situational op. She can dismantle a team provided the attacker is dumb enough to use loud speakers instead of a headphone.
---
Finka and jackal are B, because Finka brings no utility and has more counters than the wheels on a trailer truck, and jackal is the easiest to bait on attack that's why despite his overpicked status, he has a negative win delta. His gun doesn't help improve himself when all you can do to kill him is bait him.
---
Dok and vigil deserve A. That's enough. Dok is great, but balanced, not OP, so A is sufficient. Vigil is also great. Makes attacker Intel look like Lego toys, but he can be pinched easily if alone.
---
S is either a must pick class or highly influential class. Since nobody is a must pick in siege, we'll stick to heavy influencers. Nomad is an easy S. She has no counters except ears, and the sound can be masked easily. And takes away full 3 seconds of influence. She'll see a nerf soon.
---
Twitch and mira too are S. Nobody does Intel like Mira, and twitch has so much utility and power it's hard not to put her anywhere below S.
---
Alibi and rook can come to B. They don't really have much utility. They are frag ops. Cap can easily walk into A due to the amount of utility, versatility and fragging power that he brings. Some would argue he's an S, but as a cap main, I would keep him in A.
---
Monty is an A, since a coordinated team with a Monty can't be beaten. Castle can also coast into A. He's really, really good but a high skill cap operator, which is why he is played often in PL.
---
Kapkan and glaz are B. Kapkan is good for sound Intel, but can be taken out easily. Glaz is a high skill cap, high coordination position based op now. In a coordinated team that sets it's strats around him, he's solid.
---
Of course, these are from ranked above gold, plus some adjustments. Not PL. PL list is a whole different beast.
---
Actually the stim pistol has 100% accuracy, so you can just hipfire, and the bullet will go to the place where the crosshair is.
---
Yeah those monitors exist, some of them have several choices for color filters as far as I'm aware.
---
This is all wrong. Recruit is the best operator there is! He‚Äôs got access to all sorts of guns and gadgets! He‚Äôs the man who can do it all!
---
TIL
---
thank you government very cool
---
Breach charge not killing mozzie
---
I do it a lot as well it‚Äôs hard when there is a lot to be focusing on at once.
---
I imagine that the one guy speaking the corner knew and the rest of the team just kinda fell into it
---
Most likely by community caters, I'm really not not updated when do the qualifier take place?
---
Who needs to lean
---
&gt; Thermite has shitty guns and shitty utility
---
Uh... I'm sorry what???
---
This is why I'm mad that they made breach charges safer
---
Just like the magic pencils
---
Yeah this baffles me. My team continually bans strong operators on the side we play first. Why put yourself at a disadvantage like that, it‚Äôs beyond me
---
I'm getting this message too! wtf!?
---
im having the same issue and when i try to change the password it doesnt send me the email, im the only one with access to my account and i have 2 step
---
Theres not a single game out there that will give u an advantage for putting colorblind mode on for non colorblind people. In league of legends people use colorblind mode to make ur health bar yellow instead of green, it just looks significantly better then the green one.
---
Hibana and Nomad for attack. Maestro and Mira for defense.
---
I‚Äôm replacing meastro with possibly kaid or kapkan which would you recommend 
---
Also I‚Äôm keeping mozzie. Because you brought up some great points
---
No clue who made it
---
I was thinking I should cut it down, but the tk seemed nice to include
---
500 I think
---
same here then aftee like 15mins i can logg
---
Rook, Maestro, Gridlock, Fuze, and Mira. They are beefy ops with useful abilitys.
---
Its just white though..
---
Same message here... Ubi fucked something up again I think. So just wait...
---
You can check esl page for the qualifiers there may be a stream listed but I don‚Äôt think the official r6 twitch will be streaming it
---
The game has so many problems already. I hope colorblind mode gets implemented as you wish, though I doubt it is going to be anytime soon.
---
I bEt YoUrE wOnDeRiNg, WhAtS iN tHe CaNiStEr? I‚Äôd TeLl YoU, bUt ThEn I‚Äôd HaVe To KiLl YoU
---
That was changed *ages* before Kapkan wasnt OHK anymore
---
Then you have bought a basic version at time when you still had to buy them, just play 2 games and you will most likely to have 500 already üëçüèª
---
I think the best Mira setups require a decent bit of map knowledge but I kinda think it‚Äôs not awful to kinda make up a setup as you go as long as you understand the pros and cons of placing the mirror somewhere. Like does this help me? If the glass gets knocked out, will it screw my team? That kinda stuff.
---
Liquipedia says that the 4 major regions start on 2019-07-10
---
Fully agree
---
I started using hibana and bandit, and their guns are actually very good, and so are their abilities.
---
Depends. Soft breaching would be Sledge and Buck, Hard breaching is Thermite and Hibana.
---
I don't even have tritanopia but I always put it on in FPS.
---
My friend was facing the same issue. He tried launching the game directly from uPlay instead of steam and it worked for him
---
I feel that twitch shouldn‚Äôt be recommended for new players unless they‚Äôre coming from games where you need to control recoil
---
Thx dawg
---
Well, I certainly would feel better about myself knowing that this is mnk, so I don‚Äôt mind agreeing with you lol either way it was a nice *and* lucky shot.
---
Seems to be happening to a lot of us. It will probably be fixed soon.
---
Cav S tier? I can only dream.....

Hello ralphriley18, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/c7vvgg/a_glitch_made_for_an_interesting_zoom_in_on_casual/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
The way Ubi does it right now (solely on W/L) is the best option.
---
If you introduce other factors, you create situations where players are rewarded for things that hurt their team.  An obvious example related to using points is that spotting with a camera gains you points but often gets the camera destroyed.  Calling out the location instead of spotting keeps the cam alive (benefiting the team) but doesn't gain points.  There are similar examples with kills.
---
Besides avoiding perverse incentives, using wins alone allows Ubi to include all the actions that aren't counted that help the team win/lose in their calcualations.  Any metric you use (points, kills, KOST, rating system like SiegeGG) is going to miss some things that help your team win--like cover fire that allows a teammate to plant/disable or making good callouts.  But over time those positive actions add up to more rounds and matches won.
---
Weird
---
You should do one for maverick
---
Don‚Äôt worry, Ubi is fixing the issue

15x zoom scope for all and i mean ALL guns [for a limited time event maybe]

Can i ask u if u have the other problem that says‚Äù The section cannot be reached at the moment sorry for the inconvenience‚Äù

I‚Äôve tried, but since you asked nicely :)

Fortnite has several modes for all different kinds of colorblindness. I found it the other day and was rather impressed at the fact that they had so many different options.

---
&gt;Hello.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;We know that this is not the first time this request has been made, and we've shared before as well that a colorblind option is something we want to look into for the future. While we don't have any information to share with you all right now on this front, we're not unaware of the struggles you're facing and we most certainly want to make rainbow as comfortable and enjoyable for everyone as possible. I do also respect your persistence in championing your cause - so just want to reassure you and let you know that we hear you.
---
How much of a priority is this issue?
---
How far in the future is this subject going to be discussed, because you said you want to "look at it"?
---
What are current, if any limitations for this accessibility option being released?
---
Thanks for all the work you guys do, I just feel as a Ubisoft community member for the past 10 years a bit more transparency is deserved rather than, "We've given this messaging before, we will look into it, empathy statement."
---
It takes 3-4 weeks to get a full outfit for one op. I don't have that many hours in a day.
---
yep, it's fixed now though and i can login just fine
---
Go play something like Rust, you'll come crawling back.
---
no
---
I love playing Grayscale 6
---
Weird, I have a 6600K and 2060 and I play on 1080p, all low, shadows medium, taa off
---
I get around 150-220 FPS in multiplayer, the avg is about 170
---
Could you run userbenchmark and post the link?
---
As someone who is colorblind r6 is actually the one game that I don‚Äôt really notice
---
The real solution is to disallow server hopping at all. Always have the game auto-connect to the closed server (based on latency). Just ignore any lines in any config about this.
---
The real thing that needs  to happen in ranked is that if people with a large gap between each others ranks queue together, they queue against the highest rank in their squad. No more easy games for Plats who queue with Coppers. 4 Bronzes and 1 Gold in a squad? The queue matches them with Golds. 
---
Or maybe just disallow those squads to go ranked. They can go casual, custom or THunt, but for ranked it could say stuff like "The people in your squad are too far apart in ranks, so you cannot rank together".
---
F#&amp;k them
---
I wish this still did a lot of damage. Sometimes i stare at a door I see Monty near to get him to back away without going thu the trap. Then I‚Äôll set a nitro at the top of the doorway and whenever I get my trap points I immediately hit nitro unless I directly saw another trap go off

Very nice to see the UDT SEAL as one of the operators. As a Korean myself, to see the 707th SMB in a game was very pleasing indeed, but now what you have there is awesome :)
---
Seems to be some problem with the backround where there is bits of white next to him. Otherwise really nice :D
---
Confusion ensues
---
It's not generally a problem for me.  I know the common spots well enough to avoid them (mostly).  Overall, I kill more spawn peekers than I get killed by.  There are a few sites where runouts are rare enough but you are exposed to them (Valley on Border, for example) that are a problem, but even then they can be avoided if you know the other team is likely to do them.
---
I just don't think it's good for the game.  You should be able to spawn in move out of that area safely particularly in a game where the cost to dying early is so high.  That doesn't mean you should be safe to approach the building, just spawn.  More importantly, what distinguishes Siege from games like COD is the importance that strategy and teamwork play and how much less important quick twitch aim is.  Constant runouts and spawn peeks largely remove that strategy from the game.  It becomes all about which player can hit the other's head (or body several times) first.  And if I wanted that experience there are plenty of other games that offer it (and do it better).

I agree. I cant confirm but i might have Deuteranope. Thwy should add this as in every game i play with colourblind options i always use Deuteranope as it helps me see which colours which.

I'm a Lesion main, what do you think I'll say? In all seriousness, though, the uniform is pretty cool. The gadget/weapon skins could use some work. Everyone is saying the MVP is bad, but I like it. It's still good compared to *some elites in particular* (Ash, i'm looking at you.)

At that point it's not about killing the drone, it's about making a statement.

The scorpion carbine is the worst gun in game. Not only is its max damage poor at a max of 23. Its fall off range damage is even more pathetic at 15. The fall off range is quite bad at 18m. On top of this the weapons recoil horizontally is random, which no other gun is. Random in a game calling itself competitive is quite bullshit don't you think?
---
Her pistol is also very underpar. It does the lowest damage of any pistol in game. Its fall off range like the Scorpion is also very shit.
---
Her secondary gadgets are literally useless. As they're meant for anchoring play for the most part, Yet Ela's a roamer. The most Ela can do with a shield and barbed wire is help your friendly Frost. But in the end that's not helping you which they're supposed to do.
---
Her mines are lackluster at best. They aren't lethal, plentiful, they're easy to see and don't come with markers above them. They're okay at the end of rounds when less players are on the map but when they usually go off it's the beginning. When every attacker has a pal not far behind em. Not like it'll bother them. They don't need to actively get rid of the mines affect, and the effects only last 5 seconds on the usual.
---
Compared to everyone else in game. Ela is the weakest roamer. I piss poor info gatherer. A horrible trapper. Anchoring is just pointless with any 3 speed who isn't Jager or Bandit. All she can do is kill with her shotgun. Something that shouldn't be the reason an operator is chosen. They should be chosen for their entire kit, not the only good thing left of it which is her shotgun. So yes she is pretty weak, one of the most weak in game. As well as one of the most useless for a team.
---
I main Ela yes, but she's the one of the worst operators in game. Pick lesion.
---
So it's hurts every game of ranked ever
---
Contact ubi support

Maybe it‚Äôs because shotguns don‚Äôt have headshot multipliers?

That would literally make everyone happy.

Same. It's almost 6 hours now.

LOL... a 4 years old game looking "into the future" to establish accessibility options for disabled gamers when that simple fix is already an industry standard. That's the most Ubisoft thing.

Because people brought back up by finka stand back up quicker than shit. She already lowers everyone‚Äôs recoil to almost nothing, gives a health boost, makes moving through razor wire not slow you down, revives teammates. What more do you want? Lol

Already checked in game and headset works fine

Iv had a guy tk me because i use pistol smg on mute vs shotty smg.  Im a heretic i know
---
The real question does it shoot legos, good job btw
---
No. I mean the fast kick just when the load starts. No time at all to load the player, just kicked and thw worst is that the rest sometimes has to wait for that person to be kicked back to lobby so in the end it was all in vain and we end up waiting even more

I suggest looking into a program or a monitor that you can change the color settings with.

Even being able to change the color of an optic would make a massive difference

I want a Lord Tachanka elite

It usually happens when everyone is finished loading but since someone joined they had to wait even more

pulse, the ump literally has no recoil. tho you have to make due with its subpar stats.

Oh that load, oh yeah well fuck that I'm not waiting 3 mins on someone to load his game

I think they took it too far, bcos now if you move a tiny bit you lose all visibility. I understand why they needed to do this but he's almost unplayable now.

I played with a guy who was recruit only in ranked this weekend.  He bought a new copy of the base game so he had no Ops unlocked. Then only played recruit till whenever ranked is unlocked so he was forced to take recruit in ranked.

That's not true, and should still be up to the player to make the sacrifice. Division 2 even added it. Most games do, and the main reason I haven't purchased the game. 60 FOV is inexcusable for a FPS. The game should have been built around a better FOV to begin with. I'm pretty sure Seige runs unlocked Framerate and over 60fps on Xbox one x so what peformace dip?

The fuck would I want to send a snap with this

Yeah true. Now that I see it that way ima probably just play ranked

Thanks for that big reply. From what i've noticed for playing rainbow6 for 6 hours straight is that this game isn't that complicated after all.

To me, why would they want to give the rights out for a purpose that doesn‚Äôt seem to directly affect their sales? Ya figure that most of siege players, while they do probably shoot steel or own a firearm there might not be a clear correlation between the two so it may not seem worthwhile to hand over the rights.

This is a hard one for me. I think they‚Äôre both great ops. I use Ying more, but I‚Äôd say Maverick is the better pick. He‚Äôs not situational, has some great guns, is super quiet (seriously I swear Maverick‚Äôs footsteps are literally softer than other ops) and is fun to play. 
---
Ying is great for a few reasons: she‚Äôs got an SMG with an 80 round drum mag. She‚Äôs really good for rushing. She can recover the diffuser very effectively by flashing the room and snatching it up. But she doesn‚Äôt have the utility that Maverick has, and so ultimately you should buy him.
---
A map made for COOP/Single player =/= a map made for PVP or Competitive play. Ubisoft didn't consider this and released the map as is and it was an awful experience. The map simply isn't good, and didn't belong in PVP the way it was.
---
Alright
---
How do I edit post?
---
its Ubisoft. when have they ever done anything in a timely manner for this game.
---
it took 3 years for ranked.  maybe well see clash back before 2020.
---
You know I don't speak Spanish.
---
Well clearly rook buffed the helmets
---
I been playing since launch day. This game has changed so much.
---
The map was made for PvE, so it had poor aproaches and a single door when you try to adapt it to PvP. Also, being a school, it wouldnt take long 'til Ubi gets negative press for it.
---
Well. Ummm. Well...
---
Don't do this with people who don't main Blitz.

A defender that can secure themselves to the ceiling twice a round. You would be able to grapple up to exactly where you aim, but cannot move from that point without releasing your ability, and must be stuck viewing upside down. I think it would add a unique gameplay mechanic so people would have to check ceilings and certain maps like New Kafe would be great for it.

Reporting a player doesnt help allow the support team track down who DDoSed their servers unless the dude typed it in chat saying he will DDoS you using X botnet at X:xx time. 
---
people dont use their personal devices to DDoS servers, these are 3rd party paid services that are anonymous. 
---
&gt;I'm not able to understand how they can DDos a server based game, 
---
Thats the only type of game you can  Please put more efforts into fixing the problem. I'm sure you will be more focused on a PC fix before console players like myself, 
---
This is also a PC problem. Also the only reason it looks like PC gets special treatment is because its a lot easier to patch things on PC. These patches also get to the console version of the game a bit later unless its a pc only issue.
---
&gt;Suggestion for escalation team for reports - If 1 Siege player is DDosing and gets reported
---
Doest matter, Its next to impossible to connect a random player online with a DDoS attack cause its technically not even them doing the attack. Its paid botnet services.
---
Sorry all, just trying to help but I deleted how to preform the glitch and have attempted to reach out to Ubisoft support directly to report the issue.
---
yeah him getting banned is why I started playing finka in ranked
---
I play console, see it every day
---
Ik but there would be a downside to it like health loss or shield goes down making you vulnerable
---
Mav is good for making assholes in a wall to get a sneaky pick on someone. Lion is good to keep someone from killing u/ur teammates while planting. Finka is nice cuz of the little boost she gives to people but isn't really game changing
---
Right, but the game can‚Äôt tell the difference, if you‚Äôre out the game and the game ends then you get this hours ban, doesn‚Äôt matter if you are out intentionally or not because the game can‚Äôt tell them apart, your idea is good for those who leave on purpose but it has too much collateral damage for those who are made to leave unintentionally.
---
So now anytime you accidentally shoot a teammate they take damage? Just as bullshit lol. 
---
When I'm playing with friends and I accidentally kill one I tell them to turn on reverse friendly fire. That way if I mess up again I'm the one punished. Seems fair to me.
---
That would be so hard for them to do
---
It is not a pc problem, it is horrendously rampant on PS4

It happens about 50% of ranked games
---
Wow thank you! Now I fee like an idiot for playing this game for three years and never noticing that.
---
Inhuman reactions
---
lmao my core i5 is physically 4 cores. go back to school kids
---
That wasnt for spawnpeeking, ubisoft has no issues with spawnpeeking. 
---
Its was because they were 3 speed operators with good guns and also good equipment.
---
They used their equipment and them run all around the map taking on attackers long range and then rotation around due to their speed. Thats why only 1 speeds can have acogs now defense.
---
How tf did he hit you? Is the accuracy that bad?

Right? And I don‚Äôt know anything about game development to be fair, but I feel like transferring an assassination animation from AC into siege probably isn‚Äôt impossible. A hidden blade assassination as a replacement for the normal interrogation would be a dope version of a cosmetic change like the other Elites have.

Imagine Jager squeezes the face wash on your face and says "you should not worry about the acne now."

Est-ce que t'as oubli√© la vid√©o ?

You're telling me 6hs after my 5 stack from different ISPs lagged out from our rank lobby that DDoSing is not a PC problem? 
---
DDoSing started off as a PC problem
---
You have a great point but I‚Äôm just fucking triggered that all teammates I get are little kids who decide we lost one round and they decide let me fucking leave this shitty ass game since we lost one motherfucking round
---
How about everyone after Operation Skull Rain?
---
Lmao could you image two/two blitz‚Äôs fucking kool-aid maning it through a wall? I would shit myself.
---
What are you on about? You said it wasn‚Äôt a console problem, I‚Äôm pointing out it is. Re-read what you said bud

Lion is total ass, he doesnt get good until you have high plat or diamond/pro players using him. Blackbeard is also useless in copper and bronze cuz nobody down there can hit headshots. BB gets really good in silver and gold, then weaker in plat, then better in diamond/pro. You see, operator's abilities and weapons are useless unless you know how to use their gadgets, so an operator's skill is determined by the people playing that operator

Why would you ever want crossolay on siege?
---
You can lean left on console, as far as you know he was being sarcastic
---
&gt; I Meant that DDoSing on PC isn't even an issue
---
Then just say that instead of typing ambiguous claims like "it isn't a thing". Obviously it is otherwise we wouldn't have prominent community figures like Macie, George and Pengu speaking out about it, nevermind their numerous rants about how toxic the community is. No offense but I'm going to trust the word of a diamond player that has several thousands of hours in this game over a random armchair server expert on reddit lol.

&gt; You're putting words in my mouth, and saying absolutely borderline retarded shit like
---
You don't really need any help saying retarded shit right now.

Wasn't he nerfed not so long ago?
---
On console people get the IPs for individual players off the party system for voice coms. Thats a console issue.
---
The server DDOS is attacking directly to the server which is a hard thing to stop when you dont manage the servers.

Is that a Mother Fuckin Jojo's Reference

It's so uncommon to run out of ammo and 20 damage is waaaaaay too much.
---
This shouldn't be in the game.
---
How did he kill him? Wut...
---
He was on mouse and keyboard and the only way to lean on console is by adsing and clicking left or right stick
---
needs to be fixed
---
console Beaulo, change my mind
---
‚ÄúHe then proceeds to lean left‚Äù nothing sus about that
---
Lol yuh ik
---
Do you even play console?
---
That's basicly what my third idea would be. Basicly remove the turret all together and give him the backpack o'bullets and the Russian LMG as basicly a third weapon then when he switches he gets a movement penelty for having the LMG out
---
You mean 6k?
