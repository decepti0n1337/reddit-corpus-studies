---
Her trax deployment is extremely slow and you can just shoot out the canister. 
---

---
If its a faster deployment sure but atm she doesnt really need a nerf.
---
Also I just read your username and I think you're better off spending your time in r/legaladvice
---
I know that not everyone is a one man army but in a game all about fairness why not at least give a slight advantage to help?  How do you think it would add frustration in your opinion?
---
Never use all of your zaps at once
---
Never said it was a clutch, I was more like "Holy shit, I killed four of the team at 1hp"
---
R6 PC community
---
So f it then just make it easy for them?
---
Is your ping 100? Because that means you‚Äôre going to lag. The most right column and the ms rate is your ping not internet connection.

It's a pleasure and well done on your Bandit one as well :)
---
Because some people can't clutch for the life of them (I'm one of them) and having extra can sometimes be like a kick to the teeth. As its like "I had more health than them and yet I still couldn't clutch it" if you get my point?
---
And where is that shown?
---
What reason do you have for spelling shield wrong on purpose; besides stupidity.
---
Hardware bans are already in place? I looked for a source on that but couldn't find any.
---
Like most people said, it‚Äôs Sony and Microsoft‚Äôs issue to deal with. From personal experience, it‚Äôs actually really hard to tell if someone is playing with a mouse and keyboard. One of my best friends I play siege with consistently looks like he‚Äôs playing with mouse and keyboard, and has been accused of such, but I know he isn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs too broke to get an adapter. Ubisoft could very well be working on this, but it‚Äôs never gonna be 100% accurate. Yes, Sony and Microsoft should be putting in something to detect adapters but that still could be flawed. I know it‚Äôs frustrating to play with cheaters. I really wish there was a quick and simple solution but there probably isn‚Äôt.
---
I edited it before but u answered but u prob didn‚Äôt see not ur fault but u could of said 4 man at 1hp
---
U do realize that Ubisoft has nothing to do with this issue?
---
Why? Capitao bypasses ADS with his area denying fire bolts AND smokes, plus he can even burn them with his stuns too. Gridlock does almost the same thing as his bolt caster in throwable form, but as a 1 speed without the third gadget utility. She seriously doesn't need any form of nerf, and it's not like Cap is amazing himself either.
---
Touch√©
---
Chill, it's just a joke üòî
---
Plus someone else killed a guy so it would be a 3 man I might be wrong
---
I killed four :P
---
Your nuts ü§©
---
Asian stuff is weird
---
Instead of using a weapon he just punches all of the enemy team.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm special I saw the killfeed and I thought someone else killed that guy my b but still impressive
---
Shields in general are buggy/glitchy
---
r/hmmm
---
It's all good. Tyty!
---
Once i read get paid i assumed it was fake
---
oh
---
I think the drone save your life.
---
Thats why I came here tbh

I may be sketchy but I'm a minor myself homie

Imagine being a diamond and like getting happy cuz you beat silver and golds lol pick on somebody your own rank

*INSERT ZOFIA LMG-E*
---
Is this legal?!?!?!
---
Bahahaha well in that case I'm off to the expense factory
---
This would be a cool feature to add to siege. All tho I could see it having some sort of game breaking glitch like everything Ubisoft adds to siege but when they iron out the flaws it could make for a cool mechanic if added
---
1. Pulse on the side of Thermite and Montagne
---
2. Pulse using the M870
---
3. Montagne using a Desert Eagle 
---
4. Pulse has a Revolver in his sidearm holster
---
5. Barbed wire outside
---
What did I miss?
---
I know how you feel. I'm currently sitting at silver 3, working my way up. I haven't been ddosed yet mainly cause its uncommon for consol. Luckily hackers get punished but so do other players who are unaware that a hacker was one their team with is very unfortunate and unfair.
---
On ps4 right now, got ddosed 4 times, in one day. Every match I was going to win and I was only 3 matches away from diamond. my first diamond ranking that I did by myself. I'm pissed at the game now.
---
I don‚Äôt understand?
---
Gotta say that was beautifully played. I never thought to spam extend/de-extend to confuse the enemy as to whether I am extended or not and I had already accepted that if they were close enough they would hear me de-extend and know it was time to shoot. Pretty smart honestly. Good play my guy. Lmao I'm gonna use it on my nay-saying friends later to meme them.
---
Because of a higher fov. It just looks smaller. So do the players. It's the same.
---
Because the r6 community is very toxic and it‚Äôs a constant dick measuring contest. Pc isn‚Äôt as bad but on console, at least on Xbox it‚Äôs a whole different toxic beast
---
more you play, the less you get, also depends on your teams total mmr, vs the enemies if it's more or less.
---
kills/deaths don't matter, winning/losing does
---
not even close to the worst... at least its a gun that is user
---
to me its terrible, looks way too similar to his default gun, i feel like they might as well add common skins to legendary alpha packs
---
Honestly, I feel like shields have gotten more manageable on console. Maybe i've just gotten better? They're all annoying, but with a coordinated team they can get smoked pretty fast. The biggest issue I see with blitz is players panicking. 
---
I still absolutely loathe clash though.
---
Omg I love smurfing in the newcomer playlist it is so much fun giving new players the reality of siege early. Just doing my part is all, I don‚Äôt think it makes me a cuck
---
the shot after i hit his shoulder hit his head and you can see the blood come out of his head
---
Autism is not retarded.  When they say it , they are pissed at your methods.
---
It tracks where ever the mouse would be on the screen
---
This doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with ubi. That guys internet is just fucked
---
I wouldn't say that's ubisoft's fault. That players internet just wasn't that good at that moment
---
I'm sorry to hear bro. Hopefully you hit diamond soon. I haven't gotten past silver 2 yet mainly cause of lack of communication with the team. I'm on ps4 as well
---
The reflection in the wall says the doors are open but they are barricaded
---
yes, but it's a gun that people use, even a gun that is the most used for that operator, much better than say a skin for docs shotgun or jackals pistol
---
ping is not an issue like how it was before. it's fine. you are more of the problem than ubisoft is
---
Attck
---
I just thought of the aprils fools event the entire time
---
sure those aren't your teammates bullets?
---
Lion will never be perfect. The fact that an operator that gives wallhacks in itself is overpowered in the fast-paced game that siege is, and it will either be nerfed to shit or be overpowered, and being nerfed to shit is much better for the game.
---
Grenades, smg, shotty
---
Thiq
---
it doesn't. welcome to the game.
---
But what would castle do on attack? Or thermite on defense? However I think an idea like that would be cool but it would have to be really different, and you should have a reason  to use both offensive and defensive abilities.
---
so play with a team if you're really tired of it. or casual
---
Not sure what you mean?
---
It just happened to me 2 more times today, we get close to winning and then everyones kicked. It‚Äôs so frustrating
---
Unplayable Ubisoft this need fixing!
---
The title is a life of an IQ main
---
Half the people who play this game are just ass holes
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
Play ranked
---
Ive been attempting to do that over the past week, thanks for suggestion
---
Oooh Okay... Good job ubi
---
Yeah when you are against the ninja pirate !
---
U in casual right?
---
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not ubis fault‚Äù ofc it is, nobody should be able to stay in the match with even more than 1k ping
---
Luckily you only have 3 operators. If I were you I would go to the operators' page and click on each operator and look at their uniforms. I'm pretty sure you got Ash's black viper because everyone gets that legendary
---
Agreed, his is good now
---
Really good book. Bought a copy for my grandfather too.
---
He probably means turn casual into ranked so they play identically, but with hidden MMR being the sole differentiator.
---
‚Äúto play in this arena, you need the brains‚Äù I like he says that because you need to work with the map using your brain to fight the opposing enemies. Perfect quote to help you win in Siege!
---
Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to get my ass stomped yet. Then again, it‚Äôd be nice to play a full game for once.
---
Im not sure either what the fuck is he talking about
---
How doesn‚Äôt it? XIM isn‚Äôt an officially supported accessory.
---
Looks like crap
---
What the hell did I just watch!?  That was awesome and stupid at the same time. Idris Elba being a BAMF and all the operators being... stupid, lol. Like, they're using their gadgets but really stupidly. Plus they don't hit anything??
---
Pulse sitting on a toilet, Sledge going like an animal, that internal wall killhole by Ashe...
---
And the bathmat siege charge??
---
Jesus that zoom
---
I would be soo fucking mad

What do you mean by se1-4? Season 1, year 4? season 4, year 1?
---
It‚Äôs not a hacker, you type tttttttttt a certain amount of times, then [ALL] personsname: toxic thing
---
I know it used to be a thing, but it never actually worked. And some people don't want to learn all the maps.
---
But then it reduces the skill level, and it ends up like csgo where people are grand masters on one map but then play like copper on every other map
---
Let us know how the book is
---
went to see the hammer time, stayed for the castle crasher ninja pirates song.
---
I mean, we have Castle... and there was a lack of Castle in the ad...
---
ubi doesn't care about casual &amp; neither should you lol, if you wanna care about anything care about ranked or ESL/GO4s
---
You could‚Äôve just used the c4, but i suppose the flex was necessary.
---
maybe find it again, i dont think this has ever been done
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a system that punishes legit players tbh
---
You shot him so hard that you hurt him irl
---
New favorite move
---
How is a hologram made by a little device the size of a softball that folds out and is not only able to project a realistic image but locate the source of the shot realistic? How is a device that's able to shoot lasers that actually do physical harm without having a car battery realistic? Hell, how is a drone that can make trax stingers from basically nothing realistic? I love siege so much, but saying all the gadgets "are based on real life" is just pushing it too far.
---
Or... drone hole...
---
Better get him that rundown
---
Dope
---
This is brilliant
---
Aww that‚Äôs hot, that‚Äôs real hot.
---
So why do Pulse and Monty have the wrong guns?
---
I‚Äôve read it before, it‚Äôs ok in my opinion.
---
I think tachanka's ability should just be whipping out the LMG as an extra weapon. He keeps his primaries and secondaries and has access to a third weapon. He'll be a one man armory.
---
Once baited a caviera by switching to my underbarrel shotgun ( I was buck). Worked cuz it sounded like going on a drone
---
Lol go uncapped frames, thank me later
---
More fps means that you can see more of what's going on so you have a chance to react. If person A peeks person B  with a higher frame rate then person A will technically see them first(assuming similar levels of ping)
---
I mean, if you gonna take aim, i‚Äôm not so good in English, so sorry:D
---
I‚Äôm buying
---
Too much assistant.
---
You have to unlock all operators unless it came with dlc
---
No, they changed the system back to the old unlock system. 
---
New players need to unlock the base operators now (500-1000-1500-2000 renown) 
---
But they removed the starter edition on pc and reduced the standard edition a bit to compensate the buy operators requirement. 
---
Also the DLC operators now have discounts added according to when they were released.
---
Not if Player B has a higher refresh rate monitor and player A is playing using a 60hz monitor.  Also depends on which player has a lower input lag on the monitor, the players ping/ network connection stability etc.. 
---
Also your explanation is more inline with peekers advantage not FPS.
---
They're not op, that's how shotguns are.
---
Correct.
---
Things that are not in the game:
---
- sliding
---
- sledging through a non-hatch floor/ceiling 
---
- Pulse's scanner is not x-ray vision
---
I'm playing on ps4 too, and while it does happen, it's not so often as to "ruin casual" for me.
---
if you have a 144hz monitor
---
Did Ubi really did this ad?
---
I always thought this was some kind of a Fan made one. But, also it is so unbelievable as a Fan art.
---
probably
---
Not necessarily, it could be that the mouse tracking software isn't as meticulous.
---
Idris Even [raps!](https://youtu.be/huaE85-V8u4&amp;t=2m18s)
---
Kill them with a flamethrower. Unless it is, and take my word on it, an MP7, a shotgun, AN ARX200, there is **NO** reason to use iron sights unless you desperately want to be a liability and make your life harder. Especially when defense has ACOGs on 5 ops now, and one of those dudes has 2 ACOGs, it doesn't make sense putting yourself at such a huge disadvantage.

Damn, wish I was there for that. I only joined in blood orchid.
---
thx!
---
Its the default headgear and it does look aweful
---
Where he got 10 kills when its 0-0?
---
I dont think that is fair :\\
---
For me it's to the point where i gotta really try to convince itself it'll be fun. Either that or I'll go right back to either Solo queuing ranked or wait for friends.
---
If Idris Elba played the game today he would be called an n-word
---
trying to play a 1v5 clutch after everyone in your team leaves because they are too pussy to accept the fact that they were killed

I'm crying

Took me about 900hours to unlock all base and DLc Operators at Wind Bastion
---
No no pulse is my attack main I love using m870
---
Youch
---
Why do you think they changed it? Hell lighting way less extreme has already been an issue in the current version.
---
Oh so that‚Äôs why you guys cheat.....So you can be famous.
---
There‚Äôs a guide somewhere that tells what came with each patch
---
That smoke is dumb...
---
Before the game hit mainstream
---
Makes me wanna play seige again. In fact I might right now.
---
Siege considers it cheating! if we had a decent report and review system where Ubi review and ban people, they will start thinking twice before using M&amp;K
---
Really wish I cud see that on my TV
---
I've actually thought about it for a while, what would happen if I just randomly started playing with people who added me. What if one of them turns out to be cheating, wouldn't I then be banned for trusting someone I didn't know in real life.
---
The point is, i never used cheats
---
Would habe been too stupid cause i payed to much there.
---
Thats actually how it happened to me
---
It says you‚Äôre boosting. Not using cheats.
---
Almost every headset is an officially licensed product, and "sound whoring" takes a certain amount of skill and game time to learn. Buying a 3rd party adapter that is not officially licensed that allows you to quantitatively increase skill with little to no effort other than time is cheating.
---
She could maybe benefit from actually healing instead of just temporary health
---
Why do people still fucking comment this
---
F in the chat for this games trailer...
---
It is on pc as well.
---
All shields are just incredibly buggy right now
---
Yeah it can sense how far you press down the key and then input it like a controller (as in higher pressure = faster movement)
---
Xbox rainbow six on casual is generally dead across all servers
---
If you like it, you'll regret it if you don't get it before it disappears.
---
My game has this same issue. I can only play multiplayer if someone else is leader. I tried everything ubispft suggested to me and nothing worked. I submitted a ticket also and I havent gotten a reply.
---
That‚Äôs practical, not a much as it sounds like prolly
---
Google is your friend
---
It justs sucks when you get the craving i do play ranked but i start off with cas as a warm up
---
I am on weu servers and have played with bros from New York. Usually get a ping between 80 and 110
---
Hey fuck you
---
Blitz shield has "L√§cheln" (German for "smile") drawn on it
---
You're thinking of TrueSkill. Siege is a "team game" but the individual has the chance to completely ruin or save a game nearly completely independent of a team's input. I would consider games without both teams having at least 4 players together as a completely incomparable field to be judged upon by the system in place.
---
If you demonstrate the fact that you are very capable as a player, being sagged down by someone else is unfair. Much the same that, even without smurfing, someone can go on a complete rampage and save that 0-1-3 Mute's ELO while he gets shot looking at cameras on top of his jammer. There's nothing "wrong" with wanting to look at the entire team, but there's nothing fair about being held to the same standard as someone who is visibly struggling to be as competitive as the enemy team's worst player.
---
A person shouldn't be considered "with their peers" if someone else's failure or triumph pitches them the wrong way. There doesn't have to be a compromise of "Team Judgement" and "Individual Judgement." Calling it "too complex" and writing scenarios to nip it in the bud are lazy and not what players deserve to have happen. Effort should be put in to make sure the game is done right.
---
It Siege is one of the only game that kept his promises. Or at least a good part of them
---
Cap and ying have lower win deltas, and all of them have a decent win delta. All three are right around -1%. That is totally acceptable
---
sorry about ruining the video games bud
---
Felt cute, might wallbang pulse later.
---
Why would you boost and stop at plat 3?
---
kinda sad that her ability didnt get much attention...
---
R63 but online Vegas 1
---
It‚Äôs nothing ubi can fix because it‚Äôs an internal console mechanic
---
yeah, i still play her a lot. she‚Äôs one of the best supports in my books
---
I know that they remove the game. But you were saying that it only removes elo and doesn‚Äôt give you any, which is untrue.
---
thats gonna be a down side for it but i think they can start looking into people when they reach a certain threshold of reports + video evidence! 
---
Yes that means someone has to look those up but lets be real here, Siege is making a shit ton of money for Ubi and the M&amp;K is mainly an issue on Plat1 / Diamond level, don't see it being a bad thing to  invest some man power and money to keep it healthy.
---
Nothing against you at all, but I‚Äôm very surprised that at your level you‚Äôve never seen a yokai plant deny
---
There was hentai dj with fuze and ak12
---
But I think easier is smarter
---
How would it be patched without reworking Cap again?
---
''Enemy AC-130 above!''
---
It‚Äôs not that new it‚Äôs been around about a year
---
Wow that's the first time I've seen someone admit the game isn't perfect on here.
---
Used to be a console gamer, you don't own these games because they are locked away once your subscription ends. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Shocked? Hmmm i get it you're a twitch main.
---
Welcome to the most toxic game of our years
---
Well, they do, but i'm not switching to PC you can't convince me :-P
---
Charels Minor?
---
You sound like an absolute whiny pussy. Did you type this on the school bus?
---
I have a mic, i never use it in game since there's no real point anymore. Even if you have the slightest chance of finding a team with mics they're either going to be total cunts or just be annoying as hell.
---
lol
---
Anything with Idris Elba is badass
---
No on the couch buddy. Also youre the one calling people shit at the game without knowing anything about them. And when you're likely the one who is shit at the game and acting like a total jackass id recommend you keep your mouth quiet.
---
3 years of my life and I‚Äôm just now playing ranked more consistently and I didn‚Äôt realize high ranks are really rude
---
I used to have them before the latest update. Mainly because I own a mid tier pc that can only handle rainbow on low everything
---
No, it's probably I wifi issue or someone using a lag switch.
---
I don't get why people blame the game 100% of the time when they have a high ping. The others don't. Did you think that it may be something related to your connection or your ISP?
---
See if you have the latest drivers for your gpu
---
Back when siege was good.
---
That's the siege community for you. Total asses wherever you go. And whenever you complain about a problem they get even worse
---
CAN cause screen tearing, personally I've never had the issue.
---
I run a wired connection with a consistent 9ms ping so its def not that, and forgive my lack of knowledge on the subject but i thought lag switches only worked on p2p multiplayer not dedicated servers.
---
just checked, i do
---
I‚Äôve seen allot of people change crouch to space bar. Must be good. I‚Äôll try it. 
---
What made you change from the normal aim ?
---
It's way weaker than Jackal
---
Will this fix the constant Cheaters/DDosers that are destroying Diamond NA?
---
i thought that it will be hard for me to adjust but got plat straight away lol
---
do you play solo or with friends?
---
Me screwing this finka and thermite
---
The Commando 9 AR thingie, it may lack in SKRRRRRA but makes it up with accuracy and recoil control
---
It's juat a bad skin for a bad gun...
---
yea i‚Äôd say he is only still good when the defused is down or the team is securing
---
The oldest trick in the book
---
All of these suggestions are shit. Want to improve Seige for real then UBI really just needs to do three things: prevent matchmaking with players that you've previously reported, allow people to back out of ranked matches and have MM find a replacement player before the start of the first round in a ranked match,  and lastly go back to when everything in game could be purchased with reknown and go back to giving enough reknown so that it took two gaming sessions at the most to earn enough reknown to unlock any single in the game. The Alpha pack system is hot garbage tbh. I'm going to assume that you've never bought a Season Pass for this game, or you would know that the season passes included special charms and skins.

---
I'll add you when I get home
---
All they would have to do is let people opt out of a few bad maps when queuing for ranked or casual. Maybe in Casual you can opt out of 5 maps, and in ranked you can opt out of three. 
---
Honestly though, as long as they didn't keep adding really ad maps in the game, it wouldn't be a problem.
---
I believe they are actually mouse clicks for longer than 2 seconds
---
From apex reddit huh?
---
This is exactly what I think
---
its a trap
---
Be he randomly sprayed through a wall and got a headshot, he's clearly going to pro league
---
Yes, since the re-work was rolled out if Vigil's ability is active whilst Lion scans he can move freely.
---
Thanks
---
Why does your crosshair have black on the top and bottom?
---
don't call it S.S.; people are recognising it as  Schutzstaffel  instead of Secret Service lol
---
I enjoy the tatics of siege and how it isn't just a run and gun game like call of duty.
---
&gt;Win 3 rounds with Maestro or Alibi in Terrorist Hunt
---
üñï
---
Jealously is the main reason for me.
---
I should play ranked, but I don't like to be serious about it, so I go casual. And all the time I'll think I'm helping or saving a teammate, by killing an enemy thats just dropping their health. Its always seen as I'm stealing kills from that teammate. 
---
Like last night, I killed 3 enemies back to back to save a teammate who had really low health and was out in the open. He team killed me for stealing his kills. As if he would have had the chance.. He then ran back in the room and got killed. Karma I guess.
---
Also, this is becoming more and more common, but if I managed to ace or clutch a round for my team, some butthurt soul always team kills me instantly in the next round. 
---
I recently came back to the game after a hiatus and this shit seems worse than before. I was expecting them to put in that new punishment/forgive system by now, but I guess not..
---
And just because I remembered it, another one is if they shot you accidentally and then just decide to finish the deed. All too many times my teammates try to shot drones, and all too many times they hit me in the process. I used to turn around just to see what was going on, but I guess they would panic and shoot me before I could do anything. Now days If it happens, I just carry on and pretend like it didn't happen. Just nope, I totally started with 56 Health. Rather play the game that way than not at all. It is kind of funny to see them run and cower to a corner, but I try not to look for too long, otherwise they'll think I'm pissed and kill me.
---
thats like triple my my hard drive from 10 years ago
---
That man was on a mission to destroy your drone
---
Being shot as soon as I spawn.  That is not skill, it‚Äôs bullshit.
---
I only suggested a way to reward players from playing, I don't see what's wrong with that. You could get a cool skin that shows that you main that operator and you completed a very hard/long mission to get that skin, like you need to get for example 100 headshots to get that. You said that it's unnecessary, skins in general are annecessary, tho they're here.
---
Im an old timer quake player and back in the days right mouse was for jumping ! And aiming was thumb button so ive always stick with it :P
---
So every1 beter than you just report dont have to play. You are going to end up with nobody ever playing.
---
You are like all the other dummys. Talk talk no analysis.

Try casual.
---
&gt; I only suggested a way to reward players from playing, I don't see what's wrong with that.

Unecessary, attracts children and people who are more interested in cosmetics than anything else.

That is indeed a rez, but anyway...  
---
First off, I didn't mean a toy as in something you'd give to a kid, but rather something you use to have fun. Go to a range, pop off a couple, maybe a couple dozen or a hundred rounds in there, pack it back up and return home. I didn't mean you'd go to your backyard and play with it there, unless you have a legal shooting range there of course.  
---
I could've used a better word, I admit, but I quite obviously am not a native Anglophone.  
---
  
---
&gt;Yes people hunt with AR's. AR's are perfect for varmit hunting/pest control (Ex:coyote or groundhogs) and a .300 blackout AR is ideal for hogs.  
---
Okay, that I didn't realise. I mean, I do imagine people using bolt action rifles, that's what most professional hunters in my country (Poland) use. That and hunting shotguns (commonly known in Poland as Fuzja or Fusion in English).  
---
Either way, I didn't realise people use ARs for hunting.  
---
I'm aware that there are bolt action rifles using "AR rounds" or (and I had to look up the name in English since I only know the Polish one) intermediate cartriges (that's what they're called), since that's more or less logical. Just as there are rifles of all types, semi/full-auto, bolt action, lever-action that use .22lr and other cartriges too.  
---
AR is not defined by its ammo, not exclusively at least, so there's no need to talk about it. The issue is me not being an American therefore not necessarily knowing people use AR's for home defence (homes in Poland are a bit too small to use even an Airsoft replica, my G36K replica is still too long despite being shorter than a proper, real life G36, M16 or an AK-74, maybe even longer than a military issue M4, not sure) or hunting (like I said, I didn't think of that, even though it's logical that "if it exists, someone is probably going to hunt with it").  
---
&gt;Simply put, civilians dont own automatic weapons.  
---
Actually... /watch?v=f-F13WmV1NM and /watch?v=pRjGvfoEl5Q 
---
It may not be easy but it's possible.  
---
Your comment did teach me a thing or two I'll give you that, but while mine might've came off as ignorant, your sounds extremely condescending yourself, while still managing to make a mistake or two, while trying to fix mine in a rez of 25 days...  
---
So yeah.  
---
If you want to continue this convo, please let's move to PM instead.  
---

Hope it works after I reinstall siege I use ut

it states nowhere that it got fixed.

What are your thoughts regarding the Skorpion?
---
i think the dilemma is the 10yo on XBOX can't translate AUS to EST so they have no idea what you are talking about.
---
You say something
---
Mister Bear had lost their stuffing. And it made rainbow pals very upset!
---
Haha you win! I fell out of love with R6S for a while and I‚Äôm just getting back into it, so had a look through my old clips and found this shocking set up.
---
Says the Blitz main. Oof. Lol only joking. 
---
Maverick mains are true beta males
---
He was just too ashamed that he couldn't even get one hacked.
---
Actually did that one yesterday. Chat feed what like "-wtf frost" then disconnected.  
---
Priceless &lt;3
---
That's not even being trolled, it's stupidity. They didn't trick you into doing anything just said to "throw a smoke. Yeah. Detonate that shit".
---
When you have blitz elite
---
...well could be a premade squad from a terrible networked country :) 
---
But i suggest your opinion^^
---
Finally! A fellow spawnpeek hater! Every time I say I dont like spawnpeekers, people say "predict where they're gonna peek from", or "sorry you're bad".
---
I'm sorry you gotta deal with stuff like this. Truth be told, they're a bunch of sad saps who dont know how to fill that void in their lives so they harass people online to feel some kind of joy. The female players tend to get it worse though. I really hope you find some people to play with that'll actual play instead of being shitheads. You should DM some of the people that comment on your post and see if any of them would like to play with you!
---
Yep, really infuriating
---
It‚Äôs just massive FPS drops
---
Sliding seems like it would be abused in this game somehow

Good lord what if Sledge could go through floors like that. That would be TERRIFYING
---
Yep. I get that quite frequently, especially when aiming at the enemy. Weird thing is, after Siege runs for about an hour(?), it stops doing that
---
Is there not a very good reason why those maps aren't in ranked?
---
One of my biggest problems right now it‚Äôs tick rate I feel like it‚Äôs been bad all season
---
One of the best ways to warm is go into a game and aim in one spot and move around keep your aim on that one spot
---
How do you know this though? I'm not saying you're wrong, just want to know how you're so sure that's the case.
---
If it is the case then fix the killcams then, because I'm not going to believe an enemy killed me "fair and square" if I can't see them killing me fair and square am I?
---
Oof.. The amount of salt in this one is huge. Let me comment on a few things, which may increase the fun you have with r6. Spoiler Alert: Play Ranked!
---
1. Team up with a group of 5. That way those One-Man-Show Scenarios wont appear. Even if you solo Que, in Ranked the team communicates very nicely every round.
---
2. Check 1. If you communicate with the team, this will not happen.
---
3. COMMUNICATE.
---
4. I'm repeating myself, don't I? COMMUNICATE! Where do you need the Rotation, Where do you need the ADS, where the Mira? Talk to your Teammates.
---
5. Not a thing in Ranked :)
---
6. Well, everyone has their Favourit Maps. I would like a Map Voting System like the have in cod or smth.. But it is how it is. We have to get over it.
---
7. There are "Normal challenges"? For Example "Hit 5 Headshots in Multiplayer", "Kill 5 Enemies with J√§ger, IQ, Blitz or Bandit" and so on.
---
8. Not a thin in Ranked :) I ve never seen a guy ragequit out of a ranked match.
---
9. If there is a Problem, i would rather say its the Internet Connection than the PC Specs. But this never bothered me so far. Sometimes u have to wait 5 Seconds longer till the Match starts.. So what? More time to discuss your upcomming strats with your Team :)
---
10. Not a Thing in Ranked :)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Resume√©: 
---
GO PLAY RANKED.  
---
It's the way Siege is designed to play. Competitive.
---
Amen.
---
Yeah, what about it?
---
A few seasons ago, the skill level at Gold 1 is likely the same skill level now represented by Gold 2 or 3. Everyone playing this game is constantly getting better, so naturally taking a break is going to set you back compared to the progression of the rest of the playerbase. Given you already probably know the majority of maps and some useful strategies on them, the main thing to do will be to just play a lot to try to grind back up to your previous relative skill level.
---
For the new maps, walk through each one in a custom game with Buck or Sledge and open up every floor, wall, etc. for each bomb site. I find that more useful than watching map guides.
---
For getting you aim back, pick Ash and run through a terrorist hunt round, put the G36C on Semi-Auto, and try to go as fast as possible getting only headshots.
---
I don't wanna day you're stupid.... but.....
---
It‚Äôs simply because it was a good map
---
/s
---
Sure, he is weak, but one friend tried to make me feel bad for playing him because he claimed Tachanka is so useless that he is a burden on the team and tried to make a case for why I shouldn't be playing him, that he is only for meming around. I proved him wrong in terrorist hunt to a extent, albiet that is by no means a good representation of a actual fight between players since the terrorists funnel themselves into the same entry points. At first I got no kills cause I set up in a bad spot and my friends kept making fun of me for trying to make his case but the second time I set up from where they were shooting and I was extremely successful. My friend got annoyed and when I got shot up and asked him to shoot me with a doc needle he goes "oh you want me to shoot you?", then proceeds to down me, pick me back up, and ignore further requests for a health boost. It was ironic that after I died my other friend that had been afk during all this went and started using my turret despite the fact that he had chosen to jump in the bandwagon last round and roast Tachanka. We are just a band of memes tbh.

If you can‚Äôt beat them, join them.

Find some friends to play with and custom 1v4 em. You're gonna get dumpster'd on a lot of the time, but the practice is invaluable. We also play a game in casual called "gladiator" where on attack, everyone stays behind cover at spawn and one person goes in and does as much damage as possible. If you die, you get to say "okay [next person], I dare you to do better".

Windows 10 is plagued with stuttering issues since Creators Update. The workaround is to use 1607 or Windows 7.

Pc has the dumbest people y‚Äôall either good or so bad you really wonder while console is more in the middle
---
You gotta try her shotty, no need to aim with it
---
Do you not see my name?  She's my best operator that gun is why.
---
As someone who also recently got this game (PC), I would say that if you do the situations, DONT feel bad about dying to AI, they have incredible aim and honestly are not easy. 
---
Also, DONT play newvommer playlist, or atleast only play a few games. The reason being you should play casual more because newcommer does not give you a proper feel for the game. Remember that there is a lot to learn so make sure to ask your team about things you dont understand, as im sure atleast some of them will help.
---
This game is incredible, there are many people who are funny and fun to play with, and ofc, toxic players, eithet way still really fun and I hope you have a good time!
---
its a move i learned from Godly, where you prone then unprone, then sprint for a slide looking move.
---
X + X+ Shift
---
The reason would be to introduce the new players to the maps of the old Rainbow Six Siege

Then tell him to work for it like I had to before they game it for free to everyone at the time

You mean the maps that have been reworked?

Yeah but Castle has his own mixtape.

Been bad all of last year too. Match making has been terrible this season,  sound glitches have been horrible for a while now and hit reg as well has been broken since the gsme came out. But yeah the tick rate's are out of line this season to.

You should only really lose the mmr in the games you lost vs a cheater or won with a cheater.
---
I remember the first drones were like little pens rolling on the ground.  And the game was so dark, in terms of lighting.
---
I had a teammate complain when they ran infront of my fire and died. I was shooting for a good second and he just had to jump in front of me for no reason.
---
Wait, when did this skin ever exist?
---
learn to 360
---
I'd go *Woops wrong button* sorry for running into the fire.
---
F
---
No problem. That fo-12 is in my opinion the best in the game. And it far out ranks the scorpion by leagues. It's spammy the fastest firing in the game,  can "technically" have a faster fire rate than the scorpion. Has good range for a shotgun has a detachable mag for faster reloads. And good damage.
---
they were HAHAHHAA

anyway THXXX

Yeah this.. its not flawed it seems to be working correctly

Ok but if you read the other comments and my reply to your first comment, I never said I was good, I‚Äôm not great and playing on console adds to that. I wasn‚Äôt trying to say anything about how you were acting, it was just a bit rude considering how I had never said anything to contradict your argument.I‚Äôm kinda new to the game, I just thought it was a cool play. It didn‚Äôt require any skill, it was just really lucky that they were all there. Can we just stop this dude I wasn‚Äôt trying to say I was good or whatever you were saying.
---
I can see the inception of screens in your goggles' reflex
---
Forsure dude. Now we have a fucked up mira strat AND a dead teammate...copper mindset.
---
quit fuckin cryin
---
Lol okay you just raised your score a who 2 points with that reply 11/10 XD
---
YouTube it
---
Spawn peeks are the key to success
---
To be fair im usualy upset for stuff like that. When im playing buck i try to open the whole hatch above/underneeth it so i need all the ammo thats aviable
---
Did you even read my comment? You have one or the other, not both.

Please god no

you can, it's just harder to do, when I played ps4 I've encountered people who I knew for a fact were blatantly cheating.

no, it's not cod

I personally save his skeleton key exclusively for vertical breaching and maybe a extremely dire close quarters situation to kill a guy. Otherwise I don‚Äôt use it.
---
You look stupid with red dot 2x
---
You realize code can be injected and manipulated, right? Packets can also be modified before being sent, which is theoretically possible using a modified router.
---
Why it would be annoying?The lines only last 5 seconds lol.
---
You look stupid with red dot 3x
---
So nothing short can ever be annoying?
---
Buy boosters fast
---
You were expecting to blow hatch with your breach charges but it was Me ASH
---
Hell yeah it is
---
Pornhub it
---
Nah it look stupid
---
Tfw glutes nerfed into oblivion
---
Was the clip funny
---
Yus it was
---
How much did it cost
---
A 30 minute ban
---
As someone who likes DMRs, fuck this shit.
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
But the Mira wouldn‚Äôt team kill if her strat isn‚Äôt ruined by her teammate. You said teammate gets killed for ruining Mira‚Äôs setup. So yes both do happen
---
Just discovered a new way to be able to do the same spawnpeek but without a mira so :/
---
Yes. In the menu go to matchmaking settings. Here you can choose game mode type for multiplayer (bomb, secure, hostage), game mode for t-hunt (classic, hostage, defend bomb, maybe another one? I only have bomb for multiplayer and classic for t-hunt), and they have map select. Map select only works for t-hunt. Turn on classic t-hunt / Outback to get good t-hunt aim practice without nitro or bombers and try to only get headshots
---
It‚Äôs the top choice of Chads‚Ñ¢Ô∏è everywhere to assert their dominance
---
what a master
---
Obvious? Correct me if I'm wrong but there's only two places to peek from that spawn.
---
Just clip it and send it to ubi support and they get immediately banned for toxicity and you get free boosters every 3-4 reports. Been doing this for months and have enough boosters to have one on for the rest of the year.
---
IQ feeling cute, might scan defender gadgets later.. idk.
---
Yea but they just wanted a April fools thing.
---
No I want to know how to counter being tracked and cornered at spawn
---
Give one example of where this would be useful
---
waint wut.... why would you want higher cpu usage? if you have 100 cpu usage that would be a bottle neck or you wouldnt be able to run programs in the background, making you freze in game. i got a 1070 strix oc and i get around 160-70 on low settings(competetice seetingas).and around 40% cpu usage, if you want more fps then do a overclock
---
ying the shemale
---
The only time I don‚Äôt choose buck is if someone picks him first
---
Perfect, thank you
---
You mean tracked as in she got an interrogation?
---
People like that, make this community toxic.  I can't wait till ubi punishes those who do this.  You got outplayed even though you could see her.  Deal with it and accept your fate.
---
What reallybruv said
---
1. He should at least try to fix what's happened  him.
---
2. There is always the grenade mishaps that can ricochet and kill teammates. The idiots who walk into your line of fire. Plenty of unintentional ways to TK people. The fuze puck that ricochet off some crazy surface that kills your teammate. Getting C4 throw wrong and ... .Welcome to rainbow six siege. I'm pretty sure your really clueless about this game if you don't know about the million ways you can accidentally tk and get a ban.
---
3. Try to be a little positive. Not everything is made up. It might be real. You know glass half full, innocent until proven guilty. It must pretty sad to live in your world.
---
How to counter
---
1) don't peak someone you clear knew was waiting for you to do it
---
2) don't miss your shots?
---
They got a headshot, you missed. They could have done that with ANY op and it would have outright killed you.
---
Imagine how many times you'd stick your teammates just by holding it.
---
This game isn't big enough to do this I don't think. I am currently plat 1. Do you know how long I sat in a queue on Sunday? 80 minutes. The only way I can get a game is if I am 5 stacking or find a random gold to queue with.
---
it came with her first nerf
---
Definitely, stay on it and don‚Äôt be discouraged by the community
---
Just add people you meet in casual lol
---
This looks incredible, nice job :D
---
this was casual lol
---
Yeah you need to destroy every little splint of wood :)
---
Yeah they really need to add mounts to the guns that have the Red Dot attached to the rail

The amount of legit plats is usually in the high two digit to mid three digit range depending on servers.

Same with anyone else, people need some wall unreinforced for a strat or just to open a rotate hole.
---
I personally prefer Tachanka Puffs
---
Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger,
---
Kys=kill your self.
---
A very hostile acronym if I don‚Äôt say myself.
---
Don‚Äôt get interrogated? Don‚Äôt sit in spawn on your twitch drone doing nothing until you‚Äôre whole team is dead?
---
You missed every shot but one and that was probably just shield lag
---
git gud
---
no over sexuality and there's phub in the background nice
---
How do you feel about individual performance being taken into account when mmr is being given out? As far as I know, it‚Äôs only did you win or lose that counts and I understand why that is but it sucks when you go like 8-4 kd but your entire rest of your team go 1-4 and you lose despite your best efforts. I know I should get a team together and play with the same people and all that but I‚Äôm antisocial and just want to solo queue
---
Oh forgive me lord for being skeptical about the situation /s
---
Get outta here kid I don't need that shit
---
Just put on a delay....
---
No you usually get the multiplayer casual on play button when your kicked out of the match to directly matchmaker into casual. But when you get out of a ranked match it turns into simple play button where you have to choose what you wanna do again.
---
Yeah, I thanked the person but forgot the username. I am smart I promise
---
Would be great a deathmatch mode like cs to practice aim.
---
(Random respawn, no wainting)
---
Clip it and send it to ubi support
---
who knew montagne was the invisible man
---
I'd stop buying them. They make it so its damn near impossible to spend all the credits by adjusting how many you can buy to how many you can spend. Youre just throwing money at them
---
The community has been amazing! When I played the first few games, I always say in chat ‚ÄúHey guys. I‚Äôm very new. Apologies if I‚Äôm terrible.‚Äù and 100% everyone just went ‚Äúno worries bud just do ur best.‚Äù
---
How the fuck they made you do that.... I mean no normal man can do that, but are they your mates?
---
&gt;You are like all the other dummys. Talk talk no analysis.
---
It appears that you would be the one who needs to look in the mirror as your the idiot here that didn't perform any analysis. I take it you've never been placed on the same team multiple ranked games in a row with the same toxic griefer/thrower. That happened three games in a row before I made my previous comment. I went from Gold IV to Bronze I because of that shit.
---
I'm sorry, I just have to say it: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOARD THE HELICOPTER!
---
how very fortunate of you
---
Because you were vocal, and actuall low level, get some friends, kindergarten will be over soon and middle school is full of sad fat bullies
---
easiest way to do it (if you actually want to do it): defend the hostage in the bank's vault, barricade up the vault side of the floor, stand in the elevator looking towards the CCTV room, and kill all the enemies as they come through the doors in front of you.

More it more of a function hey there is a toxic fucker on my team, again, so time to leave. Even if a person were to abuse such a mechanic it wouldn't help them as the ELO formula requires one to play people of the same or better skill in order to advance their own ELO score. Really basic math.
---
it tells you that you have two years to spend credits you earn before it takes it away, its not "random" rlly
---
Twitch, but close enough
---
How? I'm interested

The CAMRS is so loud it scars the shit out of me. So even though I really like the dmrs in siege I just can't play it which is a shame because I have black ice for it :( .
---
That's Microsofts deal to make more money with licensed hardware. Rainbow Six allows it. And no. It is not cheating. It is another input device and thats it.

By the way, you may think that high ping is a king but it is not
---
If someone has 150 ping, it means it takes 150 ms for the server to recognised their action I.e kill you so if that person is very good at slow/fast movement meaning that they will peek you and tap a few times and try to get you again and then eventually kill you then you were just outplayed by literally the slowest moving player in that game 
---
Test it, play with someone who has insane ping in your team and watch them lag like crazy. High ping player literally use timing to their advantage
---
Start with situations, it'll give you a lot of renown to buy operators and will give you a look at some of them while getting familiarized with the main. And probably the most important thing is to make some friends cause sadly the community usually isn't all that nice to new players
---
I was waiting for the frost trap tbh
---
People who TK me for no reason at the start of the round sometimes get a KYS if I‚Äôve had a shit day and just want to unwind.

It‚Äôs very hostile, but I actually don‚Äôt care. Don‚Äôt be a toxic piece of shit and you won‚Äôt get nasty messages.

It says he killed you with a EDD so technically he could have
---
But then it ruins the game for the teammates with that stack, as it makes the game equivalent to a 5v4
---
Fair enough. I win more in casuals than in ranked so I often get placed against plats in casual even though I‚Äôm gold 2 and it pisses me off cause my casual games are harder than my ranked games. Wish I could get opponents like this lol
---
Anyone saying killcams aren't accurate doesn't know what they are talking about. We fucking know the killcams aren't accurate but if you stopped and used your brain for a second you would realize this is something else.
---
Since this season started there has been an issue with what I'm guessing is client sided player models. Where you are in one spot on your screen and in a different spot on theirs. You can tell this is the issue and not the kill cams because there are scenarios where for example, you will get killed by someone and when you watch the kill cam the air they are shooting is not only a spot where you weren't there, but also a spot where you never went there the entire round. Not only that but where they were actually standing compared to where you were it would be impossible to kill you due to indestructible walls.
---
There have been videos posted where someone is sitting well in cover behind indestructible walls and the player that killed them is located in a position where it would not only be impossible to kill them in that moment but for the entire round as well. 
---
This is all caused by a new glitch that causes our games to not actually know where people are.
---
I think Dokka's gun is the only thing close to the loudness that is Buck's.
---
How‚Äôs that sweet copper life?
---
I didn't expect to see myself to watch Vietnamese playing with Japanese audio on Reddit this soon.
---
Ubisoft has made it clear they don't care and they won't watch the videos
---
Shield ops are my favorites tbh even though shields are broken
---
I while ago ubi said they wouldn‚Äôt add in any shield ops till they were fixed, I think that was in year 2.
---
I practice with that gun so damn much trying to learn the recoil. With holo it is no problem at all, but I still struggle with the acog.
---
And your on console of places, how well do you even think you'd be on a KBM?
---
just leave the match real quick, maybe that helps AND they still die :)
---
Terrorist hunt has some real potential but the dont seem to give a shit about it. 
---
Newcomers playlist not helping? Just play T hunt
---
Need to improve your aim? T hunt
---
Finding the right sensitivity? T hunt
---
If they could only add options to T hunt  remove certain aspects or others, hell maybe even making the terrorists have skins of actual operators of the defense and offensive respectively so you can learn to spot them and react to them better.....it truly would make the gamemode so so much more useful,  even with the renown gain so minuscule. You literally need like 20-30 games to get 1000 renown, nobody is trying to abuse it to get renown, we just want to get good
---
How do you get this skin?
---
nothing bad in particular,,,  everything just feels a lot better when she use the russian nano juice...
---
Contact Ubisoft support
---
A lot of squads have different callouts for different places so if it isn't labeled on the map just listen to team members and try to pick up on what they call it and if you play with randoms then find what its called out most often. Watching youtube videos and streams is a great way to learn maps and map names but you won't really learn them until you play it and put it into action.
---
If I am not wrong, it is the area under the back stage stairs of oregon, which resembles where Potter was forced to stay.
---
It's a pretty old call out.
---
I‚Äôd say just focus on learning the guns, operator abilities, and maybe just a little map knowledge. Don‚Äôt be discouraged if you die a lot or it takes a while to learn. Rainbow 6 is a hard game with a huge learning curve. Have fun!
---
I'll have to double check
---
Create a setup for every operator you have unlocked before going into games and also figure out what sights work best for you. (Usually stay away from red dot) 
---
You can also go into private matches to learn the map layouts. Personally I just learned as I went along but if  you chose to learn in private matches you should try to learn the best angles and best places to enter through as an attacker. I‚Äôm not the best at the game but I‚Äôve been playing for a little over a year. Hope this was helpful!

Bottom of the back stairs on oregan. The stairs by construction

It was done because maestro had too much near-industrictable Intel utility.
---
What if you don't know where he shot you from?
---
death replay
---
Honestly you‚Äôll learn the more I play. But worst case just call out the location on the map. Most people will know what you mean. Or try and be very descriptive like north side of archives. Or east side under skylight. Just keep calling out you‚Äôll get the hang of it.
---
Wouldnt that be Ash? Her breaching rounds lets you play wherever you want, and her secondaries allow you to either be more vertical or entry fragger.
---
New way to do an old spawnpeek
---
just don‚Äôt go afk for 0.2 milliseconds

It's the view of a Mira on the side you can't see through

I'm 100% sure it was, I even saw the blood splash!!!
---
Under the stairs in Oregon
---
Play Terrorist Hunt to get a feel for maps, weapons and gadgets. When you think you're ready for PvP, start in the beginner playlist. Be prepared to get your ass kicked a lot, the game has a bit of a learning curve.
---
imagine a 15 dollar skin for an op u cant customize
---
i like it tho pretty cool
---
Ya there are some guns that it's good on for sure. OTs03 and IQs pistol are definitley good ones.
---
I run one on Mavericks pistol for easy quiet headshots
---
Fair
---
Areas have name. Look at the bottom of you screen near the radar. It works also when you are on cams.
---
There is no range in this game, just progressive damage drop off. The bullet never reaches 0
---
And what was the other guys ping?
---
this gun has more DPS than MP5 :D
---
Ash Jager main spotted

We don‚Äôt know we can‚Äôt see his perspective

Yea back in the first year I played mainly ash but I never use her breaching rounds lol I found them kinda useless compared to others. Her primary is amazing tho. The RC4 it‚Äôs called I think?
---
Its fucking depravity to play with or against a diamond player in copper 4. Not even when i was in silver i got fucking diamods, why in the less skilled bracked i get the most skilled? FUCKIGN HATE THIS GAME.
---
Nah dude kill cams are busted and don‚Äôt show character models leaning. It‚Äôs the reason for all the ‚Äúbs‚Äù clips on reddit right now. Real time ops head was right there, in the kill cam Mira was standing straight up. R6 has some of the best hitreg of any FPS game out right now but people just like to bitch. Shooting in R6 feels wack because it‚Äôs insanely more precise than any other game. You‚Äôre playing a game like apex where you can shoot someone in the backpack and hit them and then you switch to rainbow where hitboxes are extremely refined and it feels like your bullets are going through people but you‚Äôre actually just missing

Next time use sledge

Yes. just a whole lot of toxicity

Those are the DLC operators, right? They are still expensive, only the base ops(the ones from GIGN, GSG9, SAS, FBI and Spetsnaz) are the ones with the low prices.
---
dude, his change means that the dropoff would start 15% sooner but the damage wouldnt change
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox but from what I understand pc is pretty fast paced compared to console so just try to learn maps and such along with just playing ranked helps with everything aim comes really easily just experience is the main thing
---
You're recommending the division? Oof, boring af imo
---
What if instead of plugging his youtube he just answered the question? Hmm
---
Some people are stupid and predictable. They do the same thing every round and wonder why they die. Lol!
---
With the help of a teammate you could easily do it within prep phase.
---
Because he said that it was a video?
---
Yes, Maestro in particular has one about Ash's head being really small and it being hard to headshot her as a reference to the Ash head hitbox joke

Imagine if u fell and died before recording, that would've been painful

Iron sights are actually pretty cool in my opinion as long as they don‚Äôt obstruct too much of the screen. Lots of fun and maximum salty.
---
Yeah
---
hello there \^w\^
---
Gotta be honest I was really afraid of that xD
---
True. It could ruin some games. Still I think Diamonds usually don't have that many copper friends that actually want to play at diamond lvl. Meaning the problem only arises when we stretch the valid examples to extremes.
---
I mean I'm certainly not a fan but all it takes is not looking and bam problem solved lmao
---
I agree but my last two posts here got peppered with but some optics on but I dont care I enjoy their annoyance XD
---
It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt see them it‚Äôs more the kill cam shows me dying once they‚Äôve passed the wall so it looks like they shot through it
---
Eh... by that logic any of them can have a large lmg. Hell fuze already has a giant fucking LMG. I just don't think it would be chanka anymore. It would feel too much like a new operator
---
England and Ireland mainly, although I've seen the occasional middle easterns and french play on neu. Would not recommend playing on it as match times are way too long.m
---
Yes
---
They are changing smokes next season so they wont kick you for team damage. When thermite's charges did this I was annoyed. People would pile up on a charge to get someone kicked. Such children.
---
He said that after the guy asked how to do the trick....hence the shameless plug.
---
Shotguns don't get the headshot multuplier, so even if you hit someone in the head it'll kill them if your at close range, but any farther than say 15 meters it's prolly just gonna hurt or down then unfortunately, but it's for balancing since there's always ONE pellet out of the whole spread that hits exactly where the reticle is, you could just cheese a headshot from up to 40 meters
---
This is the most detailed op idea I‚Äôve ever seen keep up the good work

If you watch carefully he jumped out at the very last second, probably prefiring. If you pause at the perfect moment he is visible for a frame or two.

What are?

I use them exclusively with the 590 shotgun, MP7, ARX200, AA-12, SCAR, Zofia‚Äôs AK, the Skorpion, a ton. They‚Äôre fun and some, especially the MP7 type sights are quick as hell and very reflexive.

I really do be like that sometimes

This is so sad

So like...how‚Äôd you not murder your own team

I have basically all my guns unsighted except the CAMRS because my lazy ass does not wanna change that in the Operators screen XD but I dont mind I played a ton of FPS games with iron sights

getting pixel peeked by some kid nowhere near obj makes me retarded?

Saying that people boost their rank and play shitty isn't the game's problem, it's their problem and honestly I don't see how that would affect me (my rank alternates between gold and silver). I just play, do my best and learn to be a better player. I don't care if others boost or lower their ranks intentionally, and most importantly, I wanna play ranked with my friends.
---
How dare I have an opinion

Damn I got flexed on, congrats dude

You have a drone. Don‚Äôt complain about something that‚Äôs completely avoidable.

Yes it does. Don‚Äôt walk in front of that angle next time.

Very poorly
---
Droning out from spawn, r u serious
---
They have multiple studios and dev teams at ubi, yet epic games and dice are smaller companies and take a fracture of the time to fix their games. And battlefield is much more complicated an ed big. Also screw epic games.
---
I hate spawn peeks but you can't complain about getting peeked I'm the first five seconds and the claim the rest of the team are retarded. They lasted longer than you did.
---
Fair enough
---
I hate spawnpeekers too and all, but it‚Äôs what makes siege siege, I don‚Äôt think a terriost would hold open a door for you would they, not would they want you in the building, this give the real effect, How about instead have a huge slowness added to the rushing operator so they have to commit to it
---
Virtue signaling implies that we want to see anime drawings and that people who complain are just secretly people who like it but want to seem like they are anti anime to their fellow R6 redditors...

That makes no sense dude. Some people just don't like non gameplay related content or anything that's not cosplay. I don't like fanservice because it just shits up the place to being fan service subreddit where we all post pictures and fan fic of dokka and Hibana

You get maximum 5 targets in a round, chances are you'll get maybe up to 2 normally. With T hunt you get tons of them, you can learn to flick better, soundwhore better, generally you have like 20 targets in a game, there's no waiting you can just jump into it. Or course Casual is better for warming up for ranked, but I prefer T hunt to get my aim right, and it's more fun. I usually suck at targetting 2 or more people, most because of high ping meaning it takes a while for bullets to register and I'm still used to shooting half my mag at one guy, so getting used to especially being able to clutch better is why T hunt....for me at least
---
OK this is basically only far fetched speculation
---
Y repost
---
this is an old angle,
---
the opposite side of the transformer/AC unit /idk had a good line of sight on that spot. they can see it too though
---
Clearly a cardboard Bandit. True top level Bandit mains only place their gadget on top of reinforced hatches.
---
So peaceful. Nice job defusing the situation.
---
Yea it is dope
---
Could be that you‚Äôre just not quite noticing an extra shot or two when you get downed
---
That's the whole point of prep phase though. The idea is that you PREPARE. I understand what you're getting at but there would be no way of enforcing it. Theres still a risk of them roaming. You literally just need to be ready for that early encounter.
---
You have 45 seconds during drone phase. Leave your drone where spawn peaks are popular. Yes I‚Äôve been spawn peaked but it‚Äôs my fault for not paying attention.
---
I can‚Äôt stop looking at that guy behind her, he‚Äôs just giving me the rape eyes

I know right? I have an ethernet cable in my xbox then Im against these same people with 150 ping and I'm out the game.
---
No, virtue signaling is complaining about a drawn sfw pic that contained cleavage in an effort to seem "woke" because if women appear sexy *at all* it isnt cool. Meanwhile how many people do you see with the Elite IQ skin? lmao
---
Should be diamond,  plat 1 rn. Got ddosed 4 times in one day when i was only 3 matches away from diamond. All matches it happened in we were winning so kinda pissed.
---
There is only one rule in this game, if you get a black ice you gonna play with that weapon no matter what.
---
nah the real problem is her eyes being too wide for her glasses
---
Sound a bit stupid, but try Call of duty ghosts, it's old but I feels like siege (before grim sky)

That's not a fix that's a work around that doesnt fix shit. Stop telling people this because it doesn't work how you'll hope it to.
---
I don't know

Ubisoft and their joining priorities. /s

Well, they claim to have the game esports ready but if they neglect the small things makes you wonder about everything else... just saying.

Killcams should be removed completely.
---
I just use the nitros as additional Target practice now. I try to tap then all as fast as possible. I don't mind them as much as the room of barbed wire.
---
High ranking players should be good at the game, so really they wouldn't be affected that much. And yeah i see your point, but that already happens normally which is fine, It's just when a low and high rank are queueing together is the main problem.
---
Kinda, not so much stutters as tearing. It happened here and there the past two-three seasons for me, but this season is far more pronounced. It happens nearly every game now, compared to maybe one occurrence in a *match* every three+ days.
---
I've kept everything from my BIOS to graphics and audio drivers updated. The mark is clearly with the new season, however.
---
Bruh that‚Äôs kindof a dick move ngl.
---
Cool strat but I don‚Äôt have 3 mins of prep phase
---
You mean on top of reinforced hatches?
---
Just saying
---
Ranked should not have killcams at all.
---
Eh, too much effort
---
Do you not understand how a player is downed in the game? A player is downed after taking 100 damage where the final shit is not landed on the head, the player is not rappelling or the total damage does not exceed 120 hp after compensating for armorAlso glaz is far from the only op to have a weapon  that does over 50. Twitch and lions 417 does 69 damage per shot, bucks dmr also does 69, blackbeards SR-25 does 61, the lfp586 does 78 which is actually more than glaz‚Äôs rifle. Need i name more or is that sufficient?
---
Makes me weirdly anxious

/r/&lt;woosh&gt;

I had a team start the vote kick in a 1v4, last guy keeps saying he's going to wait to vote until I die, I proceeded to clutch it. Next round starts I take cav, down them all, say fuck you I leave on my terms. 
---
I fight toxic with toxic, sue me.
---
Fucking incredible.
---
if that‚Äôs true, what a player lmao
---
He's just "flirting" with her, if that's the word
---
Where did you get this lie, or did you pull this out of your ass?
---
Yes but you still dont see my point. It would effect high level play too. If you get shot and dont know where from. When you die you get a free callout despite not knowing that information. The feature would have to be rank locked for it to work the way op intends it to
---
Lesion on attack would be good
---
Yeah feel free go ahead! &lt;3 If you are to credit any social media it would be best to do my youtube channel at:  [https://www.youtube.com/user/MrDjzelda](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrDjzelda)

Personally I would make it a telescopic tactical ladder, just type it into google images.

I use the 5.7 on most of the ops who can use it. It is way better to have all those extra bullets when you need them. Even if it deals less damage per hit.

That is DEFENDER ladders. Mines attack GG

Dude. First of all you were talking about getting shot in the head and getting 1 shot killed when I said getting DOWNED, not dying, I know the damage threshold to go down you jackass. Second, I said that Glaz was the only Operator that has a 50+ DMG weapon that has been involved in me getting 1-2 shot down. Again man, actually READ before you reply. Cause right now, you're looking dumber by the second.
