Yes, you are now Twitches gadget is essentially useless.

---
---
This video explains it all.

---
He can do both.  Though if you are saving his gadget to use while roaming, you better hope the enemy is pushing you and that you are in a good spot to waste their time. At that point you might as well anchor on site.
---
His gun is also not as good as Jager's so there's that.
---
Generally children with no impulse control
---
Yes it does, very severely even. At 300+ ping *none of your shots will register*. Ever. Thats the hard cutoff.
---
At around 150+ the server heavily distrusts your client, so a lot of shots will be dismissed and if theres any  "conflict" (e.g. a  kill trade), it will discard your side every time.
---
Had some shitty internet for 2 months and you notice things like this very quickly. Also Ubi said something about this, but afaik they did not provide hard values.
---
Where do you live?
---
At least u had Asia servers to begin with
---
I believe that‚Äôs supposed to be a bit of humor. The irony of Mute, who almost never speaks, telling someone they‚Äôre too quiet, is a little bit of friendly banter coming through
---
No I‚Äôm not saying nerf everything but it‚Äôs points like this, about ops like J√§ger, do we want all weapons similar to Jagers 416C to get damage buffs to compete and be more consistent, or do we change the one obvious outlier? 
---
MP5 is one of the easiest and most effective weapons on defence. With the ACOG, the gun isn‚Äôt mediocre. Saying that,  it‚Äôs more about balancing the P90. I‚Äôd rather see the ACOG on a harder weapon to use, over an easier weapon, because of how strong an ACOGZ can be. The MP5 can‚Äôt render the P90 useless much longer. It‚Äôs pants balance but they won‚Äôt change it because people will be butt hurt. That‚Äôs the only reason. 
---
Ash‚Äôs R4C is still too good and renders the G36C clearly weaker still. Only plus is the ACOG but that isn‚Äôt enough of a pull. The R4C needs something else nerfed to it. She‚Äôs a different case to say twitch losing an ACOG or Doc/Rook losing their ACOG on the MP5. Different cases so ash should still be a priority. 
---
Weapon balance should be a top priority and we are 5 years in with OG ops still having these balance dillemas/decisions that ruin weapon balance and the whole point of trying to balance them
---
Plus Ela wasn‚Äôt broken, she was OP
---
 in Asia
---
I agree. The footsteps throw me off so much. It sounds like someone‚Äôs upstairs but they really be down stairs.
---
Yes, make any account And if your first pack isn‚Äôt epic I‚Äôll give you my fingers
---
I mean alot arent amazing comparatively, but the main issue are slower fire rate guns (as fire rate is king in siege)
---
Generally blackbeard's DMR suffers alot
---
Mavs DMR Suffers because his m4 is objectively better. (Turnign the m4 on semi auto has more dps and thus shorter ttk than his dmr)
---
The 417 isnt great but it's way better than it used to be
---
Several shotguns are bad in combat (spas12, six12, acs12, ita12L)
---
Smg12 suffers from its massive recoil nerf
---
G8A1 used to be my go to terrible gun pre-its angled grip
---
Be more specific
---
I can understand that, but at the same time the bugs, map balance, and operator balance is more important in my opinion
---
[deleted]
---
weren't u camping too
---
When this happened did it unlock ‚Äòall‚Äô the ops?  Because this happens in games like this where there are locked characters and when you lose connection to ubi servers mid game.  
---
I think this got fixed awhile ago with how you connect to their servers, but the simple way to say this is, your client communicated to ubi somehow to confirm which ops you were allowed to play, but when their servers went down this communication was lost so it just assumed you were allowed to play all of them.  
---
This use to happen when league of legends first came out ALL the time.  Which was great because you could test out a character before buying them.
---
You sound like an absolute Simp mate, calm down
---
It's an official sub and talking about cosplaying ain't forbidden.
---
I can have my own opinion and I share it.
---
If you share one of your photos online, you gotta keep in mind that people might like it, people might like idea or people might not like any of both.
---
I appreciate your previous projects.
---
I also like your IQ's 'head'(mask + helmet), but point of my 'wall of text' was - Going this way people are gonna share 1/10 or 1/20 unfinished cosplays and actually call it a cosplay. 
---
Following the definition - Cosplay = looking ; acting like X character from game/anime/movie/series w/e
---
One element ain't a cosplay. 
---
If we had to keep going your definition - Wearing socks would be already a cosplay because Y character has the same ;d 
---
You even called it 'IQ's cosplay test', not 'Prep phase for my IQ cosplay'. 
---
And this is what I'm pointing.
---
Everyone hates Operation Health but it‚Äôs honestly one of the only reasons R6 exists how it does today. So many amazing changes were made in how the game is framed and designed for the ground up. If you enjoy how Siege feels now you have Operation Health to thank. 
---
With that said, content wise I‚Äôd say Velvet Shell is amazing and game changing in a good way. It brought one of the most loved maps into the game.
---
First three rounds they threw the game I was 10-0 but still lossüò¢
---
Talked down to him saying that he should put quality. Maybe not hating but unconstructed criticism
---
If you don‚Äôt know not to use it the c75 has a lot of recoil yes she can take down window or door barricades which why are you putting up and people were complaining they want a actual sniper operator and here one is so yeah
---
It‚Äôs AMAZING almost the same
---
damn bro just some toxic people üòï
---
Ngl that is literally what i just said
---
Is that the platinum skin on the sniper??
---
Done ‚úÖ
---
Quick Play has its own MMR system separate from ranked. This is an intentional design as before operation health, it used your ranked MMR making queue times long for anyone above Plat 2. In turn, diamonds created smurf accounts just to play the game.
---
Just leave the game if you don‚Äôt want to play against a plat 3 who probably won‚Äôt try that hard in Quick Play.
---
An ar is useful roaming, but this was more looking at gadget use while roaming rather than weapons
---
It's after year 2 about this patch went out it's literally opposite way you're thinking about 
---
To elaborate the server didn't accept that you shot them the second faster because the 1000 ping persons data goes a second later meaning both parties have the exact same time to react and shoot
---
I usually recruit tk someone back if they did this to me...
---
I don‚Äôt think so. 
---
Slow firing, low damage (for its type) weapon. Mag size makes up for this allowing you to fight multiple players in a more balanced way.  
---
The pistol is hard to use and vigil has an ACOG as a 3 speed, but this is just as hard to use and provides less benefit. 
---
I think it would be fine overall, and many will take the handgun over the 44 mag
---
&gt; No, from Lesion's perspective his teammate randomly shot him
---
Look at the killcam, Lesion looks right at the drone OP was shooting at. If the Lesion had the critical thinking skills of a lemon he'd have figured it out.
---
Still if you k ow what your doing even on console recoil and other aiming stuff becomes a none issue if you know what your doing ( Xbox plat 2 ) but if you need to get use it just go into a custom game and just start firing into a wall
---
Imagine being white knight that can't discuss, instead has to use offensive words without adding any arguments, lul 
---
Yes, some people take cosplaying serious xD 
---
You can't call you Daryl from TWD If you only have crossbow. 
---
You can't call yourself Peter Parker If you only have a pair of glasses and an old style camera. 
---
But If animals like you can't read properly and draw a correct conclusion, then your education ain't finished yet.

Me and my buddies use her for her utility, but we‚Äôve been putting together strats for her since day one. We usually only play her on garage sites and CCTV though, just because those walls are too important. Anything else and her utility is not worth the loss in fragging potential for us. We‚Äôve got a few great snipers in our squad but anything we can do with her we can do with and ACOGed out AR, and have more insurance to boot.

I think she's a good addition, she just needs a slower ADS speed. The C75 is fine because it has garbage iron-sights. People are just using her as an entry operator because her ADS is ridiculous for a one-shot character. If they nerf the ADS speed, people will be forced to play her the way she's meant to be played.

thanks I'm new to reddit tbh

What is up with that picture of a red dot sight... anyone who has played the game knows the sight does not look like that. That thick gray border is just a glitch that happened on some guns. The actual red dot sight has a much bigger field of view inside the scope. How is this even a real comparison between anything?
---
Are you using Bluetooth or wired beacuse if your using wired then it‚Äôs probably a sound setting on your Xbox if your using Bluetooth just do a reset of them every time before you play at least for me this stuff was helpful for me
---
You can vault from the stairs

Will do.  PM and on Tuesday after my engineering final I will send you a picture.

It does though maybe it‚Äôs different on PlayStation or higher ranks on pc but for Xbox plat and up its gets used about the same as the mp5 even pre nerf and gold on pc uses it a fair amount to I just see more doc players running around with it then the mo5
---
EU and NA

If you get a injure and kill assist it‚Äôs 125 points,while a kill is a 100 points

Thank u

Smh xbox players

You know smh means shake my head right? It makes more sense to leave it at smh
---
Holy shat
---
Yes
---
Smh my head :(
---
they changed penetration this season, it would count now
---
I sent you an invite or should i add you?
---
Oh wow, only thing left is learning portuguese, so here we go: can you say "cad√™ eles, seu desgra√ßado?". It means "where are they, you motherfucker?"
---
I see your problem I agree with it too but most of the guns you named are somewhat lazer beams maybe something like the f2 would be fair or have the same vertical  recoil but take away from random horizontal shift
---
Ur right ur right
---
Yes I do, ‚ÄúSmh my head‚Äù is a common phrase or ‚Äúmeme‚Äù nowadays used by one who is upset or angry.
---
Add me, I'm watching a ufc fight tonight. I'll be on tomorrow all day or later tonight after the fight
---
Sure man!
---
Hot
---
It‚Äôs causal and your mad about playing against a level 160 plat 3? Play ranked if you want similar skill levels
---
Im a plat player don't go and say that i cant play at my own skill level. you really don't have to be so toxic about it jesus
---
Yeah the idea was guns like that can do so much and ela has her recoil that make me cry
---
1. Semi-scope (my bad)
---
2. I ended up getting clapped by Mute near objective
---
You‚Äôre crazy
---
But nice to hear that they already took care of it.
---
Umm.. yes go get a friend who knows how to play the game and one who doesn‚Äôt and have them fire at a wall we will see if they have the same outcome
---
Try resetting game or playing through a casual/thunt 
---
When your estimated wait time is 30 seconds even that means your in a ranked game and it‚Äôs trying to reconnect you to it. Sometimes the game glitches and doesn‚Äôt let you join back and you get a ban and -elo, sometimes it just glitches and you gotta play through a thunt and it fixes.
---
Sometimes if you can‚Äôt tap fire and so your spray and miss all your shots that‚Äôs the worst feeling in the world to know your about to be penetrated by a bullet into your side while you are screaming for mercy and your life slowly fades away
---
Thanks but I‚Äôve been banned for 30 minutes because this glitch has happened twice already
---
Why should hibana break an open hatch

Actually I found this on discord and I thought it was really cool so I posted it here

Cuz she‚Äôs the best at doing it? She gets 3 charges and each charge can break the hatch, that‚Äôs 3 hatches she can get vs Thermite who only has two charges and Maverick who can only get around 2 and a half hatches (if he doesn‚Äôt get shot while doing it).

Mute for sure. Outside my bias, it‚Äôs just a good looking elite. Changes his gloves, the gadget looks neat, the weapon skins aren‚Äôt bad, and the MVP animation is badass and fits his character.

A great price!

Looks like a thot

Can you really call a helmet a cosplay?
---
Why the fuck is this so sexual??
---
That‚Äôs what I thought but then I thought it was changed so the mmr went off the high best person? Because what‚Äôs the point of matchmaking people within 1000 mmr and then doing that with the lowest player on the other team? And I doubt I was the lowest mmr on our team either!? Frustrating either way as he slapped all of us lol

Anyone willing to help me find a link to that helmet?

When Clash came out I knew she‚Äôd be overpowered or underpowered. She‚Äôs too oppressive. Montagne becomes a door or wall. Blocks entries. Clash? She slows you while you can‚Äôt do anything. Granted if you‚Äôre Zofia you can stun her, or maybe grenade her, but not every attacker is equipped to deal with her. She‚Äôs too oppressive with a teammate and too underwhelming in a 1v1. They should‚Äôve  nerfed the slow, no tick damage, but gave her a proper gun. That‚Äôs my opinion. Stalling is fine until you‚Äôre risking your life while having no way to kill the opponent. I don‚Äôt like those fights. I‚Äôd rather win and lose gun fights. Stall meta was so boring. Bunch of cameras, run outs, and traps everywhere. I‚Äôm sick and tired of traps. Traps aren‚Äôt op till they are, at 20 seconds left in the round and you‚Äôre mass clearing defenders and rushing and boom, your planter tripped a gu mine or got denied last second by Yokai. Bruuuuh
---
Why does Fuze have an original Gameboy in his right pocket?
---
Rank? Because in Plat1+ dossing happens a lot, but ubi has cut down on it a ton
---
Well obviously I didnt mean ALL the porn. What else you gonna do when you get spawnpeeked and have 3 min to kill? No, maybe just turn off like 1 or 2 of them
---
3 one tap wall bangs in one round... they thought I was hacking

how did you escape the oven get back in

No, you can be plat lll with 3,400 elo and play against a 4,400 diamond.

Recruit isn‚Äôt gonna get an elite. First off, his pick rate isn‚Äôt nearly close enough. Secondly, he‚Äôs never a real operator and not something the dev team seems to be worried about. Thirdly, recruit sucks. He‚Äôs not a good choice in any situation beside to meme.
---
shut out the assholes then fuck shit up with the nice people
---
Ok BOOMER
---
Ahhh I get it now
---
thing is they change the ops but people comfort ban them anyways
---
You read nothing of what I said did you? I said acogs belong nowhere on an operator that's 2 speed and below. Hmm Ela falls in the 3 speed. I understand you can conceive that as 1 speeds shouldn't have that but that's not how was saying it. 2 and 3 speeds should not have acogs. Ela's a 3 speed she shouldn't have it. 
---
Again I already said Ela is a close mid range operator. I understand that. You seem to not read what I'm actually saying.
---
Ela is not balanced. Again having the only gun in siege that has a random stat is not balanced. Having the only shotgun in siege that can't fight consistently at mid range is not balanced, having the weakest pistol in siege is not very balanced, having two stationary gadgets that don't help you which goes against the entire reason as to why you have gadgets is not balanced, having mines that only last 5 seconds dont have markers and are very easy to see isn't bad but not very balanced. Hmmm negatives, negatives, negatives. Balanced my ass. Don't just say you play her wrong when you have no evidence for you topic.
---
toxicity kicks are still a thing
---
Ah yes, when you don‚Äôt like facts presented to you why not just dismiss it. Plus it doesn‚Äôt even work in that sense. Ok boomer is meant to be used when someone has an outdated or dated point of view. If you are going to meme at least do it correctly
---
Making the red dot like ela‚Äôs pistol would make both reflex and holo completely inferior

what if:
---
-They don't enjoy bomb
---
-They don't enjoy bans
---
-they prefer shorter matches
---
-They may have to randomly leave sometimes
---
-They dont want to worry about ruining their rank

-They don't want to have their entire team leave every round

I remember the good old days when my PS4 controller would turn off whenever I am trying to spawn peak, all because of a good day of mortal kombat. Even now my wireless mouse does the same thing but more faster than the remote, now it is just plugged in the whole time. Which defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse....
---
100% skill obviously

Happens a lot in this season.

Gotta have a full team of fragging operators. No one that could be useful for objectives.

Jack is not relevant to Irish operators on R6S.

Definitely not Maestro.  _Might_ be Wamai, or it might be that they're doing another African op.

By logging in, I think the event for it ends tonight.

Hey [OP](/u/davidstclair), this post is likely to be removed according to subreddit rules. Consider sending a report to support or whatever to get it out to Ubi so they can try to fix the problem.
---
love how  you tkd that asshole in the beginning
---
That‚Äôs not the point, everyone on seige has this stupid passive approach to problems, think a game mode is bad? Turn it off. Operator needs fixing? Just don‚Äôt play them. Hacker? Just ignore him.  Like yea ok so if my car needs to get it‚Äôs ac fixed I should just not drive right? Baby crying? Leave it in a hole somewhere? Got back problems? Try not using your back. Smh

Spray into a wall and hope for a kill

What does the jager to tachanka mean?I'm quite new to rainbow six esports and don't understand why they do that
---
Looking forward to the creator showmatch later.
---
Macie Jay and Varsity on the same team...they got it in the bag.
---
Okay well when I get a personal perma ban, I‚Äôll hit u up ok?
---
Nope. Been here for a while.

They nerfed shields so bad the hip fire spread is bigger than your fov
---
Half the time it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm I‚Äôm anchoring and they run backend just kill me. 
---
The rest we just loaded in and I‚Äôm setting up a kapkan.
---
Him un-ADSing then ADSing again to get the shot is suspicious especially since he seems to pan too.
---
Unless you take crack of coke then youre 100% legit cosplayer for my guy Bandit
---
That's new, never seen anyone do something like this
---
Wtf that's mad
---
I have been trying to find someone with the same problem, they are also down for me, not sure what the issue is but I've checked the website and they say they are up and running. For me it gives me an error code.
---
GENIUS 3 seconds? thats a record! bravo!
---
Same me too
---
Pretty much forgot to add if they try to ping the after image instead the drone operators position is revealed
---
It's quite annoying since I just woke up and wanted to play but, that's now possible now.
---
I‚Äôm exaggerating but 2.114% of it is

Babushka of know presence of demigod
---
Does that applie to the revolver on doc and rook?
---
What do you think then now you understand
---
No. Absolutly not
---
See, I couldnt do this because my keyboard is too trash for such fine movements
---
Any help please?
---
What?
---
not even good enough if there is no j√§ger and enemies use flash and smokes
---
LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED
---
Well it says you get a bonus match scoreboard lol
---
She's practically Billie Eilish
---
Lol
---
Everyone keep saying he's shit but so far I've had good experiences with him
---
Overtime match scoreboard
---
That man is a war hero GIVE HIM SOME PANCAKES RIGHT NOW.
---
Whoooooo damn boomer chill, you want to get nosy? You think how I play video games is somehow related to who I am? First of all, holy snowflakes batman, secondly, I‚Äôm a 20 yr old guy whos good looking with green eyes, and a strong jaw, tall, and gets along really well with others, I‚Äôm high functioning sociopathic who can‚Äôt help but attract other people even tho I‚Äôm clearly hostile, people just like me idk. I‚Äôm not working atm, and don‚Äôt go outside too much, I‚Äôm incredibly healthy however and I have a solid metabolism, I eat way too much steak, nearly every single day, I earn side money by flipping, and I‚Äôm pretty damn ok w life, I can‚Äôt say I have any real struggles and I‚Äôm very stress free. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just not the bad guy you so desperately wish I am, however I‚Äôd like to be, as being the bad guy always seems fun to me.
---
I do teamkill, and I tease people for amusement, however I‚Äôm very chill and make plenty of followers on Xbox, however I just really enjoy playing solo on siege and just teamkill during casual matches, it‚Äôs just more fun, and it‚Äôs just a game, you being hostile just makes me slightly amused, and let‚Äôs me know I‚Äôve bothered you, it‚Äôs a game, I‚Äôm not hacking, I‚Äôm not telling anyone I fucked their mother, I‚Äôm just sabotaging rounds occasionally for fun, stop tryharding so much and maybe siege will stop being this contest for who‚Äôs the better human and start being a fun video game that has little to no effect on the real world
---
Br√∂ther no
---
Whoops sorry typo
---
*oki doki boomer
---
yup, dw
---
I think he is not that bad, just really situational, because if there is a J√§ger or no grenade, he is kinda useless.
---
It just isn't that easy to create the maps
---
Bandits and J√§gers weapons even have the ACOG on those pictures...RIP
---
Yes, but for cloak it might be op but these are great ideas
---
Fam, y aren't u?
---
Sadly a friends said to me ‚ÄúBuy Warden, he look really cool‚Äù and I bought it lmao. Anyways, I don‚Äôt regret buying it, because I wanted to try it.
---
I am sure it could be balanced
---
Yeah thats the only down side, but if the enemy team got a blitz its a free kill
---
Get Kills
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt connect to the servers at all
---
Ikr this later turned into 50 mins
---
Yes sure
---
Top right could've worked if it wasn't for the stilettos.
---
I hate getting so many notifications every season
---
nice
---
You have some Great ideas keep thinking on more operators it might get on siege good luck
---
Thanks
---
Ur welcome
---
RIP
---
Looks fine to me
---
I would have zero reason to ban jackal if his ping didn't alert his entire fucking team. If he is tracking you, his team shouldn't be alerted. I strongly disagree with global alert abilities in R6 and until it's changed; fuck jackal he can stay out of my games.
---
I think both look good but I personally prefer the bottom one
---
The only Xbox league is ESL‚Äôs Europe league. That‚Äôs the last one I was in during early Year 2. My friends and I were so desperate we joined it and had to adhere to European time zones. Played a few games and quit it. 
---
The situation with console leagues is they will most likely be ran by MnK users. As ladders on both MLG &amp; ESL have MnK users all throughout. A reason we stopped playing Go4 Cups on Xbox was because of BLATANT MnK teams. It‚Äôs pretty bogus competitively on console.
---
Are you the level 50 mentioned?
---
Oh, I don‚Äôt experience that much myself. I‚Äôve almost got an even split between EU and NA and I only had people get removed on two occasions, both EU and it was only ever one person who later returned after 3 or 4 rounds
---
oh thank Jah my Internet was just australian so it did like 14.4p resolution
---
Ouch, spawnpeeked my feelings..
---
I watch a lot of pros play i dn how they move so fast and so accuratly.Its too fast for me to process
---
Wheres that shitty repost bot this time?
---
Dude I've been playing this game for 2 years and a blitz charging me is still my worst fear.
---
Close second is when cav creep walks around a corner when I least expect it.
---
Chill, i Just took the most famous i could think of
---
I think that as well is one of the biggest frustrations. I have no quarrels with being tracked by Jackal, roaming or not, until the whole team comes after me. If it was only Jackal who can see the ping, then he would not be an issue nearly as much
---
Good point might have to make it every 2 seconds or cut it down to 7 seconds
---
Change your squad. Use the R6 discord. Keep those who are encouraging even when you failed.
---
When you are enjoying the game, it will get better.

English subs made by me
---
First part potato aim but then that happens
---
Yeah some thing like this, otherwise it would be way too strong
---
Thats true
---
I don't comfort ban jackal. His ability is busted as is and I whole heatedly believe that it's busted. If the enemy team bans him. Monty is my next ban. A solid Monty player can wreak havock on an entire match.
---
If it was an accident, wouldnt it imply you were lucky, therefore they mean the same thing
---
I rarely see him being played in ranked; silver to plat 2 games
---
Play a lot of thunt and work on aim and movement.
---
I spent HOURS in thunt just getting the muscle memory for quick peeking.
---
if it goes past 3 or 4 minutes then it most likely won't find a match
---
Ight really be like that, don‚Äôt it. üò§
---
That‚Äôs illegal!
---
Ok thx
---
Oof
---
Welcome to casual!
---
Lmaooooo
---
Cav Anchor
---
96% boring as fuck. Everyone either in party chat or also soloQ but not giving callout. 
---
Use r6 discord.

What did i watch

**Cosplay Comment Reminder:**
---
Keep comments limited on the quality of the cosplay only. Rude, overtly sexual, innuendo, harassing or insulting comments will result in moderator action. Keep it clean and on topic, please.
---
Ooooh mAh gawd
---
If the opposition team has any kind of skill you wont be able to draw out the ping that long before dying. As for going back to site while it would work, a team without roamers is unlikely to win rounds. This is why jackal is still banned this often.
---
As for your original post i see many more than 5 people banned and very rarely blitz and cav. 
---
On attack i see: thatcher, monty, blackbeard, jackal, maverick, lion, dokkaebi and occasionally thermite or hibana
---
On defense i see: valk, echo,mira, lesion, clash, kaid and sometimes bandit
---
And the new ops are getting banned as well but that is likely to stop in a week or 2.
---
see you in hot
---
is there any word for ubi on wtf going on?
---
Hello Cord_NZ, **[your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/eazs2d/fix_queing_its_kinda_broken_the_average_mmr/) in /r/Rainbow6 has been removed for the following reason(s):**
---
Extra points for telling the sauce, more points for subs. (Now if upvoting could be done more than once).
---
And I assume you want to play echo
---
I tried looking it up but didn‚Äôt see anything about it
---
It is now? Poggers
---
Aight then basically the Ê≤ñ in Ê≤ñ„Éâ„Ç≠„Éñ„Éº„Éû„Éº can be read as oki but the meaning is completely different. Ê≤ñ means offshore or sea of. In words or phrases derived from languages that are not japanese, katakana must be used, unless there is a kanji made for it, which in this case it hasn‚Äôt.
---
seems some people have been getting the same issues, others dont.. and no word from ubi
---
Wack, language apps don‚Äôt teach u anything practical and nobody takes the time to teach foreigners
---
Also 3 of them, including op have a tk symbol. I dont know who started it, might very well be that op only reacted, and these kids are without a doubt an absolute embarrassment, but i doubt there is an entirely innocent party in this mess.
---
Which website?
---
And that is what makes Siege such a great game cause every idiot can hold left click
---
#The jojo reference is now marked in your map
---
If you watch JoJo, do not skip anything, even if you hate it. 
---
This episode is a combined clip of part 4, and from part 2, so the actual scene does not look exactly like this.
---
The best part about JoJo is learning that some of the memes you like are from JoJo.
---
Very interesting idea, but how would the gadget interact with gu mines? It could be really annoying if you had to pull them both out.
---
Also I'd totally love a pp bizon in siege.
---
Brooo you super talented
---
And better pokegirls
---
It's nice
---
a fair few of us tried the same with no answer..
---
The other thing is the fucking Apple keyboard makes ZERO sense
---
it's not a viable ranked map either, it's god awful
---
jojo, stw, and r6 in one thread. reddit has peaked
---
Black Ice, nice.
---
Amazing
---
Universal skins? No
---
Are you getting this code 3-0x0001000B?
---
what?
---
They couldn't handle the bosg acog power
---
Why would we teach it tho it‚Äôs such a shit language lmao
---
Hell yeah. üòé
---
Can confirm, only started watching because i got sick of not understanding the jokes my mates made. Now my life is complete as i understand
---
Skrt skrt!
---
KNACK IS BACK BABEEE
---
Unexpected, but not unwelcome.
---
Same, he‚Äôs more of an annoyance than toxic. I was saying lesion because his gu is literally toxic/poison.
---
Lesion is useless 4 ranked since he gets banned in every other game, so...
---
Shaking my shaking head my.
---
Hey does anyone know the 2 secret achievements in rainbow. I've gotten all of them but those 2?
---
Ok
---
VIBE CHECK

I live everything about this
---
Nothing probably, just people disliking her lmao
---
YES THIS IS THE CROSS COTENT IM LOOKING FOR
---
You Need minimaly a Headset with digital sourroundsound to hear better, thats one Thing. Then youll have to Work in your aim maybe, watch when being in a Fight and try finding Out what you wrong, crosshairplacement is important too. You also Need to know what to do in which Situation, cant really explain. For ex. If in a 1vX you allways Need to keep moving. If you get a frag, rotate to another Spot as they would know your Location. Are you in a 1v1, where do you wait/Attack? Idk what your Playtime is but If you have good enough Hardware and Headset youll improve with time.
---
The problem is in the player base. Not the system. Sometimes it is a good idea to ban a Jackal, like Villa or Outback, two larger maps where Jackal can seriously hinder roaming. On maps like Bank, Echo is a must ban. He can sit back in vault and win a round 1v whatever if no one finds him and the game is low on time, he just stalls out a plant. There is nothing wrong with the system the problem is with the player base who repeatedly bans these ops when they don‚Äôt need to be banned. 
---
I‚Äôm in low plat and I still see a variety of different bans (Thatcher, Thermite, Kaid, Valk, Lesion, Mira, Mav) but I don‚Äôt want any op to be unbannable that defeats the purpose
---
Didn't expect actually helpful advice here, thanks :)
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo
---
Thanx Nanba!
---
That shading is really fucking lit
---
So who‚Äôs cavs stand user?
---
what a retard lol
---
this was INCREDIBLE
---
I laughed, I cried, I struck a pose. 10/10
---
Oh.
---
One more reason to love the Airforce! Hopefully I'll be with you guys soon. Thank you for your service!
---
Wait holy crap, theres ALSO AN IRON BLOODED ORPHANS REFERENCE
---
I think that's a Smoke voice line instead of a Sledge one when he says "I've gotcha mate!"
---
Why does she looks like megamind
---
The last part are a reference to gundam iron blood right ?
---
If you wish to know this was the Highway star fight mixed in with the Caesar vs Wahmu fight.
---
what ? terrorist hunt also suffers from this ? smh
---
I‚Äôm glad I have the current Ela Elite... never would‚Äôve got any other.
---
The casa de papel event made sense because it was a heist, much like the bank map
---
I mean it‚Äôs all about the EU teams really. I love Joystick not Beaulo
---
Even If i dont Play her, I would Like for some Ops a headgear of their normal head, for her, Zofia, Clash, maybe rook, all examples.
---
i'm so thankfull I saw this
---
jeez, it's the server problem then.
---
Did I seriously just get goosebumps from a r6 jojo meme?
---
Amazing. See u in hot
---
Best post in this sub so far
---
This definitely isn‚Äôt loss, is it?
---
Just any outfit that's screams IM ARTSY AND A REBEL
---
This is one high quality meme right here
---
But neither Dok nor Ying are Japanese....
---
Damn, that's really cool. Personally I was thinking of getting Twitch tattooed on my left arse cheek.
---
Lol show the finished work
---
Thanks, best of luck on your endeavors with joining lol it's a rough process but many make it through.
---
There should be more people like you! Keep it up :-)
---
Ngl little bit strange
---
Rainbow is Magic ‚Üí best Event
---
This happened in Ember Rise but not this much, 3 out of 5 match i experienced this problem.
---
I don't have this issue with a weaker PC
---
What do you use to record/stream?
---
Or maybe it is and they‚Äôve been lying to us this whole time as an excuse for me a shitty map comes out
---
Just trying to help
---
&gt;megamind
---
I have no idea who this is though
---
Im Home in 15m, imma do it
---
Obs
---
Thanks and go for it, get what you want, buddy if mine has Ella on his shin as well
---
nvenc?
---
This is the best post to ever grace this site.
---
Yes, the new Nvidia H.264
---
Isn't that just his default gas mask?
---
Yeah too bad they nerfed the fire rate on the AA12 way back cause maestro could have actually done this. AA12 was actually decent before that nerf
---
 it seems like they put all 4 skins on the wrong weapons
---

I love all of these but the final one fits the game the most I think.
---
Aim for the headü§Ø‚ò†Ô∏è
---
I've nutted over this like six times, cheers.
---
cough cough first one better cough cough
---
Ahhh
---
You‚Äôre a god damn savant.
---
Worked pretty well against Straits
---
fetty wap reference?
---
Yeah I'm not much of a console player myself.
---
I didn't say It was more toxic than casual, we all know how bad Casual was at times what I'm saying is that my experience with Quick match is worse than my experience in Casual.
---
Plus side note they have changed the game mode how rounds work you don't flit from attacking to defending with each round . It's a different mode to casual.
---
Oh boy it is!
---
Is it just me or did these bots stop working?
---
You the man for saucing!
---
You get the tickets from opening packs or paying with 50000 renown only
---
on Christmas
---
Which one do you like better?
---
It's still working, but it DMs you instead of replying your comment.
---
SHIZAAAAAA
---
It looks like a silver honeycomb
---
M762 works in most scenarios. E is good but takes an extra shot on 3 armours, so ttk is higher.
---
The AR easy
---
Same with J√§gers Carbine and Twitchs F2  
---
They're from year1, but still
---
You missed..?
---
This is nice.
---
anyone get overwhlemed when there are this many cams and just doesn't check cams that round
---
One of the dumbest skins to date. Member when this game was about being tactical?
---
Changing the rotation doesn't make it a different game mode.
---
also on sky and having issues (Pc)
---
Getting a penetration kill with a suppressed p12. I didn't think it was possible.
---
Seriously though the gun is already bad
---
What other guys said but also don't watch any jojo memes until you watch jojo. I would have given za warudo to not get part 3 reveal spoiled by za warudo memes compilation.
---
This is fucking amazing OP you have a great mind and a heart of gold fo' real this is top tier stuff professional quality
---
SHEEEEESHEEEEEER
---
Why is this game linked to anime so much
---
Then thatcher was run down by an ambulance
---
I mean I main hibanna. Now getting someone to play Thatcher, kali or twitch and not get spawn peeked and actually use there gadget on the wall you want to breach that's a different story.
---
Same here makes getting a double kill + pretty much impossible
---
That top Kali picture üëå
---
no it isnt, check the "nighthaven r&amp;d" uniforms and headgear (iirc its there for IQ and Ela, forgot the rest), those have the collection tags on them; those are the paid alpha packs for the season.
---
these could part of the battlepass or a normal bundle, who knows
---
I think C8 looks better and probably when you use vertical grip on it you get lower recoil then M4 i guess
---
Oof ok
---
Horrr-e shit!
---
I can die happy now
---
Nah that will be a time waste
---
I actually did not know you had a YouTube channel
---
_PADORUU PADORUUUUU_~~~~
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I just fixed it
---
While her elite does have it, I‚Äôd just like to have it without her elite set.
---
This is how far Rainbow has come. We get Grade A fan creations such as this and honestly I'm just super happy about it. Thanks for sharing this I really appreciate it!
---
That was beautiful
---
Bruh you deserve more upvotes. Id even reward u if i could
---
Baby
---
Stando
---
Overall M762(rifle) is better
---
This is some super weeb shit
---
Below 130 fps? Might as well throw the computer away
---
How???
---
It set up Joseph's special move perfectly.
---
Turned my router off and on
---
That's fair enough, I'll try that soon
---
I hardly update on YT unfortunately!
---
Why do you play with my kokoro like this :'(
---
This would be a huge disadvantage to yourself.
---
Why is he tipping a ghost fedora?
---
 [u/vredditdownloader](https://www.reddit.com/u/vredditdownloader/)
---
Is Kaid better or worse than Bandit? I thought with Bandit losing ACOG they‚Äôd be pretty much the same but I haven‚Äôt played Kaid enough to know
---
Yeah this reminds me of all the crazy skins and camos in the recent black ops games, you stand out from everything so much
---
Does this make Kira the strongest Hamon user???
---
i'm just saying you can't just call them pro strats when the video seems like you explaining a basic good hold of oregon
---
Well yeah they have different hit sounds
---
How would you fix that tho
---
Impressive
---
yeah i understand but these ideas did come from a pro player
---
Yeah any time someone has the lesion Halloween head on it's and easy headshot because it's literally glowing.
---
Fuck we need a series about this. I will literally throw money at them to make more. They got a patreon or something
---
 Is that a reference to a series of Japanese origin created in 1987 by a man named Hirohiko Araki that follows the adventures of the descendants of the family known as Joestar in which the main character is known as Jojo and must use supernatural powers to defeat the villains of their respective parts with the first of said powers being the energy of the sun known as ‚ÄòThe ripple‚Äô or ‚ÄòHamon‚Äô that was used for the first two parts until part three ‚ÄòStardust Crusaders‚Äô where instead of Hamon the protagonists must use psychic embodiments of their fighting spirit called ‚ÄòStands‚Äô because they stand beside you where the part three stands are named for Tarot cards and Egyptian gods but by part four ‚ÄòDiamond is Unbreakable‚Äô they have have a tendency to be named after songs as shown Josuke Higishikata‚Äôs (Jojo) stand which is called Crazy Diamond in reference to the Pink Floyd song ‚ÄòShine on you crazy diamond‚Äô but eventually in part six ‚ÄòStone Ocean‚Äô the universe is reset and we enter the universe called the ‚ÄòSteel Ball run‚Äô Universe by fans because it is the universe where parts seven and eight ‚ÄòSteel ball run‚Äô and ‚ÄòJojolion‚Äô take place and is also the introduction of the ‚ÄòSpin‚Äô which is thought to be that universe‚Äôs counterpart to Hamon?Ôªø
---
wow a bug in this game? no way!
---
Tnx
---
Wtf is that
---
Jojo six siege
---
Fixed yet ?
---
You got a Point but i think that at this Point she is too similar to him, nomad and gridlock, Bandit and kaid have about the Same Gadgets but they are completely different from each other, Not really the Case with this Idea.
---
That was amazing. This is what the internet was made for.
---
or maybe..just maybe, if they win 2 defense rounds, means they're just a better team that would win anyway
---
Nah but I think I will soon, thx man
---
Yeah, I know. I always make that mistake when typing his name, but thanks for the heads-up.
---
But two of the toes are big toes. And all her fingers in that picture as well are conjoined together.
---
That feature never worked for multiplayer. It was only every for T-Hunt.
---
welcome to casual - the land of leaver, teamkiller, notreinforcer and most certainly, no achors
---
NANI?
---
This is amazing, holy shit!
---
Post this in r/shitpostcrusaders if you haven't already
---
And that‚Äôs the sound my sleep paralysis demons make!
---
So a better Ela. Game design on fleek.
---
That's one overpowered gadget
---
Anime is 40% this, 40% the main character brooding all cool-like, and 10% big tits.
---
They do it only when you join at a beginning of the round, if you join mid match you won't get kicked; it isn't toxic they just want to play the game
---
.
---
We did it bois. FORTNITE is no more.
---
I know, it‚Äôs just it was a lucky wallbang
---
It's my Ela elite sketch wdym
---
So you would want a 3 speed OP with a gadget that can flash AND deals damage equaling to half an op's HP? Either you make the flash last an instant or you nerf the damage because you'd end up having Helios camping an entry point waiting for the trap to go off then rushing in for the free kill
---
Looking great. I use the standard S-10 for my Thatcher cosplay and have to ask, what alterations do you see on mask? I never noticed any major differences aside that Thatcher uses the Special Forces version.
---
Clutch?
---
Why?
---
how
---
It‚Äôs just casual prolly. Who gives a crap
---
Grey hair, and looks more like Docs face.
---
nah, its totally smoke he has that kind of haircut
---
Like what ?
---
Do you have a solution so a 4 stack who would have legitimate reason to kick someone could still do ?
---
you can naturally get up to around 60%
---
its wamais elbow
---
Stopped one from planting and clapped lesion
---
I think because of the backlash it will be apart of a more expensive season pass. I‚Äôm expecting a $40 pass for year 5 if they do that
---
He already did https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitPostCrusaders/comments/eazk0r/rainbow_six_siege_x_jojo
---
Yeah, but it's pretty much impossible to get to 100% without throwing a significant amount of games
---
&gt;Actually downvotes lower my score so it means more people upvoted than downvoted.
---
Yes. That's why I said just one.
---
And if we're on about votes, don't get me started on how many downvotes your comment replies got and how many upvotes me and the other dude got. Trust me, you don't want to pull out those cards
---
&gt;It's not my fault that you did not convince me. I still feel Kali is overpowered, so you didn't present anything convincing enough.
---
That's not my fault. You refused/failed to understand counter arguments. And then went on to delete the post. That's your fault for refusing to listen.
---
&gt; I don't think Kali needs to be a one shot down to be useful. 
---
Ok let's see what you for.
---
&gt;She still has the best scope in the game,
---
Ok...
---
&gt; can replace thatcher,
---
???
---
You're joking, right?
---
Give me numbers. Now.
---
&gt;and can hold very long angles into site. 
---
So?
---
Your choices are to sit and hold long angles and stay away from the objective where you are supposed to plant, or get in and do the job while all the defenders know where you are and stay away from your angles. Good luck getting *anything* done from your cozy perch 20 miles away.
---
&gt;I think Kali mains are scared at the idea of having to get headshots like everybody else.
---
There are no Kali mains besides a few on Reddit. It's suicide to be a Kali main because you aren't effective in CQB.
---
Please do these are beautiful&lt;3
---
imagine how pissed you‚Äôd get if you won every game and still got to 100
---
If someone got this while winning matches they must have very good luck, or bad luck if they wanted a pack.
---
So the 4th round becomes the decider?
---
The insane part being when they repelled into the skylight? You're right - that is totally insane.
---
Honestly it is the maps themselves.
---
The one that looks like a good old classic AK with those hot wood and metal D E T A I L S
---
The one on thatcher isn‚Äôt real my man, it‚Äôs made up by ubi. It‚Äôs a model based on S10 but it‚Äôs slimmer
---
Wont happen
---
Yeah no that‚Äôs Doc.
---
Pros tend to use 1x sights on nearly every gun (depending on the map obviously)
---
There's going to be a mini Thermite coming for attackers

Smonk. One of the best loadouts on defense deployable or barbed wire and his smokes are amazing
---
Disgusting.
---
Get a stack or deal with it
---
Nah on some defensively sided map it's not unreasonable to get 9 defense wins. This is one hundred percent RNG and can affect the end result
---
That‚Äôs what happens when you mess with your fov I guess
---
It's doc. They wouldn't just put smoke face out there like that

jager is a top tier, not because his guns are easy to use, but because his gadget is so insanely useful its a death wish not to run him

Who's the guy on the intercom anyway?

If your argument doesn't change my mind you can't say it's a reflection of me and not your argument.

I don't think Kali is better than Thatcher I meant her role could be the same on certain objectives, like Chalet garage, Consulate garage.  Long angles into sight can be from inside, like on Chalet through the back bomb for example.  And you're acting like a round isn't 3 minutes long.  You don't have to either rush or stay outside.  You can blend both and methodically push into site.  At this point I don't think either of us are going to change our minds so it may be best to move on.

Have a good holidays my man.

It felt pretty dirty

The only part of it I like is the weapon skin. I think the rest is kinda really ugly.
---
Smoke and ela
---
Beautiful
---
It just feels wrong, and it merges the game to much into a ranked style only,insted of feeling like different modes
---
No, **YOU** main Mira now.
---
Game's ruined for me, now
---
Plat 3-2 WEU this season so far. Haven't seen any obvious hackers, could be unlucky. Are they very blatant about it or what?
---
Have any footage?
---
Any video of him?
---
Any killcam of him killing you so we can judge for ourselves?
---
Because all we have is your word
---
Someone just got out played and is cryin lmao
---
Ubisoft: "That would be 25.000 Renown or 250 R6 Credits please, checkout is this way"
---
I would he has elite
---
It‚Äôs in the link. ‚ÄúBrendyn‚Äù not only can you see it you can hear him using his keyboard too. In the kill cams he also obnoxiously shows off it by shaking his cursor.
---
Thank you! I post all my artworks on Twitter, Instagram and R6 Discord, so you might have seen it somewhere in your feed
---
Its...so...beautiful... enough to make a grown man cry
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how much high sensitivity can look like mnk on console. I play at 100 horizontal and 60 vertical and get asked a lot.
---
Alibi is so underrated
---
sincerely, the game right now is highly defender favored and the amount of trap operator is kinda too much for the attacker... to me, the game need more aggressive attacker to balance the game, or new defender that helps the team instead of targeting the attackers.. the idea isn't useless, but would be so frustrating for the attacker and it would make a huge nerf to pulse, since every one will be able to spot the marked attacker... i think that instead of being thrown on the walls like a wamai's gadget, if it would be attached to a door or window frame like a kapkan trap, it would be easier for attacker to not get spotted, but would still work on those who just rush or the players that aren't carefull enough... since they would be easier to spot and destroy, talrelka could have up to 4, and he would get them at the same way lesion gets his gu-mines.. that way, he can't just place all of them and spawnpeak and die.. he would need to stay alive to make it work, thus, helping the team.
---
what do you think about that?
---
y1,2,3 and 4(season pass), year 5 need to be buyed when it comes.
---
Dude. The servers can barely keep up with single platform play. Although it would be legit.
---
Pretty blatant they were just trolling with it
---
And I 100% agree, shes one of my mains :)
---
Looks good on buck and mozzie too
---
Yeah I play high sens on console too it‚Äôs just thought OPs aim seemed way too good for console
---
I feel like this is gonna get gay real quick
---
Too big community and doesn't host esl teams
---
I don't mind cosplays, in fact I enjoy them but group them up in one thread. Don't start different threads for photos of the same cosplay
---
What if I wait for y5s1 and install then?
---
Yeah I love just doing nutty plays with Alibi like putting holograms behind places people prefire and where people spawn peek so it shoots the hologram
---
And yes, I move like A LOT, due to playing Call of Duty in the past
---
I like it
---
No you need to pay for year 5 it not included in ultimate edition.
---
Siege and Jojo combined is already incredible enough but the fact you also added an Iron Blooded Orphans reference makes this my favorite video of all time
---
All three of my favorite things together in one!
---
no, you bought it in y4 so it's the year 4 pass
---
Yeah Gridlock is good I think what people turn people off from her is how slow she is
---
What link? All it shows is an image, i think the link was removed
---
so alibi for attackers
---
Yeah, I do same thing just put trap to window  hit once in windows so people think im spawnpeeking and then they shoot it
---
Best R6 JoJo reference so far mate. Amazing job
---
okie dokie thanks for the answer
---
https://youtu.be/IeKtVASg75I I edited it here you go my bad I‚Äôm sorry.
---
thx for answer deletin thread now
---
Yeah basically lol but maybe more flexible than alibi just standing still in one area and the hologram would disappear either when shot or in a few seconds
---
So twich but a gun
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
I'm definitely paying real money for that Jager skin.
---
If it pisses the other team off its because they want it 4v5. What if one of there players dc, wouldn't they want a pause too? 1 per team would be ok  imo. More to that point, you gain less elo when theres less players on the opposing team so that's a thing to consider too.
---
I honestly don't know, it just has an entirely different feel that me and friends don't enjoy. How is it meant to improve gameplay flow.
---
and bandit, jager and smoke have acog for defenders
---
that my friend is a mac-10, it‚Äôs not even in siege so idk why it‚Äôs in the picture
---
From scratch, airsoft and replica firearms are illegal where I live
---
Im blind apparently lol
---
Search function ACOG when ?
---
And Doktor's Curse sledgehammer might have a word with you
---
Wait really? That‚Äôs shite
---
Why would they pick a visor?
---
H:55 v:23 ads:25 dz:5
---
Anti spawn peak hammer use
---
Because rather than doing an attack round and seeing how they play than doing defence and playing there and than going back to attack and you have to think about how they play to better go up against them. When you do AA-DD it allows you to make those changes faster and without as much thought. There is a reason PL did it, Ranked follow suit. It makes the game flow better. It‚Äôs a small change sure but the old way was worse from a gameplay perspective

Why would i need a higher rank
---
I am having a continuous problem with the interaction between steam and uplay regarding rainbow 6 siege. I originally bought the game on steam and have over 700 hrs played. A few days ago, i bought a second account but this time failed to recognize the necessity of buying the game from steam again. Now I have both a steam and uplay version of the game. I tried this solution to be able to launch both using the same set of files but whenever I try to launch my original steam account, I am asked to enter an activation key. This happens without your fix as well. The only way it seems to work is if I uninstall any trace of the uplay game and only use my original steam account.
---
Is there any fix to this problem? After searching around and trying the various different solutions including uninstalling/reinstalling uplay/rainbow six and have also reinstalled the game a few times. Is there any way I can find that cd key? I cant seem to find it using any of the methods to find it on either uplay or steam. I really don't want to lose my account :(
---
Thanks.

Thanks üòä, will try to improve.

I think giving the search function an ACOG would make it a bit too strong.
---
I was trying to say :
---
#"Use search function before posting . This is another repost"
---
^^
---
It's just an even where every single weapon and gadget has an acog on it
---
But hey . at least it will stop reposters
---
üòéüòé

Nice

Nothing can...
---
Its cause its a needed feature

I think they started being processed in Para Bellum. I remember Alibi would occasionally just not be there.
---
I got 388ms

I really can‚Äôt express how much I love this.
---
Excuse me the F90 is a great gun
---
because they are the most played, so more monees,
---
Thanks i hate it
---
Ubi should have an april fools even where every gun is forced to have an ACOG. Or at least every primary. Just to see what happens
---
I don't feel that works for casual though. Most casual players aren't thinking about how their enemies play except for spawnpeeks and rushes. Both of witch you can figure out it 1 round. Casual players are there to get picks and have fun, not tryhard.
---
Guess it‚Äôs true

Who?

Ela's elite skin in-game makes her look like the drugged up girl in Disco Elysium.

wouldnt that just be any teamgame ever

The attention to detail in the second headgear is quite  e x t r a v a g e n t.

100 percent of you buy that one bundle with a black ice for frosts  shotgun
